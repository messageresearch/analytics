you who are here are in his presence there are others that are watching this online because of various reasons we pray for all the house of god all the family of god wherever they are whether they're in their living rooms right now whether they're across the sea and for those of you who are right here before me we want to thank and praise god for that today we'd like to speak on the topic of the messenger from heaven the messenger from heaven and that of course will come from revelation chapter 10 verses 1 reading to verse 7 amen and we'll talk about this for a while and may the lord bless us because what i'm simply trying to show or will show is that the seventh messenger brother branham finishes his work and then another messenger comes down and it's in the word of god i know because of not having heard anybody saying things like this it'll sound like if it's way out way off but search the scriptures search the message search the word it's nothing out there somewhere it's right in the word i'll give you some of the quotations and you can follow it up i can't give you a whole a ton of them like i have in front of me here because i'm not going to uh quote all of them to you but um they're there but they will only see when it is time for them to see it's not that they weren't there they were there all the time but but you could be reading them over a thousand times but you only see when god wants you to see right and the r has come when god is allowing us to see him in the word and i feel blessed by the presence of the holy spirit of almighty god that he has opened my eyes and is opening my eyes to the word that i might bring the word of god to you and it's an individual thing now where every one has to weigh the word not take it because i say it not because i'm the pastor not because i'm quoting from brother branham it is you with the holy spirit that has to take this word and weigh it because we can bring no one in you have to come in by yourself and the entryway is the word the way is the word and you come through the word the door is the word to go into the next dimension is the word going to the third fullest the word the holy spirit opens the word and takes you through the portals into the presence of almighty god hallelujah father we thank you for thy word today and we ask your inspiration we pray you'll hold back the old satan that serpent and let your word have a free flow to the minds and hearts of your people here and everywhere father take glory honor and praise in the name of jesus christ amen and amen god bless you revelation 10 1 2 7. and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven close it with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet us pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven standards had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice amen from heaven saying unto me seal up these things amen which the seven thunders uttered and write them not whatever the seven thunders uttered were not to be written did to be revealed did it be understood by the people of god it is not an addition to the word it's nothing it's the very word but back to its original form not writing but revelation right praise god because we speak i'm speaking now and you can write it down but that's just a representation of my words that i'm speaking now right so for you to get my words you got to hear it again but me saying it and then you get the real thing but praise god hallelujah and the angel which is i saw stand up on the scene upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that they were in earth and the things that are therein and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets hallelujah amen praise god you know the rest of it and how that book was then given to john and john had to eat it right praise god that's another thing again all together oh my and when when john at it it was sweet in his mouth but the reactions that he would get from people around him and everywhere was bitter in his belly now what he's got to go through for that word praise god the lord bless you real god please be seated you know i remember in the early days when i had just come praise the lord to the united states and to canada in actual fact because of the holy spirit as a young man uh uh you know just 18 years old preaching the word and revival breaking out and churches coming up and i was in the west coast of our country where i met my wife and um by the way one of the preachers early converts when i was just a teenager that got converted and stayed faithful and has a church still operating there just went to his reward just a few days ago left and went to be with the lord and during that time ministering the word of god is when a brother joseph coleman out of new york city i never met him he had never met me but he heard of the moving of the holy spirit and the power and presence of god and so he just sent a ticket invited me to come up to his church at that time he was not preaching or teaching anything like thunders or nothing of the sort just preaching the prophet and the message of the prophet as it is and then uh came up there and that's when i preached around the united states went down to perry green and go up on the mountain where the angels met the prophet he took me up there the words eagle were still written in the rock and white courts it was there it was so sacred to us we would not dig it out or touch it or anything of that nature now when i go back it's gone it dug it out the the tree cornered rocks were scattered around the ground and everything else you can pick them up if you wanted but it was so sacred to us we would not pick them up touch them oh they're all gone until the person that owned that side of the mountain actually blocked it and stopped anybody from going back up because they were carrying away everything possibly to maybe create a shrine at home or something in their backyard whatever i don't know but that's what happened but then i you know i went back and i came back here and uh to canada and then while i was here preaching the word of god uh it came to pass that the holy spirit began to break on me because one morning showing to me in the word of god have you received the holy ghost since you believed but he continued this message have you received the holy ghost since you believed this message no i being a pentecostal and speaking in towns and by the way i still do if the holy spirit needs to do that um and of course that was strange but i already got the holy ghost yes but the question keeps going blue through the mind and burning at you have you received the holy ghost since you believed this message in other words yes you might have gotten it over there but that's for there have you received the holy ghost since you believed this message amen hallelujah then of course it starts breaking that means you must be born again you're telling me i wasn't born again when i was back there in pentecost and i have to be born again here and then the words start to open no man was responsible for that nobody nothing i was accosted i was called names everything else the church i had in in toronto broke to pieces parts of it are still alive today but my goodness at that time word went back to brother coleman who was now preaching the seven thunders and i was there with him when he started and was right there along with it but one day going up to one of his meetings on a bus i started falling asleep and that same boy spoke the first and spoke again genesis 1 11 every seed shall bring forth after its kind whose kind are you going to be his or mine and of course i'm still like unconsciously saying well yours lord and then of course i i i woke up in a shock my who am i talking to nobody is around but then i realized now you got to move away from that thing even though you don't see nothing yet nothing yet is showing but the holy spirit tell me no step step away from it you listen to what i'm going to tell you but you step away from and i stepped away from it before anything shoe before end there was any details and all the people got mad everything to come against me like i said the church going to pieces and different ones like that you know will of course make it short it's years later everybody believes that now everybody believes that now you know and more than that i was so discouraged and and wondering could it be that how could i how could this be right and and and you know all these brothers preaching that and i'm going to come say something like this but then again i go into whether vision or dream and while i'm like that i saw myself preaching preaching preaching preaching the word and the congregation and in the middle of the congregation all of a sudden i saw brother branham sitting in the congregation and when i saw him of course i got self-conscious right and he could sense it so he stood up and he said are those things that you are preaching are they found in the bible and i said yes sir and while he's saying that he got up and he walked right up came to the pulpit and he looked at my notes and he looked at the scripture that i had open and he said they are found in the bible continue preaching it i've done that from that until now and i'm still preaching it i never seen the man in the flesh never seen him never met him never heard him but i've seen him and met him in the spirit more than once and i want to thank god that he's the same yesterday today and forever i realized what i'm saying anybody could say they see this they see that they heard this and they heard that and make up something uh to you know but let me tell you the holy spirit will bear record to the word he will bear record of whatever you say if you stay by the word hallelujah praise god and we come to this hour now when brother anybody could say what do they want their voices all around you carrying on and everything else but until god takes his own word and vindicates that thing you don't know anything until god himself does it so praise god and you know from since preaching about the eternal church age it's just like a week now but already being called false called you don't know what you're talking about uh you know this that the other all kinds of names but the fact is brother sister just learned jesus was on the earth the bible said they marked his mouth and then the holy spirit said you know what that mean i never understood i was quoting even that but i didn't understand but he said you know what that was he said it was the scribes and whatever he said they were writing it down so that they can catch him later on if he says something else i never even understood that but the holy spirit said that's what it was so you see it's good now don't get nervous now about note-taking i didn't say that for you to get nervous and don't take notes you see what he was pointing at is the motivation of why you're taking the notes right like brother branham said they're listening but they're listening with ears to debate and for strife and things of that nature but let's listen that we might receive the word of god and growing it and be fed by him the great holy spirit okay so let's go forth in the name of the lord and see what god has in store for us messenger from heaven praise god well um uh just to get to the point you realize the scripture already tell your plane who's the messenger from heaven is that right because it didn't say william branham will descend with a shout out no william branham was only a part of the lord's descent the lord himself is the messenger from heaven the lord himself will descend with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the threefold is the fullness of that mighty angel of god that came down according to the word and is made known to us we read different scriptures and to connect them together on the stand that is the same god hallelujah now let me give you quotations so that you just don't think i'm saying these things of myself listen brother branham speaking sirs is this the end uh the sign of the end he said now remember the capstone was never interpreted these seven angels in the constellation came to me the mighty thunder or the seventh angel in the seventh constellation seventh period constellation their pyramid made in a form of three on the side and one on top and they all drop down from eternity is this the mystery of the thunders what will bring back the headstone you know the pyramid has never been kept the headstone is yet to come for it's been rejected oh my did you notice before the seven seals were revealed and before the great mysterious light showed in the heavens up there two men was with me this morning that morning when the blast went off and those seven seals which held seven mysteries of the entire bible listen close was sealed in those seven seals how these angels came along the road remember them angels were the messengers of them seven church ages opened it up to a certain point of it right but in the seventh hour the seventh messenger all these mysteries should be finished the seventh earthly messenger remember seventh earthly he says messenger right and messenger when it says angel remember he's speaking of the earth right angel means messenger then after that after that see after them seven angels he saw another angel that's the one i'm talking about messenger from heaven coming down remember not that earthly angel now right see that i've been given the message over here but another mighty angel come down from heaven this one had a rainbow over him set his foot on the land and sweet see and swore by him that lives forever time shall be no more you'll find that in shalom 1964 listen this is the complete revelation of jesus christ i'm just skirting over some things here quickly amen seven thunders amen and now when those seven thunders brought forth their voices from the angel remember do you know who this is do you know who this is when them seven thunders uttered up their voices if the ministry of god mysteries of god is finished at that time what then that the almighty has regarded the lowest state of his people and have come to them think of it that time has run run out and he comes to them the church ages are over and then he comes to the to his people that are in a lower state amen think of it my brothers the stars falling into their constellation back yonder the angel coming john was set to wind up the old testament and to bring forth and to introduce the christ john was only there to introduce the christ he was not the christ but he was there to introduce the christ and when the seventh angel's message and ministry is over he introduces the fullness of the lord he introduces the messenger from heaven he introduces christ hallelujah the covenant angel covenant what covenant angel angel of the world angel of the covenant angel of the world hallelujah praise god hallelujah so the angel of the world is who is here now dealing with us and dealing with any who will receive him and believe his word amen think of it the stars fallen in their constellation john winding up the old testament and now a message will look wind up these loose ends and will again introduce none other but the messiah amen hallelujah he's telling you that his ministry is doing exactly what john the baptist ministry did it introduced christ as great amongst men the scripture says none was greater than john amongst all the preachers prophet ministers and so none greater than this messenger of this 20th century but then he says here but even that john was there to introduce the messiah christ and this message he says here hallelujah this message amen just before his coming will wind up the loose ends and will introduce the messiah amen again hallelujah so that's what he's doing and that's what i'm telling you about i am telling you that mighty angel that messenger from heaven that is going to speak to us and he's speaking to us is the lord jesus christ himself hallelujah o praise god amen now listen he says this angel this one he comes from heaven i'm preaching on messenger from heaven the other seven angels of them seven church ages they were only earthly messengers but this angel remember at that time all the message is finished all the message is finished at that time the seventh angel has winds up the entire thing the whole thing is wound up but this angel comes now not from the earth for he isn't a man from the earth as the messengers were to the seven church ages that is finished this angel brings to you the next announcement and you know angel means messenger hallelujah or praise god and this one comes not from earth but he comes from heaven messenger from heaven clawed in the pillar of light cloud with rainbow over his head amen rainbow is a covenant who was it then it was christ with one foot on the land on the sea and swore time will be no more so this messenger from heaven is the mighty angel and this mighty angel is the covenant angel and this covenant angel he said is none other than the lord jesus christ himself amen hallelujah where are we at sirs think of it remember remember what i say the other angels were messengers they were only men of the earth but these angels amen this angel that said to the angel of the church of laodicea to the angel of the church of ephesus see to them messengers of earth them were men messengers prophets and so forth but this angel says to these angels to the angel of such and the angel of such an angel of such amen praise god which is the lord jesus christ who hold the seven stars in his hands and then he turns around and says to the angel of the church of so and so he reveals the word but this one continuing the same quote as did not come from the earth he come down from heaven because the mystery is already finished at that time oh my glory god when this mystery is finished then the angel says time shall be no more that's when the seven thunders throw their voices out amen the seventh thunders come into force and begin to be uttered praise god hallelujah amen oh my what what if it is something to let us know or that's going to be revealed to let you know how to enter into that rapturing faith that rapture revelation will we run and jump over walls hey man is there something to fixing to happen these old mind vile bodies are going to be changed oh god can i live to see it oh lord it's so close that i'll see it it is this the generation oh my sirs my brethren what time is it we where are we at praise god is this the sign of the end 1962 that's brother branham speaking the voice of the mighty angel seven thunders came out of him uttering their voices hallelujah and then the holy spirit is telling me telling us that the voice of the seventh angel is still there all the ages they go out they go out you know like that parallel to each other but then officially the next one is is announced while the others are continuing another one is announced and it just goes right on out so the voice of the mighty angel is still there of the seventh angel is still there we the message is still here right but remember that he spoke through the seventh angel and he was the voice of god speaking to these church ages and to this last church age but now what comes out to the mighty angel seven thunders blasts and their voices come forth lord of god he's what this is not the quote from brother branham i'm just about to say and he said this is not the voice coming true brother branham anymore this is the voice of many waters through my bride hallelujah that's the voice now come to the bride the seven thunders in the bride he's thundering through her amen and there become the living voices to the word of god for this hour amen that's where the sinner will find himself my friends in real trouble praise god because to speak against this amen they commit them the unpardonable sin for not recognizing who is speaking and whose word it is and not recognizing the god of the hour praise god jesus christ the same yesterday and forever time shall be no more the seven thunders utter their voices hallelujah and now those thunders are where in the bride and when those in other words the seven thunders the voice of the mighty angel it's now speaking through his own bride his many member body and therefore as he said they hear thousands of voices voices voices but living voices amen brother branham said all like a great cataract he says like the thundering of many waters hallelujah why is the voices of the elected bride of jesus christ speaking with the voice of the thunder of the mighty angel of god the messenger from heaven speaking through her and giving god the glory the honor and the praise hallelujah oh praise god amen the pyramid then when that when he announces that that time is no more what happens when he does that oh my that then is when when the pyramid is kept by the seven thunders the seven thunders coming through the bride is the capping of all the ages right into the eternal church age amen you remember my pyramid message i'll tell you where this is found it's still in the sign of the answer so be good if you go back read that book he said remember the pyramid message it's the capstone the holy spirit in there capped off the individual and as i said to you last week or the week before this was not just speaking of the individual which uh we most of us including me understood understood it to be the individual man or woman like us uh adding virtue adding patients he was speaking of the stature of the perfect man the only perfect man we know of jesus christ himself amen that's the only perfect man and through the church ages them virtues are being added to the image so you can get a clearer picture of the entire image and each church is represented of virtue it exercise of virtue hallelujah and therefore at the end of the church ages now we have a clear picture of the fullness of the character of jesus christ in the world hallelujah praise god amen so this nonsense about you adding this and adding that you can't add nothing no man he said by taking thought can add one cubit to his statue you can't add it amen hallelujah glory to god the holy spirit does that work amen think of it all them things were kept off in that individual but it's the capstone the pyramid message the seventh one that's one now comes and when that one comes that is the love of god hallelujah what is the capstone love so what is the virtue and if you want to call it that that is going to be emphasized in the hearts of the believers in this age it's love and what is love love is the totality of all the rest of them virtues when you put them all together and you add them all together you make them into one it all goes right into love right because if a person has love they have all those things within them by the grace of god hallelujah amen oh praise god now he's got seven church ages seven mysteries sounded and now the headstone comes to cap off the church praise god amen what a picture now i'm going to say something here now that's going to be another little controversial something but then the holy spirit is showing up bringing all these things because there will know when it's time for them to know amen hallelujah do you remember if you can remember or pull out danielle and the revelation and show from scripture the way the gentile church is brought in and how she is going out let me give you the quotations and then i'll talk questions and answers 1954 questions and answers and then brother branham speak questions and answers on the seals again he speaks there and basically what he's saying just as it was with danielle in babylon this land of confusion danielle came he said to straighten things out and by vision god was able to reveal and use daniel to get the kingdom in order right he said that's how it came in he said he'll go out in the same way because king nebuchadnezzar so revered danielle then yet he could see that the spirit of god lived in daniel and so he changed danielle's name and called him belshazza now belshazza was actually his god amen and when i started to look at this oh my he so that nebuchadnezzar started to worship danielle as his god and the prophet is saying that was one of the signs of the going out of the gentile dispensation when they started to worship daniel as their god i want you to see here let me give you this quotation he saw the image and he believed danielle nebuchadnezzar that daniel was a holy man and he called daniel holy then he called him belshazza amen which was his idol that idol he made an image his god right oh danielle's but danielle's god now if probably the image you see of that of a holy man now some great statue they'll make and everybody wants to bow down to that statue right of some holy man oh my now remember while nebuchadnezzar was doing all of this and not that danielle didn't know but listen what he says here but notice during those times danielle was silent god didn't allow him to speak and daniel was silent and nebuchadnezzar was permitted to go ahead and build big idol and have millions of his people worshiping the idol right remember what i say oh i hope you are getting this danielle could do nothing danielle had to be silent see letting them go on because at that time now listen this they have to make their own choice amen i'm not making things up questions and answers book 1 1954. he says here you see everyone will have to make their own choice do you believe that amen in that day remember i'm saying it in the going out of the gentile dispensation there will be an image and everybody will have to bow before this image or do worship to that image though but let me do it be as holy as ever remember you are not to worship any image any image worship whatsoever my think of it bowing to an image remember i say to you again who that image was made to the image it was danielle it was the image of a man see then i want you to notice he says danielle is off the scene at that time in other words he's not there in the room when all this or stuff is discussed with the king and his people amen do you get what i mean when i say danielle is off the scene at that time do you get what he's saying here the prophet isn't on the scene anymore and that's the time they're going to start take this holy man and start to make an idol of him becomes your idol and start to make an image of him amen and ever whoever that would be at that would not bow to that image amen and if they don't they will be cut to pieces of some of us already getting cut to pieces crawl into the lion's den or they'll burn you in a fairy furnace or some other form of punishment but remember the gentle dispensation began like that with a pagan form of some form of religious worship with a persecution to make them bow and the bible predicts it will end the same way amen some holy man now friends could it be that the catholics while brother branham here was on earth and was ministering the word that even the pope and in the catholic digest i don't know where i could get a copy of that old one from back there where it says that man william branham sent from god the very ground that his feet touches and that he walks on is holy that is what they wrote in the catholic digest that's how much they respected him that's why even the catholic priests would come to him could it be just like he said they killed joan of arc kill all the prophets called him this patrick columba this one that one and long after they're gone and they realize what really that was he said they turn around and make an image to them and garnish their tombs and then call them great and give them a great name could that be that we are right now on the brink of that kind of thing happening watch let's now watch with spiritual ears watch with spiritual eyes and see whether the mother will do it or the daughters are going to do it but somewhere somehow people already start worshiping that idol let me repeat people are already worshipping that idol we recognize the job that the prophet of god has done and his message is doing amen but he is not my idol i said he is not my idol oh praise god the only image that i carry in my heart and in my head is the image of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh praise god i love the prophet i respect and reverence the prophet right now brother sister look i've been blessed hallelujah i've been blessed i've been in the house of brother um fandla and turner rangan says oh brother uh the brother branham said someone would come to my house and when they said these words give them this letter which he gave me later praise god another time i was not a place i'm there i went in the home of an older brother my wife and i in in phoenix arizona and he says oh brother he says you know um i have a jar here it's filled with stones that brother branham himself selected when he's up in the mountains he selected those stones and and put them in a jar and the proper the man who was his guide i took care of him until the day he died and he left me this and his clothing and so on and he says what i want you to do is just shut your eyes take your hands put it in the jar and grab as many stones as you can grab a hold of and take that well i didn't make a particular effort to grab a whole lot but well some people would have but i just put my hand and grabbed a normal my hand full which is a small hand and i filled them in a little bottle of that size which i have at home now if i were to start taking all these little things that that might have been given or i collected or told and start making up a magazine and building up us this and that and the other that that's about me but i hide those things i don't want it about me and the first thing is the first time i mentioned that to one person they take it and spread it out and the devil used that thing to make it sound like you're trying to make yourself into something so i know enough to shut down right shut down and let the holy spirit have his way i wouldn't even tell you about others but just leave that alone praise god i just want you to see remember brothers back to the word here remember that god amen sent an elijah hallelujah and this mighty elijah god will send to us too amen and elijah delivered the people at that time out of the hands of paganism are you with me here or i'm just rambling on by myself no i want you to listen close and receive this praise the lord hallelujah remember out of the hands of paganism and john had to do the same things you see john when he seen jesus immediately he announced i must decrease that he might increase of course those who had john as their idols they continue following john are you following what i'm saying and the ones who could look away and see jesus they followed jesus the bible said and they followed john no more but they followed after jesus [Applause] praise god hallelujah that doesn't mean that disrespected john they didn't want to hear what john said but they knew that the emphasis was now christ the living word the word made flesh amen yes praise god you see john started preaching but at that time he was making himself known to the people just before the coming of the lord oh my right at the end before the manifestation and he stops there in that thought now we find out what elijah must mean to this church and this church age amen elijah after he had given his prophecy he had not he did not have to die he was translated into heaven type of the church and so on church will go in the rapture i believe the great elijah that great one that's to come will be the anointed elijah prophesied for the last day amen i think he will be the angel messenger of the last church age brother branham speaking amen hallelujah see praise god amen and when he comes it comes to a dejected degraded people as the church will be at that time amen so he will come you'll find that in the leodysian church age now he's speaking again remember always god in simplicity god always hides and works in simplicity oh my another place he says look god comes so simple so that if you're not really watching it'll pass right in front of you and you won't even recognize it you won't even see it you won't know what it is hallelujah people want to be comforted by crowds oh there's a big crowd over there all of them believe it so you believe no this thing has come down to the horned out edge the holdout razor edge of the pyramid where it's an individual affair between you and god you know what i'm what i'm trying to tell you not even your pastor can't help you right we've gone past you know we came through those days where the pastor had to kind of cultivate you like tomato plants no i'm telling you that oh the pastor got to come to run over here visiting 200 people 300 go to their house visit as well and if the pastor doesn't visit you you you're with them well you know he didn't call me for the past three weeks all of a sudden you shrink you're shriveled right you see we seeing it clearly now but it's gone away from that where god even bring the shepherd to a point where they have to survive on me they got to eat on me the bread of life hallelujah hallelujah it's not my responsibility to save you not my responsibility to convince you convert you or anything other nature we're not bringing in people here to be members of this church by by persuasion or anything of that nature if the holy spirit can't show you and reveal these things to you my brother i have nothing to do with it if there's even one two or three left in here we'll stand by the word until the crown of god began hallelujah i can't help but tell what i see and hear what the spirit of god reveals through the word of god amen he said think of it remember if you're raising potatoes keep raising them oh but if you are soldiers don't god do no violence you got the word not because now the truth began to reveal to you you're going to run out with it and start chopping chopping and chopping off heads and everything else right and say oh man you guys don't know what you're talking about you're wrong you're off the work no love grace you can listen and say oh praise god amen praise the lord hallelujah amen because it's like an adult talking to a child i know where the child is i'm not going to rebuke the child for not knowing what i know because they have to grow amen and they have to come up praise the lord hallelujah let's turn all those things off when we come in here amen now remember that always learn how to condescend so that you can walk in the spirit of love and grace and patience praise the lord say brother simon you're dealing with pentecostal preachers you're dealing with all kinds yes i deal with all kinds right because that's what the grace of god does doesn't mean that you compromise doesn't mean that you let down the no doesn't mean i know where you're at so i can talk with you amen i can deal with you i understand where you're at and i know exactly what god wants me to say amen praise god don't you tremble now go ahead continue on or you soldiers continue amen hallelujah you say shall we do this shall we do that shall we quit doing this should we stop doing that hallelujah oh no just go on the way you are and if you are praising potatoes raise them if you are soldiers don't do no violence right do this do that whatever you do just continue on as you are that's the way that hour of the message because the messenger knows he was only to introduce that person he was there only to introduce that person hallelujah that one who is in your midst you don't see him now see things are going on right now that you don't know nothing about there is something going to happen and then suddenly he'll be here hallelujah i won't even tell you but you know those quotes where he says do you know that there are images and people passing through this room right now over here he's saying he said the one that is in your midst you don't see him you don't even see him hallelujah they are of this message the messenger is to introduce that person and knows he is here praise god one that is in your very midst but you can't see him with these eyes but he said this thing's passing through the room you can't see but when it's time for you to see you're going to see you're going to know what it's going to be the 40 days you know before the rapture take off your eyes lighten and you start to see but you are going to see and you're going to know i my time now listen what brother branham said behold he is here there is the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world and my time is up now questions and answers on the seals 1963 my time is now up now he introduces to the lamb of god then he says my time is up now i continue i have introduced you to him and so i must now decrease i must go off the sea now and he will take it over from here messenger from heaven i said the messenger from heaven the lord himself descend with a shout voice of the archangel the trump of god and god himself begins to lead his own people amen speaking into their hearts the spirit of god the pair of fire leading the children of god to cross right over this gap and right into the capstone hallelujah amen oh my he says yes i know them things are going on and you know nothing about them hallelujah but you'll see he'll be here amen and you'll know him praise god amen i must decrease he's repeating it in a message called influence amen so that he might increase for god can't have two of us on the earth at the same time one has the message and you know i am saying i must decrease he is now the messenger hallelujah messenger to the eternal church age jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah praise god amen i've been up to this time the messenger but now he takes my place as elisha when elisha went up throw back his robe to elisha now elijah's ministry was finished elisha must take up where he left off so i say he must increase that i might decrease you see changed it around now when you caught the revelation he must increase that i might decrease because in your eyes you start seeing jesus you start seeing jesus hallelujah and he decreases do you respect him you love him and you all of that you realize his position his placing his work his office amen his reward but you realize who the one you love and serve and waited for with all your heart is here with you and his body standing by your side lord of god i say it's heaven time now jamaican will say it's party time now but a christian you say it's heaven time now oh praise god time for rejoicing walk in the light as he is in the light amen praise god you realize he says that is in the book the message called influence he said jesus calling out the elect amen hallelujah john was only used to call out the elect and giving them over or pointing them to christ when he come swapped his church and said i must decrease amen he must increase because i am just a voice right i was crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the word of the lord jesus comes the same way gets elected ready to hear the voice of god that's what the prophetic sign came to do voice of the sign 1964 praise god if you're spiritual you'll catch what i am saying may god open up your understanding oh how long this has been may he open up your understanding praise god oh my now i've told many of you a priestess in the church here a little bit but now i found where brother branham is saying it in the word because it's time for me to find it now for remember what i'm telling you now for 400 years israel was without a prophet without a prophet you remember i told you about um the tunnel period that between the ages the time of malachi and matthew is a period of 400 years according to quality theologians whatever um it's a period of 400 years it is called the tunnel period it is called an initial dark ages for israel and they call it dark ages for israel there was no prophet there's no visions being given or received no light that's why when jesus come he said the people who had sat in darkness and now can have a great light you see because for that 400 years they were walking in total darkness spiritually there was none and during that time the only thing they were holding on to is the promise of elijah from eight hundred years before that a virgin will conceive on their son right and he will be the messiah but during this 400 years while they were waiting for the messiah to come that's similar to during this period brother branham has gone to rest and we're waiting for jesus to come and the rapture to take place all of a sudden men start to uh the sense the coming of the messiah but when they sense it they start thinking that maybe why i sense it maybe i am here so you had men you're not going to read that in the bible but if you go back in the histories you go back and read certain things you'll find that men like sadius men like the maccabees were raising up and thinking that they were the messiahs and that they would be the deliverers of israel but a lot of them were going with wars against the romans and the greeks and the different ones of that time and they failed with what they were doing because god didn't say delivered by a general he said a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and instead so a baby was born not a general right he was the general but born in the form of a baby now i'm saying that to say the same thing has happened and is happening during this time between brother branham's departure and the rapture coming of christ i remember i say rapture coming of christ right between this period of time no prophet none of that what happens men start to raise up and think maybe they are the messenger maybe they are the one that got the word maybe there the deliverer and just like you had tadius and maccabeas and judas and different ones judas the hammer wasn't you know like that coming up during that time we have this one come up with this this will come up with the other thing lead off a bunch of people run after them run after them instead of keeping their eyes on the word of god is that right keep your eyes on the word of god and that means that even if and god from bit this is not going to happen maybe maybe 25 30 years from now but i am not here i want you to keep looking at the world keep your eyes on the world remember you're not here following me is that right you know that praise the lord i know a lot of people think that brother simon always appears like he's not concerned about the people he's not concerned or run after there run over there chase after no it's not that you have to learn that this thing has now come to the stage where it's individual you're going to stand or fall on your own faith you're not going in with pastor's faith not my brother not my sister not the deacon not the trustee not nobody gonna take you in you've got to go in by yourself by revelation through the word of god hallelujah praise god you think my standing up here and say your pride that doesn't turn you into bride but that makes the preacher popular because people love to hear that preacher preaches to preach to all the people and give them the assumption that they are all in the bride because they're in the message and you're not in the bride because you're in the net of the message hallelujah the holy spirit is now sorting things out is that right and all god's gifts are finding their appropriate places but for the spirit of judas the bible said but there was no place found for him and he went out nobody didn't have to tell him to leave the church or get out or do this nobody didn't have to catch him doing nothing wrong the bible says he went out and hanged his own self and a lot of believers will hang their own selves by their own actions their own thoughts their own deeds and whatever they are going to be doing at this time oh my praise god hallelujah brother sister i want to thank god that during this period of time the holy spirit has opened our eyes no i got 15 minutes more are you going to give me that 15 minutes praise god i'm going to take it anyhow i don't see anybody falling asleep anyway are you falling asleep brad amen praise god god bless you sister sheila amen praise the lord amen hallelujah praise god now the messengers of the seven church ages came to the church ages but this messenger from heaven doesn't come to the church ages for the bride has already been called and is being called out of the church ages this messenger from heaven comes to the bride he comes to his wife the head now comes to settle on the body the cap comes to settle on the pyramid the mighty one now comes to call them out hallelujah and these seven messengers that repeat were men of earth and of time but the messenger from heaven is the lord himself from heaven the eternal one coming to eternal beings that were trapped in time to take them back to where they come from thank god brother branham says all little jew drops lord of god shine all around us but day and by night jesus the light of the world amen the little jew drops he said why are you happy to drop why are you shivering shaking why why you like that he said because the s-u-n for us is the s-o-n it's pulling me right back up where i come from and i feel the pull of the son of god by the revelation of the word pulling me back into his divine presence glory to god where i come from i come from god and i go to god i come from eternity and going back to eternity this world is not our home we're just a passing through and all our treasures are led up beyond the blue amen the angels i feel them beckoning me come up hither come up hither oh come into another dimension enter into the break out into the prison the spirit of the living god amen glory to god you talk about prison break oh my goodness glory to god they can't catch me back anymore hallelujah amen i've told this and i tell it again while in school while in college or university praise god the funny thing about this i was preparing this message yesterday and in the middle of preparing this message yesterday my youngest brother calls me from new york he said oh john i don't know i was reading the word and i caught the revelation i caught the revelation you know what i said what is it he said you know i am seeing now that now is not about the prophet but this angel that came down this mighty angel that's the one brother branham did his work i said is that right oh praise god he said oh he said i'm telling you i don't know what's happening but i'm just seeing it here i said well god bless you i said that is the truth that's the word of god i didn't tell him what i was going to preach on or what i was going to say i don't want to give no way nothing to the devil or give me give the devil any hint of anything i just let him go on talking but i was rejoicing god confirming to me that's what you need to say amen praise god because here's somebody doesn't even know amen and calls you up and begins telling you so here is this yeah the young man and sister farida the young man sees he sees somebody that he loves in the classes sees somebody that he loves brother mike did you see anybody anyway let's not get personal now i'm forgetting myself and start to get personal but then what he does he writes a note and he pass it under the desk give it to a friend pass it to another friend and pass it to another messenger and pass it to another messenger until it gets to her and then she reads the message and when she reads the message maybe she'll look around and give him a little glance or something and you know be not satisfied with just a glance and keep sending messages but then after a while he get a message that give him such assurance amen that both of them are feeling the same way about one another and when that happens he stops sending any messages by any messenger now he's going to approach her himself he's going to talk to her is going to tell her what is in heart himself praise god and nobody else needs to be there because this is an individual private rendezvous a private get-together an invisible union praise god a oneness when they come together with the word of the living god i'm telling you about jesus christ and the bride amen you seven messengers through seven church ages but the rs come when the messenger from heaven praise god you can take this and run with it the boss's son hallelujah has come on the scene to talk to us himself and open up his word the author to reveal what he was saying in the letter amen praise god i was reminded by a believer last week oh brother you could have thrown in that part where you know the husband and the wife and when the husband writes a letter amen and the wife reads that she don't have to read the writing that's part of it she reads between the lines is that right and that's what we are talking about the unwritten word reading between the lines and recognizing what god is saying to us praise god five minutes more and i'm on the road praise the lord hallelujah amen now he says remember it was in malachi 3 that he said i will send my messenger before my face to prepare the people look john came and there was no selfishness in john john didn't take any glory or try to promote himself right see amen there even there the people tried to call him the messiah but he said i am not even worthy to lose his shoes but as soon as jesus appeared the voice said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and immediately john said i must increase so that he i must decrease so that he might increase you see at that time john presented the church to christ amen and we are told in these last days that is going and will be repeated again you'll find that in the message called voice of the sign 1964. for there is going to be a message come forth in this day that will again introduce the messiah to the people in such a way they'll be down founded like they did back then amen oh my you know what it means they'll even want to call them that that maybe that's the christ that's the messiah that's what it is you see but remember it's still the same god i hope this gets true to you it's still the same god but all he is doing he takes a veil puts it on then he takes on another veil and he puts that on then he puts on another veil but always remember not the veil but it's the same god god showing himself through these various veils now some people are hung up on the veil and they're looking at the veil but we are looking to jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he did it through the reformers did it through all of them until this day we have come to amen praise god hallelujah amen i'm going to end it here by the grace of god not i'm not completed the rest you can do that i'm not going to do your work for you you go and praise god search the word you can check in like i said sign of the end you can go for it and check in the questions answers uh in the seals you can go into the shalom book search it all out it's in there and god will surely bless you praise the lord god bless you all amen this messenger from heaven is jesus christ the lord himself come to speak to us and share with us his word and we just need the unwritten word and his voice is now speaking through us the seven thunders are now the living voices of the living god sundering out forming out the word bringing it forth for his glory and honor through us and that is why they're not going to respect it they're not going to understand it they will literally reject it but this is coming to the holdout edge right down into the deep calling to the deep and whatever is deep down in you god's spirit is discernable search and see whether you can see what god is trying to tell you now amen some people might initially doubt we don't know but then later on maybe god will break upon them what is inside of this world but for right now i can see clearly now because all the doubts are gone all the rain is gone everything is passed away and the world is growing and making itself manifest i'm standing in front of you here i don't have nothing prepared for next week i have no liturgy or no lenten nothing when i go from here then the holy spirit may give me something right sometimes while i'm in the middle of speaking to you bringing one message then he'll give me something that i can start working on and building on for the next week i don't know but right now you pray for me and i pray for you that god will bring his word and speak to us and build us up in the most holy faith and let us manifest cardinal virtue that is now don't emphasize these ones on the bottom we still pay attention to them but if we ask god to fill us with his love when we recognize because his grace and mercy is what brought us through can we sing that brother oh praise the lord sister can we sing that his grace and murder i live in this moment i live in this because of you [Music] i just want to thank you lord i want to and praise you too your grace and mercy [Applause] has broken me through hallelujah oh brother sister if you realize the joy we experienced today and every day walking in this liberty and this grace that god has given to us we walk in it and that gives us the ability to love one another not because we read it in the bible but the pulsation of the holy spirit working through the life of the believer causes us to love one another like we have never done before praise god may god bless our brother as he leads us here and close out our service we come together again next week in the house of god pray for the services on wednesday nights is that right praise the lord uh someone sent an email about the nikolaitians and stuff like that brother danny answered it but the reason you see i'm just taking the word and bringing the word i'm not doing specific studies on balaam-ism a specific study nickelodeonism another study on romanism and other stuff no that's not what i'm doing i'm doing an overview of the seven church ages and in so doing you touch on all these various doctrines right but only to a certain depth and you leave that alone because we are here to go into the study of the mind of god under the person of jesus christ and to him be glory honor and praise god bless you god bless you brother amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] this is [Music] you know [Music] all expecting me i got i know [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh lord you know i [Music] [Music] that they're not working downstairs he's the ones upstairs but you are dismissed amen [Music] this and i can't feel it [Music] so [Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you
