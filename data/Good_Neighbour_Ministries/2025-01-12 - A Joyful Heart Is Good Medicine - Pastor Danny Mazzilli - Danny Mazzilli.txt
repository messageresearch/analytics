amen God bless you Saints thank you singers musicians um I'm very uh thankful to have a bass player back on the stage praise God just uh you know being a bass player myself you know not a great one but um just uh it adds it adds that atmosphere amen and I appreciate it and uh I certainly enjoy it amen praise God so um just bear with me here for a quick second and um I'm just gonna because I just need to identify [Music] here multiple extend duplicate okay there we go praise God amen glory to God it's good to be in the house of the Lord this this morning we are um we are going to continue where we uh sort of left off last week by the grace of God Amen um we're going to be looking at the joy of the Lord today I believe we we will probably um complete it today let's see what happens uh Lord willing um but uh for now I just want to welcome everybody into the house of the Lord Happy New Year to those that uh maybe are just coming for the first time this year we certainly appreciate seeing you all brother Daniel sister sarin and uh a few others there God bless you brother Leon amen praise God it's good to have everybody in the house of the Lord this morning how many had a good week how many were challenged by the joy of the Lord being your strength amen amen it comes with uh you know part of the challenge um of being a son or a daughter of God and experiencing the joy of the Lord is experiencing the trials that come with it amen because because um that's one thing that's one aspect that that you've come into contact with the Living God and the true joy of the Lord is going to be when he comes into you overcomes the situations that you face each and every day of your life and then you can really say I know the joy of the Lord amen like the scripture that we read last week from first Peter it said who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last days okay where unto ye greatly Rejoice because you've received the message you receive the word of the Lord you greatly Rejoice but uh but though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith be much more precious than gold and so God knows what you need in order to bring out the things that you need to be set free from so that you can experience the true joy of the Lord amen praise God so I trust that you overcame and that you are now looking forward to the next part amen before we do that who has a prayer requests we want to remember um every hand that's lifted up to the Lord this morning I've got two up in the air praise God Amen father we're so grateful this morning Lord that we can receive your word once again again Lord truly it is a joy that your word be placed within us Lord to give us the overcoming power and the ability to know that greater is he that is in us than he that is in this world to overcome Lord this is the greatest joy for the Sons and Daughters of God lord to know that you are with us that you will interpret the word to us this morning that you will meet every uplifted hand request in the hearts of your people Lord that is why we come into the house of the Lord because we've come into contact with you the Living God who's aware of our needs and Lord that that uh you will speak to us this morning you'll discern our very needs you know exactly what we all need so you can do that in and in such a way you can speak to every single one of us through one sermon and that's what makes you God and so we appreciate all that you're doing now let your spirit ride the words that I will speak may your spirit anoint the word into the hearts of your people Lord grant it this morning we give you praise Glory and Honor in Jesus name am praise God let's go to um first of all um I want us to uh listen to a song and and even participate let's let's get that uh and give us some good volume and uh we can all clap together and um sing this song it's uh it's it's a wonderful song that'll just get us right into the atmosphere amen a merry heart praise God give us some volume it's an easy simple song I found this online this week and I thought you know what it's kind of funny and kind of a blessing too amen praise God this a family here that they're called soulseekers you're happy you're and if you're healthy of course you are healthy [Music] a merry heart do good like a like a medicine is a merry heart a broken Spirit Dr but a mer heart is the joy of the all right let's sing it together a mer heart a medicine like a medicine is a mer heart a broken Spirit drth the B but a merry heart is the joy of the Lord heart is the [Music] joy amen praise God let's read our scripture Proverbs 17:22 it says a merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken Spirit dth the bones amen praise God you may be seated when we look at um you know the word Mary if you go back into the old uh Testament you look up this you know the the meaning of it it wasn't exactly um like the original uh word you know the way that that it that it was defined as today like joyful and you know sometimes uh happy and hilarious or whatever um uh but it actually meant blessed peaceful Pleasant it was expressing Joy rather than uh you know spiritual Joy rather than Earthly Joy you know like happiness happiness you can get happiness from new things you get a new car you're happy for a couple of weeks you're excited you can't wait to see it in the morning you get in there you're looking at everything you know you feel happy oh you got a nice reliable car or you get a new house or you get new clothes and makes you look slimmer makes you look you know and you're happy temporarily and you know these are temporary that's temporary Joy that's temporary happiness but then there's the joy of the Lord which is something that is that is inner it's something that even when you're going through hard times or you're going through serious Temptation or trial you've still got the anchor of the lord inside of you to know that he's got your future got your back he's got you covered regardless of the circumstances it's irrelevant he's got you covered amen praise God and so um you know let's go to the next here brother brandham speaking here he says you know we read this quote last week we're going to other places for pleasure instead of coming to the house of the Lord for pleasure you're looking outside for for real Joy there's no real Joy outside of Christ amen the house of the Lord is the joy of the Lord and listen the joy of the Lord is the joy of his people he rejoices when we Rejoice he rejoices when we receive his word when we when we make him our absolute when we trust him in everything that we're facing regardless of how it might appear amen he wants you to come to church and worship him and be happy and satis FES giving praise and honor and glory and wisdom and might and the power to God you're not giving the power to your ability your your your own strength you're giving him the glory for the power and the overcoming power in your life amen he wants you to do that amen praise God let's look at the next scripture in Proverbs 1513 I want you to notice here he says a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance you know when you're when you're expressing you know real inner Joy your countenance cannot be always you know frowning and like you know you you come you know what I mean you come around somebody and and and you you're just picking up right off of them that they're not really it's not that they're that they're not happy with you it's that they're not satisfied with themselves there's there's something on the inside and their countenance expresses it but the S but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken and that's why the scripture says you know you know a merry heart um you know gives us uh you know the joy but a broken Spirit it dries up the bones it actually you got to be careful that you don't get into a negative uh you know a negative atmosphere and countenance and attitude you want to get away from all of that the heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness we want to feed on the word of God we want to understand by the word not by the world we're not interested in knowing you know that you know oh well I'm depressed so I need to go see a counselor you need to go see Christ he's the counselor the Mighty God the Prince of Peace the Everlasting father amen he'll he'll do for you what no counselor can do in this earth in this time and in this season amen praise God all the days of The Afflicted are evil but he that is of a merry heart have a continual Feast the word will never stop blessing you when you come into that relationship with the Lord you've taken him as your absolute you'll have a continual Feast on the word of God Amen better is a little with the fear of the Lord than great treasures and trouble therewith amen praise God you know Solomon he had a he had a revelation because you know all these most of these Proverbs they're they're written by Solomon a lot of them look at the next uh you know the next scripture here he says here in Proverbs 17 verse one better is a dry morsel and quietness therein therewith than a house full of sacrifices with Strife now you need to understand when when Solomon was writing these things first you need to understand who Solomon was Solomon was one of if not the richest you know in his time the richest man on earth the richest king on Earth my God he had he had 700 wives with 300 more in the in in in the uh you know as concubines in the waiting so a thousand wives he had so many children being born to him every year you couldn't even count them can you imagine he had more wealth than you could possibly imagine his wealth was greater than than you know Apple Microsoft Amazon and and Tesla put together in what they make in a year he had more than that just coming in probably on a monthly basis he had Cities of Gold old can you imagine he had wives that could go shopping a thousand of them every day and he'd never run out of money we got one wife we got to say honey go [Applause] easy but you can you imagine so here Solomon had he had some wisdom in him when he when he would say better is a dry morsel in other words I'd rather just you know have just enough and in a nice quiet home without you know you go home and and you know right away you know a man he comes home from work and you know maybe the wife's been at home all day and you know she's been having a rough day with the kids and right away boy look out you deal with them now I've had to deal with them all day you know and all of a sudden there goes the fiery trial right you know the Peace of Mind amen but you know we need to understand that truly uh peace and and and Joy doesn't come from the things of the world because Solomon made it very clear here many many times you know through many of his Proverbs you know uh we we need to see that that true Joy will only come when the Lord places it in you because you have surrendered to him amen you've given your your life over to the Lord Jesus Christ amen and you're trusting him in everything amen praise God let's go to the next scripture here we're going to look at a few things in Ezekiel chapter 36 verse 24- 26 now the the thought here is we need to recognize that a joyful heart so there's something about your heart there's something that's where God places himself that's where he places his word he places the things that that that you can ponder on and you can feed on and you can you know rejoice in and you need to protect your heart too at the same time but he says here not to worry you come out of this world with all kinds of baggage you know you've got all you oh brother Danny you don't understand the things that I've got to deal with the the background that I come out of you know the the the family I had an abusive father an abusive mother you know I I come from a broken family and and my heart's been ripped apart it's been torn up but here in Ezekiel he says for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries now we know this is talking about Israel but you are a type of Israel the church is a type of Israel so anything you read in the Old Testament where God is speaking directly to Israel he's also that's him speaking to his wife the bride the true church the Gentile Church of this day and we were all heathens amen every single one of us and he says I'll gather you out of all the countries out of all the denominations out of all the the teachings you know all the different backgrounds that you've come out of and will'll bring you into your own land a place where you can know that this is not somebody else's land this is the land I've given you this is the life I've given you this is the blessings and the joy that I've given you this is not something you've got to work for this is not something that you deserve you didn't work it up no I'm giving it to you this is this is what's so amazing that you know that that when when I came to the Lord 30 years ago I realized my God I didn't deserve any of this but he gave it freely because he knew that he had to call you and place you and position you where he needed you and so he says here um I'll gather you bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean listen when God purges you of your sin it never happened in the first place that's true justification he went to the Cross once amen for for all amen all you got to do is accept it receive it and the water of the word cleanses you washes you amen from all he says then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart will I give you and a new spirit will I put in you aren't you glad to know that you don't you don't have to rely upon you know all the broken heart experiences of your past you don't need to carry them anymore because he says I'll going to give you a brand new heart I'm going to place a a heart of Flesh in you go to the next slide here he says he says for and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a an heart of Flesh imagine so he's actually going to restore your heart you think oh there's no way I can I can let that trauma that took place in my life no you you no you can't but he can he can replace it he can replace it with a brand new heart he can take it out of you listen until you experience it you'll you'll understand what I'm saying because I remember when I was under a condition that I thought my heart would explode from the drug addiction I thought I would I'd probably die from a heart attack because of all the drugs I was going to do I thought I I must have cut years off of my life because of the condition that I that I put my my body through and the and the and the anxiety and the you know when when you're when you're on on on drugs you know when you're coming down from those drugs you go through serious anxiety and and your heart is just pounding like crazy and you're wondering my God is you know am I going to make it you know and and God God shows that he can remove all of that give you a brand new heart give you a brand new start take out that Spirit of condemnation that's all over your life the spirit that that constantly torments you and and and keeps you bound into a certain condition amen he says a new heart and a new spirit the new spirit is the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth according to the word of God Amen and it's the truth that set you free amen amen praise God hallelujah oh glory to God and ye shall dwell in your land uh amen and I'll cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and I will be your God Amen praise God aren't you glad that he is doing all of this amen you didn't there's nothing you have to do except receive it and accept it and humble yourself and allow the Holy Spirit to deal with your life amen praise God glory to God Amen but you know in order for you to come truly to come into this Joy listen we're not talking about put on Joy here we don't need put on Joy we don't need we don't need uh you know uh psychology Joy you know oh you need to go and and and and sit in front of the mirror and you need to just look at yourself and you need to say to yourself I am happy I am happy I am happy I am like a robot what the heck is that it's when you do that by Revelation change is everything now you're talking to yourself and you're saying you're a Son of God you're a child of the king you didn't deserve this but God gave it to you you can receive it you can have it you just need to accept it you need to walk it you need to you know assemble yourself under a Ministry where you're going to receive the pure word of God Amen you're going to you're going to recognize that the that the word is a reality in your life and especially especially in this day and in this hour you know we can talk about the joy of the Lord but let me tell you what the true joy of the Lord is it's when you receive the Holy Ghost and have the ability to recognize the message that God is bringing in your day amen that's calling you out of the certain condition that you're under because God has a portion of the word that he wants you to manifest and overcome in this day am amen amen and the message of this hour is so important you will not nobody will truly experience the true joy of the Lord a brand new spirit unless they receive the word for their day that's the only way you're going to know the true joy of the Lord so if you're wondering why you keep going over this and you you know you keep doing this and and yet you're still miserable you wake you don't want to wake up in the morning it's because you haven't fully surrendered to the purpose of God in your life amen he's personal right now we're you know we could talk about the message of the hour and we know that listen the opening of The Seven Seals this is something that is that is take that that that that has taken place and you've got people now because remember it's not going to be denomination thinking and and teaching that's going to truly bring you into the joy of the Lord I can read all these scriptures but you it's the Revelation behind the scripture that's coming directly into your heart that's becoming alive and bringing it into the current day that you're living in that makes it live through your life until there's a manifestation of the word through your life it's just word the spirit has to give life and so you've got people that you know within the confines of our message okay which is you know because remember the the word of God is in progression when Luther broke away from the Catholic church God was progressing the word he justification then it went to Wesley sanctification then it went to uh uh the Pentecostals and God sent a prophet to the Pentecostal age amen and so that they could so that they could uh come back to the word the original truth because restoration requires us to go back to the original truth of God's word that's why there's so much confusion out there they still don't even know about the fact that God is one they want to put him into a trinity and they want to explain it by their by their by their understanding while it's three in one three persons in one the Holy Ghost is the power of God Jesus was the son of God and God is the father and they don't realize that it was just God you know changing his his his body changing his his his position from Elohim the self-existent one coming down to join with humans amen and now in this hour to be inside of humans this is the greatest thing that people are are are are confused about and that's why they're rejecting this word amen it's not because they're rejecting you it's because they're rejecting the message that you represent some will say that the seals are not open then you got some that say the seals are open then you got some that are saying Oh but you got to understand all the seals you got to study it you got to you got to know every horse rider you need to understand the history of the church and this and that they're trying to do it by intellectualism and then you got ones say oh no no it's the life it's all about the life you got to live the life if you're not living the life you can't live a perfect life you you try to say that you try to tell me that you can be perfect and live this this word to Perfection you're going to leave here today and by the end of the day you'll have already made a mistake you don't need to actually do it you just need to think it hallelujah praise God so don't be looking for Perfection when Jesus was on the earth in his first coming notice how he went to those that were in need he didn't go to the righteous he went to those that were sick and needed a physician amen amen he went to those that you would look he goes to a a a simple fisherman and calls him and says you're going to fish for men now he was a hot-tempered Peter he goes to a tax collector who was all he would think about is money money money money I got to collect money every time I collect 10 cents I get one for me all that was on his mind was money but Jesus says follow me and he instantly dropped what he was doing and followed him and then he goes to see a woman at the well oh who was a prostitute a lot of people in this message they want to take marriage and divorce and they want to cut through people's lives right away they want to oh yeah yeah oh married more than yeah oh okay okay they they got no Revelation Jesus came to the woman at the well and she had representation and yet all the priests and all the ones that were so righteous that followed the letter to the you know the letter to a tea and and could quote the scriptures and quote brother brandham and and quote all these things yet they had no character for the Bride of Jesus Christ to be the one that he was going to dwell in in this hour so that he could rule in your life and in this world people got confused between the message and the messenger yes let's read the quote here amen amen listen from the from the message birth pains oh word Believers give into my message hear me not my message amen but his message that he firmly declares to be the truth you've got to choose from somewhere you can't sit still after this you've got to make your choice amen don't pay any attention to the messenger is that is that brother brandham saying that don't pay any attention to the messenger look at the message it is congregation says amen that's what it is see it isn't that don't notice the the the little uh baldheaded you know person cuz it's just it's just a human being all and we're just all the same but watch what's happening that's what declares it I was taken go to the next slide he says now I know people say all kinds of things we know that that's lot that a lot of it's not right oh brother brandham was God you only got to say exactly what he said he never made a single mistake they only want to quote exactly they don't want to say anything else if the prophet never said it and you don't say it exactly the way he said it he's saying don't look at me he says it's not right he says I can't answer for what other any man says I got to answer for what I say I can only say whether it's truth or not and I'm the one has to be responsible for it not what somebody else says I can't judge no one I wasn't sent to judge but to preach the message so we need to recognize that Jesus Christ has always been the message voice all the way through right from Genesis all the way down to Revelations and we need to realized that the message has never sto it didn't stop when brother brandham went off the scene no no brother Bram says I must decrease so that he can increase amen he came to introduce us to the mighty Angel himself in 1963 yes sir and when the mighty angel came on the scene he was now coming to take a bride to possess a body that he could have full preeminence in so that he could live this word and Manifest this word and until you come to a place where you realize amen that this has happened and that now the five-fold ministry is where we receive instruction by the word of God being preached amen Faith cometh by hearing hearing what the word amen until we come into that we can't even experience the true joy of the Lord oh Saints amen let us not forget what God is doing in our day why it is that we are different amen we're different because he came and said on that day ye shall know that I am in you you and me and I and you he gave us a revelation that that this would be the day where now he would not only just take a body to go to Calvary now he would take a body to go in the rapture amen amen praise God he was going to come and take human vessels he was not coming to perfect humans there's nobody perfect in this place but it's a revelation brother Braham says the Rapture is a revelation and if the Revelation is in your heart you need to guard that Revelation don't let the enemy come and steal your joy what is your joy it's the word it's the Revelation it's what God is doing in this hour don't let them steal it away from you even within the confines of this message listen there's people that are falling away you know why they're falling away is because they can't believe that you are actually saying that he's in you yes that's what's that's what's blowing the people's minds that they can't understand Oh you mean God is is now coming to a to a church a small group of people on the Earth that are going to be possessed of The Same Spirit and he's going to come in to flaw human beings yes amen but he's going to give you a brand new heart he's going to give you a brand new spirit and he's going to take absolute control in your life so that you will manifest him and no longer manifest the life that you've been living up until now amenes greatest Miracle amen glory to God hallelujah recognize in your day not by psychology not by man's teachings but by the revelation of the opening of the word of God in this day amen amen The Book of Revelations is so misunderstood why because it has to be revealed it has to be revealed personally amen this is not a world wide calling this is god listen the Rapture for example people think that listen Jesus didn't come to everybody globally you know that the the churches out there you know what they're waiting for they're all waiting for one day they're going to the skies are going to open up they're going to receive a a an alert on their phone look up Jesus is coming and they're looking for a worldwide Revival that the Lord is going to come all at the same time and the whole world and all the Christians are all just going to float up into the air to towards the Lord that's not what's going to happen Saints the second coming of the Lord has already taken place amen and that's why they'll say wait a minute you're cuckoo what do you mean he's already come he's already come and he's in me amen he's manifesting his word through my life I'm only telling you what he shows me what what I see in the word when I when I when I talk to somebody about baptism I speak by the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost that's in me can never go against the word so I'm going to tell you have you been baptized and you say to me I got baptized as a baby the scripture says he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved so if you've got representation in you as a son or a daughter of God then you cannot deny the word you're going to see that you're going to say what just like the unic when Philip was explaining to him about baptism the unic says there's a pool of water right away he understood that the the see the Revelation instantly brought a manifestation and that's how you'll know if it's a reality to you somebody will tell you about the word somebody will speak to you about baptism about receiving the Holy Ghost and then you'll just you know and if and if it doesn't have a representation and it doesn't bring forth an immediate response when God does it amen then you know there's something missing there's no way somebody baptized as a baby can read that scripture he that believeth how does a baby believe he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that says that Jesus Christ Has Come In the Flesh he has the spirit of Christ amen but the one that says no I don't believe it the scripture says that is the spirit of antichrist that wants to deny the word of God so how can you have real Joy how can you have a a a a a merry heart when you don't even know what you believe amen you will bring forth an instant manifestation when the word strikes your soul and it lights up inside of your heart amen praise God hallelujah that's the reality amen so we don't want to mix up the messenger with the message is that clear Amen brother Brandon himself says don't look at me pay attention to the message amen that's why it's called voice of God yes sir you cannot take his office as a prophet away from him he fulfilled Malachi 4 he fulfilled revelation 107 amen there is no way you can remove that from the scripture in the same way that you are now fulfilling Revelations 108 to 11 amen you are the manifestation of the voice of God in these last days that will bring forth the true pure unadulterated word amen that's why Jesus said my sheep hear my voice amen they won't follow a false voice they'll hear his voice amen praise God glory to God Amen but it's the greatest battle for the true church to actually believe that Christ is here now he's come his second coming took place in 1963 sir and he's now moving in the midst of people and one awakens over here another one Awakening over there another one's eyes are opening up here another one comes into the church and all of a sudden wait a minute minute what I God sent a prophet and and these things have taken place in our time just like when Moses came when he came to Egypt just like when God sent every Prophet when he sent John the Baptist and he said a greater he says he says I'm not worthy he says Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world he was the Forerunner to his first coming well there had to be another coming amen the second coming and then even Jesus himself said Elijah has come and Elijah shall surely come he's talking about the spirit of Elijah coming into individuals that will be identified by the word of God and they'll only say what the word says and then the holy spirit will vindicate what he said amen glory to God so he comes in the same way amen let's go to the next scripture let's move along here in Proverbs 42-23 says my son we're talking about now having the Revelation in your heart we need to we need to protect ourselves from allowing the enemy to steal away the faith that God has placed into our hearts and believing this message amen praise God attend to my words incline thine ear unto my sayings let them not depart from Thine Eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart Oh Glory to God for they are life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life you mean God will place things into your heart that will allow you to identify with eternal life that you will will recognize that out of you will come the issues of life people will be able to fellowship with you hear you testify of the word of God and recognize that God is in their midst the issues of life will flow from our lives when we guard our heart amen you mean that's exactly where he places his Spirit right in that empty space they've even proven it there's there's a there's an empty space in in a human heart and there's energy and life that flows from there and that is the life of God Amen praise God glory to God and so the Lord says protect yourself guard yourself from the enemy from trying to steal away your your your Revelation on on what God is doing in your life amen because don't forget you're still human oh I've been in the message for 30 years 35 years 20 years big deal deal I seen I've seen brothers and sisters been around this message for that for for for that many years and and in in a terrible condition broken Spirit no joy miserable people just don't you know can't find the joy because they've lost they they've lost their focus their focus has come off of what God wants you to focus on in your life amen too too too distracted by the things of this world amen glory to God but God wants us to have a joyful heart because it's good medicine to our bodies did you know that research shows that depression anger stress are the cause of most diseases yeah it's a proven fact including cancer arthritis heart disease and all kinds of things because of depression but did you know that joy and laughter when you when you've really come into that relationship with the Lord You've you've you've surrendered completely to God and you say Lord you hold my future I am not going to worry no more I'm not going to let the enemy put all this anxiety on my life I'm not going to let him fool me and deceive me into thinking that you know that that that I'm lost and and everything else I'm going to trust your word I'm going to feed on your word I'm going to I'm going to do a concordance scriptural uh you know look look up for every every time Joy is mentioned in the Bible and I'm going to read every scripture on Joy you start doing that it lowers your blood pressure it releases muscle tension it decreases the stress hormones in your body and it boosts your immune system when you're a positive happy person yes listen we want to start the new year right you know January is one of the most depressing months of the year people are constantly oh I'm too fat they join the gym oh the gyms they just go through the roof with with people but four months later they're all gone and the gym guys going still got that monthly payment coming in because they think they're going to come back they oh no I'm going to go back I'm going to go back a year later they've paid 350 bucks and they haven't gone back and then finally they decide you know what I'm going to stop the membership you see because people are looking for change they're looking for happiness they're looking for joy and they can't find they're coming in this month and that visa and MasterCard bill is coming in the mail oh yeah and it's going to be tough it's going to put more oppression on them more anxiety on them now they got to come up with this money Hallelujah but I thank God that he's he's given us a revelation that that a merry heart can can can restore us and give us joy and and give us victory in our lives allow us to look back to the word of God where where all things are possible amen praise God but you know if you're you can't have a merry heart if you're holding anger you're holding something against somebody you cannot have a merry heart you you you got to let go you got to let the Holy Spirit just Purge you of of of an unforgiving spirit thank you Jesus if you if you are holding anything from the past it's because you have not truly surrendered and the Lord has not seen the character and given you that that that new heart yet maybe you're you know you're you're in the lineup for for surgery you're you know you're you're coming along you're getting there you know you're starting to regularly get into the house of the Lord you're starting to read your word you know the Bible more you're starting to come to a place where God just keeps pulling you because everybody comes in his time amen it's not in our time we got to let him work things out in our lives amen praise God but you know when you hold unforgiveness you hold bad hurts from the past past you know bad experiences you you you you're you're like a broken spirit and what does a broken Spirit do it dries up the bones it dries up your body your blood flow isn't the same you start to feel the pain of arthritis because your body is drying up you you you need the oil of the Holy Ghost you need to feed on the word more you need to to to get into more Fellowship around the word amen praise God you need to you need to count your blessings you need to look back at What the Lord Has Done and know that he can do it over and over and over again amen you don't need to stay in the condition that you're in amen you can you can move on with life and you can let go of those hurts of the past amen glory to God you need to guard yourself from Joy Stealers you know what Joy Stealers are sometimes it's your own friends and family y amen you know they're in your heart because you love them and their family but they can't really be a part of your life in Christ because they don't believe they don't receive they put doubting oh you don't have to do that why are you always wearing a dress you can wear pants why is there something wrong with wearing pants no listen a woman and a man God made them different and the scripture says that a woman should should dress in a way that is you know humble not exposing not these tight clothes that most of women wear these days they're they're wearing super tight clothes but for to show that they have a beautiful body well you know what that does to men it causes them to lust after them whether you like it or not it happens because the man is designed in a certain way and the character and the and the makeup of a man without the Holy Ghost he can get easily pulled into that kind of stuff that's why you need the Holy Ghost to bring real Joy because the worst thing is when you you get caught and then you you know you get into a a a a a wrong relationship and it destroys your whole life your whole family your children everything else it's happening all over family destruction is what Satan is is is just you know moving in such a way and you know you think but you mean even in the Simplicity of the way that a woman dresses or a man dresses or or a man presents himself and the kind of character that he has can make a difference yes it can because this is the hour where the word will manifest and if you are the word you're not going to go against the word the spirit of Christ in you is going to dress you as a woman modestly in a way that you're going to express Christ in a in a humble spirit thank you Jesus amen praise God so sometimes we gotta we got to let go of those those those people that are Joy stealers in our lives unbelief around our lives listen we love our family I'm not telling you you got to you know you got to leave your family and this and that no there's a way that you can separate by not by understanding that that you can't you can't convince them of anything and they need to know that they can't convince you and you need to have the right kind of relationship amen instead of them trying to constantly turn you away from from what you believe amen and so if they're if they're going to constantly do that they're going to every time you get together there's a struggle there's a fight that means you need to separate yes even Jesus himself said I didn't come to bring everybody together I come with a sword which is the word and the word will separate amen us and if there's if there's ever been an hour where the true church just like Israel just look at Israel remember what we said about Israel being a type of the Bride of the of the Gentile Church well just look at the condition of Israel I don't I don't need to say much you can just go and research it yourself she's hated by most of the world now you listen to the news you you know I was listening yesterday and they were saying and and you know these meetings that they're having in in Qatar certain individuals are going there and the phrase that caught my attention was and this way Israel can know how much pressure is on them they need to know that that there's pressure on them to to AG age to a ceasefire not the pressure that that that that should be on the enemy the devil habas all these wicked demons that are that are destroying and killing innocent people they're looking at Israel and not recognizing what's really going on how the enemy is trying to destroy that's why Trump you know one thing I can say about Trump and I we'll see but you know if it if it comes to but he says he says all hell is going to break loose on the day that I come into office if all of those hostages are not released let's see what happens because that really you don't give into the enemy you don't give into the devil no you don't give into his attacks you don't let him attack your family attack your children attack your finan attack your health no sir you go back with the word of God and you tell them the Lord God of Israel the god of Heaven and Earth the the Lord Jehovah Gyra he provides my needs the Lord Jehovah shama he's my healer he's my peace Shalom amen he is the Lord God that provides for for me for my home for my family and you stay there and then you can truly experience the joy of the Lord amen amen let's go to the next scripture in John chapter in 1 John 5:14-15 it says and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us and if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desire of him but you know that you can't go to him when you've got conviction in your heart when you've got condemnation in your heart the true understanding of a son or daughter of God is that there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ and so when you're approaching the Lord if you've come into a real relationship with God and you go to him in prayer there should be be nothing between you and that prayer there should be no condemnation if there's things that you're carrying you if you've got if you've got like I said you've got an unforgiving Spirit on you it's in your heart and if your heart condemns you God don't hear you you need to you need to make things right you need to get rid of those things that are holding you back from having a Pure Clean Heart before the Lord and then allow him to to just pour into you everything that you have need of Amen every need the scripture says he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desire of him amen asking for the right thing with the wrong heart is not God's will you got to have the right heart when you're praying for a brother or a sister amen or you're praying for your children you want to pray in the right way you want to oh Lord let the devil go after them what kind of a character is that Lord have mercy on them have mercy on my brother and sister have mercy on my boss have mercy on these situations that are that are bringing such you know such pain and and and sorrow in my my life let those things go so that you can come to the Lord the bi listen the Lord said if you're not willing to forgive God ain't going to forgive you he's not going to set you free from the things because you can be a son or a daughter of God hold an unforgiving heart and you can stay in a certain condition for Years yet you're a son or a daughter of God but you're not experiencing the joy of the Lord because of your exper erence and because you're holding on to the enemy's lies glory to God so if you're coming to God to ask for something and you're holding on to an offense against someone violating the law of love and lacking Joy your prayer likely won't be answered yes in Matthew 5:8 next slide it says your blessed are the pure in heart you're going to see God I love that scripture that scripture just so alive for me I'm so thankful we all make mistakes we all fall short we all there's no way you can be perfect but one thing is that when you go and you get on your knees before God and you're pure in your heart you're you're you're sorry you're truly sorry for the situation you're truly you youve you've totally surrendered unto the Lord and you've become pure in your heart and know that you're naked before God guess what you're going to see God in your life amen you're going to see change in your life you're going to see all kinds of things coming around you that you never thought you you didn't deserve it all of a sudden it's coming to you blessing after blessing God starts blessing your family starts blessing your children starts blessing your Finance starts lowering your blood pressure starts taking the pain out of your body taking all these things you you need the joy of the Lord the Lord's Joy back into your life amen praise God hallelujah amen listen this is not the kind of character that comes from a joyful person Joy doesn't complain or Grumble about people or situations Joy is predictably happy every day am we're talking about the joy of the Lord here you're going to have trials you're going to get mad from time to time the Bible says be angry but don't sin it's it's there's nothing wrong with having moments where you're going to be tested and tried and even get angry and you know uh the these but but don't let that take away remember the Revelation the anchor The Anchor Holds you amen Joy doesn't crumble to self-pity at the slightest bit of negative news oh the doctor said my my my cholesterol went up 00002 I got to cut everything out and now you become so miserable now not only are you miserable you're going to make your friends around you your husband your wife your family miserable because all of a sudden mom's not bringing anything into the house anymore like you know all of a sudden we can't even eat anything that we like Joy talks back to difficult situations with the word of God that's what Joy does amen amen Joy isn't easily defeated but is empowered by the authority of Jesus Christ in their lives amen because they know that it's his Joy it's not your put on Joy amen Joy is optimistic not pessimistic too much negativity we got to let we got to go on a fast we got to go on a negative word fast people want to do something you know they they want to have you know New Year's resolutions make it a resolution for the next 21 days to avoid negative statements coming out of your mouth instead replace it with a scripture if it needs to be the joy of the Lord is my strength when you get angry you don't need to say it out loud you can just speak it right in your heart joy of the Lord is my strength praise God before you know it all of a sudden things start to change you're going to you're going to be drawn to the word the more you read the word the more you feed on the word the more you come to church the more you want it's it's the same like Addiction in this flesh it works the same with the Lord the more of him you get the more you want am the more experiences you have in the Supernatural the more you want the more you see him moving in this little situation that situation you ever notice that when you start to work out and you start to actually go into a fitness program you don't want those Foods anymore you don't want all that all all that Sugar anymore all of a sudden it just automatically starts falling away well the same thing with your mind because you you feeding on too much garbage you got to be careful what you feed on is what you're going to actually manifest and it's going to show in your countenance amen praise God Joy encourages and it doesn't tear down so we need to know how to encourage one another you know when somebody comes to you and they're looking for some advice look for ways to to to to speak to them in a way that will encourage them and still bring bring the same message amen you don't have to tell them well if you stop eating all those chips and all that pop and all those chocolate bars then you wouldn't be feeling so lousy there's another way that you can deal with that say you know what honey I've picked up some nice fresh celery and strawberries and you know blueberries and and uh you know some some uh some really you know like look for things and ways to approach it from an encouragement because when somebody is encouraged they get lifted up they feel better they feel encouraged amen praise God Joy is a pleasure to be around amen and this is an attitude one has all these things when when when you've got this kind of an attitude that's the attitude you want to go to God with where you're positive where you're you're encouraging you're you're enthusiastic you're optimistic amen you bring the word of God a complainer isn't going to wake up one day to a treasure of all kinds of answered prayer because he's His Own Worst Enemy in being negative all the time and being a complainer all the time amen glory to God Amen just as faith and love work together faith and joy work together too did you know that amen glory to God Amen let's look at the next slide here we're we're going to start to wind this down in Psalms 126: 2-3 then was our mouth filled with laughter you know laughter is a good thing don't be afraid of a good laugh every now and then and our tongue with singing then said they among the Heathen the Lord hath done great things for them the Lord ha done great things for us whereof we are glad we are happy you know when when you look back on the things that the Lord has done for you you should be the happiest people on the Earth God come into your life where your future looked like man it was a total mess and you had no future to really look forward to and now he's come into your life and he says your future is clear your future is absolutely perfectly clear I've I've given your land to you I've given you your health I've given you your wealth I've given you eternal life he's Oh Glory to God you should be the happiest people on the Earth and this is what the scripture was saying that he will put laughter and joy in your mouth Amen in Psalms 95: 1 to two it says oh come let us sing unto the Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise you know what I love you know I love getting into a good Belly Laugh there's nothing like it it's so good it's because you you start that's a Joyful Noise especially if you're watching a good Christian comedian and there are some out there you know there's nothing wrong with going to YouTube with the family sit down watch a Christian comedian that doesn't use obscenities and so forth and get and sit down and allow the whole Holy Spirit to put some laughter into your walk amen praise God oh come he says Make a Joyful Noise amen he says let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord with him with Psalms amen Psalms 22 but Thou Art holy oh thou that inhabit us the Praises of Israel he inhabits the Praises of his people when you're having a good joyful fellowship with your brothers and sisters rejoicing on what the what the Lord has done for you it brings it brings a laughter and a joy into the atmosphere that you start to receive healing you start to get you start to feel better your blood pressure starts to drop things start to feel better the pain in your body start like I'm feeling no pain up here right now just the anointing of the Holy Spirit but I wake up in the morning I got to lay down on the ground I got to stretch stretch I got to do some stretching I got to do some sit-ups I got to do some push-ups to get the pain out of the body you see but like physical exercise is good but laughing and and and having a good belly laugh from time to time and having good fun Fellowship is also just as good amen praise God reminds me of a joke a priest was driving with a taxi driver and they you know got into a a terrible head-on collision and the both of them died right there in the car and the both of them went to heaven and guess what Peter met them at the Pearly Gates and now you know he was all excited the taxi driver Peter says Mr Taxi Driver come with me let me show you your mansion and he takes the taxi driver and he shows him this Mansion my God it had a bowling alley in there it had an Olympic siiz pool he says wow praise God I had no idea that this was going to be for me and then he says Mr priest come with me and he takes the priest to this Shack it's an old dilapitated shack and the priest said whoa whoa whoa whoa whoaa where are we going here he says you got it mixed up here he says I'm the priest I'm the one that went to church all the time I'm the one that was preaching the the the word to the people he says how how in the world does he got that and I got this he says when when you were preaching the people were falling asleep he says when the taxi driver was driving the people were praying hallelujah praise God Amen it's there's nothing wrong with a good little you know laugh every now and then but I'm being serious and saying that it's good for you to change and and and and don't get into a countenance where you're always thinking about the negativity come out of it and let the Lord fill you with his Joy amen praise God as we close we're going to wind down here just a few minutes but laughter is good for your soul and so I'm asking you when's the last time you had a good Belly Laugh you need to take some time to arrange a time where you can get together with your friends and your family and maybe watch a good Christian comedian and get into a good Belly Laugh amen one guy that I watch every now and then is Michael Jr okay look him up on YouTube and watch him he's funny he'll get you into a belly laugh amen because you know he talks about his experiences of being brought up in church and everything else and he's a real Christian too and he you know like I mean he loves the Lord amen praise God okay so you know but you know life can you know get hard sometimes and we need to do things just like we need to exercise when our bodies get you know a little bit out of out of whack right amen and you know now I want to just bring I looked you know I found some of this information on the internet there's a renowned neurosurgeon his name is Dr Avery Jackson and he's done a lot of research on the effects of laughter and joy on the health of your spirit your soul and your body and he shared how recent research proves that laughter in conjunction with exercise will repair your body far faster than any natural process it's a proven fact so you know how you got to go on the treadmill once in a while put on a comedian go on the treadmill and watch and laugh and get into a good laugh you're going to burn a lot more calories a lot quicker and pain is going to leave your body amen glory to God the good news is that you can make a decision you can decide like I said you can decide that you're going to have a fun night that you're going to get we've done it Pastor Simon there was times where we got together and you know the the you know a group of us got together and he' put on a a comedian and it was a Christian comedian and we'd all have a really good time and a good laugh together why was he doing that because he understood that sometimes you know walk in this walk it can get pretty hard because we're the target we're constantly under bombardment we're constantly being attacked and so we need to know how to apply the word of God in our lives amen and this is just another way that we can apply the word amen amen I'm giving you and showing you scriptures that that to show that God has done great things in our lives amen laughter increases blood flow amen these are four things he says laughter improves your blood flow which in turn reduces your stress hormones lowers your blood pressure and activates your immune system poor blood flow is the root cause of many diseases that's why it's good to stretch in the morning A friend of mine told me this years ago he said I said Ray I mean you're looking so good and the way you're still moving he's about 10 years older than me and he was looking really good he says Danny say I'm going to tell you something he says all I do is I stretch like yoga just get on the ground and just stretch as far as you can stretch I'm telling you this because I know it works because I do it every morning that's my wife you stretch your arms out as far as you can go until you're feeling like like it's almost painful that you're stretching and then you're tightening your hands and and doing like these are simple little things and then stretching your body and then pulling your legs into your chest and stretching your back doing these simple stretches and I'm telling you you can get up off the floor and you will immediately within minutes notice the difference and it does work praise God Amen because why because when you're doing that you're forcing your blood to go to these areas they're they're actually that's it's blood flow moving through your body amen and when blood flows through your body it eliminates uh you know it it decreases inflammation amen man uh you know and and uh it and it activates the the the hormones uh you know to reduce stress hormones and lowers your blood pressure activates your immune system amen po praise God when you exercise and laugh you are increasing blood flow to your brain facilitating God's healing mechanism and preventing disease God has ways of of naturally keeping our bodies healthy while we're here that's why you cannot extend your life on Earth I'm sorry you think you can you can't the Lord gives and the Lord takes the Bible says there's a time to be
