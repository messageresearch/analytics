[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good evening friends it's good to be in
[0:18] the house of the Lord I'm happy to be
[0:22] here in the middle of the week for our
[0:27] Bible studies let us pray
[0:33] our gracious Heavenly Father bless our
[0:38] Bible study tonight may this lesson be a
[0:42] blessing to every heart may every child
[0:48] of God receive the Word of God and
[0:53] rejoice and give him praise for this
[0:57] great day and for this hour we bless
[1:01] your Holy Name in Jesus wonderful and
[1:06] precious name Amen and amen
[1:10] well tonight I will continue in our
[1:16] introduction to this seven church ages
[1:20] this will be part two now I'm reading
[1:25] from Revelation chapter 1 verses 1 to 2
[1:30] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:35] gave unto him to shew unto his servants
[1:41] things which must shortly come to pass
[1:45] and he sent and signified it by his
[1:50] angel unto his servant John who bare
[1:57] record of the word of God and of the
[2:01] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[2:05] things that he saw and now I'll read
[2:10] another scripture out of the Gospel of
[2:16] Luke chapter 10 verse 21 in that hour
[2:24] Jesus
[2:25] joist in spirit and said I thank thee O
[2:31] Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that
[2:35] thou has hid these things from the wise
[2:39] and prudent and has revealed them unto
[2:45] babes even so father for so it seemed
[2:50] good in thy sight o praise be to God
[2:57] now in last week's study which we began
[3:04] the introduction to this marvelous book
[3:09] of Revelation I pointed to the fact that
[3:15] John was only an inspired scribe but
[3:23] Jesus Christ Himself was the author it
[3:29] is usually said and many times I've
[3:32] heard it where Pope have said to me odd
[3:36] men wrote the Bible it was just men that
[3:40] wrote the Bible right but we understand
[3:45] clearly that the Bible itself tells us
[3:50] that holy men of God wrote and spoke as
[3:55] they were moved by the Holy Spirit they
[4:00] were inspired so it was not men that
[4:05] actually wrote the Bible men were
[4:08] scribes of the Bible but it was God
[4:12] Himself who wrote a true inspired and
[4:18] surrendered men about himself and his
[4:23] own Word and future things that were to
[4:28] come now there's a beautiful song that
[4:32] I've always loved and it's a song that
[4:36] was sung by the country investors singer
[4:40] bill and country singer Bill Anderson
[4:44] and that song says I have the pencil but
[4:50] he wrote this song I can do nothing
[4:54] alone I held the pencil but he wrote
[4:59] this song I can do nothing alone
[5:04] I meant clear also the teaching on the
[5:10] importance of Revelation to the true
[5:14] believer and in doing so I indicated
[5:18] that I was and I'm now speaking not just
[5:22] about the book of Revelation itself but
[5:27] I'm speaking about the god-given gift of
[5:31] Revelation for unto you it is given to
[5:35] know the mystery of the kingdom but unto
[5:39] them it is not given oh under you it is
[5:44] given to know the mystery or the hidden
[5:47] things of God the hidden things of God
[5:51] but unto them it is not given it is not
[5:55] given to wise men it's not given to the
[5:58] theologians it's not given to the
[6:01] prudent but it is given to those that
[6:05] are like babes in other words those that
[6:08] are willing to learn God's holy spirit
[6:13] revealing reveals himself in simplicity
[6:17] and is recognized and known in the same
[6:22] way I'm speaking about the gift of
[6:26] revelation I'm speaking about
[6:29] individuals or people that God will give
[6:33] this Faculty of Revelation in their soul
[6:38] that they would recognize his word well
[6:43] did he say my sheep hear my voice and
[6:46] the stranger the
[6:48] will not follow revelation the
[6:52] supernatural ability and capacity to
[6:57] recognize and receive revelation from
[7:00] the presence of Almighty God this is a
[7:04] the revelation I am talking about not
[7:08] about the just the book but to
[7:12] understand the book to receive the
[7:14] things that are written in the book to
[7:17] be blessed by the book as you read the
[7:20] book as we study the book we need this
[7:23] faculty this capacity this recognition
[7:27] of what God Spirit is doing in our
[7:31] spirit now we understand that this is
[7:36] also revelation can be also called this
[7:39] sixth sense the sixth sense
[7:42] where we go beyond our five senses and
[7:46] the sense of faith comes into action of
[7:51] course the word faith means a revelation
[7:55] it does not only mean to believe for
[8:00] before you can believe there must be
[8:02] something that you must believe in and
[8:05] that has to be revealed to you so grace
[8:10] is fates foundation God reveals himself
[8:14] to whomsoever He wills by his marvelous
[8:19] grace for he said to the spirit book of
[8:22] Revelation I will the key of David I
[8:25] open and no man shuts I shut and no man
[8:30] opens now I just spoke to you saying if
[8:36] ala had this supernatural ability you'll
[8:40] find that in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 4
[8:42] where it says Abel offered a more
[8:46] excellent sacrifice a better sacrifice
[8:50] than Cain oh how wonderful no Bible was
[8:55] read
[8:55] no scrolls were written but but by this
[9:00] of faculty this ability God made known
[9:06] to him exactly what he was supposed to
[9:11] offer and what he was supposed to do so
[9:16] by faith by revelation email knew what
[9:21] he was supposed to do he knew who he was
[9:25] who his brother was where he came from
[9:29] and who was his father blessed be the
[9:33] name of the Lord I emphasize to you that
[9:38] revelation is the key to truly
[9:42] understanding the entire Bible and every
[9:47] word that is in it now by having this
[9:52] god-given gift of being able to read
[9:57] between the lines and to perceive or see
[10:03] the hidden meanings out of God's Word
[10:07] then friends there you will be the
[10:11] condition or a state where a brace where
[10:15] you have eyes of an open and a humble
[10:19] and surrendered heart to God and you
[10:25] will understand that if the Bible was
[10:28] given to men by inspiration and by
[10:33] revelation then it must be received by
[10:37] revelation it must be accepted by
[10:40] revelation it enters our hearts and our
[10:44] lives by revelation Oh glory be to God
[10:49] oh we saw how Satan hates this quality
[10:53] of revelation he hates this ability to
[10:57] receive revelation and because it
[11:01] reveals his origins it reveals his
[11:05] shameful fall from the heights of
[11:09] glory and he was cast down let me use up
[11:14] a phrase that's a little clearer he was
[11:17] kicked out of heaven just as much as you
[11:20] as a true believer has the right to kick
[11:23] him out of your life kick him out of
[11:26] your consciousness
[11:27] kick him out of your affairs have faith
[11:30] in God
[11:31] only believe all things are possible to
[11:34] them that believe yes
[11:37] so he hates revelation because it
[11:40] reveals to you
[11:42] his original his shameful degradation it
[11:47] reveals still his works his awful
[11:52] terrible murdering lying destroying ways
[11:56] it makes clear to you all of his total
[12:01] defeat by Michael and all of the other
[12:05] angels who defeated him and cast him out
[12:09] of heaven with all of his lies and so he
[12:13] got the name the father of lies and came
[12:17] to earth with vengeance in his heart for
[12:21] all of God's people the whole human race
[12:24] as well as God's elected seed that is
[12:29] within the human race so he hates
[12:33] Revelation with a passion because it
[12:37] also shows his final destruction and the
[12:43] very end of his existence for he is not
[12:47] an eternal being he is not an
[12:50] all-knowing being he is a creature and
[12:55] so his final end is coming and he will
[13:00] totally be dissolved he will lose total
[13:04] existence along with all of his
[13:08] followers that follow in his footsteps
[13:12] acts after his actions and received him
[13:16] as their representative my dear brother
[13:20] my dear sister tonight you can clearly
[13:23] see why Satan hates all revelation you
[13:28] see this ability to receive revelation
[13:32] to disability to receive present truth
[13:36] and present truth exposes him and that
[13:40] is why Jesus said to Peter he said
[13:45] clearly to him that word simon simon
[13:48] barjona flesh and blood has not revealed
[13:52] this unto you but my father in heaven
[13:56] has revealed this unto you and upon this
[14:00] rock will I build my church and the
[14:03] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[14:06] it
[14:06] Jesus has built his church on the
[14:10] rock-solid foundation of the revelation
[14:14] of himself who is the word no that is
[14:19] that is something that must be meditated
[14:23] upon think upon these things let the
[14:26] holy spirit make clear to you his word
[14:30] here tonight all Satan hates revelation
[14:34] but we true believers we love it with
[14:38] all our hearts now we see in the church
[14:42] age book page of 15 listen no Satan hits
[14:51] this book of revelation of Jesus Christ
[14:53] in the church he hates Revelation he
[14:57] knows that Jesus Christ is the same
[15:00] yesterday today and forever and he
[15:05] changes not he knows Satan knows that a
[15:11] whole lot more than noon than 90% of the
[15:16] theologians
[15:18] listen he is a being that was in the
[15:21] presence of Almighty God worshipping up
[15:24] there and was kicked out and has so many
[15:28] thousands of years
[15:30] of existence and then a theologian will
[15:35] go to a school for you know five years
[15:38] ten years twenty years whether he
[15:40] studied for twenty-five or fifty years
[15:41] of his entire life and hopes to compete
[15:44] against a Satan in in this type of
[15:49] situation condition the world conditions
[15:52] that we are in the only person that can
[15:55] defeat him decisively and cast him out
[15:59] the only person that can overcome him is
[16:02] Jesus Christ who has already defeated
[16:05] him rose up in power and said I am the
[16:08] resurrection and the life in another
[16:11] place he said I have overcome the world
[16:14] all thanks be to God and we overcome the
[16:19] world by he that has already overcome
[16:22] living within our hearts glory be to his
[16:25] marvelous and blessed name Satan knows
[16:29] that the original Church with the power
[16:33] of God is the is a blueprint for all of
[16:41] God's body all of his money that is the
[16:45] blueprint for his church but man has
[16:48] changed that blueprint and made at every
[16:52] other church body shape form
[16:56] organization system what however you
[16:59] want to term it they have changed it and
[17:02] split it up into parts now my brothers
[17:07] and sisters Satan knows that when the
[17:10] truth church begins to recognize that
[17:13] are and who she is then we know that
[17:16] he's in real deep trouble because the
[17:21] Holy Spirit working through the church
[17:23] will bring him to account of the Word of
[17:27] God now the book of Revelation shows how
[17:31] the Antichrist spirit would come into
[17:34] the church the violent you file it and
[17:38] would do everything to destroy God's
[17:41] people and so he
[17:43] fights the Word of God in every possible
[17:47] way that's what he does that's what his
[17:50] job is to continue to fight the Word of
[17:54] God but we are here standing by the side
[17:59] of the word of God and we stand with the
[18:02] word he knows what the true church
[18:06] should be he knows what kind of
[18:10] character she should have he's fully
[18:14] aware of what works the greater works
[18:18] that the church is supposed to perform
[18:21] under the power of the Holy Ghost under
[18:24] the presence of Jesus Christ living
[18:27] within her life he is aware fully of the
[18:31] church what actions she and she should
[18:34] have what kind of a life that she should
[18:37] live yes sir and he is aware of this
[18:42] ability to receive revelation how it
[18:46] exposes him it exposes all of his
[18:50] attempts to destroy the true church
[18:54] God's people it ripped shows and reveals
[18:58] and exposes his constant attacks
[19:03] discrediting the Word of God but
[19:07] belittling the Word of God
[19:09] and by making fun of the word of God and
[19:15] trivializing the Word of God this
[19:18] happens all the time you see it
[19:20] sometimes on TV or you hear it on the
[19:23] news yeah as the Bible already predicted
[19:26] thousands of years ago how that there
[19:28] will come in the end there will come
[19:31] scoffers there will come a curse who
[19:35] will say where is the promise of his
[19:37] coming where is this premise of this
[19:39] rapture what about this resurrection
[19:42] you're talking about what of this
[19:44] judgment you're talking about they'll
[19:47] say oh there's no such a thing oh yeah
[19:50] you're just being just religious
[19:53] but we are not just being religious we
[19:55] recognize that day the message and they
[19:59] are in which we are living in and we
[20:02] know we are living in the shadows of a
[20:04] coming god we know we're living in the
[20:07] shadow of the coming of our Lord to
[20:10] catch his waiting grind away Satan is
[20:14] furious because of this exposure this
[20:18] revelation of all his works from even to
[20:22] this time and into the things that are
[20:26] going to be he is fully aware that we
[20:29] are conscious those who are related by
[20:32] the Word of God are conscious of him and
[20:36] can anticipate his works and his actions
[20:39] and be able to defeat him and destroy
[20:42] him in everything that he tries to do
[20:45] Satan knows that if the people get the
[20:51] true revelation and God anoints them and
[20:58] they become a UH a church anointed by
[21:03] revelation present truth by Jesus Christ
[21:08] himself in the present stage of his
[21:12] ministry that kind of a church will be
[21:16] an invincible army that he cannot defeat
[21:21] he cannot prevail against her in any way
[21:25] yes sir when that church when this
[21:29] church in this day this people this
[21:32] bright this bunch of Revelation
[21:36] believers wherever they are scattered
[21:39] wherever they are some are still in
[21:41] denominations they haven't recognized
[21:43] themselves they haven't recognized their
[21:45] position in Christ some learn various
[21:48] countries of the world speaking
[21:50] different languages but one language
[21:53] they speak is the language of truth the
[21:56] language of Revelation
[21:58] language of the opening of the word and
[22:00] the empowering of the Holy Spirit
[22:03] and when that last date church is
[22:06] anointed by this word of God that to be
[22:10] open unto us then we find out when she
[22:14] recognizes realizes what God is doing
[22:18] when she recognizes the importance of
[22:21] the placing and the use of Revelation
[22:26] and that she is of the continuation of
[22:31] the book of Acts then heard walk her
[22:34] talk her very the very actions will
[22:38] produced such a vindication that the
[22:41] world will recognize that these are a
[22:45] different people anointed by the pure
[22:48] hand of God and the Spirit of God
[22:51] fools true her for she is just a a
[22:55] vessel for his glory and for his honor
[22:58] when that church begins to recognize
[23:01] what she is and who she is
[23:05] that she is a part of the word she is a
[23:08] part of the body of Jesus Christ and
[23:10] that she is him now being revealed
[23:14] Christ is the mystery now being revealed
[23:19] oh thanks be to God that Christ is
[23:23] revealing himself in his own word and
[23:26] that those who have eyes to see and ears
[23:29] ears to hear hear the work of the Lord
[23:32] and recognize your day and a message for
[23:36] your day thanks be to God when that
[23:39] church begins to recognize the word she
[23:42] should be what she should be standing
[23:45] for then she'll drop all our treats
[23:48] she'll drop off are spotty garments of
[23:52] all kinds of litanies and fundamentals
[23:55] and standards and practices of man and
[24:00] the systems of
[24:01] and spotty unclean Bob Merton doctrines
[24:05] given through the centuries and using
[24:08] that to be credibility because yeah it's
[24:11] been around for so many years it's
[24:14] become when allies told over and over
[24:17] again after a while masses of people
[24:20] begin to believe it as truth but the
[24:23] true believer can cut through the veneer
[24:27] of lies and cut to the bone and be able
[24:31] by Hebrews 4:12 the Word of God is a
[24:35] discerner and it's able discern between
[24:38] truth and error lies and truth the
[24:42] Spirit of God in the believer is capable
[24:45] of doing that know what I'm speaking
[24:48] about here the church then we begin to
[24:51] understand what she is capable of she
[24:55] will begin to understand her potential
[24:59] her capacity and her power that Satan
[25:03] cannot withstand now there's a story in
[25:06] the Bible which is the story of Samson
[25:09] I'm sure many of you are aware of the
[25:12] story of Samson and there was one
[25:16] turning when the Philistine army went
[25:21] out to capture Samson just as much as
[25:25] the all the demons of all past ages have
[25:29] accumulated in this last day called the
[25:32] division age and the accumulation of
[25:36] demon power is now coming like a flood
[25:40] and gets the Church of the Living God
[25:43] even so these overwhelming forces of
[25:49] over a thousand Philistines came against
[25:54] Samson and Samson had to fight against
[25:59] them and looking around for a weapon he
[26:03] found on the ground the jawbone of an
[26:07] asked that that ass had died and the
[26:13] jawbone was
[26:14] rotten one touch from him it would fall
[26:20] apart but here with the anointing of the
[26:24] Holy Spirit came upon Samson and Samson
[26:30] picked up that job own oven ass and
[26:33] begin to smite the Philistines with the
[26:37] power of Almighty God in him and it's
[26:41] recorded in Scripture on that day that
[26:45] Samson one man destroyed one thousand
[26:49] Philistines with God's help with God's
[26:52] power with God's Spirit with God's
[26:55] anointing upon him he destroyed a
[26:58] thousand Philistines that day a thousand
[27:02] Philistines and let me emphasize
[27:04] Philistine warriors these were not
[27:07] farmers they were different ladies and
[27:10] gentlemen these are not powder puffs
[27:13] these were Mountain and and uh veteran
[27:17] warriors coming against Samson and
[27:21] Samson came against them with this dry
[27:25] brittle jaw bone of an ass that was
[27:29] laying on the desert floor for years and
[27:32] years Big Dipper and the Spirit of God
[27:35] so anointed him it flowed into that jaw
[27:39] bone of an ass and he smoked and slew
[27:42] one thousand Philistines of course that
[27:47] was only a type and a shadow of what
[27:51] God's anointed Church
[27:54] what do and should do in the stage and
[27:59] in this hour the words of the Bible as
[28:03] I've spoken before have become dry and
[28:06] dead true the dark ages of the church
[28:10] and to a great extent still drying with
[28:14] him it's dump given the National
[28:15] habitats there it is dry brittle oh my
[28:21] friends that dry bone was late
[28:24] but thanks be to God that brittle that
[28:28] does that jump off that was back then
[28:32] which I am showing to you was the Word
[28:36] of God through the ages that land there
[28:39] within these Muslims of call the church
[28:43] is called denominations called
[28:46] sanctuaries called
[28:48] whatever names that they were given
[28:51] dried up and dead oh we see in their in
[28:56] their activities of mysticism
[28:59] monasticism and finally in our day a
[29:03] whole host of denominationalism they
[29:06] have made the Word of God dry and
[29:10] brittle in the eyes of the people but oh
[29:13] how the Word of God comes alive in the
[29:17] hands of fate
[29:19] faith of courses of Revelation in the
[29:21] hands of one anointed by faith in the
[29:25] hands of a church anointed with acts
[29:29] 2:38 acts 2:4 that's one by the Holy
[29:35] Spirit and when they take that Word of
[29:38] God
[29:38] in the hands of Revelation oh oh praise
[29:43] God then that true church that was once
[29:46] blinded and has caught the relations of
[29:50] the last prophets message that the
[29:54] invincible church once that dry brittle
[29:58] bone now becomes a supernatural weapon
[30:02] in the hand of faith of such a church
[30:05] that church will be able by having one
[30:09] of their believers will be able to
[30:12] destroy and chase 1000 demons and two of
[30:18] them together will chase two thousand
[30:21] disbelieving geological demons of Hell
[30:25] away from the Word of God yes Satan
[30:28] hates revelation but thanks be to God
[30:32] we love it he hates it but we love it
[30:37] for Revelation is supernatural and he
[30:40] can't get it but God reveals to
[30:44] whomsoever He wills for unto you it is
[30:48] given it's a gift it's given to know to
[30:53] know the mystery the hidden things of
[30:55] God but unto them it is not given Oh
[31:00] blessed be the name of the Lord
[31:03] revelation friends helps us to
[31:07] understand and discern between good and
[31:10] evil what is good and what is evil and
[31:14] makes plain to us the hidden things of
[31:18] God that was hidden for ages and for
[31:22] dispensation
[31:23] as Paul said Oh glory to his marvelous
[31:27] wonderful name by the use of this
[31:30] supernatural weapon oh thank god this
[31:34] weapon of Revelation we are able to
[31:37] discern and see Satan's activities to
[31:43] Anto sense his presence we also were
[31:47] able to recognize his the truth his
[31:51] spirit right recognized two spirits
[31:56] working within the framework of the
[32:00] Church of the Living God
[32:02] now as Cain and Abel were born in the
[32:09] womb of King there were twins and they
[32:13] were in the womb of Eve together so are
[32:19] twins
[32:20] within the body of the modern day Church
[32:26] twins in the beginning twins in the end
[32:29] but the Spirit of the Living God is here
[32:33] to discern the Lord's body the Spirit of
[32:36] God is here to create the situation of
[32:39] operation from unbelief and for the
[32:42] believer to recognize oh praise God so
[32:46] these two spirits are at work within the
[32:50] church body in this last night one God
[32:54] one of Satan twins in the beginning and
[32:58] here come the twins again in the end all
[33:02] children of God wherever you are this is
[33:06] the hour of the manifestation of the
[33:09] certified seed sons and daughters of the
[33:12] Living God oh come and go with me
[33:15] tonight to my father's house where there
[33:19] is joy and peace oh there is love and
[33:22] grace and fellowship enjoy an
[33:26] understanding and light for me a
[33:28] children of the light we do not walk in
[33:31] darkness but the people who sat in
[33:33] spiritual ignorance on darkness have
[33:36] seen a great light and are walking in
[33:40] that light today oh the evening lights
[33:42] of commonism fact that God and Christ
[33:46] are one Oh Lord of God come my brothers
[33:49] my sisters across the world across the
[33:53] nation wherever you are come and enter
[33:56] with me into this glorious liberty of
[33:59] the manifestations of the sons and
[34:02] daughters of God truly truly Satan hates
[34:06] the light of Revelation but we love it
[34:10] we love it and we love it because it
[34:13] empowers us to discern him it empowers
[34:19] us to discern his Antichrist spirit he
[34:23] may be did you know that Satan is a
[34:26] religious being lots of people will say
[34:30] oh there is no god but Satan is
[34:32] religious enough to know right that
[34:35] there is a god and that's why he
[34:37] trembles for his end is at hand so the
[34:42] Spirit of God in the true believer is
[34:44] able to discern by the word by spiritual
[34:50] gifts by anointing that various me
[34:53] Satan his activities his works his
[34:56] presence his actions in this religious
[35:00] operating in a religious realm with his
[35:03] religious enticing spirits and seducing
[35:08] spirits blinding and deceiving and
[35:13] misleading the minds and the hearts of
[35:16] men oh thanks be to God for the Blessed
[35:20] holy spirit of truth that John the
[35:23] Apostle speaks of how that when he the
[35:26] spirit of truth is come he will guide
[35:29] you into all truth and show you things
[35:32] to come
[35:33] we love revelation don't you I love
[35:36] revelations because Satan and his
[35:40] cronies all his followers all his imps

[36:17] able to recognize his activities his
[36:21] movements and to checkmate him and to
[36:25] stop and block his evil moves and what
[36:30] all of his plans that he planned
[36:33] meticulously and yet we we we Walker in
[36:38] and out of them we walk in the fiery
[36:41] walk out of the fire and none of our
[36:44] clothing none of our being is burned or
[36:48] smoky or worldly or touched by him Oh
[36:51] blessed be the name of the Lord
[36:54] we are ambled by this facility to be
[36:57] able to uncover all his schemes on all
[37:03] of us manipulate
[37:05] and the strategies we are able to
[37:08] recognize his undermining of the kingdom
[37:12] of God and rebuke him in the name of
[37:15] Jesus Christ saying the Lord rebuke thee
[37:18] in Jesus name we love revelation
