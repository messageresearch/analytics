TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good sunday morning to all of you god bless you richly it is a joy to be here on another bright sunday morning in the lord's house amount and with his people bringing and giving glory to his wonderful and marvelous name we are approaching the subject of the place where god put his name the place where god put his name now i want to read from the book of deuteronomy chapter 16 verses 4 to 6 shall we read out of the word of god and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days neither shall there be anything of the flesh which thou sacrificed us the first day at even remain all night until the morning thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates which the lord thy god giveth thee but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name in there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at evening at the going down of the sun at the season that thou camest fought out of egypt praise god god's blessing now upon the speaking and receiving of his wonderful and glorious word my friends let us pray together brothers and sisters in christ and may the lord bless us here as we go into the word of god with joy and the hunger of righteousness within our soul may the spirit of god rest upon each one of us in our various homes of various places wherever we are and may this word of god go forth may the great holy spirit be magnified and glorified amen let us pray our gracious god our heavenly father we ask your divine blessing upon this thy word and we pray with all our hearts lord that the great holy spirit though lord sometimes it seems so different yet we ask that you will have your way that you will take the word and apply this token to our lines to our hearts and may your name be lifted up and glorified for we ask it in the name of our lord jesus christ with the forgiveness of our sins the healing of our bodies oh god and for the renewing of our mind as the word goes sport in jesus name amen and amen now in introducing this subject of course we must first of all know what is god's name and secondly we must learn where did he put it and then where is god's name now i'll encourage encourage you in this coming week to spend some time reading the 12th to the 16th chapters of the book of deuteronomy read it with the spirit of christ upon you and i believe your heart your eyes of your soul will be opened up to the word of god so remember study the bible read the bible deuteronomy 12 chapter 12 through chapter 16 and i'm sure that we will be a blessing to your heart now first of all we want to talk about where is what is god's name we find out that god has many titles he was called father he was called son of course father is a title and son is a title he was called holy ghost but that in itself is a title he is called rose of sharon which is a title lily of the valley that is a title he was called morning star that is a title he was called jehovah jiren that is a title oh praise god hallelujah now but announce all of these titles he has a name god has a name to him behold the glory enter in praise when he met moses he had not a name as yet a name as we know it as yet he told moses who art thou moses the voice answered i am that i am oh praise god hallelujah and then we see jesus on the earth many many years later and said i am that i am they said but you're a man only over 50 years less than 50 years old and say that you've seen abraham and he answered before abraham was i am and of course we know i am was the one that was in the burning bush of fire i am was the one that was the pillar of fire amen hallelujah i am that i am now back in the old testament from the generations of cain that wicked one came nimrod and nimrod was a wicked one himself for he went out and forced all of the little countries to come into one place and to build a great tower of course that tower was for the purpose of religious worship of trying to ascend into the presence of god without his invitation or without going by his provided way but with the spirit of rebellion wanting to enter into god's presence by his or their own way and of course it was religious worship at the tower of babel which we see friends that that was a type because that was the scene of denominational religion just where it came from and in this type if we are to study it we will see its end now the tower of babel was certainly a religion of course you know from bay belkin babylon from babylon we understand confusion chaos uh a massive mixture of confusing towns and there it was that god did not choose to put his name there for that was a symbol and type of mystery babylon it would mature and will mature to mystery babylon that is now under our sight of the prophetic telescope of the eyes of the true believer who looks into the word of god and sees today and sees beyond tomorrow and recognizing the ripeness of corruption and religious evil which is to be ripened under this mystery babylon it was religion but denominational religion it was a religion but not of god not finding its uh its origination in the word of god they it had no foundation but man-made foundations the might of the the uh what should i say the might of the cooperation and the union of man putting their mental physical all of their powers together to build this great mighty monument thinking that they could enter into the presence of god not going by his provided way but they all their own way that they think they have conceived in their own minds but in actual fact it was suggested and inserted and the wickedness of satan now we see here because it was not of the word of god mighty as it was glorious as it seemed god did not choose to put his name within a denomination or any denomination or any consul of denominations or group of denominations no matter how mighty no matter how numerous no matter how organized they were god did not choose to put his name within any denomination past present or that will rare its ugly beasts like head in the future but god has not chosen to put his name there amen hallelujah now god cannot put it could not put his name there amen because he said he will put his name in one place and that is the place that we should all look to and worship no wonder jesus said to the woman at the well the r is coming and now is you see you say we worship god in mongerism in uh samaria and the jews say we worship up here in jerusalem but the day is coming hallelujah oh my when it shall neither be there nor here but the true worshipper will worship god in spirit and in truth all blessed be his holy wonderful name amen glory to god hallelujah amen yes sir praise god so we see them each one of these denominations are promulgating the fact that they think they are the one they are the place where god choose to put his name put his power his spirit and all his benefits in them but that's contrary to the word of god and the question is still left unanswered but where did god put his name what is his name first of all and then where did he put it we'll have to find out what is god's name before we can find what it is where it is that he is going to be putting it in the first place so we've got to find out what his name is now we realize that while uh while we are talking about this let's move from nimrod and let's look at god in the old testament and let's look at that and see exactly what god has said in his word now god speaking in his word brother sister has told us clearly amen in deuteronomy he told them that he brought them up with the mighty hand out of the out of egypt and they were called the people of god until they came out of egypt and then they were called the church of god of course we know the word church means ecclesia or the called out wands let me repeat church means ecclesia or ecclesia means church which in turn means they called out ones called out of egypt then we're called out of denomination and called out of sin now called out once oh glory to god hallelujah they came out of egypt to be the church of god hallelujah for they could not be the church of god while they were in denomination while they were in egypt they had to come out first come out of her my people and be not partaker of our sins or else god said he'll have to judge you now let's look here friends we find out that god told them about the tabernacle and then later they built the temple and how god's name or presence would be in the midst of israel coming down in the form of the pillar of fire and settling down inside of the holy of holies above the ark of the covenant in the form of a pillar of fire and god said i'll choose the place of my worship i'll put my name there in that place hallelujah praise god and that's the only place god promised at that time in the old testament that he would meet with his people and they would be able to worship him bring up their offerings talk to him confess their sins make their sacrifices in that one place that he chose to put his name and where his chosen people could worship him and now of course we want to find out where that place is for jesus said it's not jerusalem it's not a terrorism at that time it was a jerusalem that god promised he would meet them and there are many uh many quotations in the bible that we may even mention this one uh you're using them whether the tribes go up and down because jerusalem is on a mountain amen and so whether the tribes go up and down praise god hallelujah so everyone wanting to make an offering make a sacrifice would have to go up to jerusalem bring the sacrifice to the high priest who would then offer it in the presence of god let me make at this time another observation that even the nation the great nation of israel god wanting people to know that he is aligning himself with them and that he is in their midst has allowed that nation to incorporate his name within the name of that nation israel meaning elohim people of the great elohim oh blessed be the name of our lord most high glory be to his marvelous name that god allowed his natural people to incorporate his name with their national name so that they can be forever identified as being a different people separated onto him for for his purposes and for the glory of his wonderful and his marvelous name oh praise god hallelujah how marvelous and wonderful that is brother sister now still in deuteronomy if god chose a place then it's important that we find out what he said about it and where it is i want to find out because i truly want to worship him and you should want to find out because you should want to know where to worship him and we are listening to this uh sermon or this service here today and i would believe some of us are mighty baptists some of us may be methodists some of us may be catholics some of us may be jehovah witness some of us may be christian science and many many names of the myriads of faiths so-called that are in the earth today but regardless of what you call yourself we are all seeking for the same thing and we are seeking for something we are seeking for that's to hit that spot or to arrive at that spot the place where god put his wonderful glorious name we want to know the truth for the bible said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free we want to know the place where it is for god had chosen to meet his people to worship him amen and it's right in your bible and thank god it's for all ages all ages and for all times so here we are at now glory to his marvelous and wonderful name now friends realize clearly that god met many people during the patriarchal times and the times of the prophets in many places some of them wherever he met them there would build an altar he'll meet them in deserts on mountains he'll meet them in various places god would meet them in a cave different places because that's different places but uh my friends and that's the way it was then because he was just coming to get his name his real name that would be known upon the face of the earth now of course we realize my friends that we are in the types and the shadows and we know that gabrielle called jesus or told mary that they should call his name jesus and i want you to know that jesus christ is god's tabernacle today amen israel had their temple and tabernacle back there the purifier came down settled in that tabernacle god placed his name there and the tribes had to go up and down to that tabernacle to worship god and to offer their sacrifices offerings and ask for their covering and cleansing from their sin at that place where god had placed his name now we see that jesus is god's tabernacle he is the place where god the great purifier himself came down and dwelt in him for you know the voice speaking from the heavens saying this is my beloved son harry him and so from him will comfort the word of god amen my beloved son yes my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell in god was announcing that he was now dwelling in this tabernacle called jesus and that was the place where he would put and had put and has put his name in jesus amen praise god so god tabernacled brought his great name and placed it upon jesus christ and that was the time when god for the first time put his name in a man that of course is a prophetic representation where god was showing what he would do in the future by spiritual multiplication after the planting of the seed that would be multiplied after that it was crucified of course his name was but in the man christ jesus his son who was in all of the types that they were speaking of in the old testament of all israel the temples the sacrifices the offerings the bread everything it was all a type of christ the veil everything was a type of jesus christ hallelujah amen and then the pair of fire will come down the smoke of god will fill the temple the fire of god would go into that tabernacle settle over the ark of the covenant and the voice of god would be heard thundering from it hallelujah the voice of god would be thundering out of that tabernacle i believe the voice of god thundered through the voice and person of jesus christ hallelujah and the old testament was only a type or symbol of what was to come in the new and when he came into jesus christ the bible says it sundered and the voice said this is my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell in thank god solomon could not build him a place of rest i'll choose the place where i choose to rest in and god chose jesus christ as his place where he would rest in and where he would put his name and where he would meet with man and talk to man and man would be able to worship him there at this place god chose the place god did not choose a denomination god did not choose anything else but he chose that his name would be on and in the man christ jesus all glory be to god forevermore hallelujah i praise him and magnified him gabriel call his name jesus the prophets call him jesus oh that wonderful name he was absolutely jesus before his birth even the holy prophet isaiah called him his name shall be called emmanuel which of course you know means god with us hallelujah god was going to manifest himself in the flesh to be among us and with us praise god to die for our sins and to take away the sins of the world and so doing he was given the name jesus amen so jesus is the name i say to you jesus is god's name for the jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new testament the name was placed in the man christ jesus remember look back to the symbiology god did not place his name in a denomination amen he placed it in a man which was the symbol that the day will come when he would place his name and place his power his presence his spirit in the midst of all mankind that he had chosen to put his name in glory be to his marvelous name hallelujah amen yes sir so where we are to worship get in the spirit of christ and that is a place where we are to worship him i hope you're right in the spirit now as we uh talk about him and we we glorify him in his word let us worship and magnify his great name hallelujah oh praise god i don't care no matter if you remember methodist a baptist a catholic a protestant whatever you are i may be there is only one place that we care we can correctly worship god and not there not there not over there not necessarily in even my church or anyone else's church or any denominational name but we are to worship in christ but that is the place where we should be worshiping god romans chapter 8 verse 1 for there is no no no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen friends we can differ oh on on creeds on on dogmas on doctrines on on this or in that or man-made series uh you can uh it's your desire if you want to go to a matter of this church or you want to be faithful in the baptist church or you want to be a catholic or anything like that but once you are genuinely born of his spirit and you recognize him to be in him friends you become a member of his glorious body and then there is no difference hallelujah but the true believers are one in christ wherever they may be how god will deal with them where he'll bring them from east west north south that's not my affair that is not my business whether they stay whether they come whether they go that is god's affair but the main thing is that we get into christ and let him take control blessed be his holy name hallelujah and then all the walls of partition all those walls of separation through denomination god tears them down through the blood of jesus christ through the holy spirit the anointing of the living god he takes away all the walls of petition and differences because we are in christ jesus and we are here to worship god in spirit and in truth hallelujah amen because it's god's plan for us to worship him genuinely and truly in spirit and in the truth all glory to god forevermore hallelujah i bless him i magnify him and i give him all the praise and all the honor and the glory and all this a place of god chose to put his name amen we know there's a lot of different places as i've mentioned before in the bible where individuals met with god but that individual place where let's say jacob met him in the wilderness making his pillow a stone elijah met him and talked with him in a cave other ones met him by a mulberry bush wherever the place that is where god met that in that person individually but he mentioned that he would have one place where he would put his name and we are have established and are establishing that the place he plays but his name is in jesus christ so i don't know of any different different places that god promised to meet people today because at that time they made altars and maybe they had spots which were called amongst the greek uh oracles and whenever a prophet almighty man of god did a great work they tend to want to make that spot or place holy they want to make that spot that mountain that little hill that cave or or whatever they want to call it sacred listen in our modern terms we find out that god has not promised to meet anyone at any shrine made by man let me repeat god has not promised to meet any one of us at any time at any kind of a man-made shrine no spot nor place is holy or sacred no oracle no special prayer cave becomes holy and sacred no spot whether it be in italy whether it be down in the united states whether it be in brazil whether it be in africa there is no special place that we can go and that is a all healing waters are over here oh there's a healing tree over there there is healing in this spot no all is in christ amen oh praise god there are operations where god might meet a person in their faith but the official announced place that god has commanded to meet us is in the name of our lord jesus christ oh hallelujah blessed be his marvelous and wonderful name so we are not to the look at god that we're going to meet god in a certain certain cave or if i go to this certain certain church if i go to this holy church whoa the church is so holy it's so sacred it's not the church we are called by the word to meet god in christ so if you have never met the lord jesus christ if you've never asked your forgiveness of sins if you have not made your sacrifices to him if you have not made your life a living sacrifice to him you are yet to meet him let me invite you my friend to obey the word of god and come to him for your cleansing come to him for your sacrifices come to him make all of your prayers talk to him jesus christ glory to god hallelujah amen praise god we ought to recognize we are not christians just because we are protestants neither are we christian because we are catholic you're not a christian because you're a methodist a baptist a presbyterian a pentecostal you're a christian because you've repented of your sins god has opened his word to you and you've been baptized not in his titles but in the name of the lord and savior jesus christ we're there not just by water but where there is only one god one father one lord one baptism amen and that is the holy spouse baptism upon you that inducts you into baptism water baptism only inducts you into fellowship hallelujah of the local body praise god but the baptism of the holy spirit inducts you into the body of christ into christ hallelujah in other words the baptist holy spirit brings you into the truth and opens up the word of god to you that you might recognize him that he is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah my friends egypt exodus chapter 12. we find in egypt there was one place that death could not strike there hallelujah praise god only one place that death could not strike foreshadowing the coming of a real place where god would meet his people and his people could meet him and death could not strike them there you know the answer to that oh under the blood of jesus christ you've got to be under the blood then i will pass i will pass over you god will pass over you praise god hallelujah we find friends christ was foreshadowed in all of those types the sacrificial lamb a lamb without spot and without blemish must be killed by the elders how the blood must be sprinkled at the door foreshadowing the coming of christ amen hallelujah and under his shed blood that is where god meets with the true and when the death angel pass and our day when the second death tries to pass god promised he'll have to pass over you because the blood is upon the doorways your post of your heart amen i believe friends we're in a time now where we're ready to go out in a third exodus out of egypt again hallelujah i believe right about now it's about rapture time we're ready to go first into the promised land of the newfound revealed word of god through the voice of god in his last days amen and it's time we got into the right place together by his grace and his love and quit this kind of a fussing around and self-arrogance and elevation uh oh we've got this and we've got that and oh my god i'm a presbyterian i'll make you know i'm a baptist i'm a this i'm a that i'm a message believer i'm this or the other get out of that and get yourself into christ get into the real place where the spirit of god can make himself known to you doesn't matter who you are amen because of any other place there is death in any other place outside of jesus christ oh hallelujah oh my yes sir the i tell you friends as it was back there that that angel could not strike where there was the blood of the lamb revelation amen we find it a revelation where there john said then it's revelation 5 where who is worthy to uptake this book and open the seals thereof and none was worthy no man upon the earth regardless of his high positions regardless of whatever or whoever he wanted to call himself the bible says no man born in sin and and iniquity was worthy to take this book but there came a lamb one a bloody bleeding lamb as it was slain a lamb that was in a battle amen i believe that lamb was the lamb christ jesus who had a battle against satan on calvary down into descending into hell preaching to the spirits that were in prison taking captivity captive and giving gifts unto men rising up and going back into the presence of the house of god taking his seat sat down it's silly it's finished it's over it it's done hallelujah amen to take up his meditatorial ministry and to carry on the word of god there's only one place that death cannot strike today it cannot strike the word it can not strike the world hallelujah that can't strike it because it's the living word of god amen it lives forever and uh evermore for heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away glory be to god hallelujah oh praise god praise god praise god hallelujah uh brother sister listen to this amen a pillar of fire talking to moses in the burning bush tell them in all generations i am that i am then over thousand year or years or more after jesus stood up in the great feast and said i am that i am you see what condescension bringing us redemption that in the dead of the night of sin amen god came down and made himself into flesh that flesh was not another god but the god the eternal spirit needed a body to make himself manifest and to die for the sins of man god was in christ hallelujah reconciling the world to whom himself the bible tells us and so here he was i am that i am oh praise god hallelujah here he was forcing a pair of fire then he comes down in a virgin-born body amen and called that body his son god was in his son the father was in his son the father that lived in me he dwecked the works working his way down into the rest of mankind hallelujah and reveal himself to sinful man unbelieving man by regenerating them and living in the entire church body of the living god oh there's a wonderful old song that you might like to hear the words of it goes like this i am that spoke to moses in a burning bush of fire i am the god of abraham the bright and morning star i am the rose of sharon oh whence do you say that i came do you know my father or can you tell his name or who do you say that i am or from whence do you say that i came do you know my father can you tell his name i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i am the holy o creation and jesus is my name oh glory to god for that wonderful name of jesus the sweetest name on earth is the name of jesus the heavenly name the glorious name the name of god the place where god chose to put his name was in jesus christ hallelujah that is why his name is jesus which means jehovah has become our savior the jehovah of the old testament has now made himself and morphed and manifested in jesus christ and he has become our savior oh glory to god how marvelous that revelation prince amen you can't get that from theologians it doesn't come that way at all amen it comes by revelation god making himself known to you giving you the understanding by the vain revelation jesus and god the father being the same very same person can only come to you by revelation no three gods four gods two gods or a million gods but one god and jesus is his name the whole bible is built and founded upon revelation the whole church of the living god is built upon revelation matthew 17 says for i say unto you upon this rock spiritual rock of course spiritual revelation of course i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it oh glory to god so god placed his name first in israel then god israel and then god placed his name in jesus jehovah becoming our savior and now let me mention naturally any man will understand that any person will understand it the next place any man will put his name he'll give his name to his wife or he'll place his name on his house that is where the natural man what plays his name he'll place his name on his entire family of his children there will carry his name he'll place his name there listen i want to quote the last name prophet william marion branham there are many fine women in this building here tonight fine loyal women but there's only one mistress william branham many many there's only one that is going home with me tonight all glory be to god spiritually thinking now only one is going home with me tonight and that is the one that has my name she is the one that is my wife and there's fine wonderful people my friends and many other churches out there many of the denominations out there wonderful marvelous people amen and god bless their heart but there's only one mrs jesus christ only one called out once chosen once elected by his divine will and to fulfill his divine purpose hallelujah and that is who he is coming for as the psalms said come and go with me to my father's house i've prepared a place for you that where i am you may be also oh praise god a bridegroom is coming jesus is coming the boss's son is coming and he's taking us out of here it's rapture time it's time for us to go home oh glory to god it's evening time it's later than you take oh the coming of the lord is at hand blessed be his holy name oh praise god there is a place where what real worship is hallelujah get in her in her midst get with her enter into true worship with her glory to god because in her and in her alone is where true worship is at this time hallelujah hey praise god hallelujah amen lord god all we do in word or indeed paul said we do it in the name of jesus christ and again paul said acts chapter 2 be it known unto you this day there is not another name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of jesus christ and again the bible says the highest heaven is named after him for in his name all heaven the family in heaven is named jesus and all the family of god on the earth is named jesus hallelujah so god's chosen name is where we should worship him and his chosen people is where he is now in this last day the body of christ when he was one individual he placed the name there and now it's the same body but in a bright form or hallelujah or a wife form and that's where he has placed his name in this day and in this hour there is no other name given under heaven among men whereby we must be saved jesus for that's the name of god's power of redemption hallelujah amen god has all other titles of rapha and and and you know jiren so on hallelujah but praise god many titles but all those titles are wrapped up together and compounded into one name it's the name of jesus devil scream and come out at the name of jesus the seeker healed at the name of jesus the lamb walk again the plain sea the death here at the name of jesus for at the name of jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess hallelujah all these various churches have all kinds of names but don't trust in those names the only name you can trust in and should trust in hallelujah is in the name of jesus christ jesus said well you know my name is john simon pastor john simon i come in my father's name because simon is my father's name so i come in his name so what jesus was saying when he said i come in my father's name and his name is jesus so his father's name is also jesus we must recognize that he came in his father's name amen hallelujah so the place where people are to meet god is in christ not in a denomination not at a shrine not in a holy cave a holy hill not some holy place a holy prayer mountain that is not where we are to meet with the living god but to meet him in jesus christ listen as his wife as his people we are his flesh as it says in genesis and again in the new testament flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone because we were in jesus christ at calvary and flesh of his flesh hallelujah and name of his name for at antioch they were called christians christians shall we bear his name and we are not ashamed to bear his name we will bear the shame the reproach for the word of god and carry the name of jesus proudly upon us because we are we have the ring of righteousness upon our finger we have the robe of righteousness upon our back we are now waiting now for the chariot ride of the rapture to take us out of here into the divine presence of the living god do you know my father can you tell me what is his name oh praise god the great of fire in the burning bush of fire o praise god forevermore god in the father god and the son god in the holy ghost god the only one who praised god god when the lightning flashing god when the thunder roll god all over creation the same god down in my soul blessed be his holy and glorious name we come in the name of jesus christ and for the glory of god amen amen so we understand now that god's present day flesh is not that jesus that was back there he used that body jesus one man but jesus said except by going to the ground the corn of wheat will abide alone but if it grows in the ground and resurrect it'll come back a thousand fold and so on so here we are so satan made a terrible mistake on the day of pentecost because he ended up instead of one jesus he ended up with a whole lot of them running all over the country and spreading the word of god that jesus preached to bring the people to his glorious name hallelujah thank god we today we have put on the name of heaven heaven on earth we are carrying god's family name upon us hallelujah thank god let me my friends begin to close with this thought here today just be patient with me in this moment the inspiration of the holy spirit upon this word of the living god for you to recognize and see clearly that god chose you and i in this hour to place his name with us upon us and to use us for his glory and for his honor not just as individuals but together as the body of jesus christ through which he can live manifest make known his name his life his word his light and his power right through us amen now we know that the great name appeared and it is called or interpreted j b h u they could not pronounce it they did not know fully what it meant all the expressions on all the understanding of all that that meant j v h and so they called him jehovah jehovah genesis 2 amen when god said i am in other words i jehovah what did that mean i am the self-existent one who has created something off of myself let me repeat i am the self-existing one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine a child of mine created something to be an amateur or an amateur god hallelujah amen see or praise god so he gave man god gave man that position that if he is born again cleansed by the spirit in filled by the genuine holy ghost i'm not talking about some pentecostal uh baptism of the holy ghost but i'm talking about a real holy spirit baptism that illuminates the word lights up the pages of the bible and god becomes his own interpreter making his word plain to you and makes you into an amateur common g or d because god is capital g o d our heavenly father amen and made us who we are amen praise god so god is not self-existent anymore he is not just yahweh anymore his name is jesus hallelujah and now he exists with his family here on the earth this great one who was called elohim allah allah elohim oh praise god forevermore he was jehovah jehovah the one who exists with his family that he is made off of himself the mystery of god now revealed from the entire bible oh praise god forevermore all part of himself he made into an amateur god hallelujah amen so and god made his children to predominate over the entire earth to have dominion so earth was was and is man's dominion according to scripture his domain and god made him to be a common or small god amateur god over the entire earth hallelujah he could speak and it would be so he could say this and it would be done
