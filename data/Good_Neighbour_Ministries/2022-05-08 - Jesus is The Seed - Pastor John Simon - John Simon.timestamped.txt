[29:16] the lord good to see the brothers amen
[29:20] god bless us today
[29:22] because we come to worship him
[29:25] we come to adore him
[29:27] and magnify him
[29:29] the one whom we don't see with our eyes
[29:33] but by faith we
[29:35] feel him and sense him
[29:37] within the heart
[29:39] hallelujah
[29:41] oh praise god
[29:43] thank you lord
[29:45] oh my praise god
[29:47] shall we look to the word of god
[29:50] amen
[29:56] galatians chapter 3
[29:59] reading from verses
[30:01] 6
[30:02] to
[30:03] 9.
[30:05] amen
[30:06] praise god
[30:08] hallelujah
[30:13] it reads thus
[30:16] even as abraham
[30:19] believed god
[30:21] and
[30:22] it was accounted to him
[30:25] for righteousness
[30:33] know he
[30:34] therefore
[30:36] that they which are of faith
[30:40] the same
[30:42] are the children of abraham
[30:45] and the scriptures for seeing
[30:49] that god
[30:50] would justify
[30:52] the heathen
[30:54] through the faith through faith
[30:57] justifying the heathen the eden is
[31:00] talking about the seven church ages
[31:02] that's when they he didn't start coming
[31:05] in right
[31:07] but justify
[31:09] them by faith preached
[31:11] before the gospel unto abraham
[31:15] amen so in the gospel was preached to
[31:17] abraham
[31:19] amen
[31:20] by revelation of course
[31:22] god let him foresee and whatever amen
[31:26] in thee shall all
[31:30] nations be blessed
[31:32] so then
[31:34] they which be of
[31:36] faith
[31:38] are blessed
[31:39] with the faithful
[31:41] abraham
[31:42] praise god because they are
[31:45] manifesting the same qualities
[31:49] that he had
[31:51] he
[31:52] abraham believed god
[31:55] by faith
[31:56] like i always he didn't have a written
[31:58] bible what was it he believed
[32:01] but you see
[32:03] the spirit of god
[32:05] manifests himself and reveals his word
[32:09] to those individuals that he has elected
[32:12] before the foundations of the world
[32:16] and this same quality has come back now
[32:20] to individuals
[32:22] and believers in this last age
[32:26] to be able to believe like abraham
[32:29] believed
[32:30] therefore god conquest them as children
[32:34] of abraham
[32:36] praise god let's pray and then we'll go
[32:37] into the word and god will make that
[32:40] better for us and clear it for us praise
[32:42] the lord father we thank you
[32:45] for the reading of the written word
[32:48] but you know we come here
[32:51] to serve worship adore and honor
[32:54] the living word
[32:56] the spirit of the word spirit of the
[32:58] letter lord
[33:00] that that lives that caused this
[33:03] written word to live again
[33:06] lord jesus bless us here today
[33:09] for we gather in your name
[33:11] under the great and blessed anointing of
[33:14] the holy spirit
[33:16] so we ask father that you will
[33:19] bless us now take glory and honor in
[33:22] jesus name amen and amen god bless you
[33:25] please be seated
[33:26] hallelujah
[33:28] amen
[33:30] the last
[33:31] time
[33:32] we were here together
[33:36] we spoke
[33:38] touching on certain themes
[33:41] called fro from the dust
[33:44] of the earth
[33:45] and we talked about the waving of the
[33:48] sheath
[33:49] the word of god coming to
[33:52] full maturity
[33:55] in this last day
[33:57] the accumulation of the word revelation
[33:59] through the ages
[34:01] come to the point where the word has
[34:04] come back to its full maturity
[34:08] in other words a seed was planted in the
[34:10] ground and there on golgotha's hill
[34:14] and that seed went through its cycle
[34:18] of the seasons of the church ages amen
[34:21] you know the summer
[34:23] and spring and and and so on right right
[34:27] to the fall and winter and then rise
[34:30] again and here we are
[34:32] the word coming back
[34:34] seed back to seed amen praise god see
[34:39] and there we are now the word is back to
[34:42] its original
[34:44] maturity
[34:47] right the mature word was who jesus
[34:50] christ
[34:51] he was the full matured word
[34:54] and so now he has come back to his full
[34:58] majority
[34:59] praise god that the prophet said
[35:02] remember
[35:03] in the restoration of the bride
[35:07] it's
[35:08] not just
[35:09] justification
[35:11] for justification makes way
[35:14] for sanctification
[35:16] it has to move out the way when
[35:17] sanctification comes
[35:19] sanctification made way
[35:22] for the baptism of the holy spirit
[35:25] but now he says
[35:27] the
[35:28] the baptism of the holy ghost makes way
[35:31] for the holy ghost himself
[35:35] that is what we're talking about
[35:37] and that is the thin veil deception
[35:41] religious reception that has caught
[35:45] and envelops the minds and hearts of
[35:47] many brothers and sisters that they do
[35:51] not recognize it's not in the so-called
[35:55] baptism of the holy spirit that's though
[35:57] even though that is of god and that is
[36:00] wonderful
[36:02] but coming to the place of recognizing
[36:05] and uh
[36:07] having the person of christ
[36:10] revealed to you and indwelling you
[36:13] showing you that he's indwelling you
[36:15] praise the lord
[36:17] hallelujah everything i'm saying there
[36:19] you know um we can go off on them and
[36:22] spend a long time so i better move on
[36:26] amen
[36:28] well we talked about the
[36:30] full maturity of the word now not in the
[36:33] flesh anymore but he came back as the
[36:36] holy spirit
[36:37] and now
[36:39] he's waving himself above the church of
[36:43] the living god in the last day
[36:45] praise god and as the wave sheath is
[36:49] waved he is waving it over the
[36:52] attribute sons
[36:55] of the spirit
[36:57] of almighty god hallelujah amen
[37:01] all them attribute sons
[37:04] that have
[37:05] and are
[37:06] living
[37:07] in the dust of the earth
[37:10] amongst these billions of people like
[37:12] dust
[37:13] amen
[37:14] and
[37:15] god is waving the word above them
[37:20] to catch their attention
[37:23] that they come back to the world
[37:26] because they are not of the pentecostal
[37:29] age
[37:30] they may see signs he want to see
[37:33] miracles but they are not attracted
[37:36] by that
[37:38] they are only attracted their thirst
[37:41] their hunger for the bread of life they
[37:44] test for the ever-present waters from
[37:46] the rock it draws them into the presence
[37:49] of almighty god
[37:50] hallelujah they can't deny what they're
[37:54] seeing
[37:55] they can't deny their own heart
[37:58] because they recognize
[38:00] and they recognize that this is their
[38:03] day
[38:04] they recognize this is their message
[38:08] and now they're acting upon that message
[38:12] that they have received by revelation
[38:15] through the holy spirit amen
[38:18] hallelujah
[38:20] now
[38:20] them attribute sons were laying in the
[38:23] dust of the earth
[38:25] you know the scripture i should and
[38:27] every preacher knows it ashes washes
[38:29] dust the dust from the dust you came to
[38:31] the dust you will return it's in the
[38:34] bibles in the message everywhere that is
[38:37] an accepted fact we come from dirt
[38:39] cosmic lights and everything else
[38:41] chemicals in the earth we're going back
[38:44] to the earth if we die amen but when
[38:47] god's spirit looks down
[38:50] searching for those attributes sons and
[38:52] daughters that was scattered among the
[38:56] billions of the dust of the earth here
[38:59] praise god and living in the dust and
[39:02] the earth then we understand that
[39:05] only the spirit
[39:07] can energize the world
[39:10] so the spirit comes to energize the
[39:14] world
[39:16] energize the seed worm
[39:19] like the seed that was laying in the in
[39:22] the coffin in in egypt and then they put
[39:26] moisture on it and behold after a
[39:29] thousand three thousand years them seeds
[39:32] come back to life amen praise god that's
[39:35] the same thing god is doing he hid the
[39:38] life in the seed they read the seed in
[39:40] the dirt but at the season and time god
[39:43] sends the latter reigns of the spirit
[39:46] the teaching reign of the prophet and it
[39:49] moisturizes and bring about oh my those
[39:53] seeds come back to life hallelujah
[39:56] energized
[39:58] by the
[39:59] word of god hallelujah amen praise god
[40:04] so we are thankful to god for all these
[40:08] sons object of the attributes
[40:12] of god
[40:13] who come and we're here upon
[40:17] the earth praise god quickening us
[40:21] back to
[40:22] our
[40:23] resurrection
[40:25] praise god because that quickening by
[40:28] the spirit
[40:29] raising up them sons and daughters from
[40:32] the dust of the earth that is our
[40:36] resurrection
[40:37] that's why he said don't you recognize
[40:40] you are already resurrected
[40:43] this physical body can't do nothing else
[40:45] but go in the event of the resurrection
[40:49] when that takes place
[40:51] but your resurrection spiritually is
[40:54] right now
[40:55] it's taken place
[40:57] by the holy ghost amen and believe me oh
[41:01] i believe i am speaking by the holy
[41:04] ghost i believe i'm delivering this to
[41:07] you by the holy ghost
[41:10] not an imagination of a religious spirit
[41:13] but by the anointing of the blessed holy
[41:16] spirit of almighty god amen oh blessed
[41:19] be the name of the lord hallelujah amen
[41:23] so he sent the
[41:25] spirit to energize the word sent the
[41:28] dynamics to
[41:30] uh manifest the mechanics
[41:33] praise god hallelujah amen praise god
[41:37] hallelujah so i thank god that we
[41:40] it's not looking for our bodies to come
[41:45] from a literal grave down the road
[41:48] but to recognize right now what the holy
[41:51] spirit is doing and the misconception
[41:54] that but the church ages have taught the
[41:57] people to look for bodies raising up
[42:00] with gums on and slowly going up in the
[42:03] air and god says he's coming as a thief
[42:09] before your voice happened
[42:12] it's gone
[42:13] you're left behind
[42:15] that twinkling of an eye that's only
[42:18] that's just this left now
[42:20] just like that
[42:21] but the rapture and the resurrection
[42:23] already take place and taking place in
[42:26] many inside us right now oh praise god
[42:31] forevermore hallelujah oh my my mind
[42:35] listen let me go now to what we're
[42:38] talking about here today of course we
[42:41] know that jesus is the seed
[42:45] not a seed
[42:47] but he is the seed
[42:49] and the
[42:50] various seeds
[42:52] come from the seed
[42:55] amen so when isaiah prophesied and said
[42:58] he shall see his seed
[43:01] in their generation whatever age they're
[43:04] supposed to come up in but he will see
[43:06] the seeds that are predestinated for
[43:10] that time hallelujah remember says the
[43:14] prophet's morning and church age
[43:16] jesus is
[43:18] this seed
[43:20] and
[43:21] with him is counted
[43:24] this seed children
[43:26] praise god
[43:27] because his seed children are in him
[43:32] us and their children of the promise
[43:37] hallelujah and you see promise has to do
[43:40] with election
[43:42] promise has to do with the choosing of
[43:45] god
[43:47] hallelujah these are the royal seeds of
[43:52] abraham
[43:54] they are the ones that are elect of god
[43:59] and therefore means that they were
[44:02] already foreknown of god
[44:05] and predestinated
[44:07] by the living god
[44:09] and they were in the mind of god and in
[44:14] his thoughts of god hallelujah in plain
[44:18] language then
[44:20] the true bride of christ was in the mind
[44:23] of god
[44:25] eternally
[44:28] hallelujah
[44:30] but were never expressed hallelujah we
[44:34] were in this thoughts eternally oh
[44:37] blessed be god forevermore amen see
[44:41] all though they were not expressed
[44:45] until
[44:46] each one came forth in their designated
[44:51] and decreed age he's a seasoned age
[44:56] hallelujah
[44:57] everyone
[44:59] had to come in a designated age
[45:03] is that right
[45:04] so if your attraction was to be
[45:09] justification
[45:10] the people of that age that were
[45:12] designated for that age that would be
[45:15] their pool
[45:17] and that would pull them
[45:19] into the neck of god's spirit
[45:22] but
[45:23] that's not our attraction
[45:25] that's what every time you hear in
[45:27] repeating repeating that's what he was
[45:28] trying to get the people to understand
[45:30] he says you you
[45:32] you're in this age you can't go even if
[45:35] luther were to come here and preach to
[45:38] you it wouldn't mean much to you it
[45:40] won't pull you
[45:42] if if wesley any of those other ages
[45:46] pentecost wonderful as they are you will
[45:49] not have a pull on you
[45:51] because that's not the age you were
[45:54] decreed and designated for
[45:57] you designated for this age this is your
[46:00] time
[46:01] this is your day
[46:03] your hour
[46:06] you were shaped for this
[46:08] you were born for this
[46:10] god placed you in the season
[46:13] oh praise god hallelujah oh my amen so
[46:18] you become manifested when you were in
[46:21] this mind you were not expressed
[46:23] but when he sent a prophet and the
[46:25] prophet spoke the word them thoughts
[46:28] that expressed through that word that
[46:32] was lost and then restored yet
[46:35] by those prophets the son of man
[46:38] expressed in the form of a prophet
[46:40] gathered
[46:51] that is the reason why we are here
[46:55] physical representation
[46:58] of the invisible spoken word
[47:01] oh praise god hallelujah you are the
[47:04] real me you can't see the real you i
[47:07] can't see is that right we can't see but
[47:10] but that's the man that's been restored
[47:13] that's the man that woke up from his
[47:16] sleep amen that's the person praise god
[47:20] i rise now that sleepiness
[47:23] and he will give you the light amen
[47:25] you're sleeping in the dust of the earth
[47:27] the spirit of god is here to wake up
[47:30] every soul every life and every mind
[47:33] back to the word
[47:34] back to the original cape
[47:36] amen glory to god hallelujah amen so
[47:41] each member
[47:43] comes forth in their decreed season
[47:46] and become expressed or manifested
[47:51] which is same as saying manifested
[47:54] and then
[47:56] take its place within the body
[48:00] so this right then
[48:02] is the literal spoken word
[48:06] seed bride of jesus christ
[48:10] hallelujah oh my and though she
[48:14] is called feminine
[48:17] in designation
[48:19] she is called the body of christ
[48:24] for remember it is a pirate that she
[48:27] ought to be called that for she was
[48:31] predestinated and he got it here
[48:33] predestinated
[48:35] in him
[48:37] coming from the same source
[48:41] that he come from
[48:43] and therefore she was always eternal
[48:47] with him
[48:49] now and is now manifesting god
[48:54] but now in a many-membered
[48:57] body
[48:59] whereas once god only manifested it in
[49:04] one
[49:05] member
[49:06] called jesus christ
[49:08] now he is manifesting it in a
[49:11] many-membered
[49:12] body
[49:14] the revealing of the son of man in the
[49:16] book of acts one person the one person
[49:19] on the earth again in the time of jesus
[49:22] but now the son of man is supposed to
[49:25] reveal again
[49:28] hallelujah
[49:29] in this time of uh that looks like a
[49:32] time of lot and law to be revealed again
[49:36] and he is being revealed again for he is
[49:39] in the sons of men that were
[49:42] predestinated in the dust of the ark and
[49:45] now called forth to life by the power of
[49:48] the holy spirit amen oh my the husband
[49:53] or the head of the body was by himself
[49:56] then but now the entire body is called
[50:00] in other words he he was not complete
[50:03] without her
[50:05] like a man is not complete without his
[50:08] wife praise god
[50:10] now the fourth seal
[50:13] do you know god is like a big contractor
[50:19] he lays out all his material
[50:22] and he lays them out on the earth see
[50:26] back then brother bran speaking like
[50:28] this
[50:30] how does that sound he's just talking
[50:31] about the contractor and how the man is
[50:33] going to build a house and then lays out
[50:35] his materials on the earth but there is
[50:37] not the real understanding of what that
[50:40] really means
[50:41] amen
[50:43] then
[50:44] he begins to build his buildings
[50:48] now
[50:49] before there was ever a grain of seed on
[50:53] the earth
[50:54] before the sun even struck the earth
[50:58] your body was already laying on the
[51:02] earth
[51:04] amen
[51:05] hallelujah
[51:07] oh my because
[51:10] you are the dust of the earth
[51:13] hallelujah
[51:15] yes you are the dust of the earth and
[51:19] god is the contractor
[51:22] now
[51:23] the way he was going to do it now what
[51:27] he's going to talk about is how god was
[51:30] going to bring forth his sons and
[51:32] daughters
[51:33] i'll give you a quick thing but then
[51:35] i'll go back to the quote but then show
[51:37] how eve
[51:39] contaminated the bloodline
[51:42] or
[51:43] interrupted the program of god
[51:46] and god had to have a plan to restore
[51:50] back that bloodline
[51:53] amen back to the word amen
[51:57] remember
[51:59] see
[52:00] god was i'm sure you how he was going to
[52:03] do it
[52:04] was to reach down
[52:07] and like he did with adam and get a
[52:10] bunch of earth calcium potash
[52:14] cosmic light
[52:15] and then the spirit
[52:20] there is my other son
[52:23] amen
[52:24] then he'd bring up some more some more
[52:27] some more and
[52:30] there's another one there's another one
[52:34] that's how he was going to do it
[52:37] by his spoken word
[52:40] there is a son there is another one
[52:43] there's enough by his spoken word
[52:46] by his creative voice
[52:50] but what did eve do no she corrupted the
[52:54] way of it
[52:56] and she brought forth that through a
[52:59] sexual act
[53:01] then
[53:02] gets tracked
[53:04] now
[53:06] what is god doing now
[53:08] he still got so many of them seeds down
[53:11] there
[53:12] and they are predestinated
[53:14] what's he going to do
[53:16] see in other words the rest of us got
[53:19] trapped
[53:21] we all got trapped because the whole
[53:24] plan got interrupted
[53:26] and we got trapped in these physical
[53:29] bodies
[53:30] and there we are praise god
[53:33] but then you see
[53:36] amen many seeds of them that's
[53:38] predestinated
[53:39] oh my so much of them predestinated
[53:43] but then at the end time now
[53:46] he won't go back saying eve
[53:49] bear another child another mortal child
[53:52] like that no
[53:54] he'll just again he'll go back to
[54:00] that spoken word
[54:02] is that right creative voice
[54:04] seven thunders he'll go right back to
[54:07] his original plan once the people start
[54:10] to catch the revelation of his original
[54:12] intention then he goes back to his
[54:15] original plan
[54:17] i say go back he doesn't have to go back
[54:20] it's always there it's just that we
[54:22] didn't understand that catch it
[54:25] so he'll he'll just say
[54:28] and call
[54:30] amen he'll call that means spoken word
[54:34] there and then
[54:36] we'll answer i'll answer that's all
[54:39] that's what it is that's the idea see
[54:42] how simple
[54:43] amen but god hides in simplicity
[54:47] and reveals himself in the same
[54:50] so
[54:50] we you and i before we have come to the
[54:53] revelation of the lord
[54:55] you
[54:56] the spirit of god
[54:58] was just waving over you and on the
[55:01] voice from the word
[55:03] called out amen and when it called out
[55:06] to you amen you answered the call he
[55:09] said and i'll answer when i hear that
[55:11] i'll answer praise god when you heard it
[55:14] you answered the word you answered you
[55:17] responded to the call of the word of god
[55:20] hallelujah
[55:21] amen when and then when that last one
[55:26] hears it and is brought in that settles
[55:29] it
[55:30] amen
[55:31] amen
[55:32] bringing them souls out of prison
[55:35] by the preaching of the world preaching
[55:38] to souls that are imprisoned now
[55:42] amen bringing them out and taking them
[55:45] with him back to where he was amen so as
[55:50] we predestinated where of course i
[55:52] repeat again for retention uh we're
[55:55] trapped in this mortal bodies because of
[55:58] eve's sin
[56:01] but in the end time
[56:03] god promised he is not going to go along
[56:06] with that satan-inspired plan
[56:09] that satan put down here
[56:12] but
[56:13] and he's not going to have more children
[56:16] by sex relations
[56:18] but he's going to have more children by
[56:21] revelations
[56:22] the revelation of the word will bring
[56:26] his children back to the original plan
[56:29] and thought in other words he will
[56:31] resume his original plan
[56:34] by the holy spirit
[56:37] praise god and when that last
[56:40] seed child
[56:41] that was trapped in a mortal body
[56:44] is called out by revelation
[56:49] through the spoken word of god
[56:52] then
[56:53] that last seed is then expressed or
[56:57] amen
[56:58] and christ's body
[57:01] will then be complete
[57:03] male and female together again
[57:07] by invisible union hallelujah they're
[57:10] brought together again
[57:13] blessed be the name of the lord for seal
[57:17] that was now uh we are going to talk
[57:21] about the token is that all right
[57:25] amen
[57:26] so then
[57:27] that there could be no mistake
[57:30] the seed of this life natural life must
[57:35] be planted in the earth
[57:37] but this body that is in is a perishable
[57:40] body
[57:42] see
[57:43] and the life if it's a perverted life in
[57:46] that seed it will then have to perish
[57:50] with that seed
[57:51] oh my
[57:53] but when that body has he put eternal
[57:55] life into it
[57:57] oh there's a big difference do you
[57:59] believe that
[58:00] hallelujah and identify that life in
[58:04] that as his own
[58:07] praise god
[58:08] that is that in the resurrection he'd
[58:12] raise it up again and nothing of them
[58:16] will be lost
[58:17] i said nothing will be lost
[58:20] praise god oh my there it is it cannot
[58:25] perish
[58:26] see
[58:27] because
[58:28] his life lays over it
[58:31] praise god oh my when you use that term
[58:34] you remember um is it elijah elijah
[58:38] elijah and the boy that died amen is
[58:41] using that kind of imagery for you to
[58:44] understand his life lays over that sea
[58:50] lays over it
[58:53] for
[58:54] it
[58:55] is
[58:56] a token
[58:59] and if you look how it's written here
[59:01] capital t it's part of god himself
[59:06] is that right
[59:07] and so
[59:09] he lives over that little body
[59:13] and he repeats it now again but listen
[59:15] how he says it yes he lays
[59:20] his life over that soul
[59:24] that person
[59:27] there is a token over there
[59:31] the holy spirit
[59:35] that that belongs to god
[59:39] then that is when he said when i see
[59:41] that token
[59:43] i will pass over you
[59:46] hallelujah what is why it's a positive
[59:50] token
[59:51] the holy spirit is our token
[59:55] therefore when you receive the holy
[59:58] ghost
[59:59] you have passed from death to life
[1:00:01] that's all there is to it cause the life
[1:00:04] is in you
[1:00:06] you can no more
[1:00:09] perish hallelujah what god what is the
[1:00:12] prophet is talking about using the
[1:00:14] typology and imagery of exodus there
[1:00:18] when god said stay in the house
[1:00:21] the blood will lay right over the door
[1:00:24] his blood types life will lay over the
[1:00:27] door and when the death angel passes and
[1:00:31] he sees that life or blood laying over
[1:00:34] the door i'll pass over you
[1:00:38] type of these last days
[1:00:40] when his life lays over that seed
[1:00:43] protecting it and preserving it as a
[1:00:46] designated time that it's woke up
[1:00:50] it's brought to life hallelujah and he's
[1:00:53] telling the
[1:00:54] angel of spiritual
[1:00:57] death
[1:00:58] don't touch that one
[1:01:01] don't you touch that one hallelujah i'm
[1:01:05] that one i'm passing over that's a royal
[1:01:08] seed that's a predestinated seed amen so
[1:01:11] you project you're protected
[1:01:14] from death
[1:01:15] spiritual death
[1:01:17] and damnation
[1:01:19] while you are in the house of the holy
[1:01:23] spirit
[1:01:24] covered by his life
[1:01:26] hallelujah not talking about being in
[1:01:28] the natural
[1:01:29] building like there were and then they
[1:01:32] were protected by not going out the
[1:01:34] building but you are staying in christ
[1:01:37] and you are protected from the angel of
[1:01:40] death that is going out now as you can
[1:01:43] see out there corrupting the people are
[1:01:45] being corrupted they're becoming evil
[1:01:47] doing everything else bringing death and
[1:01:49] damnation hallelujah but you can't come
[1:01:53] to that because the scene is your anchor
[1:01:55] on the inside of you that seed is there
[1:01:58] to keep you your conscience it's a work
[1:02:00] through every fight where you're being
[1:02:02] hallelujah not that you will make
[1:02:05] mistakes stumble here there whatever but
[1:02:08] the moment you get quiet thoughts hear
[1:02:10] god will begin to talk to you you all
[1:02:13] praise god hallelujah listen your pastor
[1:02:16] is only here to be a physical leadership
[1:02:18] for you but there's a man inside like
[1:02:21] the gem said you have a witness in you
[1:02:25] hallelujah
[1:02:26] they call it intuition tuition means
[1:02:29] teaching you got an inside teacher amen
[1:02:32] i'll send the holy ghost he'll be in you
[1:02:35] he'll teach you he'll die for he'll lead
[1:02:38] you
[1:02:39] praise god hallelujah amen
[1:02:42] oh my
[1:02:44] praise god
[1:02:45] i i want to briefly mention uh this
[1:02:49] misconception of the baptism holy ghost
[1:02:51] we're thinking that the holy ghost is
[1:02:55] just going to come something is going to
[1:02:57] come from the outside of you
[1:03:00] and and just baptize you and then you
[1:03:02] got the holy ghost not realizing he was
[1:03:05] talking about the holy ghost for our age
[1:03:09] and that chinese laundry tag
[1:03:13] how the original owner holds a half
[1:03:17] and the other half stays in the shop
[1:03:21] amen and it's only when those two deep
[1:03:25] cross to the deep
[1:03:27] respond hallelujah only when male and
[1:03:31] female come together they fit amen
[1:03:35] because there's no you can't impersonate
[1:03:38] that because that is god's will god's
[1:03:40] plan god's purpose god wants
[1:03:45] amen oh my praise god hallelujah oh
[1:03:51] praise god so thank god that we
[1:03:53] understand now that the spiritual
[1:03:56] supernatural resurrection
[1:03:59] is the awakening of the seed
[1:04:02] within your heart within your life
[1:04:04] praise god amen
[1:04:07] resurrection your resurrection body
[1:04:10] but some first corinthians 15
[1:04:13] if you can uh somehow be able to do that
[1:04:16] if you can't that's fine
[1:04:18] first corinthians 15 reading from verse
[1:04:20] 35
[1:04:22] but some men will say
[1:04:24] how are the dead raised up
[1:04:27] with what body do they come
[1:04:31] thou fool
[1:04:32] that which thou shalt is not quickened
[1:04:36] except it die
[1:04:38] and that which thou shares those who has
[1:04:41] not that body
[1:04:43] amen

[1:05:02] amen let me read that first corinthians
[1:05:04] let me give it to you first corinthians
[1:05:06] 15 and this is verse 38 where paul said
[1:05:10] don't you understand it's not just this
[1:05:12] body that you come here and then it dies
[1:05:16] and they put it in a grave but god
[1:05:19] giveth it a body
[1:05:22] as it had pleased him
[1:05:26] and to every seed

[1:05:57] and time limits you you're limited to a
[1:06:00] position a place a location and so on
[1:06:03] because

[1:07:35] that was the seed
[1:07:38] amen but the holy spirit is jesus christ
[1:07:41] just in

[1:14:45] a good life not to condemnation or
[1:14:48] damnation
[1:14:49] but to live god's life
[1:14:52] but the other seed can do nothing but
[1:14:55] the life is that's where it's leading
[1:14:57] right to damnation that's where it's
[1:15:00] going to take them right back to
[1:15:02] oh my remember
[1:15:05] when jesus came out of the water
[1:15:07] the heavens opened
[1:15:09] the prophet saw it
[1:15:11] he saw the heavens open
[1:15:13] and out of heaven
[1:15:15] came a form of a dove
[1:15:18] and with the dove
[1:15:20] there also came a voice
[1:15:23] saying
[1:15:24] listen how he says it
[1:15:27] that voice was saying
[1:15:30] this is my part of the earth
[1:15:35] that i have redeemed
[1:15:38] hallelujah
[1:15:40] and from this
[1:15:41] part of the earth
[1:15:43] i will redeem all the rest of it
[1:15:48] for he is my word made manifest
[1:15:52] on the whole world i spoke into
[1:15:55] existence by my word hebrews 11.
[1:15:59] do you believe this was god speaking
[1:16:01] through the prophet
[1:16:05] and satan
[1:16:06] held it up
[1:16:08] all this time
[1:16:11] but now i've come to redeem it
[1:16:14] who's speaking brother bran just
[1:16:16] speaking
[1:16:17] oh my i've come to redeem it
[1:16:20] so much of it
[1:16:22] has made up his body
[1:16:24] and i'm coming to dwell in it
[1:16:27] just like he dwelt in him i'm coming to
[1:16:30] dwell now in this
[1:16:31] amen this part of this body amen
[1:16:34] hallelujah praise god for john saw it
[1:16:38] and he said i saw the holy city
[1:16:41] the new jerusalem
[1:16:43] descending out of heaven
[1:16:45] as a bride
[1:16:47] or dawn for her husband
[1:16:50] and where did it set long just exactly
[1:16:53] like it did back on there upon the earth
[1:16:57] hallelujah it settled right on jesus
[1:17:00] back then hallelujah and now you are i
[1:17:05] as the bride it settles on you if you
[1:17:08] are part of that election scene
[1:17:10] but in a larger sense he's also trying
[1:17:13] to he gets satan's words he's just got
[1:17:16] to keep the line he's on but by
[1:17:18] revelation do you understand that he's
[1:17:20] saying that when the spirit of god came
[1:17:23] down and those words were uttered we
[1:17:25] were still in him this is my part of the
[1:17:29] earth i have elected it i chosen it to
[1:17:32] manifest my word hallelujah praise god
[1:17:35] that part of it died on calvary to
[1:17:38] release the other part
[1:17:40] and now he says i have come to redeem
[1:17:44] this part hallelujah amen praise god
[1:17:48] hallelujah for jesus was
[1:17:50] part of the earth
[1:17:52] and the holy ghost descended upon him
[1:17:56] and remained upon him forever
[1:17:59] it never can leave him
[1:18:01] it is always there he and god are one
[1:18:05] always to remain one
[1:18:09] and you in that day you'll know i am in
[1:18:12] the father the father and me and i in
[1:18:15] you
[1:18:16] and together one
[1:18:18] hallelujah not father son and bride no
[1:18:22] but one
[1:18:23] hallelujah said the spirit and the bride
[1:18:26] says come the spirit in the bride says
[1:18:29] call
[1:18:30] for is one god working in his spirit
[1:18:33] hallelujah see now you remember john saw
[1:18:36] that the holy city is telling us the
[1:18:39] whole thing again so we understand the
[1:18:41] new jerusalem descending like a comet or
[1:18:44] like a dove coming down out of heaven
[1:18:48] and settling upon
[1:18:50] a redeemed entire earth to do what
[1:18:54] that he might claim every attribute
[1:18:58] that he made
[1:18:59] on that earth hallelujah every man that
[1:19:03] was represented in that any eternity
[1:19:07] or praise god hallelujah you think you
[1:19:10] have representation
[1:19:11] [Music]
[1:19:13] i'm using his words here every man or
[1:19:15] woman that was represented in that
[1:19:18] in eternity amen hallelujah you were
[1:19:22] represented in the water there because
[1:19:24] you already was represented in eternity
[1:19:27] you were he was all the world wrapped up
[1:19:29] together so when he come down we were
[1:19:32] all in him
[1:19:33] and he goes and he gets baptized people
[1:19:35] are all in him
[1:19:36] hallelujah when god spoke over him we
[1:19:39] were all in him
[1:19:40] this is my beloved child this is one
[1:19:42] amen oh my god and i choose them and i
[1:19:46] please to dwell with them praise god
[1:19:48] hallelujah ever you see and that's the
[1:19:51] way it is
[1:19:53] with every man or woman that is redeemed
[1:19:57] for that means they have been scoured
[1:19:59] out and burnt out by the fires of
[1:20:02] god that's what he was talking about in
[1:20:05] the future home not just the literal orc
[1:20:07] burning the germs in the skies and
[1:20:10] chasing out the devils there
[1:20:12] maybe that will be also but he's talking
[1:20:15] about you and i all the germs and demons
[1:20:18] that
[1:20:19] haunt your thoughts your mind your being
[1:20:21] constantly harassing you and everything

[1:20:40] spiritual fire now listen how are you
[1:20:42] gonna explain that do you see it

[1:22:29] he overcome
[1:22:31] by these fiery trials you overcome every
[1:22:33] one of them
[1:22:35] we come also and are trapped in these
[1:22:38] mortal bodies just as he was
[1:22:41] but we overcome as he overcame
[1:22:45] and the prophet gave us that assurance
[1:22:47] he says don't you understand overcome
[1:22:50] you overcome
[1:22:52] by him who already has overcome that is
[1:22:56] in you

[1:23:04] you're ready and overcome god because
[1:23:07] the one who overcome is in you
[1:23:09] amen praise god
[1:23:14] hallelujah
[1:23:16] remember
[1:23:17] he will speak and we will come forth all
[1:23:21] of us
[1:23:23] i'm quoting him listen
[1:23:25] just like in the beginning
[1:23:28] see
[1:23:30] it was not god's perfect will for
[1:23:33] children to be born on the earth
[1:23:36] through sex
[1:23:38] no
[1:23:39] see
[1:23:40] god created man out of the dust and the
[1:23:43] earth breathe the breath of life into
[1:23:45] him and he become a living person a
[1:23:48] living soul
[1:23:50] hallelujah praise god remember god was
[1:23:53] supposed to create by his spoken word
[1:23:57] he was to create by what the seven
[1:24:01] thunders
[1:24:03] hallelujah
[1:24:04] oh my because the perfect word seven
[1:24:08] calls the bride
[1:24:10] the seventh thunder calls the bride it's
[1:24:13] the voice of god sundering fort the
[1:24:15] prophet said in sweetness
[1:24:18] calls out the bride of jesus christ amen
[1:24:22] oh blessed be his name
[1:24:26] now he took from that man a helpmate and
[1:24:30] made a wife
[1:24:31] to him
[1:24:33] that was god's first
[1:24:36] and god's original
[1:24:38] will
[1:24:40] do you do you have that
[1:24:43] but when then sin came in and did the
[1:24:46] thing it did
[1:24:47] and then
[1:24:49] god permitted man to marry a wife wife
[1:24:54] to marry a husband but that was his what
[1:24:57] permissive will
[1:25:00] he allowed it
[1:25:01] but that was not his perfect will
[1:25:04] right he said the prophet says here and
[1:25:07] legally
[1:25:09] you have a right
[1:25:10] because that is god allowed
[1:25:13] amen and to have children
[1:25:15] because he himself said
[1:25:18] multiply and replenish the earth
[1:25:21] amen
[1:25:22] if that's the way you want to do it
[1:25:24] if that's the way you're going to do it
[1:25:27] you see
