of the Lord Savior Jesus Christ we Amy and amen Hallelujah Brothers come and take the Tyson offering this morning and forever for more [Music] [Music] imagine well [Music] right foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] praise God and for those believers who were in our Friday night prayer meeting I shared that with this testimony with them so you're going to get a double blessing I trust by the grace of God but um and even after Sharon on Friday the Lord brought it back to my remembering that the experience I had on Thursday night was actually an outflow of the service on Wednesday because what happened if during the service you know you may recall our brother Desmond admonish enough and encouraging us to always be blessing to the people that we meet even in Simplicity you know just the joy of our heart that's in us when we express that to them that's a blessing so I have our brother with Minister and you know I thought to myself Lord give me more of those experiences right and I had forgotten about that of course so when this happened on Thursday I didn't put the two together until Friday night when I recalled when I thought about it so on Thursday evening after work you know as we do sometimes we love Avid Gardener so I love to garden and I was out there though we always battling against those weeds right so I was out of my front lawn pulling off weeds and so on and so forth and in our neighborhood people are really friendly we thank God for that and uh you know usually have a feeling path by we'll just wave and say good evening and so on but on my sidewalk I was approaching me I found this lady older lady walking her dog and as she was walking though I could just feed her counting and feel really down but I just created her I said good evening you know she said good evening back and I'm like how are you right and she took Florida answer and then she said I'm managing right and I said I know it's not easy right but I just said but one day at a time right thank God right I said to her you know I know sometimes it's not easy but just Moment by moment right so she paused right outside my driveway if I was and she stopped and she started speaking with me and she started sharing how that her husband is in the hospital and that he's been in ICU for the last five months right and as she shared you know and I won't be able to express everything because we actually end up speaking for over an hour right but through that Fellowship I end up telling her about the loss of brother Daniel if you believe Earth may know you have my first and late husband right and then I learned that she had actually lost her husband many many years before but the husband she's with now they've been married for 35 years and she was telling me though how that you know on their way back from a trip in Cuba he got a heart attack on the plane but there was a Nerf there who was able to give him an IV they had to have an emergency stop in Pittsburgh and he was there for a while and over a hundred thousand dollars she was telling me of medical expenses eventually he was airlifted to the Brantford hospital where we live but now he's been in the ICU for five months and you know she'll tell me how every day she goes there and it's so hard and it's so tiring but I was just starting to encourage her and I was letting her realize I'm like look what you just told me that on the plane beside him with a nurse who was able to give him an IV then he emergency landing in Pittsburgh God didn't take him they were able to help him brought him back home so I said even though he's been in ICU for five months God is able if the Lord wanted to take him away he would have taken him already if I said you encourage him his name is Mark and I said would you mind if I prayed for you and she said sure it's okay you know so we prayed right there on the sidewalk and she was so happy she was in tears and everything right and then after that she would feel really she was just smiling and joyful right and then we started talking about other things in life and even if it wasn't for the fact that I had to leave to pick up our son from football because it was over an hour later that we kept fellowshipping and that's why I had to leave her because I had to go pick up her son but you know what else it brought to mind you know first of all it was a big change between you know when I first encountered her all down cuffed and fad on that walk versus when she was leaving me she and now I'm gonna fade if I didn't see this on Friday but if not for my glory it's for the glory of the Lord she would literally think oh Marsha you're an angel you're so sweet you're such a sweet person right and I'm like praise the Lord because I know we know we're not Angels In the Flesh right but the word angel means Messenger right so I'm glad the Lord was able to use me to bring a message of encouragement to her and as a visual for those of you who may have watched a chosen you know if you've seen the episode where the woman at the well met Jesus right you may recall when she came up to him you know she was sad and everything but then when she left she was running and joyful and happy right and that's the visual that the Lord helped me to real life in in this time right on Thursday evening God gave me that experience so my dear brothers and sisters you know this is to encourage us that hey I have to worry comes forth as the word live enough when we say hi to someone we say how are you to someone we receive their answer we know not everyone is going to open up but we never know who will open up we never know who will have the opportunity to pray for and sure enough I stage numbers with her and we trust the Lord to continue to be a blessing each other's life if I pray to tell the money with an encouragement to you for the glory of God Amen praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] of a high priest and then he entered [Music] [Applause] [Music] the king [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] we have been called We're anointed [Music] Before the Throne you've come to your father you're a child of the keys [Music] together in unity

God may the Lord bless you real good and I welcome among our sister career is that right did I pronounce that right praise the Lord anyway God bless her heart and God bless her in the service and

dwell within my heart and life can we sing that song like the woman at the well I was thirsting for things that does not satisfy um you know that song okay could you help me with that like the woman

brother Tim beers will be ministering the word and as you know any minister is just the voice he gives voice to the word of God whatever you're seeking whatever your heart is hungering you pray while he is speaking that the holy spirit will draw from the well that is in him what you need and God will satisfy your longing praise the Lord so as he comes let us just have a word of Prayer our gracious and wonderful Heavenly Father as our brother comes here we pray that the Holy Spirit who inhabits our lives and who has come into this building with us Lord Jesus to Walk Among his lilies the flowers of his grace that you might Lord Jesus just anoint him and our hearts and made a great Holy Spirit drawn near oh Father we welcome you you welcome your spirit's presence Our God May our hearts be tender to the word and may we receive ever present Waters of life and revelation from the word of God as we walk through this darken weary land the spirit wilderness o great Jehovah lead us by your Mighty hand we ask this blessing here today in Jesus name amen God bless you what's your statement praise the Lord amen I was glad when they said to me let us go into the house of the Lord you maybe seed it amen because uh like Pastor Simon said there it's not my you're going to hear my voice but we come we're glad because we come to hear his voice amen oh what a supernatural God mystery of preaching amen that God Hallelujah can make himself known to somebody like me grace of God this morning amen we had a great time in Petrolia thanks for your prayers um I don't know if you remember last last uh Friday prayer meeting there brother Desmond uh prayed for myself felt led to ask him to pray for myself for uh the meetings there and he he spoke a bunch of things and I looked over my wife after the prayer was done and I said let it be done according as has been spoken and let me tell you it was done amen it was really done God really taken him I I spoke on um uh the mystery in the bride is moving forward some of the stuff I brung here but God took it in such a totally different direction and uh just basically trying to bring them out of the past and bring them into the present in order to do that you have to repent you have to confess and make things right so you can move forward with God and we all know that by our experience we don't move forward with God unless we repent amen that's that's why God loves and David love to repent though he made a lot of mistakes he loved to repent amen Hallelujah Hallelujah God put something on my heart this morning we'll get right to the word um I'm not going to be able to finish it for sure this morning I don't know which direction it's going to go in but um and I pray that it will be a blessing to you amen that somehow in your life that you will uh see this amen and not necessarily see what I'm saying but see what the spirit is speaking amen you bring your faith in here this morning you bring your experience in here this morning you bring your walk with God it's not the building the tent that we're in here is the tent of the Holy Ghost and the spirit of God Amen so I want to go to Second Corinthians 12 1. you pray for me um just a little different for me this morning I don't know why but uh I guess it's right in the title and my title is um strength is revealed in weakness so I'm certainly I don't know why but I'm in kind of weakness this morning and fighting certain things but um strength comes out of weakness and that's what I want to talk about amen Hallelujah second Corinthians 12 1 and then we're going to go to Hebrews 4 14. Paul speaking here it is not Expediting it for me doubtless to Glory I will come to visions and Revelations of the Lord I knew a man in Christ before above 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such a one caught up to the third heaven and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which is not lawful for a man to utter of such and one will glory yet of myself I will not Glory but in my infirmities for though for through I would desire to Glory I shall not be a fool for I will say the truth but now I for Bear least any man should think of me above that which he seeth me and be or that he heareth of me unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of Revelation there was given to me a thorn in the flesh a messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I bersought the Lord twice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore I would rather Glory my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take Pleasures in my infirmities and reproaches and necessaries and persecutions and distress for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong amen that's going to be our theme for when I am weak then I am strong Hebrews 4 14. it's talking about the word of God here the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints of the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart let us pray father we thank you this morning that we can gather together Lord it's a great gathering this morning Lord but it would be nothing without you lord Jesus come and do what you always do father speak my Lord speak to the rock this morning Lord speak to the hearts and the lives that are lying before you speak to your children father come this morning and do what you always do father you deliver you set free the captives Lord you open the prison doors you break the chains Lord you give strength Lord to the weak you always give strength to the weak father touch us both speaker and hearer Lord in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you as you see it Hallelujah amen don't want to get ahead of myself here Hallelujah you know we must continue to repeat ourselves over and over and over again we're living in such a day in an age where everybody wants things fast fast and nothing sinks in you know I was preaching there in petroleum and I was telling a few believers and they said oh you had job and asked sheep because I kept going over everything over everything over and over again it's like that statement that brother Branham said you know he preached one night on repentance two three four five six nights and they finally came to him and said you got anything else you're going to preach on he says oh yeah I got lots to preach on but repent first you know so God's word we you know we gotta watch that we don't take the age that we're living in out there technology everything's so quick the word of God got to sink in and that's why ministers and the Bible says that good preaching is repeated preaching repeat yourself over and over because no matter how many times you hear it until it sinks in and God knows God knows if it sinks in or not God knows when that that mental Faith becomes our reality a real Faith a manifestation in your life you know I one night I I was just thinking about this I said you know what I'm going to go on Tick Tock and I went on Tick Tock most of you guys know Tick Tock I went on Tick Tock and I I scroll through things that I like like uh you know spiritual things uh uh medical things and you know I just kept going through Tick Tock one after and I ran into a lot of good information and I was going over it I went for three hours on Tick Tock going through and reading all kinds of stuff and later on I I lied down on the bed there and I was trying to think of all the great things that I was that I went that I read and I went over you know I couldn't think of anything nothing sunk in nothing became a reality though there was a lot of good things because I was going over and over and over and over and that's what we want we want one message this week and another one and another one and another one and something new new and we realized sometimes that we pass over things and it doesn't sink in God wants his word to sink in amen he wants it to become a reality in our lives and become real to us amen perfect strength and perfect weakness is a paradox and God is a paradox you we look through the word and we see a lot of things that are Paradox what is a paradox something that is true but we don't understand we can't figure it out and there's a lot about God that we can't figure out and I hope we find this morning something revealed to us that God takes weakness that you'll see in your life that God takes weakness and brings strength out of it he's the only one that can do it that's why he said I'll take all things good and evil and make them work for your good we can't understand that we can't explain that we can't figure that out but we believe that Hallelujah amen Hallelujah God takes weakness and makes strength out of it he takes human strength and makes weakness out of it oh yes Satan takes our strength and makes us weak in fear but God takes our weakness and gives us overcoming Power by faith in his word and he makes us more than a conqueror not just a conqueror but more than a conqueror not because you're strong but because you're weak oh my who wants to be weak hey not in reality who wants trials who wants temptation who wants Hard Times come on we all want hard times we all want that thorn in our flesh don't we not if you're human you don't Hallelujah but when you recognize the revelation of the word of God you recognize God's pattern and God's process amen of dealing with sons and daughters of God yes it's a paradox to human beings yes it's a paradox to your mind but that's the way God does it amen Hallelujah oh yes brothers and sisters we're highly favored and blessed of God amen hallelujah we're loved of the Lord but then again we're so frustrated we're so burdened we're so heavy laid in sometimes we're so worried about so many things but we're highly favored and blessed of God at the same time is it possible yes it's possible Hallelujah glory to God we are dealing with this most darkest Wicked age that we live in the spirit of this age lukewarmness lazy powerless but we need to move forward in the glory of his word we are living moving forward in a Strange Land this is not our home this is not our home this is a Strange Land and it's becoming more stranger to the individual as they grow in faith and as they overcome more and more this land is a Strange Land Hallelujah glory to God we are rejoicing and hungering and thirsting for righteousness in this world of total godliness totally blacked out there ain't no worshipers of God out there we understand that even denominations false teaching Worship in the devil false doctrines not worshiping the truth totally blacked out yes highly favored blessed of God but frustrated and weak at times thorn in our flesh anxiety anxiousness depression fear but singing and praising God and going through hard situations weak but confessing the power of the word of God brother Branham like Paul was caught up into the heavens and at the same time he confessed the hope his first wife that he was at the end and he wanted to commit suicide but God in his strength amen gave him faith and through his weakness think about it think about it caught up and at the same time he was caught up he was at the weakest point of his life on this Earth losing his wife at the point in time losing so many people in his life weak but we can look back and see his life how God took that life of weakness amen and produce a Ministry that swept the world with the power and demonstration of God we can't escape it my brothers and sisters we can't escape God's process amen but I'm here to tell you amen it doesn't matter what you're going through how weak you are how you're suffering this morning God if you surrender to him will take that weakness amen and bring strength out of it bring power and deliverance out of it because that's what he does not any preacher does not any great men but him and him alone Hallelujah glory to God what is the deep meaning of strength mental power or endurance such as willpower courage self-confidence self-discipline her inner strength and her deep love for God's word led her to believe and to overcome the devil's temptation the word strength is mentioned over 360 times in the Bible applying both naturally and Supernatural strength the word means power strength and might in the Bible strength is often linked to God's power Believers are to be strong in the Lord and the power of His might Ephesians 6 10. the unlimited power of Christ is the source of our strength for those who belong to him Hallelujah glory to God now God even gave his strength as a gift to people as is recorded in the Bible however the Bible is also full of language about strength and weakness but let us remember there is no weakness in God only strength in his word God is strong and powerful there is no weakness in God it's God who takes weakness and brings his strength through it amen just like there's no bad in God only good in God Hallelujah amen only in Christianity does the idea exist that someone is strongest in their lowest moments when people are weak if they submit to God he can take over and use his full strength when someone is at their weakest they are the most dependable and depending on the Lord who is infinite stronger than weak sinful humans understanding this concept glorifies the sacrifice Jesus made on the cross and empowers Believers to persuade pursued their race well and bear any and all circumstances since God is bearing it with them Jesus said come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and burdened and I will give you rest rest strength I will give you strength when we rest in the Lord amen we're resting in his strength and his power and his might Hallelujah Jesus said take my yoke upon you and learn of me do you see learn learn my process learn my ways the Bible says lean not to your own understanding but acknowledge Him acknowledge his ways follow his bloody footprints follow his life example Hallelujah it'll bring more rest in your walk and more peace in your life when you recognize the things that you go through and the weaknesses that you have in your life are for God's purpose Hallelujah for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls there's not rest again for my yoke is easy and my burden is light oh my thank you Lord starting to get hot up here amen my burden is light oh sometimes our burdens are so heavy our life is so weighed down there ain't nobody here that don't know what I'm talking about you know but there's a process there's a way we hear these things over and over Jesus said I am the way the truth the life he has a way and sometimes we don't see his way and I'm going to try this morning with all that is in me but I trust in the Holy Ghost that he shows you the way the way out the way out of your weakness Hallelujah I'm not saying that your weakness is going to go your thorn in your flesh is going to go remember Paul a prophet abundance of Revelation a prophet speaks left to ear with God we don't speak like that with God as close as prophets do for God's purpose and reason and the the life that Paul lived the surrendered and yielded life that he lived the things that produced out of his life that we can read in the scriptures and how God can use him and how God used him it only could have happened if that thorn was in his flesh it kept him humble you read it this morning it kept them submissive it kept them in line with the word of God Hallelujah what a life brother Branham speaking here and if you really wanna really take in and really absorb this message this morning listen to perfect faith and perfect weakness by Brother Branham this week I'm telling you you will be blessed amen we don't believe here in the Tate Ministry and just listen to the tapes but we believe in listening to the tapes and we believe in the fivefold ministry that listens to the tapes and draws inspiration so that the Living God can have the preeminence without that he wouldn't have the preemus this morning he wouldn't be invited here Hallelujah there are so many of us like to testify or likes to think that we are insufficient and therefore we make that we make an excuse I have no education I have no ability I'm unable to do this and if you keep that up and do that in that way and keep going like that then you cannot amount to anything but the very thing that we make excuses for by our weakness God uses that very thing to tackle the job just think about it you talk about a paradox the thing that we make excuses for that we're not able to do what we need to do or overcome for the Lord or change in our lives is the very thing that God uses to tackle the situation that uses you Hallelujah can God use you yes he can brother Desmond Hallelujah glory to God amen he waits for us to get in that condition so that he can use us just think about it we take the excuses and we say well I can't do this I'm insufficient we find out just we have to be be reading that weak weakness and rejection that those people who are the weakest and the rejected by the outside world is God's Heroes that conquered in the front lines amen those who took the word of God Amen but they felt unworthy who got and get away from the human ability you got to get to a place where you can surrender your soul and life even to the housewife the farmer the mechanic the businessman whoever you are you got to surrender completely to God and know that we are nothing then let God start from there then he starts moving and working from that place not when we think we're something or we think we know something or we come from denomination or Pentecost and we think we know God let me tell you they're dead out there you come from there that's not the same God that is here that is moving and manifesting in this day that's old Manna this is fresh Manna for today I want to know the present truth and be established in the present truth I want to know the Living God and what he's doing today this moment not even last week today today's a new day Hallelujah I'm just still trying to lay a foundation here the power of Revelation to give strength Jesus said in Matthew 16 18. the power of the gates of hell will not overpower the strength of Revelation never brother Brahm said Revelation is more important to you than you even imagined this statement is more important to you in your walk than you could imagine this morning it probably went over a lot of people's heads because you heard it before right but when you apply it to your life you apply it to your situation you apply it to your weakness in your life then it becomes different when you apply the word of God that's why brother Brown says nothing will work for you unless you apply the token in this hour apply it to everything that you do in your life everything there ain't nothing in a child of God's life that is outside of God Hallelujah Jesus himself said you lack faith ah it's promised to the Seed of Abraham it's a promise to the Seed of Abraham that you will receive Faith In Due season in time listen if God is telling you to move forward if God is telling you to overcome and he's speaking that into your life he's got to give you what you have need of and the power and the faith to go forward or why would he ask you why would he be calling you to go higher and deeper in him and to overcome and keep stepping out by faith if he wasn't going to do that Hallelujah that's the God I know the Bible says that our strength is in a way that seems impossible or difficult to understand because of the containing two opposite facts or characteristics and it relates to surrender okay submit yourself then to God resist the devil ignore him don't pay him any attention remember what we said before that he can't impersonate this because he knows nothing about it he don't understand it so when he comes to you because he's the father of Lies ignore him don't listen to him Brother Brad says not how long you can make the war linger it's how fast you can stop it and cut it off in your mind and cast that doubt and that unbelief away from you amen and believe the word of God believe that you're a child of God Amen even in your weakness you're going to see this morning I Pray by God's grace that your weakness is not a curse your weakness is not a weakness it's a strength in your life it's the power of God it's the grace of God to you and when you can take it and move it in a different direction you talk about being positive amen you can take that weakness and use it just like fear everybody has fear but it's whether it controls you or it paralyzes you amen or you control it you can control it and use it for your vanish we have the power we have the word inside of us to take all things and use it for our advantage that's what God has given us you talk about the spoken word you talk about speaking the word and having things manifest oh God thanks let's look at the ABCs let's not jump to the algebra amen God knows what he said in the message God knows what he said to what the bride is going to manifest but there's a process that he has to bring through her through maturity and she's got to overcome she's got to overcome herself her weaknesses her sins and her life she's going to take the word and learn what to do with the word in her own life and sometimes those weaknesses don't go they stay there they're Thorn but you take the word and you use it and you know how to direct the word in your life to bring forth victory oh my thank you Lord we align ourselves with the strength of God through our total submission and surrender to him then we are able to withstand The Wiles of the evil one how can you do it on your own you got to be fortified by the word only the word can defeat the Devil and I'm not talking about oh I read the word I memorize the word that's not what I'm talking about becoming the word is totally different than that is when you believe that word so much I don't even got words to explain it that is a reality to you that nothing else is more real to you than that word that's being spoken to you you want nothing else in your life to live to manifest to overcome than that word so please with God's dealings with my life so please no matter what he does Joel said though he slays me still will I trust them still will I praise them because I know in the last days I'll Stand and I'll see God I know I'll be victorious Oh Glory be strong in the Lord and the power is might put on the full armor of God that you'll be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil except or yield to the superior Force or to The Authority or will of another person Jesus Christ that's where our strength comes from Hallelujah not in our own human strength our own human ability Lord Jesus help us God takes strength God takes weakness and brings strength amen the devil takes strong people in the world in the human ability and makes them weak and destroys them Hallelujah Satan feeds off the people and destroys them God lets us feed off of him the Fountain of Life to become strong in our weakness he says come unto me those who are heavy laden and burdened come my burden is light feed off of me take my yoke I went through it I went through the Garden in Gethsemane I went through the cross I suffered like no man has suffered ever before I can I can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities I can touch your pain I can touch your weakness Hallelujah amen glory to God no matter how strong we think we are in the word the flesh is weak Mark 14 38. left to our own devices we will fall into temptation and fail in every and any worthy endeavor the weakness inherited in human nature is why the Bible commands us to the strength of the Lord Christ's power is made perfect in our weakness as we learn to rely on God's strength instead of Our Own we gain New Heights we go to new heights Hallelujah God said to Paul my strength is perfect in your weakness oh my you imagine Paul approaching God you know we think and I I believe Paul probably thought all what God has done through his life and his ministry he knows the power of God he knows God is real oh yes and he thought you know I can approach God and he approached him three times he didn't get it on the first time that's the human part of us and we think sometimes my brothers and sisters that everything in our lives have to go every weakness and every thing that we we're struggling an element in our life that has to go and Paul thought the same thing that's why he approached God three times said Lord take it away from me come on I'm your servant look at the work I got to do but then he came to realize when God spoke back to him and he said Paul he could probably give Paul see we read these as words but this is a revelation that God spoke to Paul and he said Paul my strength is made perfect in your weakness for when you are weak Paul then you are strong you may not understand it but I know what I'm doing in your life and an only way that I can fulfill in your life and complete what needs to be completed in your life is that I gotta keep you weak in a certain area I got to keep that thorn there and then Paul turned around his whole Revelation he said oh I will glory in my weakness and in my infirmities I will praise God in them and Worship the Lord oh God Hallelujah this is a paradox my brothers and sisters amen don't think any human being could explain this to you is impossible well I'm just being a voice this morning but may his voice speak through your hearts speak to your life and your situation Hallelujah amen the more we forget about our education the more we forget about our denomination the more we can forget about our stuff your stuff wow I looked at that and something struck me it's just a word but he says you can forget about your stuff oh man we got a lot of stuff you might call it baggage we got a lot of baggage we got a lot of stuff in our lives amen we got a lot of things that we're we are trying to figure out in our lives we're trying to put God in order in our lives just think about it because we got a lot of stuff we got to get a lot of stuff out of our lives amen but all I know is when I came to the Lord and he called me out I had a lot of stuff in my life amen a lot of possession on my life but I didn't worry about the stuff I kept my eyes on the words that was calling me I kept believing the word that the word was more than able I wasn't looking at my weaknesses my inabilities standing here this morning a shy a guy who couldn't speak in public at all standing and speaking now because I didn't look at my stuff I looked to Jesus the author and finisher of my faith amen the one who started the work he's going to finish the work amen he said my word won't return void and my word is inside of you Hallelujah it will accomplish it will be successful no matter what weakness what's in your life Hallelujah glory to God you walk out of here this morning saying Lord let thy will be done not my will but thy will be done in my life I gotta keep my eyes on you no matter what stuff is in my life and keep pressing on keep moving forward oh Just Surrender that's all I know I didn't know anything else but surrender submit myself to God believe the truth and let him do it stop trying to figure it out stop trying to figure it out and let God take care of it he knows what he's doing he knows what he's doing Hallelujah the Bible places emphasis on God's strength and our Salvation no man in no way can save himself only God can save Paul makes this abundantly clear for us by Grace you have been saved through faith it's not of yourself it's the gift of God not by works that no man can boast that's not by our works we're not strong in our works and what we have accomplished for God we boasted him it doesn't matter what we do you can do a work for God do a thing for God and if you really know if God really worked through you amen you'll stand back and you know why brother Branham said at 55 years old one year before he left and look at his ministry he said I haven't done nothing for God he wasn't trying to be humble my brothers and sisters he just recognized that everything was done in his ministry is because somebody was doing it and that's it somebody in our life is doing it not us it's God doing it Hallelujah we can't save we can't deliver we can't heal ourselves it's him it's him that does it Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord glory to God 's word is also clear that the awareness of our weakness need never lead to despair but finding strength actually the opposite is true when we realize our insignificance that God is a reminder to seek his supply of strength he gives power to the weak and to those who have no might he increases their strength those who emit that they are weak are though the ones who God's offers his strength to oh my listen to me my brothers and sisters you're looking up up me this morning up here this morning but something hit me back there Hallelujah that something hit me back there where I got so weak I didn't even know if I was going to come and stand up here this morning I got I don't know what it was but real Ministers of God know what it is amen I said Lord I'm preparing this message and I feel so strong preparing this message all through it and here comes half an hour before I have to step up here I'm at my weakest I don't even know my legs are shaking I'm shaking and trembling inside and I said oh God that's what he wants oh God I need you not my own abilities not what I'm thinking I need you to come Lord I realize that you are priority and when we realize in our life that God is priority he comes with strength oh my thank you Lord look in the Bible with Gideon in Judges 7 12 from 32 000 to 300. God shrunk his army he says you're too strong in yourself and your human abilities it won't show my power and my grace and my ability to deliver you and defeat the enemy shrink your army low as you can go Hallelujah God said you have too many men I cannot deliver Midian into their hands or Israel or else you would boast against me think about it think about it oh my My Own Strength has saved me oh my Lord Jesus help us that's here that's here my brothers and sisters that's why you got the thorn that's why you got the weaknesses because that's the human nature me you I don't care who you are brother Branham Paul the Apostle great Apostle each and every one of us will say the same thing if we didn't have God's grace coming in our lives through weakness that we would boast in ourselves boast in our works boasting our gifts mostly what God is doing through our lives he wants to do he wants to manifest through our lives but until we are weak he doesn't get the glory man gets the glory Hallelujah amen in the end the midianites are defeated God is glorified and Israel's saved salvation came not through human strength but through the strength of the Lord God strength in the Bible is really seen in many of his Works he created the world and all that's in there by his word he parted the Red Sea he caused the sun to stand still he raised the Dead he performed many other great glorious Deeds Amen in Psalms 150 I'll praise him for the acts of his power the one who watches over Israel will never Slumber or never sleep Hallelujah because God is all power amen and he needs no rest he doesn't need to sleep amen that's the God that I want to serve amen he don't sleep or Slumber hey man he watches over everything in our lives he knows everything in our lives that's going on he knows every pain that you're going through he knows the situation and how long it's been going on for but he says my grace is sufficient for you amen my strength is made perfect in that weakness Hallelujah oh Lord look at God and how strong he is how powerful he is I can't even quote all the scriptures let's say how God is so powerful but brother Brown speaking here God and flesh how weak he became listen my God my God why has Thou forsaken me have you said that oh yes sure you have in your prayers all my bones they stare at me not one of them is broken they wag their heads and say he trusted in others he saved others himself he cannot save and all the things that the prophets have said was right there think about it right there and Jesus die and holding that word submitted himself God Emmanuel became so weak that he submitted himself to death you know we we as humans we see death all the time but you understand that statement here here's God eternal life there's no death in God there can never be death in God but he came down in flesh think about it and he submitted himself to death it's deeper than we think and to the Grave and his soul to hell think about it weakness but out of that complete surrender not my will but thy will be done oh yeah Jesus said can you remove this cup for me is it possible oh but not my will but thy will be done came forth on Easter morning winding its way to the lowest he was the highest and he became the lowest he come to the lowest people went to the lowest city and the littlest man in town had to look down on him think about it we just read these things but he came God came in flesh and he lived it he lived it and this is what we need to follow his life his bloody footprints it's the only way my brothers and sisters it's the only way to God is this way went from there to death and from death to the grave and to from the grave to hell to the lowest that could be ever got to the lowest of hell that you could think of he went to it but then from there God began to raise him up through Paradise from there to the tomb from the tomb to Glory and from Glory he went so high to the heavens that he had to look down he was exalted so high that he had to look down on upon the heavens think about it my brothers and sisters oh my exalted to his throne Hallelujah if we can only realize and recognize if we just can leave everything in God's hands we will find out that God's hands will be in everything if we can leave everything in our lives in God's hands then we'll see in our lives that everything will be in his hands amen Hallelujah oh God hallelujah amen Hallelujah Ephesians 6 10 says be strong in the Lord Paul doesn't see doesn't see to get strong it takes a lot of time to get strong but to be strong it takes no time there's a big difference but to get strong it takes time Hallelujah glory to God to be strong it takes believing having faith trust and stepping forward in the promises that he has given us I'll never leave you nor forsake you no Arrow by day or by Night shall harm you or come near to you no weapon formed against you shall prosper I'll give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and I'll give you power over all of the enemy that's how we become strong in a minute by taking his word and believe in his word amen but it takes time to be strong it takes time to be holy it takes time for God to deal with our lives and bring it under that submission that's what it's all about my brothers and sisters it's not complicated it's not difficult difficult amen what God is doing in our lives because we can't do what he can do but he needs us to do what we need to do and that is to let go and let God and surrender into his hands Hallelujah my brothers and sisters the devil has no strength or real power has been all taken and Stripped Away From Him so your anxiety your fear your weakness all these things in your flesh he has no power over you once you have committed yourself to Jesus Christ the devil is weak and defeated God uses weakness to make us strong but the devil uses the weakness to destroy us and that's why we're saying here this morning we don't want the devil amen the understanding that Paul got when when the Lord spoke to him is that his weakness became strength to him I can imagine what Paul was thinking oh my God this sword in my flesh this devil the Bible says that Satan buffeted him what he was trying to think at that time the devil buffeted him and on his flesh and I can imagine what he was thinking in his mind over and over maybe condemnation maybe maybe some that's why he came to to that point amen where he said there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus he said I fought the good fight amen I fought it I fought the fight of faith and I finished my course Hallelujah when he recognized and he didn't give the power thus Satan has no power but if you give him the power through fear through anxiety through depression of your weakness in your body you give it over to the devil he'll use it to try to destroy you and defeat you but look at that weakness this morning and say my grace God's grace is sufficient for you because in this weakness Satan I am becoming strong in the Lord and the power of His might because of this weakness I'm pressing on because of this weakness I'm seeking God's face because of this weakness I'm praying and I'm seeking God in this hour remember this is the most lukewarm lazy powerless age ever in the religious Realm Satan trying to make the church powerless amen but God Amen is going to make his church Victorious there is going to be a bride and she's going to be perfect she's going to be walking in perfect Faith perfect realization of who she is and she's going to overcome listen if it has to fall off brother Simon said there's many here at this Revelation never leave certain Revelations never leave he says you know some things you're going to battle and struggle right right to the end and it's going to fall off with this flesh at the rapture well there's a revelation behind that my brothers and sisters as you're battling and and as you're going right to the end it doesn't have victory over you it's actually a weakness but it's losing power it's losing control over you amen the word inside of you that you're looking at and that you're feeding on Amen is gaining power and strength and it's taken this flesh it's taking that weakness and it's bringing us slowly under subjection more and more don't stop don't get discouraged don't let the devil put depression and all these things upon you because of your weakness because of your infirmities amen things that have been put on your flesh let God take it and use it for his glory and honor that strength come out of it Lord let strength come out of this I heard the word this morning Lord oh God show me show me change my mind change my thinking change everything about me in this area of my life and let me become strong Lord let me not look at this thing the same way or even look at it anymore let me look to you I Look To The Hills we're we're by Help Cometh my health Cometh From The Lord hallelujah glory to God amen Samson's strength Samson was so strong that he was able to pick up a Jawbone of a donkey and Slaughter a thousand Philistines judge 15 15. Samson soon became a threat to the enemy now listen you're going to be a threat to the enemy I'll tell you that we're all a threat to the enemy because of his strength his enemy knew about his moral weakness women we all got a weakness we all got something oh yeah Samson's was women I have this circled here for a reason because it struck me watch out Samson Wherever You Are he decided to use that against Samson judge 16 5 5. the Lords of the Philistines went to her and said entice him and find out his source of his great strength and how we can overpower him and tie him up and subdue him isn't that the devil huh that's what he's doing don't be ignorant of his devices there's brother Brown says there's a real devil my brothers and sisters he's just as real as God is real just as you are real here this morning he's real he's doing this he's trying to do this amen the only way that we can overcome this and him is before to fight under the word of God the only way get outside of that word amen he has free course at you that's why we are always in a constant state of repentance humbleness before God weakness before God oh God if there's anything I've done today anything I said or thought that was displeasing to you wash me in the precious blood of Jesus Christ you come into the service this morning and ask God to cleanse you and wash you oh all the time though the glory of God the New Birth the attribute of God is inside of me that is sinless but in this flesh I got to constantly be putting it behind the cross under the blood so I can fortify myself from The Wiles of the devil and his tactus in his schemes the devil wants to bind you up and make you weak in the Lord but Jesus Christ wants to take your weakness and make you strong the liar the spirit of Delilah is still alive today Goliath said to Samson tell me The Secret of your great strength and how I can tie you up as to do you just think about that demon from the pits of hell so bold so bold tell me Samson how I can tie you up Esther to you tell me the secret of your strength that's why this thing cannot be impersonated that's why it was told in the Bible that John seal it up right at night amen Satan knows nothing about this and we keep saying it over and over the apostles were men a few words my brothers and sisters we should be people a few words when it comes to God and what God is revealing to us in our lives don't tell Delilah your secrets don't give her power over you don't go to the places she wants you to go to oh my God Samson at his weakest Point thought that it was his hair that gave him strength think about it and you probably think some of you probably thinking that too it was his hair it was it was the The Promise the Covenant of the locksmith that gave him strength and forgot that his source of strength came from the Lord it was his obedience to the word that gave him strength it's our obedience to the word it's our surrender to the word that gives us strength and Power the devil is very interested to know the secrets of your strength the devil is more interested in knowing the true Secrets behind your unwavering Faith despite your losses and hurts and failures think about it our losses are failures our unwavering faith we got people here this morning by the grace of God that have lost Lots I'm thinking about people this morning I'm thinking when I was right when I was going through this I hope you're not offended any one of yours that I mentioned but I was thinking about lives written Epistles read of all men rated here in times of great weakness strength was being produced whether they knew it or not us thinking about sister Trudy and the whole experience of her passing away with brother Mike and the family young kids and how I seen his life give me strength his life gave me strength coming up here and growing and I listen I know he was hurting I know the pain the weakness the crying out why Lord why but strength was being produced through it and that's what the church seen was the power of God's strength through that weakness brother Gabe here many losses in his life of thinking about that God put this stuff on my mind to be a witness and a testimony to us raid in our midst of God's strength that God is manifesting in our midst loss his business is his first born son David you tell them about pain you talk about hurt you talk about weakness I've seen it when I was at the funeral and I walked up to the coffin to pay my respects brother Gabe grabbed my arm I don't even know if he's conscious of it he looks at me he looks at me and he says be strong brother me be strong me be strong I thought about that later on and I started weeping and crying me be strong I wasn't standing there where he was standing but in that weakness I seen God it only could be God and here he is this morning serving God faithfully and true not just half-heartedly but heartily sister Marsha I had the opportunity after brother Daniel passed away God just led me there when she moved into a new place with her brother helping them renovate and doing things and going here and going there and I I'm seeing the hurt I've seen the pain I'm seeing the weakness in there but I also see the strength of God I couldn't do nothing I wanted to do something but you can't do nothing it's not in your power and your strength to do anything but God in his grace here she is this morning the family as she testified not too long ago raised up moving by the grace of God that's strength and weakness that's only what God can do brother Chris unbelievable brother Chris I had him at my place working you know I couldn't really afford him but I had him at my place because I just wanted him there because I know what he was going through he went to the doctors over and over and they found nothing wrong with him but he knew and our pastor which so many times he does that under the discernment said brother you're suffering from a broken heart from his wife seven years seven Church ages he had to go through before he can come out of that but he came out of it stronger than ever before blessed than ever before why because in the same way sister Frida lost her husband and God joined them together amen God healed broken hearts he healed them together now they're in eternity together they're not walking into seven Church ages they're in this Eighth Day God taking testimonies here many of you testimonies amen God taking our lives and bringing it to this place my brothers and sisters this is important this is important that we recognize the hand of God we just we just bypass other people's pains other people's sufferings and what they've gone through in their lives and just take it for granted that they're here in church but they went through a lot of suffering and pain and heartache to be here to keep walking because of the grace of God what God did for others he can do for you Amen Let Me Wind this down now yeah Satan is bewildered that you're still serving God you're still on your knees you're still praising God giving God all the glory blessed be the name of the Lord he taketh he he giveth he take it away everything blessed be his name who's greater than him who owns my life who owns your life Don't Fear the person that can destroy the body but the person that destroys the body and soul God be praised in everything and everything let him be praised because one day there's more to life is going to be over and all the things are going to be made plain before us why we went through the things we went through and the losses and the pain and you're going to see the hand of God taking you through it all oh Hallelujah thank you Lord for when I'm weak then I am strong Hallelujah uh let me invite the musicians up as I close there's more against things there's going to be a couple more parts at least one more part in different directions final thoughts this is the weakness of life do not make us weaker with God's help we will gain strength during times of weakness God is able to transform our weaknesses and wounds into strong resilient strength God wants to transform you that's his purpose God is able to bring healing and wholeness into our lives God Can Transform us in many ways God can use the power of His Spirit God can use the power of His word God wants to encourage you this morning God wants to bless you will you allow God to use your weakness to strengthen you think about it will you allow God to use your weakness to strengthen you so you so can say like the Apostle Paul I can do all things through Christ who gives me the strength there isn't nothing that I cannot do no inability that I have no education that I have no weakness that I have I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me because he takes those weakness and he strengthens me for when I am weak then I am strong I want us to see it God said to me tell them to say it for when I am weak then I am strong again for when I wear them weak then I am strong again and mean it for when I am weak then I am strong Glory Glory [Applause] amen Hebrews 11. I got to read the scriptures then we're gonna close it who through faith to do kingdoms wrote righteousness obtain promises stop the mouths of lions quench the fiery violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax religion in the fight turn to flake the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others who were tortured not accepting deliverance and yet might obtain a better resurrection and others had Trials of crew makkans scourgeon yay moreover bonds and imprisonments they were stoned they were sod asundered think about it you

whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the Earth all these haven't obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God haven't provided some better things for us that they without us should not be made perfect Hallelujah they without us shall not be made perfect we are encamped with these cloud of witnesses this morning each and every one that has gone before us are encamped this morning that clot of witnesses every time I speak about it amen it becomes more real and real to me something is happening my brothers and sisters something has taken place that man cannot explain but amen one day before the Rapture takes place we're going to see Abraham we're going to see the Saints of old just like they've seen before the Rapture walking in the city I believe the cloud of witnesses are becoming so real and I feel their presence so real because it's just a matter of time before they start appearing amen glory to God but God wants to finish the work he wants to complete this last final stage of the race in our lives if it takes our weaknesses to recognize to bring us forward and complete this race complete our faith and let it be done let it be done let us stand glory to God thank you Lord thank you Lord thank the Lord he takes our weakness he takes our failures he takes everything that's no good in our
