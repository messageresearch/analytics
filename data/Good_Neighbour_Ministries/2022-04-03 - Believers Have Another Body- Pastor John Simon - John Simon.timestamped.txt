[45:05] bring with him
[45:08] for this we say unto you
[45:11] by the word of the lord
[45:14] that we which are alive
[45:17] and remain unto the coming of the lord
[45:20] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[45:26] for the lord
[45:27] himself
[45:29] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[45:34] with the trump of god
[45:37] and the dead in christ
[45:40] shall rise first
[45:42] then
[45:43] we which are alive and remain
[45:47] shall be caught up together with them
[45:51] in the clouds to
[45:53] meet the lord in the ear
[45:58] and so
[45:59] shall we ever be
[46:00] with the lord
[46:03] wherefore
[46:04] comfort one another
[46:06] with these words
[46:09] gracious heavenly father
[46:11] thank you for the reading of your word
[46:15] and now we receive the bread of life
[46:18] in jesus name amen

[46:26] praise god hallelujah
[46:28] amen
[46:30] glory be to god isn't the lord wonderful
[46:34] indeed amen amen
[46:36] we've given all the praise all the honor
[46:39] on all the glory for he's the same
[46:42] yesterday today and forever praise god
[46:47] i'm just pausing here just to
[46:49] uh you know get myself in a certain
[46:52] direction here we want to talk about uh
[46:56] several things we will speak about
[46:58] but um
[47:00] you know you have another body
[47:03] right
[47:04] the bible tells us that but we have
[47:06] another body
[47:07] and we will talk a little bit about that
[47:10] we will talk a little bit about the
[47:13] uh great um
[47:15] coming of the lord we'll talk um a bit
[47:18] about the uh body change praise the lord
[47:22] uh we'll touch on these things for god's
[47:26] glory and we pray that the holy spirit
[47:28] will help us amen
[47:31] glory be to god well first of all i want
[47:34] you to know of course the coming of the
[47:37] lord is a process
[47:40] right it's a process
[47:42] um
[47:43] to be born again is also a process
[47:47] you see
[47:48] when we look at all these things we
[47:50] understand it's all of the rapture is a
[47:53] process
[47:54] now i want to see the trend there god is
[47:57] changing our thinking and thoughts
[48:01] from the denominational or systems the
[48:05] way of the systems how they think
[48:08] uh of uh
[48:09] the rapture is just an event that's
[48:11] gonna happen on one day
[48:13] right um
[48:15] the the new birth is just an event on a
[48:19] certain day you got born again see the
[48:21] holy spirit has been
[48:23] and is
[48:25] changing our thoughts from
[48:28] the world
[48:29] to his thoughts
[48:32] or his way of thinking
[48:35] or how he is seeing it and telling it to
[48:38] us
[48:39] and we have been going through that
[48:41] change not even realizing it but that
[48:45] change has been taking
[48:46] place by the grace of god so we thank
[48:50] god for that wonderful uh process and
[48:53] that wonderful change that we have been
[48:57] going through and still are going
[48:59] through by the grace of god now i'm
[49:02] going to have to jump over certain
[49:03] things because this message will not
[49:06] take just a day i can't this is just not
[49:10] possible so we give him
[49:12] all the glory and all the praise for
[49:16] what he has done
[49:17] now
[49:19] i want you to know that when we look in
[49:21] the scripture here
[49:23] it tells us here
[49:26] let me stop back here again i still
[49:28] haven't really gotten into
[49:31] uh
[49:31] what praise the lord i want you to
[49:34] understand here
[49:35] that um
[49:37] the coming of the lord as as i have said
[49:40] is a process
[49:42] and
[49:43] we have and people have had the totally
[49:46] wrong idea of what the coming of the
[49:49] lord is and what it is about
[49:51] right now
[49:53] we find in the scriptures the bible
[49:56] tells us behold he cometh with clouds
[50:01] now
[50:03] brother coating
[50:04] brother branham
[50:07] now he is coming with clouds
[50:10] but what kind of clouds
[50:13] clouds of glory
[50:15] not one of these rain clouds that we you
[50:19] know we thinking of clouds passing of
[50:21] our heads
[50:22] see
[50:23] not
[50:24] not even a sunder cloud thunderhead
[50:28] but clouds of glory
[50:30] you you'll watch what kind of a cloud
[50:34] that he was uncovered with when peter
[50:37] and them saw him on the mount
[50:39] transfiguration
[50:41] he was covered in a bright shining cloud
[50:46] overshadowed him
[50:48] he was enshrouded with that kind of
[50:51] cloud the power of god
[50:55] now when the meetings he had his
[50:57] meetings and it really became very
[50:59] powerful
[51:01] then he'll stop and say oh my i i can
[51:04] see
[51:05] it's milky in here it's cloudy now amen
[51:09] so he's saying the clouds of the power
[51:12] of god hallelujah amen so he's trying to
[51:17] tell us when they read
[51:19] about the coming of the lord with clouds
[51:22] they're thinking of these kinds of
[51:24] clouds
[51:25] but he's telling us no
[51:27] the clouds he's talking about is the
[51:30] clouds of the power of god
[51:33] the power of god
[51:35] that uh
[51:36] let you see and receive this revelation
[51:41] right so
[51:42] you're gonna meet the lord in those
[51:45] clouds of power and of revelation that
[51:49] are uh meant for you
[51:52] now let me always say this just like we
[51:54] say the rapture is a process
[51:56] but it's gonna end the process of that
[51:59] rapture is gonna end
[52:01] that's what they want to call the
[52:02] rapture the end of it
[52:04] right and the same thing any one of
[52:07] those processes like the baptism
[52:11] they're not seeing it all the way that's
[52:14] from the foundations they're looking at
[52:16] it when it comes down to the end and you
[52:20] you're born again on this certain
[52:21] certain day but no
[52:23] you had to be born again it's the same
[52:26] way
[52:27] he's talking now about these clouds of
[52:31] glory bringing to you the revelation of
[52:35] the word of god hallelujah praise god
[52:38] and has brought this word of the word of
[52:41] god to you
[52:43] being and confessed with this cloud of
[52:45] witnesses
[52:47] what witnesses from the word
[52:50] hallelujah the word has been witnessing
[52:53] to you
[52:55] and revealing to you these things
[52:58] praise god it's it's not like you walked
[53:02] in the streets of jerusalem and you met
[53:04] abraham and you met this one and then
[53:06] they witnessed to you but you are
[53:09] meeting that witness in the world
[53:12] praise god we'll go further later but
[53:15] praise the lord because god has
[53:18] quickened you and raised you from the
[53:20] dead like he did them on the in the old
[53:22] testament and they met the others in the
[53:24] streets we are meeting the thing in the
[53:27] world
[53:28] and is speaking to us and revealing the
[53:31] word to us in this day and in this hour
[53:34] in which we live
[53:36] praise the lord hallelujah amen so
[53:40] we thank god for that hallelujah see
[53:44] oh my
[53:45] see the day that we are living in
[53:50] amen
[53:51] from this day we live when there is
[53:54] nothing no hopes left but the coming of
[53:57] the lord
[53:59] that's the revelation of jesus christ
[54:01] then we go here where he talks about job
[54:04] job was on the great strain like we are
[54:07] in this age and this time we are on the
[54:10] great strain and the devil is bringing
[54:13] the pressure down on your mind on your
[54:16] body on your family on your everything
[54:19] is bringing the pressure down that's why
[54:22] the prophet said only our eagles can be
[54:25] able to take that kind of pressure
[54:28] [Music]
[54:29] and they even use that pressure to rise
[54:32] up hallelujah on wings like eagles to
[54:35] the glory of god that if you're a hawk
[54:38] you're busted up amen
[54:40] praise the lord i'm glad for all of
[54:42] those those of you who are here and i
[54:44] give him glory for that amen now thank
[54:48] god now remember even his own wife
[54:53] turned against him
[54:55] see
[54:56] my god think of it and he had to tell
[54:59] her you talk as a foolish woman
[55:04] hallelujah amen
[55:06] you speak like a foolish woman
[55:09] now
[55:10] he says to her i come in this world
[55:13] without anything
[55:15] naked and i'll go out the same way and
[55:19] i'll still say blessed be the name of
[55:22] the lord
[55:23] if you're never that rich if you never
[55:26] got lofty in society if your name never
[55:29] went around the world i came with
[55:32] nothing i'm going with nothing but my
[55:34] character that come from god and i shall
[55:37] glory to god hallelujah thank you
[55:41] for what you've done for me amen
[55:44] remember
[55:46] think of it
[55:48] this man sitting out there
[55:51] with boils on him
[55:56] his kids
[55:57] all dead
[56:02] with poverty
[56:04] was a very the richest man of his day
[56:07] and all of a sudden he comes down to
[56:09] poverty
[56:12] his friends all turned against him
[56:17] even his church members
[56:21] turned against him
[56:23] and everything else
[56:26] and there he had to sit in an ash pile
[56:29] scraping himself
[56:32] what a miserable wretch
[56:35] that was
[56:38] none of this
[56:39] still
[56:41] never mind what happened
[56:43] he held to god's word
[56:48] remember he held to god's word why
[56:52] because he was an eagle
[56:56] why are you going to hold to the word
[56:58] you're not eager
[56:59] because you're an elected
[57:02] seed of the living god amen you all to
[57:06] god's holy word amen
[57:10] oh my think of it the sky spilled back
[57:14] the thunder's roared and he said i know
[57:18] my redeem olivia
[57:21] and at the last days look at the time
[57:24] when he's to see it at the last days
[57:27] he'll stand up on this earth
[57:30] hallelujah
[57:32] praise god and though the skin worms
[57:35] have destroyed this body bones and all
[57:39] the quickening power will still be in me
[57:42] hallelujah
[57:44] and i will see god for myself
[57:49] whom i shall see
[57:51] amen for myself and not another
[57:54] my eyes shall behold him
[57:57] praise be to god that's right
[58:00] amen brother bran speaking now though
[58:03] after my reigns be consumed skin worms
[58:07] remember
[58:08] skin worms don't come from somewhere
[58:11] else and then come to you
[58:14] the worm is already in your skin
[58:19] death working in this natural body
[58:22] amen did you notice
[58:25] if they put you into a coffin
[58:29] keep it airtight
[58:31] the bugs will still eat you up
[58:34] right see
[58:36] cause they're in you
[58:38] and so we can say
[58:41] you are just a bunch of bugs to begin
[58:44] with
[58:46] on the inside of your body
[58:48] though this skin worms destroys my flesh
[58:54] amen or my body
[58:56] yet in my flesh so he's speaking of two
[58:59] flesh
[59:00] he said no the skin worms destroy my
[59:04] body my flesh
[59:06] yet in my flesh
[59:08] i'll see god i want to tell you you have
[59:10] another body
[59:15] in the first body no man shall see god
[59:19] and live
[59:20] but in this next body i shall see him
[59:25] for myself
[59:27] praise god
[59:29] one is of the flesh and one of the
[59:32] spirit given by the living god
[59:36] hallelujah and on the resurrection
[59:39] morning hallelujah let's go to matthew
[59:42] he says 27
[59:46] 51-53
[59:47] after he was resurrected from the dead
[59:50] now let me stop here for a minute
[59:53] because it keep coming to me while i'm
[59:55] talking there that i explained to you
[59:57] the last days
[59:59] you see
[1:00:00] when job said i shall see him for myself
[1:00:04] and
[1:00:05] these different ones
[1:00:08] like it's taking me back again because
[1:00:10] remember from the beginning enoch saw
[1:00:13] him
[1:00:15] abraham saw him
[1:00:17] and then job is now saying i shall see
[1:00:20] him for myself
[1:00:22] you realize that praise god and you know
[1:00:25] jesus said it abraham rejoiced to see
[1:00:29] my day
[1:00:31] and he saw it
[1:00:32] and was glad praise god
[1:00:35] enoch saw the coming of the lord jude i
[1:00:38] believe it's 14 where he said and jude
[1:00:43] said the lord commit yes he's cometh
[1:00:46] with thousands of his saints
[1:00:48] so job saw the coming of the lord
[1:00:51] hallelujah praise god now you understand
[1:00:55] that when you say last days
[1:00:57] the last days to them pay tracks back
[1:01:00] there and their rapture just like we're
[1:01:03] looking for a rapture now but their last
[1:01:06] days was when jesus came
[1:01:09] and you see
[1:01:10] paul when he's speaking now and he's
[1:01:13] talking he believed that his last days
[1:01:15] were right then the rapture was going to
[1:01:18] take place any moment at that time but
[1:01:21] you see the church ages hasn't played
[1:01:23] out they're just about they just
[1:01:25] finished and just about to take the
[1:01:27] whole thing up so i want you to realize
[1:01:30] this that uh job is saying he's gonna
[1:01:33] see him for himself
[1:01:35] but his last day and his rapture is when
[1:01:39] he saw him in this old testament when he
[1:01:42] was raised up that's when they all saw
[1:01:45] him amen praise god and that's what the
[1:01:48] prophet is trying to point us to by
[1:01:50] going to uh
[1:01:53] matthew 27 51
[1:01:56] he suddenly moved from job and he's gone
[1:01:58] to matthew talking about the old
[1:01:59] testament saints but he's talking in the
[1:02:02] context that job says i shall see him
[1:02:06] for myself
[1:02:09] abraham see him
[1:02:11] enoch see him
[1:02:13] and here he says remember
[1:02:16] all them testament sins
[1:02:19] and i say this now that's claim they saw
[1:02:22] him and they're going to see him
[1:02:25] are now afforded the opportunity to see
[1:02:28] him for themselves
[1:02:30] because the bible says that many of them
[1:02:34] that slept in the dust of the earth come
[1:02:37] out to them graves
[1:02:39] entered in the city
[1:02:40] and appeared to marry
[1:02:43] walking with him quickening fire was
[1:02:46] upon them
[1:02:48] power upon them
[1:02:50] powering the bones of elijah when there
[1:02:52] was no more bones
[1:02:55] still that power was on job even when he
[1:02:59] wasn't a spoonful of dust left of his
[1:03:02] body the quick empire was still there
[1:03:05] upon him
[1:03:07] that spirit raised him up
[1:03:09] and if this spirit that raised jesus
[1:03:12] christ from the dead dwelling you he
[1:03:15] will do the same thing and quicken your
[1:03:18] mortal body even there's no just left
[1:03:21] whatsoever he'll raise up your mortal
[1:03:24] body
[1:03:26] amen
[1:03:27] oh my oh my you said oh i wish i lived
[1:03:32] back there
[1:03:33] like that when
[1:03:35] you see
[1:03:36] no
[1:03:37] he says you are living now in a better
[1:03:40] time
[1:03:42] amen put down this scripture now he's
[1:03:46] gone from that scripture to first
[1:03:48] thessalonians
[1:03:50] 4 16
[1:03:53] this saints
[1:03:54] them that sleep in christ
[1:03:57] god will bring with him
[1:04:00] you see
[1:04:01] you see them saints
[1:04:04] in the grave that are resting
[1:04:08] like elisha
[1:04:10] was resting see
[1:04:12] some of them
[1:04:14] will be quickened like elijah was
[1:04:17] and some will be taken
[1:04:20] from in the grave
[1:04:22] they will go
[1:04:24] for the bible tells us the trumpet of
[1:04:27] the lord shall sound
[1:04:29] and the dead and christ shall rise first
[1:04:32] and we which alive and remain shall be
[1:04:35] caught up hallelujah to be with the lord
[1:04:39] in the air
[1:04:41] in the clouds amen
[1:04:44] the quickening part do you see it he
[1:04:47] says quickening power on the living
[1:04:51] quickening power on the dead
[1:04:54] the quickening power was represented in
[1:04:57] voters and prophets
[1:04:59] the power of god
[1:05:01] elisha
[1:05:03] elijah
[1:05:04] don't you see even their names
[1:05:09] the male the female
[1:05:11] the bride the groom
[1:05:14] one of them mr jesus
[1:05:17] the other misses jesus
[1:05:20] oh my him
[1:05:23] he and she there see
[1:05:25] it was representing that
[1:05:29] because
[1:05:30] you see
[1:05:31] any board when it's ready to take its
[1:05:34] flight it needs them two wings that's
[1:05:37] right are you thinking you're spiritual
[1:05:39] here
[1:05:40] amen any bird ready to take its rapture
[1:05:44] it's got to have two wings it can't
[1:05:46] leave with one wing
[1:05:48] is that right they can't just leave with
[1:05:50] one wing you gotta leave with both wings
[1:05:53] right oh my see
[1:05:56] because that balances itself
[1:05:59] see
[1:06:00] now
[1:06:01] the church is represented right there in
[1:06:04] them two prophets
[1:06:06] for we which allah are alive
[1:06:10] and remain at the coming of the lord
[1:06:13] shall not hinder them which are asleep
[1:06:17] the living and the dead
[1:06:19] for the trumpet of god shall sound
[1:06:22] and then both wings shall come together
[1:06:26] amen old testament new testament
[1:06:30] hallelujah both wings
[1:06:32] will come together living and the dead
[1:06:36] the quickening power still lives today
[1:06:40] remember
[1:06:42] now
[1:06:43] you see
[1:06:44] we we are quickened to see
[1:06:47] these things
[1:06:49] wow watch the quickening power of it
[1:06:52] this day what it does
[1:06:54] we are quickened to see
[1:06:57] this day
[1:06:59] praise god
[1:07:00] oh
[1:07:01] my
[1:07:02] so in these last days when we are seeing
[1:07:07] this quickening power upon us
[1:07:11] he even
[1:07:12] quicken power to see the sick healed
[1:07:16] quickening power to seeing miracles
[1:07:20] among us hallelujah like it was in them
[1:07:24] early days hallelujah making the sick
[1:07:28] well and visions and like that what he
[1:07:32] is saying here the quickening power
[1:07:34] brought healing brought all kinds of
[1:07:37] miracles amongst them visions and
[1:07:39] discernments and everything but the
[1:07:41] quickening power is now here under the
[1:07:45] power of the turtle to quicken you and
[1:07:47] anoint you to see
[1:07:51] hallelujah
[1:07:53] now to go back i can't go back to all
[1:07:55] those things the building of the body
[1:07:56] which i've preached on many times right
[1:07:58] up through he says it comes right up
[1:08:01] until it gets to the seeing edge where
[1:08:03] the eyes now have to see what's there
[1:08:06] praise god and above the eyes then what

[1:15:01] when he died
[1:15:03] and priests took them souls that were in
[1:15:06] prison
[1:15:07] back into that theophany or how

[1:16:17] dissolved he went back to that this
[1:16:19] earthly tabernacle you see we have
[1:16:22] another one
[1:16:23] waiting now you see we have by past that
[1:16:27] one your theophany
[1:16:30] you bypass that one see
[1:16:32] and you come straight from god
[1:16:35] as an attribute are you listening amen
[1:16:39] to be
[1:16:40] come flesh
[1:16:43] to be tempted
[1:16:45] and tested by sin
[1:16:48] hallelujah
[1:16:50] oh my why
[1:16:51] that he might display to the devil and
[1:16:54] the world
[1:16:55] his attributes displaying his power and
[1:16:58] his glory
[1:17:00] right on the face of the earth in the
[1:17:02] middle of all the sin and the evil
[1:17:05] living holy in the midst of babylon
[1:17:08] living righteous in the midst of it try
[1:17:11] testing let me say what he says here or
[1:17:14] think of it
[1:17:16] and when this testing of his word
[1:17:20] is over
[1:17:22] see
[1:17:23] then we are taken up to this body he
[1:17:26] just said you by pasta theophany you
[1:17:29] come down here as an attribute or a part
[1:17:32] of the word of god
[1:17:33] but when this testing of this word
[1:17:37] that's down here on the earth is over
[1:17:40] amen hallelujah then we
[1:17:44] we are taken up to this to your funny
[1:17:48] body
[1:17:51] that was prepared for us when
[1:17:54] before he says
[1:17:56] for for the foundations of the world
[1:17:59] hallelujah oh praise god it is the word
[1:18:04] there that we skipped to come right
[1:18:08] down here
[1:18:10] so that we could be tempted and tested
[1:18:14] you see
[1:18:15] and if we had come through that
[1:18:17] there would have been no temptation
[1:18:20] see we don't know all things already
[1:18:24] that's the reason jesus knew all things
[1:18:27] see because he was the word before he
[1:18:31] was flesh and then he come down here to
[1:18:34] be the word
[1:18:36] but you
[1:18:37] bypass the theophany and come down here
[1:18:41] in flesh
[1:18:42] to be tested
[1:18:44] tried god sent us down here deliberately
[1:18:47] purposely because he had confidence in
[1:18:49] you they're gonna go down they're gonna
[1:18:51] accomplish the mission and then i can
[1:18:53] bring them all back by my grace amen
[1:18:56] hallelujah so god sent you down here and
[1:18:59] now you're in the middle of a sealed
[1:19:02] mission
[1:19:03] sealed orders
[1:19:05] glory god hallelujah oh my and you're
[1:19:09] fulfilling your mission on the power of
[1:19:11] god and when it's all over he says he
[1:19:14] catches them up and he brings them back
[1:19:16] up back to that body that they should
[1:19:19] have had from the very beginning that
[1:19:20] they're fighting you'll bypass it man
[1:19:22] how he brings you right back to it oh
[1:19:25] praise god hallelujah
[1:19:28] see if we had to come through that body
[1:19:31] there
[1:19:32] there'd be no temptation
[1:19:34] we would have known all things
[1:19:36] that's the reason jesus knew all things
[1:19:39] because he was the word
[1:19:41] before he was fleshed
[1:19:43] then he become
[1:19:45] the word
[1:19:46] here we are formed by
[1:19:49] to the word image
[1:19:51] to be a partaker of the word

[1:21:03] while but but it can't satisfy you

[1:21:51] days but after a while fluttering on the
[1:21:54] window is the husband knocking

[1:23:44] all that quote comes from
[1:23:46] who is this melchizedek
[1:23:49] and i'm taking the time to
[1:23:51] say it so that you can go look it up
[1:23:53] afterwards
[1:23:55] now
[1:23:55] think of this
[1:23:58] there a king got in trouble
[1:24:01] before the blood of jesus was shed
[1:24:04] he was in paradise
[1:24:07] and the witch of endor called for
[1:24:10] somebody to come
[1:24:12] and to console saul
[1:24:15] and the witch saw that him standing
[1:24:18] there
[1:24:19] and she said i see god raising up out of
[1:24:22] the earth and after that man that samuel
[1:24:26] is talking about the prophet
[1:24:28] have been dead
[1:24:31] buried
[1:24:32] and rotted away in a grave
[1:24:35] yet here he was
[1:24:37] standing with his prophet's robes on
[1:24:41] and was still a
[1:24:42] prophet and he said why did you call me
[1:24:46] out of my rest
[1:24:48] sing you are an enemy of god
[1:24:51] watch him prophesy tomorrow night
[1:24:54] by this time you will be with me
[1:24:59] that which is going to be dead for what
[1:25:01] she did but nevertheless say this this
[1:25:04] is this whatever to solve amen see he
[1:25:07] was still a prophet
[1:25:10] though he was gone from that body
[1:25:12] but he had come back here
[1:25:14] and was now a part of that word
[1:25:19] and had entered into that flesh the
[1:25:22] theophany
[1:25:24] right he had then so he looked the same
[1:25:26] it don't change look the same praise god
[1:25:29] but it's not the same flesh all flesh
[1:25:31] paul said it's not the same flesh he
[1:25:33] says bodies terrestrial bodies this then
[1:25:36] we body celestial amen see wonderful
[1:25:39] isn't it
[1:25:40] wonderful praise be to god hallelujah oh
[1:25:44] my
[1:25:45] think of it
[1:25:46] you see he had entered into the geophony
[1:25:50] which was the word
[1:25:52] and that's where we
[1:25:54] all as believers go to when we are
[1:25:58] turned around from here
[1:26:01] praise god you come on your journey you
[1:26:03] come to the end and he turns you right
[1:26:04] back to go back home he said when you
[1:26:06] get turned around from here we all going
[1:26:09] back to that that we bypass and we go
[1:26:12] right back into that theophany whether
[1:26:15] you're alive you're going you're you're
[1:26:17] going to be caught up into it if you're
[1:26:19] dead you're going to be quickened and
[1:26:20] raised up into it but you're going back
[1:26:23] to it

[1:33:00] he never had a time when he even began
[1:33:04] he he never has a time when he will end

[1:33:54] lot of these natural things we call the
[1:33:56] system
[1:33:57] propagate that until it's fixated even
[1:34:00] to some people in the message they're
[1:34:02] still thinking on that plane but we come
[1:34:05] to be caught up higher to a higher
[1:34:08] dimension of the world where we can see
[1:34:11] clearly these things what god is saying
[1:34:13] to us praise god hallelujah see oh my
[1:34:17] and he met the king of that salem
[1:34:21] coming down
