i didn't hear nobody's voice praise the lord hallelujah you know wherever the lord jesus christ is there is always a noise so when we come here we have to prepare to worship to make a joyful noise to

lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him i in him will i trust surely he shall deliver from he shall read it surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the forearm and from the noisome tesla he shall cover thee with his fears and under his wings shall now trust his trust shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that friday by day

home safely to us and we thank god for our pastor may who i appreciate for us i'm gonna give him let's give him a thousand [Applause] we thank god for giving us a shepherd after his own heart and with that gift has helped every one of us and we appreciate god and we thank god for his gifts amen so we thank god for him all the time and none of us can deny the fact that god has used him to feed all of us for all these years amen praise god so you really thank god for him and without wasting much time i'll let's take our scriptures and read matthew chapter 6 verse 28 to 34 and jeremiah 1 5. if you found it you say amen okay he said in matthew chapter 6 verse 28 to 34 it says that and why take your thoughts for arraignment consider the release of the field how they grow they told not neither do they spend and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these because solomon's clothes has no life but they nearly have life in them amen praise god continue wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you oh ye of little faith therefore take no thoughts saying what we should eat because we live economic crisis now and god is encouraging you that don't look at the condition at the present time and look to him amen or what shall we drink or where with us shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek those who are christ that's all that they seek because they have no hope amen we have hope in christ amen for your heavenly father knows that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for tomorrow for the morrow shy thick thought for the things of itself sufficient of the day is evil thereof jeremiah 1 5. jeremiah is after isaiah before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou comest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and i will then be and i know then be a prophet unto the nations if our title that nothing can hinder your purpose your purpose will be achieved no matter what the circumstances let's pray oh our gracious eternal god we thank you for the privilege you have given to us to be here oh god you know why every people's before the foundations of the world that you'll be here i'll be standing here not me but you will come and speak through me to be a blessing to your children i pray god if there's anything like me i bring it to the author may the holy ghost bend every trace anything all i came away may your spirit come forth and speak to your pride of christ your wives oh god i pray that i take every spirit under my country in the name of jesus may the spirit of christ have reminisce oh god the purpose of preaching is the lord that people's hearts need to be met so i pray in the name of jesus you that knows the heart of the people you that knows what they are desiring this morning may you please speak to their heart desire and encourage us and increase our faith we thank you may you be seated hallelujah um grace can you put on the kingsman redeemer for me 61-02 he said consider the illness of the field how they toil and spain neither neither i say i say and yes solomon of all his glory a lily has to struggle day and night to get the radiance to keep his garments to keep the perfume and things going and others he just opened himself and they come up and take it out of him the bee and the flying everything comes by good or bad just take from him that's the way the servant is of christ the christian servant opens himself up just take from me the world there's nothing for himself it's for the others that's what christ became when he became king false race he became man that the world might partake of his righteousness in the mid sense of god and i think one more and as he said said one time consider the lewis and yet i say unto you that solomon identified masterpiece of god and as and as yet i saw unto you that solomon all of his glory was not arrayed like one solomon in all of his glory was a magnificent sight there is no doubt it was a great thing to the world and a great man before god the solomon's robe as i said didn't have no life in it it was a piece of material probably shed of a sheep's back but they really had life what we need today is the life of christ inside of us that's what purifies not the art world a thin around color or a degree psychology or something it takes the power of the resurrected christ to make us what we should be god has no other plan than let the holy spirit rule and reign in the church amen so if the holy ghost is the one that is ruling and reigning in the church then that church nothing can hinder its purpose so as i started with the lilies the lilies have life but the lilies has a purpose and a toys night and day to achieve that purpose and if someone is passing by and smells the perfume of that lily that lily has served its purpose amen so it's you and me when we are out there when people are i need dying left and right people have no hope they are grieved the economy shambles some their children in despair they are going through a lot of turmoil but just a smile from you just some word of encouragement it lifted someone's heart up and i encourage you today i'll just keep on on it till i finish tonight this this afternoon or this morning that unless god is finished with you whatever god has purposed in your life it will come to pass amen nothing can hinder it amen one time god made a promise to abraham he said after 400 yes i will bring your people out from the from the bondage and that country that deal with that i'm going to deal with that promise was lying there for for so many years when that 400 years came god didn't wait for moses to be born he knew moses is going to fulfill that part amen praise god hallelujah and before moses was born you know what the devil is dumping on me anyway because everything went for god's purpose god wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a healer but the devil thought that he was going to trick eve to commit adultery not knowing that he was going to let god's purpose come to pass amen so is the devil doing because before moses was born the devil was mad there arose a pharaoh who did not know joseph there is going to be a pharaoh there is going to be and i think we are just in that time who does not know freedom of religion amen hallelujah and brethren and sisters they don't know the freedom of religion but what god has deposited inside of us a to fight that battle because what i'm trying to say is that what god does he placed himself in that man so he'll place some faith inside of us he'll do something for us to be able to encounter that spirit how are you gonna fight it i don't know because i believe that god has a plan and his plan was that moses was going to fulfill that part and god also for this purpose pharaoh was was created for his heart to be hidden so god has a plan god has a purpose the devil tried to go ahead of god's plan and a pharaoh razor that fellow did not know joseph he started to put them in slavery put hardship on the people and he made the law what i'm trying to say is that we are christians and we are law abiding people we obey the loss of the land but if the laws of the land is contrary to this word of god we go by this amen i believe that's faith that was deposited in moses mom and dad and they were not scared of the law of the land because the devil controls the world i'm not saying that every politician is from the devil but remember when he met god on that desert on that month temptations he told him that i'll give you all the world it means that he controls the world not everybody in the policies is from him but he controls them amen so he controls so when he tries to use that medium to bring loss against this and when that thing came me um moses mom and dad were from the priesthood from the land of levi they were not scared of the lord they didn't care what pharaoh was saying they are praised for the delivery the bible says that people will seek my face and cry and repent i will hear their prayer so the children of israel they began to pray i believe that moses mom and dad began to pray and as hardship is going i believe every christian is beginning to pray amen they began to pray and pray and while god gave them the son they were not scared about the law of the land we thank god for those midwives from the jewish language they said we cannot do that and kill all the male children no we are not doing that and they said oh king pharaoh before we get there they deliver so fast so we can't do nothing about them and frank got so mad so he took that loss between her into his own hand and let the egyptians do their job to kill every male child oh man when moses mom was not scared his dad was not scared they kept their child for three months amen and you know what they were not scared to put them in that river now even though there was scorpions there could be allegations there'll be everything in there now their faith was so much in god that they believed that god will save their son they will have that confidence in their god that is more than able to take care of their son amen i believe that the crocodiles and all the other river day when they saw moses they ran away because why god's angels were protecting his gift amen because he has to fulfill that question nobody else can fulfill that portion and no one can take your place whatever god has told you to fulfill brad gabriel you will fulfill it no demons in hell can come against that fulfillment it will come to pass one day although it might once they said that mission would long whatever the soul come to pass amen so their parents were not scared hallelujah oh man i'm so excited how god was so mindful of escaped how god protect you in the womb of your mama many affairs who have been time before we've been born by the spirit of christ protected us all these years and that strength was protecting moses and the good part of it is that god allowed moses mom to train her own son and be paid for that man what a god that we are serving he protected your son and he let you get paid for raising your old son man don't you love this mighty god amen when in the midst of tribulation when there was a farming in egypt there was a food in goshen and i said that we're going out with what a great substance the first exercise they went with great substance we are living with great substance you say but i feel it with this economic condition i don't know how we're going to go but my faith is in the word of god i believe god with all my heart because you know what faith does not look at circumstances a perfect faith oh man this masters every circumstances it's not looking at what the people are saying he deny what my eyes is saying he deny what i'm hearing it only tuned to this world of god that's the promise of god oh hi david said i've been young and old i've never seen a righteous forsaken all his breasts his children begging bread to eat he's the same god he'll take care of us oh man he'll bless us abundantly oh man it's a faith that movement tastes oh man it's a perfect faith but america that perfect faith is beyond entertaining it moved mountains oh my brain tends to pass oh glory to his name amen i'm just getting out of myself praise thy wonderful jesus amen he didn't look at that loss amen he looked to that promise oh god is so good all the time he's wonderful jesus hallelujah amen and has always been the same and when moses after receiving all his education and training so is you and me because there is going to be a clash there is a greater battle fight going on now you have war in ukraine you have won so many places there's a greatest battle going on moses was training in all the wisdom of egypt when the time came his own brothers denied him that you know what thought that they have refused him but god took him to the executive the destiny sorry and it took me out somewhere that mountain so why you met his wife and god was training him and the devil was australian in his fair promises amen so we are not training god is training us why do you think you allow us to go through trials and tribulations he's training us we are in the training amen the devil is joining his people for wealth council of churches god is training us amen there is going to be a clash amen hallelujah hallelujah god is going to show his bride unlike um when the king asks vassi to come and show her beauty vastly refused by the true bride of christ we type esther will not refuse that he's gonna come up to the call and show himself out because it's not hell doing that is the lord in the bride going to show herself again that peace of that chinese thing is going to take place and manifest christ and let the people see god in france amen they seen it in our lifestyle he said that you're so resurrected isn't it amen it's a process leading to an event so you end up training to fall for the final clash amen and it's just around the corner just be ready because it's coming it's here everything is painting oh man this is the time no any other time we have been seeing the manifestation the fulfillment of scriptures we used to say it is coming this is coming that is coming that is coming but now you can say it's here this is here that is yeah that is yeah it's manifestation time you have no choice every seed will bring forth of its kind whatever is hiding in you it has to manifest whatever purpose that god brought you to this world it will be manifest whether you like it or not amen for this course you were created for this purpose i purpose in my heart when you speak past this master you can't speak once amen and you fulfill that portion no one can take your place oh man we've gone to a place that we pass that path oh man whatever god brought you in this world to fulfill nobody if you're a finger you cannot be a a a head if you're ahead you cannot be a tool whatever person that you are to fulfill nobody can take your place you cannot take any body place so don't let any any jealous come to your mind it's not going to work either you like it or not so don't worry about somebody's business seek your own salvation with fear and trembling even as the time approaches there is no any other time that we have to be serious for ourself examine your heart examine your own self if you are in your faith and if god has revealed to you then you have to step on and stand on the promises and believe with all your heart that nothing will shake you up amen no circumstances no temptations never no trust no matter what you go through our lord is god's gonna see us through and i am going through no matter what other state i am going through there is a race i must run there is a victory oh man we have to get no matter what i am going through amen you are going through black coffee yes sir no matter what happens we are going through no demon in hell can stop it amen it's time to go home oh man your purpose will be achieved your purpose will come to pass don't worry about the circumstances don't worry about your children just commit them to god he is more than able to tell them around he is more than able to change every circumstances he's more than able to bring your needs to pass he's more than able to change everything oh one time when the children of israel were going the rest he was on the way oh man and the god was so angry that rest they had to pass for them to pass through oh man why the pressure on your heart was a river that you cannot cross god will cross it for you it's not your faith it's his faith in you it's inciting you it's himself gonna do that through your mother body hallelujah you have to be grateful to god for calling us amen today swear of living god amen our god is able oh hallelujah to bring us through every circumstances no matter what cover comes our way he is able to do it hallelujah glory to his wonderful name praise our wonderful jesus amen our god is good all the time yeah so this enemy hasn't stopped he used the state in the time of daniel he thought he was going to destroy daniel not knowing god also has a plan he wanted to demonstrate himself for the people to know that he's a god over the lions he's the god of all those animals so when the that the king made a law and that law was contrary to the word of god because like they told us to take their sins we obey we took it because it's the law of the land we respect that but when it came when daniel was told to worship his own image he said no no no no no no no all the other girls they are the worst of men amen you are jehovah jairo i am not going to obey this law because this law is contrary to my word so i am not obeying that so it says if a time comes and they tell us not to baptize jesus name now i know because there is no any other thing that you might be saved by the name of jesus christ is the name above all names amen so when he was told not to worship god he said no you guys are fine because daniel was gonna pretend that mike all the time he was praying three times a day so when the time came do not pray he told them i am not obeying this law i am not arrogant but i worship god because our prime purpose is to worship the lord jesus christ that's the main purpose we are here to worship him in truth and spirit with all our minds with all our soul with everything within us is to worship the true living god who is there is the lord and savior jesus christ no any other god amen some people say well i don't worship some worship their cast they worship their wives they worship everything where we watching the lord jesus christ we are you have danielle's got honor daniel's god will never fear us amen that the lion could not do nothing to daniel when the time came the angels shot you know what daniel didn't know how this was going to happen but he has confidence in god and he went in there and before any lion could do anything whether they shut up their mouth he said you shut up my prophet is here do not touch my anointing do my prophets know how amen and that lie online lou and they were scared they were shocked and there were three hebrew children who also obey danielle's instructions and when they were also told that if they worship god brother sister we have to thank god for our freedom of religion why we are worshiping while we are enjoying it let's enjoy it now if you don't know what is coming but we have to enjoy what we have the hebrew children were told not to worship god and they said no no no no no no no we know our god is able to deliver us but even if we chose not to we are not bound down to its image that's the sound of a true believer you know god will deliver you from the cancer you have confidence he will deliver you from any afflictions that you are in but even if you chose not to you will still give him thanks you say give me praise you say give me that glory and anna oh my goodness praise god i was telling the people in petroleum that there's only one person that's saved nobody god not leave salvation in anybody's mind he reserve it to himself to whatever god does he is right we just have to thank him for everything he has done not the chance of the hell of you right that was the attitude that the three hebrew children have and when you get to a place that you are in love with god so much not from your lips then from inside of your soul and your heart you made that declaration i believe that all the angels but abraham will express something like when they made that declaration those angels says oh let me go and do this everybody want to what go and fight for those hebrew children he said man you just wait i will take care of the business myself i know when they were thrown into that fire but i thought there was a fourth man they said they look how to walk like the son of man hallelujah so whatever they throw you into just believe there will be a fourth man and even if you chose not to god is so right that's the attitude god is right whatever god does is perfect oh man we don't have to worry about anything i i told those churches petroleum i'm still saying that before i have to be honest i used to worry about past oh i should have done this oh i could have said this oh i could have done this but for now god is my witness i don't worry about past anymore i'm so certain of god that whatever happens god is right i'm more relaxed than ever i have that confidence in god that i'm serving that even my mistakes it's always plans it was all part of his place for me those mistakes i was supposed to do it it happened is gone i'm not worried my head about it anymore i'm not worried about the future i see red take note of for tomorrow tomorrow will take care of itself i want the present day of his ministry i want the real the manner for today there were the carcass that the egos would be gathered for the fresh food fresh anointing i want that presence today i wanted anointing the presence of the holy ghost in my conscience in my soul every part of me that god will take absolute control and manifest himself daily daily thing hardly a fresh manner fresh from his presence that's why i'm worried that's what i'm i need of i need him today every hour every minute every second that he will come forth that he will manifest himself that he will do what he wants to do that's all because we worry about tomorrow it gives you anxiety and appreciation god will take you off tomorrow oh man i i i i listen i got to a place brother sister that this god if he's able to deliver me from alcohol from the things of the world and has kept me for all this 20-something years what else god cannot do for me and my confidence is in him so much that god will take out business so i love him back because listen i wasn't looking for god i wasn't searching for him he came to me on calvary he came to me and he has come to me and kept me oh this delivered me something that was holding me i couldn't get away from it i tried my own self and didn't work but when it came to me something said feel it it's not you the same person when you stop this alcohol you're gonna stop my problem where did it go god took care of business and if he has taken care of that business my confidence that he gonna see me true no matter what happened today what happened tomorrow no matter what circumstances no matter what i'm going through my confidence is that god who took care of me before would take care of me again i believe that the same confidence that david had he wasn't scared of goliath he wasn't scared about the circumstances it's the same fate that joshua and caleb had because they seen god taking them and supplying the manner where there was no food they saw god open the red sea oh my the same god my game that took care of that blessing and everything they said you will take care of those circumcised philistines those joints are nothing our god is able those unbelievers were shaking they were looking at their child they were looking at the size of those people man but the real fate does not look at the circumstances you know what the difference between faith and hope who believe it will happen the same way faith belief but hope just stop when you look at the circumstances when you see the doctor saying this is not possible then all the hope is fading away but faith lose beyond hope it lose beyond that it knows beyond what your eyes are seeing that's why the bible said abraham never started at the promise of god he was constantly giving praise to god why didn't look at the circumstances and today i encourage you no matter what circumstances you are facing don't look at your circumstances look at the promise of god whatever you have need of it will come to pass if you put your heart on jesus it will happen how it's gonna happen i don't know but i told you but i have that confidence it will come to pass because i'm not serving a dead god i'm saving a living god his name is the lord jesus christ he is able brother and sister oh man to feed five thousand with five loaves of bread he's able oh man he has confidence on whom who he is and he knew that purpose would come to pass because why it has been in the scripture that i will not leave my holy one in hell neither will i suffer his body to us to see corruption so he wasn't scared what confidence what scripture what is it that god is revealing to you you have to have confidence that your purpose on this earth will be will not finish unless god is finished with you oh man if listen i always pray that god please let me leave to take off my children till they get married whatever they get the gratitude and everything but you know i've come to a place that i have confidence in god so much if he tells me to put my house in order i know you take off my family for me i don't care what it is i know i want to see that way but you have to have that faith and confidence in god that when he tells you your time is up you just have to be ready to go because he that took care of you is able to take care of your children that's the confidence you have to have oh man that's why the king was so worried that oh lord i need 15 years to do this to do that but god said put your house in honor he didn't want god perfect well he went for the permissive world and within that 15 years he backslided because dog knows best he knows what is good for you so we have to love him so much that when he says time home say god i'm ready to go i believe you take off my children you take up everything because god that take up that i didn't come to this world anything i didn't have nothing and he has brought me that's why he will take care of them my confidence is going that way amen we have to have that place that god is able to take off every situation don't worry he's still god oh man his only belief all things are possible oh glory to thy name amen and amen thank you jesus hallelujah praise our wonderful jesus amen god is good all the time oh glory to thy name listen there are a couple of things that the enemy uses to try to hinder god's children to achieve their purpose but still going to work for god's glory what the devil did god raised something to be someone to live by the children of israel to destroy the enemy to destroy the philistines what the devil did he sidetracked him with lyla is that right he start tracking with delilah but god has purpose that something's gonna destroy the children of philistines it doesn't matter how the devil used delilah that purpose could not be kingdom it still have to come to pass and you know what samson did that's what most of people stopped to do something the devil thought he has got him they took off his eyes been led by another child didn't have anything and it's everything that every sin seems that everything is gone there's something repented he cried onto god and said oh lord jesus please one more time forgive me please forgive me for everything i've done that's what we have to do when we make wrong we have to be respect we got to make things right sometimes you do something to your brother you wanna face your face save your face you are afraid you look you you scared you don't want to admit your fault you have to go to that brother and make things right it doesn't matter how you look bad in the eyes of the people i would rather look back in the eyes of the people that are in the eyes of god because once you make that thing right it will take any blockage from your prayer and things will happen amen that's why the scripture says that you know what the catholic people what they did they just kind of mangled the scriptures is that right they have something they're called purgatory or whatever purgatory or whatever is this paging the right interviews they purging your soul but you don't die before somebody pay money for you together you know that's why they have twice the scriptures but a true christian we are purging our soul every day by repentance asking god for forgiveness that's why the bible said that he that believeth on me shall pass from all death unto life will not come unto a condemnation you will not come to where the word of god is judging us now so it's very important that we repent of our mistakes of the things that we make it wrong the word is purging your soul paging anything like christ from you and samson recognized that so he maintains right and the purpose that god brought him to this world it was it accomplished the bible said that he killed more people when he repented on that day than all his life what he has achieved so your purpose nothing will hinder the plans god has for you understand it to come to pass nobody can take your place that promise in the word of god for him it will come to pass how i don't know that it will be achieved amen hallelujah amen praise god and one more other thing you know it was god sometimes you wanna see supernatural you wanna see more of god but it comes the price those times the devil comes face to face to attack him god wanted to show just take the curtain off for job to see beyond the kitten of time to see beyond what's going to happen but he has to go through all that he lost his children he lost everything he went through all those trials and when job got to a place that god took his wife even denied him he said hey boy cares god he said you speaking like a foolish woman he didn't say you are foolish i said you speaking like that so i speak like that and god lived that kitten and job saw it he saw the lord jesus christ the coming raptures oh i know my original limit and everything was like god amen praise god so when you want to see god when you want those supernatural it's not going to come easy so most of the time that the best things happens when we are down in the valley not when you are up over the mountain that's why the br brahms said you wait until they put that pressure on that there you see these things that you are seeing will literally work but it's here we are manifesting that we are going through that slowly and the final phase will happen we are in the infancy stage so you go through that it's not easy but god will get the glory he will manifest himself he'll calm down proof he'll prove to job and open the kitten of time he wrote my redeemer leave it he saw the coming me so i saw the raptor he saw everything said even skim worm destroy this body in my flesh i'll see god oh man that's the god we are serving praise god he's not a dead god he's a living god praise god i'm gonna um i'm gonna a couple of years okay let's go ahead and have more time and another thing the religious leaders they are always because they hide behind the political power to put pressure on the true children of god and god has not changed remember that peter god gave them the power but they didn't have the faith the perfect faith to operate the power they gave them power to cast their devils they did all that but when they brought in matthew 17 when they brought that uh the creep whatever i think they could not heal that individual and they asked the lord why couldn't we do it he said what lack of faith and that lack of faith was a perfect faith because if you read down there might 2 17 he said that if you have faith like what a mustard seed and master seed faith is a pure faith it doesn't mix with anything but you know what after they receive the holy ghost because remember peter denied god he was scary man and one time wasn't even angry with god when bruh bro bro this one was saying that he feed my lamb feed my cheek she might get angry is that right he did all that but after he received the holy ghost he wasn't scared of anybody and he said where's rabbi jones and if you go and read acts chapter 4 verse 12 going down there they told him and john they're religious people don't mention this name anymore and they were bold and told them should we listen to man oh god this is what is going to happen now this is what is going place is coming to a time that are we going to listen the law of the land tells you don't baptize in his death baptizing the father and holy ghost or do what that denomination people are doing then the true bride of christ i have the holy ghost in them who have changed now that change is already in progress to the final face you gonna have that boldness and say no i'm worshiping god i'm baptizing his name he said there's no any other name where you might be saved by the name of jesus it's a name that demons fear and tremble is the name that every knee shall bow of faith in heaven and of faith in everything you do is i do it in my name so we gonna stand behind what we believe just gonna be peter it wasn't 10 it was the spirit of christ the holy ghost in them that gave them the boldness and said she will listen to man or god and the people left them alone because peter has that inspiration that his purpose was not finished yet because god jesus had told him that they will lead you by then you're gonna be old so those who cannot do nothing to him so it's you and me our purpose is not finished until the final phase of the rapture until god raptures his heart from here so our confidence to be in god more than ever knowing that no matter what they say if it's contrary to this word of god we are standing by this by what the bible said know what man is saying man do not fear any man job said why do you worry about man he is just like a flower he come today you go on tomorrow our confidence is in god's word and we are the last people fulfilled we are the manifestation of the prophet's message that malachi 4 5 that was we had a manifestation of that luke 17 30 returning the bright green that the son of man revealed again in their bright form hallelujah in revelation 10 8 11 says john your book would work bitter says sweet in your mind gonna be bitter in your stomach edward prophesied again all the scriptures we are the fulfillment of those so what man are you scared of man to come and tell you how to worship your god what time david wife was trying to tell him how to worship his god he said let me show you some more skills he didn't worry he wasn't worried about that wife you should have to listen to a man if it's contrary to this word this thing here is our absolute with the message that god sent to the prophet to us the two of them is absolute and i believe everywhere that the prophet said with a revelation of it the thing is it's not how much you know because those that will come the 11th hour those levels are people they don't have to have all the revelation and all the things that we have all these years just one revelation that housewife needs one revelation and then he's having the same pain as you so it's not how much you know is how much the giver is behind your skin that's what matters that's what's important have you been in contact with that pillar of fire have been in contact with god yourself how much god is in your skin inside of you hiding behind you not the knowledge the knowledge part is good where you need that dynamics is the spirit that quickened that way amen hallelujah so it's the same pain so don't worry just get what god has revealed to you put it to work because you that have been given many much is required of you it's according to how much you have received you're going to give an account of that that's why you cannot compare ourselves with anybody because it depends on how much god has revealed to you certain things he will not permit you to do he'll permit others to do based on how much they have received so nobody judge anybody gone are the days when people want you to follow the same way they see things how god is dealing their life they want to make a copycat there is no copycats there's one brother michael amen there's no more black mike one and only bro mike you can never have two of them you see what i mean you are unique by this one nobody can come complicated of you and you cannot be complicated of anybody so we have we are free i just saw i'm just gonna end up over here you are free when you really recognize that and that becomes so real to you you become so free you're not jealous of anybody even if you genuinely make sense because you can't have it so why it's for that individual you have to appreciate him and support when people are greetings for god support them leave them out amen yes sir let's support our pastor as the brother said lifting man the more you go outside the more you get blessed the more you'll not get blessed just support the gifts you see people doing things for god support them amen you are people they don't have time for themselves but you don't have time for that those times are gone because listen this time i don't argue with nobody about the scripture my intention to help the people to receive the holy ghost to receive this truth no time for argument f is for them the bible said that no one comes the father except what i call him first and even the book of i said nobody join it unless god was added to the church so you cannot convert nobody you cannot change somebody's doctrine you can just wave so you don't argue and follow this minister this minister this that that we follow the lord jesus christ and the shepherd god has given to us here we follow him and follow the prophet of god that's it because he said you follow me as i follow jesus amen hallelujah i saw branton i don't have much to say i think in conclusion i can just prepare to come i'll talk about um joseph another thing that happened in his life god gave him a dream his brothers was going to walk worship him and they were so jealous we're gonna worship you no way so they tried to step in to destroy him it was the devil that went to his brothers but he didn't know that it was all working for the plan of god amen to cut him off but god said you you're gonna be a leader they're gonna worship you and joseph was not worried he has confidence in god that called him if anybody has the right to complain was joseph because his brothers saw him he went to a place he's trying to be faithful to his to his master the master's wife put lie on him he tried to do everything but if he was always there sometimes a true christians after your life you might feel it that you are cursed but then devil fight you every step of the way but that sin will come forth at the right time to manifest christ the purpose that god brought you here come to pass nothing i want nobody to live here today without having that in your your whole body that nothing can take you from this earth unless your purpose is accomplished whatever god brought you to here to do nobody can hinder that they might try for a time but it do not end amen and joseph eventually what happened his brothers bowed down to him because god has purpose that joseph was special and wherever he went was a prosperity amen so it's just simple like that so no matter what the people do what god has talked about you it will come to pass it's simple like that simple amen hallelujah i think that's what happened and tony amen [Applause] thank you brad gabriel sorry sister hallelujah thank god for his crazy
