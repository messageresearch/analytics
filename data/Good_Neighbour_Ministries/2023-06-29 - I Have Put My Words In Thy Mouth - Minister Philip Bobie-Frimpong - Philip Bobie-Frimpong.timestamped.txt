[28:57] [Music]
[29:13] [Music]
[29:15] things
[29:16] [Music]
[29:27] foreign
[29:30] [Music]
[29:57] [Music]
[30:11] did not do it in the first place it's
[30:13] just the flesh
[30:15] but you are Justified
[30:20] when we come to church
[30:22] the only couple reasons that we came
[30:25] that God
[30:27] to help us to overcome things that we
[30:30] make mistakes and to dress closer to him
[30:33] so when we come here
[30:36] we have that confidence that he's here
[30:38] that's what I say where two or three I
[30:40] gathered in your name I'll be in your
[30:42] midst and if you know that we're coming
[30:45] here to commune with God then if who was
[30:49] to be more reverence and also
[30:53] to Cast Away all everything that
[30:55] happened in the daytime because it's a
[30:57] midweek we've been working and some
[30:59] people might have stepped our toes and
[31:01] everything but we have to cast
[31:03] everything out so that God could be a
[31:07] blessing to us because we are not here
[31:09] to listen to see your mind you came here
[31:13] to hear from God Amen so if you have
[31:16] that mentality
[31:18] you'll be blessed amen because if you
[31:21] want to look at there's nothing that I
[31:22] can do I can't do anything but he that
[31:26] makes the difference okay so we can
[31:29] place it now
[31:30] and
[31:33] without wasting much time so I can read
[31:35] my scriptures
[31:36] to have three scriptures yeah
[31:41] and second Corinthians
[31:44] chapter 12 verse 9
[32:05] and he said unto me my grace is
[32:08] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[32:12] made perfect
[32:14] in weakness
[32:15] most gladly therefore will I write that
[32:19] glory in my infirmities that the power
[32:22] of Christ May rest upon me
[32:25] and therefore I take pleasure in
[32:27] infirmities in reproaches in Necessities
[32:30] in persecutions in distress for Christ's
[32:34] sake for when I am weak then I am strong
[32:38] Jeremiah 1 1-9
[32:48] Jeremiah chapter 1 verse 1 to 9.
[32:51] the words of Jeremiah
[32:54] the son
[32:56] of hilkai of the priests that were anal
[33:00] thought in the land of Benjamin
[33:04] to whom the word of the Lord came
[33:07] in the days of Joseph the son of Amon
[33:10] king of Judah in the 13th year of his
[33:14] reign
[33:16] it came also in the days of Joachim the
[33:19] son of Joseph
[33:20] king of Judah unto the end of the 11th
[33:23] year of zedekiah the son of Josiah king
[33:27] of Judah unto the carrying away of
[33:29] Jerusalem captive in the fifth month
[33:33] then the word of the Lord came unto me
[33:36] saying
[33:37] before I formed thee in the belly I knew
[33:42] thee
[33:44] and before thou came as fought out of
[33:46] the womb I Sanctified thee
[33:51] and I or then be a prophet
[33:54] unto the Nations then said die
[33:58] I ah Lord God behold I cannot speak for
[34:02] I Am a Child
[34:04] but the law said unto me say not I'm a
[34:07] child
[34:08] for Thou shalt go to all that I shall
[34:11] send thee and whatsoever I command thee
[34:14] thou shall speak
[34:17] be not afraid
[34:19] of their faces
[34:22] for I am with you to deliver thee said
[34:25] the Lord
[34:26] then the Lord put forth his hand and
[34:29] touched my mouth
[34:31] and the Lord said unto me behold I have
[34:33] put my words in thy mouth that is my
[34:38] my topic or my my title started I have
[34:43] put my words in thy mouth and then in
[34:47] Mark 11 23 24
[34:53] Mark 11 23 24.
[34:56] for very I told you that whosoever shall
[34:59] say unto this mountain be thou removed
[35:02] and be thou cast into the sea and shall
[35:05] not doubt in his heart but shall believe
[35:07] that those things which he said shall
[35:09] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[35:13] said therefore as soon to you whatsoever
[35:16] things is that when you pray believe
[35:18] that you receive with them and you shall
[35:20] have them let's pray oh I get a Heavenly
[35:24] most gracious Eternal God

[35:32] have made a way for us to be here
[35:33] tonight
[35:34] Lord search our heart don't leave mine
[35:37] out if you have done anything during the
[35:39] day forgive us
[35:41] oh God may you come once more and speak
[35:45] to your children as you did in the cool
[35:47] of the evening and spoke to Adam the
[35:49] same God we believe you are here because
[35:51] your word cleanse there's way too or
[35:53] throughout guided in your name you will
[35:56] be in our midst so many times we speak
[35:59] that will get help get ourselves out of
[36:01] the way Lord but tonight we mean it from
[36:04] the depth of our heart not just the
[36:07] words that father you take us aside and
[36:10] be able to flow through and bless your
[36:12] children it's just means so real to me
[36:15] father and I I just pray that I don't
[36:18] want to be project myself here but may
[36:21] your spirit project and bless your
[36:24] children tonight you come against any
[36:27] contrary Spirit may the great Holy Ghost
[36:30] have remnants and come and bless your
[36:33] children amen please be seated
[36:41] of his um I'm just gonna read this here
[36:45] perfect
[36:47] strength by Perfect weakness by Reverend
[36:50] William Myron Brown
[36:52] paragraph 56-57
[36:55] it says the important thing
[36:58] one of the important things that we must
[37:01] master
[37:03] now remember this and especially the
[37:06] young you young preachers and lay
[37:09] members alike
[37:11] there's one thing
[37:14] that we've got to master
[37:17] if we expect to fulfill God's desire in
[37:21] our life
[37:22] if you want to fulfill Gods is there in
[37:25] our life we must fulfill this that is
[37:28] you have to master the thought of
[37:31] human ability
[37:33] if we ever get to a spot
[37:37] where we think that we can do it with
[37:40] our own intelligence
[37:42] and our own abilities
[37:45] we've got to master that in such a way
[37:48] that we can get rid of the thing and
[37:50] made aside so that God can use us that
[37:55] is right
[37:56] and make a complete surrender
[38:00] we cannot use one ability
[38:03] we've got to make a complete surrender
[38:06] and to come to God you've got to
[38:09] surrender to him both
[38:13] so
[38:15] body and spirits
[38:17] everything that you are has to be
[38:21] surrendered to God
[38:23] in order that he can work his will in
[38:27] you and in me amen so what a scripture
[38:32] is trying to tell us that we have to get
[38:36] ourselves out of the way
[38:38] you have to get to the place
[38:40] that we will surrender to God that we
[38:44] ourselves have no ability to do anything
[38:47] that God was the one that gone out flow
[38:51] through us and do whatever he wants to
[38:53] do and if you check
[38:56] the scriptures that we read
[38:58] in the Old Testament the New Testament
[39:01] anyone
[39:03] that God was ever used was the people
[39:08] who took who was able to take their
[39:12] personal ability away and let God
[39:15] control them they got to a place that
[39:19] they know that they cannot do anything
[39:22] then God
[39:24] come on the scene and use the people so
[39:28] unless the bride of Christ will get to a
[39:30] place and fully surrounded and we can
[39:34] say how much you want but
[39:37] if we have any human elements in
[39:41] anything that representing the people is
[39:43] going to be you doing it and God will
[39:46] not be glorified in it so when you read
[39:48] about Jeremiah
[39:50] it says in Jeremiah chapter 1 that he
[39:53] said that Jeremy because what is
[39:56] happening is that if you look at this
[39:58] place nobody's flesh is perfect
[40:03] iniquity so that flesh is always enemy
[40:08] to God so when you look at the flesh
[40:11] you say you cannot do nothing
[40:13] so I believe that happened to Jeremiah
[40:15] and the rest
[40:16] he God said
[40:19] I'm gonna use to he said I am a child
[40:22] he's looking at his position as a child
[40:24] he can't do anything then God has to
[40:27] bring to his memory and tell him that
[40:29] before
[40:30] you were born
[40:32] I knew you I
[40:35] sanctify you and I
[40:38] made you a prophet because Jeremiah got
[40:41] to a place
[40:42] that he realized he cannot do it
[40:47] so once he recognized that God has to
[40:50] come to the sin and use him because it
[40:53] takes those who think they are nothing
[40:56] and somebody gets into them and they
[40:59] make something good out from them but
[41:02] when you think that you know everything
[41:05] you are all you know nobody even can
[41:07] talk to you then God cannot use you
[41:10] amen so when you talk about Prophet it's
[41:14] not those theologians Prophet we always
[41:17] have true prophets and the false
[41:20] prophets and then they have the school
[41:22] of what prophets in the time of Elijah
[41:25] or in the Bible States they are all over
[41:28] there but a true Prophet is born a
[41:32] prophet he doesn't come here before he
[41:34] become a prophet he was he's born a
[41:37] prophet he's different from the spirit
[41:40] of Prophecy
[41:42] so a prophet is born a prophet and when
[41:46] I say that I remember
[41:48] in about I forgot the year maybe 10 15
[41:51] years ago about 10 years ago a friend of
[41:53] mine
[41:54] at school he was very he's in the UK and
[41:58] it's very
[41:59] um Wordly
[42:01] so one time I was watching something
[42:03] told me to talk to him he's one of God's
[42:06] children so I call him and I began to
[42:08] talk to him through you get connection
[42:09] to the face because at that time all my
[42:12] friends everybody like didn't want to
[42:13] have nothing to do with me because of
[42:16] what I was projecting to them
[42:19] understanding said that I'll give you
[42:21] you got one person and when that thought
[42:24] came I went to Facebook reconnect and
[42:27] it's like hand to the gloves he received
[42:30] everything that I told him then he went
[42:33] to the church got baptized and his life
[42:34] was changed so his uncle in the U.S
[42:39] heard about it talking to him he saw
[42:42] there have been a change in his nephew
[42:46] so he wanted to also know about why he
[42:50] got a change so he told him about me
[42:53] so I said okay U.S is not fair so we're
[42:58] gonna go and visit your uncle in
[43:01] Virginia so I told Brad coffee and you
[43:04] rented a hotel boom you went to Virginia
[43:07] when went there
[43:10] the man wife we didn't know before
[43:14] she was like a pharmacist but her
[43:17] pharmacist that research she goes to
[43:19] China all over the place to make
[43:21] research in pharmaceutical Department
[43:24] and then to cut everything short we
[43:27] began to speak
[43:29] we talk about the word of God
[43:31] and when we finish
[43:34] the lady said that everything we said
[43:37] she believed it Barbara coffee said that
[43:40] our sisters don't wear an earring
[43:43] so she said that part
[43:46] she rejected it is false
[43:50] and
[43:52] try to show her in the Bible she can't
[43:55] get it so instead forget it you are not
[43:57] here to argue with you we came here to
[44:00] help your husband and we are not even
[44:02] telling him to take it out because it's
[44:05] just a question that came in for you to
[44:06] know what we stand for but anything done
[44:09] without faith or Revelation is sin so
[44:13] don't worry about even if you're
[44:14] supposed to come to our church we're not
[44:16] telling you that don't come with it come
[44:18] the way you are let God deal with your
[44:21] heart and God will change you
[44:23] so we spoke like that fashion you forget
[44:26] about it and then around 12 o'clock
[44:29] she prepared coffee and tea for us to
[44:31] drink so like me and coffee sitting like
[44:35] somewhere like here and she was sitting
[44:37] like a place like this
[44:38] whilst we are enjoying our coffee and
[44:41] our tea all that we had she began to
[44:43] scream
[44:45] Queen
[44:49] took that thing off
[44:50] she said now I'm free
[44:54] because I said that there was a pain or
[44:56] I never seen that in my life
[44:58] and then
[45:00] why I'm saying this is that
[45:03] we went back to a hotel we came back the
[45:05] following day and the lady research
[45:07] spent the whole night
[45:09] to read about brother William Aaron
[45:12] Brown and then she testify of her own
[45:15] mouth that
[45:17] brother the prophet is not just ordinary
[45:20] Prophet we're talking about in the world
[45:22] he came with his gift he was born a
[45:26] prophet William was born a true genuine
[45:31] Prophet from the lips of The Sinner
[45:34] was the church people the clergy are
[45:37] denying the prophet I denying the
[45:39] message here we are with a wealthy
[45:42] person haven't heard about it in his
[45:44] life in their lifetime but one night we
[45:47] just experienced that she witnessed she
[45:50] researched and she called it that he was
[45:54] born a prophet
[45:55] so before we have false prophets they
[46:00] have to be a genuine prophet and we are
[46:04] privileged
[46:05] that God that is Grace has let us
[46:08] recognize the prophet for our age
[46:11] because so many people don't have a clue
[46:14] what is going on they try to go by their
[46:16] own intellect they try to interpret
[46:19] their bubble themselves which God has
[46:20] given them the authority to interpret
[46:23] and they are killing their people with
[46:25] their false Doctrine but here we are by
[46:28] the grace of God has led us to the true
[46:32] word for our day and we have the grace
[46:35] elsewhere to live it to believe that
[46:37] word and what's what to live it for
[46:40] present day of his ministry so we are
[46:43] blessed and we are privileged so we
[46:46] shouldn't take it for what granted amen
[46:49] so back to
[46:51] my main topic
[46:53] when God
[46:56] called His prophets call those people
[47:00] if like someone like Moses because I'm
[47:03] talking about the weaknesses of the
[47:05] those people
[47:07] Jeremiah
[47:09] was complaining about
[47:12] being a child
[47:15] when they talk about Moses
[47:17] he was the most uh what do I say the
[47:21] intellectual the highest person in his
[47:24] day even though he was born a prophet
[47:27] but he was in Pharaoh's
[47:31] um
[47:32] he was in pharaohs
[47:34] Pharaoh's home so he was brought up to
[47:38] be the next Pharaoh like the next U.S
[47:40] president over here so to be trained to
[47:42] that they grew me with wedding
[47:44] intellectual so he was full of intellect
[47:48] could train the Egyptians and to
[47:50] everything and
[47:53] Moses thought that
[47:55] with all his military experience
[47:57] he can do the work
[48:00] and when he tried to do it by himself he
[48:04] Faith miserably
[48:07] that shows you and me that not by power
[48:10] or by might but by my spirit says the
[48:14] Lord
[48:15] Moses couldn't achieve anything with all
[48:17] his military his military
[48:20] intelligence and
[48:23] God got rid of everything that Moses
[48:26] have learned when he went to Jethro's
[48:28] place
[48:30] and I believe that God really deal with
[48:33] his prophet
[48:35] he became so down to earth
[48:38] that even after he met God in the form
[48:43] of the pillar of fire he still started
[48:45] talking about his weaknesses instead of
[48:48] complained to God oh he said
[48:52] I I don't have any message to give to
[48:54] them
[48:56] that's the written a richness about
[48:59] seven of them
[49:01] I like Authority
[49:04] I cannot speak eloquently
[49:07] eloquence
[49:09] I cannot be adapted I won't be
[49:12] successful I will not be accepted
[49:14] oh how does what excuses
[49:18] because God has got rid of all his human
[49:21] part all his ability out he has taken
[49:25] everything from him so with his flesh
[49:28] here and he his men might be thinking
[49:31] that even when I have all that military
[49:33] I couldn't do nothing what can I do now
[49:36] I can't do nothing Lord and he began to
[49:39] give excuse by God was angry with him
[49:44] if you read I think that's not 4 14 God
[49:47] was angry with Moses
[49:49] for complaining everything he said who
[49:52] made your mouth
[49:53] who made you this I am sending you
[49:57] I am going to make you a God and here
[49:59] I'm Gonna Be Your Prophet I'll put my
[50:01] rest in your mouth I will talk through
[50:04] you amen and then his confidence that
[50:07] will become towards come back because
[50:09] like in Amnesia God has what say all
[50:12] those things to let him walk
[50:14] and wake up
[50:17] and God used him mightily why because
[50:21] God was yours prisoner the word of God
[50:24] he surrendered his soul his mind
[50:27] everything
[50:28] for the word of God
[50:30] so when Moses is speaking it wasn't
[50:33] Moses anymore it was God in Moses that's
[50:37] why it wasn't Moses who did all the
[50:39] Miracles it was God that did the
[50:41] Miracles it was no brother Abraham that
[50:44] was doing all those things telling you
[50:46] come from me I did this and it was God
[50:49] in the prophet and that same God is here
[50:52] tonight if you are willing to surrender
[50:54] your heart to your soul body mind to
[50:57] this living God he's gonna use you
[50:59] mightily that you even what I wonder you
[51:03] will still have to astonish you what God
[51:06] can do through you when you get to that
[51:08] place that you realize that you truly
[51:11] not just by mouth that you don't have
[51:13] ability to do anything anymore but God
[51:17] come
[51:18] and live your life through me genuinely
[51:21] from your heart
[51:22] you see the power of God in your life
[51:26] that same God is here
[51:28] amen
[51:29] so Moses
[51:31] God used him mightily
[51:33] and then when we come to
[51:37] another
[51:38] um
[51:39] person that we read about Paul another
[51:41] intellectual person
[51:43] he was also used of God
[51:46] but before God who used Paul he has to
[51:49] knock away everything he learned from
[51:51] gamelia he knocked him out from his High
[51:54] house
[51:55] and with all the gift that Paul's had
[51:58] when he said that in the perfect
[52:01] weakness when he had infirmity on him
[52:06] he saw God three times
[52:09] take this thing from me and God will not
[52:12] take it from him
[52:13] he said that my grace is sufficient he
[52:17] said that Lord let me what our Glory my
[52:20] infirmities because God used that the
[52:24] world abandons of Grace to let him work
[52:26] calm down so what I'm saying tonight
[52:30] if you have some issues something that
[52:33] you're dealing with and you prayed
[52:35] and you're not getting an answer or God
[52:37] is telling wait you got to have patience
[52:39] at the right time he will come to the
[52:42] scene and do it don't force God you
[52:46] can't false God's hands shall not the
[52:48] just of the FG right everything that
[52:51] comes to your way has a purpose
[52:53] sometimes because we are in this place
[52:55] we see through US exactly but when you
[52:58] go over there we see it more word
[53:00] clearly so whatever goes in your life
[53:04] you have to Just Surrender it to God he
[53:08] will take care of it
[53:10] and God and Paul got to a place
[53:14] that
[53:16] God knock away everything from him and
[53:20] when it got that place of that
[53:22] weaknesses the people around him
[53:25] Demas Demas and all the rest forsake
[53:28] forsook Him
[53:29] just like bro Abraham come to the end of
[53:31] his ministry they were all forsaking him
[53:34] but that's when God was crowning his
[53:36] ministry amen so when they are forsaken
[53:40] you don't worry if you know you are in
[53:42] line with God's word if you know in your
[53:44] heart you are doing the right thing
[53:46] don't worry about the people forsaking
[53:48] you don't worry about what people are
[53:50] saying you just keep on doing it maybe
[53:52] it's your crowning time and power was so
[53:56] much with God
[53:57] he didn't care about anything even in
[54:01] prison
[54:02] went
[54:03] he was being beaten and were changed and
[54:06] everything
[54:08] he said death where is your stink great
[54:11] where is your Victory he wasn't scared
[54:14] of they wasn't scared of anything that's
[54:16] when God used him mightily because God
[54:18] once surrounded vessel tonight you want
[54:21] people who would take their self out
[54:24] will take away all the abilities that
[54:27] they have and let God have his way in
[54:30] their life and he's gonna flow through
[54:33] you he's gonna do a mighty work through
[54:35] you if you can get to that place deep in
[54:38] your heart
[54:40] not just talking about it
[54:42] and get yourself out of the way God will
[54:45] do Mighty rest through you he causes the
[54:48] same yesterday
[54:49] and forever
[54:52] and Paul who said I had not come to you
[54:54] with what enticing words or what God's
[54:58] wisdom of men because he has the highest
[55:00] form of Education
[55:02] but he took all that as I come to you in
[55:05] the power and demonstration of those who
[55:07] so that you can see Christ
[55:09] to praise Christ he didn't come to
[55:11] preach himself
[55:13] he didn't depend on his education he
[55:16] didn't depends on his knowledge he
[55:18] depends on the revelation of the word of
[55:21] God Amen praise God another person
[55:25] that also God dealt with him was Isaiah
[55:30] Isaiah
[55:31] was looking up to what uziah
[55:35] the way uziah was brought up a king from
[55:39] eight years
[55:40] and he was a perfect King
[55:42] God doesn't want us to have anybody as
[55:46] our Idol
[55:48] if you put anybody in place of you
[55:52] no matter how holy you see that person
[55:54] is no matter how you see how God is
[55:57] using that person God shared not his
[56:00] glory with anybody
[56:01] so when Isaiah began to look to uziah
[56:05] God has to take uziah from the sin
[56:08] and I believe that he shook Isaiah to
[56:11] his bones
[56:12] so he has to go to his knees and cry to
[56:16] God for himself
[56:18] he has to seek God
[56:20] with desperation
[56:22] and when you see God with Desperate
[56:24] Heart
[56:25] he will answer
[56:27] and when he saw god with that
[56:29] desperation
[56:32] he saw seraphims and angels
[56:35] and I believe that Isaiah was so beaten
[56:38] down with his own abilities
[56:40] that when the Angels come said that I'm
[56:43] a man of unclean lips I live among
[56:47] unclean people he didn't glorify
[56:49] anything of the flesh
[56:51] he got to that place that he realized he
[56:54] cannot do nothing he's unclean mother
[56:56] prophet in the presence of the Angels
[57:00] he said I'm an unclean person I live
[57:02] among the cliff people then that angel
[57:05] put a call of fire on his mouth and
[57:07] touched him and then he became clean as
[57:09] clean can be then he was ready for the
[57:11] work amen because at that time all his
[57:15] intellect all everything that as I was
[57:18] not looking at anybody anymore it was
[57:20] Christ Alone it was Jesus alone that he
[57:24] was glorified so the glory blessed was
[57:26] going to God again it wasn't more there
[57:29] was no shifting in his priority there
[57:32] was no shifting to uzal to anybody he
[57:35] was looking straight to Jesus Look Away
[57:38] to Jesus he alone can help you he alone
[57:41] can take your burden nobody on this head
[57:45] can help in one of us only Jesus when
[57:49] you get to a place sometimes all hopes
[57:51] is gone
[57:54] only Jesus can help you don't look at
[57:58] the personalities how big they are how
[58:00] they are it doesn't mean nothing
[58:03] that's God told our pastor gave us an
[58:05] example that one day he was worried and
[58:08] the voice told him who is your boss is
[58:10] that the boss here or I'm your boss he
[58:13] God is your boss he's over robbers he
[58:16] can turn directly bus around and change
[58:19] every situation so don't look to anybody
[58:22] don't look at how Mighty they are don't
[58:24] look at how rich they are not look at
[58:26] everybody look to Jesus respect them
[58:29] give them their their thing that they
[58:31] deserve it your eyes is on Christ
[58:33] because we can't depend on anybody that
[58:37] man here your your time is just a flower
[58:40] it just feels like nothing you just hear
[58:43] like a floor you go you are here today
[58:45] you go tomorrow so our eyes
[58:49] should be on Jesus alone and if you let
[58:52] anything become my idol God will take it
[58:56] away from you
[58:58] if you depend on that's what
[59:00] even when God
[59:03] bless Abraham with Isaac
[59:06] I think maybe Abraham became attached to
[59:08] Isaac and the very thing that he prayed
[59:11] for God told him to deliver to it but
[59:14] because Abraham wasn't looking at
[59:17] looking at the promise and have
[59:19] confidence that God that gave him the
[59:22] Isaac can also raise the map he didn't
[59:25] become a problem for him because where
[59:28] the problem is some people when God
[59:32] blessed them with money or bless them
[59:33] with anything they become attached to
[59:36] the person then they forget about the
[59:38] God who gave it to them
[59:40] so God doesn't want us to become
[59:42] attached to anything
[59:44] if you are his son or daughter
[59:46] if you let your job
[59:49] or anything comes between God
[59:52] will take that thing away from you
[59:55] because he has to begin the priority
[59:59] sacrifice the kingdom of God and his
[1:00:02] righteousness all other things shall be
[1:00:05] added unto it
[1:00:06] when you say pay your thighs you pay it
[1:00:09] don't look at your conditions don't
[1:00:12] trust oh man my branches this my this is
[1:00:16] this how am I gonna make it
[1:00:18] just have confidence in God because for
[1:00:22] example my words shall not come out void
[1:00:24] unless I accomplish what it was sent for
[1:00:27] he said that bring this side to my house
[1:00:29] and see test me
[1:00:32] I will open Windows of heaven and I will
[1:00:35] bless you if God has spoken and not be
[1:00:39] saying it God spoke it and he will take
[1:00:42] care of you
[1:00:43] it doesn't matter how
[1:00:46] how sometimes you look dark
[1:00:49] he will make a way
[1:00:51] where it seems to be no way so let's
[1:00:53] stress God
[1:00:55] if you love God your best Commandments
[1:00:58] you do whatever he tells you no matter
[1:01:01] how impossible is steam in your eyes
[1:01:05] do what God is asking you to do
[1:01:09] amen praise God
[1:01:12] Hallelujah so what am I saying back to
[1:01:15] Isaiah when the call of fire when the
[1:01:19] Lord touches math then he said that who
[1:01:22] will go for me who will I send he said
[1:01:25] here my Lord send me just like the woman
[1:01:29] in the world when the Lord revealed
[1:01:32] himself to her citizens keep it to
[1:01:35] yourself
[1:01:36] she told others Christianity used to
[1:01:39] live for others Christian is to do
[1:01:42] things for others amen and like Philip
[1:01:45] he told Nathaniel about what he said he
[1:01:49] said brother Philip he said cleaning
[1:01:51] time I know it's a cleaning time but we
[1:01:53] still have to witness because you don't
[1:01:56] know when the last one is coming who
[1:01:59] that last one is we have to do our job
[1:02:01] no I preached for 120 years he did not
[1:02:05] get anybody but he still preached anyway
[1:02:07] amen so we have to do our part and
[1:02:10] witness and just do whatever we can
[1:02:13] because millions in sin and shame are
[1:02:15] dying people are dying left and right
[1:02:18] without God
[1:02:20] you see the life of the people sometimes
[1:02:22] you cry in your heart
[1:02:26] some are deceived by false doctrines you
[1:02:30] talk to them you cry for them and
[1:02:33] they've been so blinded
[1:02:34] and they can't see their way out
[1:02:37] by the grace of God
[1:02:39] let's live the life let's share the
[1:02:41] light the word
[1:02:43] let's God have remnants
[1:02:46] in his own time he will do it once we
[1:02:51] are not dependent on our own abilities
[1:02:56] he will take care of the business
[1:02:59] amen
[1:03:01] Hallelujah and one other individual that
[1:03:04] will talk to his Gideon
[1:03:07] Gideon
[1:03:09] also
[1:03:11] God told him you are a Mighty Man Of
[1:03:13] Violence he said me
[1:03:16] have the least among my my brethren I'm
[1:03:21] poor
[1:03:22] how do I became a mighty man of Valor
[1:03:24] Valor whatever it is
[1:03:28] God was trying to let him know who he is
[1:03:33] he's a son of the Living God
[1:03:37] was not looking at his Earthly condition
[1:03:41] that's why the word of God is coming
[1:03:44] forth every day to remind us who we are
[1:03:49] who I am I am a part of what my savior
[1:03:53] I'm a part of his word amen he's always
[1:03:57] constantly
[1:03:59] letting us to know who we are amen
[1:04:03] I'm a I'm who I am
[1:04:06] who am I I can see now
[1:04:10] who I am
[1:04:11] I a part of my savior a part of his word
[1:04:15] it's a revelation
[1:04:18] amen
[1:04:20] or glorious victory that day he set me
[1:04:24] free he made my heart his very Throne my
[1:04:29] life is no longer what mine just like
[1:04:33] Paul and
[1:04:35] Paul and Moses were prisoner of Christ
[1:04:39] so the true bride of Christ we are
[1:04:42] prisoner the word of God realize life is
[1:04:44] no longer always amen we are prisoner of
[1:04:48] love divine and now we lived what to
[1:04:52] praise our God Amen on Calvary he died
[1:04:56] to redeem his last bride
[1:04:59] we are lost and on time
[1:05:01] The God Who created the whole universe
[1:05:04] the mighty of the Mighty the almighty
[1:05:07] God he left his son above and became
[1:05:10] like one of his so if you want to be
[1:05:13] high you have to humble yourself
[1:05:16] he came left all his glory above
[1:05:19] to come to this thinking here
[1:05:23] to be to the redeemers so the highest of
[1:05:26] all became the lowest of all and the
[1:05:29] true servant of God you are the servant
[1:05:32] of the people
[1:05:34] God came to service
[1:05:37] so the way up is the way down is that
[1:05:41] result himself will be brought down who
[1:05:44] humble himself and raise them up so no
[1:05:48] don't don't be proud
[1:05:52] just be simple and love the people
[1:05:57] don't look down for anyone like John
[1:05:59] Wesley said he saw that bomb
[1:06:02] here was I by the grace of God
[1:06:06] and I recently some people that I know
[1:06:10] before maybe 10 12 years
[1:06:12] when I told them I used to drink I used
[1:06:15] to smoke they said one was no feeling if
[1:06:19] you have not told me
[1:06:21] how not I believe it why by the grace of
[1:06:25] God I will have still be in that
[1:06:28] thinking life I would have been in that
[1:06:30] stupid life I would have been move
[1:06:34] around with no hope
[1:06:36] but God grace came to me and he has
[1:06:39] changed me from the inside out that the
[1:06:42] people cannot even see a Trace of a
[1:06:45] drunkard that my dust after having to
[1:06:46] step on me when I got drunk from my
[1:06:49] friends like they carry me like that by
[1:06:51] the grace of God
[1:06:53] has brought me that's far
[1:06:56] and people cannot even see a trace of
[1:06:58] that
[1:06:59] it's my ability no
[1:07:01] is God that has done it so we have to
[1:07:05] give him praise and ties and don't look
[1:07:07] down upon anybody let's have compassion
[1:07:10] for the people
[1:07:11] the Lord Jesus Christ look upon them he
[1:07:14] has compassion on them
[1:07:16] and like Abraham he intercedes for lot
[1:07:21] knowing that even Lord has done wrong as
[1:07:24] wrong can be his thing tested for them
[1:07:27] let's Interstate for our family
[1:07:29] interested for our children intercede
[1:07:31] for our family our friends no matter
[1:07:34] what they have done
[1:07:36] let God's love project When Love
[1:07:39] projects Grace takes over
[1:07:43] bless intestine let's love the people
[1:07:45] amen
[1:07:47] what am I saying
[1:07:50] God
[1:07:52] let Gideon
[1:07:54] know who he was that is not just an
[1:07:59] ordinary person
[1:08:02] his eternal being trapped in on this
[1:08:06] Earth
[1:08:07] so what is this that he is going back to
[1:08:10] what
[1:08:11] eternal life whatever he said Eternal
[1:08:13] being trapped on this flesh is that
[1:08:16] right so
[1:08:17] um the rest is not coming I know what
[1:08:19] I'm trying to say so um
[1:08:22] he's it is eternal being that has been
[1:08:26] trapped on what on this flesh for a
[1:08:29] season
[1:08:30] so he has to let him wake up
[1:08:33] and give all those words of
[1:08:35] encouragement
[1:08:37] that's why God always speaking to us the
[1:08:40] word coming false from the tape from the
[1:08:43] preaching everywhere for us to recognize
[1:08:45] exactly who you are when you fully
[1:08:49] recognize who you are it changes your
[1:08:52] Dynamics it changes everything about you
[1:08:55] oh perhaps someone is talking about
[1:08:57] Queen George when he was going to war he
[1:09:00] was trying to turn back and that one of
[1:09:02] his generals said that remember who you
[1:09:05] are you are King George and then he
[1:09:08] remembered that he came back and fought
[1:09:10] and got that Victory so we have to
[1:09:13] remember who you are you are a son of
[1:09:16] God you are not ordinary person you have
[1:09:19] God's DNA in you you have the spirit of
[1:09:22] Christ in you amen so don't look down
[1:09:26] upon yourself
[1:09:27] remember he's in you he has to remind
[1:09:30] them no wonder Abraham said when
[1:09:33] that true bride of fry recognize who she
[1:09:36] is fully she'll be an invisible Army
[1:09:40] amen
[1:09:42] is going on now
[1:09:45] there is no another age
[1:09:47] this is the time there is no future by
[1:09:51] the coming of Christ
[1:09:52] you are the last generation there is not
[1:09:55] going to be any Generation all the
[1:09:58] prophecy has been fulfilled and is
[1:10:00] fulfilling in our eyes we used to say
[1:10:02] this is coming that is coming that is
[1:10:05] coming but now can say this is yeah that
[1:10:07] is yeah this is yeah amen so God is
[1:10:10] united with his bride that's why Daniel
[1:10:12] saying it's uniting time as the devil is
[1:10:16] united with his churches with World
[1:10:17] Council of churches God is what's United
[1:10:20] with his with his bride full unification
[1:10:23] amen he's the same yesterday to them
[1:10:26] forever he will never lose none of his
[1:10:29] children said I have done me the palm of
[1:10:32] my hand no one can plug them out from my
[1:10:35] head amen no one comes the father except
[1:10:37] the father calls him first you are Son
[1:10:40] of God you are a daughter of the Living
[1:10:42] God the spirit of God dwelleth inside of
[1:10:45] you amen
[1:10:48] John looked out for yourself just like
[1:10:51] the black slave even though he was a
[1:10:54] slaving you I said say remember who is
[1:10:56] yours he's the son of the king
[1:10:59] remember that
[1:11:01] you are a son of the king not a king
[1:11:05] the King Jesus amen
[1:11:08] so walk like that to your chest up
[1:11:12] no matter what you're going through you
[1:11:14] have to walk with your Chester because
[1:11:16] God is in control
[1:11:18] amen he will never leave you nor forsake
[1:11:21] you
[1:11:22] amen praise our God
[1:11:25] thank you Jesus amen
[1:11:28] Hallelujah
[1:11:30] praise our wonderful God Amen
[1:11:34] Hallelujah
[1:11:35] what am I saying
[1:11:37] so when
[1:11:39] God is saying that he has his word in
[1:11:41] your mouth
[1:11:43] if God have that word in your mouth what
[1:11:45] do you have to do when you are met with
[1:11:48] the situation
[1:11:49] and you are in the will of God you got
[1:11:52] to speak and go for it
[1:11:55] listen I was pleased with one brother
[1:11:57] and you are talking about it he said
[1:11:59] that you said what step up serpents they
[1:12:02] will not harm you they will not do this
[1:12:04] if that means that you're gonna be
[1:12:05] foolishly go and step on steppers or
[1:12:07] doing that then when you are in the post
[1:12:09] of Duty
[1:12:11] you are in line of duty and that thing
[1:12:14] happened God Will Take Care of Business
[1:12:17] amen so
[1:12:19] Moses
[1:12:21] being a prophet of God
[1:12:25] did so much through him
[1:12:29] but when he gets a place
[1:12:32] he himself said
[1:12:34] I was bothering him they said that it's
[1:12:37] better we go back we told you why do you
[1:12:40] bring us here to destroy us and His
[1:12:43] prophets I said this Egyptian you see
[1:12:46] you will see them no more
[1:12:49] then he began to cry
[1:12:52] Lord what should I do and God said why
[1:12:56] cry to me Moses
[1:12:58] speak and go forward
[1:13:00] and then when you speak the 10 words
[1:13:04] divided into two and they walk through
[1:13:06] and that I don't understand them
[1:13:10] but they blinded anyway
[1:13:14] how can this divided and the people are
[1:13:16] working and you guys you should have ran
[1:13:18] for your life and they were being so
[1:13:20] foolish that were still following them
[1:13:24] but I believe it has to let God's
[1:13:26] glories be shown and all those listen
[1:13:29] the word perish in that why because
[1:13:32] Moses spoke
[1:13:33] in the line of duty
[1:13:35] and Joshua I believe that he was the
[1:13:38] left hand of of Moses
[1:13:41] the right-hand man of Moses
[1:13:43] they had
[1:13:45] he saw everything that happened
[1:13:48] and Joshua types the Holy Ghost
[1:13:51] so in the time of Joshua
[1:13:54] when Joshua made the same situation
[1:13:57] Joshua didn't cried
[1:13:59] he recognized that
[1:14:02] God has given me promise
[1:14:04] and God have told him as I was with
[1:14:08] bosses
[1:14:09] so I will be with you
[1:14:11] so he know that God of Moses was in
[1:14:15] charge of his life
[1:14:17] so when he needed a son
[1:14:20] he's in Christ oh God I didn't
[1:14:21] understand he said his son stands too I
[1:14:24] haven't I haven't I have a work to do
[1:14:27] wait till I'm done finish then you can
[1:14:29] come back then you can go and the sun
[1:14:31] was the son obey him
[1:14:35] that same God is here tonight
[1:14:38] if you face with any situation
[1:14:40] if you are in a line of duty and if you
[1:14:44] are in the world of God and the enemy
[1:14:47] comes
[1:14:48] just speak and go fast
[1:14:50] your God will come true
[1:14:52] and deliver you and make a way for you
[1:14:55] he hasn't changed he's the same
[1:14:58] yesterday to death forever amen I
[1:15:01] believe that Peter the red they all have
[1:15:03] that Revelation on the gate of beautiful
[1:15:06] gate when you saw that man who was
[1:15:09] crippled Peter didn't praise hey come
[1:15:11] fast
[1:15:13] pick up your thing and walk had a man
[1:15:16] walk in the time of Jesus Lazarus
[1:15:20] said last was come forth
[1:15:23] he came was it I'm saying that it's not
[1:15:26] sometimes like a a black crap or what I
[1:15:30] was gonna use it
[1:15:31] um
[1:15:32] loose law what
[1:15:34] believe your life
[1:15:36] be simple
[1:15:38] and let God
[1:15:40] have his own way
[1:15:42] when a situation arrives and God needs
[1:15:46] you to speak he will speak through you
[1:15:47] because it's not you gonna speak
[1:15:51] remember Abram is the Angel God that
[1:15:54] spoke to him ask him how many square as
[1:15:57] you want
[1:15:58] and he spoke through and he got the
[1:16:00] exact word he wants in the sahity right
[1:16:03] house the angel asked him ask her
[1:16:07] what does she desire
[1:16:10] and he said the salvation of my children
[1:16:13] I gave it to you so it's all about him
[1:16:16] it's not about us he operates at the
[1:16:21] right time when we need it
[1:16:25] so we don't have to
[1:16:28] copycat or do anything is that is that
[1:16:31] impersonators like a son of Stephen he
[1:16:34] said that I joining the name of Jesus
[1:16:37] Christ that demon come to himself Jesus
[1:16:39] I know Paul I know who are you and
[1:16:42] there's a cow give me my give me my
[1:16:44] clothes and just rip him naked why
[1:16:46] because he was impersonating
[1:16:49] but when
[1:16:51] you are working in God there's one thing
[1:16:53] I'm just going to conclude very soon
[1:16:55] that it has never left me
[1:16:59] one time I was outside there with
[1:17:01] brother Simon Mr Johnson
[1:17:03] was saying that
[1:17:06] he wants to go to
[1:17:08] um
[1:17:09] Grenada or brother Tim
[1:17:11] but she doesn't have the money to go
[1:17:15] and Pastor told her in my presence Mr
[1:17:17] Johnson
[1:17:19] first of all
[1:17:22] find out if it is the will of God
[1:17:26] for you to go with a brother
[1:17:28] if God
[1:17:30] wants you to go he will make a way for
[1:17:34] you to be there
[1:17:36] and truly because God wants her to go
[1:17:39] God made a way for her and I was
[1:17:42] speaking to batim recently and she said
[1:17:44] a lot happened on that trip through our
[1:17:47] sister because she was in the world of
[1:17:51] God
[1:17:52] so when you are in the will of God he
[1:17:56] take care of business
[1:17:58] so don't go ahead of yourself
[1:18:02] first find out it is God's will for you
[1:18:06] to go that's why I brought me said
[1:18:08] before he goes to Africa he said that
[1:18:10] demon or evil spiritual Iran but he
[1:18:13] first find out if God wants him to be
[1:18:17] there and if God revealed to him that he
[1:18:20] has to go he doesn't care once you get
[1:18:22] there he says I take this country under
[1:18:24] my control in the name of Jesus and all
[1:18:27] demons have to flee because he is in the
[1:18:29] will of God so when you are in the will
[1:18:32] of God nothing can stop you amen so find
[1:18:35] out
[1:18:36] and the will of God is in his word
[1:18:40] recently I've just found out some people
[1:18:42] they base too much on prophecies based
[1:18:46] too much on this on that on that and God
[1:18:48] speaking voice and that but it doesn't
[1:18:51] matter what voice you hear it doesn't
[1:18:53] matter what problem it doesn't matter
[1:18:54] what he has to come back and line up
[1:18:57] with this word if it doesn't line up for
[1:18:59] this get away from it don't feed on that
[1:19:03] feed on the word of God check it back
[1:19:06] your Revelation it has to line up for
[1:19:08] this this is an absolute
[1:19:11] it doesn't matter how
[1:19:14] um how hundred percent the things look
[1:19:17] like it has to come back to this word of
[1:19:20] the Living God
[1:19:22] amen that's the problems some people
[1:19:24] have
[1:19:25] Hallelujah
[1:19:27] I'm just gonna wrap it up
[1:19:30] with this here
[1:19:34] um
[1:19:35] great just a little portion of that
[1:19:38] thing that I give to you
[1:19:40] I think it's in paragraph 287 of
[1:19:45] this said that now
[1:19:48] if you say it
[1:19:51] just presumptuously because the Bible
[1:19:54] said that if you say to this mountain
[1:19:57] be thou removed and do not doubt in your
[1:20:00] heart but believe that what you have
[1:20:03] said will come to pass you shall have
[1:20:06] what you say but the problem is saying
[1:20:08] that now if you say it just
[1:20:11] presumptuously
[1:20:13] it won't happen
[1:20:16] but if something in you
[1:20:20] that's your anointed
[1:20:22] for the job
[1:20:25] and
[1:20:26] will know that is the will of God to do
[1:20:29] it
[1:20:30] and will say it is God to happen so we
[1:20:36] don't say all those things
[1:20:37] presumptuously
[1:20:39] accumulated but if it's the will of God
[1:20:43] it's what come to pass amen amen so I
[1:20:49] think that's what I have for tonight
[1:20:52] and the the musicians can come forth
[1:20:58] amen
[1:21:00] Hallelujah that same God is here
[1:21:03] on Calvary he died for you and me
[1:21:06] amen praise God
[1:21:08] so I just wanted to live tonight with
[1:21:11] one thing if nothing's been gets into
[1:21:13] your heart let don't do anything with
[1:21:16] your own abilities let God
[1:21:19] flow through you
[1:21:21] let God's perfect will be done in your
[1:21:24] life amen
[1:21:29] please
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:22:08] all glorious things
[1:22:11] [Music]
