grace my friend because the age is not about smarts amen has gone far beyond that praise god [Music] a couple weeks ago we got the news that my mom's tumors have spread to different parts of her body and the news took us very hard i mean i'm human after all she's my mother she's my father she's my friend she's she means so much to me she's really special and as i was crushed and that wave of sadness came over me [Music] there was a little fountain inside of me bubbling under all of that i had a desire to praise the lord and this is my testimony so i'm here with a song that's been placed on my heart for his beloved that is you and i don't know what what the purpose of it is god knows because he gave it to me and it certainly has a purpose you're the reason i'm part of that reason i am

lord and uh we also welcome those that are on the internet watching and listening to this digital broadcast may the holy spirit take the word of god and bless them and apply it to their hearts amen may god watch over all our older folk or that are shut in and these days they are not able to go out maybe the lord straighten them comfort them and be with them at a time like this and if you have an opportunity and you do remember them just give them a brief call it will be very helpful and very very encouraging for them we give the lord glory praise and honor now last week we gave out some of these beautiful pins of the cloud praise the lord if you haven't received yours just ask one of the deacons and you will be able to receive one of them praise the lord amen god is good isn't he god is good now as you know we gave out the directive for the believers that are in toronto and uh you know the area out back there uh not to come in um and they can watch it online and we can get the word out that way and just for you who are in the immediate area so we want to thank the lord that he has kept us so far covered by the blood of jesus christ and protected by his word today we have a thought we'd like to share with you and follow up and that is found in genesis chapter 25 verses 21 and 24. the reason why i don't want to read that long scripture just let's read the two verses and we'll begin from there genesis chapter 25 praise the lord verse 21 and isaac entreated the lord for his wife because she was barren and the lord was untreated of him and rebecca's wife conceived verse 24 and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold they were twins in her womb praise the lord let us pray our gracious heavenly father we thank you for the reading of the word and now we ask that the great old time holy spirit oh god come and anoint the word of god and give forth your light and truth and send out o lord jesus this blessing of the word upon your people lord breaking chains of the mind and of the heart and setting your people free that we might rise up on wings of eagles to serve you in the freedom and the glorious liberty of the sons and daughters of god to thee be all the praise honor and glory in jesus name amen and amen praise the lord god bless you amen you may say brother simon why are you so excited i'm excited for what i see in the word and we should all be excited about what we see in the world because the highlight of our lives is this gathering together amen i said the highlight of our lives is this gathering together in the presence of the lord in christ and under the great anointing of the holy spirit of the living god around the present revealed truth of the word that he has given to us we are blessed of god and we are honored by the holy spirit yet we are invited into his presence glory to god so here we are today and god taking us from the depths of his mind and bringing us into the shallows of mortal life that we might express him that others may see and know him that he is alive forevermore praise god and so our purpose on this earth being here is that we are eternal beings from his presence that are trapped in a body that only has a time frame in that brief period of time we are here to express him we are here to express eternal life we are here to express to them what endless life is all about and this is just a small portion of it that we are allowed to live whether 21 50 70 80 90 whatever we are only allowed to express it in such a portion of life that he has given to us but whatever the time he has apportioned to us we are thankful to god that we were chosen in him before the foundations of the world to be here in this season in this time to make his name known we have a mission we have a name amen and we have a word to declare and we give him all the glory and praise praise god the only way friends that you can express that life that is in you is first of all you got to hear it because faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god not just hearing anything but hearing the true word of god amen you got to hear it and then you got to believe it praise the lord hallelujah but how you're going to believe it everybody says they believe it everybody thinks they believe it and there's many churches out there even believers in this message i believe it i believe the message i believe the prophet but they don't recognize that to really and truly believe you can't really truly believe without a revelation for faith itself is a revelation to believe you got to have a revelation so if you didn't have a revelation then it's all right you can say you believe but that your so-called belief has no foundations your so-called belief has nothing to do no thai post that you can tie to and know for sure that that's where you are so that claim to believing whether in the message or out the message is just human presumption it is not definite being certain of god because you have received a revelation from him out of the word and that makes you certain of god that makes you positive because you know it's from this word and god allowed you to see it you didn't study your way into it you weren't persuaded into it nobody can actually like enlighten you on it they can just give you enough to wave that wave sheath in front of your eyes that you can start seeing like images passing and then focus after a while you catch something and you grasp it for your life amen you're never going to let it go because the talents of the great eagle just grabs a hold of it and you're not going to let it go because you're a child of the king and you're born for that purpose for his glory amen hallelujah so we are not here uh claiming anything by just human belief which is nothing but intellectual presumption because uh in your mind you can hear it and but because you know english you can take it in and that's it but there's something on a higher dimension a higher level there's something that god set in this world to grab a hole of the soul and to never let it go and when that deep crawls back to this deep when that word from before the foundations called to this amen it will respond back to it for my sheep here my voice and a stranger they will not follow praise god hallelujah oh praise god my thought and topic for today is the twins of this end time revival twins of this end time revival well you know it's written in the word of god praise god brother branham said it plainly and clearly every revival produces twins if we want to stop and say oh that stopped up to the pentecostal age that produced twins all the other ages produced twins but this message is so wonderful marvelous and a blessing that there can't be impersonators in this there can't be twins in this there can't be anything like that no no no we've got to follow the continuity of the word of god because a principle it was on a guideline was laid down in the bible in the word of god in the book of genesis and we see it from the very beginning from the time of eve hallelujah praise god because you know and we won't go into that topic itself that's another topic but she had twins right from the very beginning and that principle tells us clearly that if there were twins in the beginning which those twins were at type and they were also prophetic for what is to come and we can use the term a prophetic type okay but it tells you that down through every single age of time there was going to be twins one good one evil one of god one of satan amen it's gonna be right like that from the beginning right on down through to the end and now so in this age we have an end time twins in this message and in this end time revival this revival this move of god is not my friends like exempted from having these twins operating in their midst genesis 25 which we just read tells us that rebecca had twins in the womb and the bible is by type by symbol prophecy telling us there is going to be twins in the church there's going to be twins inside of what you claim to be the message and that is it's just there but one thing you must understand both of these twins are striving for one and the same thing both want to get a hold of that birthright whether they're king or they're able they want to have god's attention they want to have his blessing they want that book right whether they're good or whether they're evil but we know only one is going to get it one has a uh an intellectual right to it if anybody should get it as him because he studied more than i right he read more books he listened she listened more tapes that woman really even prays more than i and everything else if anybody's gonna get it they're gonna get it and that's the the way it was let's say set up back in the time of of the law that the eldest one or the one that is born first he automatically would get the word right he would have to get the birthright and the birthright was the blessing of his father with a double portion of the inheritance would be his right for him to receive there but god himself shows that he makes a difference even there praise god so another thought i want to share here uh never mind if this sounds kind of rough to you but just listen every single age has a abort right promise or the promise to abort right deepwood right praise the lord now praise god in other words if you give them one in that first age you gotta keep doing it god doesn't change uh it may be some appearing like in a different way but this is really the same thing right but he'll do it through every single age praise the lord praise god so here we want to look at jacob and esau praise the lord you want to join me in that jacob and esau these twins if you read it in genesis 25 you'll read about them there but here we find out that jacob the elected or type of the elected he valued that but right so much he had a desire and he valued it above everything else in his life no matter what he had to suffer no matter what he had to go through no matter how he had to humble himself no matter what he had to have that work right and he was willing to pay any price to be able to get that book right now when we look at his twin praise god and you know what twins are i don't want him going through that so you take that spiritually and see the two in the church and they look like twins you can't tell the difference if this one's a christian and that one's a christian disclaimer believer that one claims to be a believer but twins so alike that you can't hardly tell the difference but there is a difference because god no two things are made alike by god each one is a masterpiece in its own right by his marvelous and wonderful grace praise the lord hallelujah amen you see but here is esau and he also had a desire to get that work right he had the desire to but he had like a a more casual desire to get that birth right at the time see praise the lord now friends he really first they said he had a casual desire secondly the bible tells us he despised it amen he didn't want that real responsibility on his shoulders uh he and not only that he was ashamed of it he was ashamed of that right that he had to uh take on actor at that particular time praise god hallelujah now we find friends that we can understand his attitude to this work right because it's revealed in his actions to it amen hallelujah praise the lord because as you know he let go of the birthright at a very cheap price the price of a of a plate of stew he let it go for a plate of stew somebody handed him a well uh presented plate of theology and he was willing to eat that up and let the real thing go by because this one looks so appealing to him praise god nothing against the french but let me tell you french italian when they put together a dish you know it's a whole lot of style amen but you can get a sliver of a cake or a sliver a small portion of meat called a steak like that you know it reminds me of what's his name again mr t going into new york with his limousine and his driver and he just stops and goes into a restaurant and he says give me a steak and he's waiting finally the guy comes with a platter covered with a white cloth then the guy takes the thing places it on the table and he whips off the clot like he's going to surprise you when he rips it off mr t goes and looks at he said what's that he said your steak sir he said that ain't no snake for me man he says that is no stick i'm getting out of here i'm gonna go get me some real soul food why because that's take that he he served a little filet mignon that was just like that at this big man is sitting there waiting for a steak he'll give him a little filling in y'all so i don't care about the style i want something that can feed me amen i want something that can be solid in my stomach amen praise god hallelujah amen but you see esau sold out his birthright for style and fashion he stole it out for one little plate or stew like that amen he see he was more concerned of being known that he's a christian he's a real christian man real christian woman he's sold out from getting the real thing my friends because everybody will look at him and say oh he has a good morals he's a good living womp she's a good living woman a good living man the morals are so good and praise god wonderful oh my look at that boy he saw how what a good boy he is takes care of his blind father and he works so hard and he gives money to help in the home help out with the upkeep of the house you see he was really outwardly a good boy a good young man and more than that he loved to do a lot of works in the church where he took care of his father's business he made sure that his father's business was running real good but jacob he was nothing but a trickster you see he he he was a trickster but the difference there is even though he was a trickster that there was a seed of god planted in him before the foundation of the world hallelujah and that made the difference he didn't know and nobody knew what it was that even though he was a trickster he was a con man he was he was lousy he was a mother's boy he was everything but there was something in him a hunger a thirst there was a drive in him that was driving him to get that birth right i have to know that i got it i gotta know for sure praise the name of the lord amen no matter what it was that his chief his chief's desire was to know that he had that birthright praise the lord oh my my my i don't know about you but that's my chief desire i'm thanking god because i know i got it i said i'm praising god because i know i got it you have got to know for yourself i'm not the pastor here going to announce that you got it but you must know that you've got it and you hold on to it and don't sell it out because it's your birthright you have a right to it because it was predestinated to you from before the foundation of the world glory of god hallelujah amen my god regardless of what the true elect has to go through they're not selling it out no matter what even if they have to go through derision mockings laughings scoffing if they have to go through trial tribulation no matter what it is they'll humble themselves and they'll wait because they want to grab a hold and to hold on to that but right whatever the cost hallelujah amen they got to have the promise for their age they've got to have that brought right promise for their age and to keep holding on to god's unchanging hand now if we look at the types in the word of god israel being a type of the natural church you know that israel and the church oh my their type of the natural church and their drive was to get into where canaan's land or the land of promise or the promised land that was their desire to get to that land so when they came out of egypt moses knew that he had twins on his hands he knew that he had those that were real jews and there were jews but only according to the flesh they didn't recognize who he was they didn't recognize what the pillar of fire was all about they have known not his promises his signs and wonders in the mir and miracles in the wilderness and what they meant those signposts where they were pointing they didn't recognize what god was doing and so you had the church natural and you had the elect spiritual all in the midst the bible puts it this way and it came to pass there was a mixed multitude a mixed multitude came out with that moses and i'm saying to you in this day in our day when there was one who who spoke as it was with moses so shall i be with thee one came out and brought a message and again twins came forth in this end-time revival amen both what wanted to come out of denomination both wanted to be led out by the prophet moses out from under the hand of pharaoh both had that desire to get out and to pass through that wilderness and to come to the place where they can apprehend or hold to the promise of god for this hour and for this day but only one to one was predestinated that they would have the birthright and the other would have the desire and would even seek repentance and works with tears and will not be able to receive it so i say to you who may know in your heart that you one that has received it from god that you want to thank him and praise him and glorify him because you're one out of a million that god by his holy spirit has elected you that you would understand and see and know the mystery of the kingdom of god for unto you is given but unto them it's not given to you it's like you know it's natural it's like second nature you see you don't even know how you see what you see you know how but how i know what you don't know you know but you know you don't study to know not that you didn't read or you didn't listen or and you do that but i didn't do that so that i could know or whatever it was just made known to you by the holy spirit the preacher's preaching is coming forth and all of a sudden you caught that you caught that you caught that nobody can give you that only god can give you that only god can lay that in you and that is the thing we ought to give god praise and thanks for and why i say that because it appears like it's so normal but it's normal for a human being to walk and talk amen but try to get an animal to walk and talk you literally got to put them down and use a system to train them and lay out they lay out all the principles that they have to live by walk by and this and that the other but when that holy spirit gets a hold of the true believer amen and they let go and let god have his way he will lead them and guide them every step of the way all they got to do is keep walking keep walking and as you walk the holy spirit will lead you by his mighty hand oh praise god amen so you know what we're under here we're under the same pillar of fire we're under the same light of god it's not shining up above us but it's revealing itself to us through the word of the living god hallelujah amen praise god and i'm telling you friends that when a prophet came in our day and a bride an elected group came out when the entire group came out there were impersonators come out is that right hallelujah and those impersonators didn't just vanish in the wilderness on the first day they stuck with their impersonation for 40 years one whole generation when they get to the river then a great separating time came hallelujah and you know that god knew that some fell along different times along in the wilderness for you know the bible tells us clearly and you can find in first corinthians how the bible tells us and for some that were on that journey he was not well pleased or well it's faith that causes us to please god if it tells you that for with some of them he was not well pleased it means that he's telling you they had no faith or they didn't have the faith that he was looking for amen praise the lord oh my praise god but now it tells you that israel journeyed until they got to a place called kadesh barnia amen praise god and kadesh bornea is where god told them i brought you in the wilderness i deliberately brought you into the wilderness with trials troubles heat hunger thirsts scorpions all kinds of things but i brought you under those conditions to try you i brought you out to prove you amen brother branham proving his word to prove everybody claims to be a christian but god is going to prove his word amen he's going to prove who is his word that has that gene that germ inside of them and so god doing that to he said i brought you out to prove you praise god hallelujah and back then to prove them god gave them natural tests he made them hungry he made them thirsty for water and he said i did that because i wanted to to prove you and see your attitude i wanted to see your reaction what reaction you're going to take when i do these things hallelujah oh my and you know what the bible tells us tells us clearly it it made it so clear that some began to murmur and some began to complain my god just think about god uh putting us in the wilderness and allowing kovit to come amen i tell you it'll bring out certain qualities in you if you're not watching it's going to expose a lot of things from inside of you it's going to reveal a lot of things that you think you got covered up and hidden up it's all going to be expressed praise god because our test is not a natural test for bread and water but we are going through spiritual tests amen uh praise god amen and we are going through the wilderness of this world to be tested by the word and this word brings reproach brings shame brings all kinds of things so you are tested on your stand how you're standing and how you're living for this word and by the word of the living god hallelujah amen god wants this like he said in deuteronomy i'm proving you to see when you really love me when you really want to keep my commandments my word amen i'm going to see if you're a compromiser or you're a real believer because if you're really believing nothing can move you because you're a part of me you're part of the rock and the rock doesn't move everything else moves around it but the rock won't move and you are founded upon that rock lord of god hallelujah you won't even give up one word hallelujah oh my praise god hallelujah but when this covet comes and trials come and tribulation comes some people if you don't watch it they give up because of some persecution others my friends give up because they're afraid of losing fellowship oh i will get the fellowship with the brothers once over here i won't get fellowship with this church over so and so i won't get fellowship with this other one over there listen praise god it's wonderful we have we love fellowship and we ought to have fellowship but the real fellowship each one of us should have is fellowship with him praise god is to have the fellowship with him praise the lord amen yes sir praise god so we won't deny nothing because we are part of that elect and we won't give up one inch hallelujah i said not one inch not one blade of grass this land is our land and it belongs to us this word belongs to us and we're not giving up one inch of it amen praise god joshua caleb going to that promised land you think any giant could come tell them they're going to take one part of it no sir they were going to possess their possessions and hold on to it for the glory of god amen and praise god hallelujah not mother not father amen not sister nor brother it's to put them out or they're going to give up that birthright for anything else amen praise god because the real true bride of christ holds that birthright higher than her own life she holds it higher than anything else in her evaluation that's the way she puts it god above everything else seek force the kingdom above everything else and all other things will be added unto me praise god hallelujah amen praise god glory to his wonderful name now uh going back to the fact that every age has a promise luther's age had a birthright promise anyone that did not catch the revelation that the just shall live by faith by revelation amen not by a litany not by a canned service put together in a book that can be done year after year after year nothing of that sort but that just shall live by revelation that is what rotten luther was really saying right we know how it's written there but that's what he actually was saying that the just shall live by revelation because that's what was happening he he was reading the word one day and all of a sudden it was revealed to him that that's the way god wants to deal with his people praise the lord and so that was the right promise and every believer that came and claimed that they really would receive his message had to get the same revelation he had he might have told them and they could repeat it with their mouth but they had to have it in it experientially they had to have it as an experience by god revealing to them i don't want you to have these grandiose ideas that you're going to be in your room and then all of a sudden you hear a voice and it tells you my son my word is this and no it's nothing like that it's just you and you by with god maybe you're reading your bible one day or you're listening to preacher or you're talking to a brother there's so many uh you know epiphany you can have an epiphany just like that the holy spirit making himself known to his children to each one it's a different thing to me it's different to you it's different but it doesn't matter as long as you get it and as long as god makes himself known to you and that you just don't get it one time and then it stopped and you say i got it no but it becomes a continuous because a rock follows you everywhere you go and it's always ever present water in the rock and it's always the word in the present stage of its ministry present tense truth amen for god is always moving on hallelujah amen thanks be to god amen yes praise god hallelujah so we know then that when luther declared his message out of his message had to come twins too because the prophet said every revival produces twins now we know he didn't go into things like go into it and break it down but here we are telling you that when luther came out he came out with genuine true believers that saw the word of god and he also came out with the impersonators who went on and formed the lutheran denomination one stand with the word and the others believe and claim to believe that they stayed with the world with luther's word too but they went out and formed that denomination and had themselves called lutherans see so there was twins in his day also you can follow it down through wesley how he preached the word of sanctification and so on and uh until it comes right on down to pentecost where the identification was you operate the gifts of the holy spirit that was what was for that day that it would operate like that in that day oh my think about it praise god hallelujah and so friends which i know and i've seen with my eyes and heard with my own hairs oh that people were receiving gifts and operating gifts and receiving the holy spirit and yet they were not born again they were not born again and yet they were dancing in the spirit jumping praising god genuinely sincere just like he saw bible says sincere he wasn't joking he was searching for repentance he just didn't have a seat so it doesn't matter how much he jumped how much he searched how much he cried how much he hollered or on the floors how many miracles he performed how many crowds he could gather it didn't matter he did not have that deposit of god the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ amen by grace hallelujah that he received it and so my brothers and sisters they received the operation of these gifts within their lives and back then everybody was striving i was striving and i'm saying that because i was like at the tail end of old pentecost you know seeing some of the things that were happening amongst them and how god was moving in a mighty mighty way effortlessly without human works the holy spirit would be moving up amongst them praise the name of the lord and they did get the baptist holy spirit to come on them it did come but thank god he sent a messenger in our day because with the opening of the seven seals and with the mysteries of the mystery of god being made known and declared and by the preaching of the anointed ones at the end time we come to understand you can have the baptism of the holy spirit and i hear a lot of brothers talk about getting the baptist holy spirit he said you can have it on you everyday your life and still go to hell he wasn't preaching that under the first and second poll but later on he comes to preach the anointed ones when those seals open and said oh you can have the baptism of the holy spirit on you every day of your life and still go to hell oh my we say oh how could that be how could it be then he began to break it down because he see now it's made known to him for him he said the bible become a new bible the whole thing began so often he says what the baptist holy spirit come and settle down to their spirit but there's it can't go on whatever soul that is there because they're nothing there to rebirth there's nothing there to revive nothing there to bring to life so it come and anoint their spirit and anoint them enough that they could discern they could do miracles they could they can outdo you you know all kinds of gifts and movements of the holy spirit and things like that praise god but one gift that you have amen that that they don't have and they're looking at that and wanting to know what is it and the gift that you have is that you can hear the word you can grasp the word you can receive it praise god and it's crystal clear to you amen praise god you say oh i believe the message oh there's a lot just that statement if you know what you're really saying uh oh praise god hallelujah amen i thank god hallelujah because i know many back there that spoke in tongues amen but they weren't born again i think i told you here how uh how one of my uh schoolmate who later became a big interpreter and translator in the government or whatever else you know uh we he want us to pray for him to receive the holy ghost to praise god so we lay hands upon him and oh my the baptism came on him he started speaking in towns and everything else but he's speaking in tongues but let's say something just told me and the brother that was with me that's a devil that's not the holy ghost even though he's speaking in towns and i looked at we didn't talk i just looked at him and he looked at me and we were kind of startled and then i said then you spoke to that devil and say you devil you try to deceive us that you are the holy spirit and you're a devil and you're speaking in towns and the devil just just laugh and then he begins to tell his history and so on which i won't go into where he came from and listen uh oh my and from that day i was still in pentecost i knew tongues couldn't be the evidence so when the prophet's message came and he spoke ah now you got a confirmation here's a prophet saying it now you see you can even believe it but you're still not certain amen but a prophet comes and says thus saith the lord amen that makes you certain of god hallelujah my brother sister i tell you i knew that and of course you know when a seal breaks when something like that breaks it starts to bring disturbance because imagine you go in the denomination and you're going to their foundational doctrine to tell them that that's not scriptural who are you you're not even a theologian you don't even have a dd brother philip oh can you tell me that we you know oh so that was something else but i'm saying to you my friends is that the prophet made clear that later that the evidence because you know which i won't touch on that one time he preached that it was it was love you know another he preached it was the fruits of the spirit like that and that's why they don't understand brother branham's message is out there like that and they're reading from 1940 45 or 44 and they're coming down and they're taking it all and jungle it together and they don't understand that he was growing also just like anybody else he was growing in his understanding of what god wanted to do with him and through him and so later on he says oh myself and brother vale were talking and we were talking about love and this and that and i said you know that seems to be the foundational thing brother vale i believe love is the evidence and we held to that that love is the evidence but somewhere else listen what he says but when an angel of god from heaven comes down and stands before you amen and tells you it's not love did not our lord say when he the spirit of truth has come what will he do what's the evidence he will guide you into all truth and show you things to come there is the evidence according to the lord himself this is the angel speaking to him oh my he says what are you going to say then oh my goodness so the to receive the holy ghost is to receive a understanding of the word of god hallelujah revealed to you by god himself and then in the future whom he says and then go out and live it hallelujah how are you going to know to live it if you don't have a revelation of what you're supposed to be living you're just living hoping to hit it hit the bull's-eye or hit it this way or that but the real believer knows that once they have caught the revelation by the holy spirit now they just walk they just walk praise god oh my goodness i walked into that you know what they're not going to fall down there and cry they're going to rise and try again they just keep walking because they know the lord is with them and he promised he would never leave them but he'll be with them to the very end of the age and now they understand that that means that because i'll be in you and with you for the end to the very end of the age because he was with you all the time all the time it was in you but then he had to make you aware that i am when you i'm with you every step of the way praise god hallelujah he's in your falling you're standing he's in your sleeping he's in your waking he's in your everything he's everything to me amen i said he's everything to me oh praise god hallelujah amen yes sir oh praise god amen and then you know that once you are conscious of having that word right in you in other words you have the right birth everybody's saying they have it but you know that you have the right birth praise the lord so here it is brother you start to realize that then even while i'm living this life his life my mistakes then are covered by his blood because it's his life that i'm living and he already shed his blood and it cleanses us from all sin all the mistakes praise the lord hallelujah you gotta you don't let me say that because praise the lord you in other words you've been issued a pardon before you even went and committed any crime just think about it you you've been issued a partner and you didn't commit the crime as yet amen but god being god he looks ahead and he knows everything we're gonna do praise the name of the lord and already issue you a pardon so you come in the world already pardoned you come in the world already justified you never sin in the first place the sins you made which is what uh which i paused here satan always gets us with that to make you condemn yourself because we we we come in and get trapped in the human flesh and you will make mistakes i don't care who you are he said i look dumb and i look for one righteous and there was not one righteous not one what but lord there's priests there's high priests there's all kinds of kings and good people yes there were but there's still subject to making mistakes hallelujah oh praise god but thank god in us there is a germ there's a gene there's a seed of god and as first john says the seed of god does not commit sin doesn't mean your flesh out here don't commit sin but that man inside there don't want to commit sin he has no desire to sin that's why the bible says but if you sin you see how it puts it because it knows your will but you don't really want to but if you sin you have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous hallelujah praise be to god hallelujah we're not excusing sinning but we're making clear to you that you are not done in guilt and condemnation and wallow in the valley of despair but rise to the mountain tops of hope and help because our god is our help amen praise god i look onto the hills from where's come at my head my help comes from the capstone my heart comes from him he is the same yesterday the day and forever amen praise god hallelujah glad i'm inside the age of grace praise god i'm not here by my good works i'm not talking like this because of my own study of my own morals or your own morals i am here you are here but for the grace of god it's the grace of god what grace through his choosing one conscious of it no nothing about it but i just i don't know why he loved me amen why did he have to have his mind his thoughts on me that's what brother branham said amen it could have been a million others but you were elected and that makes you who you are by his grace not that you were better like abraham better than anybody else but god in his own mind knows why he chose you and that's his business of why he did it and so that's why we are here and that's why we walk so humble and matter of fact you almost walk hidden as the bible talks about god's hidden ones you don't even want to be known recognized for nothing because there is nothing there except for he himself if you want to recognize him amen praise the name of the lord amen praise god we haven't come here now to add on some works we're not here to add on works on it amen praise god hallelujah the reason why brother brother we are getting revelation is because we're living so holy we're living good oh my brother you get revelation because you're fasting and praying for 14 days oh you're separating yourself before god and by yourself and that's why the bible breaking up and opening up to you no that's not the reason why it's open to you because god knows you and knows what he's placed in you and even if you did nothing he would still open the word of god to you when the time comes for you to know he said they will know when it is time for them to go amen god will make his word known praise the lord amen praise god i want you to get this idea we're not getting anything by works by any merit anything we earn we're all getting it by grace grace hallelujah praise god there's a capstone and what did the bible says and when he restores the capstone it will come down crying grace grace grace grace hallelujah his grace and mercy has brought me through it's his grace and mercy sometimes i wonder lord how you have patience with me how you have grace with me i i don't even know how i'm making it true but but lord i'm just making it through by your grace it's just you that's keeping me alive it's just you that's watching over me it's just you that's covering me under your blood it's just you that's leading and guiding me every step of the way i can't claim anything it's just by the grace of almighty god when we look around us everything around us people around us believers so so-called around us seem to be falling away from us falling away from us and around us and god continually leading us into deeper and deeper truths and revelations of himself oh my oh praise god the seed will not be heir with the shock and god is fulfilling his word in this last day in which we live praise the lord amen yes sir praise god hallelujah oh my how wonderful is it isn't it wonderful to you oh it's marvelous and wonderful to me that everything is already settled in heaven so what are you worrying about down here it's settled in heaven you might go through all kinds of different actions but god is sitting and watching and it's going to come to one end anyway that he's looking at so it's settled in heaven praise god uh i'm one of them it's settled in heaven you you're going to be in the rapture it's already settled in heaven praise god it's paid he's paid the price it's all over praise god hallelujah you know what the we we're just here living out the part of the drama that he has placed us here to do amen because the whole thing is settled in heaven glory to god hallelujah amen and no matter what we have to go through my brothers and sisters he in his mind he has already got you glorified he's not just seeing you right now where you are but he's seeing you glorified he's seeing you brother shining glowing with the light of god around you amen i almost say with your two wings but we know it's that's just the mythology of the world out there that they come with two wings amen praise god but god sees us glorified paul says that you know that in the word justified and he says you're glorified now god see in his mind you're glorified you physically naturally speaking people looking at you you glorified i see this i see that i see that but see that is not what god is looking at he's looking the finished product there and saying i see you're glorified i see you oh when you come out of this here you'll be perfect you like gold you've been refined you've been proved on your path through qaddish barnea and here you are glorified in his divine presence glory to god i'm going to stop right now praise the lord hallelujah amen unless you want to continue on through till 2 in the morning amen but for now let's let's hold it here do you mind if i follow this thought up next week is

here that have caught the revelation of this last prophet's message and we know who we are and what we're raised up for praise the lord that we can be here to express the original life that was back
