[35:31] could you put that up and let's all read
[35:33] it together
[35:39] and
[35:40] some days
[35:42] after paul said unto barnabas
[35:46] let us go again
[35:49] and visit our brethren
[35:51] in every city
[35:54] where we have preached the word of god
[35:57] for the purpose of that
[35:59] and see how they do
[36:02] amen
[36:03] and that was my purpose praise the lord
[36:06] let us pray our gracious heavenly father
[36:10] we thank you for the word of god
[36:13] we thank you for the blessed holy spirit
[36:16] we thank you lord and
[36:19] not that you're not here
[36:21] but lord won't you just draw
[36:24] near oh god so that not just my words
[36:29] talking but that you will testify
[36:33] that these things are the truth
[36:36] and they are according to your will
[36:38] purpose and plan we give you all the
[36:40] glory
[36:42] the honor and the praise father for you
[36:45] said if i be lifted up i'll draw all men
[36:48] unto myself in jesus name amen god bless
[36:53] you please be seated
[36:56] not that i am paul
[36:59] because paul
[37:01] is an individual and we're all
[37:03] individuals
[37:05] but in each age god calls men and put
[37:08] them in the service for his glory
[37:11] praise his name
[37:13] i want you to know that
[37:16] we took our flight
[37:18] not without a
[37:20] fight because
[37:22] at the last moment we understood we are
[37:25] supposed to have
[37:27] uh the covet test
[37:30] uh just to leave the country
[37:33] the the rules changing you know on the
[37:36] fly
[37:38] however um
[37:41] we found out that there was a little
[37:44] kiosk
[37:45] in the parking garage
[37:48] of the uh airport
[37:52] and so we rushed over there with a car
[37:55] with our car
[37:56] and we were able to take the test
[37:59] and
[38:00] pass the test
[38:02] and rush back to the airport
[38:04] and uh made or we true
[38:08] we thank god for that that even that he
[38:11] brought us safely through
[38:15] other than that of course we had
[38:17] at least four
[38:19] um covid
[38:22] injections right four vaccines
[38:26] so we were up to the hilt
[38:28] uh he couldn't want anything else we
[38:31] already had it and still we had to have
[38:33] the test
[38:35] uh but nevertheless we took it
[38:37] and um
[38:39] just to say the same thing happened when
[38:40] we were coming back
[38:42] and one brother who is not even a
[38:44] preacher or a pastor
[38:46] he called me out of the blue and said
[38:49] brother um the rules they go back and
[38:52] forth and if i were you
[38:54] you know i was thinking about you and i
[38:56] thinking about these tests when you're
[38:58] leaving the country i would take the
[39:00] test
[39:01] and it's better to be safe than sorry
[39:05] i said you're right brother and i'm
[39:07] gonna do it and i did it
[39:09] and
[39:10] when we arrived in guyana we took out
[39:14] the forms and the stuff on your phone to
[39:18] show them that we had the test and the
[39:20] officers said oh no no we don't need
[39:22] that
[39:26] but you see if i didn't have it these
[39:29] people don't understand
[39:30] if an ordinary person maybe there is
[39:33] this all right
[39:34] but a man of god with the holy spirit
[39:38] carrying the message
[39:40] the devil is going to make sure
[39:42] that if you have one thing out of place
[39:45] he's going to go right there he's going
[39:47] to zero in on it praise god but that was
[39:50] already covered so he couldn't touch it
[39:53] so they said oh just go on through
[39:56] so we came through at the cheddy jagen
[40:00] international airport
[40:03] i must say when i left there
[40:06] remember
[40:07] i the last time i was there
[40:10] is around 1995.
[40:15] praise the lord
[40:17] the visit that i made then
[40:19] and of course the country was run down
[40:24] houses old and broken some still are
[40:28] the roads were made
[40:30] basically
[40:31] red brick like in africa red brick road
[40:36] and when the rain falls is the puddles
[40:39] everywhere
[40:40] and uh stuff like that and when the a
[40:43] car or bus passes is clouds of dust
[40:47] you know inside and outside because you
[40:50] can lock your windows but somehow that
[40:52] dust comes in anyway
[40:56] so
[40:57] and that's why we used to walking to
[40:59] school coming home and everything else
[41:02] but anyway
[41:03] um they built a brand new airport
[41:07] and uh
[41:09] thanks to
[41:11] uh
[41:12] trinidadians like
[41:14] brother chris here
[41:16] their expertise in engineering
[41:19] and along with other international
[41:22] engineers they were able to build a very
[41:26] nice modern airport
[41:29] it's not all that they want or need at
[41:32] this time
[41:35] first of all
[41:37] let me give you this
[41:38] that the country
[41:41] is uh has been so backwards and under
[41:44] the colonial rule it's been was so
[41:47] exploited
[41:49] with all the sugar and the rice and the
[41:51] bauxite and the gold and the diamonds
[41:54] and everything else
[41:55] that uh when the british left there they
[41:59] left a revolution confusion and stuff
[42:02] like that
[42:03] but uh i can see it's it's working
[42:07] itself out
[42:09] because they left it in racial strife
[42:12] and they left it with all manner of uh
[42:15] problems and
[42:18] they're working things out
[42:21] i've seen the
[42:23] uh generations of the people there
[42:26] they're now seeming to meld together
[42:30] until
[42:31] uh when you say
[42:33] a guyanese you're not looking for an
[42:36] indian man
[42:38] or a black man
[42:40] or a chinese man because the whole pot
[42:43] seems to be
[42:44] molded together
[42:47] and
[42:48] what's coming out of that
[42:50] is
[42:51] somebody of mixed race
[42:54] that because we have whites we have
[42:57] chinese we have jews we have blacks we
[43:00] have indians we have the amerindians
[43:02] which are the indians
[43:04] that were originally there and it's all
[43:08] mixed and mixing together right now
[43:12] and that's what's emerging it's a hot
[43:14] country
[43:16] right
[43:16] a hot country it gets a bit cool
[43:20] when it comes down to winter here then
[43:22] it's cool over there but when i say cool
[43:25] not you're cool
[43:30] it's a different cool
[43:33] you will call that cool hot
[43:36] but it's cool for them
[43:39] and they enjoyed it and we enjoyed it
[43:42] because we went at the right time
[43:44] right we went at the right time because
[43:47] now the rainy season has started
[43:50] you don't understand that because you
[43:52] got just the winter and the summer and
[43:54] the fall and so on but there's rainy
[43:56] season that's taking place there now the
[44:00] very day i left the rainy season started
[44:02] and torrential rains begin to fall not
[44:06] the little rains that we have here
[44:08] spitting a little bit and you just walk
[44:09] through now the wind is blowing and the
[44:12] rain is really coming down in torrents
[44:15] right
[44:16] like that uh so it's a hot country like
[44:19] that however
[44:21] what has brought about a lot of this
[44:24] change is not only time
[44:26] but oil
[44:28] has been discovered
[44:31] and
[44:32] that oil
[44:33] is now being exploited or let's use a
[44:37] word developed
[44:38] by many countries many nations
[44:42] are there
[44:43] france
[44:44] america britain israel
[44:48] go down the line they're all rushing in
[44:51] there
[44:52] to have their platform
[44:54] off the shore to pull that oil out and
[44:59] to sell it because um and they want to
[45:02] do it fast
[45:03] because you know with climate change
[45:06] fossil oils are going to go the way of
[45:08] the dodo bird
[45:10] and so they are doing their best and
[45:14] because of that it's provided so many
[45:17] jobs for the local
[45:19] population there
[45:22] and everything you hear is oil offshore
[45:25] and this they're working like that
[45:29] and then
[45:30] as that
[45:32] as the people of some of the people are
[45:34] working it brings an infusion of more
[45:38] cash into the society
[45:41] and as a result you're seeing modern
[45:45] buildings starting to go up
[45:48] more and more
[45:49] um
[45:51] major chains of
[45:53] like hotels
[45:55] like i stayed at the marriott
[45:57] uh that they built they had nothing like
[45:59] that you know nothing whatsoever uh you
[46:02] would call that
[46:04] when i left there like mom-and-pop
[46:06] places that you could stay in but now
[46:08] there's a marriott and when i left the
[46:11] hyatt already broke ground and they're
[46:13] hurrying now because they got to get in
[46:16] there fast who gets there first and fast
[46:19] can establish themselves
[46:22] and
[46:23] the hotels don't hardly have space
[46:26] and the reason why investors is one of
[46:29] the few countries in the world that's
[46:31] still left with forests
[46:34] and areas
[46:35] and environments where nobody has ever
[46:38] tried
[46:39] and
[46:40] there's still stuff to be discovered
[46:43] because you can like i said uh
[46:46] there's gold there where sometimes in
[46:48] the streams they can find it not in the
[46:51] city out in the wild they can find it
[46:54] diamonds the
[46:56] bauxite and caroline and
[46:59] rare earth that they use for the
[47:01] computers it's all there and
[47:04] right now they're not paying too much
[47:05] mind to that they're looking at the oil
[47:07] but there's other people in are quietly
[47:09] going into those things
[47:12] so the hotels are all filled up and
[47:15] there's a need for new hotels sleep in
[47:17] all these little chains and all are
[47:19] hurrying over there and building and
[47:22] locals are who have money are building
[47:25] their own big hotels and encouraging
[47:28] people to go and still they are all
[47:30] filled up
[47:31] why
[47:32] investors are pouring in
[47:35] investors whether it's dubai whether
[47:38] it's america whether it's canada or
[47:40] whether i met some canadians over there
[47:42] from bc by the way and uh and there it
[47:46] is they're just pouring in filling up
[47:48] and trying to get their money invested
[47:51] saudi arabia you know saudi arabia they
[47:54] just came and talked to the government
[47:56] we want to do all the roads in the
[47:58] country we don't care how many billions
[48:02] we want to do all the roads and this one
[48:05] wants to do this brazil
[48:08] as you know brazil can break their goods
[48:10] they have to come down
[48:12] to the bottom of south america and go
[48:15] around
[48:16] to get
[48:18] over to bring their goods to america and
[48:20] to wherever else they want to export it
[48:23] but now they're talking about cutting a
[48:25] road from brazil because we are just
[48:29] neighbors to them
[48:31] and people are already driving on a dirt
[48:34] road to go there and back but they want
[48:37] to develop that road and bring it right
[48:40] to
[48:41] to the major coast and they
[48:45] want to put a deep sea port
[48:49] where great ships and cruise ships can
[48:53] come in
[48:54] on the coastline
[48:57] understand also
[48:59] the capital city built from since
[49:04] well eighteen hundreds or before
[49:06] it was built and you know the dutch had
[49:09] it the french had it the british had it
[49:11] it changed the hands so many times and
[49:15] so the villages have french names some
[49:17] villages have dutch names some have
[49:19] british names
[49:20] it's like that
[49:22] and also it was built
[49:24] three feet below sea level
[49:28] so the dutch were able and you know
[49:30] they're good at that they place great
[49:33] sea walls
[49:35] um on the at the
[49:37] on the coast of the country with sluices
[49:40] and stuff like that which some of the
[49:42] old ones are still there still working
[49:45] and they're trying to hold it back but
[49:47] the united nations already told them
[49:49] the whole capital is going under the sea
[49:53] by 2013.
[49:57] 30 in about eight years time it's
[50:00] supposed to go under right now the rain
[50:03] falls about 20 25 minutes uh half an
[50:05] hour and the capital because they you
[50:09] close the sluices so that the ocean
[50:11] water can't come in
[50:13] then these torrential rains are falling
[50:16] and so behind the sluices are filling up
[50:19] with water
[50:20] and they're ending up with floods
[50:23] floods
[50:24] so that's something
[50:26] that they're talking about moving the
[50:29] capital
[50:30] to a higher ground
[50:32] a higher part of the country
[50:35] and of course that doesn't take a lot of
[50:37] money but now they're having that money
[50:40] starting to pour in uh and i'm sure
[50:42] they'll be able to accomplish it
[50:46] and so we arrived at the chatty jagen
[50:48] airport
[50:50] and we we were transported by brother
[50:54] maxi lee
[50:56] which is the son
[50:58] of a chinese
[51:01] preacher he was a presbyter
[51:05] official
[51:07] over the assemblies of god denomination
[51:11] but after hearing the message
[51:14] uh this
[51:15] at that time 18 year old
[51:17] uh bringing the message receiving it and
[51:20] bringing it
[51:21] um himself and many other ministers
[51:24] received the word
[51:25] and pulled their churches out of the
[51:28] denomination and this young man
[51:31] not young in the sense that he is about
[51:34] 50 something now but um he is the son
[51:38] of that minister praise the lord
[51:41] and he received us
[51:43] and brought us we were so tired
[51:46] right that it brought us to our hotels
[51:49] that night
[51:51] and we slept like a top
[51:55] i didn't dream i just slept
[52:01] and the next day
[52:03] when uh we got uh we woke up
[52:07] praise the lord he allowed us to sleep
[52:09] as late as we wanted and then he picked
[52:11] us up and took us to his home
[52:15] where we had lunch with the family and
[52:17] that was a local feast right
[52:20] a lot of things we didn't see a lot of
[52:22] the fruits and natural fruits
[52:25] and they eat a lot of natural things
[52:28] amen because you know we live here in
[52:32] the north and with the snow and all that
[52:34] our growing season is short there they
[52:36] have fish everywhere
[52:39] they have meat everywhere
[52:41] and the reason for that is just the
[52:43] country is just so bountiful in the
[52:45] sense that
[52:46] the ditches even have fish the people
[52:48] don't even bother with those they get
[52:50] the ones from the sea but if you
[52:53] water is in your ditch next thing the
[52:55] fish is in there you have a pond in the
[52:57] backyard before you know it it's full of
[52:59] fish so
[53:00] you know so there's fish there so uh we
[53:04] want to thank the lord
[53:06] for that we had a glorious um
[53:10] feast with them
[53:11] and
[53:12] they eat a lot organic
[53:15] because they don't have to freeze meat
[53:19] and freeze fish except for a few days
[53:22] keeping it in their freezer
[53:23] but up here
[53:25] we have to freeze it and keep it for
[53:27] months whatever right that's the way we
[53:30] have to live
[53:31] but they have it there every day
[53:34] fresh
[53:35] and they're able to eat it that way
[53:38] praise god and the fruits
[53:41] beautiful
[53:42] the pine
[53:44] is not half green and then when they
[53:46] send it here then it gets ripe or then
[53:49] they force it to get ripe with a gas no
[53:52] this is right right off of when you pick
[53:55] it from
[53:56] the tree right like that the fruits are
[53:58] all fresh so we enjoyed it
[54:02] and the juices ah
[54:04] you know they have the store bought
[54:06] juices but they're making the juices
[54:09] right there
[54:10] and by the way we we should use bottled
[54:14] water every step of the way
[54:18] and uh so all those juices were made
[54:21] with bottled water so that we don't get
[54:23] sick and they're very careful of that
[54:26] that you use it but bottled water i went
[54:29] one place i have to tell you this joke
[54:31] and i was offered a juice
[54:34] but that was okay because made with
[54:36] bottled water but there was ice placed
[54:39] into it
[54:40] and i just wonder i said my i hope this
[54:44] ice is made with the local water
[54:48] so
[54:49] i grabbed the drink and i i drank it off
[54:52] right away before the ice could melt
[54:55] [Laughter]
[54:58] and brother lee is sitting there and
[55:00] he's just smiling
[55:03] he said brother i know why you did that
[55:07] she said but you don't have to worry
[55:08] even the ice was made with bottled water
[55:14] i said well brother i was just making
[55:16] sure
[55:18] anyway
[55:20] we had lunch with them and we stayed
[55:22] there the entire day fellowshipping with
[55:25] them
[55:26] talking with him he getting to know me
[55:29] i'm getting to know him and his family
[55:32] and just to find that this brother
[55:36] has caught the same revelation
[55:40] that we have right here right now
[55:44] and i mean it's caught in a deep way not
[55:48] just skin deep but he's caught the
[55:50] revelation of the fullness of the word
[55:52] of god
[55:54] and uh
[55:56] not let's say not waiting for me just to
[55:59] talk to him but he's talking and what
[56:02] he's talking is lying right up with the
[56:04] word
[56:06] uh and then as he begins to talk to me
[56:10] then i understood
[56:12] why god took me from there
[56:15] and then he was explaining to me
[56:19] his understanding
[56:21] of what god was showing to him
[56:24] that i left and when i left and came out
[56:27] i thought i was just thinking of me but
[56:30] he said no
[56:31] all the other original ministers that
[56:34] were there
[56:35] some died
[56:37] and the other ones all came out up to
[56:41] your left
[56:43] and just this new young generation had
[56:46] to grow up with the word alone
[56:50] so they're not coming with any pattern
[56:53] from me they're not coming from any
[56:55] influence from me they're not come they
[56:57] just come with the influence of the word
[57:01] and because of that coming up in the
[57:04] purity of the word of god there come
[57:07] forth a generation stronger
[57:10] revelation
[57:12] understanding the word
[57:15] in a great marvelous wonderful way and i
[57:18] want to thank god for that and give god
[57:20] glory
[57:27] the funny thing about it is not just
[57:29] this brother but going uh uh meeting
[57:33] some of the other ministers we had a
[57:34] lunch and some came in all couldn't come
[57:37] because they had the storms and rain
[57:39] but uh
[57:41] they all caught the revelation of this
[57:44] last prophet's message not just caught
[57:46] the message but the revelation of that
[57:48] message
[57:49] amen and i praise god to see it
[57:53] spread
[57:54] a country wide among the believers and
[57:57] around the preachers of the word of god
[58:01] hallelujah i thank god for that
[58:04] amen
[58:06] so i give god praise hallelujah amen
[58:11] i thank god
[58:12] that
[58:14] on that the next day also
[58:18] i received a surprise visitor
[58:21] came up with another bike
[58:23] and that was a chinese
[58:25] brother whose family was converted at
[58:29] that time
[58:30] uh brother duncan hing
[58:33] and he's the one that i always tell you
[58:35] the old church-age book that i teach out
[58:37] of
[58:38] he has his writing on it that he's
[58:40] presented it to me well you know before
[58:43] i left the country and i've been using
[58:44] that ever since and he was so excited i
[58:47] came he came to visit me
[58:49] so we made arrangements that we're going
[58:51] to visit himself and his sister
[58:55] his sister that was converted was a
[58:57] school mate of my
[58:59] wife
[59:01] and uh they always were very close
[59:05] back there and talking with each other
[59:08] and was a real blessing uh later on to
[59:11] go and visit
[59:13] with them i thank god for that that
[59:16] we're able to go and visit with them
[59:20] later on praise the lord
[59:22] now they usually have a midweek prayer
[59:26] meeting that's on a wednesday night
[59:30] and
[59:31] since i just came
[59:33] and it was a wednesday night and a
[59:35] brother desiring for me to speak on a
[59:37] sunday
[59:38] i just said a few words at the prayer
[59:41] meeting but it was wonderful their
[59:44] prayer meeting was wonderful to be there
[59:47] or with them
[59:48] in a wonderful way
[59:51] god bless it
[59:53] and bless them
[59:55] in a marvelous and wonderful way thank
[59:58] god
[1:00:00] what a blessing brother and then
[1:00:03] we
[1:00:04] met with them
[1:00:06] on sunday to preach the word of god
[1:00:10] there praise the lord and ministered
[1:00:13] god's word
[1:00:14] so we ministered on the from the dust to
[1:00:17] the stars
[1:00:19] how god said to abraham
[1:00:22] that i'll make your children like the
[1:00:24] dust they'll number less like the dust
[1:00:27] then after that he gave him a promise
[1:00:29] that uh
[1:00:31] they're going to be more than the stars
[1:00:33] forever amen hallelujah so we took the
[1:00:36] thought of god raising us all up out of
[1:00:39] the mirror clear the dust and taking us
[1:00:42] right back to the heavenly places uh to
[1:00:45] be the morning stars that shouted around
[1:00:48] the throne of god and that sort of thing
[1:00:50] and they were shouting to and praising
[1:00:53] god hallelujah and we had a wonderful
[1:00:56] glorious time i couldn't finish of
[1:00:58] course but we had a glorious time around
[1:01:01] the word of god amen and we want to
[1:01:03] thank god for that hallelujah and there
[1:01:08] i was able
[1:01:09] to meet
[1:01:11] um
[1:01:12] brother peter
[1:01:14] this is another brother peter not the
[1:01:16] one we knew over here
[1:01:18] he's already dead and gone so this is
[1:01:20] not a reincarnation
[1:01:23] this is another brother peter he's an
[1:01:25] indian brother
[1:01:27] i told you about a place where
[1:01:31] um
[1:01:33] we went to testify
[1:01:35] and this muhammadan gentleman and we
[1:01:38] talked about brother branham and his
[1:01:40] message he said brother
[1:01:42] branham he said you believe prophet
[1:01:45] branham
[1:01:46] what prophet
[1:01:48] how you know about brother branham then
[1:01:49] he tells the story
[1:01:51] how he went to throughout his garbage
[1:01:54] and we had given out books in that area
[1:01:57] and he found one in the in the garbage
[1:01:59] can
[1:02:00] and he didn't know who put it there he
[1:02:02] took it out he read it and he got
[1:02:04] converted from islam to christ
[1:02:08] hallelujah
[1:02:11] and this man was his son that came to
[1:02:14] the service
[1:02:15] praise the lord
[1:02:17] and the beautiful thing is
[1:02:19] there is a church right there in that
[1:02:23] village to this day there's a church
[1:02:25] that's going on there now
[1:02:27] when i left it was just him and his son
[1:02:29] and his wife but now there's a church
[1:02:31] there
[1:02:33] and we give god praise
[1:02:37] [Applause]
[1:02:39] i want to praise god for that what a
[1:02:42] blessing
[1:02:43] and there i met also a couple of people
[1:02:47] that knew me
[1:02:49] from way back then
[1:02:52] i met the son
[1:02:54] of some of the sisters the sons of some
[1:02:57] of the sisters daughters of some of the
[1:02:59] sisters and brothers that were back
[1:03:02] there that have now gone on to be with
[1:03:04] the lord
[1:03:06] yes brothers no matter how we are how
[1:03:08] durable we are
[1:03:10] one by one
[1:03:12] they gain the portals
[1:03:15] there to dwell with the immortals
[1:03:19] when they ring them
[1:03:21] golden bells for you
[1:03:25] and me
[1:03:27] yes
[1:03:28] they crossed over but they left behind
[1:03:31] them a legacy of faith
[1:03:34] may you also
[1:03:36] when you cross
[1:03:38] leave a legacy of faith in the hearts of
[1:03:41] your children your family and all those
[1:03:44] around you
[1:03:45] if they have nothing else the riches of
[1:03:48] christ planted within their soul that's
[1:03:50] the treasure above all that they can
[1:03:53] ever have
[1:03:54] thank god
[1:03:56] then
[1:03:58] brother maxie with his vehicle
[1:04:02] took us
[1:04:04] over onto the west coast of the country
[1:04:08] and there
[1:04:10] we went by the grace of god
[1:04:13] and visited
[1:04:14] on that in that part of the country
[1:04:17] and showing him
[1:04:20] another convert
[1:04:22] that was there one from a whole village
[1:04:25] and now i've gone back
[1:04:27] there is a church there
[1:04:29] functioning by the grace of god
[1:04:33] praise the lord
[1:04:39] he passed away
[1:04:41] just about a year ago or
[1:04:44] so he's gone on and right now they're in
[1:04:46] between of uh playing tapes and
[1:04:50] a new pastor and that and just yesterday
[1:04:52] um you know stuff has been made for some
[1:04:55] contact with me so that i can
[1:04:58] give some advice or say something
[1:05:00] whatever god will lead but that's
[1:05:02] happening also we give god the glory
[1:05:04] because there's a church there and we
[1:05:07] give god praise and honor um for that
[1:05:10] praise god even the essence of god
[1:05:12] benefit
[1:05:14] because from this the
[1:05:16] the
[1:05:17] town where my wife was converted in
[1:05:20] and um you know some of the land that
[1:05:23] the british had given me to build
[1:05:26] at 18 years old a big building
[1:05:30] and the denominations took it because
[1:05:32] he's young we can handle it and they
[1:05:34] took it in their name and kept it well
[1:05:37] they do have a church there now
[1:05:39] not on that spot they had to go by their
[1:05:42] own but they have a church there now uh
[1:05:45] in that
[1:05:46] city also so we thank the lord that our
[1:05:50] work was not in vain
[1:05:52] and we give him the glory i didn't go to
[1:05:54] the eastern part of the country i
[1:05:56] understand their church is there too but
[1:05:58] i didn't go to that eastern part of the
[1:06:00] country praise god of course i couldn't
[1:06:02] go to every church because
[1:06:05] brothers and sisters
[1:06:07] it's amazing brother maxilisa's brother
[1:06:11] i don't know fully how many churches
[1:06:14] there are now
[1:06:17] from off of your
[1:06:19] the word because that's what they wanted
[1:06:22] to know they wanted to know how did the
[1:06:24] message start how did it flow out and
[1:06:27] then i went down there to find out that
[1:06:29] a lot of myths
[1:06:31] and fantastic
[1:06:32] stories were being told of how the
[1:06:34] message started how it started under an
[1:06:37] old oak tree
[1:06:42] oh my goodness and things of that nature
[1:06:46] what i said no no no no no and then i
[1:06:49] had to recount to them how the old minor
[1:06:53] prophet
[1:06:54] before
[1:06:56] brother branham we didn't know anything
[1:06:58] about brother branham
[1:06:59] but this old short heavyset man
[1:07:03] uh believed and was teaching already in
[1:07:06] the name of jesus christ
[1:07:08] baptizing in jesus name
[1:07:10] and against denomination never joined
[1:07:14] one of them
[1:07:15] and believed in one god
[1:07:17] so obviously when the message came to
[1:07:20] the country
[1:07:21] it went to him
[1:07:23] because all the denominations recognized
[1:07:25] him they knew something was going on
[1:07:28] so it went to him but
[1:07:31] he had a a bible i guess the size of my
[1:07:36] portfolio
[1:07:38] this size and thick like that so um he
[1:07:42] could read but slow and picking here and
[1:07:45] picking there so because i prayed with
[1:07:48] him i used to pray with him he would ask
[1:07:51] me to read certain things for him so
[1:07:53] when those books came and then i went
[1:07:55] through the story telling them how
[1:07:58] brother ro came there and the
[1:08:00] denominations
[1:08:02] tried to lock him up in their minister's
[1:08:04] conference and
[1:08:06] god made him get so thirsty
[1:08:10] and they had put this old preacher to be
[1:08:12] the cook
[1:08:17] and he got so thirsty all of a sudden he
[1:08:19] goes to the kitchen to get a drink of
[1:08:21] water and while he's getting the drink
[1:08:23] of water he says well thank god there's
[1:08:25] only one god and i believe him and
[1:08:28] brother said amen brother praise god he
[1:08:31] said no baptism is amen so he's taken
[1:08:35] back he's not getting a chance to
[1:08:36] testify because this person is amen
[1:08:40] everything so he just ran back to his
[1:08:43] briefcase because if he took too long
[1:08:45] talking to the brother they're gonna
[1:08:47] come to see what he's doing why he's
[1:08:49] taking so long just to get a drink of
[1:08:51] water so he just cut the two box go back
[1:08:54] hand it to the brother run back to his
[1:08:57] seat
[1:08:57] and the next morning he had to fly out
[1:08:59] to the country
[1:09:01] and so the brother took those two books
[1:09:04] and of course i explained to them how i
[1:09:06] was in assemblies of god
[1:09:09] uh what happened in new amsterdam the
[1:09:11] revival that broke out there the church
[1:09:14] is still there uh
[1:09:16] 2500 people i was just a young teenager
[1:09:20] and that was happening so they gave me a
[1:09:24] scholarship and this was the
[1:09:26] third year i was in and they stuck the
[1:09:29] book stuck under the door and read the
[1:09:32] books and all my
[1:09:34] all the things come tumbling down all
[1:09:37] the ambitions right
[1:09:39] so i said i had to cast down my crown
[1:09:41] like the 24 elders
[1:09:44] and of course i applied it to them i
[1:09:46] said you need to cast them all your
[1:09:48] crowns not that you don't need to be
[1:09:49] educated but you can have your wall
[1:09:52] plastered with degrees and you're
[1:09:53] depending on that nah
[1:09:55] you you forget that and like paul put
[1:09:58] your mind on jesus christ
[1:10:01] so
[1:10:02] um
[1:10:03] i explained to them how it all started
[1:10:05] it wasn't on the new oak tree
[1:10:07] i i gave them the entire history of how
[1:10:11] when the message started when it i first
[1:10:14] alone had it and started to share it in
[1:10:16] the bible school and it broke another
[1:10:18] little
[1:10:20] revival fire in there where young
[1:10:22] ministers came out young
[1:10:24] women came out and so on like that and
[1:10:28] ministers all the ministers that were
[1:10:30] officials in there came out praise god
[1:10:33] and the word started to take off and we
[1:10:36] thank god for that but
[1:10:38] i was already out of the assemblies of
[1:10:40] god
[1:10:41] the church
[1:10:42] that i was preaching at
[1:10:44] in my wife's tongue
[1:10:47] and we had nowhere to go because we were
[1:10:50] put out
[1:10:52] and we wonder where we're gonna go we
[1:10:55] found an old
[1:10:56] garage
[1:10:58] that was covered with weeds
[1:11:01] and
[1:11:02] we asked the owner if we can have it to
[1:11:05] use
[1:11:06] even if we have to pay a small steep end
[1:11:10] and he said no you can have it well sure
[1:11:12] he wanted us to have it it was next door
[1:11:14] to a
[1:11:15] liquor
[1:11:17] house
[1:11:18] we call it a spirit house
[1:11:21] that's actually what it is but that's
[1:11:23] the spirit shop
[1:11:26] all kinds of spirits in there
[1:11:29] because while i was preaching they were
[1:11:30] commenting
[1:11:32] it's not like hair you know
[1:11:35] it's not like here the people are hot
[1:11:36] blooded and they're reacting everything
[1:11:39] else so i'm preaching and what are you
[1:11:41] talking about you know they say oh so
[1:11:43] everybody knows the bible
[1:11:45] claim to know the bible so
[1:11:47] and
[1:11:48] and then not only that brother if it was
[1:11:51] that alone it was okay but you're
[1:11:53] preaching at whom
[1:11:55] it's the it's the whiskey or the rum
[1:11:57] bottle went by your head
[1:12:01] so
[1:12:02] you better be under the holy spirit to
[1:12:04] protect you and then
[1:12:07] conquer you're
[1:12:07] there's bricks on
[1:12:11] on the zinc sheet above your head praise
[1:12:14] god so
[1:12:15] your the people had to really believe or
[1:12:19] they wouldn't even come back
[1:12:21] and i'm telling you we hail to god's
[1:12:24] unchanging hand because we believe the
[1:12:26] prophet of this hour
[1:12:29] praise god behold to god's word
[1:12:32] and that night
[1:12:34] myself
[1:12:35] and about four of the brothers
[1:12:38] uh while i mentioned that let me mention
[1:12:40] one of those brothers that was with me
[1:12:42] there
[1:12:43] brother chapman
[1:12:44] uh we used to you know we get we have
[1:12:47] names we call one another we used to
[1:12:49] call him the scientists because natural
[1:12:51] things he knows this he knows that you
[1:12:52] know so he's a scientist
[1:12:54] but brother chapman
[1:12:57] he went to the extreme
[1:13:01] end of the country towards the west
[1:13:04] through the jungles and all that with
[1:13:06] this message
[1:13:07] and preached it there
[1:13:09] in a city called let them now a city
[1:13:13] well then it was just a little village
[1:13:15] and started the church there and to my
[1:13:18] surprise it continued and he died his
[1:13:21] son is carrying it on and the church is
[1:13:24] there growing by the grace of god
[1:13:27] hallelujah
[1:13:31] and right now the the brother lee is
[1:13:34] thinking of of uh growing and expanding
[1:13:38] the building and the whole thing that's
[1:13:41] going on there now for god's glory and
[1:13:44] praise because some people even from
[1:13:47] brazil
[1:13:48] next door
[1:13:50] you know want to come and visit and
[1:13:53] preach and
[1:13:55] pray and fellowship by god's grace but
[1:13:58] let me say this to you i'm i'm just
[1:14:01] talking right so don't forget me if i
[1:14:04] don't keep a logical sequential way of
[1:14:06] speaking but um
[1:14:09] from from the five churches
[1:14:12] that were left there
[1:14:15] now he says brother i don't know how
[1:14:18] many there are i can we only count as
[1:14:22] far as i know 36
[1:14:25] that we know of right now and there are
[1:14:28] others out there that we may not be
[1:14:30] aware of
[1:14:31] praise the lord those of you look
[1:14:34] brothers you know how i felt from five
[1:14:37] to
[1:14:38] 36 and counting i give god the praise
[1:14:41] and the honor and the glory
[1:14:44] [Applause]
[1:14:46] for he's the same yesterday today and
[1:14:49] whatever
[1:14:50] praise be to god hallelujah
[1:14:53] oh we came back from that uh visit
[1:14:58] and then
[1:14:59] by the grace of god
[1:15:01] the brother
[1:15:02] said he would take me
[1:15:04] towards the western part of the country
[1:15:08] and part of that will be on the edge
[1:15:11] of starting to go to the jungle
[1:15:14] just the edge right because i told him i
[1:15:17] said no brother i am not able anymore to
[1:15:22] go into these uh you know jungle parts
[1:15:25] there and boat turn over and swimming in
[1:15:28] the middle of the night and
[1:15:30] all these things like that you know i've
[1:15:32] been through that already and i'm not
[1:15:34] going to go through it again i'm not
[1:15:36] able to go through it again
[1:15:38] so um he just took me on the edge
[1:15:41] of or the jungle and we praise god for
[1:15:45] that i'll show you some of the pictures
[1:15:47] uh later on after we have them all set
[1:15:50] up but god to god's glory
[1:15:55] uh
[1:15:56] i'll show you the crossing
[1:15:58] because we cross the asiquibo river
[1:16:01] that river
[1:16:03] is 22 miles wide
[1:16:07] not two miles
[1:16:09] 22 miles
[1:16:12] in that river
[1:16:14] there are islands larger
[1:16:17] than some of the islands in the west
[1:16:19] indies
[1:16:21] right
[1:16:22] in that river and uh we thank god and
[1:16:26] people are living on them they're
[1:16:27] occupied and people are living on them
[1:16:30] thousands of people living on them but
[1:16:32] he took me to the actual coast
[1:16:34] on the other side of that river and you
[1:16:37] have to go into a
[1:16:39] ferry
[1:16:41] a large ferry and thank god for the
[1:16:43] chinese
[1:16:46] because they couldn't buy some of the
[1:16:49] ships and ferries that was offered by
[1:16:52] some of the other countries but the
[1:16:55] chinese were able to build a big ferry
[1:16:58] at a very good price
[1:17:01] and they're smart down there
[1:17:03] they
[1:17:05] took out the engines that might have
[1:17:07] broken down and weren't so good and they
[1:17:09] put in
[1:17:10] diesel engines from
[1:17:12] what one of the companies that we know
[1:17:15] one of these british companies anyway
[1:17:17] but they put in reliable diesel uh
[1:17:21] engines in there and that ferry takes a
[1:17:25] whole bunch of cars i can't remember how
[1:17:27] many if it's 50 or 40 cars and
[1:17:31] passengers and everything else
[1:17:33] and we were able to cross
[1:17:36] that so it's not a little
[1:17:38] boat like they used to do years ago and
[1:17:41] you pop up
[1:17:42] and you're going along like that now
[1:17:44] this is a big fairy
[1:17:46] praise god
[1:17:48] and
[1:17:49] sister simon wouldn't go on it unless it
[1:17:51] was a big ferry
[1:17:54] [Laughter]
[1:17:56] anyway we made it over the other side
[1:17:59] and there uh we
[1:18:01] were introduced to some brethren to
[1:18:04] their home and we had lunch there it was
[1:18:07] wonderful to have lunch with them
[1:18:10] uh
[1:18:11] jenny
[1:18:12] and i call the brother big john because
[1:18:15] i'm little john
[1:18:18] and he is big john
[1:18:21] so
[1:18:22] we had a wonderful time of fellowship
[1:18:24] with them recounting old stories and
[1:18:28] sharing things and um eating a lot of uh
[1:18:33] these were indian people but so we had a
[1:18:36] lot of indian fare that we were
[1:18:38] partaking of you know um dal puri and
[1:18:42] dal and curry and
[1:18:45] you know
[1:18:46] chicken and whatnot we enjoyed it all
[1:18:49] praise the lord i don't want to have you
[1:18:51] slobbering on
[1:18:54] leave the service halfway out to to go
[1:18:56] get some of that but anyway we enjoyed
[1:18:59] it
[1:19:00] and we had a wonderful time
[1:19:02] that night we're going to service
[1:19:06] well i thought the service would be
[1:19:08] on the main road the nice building and
[1:19:11] everything else but no
[1:19:14] i told you he was taking me to the edge
[1:19:16] of the jungle he just took me
[1:19:18] we went off and we took a dirt road
[1:19:23] and this dirt road in the pitch black
[1:19:27] there are no
[1:19:28] lights shining
[1:19:30] and he said but occasionally you see the
[1:19:33] jaguars in the light
[1:19:34] in crossing road
[1:19:39] or the deer or they will see a gootie or
[1:19:41] whatever animals crossing the road
[1:19:44] and
[1:19:47] some of the people walk
[1:19:49] he gave these people a lift
[1:19:52] in his vehicle to go to the church
[1:19:54] and the church is about
[1:19:56] two miles down that road
[1:19:59] and they walk in that pitch black
[1:20:01] to go to the church
[1:20:03] to have fellowship
[1:20:05] brethren you see how much god has
[1:20:07] blessed us
[1:20:09] how much we can enjoy
[1:20:11] that we can just go into our car start
[1:20:14] it up and drive and complain that
[1:20:22] is that right
[1:20:23] we try to complain they're walking for
[1:20:26] two miles in the pitch black
[1:20:29] wild animals are there you understand
[1:20:35] when i said wild animals not i just
[1:20:37] mentioned a jaguar let me not talk about
[1:20:39] the snakes
[1:20:42] because we have the snakes from the size
[1:20:45] this fat
[1:20:46] and 30 feet long
[1:20:48] down to the small tiny ones that are
[1:20:50] poisonous deadly
[1:20:53] and in the dark you can't see where
[1:20:56] you're walking what you're doing or
[1:20:57] anything you're going by faith not just
[1:21:00] singing faith
[1:21:02] but real faith
[1:21:05] amen
[1:21:06] you really have to depend on god to
[1:21:08] protect you
[1:21:09] [Music]
[1:21:10] right
[1:21:11] so to a certain degree this doesn't make
[1:21:14] not american believers any less because
[1:21:18] your faith is being exercised in a
[1:21:20] different way
[1:21:22] on the different culture in a different
[1:21:24] condition but under that culture and
[1:21:28] those things they have to have that kind
[1:21:31] of faith
[1:21:33] you know some of those brothers tell me
[1:21:35] about being bitten several times by
[1:21:38] poisonous snake and no hospital and and
[1:21:44] and praise god they're still living
[1:21:47] amen well you get bitten by a snake you
[1:21:50] get less than that and first thing you
[1:21:52] think let me run to the hospital or some
[1:21:54] dead see but the first their first
[1:21:58] thought
[1:21:59] is to look to god above
[1:22:01] who said by his stripes you are healed
[1:22:06] hey man it's not that you you see let me
[1:22:09] let me say that again it's not that you
[1:22:11] don't believe that you believe it
[1:22:14] but you are under a different culture
[1:22:18] you don't have to believe it like them
[1:22:20] because they got to face it like that
[1:22:23] every day
[1:22:25] of course not the christians in the city
[1:22:27] there because they
[1:22:29] they're in the city they don't see that
[1:22:32] um that sort of thing but anyway
[1:22:35] he
[1:22:36] took us down this dirt road for about
[1:22:38] two miles
[1:22:40] and then
[1:22:41] we came to this building
[1:22:44] you know covered with the zinc
[1:22:46] and uh around it uh walls that are about
[1:22:51] five feet high and the rest of it is
[1:22:53] just poles and
[1:22:55] holding it up
[1:22:57] and they are looking to
[1:23:00] uh build
[1:23:01] up there
[1:23:03] a building there now to house all the
[1:23:05] people
[1:23:06] we praise god for it and be able to
[1:23:08] preach the word of god to them at that
[1:23:11] point in time
[1:23:13] and again the lord blessed them in a
[1:23:15] wonderful way we had a great meeting
[1:23:19] late in the night and we give god glory
[1:23:22] and they rejoice
[1:23:23] singing their way home
[1:23:25] uh those who are the
[1:23:27] few cars they came down that dirt road
[1:23:30] they didn't care how much the car go
[1:23:32] bump
[1:23:34] whatever they came and those who had to
[1:23:36] walk walk walked home and everything
[1:23:39] else but the word was preached
[1:23:42] and i thank god there's a church there
[1:23:45] in the wild woods
[1:23:47] the church there and they're praising
[1:23:50] god
[1:23:51] and every time i see one of these
[1:23:53] churches
[1:23:54] the holy spirit is reminding me all this
[1:23:57] came
[1:23:58] because
[1:24:00] one day
[1:24:01] when you were just a young boy
[1:24:04] those two books came to you
[1:24:07] you don't know anything about this while
[1:24:08] you were in north america all this was
[1:24:10] going on
[1:24:12] and now they are everywhere
[1:24:14] and the denominations are getting mad
[1:24:18] because it's spreading
[1:24:20] praise god
[1:24:21] and even the
[1:24:24] my schoolmate or college mate there is
[1:24:27] now the superintendent
[1:24:29] of the denomination he's saying all
[1:24:31] these young boys coming from nowhere and
[1:24:35] starting up these churches he's getting
[1:24:37] they're getting mad you know but the
[1:24:39] word is spreading praise the lord
[1:24:41] hallelujah praise god satan is sad but
[1:24:45] god is glad
[1:24:48] we're rejoicing in the lord and praising
[1:24:50] him for the great things that he has
[1:24:53] done
[1:24:54] and uh we
[1:24:56] rejoice on that we stayed in a lodge
[1:25:01] maria's lodge is called uh overnight and
[1:25:05] that's not like your nice
[1:25:06] sumptuous hotels you can have here
[1:25:10] you know
[1:25:11] you're safe because this was not
[1:25:14] out in the open you had doors and
[1:25:16] windows but you know you have to deal
[1:25:18] with your mosquitoes your lizards your
[1:25:20] flies and
[1:25:22] stuff
[1:25:23] you got to deal with it you're in that
[1:25:25] situation
[1:25:26] there are not things that will harm you
[1:25:29] you know mosquito nets are there so you
[1:25:32] use them the best you can and what
[1:25:34] you're doing
[1:25:35] missions is not just oh i'm going over
[1:25:38] to michigan
[1:25:40] that's nice you go over there to a hotel
[1:25:42] and you preach and everything else and
[1:25:43] you say you're on a missionary trip
[1:25:45] that's not real missionary trip
[1:25:50] where you can roll to the store and buy
[1:25:51] chocolates and
[1:25:55] right
[1:25:58] but god has given this young man and his
[1:26:01] family
[1:26:02] a vision
[1:26:04] a vision for the country
[1:26:07] a vision for the message
[1:26:10] and as a result
[1:26:12] god allowed him
[1:26:14] to buy a large plot of land
[1:26:18] on the shores
[1:26:20] of what is called a hot and cold lake
[1:26:24] where all the scientists are going there
[1:26:26] now investigating because they don't
[1:26:28] understand why half the lake is hot
[1:26:32] and half is cold
[1:26:34] half is cold water and half is hot
[1:26:37] and they don't know what what is going
[1:26:39] on so they're looking at it
[1:26:41] but
[1:26:42] god allowed him to buy a lot of land
[1:26:45] there
[1:26:46] and
[1:26:48] spent a lot of money a lot of help from
[1:26:50] the believers and they
[1:26:53] uh put up a large
[1:26:55] building
[1:26:57] one level building
[1:27:00] and turned that into a campground
[1:27:04] and there's also a little church
[1:27:06] building
[1:27:07] that is on the site there
[1:27:10] and
[1:27:11] god has blessed it so much
[1:27:14] that brethren are coming from the
[1:27:16] islands
[1:27:18] brother green
[1:27:21] brother for long your brother
[1:27:25] brother mohammed
[1:27:27] and many others even from the united
[1:27:29] states they are going to that place
[1:27:32] that are just about four miles in the
[1:27:34] bush
[1:27:35] and they're having camp meetings
[1:27:38] and believers are even coming from
[1:27:40] brazil from
[1:27:42] africa
[1:27:44] ahem here
[1:27:45] and they're going there and having a
[1:27:47] real camp meeting
[1:27:49] taking their tents
[1:27:52] and putting them on the ground there
[1:27:55] and a brethren that live in those areas
[1:27:59] they patrol in the night and stuff like
[1:28:01] that
[1:28:02] and uh so far everybody's been safe
[1:28:05] nobody's had any problem and they're on
[1:28:07] the shores of the lake and during the
[1:28:09] day they may go boating or fishing or
[1:28:12] whatever it's all there and this is a
[1:28:14] big huge lake that they're on praise god
[1:28:19] so i want to say thank god for this dear
[1:28:21] brother
[1:28:23] and how the lord is using him in a
[1:28:25] wonderful way
[1:28:27] that way and i just say
[1:28:29] praise god i see the same spirit
[1:28:32] that is
[1:28:34] on him
[1:28:35] on me and i thank god for that giving
[1:28:38] him the god the glory and when he was
[1:28:40] driving back
[1:28:41] you know
[1:28:42] you know same thing
[1:28:45] same attitude
[1:28:47] hey hi how you doing over there
[1:28:49] hello what
[1:28:51] you know just the same happy go lucky
[1:28:54] you don't know when god looked in the
[1:28:56] door
[1:28:56] two guys going in down the jungle trail
[1:28:59] to go to work and
[1:29:01] hey how you guys you're going in the
[1:29:02] world yeah you say oh jump in the back
[1:29:05] get in there and they jump in the back
[1:29:06] and then drive them to another little
[1:29:09] trail they have to walk down that and
[1:29:11] let them out there but it's like that
[1:29:13] so everywhere i went around the country
[1:29:17] with him i didn't go to the east
[1:29:19] but this middle part and the western
[1:29:21] part it seems like most everybody knows
[1:29:24] him
[1:29:25] right
[1:29:27] they know him
[1:29:28] and so if create the holy spirit has got
[1:29:31] a great influence
[1:29:33] going on within the country
[1:29:36] for god's glory and that's because of
[1:29:38] the example of his uh family his girls
[1:29:41] right he has one boy and about four
[1:29:44] girls max a matter of fact one of them
[1:29:46] is married and she just gave birth to
[1:29:50] a son just before i left and we give god
[1:29:53] the praise for that and the other ones
[1:29:58] when i left the night we left
[1:30:02] he dropped us off and left us there
[1:30:04] about 10 o'clock in the night
[1:30:06] to wake up
[1:30:08] with another brother
[1:30:10] and to drive with his daughters
[1:30:13] insisting to go with him to drive to go
[1:30:16] to brazil
[1:30:18] and to do that they have to drive
[1:30:22] 300 miles through the jungle
[1:30:26] to get to brazil
[1:30:28] amen
[1:30:29] and you know um
[1:30:31] you know brother brian
[1:30:33] you know you break down in the middle of
[1:30:35] the jungle there is no gas station
[1:30:40] and then you have to think about what is
[1:30:42] around you while you say you're going to
[1:30:44] walk somewhere to go and get help so but
[1:30:48] they they made it through
[1:30:50] i phoned and found out that they made it
[1:30:52] through safely and
[1:30:54] the brother is doing a convention there
[1:30:57] and the young ladies are very useful in
[1:31:00] the youth
[1:31:02] meetings they have up there and
[1:31:05] it's a real blessing
[1:31:07] praise the lord hallelujah oh i wish i
[1:31:10] could have a big plane and air lift you
[1:31:12] all over there for a week or so amen so
[1:31:16] that you could experience and enjoy what
[1:31:19] god is doing praise the lord because it
[1:31:22] changes lives it changes hearts changes
[1:31:25] minds when people actually see
[1:31:28] what god is doing amen and i give god
[1:31:31] the glory so we enjoyed that
[1:31:34] and we came out
[1:31:36] there the next day but not before he
[1:31:39] made sure that we were able to drink
[1:31:41] some
[1:31:42] coconuts how many knows what the coconut
[1:31:45] is
[1:31:47] well no there's
[1:31:48] many people don't know what a coconut is
[1:31:51] but these are fresh water coconuts
[1:31:54] and these brothers are wiser than we
[1:31:57] were because back then we climbed the
[1:32:00] tree to pick the coconuts
[1:32:02] and sometimes when you climb the tree a
[1:32:04] big head comes out
[1:32:08] and then you loose off
[1:32:10] down the tree
[1:32:11] and you end up with the inside of your
[1:32:13] ties all bruised up and bleedy
[1:32:21] nah now they have a long stick with a
[1:32:25] steel curvature where they can just
[1:32:27] reach up
[1:32:29] and cut that thing saw it off and then
[1:32:31] bang the whole bunch falls off i said my
[1:32:35] you brothers got it different you you
[1:32:37] got a new way of doing things but we
[1:32:40] enjoy those coconuts
[1:32:42] not only were they fresh the water in
[1:32:44] them was sweet
[1:32:46] not only was the water sweet it was a
[1:32:48] lot
[1:32:49] and when you cut them up
[1:32:51] then you have the meat that you have to
[1:32:54] eat out of there oh my
[1:32:58] if you don't want some of that now i'm
[1:33:00] not talking about running to the
[1:33:01] supermarket
[1:33:04] those ones won't taste the same
[1:33:06] but we enjoyed them and we drank or
[1:33:09] filled
[1:33:10] and then we made our way
[1:33:12] out for four miles
[1:33:15] made our way out now because of him
[1:33:18] going there you remember brother biscuit
[1:33:20] out in western canada
[1:33:23] how he went
[1:33:24] in the woods
[1:33:26] and built that locked cabin
[1:33:28] and had his church in the log cabin then
[1:33:31] the holy spirit said go into this area
[1:33:34] buy land there
[1:33:36] and build a church there he went into
[1:33:38] that area when it was just bushes and
[1:33:40] nothing and built it what are you doing
[1:33:43] he says god told me to go there and he
[1:33:46] goes there and you know there's a tongue
[1:33:48] there now for and when i see a tongue
[1:33:51] another ramshackle it's got everything
[1:33:53] modern everything built up there now and
[1:33:56] the real estate agents that were kind of
[1:33:58] laughing at him they are they were left
[1:34:01] in amazement and in wonder but that's
[1:34:04] what happens when a man obeys god and
[1:34:06] god's word
[1:34:09] and so
[1:34:11] the government of guyana
[1:34:14] are now
[1:34:16] looking to develop a tourist site
[1:34:21] by the same by the lake but he's already
[1:34:23] there
[1:34:26] he's already there praise god
[1:34:28] and he wants to expand to get even more
[1:34:31] and right now they're hemming and hoing
[1:34:34] and
[1:34:34] stopping trying to block him from
[1:34:37] getting more of the land around there
[1:34:40] because now they get an idea and they
[1:34:42] get their thoughts
[1:34:44] and without any development anything
[1:34:47] there they're starting to charge people
[1:34:49] fees
[1:34:50] to go through all those woods and to go
[1:34:53] in there to this hot and cold lake and
[1:34:56] believe you me
[1:34:57] eco tourists are going there
[1:35:00] they're going it with their backpacks
[1:35:03] and everything else they're going in
[1:35:05] so
[1:35:06] i'm saying god gives that young man
[1:35:08] great vision amen
[1:35:11] and he's using him in a wonderful way
[1:35:13] and i want to support that
[1:35:16] and i want you to want to support that
[1:35:19] praise god
[1:35:21] and i'm going to start doing that i
[1:35:23] haven't told him this he didn't ask me
[1:35:25] for anything
[1:35:27] he didn't even hit about nothing
[1:35:29] because he believes
[1:35:31] that you have faith in god god will make
[1:35:34] a way somehow
[1:35:36] and god has been making a way
[1:35:38] praise the lord and just to let you know
[1:35:42] also personally
[1:35:44] he's not exactly poor
[1:35:46] right
[1:35:47] uh he is reasonably well off
[1:35:51] and well taken care of so um it's not uh
[1:35:56] because god would let some preachers be
[1:35:59] just normal and don't hardly have
[1:36:00] anything and others he'd allow them to
[1:36:02] prosper and
[1:36:04] and i believe he's one that god has
[1:36:06] allowed the prosper
[1:36:07] praise god amen and god god bless him in
[1:36:11] every way but i am going to
[1:36:15] support
[1:36:16] what he's doing
[1:36:17] and it's not just what he's doing is my
[1:36:20] work
[1:36:20] that is going on there still
[1:36:23] i am not there anymore because god
[1:36:24] didn't want him to be in my mold
[1:36:27] just like he told me with another
[1:36:30] preacher are you going to every seed
[1:36:32] bring forth after the sky and are you
[1:36:34] going to be his kind or mine
[1:36:36] and i had to say yes lord
[1:36:38] so it's the same thing he did but i
[1:36:40] didn't know
[1:36:42] he didn't want them
[1:36:44] to be after my kind
[1:36:47] but after his kind
[1:36:49] of the word
[1:36:51] so
[1:36:52] great work is still being done
[1:36:54] and it's going on still at the present
[1:36:57] time and i believe these brothers and
[1:37:00] trinidad
[1:37:01] recognize it
[1:37:03] and that's why
[1:37:04] they do a lot of fellowship with that
[1:37:06] brother
[1:37:08] for instance brother greene went to
[1:37:10] england
[1:37:11] and who does he left leave he called the
[1:37:14] brother from guyana to go over there and
[1:37:17] take his church
[1:37:18] and stay there until he comes back
[1:37:20] praise the lord so that's the kind of
[1:37:23] confidence that they have in that dear
[1:37:26] brother and we praise god so let's do
[1:37:29] what we can
[1:37:30] to carry along the work because they're
[1:37:33] churches to be built
[1:37:34] they're there but they don't have any
[1:37:37] they have a building in the sense that
[1:37:38] they have a roof over them and a few
[1:37:40] sticks or and
[1:37:42] tins and stuff like that and uh but we
[1:37:45] will do what we can for the glory of god
[1:37:48] hallelujah so i enjoyed this equivalent
[1:37:52] and then coming back
[1:37:54] we crossed the asakubo river and when we
[1:37:57] came back to demerara which is the
[1:38:00] middle province like of the country
[1:38:03] he said oh let's stop into brother
[1:38:05] kusanat
[1:38:07] and we stopped him there
[1:38:09] and lo and behold
[1:38:12] when i was young i preached in that
[1:38:15] village parika
[1:38:17] and people were converted and a
[1:38:19] little group was there
[1:38:22] and i never i left i don't know what
[1:38:24] ever happened to it but
[1:38:26] thanks be to god there is a message
[1:38:29] church right there right now
[1:38:32] and there is a solid pastor right there
[1:38:35] right now
[1:38:37] and he's also a
[1:38:39] businessman he's a big businessman and
[1:38:42] he is there and thanks be to god
[1:38:45] the church is coming along in a
[1:38:48] wonderful precious way
[1:38:50] and we give god glory because you see i
[1:38:53] just kind of take a quick review of what
[1:38:56] was going on there so if i go back then
[1:38:58] i know i can go and preach here i can
[1:39:01] preach there i can preach there i can
[1:39:02] breach there and bridge there and they
[1:39:04] need me there then i can go there like
[1:39:07] this one church the pastor is dead they
[1:39:09] don't know what to do
[1:39:10] and so on like that you know
[1:39:12] i don't know if whether to speak with
[1:39:14] them over zoom or if they need for me to
[1:39:17] go whatever the case
[1:39:19] i am in god's hand for his glory
[1:39:23] and that
[1:39:24] is a wonderful wonderful thing to know
[1:39:28] so we came back
[1:39:29] to the capitol
[1:39:31] and there in the capital of course
[1:39:34] you're not going to begrudge me a day
[1:39:36] off
[1:39:39] because uh
[1:39:41] sister simon's um
[1:39:43] nieces
[1:39:45] and a brother she has over there
[1:39:48] one brother left there over there
[1:39:51] uh they all came to see her and want to
[1:39:54] take her out and
[1:39:56] i said okay you go ahead and i went with
[1:39:59] the brother and i went to the mall
[1:40:02] and thank god again
[1:40:04] god they they used trinidadian engineers
[1:40:08] because trinidad had a lot of big malls
[1:40:11] that they
[1:40:12] so they brought them over and they built
[1:40:14] a few malls over there and i went to see
[1:40:17] what it was about
[1:40:18] and um
[1:40:20] you know it's not up to our standards
[1:40:22] but it's wonderful wonderful
[1:40:25] huge food courts
[1:40:27] with uh local fare and everything you
[1:40:30] have here too because in your
[1:40:33] kfc and popeye and the swim bees and
[1:40:38] pizza pizza and whatnot it's there you
[1:40:41] know it's a city so they're pulling in
[1:40:43] all these companies are looking to rush
[1:40:46] in and to set down themselves there so
[1:40:49] there and the dressing of the people
[1:40:51] when i left there
[1:40:53] no women wore pants
[1:40:57] you will look dung upon if you wear a
[1:40:59] pair of pants
[1:41:00] i go back
[1:41:02] and the society dresses no different
[1:41:04] than here
[1:41:06] all the modern stuff you got on they got
[1:41:10] it
[1:41:12] all the cars you drive here they got it
[1:41:17] from the low end ones right up to the
[1:41:20] jaguars and the audis and the lexus and
[1:41:23] the rovers and the
[1:41:25] highlanders and whatever they got it
[1:41:28] right
[1:41:29] and they're dressing the same with the
[1:41:32] caps and the this and the that and
[1:41:35] sneakers and the you know
[1:41:38] all the same thing
[1:41:40] it's gone
[1:41:41] in the sense that sin the wave of sin
[1:41:44] the prophet spoke of is across the world
[1:41:46] and it's touching everywhere
[1:41:48] and i need this gospel this all-time
[1:41:51] gospel that we are here preaching praise
[1:41:54] the name of the lord glory to god and
[1:41:57] for myself
[1:41:59] um
[1:42:00] i
[1:42:01] i'll have to go back i guess visit them
[1:42:05] i visited
[1:42:06] at the last minute on the saturday i
[1:42:08] found out that
[1:42:10] a grand niece of mine a cousin of mine
[1:42:13] her daughter
[1:42:15] um she had just a little
[1:42:18] let's say a stall we call it by the side
[1:42:21] of the road
[1:42:22] and to my surprise
[1:42:25] when i heard about them i said let me go
[1:42:27] visit them i'm thinking i'm going back
[1:42:29] to a little stall
[1:42:31] those girls develop that until they have
[1:42:33] two stores
[1:42:37] and she said oh but these ones are small
[1:42:40] but i have a large one
[1:42:43] on the other side of the river
[1:42:46] from that little stall from that little
[1:42:49] lady
[1:42:50] wanted to do something with her life
[1:42:53] these two girls were able to develop
[1:42:55] free stores
[1:42:56] and i want to give god praise honor and
[1:42:58] glory
[1:43:00] [Applause]
[1:43:03] amen
[1:43:04] well we had to we took the last day
[1:43:09] to pack and prepare to leave and
[1:43:12] i'm leaving out something important but
[1:43:14] i won't tell you about that we went to
[1:43:16] one of the large chinese restaurants in
[1:43:20] the city there
[1:43:22] and it's um when i say it's large it's
[1:43:24] huge
[1:43:26] um
[1:43:27] and we had a wonderful time in there
[1:43:29] with all the wonderful chinese
[1:43:31] delicacies
[1:43:33] and stuff of that nature in there we
[1:43:35] enjoyed that so much
[1:43:37] we give god the praise honor and glory
[1:43:40] so we spent the last day
[1:43:42] preparing to leave
[1:43:44] packing and stuff like that
[1:43:46] and then
[1:43:48] um
[1:43:49] you know
[1:43:51] next day was sunday
[1:43:52] saturday we made sure that we prepared
[1:43:55] and i'm i'm wrapping this up now
[1:43:59] so that when we go to the service
[1:44:01] we preach the word
[1:44:04] we already signed out from the hotel
[1:44:08] so we can't go back there
[1:44:10] unless you want to go paying marriott
[1:44:12] fees
[1:44:14] but uh
[1:44:15] we went to brother maxi's home
[1:44:18] and there we are able to you know shower
[1:44:22] change and prepare for the night but
[1:44:25] since
[1:44:26] service the ser he starts service at
[1:44:28] nine o'clock in the morning on sunday
[1:44:31] so by by um
[1:44:33] let's say 11 o'clock or midday
[1:44:36] services ended
[1:44:38] so we have midday and we were leaving at
[1:44:40] about
[1:44:41] um
[1:44:42] nine o'clock in the night
[1:44:45] so we had the rest of the day so we had
[1:44:47] time to have lunch with them again
[1:44:49] fellowship with them again
[1:44:52] have a little rest and stuff like that
[1:44:55] and then
[1:44:56] he took us
[1:44:58] to
[1:44:59] um
[1:45:00] to the airport and we were off
[1:45:04] and then he came home
[1:45:06] and
[1:45:07] packed his bags
[1:45:09] jumped in his vehicle
[1:45:11] 4 30 the next morning
[1:45:13] drove for 300 miles
[1:45:16] with his four girls and a brother
[1:45:19] that's driving
[1:45:21] with them
[1:45:23] and went into brazil where they still
[1:45:25] are now
[1:45:26] ministering by the grace of god
[1:45:30] and i think that's a tribute
[1:45:32] to the work god is doing in that country
[1:45:34] and now
[1:45:36] i want to repeat what i've always said
[1:45:38] god is up to something big
[1:45:44] hallelujah god is up to something big
[1:45:47] and i want to be a part of it
[1:45:50] he wants us to be york fellows fellow
[1:45:53] laborers carrying the gospel of jesus
[1:45:56] christ
[1:45:57] god bless you all
[1:45:58] i trust that somehow you've drawn
[1:46:00] something from what you heard by the
[1:46:02] grace of god of course i told them about
[1:46:04] the appearance of the pillar of fire
[1:46:06] amen praise the lord how in that old
[1:46:10] garage one night we are sad and worried
[1:46:13] about what's gonna happen and you know
[1:46:16] you know we don't know about no message
[1:46:18] we never thought i never thought i would
[1:46:20] be out here we don't know what's going
[1:46:21] on he never heard of any such a thing
[1:46:24] but then there came the light
[1:46:27] out of the bushes
[1:46:28] moving
[1:46:29] and i explained to them i would move
[1:46:32] like that
[1:46:33] right in front of us when i say in front
[1:46:35] of us
[1:46:37] it was just
[1:46:39] like about four feet away
[1:46:42] as moving slow
[1:46:44] like that
[1:46:47] and then it started going up a bit
[1:46:50] and i had enough time to run
[1:46:52] and knock on the door of my aunt's house
[1:46:56] at around midnight because we were out
[1:46:58] there talking on the word and just
[1:47:00] enjoying the presence of the lord
[1:47:03] and they weren't in the message
[1:47:07] and i said
[1:47:08] i don't want us to imagine
[1:47:11] so i'm going to call them and if they
[1:47:13] can see it then it's real it's not a
[1:47:15] makeup
[1:47:17] and knocked on the door and they came
[1:47:18] out and then it said why are you waking
[1:47:21] us up what's that boy what is that boy
[1:47:24] what what's what's that i said well
[1:47:27] i wanted to know if you can see it
[1:47:30] and they could see it
[1:47:32] and when he
[1:47:34] or it was sure it suddenly went from
[1:47:38] that slow moving
[1:47:40] and went up in the heavens and they were
[1:47:42] left staring in amazement of what took
[1:47:45] place so i explained all of that to them
[1:47:48] explain to them how the prayer meeting
[1:47:50] on in in uh in a certain area there and
[1:47:54] the clouds come down and we're hanging
[1:47:58] there and the fire engines and
[1:47:59] everything i think the place is on fire
[1:48:01] and they come to out but it wasn't it
[1:48:04] was the holy spirit
[1:48:06] in divine power and presence just doing
[1:48:09] that so i explained to them
[1:48:12] these things that god vindicated and
[1:48:15] confirmed and still is confirming the
[1:48:18] message for this hour
[1:48:20] but
[1:48:21] i said brothers
[1:48:24] god is using you guys in a different way
[1:48:27] but you see men like myself and these
[1:48:29] other older brothers god used us as
[1:48:32] bulldozers they started laughing
[1:48:36] i said yeah because a lot of rough old
[1:48:39] trees were clogging up the forest where
[1:48:43] he wants to plant his seed so he used us
[1:48:46] to rip them out tear them down and cast
[1:48:48] them out
[1:48:51] amen
[1:48:52] but now he's using you guys like
[1:48:55] surgeons
[1:48:57] you guys are now playing men that can
[1:49:00] play in a piece of board and make it
[1:49:02] smooth
[1:49:03] you know and using you in a different
[1:49:05] way
[1:49:06] so i said just press on let god continue
[1:49:09] to use you amen we thank god for this
[1:49:12] heavenly father we thank you for these
[1:49:14] few words we shared with the brethren
[1:49:18] and lord it may appear as if it's
[1:49:20] not much nothing
[1:49:22] but lord
[1:49:23] for them to know
[1:49:25] the the sense of fulfillment
