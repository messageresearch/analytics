Christ amen praise the Lord glory to God we're so happy to be here tonight we're so happy to be here a part of this wonderful uh weekend of Celebration amen we are all Witnesses here tonight I want you to know that we are witnesses here tonight of the many visions and the and the one Clear Vision that Pastor John Simon and sister Desiree had many many years ago hallelujah amen you are witnesses and we are the beneficiaries praise God Amen he held to certain vision and what God showed him he stood fast upon it many times I've been you know I've been at Pastor Simon's side now for 30 years and I have witnessed Supernatural Beyond I could I could sit here and give testimony all night to how the power of God has moved through this ministry I heard things that were spoken from his lips and it pondered and it made me wonder when he would say things like we will have a building worth millions of dollars one day and today we sit in that very manifestation of the word of God at that time we couldn't see how but one thing that I knew was that we were serving a living God and that man and that woman had connected with the Living God and had found their purpose their plan and their will that God's will for their lives and I'm just so glad to be a part of it amen and I know that many of you have benefited from the visions and from the steadfast he stood against every enemy it didn't matter what they said he held to the word and the vision that God had given him amen praise God and so here we are at this time uh rejoicing and I I believe that yes it is a celebration but it's not a celebration of of retirement no sir this is a celebration of achievement amen glory to God when you stand with God God will stand with you and God will lift you up amen God will show and vindicate his word praise God so tonight and this weekend I want you to enjoy the atmosphere because I'm telling you if you were here last night you are probably still in that atmosphere praise God brother Isaiah brought a message from the Lord and it was such a blessing the atmosphere was so wonderful you could have received anything in that atmosphere but it's according to your faith amen praise God and so we are going to continue tonight we're going to continue in that atmosphere we're going to let the Holy Spirit speak to us and reveal his thoughts and his desires for us for this weekend and like I

have on your heart amen praise the Lord good evening um it's good to be here uh today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ um just a few minutes just to um congratulate you on this function that you have uh assembled uh so that you can celebrate man that has dedicated his life uh and his wife and to to serving uh the one and the true God um I have been fortunate uh to know him from teenage years um we kind of grew up together um he was around I think 15 years old when he started his teenage Ministry and I was about 11 12 years old and one day well himself and his sidekick by the name of Michael Patterson um you know they started this ministry uh at the street street corners and uh they were uh preaching there for the Assemblies of God at the time and these two fire Brands were um the Pioneers so to speak uh for the Street Ministry uh for uh Assemblies of God so one Saturday evening at that's the time that they would go out there at pit and Main Street and they would speak there and preach to the crowd that are passing by so one day uh one Saturday night I was passing about 11 years 12 years old with a friend and decided to stop and listen to this uh Teenage preacher and uh was captivated by the things that he was saying about God and and um I can still hear the words that he spoke that night and um as he was speaking and I asked made the altar call and raised my hand and I had my elbow rested on my friend's shoulder like that and I can still hear him say there is one uh raised his hand resting on the backbone of man you know so uh so from that night you know he invited me to the Assemblies of God Church I was a uh um Anglican uh I used to go to the Anglican Church the Anglican school at that time so went to the Assembly of God joined there and um for many years was there um I'll try to prey this uh conversation and uh long story short as they would say brought me into um knowing Jesus Christ as my personal savior at that time and after I was attending the Assemblies of God I um uh became a member there and he left to go down to the capital and was there in Bible school and uh that's where he met um brother R Jerry R if you many of you can remember him and he brought that message across to Guyana and um well after he started that he had his church on the west coast where he met his wife um and then he came back over to New Amsterdam to talk to his parents about himself getting married that's where he met me on the fairy Stelling because I was a porter at the time at the H the post office used to go and pick up meals so he met me there and I asked him I said what is this thing that I heard about you man that you left the church and uh you know know that you're preaching this false Doctrine so I uh so he said um you know this is what it is he said you know about the godhead they said yes I know God is tree and you know he's Father Son and Holy Ghost and um but you're you're talking about this one God and I don't understand that so he sat down there and uh right there on the fairy stilling me waiting for the males and explained the godhe to me I said but that is what I thought you believed anyway again long story short um I believe what he said um left the Assembly of God uh came back into the service that that Sunday because they heard that I had associated with him now and believe what he said so I purposely went to church to be read out you know cuz at that time you know they would really out the church so I purposely went there to read out the church so I was as the pastor was reading me out of the church I was smiling and happy as a clam as he would say you know left there and I think um at the time I was living with some friends and um that that situation wasn't good so when he came over I told him you know I'm looking for a place to get so he said uh come uh you know and he said my my my uh parents have you know their what we call bottom house house and they had a little structure under the house so it took me there to live with uh under that place and uh with his parents whom I came to know very well and his brothers became my brothers and we used to romp and play and fight you know just like real family and um but uh I had the honor of um burying both hisence uh when the time came um but uh you know he has been instrumental in my life after the time he left Guyana and came here um we connected back reconnected back after what 10 15 years about that at the convention in North Carolina and um from since then we've been in contact and uh here we are today so God bless you and um I want to thank him for the dedication that he has shown uh regardless of the trials and the tribulations that have been gone that he gone through while here but in any um message beli or any um any Minister that goes through these type of traumas and so forth in your church you know it only makes you stronger if you're true to the word so these challenges will come and you have faced many of them um with his leadership and I see how resilient uh you have been and it's a testimony tonight for what uh you know you have done in in the uh changing over of the Guard um and uh you know and for acknowledging the work that they have put in here for these what 30 or 40 years uh that they have um stood fast in this Pulpit so may the Lord continue to bless you and um continue to guide you as uh the guards have changed but um still remain in contact with the old guard amen so God bless you again and uh may the Lord uh give us a great time tonight God bless you thank you very amen praise God isn't that wonderful I certainly appreciated that testimony I didn't know that I didn't know that he was one of his first converts and here he was at 15 16 years old the anointing was all over him not realizing and it was pulling the Sons and Daughters of God into to their rightful positions amen praise God I want to thank God for brother Hutchinson and his wife God bless you welcome tonight amen and so now we're going to be going to the word but just before we do that I just like to say something um tomorrow night we have a uh dinner celebration and this dinner celebration was established and set up as an invitation um only celebration and dinner and uh so we do apologize if there's anybody that you know that may not uh be on the roster for the celebration dinner but we are happy that you're here

about 10 years ago or so that I first met brother George Smith I picked him up and took him to uh his hotel and it was the first time that I'd met him in person and I fell in love with him immediately I didn't understand why but I just I I I knew that there was that connection and that connection was even uh you know really confirmed here just being with him the last few days he's he's just a

me with [Music] he Lov me I knew him and all my love is through him he PL me to [Music] Victory Hallelujah amen thank you ladies make let's take our Bible please and turn into First Corinthians beautiful music tonight if you can't preach after that go back to Episcopalian Church 1 Corinthians chapter three we're going to start at verse 5 who then is Paul who is who is Apollos but ministers by whom you believe even as the lord gave to every man I have planted Apollo's watered God gave the increase so then there is he that planteth or neither he that WTH but God that gives the increase now he that planteth and he that WTH are one other words The Same Spirit and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor for we are labors together together with God and you all are God's husbandry you are God's Building according to the grace which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another builds thereon but be very careful how he builds there on for other Foundation can no man laid than that is laid which is Jesus Christ turn over a few pages to Ephesians chapter 4 one of our well all these are our favorite verses we're not going to distinguish Ephesians 4:11 says and he that's God gave some Apostles others prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers what for for arguing I heard this and you're wrong and I'm right and you're not going no no for the perfecting of the Saints now in the Catholic Church how many people were catholic let's see your hand be honest yeah the Saints are on the other side according to them but this says perfecting of the Saints we're still here perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ and one other back to the left to Galatians this is a key verse that everybody should know by heart but this is where Paul had been in this area and had success and baptized a few people and he comes back a few months later and these people are already drifting listening to some other stuff and he says in verse 6 I Marvel that you're so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another people but there be some people among you that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ everything off the center line is a perversion amen and that's why why tonight we have our level with us anything on the sides of perversion we got to stick with the truth pervert the gospel of Christ but though we if me and Silas if John Simon William brandham anybody comes by or even an angel pops out of Heaven preaches any other gospel unto you than that which I've already preached to you by Revelation let him be a cursed that's straight to the hot place it's a one-way trip you see we don't like to make you wonder what I'm saying and he says again you know in case nobody was paying attention as we just said so say again if any man preach any of the Gospel unto you that when we have received let him be a cursed Heavenly Father we're thankful for your grace tonight we're thankful Lord that you brought each one of us from many places to be in one place and one Accord we pray that your spirit may come and anoint your word now tonight Lord we ask for brother marcil's father you see the need there is there the needs out west the needs in South America that needs in many places Lord bless your people tonight bless the word now help us in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated brother Dan is it just me or is a little warm up here today while we were busy with a lovely breakfast we thank people here the angels of God swoop down into Germany and gently escorted a dear Saint to Glory an old soldier who took this story this old story to many countries languages he was 90 years old brother you all Frank is crossed over he was a good friend and we didn't agree on everything but that's not important this was the man that carried the gospel to more places than you can imagine but uh his race is over now I talked to his I sent a message to his son and U they're they were expecting this it was it was coming I know some of you especially ones from Africa have either your parents or someone has had contact and thankful that God sent him when he did so tonight we're going to speak on a subject Christians in progress see that picture up there you're in that picture so if you want to concentrate find yourself in that picture now whoever Dre the picture didn't know the message too well because there's not you don't see too many long-haired ladies there but that's where we're HD it amen now God has sent us a prophet we don't have to argue about that and he came not because he you know God didn't have anything better to do no he sent him in fulfillment of scripture amen amen and um The Promise was made by a prophet 400 years before Jesus ever showed up way back there behold send you most of us believe and are convinced that William bram's Ministry fulfilled those verses okay especially the second part of the prophecy spoken over 2400 years ago and then we have the very words of Jesus over here in Matthew chapter 17 you want to keep your Bible handy because we're going to have basically a Sunday school lesson today but in chapter 17 of Matthew Jesus been up on the mountain they saw Moses and Elijah and so they're coming down from the mountain and Peter of course he was always you know a promoter wanted to see things done right and everything and he wanted to build three Tabernacles and as they came down in verse 9 Jesus said now don't tell this Vision to anybody until the son of man is risen again from the dead so this is one of the many hints he gave them this isn't going to be nice and even the whole time son of man's going to be killed raised again he told them that many times they were a little bit thickheaded they weren't catching at all and his disciples asked him why then do the scribes say that Elias or Elijah must first come the Jews are taught from the crib up about Elijah they know Elijah is on the way okay and they've been teaching that and so Jesus said and them Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things future tense anybody can read that so if our friends that are out there you know watching TV and drinking whatever they're doing and they used to be sitting in the church if William Brand's Ministry doesn't fit this verse of Malachi Jesus himself said he's coming so guys instead of throwing rocks at our message go find him cuz he's coming like our brother said last night there's not much time better hurry so we're convinced that it is but you see we have an English Bible and we're thankful for it and I hope everybody's reading their Bible I hope some of you even have a scoffield Bible but you see the scoffield Bible is simply the fact that ski I think he was a lawyer but then he got to read he was reading the scripture he thought now there's got to be a way of of you know putting this together so he made all these notes all the references you see in the middle all the notes at the bottom all that was finished on January 1 1909 okay no computers pencil and paper and a few helpers okay so um this Bible is a true Masterpiece and when he studied here in Matthew 17 he wrote down here at the bottom these scriptures you can go read them later all these passages must be construed together Christ conf confirms the specific and still unfulfilled prophecy of Malachi 4:5 and6 why didn't I see that when I was 17 years old in the Baptist churchan it's been there all the time ever since 1909 W he he saw that there's two Ministries there it just takes some discernment you know so this Bible is a true Masterpiece it's given by one author okay to 40 writers now if we take 40 people out of these first benches here and give them an assignment they're not going to match I mean we're smart enough to know that but these 40 writers lived in three different continents spoke three languages didn't know each other mindly and it's over 1500 years and none of it fights each other it's all God's word it's real okay and there's no contradictions and so now that we have computers they've you know got a lot smarter because progress you know and um now we know that there's 63,360 cross references says here oh it matches this over here nobody can write a book like that this is God's word and our Prophet said that this is God in written form form he also said you don't put anything I hope I don't see anything on top of your Bible not even my books he said so watch it okay just laying a foundation here preparing for tomorrow's service we'll leave you a little bit so this prophet he brought us a prophetic word here in Lea to prepare a bride for Jesus Christ okay and it's in our language people that speak English have no excuse whatsoever now the other countries they depend on translation and over 200 times he said back to the Bible because the original promise was I'm going to send you Elijah he going to turn your hearts back well is going to turn your hearts back to this and this has only been in print for just over 500 years we're very fortunate you know so his words spoken on over 1,200 recordings um when they're repeated correctly or translated correctly can only hurt the unbeliever and the MB believer that's the ones that go to sleep that's the ones got to take three drinks of water and all that but the believer wants more you see and so uh these are the ones that are not going in the Rapture obviously so we're dealing with three kinds of Believers and I didn't make up the rules but brother Ram said that there's three kinds of Believers in every congregation that's very easy for you to sit there and you're you know North American judgmental way just like me and decide who is the believer and who's the unbeliever that's not important who are you okay exactly so um there is an order there's a progression remember Christians in progress even Peter said over here let go to Second Peter chapter 1 a very important scripture it's right before Hebrews I think here or right after Hebrews I'm sorry um where that um where we at here in First Peter second Peter chapter 1 where he says over here in verse 15 moreover Brethren I will endeavor I'm going to do my best that after I'm gone you might have these things always in remembrance so he's writing down his message that they can have and we can have it to still today you see why for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his ministry yes so we've read those words quickly we've read them for years but guess what you have lived long enough to see the Fulfillment of the prophet's prophecy amen yes sir we today have have people among us I knew these people I ate with them I traveled with them they have devised these cunningly devised fables stuff that's not even true they make it up it's insane so we have to put up with that stuff okay so this prophet and his ministry they are a vital part of you know Ephesians 4:11 and 12 and there's Harmony between the five Ministries amen the prophet is in perfect harmony with the scripture because brother Brown's Ministry is the Amplified version of the Bible yes it and anybody that calls your a preacher Works in that same anointing that same Unity we don't have the Bible saying one thing and way over here that's what the man in Rome does and some of those people in Salt Lake they got the same Bible we have amen but they're not repeating it correctly they bring stuff out is not even true so the five Ministries work together there's Unity okay and so uh God gives us these five Ministries for our spiritual health our spiritual diet to stay balanced if anybody even thinks about going to sleep you'll hear that again I might leave it here I can buy another one sometimes I got a big one so let's move ahead here but our foundation is Galatians 1:8 he is the master builder now you can spend the rest of your life criticizing Paul and how sorry he was and how he killed grandma and all these things he did as a bad boy but God's grace can reach anybody it doesn't matter where you come from what you did if he can save Paul you can save anybody they made a movie a few years ago Paul Apostle Jesus Christ I was driving by the theater and said wow Paul that's interesting got up close wow Apostle so I went in and saw the movie yeah there's only five people in this whole theater I don't know how they got inspired to make the movie I took some other people in the had never been in a theater while they look see fun they come out crying because it's reality the scriptures coming alive brother BR says The Minister's job is to make Christ real to the people that's our job you know okay so the only worldwide Ministry for the Bride of Jesus Christ is the ministry of William Brandon nobody else that's that's what feeds the bride he was fully Vindicated and we're feeding on the Vindicated word that the god brings the blessing it's just that simple okay so God has a plan he's in charge of all the details not just today all the way to the end he knew you'd be here he knew what kind of shirt you was going to be wearing he he knows all this stuff so what you worried about he's going to make it work out you see so in charge of all the details and he's a god of precision you see now this this level probably cost me $10 and it's it's good enough but there's a man over there in the other side of Canada on St John's he works in some kind of Big Industry he says now the levels we have we don't slam those around cuz they cost $5,000 now that's Precision you see and so if you look at nature you know the Moon is is coming up later uh I think it's 12 days until it's a full moon again of course it's cloudy here you probably never hardly ever see the moon but every 28 days it's right there same size Precision you see and on April 8th some of you probably saw the eclipse I was in the path sure enough here it comes 2:30 3:00 in the afternoon it's all sunny I can see the stars amazing and they knew that they they predicted that way back there because it's precise you see and so the the orbits were crossing and so perfectly synchronized you know to the hour the minute the second to the microsc you know what a microsc is we we have the you know the clock we see the minutes we see the the seconds ticking but then when you take that second and you divide it into millions that's six zeros that's a microc and if you divide it into um nine zeros that's a billion that's a nanc and so we have science today that that they can do that kind of stuff God is that precise okay so God's Pro program is progressing now what I have right here you probably never r youve never seen this before this is a old old record very old there's metal in the middle plastic out here and when you buy this the man that bought it it's slick there's nothing on it so the machine you put the needle here and it spins out here and you got 5 and a half minutes you got to turn it over real quick you got another five and a half minutes here so this is one of 22 records a set that is the first message recorded of William Brandon W April the 12th 1947 faith is the substance this is one of the set I just brought to show you then later uh they got into the 7in recordings that most of you are familiar with and this is this is tape you know but it comes in two hours comes in three hours which means that you play for 30 minutes and you got to turn over and play the other 30 minutes of course every time they turn it over like that when they're recording they miss a few words you know and then there's a 90 minute which uh a 3H hour which is 90 minutes on each side well anyway brother Brandon you know realized hey you know I'm I'm very long- winded he said I want you boys to to help me out here so what they did they edited some of the messages now some of them are are just right this is in tement from 1957 now you remember the 45s that we used to buy like the old I bought some too I was young at one time now see what what a lot of you don't understand me and Reverend John are the exactly the same age yeah our mothers were happy at the same month but these are little records I think it's a set of 37 and it's it's uh I think it's 30 minutes on one side 30 minutes plays at 16 RPM so it's just some of the history of the things that God has permitted that you know we have in the progress so um this um this word is only for serious Believers I'm not an Entertainer it's just come to speak the things that God put on my heart you see and so it's only for serious Believers this is not another religion you going everybody had to drive did anybody walk to church today yes no everybody drove so you came by many churches and those are religions those are perversions of the truth I mean I'm sorry but they they chose that route we didn't send them there and so um the um what we're following is God's word so when you when you run into a new person don't try to make him understand marriage and divorce don't try to make him understand what happened in the garden no that that's later first they got to come to scripture there's five comings of Elijah you know I've been to Israel many times and we never go to convert the Jews that's foolishness you know they are the people of the book they they know what their book says and so one time I was there and U I had one group finished on like Thursday the next group's going to show up on Monday so I stayed over and just you know sat on the beach and walked around well the guide we had do we have a time limit tonight sandwiches are ready right okay so the guide we had he was an older fellow about N9 years older than me he was retired but he loved his job guiding and he had some other retired people that he fellowshipped with so one day he says he go come with me we're going to go see these other retired people well some of these people are very intelligent and so we're in this house and the brother had a he had the the fellow we're visiting had a huge Library I mean just all kinds of books and so we're sitting there fellowshipping and I'm just listening because they're all talking Hebrew and so one of the ladies said now we understand or said Ruben is told us that your father-in-law is a prophet now can you tell us about that well now that you asked I said now surely in all these books you've got a Hebrew New Testament oh right here so they grabbed it out so we went to Matthew 17 and a few other places and I sat now look in your studies you all know that Elijah is coming oh yeah so there's five comings well they never heard of that you Elijah and Elisha and then here's John the Baptist which is in Malachi 3 and we have one in Malachi 4 well they didn't know about that I said out of these five four is coming to you and one came to us oh really when's ours coming I don't know but any Jew that you talk to today that's serious they know the messiah's almost here yeah any day but first we're going to see Elijah Elijah will be two steps in front of him or right next to him but first we'll see Elijah see we didn't know that but so God has been merciful to us he sent us Elijah and the whole purpose was to bring us back to the original okay so I'm only a witness of the truth and I'm here to hold up the miror of the word so that you can see yourself now I've been in homes where you know the mirror is about here well it's kind of hard to comb your hair when the mirror's down here you know you like to look in the mirror don't you yeah and so this mirror doesn't need cleaning it's already clean it's perfect we just got to get it in the right position so you can see yourself you see that's our job and um we uh we want to see that God is working with you God knows what his program is and we want to see what needs fixing for all of us in order to come to the stature of perfect man now um Hebrews 138 is preceded by three Hebrews 13:7 see it goes together in my Bible and some Bibles it's got a semicolon there so those who brought the word to you Jesus Christ is you saw Jesus Christ the same yesterday to ever in whoever taught you and that should carry on we are the Hebrews 138 today you see that's not just brother R that's us today you know now in the beginning of the book um God met Moses and had him write the five books right pent talk we call it the five books of Moses and the Jews they meet every Saturday morning just like they did today over here someplace and all over the world and they have a portion of Moses that they read They're faithful to the text and they go on about their their worship and so he wrote the first five books and the Ten Commandments the law all by Revelation at the um end of the book God provided through John the Revelator the written word for the end of the world and Beyond that's why it says over here in r in Revelation 1 1 through3 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must surely come to pass and he sent and signify it by his Angel to his servant John Who Bore witness uh bore record of the word of God of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand amen this thing is about over amen this isn't going to go on and on and on it's it's got a it's got a point Okay so we got the in the front of the book we got Moses the back of the book we got John the Revelator but in the middle of the book The Bible says and the word became flesh and dwelt amongst us they never had it before but that was what happened there in the middle of the book okay and so that was something very special and it was prophesied by prophets throughout the Old Testament and being prophetic words they had to have a fulfillment centuries later 400 after the last uh Prophet but centuries later most people had forgotten most people couldn't read you know they had this Hebrew Bible only the priests could read it and so all these years later all those prophecies came to pass in a very small cave in a little village south of Jerusalem in Bethlehem MH which by interpretation is the house of God's bread so in Christ God was manifested entirely fullness of the godhead bodily now we're going to say things that you've already heard before maybe not in this order and I'm not going to go out there and debate with you just listen okay it's all in there okay so when we surrender and we're converted and Born Again of the spirit of God and then recognize our position in the body of Christ we are God manifested In the Flesh okay but by measure each one of us according to God's Amazing Grace it's like the ocean you know the entire ocean is anywhere from three and a half to 4% salt well Christ was the ocean we are a part of that okay and um some have a spoonful some have cup so forth brother Ram preaches he says now we in Christian church we have pennies we get nickels and dimes and quarters and half dollars and silver dollars it depends dep on how much you give how much you surrender that's why brother rand's Ministry was so great he surrendered all you know and um so Genesis 8:22 says After the flood you know God said while the Earth remaineth seed time and harvest cold and heat summer and winter dry uh what say and day and night shall not cease so there is an order there's a progress this man works with plants he sees the changes all the time you know and we see that Ecclesiastes 3 to everything there's a season and a time to every purpose under Heaven amen this is the time to sit and listen after a while the Lord tears we'll have something to eat after a while we're going to sleep so there's a time for each thing you see time to be born a time to die time to plant time to pluck up that which is planted so Christians in progress Christians are not perfect hate to tell you that but I had some grandchildren too my baby grandchild is about 63 now he's in Peru tonight but um when those little babies are born oh they're just so precious there's not another one in the whole Hospital you go down to the hospital and if you don't have one if you're just walking through well they all look the same you let's face it there's there's not a lot of characteristics but every grandparent you know but but um there's no Christians that are perfect but we are forgiven and we learn how to forgive you see so we're not here for anything less than to find out how to move forward how to get out of leosa suicide is not an option God will take you when he's ready for it he's not ready for you yet your mansion's not ready yet yeah so um we're uh we're in progress moving forward we have a destination am it's not the Border it's not home it's not your favorite pillow it's the Gate of the Resurrection we're headed to that that's why this picture is up here that's where we're going it's important you see and so now there's a message called a man running from the presence of the Lord uh February 17th of 65 you've probably heard it before but let me just give you a little uh a little history on that brother Brandon had been prom ing people he was going to come back to Jeffersonville and preach on marriage and divorce because a lot of people had you know I mean pastors know that my case is different you know you tell them to listen to the tape yeah but my case is different there's thousand variations and so they had it all set up to be back there for that what weekend of the um 18th of of February of 65 well the kids were in school and so he drove by himself yeah now he didn't spend time in motels the way we do he would drive when he got tired he'd pull over in the shade and take a power and hour for 20 minutes then keep going okay so he arrives back in Jeffersonville which is about 2,000 kilometers he arrives back there uh sometime early Wednesday morning and churches until Thursday night so he thought well no since me sitting up here at the house by myself I'll uh I'll go down to church tonight and uh just you know be with the inspiration well soon as brother Neville saw him coming in Oh Brother Bill May well he he's got nothing he he he's ready for Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday and um so okay comes up and he preaches this Mighty message a man running from the presence of the Lord and he says on there I believe we have truth I'm satisfied of that and I believe the shuck is absolutely pulling away from the wheat here back in 65 but the wheat has to lie in the presence of the sun to ripen and that's what we're here for friend to stay in the presence of the sun till our little group of people here become so ripe to Christ until it becomes Bread on his table see there's a there's a reason there's a a progress he says um that's what I want it to do so later in the same tape he says let the great Holy Spirit he's praying here let the great Holy Spirit Come that came down on the mountain the other day out there now saturate every heart in here with his goodness and mercy with understanding we realize father that's what we need is to understand for if we do not know what we're doing then how do we know how to do it great question wish I have thought of that he said but we must have understanding as Daniel said he had understanding by Prophet Jeremiah's writing and father we have understanding by the holy spirit's writing as he will reveal it to us in this hour so it's not immediate but it's Progressive as he will reveal it to us now if I could somehow prove to you that you know how thick the streets of gold are are they are they 10 cm or 20 or what I don't know it's only for those that get there and we're not going to be around there measuring oh something's wrong here no so don't worry about all those things my whole Christian life I've been around people that are worried about what's going to happen after the Rapture forget it it's only the people that get there the rest of you it's a waste of time you know so let's leave it alone but you see it's unfortunate but the truth of the matter is that many people are going to miss Heaven by a mere 18 in now you know when you're going down these freeways over here at 110 miles kilometers per hour and and you're talking oh you missed the freeway you missed the exit by you know one minute but imagine missing Heaven by 18 in that's the difference between your brain and your heart we can quote it and we can oh man we got it what about it being a reality you know I was over to the garden center today and got these plants these pots got the little thing on there it says you know this is going to be that and that well I just see green plants but he knows that this one is a real hot plant and this one's not as hot and this is a yellow rose or whatever but you see um we could argue about that let's wait till the fruit comes on let's see what we're really talking about no I can listen to anybody in their their their particular Revelation oh okay what kind of fruit do you have what what's the what's the manifestation of this great truth you're projecting some of it hasn't worked out you know so um uh you know the day after in the in the few days immediately days after the after the Rapture of the bride all the churches are going to be crowded with people because then it's going to hit them see uh back there with Noah that was a conspiracy theory it'll start raining oh he was right after all and then guess what oh please let us in but up to that point up to up until the rain started falling they threw eggs at the ark they threw potatoes they threw everything at the ark so here's all this trash and now the rain started and they W in but the the door's been shut for seven days too bad and that's what's going to happen right here in this church and everywhere else people that came didn't pay attention yeah yeah brother John's a great pastor and brother Danny boy he's he's got a lot of potential and blah blah blah what about getting with program what about really taking it in and becoming the Christian that we're talking about you know so it's going to get tough so like I said the message of William brandom is simply the Amplified version of the scripture if you want to make it something else well go ahead but that's the way that people can kind of understand what it's about and um uh as bride we have this love letter from Jesus Christ we have the right we have the luxury to read between the lines yeah but what you get from between the lines is got to be in Perfect Harmony in perfect balance with what's on the line it can't be something different that's right and that's why the five Ministries they work together in harmony now they may say it a little different you know but we're going to the same goal you know so it's important that we hear what the messenger had to say that's how the bride makes her ready they're in Revelations 197 and the bride has made herself ready by studying by listening that's that's how we get ready you see and um the um so we have Jesus Christ born in the house of God's bread and he himself said in John 6:35 I am the bread of life he that comes to me shall never hunger and he that actually believes shall never thirst so in Christ is the portion that satisfies the believer okay now you might not know but I've spent the last 50 years translating brother brenham's words in Spanish so that they can have that's why this man's sitting here today yes sir way back there when he wanted to hear William brand he was listening to me so that that goes on all over Latin America and so it's got to be exact now there's no such thing from some of you people are bilingual you know that there's no such thing as word for word translation that doesn't work it's not in the Bible it's nowhere it's the meaning it's this it's the phrase oh that's what you me I was in Israel with some some Nigerians uh several years ago these people have been in message for years and first of all they thought brother Neville was a black man I guess just from The Voice they never seen a picture and they had a lot of questions um they they wouldn't take communion at 2:00 in the afternoon when had our appointment with the with the garden tomb because brother brand said it's supper it's not lunch well fine you missed your opportunity but but you can get so nailed down on stuff let's open this thing up you okay so um the message was brought to restore us not just right to the scripture not just to the apostles Doctrine but all the way back to Eden amen that's where it was perfect you see so we do have the truth and in Christ is all you will ever need if you get into Christ you see even even Martin Luther said Christ Alone we don't need all this stuff we need Christ Alone we need the word alone see and so when when Martin Luther was reading over in Matthew in Romans 1:17 the just shall live by faith see he was he was studying to be a lawyer and God was tugging on his heart and so then he gets into the priesthood all there was only Catholic Church okay back then and so he he goes over there thinking he'll find peace well he had it's a busy mind look you're you're just a troublemaker go go over there and study scripture fine so he studies scripture you know and he found that the just shall live by faith and the light of Revelation turned on you know he came alive in Christ but you see when Paul was writing Romans uh 1 Paul was quoting from he from Haba 2:4 the just shall live by faith that's a cross reference see it's over here and he's saying it over here yeah so the only thing we need is Christ the word you see and the believer is secure with the anointed word of your hour now all this other is true look I got good friends they don't have anything good to say about Billy Graham well hello he's one of the three Messengers for starters he did his job now the fact that he never saw this message well it wasn't for him he had this over here to do he did his job right that's right somebody came to brother Brandon one time and they uh they had you know it was a bit of a competition back then because whoever could get there first with the news you know they might get a gold star get a shortcut into heaven or something and they came to tattle on Oh Billy Graham said or did something he said wait a minute if I can hold up my end as well as he's holding up his end everything will be okay so I believe now that we have people they're maxed out brother Chris is living the best he knows how he's living the message brother Danny's living the message the best he knows everybody's at their max level praise God we're going together so um in the message of uh Hebrews this is real important in the Hebrews message 1957 Jesus said in St John 5:24 he that heareth not he that shaketh or he that speaketh he that heareth my word and believes on him that sent me has eternal life and shall never never come to the judgment um but it's passed from death into life so it's your faith and your faith confessed by your lips only makes manifest to the people around you that you can hear in other words all these churches they're quoting out the same Bible okay so I can read and quote okay he says but your life is open before all so no matter how much you try to act like this or do that it never works it's got to be in you that's the kernel of the whole story your personal faith is in the resurrected Christ as your savior that he's at the right hand of God acting in your place this morning as you're acting in his place down here as a witness so bread is very important in you know our diet it's important for survival and it comes in many different shapes kinds and so forth and here in America we got you know all kinds of choices other countries not quite as many but before we can have bread on the table like we quoted a while ago there's a long process Gardener knows some of you people in farming maybe you know that we have the the preparing of the ground we got the planting of the seeds now west in Canada they plant sometimes with an airplane there huge tracks of land you know and so they plant the seeds and and so then they wait and see if it's going to come up and so comes up half an inch oh we got wheat no you got little green plants no wheat yet looks like wheat you know and so it grows and then of course eventually there's the harvesting the storing of the wheat and the greenery then eventually it goes to the mill and you got this white powder you still can't eat it it's useless you use it for wallpaper paste maybe so B then you got these good cooks that we have here and they know how to take that white powder and mix it with something good and eventually you got chocolate cake or we go on but that's later but from the little plants in the field to the bread on the table is a long difficult process okay and for the Christians it's a long difficult process from repentance at the cross to the picture on the wall it's a long but it's worth it amen prophet of God said whatever you do don't miss it am it's very very important so those little plants they grow and so you know there there is a goal there's a purpose to be useful to the master and during the gross cycle there's going to be trials tribulations fears doubts critics all kinds of stuff but he said there that's what we're here for friend to stay in the presence of the sun till our little group of people here becomes ripe to Christ becomes Bread on his table that's when you can retire this is not a retirement program well there's no retirement program in this Bible you're moving into a a little bit different responsibility I might be calling you so he's just changing you know dispensations we'll say but everything that happens to you in your journey is nothing less than the tender hand of Jehovah if he didn't care for you if he didn't care about you we wouldn't waste any time with you but he's watching you all the way through through this process and that's why it says over in Romans 8:28 we know how do we know because we read it because we believe it you know you've got a car out there unless something happens but you know and you know that it's going to start so we know that all things work together for good for good for those of love God and those are called according to his purpose and you can't fake either one of these okay got that straight so for plant growth wheat or anything else in the earth you got to have seed and you got to have the soil from the nutrients and um you got to have water and you got to have sunlight you take away you one of those four you have nothing you got a mess you see and so uh that will produce something of benefit for humans and other creatures and we must have all four so the most plants are started from seeds or cuttings of other plants correct correct correct okay got that straight so once the plant is growing uh there's going to be storms you know in your life that's that's to make you solid that's not to turn you over you know and make the roots go deeper and so with the little plants you know we have trials and tribulations and if if you can afford it he's got some plants over there that are you know in a nice size pot they're they're already you know half grown that's nice if you can afford it but it's more fun to see the plant grow but when we're raising children there are times that we wish that we could go from the hospital and somehow magic and and by the time we get them home there two years old well it doesn't work that way or maybe 12 no you got to go through the trials got to go through the long nights and everything I saw a cartoon the other day where this woman she had the new baby and everything and she uh said you know I'm going to sleep on this side of the bed tonight cuz from over here you can't hear the baby cuz he never heard it but that's just some of the things you know and um when I and you're going to face dangers you're going to face all kinds of Trials when I was young a long time ago uh I was facing the the the uncertainties and the dangers of War 1965 I had doubts and fears I just come through basic training in the Army I didn't know what they're going to do with me I mean all these other guys Bo they wanted to go kill people and run the tanks all that stuff I didn't know said Lord you know and so um I um I had a a few days a few moments on Saturday morning there at Thanksgiving in the shreport Louisiana with brother brandham and he simp simply said George don't worry footsteps of the righteous are order of the lord it's a foundational scripture you know Psalms 37:23 Jesus Says I Am With You Always even to the end of the world not just till Sunday not just till whatever no to the end of the world so to be useful we have to have experience which produces maturity okay so as you surrender he takes over he guides you guides every step Matthew 28:20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I with you always even to the end of the world so you got nothing to worry about just feed your soul just like you you know we're not going to go hungry too far you know there's restaurants everywhere nobody's going to suffer well put about your soul you got to read the word you'd be surprised if people I run into that don't know the word I mean I deal what this lady just uh yesterday I said study the ladies of the Bible Well she goes over here in Acts and she finds Lydia wow didn't he know that was in the Bible well where you been these 40 years study the word it feeds your soul okay okay now so we have to surrender in order for God to lead brother Brandman had to surrender get the people to believe you now he didn't have an education he barely made it to the seventh grade I'm sure you don't probably know anybody stopped at seventh grade but that's as far as he got way back there and um so so now he's preaching and he's young and he falls in love with this girl and so he goes on a little vacation up here to Michigan someplace and uh he found the Pentecost all of a sudden wow you know so they asked him to preach well you know the whole story so he goes home with this list of man that we want you over here cuz it was something they never heard before a young guy like that preaching like that so he goes home and U his wife says well bill I'll go yeah you bet but then when they face Grandma oh different story you're not taking my woman my my daughter out there you get back down that church and preach so William Brandon being young no experience he listened to mother-in-law and the world suffered in Jeffersonville today the Ohio river is one mile wide during the flood of January 1937 is 200 miles wide only God knows what all was swept away and brother Rand had to live with that stuff the rest of his life he should have done but he didn't well then God was dealing with him he was a man of the Wilderness he had that Elijah Ministry and that anointing and so he was going to go hunting and God would show him okay now you're going to see this kind of animal and you know squirrel's going to be there and all this kind of stuff and then when he was in the Pulpit the same voice would tell his name's John his name's Mary give him courage to know that he could speak that In Crowd of a thousand people more you know so it all worked together but he had to surrender he had to walk by faith even when he was going to preach the Seven Seals clear up in 63 been preaching for you know 30 years and advertised and studied and everything but on the way to the pulpit he stops at Billy's office and he said now Billy if you ever talk prayed for daddy pray now I don't have any idea what we tell these people walk by faith now he knew who he was he had the assurance that God was with him but yet he had to walk by faith so as the wheat plant is growing it's green it's growing it struggles it pushes is but when the grain becomes mature you know in July um the struggle is over you can just bow its head and here comes a combine and that's what's coming now the combine's coming so you've had plenty of years of teaching and preaching and now the combine's coming you better be ready you know so when Jesus was in Gethsemane he knew who he was there's no doubt he didn't want to die you know he said not my will but thine but if this cup could pass oh you know all he could do is bow his head and surrender and so that's what we're doing now we're waiting for the combine it's on the way it's already cranked up it's coming you better be ready Psalm 46:10 be still I'm God I got to figure it out don't need your opinions don't need your ideas all your calculations all your quotes just coming Ephesians 6:13 wherefor take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withand in the evil day and having done all just stand we don't have to have an answer for all those crazy people amen if they want to blast their head off and all the stuff they want to say they're just digging their hole deeper every day no just stand steady okay amen so the believer comes to a to a maturity through a process and then you will be useful to the master in the New Testament he said tear ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high how long until he didn't tell him 10 days he didn't tell um what's the name Abraham it's going to be 25 years no see we as humans we're placed on a free moral agency he gives the command then you all decide you know we have that choice and so we make decisions and many times we fail to seek God for those decisions now um 65 years ago this week brother br's preaching over in Chicago and the time came for Abraham the great patriarch and servant of God to make a decision you see God doesn't make all of our decisions and there's many times that God doesn't tell His prophets just what to do because they have to make the decision if there's no decision that we have to make uh and just wait on God for every move then there's no overcoming on our part that's good for all of us and sometimes they make the wrong decision now these are his words God's anointed prophets make the wrong decisions and many times are deceived all this is telling you is they're humans they're humans I mean Abraham received the promise and you know time's ticking hey Sarah well nothing same old story every month well then in the meantime he had brought her this beautiful Egyptian maid so she's Ming the floor she's doing all the work now Abraham you know he told him she told him one night now look Abraham you brought me this girl now this probably is God's program because you know she's a beautiful girl she's bearing age here I am look at me he said well he was human well okay and from that day till this we've got problems in the Middle East that's why because Abraham listened to his wife right so we have the clear word of God in 2 Corinthians 6 wherefore come out from among them be you separate sayith the Lord touch not the unclean thing I will receive you and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters sayith the Lord Almighty having therefore these promises right here let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness s of Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God fear of God this is his word feed your soul you'll be on the right path so in other words maturity is achieved progressively we don't have instant children I mean even when they get to 19 and 20 and still in college what are you guys thinking they they eventually come oh yeah Dad's right well it takes time you know so it's not instantly and so this maturity is one of the benefits of being subject to the ministry as Paul wrote in Ephesians 4 God placed these vital Ministries in the body for the perfecting of the Saints don't come here thinking you're doing Danny a favor about coming here showing up and putting $100 you're not doing any favors you're doing favor when oh yes sir you're right and you start to see the the flower blooming out you know so um for the perfecting of the Saints so it's not just listening to the prophet or the pastor but all five for a balanced diet if you don't believe me when you go out here tonight you watch how people pick up stuff they don't just pick up sandwich and to drink no they they want a little bit of variety we had a great variety at breakfast I mean so much that poor people India starving here we are throwing food away but anyway we got through it um so for thousands of years the Jews have been quoting Moses perfectly but they failed to recognize the manifestation of those promises right it's one thing to read and repeat but hey wake up it's coming to pass you know you know and um they were blinded for our benefit don't feel bad at them they could not help it you listen to the brother Ram he'll tell you you know so go home and read Romans 9:10 111 it was for a purpose you see so the Christian Life does not take us to a sinless perfection in this body I don't care how much vitamins you take how much broccoli you eat I mean brother Bob he Bo's sharp eats right but guess what there's a line in the road you won't go past that line that's right yeah so we don't come to to Perfection this body we live among Sinners but we don't conform to their ways now I know people that wouldn't go to the mall they wouldn't go to the beach they're just going to live in their little cocoon and live their little Christian Life well there's no scripture for that we where the Christians we can go any place I mean if you're not going to see any bad women you better just stay in the bedroom because they're everywhere I mean they I don't know if you go to the airports but man the airports they come through with pajamas and not pajamas and all kinds of crazy stuff you know but um no we we have to be a part of this thing um our desires to God to his word to his Spirit brother Ram says you'll have trouble with this flesh until the day he calls you home so whatever you however perfect life you have you're going to have trouble it's not going to go away today we're speaking about maturity ripeness bread on the table and the combine is coming there's no more time for struggling just get ready okay and um we're living in the time of the Fulfillment of the prophet's prophecy and uh it's not going to be you know uh usually it's not immediate but it's always right on time God is very patient step by step uh we're actually just imagine we're exiting we're on the way out and the building is crumbling behind us it's already starting to crumble as we leave there's no repair you know FEMA is not going to help no nobody's going to help so we have many promises and evidences of the um the better life that lies ahead for us and uh it's not make believe it's more real than sitting here yes you think you're real and you got your nice suit on but guess what it's more real than that yeah and so uh many times we've rehearsed the scene of Abraham and Sarah you know out there under the oak tree remember guess what the oak Tre is still there when I was there in 1984 it still had green leaves on it and they've got history of 5,000 years those people are really they've been watching that thing it's still there so they were living under the oak tree and um out there south of Bethlehem and they were actually turned back young in their flesh to have the child God can do anything anything we all have testimonies there's a man sitting in prison down in Colorado and he's known as El Chapo a bad boy I mean he look he made Al Capone look good you know but God has reached him he's perfect peace life in prison okay no problem you know only thing he hadn't been baptized well a lot of people weren't baptized but U God can forgive he can change anybody's life you see brother R says he showed in Abraham and Sarah what he's going to do to you and your wife one of these days yeah Brooks it going to make you younger here wow sharp you and your wife one of these days turn you back young again we're on the seed we what we're the Seed of Abraham on our road to the promise M's are already over there waiting for me she's already perfected she's waiting for me when she was sick way back in 2004 back in there uh I could see she was getting you know the doctors wern't helping all these pills and everything wasn't helping and so um the Lord took her in uh November of 2006 but prior to that month or so prior we had a a sister from another state called us and she said you know I was sitting there at lunch today and right there there's a vision he said and there was brother brand preaching to this big bunch of people and their prayer line everything he's preaching Faith he says and you little sister thank you for praying for my daughter Rebecca and tell George not to worry everything's going to be okay well then I'm not going to worry it's not going to turn out the way I want probably but I I I told her in those days long there I said now look you know that God can can raise you up make you brand new in the next 20 minutes because she lived 19 years with William Brown she knew what faith was she knew what healing was all these Miracles and everything and I said but if he chooses to take you then you get with your dad and wait for me there okay so the Lord took her well um two or three years ago a brother called me uh that I know in Mexico he speaks Spanish and um he said I had this dream he said I was in heaven and I was I was right there I was talking to brother Brandon we were talking about things you know current things and um and he said uh and I noticed on on brother bram's side on his arm was this girl I'm looking at her ah it's Rebecca yeah young Rebecca and so she smiled at him and she said you tell George I'm right where he told me to wait it's real so Hall remember we quoted from John from Genesis 8:22 while the Earth remaineth see this this is a progress It's going to remain for a while so God has an order Sun you know large burning fire out there we can't even imagine but God has put the Earth in exact position if it was any farther it freeze it's any closer it burn you know so there's that big burning fire and our little planet here is in precisely the right distance and it goes around every 365 days around that sun it's not around it's kind of a egg shape and we have a moon that's going around our sun around our Earth all that's precise you know so the the Sun out there is so large that you could put a million Earths in the sun that's how large that thing is it's huge but God has it all figured out you see and um uh so maybe we're not so important after all maybe we're not so indispensable as we think we are we're just little creatures on a little blue planet out here God's in control you see and so God Says by his prophet in Isaiah 49:16 I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands if you had a magnifying glass and you look at all those little lines in your hand God's got all the names in there Isaiah 49:16 God knows what he's doing he doesn't need our thinking where we got a chicken brain by comparison nothing you know okay let's see if we can wind this up on the second Miracle right over here in Erie Pennsylvania 51 this is the way heaven will be now either brother Ram knew what he was talking about or it's like Walt Disney one of the two this is the way heaven will be there's going to be Germans and fins Italians Irish Mexican Nigerians El Salvador they're they're all going to be there yeah um some morning when this Mortal life is all over the sun will be set for its last time this old Earth will be blowned into bits maybe 500 years from tonight let's draw a picture now mentally 500 years from tonight now you see we think 500 years a long time no 500 years back here was Martin Luther Christopher Columbus it's just you know back there so 500 years out here you know he's drawing the picture I hear the winds howling I look at the Earth it's out of its orbit atomic bombs have thrown her out of her orbit Yonder She lays towards the sun she's whirling fast the suns are blowing the sun is blowing the winds are blowing there's not a living thing on Earth the Sands are blowing across howling many times thousands times Fahrenheit of heat laying against the Earth see it wouldn't take much got a little bit closer it burn and so no more water fire this time what do I see sticking up out of the sand over there oh it's a tombstone somebody's name is on it there they may be sitting in the meeting tonight where's your soul then friend if you're not right with God then let's draw a little farther out I see God bringing it back into his orbit again she's reinhabited the wolf and the lamb shall feed together as see a Beautiful Dawn a Tropic like the Orient big palm trees beautiful birds singing I come and look walking down through the garden over there the white doves are flying from tree to tree what's approaching it's the one that's going to sit on David's throne and his white robe is moving along I want to stand along there don't you may just be possible the tears come down and run my cheeks running down my cheeks while he passes by and I look at him and I say there's the lovely one that redeemed me when the Great supper is set and there were all seated around the tables at the wedding supper I'll look across the table and I'll say I recognize him he's from Finland or he's from Niagara wherever you know I recognize him I'll reach across the table take you by the hand we'll just have to shed a few tears then the first thing you know the king comes walking out in all his Beauty he'll take his hands wipe the tears from our eyes put his arm around us and say don't cry now it's all over No more healing Services no more hot nights No More Tears no more wheel chairs no more crutches it'll all be over entering into the joys of the Lord that's what this picture is all about thank you Lord that's where we're headed don't miss it let's Stand Together the musicians please come up and one of the reasons that we have confusion and divisions amongst believers we're in the age of perfection coming up to Perfection you know and we're coming up to maturity and we're looking at each other no take care of yourself get ready yourself amen we should be looking in the mirror of God's word so let's think on
