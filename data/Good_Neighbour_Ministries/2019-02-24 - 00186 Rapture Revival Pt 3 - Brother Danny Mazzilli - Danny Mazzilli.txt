TRANSCRIPT
========================================
like this and final aspects of the side [Music] and you believe and you've got faith I preach and it's just that's because the gift is your gift its creators sons and daughters of God at this hour so that we're going to be looking to you along the same lines that we've been ministering here I believe there's a revival that's taking place right now within the bottom I've been going on that is drawing sons and daughters of God to the position amen without you beating your position you can't have the authority that you need right in order to perfect your own existence as a son or daughter double amen so that God can finish off the work so they can finish off this last scripture which says that we will be changed and it'll be in the open and in the twinkling of praise God praise God so before we do that let's go to the mighty angel himself invited about he's already here already sense his presence already know that uh we're going to be Plus this morning because whenever he comes he's the one that always shows up all these shows up amen amen so if you've got faith this morning blessed being different in Curtis strengthened at five as my desire that is his desire as father Lord beer again privilege you can't say anything else you can't say that we deserve to be here that we deserve to be blessed that we deserve the divine revelation that you just continue to pour and that you are now in these last days raising such a lord we can't help by your grace Lord continues to provide relief for us and here we are once again Lord Lord we're assembled under your great spirit and your the great revelation of this our work at the pub lord I go right now there's there's the all the saints from the backstages Lord they're all they capped above because they know that every time that you assemble in you you take your place in the body of Christ you begin to minister Lord they start to get excited father because they with us they they see our partly see that we have to fulfill they see them we need to be perfected and sober where you can't about by a cloud of witnesses this morning Gordon we know that we are going to be blessed and because they come to meet with you Father and so they you take divine controller I'm gonna be prepared I put this morning part but I know disorder Jesus is going to continue on the first version this description that we've been reading because this is where we are word were here according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be wholly without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself there's no other God he's doing this this whole plan this whole plan of redemption it's not to a farmer that's it happened and a son that's sitting as I had another Holy Ghost that's the power of God it's to yourself and it's one God the Virgin over God he is one and that set period and he's doing this for his glory for his purpose and they're being drawn out to be confused do we worship do we know for being drawn to him pretty Scott to him to himself according to what the good pleasure of all of their lives don't dismiss you may be seated but to the church for the current sense and this is and this is the key this is the element that that were feasting on right now because God is giving a preparation for a perfect body change that's going to translate us out of this country into another dimension it's just that simple the rapture is you moving from this vibrant temporarily for three and a half years and then you're going to return back here to this earth to rule and reign with the Lord Jesus Christ for 1,000 years okay then because he's going to prove to the world that in 6,000 years all he could do was mess things up even he gave every country on the opportunity to rule integration and to have power and to meet over the earth to have the strongest armies and everything else what they could do it they could they couldn't do what God said he was going to do which was to bring back his kingdom and so he's gonna believe in one past few years you know you know Tyga's this is not enough into God we know that time is cutted of them okay so a thousand years where we talk about a thousand years and only pertains to this dimension and that's why we will come here to this dimension we will not be in time bodies like you see my god you will not be in the time body they have that older [Music] [Music] 6,000 years to mess things up he's been around a long time he's been messing up our generations messing up her grandparents inner Redbirds putting all kinds of spirits of demons [Music] it's the truth [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] chapter to 2104 you from the amplified version because I love this person in 221 it says in here the whole structure is joined welded together harmoniously and it continues to rise grow increase into a holy temple the Lord a sanctuary dedicated consecrated and sacred to the presence of the Lord that's what that says we're all perfectly it God doesn't make mistakes [Music] but he chose you because he knew you were always a deposit and report yourself in imported what you invest we according to into this dimension you wanted to a baby and everything else and you a season of total spiritual amnesia you know who you are you brought about certain parents here Moulton shaped under certain environments and certain countries and certain elements controlling your life but then something awakens you something is revealed to you at a certain time that season you can't understand it but you respond to it because not placed in there that was deeply placed within your being [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] your time of the season get into the house of the Lord the revelation of this hour and it's going to hurt you guys too right it's not your work may be bad this is God's work this is about this is you don't listen listen I'm a bot just like you believe your own body well-priced he is the head of the body he's the one that came down in 1963 when the mighty angel came down and that cloud appeared over sunset Mountain it was the intelligence it was the mighty to stuff himself coming down to take a pride to take a body he says don't be a power come into the church and now it's coming and that the Holy Spirit will ignore the people to speak word and it will create itself like that Luna we have a seat power that's coming into the church amen that's coming into the church blessed be the name of the world all right together what the church begins to get into the church now I know it it's coming now it's now here he's now taking this number is control and he's without effective that's looking at today we're gonna be looking at put the next slide amen and these messages these messages has been hidden now now remember the foundation the manifestations of the sons of God to display them to the church Oh hide again what the church begins to get to get it amen praise God so now as you think point we've been moving along here this is brother Branham he came he left the scene in 1965 were already fifty-four years ahead of that we've got way beyond his time in the season so there's been a progression that's been going on and there's been this were doubtless that was that was brought for it rest into the restoration to front of Records ministry required that the mighty will come down himself now reveal the mysteries right what are the mystery stuff without written under that bottom seal it was the names of the sons and daughters out there to try to figure out the book of Revelation forget you [Music] vindicated [Music] because the ministries we get in here now dot says one to the Pentecostal age a messenger in the twentieth century to restore the Word of God because there was all confusion in all of those churches how do you know which way to go - captain church it lots of baptize the baby or the Baptist Church you know baptize babies he go to this church although they baptized the titles of the father son for this church [Music] [Music] william branham we recognize the relish peas our profit but we do not follow every word follow everything we have like can we talk by him we can open up exactly what he thought no it's beyond that how do you say the right angel can cut down that do his own part to the Michael [Music] you cannot be changed I just you cannot be changed but you sitting and listening to the tapes they trap you like black chicken to do not get a conversation with a certain low because they speak a different language they speak the supernatural language they speak my revelation they have a different key inside them that can only receive revelation they can take an interpretation they can't take baths please and applause and this way you're gonna do - oh God I will perform his spirit through the body angel come down to 1963 brotherbrother just feet down the seat by 1965 and here comes the mighty to himself to control now of a five-fold a man to build a super church to restore ii back to her position again authority where she will know what to do will not be a puppet tool that you will be able to rock that will be under the control of the holy spirit any dictators any any uh you know superstar preachers and they've been the message longer than you is the one gives inspiration he's the one that inspires he's the one that starts the work he's the one this is [Music] [Music] and through the church positions are perfectly fit God gifted you in certain areas overall that does give to do in certain areas let us give you certain heart for ministry and certainly as designed you just perfectly you know from your childhood exactly the way that you need to be in order to fit in the body of Jesus Christ amen Gloria duck next slide and so all waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God hallelujah when God will make himself known when they'll stop cats with their sub diseases that's what we're striving before now to get and be positionally placed into the kingdom of God before these wanted to play a strike predestinated mystery of this was for the ground speed next time now the rapture revival and the end the end the end the church the time of the season that we're living in is right up there in that capsule Christ in the form of his bride is what is going to be in that because Christianity started back when Christ was on the earth that's why it's called Christianity and all through those dark ages in all the way up to today the body has been building up but in the last days there's going to be a supernatural church and that church you cannot just join that church you know join a majority good investors do not get because your parents or your grandparents were in this message and you were following it and all of a sudden you can bring upon yourself I get the land because he was owned by my parents that's not the way it works in this age you'll notice there's a gap between the 7th church age and the capsule in that capstone is where the perfect church gets placed for the lift up to meet in the air very much you can't get in their 40s there's a gap between the capsule and the ages and that guy it's a supernatural gap that requires the Holy Spirit Himself to come and pull you out of the church ages to come because everybody else is in the 7th church age anybody all the other churches all denominational churches up there are all the other teachings up there they come under the natural church ages we preferred that there is an eternal church age messenger right which is the mighty angel itself if there's going to be an eternal church right that they require an eternal lesson genomic first to be messy and that's why a lot of it or this be stuck here it was a rapture those they're gonna be tied to brother branham's birthday message not realizing that he was always pointing us to the right [Music] to be pointed to a church the Catholic Church the Presbyterian Church the two local ministers whatever at a Cosmo this is your pointing to a church natural but this super church this last Church age for the rapture takes out of that natural church because that's where all of you and I worry and that's why we separate we believe in the Christian Church of Christ in His Church that's what it means but we know for a fact that every time those churches denominations and so the Holy Ghost will just move on because he needs to come to this to the capstone ministry where you as sons and daughters of God can only be placed to adoption through you getting into your position through you and so whether or by I need to go to church I've heard others [Music] in yourself sometimes you need to be deleted from your perceptions and program generational thoughts and ideas and interpretations of the Word of God they praise you walked out and so let's look at the next slide he says it's built right out like this to a point and the stone of the capstone never was errant they never did put a cap on top of the pyramid I don't know whether you know it or not the big period of Egypt it never had a top stone on that we know that the Pyramid of Giza is a a period that was good we believed Enoch okay who was you know that walked with God you know he walked with God it was completely dyed so much that he knew so much about the plan of redemption not at the table but he dug this pyramid it is perfectly you know exactly the whole cycle of the church and of the world and everything in it to this day science is busy killing they can't explain they come up with all kinds of interpretations all of those super beings that came down from heaven that you know that they were not killed Giants in Atlanta they were there were sons of God and they were to all these cities that's pretty close but the antibody just right because they don't understand the final redemption it would realize what God was doing when he placed that the period of Deeds on which is perfectly placed in the center of the earth exactly perfect because this is the mighty God himself on the shore so and so here huh it never had a top on it why the tax law was rejected because Christ is the capsule and Christ the capsule came down in 1963 when he kidnapped beaten up with earthly angel to save time shall be no we're moving down from this earthly church age into an eternal church age and so he came down the head Jesus a lot of looking for this you know the second coming of the arm that he's gonna come in the clouds already [Music] [Music] and so here now he says the cap slope was rejected and they rejected this revelation they rejected it easy you can look you can see it on the internet you have to punch it will you brother seven angels sunset Popular's there's all kinds of videos on there good because they got a reject the word in order for the word to be a member when Christ came he came to his own so that you could take you a Gentile ready man be paid for this all the Jews but they rejected him they will have their day it's not too far it's just around the water say they're going to be awakened to the same Lord Jesus that you were linked to very many because the word has to be fulfilled and every type possibly will help and that's why we could get into so many types in the Old Testament with Joseph Joseph wasn't you and you have that he took the top prize perfect type of Jesus Christ and don't come down about throwing the dungeon that he not raised up the Pharaohs right hand reduces right hand man it's just perfect types of Christ amen okay I recognize this but you do because you've got revelation of the work and so now but as we grow from the Luther Age the Baptist age the Methodist age the Pentecostal age of discontinuing this booklet your right up to the captain stone now see for the captain stone to set down the building's complete so he is now in the process of completing this church I'm not ready the scripture the spoke was rejected partially realized that was talking to the Solomon's Temple but the rejected stone has become the chief the chief of the quarter but I've seen this movie to make a picture to you now in the Bible we're living in the last days the top of the pyramid the cross fishes of the cancer age in the zodiac because God's fire was first printed in Evans and this time telling you about scientists speaking about all of this all of the who had the agent feel the lion and September the woman and the dragon and the baby and repeated you know this is all taking place but they don't know how to interpret it because they don't have a revelation of what God is doing in this thing and so the zodiac in the time of the coming of the legal ayat in the captain stone and in the days of the manifestation of the sons of God in the Bible so this is the season of RIT we're indices who were the sons and daughters of God manifest and they got to come into their positions and they've got to be protected we're right at the end time see where we're at he says Amen so here we are now we are at that point where God is now perfecting the church and we need to recognize this and recognize that being a forehead and what part of the scripture that's now being fulfilled one of the vents a historical nature like never before taking place right now there are things happening in the world in the governments in the in the politics in the in the land systems there's this bit because the earth is in Earth pays off because the sons of God are coming into manifestation a man talk about you live in to the daughters of coffee and cuz we've never given in the beginning God created Adam and he he created them male and female and called their name so so you has a son or a daughter god they're equal in God's economy man here we have positions here we have to save our positions the way that the word has decided for us so that we can get properly regulated by the Word of God and position properly because we get a woman out of position she can't property coming to wrap through today through the word up and if you're an attribute of God you cannot be disposition probably so everything is coming together he's not my mother for five the the church age messenger that needed to come up out of all the mess we received our malachite call we've been in this for many years now here we are we're reaching that point where at any time we call home hallelujah you know so we had a beautiful weekend with the leadership and we got into some wonderful plots because whatever the boss that was brought was about true servant leadership as sons and daughters of God and I want to tell you each and every one of you you heard about Sunday you weren't ministers every one of you is a minister you missed her up to the Lord mr. to one of them when you come into this body and you would have been brought into the body of the price to be bonded in love you see the great thing about the capstone of were looking at brother Brennan he entered into that by virtue what did that capsule is is in that eternal place and he said perfect love could enter into that place and so you now ask sons and daughters of God coming into the church do big okay I'm gonna join a church first of all you don't join the church God adds to the church so if God adds to the church and you're being led by God that guess what God's going to do he's going to bond you to the ministry he's going to bond you to the body of Christ you know that it's God because if you can't escape you come to this church with an attitude and you want to stick with that attitude you [Music] it changes your nature and you start to exhibit God's characteristics his attitudes his ways of working in the body of the Christ so one of the thoughts was that you have run into the leadership and you you have been brought into this body here his church gods would argue with the body and with a woman into a certain place in their walk where they're walking together they can start updating but then once they start to get a little bit more where they want to go a little more intimate and they've got to move into the stage of marriage and that's God you can and you're stubborn it's because you're not really bonded to this church it's because you cannot but you get to the place or you're ready to enter into a marriage because when you belong to a church and you support your password you are actually a marriage commitment in time for Christ in the church it all perfectly taxing you become three [Music] [Applause] in this age not a message this is the time for these holy days perfecting you he's starting to take out all that stuff you are receiving the Word of God and the Word of God and because that's what happens you start to read those things because of the revelation [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this is your subject to the hoarded up talking about violence [Music] we search around because [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] because it's a supernatural
