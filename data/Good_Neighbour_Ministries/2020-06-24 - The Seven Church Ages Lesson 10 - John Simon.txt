TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends very happy that we are back in the house of God I welcome you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there it is right behind me as the songwriter says times clock is striking the hour Jesus will soon this end clad in the garments of power the rain of sin to end let us pray father we thank you for this marvelous and wonderful opportunity of coming together in the middle of the week to pause and Lord meditate upon the things of God we pray that you'll bless our time together and made a spirit of God rest upon the word in the name of Jesus Christ we ask your blessing amen and amen I shall read from Genesis chapter 4 divine verses 3 to 7 and Joseph said unto his brethren I am Joseph thought my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence and Joseph said unto his brethren come near unto me I pray you and they came near and he said I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt now therefore be not grieved or angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God that sent me before you to preserve life for these two years at the famine beam in the land and yet there are five years in which there shall neither be airing nor harvest and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance fight the Lord Jesus sake the Great God of heaven for the reading of his word now last week to recap I spoke on Joseph the first part of Joseph a type of Christ and in this we showed clearly Joseph's life's journey and how his life's journey types symbolizes and prefigures the light prefigured the life of Christ who came after him we further talked about Joseph and Israel his homeland and how he was treated by his own bredrin his brothers true him in a pit his brothers sold him Joseph to some traders who took him into Egypt and woman there in Egypt he was cast into an Egyptian prison in Egypt while in that prison he met a butcher and the Baker they both had dreams God anointed him he interpreted those dreams one would live the baker and a butcher would die so the Baker was restored to his position later on Pharaoh had a dream while Joseph was still in prison and none of his wise men could interpret this dream but they on the butcher's advice that there is a man in your kingdom that that's able to interpret dreams and of great wisdom and understanding and so Pharaoh sent to procure Joseph out of that prison so I touched on the fact that his life's journey from the pit in Israel his old man to the prison in Egypt and from the prison into Pharaoh's Palace so you remember it that way and it will really help you in the marvelous wonderful way so Pharaoh immediately set for Joseph who came into his presence and told him that wisdom and understanding comes from God and so he has to ask God to give him the interpretation of Pharaoh's dream which he was given it by the God of heaven and hero Joseph interpreted Pharaoh's dream for him and told him about the coming famine the years of plenty and the years of famine and so Pharaoh himself being a wise ruler said who shall I find to administrate to handle this great problem and then he said well to himself and said it loudly to his counselors the best person I believe I can place into the is Joseph the interpreter of the dream for his already proved that he has wisdom and understanding therefore Joseph who was in the prison and should have been taken back to the prison and chains was now exalted and empowered by Pharaoh and placed at his right hand Moses Joseph began to manage all the affairs of the famine and the plenty that was to be in the land and during the course of time Pharaoh granted him his daughter in marriage what a life what a time now we want to move on now and handle this topic of Joseph's meeting his bedroom now we get back to the story finding that my friends dispensational times are changing I mentioned that we are again at the place of the changing from the Gentile dispensation back to the Jews just as much my friends as Joseph turns his attention from his bride that he had married to the presence of his brethren even so God even so the attention of the great Holy Spirit the Lord Jesus Christ Himself slowly turning his attention away from the Gentile bride to his brethren who are now coming into focus coming into power coming into a print in the presence of God where all their needs will met all their needs will be fulfilled great riches will be given to them great mounds of food will be given to them joy in their hearts love upon their lips going back to tell their father of their wonderful fortune in finding their brother Joseph now we recall of course let Joseph requested all the work from before him and ask for his brethren to appear but on their first visit he recognized that one was missing and so he told them go back and all of you must come bring all of the brothers but there's one brother that's missing and make no mistake about it so they went back they entreated their father the father was reluctant Jacob was reluctant to allow his last Benjamin to come on this journey but nevertheless to save posterity to save their lives these brothers returned back with their brother Benjamin and when they brought Benjamin in Joseph couldn't take it anymore and the Bible says he cried out aloud so that the servants of Pharaoh heard him and my friends he he just loved Benjamin who was his full brother thanks be to God even so will it be my friends when Jesus returns and finds his little brother who had kept the commandments of God this little brother who had held to God's unchanging hand who had fulfilled prophecy by going back to Palestine it will set his soul fire to know that these are his own oh what a wonderful day that will be my friends as the song set that says the day of redemption is near men's hearts are feeling fulfilled be filled with the spirit your lamps trimmed trimmed and clear look up your redemption is near yes Jesus is coming soon and he's coming back first to rapture his bride and then return to Israel to reveal himself to his brethren so that they may know him whom they have pierced Oh glory be to God no friends realize little Benjamin is a type of the 144,000 found in Revelation chapter 7 verses 1 to 8 in which the Bible tells us clearly that in there under the tribe of Manasseh 12,000 the train of naturally 12,000 the tribe of Ephraim 12,000 the tribe of Judah so these my friends are the wonderful tribes of israel and they are jews they are not Gentiles that they repeat she acted heroically and emphatically this statement is in the Word of God they are of the tribes of Israel they are not Gentiles there are absolutely Jews here called out by God one hundred and 44,000 of them that none deceive you let none take your mind off of the Word of God but recognize clearly what God's Word is saying to you my brothers and sisters thanks be to God hallelujah all those Jews have gone back to Palestine waiting for their intention by the coming Messiah from about Stan God knows them other years and will recognize that wonder 144,000 that have been faithful and true to the Word of God and are standing in Israel who are waiting to receive him their Messiah many of them may not know his name many of them right now may not even believe that Jesus Christ is their Messiah and that's wonderful that's fine for everything there is a time there is a season there is a there is a a Junction as a place and time but the fullness of time the scripture says God sent forth his sons and so my friends there we see the Scriptures the Bible says that when they recognize him they will cry out they were crowd and said whence are you the wounds in your hand and in your feet where did you get these wounds and he said what's pierced you he says oh I've got them in the house of my friends oh my think of it oh what a weeping and wailing think of it when those brothers recognize this was the one we placed in the pit and now here he is in the palace in authority and most of all with power over our lives their fear that would be upon them and they and cried and scream thinking that their lives will be taken from them oh praise God hallelujah my friends but just think of it oh that these wonderful brothers Jewish brothers who wondered the entire world and suffered so much God and His plan is returning them and recalling them back to Palestine back to Israel in the presence of Almighty God just as much as Christian believers a Christian Church that has wandered away from the Word of God the promised land of true believer God's Spirit is calling every true believer back to the word back to the Bible back to your original apostolate listen to the voice of God speaking from his word in these last days and live for his glory and for his honor hallelujah yes my brothers and sisters I tell you here when Jesus comes when he reveals himself to his Jewish brothers and sisters he will reveal to them who he really is Feast of the trumpets to the Jews is as was the opening of the seven seals to us Gentile the fullness of the word breaking upon them by the Holy Spirit for God anointing anointing will be upon that word of God and the scales will fall off their eyes and they will recognize just as Paul being a type of them then recognize who their Messiah is that he is Jesus Christ the Lord oh my my god Lord God Almighty hallelujah or he will reveal himself to them that he is the ultimate lamb and that all the sacrifices they were offering spoke of him and of his coming revelation chapter five and six hope that he was that bloody bleeding man when the voice cried out who will take the book and open the seals thereof that it was him and he would make it known to them that he was not bleeding bloody bleeding lamb oh and bought their Redemption oh your precious blood never loses power till all the ransom Church of God are saved to sin no more oh yes he'll make himself known that he was that is that ultimate Lamb he is the fulfillment of those limbs those limbs were types but he is the substance he is the fulfillment he is the word itself and how that he liked the lamb sacrifice his life now he did it that Calgary and sacrifice his life for us down from his glory of a living story my god and savior came and Jesus was his name all praise God that's what really happened and at that time they were written ice what God has done for them and their families will gouge one family apart and with an agony weep and mourn and they'll get national revival repentance in the presence of great job of a god great Jehovah Jesus don't repent of their sins as a nation and in their fullness back to god no where will the Gentile church be when Joseph our Joseph Jesus will be making himself known to his Jewish brothers and sisters where will the church me the real Bride of Christ will be caught up into the presence of a man God because remember Joseph's wife his brain his Gentile brain and his two children they were in the balance for he had ordered everyone to be out while he reconciled reunited and came into a harmony with his brothers in that wonderful restoration time and so while he was talking to his brother sisters his wife was in the palace so will it be with the Lord Jesus oh what a glorious time that while he is reconciling with his with his brothers and sisters oh praise God they're full of waiting work time when she will be called out by him but meanwhile she will be there in the presence of God while he unites with his brothers won't praise God so the Gentile church will go into the rapture into the ivory palaces the brother she will be taken off of the earth caught up in the air let me stress before the tribulation before I repeat the tribulation the brain the waist of Christ will be caught up out into the presence of God there she'll be three and a half years why the wrath of God like the presence and wrath of God will be poured out while Ross is being poured out on earth we've been whaling she will be in the great wedding supper in the presence and glorious heavenly atmosphere of God so one set will be weeping and wailing but another set will be rejoicing and enjoying the great marriage supper of the Lamb to some it will bring them joy others deep despair oh praise God but the doors of us we look up for we know that our redemption is near what a glorious two lanes praise God the Lord Jesus leaving his bride in his father's house we have asked her before come and go with me to my father's house where there are many mansions and once she is in his father's house in those many mansions he returns back to his brethren and she enjoys her time in the father's house with the marriage supper of the lamb at this time the Antichrist government government will be upon the earth and we want to tell you of this great coming covenant that will take place between the Jewish people in Rome but Rome will absolutely break that covenant and the Jewish people will be so disappointed and as their scientist was betrayed so will the Jewish people be betrayed but one who was so close to them who was so nice to them who was trying to reach out to them will betrayed them and so they this great Empire that time will bring up their troops along with their allies to attack these good god-fearing Jews that are upon the face of the earth for their word of biting their god-fearing god-loving as they come against the city oh my god God Himself my friends will come against them for the Bible says there will appear in the heavens the signs of the coming of the Son of Man yes sir that surely will happen for just as much as Hitler was only a small symbol or type showing that a great evil is to come the Jewish people which we as Christians known as the Antichrist the man of sin the lawless one oh my friends it's coming the Covenant is coming this evil lawless rebellious one is coming this Superman for which the Gentiles Church is looking for to unite them together is coming oh all of this he true Rome will trick the Jews betray them and then begin my friends another tribulation upon them you will see Hitler put them through a troublesome time my friends Oh worse reg Evans timeless yet to come time to repent turn to Jehovah God turn to Jehovah Jesus commitments are it legalized to him and know him in the power of his resurrection yes sir and there it's fine spread as they come by friends against this great city the Son of Man will return to destroy those who are polluted and destroyed the earth revelation 11:18 you'll find that my friends so he comes and presents himself fully to that 144,000 oh mighty power being displayed my friends there we burn well but he'll say don't be angry with yourself it's all right God was in all of this list you see for he did it so that I could be here to preserve your lives even so I believe Jesus himself will speak Jesus will speak love and peace to his Jewish brothers and let them know that he loves them cares for them and he came to preserve their life thank God His grace and mercy is what brought the Gentile church true and His grace and mercy will bring our Jewish brothers and sisters true amen why did why did they reject Jesus anyway maybe they're rejected him because God he was in it it was the only way that he could get Jesus to come like Joseph had to go to Egypt Jesus continued so that he could take a gentle bride so he died on the cross to preserve the life of the Gentile church think of it now these hundred and four to four thousand I'm not in the brain there are not a part of the wife of Christ they are Jews as I have said yes sir here they are the scripture says they follow the lamb that means they follow the word that means they recognize him the couple of their blindness and they recognize him they follow the lamb whithersoever equip and they have not defiled themselves with women showing that they are eunuchs unto God their spiritual attendance their intended by God to be spiritual attendance to his wife his bride and so they are in character by the Holy Spirit so these eunuchs keepers of the bridal chambers attendants they do not sit on the throne but they are before and by the truth they are not in the bride but yet they are included in his glorious millennial reign that is to come then we see friends but these lasts of Israel are joined to the Lord in great love for him at that time the enemies of the Lord and of his Christ are being destroyed and God begins to prepare his holy mountain his new Garden of Eden and there we find the brain and her attendants for the thousand years honeymoon which will be on the earth for the wedding took place on earth the honeymoon takes place in heaven and then the marriage supper takes place in heaven and then the honeymoon takes place on earth because he comes back with her right word on the horse and his name shall be called the Word of God and the honeymoon takes place here upon the earth now friends it's marvelous and wonderful know that our Lord Jesus the last Adam and his Eve his bright church by friends will walk in God's holy mountain and fulfill scripture for this Adam this eve will not fall but stand by the fullness of the word now I want to bring your attention as I'm about to close you recall that Joseph stood before his bredrin and when Benjamin was not yet with them but he stood before his bedroom and the Bible tells us that he spoke to them through an interpreter amen now why did he do that Juke Joseph knew Hebrew for he was a Hebrew but yet he hid himself for a while and before the unveiling of the mighty God before unveiling or revealing himself to them just before he did that he spoke in them to them in tongues he spoke to them in an unknown tongue which they could not understand no did you do you realize that at the first part of the Gentile age or the Gentile dispensation which my friends is in line with Daniels head of gold that great Babylonian age and time ended with a message at the feast of Belshazzar with thousands of his Lord with all of the partying and all of the feasting and all of that great wonderful time of prosperity and and safety that they thought they were enjoying while they were in the middle of all of it suddenly in the middle of it silence struck that hall for the Bible says dear that hand of man supernaturally writing words up on the wall meant amendment taking your first sin you are weighed in the balances and you are found one thing yes my friends so is that even our day while our world was on but it's madness and it's folly of this age in which we are in believing that we are safe because of our arms because of our military might we do not recognize that there's a God in heaven that rules over all and he sets up kings and brings down Kings this is the mighty God that we serve and again we see a proliferation of tongues speaking o friend our Joseph is fixing to appear again upon the scene but this time he is coming to take his bride away and then after which he returned work and begin to close out his little brother Oh little Benjamin that 144,000 that have been faithful to him well my friends this speaking in tongues it's not just the sign of the fullness of God's blessing it's also a sign that ichabod is written across the doorposts also my friends that the glory is departed the Spirit of God leaving the Gentile world and returning back to our Jewish brothers the Gentile churches the Gentile dispensation is now at its ending but take God Jesus is coming those who are held to God's unchanging hand who has believed this word with all their heart who was listening to the voice of God through His Prophet in this last day and can say we are resting upon that those ones will look up for the redemption with joy for Jesus is coming Yusuf is coming the mighty God is coming the Alpha Omega is coming our prophet our priest our mediator our Lord of hosts the Lord God Almighty is coming even so come Lord Jesus the one and only true God come Lord Jesus quickly Lord even so come Lord Meiri we welcome you hard we accept you will believe you we put our trust in you and our hearts we give to you in the wonderful marvelous name of Lord Jesus Christ your wonderful name amen and amen god bless you my friends it was so wonderful to be here tonight feeling that sensing the presence of God and the flow of the Holy Spirit I pray that God's Holy Spirit will take this word and plant it securely within your heart and that you will go back and listen to this again and make good and rich you make God water and made a living God my friends multiply your good in the name of Jesus Christ let it be so amen and amen [Music] you you [Music]
