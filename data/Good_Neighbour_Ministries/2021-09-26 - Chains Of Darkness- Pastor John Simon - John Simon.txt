[Music] praise god praise the lord we have come to worship his holiness to give him glory and honor and most of all to worship in spirit and in the truth praise the lord may the lord bless you everyone praise god please be seated lord of god we're happy to see you brother god bless you richly amen glad glad to see every one of you in the house of lord i rejoice to see you in the house of god for as you know we're living in a changing age things have been moving so fast that we are actually spiritually and naturally being almost forced to catch up right right so uh because everything is changing digitally and it's gone into the higher realms just apply it spiritually and you'll understand what i'm saying it's gone into the in the realm of the spirit of god uh much higher right like in the third pull when brother branham said at the end of the one message he said oh it's two o'clock oh my and did you hear while we were singing it went to an octave higher one octave higher went into another dimension so i believe that we are now entered into another dimension because we live in two worlds physically we are right here in the natural world but spiritually we are living in the world and realm of the spirit creatures of time born in time but really come from eternity and so we are living in a time of return the time of the great jubilee not in the way that many expected to be but we are going back to our inheritance back to our homeland back to our heavenly father back to our king and his kingdom which is not of this world but of this war of the uh realm of the spirit of god the kingdom of god and i'm so glad for that that i'm a part of this but remember this while all that is going on god is stripping away all the shock he's tripping away everything else that surrounded the seed to keep us safe and we have all got to find a position in our place and that doesn't mean you got to go searching around i just mean you stay in the spirit of god and the spirit of god will place that stone or brick in the temple exactly where he wants it right but you must know your position and just be comfortable with it amen praise god god called me to preach i preached god called you to be in the pew and listen just do that you don't know anything else that's all god is asking you for if the king asked you to go and do some big thing win a war general wouldn't you go win the war all he's asking you now is to go dip just go sit and listen to the preaching and let the water wash over your soul that's all he's asking right so and uh and he was set free so it's that simple we just gotta humble down ourselves because all manner of spirits is moving right now and they're playing on every iota of every little thing you have on the inside that you may think you got hidden up and the holy spirit is bringing about conditions and circumstances to manifest the sons of god manifest the churn of god but don't always remember the two work together when one is manifesting here is bringing out the other one over there right so you always have to be conscious of god and what god is doing in this hour so this great revolution great changes as brother brown said they don't know what is great they're looking for all kinds of fantastics and it's taking place right in front of you amen only if you have the eyes god will give that to you without them you won't see a thing you you will want to know what is he talking about or you want to know what's going on well is there something mysterious is he trying to talk as if there's something going on and i'm not seeing it well it's happening and it's all around us and one day soon who knows it'll come to its conclusion and we'll all be caught up into his divine presence praise the lord i i want to take um a subject here today and um it's funny that i will use the scripture out of matthew chapter 4 verses 14 to 17. okay shall we read the word of god chapter 4 14-17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah's the prophet saying the land of zebulun and the land of nephthalim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw a great saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up from that time jesus began to preach and say repent for the kingdom of god is at hand amen our gracious father thank you for the reading of the bread of life your word and we pray lord that your blessings together visible audience invisible audience local father international wherever the people are made thy light and truth go forth father and may the great holy spirit take control of every heart every life every mind and may the word of god have its preeminence but we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen and amen praise the lord there's a slight ring slight please be seated while you are doing that let me ask for the reading of two other scriptures ii peter 2 4 2 peter chapter 2 verse 4. praise the lord i'm not as fast as the draw as i used to be it's harder to find these thin pages ii peter page is stuck together here now okay for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment now i'd like to take that for a thought chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment okay and the next scripture is jude 5 and 6. jude five and six i will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believe not and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitations he had reserved in everlasting chains under darkness under the judgment of the great day amen praise the lord hallelujah god bless the reading of his precious and holy word amen now of course the bible mentions about chains here and um i want to take for the topic chains of darkness and since the bible talks about chains first of all we know that the chain is a means of restraint it's a means of control to use to control it's a means of enslavement and a means of imprisonment so so that chain has a lot of um meanings um to it when we think of that now we know that satan has a chain but god also has a chain and you know satan's chain there is one that he put the whole human race in chains and it it's under the chains of darkness to the word of god hallelujah but i want you to know god has changed too because god put him in darkness into the understanding and revelation of his word right so satan is in darkness to what is being revealed and made known to us for unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom but unto him or them it's not given they're left in darkness concerning what's been revealed to you amen and satan on the other hand is making sure that he chains the people away from the word of god so that they don't get a revelation of it even if they're exposed to it he has clouds of darkness that he will put over the word which we will touch on a little bit later we know that satan uh using eve uh he enslaved the entire human race in chains of sin chains of various habits chains of darkness chains of denomination chains of tradition chains of culture you have to behave this way you have to do this this way they're all chains that satan has in his so-called civilization uh and he uses those chains to bind and to enslave the people and hold them under his power of his demonic power so people need deliverance the whole human race needs deliverance the whole human race needs to come out from the darkness that satan has it is the rising of the sun brother branham said oh this great hour when the whole world is covered with gloom and darkness and everywhere it's so gloomy you can hardly see but he said thank god there was a resurrection and it is now the rising of the sun hallelujah when the sun comes up the light shines and the darkness must flee away amen praise god hallelujah works expressed 1965 he said someone pulled me away and when i looked it was a lady standing over here when i was a little boy i used to haul groceries from a grocery store to the people and her name was mrs fenton she lives in jeffersonville even now a personal friend to the wife and i and she said brother branham deliver us from this this that we're living in here is a house of hell brother branham deliver us and you've been misunderstood brother branham uh these people see these are all fine people and when i look looked like a great big seller came before me and beneath was a great cave with great big iron bars 8 to 10 inches thick and people going out to their minds twisting arms and twisted legs beating their head on the bars like that and she was crying to me and saying brother branham deliver the people deliver the people brother branham and they were saying help help we're in trouble help help she herself i know she belongs to and he mentioned the name of a certain denominational church you see and i said well sister i wish i could and i went on looking around my little uh my little body and watching them great big bars and them poor people wondering how how could i with this little body do that right and you couldn't get to them their mind bars were close together and so thick and i looked and they were beating their heads people were like going out to their minds i think that's just about like now and i think about this or right now what the people are going through they're going through a house of hell right and see and when i looked i seen some little lights flickering around in there and when i looked up there's standing before me was jesus christ himself standing there with lights of the rainbow around him he was looking straight at me and he said deliver those people and he went away i thought well how could i deliver them i haven't got any strength to deliver them or i can't how could i break those bars so i said and you know i just said i spoke it out and said house of hell give way in the name of jesus christ and all of a sudden there was a creaking and a popping and rocks began to rolling and bars began to breaking and falling people running and screaming and shouting delivered delivered were delivered and they were screaming at the top of their voices and was all delivered hallelujah glory be to god my friends they were delivered in the name of jesus christ hallelujah amen how were they delivered by not by the strength of his arms not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord how are they delivered he found they couldn't do it with his natural strength before he could sink he heard himself what speak the word deliver those people house of hell give way to the name of jesus christ so how do we break satan's chains by the spoken revealed word of god hallelujah that's how you break satan's chains amen the lion of the tribe of judah shall break every chain and give to us the victory again and again glory be to god hallelujah amen so the spoken word breaks the chains hallelujah amen that means more of the sermons of the prophet that you hear and you receive it in your heart chains begin to fall off hallelujah the more you begin to read your bible every day faithfully chains begin to fall off i challenge you if you read your bible five minutes even every day hallelujah remember that brother uh brother gabriel read your bible even five minutes every day chains are gonna fall off listen to those sermons even five minutes every day chains are fully gonna fall off glory to god hallelujah listen to the audio sermons oh chains are gonna fall off from you amen hallelujah listen the sermons of revelated and anointed man of god and chains are going to fall off from you brother sister hallelujah i tell you that's the very truth because the message i know that what i'm preaching i'm preaching these messages right straight from the storehouse glory to god i'm preaching it from the storehouse for the glory of god and the bible tells us in the book of acts that even now while i am speaking back there while peter yet spake the holy ghost fell on all them that heard the word of god hallelujah and they were delivered by the power of god and if you're listening right now whether locally or internationally wherever you are may your chains fall off right now may there be a creaking and a popping may rocks begin to move and bars begin to break and may your sin your suffering be free from you be delivered in the name of jesus christ hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord god amen i tell you when we hold to god's word chains are going to fall off amen don't matter what you do sometimes we don't even realize chains are falling off until we in a situation say oh my how is that normally i would react a certain way but now i find i don't have that chain anymore i i'm free praise god i'm free i'm different than i used to be my life has been transformed by the power of god amen hallelujah i tell you deliver the people praise god in the name of jesus christ oh praise his marvelous wonderful name i want you to know brother sister that he is the same yesterday today and forever no matter what chain satan tries to hold you wet because you know the change in the bible change the circumstances chains of darkness amen chains of unbelief and you will go on down and the holy spirit can show you all those chains of tradition and stuff of that nature amen but remember revelation 20 verse 3 john said i looked and saw and i saw another mighty angel coming down from god out of heaven and as he came down in his hands he had not a chain but the great chain hallelujah he had a great chain in his hand and with that great chain he came and bound the dragon he bound the devil and all his works praise god hallelujah and reserve him for judgment amen brother sister i'm telling you that great chain is the word of god the revealed word of god is the great chain that that angel used to bind satan with praise god hallelujah amen because satan is always bound by what by the word of god the spoken word of god is what binds him and that of course is the name of jesus christ you see i didn't understand until the spirit made that clear hallelujah that another scripture out of revelation i believe it's revelation 19 he saw i saw a great multitude in the presence of god shouting hallelujah our god reigns hallelujah and the marriage of the lamb is coming so and then they saw this great another white horse rider riding on a white horse with the armies of heaven behind him hallelujah and when he was coming down then i heard the voice saying and his name is the word of god hallelujah he is king of kings and lord of lords amen the word of god is king the word of god is lord of lords the word of god rules over everything and his name is the word of god satan i rebuke you in the name of jesus christ then the holy spirit said you see people think it's just calling the name jesus there is many jesuses but the devil knows who knows when they say in the name which jesus you're talking about and saying it it's the revelation of the word you're rebuking him with you overcoming him by the word of god and your testimony you're overcoming him by the power of almighty god that's within the word of god hallelujah amen yes brother sister i'm so thankful that the devil is a defeated foe amen and his power is broken hallelujah oh praise god let me see i'm looking for i can just talk to you where the bible tells us the prophet says the whole chain the whole chain was broken there in the garden of eden the chain of the word in other places you will find where he says the word of god is like a chain it's hanging over him he uses the term other places how it's a chain and it goes in a circle amen and you can't break that chain for you not chains are broken at their weakest links amen praise god hallelujah so chain the chain of his word doors in a door you'll find it in there where he talks about the chain of god's word indictment he calls it he said not only is it the word but the chain of all truths praise god truth moves in a chain it goes from revelation genesis to revelation in a big circle and it goes round and round back and forth why it's eternal it can never change it's the same yesterday today and forever the word of god hallelujah amen praise god lean not to dine on understanding praise god let me just relax a bit here because i'm getting excited over what um i'm seeing here within the word of god but i want you also to follow me with what i'm saying here praise the lord he's speaking and lean not to thine own understanding you see this is from the beginning it is so plainly made known to us from the beginning that god gave his first family on earth his word to live by only his word was for them to live by now that's not through them eating just natural food and so forth but his word there were to live by it eternally as long as they kept that word they lived eternally but the first little phrase of that word was misplaced and just misplacing one little phrase of that word the whole chain broke and the human race then plunged right into death my the whole chain broke the chain of his word my praise god let me tell you something friends the word does two things whenever the word is preached or declared or comes on the scene even personally it does two things it blind sound and it casts light to the eyes of the of some others it always does that it blind some and open the eyes of some others not only does it blind but it binds some and it frees others up hallelujah when they receive the revelation of the living word of the living god listen to the scripture i shut and no man opens that's the word of god speaking and saying i shut and no man opens and when i open no man shuts praise god so the word will bind some blind some but will free up some and cast light on the word for others oh praise god we aren't you glad for this revealed word of god not just we thank god for the written bible but we thank god for the capacity the ingredient or that part of us that's able to read between the lines and to understand what he god is saying to us even though the words may not be literally written down there on the pages weekend yet understand what god is saying to us praise peter god hallelujah amen yes sir so therefore we understand therefore this is where when he shuts your eyes that's when that person comes under god's chains of darkness the darkness you're chained under those chains of darkness and there they're blinded and they can't see satan has his chains too and he brings darkness the darkness of ignorance the darkness of unbelief the darkness of tradition the darkness of denomination and he's brought that darkness sicker and thicker down through the church ages until this hour when there's a total blackout of the light and truth of the word of god hallelujah but god already had made a promise i will restore said the lord by zechariah the prophet god had said it shall be light about the evening time the path to glory you will surely find where the songwriters have in the waterway the word in the waterway is the light today buried in the name of jesus jesus who the word of god his name shall be called the word of god amen praise god hallelujah oh my think of it how marvelous and wonderful that we are a part of god's great economy and that he has delivered us in such a marvelous and wonderful and precious way amen praise god hallelujah let me tell you friends listen to him when god first set the human race on earth he told them to live by his word god's word is like a chain the whole is passing across hell with it and the chain is best is at its only at its best its weakest link god wants us to keep every word now that was the first of the bible just to break one word plunge the whole human race into the darkness of death amen what caused sin not just by a a point blank lie but because eve misconstrued the word the devil did that to her cause her to miscontrol one word one word broke that chain and refused to take one word that was the beginning of the bible in the center jesus said man shall live by not by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god the entire word you believe in other words that means the revelation of him amen man must live by every word flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father in heaven has revealed this unto you and upon this rock he said not just jesus amen not the church but the revelation of who he is that he is the almighty god the eternal father he is father son holy ghost bright morning star lilia the valley amen soon coming king he is the savior baptizer the mighty god amen yes sir when you understand that you realize what is really going on hallelujah you must believe the entire word of the living god hallelujah amen praise god i tell you brother sister he is the same yesterday today and forever and he does not change and i'm thankful to god for that that is the same yesterday and forever glory to god hallelujah amen now we also know that brother sister that he god always likes to give us a pardon a way out that we can escape because satan will keep you in his prison by chaining you chaining you by habits he'll chain you in every way sometimes some people can't act because of fear they're chained by fear they try to act and it's an invisible chain but they can't feel themselves moving from a certain spot in their life into another kind of consciousness another kind of awareness because they are chained because of fear some people are chained by sickness cancer they're chained by suffering they're chained by all kinds of things within their lives whatsoever amen hallelujah but thank god he promised that he would set us everyone free amen many years ago how many knows about abraham lincoln the great president of the united states and the story is told how he was walking to his lawyer's office and as he was walking he saw them selling slaves separating a family man woman and children being separated and sold separately to various people and he stood there and began to cry and he took his fist and he punched into the otter and said that's wrong and if there's a last thing i do i'm gonna hit that thing amen amen i'm gonna hit it and you know what he did he did hit praise god hallelujah and brought the people back from the condition with the great emancipation day as you many of you might know it hallelujah he brought it about with a great emancipation day but there's a greater deliverer that came and his name is not abraham lincoln his name is jesus christ hallelujah and he didn't just go and use politics to deliver you he went upon a pole and there he died for our sins shed his own blood brought you back by his a power of redemption the precious blood of christ and brought you back to him and set you free if you put your faith and your confidence in him jesus christ the word the word the revelation of his word praise god hallelujah oh my i tell you he loosed us from all manner of slavery that we could have had in our lives amen and set every one of us free praise god and i'm so happy for that that he is the same yesterday today and forever and god doesn't change and god doesn't lie amen now i'm preaching like this i'm telling persons they're free i'm telling you you're delivered if you can believe you are free but like i said a lot of people are chained they can't let go they don't know how to break the chain and all it is is saying give me your life completely let me the lion of the tribe of judah i'll break the chains i'll snap them chains off for you oh praise god hallelujah and brother branham tells it in this way in the form of a simple story here long ago a farmer had a corn field and crows kept coming by eating up his cone so he set a trap and he caught one of them he said i'll fix the rest of them real good and he tied the one that he caught by his foot to a fence and that puro crow began to hobble and jump and tried to fly and he couldn't get anywhere because he was tied up amen chains of darkness around the people tied them up amen and he got so he couldn't hardly fly or jump and the other crows would fly over and said come on johnny let's go south it's turning let's winter in winter you'll die setting out there in the cold so let's go south uh johnny and he said he tried to fly he can't he go back down he said i can't i can't you see i'm tied up how i can't do it and one day a good man came by and said poor old johnny gold crow look at him hobbling around he's getting rather weak so he caught the fellow petted him and patted him a little bit took that tight that latch off his foot like that and turned him loose and said you're free johnny all right johnny boy ready to go now oh my when he walked away that old crow just kept walking wrong in the same circle that he always used to walk he wasn't untied and yet he didn't know it the other cross came by and said come on johnny let's go south it's come in winter he said i can't i can't i'm tired but you're not tired he said but i'm tight you see but he was tied in his mind it was tiny in the soul right he was a prisoner and a chain with invisible chains and there's a lot of people that are chained with invisible chains of all manner of things within their hearts within their lives listen brother branham that's the way it is with men and women tonight you don't know they they don't know their position in jesus christ the devil may have tied you up with tb tied you up with some kind of a cancer on you he may have tied you up with many a habit but christ the good man has stood in your place at the judgment and now has set you free to amen god bless your heart rise up in the power of the holy ghost let's go south let's go south but let's not just go south let's go towards glory marching as a great army of the living god because you are free do you hear the others telling you come on let's go together i was once bound by a chain of sin but tonight i am cutting loose of that chain and i am free in the name of jesus christ can you say amen can you say glory can you say amen hallelujah i'm cutting loose praise god cutting loose in church yeah you need to cut loose praise god and give glory praise and honor to god who has set us free by the power of his word amen hallelujah i'm so thankful to god here oh my how wonderful i'm thinking my friends how many people are chained in the church by traditions how they're chained by the chains of darkness of organization but i'm thinking that god also has his prisoners of the chain to him and one of them as you know is a prisoner called paul and in that wonderful message speaking of this natural prisoner who japan was first a natural prisoner in caesar's prison because i've been there into rome and actually was in the prison where he was kept and i can tell you it's cold and damp it is very damp and that's the place that he was that's why he was no doubt calling for his cloak if you can just bring my cloak because it's cold and damp i went there in the summer and when you go down in there it still is cold and damp right and so he was enslaved in caesar's prison very symbolic of the devil putting people in a dungeon of sin and imprisoned them there but spiritually he was really chained by the holy spirit amen oh praise god he was chained by the great holy spirit of the living god my listen brother branham speaking here now we understand that paul could not do whatever he wanted to do because you see the spirit forbade him you remember many times paul tried to go someplace amen to get a great big meeting but the spirit forbade him it proves and clearly states that paul was a prisoner a prisoner of jesus christ harnessed to his word by the spirit of almighty god and we who are born slaves to jesus christ we also are slaves of the joy of jesus christ hallelujah i can't do without that joy of my salvation i'm a slave to that joy i'm so glad that i got shackles on me i got his chains on me for he has chained me away from the things of the world that i could become a slave to him jesus christ to serve him in love glory to god i my brethren brothers and sisters who are of light precious faith who have been born again by the holy ghost and that's had the blood of christ sanctify and cleanse you from the filthiness of the world to die daily to yourself crucifying yourself putting it away and becoming a slave a slave to serve god because we are here looking for a city to come from god out of heaven oh blessed be the name of our living god hallelujah amen aren't you glad that we serve a god like that brother sister amen that's the kind of god that we serve and we give him all the glory and the praise and the honor forever and forever praise god oh my god setting us free in every way that we might worship him that we might be prisoners of him and yet there are people out there that will get the pardon get the freedom get the offer to open your eyes to put eyes off to be able to see and they refuse the pardon they refuse the iso they refuse to help oh my and he tells the story of this mother this mother's boy had killed a man he was laying there ready to die and the little mother stood there by the governor's door and wouldn't move and they asked her in finally one of the guards said governor that mother of that boy is still out there and she wants to see you and when they opened the door they said to her madam the governor will receive you that poor little lady crawled on her hands and knees up to his feet laid her hands on his feet and said governor honorable sir your only man left that can spare my son please kind sir i know he is guilty your courts of justice have found him guilty he actually did kill that man and i know he is subject to death and that he deserves death amen if that is speaking of every single one of us here with our sins and the burdens that we carry i don't know but sir as a man you have no right to take the life of my boy for only god can give life and only god can take life see amen yes sir and only god can take life up like that see don't do it sir please don't i beg of you as the heart of a mother could bear and so he sent her away it broke the governor's heart so much pleading by that mother so he went down to the jail down to the prison are you following me where the boy was sitting in his cell in the prison and of course sitting in the prison that man that boy had built up a complex see you know what complex that is the whole world against you everything is against you that's the lie the devil tells people like that the world is against them just about like the church has done today got a complex you either preach it this way and then i like it if you don't preach it the way i want i won't hear it i i i will not pay no attention to it you know if you don't say it the way i like it right and just sat there man after man had come to him and tried to talk to him he had built himself up till he wasn't going to hear no more so the governor walked in just ordinary like said son i'd like to talk to you just dress the ordinary he said shut up and get out of here get out said son i really come here to help you right i told you before and i'm telling you again get out of here now and that's the way people do to the blessed holy spirit get out i don't want nothing to do with you and he knocks at their door saying if i do that i'll have to give up my card parties yeah if i if i ask the holy spirit in i'm going to give up card parties i'm going to have to give up my carousing my dancing my smoking my drinking everything i got to give up all them old things i have to give this up i have to give up my creeds oh my but you see he's the only one got a pardon right what are you looking for right now that's the way people do it and they chase away the governor well that man tried his best the governor tried to talk to the boy are you going to get out of here now if you don't get out of this cell now he said i am going to throw you out around and the man the governor turned around and said all right son i done the best i could and he walked out the boy looked around kind of arrogant and so on like that see i took care of him and he walked through down the hall and when he did one of the guards stopped him and stepped out and said oh governor did you do him any good and he said no sir he wouldn't even listen to me and the boy overheard he jumped and he grabbed the bars of the cell and he said who was that who did you say that was who do you say that was and the guard said that was the governor he came to pardon you too late he screamed and fell to the ground he said think of it the governor came right here in my cell to pardon me and i turned him down and when they put the rope around his neck before they put the black mask over his head after he had walked them last 13 steps the last words he said think of it the governor himself stood in my cell for pardoning and i turned him down and they hung him oh praise god but thank god there's more than a regular governor here today amen amen there's more than that jesus christ is here and that little cell that you're living in called man or woman amen the body in other words hallelujah that you may be living in praise god he's here to give you a pardon don't turn him away don't chase the holy spirit out don't tell him anything like that amen no wonder my friends uh i'm thinking of that old song that i love and i think you know it the holy hills of heaven called me the mansion's fair across the sea where loved ones wait and crowns are given the hills of home they're calling me bars of bone they hold my soul but this house of clay one day is gonna burst wide open hallelujah when the angel set my spirit free oh praise god you'll take your flight like a mighty eagle all for the hills of home are calling me oh praise god may you feel the pull and hear the call of god's holy spirit calling you to himself repent turn to god ask his grace his favor his forgiveness if you wonder you fell away return or you return your eternal disperse to your own amen nations are breaking let's all sing it israel's awakening finds that the prophets foretold gentile days numbers with horrors and cumber returned or disperse to your own why for the day of redemption is near so very near men's hearts are failing for fear oh be filled with god's spirit your lamps trim them clear [Music] look up your redemption is near false prophets are lying god's truth they're denying that jesus the christ is our god this generation spurns god's revelation but will walk where the apostles have trod do you mean it for the day of redemption is on there so very narrow man's hearts are failing for fear oh be filled with god's spirit your lamps clear look up your redemption is near look and live my brother live look to jesus now and live it's recorded in his word hallelujah see that you look and live one more time look and live my brother live look to jesus now and live is recorded in his word hallelujah [Music] it is only that you look and yes brother sister we're here now at the consummation of the ages we are here at the time of rapture time now the going home of the bride when she leave this earth and go into the presence of almighty god now listen close uh junction of time when satan will be bound at the pit then chained and he will be chained by a chain of circumstances created by the word of god that's me saying that now chain of circumstances created by the word of god that he cannot come out and deceive the nations no more and a thousand years millennium reign will take place on the earth while we are glorifying our lord jesus and adoring him we will crown him king of kings and lord of lords my friends everywhere the cry is going out they're crying out and asking my friends everywhere for revival but they're chained like legion they're chained on the chains of darkness the chains not in this cemetery but they're chained in the cemetery in the seminaries many of them their minds their hearts their soul chain they're on the chains of darkness amen and how are they going to have revival they want wanted revival in the day of samson and they couldn't get it because the very person and thing that would who was god placed him as a judge to bring them revival they chained it up they bound it unlike today they bound the holy spirit within the churches the true holy spirit not this fizzy fizzy uh you know bubble over the beer kind of holy spirit they're talking about just jumping around and you know that type of thing amen like the frog and the beer that you and it's gone but i'm talking about the spirit of god doing a deep work within the hearts and lives of his people amen you can't get that away from you amen listen from deceived church by the world while samson was bound we cannot have a revival while he is bound amen of course you know who what he's referring to there listen our loyal brother billy graham is out there screaming revival in our day all roberts out there screaming revival in our day the all the rest of them screaming out revival in our day how can we have a revival when you're bound in denomination bound in traditions bound in culture bound in false doctrine and you're covered in clouds of darkness i wouldn't even look for that quotation here where brother branham says don't you know the church is bound on the clouds of darkness he says clouds of darkness he said it's the teachers they're spreading lies clouds of lies in the minds and hearts of the people false doctrine contrary to the word of the living god he said satan got them out there he says handsome slickers he said get up in that pulpit my friends he said and they'll tell every lie every false doctrine as long as you will subscribe to whatever they are doing and take you away from the word of god back to the word of god hallelujah amen yes sir you're bound by the holy spirit your organizations your traditions you can't have a holy ghost revival how are you gonna have it amen because i know that that is scorching hot amen my god but it's the truth amen how can we have that holy ghost revival when you are so bound up and starchy how are you gonna have it having forms of godliness you will oh and denying the power of god the power of god you're not denying power of organization you're not denying the power of the world but they are the power of the church but you are denying the power of the holy ghost in the midst of the church that's the secret place when the church begins to adopt educated preachers begin to bow down to big buildings and finally instead of the old-fashioned holy coast they'd better be in that old mission again on the corner amen are you going to have a revival of the holy ghost people quench it and bound it and are afraid of it i think i have a note here i think it's kings 19 somewhere there tells the 16 to 19 tells the life story of samson and how he came as a call by a boy to be a nazirite a man and how later on he was chained as you know in the temple she tied him with ropes and twigs but when he got in the temple there they chained him up and all these dwarfs and little boys sticking him and pricking him and they brought him back in the temple amen but there he was standing there and you know you've seen it dramatized how he asked place my hands on the pillars the pillars of the doctrine show me the the foundations of the church all the pillar doctrines and the trinity is the pillar that they're all sitting on amen that's what they're sitting on he says just put my hands on it amen and the bible they snap off those chains he said brother brown said they forgot that while they had him chained up that his hair was growing back on his head he said seven locks amen seven ages seven laps the word being restored when those locks come back he snapped the chains and pushed down the pillars glory of god hallelujah and revival struck the land israel got hope because when the philistines got killed and destroyed the children of israel are able to rise up and take over take their position and their places as the people and the churn of god they freed themselves from the chains of darkness helplessness hopelessness and everything else my friends don't be hopeless don't feel helpless don't feel that all your hopes are lost don't give up but put your faith in jesus christ this message you might have been discouraged because a lot of ministers even of this message going off into all manner of fantastics all manner of psychology all manner of things but whole to god's unchanging word hold to his hand amen oh my the word is unchanging and it's unfolding it's like a roman candle it bursts goes to a higher level birth goes to a higher level birth goes to a higher level that's god's great fireworks going on right now stand to your feet while the musicians come let's give praise and honor and glory to god forevermore because he has broke the chains of darkness from off of me and i trust he broke the chains of darkness from off of you or for your mind over your life on off of your heart come to the light and christ will give you life praise god may you might not have heard it on this fashion you might want a real scholarly well a presented intelligent uh presentation and stuff like that but let me tell you god doesn't have it that way that kind of chocolatey gentle jesus image that they painted for you before you is a false image of the real christ he was rough he was rugged he was to the point amen hallelujah mighty god brother sister i'm thank god i'm free hallelujah i am free i don't have to worry about the thing because i put everything in his hands i placed my life in his hands all my needs is in his hands my health is in his hands you think i'm going to be more careful over my health than he is i put it in his hands and i rest at that amen oh my everything is in his hands all my needs amen you embrace god i mean you see i line up all my bills and i add up and when i look at the number i said father you're going to have to take care of this amen oh my but lord i can because with god's help i can and i will with god's help amen we will overcome no matter what the devil does to you amen you can be looking at everything else but god has given an order and the devil can only attempt to untest you for so much you think it's going to break you but it won't break you it's really making you it's really building you up it's not going to destroy you it's going to work together for your good it's going to build you up in the grace of god because even the sea he said i set a boundary for the sea it can't go further and when it goes to that point it has to go back and when your troubles come it can only come so much so much you feel like i'm dead i can't make it but god knows he said how much you can be tempted how much you can bear how much you can take and that's the way when you lift weights you strengthen your muscles when you feel it burning and you think you can lift it one more time and you hold on that's when the muscles start to build amen praise god so god is building you up in your most precious faith strengthening you to meet the challenge of this hour we got to meet more devils and demons than they ever did before and god wants his people to be pressurized for the journey ready my friends for the great flight amen not the flight from that thing over there in florida which they're doing a great job by science but the real thing when the spiritual astronauts sons and daughters of god will take their flight like mighty eagles oh praise god on the inspiration of the holy spirit of the living god we're going out to here brother you believe it brother as you come praise the lord god
