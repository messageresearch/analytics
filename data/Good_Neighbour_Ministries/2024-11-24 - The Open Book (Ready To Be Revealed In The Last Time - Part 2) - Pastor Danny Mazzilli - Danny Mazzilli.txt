morning we're excited about being here we're excited about the word of God Amen the word of God in this day and in this hour is transforming us it is changing us it is um doing things that you never even thought was possible that's the whole element of the mystery of the preaching of the word of God and why we need to assemble assemble yourselves even more as that day is approaching and that day is so quickly approaching Saints amen it doesn't take much to look around and see how the world is trans uh transforming around us amen and and prophecies being fulfilled Vindicated prophecies by modern events um we're we we've been given the eyes to see we've been given the ability to discern and to see what the word um is actually manifesting because of the spirit of Revelation that has been placed upon Our Lives amen praise God without that there's nothing amen glory to God so how many has a need this morning they want to say Lord remember me remember him remember her remember this situation father how privileged we are this morning Lord that we can assemble ourselves Lord into your presence where we know that Lord you you were here before we came this morning you were waiting you were you're anxious to be with us Lord and to fellowship with us and to allow your spirit to have the preeminence Lord from the very needs that are in our heart to the very preaching of your word Lord and we ask you to come this morning Lord you see every uplifted hand Lord you know every situation father as long as we're in this dimension of humanity oh God we will have needs Lord we will have circumstances and situations and Lord we there'll be hurts and pains and sorrows and sickness Lord but you said that I the Lord God I'm Jehovah Gyra I'm Jehovah sh I'm Jehovah Rafa I'm Jehovah Lord You Are God With Us and Lord we can claim every promise that comes with you being our Jehovah God not only are you uh with us but now you are in US Lord and that is the greatest Victory it's the it's the greatest mystery that's been hid from from before the foundations of the world that you want to unveil even today Lord so won't you come father make it more clear even to the youngest that's here this morning in Simplicity Lord may you speak Lord because we know you hide in that Simplicity oh God and Lord we're asking you to come and do a mighty work in each and every life those that are listening in online Lord speak to their needs oh God go and discern their lives and let them know that you are a living God that you're there's no time or space Lord everything is is taking place now and all we need to do is move into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Grant it father remember our former p Pastor who is traveling be with him and sister desire watch over them bring them safely home Lord we ask your blessing oh God on every single need in Jesus name amen and amen praise God God bless you Saints let's go to the word of God this morning amen we're going to continue um where we left off last week and um this morning we're looking at the open book praise God we we want to we want to uh see how this book is unveiling itself in this day and how the you know the the the Bible is the book but yet the Bible is hidden from from everybody that doesn't have the spirit of of Revelation upon them that's why this book is just a book it's just a Bible there's many people that are reading from it and there's so many different interpretations that are being uh brought out because of man's traditions man's ways man's understanding of how to interpret the word of God but we're not to interpret the word of God we are not to lean upon our own understanding we are to allow the Holy Spirit to come through the foolishness of preaching to minister the word and to unveil himself amen it's not about a minister coming here to unveil what he knows he doesn't know anything if he's truly called of God he's come into the into knowing him amen and that and that like brother brandom said listen I may not know all the science and all the understanding and all the way things work but you know but I do know the author of Life the author of life and that's what we are feasting on Amen praise God so let's read our first scripture this morning um Ephesians chap 1: 9- 11 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself so here we see clearly that there's a plan that he has within himself which he has purposed within himself but he has chosen you to be partakers of the mystery of his will he hasn't chosen everybody you who he has uh identified here will know who you are because you will be able to identify with the word amen that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ we're not Gathering all into one church building or all into one denomination or into one you know uh uh part of the world it's in Christ it's a supernatural mystical body it's the church that's being prepared in these last days to receive rapturing faith for a body change for the Rapture amen and he's got to bring us together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth and even in him so he's going to pull every single attribute every single one that he knew from before the foundations of the world whether they've gone beyond this Dimension they've lived their lives through the other Church ages they gave their lives for this gospel but they were identified attributes of God because God lived through them manifested through them fulfilled his word through them that's why Luther could break away from the Catholic church and say the just shall live by faith he received Revelation that I need a personal walk with God I need to know him personal amen and that's that's what he's doing in this day still the same in whom also we have obtained an inheritance glory to God being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the councel of his own will this is all about his last Testament will Hallelujah are you going to hear your name this morning have you heard your name being called to The Inheritance God bless you may be seated Hallelujah glory to God let's read the next slide brother Bram speaking here now God's great mystery from Christ The Mystery of God revealed on how it's a secret he's kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when that seventh seal was open there was silence Hallelujah Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't even know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of a half hour it was around 28 minutes that uh the the the great Cloud showed up in 1963 just about a half an hour it showed itself amen praise God hallelujah amen 28 miles high there was there you know people will not realize what has already taken place in this day and in this hour this mystery that we're talking about that God is unveiling through his word his his will his purpose his plan is not something that is into the distant future a lot of people are always putting his word into the distant future he's going to do this he's going to do that and they feel to recognize what he's doing now and what he's already done even the son of man don't know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was a there was silence in heaven for the space of a half hour and seven thund ERS uttered their voices and John was forbidden to write it see the coming of the Lord what was the seventh seal what was the opening of those Seven Seals what was it when when that seventh seal was open and there was silence in heaven it was the coming of the Lord back to the Earth that's what the opening of the seventh seal represented amen you you see it here it was it it was the coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't no he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible so remember last week when we were reading and talking about if you don't see Jesus Christ from Genesis to Revelation you've missed Christ you if you don't see Christ in every scripture in every life that was lived in every one that was manifesting the spirit of God and the will of God and the ones that would say thus sayeth the Lord hear ye the word of the Lord that was Christ that was Christ condescending coming down moving through the Old Testament IM morphan himself we're going to be looking at that this morning because the book's been open amen everything's been revealed a lot of people don't realize what's been revealed and they they they sit in this this um almost unconscious realization of what is actually going on they sit in the message they believe the message I go to a message church I identify with a you listen that doesn't make you a part of the body of Jesus Christ there are things that will happen within message churches that will shock you and you'll wonder well wait a minute how can this possibly happen in in a church that believes William brandom as their prophet and believes that that that the Seven Seals were open and that the the Mighty God has come down and and yet there's this unbelief there's this in uh this this stubborn uh spirit that's not willing to go beyond the boundaries of you listen only to the tapes you you you if you don't listen to the tapes and and you don't say exactly what William brandham said you're lost they're putting Christ out of the church again and they don't know it we can't do that you're going to come to see as we come you know I don't know how far we're going to get today you pray you believe God will speak to you whatever situation where you're at whatever circumstance whatever uh God is dealing with you he's he's moving you along okay he's pressing us all along he's progressing his word within each and every one of us we need to see where God has you know where God has us today so that we can see where we're going amen praise God and so go to the next slide let's continue in the same uh quote he says therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ the entire Bible That's why brother Braham says when he came to start this message on Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says I'm going to take the T I'm going to take the title Christ The Mystery of God revealed but it is going to Encompass the entire Bible because Christ The Mystery of God is going to be revealed and it's being revealed he from the start Genesis all the way to Revelation amen the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose how many purposes one one one purpose because that one purpose we're going to come to see that oh my goodness are you kidding me you mean that's what it was all yeah that's you're going to see he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been a type and expressing what God's Great goal is and now in this last day brother brandham was saying that back in 1963 I'm telling you in 2024 in this last day Hallelujah glory to God Amen he has revealed it and shows it and God's help we'll see it right here this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it glory to God Saints I'm telling you this is glorious this this word will never stop unveiling itself people don't realize they get behind the pulpit and they just want to quote quote quote quote but they don't want to allow the the mind of God to come into the midst of the preaching of the word word to speak lip to ear to to Sons and Daughters of God to awaken them out of their their their Amnesia that that that they find themselves in they get more confused by listening to some preachers than they do anything else especially if you are an attribute of God you can only respond to the Deep call that's why when when people were talking to you about the word of God you were wondering ah I don't know you know well you got to come to the Baptist Church you got to come to the Pentecostal Church boy in the Pentecostal Church they'll get you speaking in tongues and if they can get you speaking in tongues you got the Holy Ghost you're going to be saved you can go back and live any way you want you're going to be saved they don't realize that when you receive the Holy Ghost it's God in you amen it's God in you and and let me tell you when Jesus Christ came to the Earth there was a disturbance there wasn't a great following oh praise God there he is is the Messiah hallelujah praise God no sir they said this guy's causing trouble and when you get filled with the Holy Ghost and the word of God starts to live through you and starts to point back to the word and starts to identify baptism in jesus' name God had no such thing as a trinity God from before the foundations of the world what took place in the Garden of Eden the serpent seed the opening of the word all these things people start saying this is mumble jumble this person speaking in tongues that's the real tongues that's the real not not this mumble jumble where there's no interpretation Paul said listen if there's no interpretation quiet amen you come subject to the spirit of the Lord let the Holy Spirit speak to your needs and to the situations and let him tell you what his will is his purpose his plan not your will not my will even Jesus himself had to come subject to the will of God at the Garden of Gethsemane and he had to separate from that vessel and be so that he could be all man going to the Cross there had to be a sinless spotless sacrifice and it had to be in the form of a man we're going to look deeper into that there's so much in there glory to God Amen the time of your word is now coming into manifestation am Jesus was the word for his day William brandom was the word for his day this bride there's a church there are individuals a many membered body that has a word for her day and we need to come into that aspect because it's there that we receive rapturing Faith it's there that we get perfect Faith to know who we are it's there that we recognize what to do with the word a minister that gets up here doesn't really know who he is and all he's doing he's quote and quotes reading scriptures without an understanding that the mighty Angel himself is in the midst speaking to hearts and lives calling some out calling some Eagles and calling some buzzards because this word is going to separate it's the hour of manifestation that's why do not be surprised when you hear things within the boundaries of this message you hear things and you oh my God is that possible of course it's possible the rain falls on the just and the unjust the pale horse rider is riding right into the message of the hour how could it be so deceiving that it would deceive the very elect think about that how could it be so deceiving that it would deceive even the very elect if it was possible unless it was really deceiving really deceiving yes and the only way it's going to be really deceiving is going to be a brother or sister that could be sitting right next to you claiming oh hallelujah praise God and yet what comes out of their mouth is not Revelation it's not Revelation it's confusion they don't realize what they're speaking they oh yeah God sent a prophet yeah yeah yeah yeah God sent a prophet well what about God sending the Holy Ghost in This Day and in this hour what about the word for your day because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and when you receive the word in your day that's God that's God speaking to you and you turn around and say no I don't need that you better surrender you better check yourself you better not be looking to man you better be looking to the holy spirit amen let's go on here listen go to the next scripture in Psalms 105 I'm going use this as an example talking about David here he says moreover he called for a famine he's talking about the Lord upon the land he break the whole staff of bread he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they hurt with feathers he was laid in Iron until now listen careful here until the time that his word came now you could read that in a couple ways and you'd both and they both be right because there's a time for Joseph's word your word and his word and when his word and your word identify and they match up a deep call to the Deep it's the word amen it's the word manifest in your day it's the word manifesting in this hour showing God is now going to do something and look what he did he says until the time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him you've been wondering why you've been going through all the battles oh I've been in the message for 30 years and oh my God I'm going through the worst Battle of my life yeah yeah because you're still in that flesh you're still weak in human flesh and until you get to a place where you realize this thing is your enemy you will you will fall under subjection to the Flesh and you will allow that to manifest where God wants to manifest his word he's trying you he's testing you he's trying to see how much of you is willing to die because until you completely die completely die I know nothing I I I just want to be you know I just listen when when when when the sons of God when you go back and and recognize when when even when doubting Thomas here Jesus comes into the room and and and and he's making himself known as the word now in the resurrect he's been resurrected he's in his theophany and he's he's unveiling himself to the to the other Apostles and Thomas says no I don't believe it I don't believe it but the moment that Jesus said Thomas something quickened within him he says don't you see my my my my my uh handprints you know he says come here you want it doesn't say that he actually went and didn't no it says that he felt prostate and he worshiped the Lord he says oh Jesus Hallelujah he recognized because God called his name God woke him up to realize who he actually was and until that time that season comes into your life you won't know even Mary Mary goes to the Grave after the resurrection she goes there and somebody uh have you seen him have you seen him since he has risen meanwhile it was him self and the moment that he said Mary she went R but but until then she was blinded she didn't recognize you see there's a time and a season for every one of us amen the word is going to come to you at his appointed time and it's not going to be an open display that's what the seventh seal is all about it's all about him coming to you coming to you in your placing in your part of the word so you can awaken to the recognition of what God is doing now in you as a part of the local Body of Christ because he has a purpose for you being here amen glory to God hallelujah and so look he goes on he says until the time that his word Tried Him the word of the Lord Tried Him the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and let him go free you see what happens after being tried look and read the word like we're drawing things out of here that the Lord is trying to unveil himself to you when you are tested and you are tried he comes to set you free he comes to place you look what he did he made him Lord of his house oh God thank you Jesus when God tries me and tests me and has you know gets all that stuff out of me that he needs to get out of me he's going to make me Lord in my house where I'll be respected in my own house where God will show that that that he is with his word that he is with his people he he'll vindicate you don't you try to vindicate yourself I am this I am that don't you know who I am don't you know who I am you better hope God knows who you am Hallelujah that's what that's the reality where look Joseph he humbled himself all he did even when he was in bonds and he was in prison he was the best prisoner in the prison yeah he was showing that God was in him they were looking at him they say my God this man he goes through this trial that trial this situation that situation but he keeps rising up and when he rises up God just uses him again God just places him in right there and right back into his rightful position Oh Glory to God and gives him everything that he has need of and and and look he says and he made him Lord of his house and ruler Over All all his substance glory to God let me tell you when you get to a place where you allow the spirit of God to have you totally and completely and he can trust you he can trust you with his Secrets he can trust you with his words you're not miss gossip or Mr gossip the minute you hear something you got to let somebody else know you want to be the bearer of of of news all the time thinking oh I know I'll tell you something God don't want that God wants to be able to seek character and wisdom and direction in that life to where it's yielded and so surrendered that if he doesn't show him anything doesn't say a word we say nothing we allow the Holy Spirit to speak when he needs to speak deal with circumstances that he needs to deal with when he does it it's perfect every time glory to God to bind his princes at his pleasure and to teach te his Senators Oh Glory to God God will give you wisdom and understanding to direct and guide whatever it is that that he's placed into your hands as a son or a daughter of God you wonder why you prosper in your financial Adventures why you prosper in your in your health why you prosper in your relationships because you have allowed the spirit and the character of Christ to have the preeminence over you to control you to give you understanding and to show that by Revelation you understand what it means to give you understand that it's Jehovah Gyra that gives you your job until you get to a place to understand that it's Jehovah Gyra that gives you your job you're going to be looking for jobs that fit you oh no I don't want that job come on now oh no I'm too good for that I'll wait for this but meanwhile God wants you there for a purpose so that he can get you there with the wisdom but a lot of people want to go there with no wisdom and before you know it they're out the door because they are not allowing the spirit of Jehovah Gyra to control their lives they receive money however they get it wherever it comes from an attribute Son of God will know that that finance that money came from him because they've made him Lord don't tell me you've made Jesus Christ Lord and somebody says you should be paying your tithes and you and you Rebel you have not made Jesus Christ Lord you don't trust him as Jehovah Gyra you don't believe that he's going to provide all your needs you don't believe the word that says try me and see if I don't open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing on you that you won't even be able to contain because you gave by Revelation Oh Glory to God let me tell you we want to walk with God don't we if you want to walk with God and you want to experience the the the great things you got to do the small things you got to you got to come back to your ABCs and and know that you're really believing what you confess to actually believe glory to God Amen Hallelujah so God will do all of these things he'll make you ruler over your house he's conveying his word unveiling the mystery in you you see you're a part of the mystery although Christ is the mystery but you're in Christ so a part of you has got to be unveiled a part of you has got to be uh you know uh sealed and and got to be unsealed because we tend to come into the house of the Lord and we've become a part of the body and we don't want to allow God to go in and unseal Our Lives because there's things in there that you got to get rid of there's circumstances that are sealed under that first seal or that second seal or that third seal you go back you'll see what they all represent you know they all repres one represented War because you know in in in some of you there's an attitude of war and that Seal's got to be broken off your life and you that Spirit of rebellion that constantly has to have the last word has to say no this is the way it is instead of surrendering to the Holy Spirit allowing the spirit of God to unveil you remove these things because when he does that you know what it's going to show Christ it's going to show him and somebody's going to see and say I can say that this person has been with Jesus I know that this person has been with Jesus I can see the the the the the compassion in them I can see them they can they can cut but they immediately know how to mend in the right way you see God has placed his his servants in such a way that they will not hinder bruise it will not it will not uh um you know hinder it will not muzzle the oxx amen that's threshing out the corn if you're somebody that's that's supporting the ministry and that you're doing it and you and you know and sometimes it's a little more difficult to make that tithe payment but yet you go beyond that and you and you and you do it God just pours out blessing upon you it you know it's never easy nothing is easy when it comes to serving the lord Satan's going to do everything in his power to stop you he's going to throw a an automobile build right into your face your transmission's gone H Hallelujah that that that shouldn't stop you from coming to church if your transmission's G then you just take a uber prise God because you're going to hear what you're going to hear something from the Lord that's going to tell you exactly why he's going to take care of that transmission repair and how he's going to take care of it I don't care how he's going to take care of it I don't need to know how he's going to take care of it I just believe it and I believe I need to be in the house of the Lord so I'm going to go there and he's going to speak to me he's going to meet my needs because I believe the word amen let's go to the next scripture 2 Thessalonians because you got to realize here that when you come to a place where you believe that word you become a carrier of that word you become the word in your day all of a sudden now what you say and what you live and what you manifest around the other people can draw in that last one can can bring others to Christ can bring them out of their bondage can bring them out of their situations whatever ever they might be Thessalonians 17-10 and to you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels did we not say in 1963 the mighty Angel Christ himself himself that that cloud was was the white wigged Jesus Christ the one that was from the beginning the Elohim the the self-existent one but he was imorph in himself coming into man form again amen praise God and here he was he revealed us inflaming fire taking Vengeance now listen those that are going to say ah it was just jet fuel I don't believe it God what Jesus come already yes he's come already he's here right now he's opened his word the book has been opened a lot of people are reading from a closed book even though it's open they don't understand that that book is sealed to them unless God opens it to them it wasn't until listen on the road to EMAs Jesus was walking with them talking about himself a lot of people are out there priest talking about Jesus talking about the Lord but it wasn't until Jesus himself broke the bread and their eyes were open it's it's still going to take Christ to come to you personal right now you young people you're hearing brother brother Danny you're saying oh my goodness these quotes and the word and this is just just sit there don't worry let the Holy Spirit speak to you at some appointed time he's going to break the bread of life he's going to break the seal upon your life and all of a sudden it's going to make sense you're going to say holy Hallelujah I I got to get to the baptismal tank glory to God I got to get rid of this old life that's on me this old life that's been uh it's weighing me down you know I I here I you mean I've been around the message for that long I've been so rebellious I didn't want to I'm not getting baptized I'm not going to be one of those freaks go to get baptized and show myself in front of the people no if you've got that kind of attitude stay as far away from that tank as you can stay because going to take the Holy Ghost when it comes upon you and it strikes your heart and God opens your life opens your seal unveils who you really are that you're not just the son of so and so that you you weren't just born into this world to just live so many years and die but you were born to be a manifested son or daughter of the Living God hallelujah amen glory to God so here he goes on he says now in flaming fire taking Vengeance on them that know God that know not God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ I'm telling you there's no other gospel out there that's going to bring Salvation that's going to bring a body change that's going to take them out of the Great Tribulation but the Gospel of Jesus Christ I'm making that declaration in the name of the Lord and there's no other gospel but the Gospel of Jesus Christ you want salvation you need to come and and and identify yourself with Jesus Christ and if you identify yourself as with Jesus Christ he will look at you and he will say I knew you you when you were under the tree like he said to Nathaniel And you you know me I remember when he when he did that for me and I said me you mean you mean you know me he says before you were even born I knew you he says remember this you remember that remember this situation remember that situation how do you think you got out of that situation why do you think I kept you from from this and kept you listen you go look back on your own lives amen I can only look back on my life and I can only see that he was there he was protecting not Danny misilli he was protecting the word that was placed in Danny missil because he knew at some point in time that word would have to manifest and it was not just some small part of the word listen don't think that you because you're sitting in the pews and you're saying amen and you might be the door cleaner cleaner or the mat keeper or the washroom cleaner that you are not just as important to the word and to the body and to the will and to the purpose of God as a minister because when it all comes down to it it's Christ the mystery not you the mystery you as being a part of the mystery but it's Christ that's being revealed Hallelujah and he goes on he says and these people that disb believe the word that are going to reject it in you and and when they hear it their punishment for rejecting Christ just like you go back into the Old Testament when the when the spirit of God came on Jeremiah and went to those kings they were Kings and said thus sayeth the Lord jeim son of uh you know so King King uh so and so if you do not turn away from your evil ways God is going to destroy this city God is going to wipe out you guys are going to be hit with pestilence you're going to be hit with all kinds of disease well the world is entering into listen we've already experienced it I don't know about you but there's pestilence on the earth there's disease on the earth you want to thank God for the hedge of the holy spirit in your life Hallelujah that you can be sealed until the day of your Redemption and that God keeps you God provides for you listen but the world is still going on there's Wars that are going on right now there's things that are heating up between Russia and the US and and Ukraine and so many things going on right now that are heating up in the background people don't realize these are the seeds for nuclear war the Bible talks about wo wo World War I World War II and it says World War three for behold this Earth as an oven shall Burn Right but thank God he sent Elijah Oh Glory Hallelujah thank God he sent Elijah first because this Earth is going to be cursed it's already been cursed by the by the Fall because man when the when man fell not only did Adam and Eve fall but the Earth fell too into a a cursed condition and now that's why we're getting all these natural birth pains upon the Earth every year there's another hurricane that's worse than the last another storm that's worse than the last another earthquake that's worse than what what is it Saints it's the Earth in birth pains but it's all going to be restored for 1,000 years of Peace glory to God now when but listen he goes on here Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power when he shall come to be glorified in his saints come to be glorified in his are you putting that way off somewhere I hope not he's already in his Saints he's already secretly coming to brother Chris brother Jack brother Gabe sister soul sister this brother he's already coming slowly and he's catching you snatching you out of the worldall he's already come and they don't know it he's already manifesting himself in the Saints they're the ones listen listen here and to be admired in all them that believe because of our testimony among you believed you mean you mean I believed gab's testimony and that Drew me to this he didn't have to go to the lengths of oh God did this God did that all he had to do is speak because there was a word of logos in his attribute that spoke out when he said are you a Christian that wasn't God saying are you a Christian God was saying come my son it's your time it's your season it's the hour of your word of my word to be manifest in your life that's what God was doing you see we become the word we become care barers of the word we're not conscious of it you don't have to be conscious of it but you're going to be conscious of it because coming into the fullness of the revelation of who you are in the word of God entitles you to the Rapture it quickens you it'll Quicken your mortal body it'll transform you this Mortal shall put on immortality don't look at the fact that you look in the mirror and you say oh more wrinkles you get up in the morning oh got to stretch a little more I can imagine how Abraham and Sarah were feeling when that change started to come upon them Hallelujah it may have taken so many years on them but I'm going to tell you it's going to happen in the twinkling of an eye in a moment you're going to be changed you're going to all of a sudden one morning sometime you're going to feel a quickening power it's going to come in you I don't know if you've ever experien it in your dreams you ever have dreams where you can fly yeah oh yeah those are not just regular dreams those are you in your theophany in your in your word body your Eternal Body oh my God I when I have those dreams and I see a wall in front of me and I'm moving and I just go and it's the feeling I I can't even describe it to you it's unbelievable it's like oh man this this is incredible Glory boom land on the other side just keep going there's not you can't be held back what is that that's who you really are that's who you really are that's what you're going to if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved I have another one waiting glory to God it's just going to be right there it's going to have no sickness no sorrow no pain no jealousy no no no heartache no broken heart no nothing it's going to be a perfect perfect perfect body that is going to be so Supernatural that you can't even fathom it glory to God because of your testimony others receive this word you see the day we're living in you see how important it is for us to receive the word allow the word to test us deal with us perfect us so that we can have a real testimony amen and that real testimony will affect others it others will believe because of your testimony because the word transforms it it transfers because it's all him it's all about him amen praise God hallelujah let's move on here Ephesians chapter 3 8-9 unto me who am less than the least of all the saints is this Grace given you mean the words come to me and I I I I I'm I'm I'm unveiling the mystery of God yeah you are that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ you know that you're all Ministers of the word of God when you've received the Holy Ghost your testimony as a woman as a housewife you know your your testimony the way you dress the way you handle yourself the way you talk the way you respect your husband and and the way he respects you shows the spirit of Christ the reality of Jesus Christ the word amen hallelujah should be preached among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the true mystery The Fellowship of the mystery is not sitting with somebody and fellowshipping over the Serpent's Seed and arguing whether it was an apple or whether it was an adultery because I'll tell you something when those seals were open and the Word was unveiled under those Seven Seals it unveiled the mystery read it Revelations 10 1-7 the mystery of Christ should be revealed not Mysteries but there's things in that mystery that needs to be unveiled and when you see what the true mystery of Christ is how it was important to see and to recognize what God was doing back in Genesis in Adam and in Eve and then you start to identify and see what's going on all the way through down from Genesis all the way you start to you start to fall the you start to follow the trail of the serpent then you won't have to be convinced of what happened back in the Garden of Eden you won't have to be convinced that it was a serpent that that had committed sex with Eve that it was not some snake but it was an upright being then you'll see we're going to be looking a little deeper into it don't let me get ahead of of myself here he says here which this mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God in Christ this was hidden in him from before the foundations of the world remember he wanted to express himself and this is the great mystery it's all it's this great mystery you're going to come to realize it's all in in relation to man this great mystery is all in relation to man we we we don't realize why is it that we are man why why is it that we had to come into human form that that that was in the form of man because God hid in that mystery of man we're going to look at it we're going to we're going to keep moving through here and just see how the Holy Spirit reveals it and makes it more clear even to me because while I was studying this and reading and and and and listening I was I was rejoicing listen you think that I go and spend a 100 hours a week trying to figure all of this out are you out of your mind I can't do that I don't even have the physical strength to do that it's a I got to feed on the word I got to go listen to other ministers because I believe there's ministers what what you think God is only speaking here God is speaking in his body all over the world there are ministers that have the Holy Spirit that have God in them they're they they're ministering the word of God and they catch a thought like me I'm listening to this Minister and all of a sudden boom all these thoughts start poting into my mind not only am I hearing what he's saying I'm hearing what he's telling me just like this morning my wife heard me I was rejoicing she heard me rejoicing you know in in in the uh in our bedroom I was re she goes what are you Hallelujah about I said God's unveiling something to me right now it's it's glorious he's showing me how this word progresses and moves from one to the other to the other and how it's bringing in the fullness of the body of Christ and how it's drawing the the the sons and daughters together I I was listening to this Minister and all of a sudden now this scripture comes alive to me over here you know in in in Thessalonians because all of a sudden what he's preaching and the Revelation that God is unveiling through him it's not his Revelation it's God in him it's God speaking through the body it's the five-fold ministry that's why we we get excited when when when a minister comes through here and he's yielded to the spirit of God and he has a Ministry on him you know that it's not his ability to memorize quotes and and pick out quotes and identify this and that listen if I don't listen to other ministers that are feeding on the word and that have come and surrendered themselves where am I going to get fed from I get fed because faith comes by hearing the word and God chose the foolishness of preaching God will speak as we're ministering the word here God will speak right back to us he'll speak to me he'll inv certain things and sometimes you'll hear it and you'll say oh well that was fresh hallelujah praise God God just showing himself in the midst of the five-fold ministry how he's building this body how he's adding to the church you think oh I'm going to go to that church I feel L I just want to go to that church you know there's there's individuals that are moving right now there's there's there's things going on right now within the body of Christ they got it all they're doing is they're being led by the spirit amen and God will confirm your move God will vindicate why you are supposed to be here in such a time as this because there's a portion of word in you that needs to find its place needs to get into its rightful position so that it can fulfill God's purpose his will his desire this is what we read at the beginning it's his will his purpose that's what we want because his will and his purpose is to change you to transform you to translate you and we as ministers we can only unveil words words God chose the foolishness of words to preach his gospel but he chose his Spirit to open and to break the bread of life to you personal that's why the letter kills but the spirit brings it alive it gives you confidence to know I'm serving God this is not something I put on this is not something that I'm trying to do I'm trying to make myself something I want to be nothing Lord Jesus the more that I see this this gospel in the way that he's this is all about him we can't get in his way we got to let him have his way we got to allow him to speak to the very needs and the hearts and the call and place and to do what he's got to do I don't want my own ideas oh I think this brother's you know he's got this you know he he'd be good to do this and that I wait on the Lord God will work at both ends yes God will make it clear what exactly their position is they got to just sit still and wait on the Lord that's all they got to do and God will do it because he's got a purpose and a will for each and every attribute of God you can't miss this if you wanted to miss it because he's given you the unsearchable riches of his word who created all things that are hidden God and who created All Things by who but wait a minute I thought God in the beginning created all things but this says Jesus Christ created all things exactly brother Gabriel Jesus is only a name Jesus is only a a a a way that we identify him in his sunship in his in why he had to come as a son of man right because he's he's quoted as the second Adam who was the first Adam Jesus Christ when God expressed Adam onto the Earth do you know that Adam was the lowest form of God at that point Hallelujah Adam was made in the lowest form of God's thoughts when he expressed him on to the Earth in the form of a man man is the lowest form of God don't think man is because Jesus came as a man that that makes him the highest form no no the highest form is Elohim the self-existent one the one who sat on the throne the one with supreme authority Hallelujah glory to God you're going to see this we're going to be looking at all this let's let's move along here there's no way we're going to get through all of this today but praise God let's Rejoice around the word of God let's go to the next scripture we're going to look at here how the condens uh condescension took place how God em morphed himself how he's doing it now and in this hour and how you are an attribute word of God you're your your your your time has come your word the the season for you has come you need to come to realize that there's got to be a time where you realize hey wait a minute here I've been going to church for so many years I've been I I believe I believe this message I believe that this is is going on but wait a minute here I want more of God if you don't want more of God you need to get back on your knees because this Revelation is never going to stop that's what makes him Eternal how how in the world can you be as ex more excited about the word today than you were when you came in how is that because he's unveiling himself now person personal doing things in your life that nobody else can do it you know it's God and if you're not experiencing that then get closer by by by consecrating yourself reading the word of God being in the house of the Lord more often being in the in the word listening to the messages listening to brother brandham listening to the voice of God speak in all areas of your life amen glory who in the days Hebrews let's go to the next scripture was that the next scripture yes Hebrews 57 to10 who in the days of his flesh he talking about the Lord when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from Death he's talking about his experience in the garden do you know that Jesus Christ in the form of a man had to learn obedience in this world had to overcome The Temptations the same way that you overcome them because he's overcome them for you by him overcoming them and then taking them to the Cross he settled it once and for all so that you don't have to carry that that condemnation anymore you you there's things you've done in your life and you can't go back and you can't reverse it but he can by his word he can say you're Justified as though you never done it who was able God Jesus knew that all he had to do was just look to himself he's God he could change anything but he would not go against his own word and that's why you can trust him that's why you can take him at his word you can stand there you can let every storm go by you can let every bullet go by it's going to miss you it has to miss you if God's got a purpose for you there ain't a sickness in hell that can bring you down as an attribute of God he's got to fulfill that purpose in your life amen glory to God save him from death and was heard in that he even feared oh God imagine that so don't think it's wrong that you know you know that you can't fear you fear we're human but know that he's the one that said fear not listen to that voice that that that that can can overcome that situation that you're being held into anxiety about you might be facing situations right now and there's anxiety around your life you don't know what to do you're just you you're just wondering well I'm just going to say you lean not upon your own thoughts your own uh you know lies that will come to your mind the enemy is going to try to lie to you that's his job the greatest battle that you will ever fight will be right between your your ears whether you're going to believe the word or you're going to believe the enemy I did this to you I'm going to destroy your life I'm going to take you I'm going to mess you up I'm going to make you asham I'm gonna do this and all of a sudden you're you're you're believing that those lies and anxiety starts to come upon your life and you you feel surrounded I'm telling you God says be still and know that I am God believe that I can deal with it believe that that if you trust me with all of your heart then I'll make a way for you because his word cannot return void and if he's placed a portion of his word in you that word's got to come Jesus said all that the father hath given me will come not one of you will be lost don't fear he took that fear to the Cross he pinned it right there and he says it's finished Hallelujah and was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered so if Jesus Christ had to suffer through Temptations and through situations and had to become obedient to those situ oh no I'm I got God in Me God's going to overcome everything in me the first thing that he's going to overcome is you your pride your thoughts and your ideas of how you think it ought to be you need to take our Lord as a sample and as an example that he had to come under obedience he had to submit himself to the word of God to what God had ordained in him would place in him to fulfill his word amen glory to God and here he says and and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation in other words this salvation that he that he authored it there's no end to it so if you're saved you're not going to be lost hallelujah it's Eternal your salvation had no beginning it's going to have no end because you were in him amen this is what you're going to come to realize this is the the the the mystery of Christ this the thing that he kept hidden right from the right right from the beginning of the world you when we come to it you're going to say what that's what it was yeah is as simple as that God hides himself in Simplicity and he reveals himself in the same way he doesn't change that's the beauty of knowing him and he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey you mean you don't only need to believe but you actually need to obey yeah people don't want to come under obedience to the leadership even in the church they don't want to some people they I don't need a pastor I'm just fine I I don't need pastors meanwhile it's part of the fivefold ministry so you don't need Ephesians chapter 4 then is that what you're saying I don't need evangelists I don't need I don't need this I don't need that no no no you do need it more than the fact that you're saying it tells me you need it even more because this revelation is Christ and he says we need to recognize and come under subjection and obedience to him we're not coming under obedience to man but God places Kings for a purpose God places them in their Thrones and God removes them from their Thrones am and once we come to realize that then we just need to understand that like David when Saul was after his own life and God gave Saul right into his own hands David he could have just slid his throat right there he brought him right into the cave was standing over him while he was sleeping but David knew do not touch my anointed if Nebuchadnezzar you want to go back and read it in in in Jeremiah I'm going to send Nebuchadnezzar my servant my servant and he's going to take you all captive he's going to destroy man woman child that doesn't that doesn't hearken unto my word and I'm going to take them out and bring them into Babylon for 70 years of captivity oh yeah God uses anybody he brings he puts those people into those positions they might be there for a short time for a a long time for whatever time but you come subject to Christ the word and his word once you obey that word and you submit to that word you open up every spiritual blessing that is rightfully yours you could be gifted you could be gifted in so many different ways but a spirit of Disobedience not willing to submit will keep that gift locked up and ineffective you wonder why why why am I not feeling the joy of the Lord why am I not feeling the blessings of God why am I not feeling you know anointed to to to do the things that I'm doing if you're doing service unto the Lord in the house of the Lord if it's genuine Revelation you're doing it with the joy of the Lord while you're doing it it's the joy of the Lord it becomes your strength to actually do it if you're if you're miserable oh they're leaving early no they're going to leave me to do it all don't look at that don't pay attention to any of that do your part amen and all of a sudden God's going to send you helpers all of a sudden God it's even at work it's the same thing you go to work and you're working there and you know the other guys are hiding and they're letting you do it all that's okay I'm going to do it all but one of these days I'll be telling you what to do I I've seen it happen I've experienced it okay that's why I tell you you go to work do more than what you're being paid for amen you'll get paid more than what you're doing one of these days amen glory to God there's a saying and I'm going to say it again you do what you got to do when you got to do it the time will come that you can do what you want to do when you want to do it think about it somebody told me that one day and I said that makes a lot of sense because I want to do what I want to do when I want to do it isn't that your desire glory to God we do more we get blessed more and that's how we should look at being a part of the body and and edifying one another and and being somebody that's an encourager that's always looking to encourage to build up to strengthen don't worry the Holy Spirit has deacons and and uh individuals that will correct and deal with circumstances and situations and if you stay submited to God go when that correction comes you will rejoice you will not Rebel you get brought into the office you get corrected you get dealt with situations this and that the following week don't see you anymore the week after don't see you anymore you know what that tells me you're more rebellious than you were when you were in the office because you're not willing to submit to God it's not man that we submit to it's to the Holy Spirit remember this is all about building character God wants to seek character in us because he's preparing us for the next stage which is going to be to rule go back and read and see what he promises to them in Le oysa to them that overcome will I allow to sit with me where you know what a throne is e it's a place of authority there's a reason why God is dealing with you God is perfecting you God is is strengthening you God is setting you free from all the things that that are holding you back be willing to obey be willing to step up be will be willing to move into those positions be do it with a joyful cheerful when you give cheerfully give if you've got to put it on for a while till God gets rid of all that carnality in you that's okay cheerfully give say glory to God Lord I give to you Hallelujah and start laughing and saying I'm blessed I'm blessed you're going to pour out blessing upon blessing Lord in your time and in your season you know exactly what I have need of I'm blessed just move in that direction and let the holy spiritu vindicate his own word this is not something you got to do this is something you surrender to Hallelujah and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him called of God and high priest after the order of MDC praise God so here we are now we're seeing remember God had a purpose in fulfilling and opening the book so that we could understand where we sit where we stand who we are what part are we in this book how do we fit into this book what's being unveiled right now this book has been opened brother Bram went and opened those Seven Seals what it did was it brought Christ to the Earth for the purpose and when you and and look I'm not going to go ahead let's go to the next let's read on here because then I got to I got to stay focused amen and stay the way the Lord wants me to bring it amen now listen here he says here and who is this mzc and then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that Spirit remember what we were talking about about obeying and coming under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and and and what what's what's being identified in you is that the word the attribute a part of God is actually in you because there's millions of Christian churches is out there and people are like robots they go in there Mary name of the you know then they'll go to the Black Box oh wait a minut I got to go confess my sins from last week I'll be right back they'll go in there they get there oh forgive me I've sinned they'll tell them all about what they did they leave there and they feel good what is that show me in the word where that is it's it's nowhere in the word when the Holy Spirit comes upon an indiv idual it changes their lives they don't go back to what they did last week they don't need to repent again over like yeah we do make mistakes and we'll make those same mistakes from time to time but that's not what I'm talking about here there's no Revelation that the blood of Christ has already forgiven them and that they are Justified as though they never done it in the first place that's the kind of relationship that God is looking for with man so the whole being becomes subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened Hallelujah Made Alive so he's saying here that spirit is the word that's in you it's the portion of God that's in you it's the seed that he placed in you that's why we've read the parable of the soore and there was good seed and it fell on good ground well you are good ground if youve received the seed because the Bible says and the seed that the soar was seeing was the word of God that's what he was sewing his word and so that's what's coming forth the seed word made manifest or quickened and when the Bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it there's no question and what it is it's the earnest of the Resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started it was once subject to sin and meire and Corruption but now it's got the earnest and what is the earnest it's the resurrection it's the spirit of Jesus Christ it's the holy ghost that you are entitled to when you are baptized according to the word of God not because you're going in a wet sinner and coming a dry sinner coming out a wet sinner not because of works it's not by works but because something gets revealed revealed to you on the inside that you now know you're dirty I'm I'm a sinner and I want to be cleaned I I I know I'm I'm wrong I I've been living wrong and I don't want to live that way anymore and then you go to the water then you're buried into the water and your life of the old is buried like like being buried six feet underground you get buried into the water when you come out of the water all the sin and un belief gets drowned into the water and your past gets wiped out and the spirit of God now comes and fills a clean vessel and now starts to do a work in you that's only the beginning that's only the beginning every birth is a mess every single birth there's a mess in every birth so don't think oh I'm going to get baptized be fine no no you're going to become a Target and the enem is going to try to turn you around oh that that that brother Danny over there that Minister he's preaching on this and that and boy it was really striking my heart it was like man that's the truth but ah the battles are too hard and I think I'm just gonna leave it you know my family's going to start thinking I'm cuckoo I'm G to go to work and they're going to see a different how come you don't swear anymore there partner I'm not hearing that word coming out of you what is that what's going on you know you're well I you know I I just you know tell them I got delivered from that thing I'm free I'm I'm now serving the Living God I found Jesus if you really want to know what happened I saw the light and I realized that my life was going the wrong way and no matter how I looked back in every situation it it was ugly I didn't like this situ I didn't like that sit I didn't like that one he says all things will be brand new and I look this way he shows me a brand new start he gives me brand new opportunity I can change the way I can you know you keep doing what you're doing you keep getting what you got thank you Lord so you need to change what you're doing if you want to change what you got it's as simple as that Hallelujah and so he goes on here he says there's no question because it's already started it was once subject to sin Meer and Corruption but now it's got the earnest and now it's got the resurrection power it's turned Heavenly now that's the earnest that you're going in the Rapture did you hear that that shows that you're actually identified with the church that is going to be going in the Rapture there's a lot of people talking about Rapture out there they'll preach Rapture they'll talk about Rapture but they got no idea that going through hell and deliverance and being set free from the things and the and the the bondage of of generational spirits that that came down through your life and and and scars from your past and bad experiences traumatic events those are things that God wants to set you free from because you're not going to take those things with you that's why Jesus said he that is heavy laden let him come unto me I'll give you rest I'll take the those burdens I'll take those things that are on you and I'll give you a free life of of of joy unspeakable in full of glory amen now that's the Rapture go to the next slide here he says here it's the earnest a sick person laying dying nothing left but death that's all can happen I've seen a Shadows of people done eat up with cancer and tuberculosis and see them persons a little while after that perfectly normal and strong you go back and study the life of this Reverend William Branham and you will find out that he had a Supernatural Ministry of healing God put that gift into his life not just so that he could heal people so that he could draw the attention of the people to the word to the restored word the one that the world out there doesn't really want to know when you tell tell them you got how are you baptized I was baptized as a baby that's not baptism you got to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as an adult he that believeth Jesus himself said he that believeth and is baptized what do you believe well I believe I was baptized as a baby and they'll just go on with that you see the word can never go against the word never never never never never Hallelujah and and William brandham had a Ministry that would draw the attention of the people through the Miracles through the healings through the raising of the Dead even doctors affidavits the whole bit no nonsense but yet he was drawing the people to the attention of what God was doing in our day Hallelujah you got to go back and study that for yourself a little while after that perfectly normal and strong if there's no Divine Healing then there's no Resurrection because Divine Healing he says cuz Divine Healing is the earnest of the Resurrection amen he says you know what's the earnest money is don't you it's the down payment he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed not not will be we were passed done you accept Christ your your healing can start right now right this morning that healing can start how long it takes that's up to the Lord hallelujah he was wounded for our transgressions we love him now this body is subject to the spirit have not yet entered into the word form you see that's that's the translation that's the change that's now going on in our lives that's the element that is the secret part of how God is going to take you and how God is going to change you and in the moment in the twinkl of an eye you're going to be changed but there's a there there's a process that you you're you're going back to the word you always were the word but you're not aware you're not conscious because the book has been opened to unveil who you really are but you're not fully aware and this is what this ministry and preaching is all about to bring us into that awareness let's go on you have not yet entered into that word form but we are still in flesh form but subject to the word that's why you're you're willing to come subject to the word for this day and for this hour it identifies that the word is actually in you that's why when somebody hears this message that God sent a prophet proper you know going back to the word you know the opening of The Seven Seals we're going to be doing a series on that okay the Lord's already showed me because you know these are things that that that pertain to now we need to unveil every seal we know that the seals have been open and all the mystery's been revealed it's not we're not going to reveal anything new it's all been revealed just that you're not aware of it yet until we become fully conscious of what God is doing that'll produce the Rapture amen glory to God but subject to the word let's move on we're gonna we're going to close here let the musicians come we're going to read two more quotes and we're going to close and we're going to continue next week then when a man is Born Again from Heaven he becomes a spirit babe in Christ and then when the robe of flesh is dropped there is a natural body theophany a body not made with hands neither born of a woman that we go to so that's the body that Paul's talking about that once this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we get into that theophany body but there's a purpose for the theophany then that body returns back picks up the glorified body the person that you were because we're going to be on earth for another thousand years you're going to say oh no you mean you mean we got to come back here for another Thousand Years the Millennium you mean we're going to be the ones that are coming riding on those white horses after the three and a because you go in the Rapture for a three and a half year vacation honeymoon Fellowship Gathering we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air and this world goes into the fullblown tribulation and 3 and a half years later we got to come back and we bind up Satan by the power that is in us as Sons and Daughters of God that's right that's right attribute word theophany Eternal bodies so don't worry the Millennium for the sons and Daughters of God will not have to deal with anything that you've been dealing with over the last 30 40 20 15 80 90 years while you've been on this Earth you will not experience any sickness you will not experience any sorrow Hallelujah and this robe of flesh is dropped then a natural body theophany a body made with with not made with hands neither born of a woman that we go to then that body returns back picks up the glorified body that that's the reason Jesus went to hell when he died and he preached to the souls that were in prison remember everything in type form everything revealed in type form what he's going to be doing amen that's why the first resurrection he went to to set free those that were in the Old Testament Bound by sin and unbelief now the sacrifice had been made it was no longer a sacrificial lamb that they had to Slit its throat it was now now Jesus Christ the Lamb of God he had paid the full price and now those which were dead would were not hinder they came up and they joined those which were alive in order to begin and move towards the second Resurrection Hallelujah and so that then that body returns Jesus went to hell when he died and preached the souls that were in prison turned back into that theophany oh marvelous thank God Second Corinthians if this Earth body be dissolved this this Earthly Tabernacle we have another one see we have bypassed that to come straight from God the attribute to be flesh to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did did you hear what he said there listen Adam and Eve in the beginning they were Eternal Adam was an expression of God Adam was God let's get this straight Eve was in Adam when Eve was pulled out of Adam she was the female aspect of God just like the church the bride she is the female aspect of God Amen and all Jesus all Adam would have had to do was look to Eve and speak the word and and bring other attributes right out of his own mind because Adam was God he could name the animals he called them by their name he he he created he spoke every anything that he said that he had dominion over the Earth and he was given the ability to multiply that's what God Said now multiply yourself he could have multiplied and brought every single one of us out of that that that dimension of Elohim in the mind of God he could have just just called us into existence and we would have been right there in the Garden of Eden but Satan wanted to be like God he wanted to be worshiped like God now you'll understand why the serpent seed he goes to Eve he goes to Eve and he says hey you know that you can be like God they knew Adam knew what was going on Adam knew that he could speak the word but it was all part like the Paradox is that God wanted to be a redeemer God wanted to be a Healer God wanted to be a father so he he now the devil goes to Eve to pervert what God was supposed to do by the spoken word what Adam would do by the spoken word he goes and uses the word that Adam spoke that led every SE that God spoke that Adam spoke let every seed bring forth of its own kind and he uses that now to go and inject his seed as an upright human being to bring forth a son just like God wanted to do see there's the whole perversion now we'll continue this next week because it's just going to get sweeter okay you're going to see how everything comes perfectly together to fulfill the plan of God in order to bring us back to our rightful positions I'm not going any further let us pray father what what a privilege this morning and what an honor Lord to allow your anointing and your spirit to just speak and have your way in every one of our Lives Lord oh God we all need you Lord
