========================================
[Music] once again here we are in the presence of the lord and together with each other what a blessed day and a blessed time for us to gather together as the bible says for satan not the assembly of yourselves together as the manner of some is more so that we see the day approaching the rapture day approaching our hearts rejoice we're happy in the lord watching for that great marvelous wonderful

meditations of our hearts may the great holy spirit move on the scene lord as the waters the spirit moved across the people and moved across the face of the waters in the beginning of creation may the same holy spirit of almighty god descend among us today anoint every heart listening watching wherever around the world we hear from india we hear from africa we hear from romania we hear from many other kenya many foreign countries of the world o great holy spirit made a grace of god almighty reach out lord touch the people father anoint your word to the hearts of your children take glory honor and praise as we surrender ourselves as sons and daughters and servants of the living god captives to the word of god glory be to you glorious magnificent name in the name of jesus christ our lord whom we love and serve amen well it is claimed that today is mother's day and i will briefly just express the thoughts about motherhood uh or mothers but at the same time uh i will not swerve in any direction away from the thoughts that i have to preach today and so i will just minister as normal but i do recognize mother's day i want to say to you that it's a wonderful and marvelous thing for anyone to have a a mother that cares about them watches over them and makes sure all is well with them and do you know that even after we have grown up our mothers still look upon us as if we have it we are still their children i thank god for a a godly mother that raised me watched over me and pointed me to the way of the lord god rest her soul she's with the lord she's went on from new york into the presence of almighty god and i thank god for her my friends there is no there is no price given for a mother a grandmother a sister a friend a wife that's good filled with great love and dignity christian modesty christ-like spirit the character of real womanhood i thank god for women who accept the challenge to live like that in this ungodly wicked and perverted age where women are belittle despised where women are sometimes rated second class but in god's book he doesn't put them there god tells you clearly that the she is to be a help meet or a mate and we thank god for them the book of proverbs tells us clearly that her the value the true value of a woman for many men don't know how to value their wives their daughters oh or any female for that matter they have no sense of value for them not realizing of course that a good woman or price the bible says is far above rubies in other words her value she is priceless if she has the character she has the the way of being a help meet or mate as god's word says and if the man responds in kind and together they can walk life's road together from use to old age might i say may i say that's my wife and i at this particular time oh i thank god for her i thank god for this grand wonderful uh mother of my children and i give glory to god for giving her to me and i pray that every man within the sound of my voice or watching this broadcast will come to think of the value we place upon our wives we are called by the holy spirit who is himself a gentleman to be gentleman to be like jesus do you hear what i said to be a gentleman or a gentle man that means to be a man but at the same time to be gentle so there's time a man must be formed and be able to say no but at other times he must recognize when his wife placed there by god to be his help mate may give him some good advice or say something that's right or give him some sense of direction i'm not talking about domination control influence i'm talking about just as a a loving um cooperative wife walking working along with her husband what just talked to him and sometimes men's pride get in the way and they want to rail up but but a real man even if at first he does that he'll come right back and say you know i'm sorry i was wrong i shouldn't have done that you were right to begin with and and and things like that but we've got to understand brother sister the value of a real woman a bad woman the bible says is like water in your blood it'll weaken you weaken your efforts weaken everything you're trying to accomplish but if god has given you one then i tell you brother work with her and let her work with you and together you can work together and lay the foundations of a marvelous and wonderful family future and leave a legacy behind one that may not be just financial maybe one of finance and faith faith being the foremost thing but whatever it is you leave your children with the indelible imprint of them being molded into the image of jesus christ the son of god the flesh that god lived in may the holy spirit bless these few thoughts to your heart today please take them to your heart and accept my greetings to my dear precious sisters everywhere here in canada the united states of america islands of the sea africa oh praise god happy mother's day god bless you one and all glory to god god bless you happy mother's day god bless you our topic for today our everlasting thirst our everlasting thirst for you know that our thirst cannot be eternal for when we get back into the presence of god then we can search no more for now we are living a life of complete total satisfaction all our joys will be full and all the glories that we imagined within our hearts and above that which we think or even imagine or desire it will have become into reality and we will be satisfied let us read our scripture as the heart painted after the water brooks so panthet my soul after thee oh god my soul searched that for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god hallelujah praise his marvelous and wonderful name my friends i want to look over in the book of joshua chapter 2. and there we find a beautiful young woman by the name of rahab now the story of rahab can be found as i've said in joshua chapter 2. and i'm going to speak about her briefly because it ties in with the fact that man was made with a thirst within his heart for god and the devil changed that into having a thirst in his heart for god's and changed it worked it twisted it and brought it to the place where his taste and his tears have become so twisted warped in every way that he longs lust and thirsts after many things that he should have no thirst for no desire for no attraction to but because of the magnetizing power of the temptation of the temptations of satan men are drawn to these evil traps that the devil has set now in our day of course we find that these traps have multiplied and they're all around us everywhere now this rahab of whom we speak she of course received the spies that were sent out ahead of the churn of israel to spy out the land of canaan and to go into the city of jericho and others and to spy out the strength and weaknesses of the land in this case there were trapped within a city where the gates were closed and a search was on for the spies and there was rahab according to the bible she was a harlot and to find young full-blooded men entering into her house the bible says she took them to her house and the bible tells us she hid them covered them up and hid them from the king and his soldiers when they came to search for these israelite spies and they were kept there safely and when the soldiers were finished searching and were gone she kept them in her home until it was night but you see she lived on the wall of the city so through her window below was outside of the city so when it got dark enough the bible tells us that she got whether a basket or a rope or something and was able to let them down outside of the wall so that they could return to joshua and report to him what they had seen and heard but before they left her house they made her a promise that you've been good to us and we're coming back and we know that we this city will be destroyed for the lord god has said we are to destroy the city but because of what you have done if you will place a scarlet colored cord in your window right remembering our house is on the wall of the city and the scarlet card in that window would be highly visible i'm sure she had one on the outside window on the outside of the wall and i believe she had another one on the inside wall of the city for after they breached the city and they are on the inside they may not recognize that it's the same house so here she was with the scarlet cord and the bible says she gathered all her family into that house now i will not dwell on the fact that here we are that the harlot whom they might have looked down upon whom they have cast aside whom they spurned she would be the very person that would be the savior of our entire family of course the scarlet cord was a sign and symbol of the coming blood of christ that would save a world caught up in harlotry with satan dancing with satan living with satan moving with satan in every way but if a seed is buried in there and it catches the revelation of the word it will hold to the scarlet cord of the blood of jesus christ and change to from harlotry to being one of his own oh glory to god blessed be his holy name my friends today we are deduces the same thing this word which is spurned this revelation of this word of god that's open book that's been given to us that's being spurned in every quarter has come to you and is coming to you right now come to your house will you let him him will you give him a hiding place will you let him hide behind your skin would you let him live within your heart would you let the holy spirit so use you that you will change and be a blessing to the entire world and your family and friends and everyone that is around you for today it's not the scarlet cord in the window but uh the blood of jesus christ which is the holy spirit within your heart making himself visible by the character and the life that you're living that becomes expressed to the people so they can recognize it that you the old you doesn't live in that house or in this body anymore but jesus christ has come in to take up his abode and now you are a new person in jesus christ washed by his precious blood amen praise god the life is in the blood so that scarlet cord represented the life of christ that was coming that would become manifest in the life of the believers so that people can see your salvation when it works itself outside when it works out praise god hallelujah so we have a salvation not on our lips not on our tongues not just like that but we have a salvation that we are living we are expressing and we are manifesting for he has come into us to take up his abode now this rehab with this horrible terrible background she was saved and her family was saved no matter what the world thinks about you whoever you are wherever you come from i tell you today in the name of jesus christ that the holy spirit can take your life rich or poor higher low whatever your standard your status is the great holy spirit can take your life and cause you to be the one that will lead your family to jesus christ oh praise god i don't mean you'll harass them you harangue them you'll be pushing all kinds of stuff at them but i'm saying with the life that you live full of love full of the his nature full of his character and you won't have to put it on because it it's living in you and it begins to live itself out of you unconscious godliness you don't even have to think about it not being like uh the old form of them thinking how christianity was oh i've got to be a christian therefore i've got to keep my temper i need to be a christian therefore i need to do this and this and this and that that is you trying to live the life of christ but if you would allow jesus to come in and to take full control of your life he will live in you and he will live his own life through you then you will rest you will come to a place of rest and realize not i but christ that liveth in me he do at the works he is the one that's living he is the one that's manifesting he is the one that's declaring himself and then my friends the pressure you let off the pressure from your life you let off the pressure from the people around you because the first form of christianity you're caught up with people who are looking at you people who are criticizing saying this is saying when you become one that the holy spirit controls and christ lives through you then you don't worry about anything because you know it is not i but it is the lord amen lord of god but i want you to know after the great battle rahab met one of the israelite generals and his name my friends she married him and they had a son now you remember you realize that an israelite general was like a prince of israel and god allowed her a gentile to marry this israelite general and she had a son by him and his name was salman salman now this salmon according to scripture and history was the founder of the city of bethlehem and so he was also the father of boaz who became the husband of ruth now there's a pattern there how that god is consistently using gentiles working through gentiles and we see the figure of a woman which types the church rehab sarah rehab ruth god showing gentiles praise god foreshadowing that salvation would come and be sent out to the world spread out evangelize and gentiles will be the ones that will be used to do it already foreshadowed here in the word of god hallelujah my friends we find out that bethlehem was one of the smallest cities and the scripture reads of bethlehem of judea art thou the least amongst all the princes of the cities of judea oh praise god but out of thee shall come the governor that shall rule my people out of this little despised rejected city of bethlehem would come the governor that will rule my people which of course is jesus christ oh praise god so god used a rejected city to have jesus christ come on the scene then we see later how david when there had to be a choosing for david and samuel went up there and all the brothers came many of them tall and burly handsome striking looking men and there this great uh one went there and he said none of these don't you have another one say oh there's another one but he's out in the field he's just a shepherd he just looks after the sheep and samuel said no go bring him and you see my friends david despised rejected overlooked and yet he was the one that god choose to use to be his anointed one and to be king of israel even though he was overlooked by man he was not overlooked by god oh thank god friends hallelujah amen god always love the rejected you may be rejected for for all i know god loves to pick up family rejects god loves to help and to pick up people that are rejected by society god loves people that are rejected by their very own family he loves people rejected by their own friends he loves to put his arms around them and bring them closer to him amen so thank god hallelujah that this jesus christ that we know my friends born in a rejected city was rejected himself and says if i am your lord and master and i come into your life then they'll persecute you lightly persecuted me and you will also be rejected you're rejected by those that are around you hallelujah oh praise god thank god if the churches reject you if society rejects you if your friends rejects you if your family reject you call to god's unchanging hand for he said i'll never leave you i will never forsake you but i'll be with you to the very end hallelujah when god he said if he loves he loveth his own unto the end or praise god that's the kind of god that we we serve amen praise god amen yes sir god picks up the rejected ones he pick up a rejected city picked up a rejected son and now he wants to pick you and i up if we're rejected by our very own and why does he pick the rejected ones because he wants to come and live in them like he lived and was born and lived for a while in bethlehem as the psalmist said oh behold this man was born there oh glory to god hallelujah that he can be born in me again he can be born in your heart again i said jesus christ can be born again in your heart and in my heart you are he is born again in you and you are born again in him and together you walk hand in hand the king and i walk down lies road together oh praise god we who are like beggars to him oh praise god we can give him the praise the honor and the glory amen praise god and now the doctor might have rejected you rejected by medical science telling you it's over they can't help you anymore but the god of this bible tells us they shall pray the earnest prayer of a righteous man a valid much could heal you can deliver you can save you can raise you up glory to god bible says they shall lay their hands upon the sick and the shall recover or praise god hallelujah i believe that something every minister every pastor should do for their people lay their hands on the sick the rejected the trouble the trade the the oppressed the depressed and the holy spirit will drive away those dark demons and those shadows away from them in book of psalms chapter 42 verses one two two david speaking as the heart searched it for the water brook so my soul searched it after thee oh god i think david is a great hunter i think that he was a great hunter and watching the movement of the animals he had a lot of meaning behind those words i repeat them as the heart or deer as we know it dear but as the heart thirsted for the water brook so my soul searched that after thee oh god our everlasting thirst that god has placed within our hearts and we as believers and as human beings whether sinner or saint god has placed the thirst in there where we will thirst for him until we find satisfaction in him and in his presence it is not eternal it is everlasting for when we were in him we didn't have to thirst for him but away from him in this earth's uh journey we search after the living god and the presence of the living god whom we love and serve with all our hearts praise god hallelujah brother sister so david being a hunter and out there brother sister hunting you know what he was referring to is that when you're hunting gear and the deer gets wounded and the homes the dogs start running chasing the deer and the deer goes running the deer goes running as fast as it can jumping everywhere because it's wounded but because it's wounded and the blood is flowing up only by drinking water will it be able to sustain its life to be able to escape so as the deer panted after the water broke so my soul task thrusted after thee so if that deer doesn't get to water to drink it will die it will thirst it will get tired and weak and fall by the wayside and this is what david is inferring or speaking to us hallelujah let me tell you if you are not born again born by this word of god and you're just a church member or a street walker or a sinner somewhere out there brother sister let me tell you you are living in a literal nightmare upon this earth what we are in right now and the homes of hell are hunting you are chasing you they're running behind you especially if you are one with a wounded broken spirit those devils can sense it they can tell what state you're in and they're running for you they're chasing after you trying to get a hold of you oh my i tell you i don't know but i'm running for my life i'm running for my life you say brother simon you're running yes i'm running for my life and allowing the holy spirit to be with me every step of the way i want to give god the glory and honor and i want to encourage you to run many times you have nightmares and when you have the nightmare something's chasing you and you're just beyond its reach and it's running behind you just about to grab a hold of you you're getting thirsty you're sweating you that's the feeling but oh thank god only this word of god can break you out of that human nightmare that we're living in in the world today and bring your back to your senses to recognize you're a child of the king you're a son you're a daughter of the living god hallelujah yes sir that wounded year has got to get the water and i won that broken spirit a human being regardless of their station whether they are king and i've said this before whether they are commoner whether they are a prince whether they are a papa regardless of who you are your standard your status in life my friends there is that thirst god placed in you oh my god and the devil has been after you from the day you were born from the time you start to become conscious that you were a target for the homes of hell coming after you amen so the hounds are chasing the deer is running running for its life you'd better run france you better run oh my because satan is on your track the devil is on your track temptation is on your track them these hounds of hell are behind you these denominations are after you they're trying to grab you and chain you in there into prisons with stained glass windows but the great holy spirit is here to give you fresh water to quench your thirst to strengthen your struggle to give you my friends the ability to escape from art to glory by the rapture and grace of almighty god and the salvation of your soul in the present age and in this present time amen the hands of hell are right behind and the hounds of hell are trying to catch up with you oh my but if you are here and your heart broken like a deer if you're here and you're wounded in spirit like a wounded deer oh running for your life i encourage you come to this fresh water of the word of god for this hour and drink and live and you'll never thirst again oh this is the water that if you drink my friends you'll never ever have to thirst again if that deer can find the water brook and drink a lot of water it will revive him and revive her strength and cause her to be able to escape and i'm quoting brother branham now he says if that deer can run and drink a lot of water it will revive them again and then he can go for hours and make a circle and come back across by the water brook drink again see drink again hallelujah oh praise god we can always circle back maybe you were wounded and you fell out of some church maybe you were one dead and your backslid maybe you're one dead because you're drawn away by some ravenous wolf or by some hungry hound grabbed the hole of you and pulled you out by some temptation some lie something oh my friend i want you to know my friends that you can circle around sometimes something happened you got so discouraged you wanted nothing to do with any church any preacher anything called christianity and you got so discouraged but i'm here to encourage you today to make a big circle circle around come back around another time and drink again i trust you're drinking today i trust you're drinking the fresh water of the word of the living god hallelujah to encourage your soul maybe your lukewarm maybe you claimed at one time to believe this message oh beaten battered just us everywhere ready to give up maybe you did give up but i'm here to encourage you circle again come back and drink from the great something of god let the holy spirit almighty god revive us as the songwriter said revive us again fill his heart with thy love may soul be rekindled with fire from above hallelujah line the glory hallelujah amen hallelujah thine the glory revive us hallelujah oh friend you're running for your life run in a big circle oh praise god turn around turn around god is calling oh he's calling you out of your life of wasted years you wasted the first part of your life but now you're having a second chance you can make up for it oh praise god hallelujah you'll live for him and he'll live for you he died for you that you can live for him and you'll live for him and you stand by him and he'll stand by you help praise god hallelujah yes sir amen you got to find god that you're going to die i said you're going to you've got to find god and you've got to find them fast are you going to die in every way and when you see that deer ghost looking for water and it take or a man or a woman the devil has got them in a corner they're cornered and they real you look you know it takes sometimes god to allow us to be in a situation of extreme emergency to drive us home to god where we will cry out oh god where never before we wouldn't mention his name we would swear his name we would call him all manual names but when we get in a real emergency there is something in the human heart that tells them there is a real god of heaven who answers prayer who heals the sick who saves the soul who can deliver us and then we cry out oh god like the thief on the cross just oh my the last moment of his life and yet he cried oh god you can do the same and jesus will answer the same this day today thou shalt be with me in paradise oh glory be to god hallelujah oh praise god my friends when that deer begins to run desperation sets in when you're in a situation desperation really sets in you find when people get desperate they start to get sincere now people get desperate they're really backed into a corner they get serious christianity is no more a joke it's not just fun here laughing and and dancing and running here and twiddling their toes or twiddling their their tongues or twisting their tongues like my tongue's about to twist i tell you when the holy spirit of almighty god is upon you brother sister i tell you god will see you true he'll help you and bring you out of whatever situation or condition that you're in when that deer knows the hounds are behind him and they're almost catching up to him he can almost feel the heat of the breath and those homes on him you can almost feel the heat and the breathing of the devil and the satanic powers behind you ready to catch up on you praise god i won't tell you it might be the belt collector i won't tell you it might be a sickness i would tell you it might be anything like that but i just want you to know when you have a sense within your soul that's the it's about to catch up with you it's time for you to run for your life to the water brooks of the fresh refreshing cool clear fresh water from the wells of bethlehem the wealth of the word of the living god hallelujah amen oh praise god you're expecting god you get desperate yes when that doctor looked you in the face and tell you sir lady you've got cancer this is your doctor i've got cancer because these days they hear the word cancer it's like a death sentence amen it's like a vital spot get hit in your chest you feel like somebody give you a punch in your chest like that and then the doctor goes on and tells you there is no operation i can give you you're dying and you only got a few months to live you let me tell you you get desperate then because you know there is no other hope i got no other help my refuge is in christ jesus is my rock in the weary land of this life oh here's my shelter in the time of storm i can only lean on him i can only trust in him i can only believe his word you've got nowhere else to lean on but to lean on jesus that he will bring you out and save your soul and heal your body raise you up by the power of god make you whole again amen and the doctor locks everywhere turns this way turns that way but i thought i thought i saw on the x-ray look it's on the x-ray here but i'm looking at you here and there is nothing there what happened oh praise god somebody touched me somebody touched my soul somebody touched my entire being my body has changed my life has changed my home has changed my whole being has changed i'm a new creation i'm a brand new woman i'm a brand new man i'm a brand new young person i'm a brand new being because i've been transformed by god's power to transform hallelujah amen yes sir when you hear words like that your soul goes to getting thirsty and you start looking for an answer and most of the time you may come to the church or to a preacher with desperation in your heart crying out to god amen and it's when you get sincere real earnest oh my god and when your heart becomes so full your eyes filled with the water of tears and the heart begins to stop with the sadness of repentance then you'll come to god hallelujah and that time when you cry like that you'll find the water books of the living god hallelujah because what the deep is calling to the deep and the deep will respond hallelujah you'll find that water broke because you're if you're a real seed of god the thrust that is in you is the thirst of the gene the deep calling back to the deep to get water to cause the gene the seed to germinate hallelujah lord send me the reigns send me the holy spirit send me the waters of life amen let me live again let me walk again let me rejoice again let me move by your spirit again lord jesus hallelujah amen the predestinated seed of god in your heart crying out for god crying out for fresh water amen and god will send water he will not send you some stagnated denominational water filled with tadpoles and all kinds of for water frogs and lizards and spiders and and everything else my friends he'll send you heaven set revival heaven sent holy spirit the anointing of the holy ghost comes up on the scene i am man and fulfills the promises of the day proving that the bible is true god is not dead but we first for the living god hallelujah praise god people come and they may act religious but their ears sit in the church hear a sermon like this but their ears are sealed it's filled with wax they can't hear oh my sealed away to the truth amen so close oh the deception in this day is so close the bible said it would deceive the elected if it were possible it's not possible but it will be so deceiving in this hour and people reject the gospel but to reject the true opening of the word is to be sealed with the mark of the denominational beast of the beast oh my then you are marked your mark from that time amen marking your head marking your hands marking your intelligence amen using the intelligence rather than using your heart using the faith that god placed within your heart within your entire being amen for your your knowledge is in your head faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god not there in the church rules of the church standards or the church statements whatever but hearing the revelation of the word of god hallelujah which means to say faith cometh by hearing by understanding by receiving let me put it this way you coming to the house of god day after day night after night and maybe you don't understand everything but one day something is sad and something clicks oh praise god and you you catch a hold of a thought a revelation you catch a hold my friends you you get a spiritual awakening something in you wake up amen you get a an epiphany or a your eureka moment when you say oh i got it i got it i got it oh praise god i'm glad you got it may the holy spirit help you to get it help somebody listening to me now to get it and let the holy spirit open up his word to their hearts and to their lives my friends as i begin to wind down i want to let you know that here in canada this is a nation that has an animal called a beaver and i found some news that came in saying beavers chew through a cable and knock out internet service to hundreds and hundreds in a canadian town and this was on cnn they not through the cable first in several places it was buried three feet on the ground and was protected by a 4.5 inch thick conduit was protecting the cable but they chewed through all of it and you may not be able to see it clearly but here is the article from cnn detailing this how this communications problem telephone tv internet everything was clean cleared shut down completely well you know we got a lot of beavers here in canada i believe there's a lot of beavers all around the world because beavers have a way of putting a log across the river or logs blocking up the water to stop it from flowing and they'll they'll put leaves and mud and twigs and everything else until they can block off that water the channel in that water and the water gets backed up and that's what we call a beaver dam the beaver builds a earthen and wooden dam across a river and blocks it up completely amen and i believe the denominations of this world today are very much like a beavers they build dams to keep their members in they build dams to keep the truth out they keep building dams and we have a lot of beaver preachers also damn up all the fresh water of the word of god away from the people amen keep them away from the open word the truth and the fresh waters of the word of god hallelujah and they'll say oh this water over here is ours and this water here is is is back this water pentecostal water is this water it's that water it's the other water there's only one rail genuine water that's not stagnated and that is the revealed word of god for the hour hallelujah we don't want water from organizations because they have stagnated cistern water that we have all kinds of tadpoles and tails in it every and every possible way amen as i said before when you get stagnated water then you start getting tadpoles you start getting all kinds of wiggle tails in it and the church begins to wiggle and waggle and and slip and slide and and dance and move this way and they're changing constantly constantly like that that's the matter with the church today they have a little wiggle here a little waggle there little twists here a little turn over there amen this is all oh they hear this kind of a preaching oh there's nothing to that there's nothing to it there is no such a thing as one god all the churches most believe in tree gods the trinitarian doctrine there is not nothing to that water baptism they're telling you about there is nothing to that opening of the seven seals there is nothing to them seven angels that were in the heavens going back and their form was taken out in the in the as the face of jesus christ typical of the pin that i'm wearing here at this particular time but friends it actually happened but they will wiggle here and waggle there and tell you that it's not the case and don't you worry about them don't you believe them they're talking about this and talking about that oh there is nothing to that serpent seed there is nothing to that eve of going with this serpent you see they're thinking a serpent is a snake like we see it today but back in the bible it says he was intelligent he was wise he was standing upright and then he was cursed then put on his belly and from this day you're going to waggle
