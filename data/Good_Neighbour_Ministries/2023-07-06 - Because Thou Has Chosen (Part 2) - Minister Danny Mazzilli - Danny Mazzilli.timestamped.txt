[20:41] the Book of Joshua we're going to

[21:16] plant seed within our hearts give us
[21:19] strength
[21:20] to encourage us Lord to manifest
[21:23] yourself
[21:24] and Lord you chose to preach your word
[21:28] so that you could place it into the
[21:31] hearts of your children and then you
[21:32] would interpret it through them in them
[21:35] you would be the greatest part of our
[21:38] lives Lord you are everything to us now

[22:21] praise God forevermore
[22:24] Hallelujah
[22:26] amen you got to just be patient with me
[22:29] one second here
[22:31] because my
[22:35] my computer Rebooted
[22:40] and
[22:47] we're going to be reading from Joshua
[22:49] chapter 5.
[22:53] verse 13. we're going to start right
[22:55] there
[22:59] amen
[23:01] and it came to pass
[23:03] when Joshua was by Jericho that he
[23:06] lifted up his eyes and looked and behold
[23:09] there stood a man over against him with
[23:12] his sword drawn in his hand
[23:15] and Joshua went unto him and said unto
[23:18] him art thou for us
[23:21] or for our adversaries
[23:23] and he said nay
[23:26] but as captain of the host of the Lord
[23:29] am I now come
[23:31] and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth
[23:33] and did worship and said unto him what
[23:37] saith my Lord unto his servant and the
[23:41] captain of the Lord's host said unto
[23:43] Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot
[23:47] for the place whereon thou standeth is
[23:50] Holy and Joshua did so
[23:54] amen may the Lord add His blessings to
[23:56] the word of God Amen praise God
[23:59] what a wonderful um
[24:01] time
[24:03] on Sunday you may be seated on Sunday we
[24:06] were looking at how you know in the Book
[24:10] of Joshua chapter 1
[24:11] the Lord said my servant Moses is dead
[24:15] he says now you
[24:16] Joshua you're going to take the people
[24:19] into the promised land you are going to
[24:23] go and I'm gonna be with you he says
[24:26] just be courageous be strong and know
[24:29] that I'll be with you and we know that
[24:33] the Lord moved in a supernatural way in
[24:36] the ministry of Joshua and as long as
[24:39] Joshua was under the leadership of the
[24:40] Holy Spirit and recognized who his
[24:45] instruction was coming from and did all
[24:48] that the lord gave him to do he would
[24:50] prosper
[24:52] everything that he did when he when he
[24:54] when he heard the Lord he obeyed the
[24:56] Lord he recognized the voice of the Lord
[24:59] he prospered amen praise God but I want
[25:02] you to notice here now Joshua's
[25:04] commission had started he had gone to
[25:06] the River Jordan he had crossed over by
[25:09] the spoken word he had recognized that
[25:10] the supernatural was with him he
[25:13] realized that that that this was not an
[25:16] ordinary Ministry that he had amen
[25:19] praise God we need to realize and
[25:21] recognize that we're not under some
[25:23] ordinary Ministry we are not under a
[25:25] church ministry we don't just belong in
[25:28] and are members of a church we are under
[25:31] the mystical body of Jesus Christ we're
[25:34] under the anointed Living Word of this
[25:37] hour and there's an interpretation that
[25:40] must be fulfilled through each and every
[25:42] one of our Lives amen praise God and so
[25:46] here I want you to notice that Joshua
[25:48] when he asks he says are you with us or
[25:51] are you against us well the angel of the
[25:54] Lord didn't turn around and say you know
[25:55] the captain you didn't say I'm with you
[25:58] and he didn't say I'm against you
[26:01] he just had some instruction for him
[26:03] praise God you see God's not interested
[26:07] in your plans
[26:08] God's interested in his plans God is
[26:12] going to stand behind his plans and will
[26:14] always do his own will purpose and plan
[26:18] regardless of how we see things how we
[26:21] interpret things how we want things to
[26:24] come to about how we expect things to
[26:27] happen
[26:27] amen praise God God had his own plans
[26:31] for Joshua God's got his own plans for
[26:34] you God's got his own plans for this
[26:37] church amen praise God it's not going to
[26:40] be according to our ways our thoughts
[26:42] our interpretation we've got many
[26:45] different kinds of interpretations but
[26:47] we're not interested in that
[26:49] we're interested in the word being
[26:51] fulfilled in this day and in this hour
[26:53] you see because God is only going to
[26:55] back his word
[26:57] he'll only back you if you're in the
[27:00] word
[27:00] glory to God Amen he'll only back you
[27:03] because he's the captain of the host he
[27:06] did not say he was with him he did not
[27:08] say he was against him because he has
[27:11] his own agenda Hallelujah that's what
[27:15] we're interested in amen we want his
[27:17] agenda we want to know what he has
[27:19] planned for us and we must be led by the
[27:22] spirit because the Lord is not going to
[27:25] change his plan for us
[27:29] hmm
[27:31] hallelujah praise God he's not going to
[27:34] change his plan for us
[27:35] Hallelujah glory to God not my will
[27:38] that's why not my will thy will be done
[27:41] Jesus came to the Earth imagine God made
[27:45] himself a body to dwell in came into a
[27:47] human form and when he came to the Earth
[27:50] he said very clearly to the people I
[27:54] come to do my father's will
[27:57] I don't come to do what you think there
[28:00] was so many interpretations on the on on
[28:03] on the Messiah when he was to come to
[28:06] the Earth
[28:07] you know they've got so many
[28:08] interpretations in this day of what
[28:11] they're expecting the Messiah to do but
[28:13] guess what they're always looking to
[28:15] what he's going to do they're always
[28:17] looking back to what he's done but they
[28:19] failed to see what he's doing right now
[28:22] Hallelujah and that's what we have come
[28:25] into that's what our calling is out of
[28:28] all about
[28:29] that's what called us
[28:31] he called us to fulfill the word in our
[28:35] day
[28:35] can you imagine that we've been called
[28:38] just like he called the disciples he was
[28:41] he was he was the Mighty God here on the
[28:43] earth and he was walking on the Earth
[28:45] but yet when he crossed by you know
[28:47] Matthew the tax collector you know
[28:49] seeing his condition seeing the way that
[28:52] he was seeing how he was hated he was
[28:55] not a loved person he was not popular he
[28:58] was popular but very unpopular in his
[29:01] popularity
[29:02] Hallelujah but Jesus turned to him one
[29:05] day and says Matthew
[29:07] follow me
[29:09] imagine
[29:10] you see God does things in such a
[29:14] strange and mysterious way and you just
[29:16] gotta look at your own life and you got
[29:18] to wonder why did he say follow me and
[29:22] why was it that when you heard it at the
[29:26] time and in the season that you were
[29:28] supposed to hear it that it completely
[29:31] changed your entire life
[29:33] changed your walk completely you had no
[29:36] idea what you were going to be coming
[29:38] into you had no idea that God could do
[29:41] the supernatural things that he was
[29:43] doing in your life because a lot of us
[29:46] we had some serious Jericho walls in our
[29:49] lives
[29:50] foreign
[29:52] hallelujah we're going to be looking at
[29:54] that we can't let squatters in our land
[29:57] When God Says listen I've called you out
[30:00] I'm going to use you I'm going to place
[30:03] you and he starts to give you the
[30:05] instruction for this day in this hour we
[30:07] got to watch how we walk with the Lord
[30:10] remember he's got a plan he told Joshua
[30:14] he says go and possess the land he says
[30:16] little by little I'm going to give you
[30:18] that land I'm going to give you the
[30:21] victory I'm going to give you the body
[30:23] change Hallelujah it ain't going to come
[30:26] just like you know just like you know in
[30:28] the way that you think it's going to
[30:29] come but it's going to come in a moment
[30:31] and in the twinkling of an eye and it's
[30:33] probably going to happen when you don't
[30:34] expect it
[30:38] but what what what do you got to be
[30:40] doing you got to be walking in the word
[30:42] you've got to be uh possessing your land
[30:45] you got to be taking possession of your
[30:48] calling your position in Christ you know
[30:51] Ephesians is all about placing and
[30:54] positioning Joshua went in took the land
[30:57] started to divide the land started to
[30:59] place the people in the land but they
[31:01] also had to possess the land they were
[31:03] not to allow the Canaanites and the
[31:06] jebusites and all the all the uh you
[31:08] know the squatters to come in and start
[31:10] you know taking control over their their
[31:13] their their their lives amen praise God
[31:15] it's still the same today we don't want
[31:19] to allow these things to come into our
[31:20] lives because God is obligated to his
[31:23] word
[31:24] he's not obligated to you as a human
[31:27] that has your own interpretation on how
[31:30] you're going to manifest or how you're
[31:31] going to live this word you got to let
[31:34] the spirit of God live in you that's
[31:37] your hope of glory
[31:39] that's your only opportunity amen praise
[31:41] God remember the Lord is watching over
[31:44] his own word
[31:48] not our interpretation ideas ways but
[31:52] his and interpretation so don't let down
[31:56] the bars because when sin comes into the
[31:58] camp God is not obligated to fight for
[32:02] you
[32:04] when you start to choose to go off into
[32:06] certain ways
[32:07] and you decide that you're gonna you
[32:09] know you're just gonna be a little bit
[32:12] slack in going to church you're just
[32:14] gonna any little excuse comes along ah
[32:17] I'm not gonna go you know oh well they
[32:20] need cleaners in the church uh I'm busy
[32:22] this weekend I'm tired you know you
[32:25] start to lose focus of your position in
[32:29] the body of Christ
[32:31] that that all that you're doing now is
[32:34] all that really matters in the in the in
[32:36] the spirit of God anything that you're
[32:38] doing now under the leadership of the
[32:41] spirit of God is all that really matters
[32:44] in your life did you know that
[32:47] I'm not saying that you got to forget
[32:48] about your normal Natural Life you've
[32:52] got a natural life but all that you do
[32:54] do it in the spirit of God
[32:57] do it with a right relationship with God
[33:01] we were talking about uh you know on
[33:04] Sunday how it's so important to approach
[33:06] every situation with the right
[33:09] relationship with the right kind of uh
[33:13] you know um position within the body of
[33:15] Christ knowing who you are knowing your
[33:18] responsibilities and knowing your
[33:20] obligations to God your respects unto
[33:24] the Lord your respects unto the house of
[33:27] the Lord your respects unto the
[33:29] leadership
[33:30] that God has given you it's so important
[33:33] not to lose sight
[33:36] of these things
[33:38] Hallelujah
[33:40] the mighty captain of the host is here
[33:42] today
[33:44] you see this was all a type
[33:47] everything that Joshua was experiencing
[33:49] was because God knew that they would
[33:52] have to face some serious Giants in the
[33:55] land
[33:56] they were going to have to face you know
[33:58] Jericho was on nine acres of land that's
[34:00] all it was it was a nine Acre parcel of
[34:03] land but it had walls and those walls
[34:07] were I don't know
[34:08] how many feet thick but I can tell you
[34:10] they were 66 feet high
[34:13] can you imagine
[34:15] that kind of a you know that's why
[34:18] Joshua was out there
[34:19] and he was looking at these walls
[34:22] and he was saying the Lord said that
[34:25] he's going to give me
[34:27] this land
[34:28] he's given me these he's given me the
[34:31] these people how in the world am I going
[34:34] to get over these walls
[34:37] how how are we going to get through
[34:38] these walls
[34:40] you may ask yourself those same
[34:42] questions
[34:43] but you know when you get to a place
[34:45] like that that's when God comes on the
[34:47] scene
[34:48] it's when you get to the to to a
[34:51] situation in your life that you just you
[34:53] don't know how you're going to get over
[34:55] it you don't know how you're going to
[34:56] get through it but God is going to make
[34:59] a way because he's going to honor his
[35:02] word
[35:03] when God honors his word the
[35:06] supernatural takes over remember God is
[35:09] Not natural
[35:10] he is Supernatural there's nothing
[35:13] natural about the Lord Jesus amen praise
[35:16] God hallelujah
[35:18] he's a mighty captain of the host he's
[35:20] here today and what's he doing he's
[35:23] revealing the word for our day
[35:26] he's giving us our instruction on how we
[35:29] are to overcome
[35:31] how we're going to get through these
[35:33] Great Walls you know you might look at a
[35:36] body change and you might think oh boy
[35:38] this is this is a major uh thing like
[35:41] how's we're not concerned about how
[35:43] God's going to do it
[35:45] we believe he's going to do it God is
[35:48] only interested
[35:49] in US believing amen praise God second
[35:52] Corinthians 10 3-4 says for though we
[35:56] walk in the flesh
[35:58] you might be in the flesh we do not war
[36:01] after the flesh
[36:04] we're not dealing with flesh and blood
[36:05] he says for the weapons of our Warfare
[36:08] are not carnal they're not our ways
[36:13] they're not the way that we see things
[36:19] well there you go but Mighty through God
[36:21] to the pulling down of strongholds and
[36:25] if there's any strongholds in your life
[36:27] guess what you stay with the word you
[36:31] stay under the leadership of the mighty
[36:33] Angel you allow your spirit to come
[36:36] under subjection you get into your
[36:38] position in the word of God halleluia
[36:41] you find your place in Christ and then
[36:44] you get into partnership with the Lord
[36:46] greater is he that is in you than he
[36:49] that is in the world and everything
[36:51] starts to change amen hallelujah glory
[36:55] to God we need to you know but the thing
[36:57] is this we need to come to a place where
[36:59] we find that balance between us and the
[37:03] Lord
[37:05] you know it's a balance between God
[37:08] doing it all
[37:09] and you doing it all
[37:12] because in your mind as a human being
[37:15] remember as long as you're human
[37:17] you've got a will
[37:20] you've got this thing that that that's
[37:22] been placed in you which is called Pride
[37:26] to do things
[37:28] to be good at it
[37:31] to to to be better than than the rest
[37:34] you know that's all characteristics of
[37:36] this nature that God placed you know on
[37:40] us here on this Earth because of the
[37:43] human nature
[37:45] but there's a supernatural change that's
[37:48] taking place within us that the carnal
[37:51] mind is being moved aside and the
[37:53] supernatural mind of Christ is taking
[37:55] over amen
[37:57] but my spirit and your spirit should not
[38:01] lead us
[38:02] it should be the Holy Spirit that's
[38:04] leading us
[38:05] amen because if we're going to partner
[38:08] with God and and we're and and we're
[38:10] gonna work together in bringing this uh
[38:14] Supernatural body change that we're
[38:16] looking forward to then we need to
[38:19] partner with god with the right attitude
[38:21] Alleluia praise God it's a paradox but
[38:25] attitude is important
[38:27] your attitude will determine your
[38:30] altitude with the Lord
[38:33] because when you get rebellious and you
[38:35] get you know where you want to do it
[38:38] your way and it's my way or no way then
[38:41] God can't use you
[38:43] it's as simple as that Alleluia
[38:46] we have no confidence in the flesh
[38:49] so never overestimate the value of
[38:53] yourself
[38:56] you know it's part of humility
[38:58] it's part of humbling yourself before
[39:00] the Lord
[39:01] you know we we need to be you know uh
[39:06] we need to be very reverent towards the
[39:09] Lord
[39:11] and towards one another
[39:13] towards situations that we're dealing
[39:16] with on a daily basis
[39:18] you know tonight we're talking about you
[39:21] know because we chose because he chose
[39:24] because we chose a harder way because
[39:27] he's chosen a harder way for our lives
[39:29] when he chose our lives he chose a
[39:32] harder way but we need to realize that
[39:35] he's the one that chose
[39:36] he's the one that's taking control he's
[39:39] the one that's directing us guiding us
[39:41] and so we need to submit ourselves to
[39:44] that Supernatural element and allow him
[39:47] to do it glory to God Amen every thought
[39:51] that we think
[39:53] as human beings
[39:55] are against God
[39:59] our carnal Minds
[40:01] everything the way we see things the way
[40:03] we want to do things it's foolishness
[40:05] unto the Lord
[40:07] but when we filter it through the word
[40:09] of God it comes out a lot different and
[40:12] all of a sudden the supernatural can
[40:14] anoint the word of God and move us by
[40:17] the spirit
[40:18] Hallelujah we cannot trust our thoughts
[40:21] and actions we're too carnal glory to
[40:25] God the word is what judges all things
[40:28] not you not me but the word will judge
[40:32] the circumstances will judge the
[40:34] situations in our lives amen we need to
[40:38] recognize Who We Are
[40:41] and to deny that Christ Is In the Flesh
[40:44] and that he's now taking control
[40:47] is Antichrist
[40:49] we should not allow you know ourselves
[40:52] to to just become so carnal that we that
[40:56] that we don't recognize that there's a
[40:58] supernatural element within us that's
[41:01] fulfilling the word of God
[41:02] amen praise God listen here
[41:07] in Matthew
[41:10] chapter or sorry in Mark 16 verses 15 to
[41:14] 20 I want to read this
[41:16] now bear in mind we're we're we're we're
[41:19] working with the Lord
[41:22] everything that we're doing
[41:24] we're doing it so that perfect faith can
[41:27] come into our walk
[41:29] so that we can recognize that God is
[41:32] using us
[41:33] God needs us God wants to use us God
[41:37] wants to do great things through our
[41:39] lives we need to realize the balance
[41:42] between us our choices and God's choices
[41:46] but listen here in Mark 16 he says and
[41:51] he said unto them go ye into all the
[41:53] world and preach the gospel to every
[41:55] creature
[41:56] this is our commission he that believeth
[41:59] and is baptized shall be saved but he
[42:02] that believeth not shall be damned and
[42:06] these signs shall follow them that
[42:08] believe in my name shall they cast out
[42:10] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[42:13] they shall take up serpents and if they
[42:15] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[42:18] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[42:20] and they shall recover
[42:23] so then after the Lord had spoken unto
[42:26] them now this is where you got to pay
[42:27] attention he was received up into heaven
[42:31] and sat on the right hand of God
[42:35] and they went forth and preached
[42:38] everywhere
[42:40] now the key words the Lord working with
[42:44] them
[42:46] God is working with us
[42:50] God desires to do great things but he
[42:54] needs us to recognize that we have a
[42:57] part to do with it but he's the one
[42:59] that's doing it it's almost a paradox
[43:02] but we need to believe the Paradox
[43:04] because when we believe the Paradox it
[43:08] it humbles us it allows us to submit to
[43:11] the word of God it allows us to come
[43:13] under the leadership of the ministry and
[43:15] the way that God has designed the church
[43:17] that God is now using a five-fold
[43:20] Ministry to minister and speak the word
[43:23] of life and position each and every son
[43:26] and daughter of God so that they can
[43:28] fulfill this partnership with the Lord
[43:31] hallelujah the Lord working with them
[43:34] and confirming the word with signs
[43:38] following Hallelujah God is going to
[43:41] confirm his word and there's going to be
[43:43] Supernatural signs that will follow your
[43:45] life
[43:47] you need to recognize that that if you
[43:50] are now in the in the under you're under
[43:53] the leadership of God you recognize your
[43:55] day in the message you've recognized
[43:57] that God has called you he hasn't called
[44:00] you to just be a church member he's
[44:02] called you to fulfill his word
[44:05] he's in you greater is he that is in you
[44:08] that's going to fulfill the word but yet
[44:09] he needs you
[44:11] Hallelujah glory to God Amen amen listen
[44:15] in um
[44:18] in numbers 33 50 to 55 and the Lord
[44:22] spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab
[44:24] by Jordan near Jericho saying Speak unto
[44:28] the children of Israel and say unto them
[44:30] when ye are passed over Jordan into the
[44:32] land of Canaan then ye shall drive out
[44:35] all the inhabitants of the land before
[44:38] you and destroy their pictures and
[44:41] destroy all their molten images and and
[44:44] quite pluck down all their high places
[44:47] and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants
[44:51] of the land and dwell therein I have
[44:54] given you the land to possess it
[44:58] but yet he says you got to go and
[45:00] possess it
[45:01] you've got something that you've got to
[45:03] do but yet he says but I've given it to
[45:05] you so so so there's the Paradox right
[45:08] there so here we are now we're living
[45:10] this word we're walking this word we're
[45:13] we're we're we're the word made flesh in
[45:15] this hour and yet you know we're in a
[45:18] human form and and we're having battles
[45:21] in our minds as to whether things are
[45:24] going to work out or not
[45:26] God has a plan
[45:28] even when you walk the wrong way it's
[45:31] going to turn you back and bring you
[45:34] back because all things are going to
[45:36] work together for good
[45:39] to them that are called according to his
[45:41] purpose
[45:43] Hallelujah glory to God and he's you
[45:46] know he goes in here and you shall
[45:48] divide the land by lot and inheritance
[45:50] among your families and more and you
[45:52] shall give an inheritance glory to God
[45:54] Amen praise God look god listen to
[45:56] brother Branham here the Good Shepherd
[45:58] of the sheep look God told Israel way
[46:00] down in Egypt I have given you Palestine
[46:03] now he couldn't just just went up there
[46:06] and excommunicated the whole thing run
[46:08] them all out of the with a plague God
[46:11] could have done that God could have
[46:12] killed every every one of them off he
[46:15] could have went up there and sent fear
[46:17] among them and drove them out of the
[46:19] country but he said Israel it's yours
[46:22] you go get it
[46:24] so you've got a work to do
[46:27] you've got to possess this position that
[46:30] God has given you in Christ
[46:33] glory to God because the land that was
[46:36] given that was that was being given on
[46:38] his inheritance was their position in
[46:41] the word
[46:42] that's your position in the word and if
[46:46] you are slack and you're not doing what
[46:48] God wants you to do you're not
[46:49] assembling yourself you're not joining
[46:52] the ministry you're not supporting the
[46:54] ministry you're not paying your tithes
[46:56] you're not giving your offerings you
[46:58] don't got a revelation of this message
[47:02] it's as simple as that
[47:04] if you have a revelation you will
[47:06] support the work of God hallelujah
[47:10] praise God God doesn't listen
[47:14] go reach down and get them by the neck
[47:17] he says the land is yours every bit of
[47:19] it now the people today are expecting
[47:21] God to reach down and get them by the
[47:23] neck say yes that's right you bring me
[47:26] out clean me off heal me and I'll
[47:28] believe you
[47:29] God doesn't do his business that way
[47:33] Hallelujah he gives you the promise but
[47:36] you have got to fight for every inch of
[47:39] ground that you possess
[47:41] you see so many people say oh well you
[47:44] know brother how's how's it going you
[47:45] know how's it going with that job did
[47:48] you get that job he says well yeah you
[47:50] know we're working on it the Lord's
[47:52] gonna open the doors
[47:54] yeah but you know are you doing your
[47:57] party you're getting out there you're
[47:58] knocking some doors are you are you are
[48:00] you throwing the rock up
[48:02] because if you don't throw the rock up
[48:03] I'm just using that as an example I
[48:05] don't care what it is whether it's a
[48:07] sickness you know you there's whatever
[48:10] it is you've got some part to do you've
[48:14] got to possess that possession that God
[48:17] has given you he said I'm the Lord God
[48:19] that healeth all of thy diseases amen
[48:23] praise God you've got to possess that
[48:25] promise
[48:26] you're not going to just lay back and
[48:29] say oh well if it's the Lord's will for
[48:31] me to die I'm gonna die
[48:33] that's true
[48:35] but he's looking at your attitude
[48:38] he might knock you down because he wants
[48:40] you to get up
[48:42] he wants you to know what's in you
[48:45] that he's there but you've gotta you
[48:47] gotta you gotta take a step you gotta
[48:49] move forward there's something that
[48:51] you've got to do amen hallelujah glory
[48:54] to God yes he gives you the promise but
[48:57] you've got to fight for every inch why
[49:00] didn't God just go over there and just
[49:02] run out all the amorites and the
[49:04] Hittites and the and the parasites and
[49:08] all of them why didn't he just run them
[49:10] all out
[49:11] in the in the message stand still no
[49:14] Israel had something to do and you've
[49:17] got something to do he says God said the
[49:20] land is yours go and possess it
[49:24] hallelujah praise God amen glory to God
[49:28] listen Noah Genesis 6 13 22 and God said
[49:33] unto Noah we're going to look at some
[49:35] individuals that partnered with God
[49:38] and when they came under that that
[49:40] partnership and that leadership of the
[49:42] Holy Spirit they recognized they had a
[49:45] part to do like we said on Sunday if I'm
[49:47] going to choose a partner if God chose
[49:49] you it's because he knew that you would
[49:51] be able to do it
[49:52] God chose you because he knew you'd say
[49:55] Amen to his word
[49:57] God knew that you would take on the
[49:59] responsibility you would take on the
[50:01] challenge you would you would you would
[50:03] fight the good fight amen praise God and
[50:07] so here now Noah God said unto Noah the
[50:09] end of All Flesh has come before me for
[50:12] the Earth is filled with violence
[50:13] through them and behold I will destroy
[50:16] them with the Earth
[50:18] make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms
[50:21] Thou shalt you know and he gives them
[50:23] all the instructions and then write down
[50:25] to verse 21 and take thou unto thee of
[50:29] all food that is eaten and thou shalt
[50:31] gather it to thee and it shall be for
[50:34] food for thee and for them thus did Noah
[50:37] according to all that God commanded him
[50:41] so he did and when Noah did what God
[50:45] commanded him to do guess what
[50:48] he built an ark
[50:51] he built the the the the very uh uh word
[50:55] of God that God had given him
[50:58] that he was to manifest
[51:00] built everything that he needed to be
[51:04] delivered
[51:05] and to interpret God's word which said
[51:09] that only you in your household will I
[51:11] save
[51:14] he obeyed God he did everything Against
[51:18] All Odds
[51:20] they thought he was a cuckoo
[51:22] God gave him instruction to go and
[51:25] gather all this wood build this huge Ark
[51:28] but he did it against all the odds
[51:32] he didn't care what the people were
[51:35] saying
[51:36] he recognized that God had spoken to him
[51:39] have you recognized that
[51:41] have you come into a realization that
[51:44] you've come into contact with the Living
[51:46] God
[51:49] that's what's called us Saints
[51:51] we have a relationship with the Living
[51:55] God
[51:56] hallelujah praise God and then in
[51:59] Hebrews 11 7 by faith so by revelation
[52:04] God made known unto Noah being warned of
[52:07] God of things not seen as yet moved with
[52:10] fear prepared an ark to the saving of
[52:13] his house by the which he condemned the
[52:15] world and became heir of the
[52:18] righteousness which is by faith
[52:24] aren't you glad
[52:26] you can receive revelation
[52:34] you know Satan hates revelation
[52:37] we talk about it all the time
[52:39] every time he hears that word it just
[52:42] hmm
[52:44] because he can't receive revelation
[52:47] Revelation is divine
[52:49] and only to the attributes of God do you
[52:53] know that only an attribute can receive
[52:57] perfect faith
[52:59] Revelation from the Lord
[53:03] you can't get it any other way
[53:06] oh but I was baptized in the name of the
[53:08] Lord Jesus Christ you don't need a
[53:10] revelation on that
[53:12] that's as plain and simple as it's right
[53:15] in the scripture nobody can tell me that
[53:18] anybody was ever baptized in the name of
[53:20] the father Son and Holy Ghost I don't
[53:22] care who you are bring me your Bible and
[53:24] show me where somebody was ever baptized
[53:26] into the titles of the Father the Son
[53:29] and the Holy Ghost I'll show you 8 000
[53:31] baptisms in the Bible where every one of
[53:34] them were in the name of the Lord Jesus
[53:36] Christ
[53:36] so you do not need a revelation on the
[53:39] baptism
[53:42] you need a revelation of Who You Are
[53:46] once you come into a revelation of Who
[53:48] You Are
[53:50] then everything just makes sense
[53:52] all the word starts to become simple and
[53:55] plain because now God has given you his
[53:58] thoughts
[53:59] on what he meant in the word
[54:02] Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[54:06] praise God
[54:08] you know David one time you know in the
[54:10] book of Samuel David one time
[54:13] um then said David listen Samuel 17
[54:16] 45-52 David came into a relationship
[54:19] with the Lord you know he was out in the
[54:21] fields you know he was tending over the
[54:24] Sheep he was just a an ordinary guy you
[54:26] know he had other brothers that were a
[54:28] lot bigger than him and Dad thought that
[54:31] you know that David was just you know
[54:33] like uh like you know
[54:35] a ruddy you know kid you know out there
[54:38] you know smelling with the Sheep but God
[54:40] was building a relationship with David
[54:43] because David had a work to do David had
[54:47] to interpret the word of God in his day
[54:49] amen praise God and listen to David here
[54:52] and to Samuel then said David to the
[54:55] Philistine thou cometh to me with a
[54:58] sword
[54:59] now this is after you know David had a
[55:01] good relationship with with the Lord I
[55:04] hope that you've developed this kind of
[55:06] a relationship with the Lord amen I want
[55:08] you to put yourself in this place like
[55:10] David halleluia thou cometh to me with a
[55:14] sword and with a spear and with a shield
[55:16] but I come to thee in the name of the
[55:19] Lord of hosts
[55:21] Hallelujah the god of the armies of
[55:25] Israel whom thou Hast defiled he said
[55:29] this day will the Lord deliver thee unto
[55:33] my hand and I will smite thee and take
[55:36] thine head from thee and I will give the
[55:40] carcass of the host of the Philistines
[55:42] this day unto the fowls of the air and
[55:45] to the wild beasts of the earth that all
[55:48] the Earth may know that there is a God
[55:50] in Israel Glory Hallelujah my God David
[55:55] when he stood up against that 14-foot
[55:58] giant all the people were looking and
[56:00] laughing at him and saying look at that
[56:02] look at him
[56:04] imagine him thinking that he's going to
[56:06] go up and he didn't even put any armor
[56:07] on and even even Goliath looked at him
[56:10] and laughed and was laughing and saying
[56:13] what you send me this dog you send me
[56:16] this this this little runt over here and
[56:19] you think that you're gonna no no David
[56:21] had a revelation
[56:23] David had an understanding in him he
[56:27] knew God was a deliverer amen do you
[56:30] know that God is a deliverer tonight do
[56:32] you know that God regardless of whatever
[56:34] you're facing I don't care what you're
[56:36] facing whatever regardless of what it is
[56:39] he's still the same God that can deliver
[56:42] you Hallelujah and if you've got a
[56:44] revelation on that then you've got
[56:46] something in your hand like David had
[56:49] Hallelujah he had some stones in his bag
[56:52] and he pulled one out Hallelujah glory
[56:55] to God and he put it into that sling and
[56:58] he knew that when he was when he was
[57:00] slinging that thing he knew that listen
[57:02] he he knew that a rock a small rock was
[57:05] not going to take down a a man of that
[57:08] stature of that size but it took the
[57:10] supernatural to come on the scene
[57:12] brother Corey oh yeah God knew that he
[57:16] would have to come on the scene to honor
[57:18] his word to back up his word he says
[57:22] I've made you my partner David don't you
[57:25] worry you've you've done all that I've
[57:27] asked you to do glory to God you've
[57:30] taken the instruction you've obeyed the
[57:32] instruction and now you're standing up
[57:34] against this giant he's going to be
[57:36] nothing to you just the same way I slew
[57:39] that lion that bear he says I can slay
[57:43] anything in your life glory to God he
[57:45] had faith and it wasn't the stone it
[57:48] wasn't the stone and the speed of the
[57:51] stone it was the anointed word of God
[57:53] that got behind that stone and honored
[57:56] the word of God and that stone smote him
[57:58] right between the eyes
[58:02] and he had to fall
[58:04] I don't care what you're dealing with
[58:07] it'll fall
[58:09] if you believe
[58:11] if you're in that relationship with the
[58:13] Lord there's nothing that can stand
[58:16] before you he says I'll be with you
[58:20] he said just be of good courage
[58:23] be of good courage
[58:26] he said a couple of times be of good
[58:28] courage there's nothing that can stand
[58:31] before you I've given it to you
[58:33] God has given you the rapture
[58:36] God has given you the body change
[58:39] this is the message of this hour we can
[58:43] talk about all kinds of things it
[58:45] doesn't matter we can get into all kinds
[58:47] of studies but it's always going to come
[58:49] right back to the Rapture of this church
[58:53] I couldn't get away from it I remember
[58:55] the very first when the Lord asked me to
[58:58] minister the word
[59:00] the only thing that would that would
[59:03] inspire me
[59:04] was the rapture
[59:06] my first message I remember it as you
[59:09] know because once in a while I go
[59:10] through you know some of my messages and
[59:12] I go right back and I see 1995 and the
[59:15] first message was caught up together
[59:18] caught up together to be with the Lord
[59:20] and I thought where in the world did you
[59:22] get that
[59:24] it's because the word the attribute was
[59:28] in here
[59:30] it was it was coming into manifestation
[59:33] and the word for this hour is the
[59:36] rapture
[59:37] Hallelujah everything that we've
[59:39] preached is about the rapture
[59:42] everything that the mighty Angel is
[59:44] giving you is Faith for the Rapture it's
[59:46] giving you faith for the change giving
[59:49] you Faith to walk this walk with
[59:51] confidence
[59:54] Allelujah glory to God Amen
[59:57] thank you Jesus
[1:00:00] having a good time by the grace of God
[1:00:02] because
[1:00:04] this message is is just remarkable glory
[1:00:08] to God hallelujah
[1:00:10] bless the name of the Lord Romans 7 for
[1:00:12] I know that in me that is in my flesh
[1:00:17] you know that you can't be looking to
[1:00:19] your own
[1:00:20] ability here
[1:00:21] in me that is in my flesh
[1:00:25] you know he had he had a revelation here
[1:00:28] dwelleth no good thing
[1:00:31] for to do for to will is present with me
[1:00:35] but how to perform that which is good I
[1:00:37] find not
[1:00:39] you see that's that's the Paradox Saints
[1:00:42] but he didn't say
[1:00:45] anything about the attribute
[1:00:48] he said greater is that
[1:00:50] that's in you and me that will overcome
[1:00:53] that will
[1:00:55] meet the challenges of the day that will
[1:00:58] overcome that will do listen listen to
[1:01:01] brother Brown here he's speaking here in
[1:01:03] 1955.
[1:01:05] he says did you know a man's worth only
[1:01:08] 84 cents in chemicals just enough
[1:01:11] chemicals about him a little bit of
[1:01:13] calcium and just enough whitewash to
[1:01:15] sprinkle A Hen's Nest and you know just
[1:01:18] just a few chemicals and then you walk
[1:01:20] around like you're worth a hundred
[1:01:22] million dollars
[1:01:25] and what are you anyhow
[1:01:27] that's what any of us is after a while
[1:01:30] we're going to lay out there in a
[1:01:32] graveyard and rot away we're not we're
[1:01:35] going to be changed now if God decides
[1:01:38] that we're going to lay this thing down
[1:01:40] well
[1:01:42] the Lord's will be done
[1:01:44] the lord giveth the lord taketh but I
[1:01:47] believe we're going to see the change
[1:01:49] halleluia I believe we're right there
[1:01:51] but that soul brother that's in there
[1:01:54] tonight in the front of God is worth 10
[1:01:56] million worlds that's right you'll take
[1:01:59] care of that 84 cents but you'll just
[1:02:02] let anything come into that Soul no sir
[1:02:05] we feed on the word of God
[1:02:08] that's what we feed on that's that's our
[1:02:11] that's our life source that means
[1:02:14] everything to us amen glory to God

[1:02:34] he said I am the vine you are the
[1:02:37] branches he that abideth in me
[1:02:40] and in him the same bringeth forth much
[1:02:43] fruit for without me you can do nothing
[1:02:53] but the Lord says I I need you
[1:02:56] I need you to come into your position
[1:03:00] I need you to stop with all your own
[1:03:03] interpretations
[1:03:06] don't look to the left don't look to the
[1:03:08] right just look straight down the middle
[1:03:09] of the road and stay balanced in the
[1:03:11] word of God
[1:03:12] allow the spirit of God to lead you and
[1:03:15] guide you this is the hour where we're
[1:03:17] being refined
[1:03:19] Ephesians chapter 4 for the perfecting
[1:03:22] of the church that's the Joshua
[1:03:25] commission amen halleluia
[1:03:28] God always likes to work through men God
[1:03:32] is working through us God needs us
[1:03:34] hallelujah
[1:03:36] it's God's program to work through men
[1:03:41] God wants to work through us men and
[1:03:46] women by the way
[1:03:47] Hallelujah do you believe that
[1:03:50] God works through men he made man his
[1:03:53] helper on Earth
[1:03:55] he made he made man a Lesser God than
[1:03:59] himself that's 1960 the unfailing
[1:04:01] realities of the Living God amen glory
[1:04:04] to God blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:04:07] Jesus thank you Lord
[1:04:09] glory to God therefore listen
[1:04:13] brother Brian the identified Christ of
[1:04:15] all ages so therefore he could tell the
[1:04:18] end from the beginning and in each age
[1:04:20] he lauded so much of his word in each
[1:04:24] age
[1:04:25] you know that you're that little lot
[1:04:28] that came in under that seventh seal
[1:04:33] you've heard about you know the seals in
[1:04:36] the Army there are special Elite group
[1:04:39] of individuals
[1:04:42] that are sent out as a special force
[1:04:46] they're like the special forces the
[1:04:48] seals
[1:04:49] they go and they deal with with things
[1:04:52] under
[1:04:54] inspiration and Revelation that nobody
[1:04:56] else has
[1:04:57] not even the other people that are in
[1:05:00] the lower ranks of the armies they don't
[1:05:02] know what they're up to
[1:05:05] God has a people like that here on this
[1:05:08] Earth right now
[1:05:10] we seem very strange in our ways we seem
[1:05:13] very strange in in our preaching
[1:05:15] it's it's like it's like our preaching
[1:05:18] is different but why is it different
[1:05:20] because it's it's full of Revelation
[1:05:23] it's full of inspiration
[1:05:26] it's full of God it's God speaking lip
[1:05:29] to ear to individuals giving them
[1:05:32] personal
[1:05:33] experiences and and and walking with
[1:05:36] them in a special Supernatural personal
[1:05:38] way
[1:05:39] and it makes us completely different
[1:05:41] Hallelujah
[1:05:43] but here he says he allotted a portion
[1:05:47] in each age and then usually man gets
[1:05:49] its Soul twisted up and the world gets
[1:05:52] in such a shape until he has to send
[1:05:54] some man anointed
[1:05:57] all ages has been the same this is from
[1:06:01] the message the identified Christ of all
[1:06:04] ages
[1:06:05] he's identifying himself again tonight
[1:06:10] in the message of this hour halleluia he
[1:06:14] says all ages as being the same he
[1:06:17] identifies himself upon the Earth in man
[1:06:19] God does nothing without man the Bible
[1:06:23] said so you know see he's always takes
[1:06:27] man because it was man he had to use and
[1:06:31] let the man put him on free moral agency
[1:06:34] knowing that he would fall
[1:06:38] in order to display his attributes as a
[1:06:42] savior
[1:06:43] all these things for there was nothing
[1:06:46] lost and therefore he chose man he could
[1:06:49] have chose Stars he could have chose
[1:06:51] trees but he chose man glory to God
[1:06:54] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:06:57] in 1959
[1:07:00] now he says well here Luke Luke chapter
[1:07:03] 10 verse 2 he says therefore said said
[1:07:06] he unto them the Harvest truly is great
[1:07:09] but the laborers are few pray ye
[1:07:12] therefore the lord of the Harvest that
[1:07:13] he would send forth laborers into his
[1:07:16] Harvest
[1:07:17] why why is it that if God chose us God
[1:07:22] knows each and every one of us he chose
[1:07:24] us from before the foundations of the
[1:07:26] world
[1:07:27] but yet he's calling laborers to the
[1:07:31] Harvest he's saying come on
[1:07:34] take possession of your land take your
[1:07:37] position in Christ
[1:07:39] do what God has laid upon your heart God
[1:07:42] has placed certain gifts in you he
[1:07:45] didn't Place those gifts in you so that
[1:07:47] they could just sit idle
[1:07:49] he said stir the gift
[1:07:51] stir the the the the placing that God
[1:07:54] has given you get into your position and
[1:07:58] do what God needs you to do so that he
[1:08:00] can accomplish his plan
[1:08:03] why does he need to call laborers he
[1:08:05] says now watch it says in in my new
[1:08:07] ministry he says now now you say well if
[1:08:10] he knows it then then why are you
[1:08:12] preaching
[1:08:13] that's God it's part of God's program if
[1:08:16] God knew that everything if God knew the
[1:08:19] end from the beginning
[1:08:20] then why does he need to preach why does
[1:08:23] he need us to go and preach the word of
[1:08:25] God
[1:08:25] why am I up here tonight
[1:08:28] why do we have a church that we have to
[1:08:31] gather into
[1:08:32] because God has a program
[1:08:35] God has a plan
[1:08:36] God's calling a people into their
[1:08:39] positions so that they can go in the
[1:08:42] Fulfillment of the Rapture amen glory to
[1:08:46] God when he looked upon the apostles he
[1:08:48] looked upon the Harvest he said the
[1:08:51] Harvest is ripe but the laborers are few
[1:08:54] pray the Lord of the Harvest that he
[1:08:56] will send laborers into the Harvest how
[1:08:59] many remembers that well why would they
[1:09:02] have to pray to the Lord of harvest to
[1:09:05] send laborers into the into his Harvest
[1:09:07] if the lord of the Harvest was standing
[1:09:09] there knowing it would be done why God
[1:09:13] has so arranged it that's his now listen
[1:09:17] to this God has so arranged it that his
[1:09:21] program cannot move without you and I
[1:09:27] hmm
[1:09:29] and as long as we're not doing what God
[1:09:32] leads us to do we're paralyzing his
[1:09:36] program
[1:09:38] but when the church moves
[1:09:40] by the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:43] then we're in God's will doing
[1:09:46] his program
[1:09:49] let the musicians come
[1:09:53] Hallelujah glory to God
[1:09:59] the unveiling of god notice then we then
[1:10:02] we become part of him as you are the
[1:10:05] veil that veils him
[1:10:08] you and I are veiling
[1:10:12] the interpretation of God's word for
[1:10:15] this hour
[1:10:19] Christ in you as Christ was of God
[1:10:23] because God was in him made him God and
[1:10:27] as Christ is in you the hope of glory
[1:10:29] you become part of Christ he that
[1:10:32] believeth on me the works that I shall
[1:10:34] do he also see you become part of Christ
[1:10:38] as long as Christ is hid in you then
[1:10:43] it's veiled to the unbeliever
[1:10:46] but you know
[1:10:47] he is in you
[1:10:49] you are the temple
[1:10:52] you are templing Christ that's behind
[1:10:55] the veil the skin
[1:10:57] that we behind because of this Veil The
[1:11:01] Veil again in human flesh hides God the
[1:11:04] word
[1:11:05] from the unbeliever
[1:11:08] aren't you glad that you're a Believer
[1:11:09] tonight
[1:11:11] aren't you glad that God by his grace
[1:11:15] and mercy has allowed you to hear his
[1:11:18] word recognize the day that you're
[1:11:20] living in recognize that he's doing
[1:11:22] something in this day that's going to
[1:11:25] change
[1:11:26] and because you were called to it
[1:11:29] everything concerning your whole life
[1:11:31] all your all your fears all your doubts
[1:11:35] all your plans you know people have oh I
[1:11:38] gotta I need a big retirement fund you

[1:11:43] lot of money for my retirement you know
[1:11:45] I need to have this and I need to have
[1:11:47] that and you know all these things are
[1:11:50] good there's nothing wrong with it you
[1:11:51] should have a retirement fund because
[1:11:53] nobody nobody's going to say oh the
[1:11:56] Lord's coming next week
[1:11:58] We Know by the word that that's being
[1:12:01] revealed to us that it could be at any
[1:12:04] time but remember brother Branham in his
[1:12:07] day with the Supernatural and the
[1:12:09] anointing that was happening around him
[1:12:11] he thought it was going to be that same
[1:12:12] night
[1:12:13] he said it could be tonight
[1:12:15] but then the Holy Spirit would come and
[1:12:17] unveil more of his word
[1:12:19] all of a sudden there was an opening of
[1:12:21] the seals
[1:12:22] there was an opening of the word and and
[1:12:24] now there's a calling that's going on
[1:12:26] and there's and there's a people that
[1:12:28] have come under this tremendous
[1:12:30] leadership of the mighty Angel the
[1:12:32] captain of The Host
[1:12:34] and he's calling us
[1:12:36] to speak
[1:12:39] Shout
[1:12:40] because remember they went seven days
[1:12:42] they were given instruction walk each
[1:12:46] day walk around the walls then go home
[1:12:50] day number two walk around the walls
[1:12:53] then go home you see just like the seven
[1:12:55] Church ages they all had
[1:12:58] an age and they all went home when they
[1:13:01] fulfilled their part in every age but
[1:13:04] then the seventh age came and he says on
[1:13:06] that seventh day I want you to go around
[1:13:08] seven times and I want you to gather the
[1:13:12] people together and I want you to come
[1:13:15] into a Unity I want you to recognize
[1:13:17] what I've done in your day I want you to
[1:13:20] see that there's a great shout right now
[1:13:22] that's taking place because there's a
