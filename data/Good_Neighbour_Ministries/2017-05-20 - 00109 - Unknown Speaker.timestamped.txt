[20:01] God in warning telling him that there
[20:04] was coming A
[20:06] Flock and that he must build
[20:08] an amen so in the Old Testament before

[23:32] they're looking for for something and
[23:34] it's already happened amen
[23:37] hallelujah thank you
[23:41] Lord praise
[23:43] God thank you Lord and so he was called

[25:06] wood it was soft pable so when they must
[25:10] have seen using this wood to make bill
[25:13] this humongous big boat said this man

[25:19] crazy he has to be
[25:23] crazy a steel or some kind of oak tree
