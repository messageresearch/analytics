Christ and all of them we understand from other scriptures that are reliable for power in that city because of this woman's testimony of what happened to her life a novice there are other scriptures that I can leave to be seated I hope read about this comforter of Jesus Christ with the priests when McLoughlin Beelzebub in other words the colorful deadly and then in the other actor ever he said if Rahab can't be you Father because Abraham you be right ever have you mean and if he was here today he would recognize the fact that you do not recognize me tells me that or of your father that death and he's a liar a thief from the beginning and so you are expressing his nature even though it's thousands the years later you're expressing his nature and truly who you are exposing yourself and identifying where you come from and when you're good today I'd like to speak on the priest and the prostitute [Music] it was in this situation it seems to change our life's direction what would be your husband now remember this is like 6 o'clock that evening it's quite light time here is a single 30 30 31 year old to a young man sitting alone where in the evening only the women go to get water and a young Jew is sitting there as if he is waiting on something and she comes along and he well to go with now is somebody else's husband it's natural and so I have to stop you even say that left every left for the reasons why we got there the chapter of our life because you're gonna cross a time we're going to go too far right see you want to pass the cross [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] outside in the priests entire group or on one of the slaves because only the priest could go behind the veil moving and he will ring the bell and instance in the presence of God sacrifices and then he will come Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] how do you say Nelly was the and the stranger when the Bible says call it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] like unclean person like oneness that you were the comfort of presence of the Living God and that's how they appeared but on the inside that woman had a piece of bodywork in Fianna seems a godly piece of God in her never mind what you receive on the outside that run this way or that way it was something there amen the priests had nothing to work with [Music] [Music] [Music] to draw this picture of predestination and representation to condemnation and representation to eternal life amen please God we see here when sister I read Exercises of st. Ignatius Ignatius of Loyola and really that's the standard fundamental book for the Jesuit priest as such my former life of course I interest Catholic priest at the School of Arts or snap and later on he became a Pentecostal or Protestant but the fact is that these priests especially Jesuit which is one the church maybe not they'll have to start the you know first of all and they put you in a Bible College and then they begin the training [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] of the five scientists and all the builders to build these fantastic buildings with higher and higher [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we got some benefits the signs like this the backyard that's another discussion because science does good but what we're taking [Laughter] [Laughter] [Music] hee hee [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we will just show them why you're attracted by the teachings of Jesus [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes because we're in this human body which we are all subject to see but in your final air when one person has a symptom none of those things will get rid of them quickly a separate path where God will rise up I get dinner [Music] right [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] people faithful in a simple way that you know that that every human being is built and then they cover their own atmosphere your nature your spirit gives upper atmosphere and something will you come into the presence and right away it's trained two or more men part make sure the breasts or whatever but the fact is doesn't have a goodness if you are standing here and somebody walks up behind you your ears in here - I only see to do anything about but if this start getting too close of a space but I do something in you senses yeah you don't have to feel torture and that's what I'm talking about
