on our in our series and now we have come to our third Topic in the series on stewardship and our text today will will come out of Luke 16 verse 1-13 in there is a marvelous Parable given by the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah we're here for this Sunday school lesson and I know it's a lot of reading but for you to have the entire background uh we need to read it at least once okay and uh let's uh I'm going to I'm saving my voice so you help me out we want everybody to read it together right we'll begin from chapter 16 from verse 1 and before we do let us pray our dear gracious Heavenly Father once again we exercise the right and privilege of prayer oh may the great Holy Spirit of almighty God hear our voice today honor the word honor thy servant honor your people Lord and send the Holy Spirit to anoint the word may you walk upon the Water one more time and bring life to your people we know father that you have come down with the open book and now father may you be The Interpreter of the word amen to strengthen our hearts and lives and and send light upon our pathway that we may know better how to live and serve thee in the days ahead we ask it in Jesus name to the glory of God Amen and amen amen together with one voice let us read and he said also unto his disciples there was a certain rich man which had a and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods and he called him and said unto him how is it that I hear of this of thee give an account of thy stewardship for thouest no longer be sure then the Ste said with himself within him s what shall I do for my Lord take it away from me this lordship I cannot dig to beg I am ashamed I am resolved what to do that when I am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses so he called every one of his Lord's deers unto him and said unto the first how much thou unto my Lord and he said 100 measures of oil he said unto him take thy bills sit down quickly and write 50 then said he to the other and how much are thou he said 100 measures of week he said take thy bill right Four score and the Lord commanded the just children because he had done wisely for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of life and I say unto you make to yourselves Friends of the man of unrighteousness that when you fail they may receive you into Everlasting habitations he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous man who will commit to you trust the true riches and if you have not been faithful in that which is another man's who shall give you that which is your own no servant can serve two masters for neither either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and and when the Pharisees also who were cious heard all these things and they dered them Hallelujah praise der righted him praise the Lord may the Lord give us understanding and wisdom in his word please be seated glory to God hallelujah amen now I don't know about you but have you ever received or have you been receiving flight s in the mail about investment offers or opportunities um anybody anybody here or otherwise maybe you go to your bank and they're always pushing some investment uh thing at you uh for you to receive praise the Lord I believe you know brother Brandon spoke on the message called Investments um and uh in there I believe there are some quotes that they can there if you advance that okay brother Bram said any businessman if he's a good businessman is interested in good Investments because it pays off it pays off always or it always pays off in fact you invest because you want your Investments to increase amen there's nobody in here invest money uh and give it to the bank and happy that it decreased no sir you know if you go back and look at your bank account and it decreased even if it's genuine bills came out of it sometimes you still feel bad because you really would like your Investments to increase praise God and it looks like there is more opportunities uh coming to you for investment uh than than the money you got to really invest so uh today I'd like us to look at what is God's investment strategy and I know why I'm telling you this because many years ago uh the same thing that happened to brother Brenham one day when he a certain brother he was talking to the brother and in the middle of it all of a sudden the Holy Spirit spoke out and said go to this certain place by that land take there you're going to get oil and of course he went dug and he got discouraged because he wanted quick you know everybody you know most people like quick money they get the lottery or raffle or something um not something for nothing it's okay quick they want quick money so uh it didn't come quick so he gave up and sold it the other man bought the place dug and in less than a day or two he struck oil and the manale of course became very wealthy he rushed back to brother remember our Prophet said that wasn't me that was him so let me tell you the same thing it's not me it's him cuz I don't want anybody coming to me after and said brother speak a word for me because it doesn't work that way I don't even know all of a sudden the holy spirit will speak out it's his purpose amen is his divine plan so some years ago and some Believers didn't know about it there was a brother in the church and he came to me and we were talking and stuff like that the Holy Spirit spoke up and said go and invest on this certain certain stop and he did and within a month or two after that he was holding a half a million dollars from off of that stop that was worth literally like nothing pennies and he was holding half a million dollars it's never happened again but it happened there for real it happened there and he was holding this half a million dollars and after you got the half a million dollars a lot of events starting taking place after all of a sudden next thing you know he was like 8 to 900,000 so much he said brother by a few months more I'll Be A Millionaire praise God hallelujah I said brother you know what what you need to do take that money take half of the money or how much ever you feel in your heart put it in an investment some investment where you yourself can't hardly touch it and allow that part to grow and the other part that you have you can literally not waste it but do whatever you want with it whether it's a house this that whatever do what with it but you have at least some security that that's there working for you yes well he said yes brother yes brother didn't listen to me about a year later you know of course he was going on vacations and going different things and places and uh this is a brother I love I'm just using him as an illustration he's gone to be the Lord now but the fact is within a year right um all the money was God squandered away because he didn't listen to the same voice that told him how to get it he wouldn't listen to the same voice telling him how to use it right and surely as your faith brings the things to you your doubt takes it away Disobedience takes it away you've got to stay with the word of God at every turn and at every Point praise the Lord now um uh look at what the prophet of God says up there you are to have a good investment then if it's not a good it's not good business to keep what you got in your pocket all right because you better put it to work you remember our Lord talking about the talents when you rebuke this children and say why didn't you invest my money why didn't you invest it no you you when I'm talking about what happened there I don't want you to go into a spirit of fear and and then keep all your money in your pocket or in some uh bank account that uh gives you nothing but the fees is reducing it incrementally where you hardly can notice God is saying no you need to invest it yes amen naturally and spiritually praise the Lord hallelujah I might as well tell you I'm here to stir you up amen a great singer says Stir It Up and I'm here to Stir It Up I want you to get stirred up about it praise the Lord that God would have a channel through which to bless you amen praise the Lord hallelujah if you don't have a pipeline in your house there would be no place for you to be able to go and draw fresh water but you got to have a pipeline to the Natural economy whether business whether work whether job whether something you got to have a pipeline right to the ocean to the river to be able to get water you got to have a pipeline to God's economy for God to be able to send his blessings to you that's right whether by a quter in half in 1 in or a great big pip yes sir or truckloads it's up to you it's according to your faith so shall it be unto you if thou can believe all things are possible to them that can believe amen I'm starting to feel Faith lifting Hallelujah while I'm yet speaking I'm becoming sensitive and I can feel it starting to lift so thanks be to God hallelujah amen now half for the Parables Jesus told in the Bible had to deal with money and it's because money has a very important part to play in our lives and you can become super spiritual and and and just say you don't need to have money or you don't have need to have any of these things um but as I usually say you're not just going to pray to God and then all of a sudden a bag of money is going to drop down in your room bang on the ground and you wake up and say oh thank you Jesus and all of a sudden you're blessed you're rich it doesn't happen that way you got to do something for something to happen am you got to have action for reaction Hallelujah do all you can and then stand and wait on God and he will make a way up amen praise the name of the Lord amen now one out of every six verses in Matthew Mark Luke and John deal with money or with material blessings you remember when Peter asked the Lord he said Lord what will we get after the rest stay behind and kind of push Peter and say go ask him go ask him say what shall we get for following you now that sounds caral you have the privilege of Walking With Jesus the Messiah and you are going to ask him about caral things how to get blessed with money how to improve your State status in life how to lift your social condition those are natural things why would you talk to the Lord about that only ask God about how to get holy how to be humble but you see we are both human natural and we spiritual and you're not in heaven yet and you got to balance the two things you got to ask him to bless you so you can keep I know you want to worship him with your soul but you got to eat and live to keep Body and Soul together hallelujah amen how would it be like if I came to church here to preach only to Invisible Souls All Souls church and it's just soul but we need your soul with your body Hallelujah and God knows that so he wants to bless you naturally and spiritually so that you can PR together and when he raises you up he going to raise your take your soul and he raise up your body together praise the Lord they both got a go there praise to God so Jesus even spoke more about money than Heaven he spoke more about money than hell right and friends I think that should be interesting to us because I believe God is trying to say he knows the tremendous influence and impact money has in our lives and we cannot avoid it everywhere you turn the world system is set up to operate with money and it's set up in a way to get you in depth or indebted yes there is a pattern of global enslavement uh through their systems we won't talk about that now but just to for you to earn just enough when I was in school uh I got to repeat it again I was taken in a special class aside with just a few and this professor was teaching he says now what I'm going to tell you here is not normally known now you understand that some people in the economy have to be deliberately kept at a certain level because the business class and the investment class and the 1% needs to have an a pool of workers always available that they can di into to carry on the industries of the nation right and that's the reason also why we have a welfare system and even when some people are not even trying to get off of it they're left on it because you got to have that available tool always so that they can reach and get it and if we can't get it then we resort to immigration that keeps the wages and then he goes on with his economic theories and so on their wages at a certain level where they can control things so I just want to show you friends just enough that you can get by eat live wear clothes and you keeping a rat race where you work eat sleep wear go back to work again to get some more to eat sleep wear and the cyle continues and they'll keep it on going until the day you die is that right until you have you decide you got a right idea and you do something and you smash it where now you free yourself from that uh kind of enslavement and then you you still do it but you do it not because you want to do it right not because you have to do it but you're doing it not because you're free to do it I just thought I'd throw that in uh right now even though I don't have that in my notes Here praise the Lord hallelujah so money has great influence over our lives are you going to listen to to me here today yes sir just give me the opportunity to lay this out and it will change your life amen it'll change the way you think about things praise the Lord amen now we know we spend most of our time earning money do you realize that you actually spend more hours working for money than you do or anything else hallelujah praise absolutely only the Christian the dedicated Christian or the True Believer uses more time in the sense that whether we working sleeping eating waiting the Lord is on our hearts 247 we giv him the glory giving him the praise doesn't matter where we are what we're doing we are we are consumed with the presence of the Lord amen hallelujah but the rest of them out there they they're caught up only in a rat race right is that right amen they're caught up in a rat race and that's all they have to do so the fact that we spend Christian or unchristian most of our Lives earning money God has to tell us how to use money which represents the time of your life how much of time in your lifetime you use up to earn that money how to use it wisely nobody wants to live a wasted life right nobody wants to live a wasted life so God has to tell you how to wisely use what he has allowed you to get and or or keep in your lifetime or during your lifetime now we know even in the natural realm social uh Sciences government reports will tell you 56% of all divorces in the world occurs because of money you say Amen like you know expose something in your own walk or something praise that's what you can keep quiet on 56% of all divorces occur because of fight Financial tensions in the home right that is absolute fact not according to me but according to different places I've looked up amen praise the Lord hallelujah and if you don't manage your money well your money is going to manage you you've got to become a money Master our money is going to master you and rule over you over you praise the Lord now the Bible teaches us in that TR fact that money is a test praise the Lord money is a test is a spiritual test that God uses money to test us spiritually to see our our spiritual temperature our spiritual growth and where we are testing us to see if he gives you a little do you get attached to it and then you start cooling off from from him because you have to be busy with the money and not busy with him but when he sees you're faithful this way then he gives you more because he sees it's not getting into your eyes it's not controlling your thoughts and controlling your emotions you're not getting heart attack coming your money and falling over dead because it's so much or anything like that you know of course there was a man in the the town where I came from that was so wealthy and he trusted nobody when his money comes in he has to comfort him El and one day they found him over the table with filled with all the money there dead from a heart attack and uh the wife reported that she went into the room to give him a cup of coffee and he was counting and and he was sweating and and he come after got a heart attack de just like that he's gone counting the money God is saying don't be consumed by it yes and so he has placed in his word and in his economy test to test so that he can test us to see whether the best of us if you don't watch yourself you get you start getting attached to it and you got to come to yourself and break yourself away I don't care who you are you can be as spiritual as you like if you don't watch you will start getting attached to it and you start and then you you you break yourself away praise the lord we we're still human and sometimes we for yet that we are human we we're not up in heaven yet we still down here we got to face everything like everybody else amen but he gives us the power to overcome amen praise God he has given us the power to overcome praise God hallelujah so here me this now listen Luke 1611 if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth who will trust trust you with true riches you see who will trust you this is a this is a really outstanding parable of course in the Bible and when people read it they don't understand what uh Jesus is doing they actually think that he is glorifying a crook or praising a a cheating Steward uh somebody that pull a scheme on his boss they actually will think that but uh this this Parable is actually not even related to uh glorifying dishonesty or anything like that praise God now Luke 16:14 says the Pharisees who love money the living Bible uh heard all this and they were saring at Jesus mocking at him amen you can imagine the mockery of the Christian just like the mockery to Jesus Oh you saying that because you ain't got none foxes have a hole and the birds have a nest but the son of man he don't have nowhere to lay his sweet head all the phes must have laughed at him one suit and the suit you got somebody gave you you can't buy a suit for yourself and you're talking about the money I mean here's a a man that appears to be a beggar trying to advise a banker how to get money and the Pharisees were lacking their heads off the Bible tells us they sneered at him praise God hallelujah but Jesus was saying all you Pharisees you think you're smart but let me give you a model let me teach you something praise God now remember a greater than Solomon is here and he is teaching them a model and I'm going to use a cook for a model I'm going to use this SCP for a model and so you can understand that the people of this world are Sher or wiser than the people of light now he's talking about Believers and he's saying Believers now watch it now this P I'm going to use it to teach you that the people out there in the world are wiser in their generation smarter than the children of light amen the reason why is because the word of God deals with our nature and make us so much like sheep after a while if you don't watch yourself you get so naive yes is that right that you start swallowing anything that is tall to you true amen but he said be wise as a serpent but harmless as a dog praise the name of the Lord and even sheep have two horns rounds is that right they still got the all Testament and the New Testament to defend themselves with praise the Lord and that's what God has given to us praise the Lord what Jesus is really saying is that many unbelievers are wiser than Christians in how they manage their money amen what it's little or well it's much right it's not the amount here that is cting on and say oh brother Simon I only have a little he doesn't Jesus isn't talking about that he's talking about whether you have little or much he says you need to have wisdom in how you manage or handle your money praise the Lord and what he's also saying is we can learn from them yes amen even though they have a different set of values totally opposite to us we can look at them and certainly see a lot of the things that they they they they're doing that it's really wise praise God of course you can admire a person praise a person without agreeing with what they're doing amen you know in America uh their heroes are like Abraham Lincoln George Washington and later on it was uh Jack Kennedy uh and then Ronald Reagan but when you look the History Channel which I saw this week I was looking at that this week if honest a Lincoln was not as honest as they writing him up in history books he did a lot of corrupt and crooked things to get elected and you can go down the list right on down to Mr re say oh the greatest president in the United States he was selling drugs through Oliver North used him to sell drugs to get money to buy guns to give to the resistance in Nicaragua many many other things it's not demeaning any of these men but it's just to show you that you can admire them for what they accomplished but you don't have to agree with them with what they did and their life's values and their styles of what they did there was a there was interesting article news uh brief on CNN where they showed that Mr Reagan and his wife was leading the country by going to psychics and and having witches coming into the White House and doing seanes and all this stuff inside of The White House and that's how they were leading the country just think about it and and brother Bram spoke about this stuff Witchcraft and all this stuff right there white out long before but the fact is brother and sister we can had my people without agreeing with their values or their LIF and this is what Jesus is saying he says now look at the man don't look at his crookedness but look at his wisdom of how he managed money and what he was doing and learn a lesson from this praise the Lord does everybody in here understand what I'm trying to say amen I want to ask you one more time does everybody in here understand what I'm trying to say I ask you to repeat it because I don't want anybody to leave here and said brother Simon was preaching and teaching on to us how to become a crook Jesus is commanding this man this is how it appears it seems that Jesus is commanding this man or praising him for being dishonest right but what he's saying is that the man did something things that we need to learn from listen to the scriptures Luke 16 1-2 Jesus told his disciples there was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions so he called him in and ask him what's this I hear about you give an account of your management because you cannot be a manager any longer now you see the word manager of course the word manager like we thought last week and the week before manager means sure right that's what it means it means sure praise the Lord and we know of course that this Parable it's a parable so it means it's in types it's in symbols it's in Shadows and you got to understand what the Lord God is saying here praise God Amen well now manager you know what that means managing it means managing the possessions or assets of another other than yourself amen that is what you a manager is and God is saying now uh as it says in Genesis 1 Genesis 2 that what sorry that you are managers for me praise the Lord and I put you here to manage the Earth you know God says to man you're supposed to subdue it and rule over it like that and dress the garden and so on we place the whole human race placed here as managers so far Naturally Speaking the human race has been bad managers pollution poison all kinds of stuff like that but that's not what we're talking about here spiritually we're talking about the believer and the management of whatever God has placed under your responsibility after a while we'll have a day of accountability but for right now he is teaching us about have how to have this sense of responsibility Genesis 1:27 to 28 write that down um I I didn't put it up there but you can write that down that's when God tells man I want you to multiply replenish the Earth subd do it have dominion over it and also you can uh dress the the garden uh stuff like that praise the Lord so we were put here to manage the Earth and so everyone in here is a manager do you believe that you said me I just work in the factory you're still a manager praise the Lord your boss don't know it but actually you were his maner amen do you know that cuzz you can pray and move him move let God move him move his thoughts move his heart move them but you got to believe that you got the power amen it's in your hands yes praise the Lord hallelujah I said who got the power amen it's in the name of Jesus praise God because at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow amen and every must confess that Jesus Christ is Lord amen now in this parable of course the man is clearly a crook and cheating his boss praise the Lord now you say brother Simon why did he do that one it was to make friends and two so that later on he can blackmail them Luke 168 says the master commanded the honest manager be because he acted shrewdly amen and he acted shely in other words you did something right even though you did that he did some things right praise the Lord and I want to share that with you what this man did right so we can take lessons from it are you willing amen are you ready for this amen number one he looked ahead Luke 163 the manager said to himself or talked within himself what shall I do the minute the master tell him you're [Music] fire Hallelujah he Tau with himself what shall I do now my master take it away my job has taken away my job I am not strong enough today and I'm ashamed to go and then you see he was already looking ahead why will my future be mhm praise the Lord secondly he didn't only look ahead he planned aead verse four he said I know what I will do when I lose my job here so people will welcome me into their houses into their business back then the house when they say houses doesn't mean the house you live in it means your entire estate all your business and everything else is included in that praise the Lord you see not only this man look ahead but he had a plan amen amen I'm glad I serve a god with a plan amen even though the world looks random like the the trees are just thrown on the grasses everywhere everything is exactly where it's supposed to be and when man thinks he's smart move it out of his place that's what he causes trouble God knows what to grow on the mountain top and what to grow down in the valley he knows what to be in the bottom of the ocean and watchs to fly in the air yes when we try to change it we make a mess of God's ecology and his economy and and the entire anthropological uh world that we Liv in and geological world that we live in Praise the Lord you know it's too bad but a lot of Christians because of some of the nonsense that a lot of preachers have preached to their congregation they don't want to preach this kind the stuff they might you know the people stop planting AE and they go oh I'm going to live by faith but faith is blind amen Faith looks into tomorrow amen is that right amen that you always here you sing about the eyes of Faith the the six SS amen you you know we use common words and throw them about without thinking H you have sight natural and then you have Insight is that right that's the seeing from inside praise God so so we got to understand what it is and we have to plan ahead you don't go blaming God when you get into trouble because you didn't BL and we want to blame God so why did God do this why did God allow me to get in this situation is the choices you made amen hallelujah take accountability for yourself and pull up your socks and pull yourself together and start being wise this is what Jesus is saying look ahead plan ahead and the third thing the man did he acted real quickly right the boss give him notice you're going to leave next week but before he leave he had his plans and so he start to G out to the customers and he called them on the telephone if they had gone back then but Bible says he acted in other words he acted quickly we get to go and visit them and say look how much you old boss once a well I owe so much he said look man cut that down to 50 right between me and you right this is under the table stock no ta right oh man hallah between me and especially said no this is between me and you you know that not words that needs to stay right here right praise God 50% right he goes to the next one he says how much you owe he says so much he cuts back on that b a you said come on man I mean we've been friends for years I mean I got to give you I got to help you out now the person doesn't know he had a plan but he he says man I got to help you out here man I see you in business was having a hard time let me give you a cut here and he gives him a cut and so on well Jesus just used two examples from the man's business but all I'm sure he spread it out far and wide so that there's no way his plan could fail yes somebody is going to take him [Music] in now when you read the scriptures you you can have fun in the scriptures you can enjoy the scriptures because the scriptures are real and it's come to life amen amen praise the name of the Lord God hallelujah glory to God Amen and what Jesus is saying is that in the light of everything that's going to happen in eternity you are to do the same thing with your money do the same thing with your money look ahead PL ahead and act quickly with whatever it is that you're going to do and do it quickly while you have an opportunity is that right work while it is day for the night cometh but you won't be able to work amen whether that means blindness or whe it means death work while it is day for the night cometh amen when you will not be able to work friends that is God's investment strategy right in front of you praise the Lord but thank God Jesus didn't speak things and leave them he turns around and he interprets his own Parable now in verses 19 9 to13 uh Jesus gives us one a purpose a pattern a principle and reveals to us a priority that we ought to path this is what you need to do this is what you want to know about God's management plan first the purpose of God wanting you to [Music] give you've got to understand what is God's purpose Luke 16:9 I tell you use worldly wealth natural money to gain friends for yourself so that when it is gone you will be welcomed into Eternal dwellings does this shock you here this morning oh my use worldly wealth to gain friends so that when you get to heaven they will welcome you in praise God what is he talking about let me go to brother bradle beyond the C of time rejected King also and I heard a voice that spoke to me in the room and it said that this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it no tiredness no jealousy no death no sickness no mortality none could ever grow old amen none could C it was only joy and I heard the cries oh my precious brother my precious brother and they took me to a high place and I said I must be dreaming I looked back and I saw my body laying there on the bed and here come men and women numbers from both sides in the full bloom of their youth hallelujah praise God hallelujah and here they are screaming all of the bre
