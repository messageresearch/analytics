TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends what a joy to be with you again to give god glory honor and praise by worshiping him magnifying him and by the declaration of his word maybe i'll rejoice in christ maybe take the word of god within our hearts and walk in the light as he is in the light praise god now our study today is the church age of pergamos pergamos church age we have gone through the ephesian church age and the church age of smyrna and now here we are at the church age of pergamos i will read our scripture reading now revelation chapter 2 verse 12 on to verse 17 and to the angel of the church in pergamus write these things saith he which had the sharp sword with two edges i know thy works and where thou dwelles even where satan's seat is and thou hold as fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days wherein antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where satan's seat dwell dwelleth but i have a few things against thee because thou has there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed onto idols and to commit fornication so as thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicoletians which thing i hate repent or else i will come unto thee quickly and i will fight against them with this sword of my mouth he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches to him that overcome it will i give to eat of the hidden manner and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man know it saving he that receiveth it god's blessings upon his marvelous and wonderful word our gracious father we ask your divine blessing upon all those presently listening watching the declaration of the word of truth may the great holy spirit who hovered over the waters of the deep in the in the very beginning of all things may he move across the deep waters of the human heart may thy spirit unveil the word giving us divine understanding and wisdom true revelation by the great holy spirit this we ask in jesus name amen and amen praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord it's good to be here once again in this study of the perdamos church age our topic today of course will be martin god's messenger martin god's messenger now as you know in all the other church ages god had messengers from revelation 1 we understand jesus was seen with the seven stars within his hands and walking around the golden candlesticks now those seven stars represent his seven messengers men in the bible called angels angels meaning messengers but these were not heavenly angels but earthly ones sent by the lord jesus christ here upon the earth to bear testimony of his name in every church age upon true time on the face of the earth the seven candlesticks represent the churches that he's walking among his churches and he's looking at them and observing everything they're doing and protecting them meanwhile within the church ages he has those seven messengers we indicated that the apostle paul was the first identified church age messenger even though that that paul was converted after peter and james and many of the other apostles yet god chose him as the book of acts will tell you i have called him to be a light to the gentiles hallelujah and god used paul to bring the light of the word to the gentiles amen and so here it was god used paul and paul being the first messenger his life ministry and ministry and his teachings were all a blueprint or a pattern for for us to be able to recognize the rest of the messengers as they will come through down through the tunnel of time we will see the same characteristics the same approach and attitude to the word of god the same desires tastes and dictates of their mind as we look into the word and so we came through ephesus smyrna and now we are in this great age of pergamus now just to give you some background before we begin to talk about martin himself of course the catholics called him saint martin but according to history he is brother martin we you can call him either one whichever you wish but he was the one identified as the messenger for this pergamos church age now uh pergamum the greek word for pergamos we say pergamos in english was basically in the district of maisea uh of uh asia minor it was watered by three rivers and was one of the greatest and most illustrious cities of asia it was a very a city that was a center of culture you know this high-class dignified culture was in this city and a city that had great libraries especially one great library that was second to none after alexandria they had irrigate irrigated groves and public walks parkways parks where people could walk and talk and relax and let off their stress a city given to great shows and entertainments parties it was truly a great city of sin and their sin was great because of the religious worship that was in the city it was given over the licentiousness sexual sin everywhere and that sexual sin was mixed into the worship for the worship was mixed and intermingled with sexual sin and their god yes which my friend was nothing but a large snake and this large snake was housed in the temple and there that snake was fed it was worshipped as a god within the temple this great big snake was in there fed house and worshiped as their god however thank god in this great city of sin as the bible says god never leaves himself without a witness and within the the very they bought this city was a little flock a small body of believers anointed with the word of god carrying the message of the hour the same message that paul preached they were preaching it within that great city a small group just like elijah had a small group just like gideon had just about 300 people or so that's what what he had against the great mighty empire of the time but god used him with 300 men to defeat them in the name of jehovah amen jesus came on the scene in his day what did he have 12 disciples 12 disciples friends i tell you numbers are wonderful but it's not the number it's the god who is behind you but the battle is not yours but the battle is the lord's samson anointed by the holy ghost was able to defeat the entire philistine army with what a rotten piece of a jawbone of a donkey an ass defeated them everyone why because the spirit of the lord was upon him the spirit of the lord was with him and when the spirit of the lord is with you you are invincible you are the conqueror you are the overcomer when the holy spirit rests upon your life and you are certain of god and convinced by the holy spirit that you are a child of his amen glory to god hallelujah this small group of believers they were in the minority you know most people have to run after the majority run after the majority well every people are in this church or that big church or that big over there oh but god always has a hidden few off to the side that's different that he was used in his own way for his glory and honor and so this small group was not charmed hypnotized or fooled by the richness and beauty of the city but they hated the satanic warship that filled the place the foulness of sin was everywhere the incense of unbelief was everywhere and they lived above sin and they avoided that temple and the people of that temple as much as they could now this age of purgamos lasted for about 300 years that is from 3 12 80 to 6 0 6 a.d so much versus the city of the fergamus now let us talk about this great messenger our brother martin the messenger of god for the pardonless church age join me as we go into this graphic journey of the life of our brother martin not martin luther brother martin of chores amen now we know friends that martin was born 315 a.d in the nation of hungary however most of his great ministry and work was done in the nation of france and especially in the city of tours where he became bishop of tours and later died in 399 a.d he was a wonderful believer a marvelous christian a man anointed and used of god and and let me say this he was also the uncle of saint patrick of the irish or of ireland his story is another story but he was the nephew of uh saint martin or saint martin was the uncle of saint patrick now martin was converted to christ while he was following his career as a soldier and while he was a soldier a great thing happened a cold winter day and there before in the street was an old beggar the bishops passed him by the archbishops richly dressed past the beggar by that did nothing even though he cried for hunger and cried for cold no one paid any attention to his needs or or his desires or his calls or his cries for help but one day as martin was passing by he called out for help martin seeing this poor man's plight and not having any extra garment but the coat that he had on him he took off his coat took a sword cut the coat in half and wrapped his coat around the poor freezing man there in the street and attended to him no doubt you know bought food or something gave it to him the best that he could and then went on his way but that night the lord jesus appeared to martin in a vision and there he stood like the beggar wrapped in martin's half garment that he had wrapped around the beggar it was wrapped around jesus showing that he was that beggar in the street that they all passed by and then he spoke and said martin though you were the least among them yet you are the only one that did this for me and from that time martin who was not yet converted was only a soldier he became converted because of the visitation of the lord and what god did within his heart his life god began to manifest himself through martin's life in a marvelous and wonderful way he left the army and became a leader in the then church which was the roman church he became a leader in it and being a leader in it yet he was very militant against idolatry he could not stand idolatry in any way he cut down their groves and broke up their images and pulled down their so-called high altars confronted the pagans with their evil deeds that they were committed and he challenged them like elijah did with the prophets of baal with the word of god hallelujah and so they caught him and tied him to a tree and took the tree and placed it against a a cliff where they knew there was a gully below and the the tree was already leaning and they did not tie him on the side where he would be safe on the land but that tied him towards the outside of the tree that they knew would surely fall down into the gully and he challenged them that he serves a god that will protect him and provide him and watch over him and he says oh yes we'll cut down the tree and see what your god will do and so they sat down to cut down this tree which they knew already was leaning over the gully or over the cliff and they knew by gravity it will fall towards and over the cliff with him and he would be instantly killed but to their surprise when they cut down the tree it started to fall into the gully and just as it began to fall and they're rushing forward to see what would happen the tree turned back and came back up with martin and fell on them and crushed most of them while the others ran and scattered in every possible way amen hallelujah my friends god used martin in this manner it is written in the historical records that this man our brother martin a believer of the word hallelujah was empowered by god to raise the dead at least three times in recorded history not man-made but recorded by others that were there on the scene that god used him to raise the dead how that a baby my friend was dead and like elijah in the bible he prayed for that dead baby and the dead baby came back to life and health and growth on another occasion a brother was caught by the authorities and carried away for persecution because of believing in the true fullness of the word of god and there martin rushed to find a brother but when he got on the scene the brother was already hanging on a tree his eyes bulging out in his face out of the sockets but martin took him down from off the tree laid him on the ground laid his hands upon him and prayed in the powerful name of jesus and lo and behold in the sight of the pagans and of the believers the brother rose up once more to full health and life and lived for many years for the glory of god they scattered they ran everywhere while believers were praising and thanking and glorifying god for god was using brother martin brother martin had a lot great faith and he believed in acting on the word also brother martin was fearless when it comes to the word he had no he had respect for people but he did not have partiality or respects for all manner of positions dignitaries wealth and all that type of thing he stayed with the word all at all times one time he went to face to face to visit the emperor who was responsible for the death of many of his spirit-filled brethren and the emperor would not uh have an audience with martin he would not allow him to be let into the palace into the throne room and so martin went to a bishop that he knew and the bishop wanted nothing to do with it for he didn't want to be involved and has his position uh undermined or brought into any troubles so martin left when he got back to uh the palace not just the throne room was closed but the doors of the entire palace was closed up to him according to history martin knelt before that doorway and prayed and prayed under the power of god until the holy spirit the people just watched those great sick doors suddenly began to sway open before him and he opened his eyes and the palace doors were open because the guards were all scared nervous ran away they didn't know what was happening but it was the power of god on the scene hallelujah brother martin picked himself up walked in the palace and went into the tron room and there he began to speak to the emperor to tell him what he was doing but with his pride his arrogance the emperor refused to even turn his face to him and turn away to the side and would not listen to martin's uh requests and report of what was happening to the people of the lord while the emperor had his face turned all of a sudden fire came from heaven fire beneath his throne and the emperor had to stand quickly to his feet in front of martin all my friends a servant of god anointed with the holy spirit upon this earth is greater than anyone or anything else upon the face of the earth you remember when pilate said to jesus i have power over you to set you free amen because they brought you up in front of me and i have the power to set you free amen but what pilate did not know it's not that jesus was up before him he was the one that was really up before jesus he was the one that was really in judgment of the word for jesus was the word as simple as he seemed as downtrodden as he seemed as poor as he seemed oh my yet he was the word god was now it was being looked at his reaction how would he act to the word but with his great pomposity position power and and maybe his wealth he said i have authority over you and jesus said you have no authority over me i can call right now ten thousand angels one angel alone would do it but i can call ten thousand just think of it he could have called ten thousand angels to free himself get away from the suffering and not worry about going to the cross to save our sins but the bible tells us he did that he went to calvary he died for you and me and for the glory of god and here it is this emperor would not turn his face towards martin and god taught him a lesson that you should always show respects for god's servants god's anointed servants god's proven vindicated servants always honor and pay respects for genuine vindicated servants of the living god and there my friends god forced him by fire underneath his seat to stand up and pay respects to the servant of the living god god knows how to humble the proud god knows how to lift up the lowly god knows how to lift you up and god knows how to humble the proud but you know when a man a woman a believer is zealous for the lord they get victories but then satan begins to uh rail up against them satan becomes angry against that true believer for stirring up his nest for shaking out the true believers from unbelief and away from him and so these enemies of the truth hired assassins to come against martin and to find him and to assassinate him they caught martin they surrounded him and when they wanted to assassinate him history says he was not scared he did not run you know he turned and raised his neck here is my throat if you're to assassinate me go ahead and do the job that they sent you to do and they leapt to cut his neck with the sword and as they leap forward the power of god struck all of them and threw them backwards against the walls of the room and they fell upon the ground in fear and begin to call out to the martin's god and ask brother martin there for mercy and there martin was able to lead them to jesus christ oh glory to god hallelujah blessed be the name and that god is the same god today that's god is doing the same things today for his glory and for his honor believers now this do you believe the word of god do you receive the word of god may the great holy spirit grow with you may the holy spirit accompany you may the holy spirit my friends vindicate your life your walk your ministry and the truth that you have received and that you are receiving now thank god many have gone before us simple humble people but walking under the influence and inspiration of the blessed holy spirit of the living god amen too often when god begins to use men and anoint them and use their ministry with the healing of the sick casting all the devils the raising of the dead instead of them realizing they're not doing it it's god doing it and if they rise up in pride the holy spirit will take his flight away from them and many times they're raised up in pride they come full of themselves as if they are mighty men but god doesn't want your intelligence your might your power your humanity he wants your surrender he wants you to humble yourself to him that he could lend you his power his presence his wisdom his knowledge his inspiration and that he will be with you all he's asking is for us to be humble simple reverent oh praise his wonderful name and god will use us for his glory and for his honor lifted up with pride but thank god martin remained humble for all his days it is said at one time while in his little office in the back praying preparing for his sermon to come out that a beggar came into the church and asked the deeker deacon for sustenance the head deacon filled with pride for his position that he's a head deacon drove the beggar out and told him to vacate the place there upon the beggar as you know circled around came by the back way and went in and was able to see martin in person martin immediately stood up and took the beggar took off his robe that he had on him and put it around that dear brother and asked the deacon to bring him a regular ordinary robe the beggar went out into the cold street saint martin stood up and stepped into the pulpit to preach the word of god under the holy spirit and to their surprise around martin they saw a glow of light emanating from around his entire body from head to toe light was all around him that he was unconscious of but he was preaching the word surely my brothers truly this was not just only a great man but he was our brother and he was the messenger to this that pergamos church age never never desirous of anything else a pleasing man but always wanted to please the living god and he lived a pure holy and consecrated life and god used him it was said many times he would not preach unless he had a wonderful time and season in the presence of the lord and to know how and what to deliver from the very mouth of the living god and i want to quote the history says often martin would keep the people waiting while he stayed in his vestry office praying for full assurance before he came out to his pulpit a man that was steeped and soaked under the anointing of prayer oh prayer will bring god's blessings down so let us pray pray pray pray only believe all things are possible to them that will believe the word of god oh brother sister pray that the holy spirit will use you pray that the holy spirit will meet the needs of the people pray that god will fill our hearts with love and use us for his glory and for his honor oh praise god hallelujah amen yes my friends just to know he had such a mighty ministry you think that would just give him a wonderful marvelous life but it brought much persecution the saints got persecuted and destroyed by the devil and no doubt the devil will attack some of you tell you all manner of things and maybe even physically attack you amen and there through the instrumentality of the devil many wicked people were used by the devil burning believers at the stakes nailed to logs face down and their stomachs burst open deliberately for the intestines to be exposed and then they would lose a bunch of wild dogs to pull and rake and tear against the intestines of that believer laying upon that log oh they're flesh and bowels bloody and torn by these wicked wild dogs babies were often ripped out of their out of the not only the arms of their mother but they'll cut their stomach and rip the child out in their hatred for this message and this word this true true word of the lord jesus christ oh thank god i am one of them i am one of them hallelujah oh praises marvelous name i am glad that i can say i am one of them i separate and dedicate and consecrate my entire youth and entire life to this hour and will continue to do so for god's glory until the day he calls me home then i'll drop this veil of flesh and rise to seize the everlasting prize and shout while passing through the air farewell farewell hour of prayer yes my friends they would take expectant mothers rip their stomachs open and throw them before the hogs women were made to stand up tied to a post and they will cut off their breasts and leave them to bleed to death while the blood comes pouring out and never crumple in death the tragedy is worse when you come to realize that this was not just the work of the unbelieving heathen but this was the work of some of the so-called church people that were in the church not knowing what true faith is what true the true word is the one god is the true baptism is they know nothing about that and so they come against the saints of god back in that day and they'll come against you in this day oh my god may your fate stand firm in the midst of tribulation and trial as you haul to god's unchanging hand but it was not just unbelievers but a lot of so-called christians who felt they were doing god a favor and they were more righteous in helping god to get rid of these elements by exterminating the true loyal soldiers of the cross marching onto victory they one they were killing out and exterminating the sons of the lord who stood for the word and walked in obedience of the holy spirit listen to the scripture john 16 2 they shall put you out of synagogues yay the time comet that whosoever killeth you will think he do it goddess service matthew 24 9. then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and shall be you shall be hated of all nations today we'll set denominations you'll be hated by all nations and denominations for my name's sake you took on the name of jesus christ and the devil becomes mad he wants you to walk in darkness and to still say eve at an apple and not to realize she committed sexual sin he wants you to believe in the titles of father son holy cross and not to know that those titles have one person behind them with one name and the name is jesus christ and to no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of jesus christ our lord they want to keep you to walk in darkness and to tell you that the holy spirit can't lead you the denominations will lead you but back to the word back to the promises of the bible back to the original faith that paul had amen back to the truth we find here in god's word for the day and for this hour blessed be his holy name amen yes sir i tell you martin was a truly vindicated messenger of the living god but not only was he gifted with an anointed gifted ministry as god will anoint and give to some of you that are listening to me right now for his glory amen hallelujah amen not only was he like that the main thing he was true to god's word he would not swerve sway duck dive bend in any way amen he will stay with god's word history says he fought against organization history says he withstood sin in high places not only among the poor and the lowly but he stood against sin in high places spiritual wickedness in high places he stood against it and he championed the word of truth and he lived it in word and indeed amen and he his life was a life of full christian victory amen hallelujah i'm so glad to have a brother like that i'm glad to have brother martin as a son and saint of the living god victorious over sin victorious over the flesh and over the devil one biographer wrote of him no one ever saw martin angry or disturbed by anything or grieving or laughing too much he was always one in the same seemingly beyond mortal wearing on his countenance a continuance continual sort of celestial joy never was anything on his lips but christ and christ alone never anything in his heart but piety holiness consecration peace and pity for those that were down lowly and needy often he would weep for the sins even of those who would come against him he would pray for those and weep for them and for their salvation who when many times he was quiet and when he was not around many of them as we would say in colloquial talk would talk about him behind his back he had with using their viperous lies and their snake-like attitude and their poisonous tongues would spread rumors and speak all manner of evil against martin behind his back and they hated him they hated him for what his virtues hated him for the miracles and presence of god in his life which they themselves did not possess and they could not imitate his life and his walk with god and sad to say his worst and his bitterest attackers were bishops preachers and a lot of religious church people of that day as it was then so is it now listen to this scripture as i'm about to close matthew 5 10 verses 10 to 12. jesus speaking blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you my brothers and sisters as you bear these solemn sacred words in mind may the great holy spirit place it as blood upon the doorposts of your heart and may you recognize who you are your position in christ who your father is and where we are going i'm on my way to the promised land no one no devil nothing will hinder me no friend family mother father sister brother for my faith is fixed in him and i am certain of god in the words of saint paul for i am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day god bless our precious brother martin next week wednesday will be here again in the pergamos church age with god's greetings to his people out of his precious word and you pray for me as i pray for you that god will send the showers of his blessings down upon us and the holy spirit will be poured out across the world right where you are right where i am wherever you might be may the holy spirit come upon you grant you his supernatural presence and power and his anointing to change your life forever moving from glory unto glory until that day when we all together are able to step into god's glorious presence until then may god richly bless you and anoint you overshadow you and bring us once again together in his name god bless you my friends [Music] you
