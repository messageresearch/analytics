[16:44] word amen okay so we're going to go to
[16:47] our scriptures right now I have like
[16:50] three
[16:53] scriptures okay first one is
[16:56] ecclesiastic 3
[16:59] verse 1 to
[17:02] 11 second Peter
[17:05] 2:17 21 in Revelation 19:7 in
[17:09] Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes there are 31
[17:13] said to
[17:15] everything there is a season and a time
[17:20] to every purpose Under the
[17:22] Sun a time to be born again a time to be
[17:27] born and a time to die
[17:29] a time to plant and a time to
[17:32] plug um up that which is
[17:36] planted A Time to Kill and a time to
[17:39] heal a time to break down and a time to
[17:41] build up a time to reap and a time to
[17:45] laugh a time to mourn and a time to
[17:49] dance a time to Cast Away stones and a
[17:52] time to gather Stones together a time to
[17:55] embrace and a time to refrain from
[17:57] embracing
[17:59] a time to get and a time to lose a time
[18:02] to keep and a time to Cast Away a time
[18:05] to read and a time to s a time to keep
[18:08] silence and a time to speak a time to
[18:11] love and a time to hate a time of war
[18:14] and a time of
[18:18] Peace what prophet had it that WTH in a
[18:22] in that wherein he labored I have seen
[18:25] the travel which God had given to the
[18:27] sons of men to be excised in it and my
[18:32] topic going to be he had made everything
[18:34] beautiful in his own
[18:38] time also he had set the wealth in their
[18:42] heart so that no man can find out the
[18:43] work that God make it from the beginning
[18:45] to end and then the scripture that you
[18:48] used last we second Peter 2:17 to
[18:54] 21 this oh sorry second Peter 1
[19:00] sorry second Peter 1 2 Peter 1
[19:05] 17-21 for he
[19:08] received from God the Father honor and
[19:11] Glory where there came such a voice to
[19:15] him from excellent Glory this is my
[19:17] beloved Son in whom I'm well
[19:20] pleased and this voice which came from
[19:23] heaven we had when we were with him in
[19:26] the holy
[19:26] month we have also
[19:29] a more sure word of Prophecy where unto
[19:32] we do well that he take heat as unto a
[19:35] light that shineth in a dark place until
[19:38] the day Dawn and the day St arise in
[19:42] your
[19:42] hearts knowing this pH that no Prophecy
[19:46] of the scripture is of any private
[19:50] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[19:52] in Old Time by the will of man but holy
[19:55] men of God spake as they were moved by
[19:59] the Holy Ghost amen and Revelation
[20:03] 197 the marriage supper of the Lamb has
[20:06] come let us be glad and rejoice and give
[20:08] honor to him for the marriage lamb
[20:11] marriage of the lamp is come and his
[20:13] wife had made herself ready Heavenly
[20:16] Father may you bless the reading of your
[20:18] word in Jesus name amen please be
[20:22] seated so like the last Sunday we spoke
[20:26] we talk about um we talk about
[20:30] um the bra the bride had a part to play
[20:35] talk about marriage and also the
[20:38] interpretation of the world the reason
[20:40] why we call the prophet
[20:42] and everything how the marriage has come
[20:46] and his wife had made her ready just a
[20:49] little bit recap and the bride has a
[20:52] part to play but the scripture say
[20:54] everywhere that you put your footsteps
[20:56] God has given to you so fo step self
[20:58] mean possession so the the wife had made
[21:01] herself ready and today we're going to
[21:04] add it and talk about God makes all
[21:07] things beautiful in his own time and
[21:13] you're going to we express more on time
[21:18] because as you read in that scripture he
[21:21] said there is a
[21:22] time there's a time for every purpose
[21:26] under the heaven
[21:29] there's a time for everything so if you
[21:33] miss the
[21:35] time you miss everything
[21:38] like imagine somebody is sick to death
[21:43] in your family or your husband your wife
[21:45] or whatever and then instead
[21:50] of um crying and praying for God to heal
[21:53] the person or the person's death and
[21:55] then you are enjoying and having
[21:58] somebody going to say he here because
[22:00] that's not time for that and when
[22:02] there's a time for happiness if you
[22:04] begin to mourn you're going to be out of
[22:07] work so is also the God's word you have
[22:10] to know what time you are living in and
[22:13] B talk about syon that the musicians who
[22:16] know the music very
[22:19] well the composer when they playing the
[22:21] drums and everything they know Junctions
[22:24] of time where they have to make changes
[22:28] so if if there's a junction of time to
[22:30] make change and that composer does not
[22:32] make the change the music will go out of
[22:35] work so you have to know which time to
[22:39] change which Junction to make that
[22:43] changes and I'm going to just read this
[22:46] to kind of cap up what I'm trying to say
[22:49] here and then um I will um express it
[22:53] more okay so we have to know which
[22:57] Johnson
[22:58] that they has to make the change so if
[23:01] they don't know what Junction to make
[23:03] the change everything will go on chaos
[23:05] even though the average person who
[23:08] doesn't know
[23:09] music might not understand but the
[23:12] composers and those how there they
[23:14] really understand that this person is
[23:16] not moving with the Beat of the Music so
[23:20] is the word of God in Shalom he said
[23:23] that now they had a sheet in their
[23:26] hand but what do they do they were
[23:29] trying to paragraph 199 they trying to
[23:32] they trying to look back to a bit that
[23:35] had in Shalom um paragraph 199 to
[23:42] 200 they were trying to look back to a
[23:45] bit that had all portion had already
[23:48] been played
[23:50] out that's what the churches do today
[23:53] they look back see what part Luther
[23:57] played they Lutheran
[24:00] D they don't know the change of
[24:05] Music they don't know what God is doing
[24:09] today when he does these things the Lans
[24:14] the Pentecost say oh we got
[24:19] it you got a sheet that played out 50
[24:22] years
[24:23] ago see certainly let's just keep his
[24:27] word in our hands and watch when the
[24:32] changes come then you know what we are
[24:37] doing now begin with him at the cross
[24:40] repent and be baptized in the name of
[24:42] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[24:44] and you shall receive the music the
[24:46] direction see his word the holy ghost
[24:48] that manifest the word then follow
[24:50] through with the rhythm of the word
[24:52] wherever the music beats for that hour
[24:56] beat with it so what other is trying to
[24:59] say that there's a
[25:00] change as he said somewhere that it's
[25:04] easy when you building a wall everybody
[25:06] can build but when it comes to making a
[25:10] corner not everybody can make that
[25:12] corner it take a a full brick H the the
[25:17] one who knows what he's doing to make
[25:20] that corner so there's a change and
[25:24] people don't want a
[25:25] change and every time there's a change
[25:28] change some people as our Pastor said
[25:32] before they have their mind made up they
[25:36] want to stay where they are it doesn't
[25:38] matter what you tell them their mind is
[25:40] made up they won't even look into it to
[25:42] see if it's truth or not and they stay
[25:45] put because they don't want a change and
[25:48] if you don't recognize the change you be
[25:52] living here in the 21st century when you
[25:56] have computers and everything is they're
[25:58] going to believeing stone age in your
[26:00] time and it's not going to
[26:03] work so the message that was fall in the
[26:06] time of Luther was good but it's not
[26:09] going to work when Wesley came on the
[26:12] scene and it was good when Wesley was on
[26:14] the scene but it wasn't going to work in
[26:17] the time of
[26:18] Pentecost because that time was what the
[26:21] restoration of the gift and the word for
[26:24] Pentecost was good but we moving to
[26:27] another age
[26:29] God sent us a Vindicated Prophet to fill
[26:32] Malachi 4:5 Revelation 10:7 OS 3:7 all
[26:36] those scriptures has been fulfilled to
[26:38] the thought and in h spoken words the
[26:41] original word the prophet said that
[26:43] Malachi 456 is been fulfilled has been
[26:48] fulfilled that mean we are the
[26:50] manifestation of that scripture that
[26:52] fulfilled so we are not going to fulfill
[26:54] that portion again he has fulfilled it
[26:57] he has has come and done his part God
[27:00] has used him mightly never happen on the
[27:02] face of this Earth he a prophet can see
[27:06] where you came from and what happened to
[27:08] you and all those gifts in the highest
[27:10] point in the third pool that came spoke
[27:13] Square spoke all those into existence he
[27:16] was like a wave sheath and God used him
[27:19] mightly but if you
[27:22] check every time the prophet of God
[27:25] start talking about the um scripture or
[27:29] something he talk about what God has
[27:32] done in the time in the life of Abraham
[27:35] bring it to Moses bring it to the Lord
[27:37] Jesus Christ bring it to Baby Peter
[27:41] Silver and Gold Have you not but what we
[27:43] give to in the name of Jesus rise up and
[27:45] then they said that they record the
[27:48] people has been with go with Jesus
[27:50] because they are ignorant and un learn
[27:52] it he give you all those things but he
[27:54] bring it back to himself what God is
[27:57] doing in his
[27:58] Ministry and if God has took that
[28:02] prophet of the sin then that same God
[28:06] who was in that Prophet is in you and in
[28:08] me today so you also have a part to play
[28:12] you also have to be able to identify
[28:14] what God is doing in your life now what
[28:18] God has done to you what God is doing in
[28:21] the bright time we not discounting what
[28:24] God did through the prophet that is good
[28:26] and it's still good we feeling on on
[28:28] that word I listen 24 hours I listen
[28:31] every day but what is that God doing for
[28:34] me I'm looking for the god of Elijah
[28:38] where is that God that use a prophet to
[28:41] raise the dead to let the lame walk let
[28:43] the blind see that's the God I'm
[28:46] worshiping in his present
[28:48] tense there's been a junction of time
[28:52] and remember he said I must decrease and
[28:54] he must be rise Christ must rise up type
[28:57] John the B and he tped himself as John
[28:59] the Baptist that he might decrease and
[29:02] Christ might be what exalted increase so
[29:05] all that the prophet did was introduced
[29:07] her to the Messiah to Christ so you can
[29:09] have a personal relationship with Christ
[29:12] like eler find their Bride for Isaac he
[29:16] was a his laser the voice of what came
[29:20] for us to hear that voice thank you Lord
[29:23] to have to have the communion of Christ
[29:26] to be part of him he amen so that word
[29:29] that's I used the other time said then
[29:31] you become not artificial name but by a
[29:34] reality of the Holy Spirit of Life
[29:36] connecting us into Christ then through
[29:39] the power of his resurrection we are
[29:41] raised from dead things of the world and
[29:44] setting with him in Heavenly places in
[29:47] Christ Jesus so right now we are setting
[29:49] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen
[29:53] the same God that was in the prophet in
[29:56] you and me that's what I'm always trying
[29:58] to um knock it home that God didn't do H
[30:03] left finish only with the prophet the
[30:05] same God on that was in Willam bar
[30:08] Abraham that same God is in you and me
[30:10] today he's alive forever more he's a
[30:13] real God he's not a dead God he lives in
[30:16] you he lives in me amen he didn't finish
[30:19] with him he that used Moses you that use
[30:22] Elijah use Paul come on and all those
[30:25] things that God is here amen and God and
[30:29] Paul met him in a revelated in a in a
[30:33] revelated form when Paul was not there
[30:36] with him in flesh but on the way to H
[30:41] Damascus when he met that light that
[30:44] light was in the resurrected form that
[30:46] was revelated form that he met him and
[30:49] God used him mightily more than even
[30:52] those who who left who slept with him
[30:54] because without Revelation it's
[30:56] impossible to please God and God expect
[30:59] us to have the exact same Revelation the
[31:02] form of the word so that we can be a
[31:04] pleasing to him it's good to follow the
[31:08] word don't get me wrong we have we
[31:11] follow the word but we have to follow it
[31:13] by Revelation the prophet said that even
[31:15] if I tell you don't wear pants and
[31:18] something does not anchor in your heart
[31:20] that don't wear it don't go don't go and
[31:23] wear it because you don't know what you
[31:25] are doing something has to reveal your
[31:28] heart you have to have an understanding
[31:30] why you are doing it and that same God
[31:34] that spoke to them if it's in you he's
[31:37] going to make it clear to you he's going
[31:39] to give you understanding why you are
[31:41] doing this why you are doing that
[31:43] because he the same yesterday today and
[31:46] forever remember the apostles they never
[31:48] met one another those that wrote the
[31:51] Bible before the Bible was written when
[31:54] they began to write it they never met
[31:56] one another but they were say exact same
[31:59] thing because the same composer he the
[32:02] same God who was in them so it doesn't
[32:05] matter what year he came what year he
[32:07] met Isaiah what year he met was they
[32:09] were going to say the same thing they
[32:13] they can't say something different
[32:15] because the composer is one where can
[32:17] there be a confusion no it's a
[32:21] continuation what Luther said was right
[32:24] the J shall live by faith what said was
[32:28] right you have to live the Sanctified
[32:30] life the restoration of the gift was all
[32:33] good but God said a prophet Amen to
[32:35] reveal the hearts of Secret of men oh to
[32:38] reveal the serving SS Amen to let all
[32:42] those things become clear to us amen and
[32:44] then the bride has made herself ready
[32:48] hallelujah praise our God our God is
[32:51] awesome God he's the same yesterday
[32:54] today and forever the bride had made her
[32:57] s ready Hallelujah the wife has made
[33:01] herself ready is a marriage St of we
[33:05] going to the marriage supper of the Lamb
[33:07] that the marriage takes place here amen
[33:10] it doesn't take place over there over
[33:13] there there the marriage supper of the
[33:14] land that's where that the Rapture takes
[33:16] the Rapture is a process leading to what
[33:19] an event so once you C to your
[33:21] Revelation you are in it already until
[33:23] the final pH happen amen you are in it
[33:28] already the same God is said the the
[33:31] wife had made herself
[33:33] ready God is good he's the same
[33:36] yesterday today and forever he promised
[33:40] he will never leave us nor forsake us
[33:43] amen so we are on what we are the same
[33:49] God is in you and in me tonight that's
[33:54] why I'm always want to drum home that
[33:57] God didn't left one time I went to Ghana
[34:00] and I was talking so strong about that
[34:03] about the reality of God how I'm not
[34:06] serving a dead God you can't give me a
[34:09] painted picture I want the the full
[34:11] thing in my life let the Holy Ghost burn
[34:13] in Me God in my heart that rais the dead
[34:16] that God that do this God that do that
[34:19] and the devil thre a
[34:20] challenge while talking in that
[34:24] real all that I saw the church everybody
[34:26] was going out
[34:28] and the pastor told them to come if it's
[34:30] like here we are established the deacons
[34:33] will take a pray for the
[34:36] person and the service goes on but this
[34:41] boy had something for convulsion in
[34:44] Africa kills a lot of people
[34:47] rough so they bring him to the
[34:51] pulpit and the kid lost like five six
[34:54] years and like like he's like that he
[34:59] can't take drink water nothing even seen
[35:03] that in my life and then we prayed for
[35:07] him and the pastor there was no reaction
[35:10] and the whole church was looking at me I
[35:13] didn't understand that but I understood
[35:15] when I got here and then I wasn't scared
[35:19] something came on me strong I began to
[35:22] lift up the name of Jesus Christ I began
[35:25] to let them know that I'm not a Healer
[35:27] the only that the only person that heals
[35:29] is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he's
[35:32] the same yesterday today and forever
[35:34] he's a miracle working God what God has
[35:36] done in the past you do it but he not
[35:38] come the way you want but in his own
[35:40] time he will come he come and do things
[35:42] so I lift up Jesus Christ name God's
[35:44] name was lifted up by the way you lift
[35:46] Christ name up by the time you finish
[35:49] the boy who could not do nothing began
[35:51] to drink began to eat began to PR people
[35:54] came for me to pray for them why we lift
[35:56] up Jesus Christ
[35:58] said that sometimes God if you pray you
[36:02] lay your hands on the people and they
[36:04] get healed sometimes they look up to you
[36:06] but if through the preaching of the word
[36:09] and they get healed the the the the
[36:12] glory goes more to God now understood
[36:14] that so I'm not saying that God doesn't
[36:16] use us to lay our hands on the sick to
[36:18] get healed or no he uses when he is a
[36:21] sovereign God yes he is so he does
[36:23] whatever he wants in that time he want
[36:26] his name to be lifted up and when Christ
[36:29] name was lifted up that kid rose up and
[36:32] get health and move on with his life so
[36:34] he's on time God he may not come when
[36:37] you want him to be but he come right on
[36:40] time he makes all things beautiful in
[36:43] his own time so tonight I encourage you
[36:46] that our God is an awesome God he make
[36:49] all things beautiful in his own time so
[36:52] don't worry about anything all things
[36:55] work together for good to them that love
[36:58] God Amen and he'll do it in his own time
[37:01] hallelujah our god is good tonight let's
[37:04] give him thanks let's give him an
[37:06] Applause amen it's on time God
[37:10] hallelujah amen praise
[37:14] God and God keeps his
[37:17] word he honors every word he said Dy
[37:22] there's never a time that God will say
[37:24] something that he won't keep it you li
[37:27] said let every man's word be a lie yes
[37:29] sir but mine be the truth amen so God
[37:33] keep his word he keeps appointment he
[37:35] said let there be
[37:36] light and light came so the the the
[37:40] light is the
[37:42] interpretation of the word that he
[37:44] spoke he said a virgin shall conceived
[37:48] it took 800 years in his own beautiful
[37:52] time I I believe that when Isaiah said
[37:55] that there were a lot of critics in his
[37:58] time they said how can a virgin conceive
[38:02] we never heard about this maybe this man
[38:04] is
[38:05] cook is here but he said thus said the
[38:11] Lord and He took 200 800 years but the
[38:15] Virgin still conceived that word came to
[38:19] pass in his own time it came he made it
[38:23] beautiful and when that virgin came
[38:27] the scripture has stated very clearly
[38:31] how he was going to be born the place he
[38:34] be born everything but those people
[38:36] because they were always looking back
[38:39] Moses said this they have their own
[38:42] expectation they put their own private
[38:45] interpretation to the word and make it
[38:48] contrary to what this scripture has
[38:50] spoken and they mix a million times and
[38:54] they crucified him why because they were
[38:57] were blinded to it but there was Anna an
[39:01] old woman that prayed there was Simon
[39:05] they never miss it because Simon was
[39:08] looking for him to be born he said my I
[39:11] has seen the salvation of my Lord let
[39:14] your servant go and depart in peace
[39:16] because he was looking for that and when
[39:18] he came he never missed it so it depends
[39:22] on what you are looking for you get what
[39:26] you expect and if what you expecting is
[39:29] in this Bible and it's a revelated form
[39:33] then it will come to pass as our Pastor
[39:36] said they met him the revelated form not
[39:39] The Written Letter The Written Letter is
[39:41] good don't get me wrong we need that
[39:44] letter but the said the letter kill it
[39:47] but the spirit giveth life in one place
[39:50] someone was asking Braham he said oh
[39:53] Braham how I wish I could have visions
[39:57] like you I'll do everything to see
[40:00] visions and to do this he said no you
[40:03] see Visions every day when you read your
[40:06] Bible ask God to open your eyes of
[40:09] understanding and he going to make it so
[40:11] clear to you you see it every day you
[40:14] don't have to see the way he saw it but
[40:16] if you pray in your heart that open my
[40:18] eyes of understanding he going to make
[40:21] to you it is given to know the mysteries
[40:24] of the
[40:25] Kingdom he open your eyes or to know the
[40:29] mystery of the Kingdom he gave to
[40:32] you amen like the hazy and Elijah he
[40:36] said that oh there are chariots all
[40:39] around there are armies and Camp around
[40:42] us and he was so scared he said that oh
[40:45] we are more than them he said how can
[40:47] this be all that I can see is the
[40:49] Chariots
[40:51] of soldiers and Army and only me and you
[40:54] how you going to survive this he said oh
[40:57] Lord God Open the Eyes of the young man
[40:59] or the young man when his eyes was open
[41:02] he realized that there were more than
[41:04] them that's the god that we are serving
[41:07] hallelujah amen your eyes might be
[41:08] closed but it's Open Eyes of My Heart
[41:11] when he opens your eyes you see more you
[41:14] see what he's doing it makes the enemy
[41:16] becomes like nothing to you you can
[41:20] give because your eyes has been open to
[41:24] know that God greater is he that is in
[41:26] you than he that's in the world amen so
[41:28] you are not scared of the enemy again
[41:31] because you know who is inside of few
[41:34] you know who is behind you know who his
[41:36] back up of you he's the Lord and Savior
[41:38] Jesus Christ and the devil cannot even
[41:41] do anything unless he ask permission
[41:44] from God and if he cannot do anything
[41:46] unless he give you per unless he get
[41:48] permission from God what are you scared
[41:51] why are you making this look so big you
[41:54] make him look so gag oh man he become so
[41:57] small when he said when he said boo he
[42:01] said also Boo Boo Boo and he became
[42:03] little amen that enemy will become
[42:05] nothing if you recognize who you
[42:08] are that you are a son or daughter of
[42:11] God and the god the OM poent God that
[42:15] created heaven and earth he dwells in
[42:18] you he lives in you nothing comes your
[42:21] life unless he permitted it and
[42:24] everything that comes to your life is
[42:25] for a purpose some of them is to try
[42:29] you sometimes is to um give you
[42:33] encouragement it's all for his glory and
[42:35] honor but you have to recognize the
[42:38] junction of time and what God is dealing
[42:41] with you if you miss that music beat you
[42:44] miss
[42:46] everything you miss his voice you are in
[42:50] trouble because always speak in a little
[42:53] small
[42:54] voice if you become concentrate be
[42:58] conscious you see him you know what the
[43:00] reason
[43:02] why some of us are not having that
[43:07] spiritual blessing I'm not saying that
[43:10] you're not a son or daughter of God you
[43:12] are a son of God you are a daughter of
[43:15] God and David said I restore unto me the
[43:17] joy of thy salvation the reason why some
[43:20] of us are not having those spiritual
[43:22] blessings is because sometime you spend
[43:25] too much time on television
[43:27] I'm not saying don't watch television
[43:29] it's good but you have to balance it we
[43:32] spend too much time reading our
[43:34] newspapers reading magazines reading a
[43:37] lot of things and even in this age we
[43:40] spend too much time on the Tik Tok on
[43:42] the Facebook on Instagram on this if you
[43:45] don't take time those things take away
[43:48] all your time so you don't have any
[43:51] quality time for the Lord how you going
[43:53] to get your spiritual blessings because
[43:55] you spend all your time and the devil
[43:59] knows how to make it appealing once you
[44:02] go to your Google page he knows what you
[44:04] want he bring this news he bring this he
[44:06] bring that he bring that he bring that
[44:08] and then you count yourself reading this
[44:10] reading that reading that reading that
[44:11] read that by the time you realize two 3
[44:13] hours 4 hours is
[44:15] gone no wonder you not having that
[44:17] spiritual blessing but greater is he
[44:19] that is in you than he that's the world
[44:22] those good those things are good don't
[44:25] get me wrong I I always say that don't
[44:28] let them use you you use it use it when
[44:32] you need to use it use it wisely it's
[44:36] like manone everything you have you have
[44:38] the power to use it it's a tool do don't
[44:42] let that tool use you you use that tool
[44:46] amen for what you want you have to be
[44:49] conscious of yourself and you have to
[44:52] know like I'm weak I know this will take
[44:54] me this time that time that time so I
[44:57] have to set a boundary give myself time
[45:00] and check or even put alarm on me on it
[45:03] I real I'm going too much I can't cut it
[45:06] off because it will deprive you of your
[45:11] spiritual blessing I'm not saying you
[45:13] know God is an H what it doesn't matter
[45:17] it's good for us to read it's good for
[45:19] us to pray but he's a sovereign
[45:22] God one way from him changes everything
[45:26] so I'm not making a law out of
[45:29] this you you get what I'm trying to say
[45:31] he's a sovereign God and he a balance
[45:35] that's why I'm trying he does whatever
[45:36] he wants so I'm not saying that you
[45:38] spend time on not going to no he's God
[45:41] it's not according to your righteous by
[45:43] his grace and his grace alone but the
[45:45] grace have to be a boundary we have we
[45:47] have a boundary within that the a
[45:50] boundary that the church the child of
[45:52] God can swim once you are within that
[45:55] boundary of God's word you are f you can
[45:57] swim all around but don't go outside the
[46:01] boundary but the grace of God is there
[46:04] for us is grace and grace I'm not making
[46:07] this a law so don't take your mind today
[46:11] that this right don't do no I don't
[46:12] believe in that but let God lead you and
[46:15] guide you so that those things don't
[46:17] take up all your precious time that's
[46:19] why I'm trying to what convey over here
[46:21] amen hallelujah so God keeps his
[46:24] word he promised Abraham
[46:28] that um you going to have a child you're
[46:33] going to have a
[46:34] son it took 25 years a still came to
[46:38] pass so he keeps his word he keeps his
[46:41] appointment he keeps his time amen yes
[46:45] sir sometimes he's testing our faith
[46:48] like the Hebrew
[46:50] boys he told them he allowed
[46:53] them to be put in Into the Fire to the
[46:58] fiery furnace wow but they have faith in
[47:03] God so much I believe that's what the
[47:05] bride of Christ has that our God the
[47:10] first time I read that became a
[47:11] Christian It Strike my soul so much our

[47:43] going to exalt his name amen no wonder
[47:46] Paul said that I rather was glory in my
[47:50] infirmities but it became so clear to
[47:52] you that your grace is sufficient for me
[47:54] the prophet has to have um um stomach
[47:57] problem every seven years but he didn't
[48:00] care about

[55:16] circumstance and be so scared to move
[55:19] forward let that word of God R in your
[55:21] heart and move forward and ride on the
[55:23] word of God as that as that as the man
[55:27] has the vision said I'm riding on it
[55:29] because he was trying to push it by
[55:30] himself the tree he did everything the
[55:33] POR talk about the greatest batt he did
[55:37] everything he couldn't move it and they
[55:38] heard a voice say Paul why don't you do
[55:42] it and write it on it and there oh I'm
[55:45] writing on it I'm writing on it so I'm
[55:47] saying that give your problems to God
[55:50] and let God write on it let the word of
[55:52] God ride on your problem Amen Let God
[55:55] ride on the problem
[55:56] let him WR on the solution amen Oh Our
[55:59] God is good he's on time God oh huj how
[56:04] great is our word God Amen praise God oh
[56:09] thank you Jesus amen he's the same
[56:13] yesterday today and
[56:16] forever yes and in every
[56:19] marriage when they do the ceremony after
[56:22] the ceremony doing the ceremony the
[56:25] woman is the name of the
[56:27] husband like when I married my wife she
[56:31] was Dana after the marriage became B
[56:35] because she takes the name of the
[56:37] husband but in this in this modern
[56:42] times um the women most of them the
[56:45] worldly people they keep
[56:48] their maternal their paternal names they
[56:51] don't take the name of the husband and
[56:54] anyone who does that it means that that
[56:56] he's not going to be subject to that
[56:59] man but we are married to
[57:03] Christ so we take the name of the Lord
[57:05] Jesus Christ and if we take that name
[57:09] then we are subject to him you obey him
[57:12] in the token total obedience the whole
[57:15] word of God entitles you to the Token so
[57:19] in that marriage ceremony the woman put
[57:23] uh the veil on the shoulder of the man
[57:25] that means that that man is his is her
[57:28] the responsibility of the woman is on
[57:30] the on that man he has taken full
[57:33] responsibility of the lady and that God
[57:36] has taken full responsibility of us not
[57:39] only have we accepted him as our savior
[57:43] but we accept him also as our lordship
[57:46] lordship means that
[57:47] ownership it means that God own us we
[57:51] are slave to the word of God one one
[57:54] said I'm slave to Jesus Christ whose
[57:56] slave are you amen so we are he owns us
[58:00] we have committed everything into his
[58:02] head to take full ownership of Our Lives
[58:06] amen so when that Mar takes place
[58:09] listen I used to be
[58:13] Phillip and before Christ came to my
[58:17] life that life of drinking smoking and
[58:20] everything when God came all those
[58:23] things
[58:24] died so I know going back to that life
[58:28] I'm a new creature in Christ am all
[58:32] things have passed away it's a past
[58:35] things when you take that man's name all
[58:40] your Bast old friends and girlfriends
[58:43] what you have no part in them it's like
[58:45] looking for a wife when you find a right
[58:48] wife you cut your eyes closed you don't
[58:50] see any woman again only your wife that
[58:52] you see you not hunting for woman again
[58:54] so it's a bride of Christ we have come
[58:57] to know this is the truth 100% yes sir
[59:01] so our eyes are closed only on Christ
[59:04] not on Mr Baptist not on our past life
[59:08] he has thrown that into his sea of his
[59:10] forgetfulness doesn't even remember them
[59:13] anymore yes sir is the only devil who go
[59:16] back and dig it back to you so when the
[59:19] devil tried to dig you and bring your
[59:21] past tell him his future his future is
[59:23] the lake of Hell our future is clear
[59:27] tell him my future is clear because he
[59:30] that host tomorrow host my future and if
[59:33] the Lord host my future then my future
[59:35] is clear all those things were passed
[59:38] it's not me I'm not that same person
[59:41] anymore when Christ came into my life
[59:44] there was a change that took place and
[59:48] that change is working in my life every
[59:50] day inside and projected outside so I'm
[59:54] not going back to that whole life
[59:57] Goodbye World more than 25 years or 30
[1:00:00] years I have nothing part with you no
[1:00:03] sir so what I'm trying to say that your
[1:00:06] sins my sin were put into God's sea of
[1:00:11] forgetfulness you are
[1:00:14] Justified Justified means that you have
[1:00:16] never even done it Billy amen you didn't
[1:00:19] even do it in the first place because
[1:00:21] before time we were in
[1:00:24] Christ amen etern you a son or daughter
[1:00:27] of God and that tribute that you were
[1:00:29] there was a sinless
[1:00:31] bride because sin came
[1:00:35] in that's why you have time and age the
[1:00:39] Bible never talk about the age of Adam
[1:00:42] until Seth was born he said Seth was 134
[1:00:46] years when Adam was born that means that
[1:00:49] Adam and Eve could have millions and
[1:00:51] billions of age there was not such a as
[1:00:54] a Time we tra into time because of sin
[1:01:00] disbelief that our mother Eve did but
[1:01:03] God is going to reverse his back so that
[1:01:06] tribute that part of God that Chinese
[1:01:09] peace come on that one has no sin is
[1:01:12] sinless is this
[1:01:15] flesh the same devil will come and bring
[1:01:17] sickness on you until the day of the day
[1:01:20] of Miracle pass that's his business as
[1:01:24] brother um I think brother um what's his
[1:01:27] name brother Jor Smith said he is
[1:01:30] accuser he's going to come and blame you
[1:01:32] whatever and then when you go back to
[1:01:34] prison the please also go back and put a
[1:01:36] charge on you that's his business but
[1:01:39] you have to tell him that no no I didn't
[1:01:41] do it in the first place come on I
[1:01:43] Didn't Do It in the first place amen I'm
[1:01:46] Justified I'm Washed by the blood of the
[1:01:49] lamp oh the devil has no pass in me amen
[1:01:53] I'm Justified somewhere he said that is
[1:01:56] the man whom I will not impute sin and
[1:01:58] whose iniquity is also what
[1:02:01] forgiving and the word said that if you
[1:02:04] said God has forgiven you and you
[1:02:06] purposely intentionally go and try to do
[1:02:09] it then you didn't do it something is
[1:02:11] wrong the first place but if you have
[1:02:14] that seal of God in you you don't have
[1:02:17] the desire to do those things so when
[1:02:20] you do it God forgives you in advance
[1:02:23] God he knows you're going to repent down
[1:02:24] the road and in your heart you don't
[1:02:27] want to do those things but because you
[1:02:28] are trapped in this you end up doing it
[1:02:32] but it's not your intention it's not
[1:02:34] your desire because God knows our
[1:02:37] desires he knows that we love him he
[1:02:39] knows that our desires is to worship him
[1:02:42] I desire to give him praise I desire to
[1:02:44] do his work but because we are trapped
[1:02:47] here constantly is a battle he
[1:02:50] understand it but let's press on let's
[1:02:54] give him thanks let him give you praise
