succession meetings that are ongoing another spray uh of course pray for myself as I stand here now to bring the word of God to you uh we believe that our God that we serve moves in a wonderful Supernatural way uh we may have thoughts we may prepare but it's all still in the hands of God right because he can stop you he can Sidetrack you you can place you wherever he wants to place you so that's what we are here for are you here for that praise the Lord so let's let's talk with him have a conference with him and let us just fellowship and worship with him in his presence here today for the glory of God Genesis chapter 1. I may refer to this I have some uh a couple of pages of the seven of the church age book I have the seventh seal a book up here of course you're younger you don't need those things it's all there you know but um I still need I still need it uh so I thank the Lord for for his word and for his Divine uh presence praise the Lord you know all the things that are old-fashioned when they seem to be out of style that's when people want to go pay outrageous prices to get them back but uh may God help us that we understand what he's doing in this Albert Genesis one um they are going to soon put it up if it's not back up there they'll soon put that up one three to eleven praise the Lord and this will be telling you about God and in his creation let us pray while they're finding that a gracious heavenly father as we are about to read out of the holy book the written word May the Living Word come on the scene and may he write up onto our understanding upon the words that are written and spoken that you may be glorified you the unwritten presence of the word and in the word be glorified in our hearts as they were singing together so sweetly Lord in our hearts Lord be glorified be thou glorified today through Thy word father because you are the one that makes things real you are the one that cause things to live again and so we place our beings completely into your keeping that you might lead and direct us and be glorified in us but we ask it in the name of our beloved Lord Jesus amen and amen praise the name of the Lord Genesis 1. we will read the verse 3 with the understanding and God said let there be light and there was light and then we'll go to verse 11. and God said let the Earth bring forth sorry let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so of course you can go on reading verse 12 and right on down to 13. several places amen may the Lord bless you we'll Now read Galatians 3 16. Galatians 3 and 16. now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he said not unto the seeds as of many but as of one and to the seed which is Christ amen thank you Lord amen we commit all things into his hands God bless you please be seated amen all born again he has made a change in me I what about you as he's made a change in your heart as he made a change in your life so that you know are indeed that when you're reading out to this word uh it's not real the figments of religious imaginations that were put in there because there's so much misinformation that's being put out trying to mold and my the minds and hearts of the population to cause them to buy their their products which brother Branham already said their economy is based on the seat and lies even in selling a product they will tell lies to get you to buy that product he gave his own example where they tell you if you buy this certain soap and just drop a bit of it in the water and just shake your clothes in there just a little bit and take it out if white as snow is clean and like that he said I did it over and over and it did take out but it wasn't clean right so it's lies a half-life half truth just try to hold this medicine will take away your problem you will be completely a pain-free and trouble like that and then they lower their voice and said and while you're taking it you may also have a burst plane you may also have this ache your blood pressure may go up you may suffer from blindness you see so so it will heal or help the one thing over here but then it costs about 10 or 20 other problems then you're going to run for a medicine for the other problem over there and then that causes another 10 more uh problems and you and they keep you like that woman going in circles trying to find an answer to the problem until you spend all that you have and your blood dry so the doctors are doing the best they can the good and honest ones other than that they're just practicing on you and they have their practices and they invite you to come for them to practice on you and you have to be aware of that that doctors don't heal they only treat and they leave that the rest of it is God has to do it not that we don't need them but you need to be aware of of all that for the glory of God praise God God is wonderful listening praise the name of the Lord we give him all the glory now we want to look to uh we want to look to the word and end the word as we were talking about Genesis 1 as we are reading from it and what we can see there are what we should see is that God is now into his creative Acts before Genesis 1 this great Eternal being by himself alone was there and being there alone and having these thoughts in his mind and things he wanted to do and to accomplish then this great being got to the stage where he's about now to do or his creative acts to move from thinking to doing and now we read from the word how that and God said and again Genesis 11 12 he said and God said and between those verses you will see over and over again it repeats and God said that's why Hebrews 11 nothing that was made was not made without the word and without him was nothing man because God had to say it before it could come to be amen praise the Lord so we understand God said and when he said that was the word is that right now you understand when I say the word that's the the logo switches already the Eternal Word who God is that was there before all things were in eternity now uh now God said and it become what the spoke broken word the spoken word now remember before that there was no word there was no word nobody had any word now we hear talk about the word and the word and the word see but uh we understand that God is the one who really was sowing his word if you will go to Matthew chapter 13 verses 24 to 30. Jesus tells this is not the parable of the sower who just sowed the seeds that is his part of it or just after he spoke that then he spoke this saying a certain man went out and he saw good seed he sought good seed in the land and when that man had finished sowing good seed in the land then the enemy came his enemy came and also now sowed seeds tears Tears In the Land everywhere and they be all began to come up right and as they began to come up and he came back to look he saw some were his Original Seed that he had planted and the others were nothing but tears amen so then he said now who has done this and that enemy has done this uh you know when the question was asked of him well who has done this you planted the field he answered an enemy has done this and even today we know an enemy has done this because they and my topic is the Original Seed because the Original Seed is the seed that God sowed because in type he was really speaking of himself you see when God types use Abraham he was really letting us who has thoughts and imaginations and reason to be able to have an object we can look at and to understand what he did what happened to him and what he was going to do with his promise his promises to the church he wanted us to know that by an up a physical human object lesson in time that we can understand clearly what he was fixing to do right now as humans we will have to take a pen and draw pictures on a board but God did that with literal human beings prophets Patriarchs and flesh them out there that there could be for signs and so on that we might be able to see graphically and understand if we can understand what it is that he had pictured in his mind now become a reality in a human being acting out what was his thoughts on the inside so we know God sought the original seeds because there was no seed before he sowed so what they what his enemy sword were seeds of discrepancy seeds that can create confusion now remember there was only one God and there is only one true God so God has no competition there was no body there because he stood alone no one else on that same level there's no one like him no one even close to him he the greater him the only one none other like him and therefore we understood that he saw the Original Seed and because he saw his Original Seed all the other seeds were put out by the his enemy which we understand is the devil Lucifer that one who was cast down upon the earth and the cry went out War unto the inhabitants of the Earth for your adversary the devil has come down and he knew what that his time is short so you watch out because your enemy has now come to Earth so here we are faced with these scenes of discrepancy but the seeds of discrepancy are there to distract and take away the minds and the hearts of the people that they will wreck not recognize that there are genuine original seeds in that field which he said the field is the world and here we are they're our original sins that were planted there or placed there by God and the enemy sword confusing tear seeds around you that people will find it hard to recognize the original seed that was there amen hallelujah now we understand that God's original seed was his word and his word was in his mind which was part of him remember he is the pillar of fire he is the logos he is all of it and we are in him part of it before the foundations of the world and so there we are in God if you want to if you want the pictures imagine that just like uh great atoms within the great Autumn right not Adam but the great atom uh in there and they're all in there whirling around us one with him but that's where they are as the word seed of God God's original word seed that he was fixing to send down or plant upon the Earth that we have here now amen praise the name of the Lord and we find he those thoughts or seed thoughts were in his mind but those those thoughts were there as real as we know real to be but there were unexpressed they were not spoken there were not known to us yet as the word as being part of the world they were only in his thoughts but now he is in the middle of his creative Acts and God said now that word that was in him has now expressed it now has the ability to become whatever he wants it to become if he wants a tree if he wants a moon he wants a star he wants a life whatever he wants it now has the ability to become what he wants it to be from the moment God said it came into expression it came into it now is able to manifest the time frame doesn't matter what it took a hundred years a thousand years a million years God said and it was so doesn't matter how long whether when he said you are to be in this church that church change the other Church age you want to be in whatever churches when he said only then you were expressed and then you were expressed you are now able to manifest what you are for his glory and for his honor praise God until that time you are all the way in him just like all the time I was in my dad amen all the time I was in my mom but when the time came for me to be expressed I Was Made manifest naturally spiritually in the same way we are made manifest by the revealing of the world we have made manifest as true believers who believe the word of the Living God hallelujah amen and now because it's expressed it could be made manifest because God already told it God said let there be light he told them to let like be made manifest I want you to go forth as light I want this to go forth as a seed I want this to go forth in this way and God said and it was so nothing can stop that now God said it was so it is so God said and it is so praise the Lord hallelujah if we find here that God said that these seeds spoken word not natural seeds now because these are received thoughts that were in him and he took those seed thoughts not to go over but you realize what I'm saying and put them in the earth in humans flesh that they could now be expressed and they could express themselves in that uh in that situation or condition that they're in they could now Express themselves amen here upon the Earth because they are to bring forth he said they must bring forth seed after its kind who see this where in itself now the tree doesn't have to know it the sea don't have to know it but the seed it has its own life in itself and that life that is in there is able to reproduce itself praise God and he said it this way in John 1 11 I believe if you will find that John 1 11 and 12 put that up on the board back of us praise God we find out that he said that he came to his own and his own received them not but as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the Sons and Daughters of God they are now becoming what they're supposed to be what they're supposed to manifest what they're supposed to declare and make known to the world and to the people because God already said what they are supposed to be praise God do you believe that you come with you with the built-in power source to become the sons of God to become the doctors and of God to become the children of God hallelujah because that's what God Said in his word amen and I believe it with all my heart amen Galatians 3 16. now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made amen hallelujah now you understand that God actually is showing that he used Abraham there to demonstrate what he was doing spiritually speaking amen Abraham's natural seed praise God and His seed were the promises made now to who were the promises men the promises were made to Abraham and he has seen praise God hallelujah amen now Genesis go back to Genesis 1 he's saying he says now our tree you are supposed to bring forth seed after your kind so the word went up forth to that particular tree or orb or fruit or whatever that that's what is its purpose that's what it's supposed to do is to bring forth there the original life that was there in it it's supposed to manifest that original life that was in it praise God so it's a seed with a promise it's a seed that comes with the promise built into it and to fulfill that promise that's already within itself it's empowered by God to fulfill that promise that's within its own self now now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he said not to seeds as of many but as of one to thy seed which is Christ now he's talking about this promise was made not to just you or me individually but the promise was made to this seed which is Christ Hallelujah and because we were already in him and because we were in him yet we were not mad yet manifest when those promises were made Hallelujah then the promises which were made to him which always the prophet said was also meant to you only that you don't recognize it because you were there one with him before the beginning Before Time begun you are one with him hallelujah amen yes sir praise God and those promises are ours as long as we are in Christ outside of Christ no promises no blessing nothing God promised you nothing but in Christ you are included in every promise of himself the word you are you receive every promise that is in the word if you are in Jesus Christ Hallelujah and because we were in him before the foundation of the world hallelujah praise God we can raise our hands and say praise God thank you Lord Jesus amen oh every morning by morning you mercies I see Hallelujah Glory God Amen so we understand we don't come down here to get borned again to get eternal life Hallelujah I know these things I repeat over and over but it must be solidly uh rooted and grounded within your heart we did not come down here in the Pentecostal belief and fashion to come here to get eternal life we come here already with this seed the life the eternal life of God in us but we were suffering from spiritual amnesia because of the unnatural birth that we had born in sin and shaped in iniquity the promises like a shock and there you are and we we just think we like what the devil intended we thought we were not just another human being another another plant growing in the field not knowing that you were of the Original Seed of God and the life of the seed is already in it of itself and that life is in the seed waiting waiting for the hour and the time when moisture and sunshine will strike it and will come to attention and a life to itself recognizing who it is amen praise the name of the Lord now we see from that we did not our beginnings as not from Eden we did not come from Eden that's our only physical manifestation of our physical body came from Edens Origins and anything started there must die amen but we came from eternity and we are going back to Eternity anything from eternity cannot die because it's part of him and we're going back to Eternity where we come from remember this we do not start or come from Eden we come from eternity we're going back to Eternity we come from in God we're going back to God that's why we are in the word now praise the Lord hallelujah glory be to God Amen praise God we are just we are just one of the original seed we are not confused anymore of Who We Are but we are of the Original Seed as one Prophet said and it shall come to pass he shall see his seed he will see the man manifest Hallelujah he'll recognize them Hallelujah glory to God Amen yes sir so we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world praise the Lord hallelujah we were chosen to receive the promise for the age whichever age you're living in and we have received our promise we have received Malachi 4. we have believed Malachi 4 that this Prophet was sent to awaken us to speak the word and waken up the life that was already sitting in the seed that was waiting to come back to its uh come out of its Amnesia come to itself and recognize who he it is where it come from and where it's going back to amen and we believe that with all our hearts praise the name of the Lord glory be to God hallelujah amen yes sir so we have the promise or we came with this promise in US that we will have we have the birthright let me put it that way like Jacob I don't want to go through all the types Isaac Jacob and so on but they come with that promise in them they have the right to have a new birth they have the right to have an Awakening they have the right for something to strike that and bring it back to life because the life is already waiting within itself praise the Lord and whatever outside excess it had whether it's Pope whether it's skin whatever it's going to throw it all off because it now has to manifest itself the word doesn't matter what kind of life we had what kind of life we live what kind of mistakes we made when the spirit of God strikes the seed within and that seed begins to manifest it breaks and busts and casts off all the carnality all the flesh all the desires of the world it begins to break that thing away from us amen hallelujah amen we may love the drinks we may love the smoke we may love the women we may love the gold we want to bury ourselves in Fame and Fortune that's good that's marvelous in the natural world that's all they have after that they're dead they're gone they're burnt up it's over with but we are here with eternal life we are here with the life of God in us amen we are well you see that's why he said don't you know you live in Two Worlds why because he was he was the son of man right just like you are you are a son of man so you are in flesh but at the same time while you know you're living here as a son of humanity amen you realize there's this other part in you that is really the Sons and Daughters of the Living God so right now you see this in Heavenly places in Christ while you sitting on this pewd on here listening to the word of God here because you are trapped in the uh imprisoned in this body right now until God is ready to take you out of here but blessed be the name of the Lord we recognize our present stage of Duality until we go back to the Oneness with God total Harmony one with the father and man coming from God and going back to God Amen praise God not that you're not that spiritually right now but the fullness of that you're going to walk into praise the Lord so it's I understand that praise the name of the Lord glory to God Amen yes sir we give him praise amen glory to God Amen Hallelujah so therefore we see the manifestation of the one seed leaving its first stage and going into a tree or a herb or fruit tree whatever and then it goes into its many membered body stage where it starts bearing fruit it's the same thing it's the same seed but when you look now there is many many many on the on the tree in the form of fruit and all the fruits don't have the same shape even though it's the same fruit they all shaped different and everything else like that but they are there because now it has moved to the stage where it's now a many membered body Hallelujah and this seed has now become the seeds amen the seeds multiplied in the form of God hallelujah amen so the promises was made to the one Original Seed and by doing that it was made to all the seeds that were in him it was made to him the man as well as to the wife now continue he said not unto seeds as of many but as of one until thy seed which is Christ hallelujah amen to him were the promises made glory to God those promises were made to him praise God as of one amen enter thy seed which is Christ and Galatians 3 29 and if ye be Christ then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs to that promise you are ears of the promise praise the name of the Lord I am an heir of my father hallelujah it's like automatic praise the lord it's just he himself maybe gonna have to exclude you if you're not one of his but other than that we are Heirs of our heavenly father praise God Amen and there is where the devil tries to mix it up right there because he said see all all Abraham's natural seed was the promises made to them amen he says there's a lot of people say they're a Jew but he says that that's not what God is saying or what the Bible is saying not if you call yourself a Christian makes you a Christian because the devil has impersonated Christianity to such a degree that by your Humanity you can't discern or differentiate the seeds the devil has got them to impersonate Christianity with its acts and actions that that by that he can deceive your right sight he can deceive your senses of hearing seeing smelling action everything he can deceive you completely amen but praise God so we have senses but now we come to the point that we don't even put our full trust in these five senses that we have our senses are in this Sixth Sense the fullness of the word when all these other senses seem to fail us and we don't know what else to do that sense kicks in and God's word manifests itself in us and through us that's why he said when you go before Great Men judges and governors and Kings he says him that I will not take what you're going to say because the father that is in you will speak the word hallelujah doesn't mean he's going to quote from the Bible but before you know it you say something uh and that little something that comes out to you just cuts everything they say away uh like that amen you know I've told the story of a brother I know simple brother uneducated brother but full of the love and grace of God uh and uh he had a car and it was running very well and God blessed him financially where he was able to buy another a brand new car but the first car he had wasn't old it was a very good condition used car because it was a marriage he's the only one driving it and he very responsible and another brother uh wanted to get that car or trick him out of it for his son-in-law or something like that and went there uh to him one night and they were speaking in the restaurant parking lot which was dimly lit and uh he asked him for the car and he says no I'm not I'm not going to sell you the car I'm not going to give you the car I'm going to keep it and they got mad and before he annoyed they took a pipe and whacked him in his face and broke his teeth and and put people called the police police came on the scene charges were LED and the case went to court and everything else so the judge gots up there of course and and says and now let me know what this case is about and the lawyers begins to talk and says well and such and such in the night of November so and so this is you know this my client went to get this buy this car from this person and altercation took place and the person claims that they were hit with a metal type which broke all their teeth and now they're they're claiming that that should be taken care of they should be paid and recompensated and so on so on so uh and uh I would like to dispute that your honor because on on that particular night we find out there was no moon and so there was no Moonlight and there were no Garden parking lot there was no electric light so uh I'm saying to the client whom we have sitting now in the chair you know for questioning um now he spun around suddenly and said how can you claim that my client hit you with an iron pipe when it was dark and no one could see in that darkness no way could they see what their were hit with and the brother was stunned he didn't know or what to say in a situation like that because it's true it's dark you can't see and then all of a sudden before you can think of it because he was upset out of his mouth come he says you you have to see it to know when I hit you on your face or your mouth with an iron pipe you're gonna you want you know the difference whether it's iron or rubber even the judge started laughing because it's so simple you don't need to see the thing to know what it is I didn't see it but I felt it and you can feel it now if you want to feel it right see and the case was thrown out just like that just a simple thing out of his mouth and God with the prophet the same thing that took him for the for the tax case and he even thought he lost you know so he said well served that's the case then I have to pay I have to pay this fine he said but you know not myself I can pay the fine but I'm thinking of all them poor people that I gave those things to monies tires this that that they're gonna have to pay on that and I said oh no he says they don't have to pay one cent on it he says yeah he says no because they didn't ask they they received it as a gift they received it as a gift so they don't have to pay on the gift and then the spirit spoke to him on the inside then you don't have to pay because all that you ever received people just send it to you as a gift so he said well then I don't have to pay because everything I received I I received it as a gift unless I in other words less I come out the courtroom and you say maybe I cooked it up here is my mailbox key you can go and check you can go and check my mail and check everything yes and it did and everything that ever came into him is gifts and the case was true now then you know the story they had to recompensate them what he had what he had to get instead of him owing they owed him and they were I had to pay him for everything that he had in Him Praise the Lord aren't you glad it's like that brother we we just walk around with an abundant we walk around Carefree we walk around in Christ not worried about anything worries problems pressures will come but we are assured that there's one in us and with us that is more than evil because he's already overcome all them things that we have ever faced in our lives and we may be going to face but he has over when you overcome them amen and we rest on that amen hallelujah and to him was the promises made to Christ praise God look how the prophet expresses truth he says do you know he doesn't expand he doesn't explore he doesn't he just leaves it he said do you know that original Oak seed or tree that was planted in the garden all the Ever oak trees we have seen here today every one of them regardless of what's trained or this or that they come from one Original Seed and that scene has multiplied itself and now we got oak trees all over the world what that really was telling us Christ to Christ was the promise made but out of that one seed all the other seeds that were elected in him they are the ones that are the beneficiaries and recipients of the promises that were made to him praise the Lord and we're so happy about that not the Abraham's natural seed the promises were made amen but to the spiritual seed because naturally the Elder of Esau and Jacob Isa as the Elder that is why Isaac naturally when we thought maybe the birthright will go to him you see he will go to him because that was law that was the Jewish way an Hebrew way that will pass on to the eldest book God says no that's not my way that's what is written there in the book but that's not what my way is my way is the spiritual work right goes to that elected one that's supposed to have that promise amen and though Jacob looked like a renegade and a liar and a cheat and a worldly and everything else there was something in him that God had placed there that knew it's about the time for him to wake that up and for Jacob to recognize who's who he is amen after 400 years God said I made a promise to to Israel Abraham's seed and the IRS come for that promise to be fulfilled therefore I sent forth my Prophet Moses Amen in this hour he sends forth this Prophet William Marion Branham to fulfill Malachi 4 5 and other promises in the Bible to make us aware of the hour that we are living in and we recognize the hour that we are living in praise God and we give God the glory and the praise and the honor for his word Romans 4 16 we find that God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham and his fat seed not just natural seed but the Seed of Abraham that has the same attributes attitudes of faith of always believing God of always trusting in his word that resting upon Revelation because Hebrews 11 by faith Abraham believed God I repeat to you what I've already said Well because most don't think about that there was no Bible when Abraham believed God somebody tells Abraham believe the word of God does he believe God he believed what was not written word but the unwritten word it was the voice of God that spoke to him and he recognized that was the Eternal God speaking to me here and he believed the word of God and received it God is saying the same thing to you even though we have now written word this is good it was supposed to point you in that direction it was a school Master to lead you to Christ the law was a school Master to lead the Jews to Christ physically but they they saw in love with the school school Master that's when admiration of the teaching ability of that school Master to this day they have stayed with that school Master but the Bible says as Paul taught they should have gone from the school Master into their way of life for what they're supposed to do Manifesto purpose they should have gone on into Christ that they could fulfill the word amen we hope praise God but we have now not moved from the law we still recognize like Paul did and all Jesus did we still recognize the law he still practiced live the law went to the center do all them things they were asking for and better than they were doing it but yet he says it's not the law they said so and so but I say unto you I know what the law says about this woman should be condemned but there is a higher law than that amen there's an 11th commandment you need to pay attention to amen oh praise God daughter go and sin no more amen your given thee the voice today and recognize the hour that we are living in we are not bound and we are not tied up we are not imprisoned by the Lost regulations of men neither are we bound even by this written word we see here because the unwritten word is beyond that amen it's Unwritten praise God hallelujah we are of the original sin I know what I just sounded with some with some like blasphemy but just like it did to the Jews back there something like blasphemy when Jesus said I know what Moses said but this is what the spirit of God is revealing and manifesting in this day and in this hour Hallelujah and we are resting upon the word of God for this day amen hallelujah amen and Paul puts himself on all or the other believers under the designation because he says Abraham I'm quoting brother Branham here who is the father of us all then he goes on to not only narrow down his definition but rather to finalize his his uh his definition Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with Jesus and counted the sea children from Jesus as the children of the promise do you believe you that it's you he's talking about you're looking in the word and saying mama that's me oh daddy that's me I'm seeing myself in the mirror I'm recognizing myself in the word hallelujah oh my yes sir they're Children of the promise Hallelujah and do you know that promise have to do with the election the birth the chosen of God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah and that is exactly what we have been saying that those who are and listen what we are called here now those who are of that Royal Seed of Abraham Hallelujah we come from the King I said we come from the King of Kings we are Kings and princes and Priests from the presence of almighty God hallelujah they just give you this action that you're gonna dress up like a priest you have to dress up like an Archbishop and then you are a priest you have to go to a certain school and be educated there are certain way to have their slant their point of view on this word before you are certified by them not ordained by God but certified by them that you are indeed a registered and recognized priest and and so on before him God is saying no no no no no no no no get away from that get back to me and my word hallelujah if you are of that Royal seed act like royalty act like a son of K of God act like a son of a king amen you are not there to beg them for truth you are the very sources of Truth for this hour for the word is going through you now amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Living God hallelujah that's why brother Brandon said I'd rather a man that rather just make a mistake go make a mistake than one who is just trying to be so perfect thinking that he ain't gonna make no mistake just be yourself yeah let's be who you are and then God now knows what got your brethren to well no no what needs to be correct what to pray for what you walk around trying to think that you're you're Hail Mary or something like that no sir you just got to let the Holy Spirit have his way with you and if you're the Royal seed the true seed of God you're not going to be outlandish you're not going to be up but if you that's why it says again in jail but if we sin if we make a mistake if we trespass amen God says all you got to do is confess your faults one to another Hallelujah confess your faults to God hallelujah wash your rope in the Crimson Fountain and recognize that you are the sons and daughters of the Living God Hallelujah the old Psalm that says we are the sons of God we are the sons of God we washed our robes in the Crimson Fountain we are the sons of God we are the children of the Living God because we washed ourselves Hallelujah we are the ones that come from Edom these that wash their robes white in the blood of the Lamb hallelujah amen and there's still Power in the Blood that's the bloodborne we can the blood grows stronger every day you put wine in a bottle it don't get weaker and weaker it gets more powerful more potent because it's there praise God the longer it goes they pay more money to get uh three thousand uh year old bottle of wine amen but man made wine three thousand year old might end up being sour but the one that Jesus gives Hallelujah when they're drinking they say man why you kept this wine to last why you kept this group till the last oh why you kept them until every we wanted to have them earlier no but you would have too much time to do a whole lot of impersonation and make things even worse so I let them come into the end here so that they can display the word and before you know it they're up and they're out of here by the grace of God we are the sons and daughters of the Living God Amen yes sir oh praise God so the promise has to do with election or of God's choosing and that is exactly what we have been saying those who are the Royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated of God the foreknown of God they were the ones that were in the mind of God and His Thoughts Hallelujah in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally eternally though not expressed though not experts how do you express yourself you speak and your spoken word is the expression praise God and so this spoken word is the Original Seed but even if you stop there you have to got a revelation beyond that that before that became spoken word to be expressed it had to be the word in him part of him the great purifier amen blessed be the name of the Lord and that part of it was sent down we're going to touch that a little bit here praise the Lord and move on from here by the grace of God hallelujah do not express until each age came forth in their designated and decreed season in other words that seed could not be expressed manifested until the season and I explained that and the age that they are supposed to manifest came into being because God wouldn't put you to be afoot when it's up here now in let's say the Pentecostal age of speaking and you were trying to go back and try to be afoot you're out of sync with the the music that's being played while the Saints are Marching into glory and trying to get out from off the hill and climb into heaven and you are not in tune with the music you you lost the beat of the great composer you don't recognize what is happening and there you are so there is came forth in their decreed and uh season praise the Lord hallelujah as each member came forth it became expressed it became manifest and then it takes its place in the body what body the body he was building Through the Ages and you didn't go back and find yourself in another part you come into this age that we are in now and you are finding your part or your place like the stones in Solomon building which is another type you use each Stone particularly cut and placed in that building to Bear a certain amount of weight whether they're going to be a stone in the foundation or they're going to be a keystone here or there there were each place there in that Temple for God's Divine Purpose for his honor but now the temple he says is not a natural Temple Solomon couldn't build that the 10th Line building is a spiritual Temple amen the temple I'm gonna build using men and women a step of stones to fit that building and then the Masterpiece brother Brandon said even though they are Stones they need God to have spiritual store Nations to come and cut and ship and ship that they can fit right into the temple that man glory to God that's why when the natural Temple of Solomon was made he there were not shaped he said there was no song of hammeran and and a hammer and all that something this they were they were fit there in such a wonderful way there was no sound and it's the same thing now it's not using a saw on you or using a a whip for using some kind of a scourging metal on you but preaching the word and when the word Goes Forth and you recognize you take your place I am not here to put you in your place but you are here to hear the word and put yourself into that position see yourself into the place you are supposed to be glory to God hallelujah a lot of you here are seeing your place are you praise the name of the Lord whether I speak louder I speak soft it's the same thing it's just my own human excitement of what I'm seeing and feeling by the grace of God hallelujah same for you amen praise God hallelujah yes sir continue the quotation thus we see this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride so when we make that statement you know just oh the spoken word seed bright you don't realize you you it's a whole sermons in that going back from that seed back Original Seed in his mind because there's all kinds of seeds scattered in the field now you look out in the world there's all kinds of Christians you go out there the churches are jam-packed even the message the churches are full with people amen putting a message blaster on your brow mark yourself and saying I am I am marked here with this that I am a son around that doesn't do it it's when that Mark is in your soul and nobody can take it away because you recognize that brother Simon didn't tell you it and then you just believe him what he said amen but it's in you because God revealed that to you I am one of them I am one of them said I'm one of them and I can say it and believe it with all my heart not some imagination of uh you know human imagination but the confidence in the grace of almighty God hallelujah praise God think of it the literal spoken word seed bride amen though she is feminine in designation as you see as a wife she is also called the body of Christ amen hallelujah so it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him and came from the same source I was eternal with him because we are in him praise God hallelujah so we are here manifesting the if you want to put that where the feminine nature of God God has no nature of believing this believing or even believing because he is God he had nothing out there else for him to believe on or disbelieve or whatever he is God but we being of that feminine nature we come here that we can believe or disbelieve or doubt or waver or whatever that is the feminine nature of God and have little fears fearful of this fearful of that and that he has to quiet that down and said no you don't need to fear that I'll take care of that I'll do this I'll do that that's the way God wants to recognize that he there is the great headship to the bride amen hallelujah now so we came therefore we came from the same source Hallelujah and it's now manifesting God in a many membered body Hallelujah glory to God remember Hallelujah now I'm just going to pray see here now when he is the word came down and came into human flesh he was called what this son of God right here in this quotation brother Branham said by coming into flesh he gained the title of being called a son is that right it was God himself but because he created this body that he uh created for himself to live in it was a creation it was called the son of that eternal spirit so he gave the title of being called a son the same with us Eternal beings but we didn't come as one man we came in many membered body from many parents many Origins we come in and we but we come into flesh but the Eternal beings living in that flesh Hallelujah gain the title of becoming or being sons of God he was the son we are now sons and others of the Living God Amen I don't know if I got true to you there what I'm willing to get through but that's really what if God is letting us know praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen so now even as many of the redeemed are now the spoken word seed amen manifest in flesh praise God and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God by rebirth Hallelujah because we were seed before we were Reborn is that right you are seed before you were reborn glory to God and because we were seed is the reason why we could be quickened because you are a sick child of God because you are the original seed that was in his mind why you can be quickened now to come into your Birthright promise that you can become aware awake and recognize who you are in him amen not appealing to your mind not appearing to intellectual of understanding but the spirit of God appeals to something deeper than I can explain the prophet puts this way that deep calls back to the deep and the Deep response amen praise be to God hallelujah amen because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened Amen in because in the non-seed there is nothing to Quicken is that right there is nothing to Quicken praise the name of the Lord hallelujah and why is there nothing to Quicken there is no Gene of God there is no germ of God there to Quicken praise the Lord if you want to question me on that that's why I walk here with the literal Pages or the smoke spoken word book praise the Lord and praise God he says it clearly here today it's page 151 or there he says it yes he says they could not they can't you can't be reborn right glory to God hallelujah I'm thinking now of some readings where he was saying right after that he says that is the reason you cannot be a pig and then you say oh I heard the word and you now become a lamb no you had to be a lamb to begin with you had to be of the original seat to begin with and the word just recognized and causes you to recognize who you are you don't take a pig and put him in a sheep pen and then call him a sheep no his original being in the church doesn't make him a Christian you know putting him inside the sheep and don't turn him into a sheep oh praise God so God's word is like that you are Original Seed I pray the Holy Spirit get oh take the thought and make it clear to you that that cannot be changed or erase but there's a whole lot of false seeds out there scattered by the enemy amen hallelujah now we know of course that we um come exactly the way that Adam came from God as a spoken word seed of the Living God Amen but then later he was placed into flesh that he could do the tilling and the sowing praise is God but then we now ended up being trapped in flesh praise God we got trapped in flesh and God now sends somebody to instead of Elohim himself coming and saying let there be light he sends a prophet and he said let there be light it is the rising of the Sun a prophet comes on the scene he doesn't come and say let every seed brings forth after its kind but God the spirit speaks through the prophet and says to you this spoken word is your Original Seed amen your mind may not fully understand that but something inside of you wakes up right away when it begins to hear that it strikes something in your heart and it recognizes its position praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen so that Pillar of Fire that came there with and on Adam it's the same pillar fire came down when the apostles came down here upon us came down upon the prophet it was not only over his head but a part of that was living in him Hallelujah it lives in you he lives in me he lives in you if you believe the word of God you are the lights of the world we are the lights of the world this darkness of this young hour and age that we are living in We Are The Lights of the Living God of the world here today praise the name of the Lord you know it clearly in the word of God we said it last week we say it again the bride his wife was in him just like God's wife was in his mind Adam's wife was in his loins and we praise God we find out that we were in the world we were already in him waiting for the hour when he would use a prophet to speak the word and to gather up all the lost things and restoration and all that no praise God I I stopped there because you're going off to another uh situation I want to go directly out of the he said now you see this seventh seal it's the end of the church age this seventh seal is the end of the church age hallelujah it's the End Amen it's just you see it's just like my fire in a rocket into the air and that rocket explodes and it goes up and then it explodes again and it goes up it puts out five stars maybe one of them Stars one of them stars of those five stars explodes again and after that comes another five stars and it sends that all out and it all goes out until it begins to fade on out and goes right back into that seventh seal which is Christ he said and then it just ends there and that's where we are at we're just we're nearing the end because we're going back where we come from Hallelujah all the little Jew drops that come down during the night and settle on the ground now the Sun is up and it's pulling he's pulling us back where we come from and we'll go back to where we come from hallelujah amen yes sir it ends time for this it ends time for that it ends time for everything everything is now going ending up right into that seventh seal amen that's the way it is praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God I'm just closing off with a few of these things here uh that I have here I just want you to see this praise God hallelujah oh praise God now uh we know that Satan will try to impersonate it he'll try to impersonate everything the church will ever do amen he's tried to do it we notice it through the Antichrist but this is one thing he cannot impersonate there'll be no mimics to this you see because he don't know it even that statement was just put out like that I'm going to throw a whole lot of them off because it's not just knowing it you might even know about it but that's not the point you have to be it right and the devil will have to it's the same trap he got caught in with boas with Ruth there for him to be kinsman redeemer he has to take on all the debts all the liabilities you have to take on everything and he's a no no he back right out like now for him he wants to impersonate it he wants to be the Redeemer and own all of us or God's Goods but when he finds out he is going to be the substitute he got to pay the price he got to go die on a cross he back right out he don't want to be no kinsman redeemer and that's where Jesus as this substitute as the kinsman redeemer took that place because he was ready and willing to die to buy back his own to redeem his own praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God Amen and there's where in the in the in the church age book just after what I just said if you were to continue you won't see he says he he breaks suddenly from that and he says you all you see and that is why we see it says buy back it says redeem he says it says restore because this is the hour now when he's redeeming restoring and he's buying back his own and bringing them back to himself praise God he already owned you you already in him but now he lost you and Satan had control of you in his pawn shop but now he's come to buy you back with his Precious Blood to pay the price amen this is mine I come to claim it this is mine she is mine he is mine I come to claim them their mind praise God hallelujah amen yes sir she that's the way it is uh one more thing here one or two more here you don't mind this do you it's not one o'clock yet praise God I think I quoted that end of the church age I already said that one place here there praise the Lord he says here they can impersonate this because too impersonate it and it wouldn't be an impersonation because if you become it you are it there is no impersonation you can't impersonate it and so praise the lord the devil can't do it so here it is now notice this is the end time message this seal amen he revealed all the six but don't say nothing about this seventh amen hallelujah the end time seal praise God you hear what it's called The End Time seal uh just just listen to that he's telling you right plane there the time for the church ages are ended like we didn't understand at first when the angel put us put in the land and on the sea time shall be no more people were preaching at the end of the world and he was just announcing the end of the church ages that ended when that seventh messenger Come Those Church angels are over amen and then Christ himself amen he the mighty Angel The Covenant Angel the one that led Israel and so on uh it comes now to the church amen and instead of the it you know like John the good friend passing on the letter uh or telling you what he said he comes himself and he becomes The Interpreter of his own word revealing his own word to his children feeding his own Sheep amen not Peter with a key in his hand in Rome saying Peter feed my sheep and the revelation of it is Peter supposed to stand there with the staff and feed the sheep no but he was letting you know he is going to come himself and he's going to feed his sheep and then the supernatural effects of the mystery of preaching is that when the preacher is preaching the word goes out but he knows what portion you need doesn't matter what secret thoughts you're thinking doesn't matter what secret need you have that you never spoke to any human being the holy spirit will still take that word and he will just send out that word wherever it's supposed to go and it meets the needs of the individuals that need the word not the old dead word where you can quote Oh God give me a promise if I believe that he will prosper me no but when the word become I am present tense to you individual and God speaks you are certain of God because you recognize that he is telling you himself and you recognize him in the moment in the moment that we are living in God making himself known praise the Lord hallelujah oh thanks be to God Amen yes sir oh my then friends you must recognize Revelation 10 1-7 at the end of that the end of that seventh Angel's message then all the Mysteries of God would be known is that right at the end of the seventh Angel's message it didn't say that while that all the missions will be known during the ministry of the Seven Angels but he's saying here at the end of the seventh Angels message all the mysteries of God would be known how it's going to be known is he himself has to make it manifest no one will close it I'm just talking now I'm just talking with you praise the Lord now you understand when the when those disciples went and said Lord how come it is that we understand and they don't understand what you are saying he says because unto you it's given to know the mystery of the Kingdom but unto them it is not given Hallelujah blessed the name of the Lord I'm saying that I recognize Paul said Peace and Grace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ things like that I just used to read Passover quickly because you know it's just peace and Grace he's telling you the airplane as the Revelation begins to break on you you'll get more peace in your heart Grace in your life it starts to multiply itself in your life as though Revelation breaks Hallelujah let me put it this way you begin to enter into the Believers rest amen you entered into the believer's rest you begin to rest everything on him and without him you do nothing without him nothing was made that was made you begin to rest on the word and do nothing you say nothing you don't do nothing without him because you are part of him and he is part of you amen and here he is telling them clearly in the word of God that unto you is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the Living God and that's wonderful isn't it because that's telling you as the word is being taught to you for he was teaching them and they didn't understand they didn't understand for a while what he was teaching but then it starts breaking on them and they are they've been getting out they're worried about them understanding they start worrying about the other people how come they're not seeing how come they're not understanding what what we are understanding to be unto you is given to know the mystery of the Kingdom you have the gift you have the gift you come with the gift and you to recognize what I'm saying here you come with that seed in you to recognize me and who I am you come with that part in you that recognizes itself in me because the Deep causes the Deep the word will come to the word amen hallelujah like that hey praise God and as I teach even in this present tense the word and you begin to and continue to believe the word and receive the word grace is Multiplied to you peace is Multiplied to you and the word is Multiplied to you because the more you see is the more you see in the word of God begins to multiply until you praise the Lord and when you get that you recognize that that's the Holy Ghost literally calling your name praise the name of the Lord I was really trying to find the quotes here where you can because some people need to profit themselves saying it all right so in but you can go to yourself book and find it there where you say he said the book is only unfolding it now it was always there in him but now the book is only unfolding it now the names are now being called out now now I know you're not in a classroom that you have to raise your finger up and say present no but praise God the holy spirit is calling you by your name amen hallelujah oh Mary goes to the Garden sees the man looks like a just looks like a gardener and she says oh my oh where have they let my Lord From the Moment he said Mary she recognized Hallelujah who was calling her name amen we recognize who is calling our name out of this word amen yes Lord praise God forevermore we realize the holy ghost that is what the message the use of the message in this hour is calling the names of the elect so that if there is any amongst you that haven't recognized who they are that is calling those last and lost ones back to their position because when the last one comes in the whole thing winds up and we go back into the presence of almighty God hallelujah aren't you glad for this hour while the musicians are coming that we can recognize that we are now part of that Kingdom of the Living God I said we're in the kingdom of God and we belong to this great Kingdom the invisible Kingdom of our invisible King praise the Lord I thank God for his grace and his love and his Mercy praise the Lord because we are on the inter internet and this goes out sometimes you know I may just want to talk with you but I I really can't like that because it just goes dispersing everywhere praise the Lord so I just have to come off from here until that is off and then we know the worship and all that goes forward but brother sister what a wonderful time we're living in when the word of God is making itself clear and it's so plain I see these young people just not in their head like he said I'll make it so clear that even even a child a wayfaring man along the way it'll be so plain they'll see it they'll understand it amen if it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God original seeds not fake seeds but the original seeds are the Living God may God bless you while our worship leader comes here brother as the Lord leads you you just choose whatever chorus Psalm you want and let the Holy Spirit lead you along praise the name of the Lord Jesus [Music] oh my God let us pray for brother Gabriel Ferretti who you saw just uh got up and had to leave that's because he got a message not his father-in-law just passed away praise the Lord so let's just have a moment of silence by our heads and ask for him and his wife the living who are now alive now we can pray for that God will Comfort their hearts in this great hour that they're living in our gracious Heavenly Father we thank thee for this brother who like Cornelius a great son supporter and soldier of the Gospel bless him father bless his wife bless the entire family amen bless Adam bless glory be with them and then reach out to the extended family I pray that the Holy Spirit Will Comfort their hearts in this hour we understand and I know we know he will understand what this kind of Separation means but uh father the rest may not understand what it means and may have some illusory ideas and thoughts of what it might be and it throws them into a greater and deeper sadness and grief oh Lord but we as true believers recognize what the word says and especially pray for our brother be thou now is Fortress oh be thou uh somebody that he can lean on May the Holy Spirit father go with him comfort him Comfort them and father would you just let salvation come to his house and through this death let there come Life Won't you grant the father May the Holy Spirit leaves this church and go forth father and let the same Finger of God that writes him fire upon the tables of stone writes in right in fire upon the tables of a of a human heart or human heart father bringing them to recognition of this word suddenly father turn things for your
