[7:21] The god of this evil

[7:27] has blinded their eyes today.
[7:33] [music]
[7:34] A people of the earth not according

[8:51] [music]
[8:52] is
[8:56] [music] most like this upon
[9:02] The people God [music]
[9:05] is
[9:08] God's prophet has [music] his name
[9:12] proclaiming his holy word.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; [music]
[9:20] &gt;&gt; accepted uneduc.
[9:27] [music]
[9:31] They've taken the
[9:34] [music] world.
[9:36] This is dreaming.
[9:40] [music]
[9:43] This is dreaming.
[9:48] It's sped.
[9:50] [music]
[9:56] [music]
[10:06] All things [music and singing] are
[10:07] ready.
[10:11] The bridegroom [singing]
[10:13] [music]
[10:16] and he that [music]
[10:21] evening
[10:23] time [music] is here.
[10:28] Oh, [music]
[10:28] this is the
[10:33] &gt;&gt; [music]
[10:34] &gt;&gt; It's made a new day
[10:42] [music]
[10:44] for
[10:47] you.
[10:51] [music]
[10:52] All things are ready.
[10:57] right through my [music]
[11:05] [music]
[11:06] company.
[11:08] Evening time is here.
[11:13] [music]
[11:25] Thank you Lord. Heavenly Father,
[11:29] it's true, Lord, that indeed [music] is
[11:31] the evening time, Lord.
[11:34] Oh God, we are grateful that even in
[11:37] such a time as this, Lord, you promised
[11:40] us light, oh God. Lord, you [music] said
[11:43] that there would be light in the evening
[11:45] time and we are not children [music] of
[11:48] the darkness, Lord God. But we are
[11:51] grateful that before the foundation of
[11:53] the world, Lord, you chose us. For such
[11:56] a time [music] as this, Lord God, when
[11:58] the world is in complete chaos and
[12:02] turmoil, [music] oh God, we have this
[12:04] blessed hope in our hearts, Lord. And
[12:07] surely we are grateful to [music] you,
[12:09] Father. It makes us humble. We feel so
[12:13] small, Lord God, that [music] we have a
[12:17] message of hope.
[12:19] We have a bright future ahead of us,
[12:21] Lord God. And we are not wasting our
[12:24] time today, Lord, [music]
[12:26] because you've given us this blessed
[12:28] assurance that Jesus [music] is ours,
[12:31] Lord. And so, Lord, as we've gathered
[12:33] here tonight once again, Lord, we
[12:36] [music] are opening our hearts, oh God,
[12:38] that you will come through thy word and
[12:41] minister to our hearts, Lord. You know
[12:44] every need,
[12:46] what's beating behind every heart, oh
[12:48] God, it's known to [music] you, Father,
[12:50] and there's nothing but what your spirit
[12:53] knows. [music] So we pray, Lord, that as
[12:56] the man of God would come, speak through
[12:59] his lips, Lord God, and strengthen each
[13:02] one, those [music] who may be going
[13:04] through some trials, dark moments in
[13:07] their lives, Lord. May you just
[13:09] encourage them, boost their faith, Lord,
[13:12] that we might leave [music] here
[13:13] rejoicing and strengthened, ready to
[13:16] keep fighting the good fight of faith.
[13:18] Lord, bless brother Anthony, Lord, as he
[13:21] continues to lead us in [music] worship.
[13:23] Our musicians, bless them, too, for
[13:25] their sacrifice. Lord, we thank you and
[13:28] we love you, Father. In Jesus [music]
[13:29] Christ's name we pray. Amen.

[18:26] &gt;&gt; That you're one of his. [music] Amen.
[18:29] That's why you've come here tonight,
[18:30] right?
[18:31] &gt;&gt; Because you've identified yourself with
[18:33] the word of God. You've identified
[18:36] yourself with the message of this hour.
[18:38] Amen. [music]
[18:39] Praise God. That's what um you know
[18:42] excites our soul to know that uh we're
[18:44] just not another church. We're not just
[18:48] another gathering. We're we're uh we're
[18:51] we're that we're that little flock that
[18:53] uh unique speckled bird that um has so
[18:58] much zeal [music] and uh excitement
[19:00] about the word of God and a desire to
[19:03] hear God's [music] word and to know that
[19:05] he has something for us every single
[19:08] day. That this walk is not just a
[19:12] traditional walk. I'm a Christian. No,
[19:15] this is a walk. I am a son or daughter
[19:18] of God and I've come into contact with
[19:20] the living God. Amen. Praise God. It's
[19:24] good to be in the house of the Lord
[19:25] tonight.
[19:27] And so tonight we're um it's Bible study
[19:30] and um did you uh upload the file,
[19:34] Abraham?
[19:39] Praise God. Amen. So tonight we're going
[19:42] to be looking at um the title is the
[19:45] rapture is in progress now. Amen. And
[19:50] it's a Bible study. So it's things that
[19:53] um you know scriptures and quotes that
[19:56] you know we've heard over and over
[19:58] again. But you know, the one thing about
[20:00] the Lord is that when he wants to make
[20:02] something, you know, real in in the day
[20:06] that we're living, he he uh he just
[20:09] anoints the word of God and all of a
[20:11] sudden you've read that scripture,
[20:13] you've heard that scripture. Um and and
[20:17] then all of a sudden it just becomes
[20:18] alive to you. Amen. Becomes a new
[20:21] scripture. Praise God. It's under the
[20:23] file.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; You got it. Okay. Good. Praise God.
[20:28] Amen. And so the word becomes alive. It
[20:30] becomes real. And so we want to look at
[20:32] that here tonight. Um let's uh let's
[20:36] pray before we go to the word. Amen.
[20:38] Father, we're so grateful. Lord, this is
[20:41] the hour of the rapture. Lord, it's the
[20:44] season for the body change. It's the
[20:46] season where this bride puts on the very
[20:50] image
[20:51] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; The very life takes control. And Lord,
[20:57] our words um are your words.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; Your thoughts are our thoughts.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Everything becomes uh the purpose of God
[21:07] and the will of God when we've uh fully
[21:10] surrendered ourselves to your perfect
[21:12] will. Lord, may you take control now of
[21:14] this service. Bless our fellowship
[21:17] around your word, our time of study.
[21:19] Grant it Lord that you would break it
[21:21] make it simple Lord that that even the
[21:24] children can receive their portion.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; Grant it we pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So our scripture reading
[21:35] let's go to our first scripture. It's
[21:37] from Revelations chapter 8 verse 1. You
[21:41] got to keep clicking to bring up the
[21:44] slide. This is um this this kind of has
[21:47] like a progression. Amen. So it says
[21:50] here, "And when he had opened the
[21:51] seventh seal, there was silence in
[21:54] heaven about the space of half an hour."
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so I want to take
[22:02] this um this uh quote here from brother
[22:05] Brandham in 1963
[22:09] from Christ, the mystery of God
[22:10] revealed. He says God's great mystery of
[22:15] how it's a secret. How he kept it a
[22:19] secret.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Nobody knowed nothing about it. Even the
[22:23] angels didn't understand it. See, he
[22:26] didn't reveal it. That's the reason
[22:29] under our seventh mystery, when the
[22:32] seventh seal was opened, there was
[22:35] silence.
[22:37] Jesus when he was on earth they wanted
[22:39] to know when he would come. He said it's
[22:43] not even the son of man the son himself
[22:47] don't know when it's going to happen.
[22:49] See God has this all to himself. It's a
[22:54] secret. And that's the reason there was
[22:57] silence in heaven for a space of half an
[23:01] hour. and seven thunders uttered their
[23:05] voices. And John was even forbidden to
[23:08] write it. See,
[23:10] &gt;&gt; now notice this. The coming of the Lord.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. Amen. Praise
[23:18] God.
[23:20] And so, um,
[23:23] you know, Brother Brandham
[23:25] made it very clear that the rapture, and
[23:29] we're talking about the rapture and how
[23:31] the rapture is in progress. Now, you've
[23:34] got to recognize that the message of
[23:36] this hour is changing you. It's
[23:39] translating you from this dimension to
[23:42] the sixth dimension.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a meeting in the air
[23:46] in between. And that is that is the next
[23:50] major event that we're looking forward
[23:52] to as the true church, the bride of
[23:55] Jesus Christ, those that have recognize
[23:57] the word for their day. Amen. And and
[24:00] here in the message, the rapture,
[24:04] brother Brandham says, "But but to the
[24:06] church, the bride, the rapture is a
[24:10] revelation to her."
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; It's revealed to her. Amen.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; That the revelation
[24:20] the true bride of Christ will be waiting
[24:23] for that revelation of the rapture.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Now it is a revelation
[24:30] for the revelation is faith. We know
[24:33] that faith is a revelation. God has to
[24:36] reveal. That's why you know you hear
[24:40] about the rapture being talked in
[24:41] different churches and you know
[24:43] denominational churches and so forth.
[24:46] But the essence of revelation is what
[24:50] makes it real to the individual.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; Okay? Otherwise, it's just scripture.
[24:56] They can read second Thessalonians. They
[24:58] can read, you know, Corinthians where it
[25:00] talks about the the change. They can
[25:03] they can read all the scriptures. They
[25:05] can talk about it. But but have they
[25:08] entered into the actual moment and
[25:13] season of the word which will produce
[25:16] the rapture?
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Only the quickening power of God's word
[25:22] will actually translate you and change
[25:26] your mortal body from this dimension to
[25:29] the next dimension. So never
[25:31] underestimate
[25:33] the beauty and the power of your ability
[25:37] to receive revelation
[25:40] &gt;&gt; because the rapture is a revelation.
[25:44] Amen. Praise God. And so let's go to our
[25:48] next scripture. We're going to be
[25:50] looking at, you know, these are simple
[25:52] scriptures that we've looked at, but
[25:54] it's a Bible study. We want to see what
[25:56] the Lord is going to, you know, open to
[25:58] us and, you know, make the rapture more
[26:00] real to us.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Bring it more clear to us. Bring it more
[26:04] in the moment. Uh, apply it in our lives
[26:07] and see how simple things that are going
[26:09] on from your day-to-day activities are
[26:12] actually uh, you know, dealing with your
[26:15] character, dealing with your your heart,
[26:17] dealing with your thoughts, and bringing
[26:20] you into that oneness with him because
[26:23] it's him and you. That's your hope of
[26:25] glory.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you. The the the the
[26:29] quickening power. The scripture says, if
[26:31] the same spirit that raised Christ from
[26:35] the dead dwell in you, it's going to
[26:38] quicken.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; It's going to change you. It's going to
[26:40] translate you.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; And so from the scripture now, we read
[26:44] the first scripture that you know when
[26:46] when that seventh seal was open, there
[26:48] was silence in heaven. Then we read what
[26:51] it said there from Christ the mystery of
[26:52] God. The seventh seal was the coming of
[26:56] the Lord.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; That's what the seventh seal produced in
[27:00] 1963
[27:02] when the there was an earthly angel on
[27:04] the earth, the heavenly angel, the
[27:07] mighty angel himself who was the one
[27:10] that came with an open book in his hand
[27:12] now. Amen. Because he's the one that's
[27:15] coming to redeem and to and to claim his
[27:18] inheritance. Praise God. It it the
[27:20] mighty God himself, Christ himself, the
[27:24] Lord himself. Amen. Coming down to
[27:28] redeem and to catch away his bride.
[27:31] Amen. That was the start of the rapture.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; That was the scripture that this
[27:39] particular scripture that we're going to
[27:41] read right now pertains to this day,
[27:45] &gt;&gt; this hour,
[27:46] &gt;&gt; this time. Amen. Praise God. And so here
[27:49] it says in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18,
[27:53] "For the Lord himself
[27:56] shall descend from heaven with a shout,
[28:01] with the voice of the archangel, and
[28:03] with the trump of God, and the dead in
[28:06] Christ shall rise first."
[28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we which are alive and remain
[28:12] shall be caught up together with them in
[28:16] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
[28:18] And so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[28:22] Wherefore comfort one another with these
[28:25] words.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so when we look at
[28:29] this scripture, it's clear here. The
[28:32] Lord himself.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. It's going to take the
[28:37] Lord himself to come.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. and quicken us.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to take the Lord
[28:42] himself to come and indwell in us.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's the only way you're
[28:48] going to see the change.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But notice here, uh, and
[28:53] we're going to look at the shout and the
[28:54] voice and the archangel and so forth and
[28:56] the trump of God. But, you know, verse
[28:58] 17, then we which are alive and remain
[29:01] shall be caught up together with them in
[29:03] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
[29:07] And you know, those that have received
[29:12] Christ already
[29:15] under the message of this hour and those
[29:17] that received it under Paul because
[29:21] remember the coming of the Lord, the
[29:24] first coming of the Lord was to come and
[29:27] pay the price.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. He had to pay the
[29:32] price for our redemption.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Once that price was paid, it was
[29:36] the Holy Ghost that he sent back down
[29:38] upon us. And that's the quickening
[29:40] spirit.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; Now, through those seven church ages,
[29:46] there were those that receive the Holy
[29:48] Ghost for their day.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; They died in the Lord.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; They went to the sixth dimension.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; They're already there.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; They're already young.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So, we're not going to
[30:05] hinder them.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; They've already gone on
[30:08] &gt;&gt; to their change. They've already They've
[30:10] already received their change.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they've gone from from
[30:15] this dimension by the Holy Ghost to the
[30:19] redeemed.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; It's we here that finish and fulfill the
[30:27] fullness of the whole plan of
[30:29] redemption.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. where Christ himself now comes to
[30:33] to actually because remember his
[30:36] original plan was for him to be God in
[30:41] man on earth.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where he and man would become one.
[30:47] And that is God himself joining back
[30:51] together with the body which is the
[30:54] church which is Eve. Amen. Praise God.
[30:58] But this Eve, she's going to she's not
[31:00] going to be deceived.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; She's going to be the one that's going
[31:04] to receive the word, the quickening
[31:06] power to actually produce the rapture.
[31:10] Amen. Because we know that once the
[31:12] rapture is produced, this world goes
[31:15] into complete and total utter
[31:18] &gt;&gt; tribulation.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. As long as we're here,
[31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. This earth is being
[31:26] held back from going into fullblown
[31:29] tribulation.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; It's going to get messy. The next stage
[31:33] is where God is going to where Christ is
[31:36] going to come and reveal himself to the
[31:39] 144,000.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; But we go to the marriage supper.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So, we're going to be
[31:46] caught up together with them. Amen.
[31:49] They've already entered into that other
[31:52] dimension. So, we're not going to
[31:54] prevent them.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; We're not hindering them. They're just
[31:58] waiting on us so that we can have our
[32:01] great meeting in the air with the Lord.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because they're waiting on
[32:06] the Lord, too.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the Lord is here right now.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; He's not there. He's here.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's here connecting and becoming
[32:17] one with his bride.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And so let's go to um so so
[32:24] what we're going to be looking at here
[32:26] is you know the three comeings. We're
[32:30] looking at this rapture. We're looking
[32:32] at the understanding there's there's the
[32:34] comingings the the the the comingings of
[32:36] the Lord Jesus. There's three. And
[32:38] brother Brandham says it here. You can
[32:41] go to the next slide from the message be
[32:44] certain of God in 1959. He says the
[32:46] coming of Jesus is three times. Did you
[32:48] know that Jesus come the first time to
[32:51] redeem his bride?
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. To pay the price. He comes the
[32:56] next time. We're caught up in the air to
[33:00] meet him in the air. Amen. We caught up
[33:04] to meet him. He comes to receive his
[33:06] bride. And then the next time, the third
[33:09] time, he comes. He comes as king and
[33:12] queen to reign on earth with his bride.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we know now that we're in
[33:18] that second stage,
[33:21] &gt;&gt; which is the second coming,
[33:23] &gt;&gt; which is now in progress,
[33:26] &gt;&gt; which is the rapture.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; That's what his second coming was all
[33:31] about.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; The rapture of uniting himself with the
[33:37] bride.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So here now, let's go to the next
[33:41] slide.
[33:43] Three things happen.
[33:46] Okay. From the scripture that we read, a
[33:48] shout, a voice, a trumpet has to happen
[33:53] before Jesus appears.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Now, a shout. Amen. Praise God. What's
[33:59] the shout? Jesus does all three of them
[34:03] when he's descending.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has descended.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; He is here right now. Amen. Praise God.
[34:13] And there's a shout. And what is a
[34:14] shout? It's the message going forth
[34:18] first the living bread of life bringing
[34:23] forth the bride. So what's the purpose
[34:25] of the shout?
[34:28] The message to call you and me
[34:32] &gt;&gt; to bring the bride into her rightful
[34:34] position
[34:36] &gt;&gt; so that she can so she can produce the
[34:39] body change. Amen. Praise God. Then the
[34:43] next thing that happens you can go to
[34:45] the next slide
[34:48] is and this is from the rapture message
[34:51] is the voice. Therefore the message
[34:53] calls the bride together. The same
[34:56] morning with a loud voice he screamed
[35:00] out with that shout. So within the shout
[35:04] is the voice of God and the voice of God
[35:08] is what wakes up the sleeping saints.
[35:12] and brings us into our recognition of
[35:16] who we are, the living bride
[35:19] &gt;&gt; here on earth. Amen. Bringing Eve back
[35:23] into full manifestation,
[35:26] but this time not deceived. She's one
[35:29] with him.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So with a loud voice, he
[35:34] cried, "Lazarus, come forth." See, and
[35:36] the voice wakes up the sleeping bride,
[35:40] the sleeping dead. Amen. So this voice
[35:45] that's now in the land and the shout
[35:49] that's now in the land, and we know the
[35:51] shout is the message is in you and me.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we receive the message of the
[35:58] hour and we recognize that it's Christ
[36:01] coming to the present stage of his
[36:03] ministry, we realize that we are the
[36:07] ones that are now his voice.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; We carry the shout.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a shout. And you know,
[36:15] like this Sunday, we're going to be
[36:16] looking a little bit deeper into, you
[36:18] know, the inheritance and um the
[36:21] incorruptible inheritance. And we're
[36:23] going to be looking at the shout
[36:25] actually and how the shout is now in the
[36:27] bride and you know how that shout was in
[36:30] the mind of God right when he was
[36:33] talking to to to Job when he says where
[36:36] were you when the sons of God shouted
[36:40] hallelujah that same shout is now in you
[36:44] and me. Amen. because his plan was
[36:47] always for him to be God in man here on
[36:53] earth. Amen. Praise God. Glory to God.
[36:56] And so the next thing is the trumpet.
[37:00] Go to the next slide. Also from the
[37:02] rapture message, he says, "Now the next
[37:04] is what?" A trumpet. Amen. A voice, a
[37:09] shout, a voice, a trumpet. Now the third
[37:12] thing is a trumpet which always at the
[37:16] feast of trumpet is calling the people
[37:18] to the feast and that'll be the bride's
[37:21] supper, the lamb's supper with the bride
[37:24] in the sky. Amen. We're going to get
[37:27] that last trump of God. Amen. There's
[37:30] going to be a trumpet that's going to
[37:31] sound within our hearts and our souls.
[37:33] It's going to quicken us. It's going to
[37:35] translate us. It's it's going to move us
[37:38] to that to that wedding supper because
[37:40] this listen the marriage the marriage
[37:43] has already taken place.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; If you've received the word for your day
[37:48] and you've recognized the opening of
[37:50] that seventh seal, you've recognized
[37:53] that the mighty angel is Christ come
[37:55] down to meet with his bride. Amen.
[37:58] That's the invisible union of the bride.
[38:01] Glory to God. Amen. This is what we've
[38:03] already recognized. We've already come
[38:05] into that relationship. Glory. Amen. And
[38:09] the supper is that meeting in the air.
[38:12] That's the that's going to be the the
[38:13] the the you know the the great wedding
[38:16] supper. You know, after the wedding,
[38:19] everybody goes for a great wedding
[38:21] supper, but the wedding's already
[38:22] consummated. The bride and the groom
[38:25] have already become one. Amen.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Have you recognized that you are in
[38:30] union and married to the Lord Jesus
[38:32] Christ?
[38:34] Amen. That's the only one that's going
[38:36] to receive the rapture. Praise God.
[38:38] These are simple things. I know, but
[38:41] this is a Bible study, right? And so,
[38:43] we're looking at the at these things and
[38:44] we're just looking at the simplicity.
[38:46] We're being reminded of who we are, the
[38:49] bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. Glory to
[38:52] God.
[38:53] And so, our next slide is 1 Corinthians
[38:57] 15:51-54.
[39:00] Now he says, "Behold, I show you a
[39:03] mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we
[39:07] shall all be changed in a moment in the
[39:11] twinkling of an eye at the last trump.
[39:15] For the trumpet shall sound, and the
[39:17] dead shall be raised incorruptible, and
[39:20] we shall be changed. For this
[39:22] corruptible must put on incorruption,
[39:26] and this mortal must put on immortality.
[39:29] Amen. Praise God. Listen, to a lot of
[39:32] people, this sounds like a fantasy.
[39:35] You know, you even talk to Christians,
[39:37] you get out there and you talk to some
[39:39] Christians and they say, "Yeah, I
[39:40] believe the Lord Jesus Christ." And then
[39:42] you get into talking about the rapture
[39:44] and you say, "Well, do you understand
[39:46] that you're that you're going to be
[39:48] changed in a moment and in a twinkling
[39:50] of an eye? You're going to be translated
[39:52] out of this earthly dimension which is
[39:55] falling apart around you. Do you
[39:58] understand that? Do you recognize that
[40:00] that's something that's already started?
[40:03] It's in progress now. And in order for
[40:05] you to be a part of that, you need to
[40:07] receive the Holy Ghost for your day
[40:10] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost for our day is
[40:13] what produces the rapture.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't come any other way. And
[40:19] so these scriptures
[40:22] are are scriptures that that you know to
[40:25] the common person they don't understand
[40:27] it. It's not a reality to them because
[40:29] they haven't come into that personal
[40:33] experience with Jesus Christ.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; It only comes when that personal
[40:38] revelation breaks into your heart about
[40:41] putting on immortality.
[40:44] Understanding that you don't that that
[40:46] you you you come from God. You go back
[40:49] to God.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; If you're a son of God, you were always
[40:52] a son of God.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; A son of God is eternal. To be eternal
[40:57] means that you have you you never had a
[40:59] beginning.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; You never can have an end. Amen. These
[41:04] are the realities of immortality.
[41:07] Praise God. We can read these
[41:09] scriptures, but we don't fully
[41:10] understand them. But go to the next
[41:13] slide.
[41:14] A blast from heaven, the trump of God.
[41:17] One day there will come a blast from
[41:19] heaven and the dead in Christ shall rise
[41:21] first. These mortal bodies changed and
[41:25] made like unto his own glorious body.
[41:29] Amen. We're going to have eternal
[41:31] bodies. We're going to go back to the
[41:33] body that we had. Amen. Our theophony
[41:37] body, which is a, you know, the one that
[41:39] brother Brandham saw when he went to
[41:40] beyond the curtain of time. Do you
[41:42] believe that?
[41:44] &gt;&gt; I know that you know you're in these
[41:45] bodies. I know what I feel in the
[41:47] morning when I wake up. I know what you
[41:49] feel. You know, I know you young people,
[41:51] you just enjoy your your youth, but you
[41:54] know, uh you know, like we're we're
[41:56] feeling it. Amen. We're feeling that
[41:59] that we want this this change. We're
[42:01] feeling that we're looking forward to
[42:03] that that uh that change of that
[42:06] incorruptible body. Amen. That glorious
[42:09] body like unto his glorious body. What a
[42:12] parade that'll be when it starts
[42:14] heavenward some of these days in that
[42:17] rapturing time that lays ahead. Oh,
[42:20] proudly displaying the blood of Jesus
[42:22] Christ upon their chests. The message of
[42:26] God in the hour that they lived.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; That's the hour that we're looking
[42:31] forward to, brother. Amen. Praise God.
[42:34] We know that we've recognized the
[42:37] message for our day. We know that the
[42:39] message of this hour produces the
[42:42] rapture.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; We know that it's already in progress.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; We recognize that that God sent us a
[42:50] prophet that would introduce the mighty
[42:53] angel himself, which is the only way
[42:56] that that that you could receive
[42:58] rapturing faith. Amen. Listen, all those
[43:01] other seven church ages could not
[43:03] produce the rapture. could not produce
[43:07] the change of our bodies. Amen. We're
[43:11] the only age that receives the change
[43:14] because of the mighty angel come down to
[43:17] take possession and for us to become one
[43:20] with him. Amen. So that we can be
[43:23] changed by in the in the same way that
[43:26] he quickened himself. Amen. Praise God.
[43:30] Jesus showed the the the type of the
[43:33] rapture when he came the first time and
[43:35] he he he gave up the ghost and then he
[43:39] went to hell. Amen. He went to hell to
[43:42] to loose all of those that were chained
[43:45] up and and had could had had not
[43:47] received their theophony bodies yet.
[43:50] Amen. But he came took on that theophony
[43:54] went there released them and took them
[43:56] to their theophies.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. And now we are we are
[44:01] looking forward to the to the final
[44:03] change that finishes the fullness of the
[44:06] word for this day and for this hour.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; To do what? Go to the next slide. To
[44:13] become young men and women again.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; That's what the rapture is all about.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. To be young again.
[44:24] To be whole. Hallelujah. The whole
[44:26] thing. There's a there'll be a
[44:28] resurrection, a rapture, and a way it'll
[44:31] go. And before it ever go up to meet him
[44:34] by faith, I believe it in his grace that
[44:38] we will be among those people that'll be
[44:41] caught up. Amen. You believe that these
[44:44] mortal bodies will not see death, but
[44:47] just just of a sudden, they'll be like a
[44:50] sweep go over us and you're changed.
[44:54] You're turned back like Abraham was from
[44:57] an old man to a young man, from an old
[45:00] woman to a young woman. Glory to God.
[45:04] What's this sudden change? And after a
[45:07] while, you'll you're traveling like a
[45:09] thought. And you can see those then who
[45:12] are already resurrected. Oh, what an
[45:15] hour. Then we'll gather with them and
[45:18] then be caught up with them to meet the
[45:21] Lord in the air.
[45:24] Amen. Glory to God. Praise God.
[45:27] Hallelujah.
[45:29] Let's go to the next slide.
[45:32] And the body of Christ will come down.
[45:34] The corporal body of the Lord Jesus
[45:37] Christ sitting on the throne of God.
[45:40] That body will rise from the throne
[45:42] again. He will come back to earth. And
[45:46] when he does, every spirit that's born
[45:49] again will come back to a corporal body.
[45:53] young man and woman and live forever in
[45:56] the presence of God. He's left the
[45:59] throne.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; He's come to throne himself in you and
[46:03] me. Amen. Glory to God. This is the
[46:07] hour. This is the time. This is the
[46:10] season that we're living in right now.
[46:12] The rapture is in progress now.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Forever more.
[46:19] Amen. So, let's look at,
[46:23] you know, some silent facts about the
[46:28] rapture. Now, you know, we're in that
[46:30] half hour of silence. How many recognize
[46:32] that we're in that time and season right
[46:36] now where God is secretly where the Lord
[46:39] Jesus is secretly catching away one
[46:42] here, one there.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll take one, he'll leave
[46:48] one. Amen.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; That's why,
[46:51] look, we don't have a full church
[46:55] &gt;&gt; on Sundays. We're not packed out.
[47:00] Is that right?
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Don't expect us to have, you know, a
[47:05] huge packed out church.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Okay? God can add what he Listen, it's
[47:10] the Lord that adds, it's the Lord that
[47:11] takes.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. But this message
[47:16] has never been a great big flock.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; It's always been a little flock.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; That's why this this message of the
[47:25] hour, you you know there's one here, one
[47:29] there. You know, don't expect, you know,
[47:32] you might talk to a thousand people and
[47:34] and one or two of them might just even
[47:36] look into it.
[47:38] What is it? Because this message is not
[47:43] a message that that invites everybody.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; This message is about a little flock.
[47:51] It's about the attributes of God. It's
[47:54] about God's mind from the very beginning
[47:57] having having thoughts of just his
[48:01] family.
[48:02] Now, I know it sounds like, you know,
[48:04] well, what do you, you know, people
[48:06] think that, you know, that that that
[48:07] we're, you know, what are we trying to
[48:09] say that we're, you know, uh, unique and
[48:12] this and that. It's not that we're new
[48:15] unique. It's that the Lord, he's the
[48:19] same yesterday, today, and forever. All
[48:21] you need to do is go back and look
[48:24] through history. Look at the days of
[48:26] Noah.
[48:28] The whole world had gone into
[48:30] corruption. The Bible says, "As it was
[48:33] in the days of Noah,
[48:35] &gt;&gt; so shall it be when the Son of Man is
[48:39] being revealed."
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Because because all
[48:46] you got to do is take a quick look
[48:48] around to see that we're in the days of
[48:50] Noah
[48:51] &gt;&gt; and even worse
[48:54] &gt;&gt; because nobody
[48:57] is like taking God's word literally the
[49:02] way that you and I and and that little
[49:05] flock takes the word of God.
[49:08] they'll take it and they'll apply it
[49:10] and, you know, they'll they'll they'll
[49:12] create like a a religious, you know,
[49:15] experience because maybe their mum and
[49:18] their father were were Christians and or
[49:21] belonged to a church. But I'm talking
[49:23] about the reality of where what we're
[49:26] talking about here right now about the
[49:28] word being revealed to you by revelation
[49:32] that you're already raptured.
[49:35] The rapture started in your life when
[49:38] you received this message and you
[49:40] separated from friends, from family. You
[49:43] couldn't help it. You you because it it
[49:45] it it just made perfect sense to you.
[49:49] But you're a small flock.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; You're a minority. You're always going
[49:53] to be a minority.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; It's never going to be accepted by the
[49:58] masses.
[50:00] They're not going to accept this message
[50:03] of of the rapture of Christ, you know,
[50:06] his second coming. You tell somebody,
[50:08] you know, about the, you know, they'll
[50:10] tell you, "Oh, we're waiting on the
[50:11] coming of the Lord." You tell them,
[50:12] "He's already come.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; He's here now. He's living in a people.
[50:19] He's gathering every Sunday, every
[50:21] Wednesday in in churches with these with
[50:24] these minorities that are that are that
[50:27] are rejoicing, that are zealous about
[50:29] the word of God. They've allowed his
[50:31] word to take possession of their lives.
[50:34] They live different. We live different.
[50:37] We don't act like the rest of the world.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; They're out there and, you know, you get
[50:41] to talking to people and even Christians
[50:44] and all of a sudden the F-word comes
[50:45] this way, the F-word goes that way. They
[50:48] talk about these bars and these uh you
[50:50] know things that they look at and
[50:52] pornography and all these things and you
[50:54] go into their offices and you see
[50:56] pictures on their walls and you know
[50:59] they claim to be Christian but then they
[51:01] they there's a totally different life
[51:03] there.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[51:06] &gt;&gt; You're a minority.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; You're a minority.
[51:11] You're never going to be, you know,
[51:13] where like, yeah, you, you know, we we
[51:15] have camp meetings and we have, you
[51:17] know, special meetings and and you know,
[51:19] we pack out the house and many people
[51:22] come in and it's it's, you know, people
[51:24] of like, precious faith. But you go out
[51:27] there and you know you you you you try
[51:29] to you know share the message of the
[51:31] hour and right away you know you'll tell
[51:34] them that God sent a prophet and you
[51:36] know right away they'll look into it and
[51:37] the first thing they'll do is they'll go
[51:39] on the internet and they'll pop up his
[51:40] name and they're going to see just as
[51:42] many people saying false prophet
[51:46] &gt;&gt; uh you know cult
[51:48] as there are people that are saying he
[51:51] is the genuine prophet of Malachi 4:5.
[51:53] He was the messenger of Revelations 10
[51:56] 1-7.
[51:57] But you see, by revelation,
[52:01] &gt;&gt; you can say amen.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; You've recognized the word for your day.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; By revelation, what what is revelation?
[52:11] God revealing it to you.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Because because you were always a son or
[52:17] a daughter of God. And by
[52:19] predestination,
[52:21] by his fornowledge,
[52:23] he could predestinate and know that when
[52:27] the word was going to come to you, you
[52:30] would willingly desire it.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; You'd you'd recognize something because
[52:35] there was something in you from before
[52:39] the foundations of the world.
[52:41] So don't think that in this time where
[52:47] this church is being called out
[52:51] that the majority are going to recognize
[52:53] it.
[52:55] It's a secret.
[52:58] It's a mystery.
[53:00] But there's fellowship in the mystery.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; But you need to recognize that God sent
[53:05] a prophet. Then you need to recognize
[53:08] that God sent them to introduce the
[53:10] second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; You see, they never recognize John the
[53:15] Baptist, the first coming.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Just go back and look at, you know, he's
[53:19] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[53:21] Like I said, the days of Noah, eight
[53:24] went into the ark.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the days of Jesus, there
[53:29] was a dozen.
[53:31] And those that those that follow John
[53:33] the Baptist, a lot of them, even John
[53:35] the Baptist himself had to say, "Go and
[53:38] check. Is he the one?"
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Imagine.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you're living in this
[53:44] flesh.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Don't know. You know, you got to
[53:47] understand that this is your enemy.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; This doubts God. This is emnity with
[53:52] God.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; That's why it's a struggle for you to
[53:54] even get into the house of the Lord.
[53:56] People don't realize it's because their
[53:58] flesh is weak.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And and you know
[54:04] even getting into the house of the Lord
[54:06] is a great victory.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you
[54:11] &gt;&gt; people they say you know you you ask you
[54:13] know some people how often you go to
[54:15] church. Well we go to church on Sunday
[54:16] we go Wednesday we have prayer meeting
[54:18] on Friday night. What? Three times.
[54:22] Yeah.
[54:23] And then during the day we listen to the
[54:25] tapes. We read our Bible every day. We
[54:27] pray every day.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Because the life of
[54:32] God is in me.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; I've got THE LIFE OF GOD in me.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when the life of God
[54:40] comes in you, it it just automatically,
[54:43] you know, you you you feed on the word
[54:46] of God because the the word is your is
[54:48] your bread of life.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; It's the only thing that sustains you.
[54:53] Just try it. when you get depressed,
[54:55] when you get, you know, you know, into a
[54:57] state of, you know, where the enemy
[54:59] attacks you and all the cares of this
[55:01] life, just go start reading the word,
[55:04] listen to a message, get into the house
[55:06] of the Lord. Amen. And all of a sudden,
[55:10] you start to feed on the word of God,
[55:13] and what you eat, you start to become.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; You feed that life that's in you. Amen.
[55:20] You know it it blessed is he that
[55:23] thirsts and hungers
[55:25] &gt;&gt; after righteousness for he shall be
[55:27] filled and there's only one
[55:28] righteousness that's the word of God.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So while we're in this you
[55:35] know this
[55:37] time of silence because you know for us
[55:42] we're a small group. It's like, you
[55:46] know,
[55:47] few of us go to church and, you know, we
[55:50] we we we dedicate our lives to the Lord,
[55:53] but in the midst of all this silence,
[55:56] God is doing something wonderful.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; He's uniting personally with each and
[56:02] every individual.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[56:07] So when we look at this, we can look at
[56:11] the next slide.
[56:14] facts about the rapture. It's the next
[56:17] greatest event
[56:19] for the church. It will shock many who
[56:22] believe they were Christians.
[56:26] Broken Sisters 1964, he says, "But when
[56:29] he comes this time, hardly none, but
[56:33] those who are ready will know when he
[56:36] comes."
[56:41] You think this is just a regular
[56:42] Wednesday night service,
[56:45] but we're being reminded that the
[56:47] rapture is in progress now.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's going to be some that are
[56:52] going though th that's us.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; He says hardly none, but those who are
[56:57] ready will know when he comes.
[57:01] He's already come. We know that he's in
[57:03] our midst. Amen.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; We're feeding on the word for this hour.
[57:07] It's changing us. It's giving us
[57:10] victory. Glory to God. There'll just be
[57:12] an absence of people. They won't know
[57:15] what happened to them. They'll just be
[57:18] caught away in a moment. They'll just
[57:20] come up missing.
[57:22] I'll tell you, we talk about it every
[57:24] now and then, my wife and I. You know,
[57:26] we we talk about, you know, well, man,
[57:27] when that morning, you know, happens and
[57:30] that day happens and we're changed in a
[57:33] moment, in the twinkling of an eye, and
[57:34] all these people that we've, you know,
[57:36] that we've met, that we've talked to,
[57:38] that we've told them about, you know,
[57:40] Christ and we've told them about serving
[57:43] God, we've told them about the rapture,
[57:45] even our family, even our children. I
[57:48] don't know. You know, listen, God,
[57:50] listen. I believe with all my heart that
[57:53] my children
[57:55] are coming.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart. But
[58:02] they're going to need to receive him.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that.
[58:09] In his time,
[58:11] all things are possible.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, I'm not going to I'm not
[58:16] going to tell the Lord what to do. If
[58:18] your children are in the rapture, they
[58:22] were in it before the foundations of the
[58:24] world.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; You can't change it. I can't change it.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; But I believe with all my heart
[58:33] that they're there.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God's going to interpret it.
[58:38] Amen. But even still, there's going to
[58:42] be those that are going to be left
[58:43] behind when this rapture happens. You're
[58:46] going to disappear. They're going to be
[58:48] calling you. Hey, did you hear from so
[58:50] and so? Hey, I've been trying to get a
[58:52] hold of so and so, you know, for a week,
[58:54] two weeks. Then they'll hear in the news
[58:56] maybe a little article about, you know,
[58:59] many have gone missing in churches
[59:02] around
[59:03] the earth. You know, they're small
[59:06] churches. They're not big churches.
[59:08] They're not in, you know, the big
[59:09] denominational churches because you
[59:12] cannot denominate Christ.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Christ is a mystical body, a
[59:21] living body. Amen. Glory to God. The
[59:25] body of Christ is made up of many
[59:28] members, sons and daughters of God.
[59:32] Amen. When that's why when we say uh you
[59:35] know are you a Christian? You ask are
[59:38] you a Christian? They say well I'm a
[59:40] Baptist. Well I'm a Methodist. Well I'm
[59:42] a Catholic. No no no I didn't ask you
[59:45] that. I asked if you were a Christian. A
[59:47] Christian is one like Christ.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; One that's Christlike. One that has the
[59:53] same spirit of Christ in them. Amen.
[59:57] Praise God. They'll just come up missing
[59:59] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:00:01] an eye. So, just be ready for that.
[1:00:04] It'll be horrible some morning to miss a
[1:00:06] loved one. No one can find them. Won't
[1:00:09] it be too bad to know it's done past and
[1:00:12] you missed it? So, just keep before God.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. The rapture is in progress.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Next slide. It will be a sudden catching
[1:00:27] away. God hiding himself in simplicity.
[1:00:31] He says, "The time is at hand, church.
[1:00:34] The time is at hand. Don't wait any
[1:00:37] longer." See, how do you know the
[1:00:40] rapture's not going on all the time? How
[1:00:44] do you know the rapture is not It is
[1:00:46] going on. It is in progress. here.
[1:00:49] Brother Brandon, back in 1963,
[1:00:53] he had this revelation that was coming
[1:00:55] on him that the rapture was imminent,
[1:00:58] that the rapture was in progress, that
[1:01:00] that there was there was a great event
[1:01:03] that was that was just about to take
[1:01:05] place. Amen. Because the there the
[1:01:09] rapture could not be produced
[1:01:12] without the opening of those seven
[1:01:15] seals.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. The rapture comes as a
[1:01:19] result of the opening of those seven
[1:01:22] seals. Amen. Because it brought Christ
[1:01:27] to the earth
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; to unite with man. Amen. It's going to
[1:01:31] be a supernatural
[1:01:33] event.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So here, first thing you
[1:01:37] know, it'll be passed one disappearing
[1:01:40] here and there. It'll be gone the first
[1:01:43] thing you know. and your judgment will
[1:01:46] and and you'll judgement will strike the
[1:01:48] world. You say, "Well, I thought this.
[1:01:51] It's too late now." You remember they
[1:01:54] didn't know it until the day they
[1:01:56] entered into the ark.
[1:01:59] And then it was too late.
[1:02:03] The foolish virgin didn't know until she
[1:02:06] come back and found the wise virgins
[1:02:10] gone.
[1:02:12] Oh my. Then she was left for the
[1:02:15] tribulation period.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. There's a wise and a
[1:02:20] foolish virgin.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. People think that the foolish
[1:02:25] virgin is all the denominations out
[1:02:27] there.
[1:02:30] They're not even close.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Because a virgin is somebody that's
[1:02:36] a virgin.
[1:02:37] They've they've not been with anybody
[1:02:39] else. They believe that they have given
[1:02:42] their life completely over to Christ.
[1:02:46] Amen.
[1:02:48] But there's a wise virgin and there's a
[1:02:51] foolish virgin.
[1:02:55] Number three, there shall be no second
[1:02:58] version or repeat performance of this
[1:03:01] event.
[1:03:03] Interesting.
[1:03:05] The rapture is only going to happen
[1:03:07] once.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. for you and me in this hour. Glory
[1:03:13] to God. When the proclamation went out,
[1:03:16] the decree, the bridegroom's coming,
[1:03:18] everybody wanted to get right right
[1:03:21] quick. Like the foolish virgin, hey,
[1:03:23] they went right right away to the wise
[1:03:25] virgin says, "Hey, give me oil. Give me
[1:03:27] oil." You know, the bridegroom's call
[1:03:29] has gone forth.
[1:03:31] I'm telling you, the bridegroom call is
[1:03:34] now shouting in this message.
[1:03:38] And there's people that are coming to
[1:03:40] realize that they haven't got the oil.
[1:03:44] They're starting to panic. They're
[1:03:45] wondering, "Well, well, what's going on
[1:03:47] here? Why why is it that that that I'm
[1:03:50] not having victory in my life? Why is it
[1:03:53] that I'm more miserable than I am
[1:03:55] excited?
[1:03:57] Because the rapture, even the even the
[1:04:00] definition of the word rapture is
[1:04:02] extreme joy."
[1:04:04] Listen, you could be having trials.
[1:04:07] Everybody's got trials.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; You're going to have tests.
[1:04:12] But the word of God in you has already
[1:04:17] made a way.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; So, you should be the you should be the
[1:04:22] happiest person on earth. You should
[1:04:23] have an excitement. It's like one minute
[1:04:26] you're like, "Oh my gosh, this whole
[1:04:28] situation over here and this these the
[1:04:31] it's so frustrating." Then over here
[1:04:32] it's like glory, hallelujah, praise God.
[1:04:35] Thank you, Lord Jesus. I'M SO GLAD that
[1:04:37] I came into the house of the Lord
[1:04:38] tonight. You see, it's it's almost like
[1:04:40] you're you're schizophrenic.
[1:04:42] [laughter]
[1:04:45] Hallelujah. But it's it's it's that
[1:04:47] battle. It's that great battle that
[1:04:49] you've got to deal with in this
[1:04:51] dimension.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we but we've come to
[1:04:55] realize that that that the Lord himself
[1:04:58] has come in. Greater is he that is in me
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world. Amen.
[1:05:04] Glory to God. So, we've got this
[1:05:08] excitement in us. Amen. So, when the
[1:05:10] proclamation went out, the decree, the
[1:05:12] bridegroom's coming, everybody wanted to
[1:05:14] get right right quick. Ain't that the
[1:05:16] hour when the handwriting's on the wall?
[1:05:19] Oh, we want the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:21] Ghost. We want this, that, or the other.
[1:05:24] But while they went to buy, the
[1:05:26] bridegroom came. Amen. The wise went in
[1:05:30] and they were left outside where there
[1:05:32] was weeping, wailing and nashing of
[1:05:36] teeth. Saints, the bridegroom call is
[1:05:41] now shouting
[1:05:44] and in progress in the bride.
[1:05:47] She knows that the mighty angel
[1:05:52] under the leadership of the five-fold
[1:05:55] ministry
[1:05:57] is is the leadership of the five-fold
[1:05:59] ministry. That it's the mighty angel
[1:06:02] that's perfecting the bride through the
[1:06:06] five-fold ministry.
[1:06:08] She recognizes that the voice is now in
[1:06:12] the bride.
[1:06:14] She recognizes that. She realizes that
[1:06:18] that uh she has the oil.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; She's got the oil. She she knows where
[1:06:26] she's standing. Amen. Praise God.
[1:06:30] But go to the next slide. The vi the
[1:06:32] wise virgin shall be separated from the
[1:06:35] foolish virgins.
[1:06:38] That's what's going on right now.
[1:06:41] Not from the denominations.
[1:06:45] No, there's denomination now within the
[1:06:49] boundaries of this message.
[1:06:52] What is denomination?
[1:06:54] Is when man wants to take
[1:06:58] by his own hierarchy
[1:07:01] control over the people by by by putting
[1:07:05] his agenda, their political agenda,
[1:07:08] their organized agenda.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; That's what organized religion does.
[1:07:15] It started back in the days of of the
[1:07:17] Roman uh Senate when they had the
[1:07:21] emperor and then all of the different uh
[1:07:23] you know that's what that the whole
[1:07:25] political system all the world systems
[1:07:27] and the political systems are organized
[1:07:29] that way even companies publicly traded
[1:07:32] companies and most companies are
[1:07:33] organized and set up in that way.
[1:07:39] What is it?
[1:07:41] That organized system is what always put
[1:07:46] the head out which was Christ.
[1:07:52] And that's what's happening right now.
[1:07:53] There's a separation between the wise
[1:07:56] and the foolish virgins. Virgin means
[1:08:00] purity. They were all good people. Every
[1:08:03] one of them virgin sanctified vessels of
[1:08:06] God. But those who had oil in their
[1:08:09] lamps went in and the utters were left
[1:08:12] out.
[1:08:14] What is the oil?
[1:08:16] The Holy Ghost for this hour.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; People don't realize that the Holy Ghost
[1:08:23] for this hour was the coming of the
[1:08:27] Lord, the mighty angel coming down in
[1:08:30] 1963.
[1:08:33] They don't recognize that that is the
[1:08:36] oil.
[1:08:37] Not
[1:08:39] for a day gone by.
[1:08:43] For this hour, the Holy Ghost for this
[1:08:46] hour,
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; recognizing Christ in the present stage
[1:08:50] of his ministry.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; This is the rapture
[1:08:55] now in progress.
[1:08:57] They were all virgins. everyone people
[1:09:00] that you couldn't put your finger on for
[1:09:03] anything wrong. They everyone believed
[1:09:06] in the coming of the Lord. They were
[1:09:09] ready to go and meet him. But some of of
[1:09:12] them let their oil go out.
[1:09:15] They didn't realize that they got caught
[1:09:18] into some
[1:09:20] doctrine.
[1:09:22] They got pulled away by the teachings of
[1:09:24] man.
[1:09:26] They got drawn away.
[1:09:30] But there's a a shout in the land right
[1:09:33] now saying, "Come out of her, my
[1:09:35] people."
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Don't let
[1:09:39] that be your case. Keep oil in your
[1:09:41] lamp. Oil is the spirit, the Holy
[1:09:44] Spirit. Never let it drain from you.
[1:09:47] When you feel your love dying away, your
[1:09:49] sincerity to Christ and and to the to
[1:09:52] the cause, quickly go to him who has the
[1:09:55] fountain of oil and buy for yourself a
[1:09:58] filling of the Holy Spirit. Amen. You
[1:10:01] know, like we were talking about on
[1:10:03] Sunday, God gave you free moral agency.
[1:10:07] God gave you your own ability to choose.
[1:10:12] There is a will which is the will of
[1:10:15] God. Amen.
[1:10:17] There's that will of God that's that
[1:10:19] that that that that's in you to to will
[1:10:22] and to do what what he desires, but you
[1:10:26] have to surrender to it.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Too many people are are letting the the
[1:10:31] the the cares of this world and the
[1:10:33] pulls of this dimension pull them away
[1:10:37] from their regular attendance in church,
[1:10:39] from their regular prayer life, from
[1:10:42] their fellowship with the brethren.
[1:10:45] Amen.
[1:10:47] We know what we need to do. The bride
[1:10:50] knows what to do with the word
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; and that is to assemble ourselves to to
[1:10:55] fellowship to read the word to to commit
[1:10:59] our lives in prayer by by by dedication
[1:11:02] by by you know letting go of the things
[1:11:05] of this world. This is this is the hour
[1:11:08] where the rapture is is separating us.
[1:11:12] Amen. We've got to let go of those
[1:11:15] things that are that are so easily
[1:11:17] pulling us away.
[1:11:19] The little foxes that spoil the vine.
[1:11:22] Amen. Praise God.
[1:11:32] Amen. Now, she's not the bride, but it's
[1:11:35] the church, the pure people that didn't
[1:11:39] have the opportunity maybe to receive
[1:11:41] the message
[1:11:43] or in some way that they were blinded.
[1:11:48] Are you on number five? Sorry, go to
[1:11:51] number five. The foolish virgin rejects
[1:11:53] the message of their day. The first
[1:11:55] thing was that the sleeping virgins had
[1:11:58] to go through the tribulation period for
[1:12:00] purification.
[1:12:02] She had to be purged of her sins of
[1:12:04] unbelief and rejecting the message.
[1:12:06] That's what happens to the foolish
[1:12:09] virgin.
[1:12:11] We need to understand,
[1:12:13] you know, what's
[1:12:15] what the rapture is going to produce.
[1:12:18] There's a wise and there's a foolish.
[1:12:20] Well, now we know exactly where the
[1:12:22] foolish virgin goes. They go into the
[1:12:24] tribulation. They were virgins. Now,
[1:12:27] she's not the bride, but it's the
[1:12:29] church, the pure people that didn't have
[1:12:32] the opportunity maybe to receive the
[1:12:34] message or in some way that they were
[1:12:37] blinded by these false prophets and they
[1:12:41] didn't get a chance and yet they're
[1:12:43] really sincere in heart and God knows
[1:12:46] their heart and here they're purged
[1:12:49] during this time. So, there's going to
[1:12:51] be a lot of people. That's why don't,
[1:12:53] you know, there's people that are going
[1:12:56] to be saved
[1:12:59] going through the tribulation.
[1:13:02] They're going to have to be purged of
[1:13:04] their unbelief because they didn't allow
[1:13:06] the word to purge them while they were
[1:13:12] able.
[1:13:15] It's a paradox, saints. You know, it's a
[1:13:18] paradox. But the attribute of God has to
[1:13:21] be there in order to recognize the word
[1:13:25] for the day
[1:13:27] because it's the word that purifies you,
[1:13:30] purges you of the unbelief
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; and the deception that's now in the land
[1:13:36] that it would be so deceiving that it
[1:13:37] would deceive even the very elect if it
[1:13:39] was possible.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. They didn't get a chance and yet
[1:13:45] they're really sincere in heart and God
[1:13:47] knows their heart. Amen. Let's go to the
[1:13:50] next slide as we we're going to close
[1:13:52] here.
[1:13:54] For the wise virgin, the rapture is now
[1:13:58] in progress. Amen. She recognizes her
[1:14:02] day and its message. Praise God. Luke
[1:14:06] 12:40, "Be ye therefore ready also, for
[1:14:09] the Son of Man cometh at an hour when
[1:14:13] you think not." Let the musicians come.
[1:14:16] Amen. Praise God. This is the hour of
[1:14:19] the son of man. And in closing, I want
[1:14:21] to read this quote here. 1964.
[1:14:26] See,
[1:14:28] it's the son of man. Jesus Christ will
[1:14:32] come down in human flesh among us.
[1:14:37] He's doing it right now.
[1:14:40] and will make his word so real that
[1:14:44] it'll unite the church and him as one,
[1:14:48] the bride.
[1:14:50] And then she'll go home to the wedding
[1:14:53] supper.
[1:14:54] Amen. Glory to God. She's already
[1:14:57] united.
[1:14:59] That's why I said the rapture is in
[1:15:01] progress now. We've already
[1:15:05] married Christ
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; by receiving his word.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:10] See, we go to the wedding supp we we go
[1:15:13] to the wedding supper, not the marriage.
[1:15:16] The rapture is going to the wedding
[1:15:18] supper. When the word here unites with
[1:15:21] the person and they too become one and
[1:15:25] then what and then what does it do then?
[1:15:29] It manifests the son of man again.
[1:15:33] Not the church theologians,
[1:15:36] the son of man. The word and the church
[1:15:40] becomes one.
[1:15:42] Whatever the son of man done, he was the
[1:15:46] word. The church does the same thing.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; You see the ministry of the son of man.
[1:15:56] It's Christ in you now.
[1:16:00] It's Christ dealing with your life now,
[1:16:04] changing you now, translating you now,
[1:16:08] doing doing a a great work in your life
[1:16:11] now, bringing out the character that you
[1:16:14] have need of in order to represent
[1:16:17] [music] him and to speak on his behalf.
[1:16:21] People need to recognize that that this
[1:16:24] is a a a honing [music] time
[1:16:28] that he's looking for a bride that is
[1:16:31] going to actually be him, his voice, his
[1:16:36] thoughts, his ways, his desires, [music]
[1:16:40] his love, his fellowship.
[1:16:44] Praise God. Amen. The rapture is in
[1:16:48] progress [music]
[1:16:50] now.
[1:16:52] Are you glad to be a part of it?
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Simple
[1:16:59] reminder
[1:17:01] of who we are and the hour that we're
[1:17:04] living in.
[1:17:06] God is just giving us a a refreshing to
[1:17:10] remind us, hey,
[1:17:12] you've received the right revelation.
[1:17:16] You're exactly where you're supposed to
[1:17:18] be,
[1:17:20] receiving the word for this day and for
[1:17:22] this hour.
[1:17:25] I'm ready to move, move on up to another
[1:17:29] dimension.
[1:17:32] I'm ready to change. Relocate to another
[1:17:35] location.
[1:17:38] There's nothing going to hold me here
[1:17:40] [music and singing] no more. I'm already
[1:17:43] out the door.

[1:17:58] forever. everything [singing] after a
[1:18:01] while just see Jesus say hey

[1:18:43] Oh yes. Cuz everything I need is [music]
[1:18:48] in order. Ready now to cross [singing]
[1:18:51] the border to a brand [music] new
[1:18:54] country, bright and fair.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; This is going to see a translation.
