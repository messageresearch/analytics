[16:22] how he saved me, how he raised me, how
[16:28] he filled me with the Holy Ghost, how he
[16:34] healed me to the other.

[48:00] We're rising up.
[48:03] We're rising up.
[48:07] There's a New Testament church is rising
[48:10] up.
[48:12] Oh, as we look out across the land, see
[48:17] God's mighty hand. The bride of Christ
[48:21] adorned in her wedding.
[48:25] Just like
[48:28] this current
[48:31] that turns
[48:33] world upside down
[48:37] [Music]
[48:46] is rising up.
[48:52] Rising up
[48:55] the new
[48:58] rising once again.
[49:01] [Music]
[49:04] Christ
[49:09] Church
[49:22] rising up. Amen.
[49:26] [Music]
[49:28] Glory be to God.
[49:31] Lord Jesus,
[49:33] we wanted to say thank you to you
[49:35] because if there is a New Testament
[49:38] church coming up, if because of your
[49:41] love, if because of your grace, if
[49:45] because of the work of the Holy Ghost
[49:48] inside of us. So we want to give you all
[49:51] the glory, all the praise belong to you,
[49:55] Jesus. Thank you for this moment. Bless
[49:58] your word. Bless the vessel that you're
[50:01] going to use this morning. I yield
[50:03] myself completed to you, Lord. Because
[50:07] those people around here, your children
[50:09] didn't come to hurt a man to come to
[50:13] hear from you, Lord.
[50:15] So put aside the men and let the Holy
[50:18] Ghost work around us.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Bless us this morning in the name of
[50:24] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[50:28] We're going to take Bible
[50:31] and Genesis 3.
[50:38] Genesis 3
[50:41] from verse 7 to 11.
[50:44] Amen.
[50:49] Genesis 3.
[50:52] Amen.
[50:56] And the eyes of them both were opened
[50:59] and they knew that they were naked and
[51:02] they sit live together and made
[51:05] themselves apron.
[51:08] And they heard the voice of the Lord God
[51:10] walking in the garden and the cool of
[51:12] the day. And Adam and his wife hid
[51:16] himself them themselves from the
[51:19] presence of the Lord God amount the tree
[51:22] of the garden. And the Lord God called
[51:25] unto Adam and say unto Adam, Where thou?
[51:29] And he said, I heard thy voice in the
[51:33] garden, and I was afraid because I was
[51:36] naked, and I hid myself.
[51:40] And he said, Who told thee that thou was
[51:44] naked?
[51:46] Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof
[51:49] commanded thee that thou should
[51:52] shouldn't not eat?
[51:55] We will ask the Holy Ghost to bless the
[51:59] reading of his word. In the name of
[52:01] Jesus, you can be seated. Amen.
[52:06] Before I start, I wanted to say thank
[52:09] you to brother Danny.
[52:12] You know,
[52:14] from the first moment I meet this man,
[52:17] this man had a kindness
[52:22] that you don't see too often in other
[52:24] men.
[52:26] I wanted to thank Jesus Christ for the
[52:28] kindness the brother that had with me
[52:32] with my you with the people of God. I
[52:35] wanted to say thank you, brother Danny.
[52:38] Thank you for your love. Thank you for
[52:40] your patient. Amen.
[52:43] Thank you. I wanted to thank the whole
[52:45] team of brother Danny because I know
[52:48] this is a hard job to make it happen. So
[52:51] may the Lord richly bless you. Amen. And
[52:54] I wanted to thank Jesus Christ my Lord
[52:58] to give me this opportunity to talk to
[53:01] his family to his children this morning
[53:05] and to share Pope with my bro Kadix.
[53:10] It's a joy for me. Amen.
[53:14] I believe like last week we were
[53:16] together in Canada and Montreal and we
[53:19] were talking about those meeting. We say
[53:21] you know that we feel the Lord that
[53:24] something special is going to happen
[53:26] this weekend and it's already started
[53:29] last night and it's going to continue
[53:31] this morning and it's going to continue
[53:33] the whole weekend.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; So let's be under expectation. Amen.
[53:40] Thank you.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Now
[53:44] we can see that
[53:49] before they fell,
[53:51] Adam Allah and Eve
[53:54] used to live in a perfect relationship
[53:57] with God.
[54:01] And the key to that relationship was to
[54:06] remain on the word.
[54:10] The day you get out of the word, the day
[54:14] you die
[54:16] and brother Brandon say that we are in
[54:19] the same position.
[54:21] Those two tree is in front of us. Every
[54:24] morning we wake up, we have to choose to
[54:28] live by the word of God or to live by
[54:31] the other tree. And we all know what it
[54:33] is. So it was a condition, it was an
[54:36] agreement
[54:38] for the relationship to stay under
[54:41] perfect condition, a perfect harmony.
[54:44] They have to stay on the word of God.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; And my soldier this morning is, who told
[54:51] you that?
[54:58] And you know the prophet of God say
[55:02] that God never changed. He's still the
[55:04] same yesterday,
[55:06] today, and forever.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; And for the family of God to have a
[55:12] perfect harmony with God, they have to
[55:15] stay on the word
[55:17] &gt;&gt; is going to be the same thing for us.
[55:20] Because there's only one place where go
[55:23] where God can meet men
[55:25] &gt;&gt; is in Jesus Christ.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ is the word.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; So the word of God is the mechanic of
[55:33] the harmony of relationship with God.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; But there was another voice apart from
[55:41] God boys in the garden. And we all know
[55:44] that's the voice of the serpent.
[55:47] And when they identify themselves with
[55:51] the older boys, amen,
[55:54] the fellowship
[55:57] cut off.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; The life changed dra drastically.
[56:03] But you see they have to put aside God
[56:06] word first
[56:08] &gt;&gt; before they accept certain unbelief.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have a decision to make to
[56:15] break fellowship to break relationship
[56:17] with God.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; If we stay on the word, if we stay
[56:21] behind God,
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's our strength.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; If we remain behind God,
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Satan can do nothing.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; As long we can stay on the word, God's
[56:35] going to fight for us.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; God is going to be the head that keep
[56:39] captain,
[56:40] &gt;&gt; amen, of our life. how long we stand
[56:43] behind the word.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; And by staying behind the word, that's
[56:47] going to make a harmony, a relationship
[56:51] with God.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; And that's what we desire.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; That's what the the the the biggest
[56:56] desire that a Christian has is to be in
[56:59] harmony with God.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, that make it all for us.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; You know, when we do things that the
[57:06] Holy Ghost didn't like, we feel sad.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; We feel, you know, like condemned. We
[57:11] feel like we we we were about to die.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; But when we fix the the mistake and then
[57:18] we we have the relationship back with
[57:21] God, we are in joy.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; We are happy.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; We dance.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; We say amen.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; I think going to need
[57:33] your amen this morning. Amen.
[57:37] [Applause]
[57:39] So they used to be imperfection waiting
[57:42] on the Lord depending on the Lord. Amen.
[57:46] They they were bel by the holyness of
[57:49] the Holy Ghost. They couldn't see per
[57:52] perversion. They couldn't sing as long
[57:55] they stay behind the word.
[57:58] They were gods having control over
[58:02] creation. They said it like this. They
[58:05] were living in a kuna matata land.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Now you all laugh, huh?
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Now you all get it. What? What did that
[58:16] mean?
[58:17] &gt;&gt; It mean no worries.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; No worries.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; For the rest of their day
[58:23] &gt;&gt; as long they stay behind the word.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; It's the same is the same thing for us.
[58:31] We can live in a hakuna matata land and
[58:34] be in joy as long we stay behind the
[58:37] word.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will take care of everything.
[58:41] And he's so faithful. When we fail, he
[58:43] is still there
[58:45] &gt;&gt; to help us to come back.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; That's his redeeming love for us. Amen.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love God.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; But when they identify themselves with
[58:57] the other boys, they find themselves
[59:00] naked.
[59:02] religious,
[59:03] &gt;&gt; afraid,
[59:04] &gt;&gt; and condemned.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; And that when God come to the scene and
[59:09] ask them, "Who told you that
[59:12] &gt;&gt; that you were naked?"
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Who told you that you were naked?
[59:19] &gt;&gt; That mean you did something that I told
[59:21] you not to do.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; You open your heart to someone that I
[59:26] told you don't do it. And you know as a
[59:29] young people you heard father parents
[59:31] say don't do that don't do that don't do
[59:33] that and sometime we take it as a how
[59:36] how can I say as a reproach
[59:38] &gt;&gt; but it's not a reproach it to keep you
[59:41] safe young people the same love that God
[59:46] have for his children is the same love
[59:48] that us parent have for you now
[59:51] &gt;&gt; and one day you're going to be in their
[59:53] side
[59:55] &gt;&gt; feeling the same thing that we feel when
[59:57] we tell you not to do things.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; But it's one working
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; for you to make mistake, for you to go h
[1:00:10] against
[1:00:12] the commandment of God. And we know that
[1:00:15] exciting.
[1:00:18] But listen, just by open their heart
[1:00:21] to the other boys is the only two boys.
[1:00:25] God boys, Satan boys.
[1:00:29] Just by open their heart to the other
[1:00:32] boys that break the relationship.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; I want you to get it.
[1:00:39] They were in harmony in perfect harmony.
[1:00:42] But as long they accept it, as long they
[1:00:46] identify themsel with the other boys,
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; that break the harmony.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes 10
[1:00:58] verse 12 and 13
[1:01:00] the word of God say
[1:01:03] the word of a wise man and we know who
[1:01:06] is the wise man is God Jesus Christ
[1:01:09] mount are gratches. Amen. But the leaf
[1:01:12] of a fool will swallow up himself.
[1:01:17] The beginning of the word of his mouth
[1:01:20] is foolishness
[1:01:22] and the end of his talk is misuous
[1:01:25] madness.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; It's clear.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; It's clear
[1:01:32] the voice of God is grace. Grace.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; And what is grace in us? Is love
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; and faithfulness.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Grace is love and faithfulness.
[1:01:52] From us to God.
[1:01:59] That's why I always tell my young people
[1:02:01] before
[1:02:03] you starting to discard about doctrine
[1:02:06] and all of those stuff, God get grace
[1:02:09] before.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Oh boy. Amen. That's true.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Because if you're starting to to get
[1:02:14] into doctrine, oh my, you're going to
[1:02:17] have a full package of law.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; You need grace.
[1:02:24] You need Jesus.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; You need Jesus.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; You need Jesus.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; I love the message last night that that
[1:02:34] that that the Holy Ghost want to clean
[1:02:36] your heart
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; to put Jesus in front.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz my preaching is just the
[1:02:41] continuation of that.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; God put us in the good position last
[1:02:47] night so we can move forward this
[1:02:49] morning. Oh my.
[1:02:52] Oh my.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; So the voice of God is a voice of grace.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; The only the only uh let let me say it
[1:03:01] like that. The only
[1:03:04] way to save this world is Jesus Christ.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; What we have to accept the love and
[1:03:12] faith and we have to accept the grace
[1:03:14] and that will transform love and
[1:03:16] faithfulness and faithfulness for God.
[1:03:19] Amen. But if you said the other one is a
[1:03:23] foolishness.
[1:03:27] I want you to get it young people
[1:03:29] because sometime Satan come inside of us
[1:03:33] giving us idea and we think that we are
[1:03:37] smart
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; and that's part of of it making mistake
[1:03:44] because by those mistake you're going to
[1:03:46] learn how to serve God. Amen.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; So nobody have to feel condemned now
[1:03:52] about it because there is grace in this
[1:03:54] place.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:03:59] so we need to be careful to who we open
[1:04:02] our heart to
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; because every word is a seed.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't matter if it come from
[1:04:13] God or if it come from Satan. As long
[1:04:16] you identify yourself with that seed, it
[1:04:20] will produce in your life whatever is in
[1:04:23] that seed.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; It's not that that because you have the
[1:04:30] Holy Ghost, you you you like like
[1:04:33] automatically you're going to block
[1:04:35] Satan. No, no, no, no. If you are set,
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; It will materialize in your life.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; So, we need to be careful.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; It will come a reality in our life. It
[1:04:50] doesn't matter from where it come from.
[1:04:51] It come from God or if come from Satan.
[1:04:55] Now I remember when I have when I was
[1:04:59] 14 years old. I didn't have the Holy
[1:05:02] Ghost at that time.
[1:05:06] But I love God. I love to go to church.
[1:05:10] You know,
[1:05:12] I had a good connection with God. I just
[1:05:15] love to go to church to sing to be there
[1:05:20] to be a part of the church. No, I was
[1:05:23] only 14 years old.
[1:05:26] But someone in my family got yellows
[1:05:33] and then I remember one Saturday
[1:05:35] morning, it was a reading day. He come
[1:05:37] to me and told me, "Oh, you think you're
[1:05:40] special?
[1:05:43] Oh, you think just because you go to
[1:05:45] church, you're this, you're that. And he
[1:05:49] start telling me so many things, bad
[1:05:53] things to break my relationship with
[1:05:57] God.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; And I made the mistake to open
[1:06:04] my heart to those seed.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; And you know what happened?
[1:06:11] Does seed become a reality in my life? I
[1:06:16] started to go to church now. I started
[1:06:19] to be cold,
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; warm,
[1:06:23] starchy,
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; not singing anymore.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:06:30] And when father, you know what happened?
[1:06:33] I quit church.
[1:06:37] But I want you to understand
[1:06:40] I have to accept that to break the
[1:06:43] harmony that I have with God.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; It's always the same pattern.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Same pattern, brother.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't change.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; But you don't have to go.
[1:07:05] in the same trial
[1:07:08] that I went through.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Because you see, at that time, I was
[1:07:12] only 13, 14 years old.
[1:07:15] I didn't have the Holy Ghost. I didn't
[1:07:18] have someone over me watching me on my
[1:07:20] spiritual life like you young guys have
[1:07:23] now. I didn't have all of that.
[1:07:28] But this morning,
[1:07:31] the Holy Ghost is right here. Amen.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; And he he can ask you,
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; "Who told you that?"
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; If you feel warm this morning,
[1:07:44] who told you that?
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; That wasn't me.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; If you feel sick this morning, who told
[1:07:54] you that?
[1:07:55] [Music]
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; What seed did you believe?
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Because there is no sickness in God.
[1:08:03] No. And God is only healing.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; So if this morning you feel sad, who
[1:08:15] told you that?
[1:08:18] [Music]
[1:08:18] [Applause]
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Who told you that?
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; It because you take you identify
[1:08:26] yourself
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; with the enemy.
[1:08:30] We're supposed to be enjoying dancing,
[1:08:34] shouting the Lord.
[1:08:36] Amen. Right now, because he's here, we
[1:08:41] are here to manifest God, to glorify
[1:08:44] God.
[1:08:46] But if you sitting, you share, you're
[1:08:48] sad, you're sick, who call you that?
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Cuz that ain't God.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Sickness doesn't come from God.
[1:08:59] Sadness doesn't come from God.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Come church.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Being warm,
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; being cold,
[1:09:17] not saying amen. Come on, bro. I need
[1:09:19] that.
[1:09:24] big a bigger one
[1:09:26] [Applause]
[1:09:33] starting to come in church. You know
[1:09:35] there was a time that we were in joy.
[1:09:37] Yeah. Let's go to church. Let's sing.
[1:09:38] Let's do this.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; But suddenly
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; you become warm,
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; cold, touching.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Who told you that? Amen.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Because in the presence of God

[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; so he can establish himself
[1:12:33] to make us he living word
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; you see the whole problem with God is to
[1:12:41] manifest himself
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; among us
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; that's main God.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:12:51] sing song, leading everything that you
[1:12:54] can do for God and that if that word

[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Somebody is telling you so a lie
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; because the end the the the the goal of
[1:13:09] God is to manifest himself
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; through us. Amen.
[1:13:15] In Romans 12,
[1:13:18] my my
[1:13:19] verse one the Bible say,
[1:13:24] "Therefore I urge you brothers and
[1:13:27] sister and beauty of God mercy
[1:13:31] to offer your bodies as a living
[1:13:34] sacrifice,
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; holy and pleasing

[1:13:54] clean heart
[1:14:00] and yield yourself

[1:14:11] That's right. Come on now.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; That's the

[1:14:24] That's the pleasant team to God. God is
[1:14:28] going to be pleased.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Please.
[1:14:34] And us if we doing that,
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; if we come to his present without a
[1:14:40] condition
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; without a a a plan B,
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Well, if it doesn't work today, it's
[1:14:48] going to work tonight. If it don't,
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; no, no. God want us to hear ourself
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; completed
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; from top to the bottom. Amen.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Everything surrender
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; to God.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[1:15:13] you know,
[1:15:16] young people,
[1:15:18] it is time.
[1:15:21] I've been watching you for years and
[1:15:23] years,
[1:15:24] but it's time to come to the presence of
[1:15:27] the Lord
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; without nothing matter.
[1:15:31] I don't care who beside me.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; I just come
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; to yield myself to the Lord.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; what other people say
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; because when you when that matter to
[1:15:45] you, that mean you have a open channel
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; to listen what the other guy have to
[1:15:50] say.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; God want you to close that channel. Come
[1:15:55] to his presence and y yourself completed
[1:15:59] to him.
[1:16:01] We can do that. Young people, you know,
[1:16:03] just forget about everything.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; You want to shout, you shout, you want
[1:16:07] to say amen, you say amen.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. This is a party.
[1:16:14] This is a party. You don't go to a party
[1:16:16] and then you you say on the like that.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1:16:23] no, no, no, no, no. When I used to go to
[1:16:26] the party from the beginning to the end,
[1:16:28] I was dancing.
[1:16:30] But not for death, not for the devil.
[1:16:33] Now that I am for Christ, when I come to
[1:16:36] his church, I said
[1:16:39] from the beginning to the end
[1:16:43] because he become my reality. Now he
[1:16:46] become my leader. Now he become
[1:16:50] everything. Nothing else.
[1:16:54] Only Jesus. Only Jesus. We are here for
[1:16:58] Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.
[1:17:02] I don't care how I dress. I don't care
[1:17:05] how you look. I just come here to praise
[1:17:09] my God.
[1:17:11] Amen.
[1:17:13] Amen.
[1:17:15] Amen.
[1:17:17] It is time for us. But nothing else
[1:17:20] matter on the side of Jesus.
[1:17:23] He's the one that paid the price.
[1:17:26] He is the one that give us joy. He is
[1:17:29] the one that save our soul.
[1:17:32] All the glory belong to him. Let's close
[1:17:36] that channel.
[1:17:38] But here we have the chance to tell you
[1:17:40] something.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Because we are the word.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; We live by the word.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; You are the spreading word of the hour.
[1:17:54] Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; If Jesus was 76 years old sitting in the
[1:18:00] chair this morning, he will be saying
[1:18:07] [Applause]
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; he was 12 years old
[1:18:13] and he went to church and every time the
[1:18:17] priest say something about the word he
[1:18:19] say
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:18:23] He wasn't sitting there just looking.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; There was something that Jesus was doing
[1:18:28] this that got the attraction of those
[1:18:32] priests.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; So if you want to catch the attraction
[1:18:38] of the Holy Ghost, let's say
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; oh my
[1:18:44] [Applause]
[1:18:47] hallelujah.
[1:18:49] This is your true
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; and proper worship.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; See
[1:18:56] we when we worship normally we sing, we
[1:19:00] dance, we shout.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; But a real proper worship is a real
[1:19:09] relationship
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; with God. Amen.
[1:19:14] [Music]
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Let's make it clear,
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; okay?
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; You can shout, you can dance,
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; you can say
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; But if you don't have that connection
[1:19:26] with God,
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; they say you to make a
[1:19:32] something I don't know how to say it,
[1:19:35] but you know your
[1:19:39] worship is not complete.
[1:19:43] It have to be complete
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; your whole being
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; yielded to Christ.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; A real relationship to the Lord is
[1:19:56] living in harmony in Christ Jesus.
[1:20:00] Listen,
[1:20:02] but remember
[1:20:06] soon as you identify yourself with Satan
[1:20:09] boys, it will cut your relationship.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Why I'm coming back to that? Because we
[1:20:18] can see
[1:20:19] today Satan have so many tools
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; to grab to to attract you attraction
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; and put your focus on the thing of the
[1:20:31] word
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; and evil things
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; that is not necessary.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; You can pass three, four, five hour in
[1:20:39] the cell phone
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; or watching something on YouTube.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:20:45] is Satan calling you e you worship to to
[1:20:49] the Lord.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; The real worship. The real worship is a
[1:20:55] real relationship with God.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Don't forget that.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; It's more than singing.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; It's more than shouting.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; It's a harmony.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Everything goes together.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:21:20] He said, "Do not conform to the pattern
[1:21:24] of the word."
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Young people, you will never fix
[1:21:30] yourself on the word.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; You're going to feel bad. You're going
[1:21:37] to feel in the bad moment movement.
[1:21:40] You're going to feel all the all kind of
[1:21:43] way, but you won't feel good.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there is a seed inside of
[1:21:49] you.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Crying
[1:21:53] aba father
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; crying.
[1:21:57] I want worship.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; I want the real worship. That mean I
[1:22:02] want the real relationship with God.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; The seed inside of you is a problem.
[1:22:10] to worship God
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:22:20] your mind.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; He was saying last night reading the
[1:22:24] prophet that Satan take control of your
[1:22:27] mind.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; But God take control of your heart.
[1:22:35] If God can have the fullness of your
[1:22:38] heart, your mind will become Christ
[1:22:41] mind.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; So don't try the fight thought by
[1:22:47] thought. No no no no. Surrender yourself
[1:22:50] to Christ
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Ghost will fight.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; You know there is things like 10 years
[1:22:59] ago I used to discuss.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Mhm. Today
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; many of those thing I don't cause them
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; because they have no sense
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; and you know as sons of God we have to
[1:23:12] be to come to to a place where there are
[1:23:16] things that we don't have to discuss
[1:23:18] with the enemy.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; We have just to let that cause he left
[1:23:22] off. That's why that's why the the the
[1:23:25] word of God is a how do you say
[1:23:30] it's a sword
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; anytime that come
[1:23:39] it off cut it off cut it off
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; because you have taste
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; the better is the better was and the
[1:23:49] better that will be
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; nothing will be better than Jesus Jesus.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; When you taste Jesus,
[1:23:59] nothing else will never have that taste.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; So why us like as young people want to
[1:24:08] spend our time with those things? Just
[1:24:11] cut it off.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Just cut it off.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost doesn't come to to
[1:24:16] come to you and ask you, "Who told you
[1:24:18] that?
[1:24:20] [Applause]
[1:24:28] He say
[1:24:31] then you will be able to test and
[1:24:35] approve that what God will is his good
[1:24:42] pleasing and perfect will.
[1:24:46] So let's say it like this. More of God
[1:24:49] we have,
[1:24:51] more discernment we have.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; More discernment we have,
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; more able more we are able to
[1:25:02] approve what is good, acceptable and
[1:25:05] perfect.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And more discernment that we have
[1:25:09] on the will of God, less chance
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; the devil has against us
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; to break the relationship.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; So what do we need young people? We
[1:25:24] already have Christ.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; What do we need now? is is to surrender
[1:25:30] ourself y ourself to Christ for him to
[1:25:33] full of to us of his holy ghost or his
[1:25:37] word
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; because he is the chip captain and our
[1:25:41] soul to defeat the enemy
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; the enemy can't fight you because you
[1:25:48] you are trying to do it by yourself
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; let me ask you a question let make it
[1:25:54] clear
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; do you think Satan fight God.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on now.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; You know, I heard so many Christian
[1:26:06] said, "Oh, I'm fighting the devil. I'm
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; preaching.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Good luck.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; You're fighting the devil."
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; They don't say, "I'm fighting a bad
[1:26:22] angel or a evil angel." No, I'm fighting
[1:26:26] the dead. Good luck.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; There is only one
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; that can defeat the enemy like that.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:46] So more of God,
[1:26:48] more of the message,
[1:26:52] more of the revelation of the message
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; you have on your heart,
[1:27:00] more you're going to close the door to
[1:27:02] the enemy.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; To don't let him the space to tell you
[1:27:09] something. Yeah.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; More of God you have,
[1:27:14] the least space
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; the Satan will have
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; against you.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:27:24] it's like,
[1:27:26] but this just went to my house last week
[1:27:30] and you know, we were eating.
[1:27:33] Say, bro, it's hard to have a
[1:27:37] I have a diet here. Cuz
[1:27:41] you know we eat, we drink, you know. And
[1:27:44] what would I want to say?
[1:27:47] If you hungry and then you eat, you
[1:27:51] fool. And then 3 minutes ago
[1:27:55] someone come to tell you you want to eat
[1:27:57] something,
[1:27:59] you will say no,
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; I'm full.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; I'm satisfied.
[1:28:09] Come on,
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; preach it.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; You know there is a lot of people on the
[1:28:14] message they say, "Oh, we need more to
[1:28:16] go to church. We need more day with."
[1:28:18] What we need is the relationship. What
[1:28:21] we need is more revelation of the hour.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; What we need is to come to church with a
[1:28:28] positive attitude.
[1:28:31] The prophet of God said the only thing
[1:28:33] that God need is a positive attitude.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; He will do the rest.
[1:28:40] [Applause]
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Come
[1:28:45] come to church
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; to have church to say amen to the word.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; That's that's what we need people.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; But we have people, you know, sitting on
[1:28:55] the bed for 20, 30, 40, 50 years. the
[1:28:59] same people in the same chair
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; and they they the same church
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; with the same fist filter.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; That's why brother D was say something
[1:29:15] so important last night. Us as parent we
[1:29:19] need to connect
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; we are our children's
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; we are our young people
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; because by connecting by having
[1:29:30] relationship with them we can help them
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; but if we stand behind just criticize
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; who told you
[1:29:39] come on
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; I praise the Holy Ghost next time you're
[1:29:45] going to criticize someone in church.
[1:29:48] The Holy Ghost come in your mind and
[1:29:50] tell you who told you.
[1:29:53] [Music]
[1:29:54] [Applause]
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; That doesn't come from God.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Anything that you are say that doesn't
[1:30:05] come to from God, the Holy Ghost will
[1:30:08] ask you the same question.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Who told you that?
[1:30:14] We need to come to church ready to

[1:34:54] It's like, you know, when people use
[1:34:56] tango, you know, they go in the same
[1:34:58] movement.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is a savior.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is a healer.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; We are dancing with the spirit.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; That's about it. There's a bad about
[1:35:15] having church.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; It's not only to teach you some
[1:35:20] doctrine.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; it's to have fellowship, to have
[1:35:25] relationship with God, you know.
[1:35:34] My my
[1:35:39] the prophet of God said the basis of
[1:35:41] fellowship
[1:35:43] and that what was the matter with the
[1:35:45] church today they got a chain face if
[1:35:49] you can catch my parable they don't want
[1:35:51] that relationship with God they rather
[1:35:54] have some stall former starchy
[1:35:57] organization say I am preisterian I am
[1:36:01] mystery I am this I am
[1:36:04] As long you belong to something,
[1:36:07] somebody begott you.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; If you belong to something outside of
[1:36:14] Jesus Christ,
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; you just deceive as Eve was.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; We don't believe to a church.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; We believe we belong to Jesus Christ.
[1:36:33] And by belonging to Jesus Christ, we are
[1:36:36] a part of the church.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Oh man,

[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; You can see young people now they have
[1:36:54] the Bible on the cell phone.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; I don't have nothing against that.
[1:37:02] But let me see. Let me ask you a
[1:37:04] question. When you go to church, when
[1:37:07] you go to park to play football, do you
[1:37:10] have your football ball on yourself?
[1:37:15] [Applause]
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Okay, now let's play.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Take the ball out of yourself.
[1:37:34] Who told you those things?
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Who told you the switch
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; or your Bible?
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Be proud
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; of your Bible.

[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; You know, they can pass three, four hour
[1:37:54] reading a romantic book. Amen.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; You can ask them, "What was the last
[1:38:02] time that you read a message book?"
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Who told you that?
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Who told you to switch it?
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; That wasn't the Holy Ghost.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:26] This message young people don't come to
[1:38:29] make us a new organization.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; This message come to bring us back
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; to the real joy
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; of the word of God
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; to the real Pentecost
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; where people were tiding you know they
[1:38:47] were so excited they were they were
[1:38:49] speaking in another tongue.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:55] But we got so used to that we speak in
[1:38:58] another tongue but not with the Holy
[1:39:00] Ghost.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; You know we come a church and we talk
[1:39:03] this language.
[1:39:04] [Music]
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; You preaching in another tongue
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; but not by the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:16] This message come to bring us back to
[1:39:20] reality.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Not the church prediction.
[1:39:26] We don't want the church tradition.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; We don't want religion. God want
[1:39:32] relationship.
[1:39:34] God want you guys to come and be free to
[1:39:37] shout, to sing, to glorify his name.

[1:39:44] worried. You don't have to feel sad. You
[1:39:46] don't have to feel depressed. Who told
[1:39:48] you that?
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is telling you who told
[1:39:52] you that he want you to be in joy, to be

[1:40:09] throne

[1:52:57] How you put more than a song
[1:53:01] for a song in itself is not what you
[1:53:06] have required.
[1:53:11] You search much deeper within
[1:53:16] through the way things have been. You're
[1:53:19] looking into my heart.
[1:53:23] [Music]
[1:53:26] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[1:53:33] It's all about you.
[1:53:37] It's all about you, Jesus.
[1:53:41] I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've
[1:53:46] made.
[1:53:48] But it's all about you.
[1:53:52] It's all about you, Jesus.
[1:53:57] King of endless world.
[1:54:01] No one can express
[1:54:04] how much you deserve.
[1:54:11] Though I'm weak and poor,
[1:54:16] all I have is yours.
[1:54:19] Every single praise
[1:54:23] I'll bring you more.
[1:54:25] I'll bring you more than the song.
[1:54:30] For a song in this is not what you have
[1:54:35] required.
[1:54:40] You search much deeper within
[1:54:44] through the waiting.
[1:54:47] You're looking into my heart.
[1:54:55] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[1:55:01] It's all about you.
[1:55:05] It's all about you, Jesus.
[1:55:09] I'm sorry, Lord, for
[1:55:12] [Music]
[1:55:16] it's all about you.
[1:55:19] It's all about you, Jesus.
[1:55:25] It's all about you.
[1:55:28] It's all about you.
[1:55:34] It's all about you, Jesus.
[1:55:38] I'm coming back to heart of worship.
[1:55:45] It's all about you.
[1:55:49] It's all about you, Jesus.
[1:55:53] I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I made.
[1:56:00] It's all about me.
[1:56:08] Oh yes.
[1:56:11] Now and hold
[1:56:14] me close.
[1:56:17] Let your love surround
[1:56:22] me.
[1:56:24] Bring me.
[1:56:26] Bring
[1:56:29] me near.
[1:56:32] Draw me to your side.
[1:56:38] [Music]
[1:56:44] I win. I'll rise up like an eagle.
[1:56:53] And now with you, your spirit leads me
[1:57:01] by the power of your love.
[1:57:04] [Applause]
[1:57:08] Lord, I come to you.
[1:57:12] Let my heart be changed.
[1:57:20] Flowing from the grace
[1:57:24] that I found
[1:57:27] in
[1:57:28] you.
[1:57:29] [Music]
[1:57:36] Lord, I've come to know
[1:57:41] the weaknesses I see
[1:57:45] in me
[1:57:48] will be stripped away
[1:57:54] by the power of your love.
[1:58:04] Yes.
[1:58:07] Be close.
[1:58:10] Let your love surround
[1:58:15] me.
[1:58:18] Bring
[1:58:20] me
[1:58:22] [Music]
[1:58:24] draw me to your side.
[1:58:30] [Music]
[1:58:36] I win.
[1:58:38] I rock them like an eagle
[1:58:41] [Applause]
[1:58:45] and I will sore with you.
[1:58:49] Your spirit leads me
[1:58:52] by the power of your love.
[1:58:57] [Music]
[1:59:04] The food will not be ready for about 35
[1:59:07] to 40 minutes. So, we'll just sing more
[1:59:10] songs.
[1:59:11] [Music]
[1:59:13] Let's take and see.
[1:59:17] Lord,
[1:59:19] my heart
[1:59:21] is open.
[1:59:25] Don't you come
[1:59:29] inside.
[1:59:30] [Music]
[1:59:33] Fill
[1:59:34] upon
[1:59:36] my be

[1:59:40] ever
[1:59:42] to
[1:59:43] abide.

[1:59:47] I open
[1:59:49] all the windows
[1:59:54] and throw
[1:59:56] my
[1:59:58] me.
[2:00:02] Won't you come
[2:00:06] inside?
[2:00:09] I need you
[2:00:13] forever.
[2:00:14] Lord my heart
[2:00:17] Lord my heart is open.
[2:00:24] Won't you come inside?
[2:00:29] [Music]
[2:00:30] [Applause]
[2:00:32] Fill up all my be
[2:00:41] too.
[2:00:42] [Music]
[2:00:46] I open
[2:00:48] all the windows
[2:00:53] and throw wide every
[2:00:57] door.
[2:00:58] [Music]
[2:01:01] Won't you come inside?
[2:01:08] I need you.
[2:01:11] Now one last time. Oh Lord, my heart is
[2:01:19] open.
[2:01:22] Won't you come inside?
[2:01:30] Fill up all my being
[2:01:37] ever
[2:01:38] to
[2:01:40] abide.
[2:01:43] I open
[2:01:45] all the window
[2:01:50] and throw wide every
[2:01:54] door.
[2:01:57] [Music]
[2:01:58] Won't you come inside?
[2:02:03] [Music]
[2:02:13] Amen.
[2:02:16] The
[2:02:19] the more that I surrender,
[2:02:25] the lighter
[2:02:28] my love.
[2:02:32] The more that I
[2:02:35] release my case,
[2:02:38] the more you take control,
[2:02:42] [Music]
[2:02:44] the more that I can humble myself,
[2:02:51] the more you lift me up.
[2:02:57] Every day I live,
[2:03:01] Lord, I love you, Lord.
[2:03:10] Oh, the more that I surrender,
[2:03:18] the lighter
[2:03:20] my Lord.
[2:03:24] The more that I release my care,
[2:03:31] the more you take control.
[2:03:37] The more that I
[2:03:41] live for myself,
[2:03:44] the more you lift me up
[2:03:48] [Music]
[2:03:49] every day. I live,
[2:03:54] Lord. I love you.
[2:04:01] more that I surrender.
[2:04:07] The lighter
[2:04:10] my Lord,
[2:04:14] the more that I
[2:04:17] release my car,
[2:04:20] the more he takes control.
[2:04:25] [Music]
[2:04:27] The more that I can humble myself,
[2:04:33] the more you lose me.
[2:04:39] Every day that I live,
[2:04:44] Lord, I love you more.
[2:04:48] [Music]
[2:04:49] Amen. Praise God. You may be seated for
[2:04:51] a moment.
[2:04:53] You know, I was writing some notes and I
[2:04:56] thought, you know what? I was going to
[2:04:58] maybe share this this evening, but I
[2:05:01] thought we've got some time right now.
[2:05:03] We're in the presence of the Lord. We've
[2:05:06] just had a wonderful time. Let's just
[2:05:08] let's just uh stay and and maybe just,
[2:05:11] you know, pull a little bit more on the
[2:05:14] Holy Spirit and see what it is. And you
[2:05:16] know the thing that uh that's on my
[2:05:18] heart is last night we heard you know
[2:05:22] our brother diggs and he brought the
[2:05:24] scripture from the book of Ezekiel where
[2:05:27] he said that I will put I will I will
[2:05:30] give you a new heart.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; I will restore your heart. Amen. And he
[2:05:34] also said I will put my spirit in you.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice that he said I'll
[2:05:41] put my spirit in you. Now, you know, um
[2:05:46] I believe that, you know, there's a bit
[2:05:48] of confusion these days about, you know,
[2:05:51] receiving the Holy Ghost because people
[2:05:52] want to talk about, you know, well, I
[2:05:55] need to receive the Holy Ghost. But, you
[2:05:58] know, sometimes there's a a
[2:05:59] misconception
[2:06:01] on what the Holy Ghost actually is. And
[2:06:04] so I believe that, you know, you being
[2:06:07] here this weekend and as we go into the
[2:06:09] service this evening, uh, you know, I
[2:06:12] I'd like to place some thoughts in your
[2:06:14] heart to just place you under the right
[2:06:16] expectation. Amen. Because we've all
[2:06:20] heard
[2:06:21] uh you know about the process that
[2:06:25] justification makes way for
[2:06:26] sanctification
[2:06:28] and then sanctification makes way for
[2:06:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But what
[2:06:35] you heard brother Miguel talking about
[2:06:37] here today when he said making Jesus
[2:06:41] personal to you, he was talking about
[2:06:45] the process by which the baptism of the
[2:06:48] Holy Ghost. And I thank God that he sent
[2:06:50] a prophet to tell us that the baptism of
[2:06:54] the Holy Ghost makes way for the Holy
[2:06:57] Ghost himself,
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; the person of the word. Amen. Because
[2:07:03] that's what this is really all about.
[2:07:06] When you hear, "Have you received the
[2:07:08] Holy Ghost since you believed?" Like
[2:07:11] Paul when he came across those
[2:07:12] disciples, they were praising God. They
[2:07:15] were worshiping God. They were having
[2:07:17] church based on what they were told by
[2:07:20] the Apostle John, by by John the
[2:07:22] Baptist. They were praising God. But
[2:07:26] then he said, "But have you received the
[2:07:27] Holy Ghost?" And they said, "We've not
[2:07:30] heard
[2:07:31] [Music]
[2:07:33] You said what?
[2:07:36] And immediately he baptized them in the
[2:07:40] name of the Lord Jesus
[2:07:44] and they all received the Holy Ghost.
[2:07:48] It's because he made Jesus personal to
[2:07:52] them. He introduced them to Christ
[2:07:56] himself. Amen. And so it's not just
[2:08:02] the spirit on you. We've we've read it
[2:08:05] in Joel 2:28. I'll pour out my spirit
[2:08:08] upon all flesh. That means it's going to
[2:08:10] go on the just and the unjust.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; We want to know the personal Jesus
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; who changes everything.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; He's the one that tells us who we really
[2:08:25] are. Amen. Praise God. So this is the
[2:08:28] age that we receive the very person of
[2:08:32] Jesus Christ. Not just the baptism of
[2:08:34] the Holy Ghost. You can get baptism
[2:08:37] after baptism. You can come to youth
[2:08:39] camp after youth camp. You can come into
[2:08:41] the anointing and you think that that's
[2:08:44] it. I can leave now and everything's
[2:08:46] going to be fine and and and my life is
[2:08:48] going to change from this moment on. Not
[2:08:50] if you haven't met the person.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; You need the person. Amen.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; You need to know why he's coming to you.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose why he wants to come
[2:09:03] to you. Young people, you desire, your
[2:09:06] desire will completely change when
[2:09:10] you've met him.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, the attraction will be
[2:09:15] to the word.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; This is the evidence of the Holy Ghost.
[2:09:20] It's not signs and wonders. It's not
[2:09:22] sensations. It's not speaking in
[2:09:24] tongues. It's not getting all excited in
[2:09:26] those ways, but it's when you are
[2:09:29] instantly attracted to the word. All of
[2:09:32] a sudden, you God sent a prophet. Is
[2:09:35] that right? The opening of the seals,
[2:09:39] the open book, the seven thunders, all
[2:09:42] those things now start to attract your
[2:09:45] attention because it's the word for your
[2:09:49] day.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. The purpose of God,
[2:09:54] which is the word for your day, is for
[2:09:57] him to come into you
[2:10:00] personally. And now all of a sudden,
[2:10:03] you're not attracted by those things
[2:10:08] of the evil one that told you,
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; who told you those things? You see, but
[2:10:12] when the person comes, he takes control.
[2:10:16] He's now got he's got he's got rulership
[2:10:19] over your life. All of your all of your
[2:10:21] motives start to change. All of your
[2:10:24] goals start to change. All of a sudden,
[2:10:27] when you're going to school, you've got
[2:10:29] a different approach to the way that you
[2:10:33] express yourself with your friends, with
[2:10:35] your teachers. They start to see a
[2:10:38] different you.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's no longer you.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; It's now him in you. That's what Jesus
[2:10:47] said when he said on that day ye shall
[2:10:50] know. Ye shall know. And so the Holy
[2:10:53] Ghost is the person. We're not
[2:10:55] interested in baptisms. Yes, you need
[2:10:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that it
[2:11:01] could give you the power to overcome
[2:11:04] because that's what the Holy Spirit is.
[2:11:06] When you receive the baptism, it gives
[2:11:08] you the ability to overcome the things
[2:11:10] in your life. And that's why you come
[2:11:12] into these meetings, you get under the
[2:11:15] anointing and you get you get that
[2:11:17] conviction in your heart now that you
[2:11:19] want to overcome because it's now him in
[2:11:22] you giving you that desire and the
[2:11:25] ability to overcome. Now you can go out
[2:11:29] and you can meet the challenges as a
[2:11:31] young person.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; You have the hardest age when they
[2:11:36] listen. when we get there and they're
[2:11:38] going to hear your testimony, you young
[2:11:40] people, you came out of Le Oysia.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; How could you have possibly come out of
[2:11:45] Le Oysia? Because greater was he that
[2:11:49] was in me
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; than he that was in the world, the one
[2:11:54] that was telling me that I couldn't be a
[2:11:57] a a a a a person that could testify of
[2:12:00] Jesus Christ at at a young age as a
[2:12:03] teenager. Why?
[2:12:06] Who told you that? I'm telling you, the
[2:12:09] Holy Ghost has a purpose and desire to
[2:12:13] come in you. And before he can even come
[2:12:16] in you, he's he's already known you.
[2:12:20] [Music]
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; I knew you from before the foundations
[2:12:24] of the world.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to be under the right the
[2:12:29] word for the day and the me and the
[2:12:31] manifestation of the Holy Ghost comes to
[2:12:35] you as an individual in order to fulfill
[2:12:39] his purpose.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Remember that. So all of a sudden if his
[2:12:43] purpose comes into you, you're going to
[2:12:46] you're you're going to have overcoming
[2:12:48] power in you automatically.
[2:12:50] Sanctification is automatic. It's going
[2:12:53] to start to push out the things in your
[2:12:55] life. That's why you hear testimonies.
[2:12:57] And I'm one of them. I was a drug addict
[2:13:00] for 13 years and came into one service
[2:13:04] where something changed in my heart. I
[2:13:07] didn't realize. I didn't understand it.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; But the day that I went and when I went
[2:13:12] to my pastor, I said, "I want the Holy
[2:13:14] Ghost." He looked at me. He said,
[2:13:17] "Brother, you got the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; It started to work already
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; because it's something that you don't
[2:13:24] try to do. I never tried. I knew I
[2:13:27] wanted the deliverance from the from the
[2:13:29] drug addiction, but I couldn't do it.
[2:13:31] But in one day, he took me. He baptized
[2:13:35] me. When I came out of that tank, all I
[2:13:38] can tell you is that the desire, all the
[2:13:42] pull of that drug, and it was a cocaine
[2:13:44] drug addiction that I'm telling you, you
[2:13:47] you I I've know the power of that
[2:13:50] addiction. And when that power was
[2:13:53] broken, that wasn't something that I
[2:13:55] could do. Oh, Danny, did you go to a
[2:13:57] rehab? What happened? Did you go to a
[2:13:59] rehab? I said, "Yeah, the church of the
[2:14:01] living God, the power of Jesus Christ
[2:14:06] to do it instantly." Not not something
[2:14:09] that I had to try and do. Listen, I'm
[2:14:12] telling you, I know you've got a lot of
[2:14:14] people come up here last night. You'll
[2:14:16] come up maybe tonight. You've got
[2:14:18] something in your heart. I'm telling
[2:14:19] you, if it's your time, you will be
[2:14:22] delivered.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; And you will know that you are
[2:14:26] delivered. You will know that that it's
[2:14:28] not your power, but it's the power of
[2:14:31] the resurrected Christ. Amen. Christ,
[2:14:34] your hope of glory.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Romans 8 says, "All things work
[2:14:40] together." I never understood how
[2:14:42] powerful that scripture was until I walk
[2:14:46] with God for 31 years. I'm not just
[2:14:49] walking for a couple of years.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; I'm walking 31 years. You think that I'm
[2:14:54] mistake free since the day I came out of
[2:14:56] that baptismal tank? No sir. I've made a
[2:15:00] lot of mistakes and I'll probably still
[2:15:02] make some.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; And you're a liar if you if you tell me
[2:15:05] you don't make mistakes.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the purpose of God, the
[2:15:10] attribute of God that's in you that gets
[2:15:13] called at that time, that purpose will
[2:15:16] take over and it'll override all of your
[2:15:19] mistakes, all of your problems, all of
[2:15:22] your oppression, all the depression that
[2:15:24] the enemy tries to put on you. It'll
[2:15:27] just wipe it out.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; That's the expectation that you should
[2:15:31] be under this weekend. It's different.
[2:15:36] Amen. Glory to God. And then you'll
[2:15:38] realize that all things, whatever they
[2:15:40] are, work for good to them that are
[2:15:44] called to those that are to receive the
[2:15:48] Holy Ghost person of Jesus Christ
[2:15:53] in their day. That's what you become, a
[2:15:57] carrier of this word, the purpose of God
[2:16:01] in this day and in this hour. Amen. All
[2:16:06] that was in the Father, he poured into
[2:16:08] Christ.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ, he poured into
[2:16:14] the church.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Get ready.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; God is up to something.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; And you're going to be a part of it.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. God bless you. We're going
[2:16:28] to have a word of prayer and then we're
[2:16:29] going to dismiss you and I promise you,
[2:16:31] you're going to have a feast. Amen.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Not only did you get to feast on the
[2:16:35] word this morning, last night, you're
[2:16:38] going to get to feast now. And I know
[2:16:39] that you had a, you know, those that
