[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] once again
[0:15] i'm very happy to be here
[0:19] in the presence of the lord
[0:22] and to fellowship with you
[0:26] in the joy of the lord jesus christ
[0:31] may god bless you real good today
[0:35] and pour out his teaching of his word
[0:38] upon us that we may live as
[0:42] true saints of god in his divine
[0:45] presence
[0:46] god bless you i will now read our
[0:49] scripture
[0:50] of this wonderful marvelous lesson
[0:55] our scripture reading is found in
[0:57] revelation
[0:58] chapter 2 verse 9
[1:02] i know thy works
[1:06] and the tribulation
[1:10] and poverty but thou art rich
[1:14] and i know thy blasphemy of
[1:17] them which say they are jews
[1:21] and are not but are
[1:24] of this synagogue of
[1:28] satan today i thought
[1:31] this uh in this lesson
[1:34] i'd like to speak on the
[1:37] bitterness of smyrna the bitterness of
[1:41] smyrna
[1:42] that is our lesson for today
[1:45] and when we look at a smyrna
[1:49] itself we know
[1:52] that the uh name or word
[1:56] smyrna derives from
[1:59] the word mur mur
[2:02] which was like the gift one of the gifts
[2:06] given to jesus which it was
[2:10] used in the embalming of the
[2:13] dead it was bitter and
[2:16] so smyrna speaks of bitterness
[2:20] it speaks of the bitterness of the
[2:23] persecution
[2:25] of the church at that time it
[2:28] also speaks of the nickelodeonism
[2:33] which invaded the church in its seed
[2:37] form
[2:38] at that particular time
[2:41] it speaks of the hybriding
[2:45] hybridization of the church
[2:48] of the living god also
[2:51] of the bitterness
[2:55] brought upon the flock of god
[2:58] by human leadership
[3:04] and it speaks also of the bitterness
[3:08] of organization who on its surface
[3:12] seems to bring order and systems and
[3:16] sanity uh but in the
[3:19] end it produces nothing but
[3:23] hatred and bitterness and strife
[3:27] may god help us today as we look into
[3:30] his word
[3:32] and as we look what do we see
[3:35] we see israel coming out of egypt
[3:40] and as they came out just in the same
[3:44] way
[3:45] the early church came out
[3:48] for a true uh
[3:51] redemption has to do with
[3:55] coming out and going in
[3:59] we are speaking about the coming out of
[4:02] israel and the coming out
[4:06] of the church of the living god
[4:11] now when israel left egypt
[4:16] egypt of course which
[4:19] was their land of bondage and servitude
[4:25] and now we see the church
[4:28] in a parallel with israel
[4:31] the church leaving the world and its
[4:34] worldliness
[4:35] and dynamic nationalism
[4:39] their place of servitude
[4:44] bondage to habits bondage
[4:48] to sin and self and the servitude to
[4:54] satan
[4:56] so when israel left egypt
[4:59] they left under the supernatural
[5:03] leadership of god god represented by the
[5:07] pillar of fire
[5:10] in the above them
[5:14] and his prophet moses among them
[5:18] but they were under supernatural
[5:22] leadership god was their leader
[5:26] and their sovereign guide
[5:29] also we see friends that he
[5:33] was their king he was there
[5:36] everything that fed them led them
[5:39] protected them took care of them
[5:42] in every possible way
[5:46] and so is it with the early church
[5:50] when they came out
[5:54] from their various
[5:57] phariseesism sadduceeism
[6:00] uh from amongst epicureans the stoics
[6:04] and so on and separated themselves
[6:08] to god there were led
[6:12] by the presence of the holy spirit
[6:17] under the anointing of men
[6:20] with signs wonders and miracles
[6:24] they were under supernatural leadership
[6:28] of the great holy spirit
[6:32] once israel got out
[6:36] of their bondage and began to look
[6:40] around
[6:41] at that time looking at the
[6:44] other nations around them whether it's
[6:48] the philistines more bites amorites
[6:51] whoever they were at that particular
[6:53] time
[6:54] they saw that those nations were
[6:58] under a superintendent a
[7:01] king of some sort some kind
[7:04] of a leader like that that could
[7:08] lead them to war
[7:12] and say so they love the thought
[7:16] of having a visible
[7:20] human leadership rather than
[7:24] trusting and having
[7:27] faith in the supernatural
[7:31] leadership of god
[7:35] through the means of revelation
[7:38] through his prophet
[7:42] then no more wanted to be led
[7:46] by that supernatural leadership
[7:49] they wanted a human
[7:53] leadership one king
[7:57] sitting in a palace somewhere sitting in
[8:00] some
[8:01] in our modern times in some major city
[8:04] with the power and influence to
[8:07] influence
[8:08] thousands yeah even millions
[8:12] taking on a kingship
[8:16] over them and the people
[8:19] love to have it so
[8:22] now little did they know god
[8:26] already had a plan to humanize
[8:30] his leadership and that would be
[8:33] in the form of jesus christ
[8:37] for of course jesus christ is god
[8:40] come down from above them
[8:43] and now to become emmanuel
[8:46] god among them to walk
[8:50] with them god above them god with them
[8:54] to mingle among them and to understand
[8:57] and to
[8:58] know his people in a personal
[9:01] way but of course you know
[9:04] satan knew about this plan of
[9:08] god the plan was given since
[9:11] genesis 3 18 how that the seed of the
[9:15] woman would
[9:16] bruise the serpent's head and satan
[9:20] knew of the humanizing
[9:24] of this leadership but it would be done
[9:27] by
[9:27] god's way and so as evermore
[9:31] he loves to run ahead leap ahead of god
[9:36] and try to pervert the understanding
[9:40] meaning and manifestation of that
[9:44] leadership and so he
[9:47] put it in the hearts of the people
[9:51] he suggested it into the hearts of the
[9:54] people
[9:54] until they thought it was their own
[9:57] thought
[9:58] meanwhile it was his seed
[10:01] that perverted seed that was planted in
[10:05] their hearts
[10:06] to begin to request a
[10:10] human leadership ahead
[10:13] of the plan of god that had already
[10:17] planned
[10:18] to give them a human leadership in the
[10:21] form
[10:22] of jesus christ
[10:25] they approached samuel who uh a prophet
[10:30] later on there they approached samuel
[10:34] and put it to him
[10:37] that they wanted a king
[10:40] samuel was dismayed
[10:44] he was overwhelmed with the thought that
[10:48] they did not have a clear
[10:51] understanding of who was really leading
[10:55] them
[10:56] that it was not him as a
[10:59] human that was leading them but they
[11:02] were
[11:03] led by god the great
[11:06] jehovah spirit leading
[11:10] israel his people from
[11:13] victory onto victory
[11:17] god had gathered them called them out
[11:20] from amongst the nations
[11:23] god pleaded with them to stay
[11:26] with him to follow him
[11:30] he is one god and he
[11:33] does not change nor does not lie
[11:38] he carried his children through the
[11:41] wilderness
[11:42] he prospered them when they came out
[11:47] he blessed them every in every
[11:51] possible way and now
[11:55] they had arrived at this
[11:59] uh conclusion that they
[12:02] wanted to have some kind of a human
[12:06] king of course they said
[12:10] to samuel uh we
[12:13] know and appreciate
[12:17] that you have done your best to keep us
[12:20] lined up with the word
[12:23] and we appreciate it we also appreciate
[12:27] the mighty
[12:28] miracles we appreciate the wisdom
[12:34] the supernatural provision
[12:37] and supply we
[12:40] appreciate god's protection
[12:44] over us in every way and we believe
[12:47] all of it we believe it we believe and
[12:49] we receive it
[12:51] in every way we like it we love it
[12:54] but we still want to have a king
[12:58] to lead us in battle in other words
[13:01] samuel well we will keep all the
[13:04] religious
[13:05] require god's religious requirements
[13:10] uh and uh everything demanded by
[13:13] god's word but we
[13:17] we still love to have a a king
[13:21] like the other nations today the church
[13:24] will say
[13:24] like the other denominations uh
[13:28] we want to have a superintendent we want
[13:31] to have
[13:31] a a chief presbyter
[13:35] or we we want to have you know
[13:38] uh somebody to guide us and lead us
[13:42] uh to be above us we want to have a
[13:44] world
[13:45] leader that will be able to lead us
[13:48] and point us and going before us
[13:51] in war and in peace time
[13:55] oh oh samuel we don't intend to stop
[13:59] any of our a religious uh
[14:02] you know requirements traditions and
[14:05] beliefs
[14:06] that were handed down to us we're going
[14:08] to upkeep that
[14:10] but we are going to we require
[14:13] a king see they were going ahead of god
[14:17] they were stepping out of god's plan
[14:20] they did not come to ask samuel
[14:23] or require of samuel what does god
[14:26] want us to do they did not say well this
[14:30] is what we want but samuel well we we
[14:33] need to hear
[14:34] what is the will of god from you
[14:37] they came to request this
[14:41] but actually they came to tell him
[14:45] what they wanted and put it over
[14:50] or worded it in the way of a request
[14:55] but it was actually telling him
[14:58] what was in their heart and what they
[15:02] really desired and wanted
[15:06] so they wanted that king who could lead
[15:10] them
[15:11] and samuel of course being a true
[15:14] prophet of god
[15:16] realized that they uh were rejecting him
[15:21] little did they know that his
[15:24] sorrow was not over his rejection
[15:28] but because he knew he represented god
[15:33] and that by rejecting him they were
[15:36] rejecting the
[15:38] leadership of god the supernatural
[15:42] leadership now we're talking about
[15:44] invisible leadership
[15:46] and desire for visible leadership
[15:50] and here we see it my friends right
[15:52] before them
[15:54] amen hallelujah
[15:57] god true his word
[16:02] required that his people would be
[16:06] different
[16:09] and he ordained that they would act
[16:12] different
[16:13] and live differently than the world
[16:16] that was on the inside outside because
[16:19] you see
[16:20] real people of god are not of the world
[16:24] they are not of egypt they're not of the
[16:27] denomination
[16:28] they don't look like the world they
[16:31] don't
[16:31] dress like the world they don't act like
[16:34] the world
[16:35] their nature and manner is not like the
[16:39] world
[16:40] in fact the bible tells us they are
[16:42] crucified
[16:44] from the world and their affections
[16:47] are upon the things above and the things
[16:50] of the living god
[16:52] second corinthians 6 17-18
[16:56] wherefore come out
[16:59] from amongst them
[17:03] and be he separate saith the lord
[17:08] and touch not the unclean thing
[17:14] and i will receive you
[17:17] and will be a father unto you
[17:21] and you shall be my sons and
[17:24] daughters saith the lord almighty
[17:29] oh praise god hallelujah
[17:32] so the difference between israel
[17:36] and the other nations was their god
[17:40] that was in the midst of them
[17:43] israel of itself without god
[17:46] the nations had no fear for them but
[17:50] what the nations feared
[17:52] was israel's god who
[17:55] was amongst them so if you put
[17:58] god to the side israel was like
[18:02] every other nation when
[18:05] samson that mighty man as we read in the
[18:08] bible
[18:10] had his hair cut off from him
[18:14] he was like any other man
[18:17] at that time and when the church
[18:22] puts aside the invisible supernatural
[18:26] leadership of the holy spirit
[18:31] bringing revelation to his people
[18:35] teaching his people leading them
[18:39] by the means of supernatural
[18:43] revelation of which jesus said upon
[18:46] this rock i'll build my church and the
[18:49] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[18:53] it
[18:54] the church without that
[18:57] supernatural leadership is
[19:01] nothing but the world
[19:05] an infestation of worldliness
[19:08] with the label of the name
[19:12] of christian or of god upon it
[19:16] never mind whatever name they want to
[19:18] take on
[19:20] or we would want to take on if we
[19:23] are not uh filled led
[19:26] guided by the supernatural
[19:30] leadership of the holy spirit we
[19:33] are just my friends a gathering of
[19:36] religious people
[19:38] under the day and captivated
[19:41] by worthiness and denominationalism
[19:51] your inaudible but you operate like one
[19:54] your systems are like one you you act
[19:57] like them you move like them
[20:00] and so you you go into the same attitude
[20:03] and that my friend
[20:04] is nothing but a church
[20:08] that is just like every other church
[20:11] where there's a oh i'm in the message oh
[20:13] i believe the message
[20:14] but you act like them systematically
[20:18] organizationally you move like them
[20:21] and then what happens it's nothing but
[20:25] a religious group with the name of
[20:28] of the of god upon it or christian upon
[20:31] it
[20:32] or message upon it but it's nothing my
[20:35] friends but a a bug of worthiness
[20:39] it's a bug of egyptian
[20:42] evil and satanic seductions
[20:46] and evil that has come upon the people
[20:49] and
[20:50] captured their minds and hearts
[20:53] listen to the word of god
[20:56] the world and the church
[21:00] are really of the same lump
[21:04] just as jacob and esau
[21:07] were from the same mother
[21:10] from the same womb same parents
[21:14] amen but the spirit of god
[21:17] made the difference in one of them
[21:22] while in the other even though
[21:25] he looked like a gentleman acted like a
[21:28] gentleman moved like a gentleman
[21:30] yet he was inspired by the devil
[21:35] while the other one that looked
[21:39] as if he was a rascal in the renegade
[21:42] was led by the mighty hand of god
[21:47] and i'm putting it to you that that
[21:51] is what the happened like in heaven
[21:56] when the leadership of god seemed
[22:00] to satan's organized systematic
[22:04] ah a mind looked and saw
[22:09] how the weather how this moves that
[22:12] moved everything moved
[22:13] and uh it didn't seem like there was
[22:17] a proper order organization
[22:20] and systems to it and he felt he could
[22:23] do a better
[22:24] job than the most high god
[22:28] and so god kicked him out my friends it
[22:32] seems the same way in this world
[22:35] nature seems to be set up in such a way
[22:39] that when we look upon it it looks as if
[22:41] it's in disorder
[22:44] it's only with a closer look
[22:47] that we realize that there is
[22:50] order what seems like chaos at pentecost
[22:55] what seems like chaos in a real
[22:59] heaven set godsent revival my friends
[23:03] what seems as if it's ignorant what
[23:06] seems
[23:07] as if it's not wise god
[23:10] is in the midst of it and he
[23:13] provides an order that is above the
[23:16] order
[23:17] and organization of the minds of men
[23:21] we look here friends
[23:24] without the spirit of god we're nothing
[23:26] but reprobates
[23:29] without the spirit of god giving us
[23:32] revelation
[23:32] we cannot be truly born
[23:36] again and we are none of his without
[23:39] that spirit of god upon us for he that
[23:42] had an
[23:43] ear to hear let him hear for
[23:46] faith cometh by hearing and hearing come
[23:49] and hearing comes out of the word of god
[23:51] from the word of god amen
[23:54] hallelujah well most people
[23:58] when asked if they're christian their
[24:01] automatic reflex answer
[24:04] is to say well of course i'm a metadata
[24:07] oh well of course i'm a baptist
[24:09] well of course i'm a roman catholic well
[24:12] of course i'm a pentecostal
[24:15] well of course i am i am this or i am
[24:18] that
[24:19] whatsoever it is they're gonna say but
[24:22] my friends
[24:22] that has nothing to do with the new
[24:25] birth
[24:26] it's the holy ghost and power that is
[24:29] keeping us alive
[24:31] it is the holy ghost in you it's the
[24:34] token
[24:34] in you it's the gene of god in you
[24:38] it's the choosing of god or perish
[24:41] amen praise god christ in you
[24:45] or chaos around you and
[24:48] in you and in every possible way
[24:52] praise god let's go back to the early
[24:56] church
[24:58] and see what they had how they
[25:02] started out with signs wonders and
[25:06] miracles and with the power and presence
[25:09] of god
[25:11] their focus was what not the saints ones
[25:14] and miracles
[25:16] but the multiplication of the word of
[25:18] god
[25:19] and the dispersion of the truth
[25:22] of their word of god and those signs
[25:26] just followed them and took place
[25:29] because they were interested and
[25:33] motivated by the spread
[25:36] of the light of the word of god at that
[25:39] particular time
[25:41] amen and so as the believers
[25:47] of these church ages
[25:51] john had gone on
[25:54] polycarp paul
[25:58] these mighty men
[26:02] and other apostles and disciples that
[26:05] were also
[26:06] there anointed by the holy spirit
[26:10] gone on they became
[26:14] history they became
[26:18] after hundreds of years myths
[26:21] stories that could be tall about their
[26:24] miracles
[26:26] their wonders the truths they espoused
[26:30] it became stories to the other
[26:33] generations
[26:35] told to them by other men but they
[26:38] knew nothing about it except what
[26:42] they were being told and satan then was
[26:45] able to slip
[26:46] over the leadership of the holy spirit
[26:49] and placed it and humanized it in man
[26:53] god of course uses man to express
[26:56] himself
[26:58] but it is god making himself known
[27:01] through those
[27:01] men we will touch on that at another
[27:04] time
[27:06] but here it is
[27:09] they'll say i'll burn a candle every day
[27:13] or i'm this right that all right dudes
[27:16] in her venus
[27:18] that makes me a christian my friends
[27:21] not by works of righteousness which we
[27:24] have done
[27:25] but by his grace by his mercy
[27:28] that he has called us and saved us
[27:32] unto himself now the
[27:35] disciples of the
[27:38] early church hundreds of years down the
[27:42] line
[27:43] began to thinking and reasoning
[27:46] of how they could improve just like
[27:49] satan did
[27:50] you know how they could improve
[27:55] on what god has already done
[27:59] the blueprint the pattern
[28:02] that was set in the early church
[28:05] of accept of the book of acts
[28:09] they began to think how they could
[28:11] improve
[28:12] on what god has done not really
[28:15] realizing
[28:17] that they were now entering into
[28:18] perversion
[28:20] they were now entering into rebellion
[28:24] they were entering into disobedience
[28:27] they were entering into backsliding
[28:31] and wandering away from the original
[28:35] truth
[28:36] of god's holy word
[28:39] oh my then
[28:42] the deeds and of the nickelodeons
[28:48] began to rear up its head
[28:52] as a young serpent just a tiny little
[28:55] serpent
[28:57] doesn't look deadly as yet but it begins
[29:00] to
[29:00] raise its head up
[29:03] then we understand they formed
[29:06] their group and began to drift away
[29:12] from the word pattern or
[29:15] the blueprint as i've said that
[29:18] god had already set in his word
[29:22] in this book of acts
[29:26] my friends that's the way it always is
[29:29] just a little levin livens the entire
[29:33] whole lump now this
[29:36] satan inspired group
[29:41] formed itself together
[29:44] and began to hit
[29:48] and fight the true
[29:51] believers of that day for the
[29:54] contrast of the true believers
[29:59] would was a form of exposure
[30:02] of them it it showed them up
[30:05] it reflected on them so get rid of the
[30:09] competition
[30:10] get rid of these reflectors and you will
[30:13] stand alone and then your lie
[30:17] will begin to be believed as the truth
[30:21] this was their objective
[30:25] and they began to insist
[30:28] that they the nicolaitans
[30:33] these religious aliens
[30:37] these ones who appear to be so
[30:40] sanctimoniously
[30:41] holy these ones who appeared so
[30:44] consecrated
[30:45] and dedicated they began to claim
[30:49] originality and that they
[30:52] were the only true church of god
[30:56] at that time and had the rights
[31:01] to persecute destroy
[31:05] and tear down the people and things of
[31:08] god
[31:10] in that age oh my friends the bitterness
[31:14] of smyrna
[31:16] how bitter it was
[31:19] because as their form themselves
[31:23] organized themselves
[31:27] their organization bred
[31:30] hatred organization
[31:35] breaks fellowship for organization is a
[31:40] separator
[31:41] it separate themselves separate this
[31:43] church with this name from this church
[31:45] with this name
[31:47] until each groups are our people our
[31:49] people this our people that
[31:51] it's separate from one another
[31:55] and creates an atmosphere of spiritual
[31:59] bitterness
[32:01] and fighting and that is what
[32:04] mar means that is what it's all about
[32:09] bitterness the root
[32:12] seed and root of bitterness
[32:16] that defiles the hearts of many
[32:21] and the filement was surely coming
[32:24] in a greater and greater form
[32:27] and every other age from then
[32:31] to now would feel the scars and
[32:35] wounds that came from the bitterness
[32:39] that flowed out of smyrna
[32:43] of course the
[32:46] church at smyrna drifted
[32:49] far away from the original faith
[32:53] of the word of god and it became a
[32:58] hybrid
[32:59] as i said before bitterness a smyrna one
[33:02] of its bitterness nicolasianism
[33:04] another high breeding hybridization
[33:08] of the church of god as it was in the
[33:10] beginning
[33:11] so is it at the end when eve
[33:15] hybridized herself with a
[33:18] beast in the form of the serpent that
[33:22] looked like a man but it was really an
[33:26] animal in nature and
[33:29] brought high breeding which is the
[33:32] crossing of species
[33:34] i'm not talking about different uh
[33:37] nationalities of human beings i'm
[33:40] talking about the crossing
[33:42] of species now here we find france
[33:46] that she hybridized these great that
[33:50] the two species of human
[33:53] and animal human and beast
[33:57] and produce nothing but cain a
[34:00] mongrel a rebel
[34:03] to the word of the living god
[34:08] brought forth a creature
[34:14] in the garden of eden a monster
[34:19] kane a murderer kane
[34:23] a liar kane a hater
[34:26] who hated his brother kane she brought
[34:30] forth a
[34:31] mongrel a bastard born
[34:35] in the garden of eden
[34:39] he was not pure human
[34:43] he was a mingling of the seed of
[34:46] human and beast and the product
[34:50] therefore my friend as the bible tells
[34:54] us in first john
[34:56] king who was of the wicked one
[35:00] who slew or murdered his brother
[35:04] abel that spirit is still alive today
[35:10] it's dressed up it's
[35:13] beautiful like a snake
[35:17] its altars are beautiful
[35:21] prominent oh my friends
[35:24] but it still has the heart and soul
[35:28] of a killer and a murderer of its own
[35:32] brethren called christians
[35:36] oh look to the word
[35:41] notice from the day they were born
[35:45] how different they were came
[35:48] from abel one moved
[35:53] by the revelation of the holy spirit
[35:56] hebrews 11 where it tells you
[36:00] he abel uh presented or provided
[36:04] a better sacrifice than his
[36:07] brother cain why one was by revelation
[36:12] the other one was my guessing
[36:15] presumption
[36:16] and profession professing he did not
[36:19] know
[36:20] what to offer so he did what was right
[36:23] in his
[36:24] own eyes but he did not know what was
[36:28] right in god's eyes
[36:29] but by faith abell offered
[36:32] a better sacrifice different
[36:36] in nature he hated god
[36:39] he would not obey god disobedient to the
[36:43] word
[36:44] rebellious persecuted
[36:48] and killed his righteous
[36:52] brother
[36:54] and always had this attitude that he
[36:58] knew more than god or he could improve
[37:02] on god's altar god's way of worship
[37:05] god's
[37:06] sacrifice and always satan
[37:10] always has that attitude
[37:13] that he is not an originator a creator
[37:17] he has to take something god already has
[37:21] and then pervert it change it
[37:24] a little and then claim ownership of
[37:28] it claim originality claim that he's the
[37:32] one
[37:32] that invented or made it meanwhile
[37:36] that's a spirit his spirit
[37:39] that devilish spirit making such a claim
[37:43] oh my friends
[37:47] the church then devolved
[37:51] debalt into
[37:54] a hybrid state
[37:58] and become as hybrid as hybrid could be
[38:02] where they're comfortable and saying i'm
[38:05] uh
[38:06] i'm this or i'm this church i go to that
[38:09] denomination i go
[38:11] to the other denomination when we know
[38:13] there is only
[38:14] one name given on the heaven whereby we
[38:17] must be saved
[38:18] but now we have three thousand thousands
[38:20] of various names
[38:21] which people marry and attach themselves
[38:24] to
[38:25] and they become adulteress to the word
[38:28] of god
[38:30] now come friends we look to the word
[38:36] the life that is in them brings
[38:39] forth people that they claim to be
[38:42] christians
[38:43] just as cain claimed that cain was
[38:47] of the lord when she knew in our heart
[38:50] he was not
[38:52] he was of his father the devil
[38:55] for he was a liar from the beginning so
[39:00] in the same way they bring
[39:04] forth children from the seed
[39:08] that they have received that is
[39:11] not of god religious but not of god
[39:17] cain was religious but not of god and
[39:19] you'll find that
[39:20] parallel in truth right through the
[39:22] bible and true history
[39:24] religious but not of god and here we
[39:27] find it my friends
[39:31] they act like their particular
[39:34] denomination
[39:36] you can distinguish certain
[39:39] denominational traits within the people
[39:43] for every kind every seed will bring
[39:46] forth after its kind
[39:50] so we see that but not one of them is
[39:53] known
[39:55] for the supernatural revelation
[39:58] of the holy spirit amongst them they're
[40:02] known for their intellectuality
[40:05] they're known for their scholarship
[40:09] they are known and renowned for their
[40:12] schools of higher learning
[40:15] they are known my friends for their
[40:18] great
[40:20] ceremonial worship of god
[40:24] by their church creeds
[40:27] and their laid out dogmas
[40:31] and litanies they are known by that
[40:36] but they are not known for that
[40:38] supernatural ingredient
[40:41] to come in the midst and move things
[40:44] out of their order and into god's order
[40:48] and god's way of doing things to them
[40:51] that will be
[40:52] obscene to them that would be out of
[40:55] order
[40:56] and they'll get you or anyone with that
[41:00] kind of inspiration
[41:01] right out of there as fast as they can
[41:04] because you're disrupting what they as
[41:08] man have set up for so many hundred
[41:11] years
[41:12] and now you have come to bring a
[41:14] disruption
[41:16] talk about eye breathing talk about
[41:18] being a hybrid
[41:20] oh my god friends the most
[41:24] famous animal to be a hybrid
[41:27] is a mule and the mule of course
[41:31] if i might just mention quickly the
[41:33] qualities of a mule
[41:35] the mew can't reproduce himself he has
[41:38] no seed of his own
[41:41] the mule at the same time
[41:44] can outwork a horse or even
[41:48] a donkey he can outwork them you talk
[41:51] about doing church work
[41:52] they'll make you look lame
[41:56] they can outwork you in every way
[41:59] mentally physically they'll outwork you
[42:02] with all kinds of church work and social
[42:05] work and
[42:06] this and that they they're they're able
[42:09] to outwork you
[42:10] but they are an uh contrary to nature
[42:15] contrary and they have a contrary nature
[42:20] that is what they may look normal on the
[42:22] outside
[42:23] but they are of a contrary nature or a
[42:27] nature
[42:27] contrary to the word of god they're also
[42:31] known to be stubborn
[42:34] they hold on to something and they
[42:36] decide they're not going to move
[42:39] the word of god can tell them come out
[42:41] from amongst them my people be
[42:44] not partakers of their sins and their
[42:46] plagues
[42:47] and they say oh no i was born
[42:50] this or that and i'm not going to move
[42:54] and their stubborn spirit and they'll
[42:56] die
[42:57] right there and grow my friends to their
[43:00] destruction
[43:01] or praise god another thing with the
[43:03] mule the qualities of immune
[43:05] you can't trust a mule because the
[43:09] moment
[43:11] you turn your back that mule will
[43:14] bite you that mule will
[43:18] kick you that mule will do
[43:21] anything to get you out of
[43:24] whack whatsoever my friends
[43:28] or if there ever is a truth it's that
[43:31] truth that we are surrounded
[43:36] by hybrid religion
[43:39] the church has been taken over with the
[43:42] high breathing
[43:44] mixing the world into the church mixing
[43:48] satan with his seduction and his charm
[43:51] the appearance of the worship the
[43:54] appearance of the alder
[43:56] the appearance whatsoever they're using
[43:59] all manner of
[44:00] of physical
[44:03] mental olifactory
[44:07] kinds of things using the five senses
[44:10] of the mind and body
[44:15] to attract people rather than letting
[44:19] the great
[44:20] magnet of the holy spirit be the main
[44:24] attraction
[44:26] for it is not by might nor by power
[44:29] but by my spirit said the lord
[44:33] oh yes oh yeah i've got to have the holy
[44:36] spirit but along with the holy spirit we
[44:38] need these programs
[44:39] we need that we have the holy spirit but
[44:41] along with the holy spirit
[44:43] we need robert's rules of order oh yes
[44:46] we need the holy spirit but along with
[44:49] that we need these
[44:50] advertisements we need this you know
[44:53] propaganda and promotions we need this
[44:56] my friends
[44:59] we need god in our hearts we need
[45:02] god leading us and guiding us in every
[45:05] possible way amen praise the name of the
[45:08] lord
[45:09] we should not flirt with the world we
[45:12] should not conform with the world
[45:15] but we should allow ourselves to be
[45:18] transformed by the holy spirit
[45:20] transformed by the power of god i'll
[45:23] speak about this
[45:24] when we continue our study but we must
[45:27] allow ourselves to be
[45:29] molded by the potter's hand guided by
[45:32] the
[45:33] great shepherd of the sheepfold and
[45:36] led by him until we cross over
[45:40] into the promised land may the great
[45:42] holy spirit
[45:44] lead you guide you bless you may he
[45:47] open the eyes of your heart to recognize
[45:51] what i am saying
[45:53] i know while i'm speaking on these
[45:56] topics and subjects
[45:58] many will say oh i've heard that before
[46:00] oh i've read that before
[46:02] i've listened this before oh oh oh my
[46:05] friends
[46:06] others will look and listen and say oh
[46:10] that's nonsense i i don't understand it
[46:13] oh he doesn't sound
[46:15] very slick and smooth and photogenic or
[46:19] uh you know that kind of a systematic
[46:23] presentation uh i can't listen to that
[46:26] all friends don't you understand
[46:29] that god hides himself behind such
[46:32] things
[46:34] hides himself behind men that lived in
[46:37] caves
[46:38] man with rough beards man that going to
[46:42] the wilderness in the desert
[46:44] and appears like they never had a bath
[46:46] in in six months
[46:48] and then they came out saying thus
[46:51] sayeth the lord
[46:52] and the elder man was nothing but a
[46:54] disguise
[46:56] so that god could reflect himself
[46:59] and when we do not recognize
[47:02] that is when my friends we wander away
[47:05] and drift
[47:06] away into the things of the world
[47:10] and the things of churchiness rather
[47:12] than into the
[47:13] things of the revelation revelatory
[47:17] moving of the holy spirit by the opening
[47:21] of the word may god help us
[47:24] may god bless you today my friends and
[47:27] will come together next time
[47:29] around this bread of life to
[47:32] feast our souls upon him
[47:35] whom we love and believe now and
[47:38] forevermore
[47:39] god bless you real good
[48:02] [Music]
[48:17] you
