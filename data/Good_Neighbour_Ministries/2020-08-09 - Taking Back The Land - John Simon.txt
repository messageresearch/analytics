simon amen he brought me out of the my reclaim he set my feet on the rock to stay he put a song in my soul today a song of praise hallelujah yes france he brought me out of the mirror clay and he set my feet on the rock to stay he put a song in my soul today o praise god hallelujah blessed be his holy name good sunday morning to all of you and may the lord bless all of us today as we gather in his name to worship him to give him glory thanksgiving a praise and adoration for the wonderful works that he has done unto the children of men let us pray our gracious heavenly father we thank you for this marvelous and wonderful opportunity and season that we may come together as one in christ though we though the family of god is scattered here and there all around the world in various groups everywhere yet we love them there lord and may the great holy spirit send forth your lights and forth your truth send forth your power and your presence and take glory and honor in the marvelous and wonderful name of jesus amen as we read our scripture father may you breathe upon it and bring it to life again in the name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen it is found in the book of proverbs chapter 24 reading from verses 30 to 32 and the scripture reads i went by the field of the slutful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding and low it was grown over with thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down then i saw and considered it well i looked upon it and received instruction praise god now shall we turn also to the book of jude and we will read verses 1 2 4 jude the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ and called mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints hallelujah my friends thank god for the nation of israel thank god for his people of whom i will commit today by his grace and making the application to ourselves and to the church of god of course we all know the story of the uh of the the wonderful story of how god brought israel out of egyptian bondage they were bound they were made to work they were in slavery enslaved their firstborns were being killed by pharaoh's midwives uh until god turned the tables and said since you want to destroy and kill off the uh the the young ones of the jews and to take them kill them out from the roots then god turned it and placed a pestilence upon pharaoh's kingdom you know that ten plagues but pestilences plagues came upon them and god using the pestilence which was horrible which was terrible but god was actually using instrumentality of a pestilence of plagues to deliver his people so by faith we understand god brought them out by a mighty hand redemption true blood and power god brought them out hallelujah but you see friends god did not bring them out to take them into the wilderness to wonder about but he brought them out that he might bring them in that he might bless them shall i read now i want you to know friends clearly in the word of god here that we understand that redemption then has two parts this is what we learn right now god brought israel out that he might bring them in that he might bless them god brought us out from worldliness from sin from churchianity from whatever conditions we were in god brought us out but he just bring us out for us to water from church to church and wander around in religious cir circles searching for you know not what but he brought you out that he might bring you into the promised land of his word that he might open up your understanding that he might lead you through the wilderness of this world with all its troubles and trials all the tribulations the heat the thirst the hunger like that that you might one day walk into your promised land his promised land promised by the word of god amen for you see coming out is not enough a lot of people have come out from the world and they are wandering in the wilderness of sin still with all kinds of murmuring spirits complaining spirits on them in the church in the group and still with their spirits upon them he brought us out hallelujah he brought me out true grace hallelujah grace law praise the lord and i tell you friend the law condemns but grace defends let me repeat the law condemns but grace defends the law convicts but grace pardons and cleanses and justifies thanks be to god for the precious blood oh precious is the flow that makes me white as snow no other fount i know nothing but the blood of jesus hallelujah now for them to come in they were brought out then he might bring them in for him to bring them into the promised land there were three things that they must do and three things that god gave to them hallelujah in order for them to conquer the land now let's study this at this particular point in time first of all the book of joshua if you were ever to study the book of joshua it'll be joshua chapter 1 to 5 entering the land joshua's chapter 6 to 12 overcoming the land and joshua chapter 13 to 24 occupying the land so you see friends in order to enter overcome and occupy we have a command we have a promise and we have some problems and we must overcome those problems before we can enter into god's promised land first of all in joshua chapter 1 verses 1 to 9 israel and joshua were commanded by god to go in and take the land possess the land god told them that plainly this land is your land go into the land and take the land drive out the inhabitants thereof for that land is now your land now i'm typing canaan my friends the land of canaan to the land of this nation i'm typing it to the land of our churches i'm symbolizing it as our homes a place of peace and tranquility i'm symbolizing it as our own lives our own lifestyle our hearts oh praise god i'm also typing it as this message this word that is coming forth to you god's promised land which he promised that he would restore his word with and upon his people glory to god i read of the promise that was the command here is the promise deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 7 for the lord thy god bringeth thee into a good land a land of brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of oil and olive and honey a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness hallelujah thou shalt not lack anything in it a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass glory to god thank god we also of course in this age had a promise according to malachi chapter 4 5 how that god would send the line to the prophet who would restore the faith of the of the children of the fathers the children back to the fathers lord and god so our hearts are to be turned back our promise back to the original faith the original word what was taught preached lived demonstrated by the apostles glory to god hallelujah but with that friends we also have a problem because the devil is not going allow going to allow you just to walk in and take the land or or take these promises just because you have a right to take them because remember he's been sitting in that land for so many years and now you're going to be coming in to kick him out you want to kick him out of this land you want to kick him out of your home you want to kick him out of your lifestyle you want to kick him out of your heart your experience you want to kick him out even from invading our churches and this message of the owl look the problem is that the land is occupied amen the land is occupied the the great tree that jesus saw that grew from a little mustard seed found that it had all kinds of unclean birds and wicked unclean spirits roosting in the branches so is it with the church today and friends right in the very house of god the church of the living god we find that there were any spiritual enemies or against which we will fight we are not fighting people flesh and blood but against principalities powers and spiritual wickedness in high places now remember that even jesus had a congregation wherein he said have not i chosen you all of you but one of you is a devil right in jesus's little church there was a devil that that is one that had the seed of the serpent in him but at the same time peter one day said lord lord don't go up don't go up and jesus said to him get thee behind me satan you see one was a son of the devil the other one was temporarily used of the devil so looking jesus could see the devil working in both situations but he could differentiate and discern the difference between them but right in his church and even so today we have with the church my friends has got to drive up a whole lot of canaanites that are in the church because they can whatever they they do they can only do by night they can do by night and then we have to drive out a lot of hittites they're the ones that are in the church and all they're doing is sitting tight they're holding on there's a lot of ammo rights also in the church that's got to be driven out whatever the pastor says whatever the deacons tell them they are more right i am more right so they are amorites and they're always right and fighting and fussing and kind of on right within the church body we also have parasites or parasites that are in the body of the church some that just come into the church to be able to use the the facilities they uh take advantage of the generosity the giving the love the mercy and the grace of god and god's people and and and to misuse it and then we have another group here my friends that i can see on our uh jebusites that the bible speaks of them as jebusites i see them as those when a young convert comes in that will jab you in your sight so that you can't see the rest of the world and actually turn you away or turn you off of the message of the hour because of that jab in your sight and then within the the very uh group the very church of god wherever the church of god is the church is also filled with a lot of media nights uh you know they are in there in the church but their life is just filled with a lot of media and tv they're caught up with every rotten show amen they're caught up with every ungodly thing that comes on the television screen and i'll call them right now midianites now we understand also that they are more bites also in the church the pastor the membership can do as much as they can for them love them care for them and at the end of the day they'll turn around and bite for their call more more bites so the they have more bite they have more anger to them more vengeful spirits anointing them and so we have these more bites and then we have the hivites they love to fight they all wear that chest is always heaving with anger and temper and they're always ready to fight and these are all uh spirits personalities characters that are in the land that has to be taken out and i'm i let me not leave out the amount of kites because those are the ones filled with arrogance and pride they're like for high flying kites so they're called malachites so here we are dealing with all these nations that are in the land that god says before victory before possession before claiming your inheritance you must drive out these kinds of characters these kinds of nations spirits that are within the land now let me speak of that day and that time and the people of that day we understand that the people of that time that inhabited the land of canaan there were a wicked and idolatrous people they worship mammon i don't think they're much different than our world today wicked and idolatrous they love screen idols they love uh they love all manner of idolatry whether it's a a religious person becomes their idol but they love to worship idols and worship things and possessions their lovers of all these things my friends but here it is they worship mammon they worship bill bill mammon yes worshipping almighty dollar they'll do anything for a dollar my friends here we find it they worship bale and his wife the sex goddess asteroth oh god help us their worship was made up of terrible orgies their temples instead of being centers of worship of jehovah the one true god their temples were centers of vice dedicated to a bale and these gods of nimrod and so on tended by temple prostitutes and prostitute priestesses and sodomite priests oh god have mercy newborn babies were taken and placed in the fiery arms of baal sacrificed to him when a house or home was built back then in that land of canaan when the pagans ruled they would place a child will be killed a baby or child would be killed and placed within the foundations of that home as a sacrifice that would bring luck and build blessings upon them oh yes my friends just as today a people that love witches love witchcraft wizards they love to seek out psychics they love my friends to seek out mediums and to follow the pseudo sciences of astrology palmistry and horoscopes they follow star maps they pray to the dead they worship their ancestors and even later call them saints these were some of the evil ways of those nations that were in canaan now to obtain the land these evil ones had to be cast out they had to be destroyed deuteronomy chapter 7 verses 16 to 24. god told israel this land has to be cleansed and its wicked inhabitants must be wiped out no sympathy nor mercy was to be shown and none were to be left alive my friends that is simply saying that we should go through our churches our nation our homes our hearts our lives our experiences and not one sin one unbelief should be left behind but we should be able to say search me o lord and know my heart today try me o savior oh and cleanse my heart i pray oh praise god who was going to drive these nations out for they were great and mighty nations israel being a small training nation who how were they going to trade them out but they were going to trade them out working along with jehovah working together with god as paul said we are laborers together with god hallelujah so god and israel would do it my friends no matter what trial you're going through what sickness may be in your body now no matter what stress what depression what pressure might be upon you i want you to say to yourself and repeat after me god and i can do it say it again god and i can do it not alone but god and i can do it and yes you can let me say that yes you can for with god's help you can and you will for his grace is with you and his grace is sufficient for you and the god we serve is a gods that specializes in moving mountains moving away my friends all kinds of troubles and trials diseases demons death sickness whatever it is our god is able to set it right if only we shall ask him for he said you you receive not because you ask not but if you pray and ask him sincerely with your whole heart he will reach out to you while you are reaching out to him now this campaign begins in the land of canaan numbers chapter 13 verses 17 to 33 we find moses sending out 12 spies into the land of e of canaan oh praise god hallelujah friends it's the same principle we can see in the world we are if we are going to mature advance in god if we are going to claim our inheritance if we're going to take back our possessions claim the land for god's glory we must first examine ourselves we must spy out the land search our hearts our homes search through our practices our fundamentals of our churches the foundations are to be searched upon what foundations we have built on whether upon the rock revelation of god's word unchanging word or upon the seeking sins of minds thoughts theologies and principles oh lord jesus help us yes praise god amen so we have to check for enemies in the land search ourselves if there be any spirits of fear upon us think about yourself search your heart see if there are any attitudes of inferiority check yourself right now whether you are filled with tempo and anger and strength or having any spirit of rebellion the pastor can't talk to you your deacons can't talk to you you're ready to fuss and fume your your husband can't talk to you you're ready to fuss and view your wife can't talk to you you're ready to fuss until fume back to the world let's live the way he wants us to live let's take the promise of the hour and realize that god wants us to spy up our lives and check up to see if there is we have in our lives any spirits of suspicion any spirits of depression any spirits of pride any spirit of self-importance and greed spirits of bondage any strongholds within our lives now i'm going to pause here you'll say well brother simon why are you saying spirits of this and spirits of that that's old-fashioned and and really it's a neurosis or it's a psychosis or it's it's some other a wonderful term that we placed upon it because they have named these diseases they have named these emotional problems and gave them beautiful wonderful medical names but when jesus was here upon earth he says he had a devil jesus look come out your lame spirit come out your deaf spirit this do you dumb spirit come out in the amen hallelujah jesus called these things spirit spirits for every disease has a perverted kind of a life that keeps it alive and that a life it's not something you can see even a germ that you can see with the microscope that's a spirit is that is what gives that life you see so so we are not uh when a real anointed man of god is praying for the sick or casting out devils or preaching the word under the anointing of the holy spirit he is casting away the life the life the evil life the wicked life the pernacious life that dwells in that body or whether it's a micro body infinitesimal or whether it's a growth whatever the size is he is actually coming against and attacking that within the land of that person's being and casting it out in the name of jesus christ and while i'm yet speaking if thou canst believe all things are possible through him amen that rose from the dead is alive forevermore and who said in my name they'll cast out devils and the casting out of devils is the first of all cast the unbelief out of your heart and believe in your heart that all things are possible and that all is well all is well and god will make it so by his word glory to god hallelujah amen tense twelve spies went out ten of them said it's a good land but we can't we cannot take this land oh i don't love cans cannots or can't at all for all things are possible the people are giants so we can't take the land and we are gross grasshoppers but thank god for the chosen ones the blessed few uh joshua and caleb who said no you're you're bringing a false report your false report you're looking at those people and you're calling them giants and that we are the grasshoppers but we beg to differ we are the giants spiritually and they are the grasshoppers because we come in the name of jehovah the name of the lord and the battle is not ours but the battle is the lord's i believe they had it right my friend whatever you're going through whatever your trial your suffering your lack your need your weakness whatever it is throw your cares cast them upon him let him care for you the battle is the lord's this not your battle to stress yourself out worry and wonder about it anything like that but rest upon his unchanging grace and god promised in his word and we believe let him see by the way you live nonchalant you'll live uh just your normal life going about us if nothing had happened because you're trusting in his mercy and his grace you're trusting in his miracle working power you're trusting in his promises that he will bring you through whatever problems you may be going through yes praise god hallelujah let me say the words of god servant and prophet the right mental attitude to any promise of god will bring it to pass let me repeat the right mental attitude to any promise of god will bring it to pass my friends our churches our homes have been invaded taken over by investigations of these evil wicked uh spirits that has a invaded planet earth devils of mental illness that cause people to wander among the tombstones wander a mound up on the streets uh not that everyone that wonders is that way but i'm saying it causes people to become wanderers certainly bringing in unhappiness in the hearts of men and women people are taking more and more pills one pill to sleep another pill to be up stay awake one pill to relax and another pill to have the energy to work until even the very psychiatrists that are supposed to treat the people in their mental illnesses they are going insane many of them themselves rape adultery fornication sodomy lesbianism all forms of immorality and unclean spirits witchcraft as i foreset astrology alcohol nicotine demons all manner of drugs marijuana crack cocaine opium heron and many others that are out there at this times satan are using these means to reach into the lies the hearts the homes of people and the thief cometh not but for to kill and to steal and to destroy but thank god our jesus the mighty conqueror said but i am come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly receive his life today receive his grace today receive his healing touch today receive his word today receive your his forgiveness today receive his restoration all backsliding one back to the word back to christ back to the original faith that god has given to us oh glory to god hallelujah he lives forevermore our churches being infiltrated by all kinds of religious spirits claiming into the pulpits claiming to be servants of the living god men and women oh all kinds of lying spirits spirits of false teachers with doctrines of devils bible teachers who what tell you the truth oh white washing the very gospel on the word of god their people oh giving to their people all manner of as i said doctrines of devils oh three persons in one god where is that found in the bible nowhere all manner of programs giving to them worldly spirits of compromise oh my god hallelujah we're finding off the church now ruled by committees and boards and and so-called uh head men instead of being led by the holy ghost himself oh praise god forevermore and finally my friends control coming from head office headquarters rather than coming from heaven while they were in that upper room the bible reads and suddenly there came a sound of a mighty rushing wind from heaven and filled a place where they were sitting we need another mighty rushing wind to blow out the chaff that's in the church of god in the house of god in my life in your life in anyone's life that needs a transforming touch from the hand of the living god hallelujah as i am talking more and more about money and profits less rather than being true prophets of the word of god more interested in numbers and the word of god is pushed aside for some kind of an emotional feel good experience yes sir men now my friends going in this church and serving in various offices that has no evidence and surely lack a genuine new birth from the presence of almighty god here it is we also have in the church men beginning to go into the churches dressing and adorning themselves like women and women dressing and adorning themselves like men when god in the book of deuteronomy said it is an abomination for a woman to put on anything that even looks like what a man wears or puts on it's in your bible i'm not making that up that's not my just saying it it's in your bible you can search those words up and you will find it in there oh glory to god hallelujah what's being permitted in the churches women walking into the churches in shorts walking into the churches with all matter of sex exposure of where some of them taken their cue from those sex goddesses in hollywood and instead of walking in the beauty of holiness they're walking in the beauty of hollywood alex loose lazy lusting church members going to church with eyes filled with adultery and fornication dirty and unclean spirits controlling and possessing them and calling themselves sons and daughters of the living god religion now big business there it is my friends but the church has got to come back i must come back you must come back we must restore our homes back back to the land israel must go back to the land that god has given to her the land god has given to the church is the new found land of his word the word of god revealed in this hour god has given that to us hallelujah i tell you in the name of the lord israel's peace policy of uh you know land for peace will never work because it's plainly in the word of god we know there's going to be more that's easy anyone can say that there's going to be more wars upcoming for israel because they have not yet come in to possess all of their prophetic god-given possessions they are only sitting on a small part of it and other parts at the present time are overrun by other nations round about just as much the church have are much of our possession much of god's hidden chosen ones still within those ranks their amount still controlled by denominations but they must be called out by the word of god and the voice of god for this day and for this hour we know clearly friends that even great solomon's temple has got to be restored i want to tell you in the name of the lord i don't know how it's going to be restored oh but god said it would be restored and preparations are being made for its restoration signs of the red heifer are starting to be seen red heifers starting to turn up in israel but under inspection of the eagle eyes of the uh anointed rabbis when they check them there might be a white hair here or a white hair on the tail or a white ear on the ears or a white ear or gray hair somewhere on the body but god will restore back to them the genuine 100 percent red heifer that will be sacrificed back there again within solomon's temple and as they get closer and closer to the appearance of the real genuine red heifer they also see that the sign of the messiah the coming of the messiah is at hand oh how it ought to trill every jewish heart how it ought to trill every christian heart how it ought to thrill every believer's heart to know that we are living in an hour when modern events are being explained and made clear by the vindication of bible prophecy for the manifestation of the word is the interpretation of the word all glory to god forevermore may the holy spirit take his word and unfold it and unveil it before our very eyes in the hour in which we live praise god hallelujah my friends years ago my father uh took me into the jungles i can't say woods those were jungles we crossed the river and there we cleared some land and started a farm but because we could not go over as often as we would like to go weeks will pass and then we'll go again and when we got there sometimes there was a problem because in the warm humid climates of some of these southern nations things grow as quickly as you can grow quickly as weeds and the weeds will come up so fast that the land will be taken over with weeds may i say that's what's happened to israel that's what's happened to the church that may be what happened in your life that's maybe what has happened in your home until it has been taken over by all manner of weeds meaning entanglements all manner of entanglement has taken place and here we are in this hour we find it friends praise god that that is what solomon saw how that that or wonderful garden was taken over with weeds but when we go into the book of jude we read where the scriptures but we must earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto us the faith the word of god the original that was delivered to us we must fight for it oh glory to god we must live for it we must let god have his way within our hearts and within our lives glory to god hallelujah now we know of course this piece of bible imagery uh here holds truths and lessons and examples for us here today and one of those lessons the main lesson is spiritual neglect always leads to defeat and bondage worthiness apostasy and backsliding let me repeat the lesson we're learning here today is that spiritual neglect leads to defeat bondage worldliness apostasy and backsliding through careless living through spiritual laziness the weeds creep in the message invaded with weeds all fought manner of worms caterpillars cracker worms pineal worms bugs eating at their roots to kill a tree eating at the foundation of the church of god for this hour yes sir oh glory to god think of that naughty problem that situation that israel has her ancestral lands now occupied by others lands which god took our father abraham and placed him there and said look as far as your eye could see from from the sea here till that way it all belongs to you and your seed abraham forever glory to god and while israel through her disobedience to god was temporarily driven out of her land tested and tried and as it were walked through her fiery furnace of the wilderness of zion and found herself in a state of a holocaust millions perished but then god said when that was over he'd gather them back to their land again upon the wings of eagle slain now you must understand back then the largest bird the prophet could visualize was an eagle he could not say that it was planes but but but all he could call it was eagles but we know in our day god brought them back from the east the western north and the south and brought them back to their own land on the wings of great eagles speaking iron eagles airplanes brought them back to their land hallelujah and their flag the six-point flag of david is flying over their land they're back there here and there again by god's promise of his word oh praise god and she must do what she has to do but in god's time she must take back the land that rightfully belongs to her i know it would be easy but she must take it back amen she knows her rights then she'll know how to take a genuine stand by the word of god hallelujah there's always similar situations friends when the enemy armies of satan have come and invaded and occupied our great land of faith amen satan has even invaded this faith that once did was delivered unto the saints and took away our spiritual land and gave to us three gods gave to us father son and holy ghost baptism gave to us half-dressed women gave to us a media tricks instead of the only mediator between god and man which is christ jesus gave to us many other unscriptural ungodly things that are not even found in the bible he has stripped it away taken away and stolen even in our individual eyes strolling away the very virtues of the stature of the perfect man christ jesus goodness meekness long suffering patience godliness all of these things he the devil has stolen it away from within the hearts of the believers in the true church but thanks be to god my friends i'm so happy today that we don't have to be unfair because general jesus hallelujah our five-star general is on the charge he's on the beat he is here with us j-e-s-u-s five the five-star general he is right here and he'll drive out every enemy out of the land if we surrender ourselves to him completely let's take back our churches take backwards schools take backwards streets take back our neighborhoods do you have problems in your marriage get on your knees talk to god take back your marriage by faith see oh god help me lord i know it's your help i can i'll rise and try again in the name of jesus christ help me lord with your help you and i can say it god and i can do it god and i can do it god and i can do it thank god and you will be a fellow laborer together with god working out the things in your life that god wants to manifest and work out of your life let us take back as i said our lives take back your happiness don't let satan steal your joy don't let him take away your happiness within your heart and within your home oh praise god take back that loveliness that sweet spirit of peace and joy you once shared and had with in the face of the brethren oh glory be to god hallelujah amen when the five kings came and took away lot my god abraham went after his nephew let's go after our loved ones by faith i don't mean go grab them wrestle them and pull them in the church but i'm saying pray like you've never prayed before and begin to have spiritual warfare against the works of satan that you might bring them back into the arms of god into the arms of jesus christ into his great love into his gender care where he can love them and lead them and guide them and give them a change in their lives hallelujah oh my god take back your land from the trespasser the it's the year of jubilee now the seven church ages are over and you have a right to drive out every trespasser every disease from your body every sickness every pain everything the devil truth every trouble every lack every scarcity every sense of poverty of trouble and tribulation you have the right to drive it away from your life in the name of jesus christ oh praise his wonderful name
