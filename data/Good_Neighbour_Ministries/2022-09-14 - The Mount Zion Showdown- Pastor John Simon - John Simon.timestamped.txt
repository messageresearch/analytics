[26:01] amen please be seated
[26:07] amen
[26:09] hallelujah
[26:11] now
[26:14] now remember
[26:17] these
[26:18] false prophets
[26:22] many
[26:24] people
[26:26] like now
[26:28] after that they had heard listen
[26:32] after that they had heard the word
[26:35] from
[26:37] the true
[26:39] prophet
[26:40] the anointed prophet that was vindicated
[26:46] they
[26:47] fell
[26:48] for coral's lies
[26:52] after they heard the message
[26:54] after they followed it
[26:56] after they walked with it
[26:59] he said they're going to fall for cora's
[27:02] life
[27:03] now you got to go back into the old
[27:04] testament
[27:07] to understand that korah
[27:10] was
[27:11] as we would in type say was
[27:14] as a make-believer
[27:17] he was within the tribe of israel
[27:21] he was walking believing uh
[27:25] the message just as the others were
[27:28] they were all following moses
[27:30] they were all following the message for
[27:32] their hour and their day
[27:35] but he says here i repeat
[27:38] after they had heard the true word
[27:42] from the anointed prophet
[27:45] that was vindicated they still fell for
[27:50] chorus lies
[27:53] oh my
[27:54] korra was not some
[27:56] fellow in egypt on the street
[27:59] cora was not somebody yelling that he's
[28:03] against god or he's against the this or
[28:06] against that
[28:08] but somebody from the back door within
[28:11] the message that will begin to say
[28:14] things
[28:15] that the attempt is to erode credibility
[28:19] error
[28:21] faith in
[28:23] the prophet's message
[28:25] right
[28:26] and they fell for chorus lies
[28:31] when god had given them a god-proven
[28:34] prophet
[28:36] right
[28:37] god had told them distinctly
[28:40] you see horror was not according him was
[28:44] not really a scriptural prophet see
[28:48] but it looked awful good to them people
[28:52] my
[28:53] same as it does now today
[28:57] same as it does today see oh my and then
[29:02] we know my friends you you you would not
[29:06] think that people will fall for it
[29:10] but they did then
[29:12] just as they did to korra
[29:15] they did then
[29:17] and so are they doing again today
[29:21] oh my
[29:22] you see and they do the same thing
[29:25] actually he says right there and they do
[29:27] the same thing now
[29:30] and by that
[29:32] turn away from the true word
[29:36] right turn away from the true word
[29:40] and go
[29:42] back to them denominations
[29:45] right they go back to denominations
[29:49] oh my
[29:51] then that begins to show what seed was
[29:56] in them
[29:59] but thank god
[30:01] all israel did not fall for cora's lies
[30:07] amen
[30:08] some stayed with moses the anointed
[30:12] prophet with the word of god for that
[30:16] day
[30:17] same he repeats same as it is today amen
[30:23] same
[30:24] as it is today with many of god's
[30:28] elected
[30:30] by his word
[30:32] and by his spirit hallelujah
[30:36] amen
[30:38] praise god brothers we are living in a
[30:41] real
[30:42] razor edge time
[30:45] we have come right to the pinnacle of
[30:49] the
[30:50] mountain of god
[30:52] the stature of a perfect man
[30:55] where he said the thing will come to a
[30:57] razor's edge
[31:00] a razor's edge
[31:02] and there
[31:03] except you have your eyes on the word
[31:06] you will not be able to walk the line
[31:08] you can't do it
[31:10] but if you are of him
[31:13] he will cause you to walk the line
[31:17] amen praise god
[31:19] now notice now
[31:22] all scripture
[31:24] has not yet been fulfilled
[31:30] amen
[31:33] but it must it must be fulfilled
[31:37] now remember the gentile
[31:41] dispensation is not finished
[31:45] amen and it is to be finished
[31:48] so all scripture is not yet at his time
[31:51] not yet fulfilled
[31:53] right
[31:54] now
[31:56] see
[31:56] that must happen
[31:58] we know malachi 4 5
[32:02] has been fulfilled
[32:04] amen the prophet has come
[32:07] and gone
[32:10] also we know the church ages
[32:13] have been fulfilled
[32:15] they have come
[32:17] and they're gone
[32:19] i don't mean when i say gone you will
[32:21] understand this it's not just chopped
[32:23] like that and stops
[32:24] it it phases out right
[32:27] but uh officially
[32:29] uh
[32:30] they they the ages are over time shall
[32:34] be no more the church edges have no more
[32:37] time it's run out time has run out for
[32:41] the church ages because other things
[32:43] have to happen now other things have to
[32:46] be fulfilled by the grace of god amen
[32:51] hallelujah praise god for you see he
[32:54] says now they
[32:56] that anointed messenger
[32:59] uh arrives on the scene
[33:02] and he will be the one
[33:05] that will plant the seed
[33:08] of the entire bible not a seed but this
[33:11] seed we know that's the word that is
[33:14] jesus himself the word he will plant the
[33:17] logos he will plant the seed
[33:21] of the entire bible
[33:25] hallelujah
[33:26] from the serpent seed to
[33:29] right to the messenger of the former
[33:33] reign
[33:34] hallelujah
[33:36] my goodness this is a particular and
[33:40] peculiar man whom we believe has already
[33:44] come has already gone has already
[33:47] fulfilled this ministry we believe it to
[33:50] be brother william marion branham
[33:53] [Applause]
[33:55] amen
[33:56] you see
[33:57] but that one will be rejected by them
[34:01] denominational people
[34:04] right just like their forefathers
[34:07] but remember john was spoken of
[34:11] elijah was also spoken of by the lord
[34:17] hallelujah praise god and i want you to
[34:21] know
[34:22] this will happen again here in this
[34:26] country
[34:28] as this country
[34:30] is a type of israel
[34:34] go read he says jezebel religion
[34:37] just the same
[34:39] our forefathers came
[34:41] right
[34:42] and we pushed out them natives and we
[34:45] just took over
[34:47] so this israel
[34:49] god allowed them to go in go out of
[34:53] egypt go into the land push the people
[34:55] out and took over right oh my but just
[35:00] like them he says speaking to the united
[35:03] states
[35:04] we also have godly man leading us
[35:08] then he names abraham lincoln
[35:11] and washington well men of that stature
[35:15] that were leading them just like israel
[35:18] had godly men like david and so on
[35:20] leading them
[35:22] at that time
[35:24] but when all of that was over
[35:28] then god allowed an ahab
[35:31] to come and sit on the throne
[35:34] oh my i believe we right now in that
[35:37] season and time
[35:39] when an ahab has got to sit on that
[35:42] trail amen well listen close because
[35:47] ahab is only going to be the face or the
[35:49] front but an ahab has got to come sit on
[35:54] the throne
[35:55] amen watch take a bit about it now
[36:00] we find out
[36:02] but when he got on the throne
[36:05] there will be a jezebel behind him
[36:09] can you say man
[36:11] she will be behind him he says to direct
[36:15] him
[36:17] to direct him to who who really is on
[36:19] the throne
[36:21] he's just a figurehead sitting on the
[36:23] troll
[36:24] but jezebel will be behind him to direct
[36:28] him
[36:29] that is prophecy
[36:31] that is telling you about the catholic
[36:34] church
[36:35] funding financing and having influence
[36:38] power and control and domination
[36:42] over whoever is going to be the ruler on
[36:46] the throne over there
[36:49] amen and as such will have influence
[36:51] over the whole world
[36:53] because you know whatever happens there
[36:55] influences the entire world okay okay so
[36:58] here it is now know this
[37:01] so
[37:02] it's at this time
[37:05] we know it's at this time and i say this
[37:09] thus sayeth the lord amen
[37:12] praise god it will there will there has
[37:16] come forth back in israel a mount
[37:18] caramel showdown
[37:21] he's saying at the same thing is going
[37:24] to take place again
[37:27] just like in israel
[37:30] there was a monk caramel showdown
[37:34] under the ministry of the first elijah
[37:38] what was that monk caramel showdown you
[37:40] know it was between the false prophets
[37:44] that were eating from jezebel's table
[37:47] that were getting their salaries and
[37:49] their big this and that and uh dressed
[37:52] up like big prophets with co-horns and
[37:54] all kinds of uh regalia on them
[37:57] while he elijah was just a
[38:00] shabby old man dressed with a camel skin
[38:04] he wasn't even counted as any preacher
[38:06] or anything of that nature but here it
[38:08] was he said that is going to happen here
[38:13] again
[38:15] a mount caramel
[38:17] down now what what was the monk caramel
[38:20] showdown it was a showdown
[38:23] between
[38:25] the message of elijah
[38:28] and the message of what this prophecy
[38:31] these prophets were preaching
[38:35] these prophets were preaching that the
[38:38] church was right
[38:40] jezebel was right and elijah was wrong
[38:45] and usually that's what happened
[38:48] it bothers them so much right oh my when
[38:52] they say oh eli
[38:54] when elijah met a ham in the desert hear
[38:57] what ahab says are you he that trouble
[38:59] at israel
[39:01] no listen to that question and the same
[39:03] thing happens today they accuse
[39:05] preachers even like me that that you you
[39:08] you you putting a curse on the people
[39:11] you making these things happen he likes
[39:13] to turn around and says no
[39:16] i don't trouble israel it's you
[39:19] and your adulterous wicked ungodly wife
[39:22] that's that's the one that brings the
[39:24] trouble on israel it's your own actions
[39:26] that brings the curse on you
[39:29] amen i'm just telling you i see it and
[39:31] that's what's going to happen that's the
[39:33] way it is because god's word already
[39:35] tells you that
[39:36] [Music]
[39:37] and so the showdown was between elijah
[39:42] the true word representing the true word
[39:45] and the prophets of jezebel
[39:48] who are type of false prophets false
[39:52] preachers
[39:53] bringing a hybrid truth
[39:56] of the word of god
[39:58] oh my
[39:59] see
[40:00] and after that then
[40:03] we see
[40:05] john the baptist
[40:07] the messenger
[40:08] comes and he
[40:11] my friends preach the word oh my
[40:15] but then we find a messenger planting
[40:19] the former reign
[40:22] will be rejected by the churches
[40:25] rejected by the denominations
[40:28] we will know that clearly brother
[40:30] brennan's ministry is rejected by all of
[40:32] them they don't want to hear it they
[40:34] don't think it doesn't agree with their
[40:36] teaching
[40:38] it doesn't agree with their
[40:41] uh
[40:42] diagnosis
[40:44] it does not agree
[40:45] with their uh
[40:47] compendium of
[40:49] thoughts when they bring together all
[40:52] their religious thoughts and put in a
[40:54] theological book which should be the
[40:56] wisdom for all churches and that's got
[41:00] to be right what single man is going to
[41:02] step out when there are a thousand ten
[41:05] thousand learned men through centuries
[41:08] that said this this is this this but
[41:11] they don't understand that one man the
[41:14] only man that was given thus saith the
[41:18] lord it doesn't matter what a million
[41:22] men 10 million men said before let every
[41:26] man's big word be a lie and my word be
[41:30] the truth
[41:31] and i believe god's word
[41:34] hallelujah amen see
[41:37] oh my but remember
[41:40] jesus come
[41:43] and he had a monk transfiguration
[41:46] showdown
[41:47] amen with the pharisees and the
[41:50] sadducees they wouldn't accept him as
[41:53] the word
[41:54] but all he did was not argue with them
[41:58] but he went up in the mountain and he
[42:01] was transfigured not to them
[42:04] it was a showdown but he was
[42:06] transfigured to his disciples
[42:08] he was transfigured he showed himself
[42:11] the word
[42:13] amen in a transfigured form to them
[42:18] amen yet when he came back down when the
[42:20] pharisees saw him he was the same jesus
[42:23] but then or what they seen when they
[42:25] were caught up in that revelation
[42:27] they know what they have seen when they
[42:30] were caught up with the brightness of
[42:32] his effulgent glory they know what their
[42:35] spirit had seen hallelujah and they
[42:38] recognize it amen glory to god
[42:42] hallelujah
[42:43] amen now notice
[42:46] amen
[42:47] now
[42:48] this
[42:49] one of the last days
[42:52] will show
[42:53] for the former reign hallelujah praise
[42:57] god so what we are
[43:00] starting to experience now
[43:03] amen and what we will experience
[43:06] hallelujah because we were and are still
[43:09] in the former reign of the ministry of
[43:12] malachi force high
[43:15] right praise god so we understand that
[43:19] oh my
[43:21] then he turns around he says
[43:24] and see
[43:25] jesus
[43:26] will now be the showdown himself
[43:30] hallelujah this is not the messenger uh
[43:34] uh coming now this will be jesus the
[43:37] word
[43:39] hallelujah will be the showdown
[43:43] that will be between
[43:45] denominations and creeds
[43:47] and against that which is his word
[43:51] hallelujah it will be the word versus
[43:55] denominational teachings and creeds so
[43:58] we're in the middle of that showdown
[44:00] right now
[44:01] in other words it's starting to come to
[44:04] its fullness amen where are going to
[44:08] have to face that showdown
[44:10] because they are going to start getting
[44:12] aggressive
[44:14] and coming against what we are teaching
[44:18] because remember they've got to get to
[44:20] the place where they shut you up
[44:24] close down your churches
[44:26] stop you from ministering
[44:28] so they've got to become enraged like it
[44:32] was in the bible when the prophets
[44:34] preached when jesus preached when paul
[44:38] preached when any of the true word
[44:40] flashed through a messenger then what
[44:43] happens they become so enraged
[44:45] but the bible says for their wisdom they
[44:48] cannot withstand
[44:50] the revelation from the word of god
[44:53] and when they find that cat which stand
[44:56] up they become enraged hallelujah amen
[45:01] praise god hallelujah amen now we see
[45:05] then
[45:06] glory to god hallelujah
[45:09] there it will be then that will be the
[45:12] time for the showdown
[45:16] the rapture of the bride
[45:20] that is the mount zion showdown
[45:22] because the last part of
[45:25] her uh displaying to them that all that
[45:28] she has been saying and telling them is
[45:30] the truth
[45:31] is when she is caught out of this place
[45:34] is that right that will be the final
[45:36] part of the showdown amen oh praise god
[45:40] it started already
[45:42] amen but the
[45:44] entire uh show mount zion showdown which
[45:49] is the rapture itself will be the
[45:52] showdown it will show them who she
[45:55] really is
[45:56] praise god hallelujah remember this the
[46:00] first was in mount carmel the second was
[46:04] among transfiguration and the third will
[46:08] be
[46:09] mount zion glory to god the rapture show
[46:13] down
[46:14] that will be the third one and i believe
[46:18] we are in the middle of that right now
[46:21] we're heading to the top of the mountain
[46:23] why we're seeing the fullness of the
[46:26] world making itself known
[46:28] watch
[46:29] just like elijah's behavior back there
[46:34] like moses behavior
[46:36] like john's behavior
[46:39] oh my
[46:40] many of the people don't understand them
[46:44] hallelujah and the reason is because
[46:49] they
[46:49] reject his message
[46:52] see they reject his message
[46:55] oh my
[46:57] yes sir but
[46:59] remember
[47:00] they reject this message
[47:02] but the seed has already been shown
[47:06] in other words he don't care the
[47:08] messenger doesn't care that the seed has
[47:10] already sown
[47:12] that's what you can do about it amen and
[47:14] god is going to bring it up in his own
[47:17] time
[47:18] in his season when he is ready he's
[47:20] going to bring him but i have already
[47:22] sown the seeds and i am one of those
[47:25] seeds hallelujah
[47:27] you are one of those seeds i hope the
[47:29] holy ghost has got a hold of you
[47:32] amen praise god hallelujah oh my
[47:36] remember there
[47:38] there or that man was a sign to the
[47:42] people from god
[47:44] amen that the planting of the seed was
[47:48] over
[47:50] and now judgment
[47:52] is at hand
[47:54] amen oh praise god forevermore
[47:58] hallelujah amen i believe it friends
[48:02] amen
[48:03] i believe
[48:05] at that time
[48:08] the real bride of jesus christ
[48:11] will be forced to stop preaching the
[48:14] word
[48:17] yeah and i believe we are right on the
[48:19] brink of that
[48:20] we're right on the brink of it right now
[48:22] she will be forced to stop preaching the
[48:26] word of god
[48:28] it's not that she's not preaching the
[48:30] bible
[48:32] it's not that she's not preaching from
[48:34] the bible
[48:35] but he's talking about the revelation of
[48:39] the fullness of the word as she
[48:41] understands it and sees it here when she
[48:44] begins to talk that
[48:46] they'll understand the written part
[48:47] she's talking about but the unwritten
[48:49] part that is all in there they have no
[48:52] where do you get that where do you hear
[48:54] that where's that from i don't see it in
[48:56] here and so and she will be branded and
[49:00] persecuted like he was persecuted in
[49:04] that way because we didn't hear moses
[49:07] say that we didn't hear this one says
[49:08] that he says but before moses was
[49:12] i am
[49:13] amen it's he's in me now and i'm
[49:17] speaking to you now
[49:18] praise god hallelujah they're not going
[49:21] to recognize who the bride really is
[49:23] that is jesus christ the same yesterday
[49:25] today and forever it's easy when we say
[49:28] it but they will not recognize that
[49:32] they're leaving children say who you
[49:34] bill
[49:35] oh my
[49:37] i know glenn i i know this one i i know
[49:41] that one doesn't care what you know that
[49:44] is your head nor that that's why your
[49:46] eyes see what you think you know but you
[49:49] the one who you should really know is
[49:51] the one that's inside me inside you
[49:53] inside the real believer that's the one
[49:55] you should really know hallelujah that's
[49:59] the one they should be able to recognize
[50:02] amen
[50:03] see
[50:05] they will be forced to preach stop
[50:08] preaching the word of god
[50:11] i believe it and the bible prophesies it
[50:15] also
[50:16] in revelations 3
[50:19] 16
[50:20] you see it's them denominations
[50:23] that will force it
[50:26] to stop preaching or to take its mark
[50:30] you're going to either have to go and
[50:31] have membership in one of them
[50:34] right
[50:35] or to be able to continue preaching and
[50:39] have all the rights of
[50:41] registrations for
[50:42] marriage officer registration to be
[50:46] chaplain registration to be all of these
[50:48] things like that it will get to that
[50:51] point where they're going to draw a line
[50:55] we still have a certain amount of
[50:57] freedom right now
[50:59] but they're going to draw a sharp line
[51:02] that you will not be able to do those
[51:05] things and she will have to stop
[51:08] preaching see
[51:10] and to take the mark hallelujah oh my
[51:14] but just about that time
[51:17] is when the lamb will take his bride
[51:21] he will not allow her to go through
[51:24] tribulation
[51:26] but he will take his bride away out of
[51:28] that kind of atmosphere
[51:31] and then we find
[51:34] the judge
[51:35] oh the judge will come
[51:38] to judge that harlot amen as mentioned
[51:42] in revelation 13 16 my think of what our
[51:47] real living in you know how many
[51:48] supernatural actions and tremendous
[51:51] fulfillments and words of god are taking
[51:54] place while we go about our simple lies
[51:57] or our work or rest or eating or
[52:00] sleeping or waking or traveling but the
[52:03] supernatural
[52:04] doesn't stop our god is marching on and
[52:08] these events are taking place or fixing
[52:11] to take place
[52:13] amen praise god hallelujah amen oh my
[52:19] remember
[52:21] remember this
[52:23] moses was born for that work at that
[52:26] time
[52:28] now why what i just want to shift your
[52:30] thoughts here he's talking about moses
[52:32] back there but we can type that and show
[52:34] he's talking also of the spirit of moses
[52:38] uh being on the messenger of this last
[52:41] day
[52:42] but then when you go beyond that he's
[52:45] talking now
[52:46] about the spirit of god being on the
[52:48] bride
[52:50] amen see okay so while i'm talking you
[52:53] will understand now moses was born for
[52:58] that
[52:58] work born for that work at that time a
[53:01] prepared vessel in other words prepared
[53:04] ground to go about that work for that
[53:07] time
[53:08] but still
[53:10] he had to wait on god
[53:14] don't act prematurely
[53:16] he had to wait on god
[53:19] for an extra gift
[53:22] to be able to finish the job glory to
[53:25] god they had to become there has to come
[53:28] a surge of the holy spirit on this bride
[53:32] there has got to come a quickening more
[53:35] by god's hand amen
[53:37] praise god brother sister we don't know
[53:40] what day what time what hour but we just
[53:43] make sure that the lord has been soaked
[53:46] in the word of god hallelujah so that he
[53:50] can take complete control and
[53:52] preeminence to fulfill his divine will
[53:57] remember
[53:59] moses
[54:00] was born for the work
[54:02] amen
[54:03] in other words he was born for the work
[54:06] not only that he came prepared
[54:08] but uh moses was born with a whole pile
[54:12] of natural gifts
[54:14] beyond what any person of that age had
[54:18] and he he had wisdom more than all the
[54:20] wise men in egypt
[54:22] and everything else he had those natural
[54:24] gifts but what what is being said here
[54:26] is with all of that he still couldn't do
[54:28] it
[54:29] with all the intellectuals with all the
[54:32] knowledge
[54:33] he could not accomplish anything more
[54:36] than killing an egyptian
[54:38] he could not accomplish anything he
[54:41] still had to wait on god
[54:44] hallelujah he see he had he repeats it
[54:48] he had to go back and wait amen and he
[54:53] had to wait
[54:55] he says for the appointed time
[54:59] there's an appointed time for these
[55:01] things to happen
[55:02] is that right
[55:03] and you saw brother branham in his
[55:05] ministry
[55:06] even when he already seen the vision
[55:09] this and this and this is what's going
[55:11] to happen
[55:12] and he would walk in the room
[55:14] he had to sit there and wait
[55:18] because an old woman is supposed to come
[55:20] and sit in that chair
[55:21] and she's supposed to have a brown shawl
[55:23] all over her shoulder
[55:25] and this is supposed to happen when you
[55:28] see these three things happen
[55:30] now you know it's the time
[55:32] is that right so he just has to sit
[55:35] there and wait or stand and wait amen
[55:37] and that's what god is telling us now
[55:39] not one man on a platform but now a
[55:43] whole bride is waiting amen for a
[55:47] certain season an appointed time when
[55:50] god will display and fulfill all these
[55:53] scriptures the rest of the scriptures
[55:56] that is supposed to be fulfilled
[55:59] we're talking about our season and our
[56:01] time i don't mean of the end all the
[56:04] entire scriptures because the scriptures
[56:05] concerning tribulation this and that we
[56:08] are not in there so but we are to
[56:10] fulfill all the scriptures for our day
[56:13] our time our season that's what i'm
[56:16] talking about amen praise god remember
[56:20] that see he had to wait
[56:23] first for an extra gift
[56:27] he had to wait also and watch for a
[56:30] certain pharaoh to come to the troll
[56:34] hallelujah don't we have to do the same
[56:37] thing
[56:38] don't we have to watch for that new
[56:40] pharaoh
[56:41] that will come to the troll that will
[56:44] have a jezebel behind him
[56:47] that will have something like that
[56:49] influencing him and directing him
[56:52] oh my what a season in a time you don't
[56:56] know what money uh manipulations taking
[56:59] place behind the scenes right now
[57:02] do you know how many trillions of
[57:04] dollars americans will need to borrow
[57:07] where are they going to borrow it from
[57:10] from the jews are they going to borrow
[57:12] it from the catholics but the prophet
[57:16] has prophesied that is what they're
[57:18] going to have to do
[57:21] he says they're going to get all the
[57:23] paper and the bonds and get that from
[57:25] the jews but they got to go and get the
[57:27] gold from the catholics
[57:31] right they'll get the gold there now
[57:34] know this
[57:35] a certain pharaoh has to be on the troll
[57:38] throne and
[57:41] most of it
[57:42] their people
[57:44] must be wanting and hungering
[57:47] for the
[57:48] true bread of life
[57:51] amen
[57:53] they're not hungering yet fully
[57:55] uh some of them start to get little
[57:57] inklings
[57:58] that something is wrong
[58:00] and as little hungering and stirring has
[58:03] taken place in their hearts that they
[58:04] really want the truth
[58:06] many of them who wander from church to
[58:09] church searching for what they think is
[58:11] the truth starting to get tired and they
[58:14] start to get hungry now for something
[58:17] real solid they can't live anymore on in
[58:21] the words of the prophet uh by drinking
[58:24] the soup
[58:25] made from the shadow of
[58:27] a
[58:28] some
[58:28] uh what's it the shadow of a sin
[58:33] chicken
[58:34] no
[58:34] they can't live on that anymore that old
[58:37] woman that live in the shoe put them to
[58:39] bed
[58:41] my goodness give them a cup of soup like
[58:45] that and just want to put them all into
[58:48] a religious sleep but not the real bride
[58:51] the real bride clearly sees the word of
[58:54] god hallelujah amen
[58:57] why so they have to we they have to wait
[59:00] this bride this is what she's doing
[59:02] right now
[59:04] gotta wait
[59:05] when the people are gonna start
[59:07] hungering
[59:08] and thirsting and i'm saying some of
[59:10] them already started
[59:12] amen first they were pushing you away
[59:14] they don't wanna hear nothing they don't
[59:16] wanna hear this they're going to come
[59:19] right and begin to ask you
[59:22] they're going to begin to question you
[59:24] about the faith out of the word of god
[59:28] amen believe it mark it it's the truth
[59:32] hallelujah the people have to be
[59:35] hungering and wanting the bread of life
[59:39] amen and thirsting for that
[59:43] amen now we find when that happens there
[59:47] will also be
[59:49] many sign seekers
[59:52] all across the land now this is the
[59:54] false prophets and spirits jesus was
[59:56] speaking up
[59:58] in matthew 24 around that same time when
[1:00:02] the people heading to go and and get the
[1:00:04] real bread and the truth he sends a host
[1:00:07] of them devils to confuse the issue
[1:00:11] and to blind the people misdirect the
[1:00:14] people away from the word of god and let
[1:00:17] me add one word here to confuse them
[1:00:21] have their mind confused about what is
[1:00:25] the truth
[1:00:26] hallelujah that they are really
[1:00:28] searching for
[1:00:30] amen and so
[1:00:32] we see
[1:00:34] that a whole generation of sign seekers
[1:00:38] in this last day
[1:00:40] has been created
[1:00:43] created the atmosphere where that's what
[1:00:45] people are hungering and thirsting for
[1:00:48] not for the bread
[1:00:50] of life which without which men
[1:00:53] can't live
[1:00:54] but they're hungering for signs
[1:00:56] and greater signs and greater wonders to
[1:01:00] take place amen hallelujah but see
[1:01:05] they they they want that but they know
[1:01:08] nothing about the true move of god in
[1:01:12] his word in these last days
[1:01:16] they know nothing about that amen oh my
[1:01:21] think of it
[1:01:22] look just as jesus said in matthew 24
[1:01:25] the two spirits will be so close
[1:01:28] together
[1:01:29] amen
[1:01:30] oh my i wonder how close that is amen
[1:01:34] how can you tell them apart when it says
[1:01:38] they will deceive the very elected
[1:01:42] if it was possible
[1:01:44] that means that thing is so close
[1:01:47] that if you did not have the journal of
[1:01:51] god in you the gene of god in you you'll
[1:01:54] be carried away
[1:01:56] like everybody else anybody else
[1:01:59] if god had not tied you to that type
[1:02:03] post in glory you would have been swept
[1:02:06] away like everybody else amen but thank
[1:02:10] god his his gene keeps us his germ holds
[1:02:15] us
[1:02:15] my ankle holds beyond the veil praise

[1:02:44] course this thing is so deceiving that
[1:02:46] you have people all in the message are
[1:02:49] saying the same thing i'm saying here

[1:02:52] talking about the just the written word
[1:02:55] test they're talking about the visible
[1:02:57] word test they're not talking about the
[1:02:59] spirit of god
[1:03:01] in your heart and give you a revelation
[1:03:04] of that word and you test them by that
[1:03:08] amen to see where they're at oh how can

[1:04:31] talking to them he says just speak the
[1:04:34] word and stand back and listen wait and
[1:04:37] you will see from the answer whether or
[1:04:41] not they have a real seed germ in them
[1:04:46] you will know
[1:04:47] amen see
[1:04:49] oh my you see now that has to happen for
[1:04:52] the first bride
[1:04:54] was the seed
[1:04:56] amen
[1:04:58] and the second bride
[1:05:00] also was the sea
[1:05:04] amen
[1:05:05] now i'm i've got to go over i think it
[1:05:07] is into
[1:05:09] satan's eden
[1:05:11] where he said
[1:05:13] just as
[1:05:14] the eve
[1:05:17] met satan
[1:05:19] in the form
[1:05:21] of a man
[1:05:23] whom we call or know as a serpent
[1:05:27] and spoke to him
[1:05:30] and was deceived by him face to face
[1:05:34] he said so will this bride of the last
[1:05:37] day
[1:05:38] meet satan face to face
[1:05:41] and he's going to speak to her and tell
[1:05:44] lies to her
[1:05:45] but that doesn't mean there's one man
[1:05:47] he's talking about all these false
[1:05:49] prophets and preachers claiming to be
[1:05:52] you know that they have the truth even
[1:05:54] in the message they claim they have the
[1:05:56] fullness of the word and then they'll
[1:05:58] come to you and they'll say wonderful
[1:06:00] things and you can't deny it you've got
[1:06:02] to say amen you gotta praise the lord
[1:06:03] amen then you see go off a little here
[1:06:06] hallelujah and you begin to recognize
[1:06:09] right you you re you realize the
[1:06:11] psychology that's being taught here you
[1:06:13] realize the religious knowledge that's
[1:06:16] been given over here you realize that
[1:06:18] these little things it's wonderful and
[1:06:21] you just leave them because they got to
[1:06:23] play their part
[1:06:25] you understand
[1:06:27] to bring it practical
[1:06:30] the snakes got to play their part
[1:06:33] uh like i've told it of before they
[1:06:35] tried to kill off the mosquitoes in the
[1:06:37] swamps of
[1:06:38] uh in florida there
[1:06:40] and found that when they tried to kill
[1:06:43] that the frogs begin to die because they
[1:06:46] were living by jumping and catching
[1:06:47] those mosquitoes and then when they look
[1:06:51] the fish start to turn belly up in the
[1:06:53] water because they used to live off of
[1:06:54] the frogs who would go and sit on those
[1:06:57] lily pads and wait to jump and catch the
[1:06:59] mosquitoes so the fish start to die and
[1:07:02] then they notice alligators starting to
[1:07:04] die who used to live on the fish you
[1:07:06] know that's the ecosystem in other words
[1:07:09] right and they broke the whole thing
[1:07:12] everything whether it's a reptile
[1:07:15] whether it's this that
[1:07:17] they got their part they got to play you
[1:07:19] don't have to agree with them you don't
[1:07:21] have to love them you don't have to pick
[1:07:23] up the snake to prove
[1:07:25] nothing but the fact is they got their
[1:07:28] parts to play so god wants you to only
[1:07:30] recognize it all right it's only after
[1:07:33] that thing tries to attack you then you
[1:07:35] have to defend yourself but other than
[1:07:37] leave it alone
[1:07:39] it's all right my goodness you think
[1:07:42] that abel didn't know and that he still
[1:07:45] would shake the hand of cain and really
[1:07:48] love him not not hate him because who he
[1:07:51] was
[1:07:52] my brother praised god and he was his
[1:07:54] brother but the fact is he knew what
[1:07:57] spirit was back there
[1:07:59] he knew what germ what seed was back
[1:08:01] there
[1:08:02] and he knew how to conduct himself under
[1:08:05] those conditions of what was back there
[1:08:09] amen see the first bride deceived the
[1:08:13] second bride deceived
[1:08:15] there are deceivers now
[1:08:19] of that third bride
[1:08:25] deceivers of the third bride
[1:08:29] how
[1:08:31] by
[1:08:32] high breathing the word
[1:08:36] look in there it's telling you in there
[1:08:39] there will be some in this message
[1:08:42] because of the lack of revelation
[1:08:45] anointed once at the end of time
[1:08:47] they are going to deceive
[1:08:50] by hybriding the word mixing the word
[1:08:54] with this and with that over there
[1:08:56] mixing it together and by that they're
[1:08:59] preaching or teaching a hybrid word
[1:09:03] and every word every seed will bring
[1:09:05] forth after it's kind
[1:09:08] they can't happen that's what it's going
[1:09:09] to produce
[1:09:11] amen hallelujah oh my
[1:09:14] these are the ones that is talking about
[1:09:17] that will be so close to
[1:09:20] the elected
[1:09:22] it would deceive them
[1:09:24] if it were possible
[1:09:27] but you'll be so close you can't use
[1:09:29] your eyes to prove the difference
[1:09:31] because it's so close
[1:09:33] that lady is a christian that young man
[1:09:36] is a real believer look their works look
[1:09:39] their goodness look at the love they're
[1:09:41] displaying he says you can't even show
[1:09:43] more love than
[1:09:45] the christian scientists you you
[1:09:47] ultimately you can't show that
[1:09:50] some of them can display it more than
[1:09:51] you can but that's not it
[1:09:54] hallelujah christ in you your hope of
[1:09:56] glory
[1:09:58] amen he that is in you greater is he
[1:10:01] than he that is within the world
[1:10:04] blessed be the name of the living god
[1:10:06] hallelujah remember all of this for god
[1:10:10] has never placed signs ahead of his
[1:10:14] word you know where we are in the
[1:10:17] message now
[1:10:18] after they have gone through the cycle
[1:10:21] of preaching this message over and over
[1:10:25] and over again
[1:10:27] then
[1:10:28] they're going to now be forced to start
[1:10:31] to produce signs and wonders
[1:10:34] and miracles
[1:10:36] and then start to claim that that's the
[1:10:39] the latter rain and whatnot falling now
[1:10:43] amen my friends i want you to know that
[1:10:47] that will urge them now to start
[1:10:50] producing signs
[1:10:52] amen and place emphasis on signs amen oh
[1:10:57] my back here you see because they're
[1:10:59] placing signs because they want to say
[1:11:01] that is going to vindicate them
[1:11:04] that is going to prove that the word
[1:11:07] they are teaching is the truth
[1:11:10] later here brother branham says
[1:11:12] they
[1:11:13] want to use it as added proof of the
[1:11:16] word
[1:11:17] added proof of the word but remember the
[1:11:21] word was first before them signs
[1:11:25] the word first amen hallelujah amen
[1:11:30] never place signs ahead of this word
[1:11:34] hallelujah because the word is first
[1:11:38] hallelujah now to prove it
[1:11:41] jehovah's speaking to elijah what did he
[1:11:44] say to that woman
[1:11:45] bake me a cake
[1:11:47] first
[1:11:50] hallelujah then
[1:11:52] you watch and you will see the miracle
[1:11:55] happen
[1:11:57] see
[1:11:58] the word had to come first
[1:12:02] hallelujah and we know from this
[1:12:05] a lot of religious seducing spirits
[1:12:10] is what he's talking about
[1:12:12] you are to watch for them right within
[1:12:15] the ranks of this message
[1:12:17] is that right
[1:12:19] very intellectual
[1:12:22] very very knowledgeable
[1:12:25] in other words they're so intellectual
[1:12:27] they can memorize they can uh
[1:12:30] compare scripture quotes everything else
[1:12:33] like that my goodness
[1:12:35] they're sharp they're everything else
[1:12:38] brother sister that's what you have got
[1:12:40] to be aware of don't look at outward
[1:12:43] appearance don't look at capabilities
[1:12:46] don't look at accomplishments just look
[1:12:49] at the word listen to the word that you
[1:12:52] are hearing he says and see if that
[1:12:54] agrees with the word
[1:12:57] amen and you'll know what spirit is back
[1:13:01] there that is not to say
[1:13:04] that a brother
[1:13:06] that hasn't yet come to a full
[1:13:08] revelation of the word
[1:13:10] can't say something
[1:13:12] that that is not the word by mistake
[1:13:15] because he doesn't know
[1:13:17] he doesn't know us yet
[1:13:19] he doesn't know now but uh those are
[1:13:22] things i can't teach you the holy spirit
[1:13:24] that teach you
[1:13:25] for you to know
[1:13:27] what you're hearing what you're
[1:13:28] listening and who is speaking to you
[1:13:31] for that moment we're down to revelation
[1:13:33] not for the ages
[1:13:35] but revelation moment to moment
[1:13:39] satan hits that
[1:13:41] it's all right reading the bible i'm
[1:13:42] supposed to do this so he won't do it he
[1:13:44] already knows that right but the
[1:13:47] moment-to-moment
[1:13:48] instant when the holy spirit is working
[1:13:50] with you and in you and through you
[1:13:53] uh when you don't even know what to say
[1:13:54] and in an instant
[1:13:56] you know there's the answer comes
[1:13:58] through you or the action comes through
[1:14:01] you he has no response timing he you
[1:14:04] don't know what to do because it just
[1:14:06] happens it's already happened there's
[1:14:07] nothing you can do about it hallelujah
[1:14:10] that's where we're at right now brother
[1:14:12] sister praise god remember
[1:14:16] just like elijah
[1:14:19] the word first then watch the miracle
[1:14:22] happen
[1:14:23] and so come to the word and then watch
[1:14:26] the miracles see
[1:14:28] hallelujah
[1:14:30] for it is nothing but the seed word
[1:14:33] itself
[1:14:35] that the spirit energizes
[1:14:39] praise the lord
[1:14:40] in other words the seed the gene that's
[1:14:44] been sitting and waiting in you that is
[1:14:47] what the holy spirit energizes to
[1:14:49] produce or bring forth the miracles the
[1:14:52] signs and the wonders in his time
[1:14:56] when he wants to water it quick energize
[1:14:59] it to do something that he does it for
[1:15:01] his glory
[1:15:03] for his praise and honor hallelujah amen

[1:15:14] amen he's already come and gone he has
[1:15:17] proclaimed the word and we know as we
[1:15:20] have said before denominations hate his
[1:15:23] name

[1:15:28] you don't know it you don't realize the
[1:15:30] extent of it but they really hate his
[1:15:32] name do you have a church and you go
[1:15:35] there and you just mention his name like
[1:15:37] that they uh they'll control themselves
[1:15:39] but they're so angry and they're against
[1:15:42] that so much they won't want you coming
[1:15:44] back or being around their people
[1:15:46] anywhere like that whatsoever oh my so
[1:15:50] his name is hated by the
[1:15:52] by the denominations his message has
[1:15:55] been misunderstood
[1:15:58] by the denominations
[1:16:00] and his message
[1:16:03] is
[1:16:04] rejected just as jesus
[1:16:07] the word in flesh was rejected back then
[1:16:11] the same cycle if you want to take it
[1:16:13] again misunderstood hated and then
[1:16:16] finally rejected it's the same thing but
[1:16:19] now it's on the revealed war

[1:20:55] the word
[1:20:57] they'll misunderstand
[1:20:59] right what it is all about and he says

[1:21:58] as he was predestinated
[1:22:02] they were predestinated
[1:22:04] and they are holding to the word of god
[1:22:07] just like abraham held to the word of
[1:22:09] god in a pagan
[1:22:11] idol worshiping community and society
[1:22:14] that they were in but they could see
[1:22:16] nothing else because they heard the

[1:22:30] have called you amen but see
[1:22:33] it will repeat
[1:22:35] just like the four sport runner come
[1:22:38] from the wilderness and cried
[1:22:41] behold the lamb of god
[1:22:44] that will repeat
[1:22:45] amen he didn't say this i am now saying

[1:23:01] messenger hallelujah that will at this
[1:23:05] time
[1:23:06] behold the lamb of god
[1:23:10] praise god but we are hearing that cry
[1:23:12] already because we are seeing the word
[1:23:15] we are seeing the message unfold before
[1:23:17] us
[1:23:18] we have seen the revelation taking shape
[1:23:21] and form we see christ being revealed in
[1:23:24] his own word
[1:23:25] amen the thing is becoming personalized
[1:23:28] to everyone that sees the truth in the
[1:23:31] word of the living god hallelujah amen
[1:23:34] behold he will say
[1:23:36] the lamb of god
[1:23:38] but what he will be doing is pointing
[1:23:42] the people to see the world born bride
[1:23:48] it's right here but we weren't i never
[1:23:51] seen that before though i read the book
[1:23:52] many times over i heard the sermon but
[1:23:55] he says at that time
[1:23:58] he will be pointing the people to see
[1:24:00] what not the lamb slain back there it's
[1:24:04] the same lamb again
[1:24:06] but now he's come back in a bright form
[1:24:11] and she is going to be having a short
[1:24:13] season of display
[1:24:16] and he will be turning their attention
[1:24:19] to point in them to begin to see and
[1:24:21] recognize the bride even though she was
[1:24:23] hidden for a while even though she was
[1:24:26] behind the scene behind the veil for a
[1:24:29] while but there has to be a time she's
[1:24:31] going to be displayed for all to see and
[1:24:34] know that this is his beloved bride in
[1:24:37] that hour amen see he will point the
