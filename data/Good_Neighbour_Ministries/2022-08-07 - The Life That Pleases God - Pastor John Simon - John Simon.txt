thank you lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah these are chains of the joy this morning i could have been in another place this morning i could have been six feet out of without knowing god most important

come on pastor all my life you have been faced [Music] [Music] thank you lord we thank you for your goodness thank you for your grace father and your boundless love praise honor and glory be under god hallelujah god bless you uh i'll just please be seated just for a few moments we want to thank god for his goodness still out on their vacations i heard from the from up in africa brother emmanuel and or his wife his precious sister send their greetings to the church and they were hoping that we are well i said no i said we hope you are well and that you come back safely amen god bless them real good and all the others that may be uh out uh on their vacations wherever that may be in this stressful and chaotic system and society in which we live we do need some time to let off the physical pressures and the mental pressures of life praise god the inward man he doesn't take any pressure because that just rolls off of him like water from a duck's back because he has his blessed assurance already he has his anchor already he has already entered into the rest and so he is rested in god hallelujah knowing that whatever happens on the outside god is working things out you may not see it right away but god is working things out everything is going to work out to his will as long as we let go and surrender and let him have his way the days of fighting fussing and threatening is over it's now to rest in the face of our living god may the lord richly bless you thank you all so much praise god unless you feel led somebody with a a solo or something or you know whether it's music musician solo or something i don't know praise the lord amen god bless you i don't mean to put you all on a spot but i wanted to highlight you that we appreciate very much everything that they're doing we thank god uh i thank god before i saw this before i saw the signs in the worship leader i was praying in there and just thinking how i can see the spiritual growth in the brothers life and then then the holy spirit showed some manifestation of it not just because of the emotion but he's seeing something clearer amen he's seeing something brighter and because of that he's experiencing the growth of the holy spirit moving in his heart praise the lord amen may god bless every one of you as you come up in the grace of almighty god because it's a great thing happening praise god i don't think even you fully grasp the whiteness of it i don't grasp all the whiteness of it even though i may have a wider insight or understanding but what uh the holy spirit is not trying to do what he is doing uh right now is trying to change our minds and our hearts from the years and years of system systems and and what they have placed in us to come out of that and walk in the liberty of jesus christ without being fearful or wondering because we come to rest on systems right and even in churches messes groups everybody there they got to have everything apparently to the eyes and mind in place and everything has to be like that now you've got to have that to survive in the world in which we live well when we come to god's the sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god and uh the spirit blows like the wind wherever it wants to go that's when it's out of your hand but he has a system and he knows no matter how it looks to you and how he's blowing you around or moving you don't worry about that he knows exactly where this part of the jigsaw plus is going to fit where that's going to fit where that's going to fit this might look like an odd piece but it's going to fit and when it all comes out to the end is christ being revealed in his own word so rest in him have confidence in him walk in faith praise god we have moved away from the uh from the lamb and we're moving into the anointing of the great lion of the tribe of judah judgment is coming praise god first it was salvation redemption and that sort of thing but it's moving away right into the of the judgments of god and and the anointing of the great lion of the tribe of judah praise god so we are resting on that and trusting god that he will fulfill his word through us for this hour as we live to fulfill the rest of all righteousness all the word uh to be fulfilled praise god forevermore may the lord bless you as we wanna uh by god's grace talk on a simple topic apparently simple topic that says the life that pleases god the life that pleases god and our scripture uh let me see here where we place that praise the lord is right in the bible here anyway it's uh hebrews 11 reading from verses 5 to 6. shall we read together yours is up you can read it everyone can see it praise the lord hallelujah by faith enoch was translated he was changed a translation is not an instant thing but he was being changed as he walked with god that he should not see death praise the lord and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him praise the lord god bless us as we meditate on these things father we just read from your word out of hebrews 11. and we just want to ask you if you will just grant us grace that both speaker and hearer will come into oneness and that the precious words of god will just begin to flow the great ever-present waters from the rock will begin to flow out upon us oh god and keep us refresh us as we live by the uh oh god the rivers of living waters and to you be all praise honor and glory in the name of jesus christ amen and amen the life that pleases god plea please be seated now even if you hear things that you've heard before god has this way of doing things and every teacher knows that in doing things that a repetition even if you read the scriptures you will find even the story like of solomon or david or this one it repeats in the bible uh what he tells them in exodus you hear the new numbers and you hear it in deuteronomy and you know it does he's doing that because he always says don't let these things you know go from your ears don't let it go away from your generations don't let it see what he's trying to do is that he will have the word not past but but but that the word will abide in you right it won't leave you and it will be there and pass from your conscience to your subconscious and then you're moving into another dimension where it's effortless no more fighting working or having to wonder how things are going to be praise the lord so i'm going to go to wisdom versus space and we're going to take our i'm going to try to take my time in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word that was with god was god i'm quoting all of this that i just said is quoting that's not the bible i'm reading out of but that's just a quote continuing the that word was in god and it was god it was his thoughts that was in him and they were there always god's thoughts then is as eternal as he is eternal oh my he says that ain't no skim milk that ain't no soup made with the shadow of a skinny chicken [Laughter] oh my now he says here it comes now listen are you ready for this now remember them thoughts god's thoughts was his word now it says in the beginning now when i say in the beginning in eternity now how could that come together in the beginning then he says yes in eternity now wow now think about it see he says when the beginning first started now what he's talking about here again now i'm speaking by the holy spirit that eternity he's talking about in the beginning when time started that's what he's called in the beginning there when time started because there had to be a time of time or place where time begins to count and it started right so time started back in eternity it's not eternal but it started there in eternity in the beginning when it first started then he says time then he goes back to so you see in the beginning and if i might put this when time started amen was the word the thoughts already become words from right then back there right now god's thoughts this is what he says right after and the word was with god do you have the quote that you can put it up uh praise god i know you love what you're hearing but let's be awake and recognize so that they can follow this clearly amen see and the word was with god and that word was god his thoughts he wants to make sure that everybody those people at that time recognize of course we know most of them didn't recognize but he says them thoughts was god for his thoughts is what he was praise the lord and this is it you are them thoughts praise the lord he says it's right here wisdom versus faith and you are them thoughts that was in god before the beginning that was in him and with him and the lord was with god and the word was god hallelujah of course we know all the word was in one man at one time named jesus christ hallelujah but now god true ages have brought it down taken away from the rib part of the word itself and out of that part of the has created a world bride through seven ages until she has now come to the fullness of her stature and she's taking her stand upon the word of god and recognizing that the ward is her headship her husband or the one who has leadership and preeminence over her life oh thank god for you thank god for me thank god for a people anywhere and everywhere that not just says these things but has a clear inward revelation of what has happened what is happening praise god and can receive it with a thankful and gracious heart unto god amen she and them thoughts is what he was and you are them thoughts that's you too see and god's thoughts rem and your peace says repeat and god's thoughts was his word and that word was with him and that word was in him and it was all god praise god hallelujah no matter how the word and more fed itself down to one man and then to a many member body all through the whole process from god to one man through melchizedek coming down there starting to end more faith from melchizedek and the divine condescension down to jesus christ emmanuel and then down to a bride amen hallelujah in other words he's saying no way along this process did god stop or cease to be god but it was god and is god all the way through that's why he kept saying you don't really recognize who you really are you don't realize what's really happening why why do you feel so ordinary about it because you are that right it's like me telling you do you know that you are you you understand which is what i'm telling you now that's why it seems just ordinary i'm telling danny that he's danny so so what about that i'm telling you that you were in god but you see when you recognize the enormity of it when you get in the quietness and you begin to think of it and what god has done and what he is doing and why you are in this world available to him for him to fulfill his divine purpose and use whenever he wants to there are some prophets in the bible the name isn't mentioned a certain man of god went here certain man of god went there and you never hear of them again even if it's one time in your entire life god wants to use you for one one thing and after that nothing that's his purpose fulfilled and you need to just walk with confidence praising god giving glory because you've done what you're supposed to do another one might god might put him in a place like isaiah or jeremiah make them prominent make them recognizable and stuff like that in their name coming up often and often praise god that's because that's what he's got predestinated on purpose for that that individual that word amen praise god so don't worry about it because god's all god's words are one as i've always said whether he wants to use this word in the morning this one midday and one in the evening light praise god it's the same salvation the apostle paul doesn't have a bigger salvation than you have nobody in the bible will have a larger salvation and you have larger eternal life because we all get the same pay regardless how much work we do we all get the same pay so what i'm getting away from you is any complex don't let the devil knock you with any complex oh you don't know the bible oh you don't know all of the message oh i didn't know that quote i look so bad i didn't know this god didn't ask you what you know he asked you who you believe amen that's what he wants to know who do you believe the word of god regardless of who you are where you come from if you are one of them raise your hands praise the lord give glory and praise and honor let us adore him let us adore him christ the lord amen lord of god amen oh my yes sir oh my praise god now then god can come down here and find eternal life by hearing his own word praise god understand god can come down here and recognize himself in you when you hear his own word it's not wonderful god hearing his own word praise the lord beautiful how beautiful to the true believer that you would not have i mean you had heard words words words read all kinds of books and everything as well i love to read so and my father was a great reader and encouraged us to do a lot of reading from bhagavad gitas to sanskrit to this to that too all kinds of different things but you know not till the words of this prophet amen and we now know we're not talking about the words of the man william branham but we're talking about the words of the spirit that spoke through the prophet and that struck our souls that struck my soul and something in me could recognize that's not just a word of a man that them them revelations and truths that that man is speaking are so close close close one after the other quick quick quick there right there no human mind could orchestrate that or put that together that's got to be a higher mind that's going to be a greater mind and the only one that's greater is god himself hallelujah and i recognize right then that that's the voice of god speaking in this last day amen praise god and not knowing about all this stuff about profit and this and that right away inside i say my goodness i gotta let everything drop all bible college education drop not that you lose it and you don't remember it but that is not your priority and premier preminence anymore your priority and your preeminence is on the lord to obey the war to live by the lord hallelujah amen look education and wisdom and knowledge is important i don't want to like oh messages a lot of message preachers that kill incentive for education killing center for wisdom and knowledge and the prophet wasn't doing that either he was trying to tell you them things are good but but you've got to be like paul you got to be able to know when to just drop leave the other side and listen to the word because sometimes not sometimes most of the times the word will go beyond your intelligence because it's not speaking from this position is speaking from the position of him who sits high and looks down low one whose mind and thoughts are above our thoughts praise god so now and again he gives you a little idea he gives you a little revelation you know gives you a something there oh my i got something big yeah but it's something tiny to him it's it's nothing to him your thoughts are below my thoughts all your princes and your wifes man you put them in a bucket said they're just like a drop of water in a bucket see so that's the way it is just relax rely on him because he says don't think let me do the thinking for you praise the lord i don't mean you're going to walk around like a zombie i don't mean you're going to walk around like an empty-headed person but i'm just saying you've got to be able to come to a place when you're put in a corner by satan rejoice because now i i don't have to even think or you're going to start out by thinking and figuring and then you're going to find you can't go further and then you just relax and you let go and let god have his way and then something supernatural the father that dwelleth in me he'll do the talking he'll do the speaking he'll do work everything out for his glory and honor because it's not of me or from me it's just going through me praise god and i'm resting on that by the grace of god hallelujah i don't know about you but something got a hold of me amen oh my praise god hallelujah so now we understand why we can see clearly now amen because it's god in us hearing his own word and that takes us out the spiritual amnesia is that right because he is hearing his own word which already was heard from before the foundation of the world and this is why wednesday night i mentioned about our last sunday that is why abraham could recognize because he hadn't seen the person but he heard the voice they called him and said come out and go to this so when the voice now changed to a melchizedek position in a human inner body wasn't yet a human but it was theophonic body and uh he spoke to him spoke to abraham and the moment he heard the voice coming out there not melchizedek how he looked on his form and shape but he recognized the voice that the same one that called him is the same one that's speaking to him amen and he was able to surrender right away though the bible will show you he said my lord that means he recognized he recognized who that was right away amen that was that was the king of kings king of salem king of peace king of righteousness king god he knew it all and he recognized who melchizedek was amen praise god now in the beginning was the word he's going all back over this thing again it was the word and the word don't let don't forget he doesn't want us to forget that or not recognize it and remember the word was god hallelujah and that word was made flesh i i'm going to take a pause here there was a man that was very weird to a lot of people uh he used to be called they used to call him father divine and he used to be saying a strange thing that god is in me and i am god but you see a lot of people didn't recognize fully what he was saying when they start flocking around him and trying to worship him but that man signs wonders miracles all kinds of things they even locked him up in a jail for saying that and when they go into the security prison all locked up he had a grand piano and he was playing his music and there was a big table with all kind of feasts on it and he was eaten from it and it was real food because they go in they want to know how he get all this stuff in there see they couldn't believe but brother brother mentioned his name too not that he want to go and uh highlight this guy but he mentioned his name one time right uh how god with this man at that particular time because that's what he believed even if you have it in a twisted up messed up way but he was on the right road and those things were beginning to happen with him but i want you to say i want you to recognize there is a reality to this this is not some mythical thing we're talking about we are not talking about some mythical thing we're talking about the unfailing reality of the living god satan tries to get you to believe because you don't see god it could be a myth it could be a dream you maybe you had a dream or a vision or maybe you had a good thought last night or uh you know the preacher is just suggesting some some imagination imaginary thing to you but the prophet made it clear no when you recognize this rest on it it's the unfailing reality of the living god moving in your midst praise god forevermore hallelujah amen see that word was god and you see that same word was made flesh do you believe that that same word was made flesh if you want to run it in your mind it was made flesh in jesus christ and now hallelujah and now it's made flesh again in you and me now you can go find other quotes where he says and now the word is being made flesh and flesh is being made world amen praise god hallelujah amen see that word was made flesh god starts now being expressed in human bodies praise god i believe that's happening right now i believe god is being expressed right now in human bodies praise god now you're going to see a little bit more as i go along where i'm going the only life that pleases god hallelujah and if you might understand just give you a hint it's his own life his own life is the only life that could please him his own life is the only life that's perfect his own life is the only life that is pleasing to him that's the life that pleases god hallelujah and that's the life is telling you it's in you already but if you want it to manifest don't you try to do it let me do it because i am that life i am the truth the way and the life hallelujah and let that life manifest itself through you amen praise god hallelujah see oh and that word made flesh amen and dwelt among us amen and i put a note there first in jesus christ now made flesh in us hallelujah amen now if you have eternal life today then now if he repeats now if you have full eternal life today you are in god hallelujah and by god himself also being in you you are in him and he is in you and that's jesus talked about that in that day you're gonna know i'm in the father the father in me i and you and you and me praise god see you will begin to recognize that hallelujah that you're not just believing in a god that's outside of you but god is in you and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world hallelujah there you are oh my praise god yes sir you see you are now god's expressed thoughts praise the lord he says my and then thoughts don't listen to any reasonings oh my my my oh my god why would they listen to the reasonings they are the word you can say in other words let's go back and show you what i'm talking about when jesus was up on a mountain in the mountain temptation and satan come to him and tell him commit suicide cast yourself off this mountain and because it's written in the scriptures you know and you'll bear you up if you let the dash yourself against the the stone that's that is just as much as if saying the bible says if you drink any deadly thing you shall not hurt you so drink this bottle of of poison here and god promised that you're going to be healed you see that's a lot of mis things among so-called believers they they're it's yes that's the written word you're reading it there but it's not the revealed word you don't understand what god is telling you amen so here it is we find friends that this god uh who has expressed thoughts and they don't have to listen to no reason because they are the very word themselves revealed or manifested or expressed so why would they listen to the reasonings of man and even if they do it's because of patience and temperance they listen and then when they're done they'll speak one word or two words or speak whatever father puts in their mouth and it settles it all is that right amen praise god they don't take in reasonings of man amen and that's because they know they're a part of god hallelujah and reasonings can't prevail against the holy spirit re he's already overcome reasonings can prevail against the living word that's in the true believer praise the name of the lord hallelujah amen hallelujah so my god i'm so thankful that i am a part of the word amen and that i was in him before the beginning at the beginning and after the beginning i was with him all the time you were with him and in him all the time praise be to god hallelujah amen and so we are as uh we say i am going through i'm going through doesn't matter what others do i am going through praise the lord oh my there are many start in the race hallelujah but with all the pressures all the problems refuse to keep peace amen others accept it when this message appeared to be like no here's something new something attractive it's fresh you know it's a fresh blood or flower come out and the butterflies are flying around but after a while the days start to get hot it get ordinary the message feels like uh the dry bread that was in the wilderness well we've been eating this dry bread that was supernatural bread you know coming down every night but it's start to get ordinary we want this dry bread anymore we we want to get them them kind of uh things we used to have in pentecost we want to have onions and we want to have a leek and garlic and all these spicy things that will spice up the service and spice up the song service and spice up everything and oh my so they don't realize they want to satisfy the flesh and you know not that your flesh shouldn't get enjoyment in the house of god but we're not here to satisfy the flesh we are here to crucify the flesh and let the spirit of god live within us we we're here to sacrifice that and let the spirit of god live within us and he receives all the praise and the honor and the glory praise god hallelujah amen hallelujah how thankful we are that by hearing these things these revelations we are enabled to express god's life you see because formally or formerly the germ life or the gene of god that was in us could not express itself uh it could not express itself at all and in some cases it couldn't express itself fully uh because we are allowing the flesh was preeminent over it and the preempt the desires of the flesh in other words our desires was not so much for the word as for the things that were out there amen it was there because that's what society put for us you got to achieve this your ambition for that you got to have this you got to climb to this height you got to do that you got to do this you got to do that and then the focus is lost amen it's not intentional it's not wickedness but it's just off of the plan of god has for us amen and so the gene was suppressed or oppressed or let's put it this way the the the gene was imprisoned in these prison of flesh and bars of bone and and and bound in there amen like that praise god hallelujah amen but by the new work that we have received hallelujah amen by the revelation of the lord the revelation of the word opened the prison bars amen and set us free the same bright light that appeared in the prison where tall walls and prison doors open one night it's that same light that has come back to open up the prison doors of the mind and heart hallelujah and set you free amen that you can have boneless expression boneless freedom in the grace of god hallelujah now you'll come even more creative than you think you were before even naturally you become more creative because this is secondary but you're going at such a height that these other things are simply going to just happen around you amen and you don't even know why they're happening but it's all happening praise god you become more because we are after his kind right and he's a creator he is the creator so you can't help being creative you can help by having understanding of certain matters and things like that it's not by uh my brain's trust what is my my trust in him that we are able to do these things by his grace praise the name of the lord god hallelujah amen praise god thank god that god's attributes are now free i say thank god i am free say it i want you to say it verbalize it vocalize it thank god i am free say thank god i am free amen praise god hallelujah [Applause] now we step over to the future home of the heavenly bride and ortly bride praise god now in the beginning was the word the word was made flesh and dwelt among us see that's three stages of the same word amen three stages right you know we talked a little bit that would come down from god to jesus and then warfare right on down to jesus and now it comes down into the bright three stages of the same word amen praise god see oh my just think of it there he was god but that word it was an attribute first hallelujah in him was and was god it was god and when he talked of himself he thought of himself becoming human so the stages of it there you go god attribute down flesh come down to be human here on the face of the earth you understand now why i didn't want to speed up i don't want to really like preach preach preach but just so that you get it amen praise the lord hallelujah now at one time we know all them thoughts came down here and was gathered up in one human being whose name was jesus christ and that is why the bible tells us that in him was all of the god head bodily right all all them thoughts all them words all of that was in him bodily praise the lord just like all my father's generations or it was all in him bodily until the time came for them to be expressed it's upright praise the name of the lord hallelujah amen so then we find out what we have now is god expressing himself in human flesh praise the lord amen and so jesus was chosen uh to be the body because you know jesus jesus not jesus christ but jesus the man he was not eternal see he was a man like you and me but he was a god man because god in him is eternal and that god that was in him said even if you kill this body i raise it up in three days praise god raise it up in three days praise god your body is not eternal but you still have a resurrection you still have the holy spirit and you doing the same thing the first seed did but for god's glory amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah amen so uh he planted himself in the ground not to go for all of that he said i'm the seed and the seed goes in the ground they come another thousand fold and and so on like that so and when it comes back up a thousand fold a lot of people are still looking at the original seed back there and that's what they're doing they're looking at jesus back there with without form without comeliness and they're missing him same yesterday today and forever appearing amongst human beings again because the sun is up the seeds are being dermatized and they are up now they're growing and it's him again expressing himself true human beings but not in one body in a many-membered body called the bride and she and him are the same material for god did not take another piece of ground but god took a part of him to make her illustrating that that's what he did in heaven he didn't find some other material somewhere else but he took a part of himself and put that in us that you would have a portion a part of god hallelujah you have a an ingredient in you that you can't even explain what it is you don't even you just know that god is in me praise god hallelujah amen god and me i love him and he loves me he talks to me i'm i talk to him and he talks to me the two of us my god in me oh thank god i'm so happy for god in me greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world hallelujah amen oh praise god and now he appears again in flesh god in flesh appearing amen and once again isaiah 53 there is no nothing to be desired of him god in simplicity he's just ordinary human being it's just you you call yourself messiah we know you are you born in jamaica i know you you come from new zealand i know your brother you says yeah you know this man but you don't know the man inside amen you no man has seen god at any time is that right have you ever seen me you've seen my representation outside but the person that's talking to you you've never seen paul said then we're going to know as we are known but not now because you're still in this flesh amen praise god but you'll see the real person then praise the lord amen and the prophet explained to us then it's not going to be old it's not going to be wrinkled it's not going to be this it's not going to be that you're going to be in the height of your powers 21 years 18 to 21 years old and in your full strength never to grow all never the weep never to cry never to die hallelujah because you are walking in eternal life amen praise be to god hallelujah amen god appearing again manifesting again through his attributes that he put down on his earth vessels that was prepared before the foundation of the world so he could declare himself to a wicked chaotic and evil generation days of lot and noah repeating again with your with your few your little flock your fewness is like noah in this wicked chaotic age crying out and calling the people repentance by the word of god hallelujah and soon the door is about to be closed and the voice crying redemption over amen it's all done amen it's all over with now praise god and moves away from the great intercession and the precious blood of the lamb right to the judgments and fires of almighty god hallelujah that's right where we are brother sister amen amen praise god forever amen hallelujah oh praise god aren't you glad to know this hallelujah amen and what are we supposed to be doing what is your purpose on this earth and what are we supposed to be doing it's come down to this simple you are here just to walk around expressing god manifesting god manifested sons and daughters of the living god hey man you don't have to worry about nothing you're god's billboards you you're god's uh your god's flashing red light because when they see how you take and act in certain situations and things like that they they don't want to admit it but they take certain things from off of you and you don't care because you like the lily brother bran said the lily and the flowers should they just spill their perfume on the breeze anybody wants to smell it use it whatever let them use it praise god hallelujah because there's always more where that came from so what are they worried about they just rest in his grace hallelujah praise god hallelujah they don't want to put their arms around this oh my oh my this is my message this revelation was never given out before but god has given it to me oh no no no no no it's all his yes i didn't learn that now since was a young man praying the holy spirit said i'm mecca you know this but while i'm doing this hair with you i'm letting it out in the atmosphere and other men women all around this world we don't know where but there's one here one there that's catching the same thing you catching now so don't you think on the exclusivity that raised yourself up you got this you got that you got nothing all you got is me amen and that's all we ought to know is we have him is that right we have him and when we have him we got everything praise god glory to god hallelujah oh my remember joshua praise the lord now we know that stipe of the holy spirit started giving out lands and say this portion has belonged to this tribe this portion and he's given all the tribes portions and when he came down to the levites so well you know there's nothing um for you he said what nothing for us how come we got nothing he says no because you god wants you to be levites and all these other tribes are going to pay what we call a tithe and that is going to be your portion so that portion i'm going to let them give it to me that's the lord's portion but that portion that's the lord whether it's be the the you know a half of a lamb or a piece of a goat or a piece of a sheep or a piece of a butchered uh cow or whatever you know or that is my portion and i am going to turn around and take my portion and give it to you is that right and so uh that is what we have to understand the lord is your portion is that right the lord is your portion just say the lord is my portion the lord is my portion and if i have him i have everything [Applause] you understand praise god i'm just going to touch that a little bit and go back to my original thing you see wha what would you rather to have brother branham speaks a little bit about this once i wanted the blessing but now i want the lord amen is that right once i wanted healing no i want the word you see it's not that you don't want healing it's not that you don't want those things anymore but your focus is the word and these signs shall follow follow it'll just come amen come into your life in a wonderful marvelous way praise god forevermore so i thank god that i prefer not to just enjoy the products that that are coming to me but i prefer to own the factory is that right i don't want a timber full of water when i can own the whole ocean why why would i want just little things little things here and there which will temporarily satisfy me but i have the lord as my porsche and i give him praise and honor and glory for that and the beauty of it is that we love to sing it but we don't get the full revelation of it he was there all the time he was there all the time amen waiting patiently waiting patiently for us to come to this place to recognize that he was there all the time you're running a run everywhere searching in this denomination that church this church that is searching everywhere hallelujah but he was there in you all the time waiting patiently for this hour and this time when he would make himself known to you that you the father and i are one you and me we are one hallelujah praise peter god lord of god hallelujah amen so praise god from the day we left heaven's glories amen we were always under our heavenly father's watchful care you believe it watchful care his watchful provision uh uh protective and and watching over us and brother branham just says it's simple he says oh you see uh when that eagle knows it has young ones it it sometimes will take them allow them to go in the valley you know we are in the valley of the shadow of death that's what we passing through now he says but uh when she does that she doesn't just leave them there in the valley sit sitting on the croc of a rock and looking at them with a sharp eagle eye but everything they do whether they're pecking bugs or playing a rung or jumping around he says our eagle sits on the rock and she's watching there amen hallelujah so god's protective eye is watching over us he didn't let us come down here we are unprotected we are unguided he's not watching god knows god cares god loves and god is watching over us with tender care hallelujah protections and everything else is there praise god hallelujah then when certain things happen you know nothing can happen to the true seed of god unless god allows it to happen that is why when the guy felt more than david when the other one threw spare when the other one did this he and the soul just got a kill said no leave him hallelujah if david was here you tell you he was predestinated to do that he he couldn't do it unless he was allowed to do it so so who am i that i'm going to hinder what what purpose god trying to fulfill leave the guy alone hallelujah i don't love him particularly i don't this but i love the word and the word is letting him do that so leave him alone praise god oh how wonderful to know that we have entered into this rest and that we don't have to fight to fulfill the perfection of christ in us for he is the perfect one that lives in us amen praise god hallelujah so brothers all we need to do is open up our hearts amen and when we go to prayer said lord i open my heart my life that you might come into my life continue to reveal yourself through me that you might use me as a an instrument for your glory for your purpose to fulfill your word hallelujah amen and let's strive to stay in the word amen remember the message i preached years ago keep the change the change has come on you don't let weeds grow over it amen it doesn't mean that you're not a believer anymore but you allow weeds to grow over you've got to tear off the weeds so that everything can open up for the glory of god hallelujah we don't want to be a weed or infested garden we want to be a god if you want to put it in the modern tone secret garden a god's garden hallelujah with all kinds of flowers for his glory amen hallelujah amen so stay in the word hallelujah i'm not talking about the written word when i say stain the word that's part of it but stay in that dimension of life you have entered into the unwritten word you've entered into the life the pillar of fire that don't appear around you like fire but he is here he's here all the time move in that dimension at all times move in god's life hallelujah amen and then when you move in that realm then it isn't you that's doing anything it's christ through you that is uh fulfilling his word and doing everything for his glory hallelujah amen because in actual fact he's done it already and you were just doing what he says and you're walking in obedience hallelujah knowing that him and you you'll overcome hallelujah praise the name of the lord glory to god thank god this is going to get easier you know hallelujah living the christian life it's already gotten easier for all of us once we come to understand the shackles of the mind and heart fall off you're not bound anymore you don't have handcuffs and you don't have ball and chain on your leg anymore praise the lord hallelujah and we can rest in his marvelous grace amen hallelujah amen we don't have to go around trying to burst our brains and feel embarrassed because i can't recall this quote i can't remember the scripture exactly you know you're not men are the letters all right you have no lld or what not after your names now you just got you know the real ba you know you're born again and you're free from sin [Laughter] but you can you can take the other one if you like it the one that means bad attitude but if you come into him you're really born again by the grace of god hallelujah praise god son now you've come to find that the truth has found you or you found the truth you are not wandering around anymore not only physically but in your mind you're not wondering about this and wondering about that you're not wandering around anymore amen oh praise god where did where did he say that i should have my dress at the right length where did he say that i i shouldn't have tight very tight pants on where did he say this you see the believers now free from that not that it isn't there anymore that you can't go back and check on it and what if you want to do amen praise god you don't have to go and check on all those things put your dress down do this do that don't do this and don't do that you're not go no more walking around because we are not a people of religious laws we are a people of the world and the word rules our lives amen and we're not working anything we're not straining anything we are not struggling we are resting amen it makes you so humble resting in the grace of the living god amen you don't even care what i wonder what anybody else says or what anybody else thinks you only know only what the spirit speaks and what the word says and what the word thinks that is what you're really resting on praise god why because you're living in a dimension you're living in a realm and revelation put you there revelation put you in those heavenly places this is what revelation put your mind your heart your being into that those heavenly places and you're living in that praise god amen oh wonderful praise god hallelujah amen and so when you live in that dimension and the dead angel begins to pass when he looks what does he see he sees the and the blood is in the blood and the devil in other words the dead angel sees the life of christ projecting through the believer and when i see the blood i'll pass over you but i see that life over in you if i pass right over you amen that life is blameless that life is perfect that life is without spot without wrinkle i'm passing right over this because oh praise god the blood is on the doorpost the life is in there amen and he'll pass right over you that's the reason why you are not uh he delivered and believeth on me though he appeared to be dead in the flesh yet he lives amen oh my because i live you live because i'm eternal you eternal amen praise god hallelujah how wonderful to know praise god hallelujah that that wonderful word has woke us up by revelation out of our spiritual amnesia and we have started to remember who we really are where we come from who your real father is natural father natural mother god use them to bring a physical body here but you the person that's there you back there who is your real father oh the prophet said oh uh when the great revelation struck him he says now i realize oh i am not just the child of charles and elibranum oh great jehovah i come to thee amen praise god then the bible became a new bible praise god because now he looked from the eyes of a man where he's got to do this that that but now he's looking at it from the eyes of god god in him looking back at the written word god in him hearing his own word and he knows which whether is his word or is not his word that he's hearing you know if it's mixed up if it's hybrid or whatever he'll know it that's why he said just a minute or two minutes like that the true believer when they recognize he says no more you cannot deceive them the elect will never and can't be deceived right because they are that word and they recognize the word the deep will always call back to the deep and the deep will have to respond praise god forevermore blessed be his name amen oh praise god that that uh wonderful effects of revelation puts you into the realm of perfect realization puts you in the realm of perfect love amen gives you all the perfections of jesus christ and of course you are there with perfect faith glory to god hallelujah amen but we have moved on to the realms where oh you let down your dress you start wearing a more regular pants rather than tight skinny pants that is you know they last the scene just pull everything close together and then you're walking around driving around the place like that no something in you already speaking to you and telling you that's not right that's not appropriate you shouldn't do that that's more powerful than the pastor coming on preaching a hellfire sermon off the pulpit is that right now scorch your hide and blast you to bits and you drop you you know there's a time for that because then the man got a blast rocks and everything from around you before you can get to the real diamonds you see but we are not there now praise the lord we're not there anymore brother danny praise the lord we god give god grace and praise for that hallelujah uh and we are not just doing things because brother branham said it oh brother branham said that brother brandon said that that's fine that's okay and that serves its purpose my father said this my father said that my father told me this but even in natural life that while the child gets to a place now or praise god where everything kicks in and they begin to see things and get their own experiences praise god and so the maturity of the world begins to move hallelujah and the believers begin to see themselves in the mirror and recognize what god is telling them hallelujah amen it becomes just standard you you just it's just part of your whole makeup you don't have to be told this and told that that adult child knows what they got to do you have to tell them order them this that because the holy spirit now has taken control joshua has taken preeminence jesus has taken headship hallelujah and now the bride walks in submission to him the word written and living working with the word praise god hallelujah and so we know that jesus christ has produced the only person who has produced i shouldn't say that but i'll come back to that afterwards but the only person that produce that perfect life perfect life that pleases god for we know god said it over and over this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased pleased with the life that was operating and manifesting through him praise god so the life of jesus christ pleased god and pleases god and will continue to please god hallelujah and the devil knew that and that is why he tried to copy that life try to impersonate that life try to do it in all these different denominations amen different denominations just take that leave that praise god oh my he tried to take it on every level and to infiltrate a claim he is producing the life of christ man may think it's okay but god knows his own life and god knows what life it is that pleases him and god will not be deceived by any devil he didn't do it in heaven and he will not do it here on earth for the elect shall not be deceived hallelujah he's going to make all kind of trouble and everything else but he can't deal with it because that's why all hell is against this teaching amen because it can't penetrate the the seals on revelation he can't break into that because that's god communicating within himself is that right if i sit here and i communicate him within myself are you gonna know what what i'm thinking is that right and if i am part of him and he's communicating with me by the medium of revelation he is not using the power of the prince of the air he's not using radio he's not using television he's not using any of these arts digital arts that that's they're just breaking in and using the prince of the power of the air that's what they're doing but we are not dealing with that we are dealing with the power of the world where god can communicate with his children by the essence of revelation and god speaks he's speaking actually to himself see because we often go up when we talk like that we think like we're talking about two people we're talking about a billion people and god is communicating no he's doing it with himself so it's god talking to himself praise the lord oh so much right there you can think about it jesus on the cross this one that one i heard a voice here and then i see one in the water i want to know how many gods and all this is god talking to himself amen is this one part of himself expressed over there another one over there and he's talking to himself amen amen all are one in christ amen hallelujah amen so jesus already has produced a perfect life the perfect life and we all are witnesses to these things we've seen it we recognize it by the grace of god hallelujah amen and we know from that perfect light that he already has overcome praise the lord no matter what the devil did what you're coming in trying to tempt me everything you're trying to tell me about it belongs to me and ready so you're giving to me something i already got is that right it's the same with you and i if you really understand that they're never going to give you what you already have no you you refuse his entreaties and refuse his suggestions on your mind refuse them evil thoughts is going to throw at you amen that's what he's going to do but you got to reject them and receive the word up of the living god hallelujah so stay in that dimension of the word now let's go to enoch amen now that is how enoch caught the revelation because i repeat again as with abel as with abraham as with all of them there was no written bible so revelation is not something new that we now make up or something we're trying to introduce no it's the same thing abel had that made him know what was the perfect sacrifice to offer it's the same thing abraham knew when the voice spoke to him there was no written bible for him to compare that people can go back let me see what you're saying whether that is the thing here let me go back here and uh there was nothing for them to compare with they had to have it by faith well james put it this way he says now we gotta believe because we in every one of us if we are elected true believers you have a witness within you and that witness in you is the word as the holy ghost he will witness to the lord oh praise god hallelujah amen praise god when you're tired of this let me know but i'm going to try to finish this it's only 20 to 1 you know amen it's only 21. is that okay if you want to stretch stretch if you need to go to the washroom don't hesitate you know some people in church they hesitate to go to the washroom because oh it's embarrassing people are going to see me nobody's looking at you they're looking at the world they're looking at this word he may hear praise the lord so feel free praise god and if you want to stretch stretch hey man bro you're going to foyer and do the stretching though because it's going to kind of look funny if you come in here and praise god you know i saw some people running past my house with wits in their hand and running with the weights in to try to get off their bodies and shape and stuff young men going by the walk they place their with their all their big weights and things to show their muscles and everything else well i'm not talking about like that you come to church with all your culture meant to to do those things but just to keep yourself alive and alert because while i'm preaching a word to your spirit you hear the g in the germ the devil is going to work on this man outside to make it sleep he's going to make it feel tired he wasn't tired all the time but all of a sudden you're gonna start feeling tired yes i feel bored oh i was bored but the devil is doing all of that with the man outside here right because it is just about now they should start getting this way and start working on that part and i'm fighting him here while i'm talking that's why i'm talking praise god because of the spirit in there that this lord has come to amen that's why the prophet would constantly say oh he said oh shake yourselves wake up walk you see that's what he was doing praise god friend come to yourself praise the lord amen praise god forevermore so we know that uh this one we know as enoch was caught up by the revelation of the word of god and once he was caught up into a certain dimension by the word of god the next step is to take him out into glory because once he breaks in there starts things start being unveiled to him and revealed he started literally by revelation to live the life that was pleasing to god amen enoch type of what the bride brother branham says so the same thing we are going through now the revelation making the word clearer on the standard distilled to us and as we walk in it praise god we begin to live a life all unconscious all automatic all by the holy spirit not my works not my struggle not by strength but by the grace of god hallelujah we're living a life the life that is pleasing to god which is the life of jesus christ in us that portion of god that was put in there to assure assure our return amen to put a guarantee that his lord will not return to him void that everyone will have a blessed assurance let me everyone have our anchor holes our anchor holds it's on the rock of ages amen oh praise god and i thank god today we can have that come blessed assurance i spoke with sister june this morning or praise god but you speak with a old lady a widow everything else a sister in the grace of god and the spirit of god falls on her while you're talking and the revelation flowing out of her and coming back to you and going back and forth before you know it she wants to scream that she wants to jumping or shouting screaming of course she's in her house praising god hallelujah doesn't matter how young you are how old you are the word within your heart the word within your life amen real quick in your being amen make you a new creature amen hallelujah amen oh my yes sir oh praise god this flesh on the outside is going to fail you and it fails me many times oh my oh i don't want to do that i don't want to do but that's what paul was talking about he said i don't want to do this the things i don't want to do sometimes i end up doing you know what uh you know but thank god who give us the victory to jesus christ because the life that i now live is not that life of human life just of of the flesh but the life i now live i live by the the life of christ in me that's living through me bringing glory to god and is well pleasing to god [Applause] that is the life that pleases god not something that i put on work or culture rate or get myself through a good religious system that details the guidelines and guideposts by which i should operate and control my life my urges my desires my wants my will no not my will be done but thy will to the glory of god hallelujah amen amen amen thank god god was satisfied with the life that enoch was producing now just to throw this in so that somebody would say oh before jesus came he was living that life no he didn't have it like jesus had it but he had enough of it that it was pleasing to god uh god doesn't expect you or i to be exactly like jesus christ he was the fullness of it all but you what you will be what you are producing in you that little portion you're producing that is what is pleasing to god that's why brother branham says you're not going to come the ful the fullness of perfection and all that before you leave here you're going to have the sticky nature dealing with you all the way through until you get out of this all the way until you get out to this it's going to be you're going to be dealing with it but the fact is god sees the life in you fighting this flesh and pushing it off to do his will and to please him and that pleases him that makes him love you praise god hallelujah amen so we live here projecting the overcoming life we live here of projecting the perfect life we live here projecting a life of perfect love and grace amen oh this person did you that this person you got to get back at them no you're foolish why didn't you do that why didn't you do this because that's how the devil will want to irk you up you know get you all stirred up by saying ah you're so foolish everybody else is doing this everybody else is doing that and you're gonna let that guy or that woman tell you this to tell you that when you can easily answer you see that's how he works behind the scenes trying to play on your mind and store you up and work you up but the man inside there you know is just it's just there and whenever god wants to speak before you know it something is said and when you say something when god says something sometimes one sentence one word and everything is done it's over you don't have to say anything else god gets the glory god gets the praise hallelujah amen oh my praise god hallelujah oh my so enoch broke into that realm of revelation of the unwritten word that wasn't yet written down yet parts of it not written down yet and with what he had he lived by that and started to produce a life heading in the direction that was pleasing to god it wasn't yet jesus christ but the life was on its way down the pipeline if you want to put it that way that's why he's there as an example praise the name of the lord hallelujah amen so we find we don't have to force ourselves but we wait on god amen to speak to us what to do and what is next praise the lord because we only hear for one purpose i repeat and that purpose is to express god by letting him the word have preeminence over us word of flesh fleshly mind fleshly desires and stuff like that praise the name of the lord amen we we hear it we believe it we obey it we act on it and we let god's grace uh you know take us through praise god look you know what i'm going to stop here i think you've had you've had enough for the day and we want to give god the praise and the honor and the glory musicians are you coming um you can sing while you're coming praise god you can hum while you're coming praise god come clap your hands while you're coming amen thank god forevermore hallelujah that's the life that pleases god of course that's not everything that can be said about that there may be others that may be saying things like this or even more but i just give you an incarnation not because like i said i don't want to spoon feed you by saying oh that is found in this quote page zones over here that's found over there and then i give you all the portions of meat and you got no desire to go and search no desire to go read no desire to listen because now i know the message no i want you to as brother brahm said he says you go in your room turn on that tape amen get quiet in the presence of god and just listen not to strive or do nothing all of a sudden things are going to pop things are going to start popping out and speaking to you you might have heard them a million times 20 years 30 40 years but when the right time spiritual food will come to you in this due season amen praise the lord hallelujah god bless you brother amen he was there all this time i'm glad for that brother sister i'm not telling you what to say but he was there all the time within my i know once i say it it's gone out and in the past people think you mean they must do it but it's just just there praise the lord god bless you thank god i am free free free from this worse [Music] [Applause] washing the blood of jesus [Music] [Music] long a jesus what a wonderful hour i'm so glad that i've found out he can bring me out to his savings [Music] [Music] i'm so glad i found [Music] has taken its flight like a
