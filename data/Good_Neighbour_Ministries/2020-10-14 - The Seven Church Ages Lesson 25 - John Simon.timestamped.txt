[0:44] nicolaitanism and
[0:47] may god bless us and enrich us here
[0:51] today
[0:52] we take it from the seed of
[0:55] nicolasianism
[0:56] in ephesians
[0:59] which we are studying and
[1:03] applies it applying it to the present
[1:07] day evil of nucleationism
[1:13] in its present form making itself
[1:17] manifested in the church of the living
[1:21] god
[1:22] let us read our scripture
[1:26] and have a word of prayer and begin
[1:29] our study
[1:32] from the book of revelation chapter
[1:36] 2 verse 6.

[2:27] be glorified we pray
[2:30] this day in jesus name
[2:34] amen and amen
[2:38] now the present day evil
[2:42] of nicolasianism nico
[2:46] meaning to conquer and leoptionism
[2:52] the laity conquering
[2:56] the laity now the present-day
[2:59] evil of this nickelodeonism
[3:04] can be seen in the upsurge
[3:10] in the desires in the hearts
[3:13] of men human beings men and women today
[3:19] especially in the religious realm
[3:23] wanting and desiring and lusting
[3:27] to be heads uh over boards
[3:33] committees uh churches
[3:38] uh human beings desiring to become
[3:43] ministers pastors
[3:46] leaders superintendents
[3:49] uh rulers uh princes of the church
[3:55] teachers and the desire
[3:58] to be certified not
[4:01] so much by god but to be
[4:05] certified by men in this day
[4:09] and to hold some form of certification
[4:12] of human ordination
[4:14] human diplomatics or the diplomas
[4:18] a human membership
[4:21] and some kind of fraternity organization
[4:24] whether it be religious or otherwise
[4:26] that from which they will
[4:28] glean or gain their
[4:31] uh authority and ability
[4:35] to maintain and sustain this
[4:39] kind of human rulership
[4:42] nickelodeonism which uh they may not
[4:46] know it
[4:46] by that name but that is what it is
[4:51] and so many today with no calling
[4:57] no calling of god
[5:00] no gifting of the holy spirit
[5:05] no anointing of the great holy
[5:08] spirit of the living god but
[5:11] in them is a desire
[5:15] to become preacher pastor teacher
[5:18] missionary leader
[5:19] superintendent just the lost and desire
[5:23] to be over men to be over
[5:27] groups of men and of course my friends
[5:31] we understand that god
[5:34] is in the heavens and god
[5:38] by his spirit rules his church true
[5:41] anointed
[5:42] men but let us come back to our
[5:47] teaching for today
[5:50] now we understand friends
[5:54] what was happening back there and
[5:57] how that after a while
[6:00] that the very thing that the ephesian
[6:04] church
[6:04] hated and had tested and tried and
[6:08] found them to be liars
[6:12] now we are reading that amongst them
[6:15] they have this nickelodeonism
[6:18] which means that there was a drifting
[6:20] away
[6:21] from the original word of falling away
[6:25] from their first love
[6:28] and as it was happening back there
[6:32] we find that the false vine was taking a
[6:35] hold
[6:38] it was teaching about
[6:41] and trying to establish the rulership
[6:45] of men and that that rulership
[6:49] was right it was also
[6:52] teaching that the church
[6:56] had to be governed and governed by
[7:00] men and they believe that that
[7:03] also was right
[7:07] they taught that those men that ruled
[7:10] over the church
[7:11] these so-called princes of the church
[7:14] not shepherds not uh beggars or
[7:18] poor men that were hiding in caves with
[7:21] camel skin and goat skins and smelly
[7:24] and everything else like that but
[7:26] perfumed handkerchiefs and
[7:29] wonderful satin robes and golden crosses
[7:32] and everything else
[7:34] elevating themselves and
[7:37] now we find according to the word of god
[7:42] that it was taught to the people that
[7:45] these
[7:46] so-called men were to have control
[7:50] over the people and instead of course of
[7:55] them
[7:56] doing it god's way they
[7:59] simply took human authority
[8:04] and vested
[8:07] by their vestments and by their teaching
[8:12] and vested all supernat all spiritual
[8:16] power
[8:18] into their own hands
[8:22] and out of that fire
[8:25] of desire for their vested interest
[8:29] came the golden calf
[8:33] of a holy priesthood
[8:36] standing between god and man
[8:41] standing between god and
[8:44] the people and by this
[8:50] knowingly or annoyingly they had
[8:53] reverted
[8:54] or turned themselves back to the
[8:58] old ironic system
[9:01] of priesthood and by going
[9:05] back in time and out of their
[9:09] age and their season they
[9:14] actually became antichrist
[9:19] now we know according to scripture
[9:23] and history that the
[9:26] ironic priesthood ended
[9:30] with eli and his sons
[9:34] let me give you the scriptures you can
[9:36] check this out yourselves
[9:38] 1st samuel chapter 2
[9:42] verses 22 and in 1st samuel
[9:47] chapter 4. verses
[9:51] 15 to 18.
[9:54] now here we find this so-called
[9:58] unscriptural
[9:59] ungodly antichrist priesthood
[10:05] placing itself between
[10:08] god and man
[10:12] they will be the confessors they will be
[10:13] the mediators
[10:15] when in our bible it
[10:18] teaches there is only
[10:22] one let me repeat
[10:25] there is only one mediator
[10:29] between god and man
[10:33] and his name as the man christ
[10:36] jesus now they became
[10:40] antichrist for they disposed
[10:45] of the original word and of
[10:49] his jesus christ mediatorship
[10:53] and imposed their own multiplicity
[10:57] of ships
[11:01] and of course god hated that
[11:06] because they were accepting the
[11:09] anointing
[11:10] and order of a passage
[11:15] and trying to lead the people
[11:19] by rotten manna by
[11:23] what was allowed in a former age now
[11:27] become unscriptural and disposed of
[11:31] by the living god but reinstituted by
[11:35] satan that all copycat
[11:38] and saying yes it was god that
[11:41] instituted it
[11:42] yes at a certain time but then he
[11:43] disposed of it
[11:45] but now he satan is making use of it
[11:49] through his unscriptural ungodly and
[11:52] sinful so-called priesthood
[11:56] god hated nicolasianism then in its past
[11:59] form
[12:00] and he hates it now the present
[12:04] day evil of nicolasianism
[12:07] now we find that the ephesian church
[12:10] hated that
[12:11] and any true believer filled with the
[12:15] first
[12:15] love of god in their hearts will
[12:18] hit the leadership of evil
[12:22] man not ordained by god
[12:25] let me emphasize god has set
[12:28] in the church man as predestinated
[12:33] vessels
[12:34] through whom he himself will interpret
[12:37] his word
[12:38] he himself will lead his church
[12:41] not the man but god leading his church
[12:45] through this uh ephesians 4
[12:48] that he himself has instituted we will
[12:52] get to that amen god hates
[12:55] man ruling over his
[12:58] word absolutely praise
[13:01] god amen yes sir so we are not here to
[13:05] try to
[13:06] wash up on the that all ironic
[13:10] uh system that was there that was
[13:13] outlawed
[13:14] outlawed and ended
[13:17] by god himself certainly
[13:20] not praise god hallelujah now right now
[13:26] it's worst of all
[13:30] and the organization
[13:34] organizing themselves they have
[13:37] separated the people
[13:39] from the true word of god
[13:46] god's people are supposed to be one
[13:49] but they have brought in enemy
[13:50] nationalism
[13:54] by one spirit we are supposed to be
[13:59] baptized into one body
[14:03] and every part of his or that body
[14:07] ought to be moved upon and used
[14:11] by the holy ghost himself
[14:15] and everyone is to participate
[14:19] in the worship of god under the
[14:21] anointing and inspiration
[14:23] of the blessed holy spirit
[14:27] but man men wanting the preeminence
[14:32] man wanting the control so they could
[14:35] have
[14:36] and take control
[14:39] made themselves bishops
[14:43] well of course we know in the modern
[14:45] world
[14:46] they've got the word bishop to mean an
[14:49] imminent elevated person
[14:51] in the bible a bishop is simply a pastor
[14:55] the bible some time ago uh
[14:58] a diplomat a diplomat asked me uh
[15:02] uh brother simon are you are you
[15:06] a bishop now i knew in their
[15:09] heart and in their mind they were
[15:12] thinking
[15:13] of the modern day uh
[15:16] uh interpretation of what or who
[15:20] a bishop is supposed to be and appear to
[15:22] be
[15:23] and knowing that that was in their mind
[15:26] i said no sir
[15:28] i i am not a bishop i meant a no sir i'm
[15:31] not
[15:32] that kind of a bishop but i answered no
[15:34] sir i am
[15:36] not a bishop amen and left it at that
[15:39] because you
[15:40] see in the minds of men they have
[15:43] implanted this suggestion this thought
[15:47] that a bishop is a an elevated
[15:51] royalty of religion
[15:54] and that he the bishop is above pastors
[15:58] but the word bishop means pastor and
[16:01] every pastor
[16:02] is a bishop in his own local church and
[16:05] there is no bishop above bishops
[16:08] for we are if we are all preachers and
[16:10] we are all
[16:11] bishops or preachers or pastors
[16:16] in our own local church but they've
[16:19] developed a system
[16:20] of bishops and archbishops
[16:24] and cardinals and popes
[16:27] and so on that is the way that they have
[16:31] established
[16:33] this system that is unscriptural
[16:36] ungodly sinful and satanic
[16:40] and totally and absolutely in rebellion
[16:45] of god and his word
[16:49] they're brought upon themselves
[16:53] imposing titles by which they have to
[16:56] glean credibility and authority
[17:00] their bypass the word of the living god
[17:05] are not teaching and have taught their
[17:07] own
[17:08] doctrines that are not even found
[17:11] in the bible in the word of god
[17:16] they have by suctility
[17:19] and deceit have caused the people
[17:24] and brought them to a place of
[17:26] nickelodeonism
[17:28] man's domination into having them
[17:33] kissing different parts of their body
[17:37] and uh have those people to obey them
[17:44] and worship in the way
[17:49] that does not in any way resemble
[17:52] biblical worship pentecostal worship
[17:57] acts 2 4 worship it doesn't resemble
[18:01] that
[18:01] anyway no mumbling no murmuring no
[18:05] monotonic monosyllabic ah
[18:08] carrying on none of that whatsoever
[18:12] and it does not come from just the
[18:14] apostles
[18:15] or from the priesthood but all the
[18:18] people
[18:19] were worshiping praising and thanking
[18:22] god
[18:23] in the house of god but now it's come
[18:25] down
[18:27] to the to priestly worship
[18:30] it's come down to that where
[18:33] the word of god is reduced to nothing
[18:38] but a creed
[18:40] and the bible which tells us salvation
[18:44] is by blood and repentance to jesus
[18:48] christ
[18:50] but no their teaching is that salvation
[18:53] is by being a member of the church
[18:56] church membership gives you salvation
[19:01] and if you're excommunicated or you're
[19:04] outside of the church
[19:05] then you are outside of the grace of god
[19:08] the mercy of god
[19:11] and only a man can restore you
[19:14] or give that back to you contrary to the
[19:18] word of god
[19:19] and thus they have this antichrist
[19:22] evil nicoletian spirit
[19:26] predominating and ruling over
[19:29] god's church now remember
[19:33] in the book of acts let us read the
[19:35] scripture my friends
[19:36] if we were to read it today uh
[19:39] praise god hey hallelujah let's read the
[19:43] scripture
[19:44] and this is the way they may read it
[19:47] and now when the day of pentecost was
[19:50] fully calm
[19:52] there came a priest with
[19:55] a wafer and said stick out your
[20:00] tongue and he laid the wafer
[20:04] upon their town and then
[20:07] he himself drank the wine and said
[20:10] now you have received
[20:14] the holy ghost incredible
[20:18] and indeed is incredible for that is not
[20:21] what the word of god says
[20:22] go read the book of acts chapter 2 verse
[20:26] 4 and hear what it says amen
[20:29] what they are saying in my friends never
[20:32] mind what the word of
[20:34] god says never mind
[20:37] what you think it says we are
[20:40] here to interpret the the word of god
[20:43] to you we are here to tell you what it
[20:48] says
[20:49] and furthermore may we inform you this
[20:52] is the nickelodeon spirit
[20:54] that is out there with its present evil
[20:57] saying to you that the bible
[21:00] my friends is not finished
[21:04] and as it changes with the times
[21:09] which the bible does not say for god
[21:12] says
[21:12] i am the lord thy god i
[21:16] change not the word of god does not
[21:19] change and he says it will stand forever
[21:24] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[21:27] words will not pass away
[21:29] and furthermore let my word
[21:32] be true and the words of every man be a
[21:36] liar
[21:38] who should we believe the words of
[21:42] elevated man or by the glorious
[21:47] king of glory this mighty god
[21:50] the everlasting father jesus christ
[21:53] hallelujah
[21:55] amen they are telling us that the bible
[21:59] changes and must change with the times
[22:03] and god says no it does not happen
[22:07] the word of god does not change for god
[22:10] does not change his mind about his
[22:14] word amen praise the lord
[22:18] our friends whenever there's a conflict
[22:22] between
[22:23] truth and error heavens and heart will
[22:26] pass away
[22:27] but my word shall not pass away
[22:32] and let god be true and let every man
[22:36] be a liar so people today
[22:40] allowing themselves to be led by people
[22:46] presumptuous people in other words
[22:48] people
[22:49] who presume on the word of god
[22:52] they're presumed to be something or
[22:55] somebody that they are not in other
[22:58] words they are
[22:59] actors and they're presumptuous
[23:02] to insert themselves within
[23:06] the word of the living god
[23:10] claiming that they are so-called
[23:13] vikers of christ are or that they are
[23:16] instead of christ the
[23:19] vicarious billy idea but
[23:22] what they are is antichrist
[23:26] for it is not found in this bible
[23:30] in the word of god you are believing
[23:33] something that they have told you but is
[23:36] not found in our bible
[23:40] it's another sad story
[23:44] when we think of water baptism
[23:50] in the jesus day the immersed
[23:54] people who went down into the water
[23:57] and came up out of the water
[24:01] to walk in newness of
[24:04] life but now
[24:08] we found educated man
[24:12] creating beautiful surroundings like
[24:14] cain's altar
[24:16] with flowers with brass with gold with
[24:18] silver
[24:20] and a little chip bowl with water which
[24:23] is claimed to be holy
[24:25] and they will pour a bit of that upon
[24:28] you or sprinkle
[24:29] some one of that upon you and tell you
[24:32] you have been baptized when the
[24:36] bible speaks contrary to that even
[24:39] jesus himself showing the example the
[24:42] bible said and when john
[24:43] took him to baptize him he went down
[24:47] into the water and coming up out of the
[24:50] water
[24:51] the holy spirit comes down upon him
[24:54] all blessed be the name of the lord as
[24:57] it was with the lord
[24:58] so let it be today with every person
[25:02] that comes to be one of baptized
[25:05] in the name of the lord we are not here
[25:07] to pour water upon you my friends
[25:10] we are not here to pour lies upon you
[25:13] but we are here to pour out the holy
[25:15] spirit upon you we are here to pour out
[25:17] the revealed word
[25:19] upon you praise god hallelujah
[25:22] amen and not only though they pour out
[25:25] the water
[25:26] but they baptize the people wrongly on
[25:30] scripturally baptizing them
[25:33] in the titles of father son
[25:37] and holy spirit as if those
[25:41] titles were real names
[25:44] suddenly comingly and evilly
[25:49] they are literally trying to do away
[25:53] with one and suggesting to the
[25:57] people that there are tree gods
[26:01] instead of one my friends
[26:05] you stay in that organization
[26:08] and try to teach or preach the truth of
[26:12] one god and baptism in the name of the
[26:15] lord jesus christ
[26:16] and they'll surely kick you out throw
[26:19] you out
[26:20] and get you out of there and i'm saying
[26:24] to you
[26:24] if you claim to be truly spirit led
[26:28] by the holy spirit you will not be able
[26:31] to stand there
[26:32] it will be impossible for you to stay
[26:35] within there
[26:37] now we know paul was a prophet
[26:40] and we know that paul taught by the holy
[26:43] ghost
[26:45] and paul himself he said he baptized in
[26:48] no other name
[26:49] but in the name of the lord jesus christ
[26:52] and said if anyone did anything
[26:55] different
[26:56] or baptized in any different way than he
[27:00] did and was doing let them be
[27:03] cursed let them be accursed according
[27:07] to the bible then it's time for us to
[27:10] wake up and see where we're standing
[27:13] it's time for us to see the evil of
[27:17] the colonialism in its present form
[27:20] it is time for us to read out of the
[27:24] book of
[27:25] acts chapter 20 verses 27
[27:29] to 30. amen and how
[27:32] we can see that the church is no longer
[27:35] controlled by the holy ghost
[27:37] but controlled by nickelodeon
[27:40] spirits reading from what paul
[27:44] said acts 20 27
[27:47] to 30 for i have not shunned
[27:51] to declare unto you
[27:55] all the counsel of god
[27:59] take heed therefore unto yourself
[28:02] and to all the flock of god
[28:06] which the holy ghost had made you
[28:08] overseers
[28:09] to feed the church of god which he has
[28:13] purchased
[28:14] with his own blood for i know
[28:18] this that after my departing
[28:22] shall gravious woes
[28:25] enter in amongst you not sparing the
[28:29] flock
[28:30] also of your own cells in the church
[28:34] paul is saying among you from your own
[28:37] selves
[28:38] shall menorize speaking perverse things
[28:42] perverting the truth and to draw away
[28:46] disciples after them now paul saw this
[28:50] all coming
[28:52] and he warned about this subtle
[28:57] intelligent cunning
[29:00] priesthood that would come
[29:04] and by fertility and deceit
[29:08] take over with its false doctrines
[29:13] and begin to control not only the church
[29:17] but we know according to scripture after
[29:18] a while
[29:19] they'll control the entire world
[29:22] and they are right on the cusp of it
[29:24] right now
[29:27] he knew paul that there would implement
[29:31] a way of worship that excluded the
[29:35] people
[29:36] in any part of holy spirit
[29:40] ministry and knowing this they're so
[29:44] cunning so
[29:44] subtle they quickly went
[29:47] and brought in some people
[29:51] and inserted them among themselves uh
[29:54] which they call
[29:55] charismatics uh speaking in towns and
[29:59] worshiping and playing guitars
[30:01] and and say oh we have that too yes
[30:04] you have that in a sense small sense
[30:07] amongst you
[30:08] but it's not general in the entire
[30:12] church
[30:12] where the people have a charismatic
[30:14] pentecostal way of worship
[30:17] but my friends amongst you
[30:20] you have this deeds of the nicolaitans
[30:24] in this day amen praise god
[30:27] hallelujah not much freedom at all and
[30:30] the best we can see
[30:32] is a few inspired preachers while the
[30:35] flock sits down there
[30:38] and tries to absorb it
[30:41] this is far crying from what paul said
[30:45] when we all came to come together and
[30:48] all have the leading of the spirit of
[30:50] god
[30:51] and all of us spiritually participating
[30:57] in spiritual worship
[31:01] now the church the corporate church has
[31:03] never learned this last
[31:04] lesson because of course the church has
[31:07] now
[31:08] become corporations
[31:11] instead of being in cooperation
[31:15] with god they have become
[31:18] their own religious body
[31:22] not his body but their own
[31:25] religious corporate body
[31:29] and every time god gives a visitation
[31:32] of the holy spirit and get people free
[31:36] after a while they bind themselves back
[31:39] to the very same thing
[31:41] they came out of i believe that's going
[31:43] on right now even with the people
[31:46] of the message in this hour binding
[31:48] themselves back
[31:50] the old spider the old snakes the old
[31:53] crabs and all these various creatures
[31:57] of of the dark deep are
[32:00] slowly creeping and crawling them their
[32:03] ways back
[32:04] to where they come from and finding
[32:06] their
[32:07] appropriate places luther
[32:10] lutheranism which came out of
[32:13] catholicism how many knows that
[32:16] i know that lutheranism came out
[32:19] of catholicism when he nailed his
[32:23] feces at the gate but when
[32:28] luther died the people or luther's
[32:33] people
[32:33] simply organized themselves
[32:40] around what they thought they believed
[32:46] and began to set up their own creeds
[32:50] their own ideas and their
[32:53] own darkness and began to
[32:57] repudiate or be against anyone
[33:01] else that was saying opposite
[33:05] to what they said my friends isn't that
[33:08] so much like those
[33:10] who have come out of this message of a
[33:13] genuine
[33:13] bible prophet and now they're putting
[33:17] themselves
[33:17] under brandonism and now
[33:21] they're allowing themselves to keep
[33:24] their eyes
[33:25] on the man the messenger
[33:29] instead of his message and
[33:33] not realizing they're slowly drifting
[33:36] away
[33:38] from the original truth that
[33:41] this messenger that god sent
[33:45] has brought to us
[33:48] oh friends there shall be the bible
[33:52] says a great falling away
[33:57] in doing so they're on their journey
[34:01] back to catholicism
[34:04] taking it on in a different form
[34:10] and already we find today many
[34:12] denominations lutheranism
[34:15] included are already on their way
[34:18] back home to their religious
[34:21] mother roman ism that they came
[34:25] out of from the very beginning oh yes
[34:29] revelation chapter 12
[34:31] the bible calls her on old
[34:34] and her daughters and those daughters
[34:38] were exactly acting like their mother
[34:42] and teaching what their mother
[34:45] is teaching and has taught and setting
[34:49] the word of
[34:50] god aside denying the working
[34:53] and moving of the holy spirit
[34:57] and with this grievous wolf-like
[35:00] spirit to subjugate like nimrod
[35:04] the people of the living god
[35:07] and make it impossible for them to
[35:10] worship
[35:11] and bring glory to god unless they
[35:14] come through them and through their
[35:18] pattern
[35:18] in other words they are setting aside
[35:22] the leadership of their husband
[35:25] god the word and so
[35:29] they've lost their sweetness they've
[35:32] lost their anointing
[35:34] of the blessed holy spirit
[35:37] and have become domineering
[35:41] dominating and controlling
[35:45] church or woman
[35:48] over the word and people
[35:52] of the living god here we see
[35:55] in the scripture friends
[35:59] that they want the people to be
[36:01] subjugated
[36:02] to their pattern which is nothing
[36:06] but satan's pattern and satan's
[36:10] uh blueprint for
[36:13] unbelief we are
[36:17] working and speaking and uh
[36:20] operating on the god's blueprint
[36:23] they're operating on the satan's
[36:25] blueprint
[36:26] for deceit deception and degradation
[36:30] oh my friends where are we spiritually
[36:34] here today
[36:35] where is the promised land how far
[36:38] as kids in a car but their parents will
[36:41] say how far more do we have to go
[36:43] how far more yes how far is the promised
[36:46] land
[36:47] how far are we from it my friends oh
[36:50] we are in a wilderness of darkness at
[36:53] this particular time
[36:56] and how far have we wandered away
[36:59] from the first church of acts chapter
[37:03] two when we look at the
[37:06] image the shape of the modern
[37:10] church and compare it to god's blueprint
[37:14] and pattern of pentecost
[37:17] we are far away from god's original
[37:20] view and his word can
[37:23] not be found in her
[37:27] things what we find today is teachings
[37:31] and things like
[37:32] apostolic succession
[37:36] absolutely unscriptural
[37:39] antichrist sinful and against the word
[37:44] of the living god yet it abounds
[37:48] in the minds and hearts of millions
[37:52] but it is not found in the word of god
[37:55] it's a device of man
[38:00] it trying to supersede
[38:04] illegally the truth
[38:07] of the word of god and is a man-made
[38:11] device amen
[38:15] god not man but
[38:18] god has set in the church do you believe
[38:21] that
[38:21] ephesians chapter 4 god has set in the
[38:25] church apostles
[38:26] preachers pastors teachers elders
[38:30] administrators and so on but the
[38:32] emphasis
[38:33] here is not man not some human
[38:37] leadership
[38:38] anointing and giving out posts
[38:41] positions and like that but
[38:45] god himself has set in the church
[38:48] the bible tells us set his own leaders
[38:52] spirit-filled anointed leaders in the
[38:54] church
[38:55] oh praise god hallelujah lies like peter
[38:59] was in rome
[39:00] not even historically peter was not in
[39:03] rome
[39:05] yet the lions say that he was
[39:08] in rome they make movies about him
[39:12] being in rome to to implant it
[39:16] in the minds and hearts of men this is
[39:19] an unscriptural picture
[39:21] on scriptural position it's totally
[39:24] unscriptural
[39:25] with what they are propounding that
[39:27] peter was
[39:29] not ever even in rome
[39:32] and they are lying now there are people
[39:35] who read history my friends
[39:39] and shrugged their shoulders when they
[39:42] see
[39:42] that truth and they'll go right back to
[39:45] their church believing that kind of a
[39:46] lie
[39:47] even though they can see it and know it
[39:50] according to history
[39:51] that peter was never ever
[39:55] in rome where can you find
[40:00] a term a thought
[40:04] a vikar of christ it is
[40:07] not in your bible all the
[40:10] new testament it's nowhere to be found
[40:15] it is not there it is a man-made
[40:18] post and position but not given
[40:22] by god think of it my friends
[40:27] no one can take the place of jesus
[40:30] christ
[40:31] there is only one jesus christ and no
[40:34] one else
[40:35] has the power of a dead hell and the
[40:38] grave
[40:38] but jesus and jesus alone blessed be his
[40:42] holy and precious name
[40:43] and he has not given up his powers he
[40:46] has not renounced his spires
[40:48] and he has not placed it in the hands of
[40:51] any man here on earth who has no
[40:54] right to call themselves
[40:57] viker of jesus christ
[41:00] yet it has been done and yet
[41:04] people accept it where can we
[41:08] find such a thing as added revelation
[41:11] to the word of god we cannot add
[41:15] or take away from the word the bible
[41:17] itself
[41:18] is telling you that in its closing words
[41:21] be
[41:22] careful do not add nor take away
[41:25] from the word of god lest your part be
[41:28] taken out of the book of
[41:31] life oh think about it my friends
[41:35] where do we find such a thing as
[41:36] purgatory
[41:38] there is no such thing in the bible
[41:41] where do we find something like math
[41:46] there is no such a thing found in the
[41:49] word of god
[41:50] like mass we cannot find it
[41:56] where do you find people having to pay
[41:59] jesus the apostles or anyone
[42:02] in the bible to pay or buy their way
[42:06] out of hell it is not in your bible
[42:09] these are the grievous wolves that paul
[42:11] is speaking about that will come
[42:13] after him claiming the name of christ
[42:15] but yet
[42:16] antichrist here it is in the word of god
[42:20] where do you find it's not in the word
[42:23] but men put it in their own religious
[42:27] books and claiming that it is
[42:31] the word of god that took over the
[42:33] people's minds
[42:34] and they're ruling the people by fear
[42:38] and threats of fear and excommunication
[42:41] where do you find in your bible that
[42:45] man has the power to forgive
[42:48] us of our sins as though
[42:51] that man or those men were god
[42:55] unscriptural it is not in
[42:58] your bible grievous woes
[43:01] is a term that is uh it's not even
[43:04] strong enough
[43:05] to describe them to describe the
[43:09] evil of nickelodeonism and it's a
[43:11] present
[43:12] evil past evil present evil
[43:15] and it will grow to its fruition or
[43:17] harvest in the
[43:19] years that are ahead the spirit
[43:22] of organization of placing
[43:26] man over man instead of god
[43:29] ruling over his church
[43:33] my friends all of their
[43:36] teachings questionable doctrinal
[43:40] foundations they're building their
[43:44] doctrinal foundation on the shifting
[43:47] sinking
[43:48] signs of time which will pass away my
[43:52] friends
[43:53] but the word of our god will stand
[43:56] forever
[43:57] let us get back to god and repent
[44:00] before it is too late
[44:04] i see the hand writing on the wall
[44:07] as in the days of belshazz's feast
[44:12] we see the hand writing upon
[44:15] the wall and the hand is writing
[44:19] judgment
[44:20] judgment man and manner taking your
[44:23] first sin
[44:25] the glory is departed your kingdom is
[44:28] taken from your hand
[44:30] oh my god what a day and are
[44:33] the sacred vessels of the living god
[44:37] being desecrated and now
[44:40] brings down the wrath of god
[44:43] the sacred word of god now
[44:46] being desecrated and the spirit of god
[44:52] being grieved judgment is now
[44:55] right now here even at the very
[44:59] doors oh church of the living god repent
[45:05] go back to pentecost back to the
[45:07] leadership of the holy spirit
[45:09] back to the word of god and the
[45:12] preeminence
[45:13] of the holy spirit of the living god
[45:16] now remember how nebuchadnezzar took
[45:18] away the sacred vessels of god
[45:20] the devil is doing the same thing in the
[45:23] form of the word of god
[45:26] his sacred vessels for his transmission
[45:29] of truth
[45:30] and his living word his bright church
[45:34] his people at the end time
[45:36] predestinated for this hour when the
[45:39] word of god will flow through them
[45:41] he is taking away that and taking them
[45:44] down into babylon thanks be to
[45:48] god for these spirit anointed men
[45:51] like paul that god gave amen
[45:55] the bible tells us revelation 2 7
[45:59] he that hated heir let him hear what the
[46:02] spirit
[46:02] said unto the churches let him that
[46:05] overcome it i will
[46:06] give to eat of the tree of life which is
[46:10] in the midst of the paradise of god
[46:13] oh friends millions thousands will hear
[46:16] these words as they go out on the
[46:18] internet
[46:20] but let me say how many are going to pay
[46:22] heed
[46:23] how many are going to come out from
[46:25] amongst them my people and be
[46:28] not partakers of our sins we don't know
[46:32] but we know that god has his own people
[46:36] that will lend his him lend their ears
[46:39] to him
[46:40] and want to know the words of truth as
[46:43] found
[46:44] in the bible and in the word of god keep
[46:46] your heart on your ear
[46:49] and the spirit of god will make this
[46:51] word of god
[46:52] real to you that is his work that
[46:56] is what he is here for i can teach you
[46:58] the truth
[46:59] ma any man can bring to you the truth my
[47:02] friends
[47:03] but if you don't open your ears to hear
[47:06] it man your heart be open to receive it
[47:10] you won't be able to get the revelation
[47:14] now we notice the spirit of god is
[47:16] saying hear what the spirit is saying to
[47:19] the
[47:19] churches then we know that this warning
[47:23] this rebuke this revelation this promise
[47:26] and blessing is was not meant only
[47:30] for the ephesian jews church
[47:34] but my friends it's meant for the
[47:36] churches of
[47:38] all ages hallelujah thus we know
[47:42] this first church age the church in the
[47:44] beginning just as in genesis a seed book
[47:47] a beginning book a beginning topic where
[47:50] everything finds its seed form and
[47:52] begins
[47:53] which will later come to its harvest so
[47:55] if this
[47:56] book of acts 2 4 ephesian church began
[48:00] as the first seed church of the living
[48:03] god
[48:04] amen and will remain in the book of acts
[48:07] as god's blueprint for all ages
[48:10] until the church ages close out
[48:13] and the ledecian church age which is
[48:17] closing up right now watch it carefully
[48:19] my friends
[48:20] and let every other age other than that
[48:23] ephesian church age
[48:25] begin to take heed of what is going on
[48:28] what is happening and that the church of
[48:31] good and evil which was splendid
[48:34] is going to grow and it is growing and
[48:37] has been growing
[48:38] through the ages and thus then is a
[48:42] message
[48:42] for every christian every believer
[48:46] through every age until jesus comes
[48:49] again
[48:50] let us pay heed to god's word for it is
[48:53] jesus
[48:54] speaking by his word now listen fathers
[48:57] i'm closing
[48:59] for i have not shunned to declare unto
[49:02] you
