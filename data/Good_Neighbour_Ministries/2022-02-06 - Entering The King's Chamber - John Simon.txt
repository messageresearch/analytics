our hearts and lives and build us up in our most holy faith and gross into great trees of righteousness o lord may we bring glory and honor to thy great name in jesus name amen praise god now in 19 july 9 1982 an intruder climbed up a drain pipe at buckingham palace and went right past all the security and went into the queen's chamber and there he had a a conference or a talk with the queen telling her about the social ills of the day and about his particular personal uh situation well the queen and her maid kind of distracted him and called for security and they later arrested him now i want you to see it's 40 years later this is like israel coming through the wilderness but 40 years later and today i'm speaking about the king of heaven's chamber i'm speaking about entering the king's chamber and not by climbing up a drain pipe not by climbing up a true and open window like a thief and a robber or like an uninvited guest but we want to enter the king's chamber i want to enter the king's chamber and i believe i have entered into the king's chamber and i trust many others will will walk the the golden stairs and enter the king's chamber also and so here we go as we go to the king's chamber we don't want to climb through a window as i have said but we want to walk up the step seven stairs of the seven church ages or spiritually speaking jacob's ladder uh portrayed in the bible by which entry into the king's chamber will take us to a wonderful wonderful place revealed by god himself alone praise god this chamber we use the word chamber but chamber can uh speak of a bedroom and it can also speak of a an audience room where a king or royalty will meet in chambers their court their ministers they will meet their counsels and there have secret conversations with them in that chamber their deliberations come to decisions and things very secret things will be talked about there i want to thank god for brother william marion branham god's great prophet of this 20th century and he referred to this sacred place this holy place of god and using uh many terms or many names but one of the most enduring and one with which many believers would be very familiar with is the very term that the angel of god when the angel of god met him and took him to the little room and then said to him i'll meet you in there i'll meet you in there in the little room is where he planned to meet him now you can uh you know much more about that and how he very much saw many people entering into that little room and when they came out of that room they were totally different they were changed by the power of god and made into different persons by god's grace now i want you to understand that many have talked about this great pyramid the great pyramids of egypt and there in the mysterious pyramids of egypt we find out my friends that there have been many studies done by dr petry dr davidson and many many others about the king's chamber a literal king's chamber built in stone there in the great pyramid and in their their writings and research they found that they a great pyramid was never kept there are other pyramids sitting in the desert but this great pyramid was never kept or they could not find a capstone they don't know what happened to it where it is it's a mystery to this very day oh praise god another thing is not only did they notice and see that the capstone was missing but they were intrigued by the repetitive use of the number seven used over and over again in the mathematical uh diagrams measurements and things in that pyramid and they were wondering about it of course if you were to literally go visit the great pyramid you'll have to enter there and then you'll have to go up what they call the grand gallery before you will get to climbing into the king's chamber before entering into the king's chamber there my friends which when they got in it was plain and simple they thought they would come into something ostentatious something that befits a great pharaoh or great king it was a simple room nothing for the eyes natural eyes to behold of it praise god hallelujah and i thank god god doesn't deal with these shiny ostentatious things but in simplicity he hides himself and he also reveals himself in simplicity and thank god our precious brother branham speaking about this king's chamber the king's chamber not a queen not a king but this king of kings and lord of lords his chamber room praise god listen he says now that door is still open people are coming from the east and from the west north and south they are gathering in there are great signs happening see in the skies fearful sights atomics of the air has been split the hydrogens are being burnt off saucers are flying around missiles that cannot be understood what sort of intelligence is behind that uh oh mysteriously things are slipping in on the scene with lightning speed i tell you we are near the end he continues and the great pyramid that enoch built enoch built the pyramids the great pyramid and that is why it's such a mystery and they are wandering so much about it the last chamber is now gone through we are now ready for the king's chamber the coming of the lord oh hallelujah glory to god right on top for that's the key stone the capstone is the keystone all the calendars of astronomy points right straight the stars are now declaring it you see the first time he came the wise men looked up and they saw the stars and by the stars they knew that the king was coming messiah was on earth they would recognize it by the presence of the stars in the skies but thank god it in our day it was not stars like the wise men saw back there up in the firmament of the heavens but seven stars that he held in his hands which represents seven messengers or men on the earth and this last one is saying we have now gone through the last chamber ready for the king's chamber amen oh and the stars are pointing to what the coming of the lord pointing to what the presence of jesus christ oh hallelujah where are we at that's out of the ark amen whoa see everywhere prophets have prophesied distress among nations the sea roaring tidal waves carriages going through the highways with great torches running like lightning see we've passed right on by these milestones of prophecy as if there were nothing at all why because the people do not recognize what is happening around them they not recognizing these things when they take place only the spiritual minded are catching signs of his coming oh praise god the nearness of his coming now in the bible we are living in the last day do you believe it i believe it i believe we are living in the last days now amen we are at the top of the pyramid amen praise god we have come through the cross fishes of the age of cancer age in the zeldiac we in the now in the time of the coming of leo the lion what in the camping stone in the days of the manifestations of the sons of god so that catholic storm comes in the time of the manifestation of the sons of god see where we're at we're right at the end time oh thank god enoch completed that pyramid in his day oh my see and we come through them chambers and so forth and it's speaking right now you see right there he's telling you that pyramid stands as a silent witness and by its awesome presence it's a testimony it's enoch's testimony written there in stone it's enoch's testimony and it's speaking to us and he says here now it speaks right to us to the end time now see that's what it is they're in the king's chamber now see naturally speaking the headstone was never put on that pyramid oh they don't know how they ever built it they don't know how he not built it they don't understand it could how could it be even a razor slice couldn't go along the sides they can't find where the water should be there is no martyr in it it's just perfected perfectly put together and that's what it is amen when christ and the church becomes one there is no mortar between nothing between god and the person christ and the person there is nothing between you remember that old song nothing between my soul and the savior not of this world's illusive dreams i have renounced all sinful pleasures jesus is mine and there's nothing between nothing between and this is the hour when the bride and christ the word have become one no mortar no difference no separations hallelujah i and the father are one amen glory to god amen yes sir so thanks be to god hallelujah notice the headstone has never been found i know there's extra stone of scone that they have in england and that is to ordain their kings or to crown their kings but this headstone oh my listen on the american dollar bill you'll see it on an american dollar bill and an eagle with spears in his hand and then you'll see on the other side seal of the united states of america and the next site is what is a pyramid and above that pyramid is a great eye looking out there and under it it says the great seal well what grant seal what seal greater than the seal of this nation even above the seal of our nation we as believers of course know that that is the seal of god a sign of the holy spirit the presence of the living god amen you see god is making even the sinner speak he's causing the nations to speak without knowing it but he is making them speak you see that head seal that corner stone that capstone of the pyramid was rejected see which of course was the son of god hallelujah they rejected him then in that form under that title and that he had back there and they're rejecting him again today in the presence change of his ministry hallelujah as the word made flesh back then in one man called named and called jesus christ and in a bright form in multitudes of elected saints of god separated called out and placed positionally for their work here on earth amen and when their work is done then they're called home into the presence of almighty god from whence they came unto whom they shall return amen amen so we are standing what in the time of enoch sign of the great pyramid and time to enter that king's chamber we're at the last church age with the last messenger ready for that guard that was guarding and protecting the world to move out of the scene so that the king will bid you enter and you'll come by invitation under the end the guidance of the holy spirit of the living god hallelujah amen now in not before the antediluvian destruction when justification was coming in he brought forth a sign and in this pyramid we find there is seven steps going up to the king's chamber watch watch now on the seventh step oh see what comes out to take one of the guard the last one one on each stair right one in each step and the last one comes out to take you in and introduce you to the king hallelujah watch i want you to watch and notice whose station that is standing there and then you'll recognize and be able to see the day in which you are living in in the pyramid he was trying to let the people know that he was that lost guard he was the last star messenger to be able to bring you to the presence of the king hallelujah amen now in this pyramid as i've said was seven steps and there to the king's chamber but to get there remember now we are now in the seventh church age before the king takes his throne oh glory to god amen my friends that is so plain so straightforward if you can't see that then you're certainly spiritually blinded this is not something man made or made up by me or any other person this is from how to the mouth of god's prophet just thus saith the lord hallelujah amen oh praise god amen that my friends blasphemous names amen future home of the heavenly bride and the earthly uh uh the earthly bride and the heavenly bridegroom amen now did you notice quoting from the seventh seal did you notice in the pyramids now notice i do not preach a pyramid message or a pyramid religion see but we know certainly that the pyramid and its foundation goes right up into the king's chamber but just before you hit you hit that seventh introduction step amen see there's a little introduction plan plank there an introduction area where that one last one would introduce you where a messenger comes out there to bring you to the king or bless god i thank god for our precious brother i take god for the holy spirit using him to bring us to the king bring us to the king word bring us to the word of god made manifested revealed to us and making itself clear to us by the inspiration of the holy spirit this is not forsaken for healing of the satan and the discerning of spirits but this is the revealing of the word this is the spoken word making itself manifest as it lives in and through the hearts and lines of the believers oh blessed be the name of the living god now when you get to that seventh wall there there there is an introduction plank where a messenger comes out to bring you to the king thank god he helped to bring me to the king but you see the headstone was rejected they don't know where it's at because it's a rejected stone but that's the stone that will kept the whole thing amen that is what makes it amen the pyramid after completing seven church ages that's what makes it you see that one is natural you can see it with your eyes but spiritually hallelujah the church was being built a city four square being built up a new jerusalem beautiful like a bride adorned for her husband blessed be the lord amen and there it is see for the stone caps the whole thing that makes it the pyramid through them seven church ages hallelujah and it all works that way then he talks about adding grace and adding all these and that has been something misunderstood a lot of people thinking that you can add those things to yourself not having a revelation of it but god use that for his glory to draw people closer to him until it gets up to christ who is the head stone listen and the headstone is the door for i am the door jesus christ is the headstone and he says i am the door hallelujah god's only provided place of worship on praise god friends i'd like to share with you the words of this beautiful old song that goes this way in the upper room with jesus sitting at the mercy seat daily there my sins confessing seeking there his mercy sweet trusting in his love and merit as i seek for him in prayer speaking there with him in secret telling him where my weary feet have trod there in the upper room with jesus my lord and your god now i'm quoting from the seventh seal and now as certain as i stand at this platform tonight i had a revelation that revealed and that revelation is in a three-fold manner that i will speak to you by god's help one fold of it and then you you let's go over that first here is the revelation see those seven thunders that he heard thunder right and was forbidden to write that's what the mystery is laying behind is them seven consecutive thunders rolling out and here it says brother ran him wrapped his hand on the pulpit seven times one two three four five six sev he wrapped his hands on the pulpit like that now see it is the secret behind that that no one knows about hallelujah and john was forbidden to write it oh praise god now brothers do you see you hear myself and maybe others say and speak of the unwritten word the devil in turn twists that and tries to get fault to believe that it's something you're adding on to the word or you're trying to make up your own revelation and and place it in there or you're trying to make yourself spiritual but that's not the case it's out of god's own prophet's mouth he was forbidden to write the words that rolled out roared out and spoke out for that was the voice of the mighty angel speaking who was who is what christ the word speaking but he was forbidden to write he couldn't write that part oh my let's go on hallelujah see he was forbidden to write it not even a symbol which means he wasn't even the right words because words are symbols uh you know to symbolize meaning so he wasn't allowed to write see oh my see and so why there was no activity in heaven and the reason why because it might give away the secret god's great secret would be discovered because the devil is everywhere always peeping and prying and looking and searching and trying to find the secret things of god to copycat to get as close as he possibly can for he's not a creator he's a perverter he uses what god has already made and there's a lot of people with that nature they can't create them for themselves so they they'll steal they'll lie they'll cheat they'll take other people's things and then they'll pervert it and then they'll claim they created it their claim ownership of it but here look look at the word oh see it might give the secret away oh my what the thunder sound right out seven straight thunders right in a row one two three four five six rolling thunder oh my see what a perfect number what that's speaking of the perfect word out of the mouth of god seven thunders in a row amen see there it is my brothers and sisters we see the word of god and the heavens could not write it the heavens or the angels they knew nothing about it nothing else about it it was a relaxing time it was great because it was kept secret from the angels friends when you enter into this little room of revelation of divine wisdom and understanding you've come to a rest you've come to relaxation in god you're broke through every song barrier and there you are resting in his grace love and mercy oh praise god you're not keeping yourself you don't have to work yourself up into anything you don't have to my friends do anything of your own self but salvation is of the lord and you rest in his love and great mercy amen hallelujah oh my wow why was it kept so secret no why you see if satan could get a hold of it he might do great damage but there is one thing he don't know see now he can interpret anything else he wants to interpret i want you to understand that the devil is so cunning so slice or slick so smart so intellectual and intelligent that he can analyze debate and he can parse things and bring them down to little bits and pieces you see he can interpret anything he wants to and he can impersonate any kind of a gift gift and brother branham pauses here to say i hope you are learning something here amen he can impersonate any kind of a gift he knew very well after he's gone people are gonna rise up and impersonate discernment impersonate calling people out of their seats and their names and various things like that there will be impersonators just like moses had his impersonators that will throw down their snakes and say oh look i'm doing the same thing like him and it's nothing of the kind there's only one like that in every age the rest are impersonators and copycats whoever they be this is not to do with the individual the person but the spirit that's motivating them making them think they're doing god a service but not doing his perfect will amen yes there it is he can impersonate any kind of a gift but he cannot know this nor impersonate it for it's not even written in the word the unwritten word it's a total secret it's the word but it was that that was not allowed to be written down oh my hallelujah oh praise god amen the angels were shut out of it if they even made one move they will give it give something away so they all decided to shut up they'll quit their hopping i hope a lot of people will quit that everything stopped right there you see seven god's perfect number amen and he knocks on the puppet seven more times amen right down the road seven thunders uttered right straight together and they uttered like they were saying or spelling out something something was being said something was being said words were being said right and john started to write it amen hallelujah but he was stopped he said don't write it john don't write it hallelujah oh my spoken but not allowed to be written amen do you get it holy men of god wrote as they were what inspired by the holy spirit they were able to write it and it's the same way in this day and in this hour remember they did not have any written bible at the time but by inspiration of the holy spirit they knew god's truth and then when it was time when they were permitted then they wrote it in what we know now as the bible but everything has gone its full circle its full cycle and the seventh day must give way to the eighth day and the inspiration and the anointing that was upon them in that day to make them write the word that same inspiration has come back in this day the blessed one knowing to fill up people that they might not write it in the terms of a book but they are the living epistles of the living god living bibles living walking words of god they are expressions of the almighty on the face of the earth hallelujah sons and daughters of god with all of his characteristics and his mannerisms because the holy spirit flows through them praise god forevermore the mighty god in christ now christ in the church the kingdom coming oh blessed be the name of the lord amen what is it the angels in heaven don't even know it but it's there it was spoken so it's there but john wasn't allowed to write it oh praise god what is it the word of god cannot return to him void and the word the unwritten word is there it's here among us whoa and those who were elected and anointed him that had an ear or he or she that was given an heir to hear given the spiritual eye of the heart to see amen they'll see it they'll hear it they'll understand it while others are peeking and prying and theologizing and wondering and everything else god will make it clear hallelujah for he is his own interpreter and he'll make the world clear to your soul that you'll recognize him whatever it is that he is doing amen oh my yes you see if satan could get a hold of it he could do great damage you will have to take my word for this but i know if i'm planning to do something i know better than to tell anybody about it not that the person would tell it but satan would hear me saying it and he can get it amen he but he can't get it if in my heart it's there as long as god has got it in my heart closed up with the holy spirit then it's between me and god alone you see he's talking now about when an individual into the king's chamber enter the little room and they have a conference with god and god begins to speak with them and reveal things to them then my brother son certain things are locked up in the heart oh glory to god it's locked up amen inside of the heart and the devil can't get it while it's locked up inside of the heart for it's sealed or closed up by the holy spirit and the devil can't get to it amen hallelujah he don't know nothing about it until you speak it then he hears it oh my friends i have to told people a certain certain thing then you watch the devil cut off every avenue every wheel that he can to get there and beat me to it but if i get a revelation from god and don't say nothing about it then it's different remember when i say to you satan will try to impersonate he'll try to impersonate everything that the church will do he thinks by doing that that's me speaking now he that that by doing that he he'll suddenly find the right thing or or he'll he'll slip into the right thing that he couldn't see or couldn't understand maybe if he studies the message more maybe if he spend more time with the listening to the tapes alone then he'll get it or or or if he goes another way whatever way it is but he can't get it so he'll try to impersonate it he's going to manufacture something he'll try to impersonate he's tried to do it we notice it he's done it through the antichrist amen but there's one thing he cannot personate there'll be no miracles to this you see cause he don't know it there's nowhere for him to know it for this is the third pull praise god now how simple that is but a lot of folk have been distracted they have been thrown off balance they the they've just gone off with their ideas of what this third pull is about just by taking a mass of quotations and massive sayings putting them together and thinking that that will give them it that doesn't give you it the holy spirit is the one that has to bring you into the room oh no only the spirit of god after the invitation by the last guard messenger star on the stairway oh my then the king invites you to come oh my and then my friends no one else has anything to do with it not the last messenger nobody it's you now and god alone as you enter into his presence but a revelation of the holy spirit oh praise god forevermore amen yes sir for this is the third paul amen he knows nothing about it he doesn't understand it there's a secret that lays behind there amen glory to god in the highest i can't never think be think or be the same for the rest of my life when i seen that now i don't know i know the next step there but i don't know what or how to interpret that it won't be long i got it right down here when it happened and when i got there the voice said stop going off further than this right here now he said i am not prone to be a fanatic but i'm just telling you the truth stop right there you see because he had come in the room himself and others will have to come in by one by one they gain the portal one by one they enter the door one by one they come into the presence of the king amen do you remember little shoe i tried to explain all them things and by my speaking about how the soul laid next to this next to that i started to talk about conscience and this and that all kind of stuff and it only made a bunch of impersonations start after that why lots of people start going out talking about the soul talking about the soul this and the soul that and the soul that oh my my brother my sister and how they have to others took up a hand other people waited look for vibrations everybody had a vibration in their hand everybody had a this or that oh now you remember but he took me up there and said this is that turtle and no one will know it you remember that these visions never fail they are perfectly the truth you will find that in the seventh seal now my friends when our work here on earth is done then let us go into the real upper room above to be with jesus while we are down here we just come into the little room amen and i tell you wonderful things happen when you get into that king's chamber into the little room naturally speaking i was reading of how they were talking but when you're in that king's chamber there in egypt it seems the walls are made of stones that are tons and tons but when you speak in there your words begin to sound so harmon harmonic that the walls start to feel like liquid almost with the sounds at something to do with words carried amen the way it was built but let's not look to the natural thing that has its mysteries but spiritually speaking friends wonderful things happen when you enter that little room like the woman went in she went and crippled came back out hold what happened to you and there i don't know all i know is that i'm healed like like bartimaeus oh i don't know i was blind but now i see praise god no matter what happens god's spirit is moving amen look at the apostles went into that upper room and there to be with jesus and they came out as different men wonderful things started happening in their hearts and lives oh praise god peter in the upper upper part of a room of that building caught up in a vision his entire life and ministry changed because he was in the upper room with jesus he had climbed the seven steps of perfection amen praise god do you realize friends we have come through seven church ages seven sabbaths seven 7 49 and on the 50th day it's another petty cross the eighth day in other words another eight day the power of the holy spirit coming down and taking over the bride of christ taking over the hearts and lives of the true elect amen glory to god amen we come back right here into the place where we can have a conference with god holy convocation amen were you meeting with him to have holy communion in that secret place amen hallelujah amen that bride like jacob walks up them seven steps amen and she comes to the last stairway and she steps into the eighth day she steps into the heavenly place she steps into the king's chamber and her soul wins and awakens to the eternal day her soul weakens a new day her soul awakens my friends that she will and she becomes what full of wisdom and understanding and revelation by the holy spirit of god anointing her to see his word amen amen just as much as israel took her journey through and came from the very bosom and loins of abraham went down into egypt and there were enslaved later came out and walked through the wilderness and from the wilderness god brought them cross the river jordan into the promised land they cross over their gap their cross over their chasm their river jordan they cross over now we got to cross over from time to eternity we got to cross over from the seventh day week of the ages into the eighth day of the holy spirit oh praise god where god's words light up bright and fair with the shining light of the dead star from one eye shining on the word of god making it clean and clear to you hallelujah amen oh thank god my friends that israel did all the journey but thank god the bride's journey is different she journeyed not from the loins of abraham in the bosom of abraham but from the very bosom of god and the mind of god hallelujah into this sin cursed egypt world that we're living in hallelujah amen oh praise god but because she is an attribute of god and a gene she came through the wilderness of satan's sandbox full of tricks and traps to catch her and confuse her confuse her with her with his denominational maze of denominations like that all claiming the truth and their maze of interpretations that they have all around you amen but she has come into the king's chamber of the opening of the word to her where she can enter into her inheritance of a perfect understanding and interpretation of the word of god yes we have she has journeyed through the hot sands and the dry deserts criticisms misunderstandings they don't understand that it's the same god now being misunderstood in his people misunderstood in his servants misunderstood as the word of god is unfolded amen yes sir she has found the vestibule of heaven the entryway she has gone through the foyer and has climbed up the golden stairs oh my god and
