[4:19] higher tonight? Amen.
[4:22] But so above anything that will try to
[4:24] hinder us from fulfilling God's promises
[4:26] for our lives. Welcome into the house of
[4:28] the Lord. We're so happy to be in his
[4:30] presence. See, where twos and trees are
[4:32] gathered, he's here in the midst. Amen.

[9:40] Hallelujah. Let's bow our eyes before
[9:42] the Lord.
[9:44] Beloved Jesus,
[9:46] what a song, Lord, to declare your
[9:48] glory. Lord,
[9:50] you're awesome in our hearts. Lord,
[9:53] we sing because, oh God, that there's a
[9:57] joy that you've placed in our hearts,
[9:58] Lord, that we could sing. Each and every
[10:00] one of us have a testimony, Lord, that
[10:01] we could say that you deserve the glory
[10:05] and the honor, Lord. Each and every one
[10:08] of us, you've done something for us,
[10:10] Lord.
[10:11] Most of us could identify one thing that
[10:14] you have called us unto adoption and
[10:18] full authority in this hour. And that is
[10:21] a great thing, Lord. So we thank you,
[10:23] Lord, Father, in spite of everything, oh
[10:26] God, that you've done for us, Lord, and
[10:30] you still doing for us, Lord Jesus. And
[10:32] we are so grateful to know a God like
[10:34] you.
[10:36] We thank you, Lord. We give you honor.
[10:38] We give you praise tonight, Lord. We
[10:39] come into your house because there's a
[10:42] desire, Lord, for us to
[10:44] become more and more like you, Lord, to
[10:46] shake off anything that is not of you,
[10:48] Father.
[10:49] So may you come and speak to our hearts
[10:51] tonight, Lord. May you
[10:54] speak something into our in our DNA,
[10:56] Lord, tonight, Lord, that we can leave
[10:58] here a better people, Father. That's our
[11:00] desire, Lord. Not to hear a good sermon,
[11:03] not to come and hear a good song, Lord,
[11:05] but to for it to manifest our life, Lord
[11:08] Jesus. That's our desire, Lord Jesus, to
[11:11] shake off anything that is not of you,
[11:13] Father.
[11:15] Lord, as your brother would come and
[11:16] speak, Lord, let you move him out of the
[11:18] way and just speak through him tonight.
[11:20] Lord, may you get all the praise and all
[11:23] the glory when it's all said and done,
[11:25] Lord. Those that was not able to make it
[11:28] in tonight at home streaming, oh God,
[11:30] may you go to their homes, Lord, through
[11:34] the channels, Lord, and may they feel
[11:36] your presence, Lord. They didn't hear a
[11:38] word from you tonight, Lord. Speak to
[11:41] each and every one of us. That's our
[11:42] desire tonight. We give you thanks. We
[11:45] give you praise. In Jesus name we pray.
[11:49] Amen. Amen. Father.
[11:55] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[12:02] face.
[12:05] here to sing forever
[12:10] of his saving grace.
[12:15] On the streets of glory,
[12:20] let me beneath my voice.
[12:24] Cares on pass. Oh my love
[12:30] to rejoice.
[12:34] As I journey true,
[12:38] singing as I go,
[12:43] pointed souls to Calary
[12:47] to the gra.
[12:52] Many arrows kiss my soul from way
[12:57] without
[13:01] my Lord
[13:04] be on you.
[13:08] Oh,
[13:10] I want to see
[13:13] my love upon his face
[13:19] to sing forever
[13:23] of his saving grace. Hallelujah.
[13:27] on the streams of glory.
[13:31] Let me lift my voice
[13:35] and hear so much. Oh my last
[13:41] to rejoice
[13:44] and wait in service for my Lord that may
[13:50] be
[13:51] [Music]
[13:54] more close to me. He will give me life.
[14:00] I see that snares defects my soul. Turn
[14:06] my torch the sun.
[14:10] But my Lord knows
[14:15] whatever I
[14:20] want to sing
[14:23] upon his face
[14:27] here to sing forever
[14:31] of his saving. Halleluah.
[14:35] on the streets of glory.
[14:40] and be my
[14:43] [Music]
[14:44] so
[14:46] my last
[14:53] [Music]
[15:02] savior
[15:05] in the fire
[15:08] with A tender hand I'll stretch toward
[15:13] the valley.
[15:16] He's hiding me. I can see onward as I
[15:23] go. Oh,
[15:26] I want to see him. Look upon his face
[15:33] here to sing forever
[15:38] of receiving praise. Hallelujah.
[15:42] On the streets of glory.
[15:46] Let me lift my voice.
[15:52] Oh my.
[15:57] Oh, I want
[15:59] I want to see
[16:02] I look up
[16:05] [Music]
[16:07] there to sing forever.
[16:11] I receive grace
[16:15] on your streets of glory.
[16:20] in Bel.
[16:22] [Music]
[16:26] Oh my last
[16:29] to rejoice. One more time.
[16:32] Oh, I want to see
[16:36] [Music]
[16:37] upon his face
[16:42] to see for
[16:45] all his saving grace.
[16:50] on the streets of glory
[16:54] and be lifted.
[16:56] [Music]
[17:00] Oh my lust ever to rejoice.
[17:08] Amen. Let's sing that song. I'm so glad
[17:10] Jesus set me free. Amen. How many happy
[17:14] tonight to be in the house of the Lord?
[17:17] Hallelujah.
[17:18] I'm so glad Jesus set me free. Oh, I'm
[17:23] so glad
[17:26] Jesus set me free.
[17:29] I'm so glad that Jesus set me free. Oh,
[17:35] I'm so glad that Jesus set me free. I'm
[17:41] singing glory. Hallelujah.
[17:44] Oh, Jesus set me free. Happy
[17:51] Jesus.
[17:56] [Music]
[18:04] Jesus set me free. I'm singing glory.
[18:08] Hallelujah.
[18:10] Oh Jesus set me free. I'm on my way to
[18:13] heaven. On my way to heaven and shouting
[18:17] victory.
[18:20] I'm on my way to heaven for shouting
[18:24] victory. Hallelujah.
[18:28] Heaven I'm shouting victory.
[18:32] singing glory. Hallelujah.
[18:36] Jesus set me free.
[18:41] Hallelujah.
[18:44] Some of you are singing like Jesus
[18:46] hasn't set you free. So, we're going to
[18:48] try it again. I want us together. Let's
[18:50] clap our hands. We've come to church to
[18:53] have a good time. Amen.
[18:56] I know we go through battles, but when
[18:58] we come to the house of the Lord, we
[19:00] come to give God praise.
[19:02] We come to show the devil whose side
[19:05] we're on. So, we're going to sing one
[19:07] more time. Jesus set me free. Let's clap
[19:10] our hands. Rejoice.
[19:13] And you body, whatever you tell
[19:14] yourself, that's what your body will do.
[19:18] Hallelujah. So, we're going to try that
[19:20] one more time. I'm so glad that Jesus
[19:23] set me free. And we're going to clap our
[19:25] hands and show the devil whose side
[19:28] we're on tonight. Praise God. Oh, I'm so
[19:33] glad.
[19:36] Hallelujah. I'm so glad that Jesus set
[19:42] me free. Oh, I'm so glad that Jesus set
[19:48] me free. Singing glory. Hallelujah.
[19:53] Jesus set me free.
[19:58] Hallelujah.
[20:00] I'm grateful to be a Christian.
[20:04] And I trust that if you have given your
[20:06] life to the Lord that your experience
[20:10] serving the Lord is not boring, but it's
[20:12] a joy.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, I just want to say thank
[20:16] you musicians. How many appreciate our
[20:19] musicians? Let's give them a hand.
[20:24] Amen.
[20:27] I thank God for his mercy and goodness
[20:31] tonight.
[20:32] And um how many believe that Jesus is
[20:37] real?
[20:39] &gt;&gt; I mean real like he's real to you. Not
[20:41] just because I ask you, but you know
[20:43] that he is real to you. And I trust that
[20:46] somehow
[20:48] if you haven't come to that place where
[20:50] God is real to you, that he will reveal
[20:52] himself to you because religion is not
[20:55] boring. It's a joy to serve the Lord.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have some needs on your
[21:02] hearts tonight, just raise your hand.
[21:05] And uh we're going to go to the Lord in
[21:07] prayer before we go into the message
[21:08] tonight. Thank you, Lord. Heavenly
[21:10] Father, we're grateful to be in your
[21:13] house today. Lord, we are here because
[21:16] of you, not because we've come to see
[21:18] each other. Lord, there could be better
[21:21] places, Lord, we could be tonight.
[21:24] But you told us in your word, forsake
[21:26] not the assembling of yourselves,
[21:29] Lord. Even as we see the the days
[21:31] becoming more evil and the world
[21:34] becoming cold, religion, oh God is just
[21:39] something the people are wearing
[21:41] nowadays, Lord. But father, we want to
[21:44] be fire brands for Jesus. We want to
[21:47] show Satan whose side we are on, Lord.
[21:50] Not because of our own will, but because
[21:53] you have called us in this hour, Lord,
[21:56] to represent you as sons and daughters
[21:59] of God. Tonight, oh God, I rebuke every
[22:03] cold spirit, Lord. Every spirit of the
[22:06] enemy, Lord God, that may try to bind
[22:09] your people, oh God, we subdue every
[22:13] demonic attack in the name of Jesus.
[22:17] Because Lord, we have come to the house
[22:19] of God. The Bible says that the joy of
[22:22] the Lord is my strength.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; So we thank you, Father, tonight. We've
[22:27] come here, Lord God, not to to to just
[22:30] fill the pews, but Lord, to show that we
[22:34] are here to worship the King of Kings
[22:37] &gt;&gt; and the Lord of Lords.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; Speak to our hearts tonight, Lord. Touch
[22:41] those who are sick. Brother Bill, oh
[22:43] God, who wasn't feeling well today, oh
[22:45] God. Lord, we trust that the prayers
[22:47] that have gone up, Lord, they have
[22:49] reached you and somehow, oh, Father, the
[22:52] answer has already come. Strengthen your
[22:55] people. Speak to us tonight. We pray in
[22:58] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[23:01] Amen.
[23:03] So before we um sit down, I just want us
[23:08] to read uh two scriptures. The first one
[23:12] we are going to read while you're
[23:13] standing and then I'll ask you to be
[23:15] seated. Uh we're going to turn to Isaiah
[23:18] chapter 14
[23:20] uh verse 12- 17.
[23:25] And uh before I read the scripture, I
[23:28] just want to read this quote I came
[23:29] across the other day and it really
[23:31] blessed me. It's not a quote of the
[23:33] prophet. It's just a quotation. The
[23:36] author is anonymous. But he says this,
[23:39] God didn't call you to be light.
[23:43] He called you to be light.
[23:47] And light by its very nature makes
[23:51] darkness uncomfortable.
[23:54] And so tonight, by the grace of God, by
[23:57] the help of the spirit of God, we trust
[23:59] that we can
[24:02] expose the enemy
[24:05] that often times comes in a very cunning
[24:08] way to take victory away from God's
[24:11] people. And I believe as the Bible says
[24:14] that Jesus, the Bible says that the life
[24:17] that was in him was the life of men. And
[24:21] so if the Holy Spirit has come into your
[24:23] life, if the Holy Spirit is here, surely
[24:27] we should be the most happy people
[24:30] because we are not walking in darkness.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; So we're going to read Isaiah 14 and
[24:37] then uh verse 12-1 17. Then you'll have
[24:40] your seats and then we shall proceed
[24:41] from there. Amen.
[24:46] It says, "How art thou fallen from
[24:48] heaven, oh Lucifer,
[24:52] son of the morning,
[24:54] how art thou cut down to the ground,
[24:58] which did weaken the nations?
[25:02] For thou has said in thine heart,
[25:06] I will ascend into heaven.
[25:10] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[25:15] of God.
[25:17] I will sit also upon the mount of the
[25:21] congregation
[25:22] in the sides of the north.
[25:26] I will ascend above the heights of the
[25:28] clouds.
[25:30] I will be like the most high. I want you
[25:35] to pay attention to the conceited nature
[25:38] of this fellow.
[25:40] Basically conceited means to be
[25:42] excessively proud of oneself.
[25:47] Everything is about me, myself and I.
[25:54] And this is the nature of the enemy that
[25:55] we are fighting.
[25:57] I like to call it the trinity of self.
[26:01] Amen. Then verse 15,
[26:05] yet thou shalt be cast down to hell to
[26:08] the sides of the pit.
[26:11] They that see thee thee shall narrowly
[26:15] look upon thee and consider thee,
[26:19] saying, Is this the man
[26:22] that made the earth to tremble?
[26:26] That did shake kingdoms,
[26:30] that made the world as a wilderness and
[26:33] destroy the cities thereof, that open
[26:36] not the house of his prisoners? You may
[26:40] have your seats. God bless you.
[26:48] Amen.
[26:50] So for our subject tonight, I want to
[26:53] speak on the trail of the serpent
[26:57] in connection to the fall of men.
[27:01] The trail of the serpent in connection
[27:03] to the fall of men.
[27:07] As I was preparing this message and
[27:08] whatever the Lord put on my heart,
[27:12] I not sure if I'll finish this, but if I
[27:14] don't, God willing, another time maybe
[27:17] we'll finish it, but I'll just do my
[27:20] best to depend on the leading of the
[27:21] spirit. Amen. How many believe in the
[27:25] leading of the Holy Ghost?
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:30] So, we're going to look at this
[27:34] quotation by the prophet in the message
[27:37] Satan's Eden preached in 1965.
[27:40] The prophet says, "It's been
[27:43] and now is Satan is establishing his
[27:47] kingdom in the earth."
[27:51] That's exactly why he's doing it.
[27:55] for he wants to establish his own
[27:59] kingdom.
[28:02] As a businessman,
[28:04] that's not a Christian.
[28:07] He will work every scheme
[28:10] he can to make you see something the
[28:14] wrong way.
[28:17] If he's got a purpose
[28:20] and a personal gain in making you do it,
[28:25] making you see it that way,
[28:28] he will show you everything he can
[28:31] and keep you from the truth of it
[28:34] because he's got a feeling only for
[28:38] himself. Very selfish fellow.
[28:42] no matter how much he lies and cheats
[28:45] and whatever more he's got personal
[28:49] gain. So I want to lay that foundation
[28:52] because that's what we're going to build
[28:54] on so that we understand the nature of
[28:57] our enemy.
[29:00] Now, from what we've read, of course,
[29:03] without going into much detail, and I
[29:05] believe that, you know, you're students
[29:07] of the Bible, that you read your
[29:09] messages, and so some things I'll skim
[29:12] through really quickly,
[29:15] but we know that Satan's ultimate goal
[29:19] has always been one thing,
[29:22] and that is to steal worship away from
[29:25] God.
[29:27] That's it.
[29:30] We know that that was the very thing
[29:32] that was in his heart when iniquity was
[29:35] found. It was because he wanted to exalt
[29:39] himself above the most high God. And I
[29:43] have news for you tonight that he has
[29:46] not changed his plans one way. I mean in
[29:50] any way, shape or form. That desire is
[29:53] still at the core of his heart.
[29:56] And so we're going to see how this
[29:59] wicked
[30:01] enemy of ours has trailed himself
[30:04] through the the ages
[30:07] from the very time that the war was
[30:10] fought in heaven. How till today
[30:14] this enemy
[30:16] is still fighting for the same thing.
[30:20] Hallelujah.
[30:23] And so the second scripture I want to
[30:24] read is in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2
[30:27] verse 3 and 4. If you can just put it up
[30:31] for me please. It says, "Let no man,"
[30:34] this is Paul speaking now. He says, "Let
[30:37] no man deceive you by any means, for
[30:40] that day shall not come except there
[30:43] come a falling away first.
[30:47] and that man of sin
[30:52] be revealed the son of pedition. Now the
[30:55] prophet said that this is the devil
[30:57] himself, Satan himself.
[31:01] Verse four, who opposeth
[31:05] and exaltth himself above all that is
[31:08] called God,
[31:10] all that is worshiped.
[31:12] that he as God setth in the temple of
[31:17] God showing himself that he is God.
[31:24] Brother Brham said that this was the
[31:27] pope
[31:30] in the stage where Satan had now come
[31:34] become fully incarnate in a man.
[31:39] And you can see that the same way God
[31:42] has always been trying to come down from
[31:46] the great eternal spirit to eventually
[31:49] dwell in human beings like us and in his
[31:52] son the Lord Jesus Christ God made flesh
[31:55] whereby he was worshiped
[31:58] as God in a man.
[32:01] How many know that Jesus was worshiped?
[32:06] Don't be afraid to say amen.
[32:09] Amen. Jesus was worshiped and not one
[32:12] time did he refuse to be worshiped
[32:15] because he was God made flesh.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Now we are not God made flesh. Of course
[32:20] we have the spirit of God in measure.
[32:23] The word is of course dwells in us. The
[32:25] spirit but you can't worship me. I can't
[32:27] worship you even though you have the
[32:29] Holy Ghost. But the fullness of God
[32:32] dwells in Christ Jesus. And you find
[32:34] that Satan has been trying to peril the
[32:37] exact same thing that God was doing. And
[32:40] eventually in this scripture we've just
[32:42] read, he achieves that purpose whereby
[32:45] he's incarnate in a man and worshiped as
[32:49] God.
[32:50] Hallelujah. So what is the temple of God
[32:54] that we've just read here in verse four?
[32:58] Let the scriptures answer it because we
[33:00] don't want ideas of men. We want the
[33:02] scriptures to speak. So 1 Corinthians
[33:06] 3:17 says, "If any man defile the temple
[33:11] of God, him shall God destroy. For the
[33:15] temple of God is holy, which temple ye
[33:18] are."
[33:21] Then sec 1 Corinthians 6:9 it says what
[33:25] know ye not that your body is the temple
[33:28] of the Holy Ghost which is in you which
[33:31] ye which ye have of God and ye are not
[33:36] your own. So this bodies that we that
[33:40] God created God's purpose was to dwell
[33:44] in man.
[33:46] And now Satan being a perverted that he
[33:48] is,
[33:50] he does the exact same thing that God
[33:52] was trying to do and becomes incarnate
[33:55] in a man so that he can be worshiped as
[33:58] God in a man.
[34:03] Let's see what the prophet said about
[34:05] that in the message, the God of this
[34:08] evil age. He says, notice what this
[34:11] fellow will do. Now he's referring to
[34:12] the scripture we just read. 2
[34:14] Thessalonians 2.
[34:17] This fellow, he was set in the temple of
[34:20] God. That is the church
[34:26] revealing himself to be God.
[34:33] The church. He's not talking about the
[34:36] bride. He's talking about the Roman
[34:38] Catholic Church.
[34:41] the number one enemy to God, the number
[34:45] one enemy to Christianity.
[34:49] Never forget that Satan has had the
[34:52] greatest success through religion.
[34:56] Forget about what you see out in the
[34:57] world or you might see, you know, the
[35:00] rock and roll parties and uh rappers and
[35:03] all these things. Those are just
[35:06] sideshows. But Satan has always had his
[35:09] greatest success through religion. And
[35:13] that's where we are supposed to keep our
[35:15] eyes.
[35:16] Hallelujah.
[35:20] So man was created to be the temple of
[35:22] God.
[35:25] And this is exactly where Satan had his
[35:28] success when he eventually will become
[35:31] incarnate in a man called the pope.
[35:36] I know this is this this is not uh
[35:40] easy things to say in public,
[35:44] but it's the truth.
[35:47] We know that some of these things could
[35:49] cost us our lives speaking like what I'm
[35:52] speaking tonight.
[35:55] But we must be able to speak truth as
[35:58] the Bible
[36:00] speaks.
[36:02] The problem with too many of us, we are
[36:04] afraid to take a stand for God.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; We are ashamed of our testimony.
[36:09] Somebody ask you, are you a Christian?
[36:11] Well, you know, I go to church. Going to
[36:14] church doesn't make you a Christian.
[36:16] Hallelujah. You've got to be able to
[36:19] identify to be identified with Christ in
[36:21] the way you live, in your conduct.
[36:24] Everything about you should speak of
[36:27] your testimony.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:30] Praise God.
[36:33] So in any kind of warfare, you've got to
[36:36] know who your enemy is. And the problem
[36:39] with a lot of us, myself included, is we
[36:42] forget many times who our enemy is.
[36:46] Brother Brham says
[36:49] people don't believe in demons in this
[36:51] day, but the thing to do to my opinion
[36:54] is to know your enemy
[36:57] because you are going to meet him.
[37:01] Hallelujah.
[37:03] We are living in the most treacherous
[37:05] time, the worst age of all ages, but yet
[37:09] is the most glorious age of all ages.
[37:13] Why? Because God has come down.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He has come down in the form
[37:20] of the Holy Spirit. He has sent us
[37:23] Malachi 4. And as brother Arab says, we
[37:27] have the answer to the devil's question.
[37:31] This message is not just to make us
[37:35] bigheaded and say that we have the
[37:36] truth.
[37:39] God came to give us a message so that we
[37:42] can know how to fight
[37:44] skillfully.
[37:46] Amen.
[37:48] So, we've got the greatest thing in our
[37:50] hands. But I'm convinced that too many
[37:52] of us we are just playing with it. We
[37:56] let the messages sit on our shelves,
[37:59] accumulate digital dust. We don't read,
[38:02] we don't pray, but we're just content
[38:04] with coming to church. Coming to church
[38:07] alone will not save you. Hallelujah.
[38:10] You've got to come to a place where you
[38:12] know God for yourself.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[38:17] I often say, and I tell this to my
[38:19] family, my kids. I said, "It doesn't
[38:22] matter how much your dad or your mom are
[38:25] Christians.
[38:26] Young people, listen to me in the name
[38:28] of the Lord. You have to meet God
[38:30] yourself.
[38:33] You God has no grandchildren."
[38:36] Hallelujah. You've got to come to a
[38:39] place where you know God for yourself.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[38:47] So,
[38:50] we have an enemy
[38:54] who is very cunning.
[38:57] Sorry.
[38:59] And he's determined to kill you, to
[39:03] steal, to destroy you.
[39:06] He is not playing games. The Bible says
[39:10] he came to kill, to steal, and to
[39:13] destroy. So he means business.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; So we also must mean business with God.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Every day that we wake up, think about
[39:26] it in this sense. God gives you
[39:29] a day to live. For example, today
[39:34] develop the mindset that Lord, you've
[39:36] given me another day.
[39:39] Help me to be my best for you.
[39:43] Amen.
[39:45] Because the enemy
[39:47] every single day, he wakes up with a
[39:50] determination that he's either going to
[39:52] kill you, to steal from you, and to
[39:55] destroy you.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; So, we are in the business of souls.
[40:01] Amen. We're in the business of fighting
[40:03] for souls. And I don't come here tonight
[40:06] to try and say things to please you
[40:08] because I'm responsible for what I say.
[40:11] Every minister that comes behind this
[40:13] desk is responsible for what they say.
[40:17] So
[40:19] let's go now a bit deeper
[40:22] and break into
[40:24] this wicked person that we're dealing
[40:27] with. And I first want to go back and
[40:30] see how this battle began.
[40:35] And in order to understand this, we need
[40:37] to understand
[40:39] how the angels actually fell
[40:42] to bring us to where today we are today.
[40:45] Amen.
[40:50] I'm going to say some things tonight
[40:52] which might seem a bit deep and
[40:54] mysterious to you, but I want to keep it
[40:58] as simple as I can because I believe God
[41:00] is simple.
[41:02] And brother Brana makes this statement.
[41:04] He says you have to depend on the Holy
[41:07] Spirit because this Bible
[41:10] is wrought in riddles.
[41:14] You can't just sit down and read it like
[41:17] a newspaper.
[41:18] Is that right? He says it's hid. Yes,
[41:22] sir.
[41:25] You would how would you ever justify God
[41:28] when he told Moses up there said now
[41:32] don't you make any engraven images that
[41:35] was in his commandments don't you make
[41:38] anything like heaven or angel or
[41:42] anything else don't make any graven
[41:45] images and yet on the same day told him
[41:49] to mold two angels out of brass and put
[41:53] them right at the mercy seat where mercy
[41:56] is at. Then the prophet says you have to
[42:00] know God and his nature.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we want to understand the
[42:06] nature of God and we want to understand
[42:07] the nature of Satan.
[42:10] So
[42:12] I believe that prior to Genesis 1:1,
[42:17] God had already created the angels and
[42:22] was in existence existing with them in
[42:25] another dimension.
[42:29] Amen.
[42:33] Genesis 1
[42:36] 26 says this. I'm going to try and prove
[42:38] what I'm saying by the scriptures.
[42:41] And God said, "Let us
[42:44] make man in our image,
[42:49] after our likeness,
[42:52] and let them have dominion over the
[42:54] fish, sorry, over the fish of the sea,
[42:58] and over the fowl of the air, and over
[43:01] the cattle, and so so on and so on.
[43:06] Now we all know that when God was
[43:09] speaking here, the image that he's
[43:10] referring to is not this here. This is
[43:13] not the image of man or image of God.
[43:15] Sorry.
[43:17] This is fashion after animals. Brother
[43:20] Bernham says we have feet like a bear
[43:22] and hands like monkeys and so forth.
[43:26] But the image that God was talking about
[43:28] is spirit. God is a spirit.
[43:31] Amen.
[43:33] Adam was first made a spirit man and
[43:35] then eventually God made a body and put
[43:37] him in that body.
[43:40] So let's follow that thought very
[43:42] closely.
[43:44] Now hear what the prophet said. Now what
[43:46] I'm going to say here has been something
[43:49] controversial.
[43:50] I've heard all kinds of interpretations
[43:52] and to be honest I was off too until I
[43:55] came across this. And I thank God that
[43:59] when God's prophet speaks, we drop our
[44:02] ideas
[44:04] because this is God's mouthpiece to us.
[44:09] If my ideas or another preacher's ideas
[44:12] are contrary to what the prophet said,
[44:15] we leave that aside and take what he
[44:18] said. Secondly, it needs to line up with
[44:21] the Bible. We can't just take a quote
[44:24] and run off with it because the Bible
[44:27] and what the prophet said are not two
[44:29] separate things. They are the same self
[44:32] thing. So let's hear what this let us
[44:37] really means here. What the prophet said
[44:40] in the message five definite
[44:42] identifications of the true church of
[44:44] the living God.
[44:46] Now, some of you want to know about my
[44:51] Genesis story. I like that.
[44:54] God said, "Let us make man." Pay
[44:58] attention to that.
[45:01] Now listen. The first thing he created
[45:04] was angels
[45:06] &gt;&gt; to worship him. Then he became God.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the first thing that he created
[45:15] was what? angels.
[45:17] Then he became God because they could
[45:19] not worship him. I believe this event
[45:22] happened before Genesis 1:1.
[45:32] A super sign preached 1959.
[45:37] Hear closely what the prophet said.
[45:40] Watch God in his ways of work. When he
[45:43] created the heavens and the earth, he
[45:47] called the angels together and he said,
[45:51] "Let us."
[45:57] So, you understand who God is speaking
[45:59] to now? Because angels are spirit
[46:03] beings, ministering spirits.
[46:06] And I believe that they were in the same
[46:08] image of God.
[46:11] The same thing that he's telling he's
[46:13] speaking of in Genesis 1:26.
[46:17] Let us make man in our image. Now, this
[46:20] is not to say that God was saying I and
[46:24] the angels are going to create.
[46:29] Basically, all he's saying is that we
[46:30] are I'm going to create, but the the the
[46:33] man that I'm going to make is going to
[46:35] be in our image. So, he's speaking to
[46:38] angels. This proves that before
[46:42] anything was created, angels were in
[46:44] existence.
[46:46] Hallelujah.
[46:48] That's scripture. According to what the
[46:50] prophet is saying here,
[46:54] let us according to brother Brham, God
[46:57] was talking to angels. Why? Because God
[46:59] and his angels, they bore the same image
[47:02] of spirit beings.
[47:08] Now, this proves that angels were
[47:10] already existence like like I said, they
[47:12] were already in existence before Genesis
[47:14] 1:1. Amen.
[47:18] So, we're going to trail the enemy.
[47:22] You know, just like a hunter when they
[47:23] go hunting,
[47:25] they start to look for the tracks of the
[47:27] animal. Let's say you're looking for a
[47:28] bear. You look carefully. And once you
[47:32] find the tracks, you follow those
[47:34] tracks. So, we're going to see how this
[47:37] enemy here
[47:40] has been working his way through
[47:42] humanity.
[47:43] And we're going to see by the grace of
[47:46] God that Satan is very very cunning. If
[47:50] he can hide himself,
[47:53] he will do anything to disguise himself
[47:55] so long as you fail to see who he is. So
[47:59] in this case, we're going to look at
[48:01] Genesis 1. So day one, God created light
[48:06] and saw the light that it was good.
[48:09] Good.
[48:11] There was no evil present.
[48:14] I'll skip day two. Day three, God
[48:18] created dry grounds and the plants and
[48:21] saw that it was good. So far, no evil is
[48:25] present. Day four, God created the sun,
[48:30] the moon, and the stars and saw that it
[48:33] was good. There's no evil mentioned so
[48:36] far. Are you with me?
[48:38] Day five, God created the birds and the
[48:41] sea and saw that it was good. So far no
[48:45] evil.
[48:47] Day six, God created the land, the
[48:50] animals, sorry, the land, animals, and
[48:53] humans. And behold, it was very, very
[48:57] good.
[48:59] Still nothing about evil is mentioned.
[49:03] Then we come to day seven, which is the
[49:05] Sabbath.
[49:07] God rested
[49:09] and still the Bible does not mention
[49:11] anything about evil being present. Are
[49:14] you following me
[49:17] now? And for the first time after
[49:20] creation was completed,
[49:23] suddenly we see the word evil appearing
[49:26] in Genesis 2:9 and 17.
[49:31] So if I can bring it to our way of
[49:33] thinking, we found the first animal
[49:35] track.
[49:38] Now we're going to follow this. So the
[49:40] first time the word evil is mentioned in
[49:42] Genesis chapter 2 verse 9 and verse 17.
[49:48] God begins to warn Adam of an impending
[49:52] evil.
[49:54] Hallelujah.
[49:56] Something has happened in the Garden of
[49:59] Eden or in Genesis.
[50:04] At this point,
[50:08] the woman
[50:10] was still in Adam.
[50:13] And the scripture I'm referring to is
[50:15] Genesis 21:17. I'll read it very
[50:17] quickly.
[50:18] He says, "But of the tree
[50:22] of knowledge of good and evil,
[50:27] thou shalt not eat of it.
[50:30] For in the day that thou eatest thereof,
[50:33] thou shalt surely die." So the first
[50:36] time now God is mentioning evil. So that
[50:39] means something has happened.
[50:42] Hallelujah.
[50:44] Because as far as we know, everything
[50:46] was good. Everything was good.
[50:49] Everything was good. Day seven,
[50:51] everything was good. And then suddenly
[50:53] when man was created and put in a body
[50:55] flesh, God says, "Adam,
[50:59] be careful.
[51:01] Be careful."
[51:08] So by now, Adam was no longer just a
[51:10] spirit being, but he had actually taken
[51:13] on flesh.
[51:15] And watch carefully. The prophet said
[51:18] that Satan can do nothing until he
[51:20] embodies himself in in inner being.
[51:25] Is that right? He's powerless until he
[51:28] has a vessel to walk through. So you can
[51:31] see how it's playing out slowly, slowly.
[51:34] Because now here's a man. Of course, the
[51:36] woman is not here yet, but we will
[51:39] follow the trail.
[51:45] I'm going to read this quote which I
[51:46] refer to very quickly. Brother Bernham
[51:48] said that the man was made after the
[51:51] image, sorry, this human man here is
[51:54] made after the image of an animal. This
[51:57] here, this human bodies are made in the
[52:01] image of animals, not in the image of
[52:03] God. That's why it's lazy. It lies. It
[52:07] cheats.
[52:09] When it's time to pray, you want to
[52:11] sleep in. It's is it's it's a fallen
[52:15] it's not the image of God. That's all
[52:17] I'm trying to say.
[52:19] We got hands like a monkey and feet like
[52:23] bears.
[52:25] So, this has nothing to do with God.
[52:29] That's why the Bible says that they that
[52:31] worship God must worship him in spirit
[52:33] and in truth.
[52:36] Amen.
[52:38] Praise God.
[52:42] The prophet says, "And you take the Holy
[52:44] Spirit off of a man, he's lower than the
[52:47] animals. He's worse than an animal." You
[52:51] know that?
[52:53] Praise God.
[52:56] So, by God warning Adam of this
[52:58] impending evil, so sin was somewhere on
[53:01] the earth.
[53:03] Otherwise, I don't believe God would
[53:05] waste his time trying to warn him if
[53:07] something had not happened.
[53:13] I believe that the battle in heaven had
[53:17] already taken place and Satan had
[53:20] already been cast down on the earth.
[53:25] Because the Bible does not tell us
[53:27] anywhere specifically when that battle
[53:29] took place. But we know
[53:32] according to what I'm going to read here
[53:34] that sin did not begin on the earth.
[53:39] It started in heaven.
[53:41] The prophet said that in the message
[53:44] that day on Calvary
[53:46] and sin did not start on the earth.
[53:50] Sin started in heaven.
[53:54] Lucifer the devil was condemned was a
[53:57] condemned creature for his disobedience
[54:00] before he ever struck the earth
[54:15] where God put the angels and so forth
[54:17] upon the basis that he put human beings
[54:21] on knowledge. the tree of knowledge, the
[54:23] tree of life, and the tree of knowledge.
[54:25] Sorry, where man could make his choice.
[54:28] The pastor referred to that on Sunday.
[54:30] Basically, angels were placed on a free
[54:32] moral agency. They had a right to choose
[54:35] just like you and I. You have a right to
[54:37] choose. They had that right.
[54:41] Amen.
[54:44] And when Lucifer was given the
[54:46] preeminence to make his choice, he
[54:49] wanted something better than God. And
[54:52] that's what started the trouble.
[54:56] And as we know, the Bible says the soul
[54:58] that sinnth, that soul shall surely die.
[55:02] God declared it. And the prophet said
[55:04] that there will come a time where the
[55:07] the soul of Satan will be completely and
[55:09] totally annihilated
[55:12] because the soul that sinnth, it shall
[55:15] surely die.
[55:18] Praise God. And the prophet says this,
[55:21] "And when sin struck the earth back in
[55:25] the beginning
[55:27] like a sheet of blackness falling from
[55:30] the heavens, it literally paralyzed the
[55:34] earth.
[55:36] It throwed every creature on the earth
[55:39] and all of God's creation into bondage."
[55:43] And that's what we have been fighting
[55:44] till today.
[55:47] So the sin that began in heaven
[55:52] paralyzed every creature on the earth
[55:55] and you know it. We fight sin every
[55:57] single day of our lives.
[56:01] From the moment you walk out of this
[56:03] church tomorrow go on the streets in the
[56:05] mall before your very eyes is sin on
[56:10] display. We can't pretend that it does
[56:13] not exist.
[56:16] So I want to pivot a little bit and
[56:19] bring all this home to where we live
[56:21] because
[56:25] what's the use of preaching a gospel
[56:28] that does not affect our daily lives?
[56:32] I believe that the gospel is not meant
[56:34] to just remain in our heads
[56:36] intellectually.
[56:38] God sends us a message to transform our
[56:43] lives. to make us better people.
[56:49] So I'm going to go into some details
[56:54] which I know you've heard
[56:58] and this is now in Genesis 3 where the
[57:01] fall actually took place.
[57:04] Many of you know from what you've heard
[57:09] that man mankind fell as a result of the
[57:13] woman I'll make it very plain.
[57:17] She had sex with the serpent.
[57:21] Now, the serpent, as we know, wasn't a
[57:23] snake at the time. What we see as
[57:25] snakes, it was an upright being, a man
[57:31] between what the prophet says, a cheap
[57:34] sea, and a man. That missing link is
[57:38] what was turned into a serpent.
[57:41] He was so close. The prophet said that
[57:42] he actually had a place for a soul.
[57:46] And so, Satan knowing and watching God's
[57:48] plan,
[57:50] like I was saying, watching how God was
[57:55] playing out his program. He was watching
[57:58] it very closely. And the best thing that
[58:01] he could use was to come into the
[58:02] serpent. This was a being that had the
[58:05] ability to reason, to think, to talk.
[58:10] And when the prophet was challenged
[58:12] about the serpent's seed and he said
[58:14] when you know he said that uh you know
[58:16] the serpent is what beguiled Eve
[58:21] somebody challenged him and says well if
[58:23] it was there in existence it's got to be
[58:25] here somewhere and under inspiration he
[58:28] spoke without even knowing and said it's
[58:30] here the serpent
[58:33] because he was completely cursed God
[58:35] changed every fiber of his being and
[58:38] turned him into what we called snakes
[58:40] today.
[58:42] But that's not what he was in the
[58:44] beginning. He was highly intellectual,
[58:46] polished.
[58:51] The prophet said in the God of this evil
[58:54] age, now he's explaining what happened
[58:56] in Genesis 3,
[58:58] but he had a sexual affair with the p
[59:03] sorry, but she sorry, but she had a
[59:05] sexual affair with the person of Satan
[59:08] in the form of the beast.
[59:12] Not a reptile
[59:15] but the smartest
[59:18] subtlest of all the field the image of
[59:22] man. I want you to follow that thought
[59:25] closely because man plays a role in
[59:28] this. The only thing that the seed would
[59:32] mix in.
[59:35] Now science is trying to find him and
[59:38] they never will find him because every
[59:42] bone in his body is completely changed.
[59:47] That was the kind of a curse that God
[59:49] placed on this fellow.
[59:52] But the Bible declares it to be so.
[59:56] Amen.
[1:00:04] I'm going to skip some quotes just for
[1:00:06] the sake of time.
[1:00:08] And so when Satan did this wicked act,
[1:00:14] for the first time, Satan officially
[1:00:18] put his footprints
[1:00:22] into the human race.
[1:00:26] That goes for every one of us.
[1:00:31] Whether you're born in a Christian home,
[1:00:35] born in an uncristian or an unbeliever's
[1:00:38] home, you are we are all born in sin. We
[1:00:42] come as liars, as cheats,
[1:00:46] rebellious.
[1:00:48] That is the nature that we are born with
[1:00:50] because Satan somehow was able to input
[1:00:54] his imprint into humanity. And that's
[1:00:57] why I strongly believe that when it
[1:00:59] comes to the Holy Ghost and being born
[1:01:02] again, that is the core of what God is
[1:01:05] dealing with is that nature, not the
[1:01:08] head.
[1:01:10] Hallelujah. You can never be converted
[1:01:13] by just intellectual knowledge. God is
[1:01:17] dealing with our fallen nature because
[1:01:20] that is where Satan put his imprint.
[1:01:23] Hallelujah.
[1:01:27] And so if that was the case in the
[1:01:29] beginning, it has not changed today. So
[1:01:32] the subject of the new birth has
[1:01:35] everything to do with that fallen nature
[1:01:37] of men.
[1:01:39] And that's why we cannot intellectually
[1:01:41] accept this message. It's got to come
[1:01:44] from here into here.
[1:01:47] Jesus said, "Except a man be born again,
[1:01:51] you cannot even see the kingdom of God,
[1:01:53] let alone understand."
[1:01:55] Hallelujah.
[1:01:57] So you find things like lust, people
[1:02:00] steal, they cheat, they hate.
[1:02:05] All these things are embedded in our
[1:02:06] nature. You know, I like to put it this
[1:02:08] way. From the time that that baby is
[1:02:11] born,
[1:02:12] they issue what we call a birth I'll
[1:02:15] call it a birth diploma,
[1:02:18] a birth certificate.
[1:02:20] And we look at that child or they look
[1:02:22] so cute and wonderful. But do you
[1:02:25] realize that in that little baby is
[1:02:27] every potential
[1:02:29] to be good and to be bad?
[1:02:34] a rapist, a murderer, a thief. All those
[1:02:39] attributes
[1:02:41] are in that little baby. I'm not saying
[1:02:43] every child is born like that. But even
[1:02:46] little Judas,
[1:02:48] he was born a cute little baby and yet
[1:02:51] he was the son of Pician.
[1:02:54] Those attributes came in.
[1:02:57] Amen.
[1:03:00] So when we are issued our birth
[1:03:01] certificate as beautiful as it is just
[1:03:04] know that in that little baby
[1:03:07] is evil because Satan did what he had to
[1:03:11] do in the beginning and he achieved his
[1:03:12] purpose.
[1:03:15] You know just like when you go to buy a
[1:03:17] car
[1:03:20] salesman are very good because they want
[1:03:22] to make money. You go, you look, you go
[1:03:25] to, you know, a dealership and you look
[1:03:27] around, you say, "Well, I like this
[1:03:28] vehicle and you start to ask questions
[1:03:31] and they tell you, well, it's fully
[1:03:32] loaded. It has everything." That's
[1:03:35] exactly the way we are. We come fully
[1:03:37] loaded with all this evil in us
[1:03:40] completely. You don't have to teach your
[1:03:43] child how to tell lies. At the age of
[1:03:45] two, three, two, three years old, you
[1:03:48] find them doing things which you wonder
[1:03:50] how in the world did they learn that
[1:03:53] telling lies,
[1:03:55] cheating and stealing and all that. It
[1:03:57] comes with a package. It's fully loaded.
[1:04:02] So you see where God is is is what God
[1:04:04] is dealing with and where the enemy is
[1:04:07] working through. It's not the head, it's
[1:04:10] that nature.
[1:04:13] Amen.
[1:04:18] And if sin came as a result of our
[1:04:20] fallen nature,
[1:04:23] that's why I don't believe for one
[1:04:25] moment
[1:04:28] in the idea that when you just believe
[1:04:31] the message
[1:04:33] that that is the evidence of the Holy
[1:04:35] Ghost.
[1:04:37] I believe that's that's one of the
[1:04:39] biggest lies from the very pits of hell
[1:04:42] because the Bible tells us that even
[1:04:44] Satan himself he believes and he
[1:04:47] trembles
[1:04:49] in James chapter 2 19.
[1:04:52] And to follow this thought look at Paul
[1:04:55] the apostle he asked that question in
[1:04:58] Acts 19:2.
[1:05:04] Apollos who was preaching the gospel
[1:05:06] very eloquent well-versed in the message
[1:05:08] of the hour for his day. He preached it
[1:05:11] precisely no errors in his message.
[1:05:14] But yet Paul came to him and said, "Have
[1:05:17] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:05:19] believed?"
[1:05:21] If that question was relevant then, I
[1:05:24] believe it's still relevant today.
[1:05:28] I know it's not popular. It's not
[1:05:30] popular to ask that question. Have you
[1:05:32] received the Holy Ghost since you became
[1:05:34] a message believer?
[1:05:38] Because that's exactly what Apollos was.
[1:05:43] And the answer is either a yes or a no.
[1:05:47] You cannot be neutral.
[1:05:51] A pregnant woman when she's pregnant
[1:05:54] and she's growing in, you know, going
[1:05:57] through the stages, the months and
[1:05:58] whatnot, at some point either baby
[1:06:01] Johnny comes or he doesn't.
[1:06:05] Is that right?
[1:06:07] It's the same thing with a new birth.
[1:06:08] You either are born of born again by the
[1:06:11] spirit of God or you're not. And if
[1:06:14] you're not born again to God, you don't
[1:06:16] exist.
[1:06:20] Praise God.
[1:06:23] Let's look at Peter real quick.
[1:06:27] You're familiar with this that question
[1:06:28] that was asked. Jesus asked the
[1:06:30] question, "Whom do men say that I, the
[1:06:33] son of man, am?" And I like the way this
[1:06:36] scripture plays out. And they said,
[1:06:39] "Some say
[1:06:41] that thou are John the Baptist." Some
[1:06:45] some say
[1:06:49] some Elias,
[1:06:51] others Jeremiah's
[1:06:55] or one of the prophets, you talk about
[1:06:58] shooting in the dark.
[1:07:01] But I like the way Jesus really narrowed
[1:07:04] it down and said, "But he said unto
[1:07:07] them, but whom say ye
[1:07:10] that I am?" And Simon Peter answered and
[1:07:14] said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of
[1:07:16] the living God."
[1:07:19] And then Jesus, watch his response. He
[1:07:22] says, "Flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:07:24] this to you, but my father which is in
[1:07:29] heaven."
[1:07:30] And not too long after this, the same
[1:07:32] Peter who by the spirit of God
[1:07:36] declared who Jesus was is found cursing
[1:07:41] and denying the very man that he claimed
[1:07:43] to have known.
[1:07:47] So if just knowledge or even having a
[1:07:50] revelation you think is enough to save
[1:07:52] you. Well, here is Peter a good example
[1:07:55] that intellectual conceptions cannot
[1:07:58] hold when the time of testing comes. And
[1:08:01] I speak in the name of the Lord the time
[1:08:03] is coming where every one of us God is
[1:08:06] going to prove our claims.
[1:08:09] Hallelujah.
[1:08:11] Because later on Jesus said,
[1:08:16] Jesus telling Peter, "And when thou art
[1:08:20] converted, strengthen thy brethren."
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; So Jesus knew that in spite of his
[1:08:27] revelation
[1:08:29] of who he was, he still was not
[1:08:31] converted.
[1:08:34] You know, I often say this, you cannot
[1:08:37] give what you don't have
[1:08:40] and you cannot teach what you don't
[1:08:43] know. Is that right? I'll say that
[1:08:46] again. You can't give what you don't
[1:08:48] have and you can't teach what you don't
[1:08:51] know.
[1:08:55] Because after Pentecost, we find Peter
[1:08:57] now after the experience of the Holy
[1:08:59] Ghost.
[1:09:04] He missed a situation where now
[1:09:10] his faith is going to be tested and
[1:09:11] proven. And here was a man in that
[1:09:15] condition, lame,
[1:09:18] needy,
[1:09:20] seeking for help. Just like some of us,
[1:09:26] people will come to you seeking for
[1:09:28] genuine help. Just like the disciples
[1:09:31] whom they you know that father brought
[1:09:33] his son to and they could not do
[1:09:35] anything for him. Later on they asked
[1:09:38] Jesus says why couldn't we cast him out.
[1:09:40] He says you you know you have little
[1:09:42] faith
[1:09:44] because they had they didn't have what
[1:09:45] it took.
[1:09:47] But now here's Peter he missed this
[1:09:49] challenge. He says silver and gold have
[1:09:52] I none but such as I have. Now he had
[1:09:56] something to impart.
[1:09:58] Hallelujah. I pray to God that we will
[1:10:01] come to the place where we have
[1:10:03] something to give out virtue,
[1:10:06] strength.
[1:10:08] Maybe somebody needs deliverance being
[1:10:10] being able to lay hands upon them and
[1:10:13] and declare in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:10:15] Satan, leave this person and Satan will
[1:10:17] listen to you.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Those are the kind of people that God is
[1:10:23] raising to God is looking to raise in
[1:10:25] this hour. Amen.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; We don't want empty religion. Those days
[1:10:30] are fading fast.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; And like I said last time, it's not in
[1:10:35] the numbers.
[1:10:37] Amen.
[1:10:41] So the fall of man gave Satan legal
[1:10:44] access to be able to possess a man and
[1:10:47] continue with his original desire to be
[1:10:50] worshiped as God in a man.
[1:10:57] So that's where the battle is today.
[1:11:00] Like I said earlier on, Satan's desire
[1:11:03] to steal worship from God has never
[1:11:06] stopped.
[1:11:08] It has not stopped.
[1:11:11] And so let me say this, saints,
[1:11:15] let's be careful that we don't let a
[1:11:17] cold, lukewarm spirit get on us.
[1:11:21] You realize that? Because God said he
[1:11:25] hates a lukewarm spirit. He prefers that
[1:11:29] we're either hot or cold. Because
[1:11:33] brother Arab says that that lukewarm
[1:11:35] condition, it makes God sick in his
[1:11:38] stomach.
[1:11:42] And when God said he will spew you out
[1:11:44] of his mouth, that means spew you out of
[1:11:47] his presence.
[1:11:51] That is the Leodician spirit that we are
[1:11:53] fighting today. And Satan being cunning,
[1:11:56] he knows that if he can just get the
[1:11:58] people to cool down just to that level
[1:12:03] where they're neither hot or cold.
[1:12:08] He works best in those conditions. You
[1:12:10] know a frog, you know how you've heard
[1:12:12] the story of a frog? They say you take a
[1:12:15] frog,
[1:12:17] put it in cold water,
[1:12:20] and then you turn up the heat slowly.
[1:12:23] If you take a frog and throw it in hot
[1:12:25] boiling water, it will jump out.
[1:12:29] But take it
[1:12:31] in in cold water and turn the heat up
[1:12:33] slowly, slowly, slowly, and before that
[1:12:37] frog realizes what's going on, it's
[1:12:39] cooked, baked, dead.
[1:12:44] That's exactly what the enemy is doing
[1:12:46] to this bunch of Leodians. Putting them
[1:12:49] putting them in a lukewarm condition.
[1:12:51] And God says, "You are miserable, poor,
[1:12:55] blind, wretched, and you don't even know
[1:12:57] it." Yet very religious.
[1:13:02] Praise God.
[1:13:05] Listen to this quote as I start to wind
[1:13:07] down. Brother Brham says, "Now remember
[1:13:09] this that Christ in the church in the
[1:13:11] true church is a continuation of the
[1:13:14] book of Acts. But the book of Revelation
[1:13:18] shows how that the antichrist spirit
[1:13:22] would come into the church and defile
[1:13:24] it, making it lukewarm, formal, and
[1:13:27] powerless.
[1:13:30] It exposes Satan, revealing his works,
[1:13:33] the attempted destruction of God's
[1:13:35] people, and the discrediting of God's
[1:13:38] word right down to the time he's cast
[1:13:42] into the lake of fire.
[1:13:44] The prophet says he fights that. He
[1:13:47] cannot stand it. He knows that if the
[1:13:51] people get the true revelation of the
[1:13:54] true church and what she is, praise God,
[1:13:58] and what she stands for and that she can
[1:14:01] do the greater works, she will be an
[1:14:04] invisible army. Hallelujah.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; So you see what the enemy is doing to
[1:14:09] us, putting spiritual amnesia over us
[1:14:13] and we cool down and we become content
[1:14:15] with our condition. No more desire to
[1:14:18] see God moving. The time that we should
[1:14:22] be spending with God and spending time
[1:14:25] in the presence of God, we become so
[1:14:27] programmed. We become robotic in our
[1:14:29] ways.
[1:14:31] Hallelujah.
[1:14:33] You know, even just to get believers to
[1:14:35] say amen in a church, you almost have to
[1:14:37] beg people.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Something is wrong with your experience.
[1:14:45] Some people when they come to church,
[1:14:47] the only time their mouth will move is
[1:14:49] when the song leader says, "Let's sing a
[1:14:52] song." Then they sing the song.
[1:14:55] Once we sit down, the mouth shuts shuts
[1:14:58] tight until they leave the building. You
[1:15:01] can't get nothing from them.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; And we call ourselves Christians. We are
[1:15:05] going to heaven. Which heaven are you
[1:15:07] going to?
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:15] And some of the worst are preachers
[1:15:18] themselves.
[1:15:21] You know, preachers like it when they're
[1:15:23] here and the people are saying, "Amen."
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; You feel good. You feel inspired.
[1:15:28] But you watch some of the same
[1:15:29] preachers. Just go and look in
[1:15:31] conventions. That's some of the best
[1:15:33] places to see this happening. on the
[1:15:35] pulp pit. They'll sit there with their
[1:15:37] legs crossed
[1:15:40] like a frozen statue.
[1:15:44] No participation.
[1:15:47] Do you realize that
[1:15:50] Levites were actually supposed to be
[1:15:51] part of worship? I want to read it for
[1:15:54] you.
[1:15:56] You are not supposed to be a spectator
[1:15:59] but a participant.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; You lead by example.
[1:16:04] Praise God.
[1:16:15] I missed the scripture I wanted to read.
[1:16:18] Let me just find it real quick cuz I'm
[1:16:21] almost winding down. Nehemiah chapter
[1:16:24] six, I believe.
[1:16:34] You know these things are not just uh
[1:16:38] stories we tell. This is God wanting his
[1:16:41] people to be in a certain condition.
[1:16:44] Listen to this. This is Nehemiah chapter
[1:16:46] 8 verse 5. And Ezra opened a book in the
[1:16:49] sight of all the people for he was above
[1:16:52] all the people. He was standing on a
[1:16:53] pulpit.
[1:16:55] And when he opened it all the people
[1:16:57] stood up. This is where we get this, you
[1:17:00] know, when we stand for the reading of
[1:17:01] the word is here.
[1:17:03] See, all the people stood up in respect
[1:17:06] for the word. And Ezra blessed the Lord
[1:17:10] and the great God and all the people
[1:17:12] answered, "Amen." Amen. With lifting up
[1:17:17] of their hands.
[1:17:21] So where we where did we get the idea
[1:17:23] that coming to church is just showing up
[1:17:25] physically
[1:17:27] and going back the same
[1:17:30] the congregation is supposed to
[1:17:32] participate
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; just as much as the musicians are doing
[1:17:36] their part. We don't come here to be
[1:17:38] entertained. We come to worship the King
[1:17:40] of Kings
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; and the Lord of Lords.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. We shouldn't wait until the the
[1:17:46] preachers coming out then we stand up
[1:17:48] like robots.
[1:17:50] Let's we've come to worship the King of
[1:17:52] Kings and the Lord of Lords.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we let traditions come into
[1:17:56] the church and we don't even realize
[1:17:59] that we're just a bunch of
[1:18:00] traditionalists.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Why should we wait until the preacher
[1:18:05] comes then we stand up? If King Jesus is
[1:18:07] here, the one we came to worship,
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; there should be such a joy in your heart
[1:18:12] that you just stand and give him praise.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You give him worship because
[1:18:17] he is the one, the reason why we come
[1:18:19] here.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Not because a man has walked on the
[1:18:23] pulpit then we stand up.
[1:18:25] Nothing wrong with that. That's
[1:18:27] respectful I believe. But you see,
[1:18:29] sometimes we can get carried away with
[1:18:31] traditions and we grieve God by the
[1:18:34] things we do, not realizing that we are
[1:18:36] just doing a bunch of traditions.
[1:18:42] Hallelujah.
[1:18:54] So
[1:18:57] I want to read this scripture here
[1:18:58] before we close.
[1:19:00] This was now Moses instructing the
[1:19:03] people on how they were to worship after
[1:19:06] crossing Jordan into the promised land.
[1:19:09] Hear what he said. Deuteronomy 12:12.
[1:19:13] And ye shall rejoice before the Lord
[1:19:15] your God. Ye and your sons and your
[1:19:20] daughters and your men's servants and
[1:19:23] your maid servants and the Levites. That
[1:19:28] is the priesthood.
[1:19:32] So it wasn't just a congregation doing
[1:19:34] the worshiping and the priesthood sat
[1:19:36] there like some like I said statues.
[1:19:41] They were required to worship just like
[1:19:43] everybody else.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; The congregation says, "Amen." The
[1:19:48] preacher also says, "Amen."
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; There's no big ones and small ones.
[1:19:55] There's only one big one. That's Jesus.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; For he said, "If I be lifted up, then I
[1:20:01] will draw all men unto me."
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:09] the Levites that is within your gates
[1:20:11] for as much as I'll I'll leave that for
[1:20:14] now. You see,
[1:20:17] so like Queen Vashi,
[1:20:21] she could be replaced any time.
[1:20:25] Yeah, she was a queen, but she was
[1:20:27] replaced.
[1:20:29] And brother Brham says that Jesus can
[1:20:32] put us away anytime he wants to.
[1:20:36] So don't think that because I'm a
[1:20:38] message believer, I'm in. No,
[1:20:44] he can replace us any moment he wants to
[1:20:47] because he has the right to do so. So we
[1:20:50] are called.
[1:20:56] So So you are bride because he has
[1:20:59] called you just like Esther. she was
[1:21:02] called.
[1:21:04] And your conduct as a bride is what
[1:21:06] qualifies you to be his bride. Did you
[1:21:09] hear what I said? Your conduct
[1:21:13] as a bride is what qualifies you to be
[1:21:16] his bride.
[1:21:20] God does not beg for worship.
[1:21:24] He does not beg for worship.
[1:21:26] He does not need
[1:21:29] to feel great because you didn't
[1:21:31] worship. I mean, he he doesn't need my
[1:21:34] worship. He doesn't need your worship.
[1:21:36] He's able of these stones to raise up
[1:21:38] children unto Abraham. The Bible says
[1:21:41] that. So, it's a privilege to worship
[1:21:44] God. It's a privilege to come into the
[1:21:46] house of God. And God expects us to come
[1:21:49] into the house of God prepared.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Come in half an hour. Get yourself
[1:21:55] ready. Some people walk in five minutes
[1:21:58] before the preacher comes, I mean, the
[1:21:59] song leader comes to sing.
[1:22:05] I mean, how do you expect God to do
[1:22:07] something for you? You don't pray. You
[1:22:10] don't read. There's no dedication. You
[1:22:13] come dry. You live dry. And you affect
[1:22:15] the service.
[1:22:17] And then you wonder why you're not
[1:22:19] moving on with God. Let's get back to
[1:22:21] the ABCs. Come early, half an hour early
[1:22:24] and sit down, meditate, get your spirit
[1:22:27] cooled down so that when the song leader
[1:22:30] comes.
[1:22:32] We are already in an atmosphere. The
[1:22:34] preacher comes, he finds the church in a
[1:22:36] certain atmosphere. He won't have be
[1:22:38] fighting through spirits.
[1:22:41] Praise God. We have a part to play.
[1:22:44] So in winding down
[1:22:52] I want to read this last scripture
[1:22:55] where Jesus was going into Jerusalem. We
[1:22:58] call it the Palm Sunday.
[1:23:01] And I want to watch those message
[1:23:04] preachers of his day,
[1:23:07] the Pharisees.
[1:23:09] So here was Jesus coming in. Of course
[1:23:11] you know the story. The people were
[1:23:13] rejoicing, happy and glad.
[1:23:16] And the Bible says this, "And some of
[1:23:18] the Pharisees from among the multitudes
[1:23:21] said unto him, Master, rebuke thy
[1:23:24] disciples."
[1:23:27] Those same Pharisees are still in the
[1:23:29] message today.
[1:23:33] They like dead churches, dead worship.
[1:23:38] That's the way they like it. Don't you
[1:23:40] realize that? That is an anointing of
[1:23:42] Satan.
[1:23:44] He wants to strip God from worship. We
[1:23:49] were made to rejoice, to be happy, to
[1:23:51] give God praise.
[1:23:53] Amen. He says, "Master, rebuke thy
[1:23:56] disciples. Tell your church to stop
[1:23:58] making noise. They're too loud."
[1:24:03] Listen to what Jesus said. And he
[1:24:05] answered and said unto them, I tell you
[1:24:08] that if these should hold their peace,
[1:24:11] the stones would immediately cry out.
[1:24:14] You see, God's attitude is so different
[1:24:16] from ours.
[1:24:18] So, in closing,
[1:24:24] I want to ask this question and this is
[1:24:26] a a a scripture. Proverbs chapter 22:28.
[1:24:34] It says, "Remove not the ancient
[1:24:36] landmarks which thy fathers have set."
[1:24:42] Remove not the ancient landmark which
[1:24:46] thy fathers have set.
[1:24:50] The Bible says we are built upon the
[1:24:52] foundation of the the doctrine of the
[1:24:55] apostles and the prophets.
[1:25:00] You look around today things like altar
[1:25:03] calls Those are historical things.
[1:25:06] They're gone.
[1:25:08] Prayer lines where people used to come
[1:25:10] and cry out before God in repentance.
[1:25:12] You don't see those things no more.
[1:25:15] Those ancient landmarks
[1:25:19] are gone.
[1:25:23] We are in too much of a rush
[1:25:26] for our programs. We don't have time for
[1:25:28] God to spend time in the house of God.
[1:25:31] If you knew you are dying tomorrow,
[1:25:35] I can guarantee that you will do
[1:25:36] anything, spend as much time as you can
[1:25:40] today to make sure that you're ready to
[1:25:42] meet your God. But we wait until an
[1:25:45] emergency strikes us. And then we cry to
[1:25:48] God, says, "Oh God, help me." You want
[1:25:50] God to help you when you can't even give
[1:25:53] God time.
[1:25:55] The zeal of the bride is to repent. It's
[1:25:58] not just for sinners because every
[1:26:00] single day we make mistakes.
[1:26:03] And so we are responsible to maintain
[1:26:07] that relationship with God by keeping
[1:26:09] ourselves humble before God.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; The altar calls are gone.
[1:26:18] That's why our young people don't
[1:26:20] they're not interested in church anymore
[1:26:24] because they have seen everything else
[1:26:26] but God.
[1:26:30] I'm not angry. I'm just saying what God
[1:26:32] placed on my heart because I believe
[1:26:34] that these are the things that are
[1:26:36] killing the church.
[1:26:38] We might explain them by way the prophet
[1:26:40] said this and all these things but the
[1:26:42] reality is let's look at ourselves. We
[1:26:45] can't deny truth.
[1:26:47] You either see it as black or it's white
[1:26:51] and you've got to say it for what it is.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Our young people in this message are
[1:26:57] dying out.
[1:26:59] The world is pulling them more than the
[1:27:01] church is.
[1:27:03] They grow up in this message. After a
[1:27:05] while, it's almost predictable where
[1:27:06] they will go. I've heard ministers say
[1:27:08] that. You can almost predict when they
[1:27:12] will leave the church and go into the
[1:27:13] world. Shame on us.
[1:27:16] God called us to be
[1:27:19] a lighthouse.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; I believe this the gospel is still the
[1:27:23] strongest attraction there is in the
[1:27:26] world.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; And if they saw Christ in us,
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; there should be something to attract
[1:27:33] them here.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; But we've cooled down. We've let the
[1:27:40] enemy come in and we just do things
[1:27:43] traditionally
[1:27:45] and we go along and think it's okay.
[1:27:48] It's not okay. Praise God.
[1:27:52] Brother Brham says, "Often I've said
[1:27:54] this, the greatest enemy I got
[1:27:59] is William Brham.
[1:28:02] The greatest enemy I got is Emmanuel
[1:28:06] Tombbe. It's not sister Rosemary.
[1:28:10] It's not Sister Amanda.
[1:28:12] It's not brother Daniel or whoever you
[1:28:15] are. It's none of those. The greatest
[1:28:18] enemy you have is yourself.
[1:28:21] And the moment you realize that you need
[1:28:23] to die to yourself, get that stinking
[1:28:26] pride out of you. Amen.
[1:28:33] Thinking that you know it all. Maybe
[1:28:35] because you've been in a message 30, 40
[1:28:37] years.
[1:28:41] That happened in the Bible. There there
[1:28:42] were those who walked with Moses, came
[1:28:44] out of Egypt, and they saw God for 40
[1:28:47] years. And the Bible says with them many
[1:28:50] with many of them, God was not pleased,
[1:28:52] and they perish in the wilderness. Even
[1:28:54] though they had been in the message 40
[1:28:56] years. So your numbers to God mean
[1:28:59] nothing.
[1:29:00] Where are you today?
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:29:05] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:29:08] and forever.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Let's not brag about how long we've been
[1:29:11] in the message. It's how much is that
[1:29:14] God in you?
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; How much is that God in me? God can take
[1:29:18] somebody who came in a message yesterday
[1:29:20] and set him on fire and he will leave
[1:29:23] you a million miles while you're still
[1:29:26] boasting about your number of years.
[1:29:29] We should boast about how much God lives
[1:29:32] in us. Amen. Praise God. So, we need to
[1:29:36] die out to our intellectual conceptions
[1:29:40] and let the message go from our head
[1:29:42] into our hearts.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "What we need more is
[1:29:46] heartfelt religion." Something that
[1:29:49] comes from the heart.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:29:54] Let's get back to the ancient landmarks.
[1:29:58] I know they are not popular anymore, but
[1:30:00] you know what? That's the thing that
[1:30:02] will bring life into the church.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; The new birth is messy, but it's the
[1:30:08] only thing that God ordained to bring
[1:30:10] life into the church.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:15] Lukewarmness.
[1:30:17] God will not accept it.
[1:30:20] Amen.
[1:30:22] Things of the world are coming in. Our
[1:30:23] long young men are coming in with long
[1:30:26] hair and you know these things are
[1:30:28] creeping into the church and it's slowly
[1:30:29] being accepted. The Bible says it's a
[1:30:32] shame for a man to have long hair.
[1:30:36] Oh yes,
[1:30:38] it's a shame for a man to have long
[1:30:40] hair. It might not be popular to be
[1:30:42] said, but it's the scripture regardless.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Let's look like gentlemen.
[1:30:48] Praise God.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:53] The trail of the serpent in connection
[1:30:55] to the fall of man. I hope you can see
[1:30:58] how Satan
[1:31:00] is working today. And always remember
[1:31:03] this that Satan works through religion.
[1:31:06] Praise God. Let's stand to our feet.
[1:31:14] Musicians, you can come.
[1:31:18] Amen.
[1:31:34] can just play the song. He is Lord
[1:31:37] quietly.
[1:31:41] Amen.
[1:31:43] Let's sing the song. He is Lord. He is
[1:31:46] Lord. He has risen from the dead.
[1:31:49] And as we sing, let's just consecrate
[1:31:52] ourselves to God
[1:31:54] cuz this might be your last chance.
[1:31:59] Those online, maybe tonight could be
[1:32:01] your last night. You don't know.
[1:32:05] Then what? If you're not ready with to
[1:32:06] meet God, you're in that lukewarm
[1:32:08] condition.
[1:32:10] What then?
[1:32:12] Praise God.
[1:32:14] As we sing, I just want us to really
[1:32:17] mean what we are saying.
[1:32:20] We close our eyes. Let's raise our hands
[1:32:23] in consecration to God and really sing
[1:32:26] this song that he is Lord and consecrate
[1:32:29] your life to God. Make a decision that
[1:32:33] you are going to go all the way with
[1:32:36] God.
[1:32:38] Don't allow this cold spirit to get on
[1:32:41] you. Amen.
[1:32:46] Call the truth.
[1:32:50] Oh that Jesus
[1:32:55] Christ
[1:32:57] is
[1:32:58] Lord. He is Lord. Let's raise our hands
[1:33:00] and sing to him.
[1:33:02] Oh he is Lord.
[1:33:07] Thank you Lord.
[1:33:10] Oh, he is Lord
[1:33:16] for He has risen.
[1:33:21] Oh, from the dead and he is Lord. Every
[1:33:27] knee shall bow
[1:33:30] for every knee
[1:33:34] shall
[1:33:36] bow down.
[1:33:38] Every tongue
[1:33:41] confess
[1:33:45] oh that Jesus
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:33:50] Christ
[1:33:52] is
[1:33:53] Lord
[1:33:57] this prayer.
[1:33:59] Thank you Lord Jesus.
[1:34:02] Oh God,
[1:34:05] we thank you father for tonight. Lord,
[1:34:11] blessed be your holy name, precious
[1:34:13] Jesus.
[1:34:17] Lord, as we are here in your presence
[1:34:18] tonight, Lord,
[1:34:21] I pray, Lord, that your great Holy
[1:34:24] Spirit, Lord, will go from seat to seat,
[1:34:26] Lord, from heart to heart. Lord,
[1:34:30] forgive us, Father. We've
[1:34:33] treated you, Lord God,
[1:34:39] in such a way, Father, that
[1:34:44] we make you feel ashamed of our ways,
[1:34:46] Lord.
[1:34:47] [Music]
[1:34:49] Lord, I pray, oh God, that somehow today
[1:34:52] you'd extend mercy and grace upon us,
[1:34:54] Lord.
[1:34:56] Set our hearts on fire, for God.
[1:34:59] Lord, bring back that first love in our
[1:35:03] hearts. Lord,
[1:35:06] right from the pulpit to the pew.
[1:35:10] Lord, cleanse us, Lord.
[1:35:13] Ignite us, Lord God, with your spirit.
[1:35:16] Father,
[1:35:17] that we will see the God like Elijah
[1:35:22] when he came to that river Jordan.
[1:35:26] He said, "Where is the God of Elijah?"
[1:35:30] He wasn't interested in some historical
[1:35:32] God, but he wanted to see God for
[1:35:35] himself.
[1:35:37] And today, Father, we want to see God,
[1:35:39] the same God of Brother Brham. We talk
[1:35:42] about what God did in 1965, in 1960,
[1:35:45] 1959. Lord, that's good. But what good
[1:35:49] does he do us, Lord God, to talk about a
[1:35:52] historical God, if he's not the same
[1:35:55] with us today, Lord, I pray that you
[1:35:58] would extend mercy upon us, Lord. God,
[1:36:01] forgive me if there's anything wrong
[1:36:03] I've said that's out of line, oh God.
[1:36:06] This is what you placed on my heart,
[1:36:08] Lord. And I pray that somehow, Lord,
[1:36:11] even if it's one soul,
[1:36:14] Lord, that will be touched and
[1:36:16] transformed, Lord, it will be worth it
[1:36:18] all. That's all we desire, Father, is to
[1:36:22] have truth, is to love you, is to serve
[1:36:24] you. So bless your people, oh God, as we
[1:36:27] leave this place.
[1:36:29] We thank you, Lord, and we love you.
[1:36:32] Thank you, Jesus. We ask your blessings
[1:36:35] upon us, oh God, as we would go. bring
[1:36:38] us back Lord at the appointed time to
[1:36:41] worship in your house Lord in Jesus
[1:36:44] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God
[1:36:48] bless you.
[1:36:51] Jesus Christ
[1:36:54] is Lord.
[1:36:59] For he is Lord
[1:37:06] and he is Lord.
[1:37:13] He has risen
[1:37:16] from the dead
[1:37:19] and he is Lord.
[1:37:26] every nation
[1:37:32] and every tongue
[1:37:35] come
