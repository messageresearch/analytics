[20:34] and we are speaking
[20:36] on this last
[20:39] lesson of the seven church ages it's
[20:43] been quite a run
[20:45] and quite a time but it's been a
[20:48] blessing all the way through
[20:50] by the way let me make you assured
[20:52] that even tonight i was called to let me
[20:55] know there are saints over there that
[20:57] are watching this
[20:59] right
[21:00] they're watching this and they have been
[21:02] listening this
[21:04] and more of them now are going to be
[21:07] watching this so just so that you might
[21:09] know praise the lord and be thankful of
[21:12] god for that hallelujah now in the book
[21:16] of joel chapter 2
[21:18] reading from verse 23
[21:23] be glad then
[21:25] you children of zion
[21:28] and
[21:28] rejoice in the lord your god
[21:32] for he had given you
[21:34] the former rain
[21:36] moderately
[21:38] and he will cause to come down for you
[21:41] the rain
[21:43] the former and the latter rain
[21:47] in the first month praise god
[21:50] and the floors shall be full of wheat
[21:54] thank god
[21:55] and the fats shall overflow with wine
[21:58] and oil praise his name
[22:01] and i will restore to you the years that
[22:05] the locusts had eaten the canker worm
[22:08] the caterpillar the primal worm my great
[22:12] army which i sent among you
[22:15] and you shall eat plenty thank god
[22:19] and be satisfied
[22:21] and praise the name of the lord your god
[22:25] that hath dealt wondrously with you and
[22:29] my people shall never be ashamed
[22:33] thank god let us look to god father we
[22:37] thank you for this wonderful marvelous
[22:39] night
[22:41] of coming and being here with your
[22:44] people
[22:45] and lord as we look into the word of god
[22:49] and we have been announcing to the
[22:51] people over and over the church ages are
[22:55] over
[22:56] and now lord
[22:58] as we come to the ending of
[23:02] this
[23:03] teaching on the seven church ages this
[23:06] commentary
[23:08] by the spirit of god we pray that you
[23:11] will bless this last lesson
[23:14] and may burn its way into our hearts
[23:18] into our lives into our souls father
[23:22] that we may have the rapturing faith to
[23:25] step into the eighth day
[23:28] and to walk the way you want us to walk
[23:30] lord we committed to your hands in jesus
[23:34] name amen and amen
[23:37] please be seated
[23:42] now uh we ended last time by
[23:46] bringing your attention
[23:49] that the world council of churches
[23:53] is the image of the beast
[23:56] amen
[23:58] as the
[24:00] bride represents the image if you want
[24:03] to call it or
[24:04] of
[24:05] jesus christ
[24:07] and i'm saying that and then i'm
[24:09] reminded it's right behind me
[24:13] she is the stature of the perfect man
[24:17] who is jesus christ
[24:19] himself
[24:21] but what the world consular church's
[24:24] ecumenical council or the whole host of
[24:27] denominations represent
[24:30] is the image that satan or the picture
[24:33] or photograph of the beast
[24:36] amen
[24:38] you want to describe it another way or
[24:40] the shadow
[24:41] of this oncoming monster
[24:45] a spiritual uh cannibal that's on the
[24:48] way
[24:49] to the to to torment and destroy
[24:52] the the human race
[24:55] and you'll find the scriptures for that
[24:58] revelation 13
[25:00] 11 to 18.
[25:03] you read that when you have time we
[25:05] won't read that now
[25:08] but i want you to know
[25:10] that this is a picture of satan's bride
[25:14] you know we love to take pictures
[25:16] whenever we have a wedding
[25:19] but
[25:20] god has been uniting or has united
[25:24] with his bride
[25:27] but the devil
[25:28] is doing the same thing
[25:30] but he is doing it on the dark side
[25:33] uniting with his bride also
[25:38] amen and that bride is the organized
[25:42] system
[25:44] or the organized group
[25:47] right that he is uniting with but god
[25:50] has united and is uniting
[25:53] with a group that is free
[25:57] they're not only any bondage they're
[25:59] under no denomination
[26:01] they seem to be loose
[26:03] uh i don't mean
[26:05] in the negative sense but loosely
[26:09] gathered around the world
[26:11] wherever they are they're scattered
[26:14] everywhere and the only thing that binds
[26:18] them together
[26:20] is the revelation of the word of god
[26:24] hallelujah that's all
[26:26] right they're seeing the same word of
[26:28] god and that pulls them together glory
[26:32] to god hallelujah oh my
[26:35] and
[26:36] outside of that even when israel was
[26:39] brought out of egypt god didn't just
[26:42] loose them and let the pillar of fire
[26:44] alone guide them but they are guided by
[26:48] the pillar of fire the revealed word and
[26:51] the fivefold ministry that's on the
[26:54] ground
[26:56] the pillar of fire was supernatural
[26:58] leadership as you know that was leading
[27:01] god's people uh cloud by day fire by
[27:05] night but on the ground was visible
[27:08] leadership
[27:10] granted by god himself in the form of
[27:13] moses who later his spirit was put on
[27:17] seven men
[27:18] praise god jesus goes up to glory
[27:21] and sends back his spirit on the church
[27:25] and amongst them paul said god set in
[27:28] the church amen a five-fold ministry
[27:33] anointed by the same holy spirit placing
[27:37] them in the same position to lead the
[27:40] people of god here
[27:42] upon the earth praise god now
[27:45] we know
[27:47] my friends
[27:48] that this satan's brine
[27:51] was born in the planting and in the
[27:55] seeds of era
[27:57] but god's bride was born in the planting
[28:00] of the seed of truth
[28:03] who is none other than the lord jesus
[28:06] christ
[28:07] listen
[28:08] imperial rome
[28:10] that fell by the sword
[28:14] but she was healed from death
[28:17] from her death stroke
[28:19] when she joined to the nominal christian
[28:22] church of rome
[28:24] and incorporated
[28:28] paganism into christianity amen she
[28:33] incur incorporated paganism incorrupt
[28:37] into christianity so that when she
[28:41] comes into christianity she will be
[28:43] accepted or be acceptable these old
[28:48] babylonian pagan priests of astarte
[28:52] and
[28:53] venus and jupiter and all these various
[28:57] gods that they had god for reign god for
[29:00] harvest god for traveling god for this
[29:03] it still is here today under the name of
[29:05] saints what is the same thing that they
[29:09] have right now
[29:10] praise god hallelujah now we know that
[29:15] they
[29:16] became the holy roman empire
[29:20] it was no more the marshall empire of
[29:23] rome not one more the political empire
[29:26] of rome but now the religious empire of
[29:30] rome not under the leadership of a
[29:33] general
[29:35] or as such but under the leadership of a
[29:38] pope
[29:39] a religious leader that's leading them
[29:43] at this time hallelujah and we find that
[29:47] rome is slowly creeping her way back to
[29:51] total control and power
[29:54] and she is not doing it alone just as it
[29:57] was in the bible after jezebel took over
[30:00] israel then she married her daughter to
[30:02] another king from another country nearby
[30:04] and another one here so that she is
[30:06] slowly by marriage she's bringing all
[30:09] these countries that she control the
[30:11] whole place and they're doing the same
[30:14] thing by this denomination join with
[30:16] that one agree with the other one and
[30:18] that's one and they look like they're
[30:20] far apart but my friends that
[30:23] trinitarian lie that doctrine putting
[30:27] away the name of jesus christ hallelujah
[30:30] is draw wanna draw them all together
[30:34] and they're going to want to kill
[30:35] destroy and maim god's people because of
[30:40] their trinitarian doctrine
[30:42] why because when their trinitarian
[30:46] doctrine is absolutely totally proven
[30:49] false then their teaching their
[30:52] their their gates are nothing but a
[30:54] bottomless pit they don't have
[30:57] foundations whatsoever because the word
[31:00] of god does not support that amen but it
[31:03] does support one god
[31:06] the name of jesus christ baptism in the
[31:09] name of jesus christ hallelujah it only
[31:12] supports the fullness of the word of god
[31:17] so by her spiritually
[31:20] by her daughters
[31:22] that are right with her
[31:24] she will take over
[31:28] absolute authority
[31:30] through their world council of churches
[31:34] prophet is prophesying there it's
[31:36] happening we know we're in the midst of
[31:38] it it's happening it hasn't come to its
[31:41] full fruition but it now my friends this
[31:46] is what we're looking at
[31:48] oh praise god but i want you to know
[31:50] don't fear little sister there's a man
[31:54] here that can't turn on and he's turning
[31:57] on the light oh praise god and we thank
[32:00] god for the light that's being turned on
[32:03] hallelujah now right now the churches
[32:07] are already controlling politics
[32:11] and at the up opportune time
[32:15] at the right time
[32:16] when they can sense they can make their
[32:19] move
[32:20] they're gonna manifest exactly how great
[32:24] their control is over these kingdoms of
[32:28] the world
[32:29] right now they're not showing it they're
[32:31] loaning money here quietly in the
[32:33] background loaning money they're taking
[32:35] control here and the public doesn't know
[32:38] a thing about it
[32:40] a lot of these nations are already in
[32:43] debt right up to their necks and under
[32:46] the control of rome
[32:48] but she is not exercising or calling any
[32:51] of the debts as yet
[32:53] at the opportune time then that she's
[32:56] going to strike and when i just strike
[32:59] my friends they're going to have to give
[33:01] up hallelujah amen you see
[33:05] some of them are cooperating with rome
[33:09] many of them
[33:10] are enjoying
[33:12] their
[33:13] joining with rome
[33:15] because they have not yet envisioned
[33:19] that what happened during the years of
[33:22] inquisition
[33:24] could repeat again
[33:26] in this modern time they don't think
[33:29] it's possible anymore but thank god we
[33:32] have prophecy in the word of god thank
[33:34] god we have prophecy from the genuine
[33:37] god set prophet that has brought us the
[33:40] word of god and we recognize what is
[33:43] happening here oh glory to god amen yes
[33:47] sir yo my friends there it is revelation
[33:50] 17 3-6 write that down and study it
[33:55] again hallelujah oh my the bible states
[34:01] that mystery babylon
[34:04] is seated on the beast
[34:08] she is seated on this power that's below
[34:12] her
[34:13] what is this power it's the organized
[34:16] churches
[34:18] it's her daughter they look like there
[34:20] is no connection between them and rome
[34:23] because they're going to say oh i'm not
[34:24] roman catholic i'm baptist i'm not this
[34:26] i'm but they all are trinitarian
[34:30] amen it's the same doctrine that the
[34:32] mother put out
[34:34] that they're all
[34:36] having and holding to
[34:38] and when the time is right when their
[34:41] supper time is right they're all going
[34:44] to go right back to mother right back to
[34:48] mothers she's going to welcome them back
[34:51] and the prophet says here
[34:53] now notice she is controlling
[34:57] this last or fourth
[35:00] empire referring to daniel's vision the
[35:03] beast the the the
[35:05] that uh empire broken down from persia
[35:08] greece and so on right down to the toes
[35:11] uh like that that's what he referred to
[35:14] no amen
[35:18] church system under her
[35:23] rome will be controlling
[35:27] this image
[35:28] or orchard system
[35:30] see
[35:32] and they will be obedient to rome
[35:36] because rome
[35:38] controls all of the gold
[35:42] hallelujah in other words all of them
[35:44] need money to operate and the bigger the
[35:47] buildings is more money they need to
[35:48] operate and the more people they have is
[35:51] more money to cooperate yes the they're
[35:54] taking in a lot of money
[35:56] but they don't see they're falling into
[35:58] a trap
[35:59] they're falling into a trap and if you
[36:01] let me say this whole digital system we
[36:05] see that is now being spawned by satan
[36:09] is nothing but a web of lies and sin and
[36:12] traps to catch these evil bugs and flies
[36:17] that satan has
[36:19] scattered within this the whole world
[36:22] they're everywhere amen
[36:25] and they will be obedient to her
[36:28] thus all the people will have to belong
[36:32] to that church system
[36:34] or they will be put out and be at the
[36:37] mercy of the elements that means you
[36:40] know i don't have to expand or not out
[36:42] to your house out in church buildings
[36:44] out or whatever you're out of everything
[36:46] you'll be put out amen if you got a
[36:48] mortgage it's gone amen do you know that
[36:51] even when you pay off your mortgage and
[36:53] your so-called own your land do you know
[36:56] that the government can still come and
[36:58] put you off that land
[37:00] they can do it they got laws of
[37:03] expropriations laws of emergency they
[37:05] got several layers of laws that can put
[37:09] you off your own land brother bill all
[37:13] see and it's so evil but it's sitting
[37:15] there lying like a cat waiting ready to
[37:19] pounce because when the hour is ripe and
[37:22] they're ready to do it they'll act upon
[37:24] their their motivations listen
[37:27] now
[37:28] notice i want you to see this
[37:33] there will the people will be at the
[37:35] mercy of the elements
[37:37] for they will not be able they cannot
[37:39] buy
[37:41] nor sell
[37:42] without the mark of the beast in their
[37:46] hand or on their head
[37:48] amen they won't be able to do business
[37:52] no business
[37:56] they won't be able to buy
[37:58] nor sell
[37:59] no trading
[38:01] whatsoever whether buying selling you
[38:04] can't do it
[38:05] because of the mark of the beast
[38:08] you don't have any membership to her you
[38:10] don't have no connection to her uh
[38:12] whatever listen oh my
[38:15] yes my friends
[38:18] the mark in the head
[38:21] means
[38:23] that those that take that doctrine
[38:26] of the world church system
[38:29] which
[38:30] the main doctrine is trinitarianism
[38:34] amen that is the mark that will be put
[38:37] in the head
[38:39] hallelujah and some already got the mark
[38:42] because the mark is in the head
[38:45] all these things is because they have no
[38:48] revelation people are imagining some
[38:50] mysterious marks they're designing all
[38:53] kinds of 666 their design they say
[38:55] design that design yeah the prophet said
[38:58] it's already here and the mark is the
[39:01] trinitarianism
[39:04] that is the mark that they're back with
[39:06] in their head
[39:08] their mind
[39:10] their thinking
[39:12] is all controlled by trinitarianism
[39:16] you understand once you start from that
[39:19] point of view don't you see
[39:21] from there your thinking is going to be
[39:23] a certain way you're going to think
[39:25] certain ways the principles are
[39:28] different from the word of god and it's
[39:30] going to go off in many many ways
[39:32] contrary to this word and unconsciously
[39:35] without being told that you will be
[39:38] anti-christ
[39:40] with that mark in your head you're the
[39:42] antichrist
[39:44] make a just go to somebody that is in
[39:46] the trinitarian church try to tell him
[39:48] about one god and right away they're
[39:50] gonna say no that's a lie that's not
[39:52] true and they're gonna want to fight
[39:53] with you unless if that's an elected
[39:56] seed hiding under our god place them on
[39:59] the at jezebel's table for a season
[40:01] until he calls them out other than that
[40:04] my friends they already have the
[40:06] antichrist spirit on them
[40:09] in a strong form
[40:13] or in a mild form
[40:15] right it might be so mild they don't
[40:17] even know they got it
[40:20] you're branded and you don't know you
[40:21] got branded my goodness gracious have
[40:24] mercy
[40:26] continue listen
[40:27] now that is the mark
[40:30] in the head
[40:31] see
[40:33] that will be
[40:35] the doctrine you must take the doctrine
[40:39] of the world church system
[40:42] and that is
[40:44] trinitarianism
[40:45] hallelujah do you have that now
[40:48] straight the mark in the head is none of
[40:51] these mysterious things people are
[40:54] suggesting and drawing and and
[40:57] everything else it's simple the prophet
[41:00] points it out and the devil can't
[41:03] confuse us with all of his various
[41:06] things that he's throwing out there
[41:08] because the prophet clearly said the
[41:11] mark in the head or the mind or the
[41:14] thinking is trinitarianism
[41:18] now
[41:20] the mark
[41:22] in the hand
[41:24] see
[41:25] will mean
[41:27] you must do the will of that world
[41:30] church
[41:32] whatever works whatever you they want
[41:35] you to do you will have to do it
[41:37] that is the symbol he says here of the
[41:40] mark
[41:41] in the hand
[41:43] now
[41:44] with this great power
[41:46] amen hallelujah to control the mind by
[41:50] trinitarianism
[41:52] to control the works actions and
[41:55] everything else of that person
[41:58] hallelujah
[42:00] this
[42:01] this will be used
[42:03] this great power
[42:05] the church systems will then want to
[42:09] persecute the bride
[42:12] i ask you a simple question why
[42:15] why because she is in total or we say
[42:18] diametrically opposed to the
[42:21] trinitarianism with the faith in one god
[42:25] and his name is jesus christ there is no
[42:29] bending there is no bowing there is no
[42:31] burning there is no backing away she is
[42:34] not ashamed of him she is ready to bear
[42:36] the reproach for the word she stands on
[42:39] the word of god hallelujah and there is
[42:42] nothing about it she doesn't have any
[42:44] arguments or whatever she just stands
[42:47] there with the word of god there is one
[42:49] god
[42:50] his name is jesus christ there is none
[42:53] before him beside him behind them below
[42:56] him oh praise god there's only one and
[42:59] his name is jesus christ hallelujah amen
[43:03] and so they will persecute the bride
[43:07] hallelujah listen let me put it this way
[43:13] do you know
[43:15] if uh somebody brings a counterfeit
[43:19] coin or can defeat bill to you
[43:22] and you don't have an original
[43:25] to make a comparison whether with a
[43:27] magnifying glass or feeling with your
[43:29] hands or whatever do you know you'll
[43:31] never know the difference
[43:33] if i brought a counterfeit to you first
[43:36] so you don't know the real yet you're
[43:39] going to accept that counterfeit
[43:41] because you don't know the real
[43:43] so
[43:44] the person
[43:45] that is presenting that counterfeit
[43:48] if they know you have the original or
[43:51] true
[43:53] bill
[43:54] don't want you to bring that original
[43:57] new that original thing the real thing
[44:00] close to the other one so a comparison
[44:02] can be made
[44:04] you see that's why the pharisees and
[44:06] statues kill jesus
[44:08] because he didn't even have to hardly
[44:10] say anything because just the way he
[44:12] lived how he taught how he walked the
[44:14] comparison when he came to serve there
[44:17] came to rule when he came to do this
[44:20] they did something opposite he was
[44:23] showing them up
[44:25] he was revealing their true colors
[44:28] and so they couldn't stand that they had
[44:30] to get rid of him so the people could
[44:33] see them alone
[44:35] and so they will want to get rid of the
[44:38] true bride
[44:40] because of our
[44:42] revelation
[44:43] faith
[44:44] and pronouncements
[44:46] of the word of god that she's given
[44:48] forth and they don't want the people to
[44:51] know so they have no other choice if you
[44:53] want to put it that way before their
[44:56] time of darkness can fully come in but
[44:59] to persecute the bride hallelujah this
[45:03] image will persecute her
[45:06] by trying to keep her the bride from
[45:10] preaching
[45:12] from teaching
[45:14] amen
[45:15] they will
[45:17] you see have our ministers
[45:20] there will be forbidden
[45:22] to give any comfort
[45:25] and truth
[45:27] to the people who will need it
[45:30] hallelujah oh my
[45:33] oh praise god he says but
[45:36] before the antichrist now his spirit is
[45:39] here but before the antichrist comes in
[45:43] person and he has it in church book in
[45:46] person in other words in flesh walking
[45:49] amongst the people amen and takes over
[45:52] this complete world system of churches
[45:55] the true church will be taken away from
[45:58] this world to be with our lord god will
[46:02] catch his bride away and take her to the
[46:06] great marriage supper of the lamb can
[46:08] you praise god for that come he said
[46:10] thank you lord hallelujah amen yes sir
[46:14] oh praise god
[46:17] prophet said now let us trace the two
[46:19] churches
[46:20] as we have been doing and them two
[46:23] spirits from pentecost right now
[46:27] to the consummation of these ages
[46:30] hallelujah oh my
[46:33] now
[46:34] we know that the age started after the
[46:36] turn of the 20th century he's talking
[46:38] about the odyssey and church age now
[46:41] started at the turn of the 20th century
[46:44] it was to be an age in which the true
[46:47] church would return to being the bride
[46:50] that she was at pentecost hallelujah
[46:55] then if the bride is to be restored to
[46:57] your original condition
[46:59] oh hallelujah he didn't say it this way
[47:03] not only must she have a restoration of
[47:05] the word
[47:07] but he does say this she must also have
[47:10] a return to dynamic power
[47:13] is that right
[47:15] so
[47:16] because you know paul said he said i
[47:18] preach what paul preached
[47:20] and paul said we don't just preach word
[47:23] only but we preach the word with
[47:25] demonstrations of the spirit under the
[47:28] power of god hallelujah amen it may not
[47:31] be like hope pentecost has it but we
[47:34] certainly preach the word with the
[47:36] demonstration of the spirit of god and
[47:38] the power and the presence of the living
[47:41] god hallelujah and listen brother sister
[47:44] this is increasing
[47:46] right now the bride god has had her
[47:49] covered up or veiled so that she could
[47:53] grow into maturity
[47:55] right
[47:56] without being hindered by the systems
[48:00] right now we still allowed to preach we
[48:01] still allowed to teach some of us still
[48:04] have some ordination and registration
[48:07] and stuff like that and god is allowing
[48:09] it but the time will come we will not be
[48:12] able to do it
[48:14] we won't be able to marry we'll be able
[48:16] to do anything of that we won't be able
[48:17] to preach from a pulpit we we may have
[48:20] to hide to do it but the prophet is
[48:22] telling you this is coming but before
[48:25] that really happens it may start
[48:28] happening in a minor way but before it
[48:30] goes to the full persecution he says
[48:33] this bride is going right out of here
[48:36] thanks be to god
[48:39] now
[48:41] at pentecost the believers sense
[48:44] in their spirit this return of dynamic
[48:48] power
[48:49] and began crying to god for a new
[48:52] outpouring of the holy spirit hallelujah
[48:57] now what seemed to be the answer to
[49:00] their prayer came
[49:02] and caused many to begin to speak with
[49:06] towns
[49:08] hallelujah
[49:09] and to manifest gifts of the spirit it
[49:13] was then believed that that was the
[49:15] long-awaited
[49:17] restoration
[49:19] oh my
[49:20] it was not let me repeat that
[49:24] modern pentecost was not the restoration
[49:30] of the church going to be the bride
[49:34] similar to what was
[49:36] at pentecost
[49:38] in the apostolic times
[49:40] as powerful as it was as wonderful as it
[49:44] was it was not the return
[49:48] for how could it be
[49:51] for the latter rain
[49:53] can only come after the former rain
[49:57] the former rain
[49:59] is the spring rain
[50:02] or the teaching rain
[50:05] you know what the spring rain does
[50:07] the spring rain
[50:09] you know
[50:10] let me just let you know this it's the
[50:12] prophet's message that was and is the
[50:16] former rain
[50:18] the spring rain
[50:20] that when those rains fall
[50:23] it wakes up the seeds
[50:26] that were hidden under the ground
[50:28] during the dark times of winter
[50:32] right you typed that in your head on
[50:34] your heart concerning the church ages
[50:36] and all the seeds that were out there
[50:39] the prophet's message came to wake up
[50:42] the seeds
[50:44] hallelujah and bring them back to life
[50:48] see oh my
[50:50] the spring rain
[50:53] or also the teaching rain
[50:57] amen hallelujah
[50:59] now the latter rain
[51:02] is the harvest rain
[51:05] how could this be the real thing for the
[51:08] teaching reign had not come
[51:11] for the teaching reign
[51:12] the prophet messenger was the one sent
[51:16] to teach the people
[51:18] hallelujah and his message had not come
[51:22] and here we find he is calling that the
[51:24] former rain
[51:25] they're looking back and thinking that
[51:28] the pentecost that was back there in the
[51:30] book of acts that is the former rain
[51:33] and now down here they have an
[51:34] outpouring of the holy ghost this they
[51:37] called the latter rain
[51:39] but god doesn't have it that way
[51:41] no sir see god says the prophet's
[51:45] message is the former reign for this age
[51:50] that's the way it is and the latter rain
[51:53] is the harvest rain oh praise god let me
[51:58] give you some scriptures you can write
[52:00] this down joel chapter 2 verse 23
[52:04] isaiah chapter 28 verses
[52:08] 7 to 21
[52:11] acts chapter 3
[52:13] verses 19 to 26 amen you see the prophet
[52:19] messengers had not yet turned the hearts
[52:22] of the children
[52:24] back to the pentecostal fathers that had
[52:28] not yet come
[52:29] oh my
[52:31] thus what
[52:32] was thought to be the restoration
[52:35] or the final quickening
[52:39] onto the rapture
[52:41] hallelujah had not come
[52:44] amen but we know now it has come
[52:48] hallelujah it has come now we're being
[52:50] quickly right now like he said there
[52:52] it's right there quickening for the
[52:54] rapture
[52:56] the final quickening for the rapture
[52:59] now comes
[53:00] praise god there's some things some more
[53:03] you must realize in just a little while
[53:06] yet but listen see
[53:08] the mix now
[53:10] there there
[53:12] that coming
[53:14] of
[53:15] the latter rain as they're speaking of
[53:18] he said
[53:20] in it came a mixture
[53:23] of the unrighteous
[53:25] partaking
[53:27] of the spiritual blessings and
[53:30] manifesting in the holy ghost also
[53:34] and we keep pointing it to you
[53:37] that in there they had devil power
[53:42] as men
[53:43] who were under control of devils
[53:47] and yet they didn't seem to realize it
[53:51] and to prove that it was not real
[53:55] these people
[53:56] after a second generation of the pair i
[53:59] had already organized
[54:02] and began to write scriptural doctrines
[54:06] and build fences
[54:09] our walls
[54:11] uh as every other group ahead of them
[54:14] did now what he's saying here let me let
[54:17] me say this what he is saying here we
[54:20] know that that was devil power
[54:24] or enticing a religious spirit
[54:27] operating and hiding in the religious
[54:30] realm
[54:32] to carry out satan's orders
[54:35] for if that was a true lottery
[54:39] it will draw the people to the world
[54:42] is that right
[54:43] he says but watch he said shortly after
[54:47] didn't take any time
[54:49] they immediately start to form
[54:51] denominations organizations write up all
[54:54] kinds of false doctrine you see the
[54:57] devil's job always to confuse the issue
[55:01] around the truth to make it harder for
[55:04] the people to see the truth because now
[55:07] when you had one truth now he throws he
[55:10] he has a dozen and billions of which one
[55:12] is really right he's
[55:14] and they're left wandering and they're
[55:16] left wondering what really is right
[55:20] see
[55:21] so
[55:23] we see
[55:25] that was the judas spirit
[55:27] return
[55:29] hallelujah did you get that
[55:31] simple as that oh my remember
[55:35] when jesus had come to earth and was
[55:39] upon the earth so was judas
[55:42] so when that anointing comes down
[55:46] for the former rain
[55:48] then
[55:49] down comes the spirit of judas also
[55:52] which is also a religious spirit
[55:55] just as much as cain and if you trace
[55:57] them all down they're all religious
[55:59] spirits
[56:00] but they come to fight against the
[56:03] spirit of jesus christ amen oh my but
[56:08] you see they both come down but each
[56:10] come from a different spirit
[56:13] one comes from the spirit of god and the
[56:14] other one comes from the spirit of satan
[56:17] on the earth hallelujah and the bible
[56:19] tells us after they both died
[56:22] you got to recognize that they both died
[56:24] same day
[56:28] people don't
[56:29] understand the obscure small little
[56:32] scriptures they just pass over they
[56:33] don't realize that the same day that
[56:35] jesus hung on the cross and died
[56:38] the bible says satan
[56:40] judas
[56:41] went and hung himself
[56:44] with remorse
[56:46] right
[56:47] remorse like jew like like esau sought
[56:49] repentance with tears but he couldn't
[56:51] get it
[56:52] right why because he had already uh
[56:56] grieved the holy spirit and there it was
[56:59] that the prophet said and they each went
[57:03] to their respective or predestinated
[57:06] places
[57:08] is that right
[57:09] oh my another place he said look at the
[57:11] two thieves on the cross the one said
[57:14] lord remember me jesus said today you
[57:17] will be with me in paradise
[57:19] hallelujah where is the destination
[57:21] paradise the presence of god he's going
[57:23] right hallelujah in the presence of god
[57:27] but he turns around and says the other
[57:29] one said you call yourself listen call
[57:31] him name he said well you know come off
[57:32] the cross and the
[57:34] other thief had to turn to him and say
[57:37] man
[57:38] don't you don't you understand here
[57:40] what's going on he said lord remember me
[57:44] amen he said and the other one went to
[57:48] his inheritance
[57:50] amen he went to his destination
[57:53] listen what the prophet says here he
[57:55] says they both died and each went to
[57:58] their own place
[58:01] hallelujah
[58:02] where are we going at if you were in the
[58:05] mind of god
[58:07] you're predestinated to go in the
[58:09] rapture and you have a place waiting you
[58:11] in heaven
[58:13] but that's what he's talking about
[58:15] hallelujah
[58:17] when it comes to heaven you'll find
[58:19] scripture where god talks and such and
[58:22] such but there was no place found for
[58:24] him
[58:25] in heaven but there's a place for him in
[58:28] hell
[58:29] amen all right praise god hallelujah
[58:33] now
[58:34] so then what happened jesus died
[58:37] went back to the heaven
[58:40] say uh judas died went to hell
[58:43] listen to the prophets with the wisdom
[58:45] of the of the spirit through the prophet
[58:48] god takes his man
[58:52] but the spirit remains he doesn't take
[58:54] the spirit
[58:56] so jesus died but the spirit that was in
[58:59] him is still there
[59:01] ready to fall on any or all who would
[59:04] have the same seeds of
[59:07] within their hearts
[59:08] hallelujah oh my so then when jesus the
[59:12] spirit of christ or the holy ghost fell
[59:16] on the day of pentecost
[59:18] then we find that the spirit of judas
[59:21] came down also
[59:23] and fell on the false church
[59:26] he said but there was no false church
[59:28] formed yet
[59:29] no it wasn't formed in a a system as yet
[59:34] but it fell on people like uh ananias
[59:38] and the fire
[59:40] it fell on you can go through the book
[59:42] of acts and you find it already
[59:44] operating on liars is operating on
[59:46] different people
[59:48] oh my it was surely the spirit of jesus
[59:52] and judas
[59:53] back to the old conflict the same uh
[59:58] greatest battle ever fought
[1:00:00] as you know started in heaven dropped to
[1:00:02] earth ran all these ages right through
[1:00:06] it's god versus satan and right now that
[1:00:09] battle continues now with the contest is
[1:00:12] still on hallelujah amen yes sir oh my
[1:00:18] you see
[1:00:20] the book of revelation tells us already
[1:00:23] that's what was going to happen
[1:00:25] and the prophet refers to see now
[1:00:28] don't you know don't you understand that
[1:00:31] judah's spirit
[1:00:33] came back as the white horse rider
[1:00:37] the rider on the white horse
[1:00:40] see
[1:00:41] why it was white it was religious
[1:00:45] oh my and that white also means that it
[1:00:49] was close to the real
[1:00:52] right
[1:00:52] close to the real just as judah stuck so
[1:00:56] close to jesus so that everybody else
[1:00:59] will think oh he's a christian oh he's
[1:01:02] one of jesus disciples oh he's a real
[1:01:04] follower and then when jesus is not
[1:01:07] around then when he go and preach or
[1:01:09] teach those people something totally
[1:01:11] opposite they will accept it with their
[1:01:13] full heart because they believe he's
[1:01:15] teaching what jesus was teaching
[1:01:17] and so he stuck close to jesus like that
[1:01:20] amen prophet said now that spirit
[1:01:24] that same spirit
[1:01:27] is now with the leader of the nicolaitan
[1:01:30] system
[1:01:33] and
[1:01:34] it it became the triple crown pope
[1:01:38] who sat off god
[1:01:40] in his temple calling himself the viker
[1:01:44] of christ
[1:01:45] which means instead of christ or in
[1:01:48] place of christ
[1:01:50] or on behalf of god
[1:01:53] imagine that a pope calling himself the
[1:01:56] holy ghost in other words amen or
[1:02:00] actually that was the posing of the holy
[1:02:03] ghost
[1:02:05] see
[1:02:06] and acting for him
[1:02:08] see that was nothing but the jew the
[1:02:12] spirit in him doing that again
[1:02:16] see how he conquered
[1:02:18] see how he was going forth to conquer
[1:02:22] under lies and deceit
[1:02:25] that is how he's going forth to conquer
[1:02:28] christ did not do that the only ones
[1:02:30] that came to him were predestinated by
[1:02:32] him right he didn't have to deceive
[1:02:34] people to follow him but jesus as a
[1:02:37] servant went forth taking the word of
[1:02:41] the living god hallelujah amen oh praise
[1:02:44] god what about the true seed then
[1:02:47] while satan is doing that it will happen
[1:02:50] as god has said the people of god are
[1:02:54] now being made ready for the word of
[1:02:57] truth amen for the messenger to this age
[1:03:02] in her will be the fullness of pentecost
[1:03:06] for the spirit will bring the people
[1:03:09] right back to the word where they were
[1:03:12] at the beginning
[1:03:15] hallelujah praise god joel 2 you read it
[1:03:19] in there rejoice
[1:03:21] be glad your children of zion and
[1:03:23] rejoice in the lord your god for he had
[1:03:25] given you the former reign moderately
[1:03:28] and it will cost to come down upon you
[1:03:31] both former and latter rain in the first
[1:03:33] month do you know we are enjoying that
[1:03:35] right now
[1:03:37] is all right
[1:03:38] we are enjoying the prophet's message
[1:03:41] or the teaching reign
[1:03:43] we're still enjoying it even though he
[1:03:45] has gone
[1:03:47] but didn't he say
[1:03:48] after the
[1:03:50] former rain
[1:03:51] he said
[1:03:52] has to come the latter rain
[1:03:56] oh my think about it
[1:03:59] now
[1:04:00] remember
[1:04:02] the lutheran age did not restore the
[1:04:04] western age did not restore pentecostal
[1:04:06] age did not restore but god has to
[1:04:09] restore and not deny his word so this
[1:04:12] church that's coming up is not a
[1:04:15] resurrection of that church back there
[1:04:18] no it's not a resurrection but it's a
[1:04:21] restoration
[1:04:22] hallelujah of the same and i use these
[1:04:26] terms principles values uh revelations
[1:04:29] of the word will be the same hallelujah
[1:04:32] praise god hallelujah so that's the way
[1:04:34] it will be
[1:04:35] god will take the church right back
[1:04:38] amen it tells why we need restoration
[1:04:43] and we need it
[1:04:45] and he says it here because the locust
[1:04:47] the conquer worm the pillar caterpillar
[1:04:51] and the former worm have eaten
[1:04:53] everything out but the root and small
[1:04:56] bits of the stem
[1:04:59] so we have had these and i have my own
[1:05:02] note beside here saying the
[1:05:05] bugs eating at the church's foundation
[1:05:08] that is what satan has done
[1:05:12] you see the first wood ant and you don't
[1:05:15] pay no attention to it brother
[1:05:18] brother bill or
[1:05:19] you don't pay any attention you guys
[1:05:21] just one would end but then they're
[1:05:23] multiplying where they're multiplying
[1:05:24] you think they multiply under the open
[1:05:26] they go in the wood and then
[1:05:29] they start to multiply and eating out
[1:05:32] all the faith eating out all the broadly
[1:05:35] kindness eating out the godliness and
[1:05:37] then when you go now to lean on it crash
[1:05:40] the whole thing it's nothing but a crash
[1:05:43] because they've been eating away at all
[1:05:46] these things you see what i'm saying the
[1:05:50] all of these insects
[1:05:53] and he calls them insects
[1:05:55] are one and the same only that it's in
[1:05:59] different stages
[1:06:02] different stages of growth through the
[1:06:04] ages i'm not being poetic i'm just
[1:06:08] reading what he says the stages through
[1:06:10] the ages right oh my
[1:06:13] see
[1:06:14] they are the same antichrist spirit but
[1:06:18] now manifested in organization
[1:06:22] denomination manifested in false
[1:06:25] doctrine through the ages and that poor
[1:06:29] little root and stock god said no matter
[1:06:33] what they do
[1:06:34] that will be restored hallelujah amen
[1:06:39] god is going to plant a new church amen
[1:06:42] but it's going to bring the original
[1:06:44] planting back to its original
[1:06:46] seed amen
[1:06:48] back to its original seed
[1:06:51] and i was discussing with a preacher
[1:06:54] there
[1:06:55] and just saying to him
[1:06:56] and he was saying to me too that he's
[1:06:59] seen that that uh
[1:07:01] they're thinking uh you get justified
[1:07:04] sanctified you receive the baptism holy
[1:07:06] ghost hallelujah we're going in the
[1:07:08] bride no we're going in the rapture no
[1:07:10] no no we go read the restoration of the
[1:07:13] bright tree he said no
[1:07:15] justification only makes way for
[1:07:18] sanctification
[1:07:19] sanctification only makes way for the
[1:07:22] baptism the holy spirit
[1:07:24] but the baptism of the holy ghost has to
[1:07:26] make way for the holy ghost himself
[1:07:31] amen what's he talking about what is the
[1:07:34] prophet talking about that the church
[1:07:36] must go back to its original planting
[1:07:39] what seed was planted jesus said i am
[1:07:42] the corner freak when i go into the
[1:07:44] ground i'm the one that will come back
[1:07:46] up as a bride as a fight as a ministry
[1:07:49] of of people under the power of the holy
[1:07:52] spirit oh praise god hallelujah oh my
[1:07:56] so it will go back to the original grain
[1:08:00] or the it goes back to the statue of
[1:08:02] perfect man it goes back to the image of
[1:08:05] jesus christ it goes back to the
[1:08:07] original seed like it was hallelujah for
[1:08:10] the spoken word restores the whole thing
[1:08:13] back to the original seed as it was and
[1:08:16] the original seed is who christ amen oh
[1:08:20] my because he is the corner wheat that
[1:08:22] was planted in the ground oh praise god
[1:08:25] forevermore now notice he says
[1:08:29] that happens by the teaching
[1:08:32] of the former reign
[1:08:34] hallelujah that restoration happens by
[1:08:38] the teaching of that former rain and
[1:08:40] that it was what it has done for us
[1:08:43] he says but
[1:08:45] the next rain will come upon them that
[1:08:49] is the harvest rain that is the
[1:08:53] rapturing faith
[1:08:55] hallelujah
[1:08:56] reign for the rapture hallelujah you are
[1:08:59] in the midst of it now praise god
[1:09:01] hallelujah because he says you the
[1:09:03] scripture said it they will receive the
[1:09:06] former rain the teaching raid and the
[1:09:09] harvest rain at the same time in the
[1:09:12] same month
[1:09:14] hallelujah and we are still enjoying the
[1:09:17] teaching of the prophet that has brought
[1:09:19] us and restored us back to the word and
[1:09:22] the word itself hallelujah is having us
[1:09:25] ready to go in a rapture amen

[1:09:41] minute
[1:09:42] is that okay
[1:09:44] praise god
[1:09:46] now notice
[1:09:49] in so much as it were possible they
[1:09:51] shall deceive the very elect hallelujah
[1:09:55] now who is it shall attempt to deceive
[1:09:57] the very elect
[1:09:59] in that day jesus was speaking
[1:10:01] that that spirit will receive the very
[1:10:04] elect
[1:10:05] when what time is he talking about who
[1:10:08] what spirit what's he talking about
[1:10:10] prophet says here
[1:10:11] it's nothing but the spirit of the
[1:10:14] antichrist
[1:10:16] that has been coming down through the
[1:10:17] ages just as the spirit of christ was
[1:10:19] coming down through the ages amen
[1:10:22] and that spirit of the antichrist
[1:10:25] coming down
[1:10:27] but in the false anointed ones
[1:10:31] of this last day now
[1:10:36] these false ones
[1:10:38] have already come
[1:10:41] and they're
[1:10:43] lee claiming they come in jesus name
[1:10:46] you're a christian i'm a christian too
[1:10:48] we're all preaching about jesus we're
[1:10:50] all preaching repentance we're all
[1:10:52] talking about born again we're all
[1:10:53] talking about being baptized and all
[1:10:56] that we are good people aren't we well
[1:10:58] we live clean you know uh like that
[1:11:01] we're gonna be in the bride never mind
[1:11:03] they might even be bridesmaid but the
[1:11:05] fact is that uh they are not seeing the
[1:11:09] word listen
[1:11:11] they've already come in jesus name
[1:11:14] claiming that they are being anointed of
[1:11:16] god for the last day just as much you
[1:11:18] claim to be anointed moses you're
[1:11:20] anointed we are also anointed you know
[1:11:23] paul you say you're not we are going to
[1:11:24] do anything you say we we are going to
[1:11:27] do it we are going to count defeated we
[1:11:29] are going to copy it we are going to
[1:11:30] have it too but now they are nothing but
[1:11:34] the false messiahs
[1:11:37] amen claiming that they are prophets
[1:11:40] that they are one with the word
[1:11:42] hallelujah you know uh oh my there's a
[1:11:45] lot in there but i can't touch them
[1:11:47] they're claiming that they have a
[1:11:48] uniting with the with the bridegroom
[1:11:51] that they united with the bright groom
[1:11:53] uniting time with the word but the
[1:11:55] prophet is saying here
[1:11:57] then
[1:11:58] if they are that
[1:12:00] they never had that
[1:12:03] and now they're adding to the word
[1:12:06] and they're taking from the from it
[1:12:10] no one denies that the spirit of god is
[1:12:12] upon them
[1:12:14] manifesting
[1:12:16] gifts
[1:12:16] upon them
[1:12:18] but they act just like balaam
[1:12:22] it's nothing but their they have their
[1:12:24] programs and their appeals for money
[1:12:27] how many knows that
[1:12:29] and it's growing more and more you think
[1:12:31] it's going to grow less because they
[1:12:33] don't have nothing every all the truth
[1:12:36] and the light
[1:12:38] from the
[1:12:39] eclipse spiritual that's taking place is
[1:12:42] going to seep out of them it's slowly
[1:12:46] going away from them
[1:12:48] right when he that let it will let he
[1:12:51] that hinders will stop hindering
[1:12:54] gets out of the way
[1:12:56] amen then shall the son that
[1:12:59] lawless one be revealed man of sin and
[1:13:02] uh when he said the holy spirit when he
[1:13:04] gets out of the way what do you think it
[1:13:06] means when the rapture takes place and
[1:13:08] he's gone with you in you and in me
[1:13:10] praise god then it'll give that those
[1:13:14] devils their opportunity now to ravage
[1:13:17] the people amen and destroy the
[1:13:21] population that is there upon them
[1:13:24] hallelujah they exercise gifts but deny
[1:13:27] the word
[1:13:30] they bypass the world for fear that they
[1:13:33] might cause a controversy that will
[1:13:36] diminish their chances for greater money
[1:13:40] and greater gain
[1:13:42] because their ministry going to get
[1:13:43] smaller because people are going to stop
[1:13:45] supporting and everything else and pull
[1:13:48] back from it oh my think of it yet they
[1:13:52] preach the salvation
[1:13:55] they are also preaching deliverance
[1:13:57] through the power of god
[1:13:59] but they don't realize he said just
[1:14:02] they're doing it just like judas was
[1:14:05] doing it
[1:14:06] having a ministry that was truly
[1:14:09] imparted by christ
[1:14:12] have i not chosen you
[1:14:15] but want to use the devil
[1:14:17] so judas could claim god sent me i was
[1:14:19] chosen by jesus himself true
[1:14:22] but one is the devil
[1:14:25] think about it oh my
[1:14:27] yes sir oh my think here they are
[1:14:32] yet they preached salvation and the
[1:14:34] power of god
[1:14:36] and this judas ministry which was
[1:14:38] imparted by christ
[1:14:40] but you see
[1:14:43] because they are the wrong seed to begin
[1:14:46] with it don't matter what they do
[1:14:49] is that simple
[1:14:52] it doesn't matter what they do
[1:14:54] they have the wrong seed in them they're
[1:14:56] not in the elected bunch so it doesn't
[1:14:59] matter how glorious works and mighty
[1:15:02] things they do big
[1:15:03] tents and big followings and 20 000
[1:15:08] people in the church and oh my god they
[1:15:10] make a star but you got the wrong seed
[1:15:14] you're not going in any rapture you're
[1:15:16] not in the bride you're not in that
[1:15:19] group that god ordained or elected from
[1:15:22] before the foundation of the world see
[1:15:25] and because they have wrong seed they
[1:15:29] have to manifest the wrong spirit
[1:15:32] motivated by a wrong spirit motivating
[1:15:36] them and religious oh my they are
[1:15:39] religious
[1:15:41] think of it
[1:15:43] they even will outshine the elect in
[1:15:46] their efforts
[1:15:49] oh
[1:15:50] oh lord have mercy
[1:15:54] and zeal
[1:15:56] but all of it is leodisian spirit
[1:16:00] and not of christ
[1:16:02] for it always looks
[1:16:04] for big crowds
[1:16:07] big programs
[1:16:09] and wanting to see startling signs
[1:16:12] amongst them
[1:16:14] hallelujah oh my friends when i read
[1:16:18] that right away you know what i thought
[1:16:19] about i remember thought about baal's
[1:16:22] prophets
[1:16:24] they they were shouting from the first
[1:16:27] church age
[1:16:29] and asking for vindication
[1:16:32] of what they're doing to prove to this
[1:16:34] false prophet elijah
[1:16:37] coming at the last
[1:16:39] they're going to prove to him that they
[1:16:42] are the real man and the bible said as
[1:16:46] the hours go down and the evenings start
[1:16:49] to go down towards three o'clock they
[1:16:51] start to get more desperate
[1:16:53] and as they got desperate the bible said
[1:16:55] they start jumping and dancing in the
[1:16:58] air and making all kinds of shrieks and
[1:17:01] noises and the bible said they got so
[1:17:04] far to start to cut themselves to show
[1:17:06] sincere they are and everything else and
[1:17:10] when they're doing that
[1:17:12] at the time of the evening sacrifice
[1:17:14] which
[1:17:15] you know that means three o'clock in the
[1:17:17] afternoon
[1:17:19] when the lamb was being offered in the
[1:17:22] temple
[1:17:23] then the bible says eli just stepped
[1:17:25] forth amen and the rest you know the
[1:17:28] history of it amen praise god hallelujah
[1:17:33] now
[1:17:34] see
[1:17:36] they preach the second of coming of
[1:17:38] christ
[1:17:41] but deny the advent of the prophet
[1:17:43] messenger
[1:17:45] hear how simple that sounds
[1:17:48] that even you might not catch it
[1:17:50] but look how simple it is
[1:17:53] the advent of the prophet messenger
[1:17:58] but what he's talking about is the
[1:17:59] seventh seal that was going to come
[1:18:03] and that was the coming of christ
[1:18:06] and revelation 1
[1:18:09] the mighty angel
[1:18:11] was going to go in to revelation 10 7
[1:18:15] which is the prophet of malachi 4 5.
[1:18:18] it'll be the same william branham that
[1:18:20] was operating on the first and second
[1:18:22] poll but when it come down to the third
[1:18:24] poll on creation who do you think that
[1:18:26] was
[1:18:28] well he preached the message
[1:18:30] who do you think this is
[1:18:33] why do you think he started suddenly
[1:18:34] preaching
[1:18:35] greater than solomon is here
[1:18:38] why do you think that he preached
[1:18:41] i have a greater witness than john
[1:18:44] oh my just go back search the message
[1:18:48] and you'll see these things in it don't
[1:18:50] stop reading the message
[1:18:52] don't get the uh called on the message
[1:18:55] study read the message and you'll see
[1:18:58] the revelation breaking forth like a
[1:19:00] bright and shining morning oh praise god
[1:19:03] hallelujah amen
[1:19:06] yes sir oh my think of it
[1:19:09] they deny the advent of the prophet
[1:19:12] messenger
[1:19:14] in other words they're denying
[1:19:16] the return of jesus christ
[1:19:19] when he come the first time brother
[1:19:21] branham said how did he manifest himself
[1:19:24] as a prophet
[1:19:27] he said how does he come when he comes
[1:19:29] again as a prophet
[1:19:31] right so what i'm saying to you yes
[1:19:34] i'm your brother i'm a brother i'm your
[1:19:36] brother i'm your brother yes we know
[1:19:38] you're you're moses you're you're you're
[1:19:40] mary son your mary son but they didn't
[1:19:42] realize who that really was
[1:19:45] so
[1:19:46] now he has come back because brother
[1:19:48] branham was not virgin born flesh
[1:19:51] jesus was virgin born flesh
[1:19:55] so right away he just came and start
[1:19:57] doing what he has to do but brother
[1:19:59] branham went through a first second poll
[1:20:01] and then the third put mighty angel
[1:20:03] comes down
[1:20:04] and he works and manifests himself true
[1:20:09] brother william branham the
[1:20:10] predestinated
[1:20:12] vessel for his manifestation in this
[1:20:15] hour
[1:20:16] that was the man that was predestinated
[1:20:18] in this hour just as mary was ma uh
[1:20:21] predestinating in that power to bring
[1:20:23] forth the birth of the world uh in flesh
[1:20:27] he was
[1:20:28] predestinated bring forth the word amen
[1:20:32] the word for this hour praise god and
[1:20:35] that word has grown and matured lord god
[1:20:39] hallelujah and so the spirit of christ
[1:20:42] second coming
[1:20:44] by the great manifestations on the
[1:20:47] mountain
[1:20:48] and uh
[1:20:49] a quote which i use yes uh briefly uh
[1:20:52] while away how that he says that cloud
[1:20:55] in the skies just like the wise men back
[1:20:58] there when they saw the stars up in the
[1:21:00] sky their new messiah had to be on the
[1:21:02] earth now
[1:21:04] a man he said that crowd is up in the
[1:21:06] heavens what do you think it was a sign
[1:21:09] praise god everybody ought to know that

[1:21:52] we'll be finished very soon praise the
[1:21:54] lord hallelujah
[1:21:56] i don't want to run over any of this
[1:21:58] stuff now we got all kind of nuggets and
[1:22:00] gems and treasures and everything in the
[1:22:03] storehouse
[1:22:05] hallelujah and the thing is breaking
[1:22:07] more and more and more and more prophet
[1:22:11] said it too he said these seals he said
[1:22:13] they're like a like a roman candle they
[1:22:16] burst and they go this side they're
[1:22:18] bursting next one goes higher burst and
[1:22:20] gone higher worse than that's the way it
[1:22:23] is praise god every time when you think
[1:22:25] okay now the fireworks are over no it
[1:22:27] starts up again glory to god hallelujah
[1:22:31] now
[1:22:34] this false spirit
[1:22:36] in this last day
[1:22:39] is now so close to the reel
[1:22:43] the only way it's so deceiving
[1:22:46] that the only way
[1:22:48] that you can distinguish it is by their
[1:22:53] div its deviation from the word of god
[1:22:58] hallelujah that is you understand now
[1:23:00] why he said give them the word test
[1:23:05] give them the word test because you'll
[1:23:07] know them not by signs and wonders
[1:23:10] even if the guy was able to say oh with
[1:23:13] my back turn the time is on so with my
[1:23:16] back turn this woman that doesn't mean
[1:23:19] nothing to the true bride no more
[1:23:22] it was wonderful and it's good but you
[1:23:24] turn around and give that spirit the
[1:23:26] word test
[1:23:28] and see where that spirit is because
[1:23:31] that spirit has even come in the message
[1:23:33] it's hiding in the falls or the branches
[1:23:36] of the mustard tree jesus spoke about
[1:23:39] hallelujah oh praise god amen it falls
[1:23:44] back on one argument which we have
[1:23:46] already shown to be false well we get
[1:23:49] results don't we we get results so we
[1:23:51] have to be of god oh my
[1:23:54] but i want you to see
[1:23:55] that seed of wheat
[1:23:58] was being buried but thank god see the
[1:24:01] wheat christ the corn of wheat it sent
[1:24:04] up the shoots it came back through the
[1:24:06] tassel the true air and no wonder it's
[1:24:10] back the lutherans some will say the
[1:24:12] lutherans didn't have the holy spirit
[1:24:14] but that was the wheat seed coming back
[1:24:18] they had the holy spirit but in portion
[1:24:21] the next one have it in portion a little
[1:24:23] more next united in portion a little
[1:24:25] more right on up to pentecost now it's
[1:24:28] come back in its fullness upon the bride
[1:24:30] of jesus christ hallelujah
[1:24:33] amen praise god amen we are not talking
[1:24:38] when we speak about these uh
[1:24:40] denominations methodists this that we
[1:24:42] are not saying uh individuals or the
[1:24:45] people that they are evil but we're
[1:24:47] talking about the edge
[1:24:50] hallelujah
[1:24:51] oh my see
[1:24:54] they they have the holy spirit for their
[1:24:56] day but this is the age of full
[1:25:00] restoration
[1:25:02] amen hallelujah the outpouring like they
[1:25:05] had in the beginning oh praise god
[1:25:08] hallelujah amen and so while this is the
[1:25:13] age of
[1:25:14] of restoration
[1:25:16] and they're coming down to close now
[1:25:18] it is also the age of blackout
[1:25:23] the age of
[1:25:24] apostasy hallelujah
[1:25:28] the age this is the
[1:25:30] age of the finished cycle
[1:25:34] amen when it's all over what's he
[1:25:37] talking about
[1:25:38] he's talking about the cycle of the seed
[1:25:41] the seed goes through spring summer
[1:25:45] and come back in the fall and and then
[1:25:47] goes back to spring some but when the
[1:25:49] seed goes back to seed again
[1:25:53] hallelujah and and that repeats year
[1:25:55] after year which is a type of jesus the
[1:25:59] word that was buried and raised up and
[1:26:01] said because i live you going to live
[1:26:03] and you're going to live also because
[1:26:06] this seed gotta be reflected again in
[1:26:09] the last day the son of man has to be
[1:26:12] revealed and his being revealed praise
[1:26:15] peter god hallelujah oh my don't you see
[1:26:20] we conclude
[1:26:22] the seven church ages
[1:26:24] i repeat the seven churches are over
[1:26:28] he said we conclude the seven churches
[1:26:31] he's talking about what he's teaching
[1:26:33] but he's also speaking about the real
[1:26:35] church ages being concluded
[1:26:38] amen saying and i say to you what the
[1:26:41] spirit has said to every age he that had
[1:26:45] an ear to hear
[1:26:47] let him hear what the spirit says to the
[1:26:51] churches hallelujah amen
[1:26:54] i believe the spirit of god has been
[1:26:57] speaking to us
[1:26:59] and teaching us the truth
[1:27:02] of the ages
[1:27:05] he has been faithfully dealing with
[1:27:08] hearts let me turn to him
[1:27:10] that is the reason for all preaching and
[1:27:12] teaching
[1:27:14] for it is in the preaching and teaching
[1:27:16] of the word
[1:27:17] that is how the sheep
[1:27:19] will hear the voice of god and will
[1:27:21] follow
[1:27:22] is that right because the preaching of
[1:27:24] the word is like waving the way of sheep
[1:27:27] hallelujah or it's like waving a toy in
[1:27:30] front of a baby that's just born and
[1:27:32] can't barely see but the movements of
[1:27:34] those things catches their attention
[1:27:36] so he says the preaching and the
[1:27:38] teaching of the word hallelujah
[1:27:41] that is what caused the sheep to hear
[1:27:44] the voice of god and follow
[1:27:47] amen
[1:27:49] now
[1:27:50] he's concluding he said i want you to
[1:27:52] know
[1:27:54] i do not bring a message to the people
[1:27:58] for them to follow me
[1:28:00] how many agrees with that
[1:28:03] you see how it's coming clear now
[1:28:05] not to follow him or nobody else but to
[1:28:08] follow the word
[1:28:11] i uh
[1:28:12] there's another place where he said oh
[1:28:15] when let it come to that time when when
[1:28:19] even
[1:28:20] william branham
[1:28:22] is no more even thought about by the
[1:28:24] people
[1:28:25] don't even think about me he says but
[1:28:29] let jesus christ be glorified
[1:28:32] in other words see jesus only
[1:28:35] it's not disrespect to the prophet he's
[1:28:38] done his job and we recognize that but
[1:28:41] let's keep our eyes on jesus christ
[1:28:44] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:28:48] oh my
[1:28:49] i did not bring a message
[1:28:52] for people to go join or come and join
[1:28:55] my church
[1:28:57] or group
[1:28:59] or to start some fellowship or some
[1:29:01] organization i will never do that i have
[1:29:05] no interest in such things but i do have
[1:29:08] an interest in the things of god and the
[1:29:11] people of god
[1:29:12] and if i can accomplish just one thing i
[1:29:15] will be satisfied and that one thing is
[1:29:17] to see establish a true spiritual
[1:29:20] relationship between god and men whereby
[1:29:25] men become new creations
[1:29:28] in jesus christ
[1:29:31] can you say it
[1:29:33] i'm a new creation
[1:29:36] i'm a brand new man or woman hallelujah
[1:29:40] a man amen
[1:29:43] filled with the spirit
[1:29:45] and let them now live
[1:29:48] according to his word
[1:29:50] i would invite i would plead i will warn
[1:29:54] you hear
[1:29:56] his voice at this time
[1:29:58] and while he is saying hear his voice
[1:30:02] the people didn't know
[1:30:04] that they were listening to his voice
[1:30:07] speaking through a prophet for the
[1:30:09] spirit speaks through the prophet
[1:30:14] i would invite plead warn that you hear
[1:30:16] his voice at this time
[1:30:18] and yield your lives completely to him
[1:30:22] and trust him
[1:30:24] amen
[1:30:25] as i trust him in my heart and i have
[1:30:29] given my all to him
[1:30:31] may god bless all of you and may his
[1:30:36] coming
[1:30:37] rejoice our hearts praise god that's how
[1:30:40] he concludes the seven church ages may
[1:30:43] his coming rejoice our hearts nothing
[1:30:46] else rejoices me more than to think that
[1:30:48] the rapture is at hand and soon we will
[1:30:52] be with the presence of the lord jesus
[1:30:54] christ there was work still to be done
[1:30:57] is that right but let's work till jesus
[1:31:00] comes

[1:31:04] and comes for us and takes us out of
[1:31:07] here praise the lord god bless you all

[1:31:11] closing hymn and a prayer and then we
[1:31:14] can just go out of here praise the lord
