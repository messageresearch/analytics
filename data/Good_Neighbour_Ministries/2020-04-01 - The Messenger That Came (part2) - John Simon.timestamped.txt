[0:20] this Sunday morning they give praise and
[0:24] honor and glory to the name of our God
[0:29] I'd like to read from Scripture today
[0:32] and his disciples asked him saying why
[0:38] then say the scribes that Elias must
[0:42] first come and jesus answered and said
[0:46] unto them Elias truly shall first come
[0:52] and restore all things but I see unto
[0:57] you that Elias is come already and they
[1:02] knew him not but what but have done unto
[1:06] him whatsoever they listed likewise
[1:09] shall also the Son of man supper for
[1:14] them then the disciples understood that
[1:19] he spake unto them of John the Baptist
[1:23] let us pray
[1:25] our gracious Heavenly Father we are so
[1:30] happy to come into your divine presence
[1:34] through the precious blood of Christ and
[1:38] by this great Holy Spirit father we join
[1:43] our hearts and hands and voices where
[1:47] ever we are within our homes within our
[1:52] cars on the road wherever the believers
[1:56] are scattered around the world we pray
[2:00] that the Great Holy Spirit will fall
[2:04] upon them father enter their place
[2:07] wherever they are anoint them with your
[2:11] divine presence prepare every heart to
[2:14] receive the word as we speak the word
[2:18] and at the end of all this father save
[2:21] souls change hearts deliver men women we
[2:26] pray and Lord shine your light upon the
[2:31] word for we ask it in the name of our
[2:34] Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen now in
[2:41] the first part of this sermon called the
[2:47] messenger that came I concluded by
[2:52] saying we should appreciate what the
[2:55] Lord has done for us and sure love and
[2:59] our gratitude to him by the godly lives
[3:04] that we live I showed to you furthermore
[3:09] in the Word of God that the bright
[3:13] shining star that led the wise men to
[3:19] the Lord Jesus Christ as that star moved
[3:24] in the heavens and led the wise men
[3:28] in have in the heavens on the earth as
[3:32] that was a sign of John the Baptist the
[3:37] the star messenger of that age coming on
[3:44] the scene to lead the elected of that
[3:49] day to the perfect light which is Jesus
[3:55] Christ the Word made flesh in that day
[4:01] now that was the gospel light shining in
[4:07] the morning-time
[4:08] of the gospel to the eastern people but
[4:14] how blessed we are in this day in this
[4:18] time that till the Western people God
[4:24] sent a prophet to us with a spirit that
[4:29] was upon John the spirit of Elijah and
[4:34] that great shining light shone among us
[4:40] called
[4:41] the 20th century prophet his name being
[4:46] William Marion brand him I'm an anointed
[4:51] of God and used mightily to spark the
[4:57] modern day revival that has swept the
[5:01] world all around the world the way we
[5:05] are today let me take God for him now
[5:09] here is what he has said
[5:14] clearly in the Word of God now listen if
[5:19] John brought forth his message and
[5:23] heralded the first coming of Christ and
[5:26] Elijah comes in the last name the
[5:31] Prophet said it shall be light in the
[5:35] evening time in other words there would
[5:39] be a light in the evening time I believe
[5:43] that shining light was the life message
[5:48] ministry of our precious brother William
[5:52] Marion brand room
[5:54] the Elijah of this hour
[5:57] according to Malachi 4:5 I will send on
[6:02] to you Elijah the Prophet and how he
[6:04] would turn the hearts of the children
[6:06] back to the father's amen
[6:10] how we God listen to that aim shall be
[6:16] like in the evening
[6:19] darkness the world would be in a garden
[6:24] Lil D seein condition when this
[6:28] messenger comes and his message and
[6:33] person would light up the age it would
[6:37] sell afire it would send a light that
[6:41] will shine so that the people that sat
[6:44] in darkness under denominational
[6:47] darkness will see a great light and then
[6:51] a great light shining light would have
[6:54] risen up and has risen up through the
[6:57] Ministry of our precious brother I thank
[7:00] God for him and blessed be the day but
[7:04] my paths cross with his message which
[7:08] has changed my life forever and forever
[7:12] now the evening like the biggest evening
[7:18] light we got is the evening star see the
[7:23] greatest light we got well then it would
[7:27] have to hear all the same message as it
[7:30] was with the other star in other words
[7:35] he will have the same ministry as John
[7:39] the Baptist identified the word for his
[7:44] day and introduced the word for his day
[7:49] to the people of that age
[7:53] so we'll and so has the ministry of this
[7:59] great prophet William Merrin Brandon
[8:04] introduced the Word of God for the hour
[8:08] the person of Jesus Christ in Word form
[8:12] was introduced to us he identified that
[8:19] word of God and here we are today with a
[8:24] revelation of who he is
[8:27] thanks be to God it has to be the same
[8:31] message because John pointed to Jesus
[8:35] Christ and brother branham's ministry
[8:39] pointed to Jesus Christ he never pointed
[8:44] towards himself he always lifted up
[8:47] Jesus Christ one of the most humble men
[8:51] there ever was and Jesus was the very
[8:56] same and center of his entire life and
[9:01] of his entire ministry now we see that
[9:08] it has the same message its heralding
[9:11] the son and speaking of the son that is
[9:16] what he did he herald the coming of the
[9:19] Lord and he spoke about the Lord all the
[9:23] time he lifted up Jesus and by doing
[9:28] that he brought in the third pole which
[9:32] is I if I be lifted up I'll draw all men
[9:37] unto myself and the Word of God in this
[9:41] hour is drawing thousands around the
[9:45] world to this message of the hour and I
[9:48] thank God for it well now we are in the
[9:53] evening time do you believe that weird
[9:56] evening time there's a a wonderful song
[10:00] that says this is the evening time it's
[10:04] later than you
[10:06] a prophetess cross the land take God
[10:09] that this profit crisscross the world
[10:13] and declared his message Amen for the
[10:18] evening time is here and darkness is
[10:21] upon the land the evening lights are
[10:24] here this age is banished away see what
[10:30] I mean
[10:31] this day has passed over and they'll be
[10:35] a heralding another day to come now
[10:40] this wonderful Ministry of this evening
[10:43] star first of all was to let the world
[10:48] know that the stars come out to shine
[10:51] after that the Sun has gone down so that
[10:56] star reflecting the message of the
[11:01] seventh church age messenger that age
[11:05] had to die out and as it died out it
[11:10] gave way to the birth of the coming of
[11:14] the Lord Himself by the opening of the
[11:19] seventh seal and when the Sun rises or
[11:24] it becomes the rising of the Sun then it
[11:28] is a new day and then that evening star
[11:32] that heralded the coming of the up of
[11:38] the evening time must now fade away
[11:41] fading away like the stars of the
[11:44] morning losing their light in the
[11:46] glorious Sun Oh think of this my
[11:49] brother's my sister's here today this
[11:52] wonderful marvelous ministry I'm trying
[11:56] to get to you the importance then aníbal
[12:01] purpose and the Magnificent use of this
[12:06] prophet that God made made use of this
[12:10] prophet and the Spirit of God spoke
[12:13] through this prophet so that you and I
[12:16] may reckon
[12:18] the Word of God for our day and for our
[12:22] season we realize friends that the true
[12:27] light is now shining thanks be to God
[12:31] and a new day is dawning thank God
[12:34] now remember back in the Bible days in
[12:38] the time of John the Jews thought they
[12:42] needed a general a great general to
[12:46] arrange from amongst them another Gideon
[12:49] or sod you know chapter or one of these
[12:54] other Jewish generals to rise up and
[12:57] deliver them from the hands of
[13:01] domination among the of the Romans at
[13:05] that time but instead of a great general
[13:09] God sent them a baby God sent his son
[13:13] God sent his son God sent a lamb God
[13:18] sent to them brother sister the Lamb of
[13:21] God our Redeemer to redeem all mankind
[13:26] God sent him on this earth for that
[13:29] purpose and in our day we find out with
[13:32] all the viruses special ences troubles
[13:36] and trials all the various situations
[13:39] that circumstances have taken place in
[13:42] the world there is a great desire for a
[13:47] super smart and super intelligent person
[13:52] to come on the scene and to provide the
[13:57] leaders of the world and the nations of
[14:00] the world with answers to their
[14:03] questions but we know Jesus is the
[14:07] answer Jesus is the answer to all their
[14:10] longing Jesus is the answer to all their
[14:13] needs all they need is only Jesus only
[14:17] Jesus for only Jesus can satisfy thanks
[14:22] be to God
[14:23] yes sir you're looking for a redeemer
[14:25] and they need a redeemer they need a
[14:28] redeemer
[14:28] and the only Redeemer that can really
[14:31] redeem their soul and the only mediator
[14:35] between God and man is the Lord Jesus
[14:39] Christ for there is no other name given
[14:42] under heaven whereby we must be saved
[14:46] but the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[14:49] we know Acts chapter 4 verse 12 Paul
[14:52] said clearly when they asked him were
[14:56] men and brethren what shall we do
[14:58] he said repent and be baptized in the
[15:01] name of the Lord Jesus Christ there is
[15:04] no other name given under heaven whereby
[15:07] we must be saved yes sir
[15:12] now we understand clearly my friends
[15:15] that here that this great John the
[15:18] Baptist of that day a man came and
[15:22] introduced a redeemer and his redeemer
[15:27] was the Word made flesh that same
[15:32] anointing upon this precious brother
[15:35] bring him also came to bring us a
[15:41] redeemer
[15:43] but our Redeemer is not a man of flesh
[15:48] our Redeemer is the same word of God but
[15:54] not in the flesh form in the word form
[15:57] and we have to recognize Christ revealed
[16:03] or revealing himself in his own word for
[16:08] Christ is the mystery of God now being
[16:12] revealed God now being his own
[16:16] interpreter God now making his word
[16:20] plain to his wife to his elected seed to
[16:24] Abraham's seed who will recognize him
[16:27] for he when he the Spirit of Truth has
[16:31] come he will guide you into all truth
[16:33] and show you things to come this is why
[16:38] the Holy Spirit is here this is why this
[16:41] mess
[16:41] just come to us to guide us to the
[16:45] perfect light clearly as we look in the
[16:48] word we see here that he came to claim
[16:53] all the names in the book and he has
[16:57] laid down his life to be our Redeemer
[17:03] and to take our place at Calvary right
[17:08] now in the world today we see many
[17:11] doctors nurses paramedics and people in
[17:16] the health field are passing away in
[17:20] Italy 10,000 in the United States some
[17:23] are dying in Canada some are dying
[17:25] around the world why with their selfless
[17:28] nature they are going and tending to the
[17:33] sick and the afflicted and the troubled
[17:36] and giving their lives that others might
[17:39] live in this true sense the real
[17:43] Redeemer the real physician the real
[17:46] Savior is Jesus Christ our Lord who gave
[17:50] his life for all he lived on his life
[17:53] that we may go free that we may be
[17:56] forgiven that we may walk away knowing
[17:59] that he has shed his blood and paid the
[18:02] price that he died so we may not die in
[18:06] that way or be set to a devil hill but
[18:09] be free to live an abundant life a
[18:12] wonderful life a saved life of godly
[18:15] life a Christian life a change lifestyle
[18:18] walking in the light of God's Word for
[18:21] this day and for this hour now Christ a
[18:25] new day is dawning the Sun is rice has
[18:28] risen up upon us and Christ is coming
[18:32] again he is coming again and so there
[18:36] had to be a forerunner like it was the
[18:38] first time they had to be a forerunner
[18:41] of the Covenant as it was the first time
[18:44] and now in our day there has been a
[18:48] forerunner in our day and that name
[18:52] of that 4runner is not John the Baptist
[18:56] mentioned in the Bible the Bible is
[18:59] written and there nothing to be added to
[19:02] it but in our day God sent a prophet and
[19:07] his name as William Marion Branham a man
[19:12] just like you and I am man anointed of
[19:15] God and used by the Spirit of God God
[19:19] just used his body to speak through him
[19:22] and we have to discern the Lord's body
[19:25] and recognize that God's boys speaking
[19:29] through him was the voice of God
[19:31] speaking to us in this day and hour he
[19:35] was a forerunner of the covenant for
[19:38] this day thank God he introduced the
[19:41] cocoanut introduced the promise of God
[19:44] for this day and for this hour that he
[19:47] promised that the Son of Man would be
[19:50] revealed again when the conditions are
[19:54] like in the days of lot as it was in the
[19:57] days of Noah that would repeat again and
[20:01] we see the same conditions are here upon
[20:05] us and a forerunner has come with that
[20:08] Elijah's spirit to bring that wonderful
[20:12] covenant to us that we might recognize
[20:16] ourselves hallelujah so brother Branham
[20:20] introduced the covenant to us brother
[20:24] Branham introduced the covenant Oh
[20:27] wonderful day to this wonderful bride
[20:32] yes sir
[20:33] he introduced to us they the agreement
[20:37] between God and man that is what he
[20:41] introduced the brides covenant and you
[20:45] remember in the Old Testament Abraham
[20:48] had a covenant with God and then God
[20:51] spoke to him and made him a promise how
[20:55] that this great Abraham how he would
[20:59] have a son then we understand Abraham
[21:04] in the expectation of that coming son
[21:08] and while he was waiting with
[21:11] expectation on the arrival of that
[21:14] coming son himself and Sara began to
[21:18] experience a change in their body or a
[21:22] body change they were being transformed
[21:27] by God's power to transform that was
[21:31] released from that promise into his life
[21:35] and he waited on God and we know in the
[21:38] scriptures it came to pass so is it in
[21:41] our day that we are being introduced by
[21:44] this covenant messenger to the promise
[21:48] of God for our day amen
[21:51] that Jesus is coming again that the Son
[21:55] of Man would be revealed that he has a
[21:58] place prepared for us there is a rapture
[22:02] at hand and the Saints will be caught
[22:04] out of it the bride will not the God's
[22:08] wife will not go through the tribulation
[22:10] but she will be taken up and out before
[22:15] the tribulation and we are resting upon
[22:18] that marvelous and wonderful promise
[22:21] thank God Abraham had a covenant and a
[22:25] bride had a covenant in other words she
[22:28] she got her agreement with God her
[22:31] promise with God for marriage
[22:34] certificate with God her grace covenant
[22:38] that she would be treated by God's grace
[22:41] in this day and hour
[22:44] so what we have is the bride's covenant
[22:47] it's the bride's merits of the Vicki
[22:49] it's the it's God's grace covenant to
[22:52] her that no matter what she does no
[22:56] matter how she acts god still proves
[23:00] that he loves her has promised her that
[23:04] loving his own he will love them onto
[23:07] the until the very end of time and
[23:10] beyond the end of time throughout all
[23:12] eternity
[23:13] this is a great and wonderful story the
[23:17] story of God and his brain and his
[23:21] wonderful people now we understand
[23:24] friends that when the word Christ was
[23:27] introduced to us we believed or accepted
[23:31] the word which fully redeemed us when we
[23:35] became United with the word in other
[23:39] words by uniting with the word it placed
[23:43] us back into a rightful position right
[23:47] to his side where we originally came
[23:51] from this is just a symbol that we were
[23:54] in the mind of God before the foundation
[23:56] of the world and here we are being
[24:01] placed back original back into our
[24:04] position and we are given back or
[24:07] brought to the awareness or brought out
[24:10] the word spiritual amnesia that we have
[24:14] and possess eternal life we never began
[24:19] because we were a part of him and we
[24:21] will never end because we are a part of
[24:25] him and cannot die spiritually as much
[24:30] as God can't die
[24:32] this old flesh that we have to fight
[24:35] with every day that may fall to the
[24:39] ground but that man inside is being
[24:42] renewed day by day by the power of the
[24:45] Holy Ghost
[24:46] God's power that worketh in us to change
[24:50] us and to transform us and confirm us
[24:53] into the image of our Lord and Savior
[24:56] Jesus Christ how marvelous hallelujah
[24:59] that's it be the name the Lord amen our
[25:02] bridegroom is coming our great groom is
[25:08] on the way
[25:09] and I want to thank God for it
[25:11] hallelujah it's so much I'm I'm so happy
[25:15] about this that when I lay upon my bed
[25:19] brothers and sisters I'll tell you I can
[25:23] lay down and sleep with a peace in my
[25:26] heart knowing that I am
[25:29] the redeemed I am rejoicing that I have
[25:34] poor unpossessed total deliverance
[25:37] because he has redeemed me by his
[25:40] precious blood and cleanse my heart
[25:43] opened my eyes to recognize my day and
[25:49] message that applies to my day and
[25:53] understand that I might have the
[25:56] understanding by opening the eyes of my
[25:59] heart to recognize who he is in his
[26:03] blessed holy and precious word
[26:06] thanks be to God forevermore oh yes sir
[26:09] the things God has given to us
[26:12] no man can really live up to it just as
[26:16] much as no person could have lived up to
[26:19] the Ten Commandments they could live up
[26:22] to it without some flaw somewhere oh my
[26:27] and now we see a prophet coming bringing
[26:30] to us the stature of a perfect man
[26:33] bringing to us the full word and and
[26:37] here we are yeah we naturally as human
[26:41] beings to try to live up to that we fail
[26:45] over and over again we fail but thanks
[26:49] be to God has given us the brides
[26:52] Covenant the Abraham's covenant which we
[26:56] are trusting on hallelujah amen we were
[27:00] predestinated to this we did not plan
[27:03] this we did not choose him he said I
[27:06] have chosen you you have not chosen me
[27:10] thanks be to God
[27:12] oh my god before the foundations of the
[27:16] world his love projected God so loved
[27:20] the world that is love projected and
[27:23] when his love projected his grace
[27:26] followed it to stretch for us to find us
[27:29] and to place us restore us back to our
[27:33] original position where we came from
[27:37] oh my take God for this wonderful coming
[27:41] on
[27:41] of grace that God gave to Abraham God
[27:46] said to Abraham Abraham listen this
[27:49] covenant I'm giving you you don't have
[27:53] to do anything the normal covenant is
[27:57] usually you do this and I'll do that if
[28:02] you do this I will do that in Abraham's
[28:07] covenant which is better known as the
[28:11] unconditional covenant there were no
[28:14] conditions attached there was no works
[28:17] attached there was nothing Abraham had
[28:21] to say or do
[28:23] it was just freely given Abraham was not
[28:28] worthy he was an idol worshiper from the
[28:32] plains of Shinar coming out worshiping
[28:35] all those torn gods but God always Grace
[28:40] not that he was better than any one else
[28:43] in that day and in that hour but God
[28:46] through His grace elected and chose
[28:49] Abraham and so has the same God and I'm
[28:53] day elected and chosen you and chosen me
[28:58] chosen us to walk in the light of his
[29:02] word we all blessed be the name of the
[29:05] Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus Abraham
[29:09] you don't have to do anything nothing at
[29:12] all I've already done it for you thanks
[29:14] be to God oh jesus said that day would
[29:18] repeat again Abraham you don't have to
[29:21] do one thing I've done it all for you as
[29:25] it was in the days of lot so shall it be
[29:30] in the day when the son of man is being
[29:33] revealed luck was in Sodom down in Sodom
[29:38] in the plains while Abraham was up on
[29:42] the top of the mountain and on the top
[29:46] of the mountain he was receiving a
[29:48] promise God came to him in a theophany
[29:53] and
[29:55] spoke to him and said your wife Sarah
[29:59] will bear a son oh yes brother
[30:04] wonderful and so that scene repeats
[30:08] again in our day look while all people
[30:13] are misled caught up with all kinds of
[30:15] creeds and dogmas and doctrines and
[30:18] denominationalism and systems and all
[30:22] types of things are out there flying
[30:25] around catching and attracting the minds
[30:29] of the people but God already claimed
[30:32] purpose and pointed this out by prophecy
[30:36] there will be some of Abraham's seed or
[30:40] people like Abraham in spirit that will
[30:43] be upon the earth at that time and they
[30:47] will receive me amen thanks be to God
[30:50] God visited Abraham and God has visited
[30:54] us through a message from a prophet
[30:58] coming into our lives God not God in the
[31:02] form he was back there with Abraham but
[31:06] now not in the theophany
[31:08] but in a Word form God has visited us
[31:11] and we have recognized him as Abraham
[31:15] recognized him when Abraham saw those
[31:18] tree men coming towards him he didn't
[31:22] answer
[31:22] Oh Blessed Trinity oh I'm so thankful
[31:25] that you came to me no he looked and
[31:29] said my lord my lord and even so we who
[31:35] have heard this this doctrine of the
[31:38] Trinity which is absolutely only a new
[31:42] doctrine Babylonian doctrine from the
[31:44] 300 ad s around that time and before
[31:48] taught by the Babylonians and other
[31:52] nations around the world and then
[31:54] adopted into Christianity at 325 80 we
[31:59] have recognized the falsity of that we
[32:02] have recognized the perversion of the
[32:05] word of God
[32:07] like Abraham we look at three but we see
[32:10] one God here o Israel the Lord thy God
[32:14] is one Lord
[32:17] this same Jesus only one Lord is both
[32:21] Lord and Christ o faithful we are that
[32:25] our eyes have been opened in this day
[32:27] and in this hour aren't you happy here
[32:29] today to recognize that you can see God
[32:32] and God gave you the eyes to see because
[32:36] unto them it is not given but unto you
[32:39] it is given to know the mystery and to
[32:43] see the mystery of the kingdom of God
[32:45] it's hid from them but it's a revelation
[32:48] to you and I by God's wonderful
[32:52] marvelous grace I'm so thankful to God
[32:55] that he's the same yesterday today and
[32:58] forever and I love him with all of my
[33:03] heart thanks be to God
[33:04] we're living in a tremendous times
[33:07] tremendous times trouble sometimes are
[33:11] here filling men's hearts with fear
[33:15] freedom we all hold dear now is at stake
[33:20] humble your heart to God saves from the
[33:24] chastening rod seeks the way pilgrim
[33:27] strong Christians awake Jesus is coming
[33:32] soon morning or night or noon many well

[33:43] death shall arise righteously in the sky
[33:48] going where no one dies heavenward bound
[33:54] we're bound for the rapture we're bound
[33:57] for the promised land even in the midst
[34:00] of these troubles sometimes that we are
[34:03] living in no more we have to worry about
[34:06] anything because the world has been shut
[34:10] off from this but God has come and has
[34:15] whispered and is whispering love secrets
[34:21] in the ears of his wife for the marriage
[34:23] of the land the Uniting time of the lamb
[34:28] and his bride the invisible union has
[34:32] come and and the wife has made herself
[34:36] ready for she is no more a bride but she
[34:40] is a wife now for she has received his
[34:44] word and gives glory and praise to his
[34:47] wonderful and precious name thank god
[34:50] there's no more me having to wonder you
[34:54] having to wonder if you're a real
[34:56] Christian if you're a true believer if
[34:58] you can backslide if you can be lost not
[35:03] in a situation or a condition and
[35:06] attitude where you are not certain of
[35:10] God but like Paul we can say I am
[35:13] persuaded Amen I am persuaded that he is
[35:18] able to keep that which I have committed
[35:21] unto him against that day I know my sins
[35:25] are gone we must be certain our sins are
[35:28] gone I rebuke every spirit of
[35:31] condemnation and guilt from you repent
[35:35] turn if you know you have done something
[35:38] wrong and out of line then turn to God
[35:41] your heavenly Father and ask for his
[35:44] divine forgiveness and he will set you
[35:48] free
[35:48] God has already done it for you he's
[35:51] done it for us and just completed the
[35:54] work he's completed all of his work and
[35:57] we are asked to enter in to what is
[36:01] already provided for us thank God it's
[36:05] not redemption for for one week or for a
[36:09] month or for two years or three years of
[36:13] the minute you slip or make that mistake
[36:16] whoa I'm lost again no this is
[36:20] Redemption forever amen because if you
[36:24] are an eternal son of God you did not
[36:28] just get eternal life
[36:30] on a certain day eternal means without a
[36:34] beginning and without and in which means
[36:38] that you had no beginning and you will
[36:41] have no end you come from God and you're
[36:45] going right back to God where you come
[36:48] from as one of his children if you're a
[36:51] child of God that statement child of God
[36:54] already reveals to you that you must be
[36:57] an eternal being that comes from the far
[37:00] reaches of eternity now you are being
[37:04] expressed manifested and revealed in
[37:07] time but you're going back to God where
[37:11] you come from thanks be to his wonderful
[37:14] and precious name oh yes sir we have to
[37:19] we are whole so happy that we have
[37:21] redemption forever and we are never
[37:24] going to die our our soul will not die
[37:29] only the soul that sinneth it shall die
[37:32] because it didn't come from God it
[37:36] wasn't in the mind of God
[37:38] it wasn't there with him but we were
[37:41] with him and in him no expressed in this
[37:44] hour and Christ The Anointed word is the
[37:48] mystery of God now being revealed the
[37:51] word made flesh and the flesh being made
[37:54] word going back to the Godhead traveling
[37:57] back home to God where we come from Jew
[38:00] drops going back where they come from
[38:02] pulled by the power of the Sun but I am
[38:06] lifted up I'll draw all men unto myself
[38:09] and that is what he is doing here today
[38:12] by his wonderful and marvelous grace
[38:15] hallelujah my brother sister saint of
[38:18] God I I trust that we don't take these
[38:21] things for granted but we will recognize
[38:25] our position and keep our lamps trimmed
[38:29] and brighter and burning for the glory
[38:33] of God now in the Book of Luke chapter
[38:36] 15 verses 8 to 10 it is written either
[38:42] what woman have
[38:44] ten pieces of silver if she lose one
[38:47] piece don't not light a candle and sweep
[38:50] the house and seek diligently until she
[38:54] find it and when she had found it she
[38:58] call it her friends and her neighbors
[39:00] together saying rejoice with me for I
[39:04] have found the peace which I have lost
[39:07] likewise I say unto you there is joy in
[39:11] the presence of the angels of God over
[39:15] one sinner that repenteth oh thanks I
[39:20] praise God for his love that this
[39:24] wonderful woman found that coin she
[39:28] found that wonderful coin that she had
[39:31] lost and while we're talking about that
[39:34] friends I believe it's lamp trimming
[39:37] time for us I believe we ought to sweep
[39:40] our lives that woman lost the coin she
[39:45] lit a candle first secondly she began to
[39:50] sweep her house all the dust all day the
[39:53] excess garbage rubbish she swept her
[39:57] house that's what she did let the candle
[40:01] begin to swept the house she searched
[40:04] thirdly she began to search and by
[40:07] searching she found a coin we must do
[40:11] the same thing let's search our lives
[40:14] let's sweep out the things that are not
[40:16] of God brother sister like a candle the
[40:19] Word of God can be lit up cast the light
[40:23] of the Word of God upon your life and
[40:25] that word of God will will show you the
[40:29] little things whether you are a believer
[40:33] you're just a person that doesn't have
[40:36] anything to do with God or Church or
[40:38] whether you've been a believer for years
[40:40] let the light of God's Word search
[40:43] through your life as we say search me O
[40:47] God and try my heart today see if there
[40:51] be any wicked way in me and
[40:54] hence me from every sin I ask it in
[40:57] Jesus name
[40:59] then brother sister then as it searches
[41:02] through your heart then go forth and let
[41:06] him cast out everything that is unlike
[41:10] like himself and praise his wonderful
[41:13] name truly I thank him for the light of
[41:17] the word and where he leads me I will
[41:23] follow I will follow Jesus all the way
[41:28] one time rather Brandon was up in a
[41:32] place called Mills Ville and there was a
[41:38] Church of Christ brother there and he
[41:44] approached brother Branham and said
[41:45] brother Branham I see you're talking
[41:50] about healings about all these miracles
[41:53] but signs and wonders III can't see that
[41:58] stuff I just can't see it brother
[42:02] Brandon he said brother Branham was
[42:05] talking to him after a church service of
[42:07] course and said to him brother he says
[42:11] to him brother outside of the church
[42:13] where do you live
[42:14] he says oh I I live over the hill
[42:18] brother Branham Oh brother man said oh
[42:21] you live over the hill well how how do
[42:25] you how do you see to get there because
[42:28] it's dark between this hill and that
[42:32] hill for for you to get home it's pretty
[42:35] dark how do you see he said well of
[42:38] course brother Branham I I carry a light
[42:40] I walk with the light so where the band
[42:44] said so that light that you walk with
[42:47] shines all the way from the church where
[42:51] we are standing here all the way to your
[42:54] home and you see your home from here in
[42:59] the church yard all the way before
[43:02] you're going to start walking he's an
[43:05] apostle I
[43:08] where I live and I just shine that light
[43:11] and I just go one step at a time
[43:16] walking in the light brother Branham
[43:19] said so is it with Jesus Christ brother
[43:22] you don't see it all at one time
[43:26] amen amen isn't that right one step at a
[43:31] time we don't see everything in God's
[43:34] world at one time we don't see the
[43:37] entire journey at one time but one day
[43:41] at a time one step at a time we walk in
[43:45] the light as he is in the light amen
[43:49] that is what we are supposed to do we as
[43:51] Christians don't mature into mature
[43:55] Christians overnight but here a little
[43:58] there a little one revelation here one
[44:02] thought there one little thing here and
[44:05] we begin to grow and and be nourished in
[44:09] the grace of the Living God one son I
[44:14] have it just written on this flight leaf
[44:19] I'm following Jesus one step at a time
[44:23] I live for the moment in his love divine
[44:28] his presence grows sweeter each moment
[44:31] each name
[44:33] I'm following Jesus each step of the way
[44:40] or believer I want to say don't be
[44:42] discouraged if you think you do not
[44:45] understand all of God's Word or you do
[44:48] not see all of the message of the hour
[44:52] that's yet just take it one day at a
[44:56] time one step at a time
[44:59] just follow the Lord Jesus Christ in the
[45:04] opening of his word just live for the
[45:07] moment in his marvelous love divine of
[45:12] course I've just made the point that
[45:14] spiritual growth is gradual day by day
[45:20] line upon line precept upon precept here
[45:25] a little there a little see just like in
[45:29] a human body cell up on top of cell
[45:32] builds the human body so word upon word
[45:36] revelation upon revelation from
[45:39] listening to the sermons of the prophet
[45:44] of this day which is important
[45:46] especially in this time when we have
[45:50] this season when we're at home listen to
[45:54] the prophets messages we need no one
[45:58] else to prompt us to listen to the
[46:01] prophets messages but we should go and
[46:03] feed from the storehouse which is their
[46:07] Word of God there is no place where
[46:09] there is a storehouse there is no barn
[46:12] or building no organization that is a
[46:15] storehouse the storehouse is the word of
[46:19] God the unfailing reality of the word of
[46:23] the Living God which comes my revelation
[46:25] from God himself and comes to you so
[46:29] feed on the word that comes true the
[46:33] sermons of the prophet of God feed also
[46:37] upon the sermons of your pasture
[46:40] wherever you are God has given that
[46:43] pasture you you feed on the messages
[46:46] that's coming through the mouth of your
[46:49] pastor as he is anointed by the Holy
[46:52] Spirit
[46:53] God to bring the Word of God feed upon
[46:57] the world that comes through the mouth
[46:59] of the gods sent God anointed God
[47:02] vindicated fivefold ministry as the
[47:06] prophet of God has said I am only
[47:08] hitting the highlights but when when
[47:11] them young men come amen yes sir
[47:15] they'll break the entire thing down and
[47:18] they'll bring it to you
[47:19] they'll just present it to you I'm just
[47:22] hitting the highlights so now I believe
[47:24] we're living in dismay this hour and
[47:27] this time the Word of God coming to you
[47:30] God interpreting its own word amen the
[47:34] fan fine fingers is in his hand by
[47:38] fingers fivefold ministry in his hand
[47:41] and he'll use them to thoroughly purge
[47:43] his floor his thrashing floor but his
[47:47] wonderful grace hallelujah praise God
[47:50] for evermore I'm happy to say I am one
[47:53] of them you say oh they're holy rollers
[47:56] oh then they act like they're
[47:57] Pentecostals oh he's a fanatic I am a
[48:01] fanatic in the sense that I've been to
[48:04] the Attic and I've come back down with
[48:06] the glory of God within my heart praise
[48:09] be to God I'm following Jesus he one
[48:14] step at a time
[48:17] I live for the moment in his love divine
[48:23] his his love grows sweeter each moment
[48:28] each day I'm following Jesus each step
[48:34] of the way
[48:36] I'm following him each step of the way I
[48:39] can't see all the way but one day at a
[48:43] time one step at a time
[48:46] hallelujah praise be to God what a great
[48:50] honor this is I'm so excited
[48:53] brother sister are we all were sinners
[48:56] and God by His grace has changed of our
[48:59] lives but we have seen this great power
[49:02] where this great glorious shine
[49:05] light hey man has broken true to us and
[49:09] I'm not speaking about brother branham
[49:13] here now I'm speaking about the great
[49:15] shining light of the word of God
[49:18] breaking the light has suddenly turned
[49:21] on and you recognize who you are and who
[49:25] God is and he makes himself known to you
[49:29] and places you positionally back where
[49:32] you come from I'm so happy I thank God
[49:36] hallelujah it's good when the sister
[49:40] could rejoice in the Lord rejoice in the
[49:42] Lord and again I say rejoice
[49:45] hallelujah this is the day where a man
[49:48] or a woman can receive the Holy Ghost
[49:51] without sensation and without exhibition
[49:56] of human emotion nevertheless if you
[50:02] truly have the Holy Ghost you are going
[50:05] to show some emotion somewhere because
[50:08] if a baby is truly born and it's not
[50:12] stillborn it's gonna scream and shout
[50:15] and it's going to shout and give glory
[50:18] happy its mother is there it might be
[50:22] wailing away but that baby is exhibiting
[50:24] and showing that it has life let me
[50:27] repeat this is the hour any man any
[50:31] woman any person can receive the Holy
[50:34] Spirit without sensation or emotional
[50:39] exhibition a exhibition isn't but
[50:43] nevertheless if you truly have the Holy
[50:47] Spirit the Holy Spirit will expressions
[50:50] are true you with emotions also thanks
[50:55] be to God for a marvelous wonderful
[50:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:01] thanks be to God the evening lights have
[51:04] come it is a fact that God and Christ
[51:08] are one
[51:11] we'll walk in the light such a beautiful
[51:16] line walk where the dew drops of mercies
[51:21] are bright shine all around us by day
[51:25] and by nine it is Jesus he's the light
[51:30] of the world god bless you today my
[51:34] brothers and sisters I want to thank God
[51:37] for the messenger that came thank God
[51:41] God allowed that messenger through the
[51:44] medium of his message to pass my way and
[51:48] he had that message had to pass my way
[51:52] for I was blind like blind Bartimaeus
[51:55] and the Holy Spirit had to pass my way
[51:59] think of it one day brother sister how
[52:03] that this great wonderful hour I heard a
[52:10] sound like the Apostles acts 2:4 which
[52:14] said they heard a sound from heaven a
[52:17] rustling as of a rushing Mighty Wind and
[52:20] it filled all the place in which they
[52:23] were sitting brothers sisters I think I
[52:27] hear that same sound passing here today
[52:30] by God's grace a heavenly sound a sound
[52:34] from heaven if the wind of the Holy
[52:36] Spirit passing true what is it it's the
[52:39] great evil has spread his wings and he's
[52:44] passing over the land a barnyard of this
[52:47] world and he's calling out his own with
[52:51] a scream through that prophet of the
[52:54] hour calling out his own to recognize
[52:57] the tone the voice they that the voice
[53:00] of the great eagle calling to the spirit
[53:03] of they are these people - the to that
[53:05] Caesar that's in you God spirit calling
[53:09] out you don't know what it is but you
[53:11] recognize there's something back there
[53:13] and it's calling me the deep calls to
[53:16] the deep and the deep will respond my
[53:19] sheep will hear my voice and a stranger
[53:23] they will not follow
[53:25] on the great Eagle searching in this
[53:27] hour for his own and passing over the
[53:30] barnyard of this rotten stinking deluded

[54:00] Living God and while God is speaking to
[54:03] us telling us we're going into a rapture

[54:09] condition and you're going out of here

[54:25] Eagles wing and grab ahold of it because
[54:31] he's going to take us for a flight look
[54:34] but before that flight he begins to flap
[54:37] his wings he begins to flap his wings
[54:42] and the wind from his wings begins to
[54:46] blow away all the loose feathers from
[54:49] our lives all the junk all the bad
[54:54] habits all of the mistakes all of the
[54:58] faults he identifies you and you
[55:01] recognize yourself being exposed and
[55:06] examined by the Word of God thanks be to
[55:10] God that his passing my way here today
[55:14] thanks being a God he's passing in my
[55:16] home today thanks me that God is passing
[55:19] through my life today
[55:21] may he pass through your life for his
[55:23] glory and honor and when he does grab a
[55:26] hold of one of his promises of his word
[55:29] grab a haul of one quill oh because this
[55:34] great
[55:34] people must found us and he is going to
[55:37] take a flight don't you realize saying
[55:40] to God we are already a taxiing into the
[55:45] rapture in flight that we are about to
[55:47] take we are on the taxi we're on the
[55:50] ramp right now this's thing is about to
[55:53] take off and break us into the presence

[56:04] for the promised land who will come and
[56:07] go with me I am bound for the promised
[56:10] land
[56:11] God has found us and we have found him
[56:15] and nothing can change that nothing can
[56:18] take it away none can separate us from
[56:21] the love of God which is in the Lord
[56:25] Jesus Christ amen
[56:27] I can see little David by the river and
[56:32] he's playing his harp as I'm about to
[56:35] conclude this message here he is playing
[56:39] on his little harp by the rivers of
[56:43] Babylon there we sat down when we
[56:48] remembered Zion and then the scripture
[56:51] says in Psalm 126 one two three when the
[56:58] Lord turned our captivity we were like
[57:03] them that dream then was our hearts
[57:08] filled with with singing and our mouths
[57:12] with laughter for he said the Lord has
[57:16] done great things for us we're off we're
[57:20] glad why shouldn't I praise the Lord why
[57:23] shouldn't a Christian be happy why
[57:25] should the believer give blessings and
[57:28] praise to God for he brought us out of
[57:30] the miry clay and placed her feet upon
[57:34] that upon the rock to stay so here is
[57:38] David playing and rejoicing in the Lord
[57:41] because he used to we settled onto our
[57:45] various
[57:45] national denominations we were in David
[57:50] sat by the rivers of Babylon but now he
[57:54] recognized who he was and how God was so
[57:57] good to him began to praise him glorify
[58:00] him or you were the great Redeemer
[58:02] you're my fortress you are my all and
[58:05] all you are my you're my Alpha you are
[58:08] my Omega you my beginning you're my end
[58:10] you the bright you the morning star
[58:13] you're the Lamb that shed your blood for
[58:16] me you are the one you were the seals
[58:19] and you get you were the one that open
