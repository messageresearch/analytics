[26:34] foreign
[26:35] [Music]
[26:46] praise God and for those believers who
[26:49] were in our Friday night prayer meeting
[26:51] I shared that with this testimony with
[26:53] them so you're going to get a double
[26:54] blessing I trust by the grace of God but
[26:57] um and even after Sharon on Friday the
[26:59] Lord brought it back to my remembering
[27:01] that the experience I had on Thursday
[27:03] night was actually an outflow of the
[27:05] service on Wednesday because what
[27:07] happened if during the service you know
[27:09] you may recall our brother Desmond
[27:10] admonish enough and encouraging us to
[27:13] always be blessing to the people that we
[27:14] meet even in Simplicity you know just
[27:16] the joy of our heart that's in us when
[27:18] we express that to them that's a
[27:20] blessing so I have our brother with
[27:21] Minister and you know I thought to
[27:23] myself Lord give me more of those
[27:24] experiences right and I had forgotten
[27:27] about that of course so when this
[27:29] happened on Thursday I didn't put the
[27:31] two together until Friday night when I
[27:33] recalled when I thought about it so on
[27:35] Thursday evening after work you know as
[27:37] we do sometimes we love Avid Gardener so
[27:39] I love to garden and I was out there
[27:41] though we always battling against those
[27:43] weeds right so I was out of my front
[27:45] lawn pulling off weeds and so on and so
[27:47] forth and in our neighborhood people are
[27:49] really friendly we thank God for that
[27:50] and uh you know usually have a feeling
[27:53] path by we'll just wave and say good
[27:54] evening and so on but on my sidewalk I
[27:57] was approaching me I found this lady
[27:58] older lady walking her dog and as she
[28:02] was walking though I could just feed her
[28:03] counting and feel really down but I just
[28:05] created her I said good evening you know
[28:07] she said good evening back and I'm like
[28:09] how are you right and she took Florida
[28:12] answer and then she said I'm managing
[28:14] right and I said I know it's not easy
[28:17] right but I just said but one day at a
[28:19] time right thank God right I said to her
[28:21] you know I know sometimes it's not easy
[28:23] but just Moment by moment right so she
[28:26] paused right outside my driveway if I
[28:28] was and she stopped and she started
[28:30] speaking with me and she started sharing
[28:32] how that her husband is in the hospital
[28:33] and that he's been in ICU for the last
[28:36] five months right
[28:38] and as she shared you know and I won't
[28:40] be able to express everything because we
[28:42] actually end up speaking for over an
[28:44] hour right
[28:45] but through that Fellowship I end up
[28:47] telling her about the loss of brother
[28:49] Daniel if you believe Earth may know you
[28:50] have my first and late husband right and
[28:53] then I learned that she had actually
[28:54] lost her husband many many years before
[28:57] but the husband she's with now they've
[28:59] been married for 35 years and she was
[29:02] telling me though how that you know on
[29:03] their way back from a trip in Cuba he
[29:06] got a heart attack on the plane but
[29:08] there was a Nerf there who was able to
[29:10] give him an IV they had to have an
[29:12] emergency stop in Pittsburgh and he was
[29:14] there for a while and over a hundred
[29:16] thousand dollars she was telling me of
[29:18] medical expenses eventually he was
[29:20] airlifted to the Brantford hospital
[29:22] where we live but now he's been in the
[29:24] ICU for five months and you know she'll
[29:27] tell me how every day she goes there and
[29:29] it's so hard and it's so tiring but I
[29:32] was just starting to encourage her and I
[29:33] was letting her realize I'm like look
[29:35] what you just told me that on the plane
[29:37] beside him with a nurse who was able to
[29:40] give him an IV then he emergency landing
[29:43] in Pittsburgh God didn't take him they
[29:46] were able to help him brought him back
[29:48] home so I said even though he's been in
[29:50] ICU for five months God is able if the
[29:53] Lord wanted to take him away he would
[29:54] have taken him already if I said you
[29:56] encourage him his name is Mark and I
[29:58] said would you mind if I prayed for you
[29:59] and she said sure it's okay you know so
[30:02] we prayed right there on the sidewalk
[30:04] and she was so happy she was in tears
[30:06] and everything right and then after that
[30:09] she would feel really she was just
[30:10] smiling and joyful right and then we
[30:13] started talking about other things in
[30:14] life and even if it wasn't for the fact
[30:16] that I had to leave to pick up our son
[30:18] from football because it was over an
[30:20] hour later that we kept fellowshipping
[30:22] and that's why I had to leave her
[30:24] because I had to go pick up her son but
[30:26] you know what else it brought to mind
[30:27] you know first of all it was a big
[30:29] change between you know when I first
[30:30] encountered her all down cuffed and fad
[30:33] on that walk versus when she was leaving
[30:35] me she and now I'm gonna fade if I
[30:37] didn't see this on Friday but if not for
[30:39] my glory it's for the glory of the Lord
[30:40] she would literally think oh Marsha
[30:42] you're an angel you're so sweet you're
[30:44] such a sweet person right and I'm like
[30:46] praise the Lord because I know we know
[30:48] we're not Angels In the Flesh right but
[30:50] the word angel means Messenger right so
[30:53] I'm glad the Lord was able to use me to
[30:54] bring a message of encouragement to her
[30:56] and as a visual for those of you who may
[30:58] have watched a chosen you know if you've
[31:00] seen the episode where the woman at the
[31:02] well met Jesus right you may recall when
[31:04] she came up to him you know she was sad
[31:07] and everything but then when she left
[31:08] she was running and joyful and happy
[31:10] right and that's the visual that the
[31:12] Lord helped me to real life in in this
[31:15] time right on Thursday evening God gave
[31:17] me that experience so my dear brothers
[31:19] and sisters you know this is to
[31:20] encourage us that hey I have to worry
[31:22] comes forth as the word live enough when
[31:24] we say hi to someone we say how are you
[31:27] to someone we receive their answer we
[31:29] know not everyone is going to open up
[31:30] but we never know who will open up we
[31:33] never know who will have the opportunity
[31:34] to pray for and sure enough I stage
[31:36] numbers with her and we trust the Lord
[31:38] to continue to be a blessing each
[31:39] other's life if I pray to tell the money
[31:42] with an encouragement to you for the
[31:43] glory of God Amen praise the Lord

[46:22] I don't know if you remember last last
[46:24] uh
[46:26] Friday prayer meeting there brother
[46:27] Desmond uh prayed for myself
[46:31] felt led to ask him to pray for myself
[46:33] for uh
[46:34] the meetings there and he
[46:36] he spoke a bunch of things
[46:39] and I looked over my wife after the
[46:41] prayer was done and I said let it be
[46:44] done according as has been spoken and
[46:46] let me tell you it was done amen it was
[46:49] really done God really taken him I I
[46:52] spoke on um
[46:55] uh
[46:56] the mystery in the bride is moving
[46:58] forward some of the stuff I brung here
[47:00] but God took it in such a totally
[47:02] different direction and uh just
[47:05] basically trying to bring them out of
[47:07] the past and bring them into the present
[47:10] in order to do that you have to repent
[47:13] you have to confess and make things
[47:15] right so you can move forward with God
[47:17] and we all know that by our experience
[47:19] we don't move forward with God unless we
[47:22] repent amen that's that's why God loves
[47:26] and David love to repent though he made
[47:28] a lot of mistakes he loved to repent
[47:31] amen
[47:32] Hallelujah Hallelujah God put something
[47:35] on my heart this morning we'll get right
[47:36] to the word
[47:38] um
[47:39] I'm not going to be able to finish it
[47:41] for sure this morning I don't know which
[47:43] direction it's going to go in
[47:45] but
[47:46] um
[47:47] and I pray that it will be a blessing to
[47:50] you
[47:51] amen that somehow in your life that you
[47:54] will uh see this amen and not
[47:57] necessarily see what I'm saying but see
[47:59] what the spirit is speaking amen you
[48:02] bring your faith in here this morning
[48:03] you bring your experience in here this
[48:05] morning you bring your walk with God
[48:07] it's not the building
[48:09] the tent that we're in here is the tent
[48:11] of the Holy Ghost and the spirit of God
[48:13] Amen
[48:14] so I want to go to Second Corinthians 12
[48:18] 1.
[48:19] you pray for me
[48:22] um just a little different for me this
[48:24] morning I don't know why
[48:26] but uh
[48:29] I guess it's right in the title and my
[48:31] title is
[48:33] um
[48:33] strength is revealed in weakness
[48:37] so I'm certainly I don't know why but
[48:39] I'm in kind of weakness this morning and
[48:41] fighting certain things but
[48:44] um
[48:45] strength comes out of weakness
[48:47] and that's what I want to talk about
[48:48] amen
[48:50] Hallelujah
[48:53] second Corinthians 12 1 and then we're
[48:55] going to go to Hebrews 4 14.
[49:06] Paul speaking here
[49:08] it is not Expediting it for me doubtless
[49:12] to Glory
[49:13] I will come to visions and Revelations
[49:16] of the Lord
[49:17] I knew a man in Christ before above 14
[49:22] years ago whether in the body I cannot
[49:25] tell
[49:26] or whether out of the body I cannot tell
[49:29] God knoweth
[49:31] such a one caught up
[49:34] to the third heaven
[49:36] and I knew such a man whether in the
[49:39] body or out of the body I cannot tell
[49:42] God knoweth how that he was caught up
[49:45] into paradise and heard unspeakable
[49:49] words
[49:50] which is not lawful
[49:52] for a man to utter
[49:55] of such and one will glory yet of myself
[49:59] I will not Glory but in my infirmities
[50:04] for though
[50:06] for through I would desire to Glory
[50:10] I shall not be a fool
[50:13] for I will say the truth
[50:17] but now I for Bear least any man should
[50:21] think of me above that which he seeth me
[50:24] and be or that he heareth of me
[50:29] unless I should be exalted above measure
[50:33] through the abundance of Revelation
[50:36] there was given to me a thorn in the
[50:40] flesh
[50:41] a messenger of Satan to Buffet me
[50:45] lest I should be exalted above measure
[50:48] for this thing I bersought the Lord
[50:51] twice
[50:53] that it might depart from me
[50:56] and he said unto me my grace is
[50:59] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[51:03] made perfect in weakness
[51:06] most gladly therefore I would rather
[51:08] Glory my infirmities that the power of
[51:11] Christ May rest upon me
[51:14] therefore I take Pleasures in my
[51:16] infirmities and reproaches and
[51:19] necessaries and persecutions and
[51:21] distress for Christ's sake
[51:24] for when I am weak
[51:27] then I am strong
[51:29] amen that's going to be our theme for
[51:33] when I am weak
[51:34] then I am strong
[51:37] Hebrews 4 14.
[51:40] it's talking about the word of God here
[51:44] the word of God is quick and powerful
[51:47] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[51:50] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[51:53] Soul and Spirit and of the joints of the
[51:58] marrow and is a discerner of the
[52:00] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[52:04] let us pray father
[52:06] we thank you this morning that we can
[52:08] gather together
[52:10] Lord
[52:12] it's a great gathering this morning Lord
[52:16] but it would be nothing without you lord

[52:32] are lying before you speak to your
[52:34] children father

[52:38] do father you deliver you set free the
[52:42] captives Lord you open the prison doors
[52:44] you break the chains Lord you give
[52:47] strength Lord to the weak you always
[52:50] give strength to the weak father
[52:53] touch us both speaker and hearer Lord in
[52:57] Jesus name we pray amen
[52:59] God bless you as you see it
[53:03] Hallelujah
[53:04] amen
[53:06] don't want to get ahead of myself here
[53:09] Hallelujah
[53:12] you know
[53:14] we must continue to repeat ourselves
[53:16] over and over and over again
[53:20] we're living in such a day in an age
[53:23] where everybody wants things fast fast
[53:28] and nothing sinks in
[53:32] you know I was preaching there in
[53:35] petroleum and I was telling a few
[53:37] believers
[53:38] and they said oh you had job and asked
[53:40] sheep because I kept going over
[53:42] everything over everything over and over
[53:44] again
[53:45] it's like that statement that brother
[53:47] Branham said you know he preached one
[53:49] night on repentance two three four five
[53:52] six nights and they finally came to him
[53:54] and said you got anything else you're
[53:55] going to preach on
[53:58] he says oh yeah I got lots to preach on
[54:01] but repent first
[54:03] you know so God's word we you know we
[54:08] gotta watch that we don't
[54:10] take the age that we're living in out
[54:12] there technology everything's so quick
[54:16] the word of God got to sink in and
[54:19] that's why ministers and the Bible says
[54:21] that good preaching is repeated
[54:24] preaching repeat yourself over and over
[54:28] because no matter how many times you
[54:30] hear it until it sinks in and God knows
[54:34] God knows if it sinks in or not God
[54:37] knows when that that mental Faith
[54:39] becomes our reality a real Faith a
[54:42] manifestation in your life
[54:45] you know I one night I I was just
[54:47] thinking about this I said you know what
[54:48] I'm going to go on Tick Tock and I went
[54:51] on Tick Tock most of you guys know Tick
[54:53] Tock I went on Tick Tock and I I scroll
[54:55] through things that I like like uh you
[54:57] know spiritual things uh uh medical
[55:00] things and you know I just kept going
[55:02] through Tick Tock one after and I ran
[55:05] into a lot of good information and I was
[55:08] going over it I went for three hours on
[55:10] Tick Tock going through and reading all
[55:13] kinds of stuff and later on I I lied
[55:16] down on the bed there and I was trying
[55:18] to think of all the great things that I
[55:21] was that I went that I read and I went
[55:23] over you know I couldn't think of
[55:25] anything
[55:26] nothing sunk in
[55:29] nothing became a reality though there
[55:32] was a lot of good things because I was
[55:34] going over and over and over and over
[55:36] and that's what we want we want one
[55:38] message this week and another one and
[55:40] another one and another one and
[55:42] something new new and we realized
[55:44] sometimes that we pass over things
[55:47] and it doesn't sink in God wants his
[55:50] word to sink in
[55:53] amen he wants it to become a reality in
[55:56] our lives and become real to us
[56:00] amen
[56:03] perfect strength and perfect weakness is
[56:06] a paradox
[56:08] and God is a paradox
[56:10] you we look through the word and we see
[56:12] a lot of things that are Paradox what is
[56:15] a paradox
[56:17] something that is true
[56:19] but we don't understand we can't figure
[56:21] it out
[56:22] and there's a lot about God that we
[56:24] can't figure out
[56:26] and I hope we find this morning
[56:28] something revealed to us that God takes
[56:32] weakness
[56:34] that you'll see in your life that God
[56:36] takes weakness and brings strength out
[56:39] of it
[56:40] he's the only one that can do it that's
[56:43] why he said I'll take all things good
[56:45] and evil and make them work for your
[56:48] good
[56:49] we can't understand that we can't
[56:52] explain that we can't figure that out
[56:54] but we believe that
[56:59] Hallelujah
[57:01] amen
[57:04] Hallelujah
[57:06] God takes weakness and makes strength
[57:08] out of it he takes human strength and
[57:11] makes weakness out of it
[57:13] oh yes
[57:15] Satan takes our strength and makes us
[57:18] weak in fear but God takes our weakness
[57:21] and gives us overcoming Power by faith
[57:24] in his word
[57:25] and he makes us more than a conqueror
[57:29] not just a conqueror but more than a
[57:31] conqueror
[57:33] not because you're strong but because
[57:35] you're weak
[57:38] oh my
[57:40] who wants to be weak
[57:42] hey
[57:44] not in reality who wants trials who
[57:47] wants temptation
[57:49] who wants Hard Times come on we all want
[57:53] hard times we all want that thorn in our
[57:56] flesh don't we
[58:00] not if you're human you don't
[58:02] Hallelujah but when you recognize the
[58:05] revelation of the word of God you
[58:07] recognize God's pattern and God's
[58:10] process amen of dealing with sons and
[58:13] daughters of God yes it's a paradox to
[58:16] human beings yes it's a paradox to your
[58:18] mind but that's the way God does it
[58:22] amen
[58:24] Hallelujah
[58:25] oh yes brothers and sisters we're highly
[58:28] favored and blessed of God
[58:31] amen
[58:32] hallelujah we're loved of the Lord
[58:35] but then again we're so frustrated we're
[58:38] so burdened we're so heavy laid in
[58:41] sometimes we're so worried about so many
[58:44] things
[58:45] but we're highly favored and blessed of
[58:47] God
[58:48] at the same time
[58:51] is it possible yes it's possible
[58:53] Hallelujah
[58:55] glory to God
[58:57] we are dealing with
[58:59] this most darkest Wicked age that we
[59:02] live in
[59:03] the spirit of this age lukewarmness lazy
[59:07] powerless
[59:08] but we need to move forward in the glory
[59:11] of his word we are living moving forward
[59:14] in a Strange Land
[59:17] this is not our home
[59:20] this is not our home
[59:23] this is a Strange Land and it's becoming
[59:27] more stranger to the individual as they
[59:30] grow in faith and as they overcome more
[59:33] and more this land is a Strange Land
[59:37] Hallelujah
[59:39] glory to God
[59:42] we are rejoicing and hungering and
[59:44] thirsting for righteousness in this
[59:46] world of total godliness
[59:50] totally blacked out
[59:54] there ain't no worshipers of God out
[59:56] there
[59:59] we understand that even denominations
[1:00:03] false teaching Worship in the devil
[1:00:06] false doctrines not worshiping the truth
[1:00:13] totally blacked out
[1:00:15] yes highly favored
[1:00:18] blessed of God but frustrated and weak
[1:00:20] at times
[1:00:21] thorn in our flesh anxiety anxiousness
[1:00:25] depression
[1:00:27] fear
[1:00:28] but singing and praising God and going
[1:00:31] through hard situations
[1:00:33] weak but confessing the power of the
[1:00:36] word of God
[1:00:38] brother Branham like Paul was caught up
[1:00:40] into the heavens and at the same time he
[1:00:43] confessed the hope his first wife that
[1:00:46] he was at the end
[1:00:48] and he wanted to commit suicide
[1:00:51] but God in his strength amen
[1:00:55] gave him faith
[1:00:58] and through his weakness
[1:01:01] think about it
[1:01:03] think about it caught up
[1:01:05] and at the same time he was caught up
[1:01:08] he was at the weakest point
[1:01:10] of his life on this Earth
[1:01:13] losing his wife
[1:01:17] at the point in time losing so many
[1:01:20] people in his life
[1:01:22] weak but we can look back and see his
[1:01:26] life how God took that life of weakness
[1:01:29] amen and produce a Ministry that swept
[1:01:34] the world with the power and
[1:01:36] demonstration of God
[1:01:39] we can't escape it my brothers and
[1:01:42] sisters
[1:01:43] we can't escape God's process
[1:01:46] amen but I'm here to tell you amen it
[1:01:49] doesn't matter what you're going through
[1:01:51] how weak you are how you're suffering
[1:01:53] this morning God if you surrender to him
[1:01:57] will take that weakness amen and bring
[1:02:00] strength out of it
[1:02:02] bring power and deliverance out of it
[1:02:05] because that's what he does
[1:02:08] not any preacher does not any great men
[1:02:11] but him and him alone
[1:02:14] Hallelujah
[1:02:16] glory to God
[1:02:19] what is the deep meaning of strength
[1:02:21] mental power or endurance
[1:02:25] such as willpower courage
[1:02:26] self-confidence
[1:02:28] self-discipline
[1:02:31] her inner strength and her deep love for
[1:02:34] God's word led her to believe
[1:02:37] and to overcome the devil's temptation
[1:02:40] the word strength is mentioned over 360
[1:02:44] times in the Bible
[1:02:47] applying both naturally and Supernatural
[1:02:50] strength
[1:02:52] the word means power strength and might
[1:02:56] in the Bible strength is often linked to
[1:02:59] God's power Believers are to be strong
[1:03:02] in the Lord and the power of His might
[1:03:06] Ephesians 6 10. the unlimited power of
[1:03:10] Christ is the source of our strength for
[1:03:13] those who belong to him
[1:03:18] Hallelujah
[1:03:20] glory to God
[1:03:23] now God even gave his strength as a gift
[1:03:27] to people
[1:03:30] as is recorded in the Bible however the
[1:03:32] Bible is also full of language about
[1:03:35] strength and weakness
[1:03:37] but let us remember there is no weakness
[1:03:41] in God
[1:03:43] only strength in his word
[1:03:47] God is strong and powerful
[1:03:52] there is no weakness in God
[1:03:55] it's God who takes weakness and brings
[1:03:59] his strength through it
[1:04:01] amen just like there's no bad in God
[1:04:04] only good in God
[1:04:06] Hallelujah
[1:04:09] amen
[1:04:11] only in Christianity does the idea exist
[1:04:15] that someone
[1:04:17] is strongest in their lowest moments
[1:04:21] when people are weak
[1:04:23] if they submit to God
[1:04:26] he can take over and use his full
[1:04:29] strength
[1:04:31] when someone is at their weakest they
[1:04:34] are the most dependable and depending on
[1:04:38] the Lord
[1:04:40] who is infinite stronger than weak
[1:04:45] sinful humans
[1:04:46] understanding this concept glorifies the
[1:04:49] sacrifice Jesus made on the cross
[1:04:52] and empowers Believers to persuade
[1:04:55] pursued their race well
[1:04:58] and bear any and all circumstances since
[1:05:03] God is bearing it with them
[1:05:05] Jesus said come unto me all ye that are
[1:05:10] heavy laden and burdened and I will give
[1:05:13] you rest
[1:05:15] rest strength I will give you strength
[1:05:19] when we rest in the Lord amen we're
[1:05:22] resting in his strength and his power
[1:05:25] and his might
[1:05:27] Hallelujah
[1:05:28] Jesus said take my yoke upon you and
[1:05:32] learn of me
[1:05:34] do you see learn
[1:05:37] learn my process learn my ways
[1:05:42] the Bible says lean not to your own
[1:05:43] understanding but acknowledge Him
[1:05:46] acknowledge his ways follow his bloody
[1:05:49] footprints follow his life example
[1:05:53] Hallelujah it'll bring more rest in your
[1:05:57] walk and more peace in your life when
[1:06:00] you recognize the things that you go
[1:06:01] through and the weaknesses that you have
[1:06:03] in your life
[1:06:05] are for God's purpose
[1:06:07] Hallelujah
[1:06:10] for I am meek and lowly in heart
[1:06:13] and you shall find rest unto your souls
[1:06:16] there's not rest again
[1:06:19] for my yoke is easy
[1:06:21] and my burden is light
[1:06:24] oh my
[1:06:26] thank you Lord
[1:06:28] starting to get hot up here
[1:06:32] amen
[1:06:34] my burden
[1:06:36] is light
[1:06:38] oh sometimes our burdens are so heavy
[1:06:42] our life is so weighed down
[1:06:46] there ain't nobody here that
[1:06:48] don't know what I'm talking about
[1:06:53] you know but there's a process there's a
[1:06:56] way
[1:06:58] we hear these things over and over Jesus
[1:07:00] said I am the way the truth the life
[1:07:03] he has a way and sometimes we don't see
[1:07:06] his way
[1:07:07] and I'm going to try this morning with
[1:07:10] all that is in me but I trust in the
[1:07:12] Holy Ghost that he shows you the way the
[1:07:15] way out
[1:07:16] the way out of your weakness
[1:07:19] Hallelujah
[1:07:21] I'm not saying that your weakness is
[1:07:22] going to go your thorn in your flesh is
[1:07:25] going to go
[1:07:28] remember Paul
[1:07:30] a prophet
[1:07:32] abundance of Revelation a prophet speaks
[1:07:35] left to ear with God
[1:07:40] we don't speak like that with God as
[1:07:43] close as prophets do for God's purpose
[1:07:46] and reason
[1:07:47] and the the life that Paul lived the
[1:07:50] surrendered and yielded life that he
[1:07:53] lived the things that produced out of
[1:07:55] his life
[1:07:56] that we can read in the scriptures and
[1:07:59] how God can use him and how God used him
[1:08:04] it only could have happened
[1:08:06] if that thorn was in his flesh
[1:08:10] it kept him humble you read it this
[1:08:13] morning
[1:08:14] it kept them submissive it kept them in
[1:08:17] line
[1:08:19] with the word of God
[1:08:22] Hallelujah
[1:08:24] what a life
[1:08:27] brother Branham speaking here
[1:08:30] and if you really wanna
[1:08:32] really take in
[1:08:34] and really absorb
[1:08:36] this message this morning
[1:08:38] listen
[1:08:40] to perfect faith and perfect weakness by
[1:08:43] Brother Branham this week I'm telling
[1:08:45] you you will be blessed
[1:08:48] amen
[1:08:49] we don't believe here
[1:08:51] in the Tate Ministry
[1:08:54] and just listen to the tapes but we
[1:08:56] believe in listening to the tapes
[1:09:00] and we believe in the fivefold ministry
[1:09:03] that listens to the tapes and draws
[1:09:06] inspiration
[1:09:08] so that the Living God can have the
[1:09:10] preeminence
[1:09:13] without that he wouldn't have the
[1:09:15] preemus this morning
[1:09:17] he wouldn't be invited here
[1:09:21] Hallelujah
[1:09:23] there are so many of us
[1:09:26] like to testify or likes to think that
[1:09:29] we are insufficient
[1:09:31] and therefore we make that we make an
[1:09:35] excuse
[1:09:36] I have no education
[1:09:39] I have no ability
[1:09:41] I'm unable to do this
[1:09:44] and if you keep that up
[1:09:47] and do that in that way and keep going
[1:09:51] like that then you cannot amount to
[1:09:55] anything
[1:09:57] but the very thing that we make excuses
[1:10:01] for by our weakness
[1:10:03] God uses that very thing to tackle the
[1:10:07] job
[1:10:08] just think about it
[1:10:11] you talk about a paradox
[1:10:13] the thing that we make excuses for
[1:10:17] that we're not able to do what we need
[1:10:20] to do or overcome for the Lord or change
[1:10:23] in our lives is the very thing that God
[1:10:26] uses to tackle the situation
[1:10:30] that uses you
[1:10:32] Hallelujah
[1:10:34] can God use you
[1:10:37] yes he can brother Desmond
[1:10:40] Hallelujah
[1:10:41] glory to God
[1:10:43] amen he waits for us
[1:10:46] to get in that condition so that he can
[1:10:49] use us just think about it
[1:10:52] we take the excuses and we say well I
[1:10:55] can't do this I'm insufficient we find
[1:10:58] out just we have to be be reading that
[1:11:02] weak weakness and rejection that those
[1:11:05] people who are the weakest and the
[1:11:08] rejected by the outside world is God's
[1:11:12] Heroes
[1:11:13] that conquered in the front lines amen
[1:11:17] those who took the word of God Amen but
[1:11:22] they felt unworthy
[1:11:24] who got and get away from the human
[1:11:27] ability
[1:11:28] you got to get to a place
[1:11:31] where you can surrender your soul and
[1:11:33] life
[1:11:34] even to the housewife
[1:11:36] the farmer the mechanic the businessman
[1:11:39] whoever you are
[1:11:41] you got to surrender completely to God
[1:11:44] and know that we are nothing
[1:11:48] then let God start from there
[1:11:52] then he starts moving and working from
[1:11:55] that place
[1:11:57] not when we think we're something or we
[1:12:00] think we know something or we come from
[1:12:03] denomination or Pentecost and we think
[1:12:06] we know God let me tell you they're dead
[1:12:10] out there you come from there that's not
[1:12:13] the same God that is here
[1:12:16] that is moving and manifesting in this
[1:12:18] day that's old Manna this is fresh Manna
[1:12:22] for today
[1:12:23] I want to know the present truth and be
[1:12:26] established in the present truth I want
[1:12:28] to know the Living God and what he's
[1:12:31] doing today this moment
[1:12:35] not even last week
[1:12:40] today
[1:12:42] today's a new day
[1:12:45] Hallelujah I'm just still trying to lay
[1:12:47] a foundation here
[1:12:49] the power of Revelation to give strength
[1:12:53] Jesus said in Matthew
[1:12:55] 16 18.
[1:12:57] the power of the gates of hell
[1:13:00] will not overpower the strength of
[1:13:04] Revelation
[1:13:06] never
[1:13:10] brother Brahm said
[1:13:11] Revelation is more important
[1:13:15] to you
[1:13:16] than you even imagined
[1:13:19] this statement
[1:13:21] is more important to you in your walk
[1:13:25] than you could imagine this morning
[1:13:28] it probably went over a lot of people's
[1:13:30] heads
[1:13:31] because you heard it before
[1:13:33] right
[1:13:34] but when you apply it to your life
[1:13:37] you apply it to your situation
[1:13:40] you apply it to your weakness in your
[1:13:43] life
[1:13:44] then it becomes different when you apply
[1:13:46] the word of God that's why brother Brown
[1:13:48] says nothing will work for you unless
[1:13:51] you apply the token in this hour apply
[1:13:55] it to everything that you do in your
[1:13:57] life
[1:13:59] everything
[1:14:02] there ain't nothing in a child of God's
[1:14:05] life that is outside of God
[1:14:09] Hallelujah
[1:14:14] Jesus himself said you lack faith
[1:14:18] ah it's promised to the Seed of Abraham
[1:14:21] it's a promise
[1:14:22] to the Seed of Abraham
[1:14:25] that you will receive Faith In Due
[1:14:28] season in time
[1:14:30] listen if God is telling you to move
[1:14:32] forward if God is telling you to
[1:14:34] overcome and he's speaking that into
[1:14:36] your life he's got to give you what you
[1:14:40] have need of and the power and the faith
[1:14:43] to go forward
[1:14:46] or why would he ask you
[1:14:48] why would he be calling you
[1:14:51] to go higher and deeper in him and to
[1:14:54] overcome and keep stepping out by faith
[1:14:58] if he wasn't going to do that
[1:15:01] Hallelujah
[1:15:03] that's the God I know
[1:15:06] the Bible says that our strength
[1:15:08] is in a way that seems impossible or
[1:15:11] difficult to understand because
[1:15:13] of the
[1:15:15] containing two opposite facts
[1:15:18] or characteristics
[1:15:20] and it relates to surrender
[1:15:24] okay
[1:15:26] submit yourself
[1:15:28] then to God
[1:15:30] resist the devil
[1:15:33] ignore him
[1:15:35] don't pay him any attention
[1:15:38] remember what we said before
[1:15:41] that he can't impersonate this because
[1:15:45] he knows nothing about it he don't
[1:15:47] understand it
[1:15:48] so when he comes to you because he's the
[1:15:50] father of Lies ignore him
[1:15:54] don't listen to him
[1:15:56] Brother Brad says not how long you can
[1:15:58] make the war linger it's how fast you
[1:16:02] can stop it and cut it off in your mind
[1:16:05] and cast that doubt and that unbelief
[1:16:07] away from you
[1:16:09] amen and believe the word of God believe
[1:16:13] that you're a child of God Amen even in
[1:16:16] your weakness
[1:16:18] you're going to see this morning I Pray
[1:16:20] by God's grace
[1:16:22] that your weakness is not a curse your
[1:16:25] weakness is not a weakness it's a
[1:16:28] strength in your life
[1:16:30] it's the power of God it's the grace of
[1:16:33] God to you
[1:16:35] and when you can take it and move it in
[1:16:38] a different direction
[1:16:40] you talk about being positive amen you
[1:16:43] can take that weakness and use it just
[1:16:46] like fear everybody has fear but it's
[1:16:49] whether it controls you or it paralyzes
[1:16:51] you amen or you control it
[1:16:54] you can control it and use it for your
[1:16:58] vanish we have the power we have the
[1:17:01] word inside of us to take all things and
[1:17:04] use it for our advantage
[1:17:07] that's what God has given us
[1:17:12] you talk about the spoken word you talk
[1:17:15] about speaking the word and having
[1:17:16] things manifest
[1:17:19] oh God thanks
[1:17:22] let's
[1:17:24] look at the ABCs let's not jump to the
[1:17:27] algebra
[1:17:29] amen
[1:17:30] God knows what he said in the message
[1:17:33] God knows what he said to what the bride
[1:17:35] is going to manifest but there's a
[1:17:37] process that he has to bring through her
[1:17:39] through maturity and she's got to
[1:17:41] overcome
[1:17:42] she's got to overcome herself her
[1:17:44] weaknesses her sins and her life she's
[1:17:47] going to take the word and learn what to
[1:17:49] do with the word in her own life
[1:17:54] and sometimes those weaknesses don't go
[1:17:56] they stay there they're Thorn but you
[1:17:59] take the word and you use it
[1:18:02] and you know how to direct the word in
[1:18:04] your life
[1:18:06] to bring forth victory
[1:18:11] oh my
[1:18:13] thank you Lord
[1:18:17] we align ourselves
[1:18:19] with the strength of God
[1:18:22] through our total
[1:18:24] submission and surrender to him
[1:18:26] then we are able to withstand The Wiles
[1:18:29] of the evil one
[1:18:30] how can you do it on your own
[1:18:34] you got to be fortified by the word only
[1:18:36] the word
[1:18:37] can defeat the Devil
[1:18:42] and I'm not talking about oh I read the
[1:18:45] word I memorize the word
[1:18:47] that's not what I'm talking about
[1:18:49] becoming the word is totally different
[1:18:51] than that
[1:18:53] is when you believe that word so much
[1:18:56] I don't even got words to explain it
[1:18:58] that is a reality to you
[1:19:01] that nothing else
[1:19:03] is more real to you than that word
[1:19:06] that's being spoken to you
[1:19:09] you want nothing else in your life to
[1:19:12] live to manifest to overcome
[1:19:16] than that word
[1:19:18] so please
[1:19:20] with God's dealings with my life so
[1:19:23] please no matter what he does Joel said
[1:19:26] though he slays me
[1:19:28] still will I trust them still will I
[1:19:30] praise them because I know in the last
[1:19:33] days I'll Stand and I'll see God
[1:19:36] I know I'll be victorious
[1:19:40] Oh Glory
[1:19:43] be strong in the Lord and the power is
[1:19:45] might put on the full armor of God
[1:19:48] that you'll be able to stand against The
[1:19:50] Wiles of the devil
[1:19:52] except or yield
[1:19:55] to the superior Force
[1:19:57] or to The Authority or will of another
[1:20:01] person
[1:20:02] Jesus Christ
[1:20:04] that's where our strength comes from
[1:20:07] Hallelujah
[1:20:09] not in our own human strength
[1:20:11] our own human ability
[1:20:14] Lord Jesus help us
[1:20:17] God takes strength God takes weakness
[1:20:19] and brings strength
[1:20:21] amen the devil takes strong people in
[1:20:25] the world in the human ability and makes
[1:20:27] them weak and destroys them
[1:20:29] Hallelujah Satan feeds off the people
[1:20:33] and destroys them God lets us feed off
[1:20:36] of him the Fountain of Life
[1:20:40] to become strong in our weakness he says
[1:20:43] come unto me those who are heavy laden
[1:20:46] and burdened come my burden is light
[1:20:49] feed off of me take my yoke
[1:20:53] I went through it
[1:20:55] I went through the Garden in Gethsemane
[1:20:57] I went through the cross I suffered like
[1:21:01] no man has suffered ever before
[1:21:03] I can I can be touched by the feeling of
[1:21:07] your infirmities I can touch your pain I
[1:21:10] can touch your weakness
[1:21:14] Hallelujah
[1:21:18] amen
[1:21:21] glory to God
[1:21:24] no matter how strong we think we are
[1:21:27] in the word
[1:21:31] the flesh is weak
[1:21:35] Mark 14 38.
[1:21:39] left to our own devices
[1:21:42] we will fall into temptation and fail
[1:21:45] in every and any worthy endeavor
[1:21:50] the weakness inherited in human nature
[1:21:54] is why the Bible commands us
[1:21:58] to the strength of the Lord
[1:22:02] Christ's power is made perfect in our
[1:22:05] weakness
[1:22:06] as we learn to rely on God's strength
[1:22:09] instead of Our Own
[1:22:11] we gain New Heights
[1:22:14] we go to new heights
[1:22:16] Hallelujah
[1:22:19] God said to Paul
[1:22:21] my strength is perfect in your weakness
[1:22:25] oh my
[1:22:26] you imagine
[1:22:28] Paul approaching God
[1:22:32] you know we think
[1:22:34] and I I believe Paul probably thought
[1:22:37] all what God has done through his life
[1:22:39] and his ministry he knows the power of
[1:22:40] God
[1:22:42] he knows God is real
[1:22:44] oh yes
[1:22:48] and he thought you know I can approach
[1:22:50] God and he approached him three times
[1:22:53] he didn't get it on the first time
[1:22:55] that's the human part of us
[1:22:57] and we think sometimes my brothers and
[1:22:59] sisters that everything in our lives
[1:23:02] have to go
[1:23:04] every weakness and every thing that we
[1:23:06] we're struggling an element in our life
[1:23:09] that has to go and Paul thought the same
[1:23:11] thing
[1:23:12] that's why he approached God three times
[1:23:14] said Lord take it away from me
[1:23:17] come on I'm your servant
[1:23:20] look at the work I got to do
[1:23:23] but then he came to realize
[1:23:26] when God spoke back to him and he said
[1:23:28] Paul he could probably give Paul see we
[1:23:30] read these as words but this is a
[1:23:32] revelation that God spoke to Paul and he
[1:23:35] said Paul
[1:23:37] my strength is made perfect in your
[1:23:39] weakness
[1:23:41] for when you are weak Paul then you are
[1:23:45] strong
[1:23:46] you may not understand it
[1:23:48] but I know what I'm doing
[1:23:51] in your life and an only way that I can
[1:23:53] fulfill in your life and complete what
[1:23:56] needs to be completed in your life is
[1:23:58] that I gotta keep you weak in a certain
[1:24:01] area I got to keep that thorn there
[1:24:03] and then Paul turned around his whole
[1:24:06] Revelation he said oh I will glory in my
[1:24:09] weakness and in my infirmities
[1:24:13] I will praise God in them and Worship
[1:24:16] the Lord
[1:24:18] oh God
[1:24:20] Hallelujah
[1:24:22] this is a paradox my brothers and
[1:24:24] sisters
[1:24:26] amen
[1:24:27] don't think any human being could
[1:24:29] explain this to you is impossible
[1:24:32] well I'm just being a voice this morning
[1:24:34] but may his voice speak through your
[1:24:37] hearts speak to your life
[1:24:39] and your situation
[1:24:41] Hallelujah
[1:24:44] amen
[1:24:46] the more we forget about our education
[1:24:48] the more we forget about our
[1:24:50] denomination
[1:24:51] the more we can forget about our stuff
[1:24:57] your stuff
[1:24:59] wow
[1:25:01] I looked at that and something struck me
[1:25:04] it's just a word but he says you can
[1:25:07] forget about your stuff
[1:25:09] oh man we got a lot of stuff
[1:25:14] you might call it baggage
[1:25:16] we got a lot of baggage we got a lot of
[1:25:19] stuff in our lives
[1:25:21] amen we got a lot of things that we're
[1:25:24] we are trying to figure out in our lives
[1:25:28] we're trying to put God in order in our
[1:25:31] lives just think about it
[1:25:33] because we got a lot of stuff we got to
[1:25:35] get a lot of stuff out of our lives
[1:25:37] amen but all I know is when I came to
[1:25:41] the Lord and he called me out I had a
[1:25:44] lot of stuff in my life
[1:25:46] amen a lot of possession on my life
[1:25:50] but I didn't worry about the stuff
[1:25:54] I kept my eyes on the words that was
[1:25:57] calling me I kept believing the word
[1:25:59] that the word was more than able I
[1:26:03] wasn't looking at my weaknesses my
[1:26:04] inabilities
[1:26:06] standing here this morning
[1:26:09] a shy a guy who couldn't speak in public
[1:26:12] at all
[1:26:13] standing and speaking now
[1:26:18] because I didn't look at my stuff I
[1:26:20] looked to Jesus the author and finisher
[1:26:22] of my faith amen the one who started the
[1:26:25] work he's going to finish the work amen
[1:26:29] he said
[1:26:31] my word won't return void and my word is
[1:26:35] inside of you
[1:26:37] Hallelujah
[1:26:38] it will accomplish it will be successful
[1:26:42] no matter what weakness what's in your
[1:26:45] life
[1:26:46] Hallelujah
[1:26:49] glory to God
[1:26:52] you walk out of here this morning saying
[1:26:54] Lord let thy will be done not my will
[1:26:58] but thy will be done in my life I gotta
[1:27:00] keep my eyes on you no matter what stuff
[1:27:03] is in my life
[1:27:05] and keep pressing on
[1:27:07] keep moving forward
[1:27:09] oh
[1:27:11] Just Surrender that's all I know I
[1:27:14] didn't know anything else but surrender
[1:27:16] submit myself to God
[1:27:18] believe the truth
[1:27:20] and let him do it
[1:27:23] stop trying to figure it out
[1:27:26] stop trying to figure it out and let God
[1:27:28] take care of it he knows what he's doing
[1:27:32] he knows what he's doing
[1:27:35] Hallelujah
[1:27:37] the Bible places emphasis on God's
[1:27:40] strength and our Salvation no man in no
[1:27:44] way can save himself only God can save
[1:27:47] Paul makes this abundantly clear for us
[1:27:50] by Grace you have been saved through
[1:27:53] faith it's not of yourself it's the gift
[1:27:57] of God not by works
[1:28:00] that no man can boast
[1:28:02] that's not by our works we're not strong
[1:28:06] in our works and what we have
[1:28:07] accomplished for God
[1:28:10] we boasted him
[1:28:13] it doesn't matter what we do
[1:28:16] you can do a work for God
[1:28:18] do a thing for God and if you really
[1:28:21] know if God really worked through you
[1:28:23] amen you'll stand back and you know why
[1:28:27] brother Branham said at 55 years old
[1:28:30] one year before he left and look at his
[1:28:32] ministry he said I haven't done nothing
[1:28:35] for God
[1:28:37] he wasn't trying to be humble my
[1:28:39] brothers and sisters he just recognized
[1:28:41] that everything was done in his ministry
[1:28:43] is because somebody was doing it
[1:28:48] and that's it somebody in our life is
[1:28:51] doing it not us
[1:28:53] it's God doing it
[1:28:57] Hallelujah we can't save we can't
[1:29:00] deliver we can't heal ourselves it's him
[1:29:03] it's him that does it
[1:29:07] Hallelujah
[1:29:09] glory to God
[1:29:12] thank you Lord
[1:29:24] glory to God
[1:29:26] 's word is also clear
[1:29:30] that the awareness of our weakness
[1:29:33] need never lead to despair
[1:29:36] but finding strength
[1:29:40] actually the opposite is true when we
[1:29:43] realize our insignificance that God is a
[1:29:47] reminder to seek his supply of strength
[1:29:50] he gives power to the weak and to those
[1:29:54] who have no might he increases their
[1:29:56] strength
[1:29:57] those who emit that they are weak are
[1:30:01] though the ones who God's offers his
[1:30:04] strength to
[1:30:05] oh my listen to me my brothers and
[1:30:08] sisters
[1:30:09] you're looking up up me this morning up
[1:30:12] here this morning but something hit me
[1:30:14] back there
[1:30:16] Hallelujah
[1:30:17] that something hit me back there where I
[1:30:19] got so weak
[1:30:21] I didn't even know if I was going to
[1:30:22] come and stand up here this morning
[1:30:24] I got I don't know what it was
[1:30:27] but real Ministers of God know what it
[1:30:29] is amen I said Lord I'm preparing this
[1:30:32] message and I feel so strong preparing
[1:30:35] this message all through it and here
[1:30:38] comes half an hour before I have to step
[1:30:40] up here I'm at my weakest I don't even
[1:30:43] know my legs are shaking
[1:30:47] I'm shaking and trembling inside and I
[1:30:50] said oh God
[1:30:51] that's what he wants oh God I need you
[1:30:56] not my own abilities
[1:30:59] not what I'm thinking I need you to come
[1:31:02] Lord
[1:31:03] I realize that you are priority and when
[1:31:06] we realize in our life that God is
[1:31:09] priority
[1:31:10] he comes with strength
[1:31:15] oh my
[1:31:18] thank you Lord
[1:31:20] look in the Bible
[1:31:22] with Gideon in Judges 7 12 from 32 000
[1:31:27] to 300. God shrunk his army
[1:31:32] he says you're too strong in yourself
[1:31:34] and your human abilities
[1:31:36] it won't show my power and my grace and
[1:31:39] my ability to deliver you
[1:31:42] and defeat the enemy
[1:31:44] shrink your army
[1:31:46] low as you can go
[1:31:48] Hallelujah
[1:31:50] God said you have too many men
[1:31:52] I cannot deliver Midian into their hands
[1:31:55] or Israel or else you would boast
[1:31:58] against me think about it
[1:32:00] think about it
[1:32:02] oh my
[1:32:04] My Own Strength has saved me
[1:32:08] oh my
[1:32:09] Lord Jesus help us
[1:32:12] that's here that's here my brothers and
[1:32:14] sisters that's why you got the thorn
[1:32:16] that's why you got the weaknesses
[1:32:17] because that's the human nature
[1:32:20] me you I don't care who you are
[1:32:23] brother Branham Paul the Apostle great
[1:32:26] Apostle each and every one of us will
[1:32:29] say the same thing if we didn't have
[1:32:32] God's grace
[1:32:34] coming in our lives through weakness
[1:32:37] that we would boast in ourselves boast
[1:32:40] in our works boasting our gifts
[1:32:43] mostly what God is doing through our
[1:32:45] lives
[1:32:46] he wants to do he wants to manifest
[1:32:48] through our lives
[1:32:49] but until we are weak he doesn't get the
[1:32:53] glory man gets the glory
[1:32:57] Hallelujah
[1:32:59] amen
[1:33:02] in the end the midianites are defeated
[1:33:06] God is glorified and Israel's saved
[1:33:09] salvation came not through human
[1:33:11] strength
[1:33:13] but through the strength of the Lord
[1:33:15] God strength in the Bible
[1:33:17] is really seen in many of his Works he
[1:33:21] created the world and all that's in
[1:33:23] there by his word he parted the Red Sea
[1:33:27] he caused the sun to stand still he
[1:33:30] raised the Dead
[1:33:32] he performed many other great glorious
[1:33:34] Deeds Amen in Psalms 150 I'll praise him
[1:33:39] for the acts of his power
[1:33:41] the one who watches over Israel will
[1:33:44] never Slumber or never sleep
[1:33:47] Hallelujah because God is all power amen
[1:33:51] and he needs no rest he doesn't need to
[1:33:54] sleep amen
[1:33:56] that's the God that I want to serve amen
[1:34:00] he don't sleep or Slumber hey man he
[1:34:03] watches over everything in our lives he
[1:34:06] knows everything in our lives that's
[1:34:07] going on
[1:34:09] he knows every pain that you're going
[1:34:10] through he knows the situation and how
[1:34:14] long it's been going on for
[1:34:16] but he says my grace is sufficient for
[1:34:18] you
[1:34:19] amen my strength is made perfect in that
[1:34:23] weakness
[1:34:24] Hallelujah
[1:34:26] oh Lord
[1:34:30] look at God and how strong he is
[1:34:33] how powerful he is I can't even quote
[1:34:35] all the scriptures
[1:34:37] let's say how God is so powerful but
[1:34:40] brother Brown speaking here
[1:34:43] God and flesh
[1:34:45] how weak he became
[1:34:47] listen
[1:34:49] my God
[1:34:51] my God
[1:34:53] why has Thou forsaken me
[1:34:55] have you said that
[1:34:58] oh yes
[1:34:59] sure you have
[1:35:01] in your prayers
[1:35:06] all my bones they stare at me
[1:35:09] not one of them
[1:35:10] is broken
[1:35:13] they wag their heads and say he trusted
[1:35:15] in others
[1:35:17] he saved others
[1:35:20] himself he cannot save
[1:35:22] and all the things that the prophets
[1:35:25] have said was right there
[1:35:28] think about it right there
[1:35:31] and Jesus die and holding that word
[1:35:34] submitted himself God Emmanuel became so
[1:35:38] weak
[1:35:40] that he submitted himself to death
[1:35:44] you know
[1:35:45] we we as humans we see death all the
[1:35:47] time but you understand that statement
[1:35:50] here here's God
[1:35:52] eternal life
[1:35:54] there's no death in God
[1:35:56] there can never be death in God
[1:35:59] but he came down in flesh
[1:36:02] think about it and he submitted himself
[1:36:05] to death
[1:36:08] it's deeper
[1:36:10] than we think
[1:36:12] and to the Grave
[1:36:14] and his soul to hell
[1:36:17] think about it
[1:36:20] weakness
[1:36:23] but out of that complete surrender
[1:36:27] not my will but thy will be done
[1:36:31] oh yeah Jesus said can you remove this
[1:36:33] cup for me is it possible
[1:36:35] oh
[1:36:37] but not my will but thy will be done
[1:36:44] came forth on Easter morning
[1:36:47] winding its way to the lowest
[1:36:51] he was the highest and he became the
[1:36:53] lowest
[1:36:55] he come to the lowest people went to the
[1:36:57] lowest city
[1:36:59] and the littlest man in town had to look
[1:37:02] down on him
[1:37:04] think about it
[1:37:07] we just read these things
[1:37:11] but he came God came in flesh and he
[1:37:14] lived it
[1:37:15] he lived it
[1:37:17] and this is what we
[1:37:19] need to follow his life his bloody
[1:37:23] footprints
[1:37:25] it's the only way my brothers and
[1:37:27] sisters it's the only way to God
[1:37:31] is this way
[1:37:35] went from there to death
[1:37:38] and from death to the grave and to from
[1:37:41] the grave to hell to the lowest that
[1:37:43] could be ever got to
[1:37:45] the lowest of hell
[1:37:48] that you could think of he went to it
[1:37:50] but then
[1:37:52] from there
[1:37:53] God began to raise him up
[1:37:57] through Paradise
[1:37:59] from there to the tomb
[1:38:02] from the tomb to Glory
[1:38:05] and from Glory he went so high to the
[1:38:09] heavens that he had to look down
[1:38:13] he was exalted so high that he had to
[1:38:16] look down on upon the heavens
[1:38:18] think about it my brothers and sisters
[1:38:22] oh my
[1:38:25] exalted to his throne
[1:38:29] Hallelujah
[1:38:31] if we can only realize
[1:38:34] and recognize
[1:38:36] if we just can leave everything in God's
[1:38:38] hands
[1:38:40] we will find out that God's hands will
[1:38:43] be in everything
[1:38:45] if we can leave everything in our lives
[1:38:48] in God's hands then we'll see in our
[1:38:51] lives that everything will be in his
[1:38:54] hands
[1:38:55] amen
[1:38:57] Hallelujah
[1:38:59] oh God hallelujah
[1:39:02] amen
[1:39:05] Hallelujah
[1:39:07] Ephesians 6 10 says be strong in the
[1:39:10] Lord Paul doesn't see
[1:39:13] doesn't see to get strong it takes a lot
[1:39:17] of time
[1:39:18] to get strong
[1:39:20] but to be strong it takes no time
[1:39:23] there's a big difference
[1:39:25] but to get strong it takes time
[1:39:29] Hallelujah
[1:39:31] glory to God to be strong it takes
[1:39:34] believing having faith trust and
[1:39:37] stepping forward in the promises that he
[1:39:40] has given us
[1:39:41] I'll never leave you nor forsake you no
[1:39:45] Arrow by day or by Night shall harm you
[1:39:48] or come near to you no weapon formed
[1:39:52] against you shall prosper I'll give you
[1:39:55] power to tread on serpents and scorpions
[1:39:57] and I'll give you power over all of the
[1:40:00] enemy
[1:40:02] that's how we become strong in a minute
[1:40:05] by taking his word and believe in his
[1:40:07] word amen but it takes time to be strong
[1:40:11] it takes time to be holy it takes time
[1:40:16] for God to deal with our lives and bring
[1:40:18] it under that submission
[1:40:20] that's what it's all about my brothers
[1:40:22] and sisters it's not complicated it's
[1:40:25] not difficult difficult amen what God is
[1:40:28] doing in our lives
[1:40:30] because we can't do what he can do
[1:40:33] but he needs us to do what we need to do
[1:40:39] and that is to let go and let God and
[1:40:42] surrender into his hands
[1:40:44] Hallelujah
[1:40:46] my brothers and sisters
[1:40:49] the devil has no strength or real power
[1:40:52] has been all taken and Stripped Away
[1:40:54] From Him
[1:40:55] so your anxiety your fear your weakness
[1:40:58] all these things in your flesh
[1:41:01] he has no power over you
[1:41:03] once you have committed yourself to
[1:41:05] Jesus Christ
[1:41:06] the devil is weak and defeated
[1:41:10] God uses weakness to make us strong
[1:41:15] but the devil uses the weakness
[1:41:17] to destroy us
[1:41:19] and that's why we're saying here this
[1:41:20] morning
[1:41:21] we don't want the devil amen the
[1:41:25] understanding that Paul got when when
[1:41:27] the Lord spoke to him
[1:41:29] is that his weakness became strength to
[1:41:32] him
[1:41:34] I can imagine what Paul was thinking oh
[1:41:36] my God this sword in my flesh this devil
[1:41:40] the Bible says that Satan buffeted him
[1:41:44] what he was trying to think at that time
[1:41:46] the devil buffeted him and on his flesh
[1:41:51] and I can imagine what he was thinking
[1:41:52] in his mind over and over
[1:41:55] maybe condemnation maybe maybe some
[1:41:57] that's why he came to to that point amen
[1:42:00] where he said there is no condemnation
[1:42:02] to them that are in Christ Jesus
[1:42:05] he said I fought the good fight
[1:42:07] amen I fought it
[1:42:09] I fought the fight of faith and I
[1:42:13] finished my course
[1:42:14] Hallelujah
[1:42:18] when he recognized
[1:42:21] and he didn't give the power
[1:42:23] thus Satan has no power but if you give
[1:42:25] him the power through fear through
[1:42:27] anxiety through depression
[1:42:30] of your weakness in your body you give
[1:42:32] it over to the devil he'll use it
[1:42:34] to try to destroy you and defeat you but
[1:42:38] look at that weakness this morning
[1:42:41] and say
[1:42:42] my grace God's grace is sufficient for
[1:42:46] you
[1:42:47] because in this weakness Satan I am
[1:42:50] becoming strong in the Lord
[1:42:53] and the power of His might
[1:42:57] because of this weakness I'm pressing on
[1:42:59] because of this weakness I'm seeking
[1:43:01] God's face because of this weakness I'm
[1:43:04] praying
[1:43:05] and I'm seeking God in this hour
[1:43:08] remember this is the most lukewarm lazy
[1:43:11] powerless age ever in the religious
[1:43:14] Realm
[1:43:15] Satan trying to make the church
[1:43:16] powerless
[1:43:18] amen but God Amen is going to make his
[1:43:22] church Victorious
[1:43:25] there is going to be a bride and she's
[1:43:28] going to be perfect
[1:43:29] she's going to be walking in perfect
[1:43:30] Faith perfect realization of who she is
[1:43:35] and she's going to overcome
[1:43:37] listen if it has to fall off brother
[1:43:39] Simon said there's many here at this
[1:43:40] Revelation never leave certain
[1:43:42] Revelations never leave he says you know
[1:43:44] some things you're going to battle and
[1:43:46] struggle right right to the end and it's
[1:43:49] going to fall off with this flesh at the
[1:43:51] rapture
[1:43:52] well there's a revelation behind that my
[1:43:54] brothers and sisters as you're battling
[1:43:56] and and as you're going right to the end
[1:43:59] it doesn't have victory over you it's
[1:44:02] actually a weakness but it's losing
[1:44:04] power
[1:44:05] it's losing control over you amen the
[1:44:09] word inside of you that you're looking
[1:44:11] at and that you're feeding on Amen is
[1:44:14] gaining power and strength and it's
[1:44:17] taken this flesh it's taking that
[1:44:19] weakness and it's bringing us slowly
[1:44:21] under subjection more and more
[1:44:25] don't stop
[1:44:28] don't get discouraged
[1:44:31] don't let the devil put depression and
[1:44:33] all these things upon you
[1:44:35] because of your weakness because of your
[1:44:37] infirmities amen things that have been
[1:44:40] put on your flesh
[1:44:42] let God take it and use it for his glory
[1:44:45] and honor that strength come out of it
[1:44:47] Lord let strength come out of this I
[1:44:50] heard the word this morning Lord oh God
[1:44:53] show me show me change my mind change my
[1:44:57] thinking change everything about me in
[1:45:00] this area of my life
[1:45:01] and let me become strong Lord let me not
[1:45:05] look at this thing the same way or even
[1:45:07] look at it anymore

[1:45:28] pick up a Jawbone
[1:45:30] of a donkey and Slaughter a thousand
[1:45:32] Philistines
[1:45:34] judge 15 15.

[1:45:38] became a threat to the enemy
[1:45:41] now listen

[1:45:46] I'll tell you that
[1:45:48] we're all a threat to the enemy
[1:45:51] because of his strength
[1:45:54] his enemy knew
[1:45:56] about his moral weakness

[1:46:03] we all got something
[1:46:07] oh yeah
[1:46:09] Samson's was women

[1:46:13] because it struck me
[1:46:16] watch out Samson
[1:46:19] Wherever You Are

[1:46:25] judge 16 5 5. the Lords of the
[1:46:28] Philistines went to her
[1:46:30] and said entice him
[1:46:33] and find out his source
[1:46:35] of his great strength
[1:46:37] and how we can overpower him and tie him
[1:46:41] up and subdue him isn't that the devil
[1:46:45] huh
[1:46:47] that's what he's doing don't be ignorant
[1:46:50] of his devices

[1:47:05] amen the only way that we can overcome
[1:47:07] this and him is before to fight under
[1:47:10] the word of God the only way
[1:47:13] get outside of that word amen he has
[1:47:16] free course at you

[1:47:47] the attribute of God is inside of me
[1:47:49] that is sinless but in this flesh I got
[1:47:52] to constantly be putting it behind the
[1:47:54] cross
[1:47:55] under the blood
[1:47:59] so I can fortify myself
[1:48:01] from The Wiles of the devil
[1:48:04] and his tactus in his schemes
[1:48:08] the devil wants to bind you up and make
[1:48:10] you weak in the Lord but Jesus Christ
[1:48:12] wants to take your weakness and make you
[1:48:14] strong
[1:48:15] the liar
[1:48:17] the spirit of Delilah
[1:48:19] is still alive today
[1:48:22] Goliath said to Samson tell me
[1:48:25] The Secret of your great strength
[1:48:27] and how
[1:48:29] I can tie you up as to do you just think
[1:48:34] about that demon from the pits of hell
[1:48:36] so bold
[1:48:39] so bold
[1:48:41] tell me Samson
[1:48:43] how I can tie you up Esther to you tell
[1:48:47] me the secret of your strength
[1:48:49] that's why this thing
[1:48:51] cannot be impersonated
[1:48:54] that's why it was told in the Bible that
[1:48:56] John seal it up right at night
[1:48:59] amen Satan knows nothing about this
[1:49:03] and we keep saying it over and over the
[1:49:06] apostles were men a few words
[1:49:08] my brothers and sisters we should be
[1:49:11] people a few words when it comes to God
[1:49:14] and what God is revealing to us in our
[1:49:17] lives
[1:49:18] don't tell Delilah your secrets
[1:49:22] don't give her power over you don't go
[1:49:25] to the places she wants you to go to
[1:49:31] oh my
[1:49:35] God Samson at his weakest Point thought
[1:49:38] that it was his hair that gave him
[1:49:41] strength
[1:49:42] think about it
[1:49:45] and you probably think some of you
[1:49:46] probably thinking that too it was his
[1:49:48] hair it was it was the The Promise the
[1:49:50] Covenant of the locksmith
[1:49:54] that gave him strength and forgot that
[1:49:56] his source of strength came from the
[1:49:58] Lord
[1:50:00] it was his obedience to the word
[1:50:02] that gave him strength
[1:50:04] it's our obedience to the word
[1:50:07] it's our surrender to the word that
[1:50:09] gives us strength and Power
[1:50:15] the devil is very interested to know the
[1:50:18] secrets of your strength
[1:50:21] the devil is more interested in knowing
[1:50:23] the true Secrets behind your unwavering
[1:50:26] Faith despite your losses and hurts and
[1:50:29] failures
[1:50:31] think about it
[1:50:33] our losses are failures our unwavering
[1:50:36] faith we got people here this morning
[1:50:39] by the grace of God
[1:50:47] that have lost
[1:50:48] Lots
[1:50:52] I'm thinking about people this morning
[1:50:53] I'm thinking when I was right when I was
[1:50:55] going through this
[1:50:58] I hope you're not offended
[1:51:00] any one of yours that I mentioned
[1:51:03] but I was thinking about lives written
[1:51:06] Epistles read of all men rated here
[1:51:10] in times of great weakness
[1:51:14] strength was being produced
[1:51:16] whether they knew it or not
[1:51:18] us thinking about sister Trudy and the
[1:51:21] whole experience of her passing away
[1:51:22] with brother Mike and the family young
[1:51:25] kids
[1:51:25] and how I seen his life
[1:51:28] give me strength his life gave me
[1:51:31] strength coming up here and growing
[1:51:34] and I listen I know he was hurting I
[1:51:38] know the pain the weakness the crying
[1:51:41] out why Lord why
[1:51:46] but strength was being produced through
[1:51:49] it and that's what the church seen was
[1:51:52] the power of God's strength through that
[1:51:54] weakness
[1:51:59] brother Gabe here
[1:52:01] many losses
[1:52:04] in his life of thinking about that
[1:52:08] God put this stuff on my mind
[1:52:11] to be a witness and a testimony to us
[1:52:14] raid in our midst of God's strength
[1:52:17] that God is manifesting in our midst
[1:52:20] loss
[1:52:21] his business
[1:52:24] is his first born son David
[1:52:27] you tell them about pain you talk about
[1:52:30] hurt you talk about weakness I've seen
[1:52:32] it
[1:52:35] when I was at the funeral
[1:52:38] and I walked up to the coffin to pay my
[1:52:40] respects brother Gabe grabbed my arm I
[1:52:42] don't even know if he's conscious of it
[1:52:43] he looks at me he looks at me and he
[1:52:46] says be strong brother
[1:52:48] me be strong
[1:52:52] me be strong
[1:52:55] I thought about that later on and I
[1:52:57] started weeping and crying me be strong
[1:53:03] I wasn't standing there where he was
[1:53:05] standing
[1:53:07] but in that weakness I seen God
[1:53:11] it only could be God
[1:53:13] and here he is this morning serving God
[1:53:16] faithfully and true
[1:53:19] not just half-heartedly
[1:53:22] but heartily
[1:53:25] sister Marsha
[1:53:28] I had the opportunity after brother
[1:53:30] Daniel passed away
[1:53:34] God just led me there when she moved
[1:53:36] into a new place with her brother
[1:53:38] helping them renovate and doing things
[1:53:40] and going here and going there and I I'm
[1:53:44] seeing the hurt I've seen the pain I'm
[1:53:47] seeing the weakness in there
[1:53:50] but I also see the strength of God
[1:53:53] I couldn't do nothing I wanted to do
[1:53:56] something
[1:53:58] but you can't do nothing
[1:54:00] it's not in your power and your strength
[1:54:02] to do anything but God in his grace here
[1:54:05] she is this morning the family as she
[1:54:08] testified not too long ago
[1:54:11] raised up
[1:54:13] moving by the grace of God that's
[1:54:16] strength and weakness that's only what
[1:54:18] God can do
[1:54:21] brother Chris
[1:54:25] unbelievable brother Chris
[1:54:29] I had him at my place working
[1:54:32] you know I couldn't really afford him
[1:54:33] but I had him at my place
[1:54:36] because I just wanted him there because
[1:54:38] I know what he was going through
[1:54:42] he went to the doctors over and over
[1:54:45] and they found nothing wrong with him
[1:54:47] but he knew and our pastor
[1:54:51] which so many times he does that under
[1:54:53] the discernment said brother you're
[1:54:55] suffering from a broken heart
[1:54:57] from his wife
[1:54:59] seven years seven Church ages
[1:55:03] he had to go through
[1:55:05] before he can come out of that
[1:55:07] but he came out of it
[1:55:09] stronger than ever before blessed than
[1:55:12] ever before why because in the same way
[1:55:15] sister Frida lost her husband and God
[1:55:19] joined them together amen God healed
[1:55:22] broken hearts he healed them together
[1:55:25] now they're in eternity together they're
[1:55:28] not walking into seven Church ages
[1:55:30] they're in this Eighth Day
[1:55:34] God taking testimonies here many of you
[1:55:37] testimonies amen God taking our lives
[1:55:42] and bringing it to this place
[1:55:44] my brothers and sisters this is
[1:55:46] important this is important that we
[1:55:48] recognize the hand of God we just we
[1:55:51] just bypass other people's pains other
[1:55:54] people's sufferings and what they've
[1:55:55] gone through in their lives and just
[1:55:57] take it for granted that they're here in
[1:55:58] church but they went through a lot of
[1:56:01] suffering and pain and heartache to be
[1:56:04] here
[1:56:05] to keep walking
[1:56:08] because of the grace of God
[1:56:10] what God did for others he can do for
[1:56:13] you
[1:56:14] Amen Let Me Wind this down now
[1:56:18] yeah Satan is bewildered that you're
[1:56:20] still serving God you're still on your
[1:56:22] knees you're still praising God giving
[1:56:25] God all the glory blessed be the name of
[1:56:27] the Lord he taketh he he giveth he take
[1:56:30] it away everything blessed be his name
[1:56:34] who's greater than him
[1:56:36] who owns my life who owns your life
[1:56:39] Don't Fear the person that can destroy
[1:56:41] the body but the person that destroys
[1:56:43] the body and soul
[1:56:48] God be praised in everything
[1:56:52] and everything let him be praised
[1:56:56] because one day there's more to life is
[1:56:58] going to be over
[1:56:59] and all the things are going to be made
[1:57:01] plain before us why we went through the
[1:57:04] things we went through
[1:57:05] and the losses and the pain
[1:57:07] and you're going to see the hand of God
[1:57:09] taking you through it all

[1:57:37] in different directions
[1:57:39] final thoughts
[1:57:41] this is
[1:57:43] the weakness of life
[1:57:46] do not make us weaker
[1:57:49] with God's help
[1:57:50] we will gain strength during times of
[1:57:53] weakness
[1:57:54] God is able to transform our weaknesses
[1:57:57] and wounds
[1:57:59] into strong
[1:58:01] resilient strength
[1:58:03] God wants to transform you
[1:58:06] that's his purpose

[1:58:17] can use the power of His Spirit God can
[1:58:20] use the power of His word
[1:58:21] God wants to encourage you this morning

[1:59:03] there isn't nothing
[1:59:05] that I cannot do
