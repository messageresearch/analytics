[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] praise god
[0:16] here we are again in the presence of the
[0:19] lord
[0:20] hallelujah we've got we have
[0:23] one more river to cross and we thank god
[0:26] for the honor and privilege of serving
[0:29] him
[0:30] before we cross that great divide
[0:34] may the great holy spirit of almighty
[0:36] god
[0:37] guide us in our hearts and in our
[0:40] thoughts
[0:41] here tonight our
[0:44] topic will be from the church age series
[0:50] the law of reproduction adoption
[0:54] the law of reproduction
[0:57] our text or scripture is found in
[1:01] genesis chapter 1
[1:04] verse 11 and may god
[1:07] take this teaching and send it
[1:11] to whoever he will may it
[1:15] wing its way to wherever
[1:18] the great dove of peace
[1:21] the great holy spirit of almighty god
[1:25] will take it to who needs it
[1:29] to find a nesting place within their
[1:32] hearts
[1:33] may god bless you at this particular
[1:35] time gracious father
[1:37] as we come tonight we pray
[1:40] that this great holy spirit
[1:44] will send the fires of god and the
[1:48] anointing oil of the great holy spirit
[1:52] that father you will take this
[1:55] verse of genesis 1 11
[1:59] to give us spiritual understanding
[2:02] as you gave to the prophet of this 20th
[2:05] century
[2:06] so let the spirit of god flow and let
[2:10] the word go
[2:11] forth to quench our spiritual thirst
[2:14] for we ask it in the name of jesus
[2:17] christ as we walk through this
[2:19] wilderness of this weary land
[2:23] in jesus name we ask
[2:26] journey's mercy amen
[2:30] hallelujah genesis
[2:34] chapter 1 verse
[2:37] 11 and
[2:40] god said let
[2:44] the earth bring forth
[2:47] grass the herb
[2:51] yielding seed
[2:54] and the fruit tree yielding
[2:58] fruit after his kind
[3:02] whose seed is in itself
[3:07] upon the earth and
[3:10] it was so praise
[3:14] god hallelujah
[3:17] now this is a message
[3:20] for the church of god
[3:23] for as god's servant was in his presence
[3:27] one night the holy spirit
[3:31] spoken said pick up your pen and
[3:34] write and so he wrote
[3:38] these words
[3:41] by which we have received inspiration
[3:44] and direction by the great holy spirit
[3:49] this of course is a message
[3:52] to the last day church of the living god
[3:58] the church that is to be the bride of
[4:00] jesus christ
[4:03] because this message has to do
[4:07] with the word
[4:10] and with the bride
[4:14] as our scripture tells us
[4:17] and makes clear to us the principle
[4:20] of genesis 1 11.
[4:25] and if i might
[4:28] just bring my personal
[4:32] thought in here at this point in time
[4:36] this scripture is a blessing
[4:38] particularly to me
[4:41] because it was this scripture
[4:44] that the holy spirit used
[4:48] to open up my
[4:51] mind and heart and soul
[4:54] to the fullness of the revelation of god
[4:59] in this time and in this hour
[5:03] i was on a greyhound bus
[5:08] and being bored with the length of the
[5:11] trip
[5:12] i started to fall half asleep
[5:16] between sleep and wake and there
[5:21] i heard a voice
[5:26] every seed shall bring forth
[5:30] after its kind genesis
[5:33] 1 11 whose seed
[5:36] are you going to be mine
[5:41] or someone else's
[5:46] and i answered yours lord
[5:51] and i could feel the presence accepting
[5:54] that
[5:54] and began to die away and then i came to
[5:58] my senses realize i'm
[5:59] i'm talking to somebody that that is not
[6:03] here
[6:04] physically here but then i realized
[6:07] that was god directing me
[6:11] that you have to look directly to me
[6:14] and i will reveal to you the word
[6:18] and i will speak to you from time to
[6:20] time
[6:22] and praise god the bible
[6:25] began to open up the message began
[6:28] to open up and one thing led to another
[6:33] anyway
[6:33] i just wanted to say this scripture
[6:37] is of direct importance
[6:40] and vital importance to the true elected
[6:44] of god
[6:46] those that are of the members of this
[6:50] bride body of jesus christ
[6:54] for the law
[6:58] of reproduction as written in the bible
[7:03] is that every specie
[7:07] will remain towards the end of time
[7:11] as the same specie
[7:15] but in the course of natural
[7:18] and human events
[7:21] it will reproduce
[7:26] after its kind
[7:29] the species will not jump over to
[7:32] another species
[7:34] the pig will not become a lamb or the
[7:38] lamb become a pig
[7:40] or the lion or the tiger become
[7:43] something else
[7:45] they will remain whatever species there
[7:48] were
[7:48] from the beginning when god spoke them
[7:52] into existence god now
[7:55] from the word is bringing this principle
[7:59] and law of reproduction
[8:03] to our thoughts that according to
[8:06] genesis 1
[8:07] 11 that is the way it will remain
[8:11] from eternity to eternity every
[8:14] seed will bring forth after
[8:18] its kind and it goes on in the scripture
[8:21] to say
[8:22] whose seed is in
[8:26] itself or thank god
[8:29] for that marvelous thought that if we
[8:32] are
[8:32] elected if we are called if
[8:35] we are the bride of christ
[8:40] then we come with the
[8:43] seed of god already
[8:46] in itself in us we already
[8:50] are imbued we are ready in filled
[8:54] we are ready uh having in the center of
[8:58] our being
[8:59] the very life seed or the seed
[9:03] of life of the living god
[9:06] within us glory to his name
[9:10] and therefore as you know in the natural
[9:14] whatever seed that plant
[9:18] has originated from germinated from
[9:23] whatever seed that seed
[9:27] will produce a plant after its kind
[9:32] then as the plant moves into its
[9:35] maturity
[9:38] on their day sunshine
[9:41] whether it's s-u-n shine or
[9:44] s-o-n shine that
[9:47] plant begins to mature
[9:50] in its spiritual and natural
[9:54] growth then
[9:58] the plant will then from the springtime
[10:02] of life the summer of growth
[10:04] it will come to the fruitfulness of
[10:07] harvest
[10:08] and the fall and so
[10:13] seed life plant life and then
[10:16] fruitfulness so here we are
[10:20] going through the cycle of life
[10:25] of the seed of god in us
[10:29] the plant growing the plant life of that
[10:32] seed
[10:33] growing and beginning
[10:36] to bear the fruit so we know that
[10:40] that law applies to the
[10:43] true church of the living god
[10:47] for today that applies
[10:52] and so we can take this principle
[10:55] and apply it to god's original church
[11:01] now the first church god planted
[11:04] book of acts chapter 1 2
[11:07] you know the entire book of acts god
[11:10] planted
[11:11] an original church
[11:15] and that church bore all
[11:18] manner of spiritual fruits
[11:24] read the book of acts my friends study
[11:27] the book of
[11:28] acts be inspired by the book of acts
[11:32] uh may the things in the book of
[11:35] acts inspire you to
[11:38] act upon the word to live the word of
[11:41] god
[11:42] to reproduce the word of god for when
[11:45] we myself and my good friend
[11:48] uh brother michael patterson were just
[11:52] boys we read in the book of acts
[11:56] and believed it to be exactly true
[11:59] that it was right it was god's promise
[12:02] for this day
[12:04] and for this hour and therefore we took
[12:06] it for granted
[12:08] i'm not just saying oh we just trusted
[12:10] god we took it for granted
[12:12] that that's the way it's supposed to be
[12:16] and as we acted upon the word the word
[12:20] began to be be on fire the word began to
[12:25] explode the dunamis begins to
[12:28] strike the devil in all of his hideouts
[12:31] tidy halls foxholes
[12:33] it begins to blast him out from wherever
[12:36] he
[12:37] was hiding and we discovered a new life
[12:42] a new supernatural walk with god
[12:46] we began to discern and detect the devil
[12:50] behind the scenery apparent
[12:53] scenery of things that there
[12:56] is another realm there
[13:00] there are other dimensions and
[13:03] in these those dimensions in that other
[13:06] realm
[13:07] oh the angels dwell the
[13:10] demons dwell they oh the supernatural
[13:14] moves within that realm oh my friends
[13:18] and then god moved and
[13:22] revivals began to break out wherever we
[13:26] would go
[13:27] and the life and the ministries
[13:30] of many churches
[13:33] and of many ministers and individuals
[13:37] around the world have been impacted
[13:41] by this move and power of the holy
[13:45] spirit
[13:46] this principle of god that every
[13:49] seed shall not me
[13:53] might every seed shall
[13:57] bring forth after its kind
[14:01] then if the early church
[14:05] in its planting time of acts chapter 2
[14:09] began to produce men and women
[14:13] filled with the holy ghost anointed by
[14:17] the spirit of the living god like
[14:19] peter who stood up on the day of
[14:22] pentecost
[14:23] and said this is that spoken by the
[14:26] prophet
[14:27] joel can't you stand today
[14:30] and say this is that spoken by the
[14:34] prophet of malachi
[14:35] 4. we may not be accepted by all as that
[14:39] but that's
[14:40] what we see in the word of god and what
[14:43] god's spirit has produced
[14:45] not one time wrong not one time
[14:49] fail but the word always being
[14:52] fulfilled you may not understand it and
[14:55] you think it's failed
[14:56] or you think it's wrong but the holy
[14:59] spirit
[15:00] is used that man to
[15:03] reproduce the life of christ and the
[15:07] manifestation of the word of god for
[15:09] this day and now
[15:13] that church that seed
[15:17] church that was planted in the book of
[15:21] acts through the ages
[15:24] has grown through seven church ages
[15:29] producing the the stock the leaves
[15:34] coming up right my friends to the time
[15:37] of fruitfulness and harvest and i
[15:40] believe my friends
[15:41] this is the harvest time i believe
[15:44] we're in the harvest time oh the lord is
[15:48] calling the savior's calling glory to
[15:50] god hallelujah
[15:52] amen i feel the pull i heard a voice
[15:56] the inspiration of the holy spirit
[15:58] strikes your soul
[16:00] and calls you to walk a little closer
[16:03] than you
[16:03] then you work walking before walk a
[16:06] little deeper
[16:07] praise god and not to get used to this
[16:11] uh the darkness the lukewarmness the
[16:14] coldness the cheapening of the message
[16:17] the masking of the message my friends
[16:20] the counterfeiting
[16:21] of the word of god the imitation of it
[16:25] and not the reality of the life of
[16:28] christ
[16:29] we don't want just an imitation of
[16:31] christ but we want the pure
[16:33] life of christ flowing out of us like
[16:36] rivers of
[16:37] living waters amen praise god
[16:40] forevermore
[16:41] i believe that's why our leaves shall
[16:44] not wither
[16:45] the the leaves the what we produce our
[16:48] praise our
[16:49] worship or the fruitfulness will not
[16:52] wither
[16:53] because we got our roots planted
[16:56] amen in the ever-present water
[17:00] all in the rock amen the underground
[17:04] streams of god streams in the desert
[17:07] amen you're planted in the presence of
[17:10] god
[17:11] healing is there salvation is there joy
[17:14] is there

[17:29] drawing from this unseen source
[17:31] you're drawing from the presence of
[17:34] almighty god hallelujah
[17:36] that same church
[17:40] what else can it produce
[17:43] we look out in our day and in our time
[17:46] and we are told oh this is the church
[17:50] oh or that is the church or
[17:54] i have a different brand it is the it is
[17:57] this church and it has a different name
[17:59] and that one has
[18:00] another name and different name and each
[18:03] one let me tell you my friends
[18:06] the genuine church of the living god
[18:11] will always approximate
[18:15] with the original church
[18:18] we must live by the blueprint
[18:22] for god has given us
[18:25] the blueprint in the book of acts
[18:29] and i will build my church and the gates
[18:32] of hell shall not prevail against it
[18:34] why if that my friend seed continues
[18:39] listen do you know the first
[18:43] the oak trees we have today all
[18:45] originated
[18:46] from the original oak tree
[18:49] that came from the original seed
[18:52] that grew up in the garden of eden
[18:57] even so with the true church of the
[18:59] living god
[19:00] it should come from that original seed
[19:04] and be a pattern be a blueprint
[19:09] from that blueprint it should be the
[19:12] same
[19:13] kind of a church amen with the presence
[19:16] of god
[19:18] with the power of god with the very
[19:21] persons god had in it with the
[19:24] ministries
[19:25] fivefold that are there to
[19:29] fan out the word of god that is in his
[19:32] hand
[19:33] to thoroughly purge the floor for his
[19:36] glory and honor
[19:37] this is what god is showing us today
[19:40] from his word
[19:41] amen that same seed that study the
[19:45] church
[19:46] will come forth once again and
[19:49] be like that original
[19:52] seed church because it is from
[19:56] the same seed it is of
[19:59] the same seed hallelujah praise
[20:02] god and that's why i believe
[20:06] that this last day bright church
[20:10] will be so near to the headstone
[20:13] praise god hallelujah amen
[20:17] course you know the headstone is the
[20:19] capstone
[20:20] the hamstone is the keystone
[20:23] the headstone is the cornerstone that
[20:27] holds up the building
[20:28] and gives the entire uh things
[20:32] uh strength and structure amen
[20:35] so here it is my friends that that
[20:38] this bright church will be a
[20:42] super church let me use the word a
[20:45] supernatural church glory to god
[20:48] hallelujah
[20:49] amen and physically she's natural
[20:52] but spiritually she's super so she's a
[20:56] supernatural church a super
[20:59] race of people and new creation
[21:02] born by the seed of the holy spirit
[21:06] for the spoken word of god
[21:09] is god's seed it's god's original seed
[21:13] not a man's seed
[21:14] that would produce a natural child but
[21:17] the seed word of the living god
[21:19] will produce a true genuine
[21:23] spirit-born child of the living god
[21:26] by his supernatural birth oh we thank
[21:29] god
[21:30] for this super church this super race
[21:34] hallelujah praise god that will
[21:38] walk as close as they can
[21:42] with him until they begin to look like
[21:45] him
[21:46] they begin to act like him
[21:49] near to the headstone that same stone
[21:53] others reject
[21:54] she embraces that stone oh glory to god
[21:58] she embraces him as her lord praise
[22:02] god amen yes sir this
[22:05] she does in order that she might be
[22:07] united with him
[22:10] and recognize that she is one
[22:13] with him praise god and if
[22:16] he when he was here
[22:20] he was is the seed of god
[22:24] and he was the manifestation of the
[22:27] father
[22:28] he was the manifestation of god here on
[22:32] earth
[22:33] in a natural body in a natural form
[22:37] so will the sons and daughters of god
[22:40] be in this last day as they accept the
[22:44] word
[22:45] and as they the word of god takes them
[22:48] over
[22:49] and begins to have his governorship
[22:54] his preeminence as they
[22:57] submit and surrender in obedience
[23:01] to his lordship or praise
[23:04] god forevermore led by the holy spirit
[23:08] anointed by the holy spirit used of the
[23:11] holy spirit
[23:12] then we see another display of
[23:16] jesus christ the same yesterday
[23:19] today and forevermore manifestations
[23:23] of the living god a denomination cannot
[23:27] produce that
[23:30] for the air of a different seed
[23:33] a perverted seed
[23:36] is what forms a denomination
[23:40] the same kind of uh seed
[23:44] that produce cane where
[23:47] eve hybridized
[23:50] mongrelized the plan and purpose of
[23:54] god as i believe and teach
[23:58] by an illegitimate
[24:01] affair with the serpent
[24:05] who was not a snake for the bible tells
[24:08] us from today
[24:09] on your belly you will go amen
[24:12] praise god and many other scriptures we
[24:15] will not get into that
[24:17] but she committed adultery and
[24:20] produced an illegitimate mongrelized
[24:24] son he was a hybrid to the word of god
[24:28] and the promise of the hour and
[24:32] so has the church
[24:35] wandered away from adam the second adam
[24:38] the word
[24:40] and now by spiritual affair
[24:45] with the devil instead of producing
[24:48] 100 the pure word of god
[24:52] for every seed must bring forth after
[24:55] its kind
[24:56] what has she produced the word of god
[25:00] mixed with fundamental statements
[25:03] dogmas creeds all kinds of
[25:07] various encyclicals and so on
[25:10] she has produced something mixed with
[25:13] the word
[25:16] using their the word of god to give
[25:19] their
[25:19] sayings and their manmade creeds
[25:22] credibility
[25:23] using the word of god to give their
[25:27] own thoughts authority and believability
[25:31] oh may god help us they produce
[25:34] these creeds and dogmas and statements
[25:38] and standards mixed in with the word of
[25:41] god
[25:43] and this mongrelizing of the word
[25:47] this fornicating the word
[25:51] oh my has produced nothing
[25:54] but a hybrid product or products
[25:58] amen think of it
[26:02] the god's first son
[26:05] adam on the earth
[26:09] who was of god's spoken
[26:12] seed word god
[26:15] gave him a wife or bride
[26:19] and the purpose of that life or bride
[26:23] was for him one he was alone
[26:27] to have fellowship and then
[26:31] he was to have that fellowship which was
[26:34] god showing that he himself
[26:37] was alone and he needed to have
[26:41] fellowship that is why he was going to
[26:43] have
[26:44] a church as adam's wife came from his
[26:47] side
[26:48] his wife will come from his side and so
[26:51] those scriptures would all be fulfilled
[26:53] anyway but
[26:54] here it is praise god
[26:57] hallelujah that this wife the purpose of
[27:01] a wife
[27:02] the purpose of that bride the reason for
[27:05] her
[27:06] existence was that she and him
[27:10] would together have fellowship
[27:13] as they walked life's road together all
[27:16] praise his
[27:17] marvelous name the king and i walked
[27:20] life
[27:20] road together oh that he would love me
[27:24] a poor beggar that he would love me
[27:27] praise god
[27:28] no wonder he took me from the marrick
[27:30] play
[27:31] and put my feet in a rock to stay or to
[27:35] think that the king and i
[27:36] can walk life's road together and
[27:39] promise i will
[27:40] never never leave you to walk home alone
[27:43] oh praise
[27:44] god amen what a story of redemption
[27:48] what a love story in this bible
[27:51] this entire book is a book of redemption
[27:56] is the book of god's love for us
[27:59] is this good book of god's protection
[28:02] god's provision
[28:03] god's guidance hallelujah for his
[28:07] children
[28:08] and especially for his wife
[28:11] his wife walking down the road
[28:14] with her so isaiah 4 said
[28:18] the wife this bride was given to the
[28:22] first adam
[28:25] for fellowship for companionship
[28:29] amen and she was also given to him
[28:34] for the purpose of reproduction
[28:37] so that he could reproduce himself
[28:41] for to fulfill scripture for every
[28:45] seed shall bring forth after
[28:48] its kind oh praises marvelous name
[28:54] but adam's wife eve
[28:58] fell by sin
[29:01] by hybridization the sin
[29:04] of producing a hybrid
[29:07] product which was not of him it was not
[29:11] of the original seed
[29:13] amen and we know that cain was not
[29:16] of adam's seed it plainly tells you
[29:19] in 1st john cain who was
[29:22] of that wicked one amen
[29:26] and jesus said he was a murderer and a
[29:28] liar from the beginning
[29:31] amen praise god we won't go through all
[29:33] these scriptures where john even knows
[29:35] about it and says your generation of
[29:37] vipers
[29:38] and jesus said you you're nothing but
[29:40] your like your father the devil
[29:42] he was a liar from the beginning amen
[29:45] and cain was a liar from the beginning
[29:48] where's your brother abel i don't know
[29:50] and he very well knew that he had
[29:52] already killed him
[29:53] so he was a liar from the beginning
[29:56] and the murderer amen so a wife
[30:00] given for fellowship companionship
[30:03] and for the purpose of reproduction
[30:07] hallelujah
[30:09] amen but you see
[30:12] what has happened just like it was with
[30:14] the first adam
[30:16] before the lord jesus
[30:20] could marry the church
[30:23] the devil gets to her before him
[30:28] with all manner of roman creeds and
[30:32] all manner of dogmas and
[30:35] all manner of things in her mind and
[30:38] heart and teaching
[30:41] and so she fell
[30:44] she failed the test
[30:48] she was tested eve in the garden
[30:52] by the serpent quoting
[30:55] or preaching to her the
[30:59] word of god has not god said so and he
[31:02] quoted the word of god
[31:04] did not god say and he quoted the word
[31:06] of god satan knew the word of god and he
[31:09] knows it better
[31:11] than most theologians if not all of them
[31:14] you are going to put your puny
[31:16] human mind against a being that's been
[31:19] around over
[31:20] 6 000 years and more and try to compete
[31:24] with that
[31:25] except god help you god's spirit anoint
[31:28] you
[31:28] god's spirit inspire you god's spirit
[31:32] opens the word of god to you you are
[31:34] walking
[31:35] in ladies and darkness and you know not
[31:39] of what you speak
[31:42] so as adam's bride was tested
[31:46] by the serpent using the word of god
[31:50] so must this church
[31:53] so-called this people of this
[31:56] last day of whom you call
[32:00] out the people for his name or for his
[32:02] wife
[32:03] to take on his name and to be named
[32:06] after him
[32:07] amen praise god brother sister
[32:11] so has that church failed
[32:15] and took satan's lie way back
[32:18] out of nicaea right on
[32:21] down through the ages and god raised up
[32:25] various men who
[32:26] caught glimmers of truth stronger and
[32:28] stronger until
[32:30] this last day where
[32:33] one man was use of god to
[32:36] declare to us the accumulation
[32:41] of that truth that was building
[32:44] back through the ages to fulfill the
[32:48] word
[32:48] god spoke of that i will restore
[32:51] saith the lord the years the conquer
[32:55] pommelworm and caterpillar have eaten
[32:58] god promised it that he would restore
[33:02] back the word of god hallelujah
[33:05] amen eve had the choice to believe
[33:09] god's word and live or to doubt it
[33:14] and to doubt it is not saying oh i don't
[33:17] believe god
[33:18] just by accepting what the devil
[33:21] gave to her she had already renounced
[33:26] and she had ready disbelieved the word
[33:29] of god
[33:31] and today just to reject god's word
[33:34] and accept the serpent
[33:38] seed serpent speaking through the voice
[33:42] of some denomination
[33:45] then you have just disbelieved the word
[33:47] of god back to the bible
[33:50] back to the original word go back to it
[33:53] and let the holy spirit teach you and
[33:56] live so that you might walk in the
[33:59] footsteps
[34:00] of our savior and the footsteps
[34:03] of the apostle remember my origin my
[34:06] thought
[34:06] the original church is one seed and
[34:10] that seed must keep rip you know
[34:13] reproducing itself and it will bring
[34:15] forth after its kind
[34:17] doesn't matter how many ages aeons or
[34:20] centuries past
[34:22] the oak trees of today came from the
[34:25] seeds of the oak tree
[34:26] from the garden of eden the same
[34:30] sun that's shining today in the heavens
[34:32] it's the same sun that shannon
[34:34] adam is shining upon on us and therefore
[34:37] we must
[34:38] realize and recognize the same
[34:42] word of god that shone upon the prophets
[34:45] the apostles
[34:46] every one of them it's the same sun
[34:50] trying to shine upon you take down your
[34:53] your or your umbrellas get rid of all
[34:56] those shades
[34:57] and come into the sunlight oh praise god

[35:12] that shines upon the word and lights up
[35:16] the pages and you begin to see them
[35:19] as you have never seen them before
[35:24] thank god that little group
[35:29] of the tree true seed word of god
[35:32] is in every age from elijah
[35:36] right on to christ from christ
[35:40] right back to eternity twelve disciples
[35:45] one he at one the height of his ministry
[35:47] had
[35:48] five to eight hundred disciples
[35:50] following him
[35:52] then when he began to say i and my
[35:55] father are one
[35:57] then he when he began to say eat my
[36:00] flesh and freak my blood
[36:02] or you have no part in me you see
[36:05] they did not recognize what he was
[36:08] saying
[36:09] and they were too quick to say he's
[36:10] wrong or he's false
[36:12] or he's off or he's trying to make
[36:15] himself god
[36:16] no let the holy spirit lead
[36:19] guide and unveil the word of god
[36:22] amen so here it is friends
[36:26] that little group of the true seed of
[36:29] the word of god
[36:33] will absolutely present
[36:36] herself to the lord jesus christ as his
[36:40] beloved bride because
[36:44] she has kept herself a virgin
[36:47] to the word of god kept away
[36:50] from the teachings of man the seeds of
[36:53] man
[36:54] kept away she was not manhandled man
[36:57] used uh or anything of that nature
[37:00] but she stayed with the original pure
[37:04] word of god despite the repudiation
[37:08] the rejections oh my the calling of
[37:12] names the persecution the reproaches
[37:15] that she had to bear amen
[37:18] but thank god mary knew that she
[37:22] was carrying the christ which was a
[37:25] product of the spoken word
[37:28] seed of the living god and she did not
[37:32] care what price she had to pay what
[37:35] names they called her she knew that
[37:37] after a while
[37:39] the seed life that was in her will
[37:42] proves it prove itself
[37:44] by reproducing itself by manifesting the
[37:47] word
[37:48] hallelujah or praise god and declare
[37:52] the name of the father declare
[37:55] the mission declare the works and the
[37:59] word of the father
[38:00] hallelujah glory to god amen yes sir
[38:04] all praise god and true so we know
[38:09] that through the members of this
[38:12] bride body of god in this last day
[38:19] that the word of god will again be
[38:21] fulfilled
[38:23] as it was fulfilled through mary
[38:26] glory to god for the promised word of
[38:29] the hour
[38:30] came to mary hallelujah
[38:35] as i've said before to you the promised
[38:38] word or the pre-predestinated
[38:42] the word of god always comes
[38:45] to the prophesied or predestinated
[38:48] vessel of the hour
[38:50] and so the word had to pass her way
[38:53] the word had to come to mary and the
[38:57] word came to mary
[38:59] and when it came to mary what did it do
[39:02] it
[39:02] reproduced god himself
[39:05] that by the christ of god in her
[39:08] amen and when it was made manifest or
[39:12] came to a birth what did it do
[39:14] my friends it was the manifestation
[39:19] of the promise or the prophecy it was
[39:22] the
[39:23] manifestation of the word
[39:26] for that hour and for that day oh praise
[39:30] god
[39:30] hallelujah blessed be his holy name now
[39:33] listen
[39:34] friends while i'm speaking don't just
[39:38] pick up ears you know analyzing
[39:42] this and analyzing that just look at the
[39:45] at the stream of truth and follow
[39:49] what it is i'm trying to say don't get
[39:51] hung up on how i said it or how i
[39:53] expressed it
[39:54] but look at the truth is it the truth or
[39:58] is it not the truth
[39:59] turned upon the promise and word of god
[40:02] for the hour
[40:03] let the crown you might gain amen
[40:07] hallelujah it was an angel
[40:11] that brought the word of god to mary
[40:17] it was an angel i said
[40:20] that brought the word to mary
[40:25] then that virgin accepted the word
[40:30] spoken by the angel
[40:34] and what she brought forth
[40:37] was the word of god made manifest
[40:41] the living word of god
[40:44] now in this day the seventh angel
[40:48] of revelation chapter 10 verse 7
[40:52] who heard the voice of the mighty angel
[40:57] and declared the promises of god
[41:00] finishing of the mystery of god to us
[41:04] hallelujah and
[41:07] spoke the word to us
[41:10] to the truth those who will listen those
[41:13] who will recognize that he
[41:16] was god's servant for this
[41:20] hour never really had a
[41:23] gentile prophet but
[41:26] god gave us a gentile prophet
[41:30] in this 20th century and i believe
[41:34] his name is william marion branham
[41:40] god sending the seventh angel
[41:43] he unveiled or broke
[41:46] the seven seals
[41:50] the breaking of those seven seals
[41:56] especially of the seventh the opening up
[42:00] of the word of god
[42:04] making the secrets of god manifested
[42:09] we believe that word and by believing
[42:12] that word in our heart
[42:14] impregnated your soul with the seed word
[42:17] of the living god
[42:19] hallelujah because we accepted god's
[42:22] word
[42:23] amen hallelujah to manifest
[42:26] so that we could manifest luke 17
[42:29] 30. jesus said
[42:32] as it was in the days of noah the days
[42:35] of not
[42:36] so shall it be in that day
[42:39] when the son of man is being revealed
[42:44] not a son of man
[42:48] but the son of man not in the
[42:52] headship not in the one man jesus

[43:40] was
[43:41] in mary and the bride has the mind of
[43:44] christ
[43:46] for he she knows what he wants to do
[43:49] with the word
[43:50] hallelujah just as mary knew the
[43:54] purpose of why she had to bear jesus
[43:58] and what he was going to do saving his
[44:00] people from their sins
[44:02] she could bear the shame because she
[44:06] knew what she was carrying the message

[44:10] that she was carrying was going to
[44:13] fulfill
[44:14] scripture amen to save the people
[44:18] from their unbelief amen praise
