ways and you know we just we just rejoice when God moves and what God gives us on this you know he gives us think so he can meet the challenges of the day that we're living in that's what they've got so real for me and I'm sure it's gonna be God so real for you it's because he came to you at a time in your life when you didn't even know that even and he just did things that you just and you know he's still the same he still operates in the same way has he done to change and that's why you're here today I'm here today something here 25 years 28 30 years later and just as excited even more excited because he's a living in his mindful of your needs in he's gonna speak to your needs I bring you greetings from pastor Simon he called them I think two days ago and he was in Puerto Rico and he sent his greetings he said they're having a real wonderful time they're meeting people and just have a nice fellowship and and they're just they're just glad that they had the opportunity to be there and they just want to send their love their greetings and they're praying for us and they're very grateful I gave no wonderful [Music] he's yes these are reality Bennigan's and he speaks to us yes he inspires us he gives us faith in this topic were so discouraged that we're down that's how the people of God continue to move in this vein in the South amendment so let's not waste any more time I don't mind one who came to hear the word to receive the Word of God so we were here that sudden we had a wonderful word of God of the tip speaking from the Book of Ezekiel speaking about how we need to go deeper we go to the depths you know but sometimes fear keeps us from going to those steps because we think we're on our own we think that we gotta go there alone but that's not the way it is God is with us God has called you to go deeper into walk the poor with God intently to go beyond all your traditions so that you're fully empty you can never stop growing in Christ if you ever thought get bored you know this is all there is we need to get back on your knees got a plan that's not appropriate pops up to something think God's taking us out of here he then he's not and I'm just glad to be a part of the plea we've heard many times he's up to something I'm just glad I could be a partner so let's pray before we go to the Word of God we're going to be reading from The Book of Ezekiel and actually going to be from Ephesians chapter four first and then let's pray father Lord we just want to thank you this morning really father it's just grace that would give us this opportunity to come and be your voice this morning and all we can do is just lord allow the spirit to move us aside and just let us just completely be relying upon you this nor that is the desire of every son and daughter of a cop we want you to speak through us and you want you to hear through us we want you want your will and your mind and your purpose for this day right now what we have data for so that we can leader year encouraged and ready to meet whatever challenges before us granted father remember our past courtesies on with his wife on rest you know type of vacation Lord liberate them and give them freedom and liberty and peace and a great rest and bring them safely we place them into your hands wherever they may be across the oceans Lord be with them watch over them we love we appreciate them if you love appreciate you giving you all the praise Jesus today we're going to be speaking to you from the book of Ephesians and then we're also going to be looking at the book if you seek you will let's read the first virtue okay so we're speaking out the series we're gonna continue in a series that we started many years ago calling the resurrection today's title is owned to his born from Ephesians chapter 4 verse 16 it says from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make an increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love the Lord has blessed so today we're looking at how it is that this body of price is now coming together that there is a season where each and every one of us are going to have to join together into the body of Christ and make up and finalize that bride so that she can fulfill the part of the word that she is Ephesians chapter 4 talks about how the whole body is fiddly joined together every one of us has a part there's a boat coming to his boat and that's that's you know we're going to be looking at that we do tcpo but we need to realize as the background you know to make it a background here what we're going to be looking at is that each and every one of us has a part each and every one of us must come into our positions each and every one of us must realize the hour that we're living in and the purpose that it is that God has called us this is the alley where each part of the body of Christ comes together every one of us must come to our position must recognize that we are important in the body of Jesus Christ that we are important in the fulfillment of God's plan in order to produce the rapture of the church this is what we've been taught to do this is the part that we are fulfilling when we look into the Word of God we should be seeing the the revealed Word for this hour which is to bring you into perfect faith to bring you into a place where you can be a part of the body that edifies the body of Jesus Christ but you're just not a church member that you're not just coming till you know to join the church and say well I belong to a church and that's enough to take me in the rapture it's not enough you must be back to be operating in the body of Jesus Christ under a revelation of a perfect faith that God is giving you an anointing to fulfill you we must together we must bow to this boat goddess deciding this church has placed this church here in Burlington for a purpose yes it just placed this church here just for the sake of another Church on the corner if that was the case we'd be filled with people this place would be loaded we have people all across the back there if we were if we were operating under the the the kind of 19mm and the the atmospheres that the church is up there producing we can fill this place but that's not the kind of [Music] history because we want to know what time we're in we want to get to where we are and sometimes we need to review you know the purpose of the Old Testament and what it was that God was showing throughout the whole Old Testament and so we're going to just a really brief quick review I came across this PowerPoint presentation here I've modified it you know because you know when we receive inspiration we started looking in in every area to try to find what what it is that God wants us to bring forth and us as sons and daughters of God above this message I want you to realize you probably already realized but when you come across something when you read anything to do with the Word of God or you come you know I'm looking for certain you know history or or arguably some research everything filters through the word for this day everything you know all of a sudden you start to see things in you know they're not seeing these things but it's because you've been given the Spirit of God at the revelation around with this data for this hour and that's what gives you the ability to know the difference right and so when we look at this here this was a beautiful illustration of the Old Testament you know it starts showing about the three flood and you know four thousand years the darker beaten you know we can see the history in the time this is about four thousand years before and then we see the post flood you know in the days of Noah and then we see the calling of Abraham the patriarch him who died given the faith [Music] [Music] and he starts to speak about your life that tells you things we can't stick out too much of this we're just going to look at the history go quick and then the time of the Exodus and the type of baggage and how Israel now everything you're looking at here I want you to recognize that this is all about Israel this is all about God's chosen people they are all a type of the private Jesus president you can see seasons of your old life man in every one of these seasons on the air you should be able to see times in your life where you are under bondage and some of you might still be able bondage and the trust in the words delivery amen because that's what the word has come to do it comes remember us wherever we are to whatever condition we might be in and then we look here and we see that it moves on to the west - experience how many have no business experiences you probably out there once a week because there's times when you're tired there's a replica here that we need to recognize that we're where we were human but also sons and daughters well it's a paradox sometimes if listen what I clap you to say things the right way I don't see things the way that I should be seeing I see [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's a concrete and then the time of judges and then the time of the United Kingdom's and then the time of there's divisions you know this is all talking about tear changes this is all talking about churches the stages all the kings of the you know that they begin to already unite the number of a sudden they separate you got churches had come together you got churches that build up you got churches that split you got all kinds of situations but these are all parts of growing into the perfect that's so that God is prepared stand-alones you thought you might be like - now you gotta be alone and then sometimes you get your hands are tired there's not much you can do the circumstances every time what you can do but don't worry father's coming out to see me because there's also attack restoration worried about so now that we've entered into the time of the prophets we know that God doesn't do nothing unless he reveals that the servants the prophets and so we realize that the time that we're living then we see that whenever God did anything he did it by the word of a cop he oh through the word of the Prophet I thank God that we've received the Prophet for our business right there twelve O'Clock how close our sakes what are we where we're we're right one minute to midnight happy we're 30 seconds to dinner I'm not sure I know that we're right there copy men because it takes a message it takes a message is every time that message comes what does it say revenge you know that's the same message mmm God does never change it's always the same message no matter where your condition no matter where you are today whatever your situation however then fee that you might feel or however contempt you might be feeling or whatever it is that you've got that situation in your life God just says we've had these just turn away from it everything can change right from this woman at 12 o'clock today you can leave this place from this moment to be differently to be strong you can be encouraged yeah you can be you can be courageous yes there's nothing between you and God listen you know if you're hearing my voice today the voice of God he's not telling you he's restoring you or positionally placing you into the body of Jesus Christ to fulfill the Word of God for this day in this hour and to fulfill his purpose and his plan because of something good that you did right he says no it's because I've spoken because I've spoken I will perform in your life Damon he's overriding your condition today he's overriding their weaknesses today he's not looking at your condition brother he's not looking at the fact that you might be sick he needs you [Music] and he says here in the fifth [Music] [Music] [Music] he says the fifth day per month which was the fifth year the King Jay Hawkins captivity the word Jehovah he expressly to Ezekiel you know that God but he needs to do something he goes direct if he needs to use you to serve you know he will speak to you they will show me the energy haria the priest the son of Busey the child needs by the river eight more and the hand Jehovah was there a partner in Ezekiel 37 wonder 14 we're looking at three things we're looking at the vision that was conveyed to us personally [Music] because there's you gotta see these three happen to these three parts and you've got to be willing to submit to it because that's you know creepy mysteries here or trying to make this difficult just literally just receive it I can apply [Music] because we see that weed knowledge and that you believe from the Word of God and salvation was upon me and he in the spiritual and set me down in the midst of the valley and it was full bones and he caused me to pass by that roundabout and behold there were very many in the open valleys roll they were very dry you know States we're living in a time of the season where there are so many churches there's there's thousands and thousands of churches but within those churches equal when it's very dry [Music] religious light using the word of God as a cloak as a as a clothing but they're not willing to be fully exposed by the Spirit of God it continues we've got this trick to drive numerous good-for-nothing death Leitrim valiant I post all kinds of there all kinds situations around our lives this is what it looks like people thinking that they're that they're alive that they're gathering together in them and that things are just fine and you know they can throw some money into the basket and they can leave you know they can think you know given our time here there oh I did [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for me he can change their lives he says and [Music] [Music] [Music] into it was the save the Lord it was God speaking it's God telling us that he wants to he wants to bring the light into our lives he once said he wants to raise you up into your positions he wants to particularly place you we heard that there be position unto the doctrine we've been called over being positioned where were Lully were maturing were we're coming into a place where God can use a second they see news upon you and will break up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put practablity shout and he shall know that i am the lord so much in the scripture states the command was obeyed by the prophet he just recognized that he just don't paid the word of god is it possible he did say well i'm not good enough you start to question dr. you start to wonder if God is really gonna do it God is gonna do it he said I have spoken notice the results so I prophesied so I did what God showed me that I should do a baby alright I accepted his word and what he said about me and they said that I could achieve by his grace and I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold the shaky and the bones came together bone to this book you see when you walk with God when you you know you connect the Ministry you allow God to use you in the ministry to do that little simple part that God is giving you that God has placed you you know they listen we were just talking simple things you do want to recognize body simplicity when you're giving you your position when you do what God is asking you to do and you just obey the Lord you're not trying to fit a Bible into adela because you're gonna have something that's distorted you're gonna have some kind of a perverted thing when you try to take and put yourself somewhere try to make yourself something God knows your position God knows your feet God knows your ability yeah listen to brother Brendan says like you seek you said there was a body full of dry bones he said can easily he said that Phyllis so he said prophesy to the dry bones and when the bones come together there was a rattling and the shaky and the love books and sometimes there's the authors there's a lot of rattling and shaking in our lives and there's a lot of noise and situations and circumstances and trials and fiery trials all joy that you get tried that you get put through the fire because God is preparing you guys mostly because shaping you because he wants to do something he wants to push he wants you to live you can't hold your breath you need breath and if you are a son or a daughter of God you don't need just natural you need there's a there's a season at the time where the Word of God has been prophesied the Word of God that's now in the pride that's why this series is about calling the resurrection our part in the Word of God we are important without us there later they're watching but right now they're saying yes brother Danny let them know about this remind them how important they are to be perfected in this problem because we've got one beautiful honeymoon three half years I said let's go to church let's feed on the Word of God let's let's pray warned us our lives or that's let's you know a tree or our children or us let's do those things because you know that what you do those things peace comes and rest comes to know that rest is what vacation is all about people want the occasion because they'd be arrested are the two more vacation without faith you're not gonna get arrested you're not going to get the kind of rest that you need as a survivor of God and so so so we kind of recognize that God is working things out in our lives and allowing us to go through these situations so that he can put blank and my sister brother practices and when the balls come to get us run around and shaking lotta noise but then when the skin come on them the meat come on them there wasn't much noise you see we can get so perfectly dressed we can help along here we can have two nice suits we can have the nice put on the slide and still have no breath [Music] [Music] because he wants to be something that goes beyond this world and you move it into that fight my faith and my maturity in the Word of God and he says so it's not a matter just be dressed right looking right it's about having the life of Christ in you and you willing to do what it takes you're willing to sacrifice and do what it takes so that you can receive His blessing his life and he says he says the meat come on that there wasn't much much he said prophesied spirit now see I think that's what's going on now itself work being prophesied to these bolts and now there's a shaky border there's there's old snow that are starting to raise up because people are starting to recognize that God is God watching God needs you listen was in a terrible condition they were amassing all kinds of circumstances they think that there was no way that they can ever serve God again but it didn't matter because God said I'm sending the word that's what he's done today he sent his word if he could have done anything better he would have done if they send us his word and amen and he says here he says both the Cates cuffed in silence broken bones we'd fit together all these things were taking place when he spoke and all of a sudden these bubbles started to rise up let's just start just do what you can maybe you feel that I've been through it enough maybe I need to just be able get things do it again don't worry you know it's like it's like when you do an exercise for a long time and then you go to stretch it you feel the pain goes you know it's like you know because you haven't done an exercise it haven't been exercising your faith you've been kind of sitting still for a long time and you know you're not moving forward in your walk you're feeling like a little bit you know skeptic in a lot of areas of your walk over and when I we help all the seniors in the flash came upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them you see because they do that sometimes you need to see there's something in the book so you because the pun your plan and when I build all the simians there was both president st. his tendons muscular power you see energy starts to come to the body when God starts to add little by little he starts to give you strength to overcome stress they give you faith to keep pressing on cold with nobody looked at that he looks here he says Ezekiel 37 mattresses that said he had to be beside unto wind because the Spirit of God is moving in the land he's moving all over the place and this is the hour where we are catching his winding his and this is where the pride starts to receive in such a way that she knows how to apply the Word of God she starts to realize that she's got a part that she's got something to say that the son of man had saved the women that saith the Lord God come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they did that so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet of exceedingly great God is raising her me demon God is wanting you to be in that earth goddess giving us a kind of think that we need to overcome it to beat the enemy because when the breath comes in when the word of life comes in it strengthens you it gives you strength the community thank you if you have those experiences where your situations we just about changing around you and then all of a sudden didn't do a heck of a lot you were praying you will yield of yourself you would keep in your world because sometimes we speak things and make things worse by the things that we say you see that's wisdom with little birds that's word sometimes can go a long way and things start to change around your life you see these are seasons in our walk but we come to realize and that God is preparing us to be here be people humans it will bind this up like Ezekiel 37 these dry bones program says the valley full of dry bones Ezekiel saw their return I said after two days after two days he would return to them he will receive us and give us and revive us I'll continue to read because something says Detroit holds the valley of dry bones Ezekiel cite their return again that notice Jose has said after two days after two days he would return to them he will reply to us and give us revive us never revive doesn't mean resurrection revived there is the same word used everywhere else I just looked it up means a revival some of us need some personal revival some of us need to be you know encouraged by the Word of God and revived out of our conditions in our situations he says he will revive us after two days that would be in the third day he will revive us again after he scattered us and blinded us and taught us you know the Jews were blinded for the very purpose that we could have sight they were torn apart scattered as a nation rejected their Messiah that we wait to see the decide and there might be a people talk about of the Gentiles for his namesake amen glory to God so what started that people started coming into their positions that's what we're looking forward to here we're looking to see everybody come into their place coming into their positions both of them coming to this mode ever find encouraging building up giving you time giving your backwards giving them your finances and your tight giving your offerings of the house Lord these are the simple things that God is looking for us to do in order to build up and to strengthen this particular house that he's given us hey my third we have seen the vision the valium tribe owns the me and they said them to be son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel look at that this is the bride we are the people we need to recognize that we are peculiar people that we are we are the ones that God is using in this pain in this hour is there any question people hope they say our bones are dried and their hope is lost we have cut off from our parts a lot of people get discouraged times of discouragement not realizing that that it's because you've been walking in other directions you're not blocking with talk how can we understand this vision unless we understand where the children of Israel are a type of the pride how can you know what God wants you to do unless you know where you are the condition you know this is simple stuff but we need to be reminded of our conditions and not stay in those conditions be willing to move out and go deeper with God and to press hidden and then to go beyond our regular routines because you know such a way that he's a creature happen to need to break some habits you need to break so those dirty half to make the brakes of those habits of giving you away from God you know constantly got to come to the house the Lord get away from those habits and pull you away from prayer [Music]
