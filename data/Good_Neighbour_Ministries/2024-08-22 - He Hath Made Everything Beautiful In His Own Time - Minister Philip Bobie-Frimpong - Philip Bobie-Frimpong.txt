and his wife welcome back from Germany egy to welcome back amen without wasting my time can you please pray for the service open prayer fathered OPP our hearts gives us OPP to lay ourselves you bless bless surr ccum situations we're all de we're all facing word amen okay so we're going to go to our scriptures right now I have like three scriptures okay first one is ecclesiastic 3 verse 1 to 11 second Peter 2:17 21 in Revelation 19:7 in Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes there are 31 said to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose Under the Sun a time to be born again a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to plug um up that which is planted A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to reap and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to read and a time to s a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of Peace what prophet had it that WTH in a in that wherein he labored I have seen the travel which God had given to the sons of men to be excised in it and my topic going to be he had made everything beautiful in his own time also he had set the wealth in their heart so that no man can find out the work that God make it from the beginning to end and then the scripture that you used last we second Peter 2:17 to 21 this oh sorry second Peter 1 sorry second Peter 1 2 Peter 1 17-21 for he received from God the Father honor and Glory where there came such a voice to him from excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we had when we were with him in the holy month we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where unto we do well that he take heat as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day St arise in your hearts knowing this pH that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost amen and Revelation 197 the marriage supper of the Lamb has come let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage lamb marriage of the lamp is come and his wife had made herself ready Heavenly Father may you bless the reading of your word in Jesus name amen please be seated so like the last Sunday we spoke we talk about um we talk about um the bra the bride had a part to play talk about marriage and also the interpretation of the world the reason why we call the prophet and everything how the marriage has come and his wife had made her ready just a little bit recap and the bride has a part to play but the scripture say everywhere that you put your footsteps God has given to you so fo step self mean possession so the the wife had made herself ready and today we're going to add it and talk about God makes all things beautiful in his own time and you're going to we express more on time because as you read in that scripture he said there is a time there's a time for every purpose under the heaven there's a time for everything so if you miss the time you miss everything like imagine somebody is sick to death in your family or your husband your wife or whatever and then instead of um crying and praying for God to heal the person or the person's death and then you are enjoying and having somebody going to say he here because that's not time for that and when there's a time for happiness if you begin to mourn you're going to be out of work so is also the God's word you have to know what time you are living in and B talk about syon that the musicians who know the music very well the composer when they playing the drums and everything they know Junctions of time where they have to make changes so if if there's a junction of time to make change and that composer does not make the change the music will go out of work so you have to know which time to change which Junction to make that changes and I'm going to just read this to kind of cap up what I'm trying to say here and then um I will um express it more okay so we have to know which Johnson that they has to make the change so if they don't know what Junction to make the change everything will go on chaos even though the average person who doesn't know music might not understand but the composers and those how there they really understand that this person is not moving with the Beat of the Music so is the word of God in Shalom he said that now they had a sheet in their hand but what do they do they were trying to paragraph 199 they trying to they trying to look back to a bit that had in Shalom um paragraph 199 to 200 they were trying to look back to a bit that had all portion had already been played out that's what the churches do today they look back see what part Luther played they Lutheran D they don't know the change of Music they don't know what God is doing today when he does these things the Lans the Pentecost say oh we got it you got a sheet that played out 50 years ago see certainly let's just keep his word in our hands and watch when the changes come then you know what we are doing now begin with him at the cross repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the music the direction see his word the holy ghost that manifest the word then follow through with the rhythm of the word wherever the music beats for that hour beat with it so what other is trying to say that there's a change as he said somewhere that it's easy when you building a wall everybody can build but when it comes to making a corner not everybody can make that corner it take a a full brick H the the one who knows what he's doing to make that corner so there's a change and people don't want a change and every time there's a change change some people as our Pastor said before they have their mind made up they want to stay where they are it doesn't matter what you tell them their mind is made up they won't even look into it to see if it's truth or not and they stay put because they don't want a change and if you don't recognize the change you be living here in the 21st century when you have computers and everything is they're going to believeing stone age in your time and it's not going to work so the message that was fall in the time of Luther was good but it's not going to work when Wesley came on the scene and it was good when Wesley was on the scene but it wasn't going to work in the time of Pentecost because that time was what the restoration of the gift and the word for Pentecost was good but we moving to another age God sent us a Vindicated Prophet to fill Malachi 4:5 Revelation 10:7 OS 3:7 all those scriptures has been fulfilled to the thought and in h spoken words the original word the prophet said that Malachi 456 is been fulfilled has been fulfilled that mean we are the manifestation of that scripture that fulfilled so we are not going to fulfill that portion again he has fulfilled it he has has come and done his part God has used him mightly never happen on the face of this Earth he a prophet can see where you came from and what happened to you and all those gifts in the highest point in the third pool that came spoke Square spoke all those into existence he was like a wave sheath and God used him mightly but if you check every time the prophet of God start talking about the um scripture or something he talk about what God has done in the time in the life of Abraham bring it to Moses bring it to the Lord Jesus Christ bring it to Baby Peter Silver and Gold Have you not but what we give to in the name of Jesus rise up and then they said that they record the people has been with go with Jesus because they are ignorant and un learn it he give you all those things but he bring it back to himself what God is doing in his Ministry and if God has took that prophet of the sin then that same God who was in that Prophet is in you and in me today so you also have a part to play you also have to be able to identify what God is doing in your life now what God has done to you what God is doing in the bright time we not discounting what God did through the prophet that is good and it's still good we feeling on on that word I listen 24 hours I listen every day but what is that God doing for me I'm looking for the god of Elijah where is that God that use a prophet to raise the dead to let the lame walk let the blind see that's the God I'm worshiping in his present tense there's been a junction of time and remember he said I must decrease and he must be rise Christ must rise up type John the B and he tped himself as John the Baptist that he might decrease and Christ might be what exalted increase so all that the prophet did was introduced her to the Messiah to Christ so you can have a personal relationship with Christ like eler find their Bride for Isaac he was a his laser the voice of what came for us to hear that voice thank you Lord to have to have the communion of Christ to be part of him he amen so that word that's I used the other time said then you become not artificial name but by a reality of the Holy Spirit of Life connecting us into Christ then through the power of his resurrection we are raised from dead things of the world and setting with him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so right now we are setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen the same God that was in the prophet in you and me that's what I'm always trying to um knock it home that God didn't do H left finish only with the prophet the same God on that was in Willam bar Abraham that same God is in you and me today he's alive forever more he's a real God he's not a dead God he lives in you he lives in me amen he didn't finish with him he that used Moses you that use Elijah use Paul come on and all those things that God is here amen and God and Paul met him in a revelated in a in a revelated form when Paul was not there with him in flesh but on the way to H Damascus when he met that light that light was in the resurrected form that was revelated form that he met him and God used him mightily more than even those who who left who slept with him because without Revelation it's impossible to please God and God expect us to have the exact same Revelation the form of the word so that we can be a pleasing to him it's good to follow the word don't get me wrong we have we follow the word but we have to follow it by Revelation the prophet said that even if I tell you don't wear pants and something does not anchor in your heart that don't wear it don't go don't go and wear it because you don't know what you are doing something has to reveal your heart you have to have an understanding why you are doing it and that same God that spoke to them if it's in you he's going to make it clear to you he's going to give you understanding why you are doing this why you are doing that because he the same yesterday today and forever remember the apostles they never met one another those that wrote the Bible before the Bible was written when they began to write it they never met one another but they were say exact same thing because the same composer he the same God who was in them so it doesn't matter what year he came what year he met Isaiah what year he met was they were going to say the same thing they they can't say something different because the composer is one where can there be a confusion no it's a continuation what Luther said was right the J shall live by faith what said was right you have to live the Sanctified life the restoration of the gift was all good but God said a prophet Amen to reveal the hearts of Secret of men oh to reveal the serving SS Amen to let all those things become clear to us amen and then the bride has made herself ready hallelujah praise our God our God is awesome God he's the same yesterday today and forever the bride had made her s ready Hallelujah the wife has made herself ready is a marriage St of we going to the marriage supper of the Lamb that the marriage takes place here amen it doesn't take place over there over there there the marriage supper of the land that's where that the Rapture takes the Rapture is a process leading to what an event so once you C to your Revelation you are in it already until the final pH happen amen you are in it already the same God is said the the wife had made herself ready God is good he's the same yesterday today and forever he promised he will never leave us nor forsake us amen so we are on what we are the same God is in you and in me tonight that's why I'm always want to drum home that God didn't left one time I went to Ghana and I was talking so strong about that about the reality of God how I'm not serving a dead God you can't give me a painted picture I want the the full thing in my life let the Holy Ghost burn in Me God in my heart that rais the dead that God that do this God that do that and the devil thre a challenge while talking in that real all that I saw the church everybody was going out and the pastor told them to come if it's like here we are established the deacons will take a pray for the person and the service goes on but this boy had something for convulsion in Africa kills a lot of people rough so they bring him to the pulpit and the kid lost like five six years and like like he's like that he can't take drink water nothing even seen that in my life and then we prayed for him and the pastor there was no reaction and the whole church was looking at me I didn't understand that but I understood when I got here and then I wasn't scared something came on me strong I began to lift up the name of Jesus Christ I began to let them know that I'm not a Healer the only that the only person that heals is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a miracle working God what God has done in the past you do it but he not come the way you want but in his own time he will come he come and do things so I lift up Jesus Christ name God's name was lifted up by the way you lift Christ name up by the time you finish the boy who could not do nothing began to drink began to eat began to PR people came for me to pray for them why we lift up Jesus Christ said that sometimes God if you pray you lay your hands on the people and they get healed sometimes they look up to you but if through the preaching of the word and they get healed the the the the glory goes more to God now understood that so I'm not saying that God doesn't use us to lay our hands on the sick to get healed or no he uses when he is a sovereign God yes he is so he does whatever he wants in that time he want his name to be lifted up and when Christ name was lifted up that kid rose up and get health and move on with his life so he's on time God he may not come when you want him to be but he come right on time he makes all things beautiful in his own time so tonight I encourage you that our God is an awesome God he make all things beautiful in his own time so don't worry about anything all things work together for good to them that love God Amen and he'll do it in his own time hallelujah our god is good tonight let's give him thanks let's give him an Applause amen it's on time God hallelujah amen praise God and God keeps his word he honors every word he said Dy there's never a time that God will say something that he won't keep it you li said let every man's word be a lie yes sir but mine be the truth amen so God keep his word he keeps appointment he said let there be light and light came so the the the light is the interpretation of the word that he spoke he said a virgin shall conceived it took 800 years in his own beautiful time I I believe that when Isaiah said that there were a lot of critics in his time they said how can a virgin conceive we never heard about this maybe this man is cook is here but he said thus said the Lord and He took 200 800 years but the Virgin still conceived that word came to pass in his own time it came he made it beautiful and when that virgin came the scripture has stated very clearly how he was going to be born the place he be born everything but those people because they were always looking back Moses said this they have their own expectation they put their own private interpretation to the word and make it contrary to what this scripture has spoken and they mix a million times and they crucified him why because they were were blinded to it but there was Anna an old woman that prayed there was Simon they never miss it because Simon was looking for him to be born he said my I has seen the salvation of my Lord let your servant go and depart in peace because he was looking for that and when he came he never missed it so it depends on what you are looking for you get what you expect and if what you expecting is in this Bible and it's a revelated form then it will come to pass as our Pastor said they met him the revelated form not The Written Letter The Written Letter is good don't get me wrong we need that letter but the said the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life in one place someone was asking Braham he said oh Braham how I wish I could have visions like you I'll do everything to see visions and to do this he said no you see Visions every day when you read your Bible ask God to open your eyes of understanding and he going to make it so clear to you you see it every day you don't have to see the way he saw it but if you pray in your heart that open my eyes of understanding he going to make to you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom he open your eyes or to know the mystery of the Kingdom he gave to you amen like the hazy and Elijah he said that oh there are chariots all around there are armies and Camp around us and he was so scared he said that oh we are more than them he said how can this be all that I can see is the Chariots of soldiers and Army and only me and you how you going to survive this he said oh Lord God Open the Eyes of the young man or the young man when his eyes was open he realized that there were more than them that's the god that we are serving hallelujah amen your eyes might be closed but it's Open Eyes of My Heart when he opens your eyes you see more you see what he's doing it makes the enemy becomes like nothing to you you can give because your eyes has been open to know that God greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world amen so you are not scared of the enemy again because you know who is inside of few you know who is behind you know who his back up of you he's the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the devil cannot even do anything unless he ask permission from God and if he cannot do anything unless he give you per unless he get permission from God what are you scared why are you making this look so big you make him look so gag oh man he become so small when he said when he said boo he said also Boo Boo Boo and he became little amen that enemy will become nothing if you recognize who you are that you are a son or daughter of God and the god the OM poent God that created heaven and earth he dwells in you he lives in you nothing comes your life unless he permitted it and everything that comes to your life is for a purpose some of them is to try you sometimes is to um give you encouragement it's all for his glory and honor but you have to recognize the junction of time and what God is dealing with you if you miss that music beat you miss everything you miss his voice you are in trouble because always speak in a little small voice if you become concentrate be conscious you see him you know what the reason why some of us are not having that spiritual blessing I'm not saying that you're not a son or daughter of God you are a son of God you are a daughter of God and David said I restore unto me the joy of thy salvation the reason why some of us are not having those spiritual blessings is because sometime you spend too much time on television I'm not saying don't watch television it's good but you have to balance it we spend too much time reading our newspapers reading magazines reading a lot of things and even in this age we spend too much time on the Tik Tok on the Facebook on Instagram on this if you don't take time those things take away all your time so you don't have any quality time for the Lord how you going to get your spiritual blessings because you spend all your time and the devil knows how to make it appealing once you go to your Google page he knows what you want he bring this news he bring this he bring that he bring that he bring that and then you count yourself reading this reading that reading that reading that read that by the time you realize two 3 hours 4 hours is gone no wonder you not having that spiritual blessing but greater is he that is in you than he that's the world those good those things are good don't get me wrong I I always say that don't let them use you you use it use it when you need to use it use it wisely it's like manone everything you have you have the power to use it it's a tool do don't let that tool use you you use that tool amen for what you want you have to be conscious of yourself and you have to know like I'm weak I know this will take me this time that time that time so I have to set a boundary give myself time and check or even put alarm on me on it I real I'm going too much I can't cut it off because it will deprive you of your spiritual blessing I'm not saying you know God is an H what it doesn't matter it's good for us to read it's good for us to pray but he's a sovereign God one way from him changes everything so I'm not making a law out of this you you get what I'm trying to say he's a sovereign God and he a balance that's why I'm trying he does whatever he wants so I'm not saying that you spend time on not going to no he's God it's not according to your righteous by his grace and his grace alone but the grace have to be a boundary we have we have a boundary within that the a boundary that the church the child of God can swim once you are within that boundary of God's word you are f you can swim all around but don't go outside the boundary but the grace of God is there for us is grace and grace I'm not making this a law so don't take your mind today that this right don't do no I don't believe in that but let God lead you and guide you so that those things don't take up all your precious time that's why I'm trying to what convey over here amen hallelujah so God keeps his word he promised Abraham that um you going to have a child you're going to have a son it took 25 years a still came to pass so he keeps his word he keeps his appointment he keeps his time amen yes sir sometimes he's testing our faith like the Hebrew boys he told them he allowed them to be put in Into the Fire to the fiery furnace wow but they have faith in God so much I believe that's what the bride of Christ has that our God the first time I read that became a Christian It Strike my soul so much our God is able to deliver us but even if he chose not to we are not going to bow down to this enemy this Idol hallelujah amen that's a revelation the Son of God has tonight God is able to Deliver Us from every infirmities from everything we're going through but even if you chose not to we're still not going to bow down to the enemy we're still going to confess we going to praise going to glorify going to exalt his name amen no wonder Paul said that I rather was glory in my infirmities but it became so clear to you that your grace is sufficient for me the prophet has to have um um stomach problem every seven years but he didn't care about that he still stand on the word of God so let's stand on the word of God no matter what we are going through come on some of us we have our children we have this issue we have this problem don't worry everything going to be fine in his own time you makes all things beautiful don't let nothing bothers you he's in control amen it look chaos sometimes but God is in control he's in control of our Affairs of everything we doing amen God is able He's Able tonight to bring everything to pass some said that I'll do exceedingly abundantly more than what you can even think or imagine Hallelujah that's what God can do our God that's our God Amen he do exceedingly abundantly more than what you can even think or imagine that's the God that you are serving amen he's our God he's on time God he makes all things beautiful in his own time all things work together for good to them that love God everything will work out amen he keeps his appointment he keeps his word every promise in the book he'll keep it amen oh so your confidence has to be in the word of God it doesn't matter what the situation is bar Kofi God will bring it to pass yes as you said amen if you could raise Lazarus someone who was thinking for 4 days amen that same God is here amen he's able to deliver you from any situation you are in oh leave me let praise my God because my God is good it's an awesome God Amen our God is wonderful I'm here to worship him with all my heart with all my soul with all my mind everything within me is to praise the Lord Jesus Christ nothing else because my God is on time he's never lost a beat he's never lost a music beat how he's making son time amen Every Beat oh man every Jing of time our God is leading us oh man I love him I appreciate him with all my heart with all my mind with all my soul I worship the Lord Jesus Christ the one that the pro Prophet Brown introduced us to is the Lord Jesus Christ that's what the word of God is introducing us to Christ to have a relationship with him he's a friend more than any friend on this Earth your parents will disappoint you your children will disappoint you your your your wife your husband but God will never disappoint you he will never leave you not forsake you no matter what happen is in your midst he cares for you he loves you he's by everything it doesn't matter what happened God is good brother he is good he on time amen it's on time God hallelujah it's on time for Esther he was on time for the children of Israel when they were facing the Red Sea what kind of sea what kind of problems are you going through tonight in the midst of the Red Sea when the enemies were coming with Amy Pharaoh in his army were coming the rest he was there flowing his on time God and said these Egyptians that you see you never see them again amen he said that you are so scared but God said why cist speak and go forth so tonight you got to speak and go forth because it's the same yesterday today and forever he said that the works that I do shall you do greater than these shall you also do yes when he was here on Earth he took water turn it into wine he took bread and broke it and first 5,000 oh but when he came in the form of when he came to use a prophet he let him spoke a sarel into existence something that was not there he didn't take anything and he spoke them into existence that same God is here tonight is able to speak your needs to existence if thou can't believe oh where did where Abraham got the sheep from God spoke that sheep into existence and if God can speak that sheep into exist for Abraham and you are child of Abraham a royal Seed of Abraham tell me what God cannot bring to pass in your life you let me see here is there anything to have for the Lord nothing he BR that sheep came R when Abraham needed it most because it was life and death and Abraham was faithful to God and he was willing to kill a son but God provided a lamb from nowhere there was no love at that time anywhere but God provided it that God can provide your needs tonight oh he can than let's receive it amen believe this God Amen yes sir God is good God I love him with all my heart with all my mind with all my soul everything within is for the Lord Jesus Christ he's a jealous God he share not his glory with any human being not Elijah not Moses not Abraham nobody he's God himself no wonder he kick itan from Heaven because he wanted to share his glory to get a worship amen our worship is the Lord Jesus Christ Alone he kick him out in heaven you kick him out from your life amen hallelujah learned to bully you sometimes bullly of so long it's time you have to stand on the word of God and kick him out and tell there has no place in your mind he has no place in your thought he has no place in your home your home is for the Lord Jesus Christ he has Sanctified tell him this year belongs the Lord Jesus Christ me and my household we promise to worship God I don't care what you are doing Satan I'm not looking at their conditions I'm looking at the promise amen don't look at the conditions If Abraham had look at the condition you would not have praised God tonight I encourage you don't ever look at your condition look to the promise of God that promise will come to pass regardless amen yes sir don't let your conditions bring bring you into circumstance and be so scared to move forward let that word of God R in your heart and move forward and ride on the word of God as that as that as the man has the vision said I'm riding on it because he was trying to push it by himself the tree he did everything the POR talk about the greatest batt he did everything he couldn't move it and they heard a voice say Paul why don't you do it and write it on it and there oh I'm writing on it I'm writing on it so I'm saying that give your problems to God and let God write on it let the word of God ride on your problem Amen Let God ride on the problem let him WR on the solution amen Oh Our God is good he's on time God oh huj how great is our word God Amen praise God oh thank you Jesus amen he's the same yesterday today and forever yes and in every marriage when they do the ceremony after the ceremony doing the ceremony the woman is the name of the husband like when I married my wife she was Dana after the marriage became B because she takes the name of the husband but in this in this modern times um the women most of them the worldly people they keep their maternal their paternal names they don't take the name of the husband and anyone who does that it means that that he's not going to be subject to that man but we are married to Christ so we take the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and if we take that name then we are subject to him you obey him in the token total obedience the whole word of God entitles you to the Token so in that marriage ceremony the woman put uh the veil on the shoulder of the man that means that that man is his is her the responsibility of the woman is on the on that man he has taken full responsibility of the lady and that God has taken full responsibility of us not only have we accepted him as our savior but we accept him also as our lordship lordship means that ownership it means that God own us we are slave to the word of God one one said I'm slave to Jesus Christ whose slave are you amen so we are he owns us we have committed everything into his head to take full ownership of Our Lives amen so when that Mar takes place listen I used to be Phillip and before Christ came to my life that life of drinking smoking and everything when God came all those things died so I know going back to that life I'm a new creature in Christ am all things have passed away it's a past things when you take that man's name all your Bast old friends and girlfriends what you have no part in them it's like looking for a wife when you find a right wife you cut your eyes closed you don't see any woman again only your wife that you see you not hunting for woman again so it's a bride of Christ we have come to know this is the truth 100% yes sir so our eyes are closed only on Christ not on Mr Baptist not on our past life he has thrown that into his sea of his forgetfulness doesn't even remember them anymore yes sir is the only devil who go back and dig it back to you so when the devil tried to dig you and bring your past tell him his future his future is the lake of Hell our future is clear tell him my future is clear because he that host tomorrow host my future and if the Lord host my future then my future is clear all those things were passed it's not me I'm not that same person anymore when Christ came into my life there was a change that took place and that change is working in my life every day inside and projected outside so I'm not going back to that whole life Goodbye World more than 25 years or 30 years I have nothing part with you no sir so what I'm trying to say that your sins my sin were put into God's sea of forgetfulness you are Justified Justified means that you have never even done it Billy amen you didn't even do it in the first place because before time we were in Christ amen etern you a son or daughter of God and that tribute that you were there was a sinless bride because sin came in that's why you have time and age the Bible never talk about the age of Adam until Seth was born he said Seth was 134 years when Adam was born that means that Adam and Eve could have millions and billions of age there was not such a as a Time we tra into time because of sin disbelief that our mother Eve did but God is going to reverse his back so that tribute that part of God that Chinese peace come on that one has no sin is sinless is this flesh the same devil will come and bring sickness on you until the day of the day of Miracle pass that's his business as brother um I think brother um what's his name brother Jor Smith said he is accuser he's going to come and blame you whatever and then when you go back to prison the please also go back and put a charge on you that's his business but you have to tell him that no no I didn't do it in the first place come on I Didn't Do It in the first place amen I'm Justified I'm Washed by the blood of the lamp oh the devil has no pass in me amen I'm Justified somewhere he said that is the man whom I will not impute sin and whose iniquity is also what forgiving and the word said that if you said God has forgiven you and you purposely intentionally go and try to do it then you didn't do it something is wrong the first place but if you have that seal of God in you you don't have the desire to do those things so when you do it God forgives you in advance God he knows you're going to repent down the road and in your heart you don't want to do those things but because you are trapped in this you end up doing it but it's not your intention it's not your desire because God knows our desires he knows that we love him he knows that our desires is to worship him I desire to give him praise I desire to do his work but because we are trapped here constantly is a battle he understand it but let's press on let's give him thanks let him give you praise I going to read this to just um um close it down okay yeah it's about still about the marriage I'm still on the marriage then I'm going to close now so in The Proven
