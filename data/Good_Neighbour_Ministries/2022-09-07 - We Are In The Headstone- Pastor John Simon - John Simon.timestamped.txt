[18:46] we are saved
[18:48] to sin no more praise the Lord we thank
[18:53] God for this great uh happening that's
[18:56] taking place now the redeemed gathering
[18:59] in all those Souls
[19:02] that Daniel talked about when he looked
[19:05] and he said I saw shrones and crowns
[19:08] being cast down from the heavens
[19:11] amen praise God and God has let us be
[19:15] here as Kings and Priests to him for his
[19:18] glory and praise and honor and I trust
[19:22] that the holy spirit will bless us
[19:24] tonight as we look into the word amen
[19:27] Genesis 1 11 and we want to talk about
[19:30] uh we're in the headstone
[19:35] we're in The Headstone what a time what
[19:38] a season that we're in Praise the Lord
[19:40] being in The Headstone I believe a
[19:44] brother uh Danny will kind of update you
[19:47] on the funeral arrangements
[19:50] so that as many of us as can be there
[19:53] would be there I know it's in the middle
[19:55] of the week and people are working but
[19:57] if you can we'd love to have you there
[20:01] so the church has some representation
[20:03] and they have comfort uh surrounding
[20:06] them okay praise the name of the Lord
[20:10] um I know um sister Simon will not be
[20:13] there because suddenly
[20:16] her niece young woman passed away
[20:21] so she's just rushing on Friday which is
[20:25] her birthday but she has to leave and go
[20:28] to that funeral for that niece of hers
[20:32] up there these things just happen What
[20:34] can you do so we give God the glory and
[20:37] praise that we are here we're still
[20:39] alive we're strong we're healthy and we
[20:42] are just worshiping the Lord is that
[20:44] right
[20:45] praise the Lord amen
[20:47] as I sat in there I'm just talking a
[20:49] little as I sat in there I was just
[20:51] thinking about people's conception
[20:55] and that's the church that we were fed
[20:57] and we were taught that and that's what
[21:00] we believed that the church is
[21:04] um you know these painted buildings and
[21:08] beautiful structures and enormous crowds
[21:12] and uh stuff like that and Paul said no
[21:16] it's the spirit of just men made perfect
[21:20] that are gathering together
[21:23] because they're drawn by something
[21:26] unseen right and that's why we're
[21:29] looking to as the prophet said we are
[21:31] looking to the Unseen amen praise the
[21:34] Lord praise God but you know what it is
[21:37] once you're you've caught the Holy
[21:40] Spirit you start talking about the word
[21:42] you're breaking to Eternity and you can
[21:45] keep talking
[21:46] and that was because you want to talk
[21:49] but the word will will start coming as
[21:52] the ever-present water from the rock
[21:54] just flowing to bless and refresh and
[21:58] strengthen every heart and every life
[22:00] that's there praise God so we thank God
[22:03] for this privilege indeed we are not
[22:06] finished with the Little Acorn we have
[22:08] here
[22:09] praise God
[22:12] Genesis 1 11 if you notice I've been uh
[22:16] brother Branham was there for a month or
[22:19] two or whatever preaching on job in the
[22:23] ash pile
[22:24] it he said I don't know when I'm gonna
[22:26] get him off that Ash pile but here we
[22:30] are sitting on this scripture of Genesis
[22:33] 1 11. amen
[22:37] and God said
[22:39] let the Earth bring forth grass
[22:43] and the herb yielding seed and the fruit
[22:47] tree yielding fruit
[22:49] after his kind
[22:52] whose seed is already in itself
[22:56] right up on the Earth
[22:58] and it was so praise God hallelujah
[23:03] father we thank you for the ring of the
[23:05] word now may the great Holy Spirit who
[23:09] who is the word and wrote the word
[23:12] interpret the word and bless our hearts
[23:14] together in the name of Jesus Christ
[23:17] amen praise the Lord because God bless
[23:20] you please be seated we are not gathered
[23:22] for a religious exercise we're not
[23:25] gathered out of Duty we are not gathered
[23:28] here in any way by tradition but we are
[23:32] gathered here because we are drawn by
[23:34] the Holy Spirit
[23:36] amen uh listen to uh the great sermon of
[23:41] God and always remember when you hear Oh
[23:44] Brother Branham said this yes brother
[23:47] Branham is talking
[23:49] yeah he is the spokesman but who is back
[23:53] of that uh the voice behind The Voice
[23:58] the great Holy Spirit taking
[24:02] um as he said in uh looking to the
[24:05] Unseen when he said this is not William
[24:09] Branham speaking this little billion
[24:12] Branham has only loaned me his voice
[24:14] amen his only loan means faculties and
[24:17] things like that amen hallelujah so
[24:20] let's look to the word listen what he
[24:23] says here one night he was praying late
[24:25] he said on the spirit said pick up your
[24:27] pen and write
[24:31] and he picked up the pen
[24:34] and began to write
[24:36] he said and I have to leave I had to
[24:39] leave some of it Go amen but here I want
[24:44] to bring some of it to you
[24:47] right now he begins now here is what I'm
[24:51] trying to say to you the law of
[24:55] reproduction
[24:56] brings forth after its kind
[25:01] see we have the interpretation every
[25:03] seed after its kinds it's already there
[25:06] it's a law that God placed in his
[25:09] creation
[25:10] a law of reproduction
[25:13] that every seed will bring forth after
[25:17] its kind
[25:19] not after some other kind no matter how
[25:22] admirable how beautiful you know
[25:26] he didn't say to bring forth that kind
[25:28] bring forth after your kind the kind
[25:33] that you are
[25:34] the in these last days therefore the
[25:40] true church the Bride Comes to the half
[25:44] Stone amen when Jesus comes to The
[25:47] Headstone he doesn't know means that she
[25:49] just comes and meets The Headstone but
[25:52] she Through the Ages the church has been
[25:54] growing and now at this time when the
[25:58] last age is over she comes to that place
[26:02] and time and season when she enters into
[26:06] the headstone
[26:08] she enters the king's chamber
[26:11] uh and take that and think on him but
[26:15] she's come to that place where she is
[26:17] beginning to be sealed in right and I'm
[26:22] thinking of the astronauts not going to
[26:24] be going up to the Moon they don't just
[26:26] send up the rocket like that they've got
[26:28] to seal them in
[26:30] into a cabin where they're pressurized
[26:33] praise God brother Branham said a lot of
[26:35] them are not going to make it because
[26:37] they're not pressurized for the journey
[26:40] amen and you see that's why God tests us
[26:44] and tries us and puts us in the fire
[26:47] takes us out Hammer us a little bit put
[26:51] us back in the fire Hammer you again
[26:53] right because what he's refining you is
[26:57] pressurizing you amen for the journey so
[27:01] that the pressure you feel here is
[27:04] nothing when you pass through the upper
[27:07] atmospheres amen uh literally speaking
[27:11] praise God he said that's the that's the
[27:13] that's what's being an eagle he says
[27:16] them other words will try to follow an
[27:19] eagle up there see but they can only go
[27:23] far and then their feathers start
[27:25] falling off they bust up they they can't
[27:28] take it but they Eagle is just resting
[27:33] easy and he is just soaring on the Wind
[27:36] amen the holy spirit is not his enemy
[27:40] the Holy Spirit just takes him along
[27:42] Hallelujah Prophet said why because he
[27:46] is pressurized to be up there amen his
[27:50] pressure rise to be there praise God and
[27:53] I'm so glad we are pressurized to be
[27:56] here
[27:58] through many dangers toils and snares
[28:01] it's not just a song but we know what
[28:04] we're singing and what we're talking
[28:06] about
[28:07] through many dangers trials and snares
[28:10] we have already come
[28:13] and you know it and I know it not by my
[28:15] works but Grace is what brought us safe
[28:19] not far
[28:20] and as grace alone that will take you
[28:23] home you're not going by your Works
[28:26] you're not going by anybody telling you
[28:28] you're saved or telling you you're a
[28:30] bride or telling you you're born again
[28:32] but when the Holy Spirit strikes your
[28:35] heart and you recognize something in you
[28:38] has changed you know who you are and
[28:41] what you raise up for praise be to God
[28:43] hallelujah you see that church comes to
[28:48] The Headstone that bride will be the
[28:53] Super Church
[28:55] oh my when you think of Superman you
[28:58] think of a man with muscles looks Mighty
[29:01] and you come to the real super Church
[29:04] this looks like nothing
[29:06] is that right brother Brandon said look
[29:09] how they're thinking this they are
[29:11] thinking that Samson was a big muscle
[29:14] guided wrestled with the lion put his
[29:18] hands on those posts and he says now if
[29:21] it was like that it wouldn't look that
[29:23] Supernatural to the people
[29:26] right he says but he was a little guy
[29:29] right just like Jesus was just a little
[29:32] guy but here's a little guy he's not
[29:35] supposed to maybe even beat a wolf much
[29:38] less to come up with a lion and here the
[29:42] spirit of God Came Upon him
[29:45] and the Bible said he tore that lion to
[29:48] apart amen destroyed it and anybody
[29:52] would realize no man can do that it's
[29:55] got to be God
[29:57] amen it's got to be God did that
[30:00] Hallelujah so that's the same principle
[30:03] I'm talking about when it comes to the
[30:05] end the little flock
[30:07] the little group and I don't mean just
[30:10] this group what we are experiencing no
[30:15] doubt somewhere in the world somebody a
[30:19] person or persons elsewhere not just
[30:22] caught brother branham's message but uh
[30:26] they've caught the Revelation the
[30:29] internal part of that message and
[30:33] they're locked in the pyramid they're
[30:35] locked into that wonderful place in The
[30:38] Headstone praise God there's no nothing
[30:41] else but the word whether Brandon said
[30:44] that the veil shut behind them they
[30:48] brought through the sun barrier they
[30:50] can't hear sounds from outside no
[30:53] screaming calling no noise nothing else
[30:56] because what the veil shuts it out the
[31:00] word shuts it all out amen praise God he
[31:04] says look they may look up and all they
[31:07] can see the clouds spicing and
[31:09] everything else the weather and
[31:11] everything else but when they get into
[31:13] that holy of holies when they get in
[31:16] that headstone everything around them is
[31:19] shutting with God
[31:21] amen hallelujah oh but they don't look
[31:25] different they don't behave different
[31:27] there's nothing different you see it's
[31:30] not the man outside that changes
[31:33] this is the person inside
[31:35] it's that man begins to recognize who he
[31:39] really is
[31:40] and when he comes through with all his
[31:41] faults failures and stumblings he knows
[31:44] what is going on it's a battle being
[31:46] fought all the time between the Flesh
[31:48] and the spirit that's changed on the
[31:51] inside amen but thank God listen just
[31:54] that that super Church
[31:57] a super race
[32:00] as they near The Headstone praise God
[32:05] now he was talking back there about them
[32:08] coming up to this that we have now that
[32:12] they were coming nearing to that that
[32:15] stone but I'm saying to you
[32:17] who have caught the Revelation that we
[32:21] are now in the headstone
[32:23] we are waiting amen for the total
[32:27] liftoff
[32:28] to go out of here by the grace of God
[32:32] hallelujah amen see near the headstone
[32:38] so there will be so much like him
[32:44] there will be in his very image
[32:49] praise God now it's not me or you going
[32:53] out and trying physically now to start
[32:56] appearing like another Jesus
[32:59] you understand
[33:00] another priest that's so sanctimonious
[33:03] no that's not what it is once he's
[33:07] telling you that once you have wrecked a
[33:09] nice that the gene is is in you praise
[33:14] God God's
[33:16] Eternal assurance that you are going to
[33:19] be in the Rapture is already in you
[33:22] so so so therefore you are in His image
[33:28] amen praise God I I have certain the
[33:32] ways like my old daddy
[33:35] and you can't help it you look certain
[33:38] things certain ways and certain actions
[33:40] like you're all that you are your mother
[33:42] amen you you just born that way you
[33:46] can't help that so that's what he's
[33:48] saying as they near to that time of The
[33:51] Headstone which and I'm telling you we
[33:53] have entered into this headstone then he
[33:57] said there will be at that time which is
[34:00] this time there will be in his very
[34:03] image
[34:05] that will be in the gym there will be in
[34:07] the scene because that's what's going to
[34:10] be manifested through them that's what's
[34:13] going to be pushing and manifesting and
[34:16] displaying itself through them
[34:18] Hallelujah so there will be so much like
[34:22] him in order to be United with him in
[34:28] other words you got to recognize of the
[34:31] word Gene being in you before you can
[34:35] see the other part of the Revelation
[34:37] that tells you you are a part of the
[34:40] whole world that's there and those two
[34:44] United amen and once they're United and
[34:48] they're moving use of words in harmony
[34:51] they can then say I and my father are
[34:55] one
[34:56] [Music]
[34:57] I and my father are one you see they
[35:02] will then be the very manifestations of
[35:07] the word of the Living God
[35:09] none of the Dead God but the god that's
[35:12] living now in you and me they are going
[35:15] to be the manifestations of the of the
[35:18] word of the Living God hallelujah praise
[35:21] God Amen so we sit here simply an
[35:25] ordinary but you are the manifestation
[35:27] of the prophets prophecies
[35:30] you're the manifestation of the
[35:31] prophet's word who do you think he was
[35:34] talking about you know you see when
[35:36] Jesus talked back there and said in that
[35:38] day they will know and what do you think
[35:41] he's talking about the prophet said this
[35:43] day right now
[35:45] you are the people this is the place
[35:47] Hallelujah and the word of God is on the
[35:50] scene according to God's program amen
[35:53] hallelujah and you see now oh my now he
[36:00] goes right and says now you see them
[36:03] denominations can never produce that
[36:07] they can't they gotta have the germ the
[36:10] gene they got to be predestinated or
[36:12] whatever before they can even start or
[36:14] even think of that but he said them
[36:16] denominations can never produce this
[36:20] already we see they're the spirit of
[36:22] contest God and Satan and all that right
[36:25] in that little uh thing there you see
[36:28] because all they can produce is their
[36:32] creeds
[36:34] and their dogmas
[36:37] mixed with the work
[36:39] and that only brings forth a hybrid
[36:43] product
[36:45] that's simple isn't that
[36:47] oh my every seed remember the principle
[36:51] remember the guideline God's word every
[36:55] seed must he didn't say me could be or
[36:59] maybe every seed will bring forth after
[37:03] its kind
[37:05] and we are after God's kind
[37:08] because we are who here brought forth by
[37:12] the opening of his word hallelujah now
[37:16] praise the Lord see so oh thank God for
[37:20] that so notice carefully here that they
[37:23] are the very manifestation of the living
[37:27] word amen I have a little note that I
[37:31] wrote here so there are the
[37:34] manifestations of the word or in other
[37:38] words fruits

[37:47] Prophet said that was Jesus the word uh
[37:50] what do you think the Tree of Life Is
[37:52] Here is the same thing it's Jesus Christ
[37:54] the word
[37:55] and we are fruits of that word
[37:58] and
[38:00] um the fruits on a tree tells you what
[38:02] kind of tree it is
[38:04] the fruits is a manifestation of the
[38:07] tree and the nature of the tree
[38:09] character of the tree whatever it is it
[38:11] tells you what kind of tree that is and
[38:14] we are fruits of that word of the tree
[38:17] of life amen praise be to God hallelujah

[39:02] Adam is Jesus Christ right A Spoken Word
[39:07] seed Son of God
[39:10] amen was given a bride
[39:14] like Adam but before he could marry her
[39:19] she had fallen also because she was put
[39:24] on free moral agency
[39:28] to believe God's word and live or doubt
[39:31] it and die amen she was put on free
[39:35] moral agency praise the name of the Lord
[39:39] hallelujah now let's leave that alone

[39:54] of that true seed of the word hallelujah
[39:59] now he's talking about the third uh
[40:02] manifestation of the sonship
[40:07] but now he says that manifestation of
[40:10] sonship will be a little group
[40:12] in other words he's talking about the
[40:14] bride here
[40:15] right it's moved from the one God

[41:11] of God not commit sin you know that
[41:15] person is a virgin to God by the very
[41:19] word that is in them
[41:22] is that right she's the virgin of the
[41:25] word praise God he doesn't pay any
[41:28] attention to anything else that's just
[41:30] Satan's manifestations of this and that
[41:33] and distractions God wouldn't pay
[41:35] attention to that he looks at what his
[41:37] word is doing and they're justifying
[41:40] amen praise the Lord God hallelujah amen
[41:44] I'm so glad God has spoken word back

[42:14] Hallelujah he promised Jesus would come
[42:18] and the manifestation took place through
[42:22] the virgin
[42:23] amen praise God he's not saying the
[42:26] Virgin is going to do it but he caused
[42:28] the manifestation to come true the
[42:31] virgin

[42:36] be used of God hallelujah so that she
[42:39] could manifest the word

[42:51] not dogmas
[42:53] The Word of Promise in himself like it
[42:59] was in Mary
[43:01] God made himself manifest through that
[43:06] amen so that uh Gene in the virgin of
[43:12] this hour God makes himself manifested
[43:16] through that
[43:18] hallelujah it's God displaying himself
[43:21] for this age through that for his glory
[43:25] We're Not Looking Back
[43:28] at what a used to happen back there
[43:31] that's good and we need to read it and
[43:34] it needs to help us in every way but we
[43:37] want to manifest the word for this day
[43:41] the premises for this age
[43:44] hallelujah praise God now I can we can
[43:47] go down there less than that would be on
[43:49] another whole sermon of what is to be
[43:51] fulfilled and what is to be made known
[43:53] in this day and this hour through the
[43:56] bride for this day praise the name of
[43:58] the Lord amen praise God God himself
[44:02] making himself manifest you see you he
[44:09] then will act himself
[44:14] is not what I was trying to tell you
[44:16] before I didn't read this before I'm not
[44:19] uh you know it's only this today that I
[44:22] went over this and went through it when
[44:25] he said no in other words you don't run
[44:27] trying to do this or that he will act
[44:30] himself
[44:32] he will act himself see praise God
[44:37] Hallelujah by his own Word of Promise he
[44:41] will act so to fulfill all that has been
[44:46] written about him
[44:48] just like he did with the disciples back
[44:50] there from Moses and the prophets the
[44:52] Bible says he took all them scriptures
[44:54] and then began to unfold them and unfold
[44:57] them like that praise the Lord he's
[45:00] doing the same thing
[45:02] remember brother Branham says they don't
[45:04] recognize it but history repeats itself
[45:08] you believe that
[45:10] I'm just gonna come down and talk
[45:12] natural I was so impressed last night
[45:16] when I heard uh one of the reporters on
[45:20] CNN saying oh uh president uh uh
[45:26] President Biden is one of is not one he
[45:30] is the greatest president and he's still
[45:34] in office uh Roosevelt is dead and all
[45:38] those things that he brought in and how
[45:42] it was a woman the first woman ever to
[45:45] be the person that should enact these
[45:48] things that brought in all these things
[45:50] the Social Security Medicaid things that
[45:55] are now like the basis of the United
[45:57] States some of the greatest laws and
[45:59] Provisions and stuff like that and now
[46:03] Biden has done uh the same thing and now
[46:07] ready to go ahead of that with what he's
[46:09] doing and it hasn't been done like that
[46:12] for hundreds of years and he said and
[46:16] then this is what caught my things so
[46:18] but I don't understand it I don't know
[46:20] what this is but I I I I saw look when I
[46:24] was looking the background of this lady
[46:28] and I looked at the background of the
[46:30] present person rather Biden the
[46:33] president has in the same position that
[46:36] they were born in the same city
[46:41] they were born in the same debt
[46:44] in the same month
[46:46] they were born
[46:48] and he said I I don't understand this
[46:51] kind of thing I don't know what it is
[46:53] but he is doing the same things that she
[46:56] was doing and and doing it more in this
[46:59] hour that's what I'm referring to
[47:02] that history repeats itself
[47:05] and Jesus all these things were
[47:07] manifesting Jesus they were manifesting
[47:10] all these prophets and now the r has
[47:13] come when they will be made manifest in
[47:15] the bride yes
[47:17] not the bride going on like I usually
[47:20] use the word working herself but trying
[47:21] to bring on some no no no but he himself
[47:24] will act through his what his word to
[47:28] fulfill his own work through the brain
[47:31] through the Virgin praise God for this
[47:34] hour glory to God hallelujah amen
[47:39] you see and he then when he come from
[47:43] the Virgin womb which today we see type
[47:48] of the spirit womb the word in that
[47:52] Spirit womb amen see yes sir
[47:58] so will the Virgin now
[48:01] accepting his word by saying be it unto
[48:05] me
[48:06] according to Thy Word
[48:09] but notice
[48:11] though it was an angel that spoke to her
[48:16] amen God who's an angel he's saying here
[48:19] to speak to her but he's turning around
[48:22] and saying but it wasn't the word of the
[48:25] angel
[48:26] it wasn't the Angel's word though he was
[48:29] the speaker or the voice right it wasn't
[48:32] his word it was God's word
[48:36] hallelujah amen she believed the angel
[48:41] you see because what he spoke was the
[48:45] written word
[48:47] was the word already
[48:49] Isaiah 9 6
[48:51] or Amen in other words the angel didn't
[48:53] have to go quoting all of that he just
[48:56] tell her what he has to tell her
[48:57] according to the word of the Living God
[49:00] hallelujah amen hallelujah saw these now
[49:05] will love him
[49:08] and they will have his potentials thanks
[49:11] be to God Amen you got that none of us
[49:15] can have all of him
[49:17] but we're going to have potentials
[49:19] they're going to be little Messiah ants
[49:22] they're going to be little saviors
[49:25] little anointed ones with the spirit of
[49:28] God in them little licks of flame and
[49:31] fire that's coming together in the name
[49:34] of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen praise
[49:38] God and they will love him and will have
[49:41] his potentials for he is their head and
[49:45] they are his subjects
[49:48] and subjects how by being subject to his
[49:52] head
[49:54] amen are you surrendered to the
[49:56] leadership or headship of Jesus Christ
[50:00] amen praise be to God hallelujah oh my
[50:05] now your Harmony of Jesus and the father
[50:10] is showing that back there that's the
[50:13] same Harmony it's going to come back and
[50:16] be here between the bride and Jesus
[50:19] Christ the holy spirit amen did she ever
[50:23] have that same kind of Harmony because
[50:26] she will never disagree with the word
[50:29] she will not act against the word
[50:31] hallelujah and she he said he'll do
[50:34] nothing unless the father showed him
[50:37] first Hallelujah that was the harmony
[50:40] between God and Christ but now the so
[50:46] will the bride Hallelujah for he will
[50:49] show her his word
[50:52] of life and then she knows how to what
[50:55] to do and how to act amen praise God and
[50:59] she receives that word and never doubts
[51:02] it
[51:03] praise the Lord
[51:05] and when that happens nothing can harm
[51:08] her not even death
[51:11] not even death can harm her he's not
[51:15] talking about physical death that can't
[51:17] harm you either but it can separate you
[51:20] from your physical body that's all
[51:22] that's doing but uh Paul said that's not
[51:25] a problem because they separate you from
[51:27] your body absent from this body I'm
[51:29] present with the Lord so so so Satan
[51:32] thinks he's doing this or doing that
[51:34] you're present with the Lord
[51:36] amen
[51:38] now
[51:39] remember nothing can harm her not even
[51:43] death
[51:43] for if the seed be planted
[51:47] the water will raise it up again
[51:51] praise God
[51:53] no matter where that seed is planted
[51:55] whatever heart is planted in and look we
[51:59] have all kinds of preachers and
[52:00] Believers following this message but
[52:03] it's a very
[52:05] minuscule group
[52:07] few
[52:09] and right when I said that the the devil
[52:12] is talking talking to me and I'm going
[52:13] to tell you now what he's saying he's
[52:15] saying are you just saying that to
[52:16] justify yourself
[52:20] no no but that's how the devil works
[52:23] right but you're looking at the truth or
[52:26] the word of God here right
[52:29] fear not little flock
[52:32] it is your father's good pleasure to
[52:35] give you the kingdom
[52:37] praise the Lord
[52:39] listen though now
[52:42] here is the secret
[52:45] the word is already in the bride
[52:51] the word is in the bride
[52:55] amen now
[52:59] and
[53:01] the mind of Christ then she knows what
[53:06] he wants done what to do with the word
[53:09] because it's already in her
[53:12] glory be to God you see your
[53:15] understanding this differently than if I
[53:17] was preaching somewhere even in the
[53:19] message Church
[53:21] um are you going to get the mind of
[53:23] Christ from somewhere all of a sudden
[53:25] you're going to get the mind of Christ
[53:26] not realizing that the mind of Christ is
[53:29] already in you
[53:32] and then that will start talking to you
[53:36] that will begin showing you uh what next
[53:39] to be done and I don't even hear some
[53:42] Supernatural boys talking you know
[53:45] that's how the devil gets people
[53:47] thinking like that when when when he
[53:50] comes just simply and softly well why
[53:52] don't you turn around go through this
[53:54] road why don't you pick up that thing
[53:57] and
[53:58] you know how many simple things right I
[54:01] go into a store I see something and I
[54:03] get the thought about buying it or
[54:06] taking that
[54:07] and I said no I'll come back the next
[54:09] time I walk away from it and then the
[54:11] thought hit me again by time I go back
[54:14] somebody's gone with that thing
[54:16] right as simple as that look that sounds
[54:19] like nothing but let me tell you right
[54:22] down to the smallest thing I'm watching
[54:24] for the Holy Spirit
[54:28] at all times amen see so the mind she
[54:32] has the mind of Christ to know what he
[54:35] wants done with the word and she does it
[54:38] in his name that sounds simple but she's
[54:42] not doing it to glorify herself she's
[54:45] not doing it to be seen or recognized
[54:47] known no uh
[54:50] she's doing it in his name
[54:52] that his name received the glory
[54:55] that he be lifted up
[54:57] that he be receive all praise and honor
[55:00] and Glory that is why she's doing
[55:03] everything in his name
[55:05] praise God wonderful what Authority also
[55:09] praise God because she's telling the
[55:12] devil you must recognize who I am I am
[55:15] Mrs Jesus
[55:16] I'm telling you this you've got to do it
[55:19] and my husband is back here he's going
[55:21] to enforce the word
[55:22] restoration of the Bright Tree the
[55:24] prophet says that plainly he says that
[55:26] the Holy Spirit The Enforcer is right
[55:29] here to enforce the word of the Living
[55:31] God if you believe it and you believe
[55:34] who you are and what you are raised up
[55:36] for
[55:37] Hallelujah God is here in you ready to
[55:41] enforce his own word
[55:44] the bright tree
[55:46] has been restored
[55:49] the fruits are now on the tree
[55:52] the manifestation and the display of
[55:56] life being in the tree is now being made
[55:59] known praise God hallelujah amen yes sir
[56:03] for all you see
[56:05] with that she has thus said the Lord
[56:11] oh praise God doesn't mean brother Bill
[56:15] you suddenly get super spiritual and you
[56:18] walk over to brother Glenn say brother
[56:20] Glenn just see it the Lord
[56:25] that's not what he's talking about amen
[56:29] she has that in her she don't have to
[56:32] say you said the Lord because she has
[56:35] that in her
[56:36] and when God speaks out of her whether
[56:39] she is conscious or unconscious of
[56:42] what's happening it's God's speaking to
[56:46] some person persons
[56:48] and that just upset the Lord because
[56:51] he's using them and speaking out to them
[56:54] sometimes you're conscious sometimes
[56:55] you're not conscious you're not aware of
[56:58] it and sometimes somebody will come back
[57:00] and say remember when you told me this
[57:02] you told me that you said so and so and
[57:06] boy I went by that and that really
[57:07] helped me when did you when did I say
[57:10] that you know praise God somebody can
[57:13] say oh you're forgetful you can't even
[57:15] remember that right well that's not the
[57:18] point because I might not have been the
[57:21] one that said that you might not have
[57:23] been the one that said that praise God
[57:25] it's just God spoke through his vessel
[57:28] for his glory and for his honor
[57:32] amen see
[57:35] it is germanized
[57:38] the thing has come to life but now
[57:41] the water has come on the seed and the
[57:44] seed has come to life it's germanized
[57:47] it's start to manifest and him hand he
[57:51] saw the Holy Spirit Waters it until it
[57:55] is grown and serves its purpose
[57:58] Hallelujah
[58:00] the spirit of God
[58:02] so I have the seed you have the seed
[58:04] everybody you have the seed who believes
[58:06] they have it then the spirit of God
[58:08] constantly Waters that which is what I
[58:10] believe he's doing right now what is
[58:13] that seed and the prophet says he's
[58:16] watering it so that it can grow and come
[58:18] to its maturity
[58:21] and fulfill its purpose
[58:25] for what God sent it here for until it
[58:28] has grown and serves its purpose
[58:33] praise the Lord see and doing that they
[58:37] will do only his will
[58:40] only his will amen no one can persuade
[58:45] them to do anything different
[58:47] Hallelujah they know they have to have
[58:51] just seek the Lord or they will sit
[58:55] still
[58:57] they don't care what anybody says oh you
[59:00] don't know that you're supposed to know
[59:01] that how long have you been a message
[59:04] brother Glenn
[59:06] you know paragraph 64 1964
[59:10] what's that oh I don't know
[59:13] you see they look on that as a failure
[59:16] you look on that you've been so long in
[59:19] the message and you don't you even
[59:21] forgetting certain Bible texts my yet
[59:25] you claim you're a Christian and a
[59:27] believer of this message oh my they're
[59:31] not realize that you have laid
[59:33] everything down you read the word
[59:37] you read the message you listen to it
[59:39] but you letting the Holy Spirit use it
[59:43] not me using it against you and you or
[59:48] trying to answer you or trying to prove
[59:51] that no no no no no no everything has
[59:54] come right down amen the pot has
[59:57] simmered down
