[23:53] rising up. Amen. I read a quote
[23:56] yesterday from Brother Brham. His
[23:58] message is redemption by power. He says,
[24:00] "You always pointed how wicked the world
[24:01] is getting, but you failed to to see how
[24:04] powerful the church is getting. At the
[24:06] same time, she's rising up, standing on
[24:08] the field. Oh, she's a little flock, but
[24:11] brother, God is with her, and she's
[24:13] going to triumph just as certain as
[24:15] Christ rose from the dead." Amen. God's
[24:17] church shall never fail. The gates of
[24:19] hell shall not prevail against it. Show
[24:22] that they would be against it, but they
[24:24] cannot prevail against it. The church is
[24:26] going to triumph through the blood of
[24:28] Jesus Christ with a victory match. I'm
[24:30] positive of this one thing that God will
[24:32] have a church without spot, wrinkle, or
[24:35] blemish. Amen. I'm so happy about that.
[24:37] Are you happy about that this morning?
[24:39] Hallelujah.
[24:41] God is so good.
[24:43] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's sing Christ has

[30:56] If there's ever a time that this uh
[30:59] church can say we've got the life of God
[31:03] in us, it's right now because he's
[31:06] vindicating his church by his life in
[31:11] you. That's how you're going to know
[31:13] that you're actually a part of what God
[31:15] is doing in this hour is when you can
[31:18] recognize that his life is taking over
[31:21] yours. You're dying daily. You're in
[31:25] that you're in that understanding that
[31:28] every day. Listen, this is not an easy
[31:31] walk. It's not an easy walk. And you
[31:35] should know that you got to overcome
[31:38] because this is an age where this is the
[31:40] age where he says to them that overcome
[31:43] will I allow to sit with me where? In
[31:46] his throne. In a place of a throne is an
[31:50] is a place of authority. And so he's
[31:53] given you the authority. He's given you
[31:55] the ability to rule and reign with him
[31:58] in preparation for the millennium.
[32:01] Praise God. So the first place you need
[32:03] to rule is in
[32:05] yourself. Amen. Praise God. And so the
[32:09] life of God is certainly making his
[32:13] debut in this day and in this hour. I
[32:14] want to welcome our guests, Brother
[32:16] Carson, Sister
[32:18] Sharon, Chris. Welcome there, young man
[32:22] and your lovely wife. Welcome into the

[32:37] in Ohio. We we were with 39 other
[32:41] pastors and their wives within the
[32:45] message. And um I all I can say is that
[32:48] it was a tremendous blessing. It was a
[32:51] time of rest for us. Believe it or not,
[32:54] we were ministered to. The Lord just
[32:56] brought us together in such a a
[32:58] wonderful way. And so um we're grateful
[33:00] for that. Amen. Praise
[33:03] God. And so um today we've got our

[35:56] given to us in this last day.
[35:59] Father, this word of God that has been
[36:02] given to us, this precious word of God,
[36:05] Lord, this word is not just letter,
[36:07] Lord. It's life, Father. It's the life
[36:10] of the living
[36:12] God. The same life that walked in that
[36:15] body, Jesus Christ, is here this
[36:18] morning, Lord.
[36:20] And Father, that's what we are so
[36:22] thankful this morning, Lord, that we've
[36:25] been given this honor to come into your
[36:26] presence, Lord. We don't take it
[36:28] lightly,
[36:30] Lord. So we ask, Father, that you would
[36:33] just wash us and cleanse us in the
[36:35] precious blood. There be any sin here
[36:37] this morning, Lord. Let it be forgiven,
[36:42] Father. Lord, nothing but the blood of
[36:44] Jesus this morning, Lord. Not our own
[36:47] works, not even gifts, our abilities,
[36:51] nothing but the blood of Jesus this
[36:53] morning.
[36:54] Lord, let us lift you up on high this
[36:57] morning. And you said, "If I be lifted
[36:59] up, I'll draw all men, Lord." We need to
[37:02] be lifted up this morning, Lord,
[37:05] higher. There's a rapture that is taking
[37:07] place that is going on right now, Lord.
[37:10] And we're not staying here on this
[37:12] earth, Lord. We're leaving this earth,
[37:13] Lord. So this morning as your word comes
[37:16] forth, Father, let us leave a little bit
[37:20] more of this earth this morning, a
[37:22] little bit more of ourselves this
[37:23] morning. Come this morning, this
[37:26] morning, Lord God, and reveal yourself,
[37:28] Lord. It's not by might, it's not by
[37:31] power, but by your spirit,
[37:33] Lord. Oh spirit of revelation, come this
[37:37] morning, oh God. Open the eyes of the
[37:39] blind.
[37:41] Open the hearts that are hardened,
[37:44] Father. Oh God, just move in a mighty
[37:46] way this morning. We commit ourselves to
[37:48] thee, Lord. We give you the atmosphere,
[37:51] Father. We give you the liberty this
[37:54] morning, Lord. And we bind every power
[37:57] of Satan. We bind every power of
[37:59] unbelief, Father, because we know we are
[38:01] in the greatest battle ever fought,
[38:04] Father. So Lord, what we bind on earth,
[38:07] you said, will be bound in heaven. What
[38:09] we loose will be loosed, Lord. And we
[38:11] bind the power of Satan and all his
[38:14] activities. And we loose liberty. We
[38:16] loose the Holy Spirit. And we loose the
[38:19] word upon the people's hearts this
[38:21] morning. Grant these things. I commit
[38:24] myself, Father, into your hands. I could
[38:27] do nothing without you, Lord. I'm just a
[38:30] speaker, Lord, that will speak words,
[38:31] but you are the one that quickens into
[38:34] the hearts of your people, Lord. And I
[38:35] commit the people's hearts into your
[38:38] hands this morning. They can't hear,
[38:40] they can't see, they can't understand
[38:42] without you, Lord. May you come this
[38:45] morning and give that what we have need
[38:47] of. Father, we trust and believe in you,
[38:50] Father. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. God
[38:54] bless you, saints. God bless you.
[38:57] Hallelujah. It's good to be here this
[38:59] morning. I don't have to make any
[39:01] opening statements or comments. It was
[39:03] all set from our pastor, perfectly in
[39:06] line with the spirit and in line with
[39:08] the word. This morning, I'm going to
[39:10] continue on my series, the power of
[39:12] tradition, part 12. I want to title
[39:15] this, the mighty angel is preparing the
[39:17] bride for
[39:19] transition. Amen. I believe there's a
[39:22] great preparation going on right now.
[39:24] And I believe also there's a transition
[39:26] taking place. Amen.
[39:29] Hallelujah. Amen. And we are in the
[39:32] rapture right now. There's a process
[39:34] taking place within us right now. Amen.
[39:37] Hallelujah. We don't want to hinder that
[39:39] working of the Holy Spirit in our lives
[39:42] by our own flesh and by doubt and
[39:44] unbelief. Amen. We want to believe the
[39:47] word of God this morning. And we need
[39:49] his help. Amen. We need the spirit of
[39:52] the living God this morning. Amen. I may
[39:55] speak a lot of words, but it ain't man.
[39:57] It ain't man that you come looking for.
[39:59] If it if it's man that you come looking
[40:01] for this morning or even a gift, you're
[40:04] going to leave disappointed. But if you
[40:05] come to connect with the Holy Ghost, the
[40:08] one that can reveal to you and speak to
[40:11] you to discern your very thoughts and
[40:12] intents of your heart. Amen. We want him
[40:15] to be present. That's what I pray for.
[40:18] Amen. You want to know what a minister
[40:19] prays for? For him to have the
[40:21] preeminence here. Hallelujah. Amen. Let
[40:25] us turn to the book of Revelations 10:8.
[40:28] then Revelations
[40:31] 19:5 and then we're going to go to
[40:33] Romans 12:1 to read the word of God.
[40:37] Amen. Thank you,
[40:39] Lord. Oh,
[40:41] hallelujah. And the voice which I heard
[40:44] from heaven spake unto me again and
[40:47] said, "Go, take the little book which is
[40:51] open in the hand of the
[40:53] angel, which standeth upon the sea and
[40:56] upon the earth." We know that that's the
[40:58] mighty angel that has come down in this
[41:00] day. Not the seven church age messenger,
[41:03] but the mighty angel. Amen. And I
[41:05] believe he is still here. The prophet is
[41:08] gone. But he didn't leave. Amen. The
[41:11] mighty angel. And I went unto the angel
[41:14] and said unto him, "Give me the book."
[41:18] Remember in chapter five, nobody was
[41:20] able to and worthy to take the book,
[41:23] even to look upon the book. But here's a
[41:27] prepared people that are saying, "Give
[41:30] me the book out of the angel's hand
[41:31] now." Oh, something happened, my
[41:33] brothers and sisters. Amen. And he said
[41:36] unto me, "Take it. Eat it up, and it
[41:39] shall make thy belly bitter, and it it
[41:42] shall be sweet in thy mouth as honey."
[41:45] And I took the little book out of the
[41:48] angel's hand, and I ate it up. Oh, God.
[41:52] May God help us this morning to take
[41:55] that book and eat it up. Amen. That word
[41:57] of God. And it was in my mouth sweet as
[42:00] honey. But as soon as I eaten it up, my
[42:02] belly was bitter. And he said unto me,
[42:05] "Thou must prophesy again before many
[42:09] people and nations and tongues and
[42:12] kings." Let us turn to Revelation
[42:15] 19:5.
[42:17] Amen.
[42:19] Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[42:22] And a voice came out of the throne,
[42:24] saying, "Praise our God, all ye saints,
[42:28] servants, and ye that fear him, both
[42:31] small and great. And I heard as it were
[42:34] a voice of great
[42:36] multitude, as and as the voice of many
[42:40] waters, and the voice of many mighty
[42:43] thunderings, saying,
[42:45] "Hallelujah! For the Lord God, O
[42:48] Nimidant reignth."
[42:50] Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[42:54] honor to him for the marriage of the
[42:57] lamb is come and his wife has made
[43:01] herself ready. Glory to God. Let us
[43:05] rejoice this morning and be glad. Amen.
[43:09] Cuz the marriage of the lamb has come.
[43:12] It's here. It's now. That's what we're
[43:15] feasting on. and his wife, hallelujah,
[43:18] has made herself ready. And to her was
[43:21] granite that she should be a rain in
[43:23] fine linen, clean and white. For the
[43:26] fine linen is a righteousness of the
[43:28] saints. And he said unto me, write
[43:32] blessed are they which are called unto
[43:34] the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he
[43:37] said unto me, these are the true saints
[43:39] of God. Hallelujah. Bless. I believe
[43:42] there's a blessed people here this
[43:44] morning. Amen. Now, you believe you're
[43:46] blessed.
[43:48] Hallelujah. Glory to God. If you
[43:50] recognize that you are one of those
[43:52] blessed people this morning, we will
[43:55] rejoice in his presence. Amen.
[43:58] Hallelujah. Romans
[44:00] 12:1. I beseech you therefore, brethren,
[44:03] by the mercies of God, that you present
[44:06] your body a living sacrifice, holy,
[44:09] acceptable unto God, which is your
[44:11] reasonable service. and be not conformed
[44:14] to this world, but be ye transformed by
[44:18] the renewing of your mind that you may
[44:21] prove what is good and acceptable and
[44:24] perfect will of God. Hallelujah. May God
[44:30] add the blessings to his word. Amen. You
[44:33] may be seated. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[44:39] Oh my brothers and sisters, I believe
[44:43] there's a transformation taking place
[44:45] right now. Amen. I believe there's a
[44:48] people that God has been being being
[44:52] preparing for a long time now.
[44:56] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God.
[44:59] Philippians 1:6, "Being confident of
[45:02] this very thing, that he which began a
[45:05] good work in you will perform it until
[45:09] the day of Jesus Christ." Amen.
[45:11] Hallelujah. The confidence that the
[45:13] bride of Jesus Christ, the faith that
[45:16] the bride of Jesus Christ is coming into
[45:18] right now in this hour, she knows who he
[45:22] is. She knows him. Amen. And she knows
[45:27] that he's going to fulfill his word. She
[45:30] knows that. Amen. He has spoken his word
[45:32] in these last days. The seven seals has
[45:35] been open. The names have been spoken
[45:38] out of those seven seals which are the
[45:40] characters of God. The character riches
[45:43] of God which are you this morning. Each
[45:46] one of you are part of the character of
[45:48] God. Amen. That's being manifested in
[45:51] this hour. She has that. She's
[45:54] recognizing that. And remember the
[45:56] greatest prophecy of the bride of Jesus
[45:58] Christ in this hour is when she
[46:00] recognizes who she is. Amen. That is the
[46:05] amnesia from the word of God over the
[46:07] years pounding and being spoken over
[46:10] you. Amen. Hallelujah. Breaking that
[46:13] amnesia so you can recognize that you
[46:16] and the word are one and the same. Amen.
[46:19] Jesus performed what he did. He lived
[46:23] the life that he lived on earth. He did
[46:26] the things and said the things that he
[46:27] said because he knew who he was. He
[46:31] didn't bypass his theophony. Amen. He
[46:34] knew. He came to this earth knowing his
[46:36] position and what his calling was, the
[46:39] portion of the word that was in him. But
[46:42] we we come in sin. Amen. We bypassed our
[46:46] theophony. We came into a body of sin
[46:49] shaped in iniquity. come to the world
[46:51] speaking lies. We are born out of a
[46:54] sexual act. Amen. He wasn't. Amen. And
[46:57] then now when God placed an attribute, a
[47:01] seed of God in us. And then here come
[47:03] the word at the appointed time and
[47:05] season in our life, God came to us.
[47:08] Amen. And spoke his word and awakened
[47:11] that seed. And as soon as that seed,
[47:14] that new birth took place in us. Amen.
[47:17] New life came. a resurrected life came.
[47:22] It wasn't a religious life. It wasn't a
[47:24] church life, but it was his life that
[47:27] resurrected in us. Amen. And the Bible
[47:30] says, "Amen. When that when that work
[47:33] took place inside of you, Amen. It it
[47:37] didn't cease to stop. It doesn't stop,
[47:40] my brothers and sisters, if you've been
[47:42] truly born again, that work of God
[47:45] doesn't stop inside of you. It
[47:47] progresses. It progresses even your
[47:50] unbelief. God knew. He winks at our
[47:53] ignorance. He He knows the unbelief. It
[47:55] does not hinder him. Amen. The word of
[47:58] God will continue to march on with
[48:00] inside of us. Amen. Because it has a
[48:03] destination. It has a purpose. Just like
[48:06] God is determined in his mind, amen, to
[48:09] bring this word to pass. That's why he
[48:12] said, "My word won't return to me void.
[48:16] I don't care if all hell is against it.
[48:19] Amen. It won't return to me void. I have
[48:22] spoken it. Shall I not declare it? Shall
[48:25] I not perform it and do it? Hallelujah.
[48:29] But that's for me and you, my brothers
[48:31] and sisters. That's was spoken for me
[48:34] and you to believe that that's what God
[48:37] is doing within side of us
[48:40] regardless. Hallelujah.
[48:44] Oh my. The meaning of
[48:47] translation. Hallelujah. And
[48:50] preparation. The process or period of
[48:54] changing from one state or condition to
[48:57] another. The process of moving something
[49:00] from one place to another. The action or
[49:03] the process of making ready or being
[49:07] made ready for use.
[49:09] Preparing involves calling upon the
[49:12] Lord, coming to God in a relationship,
[49:16] praying, seeking the will of God for our
[49:19] lives. Amen. And for the word of God to
[49:23] be manifested in our hearts. Our faith
[49:25] is not one more item on the the do list.
[49:29] The to-do list. Our faith forms our
[49:34] purpose. Faith is a revelation. Amen.
[49:38] Throughout Matthew's gospel, Jesus
[49:40] teaches the people about living and
[49:42] growing in a relationship with God.
[49:44] That's what this is all about. Amen.
[49:47] That same relationship that Jesus had
[49:50] with the father is the same relationship
[49:53] that the bride has with the bridegroom,
[49:55] with the husband in this hour. Amen.
[49:58] There's no difference, my brothers and
[50:00] sisters. Hallelujah.
[50:03] But we see brother Brandham talking here
[50:06] in the power of
[50:08] transformation. Hallelujah. Just laying
[50:10] a little background here. Satan's
[50:12] purpose from Eden was to make his own
[50:15] self Eden and exalt himself above the
[50:18] sons of God that they would worship him.
[50:22] And he has absolutely carried it out
[50:25] now. And when he's done this and brought
[50:29] it into the
[50:30] church, now he has his kind of
[50:35] Eden that
[50:37] Satan does. In the 6,000 years he has
[50:42] formed, not created, but deformed God's
[50:46] whole earth. his creatures, his animals,
[50:50] interbreeding, hybriding, trees, plants,
[50:53] humans, even religion, the Bible, the
[50:56] church, until he's got himself a
[50:59] complete Garden of Eden of
[51:03] science.
[51:05] Hallelujah. Of
[51:07] science. Everything moving by
[51:11] science. Our automobiles, everything we
[51:14] have was given to us by science.
[51:17] what man has
[51:20] done. Remember we are we are in the
[51:23] world but not of the world. Remember we
[51:27] are overcoming we are overcomers.
[51:30] Hallelujah. We are overcoming what? The
[51:34] world. We are overcoming science. We are
[51:37] overcoming the flesh. Amen. We are
[51:40] overcomers to what? Produce this word.
[51:44] This word, my brothers and sisters,
[51:46] can't be mixed in our
[51:49] lives. Nothing else can have the
[51:52] preeminence in our hearts but this word.
[51:55] So God, amen, has to come within us by
[51:58] his spirit and overcome everything. I'm
[52:02] talking about everything, my brothers
[52:04] and sisters. This is a complete
[52:06] surrender. This is a a a total
[52:08] deliverance in this hour. Amen. Jesus
[52:11] Christ wants to manifest himself in seed
[52:14] form, in real form, in purity form in
[52:18] this hour. He doesn't want religion. He
[52:21] doesn't want message believers. He
[52:24] doesn't want message culture,
[52:27] churchgoers. He wants Christ, the living
[52:30] God. He wants to live again in us. He
[52:34] wants surrendered, yielded vessels that
[52:37] he can possess and control in this hour.
[52:40] Amen.
[52:43] And he's got his Eden, his great Eden
[52:46] here to prove that the message is
[52:50] timely. It proves everything out there.
[52:54] Everything that you're seeing
[52:55] prophesied, my brothers and sisters out
[52:56] there, don't worry about the world
[52:58] falling apart. It
[53:00] proves the message is timely. It proves
[53:04] us the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. Just
[53:07] like Israel's the time piece. Amen. You
[53:10] look at Israel, you know where the bride
[53:11] is going.
[53:13] Hallelujah.
[53:15] Amen.
[53:17] Hallelujah. Timely to prove it's not
[53:19] some other age. But Revelation 10, look
[53:22] at the hybriding today. It's Satan
[53:25] that's done it through education
[53:26] programs. Better fit, better this,
[53:29] better that. And not knowing all the
[53:32] time, they're walking
[53:34] straight into death.
[53:39] death spiritually.
[53:43] Churches walking right into death.
[53:47] Better this, better
[53:49] that. Blind leading the blind. Blind
[53:53] leaders of the nations. Oh, we can see
[53:56] that. Blind. Blind leaders of science.
[54:00] Blind leaders of the church. Blind lead
[54:03] in the blind. Jesus said, "Let them
[54:05] alone. They will both fall in the ditch.
[54:08] Hallelujah. God's plan before the
[54:11] foundation of the world in his mind.
[54:15] Hallelujah. He knew that every seed that
[54:19] he had prepared. Amen. In his mind, the
[54:22] names that are in the books, his book
[54:25] that was been open, he knew each and
[54:27] every one. He prepared everything. My
[54:30] brothers and sister, it doesn't matter
[54:32] if the world is in chaos, upside down.
[54:36] God in his mind. Amen. We are not
[54:38] connected to that. That has nothing to
[54:40] do with us. Amen. We are here this
[54:42] morning under the umbrella of the Holy
[54:45] Spirit, the word of God. Amen. We have
[54:47] nothing to do with that. God in his mind
[54:50] had prepared this morning. God in his
[54:52] mind has prepared you in his mind. Amen.
[54:55] God has called you, elected you. Amen.
[54:58] You are here this morning because the
[55:00] hand of God is upon your life. Whether
[55:03] you feel it, even whether you believe it
[55:06] or not, God has you here this morning.
[55:08] Amen. Cuz he prepared all things.
[55:13] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. The
[55:16] transformation in the bride is the
[55:19] quickening by the spirit of revelation.
[55:22] And the power in the word is to manifest
[55:24] the power to change and bring the seed
[55:28] to life. Hallelujah.
[55:31] The Bible describes new creation, the
[55:34] context of salvation and transformation
[55:36] that occurs when a person is in Christ.
[55:40] This idea suggests complete renewal both
[55:43] inwardly and outwardly. The old ways of
[55:47] life are replaced by the new ordered of
[55:52] the way of life. Amen. 2
[55:55] Corinthians 5:17. Therefore, if anyone
[55:59] is in Christ, he's a new
[56:02] creation. Old things have passed away.
[56:06] Behold, all things are made new. There
[56:10] is no room for that old life. You can't
[56:14] put this wine into old bottles. Amen.
[56:18] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. Hebrews
[56:23] 6 Hebrews 11:6. Without
[56:27] faith, it's impossible to please
[56:31] him. For he that cometh to God must
[56:34] believe that he's a rewarder, and that
[56:36] he's a rewarder of them that diligently
[56:38] seek him. Hallelujah. Let us talk about
[56:41] faith this morning.
[56:45] Hallelujah. I think faith is
[56:48] misunderstood. I think faith is
[56:52] misrepresented. Hallelujah. I think
[56:55] faith, a lot of people don't understand
[56:57] what faith is. They're mixed up. And we
[57:01] want to just touch on a few things. What
[57:03] real faith is this morning, the Lord
[57:05] willing. Hallelujah. And so when a man
[57:09] lives by faith, brother Brandham
[57:11] talking, and walks by faith, he goes, I
[57:14] mean substance
[57:17] faith, a new creature in Christ there.
[57:21] Now you're getting into bride material.
[57:23] So you see you're getting into rapturing
[57:26] condition now. That means each one of
[57:30] us, not just the pastor, the deacons,
[57:33] the
[57:34] trustees. That means for every ley,
[57:37] every individual that walks in a world
[57:40] with God alone.
[57:43] Okay, there's the evidence that is
[57:47] starting to break out now that what
[57:49] faith does in our lives, it causes us to
[57:53] walk with God alone in a world with God
[57:58] alone, not with one another. We love one
[58:01] another. We fellowship, but
[58:03] individually, we walk with God alone.
[58:07] That's what faith does when it comes
[58:09] into our lives. It gives us a new birth.
[58:12] It changes us. It makes us a new
[58:14] creature in Christ. It brings the life
[58:16] of God in us. And it makes us walk with
[58:20] God alone. Like brother Brandham said,
[58:22] he says, "You go create your own
[58:25] atmosphere, your own world, and go and
[58:28] live on it and live and walk with God in
[58:31] that world alone. Nobody's in there but
[58:34] you and Christ alone." Amen.
[58:38] Hallelujah. Amen.
[58:44] Listen. He says, "Not a shadow of doubt
[58:50] nowhere is in there. You walk right on."
[58:55] If the Lord says there's nobody in the
[58:58] world can talk you out of it, there's
[59:01] nobody. You just go right on the same.
[59:04] You can't talk somebody out of this.
[59:07] They They weren't talked into it. They
[59:09] were birthed into it. Hallelujah. You
[59:12] can't explain somebody into this by
[59:15] knowledge. Amen. They were birthed into
[59:18] this by God himself.
[59:21] Hallelujah. People that get convinced
[59:24] that this this God sent a prophet
[59:27] convinced that that uh you know the the
[59:30] message is right and all that stuff and
[59:31] then next thing you know they they they
[59:33] they get they're convinced out. Then
[59:35] they come against the message. Then they
[59:37] they they uh say that the he's a false
[59:39] prophet. You see, I I when when when God
[59:43] called me, he called me
[59:44] supernaturally. I met
[59:47] Christ. I met him through deliverance. I
[59:50] met him through supernatural
[59:52] experiences. I didn't know God sent a
[59:54] prophet until months down the road. Then
[59:57] I realized that when I heard that voice
[1:00:00] of the prophet, but I seen the
[1:00:02] life. Hallelujah. Not just the miracles,
[1:00:05] signs and wonders, but I seen the the
[1:00:08] life that was in the prophet. That's
[1:00:11] what was my heart was going boom boom
[1:00:13] boom. Amen. Just like a a wife, you
[1:00:16] know, she sees her husband, her husband
[1:00:19] sees the wife, boom, boom. Love, Amen.
[1:00:22] That was eternal love that was striking
[1:00:24] my heart. My husband, Amen, was being
[1:00:28] revealed to me.
[1:00:30] He says here now you're coming into that
[1:00:33] perfect faith, perfect profession that
[1:00:36] cannot fail. That faith never fails. So
[1:00:40] he's talking about different kinds of
[1:00:42] faith here. Amen. That faith never
[1:00:45] fails. He was a mystic to them with his
[1:00:49] perfect faith. And so it is it now to
[1:00:52] those with perfect faith are mystic to
[1:00:57] others. Oh yeah. You're experiencing
[1:01:01] that. Amen. People just don't understand
[1:01:05] you. Hallelujah. You'll never understand
[1:01:08] me. I'm telling you that right now.
[1:01:10] You'll never understand a true son and
[1:01:12] daughter of God. Just like you'll never
[1:01:14] you'll never know where the the wind
[1:01:16] bloweth and where it lists the Holy
[1:01:17] Spirit and how he moves. I don't I don't
[1:01:20] know what I'm going to be doing the next
[1:01:22] minute to two minutes from now. Amen. I
[1:01:24] walk up here with notes. These are just
[1:01:26] notes. These are just written words. I
[1:01:27] don't know what God's going to say, what
[1:01:28] he's going to do. Amen. But we let him
[1:01:31] do what he wants to do. That is the way
[1:01:32] it is in everybody's life. We are we're
[1:01:35] strange. We are strangers in a strange
[1:01:38] land, my brothers and sisters.
[1:01:40] Hallelujah. Amen. The bride of Jesus
[1:01:42] Christ is recognizing she don't belong
[1:01:44] here. Jesus said, "This is not my
[1:01:47] world." Amen. This is not my world or my
[1:01:51] subjects would fight for me. But my
[1:01:53] world is a different kingdom. It's a
[1:01:55] different world. And I believe the
[1:01:57] kingdom has come. Hallelujah. Through
[1:01:59] the new birth, through the revelation of
[1:02:01] this hour, and I believe there's a
[1:02:03] people called the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:02:05] that are walking in that kingdom,
[1:02:07] walking in that world with Christ alone.
[1:02:10] Hallelujah. This is not about church, my
[1:02:13] brothers and sisters. Amen. It's not
[1:02:15] about a building or nothing. We are
[1:02:16] gathered together, whether it's here or
[1:02:18] whether it's outside. We're gathered
[1:02:20] under the umbrella of the Holy Ghost,
[1:02:22] the word of God. Amen. No matter who's
[1:02:25] speaking. Amen. is the word of God.
[1:02:28] Glory to God. Now listen to brother
[1:02:31] Brandham here. Now the word revelation
[1:02:35] which means
[1:02:36] unveiling perfectly describes the
[1:02:39] sculpture unveiling his work exposing
[1:02:41] the
[1:02:42] unlooker is uncovering revealing what
[1:02:45] was previously previously hidden.
[1:02:49] Now the uncovering is not only the
[1:02:52] revelation of the person of Christ, but
[1:02:55] it's the revelation of his future works
[1:02:58] in the unccoming seven church ages. The
[1:03:02] importance of revelation by the spirit
[1:03:06] to a true believer can never be
[1:03:09] overemphasized. Hallelujah. There's a
[1:03:11] reason why I'm reading this. Revelation
[1:03:14] means more to you than perhaps you
[1:03:19] realize. He's speaking something here.
[1:03:22] Just like I'm saying this morning. Amen.
[1:03:25] People don't fully understand what faith
[1:03:29] is. Hallelujah. And that's what he's
[1:03:32] saying here. More than you realize.
[1:03:35] Faith means more to you than what you
[1:03:38] realize. I'm not talking about the book
[1:03:41] of Revelations and you. I'm not talking
[1:03:44] about
[1:03:45] Revelations. It's tremendous important
[1:03:48] to the church. I'm talking
[1:03:51] about all
[1:03:53] revelations. Now listen, faith has to
[1:03:57] bring new
[1:03:59] life. Things have to be changed from
[1:04:02] earthly things to heavenly things.
[1:04:04] Faith, what does faith do? It separates
[1:04:07] us. When faith
[1:04:10] comes, so does
[1:04:12] separation. You don't have to separate
[1:04:15] yourself. When faith comes, it separates
[1:04:19] you. It does it
[1:04:21] automatically. Didn't the prophet say,
[1:04:23] "Amen." When Christ comes, it it's a
[1:04:26] life that automatically lives out of
[1:04:28] you. There's no effort. There's no
[1:04:31] strain. There's no pull. There's only a
[1:04:34] surrender yielding our vessels to him.
[1:04:37] Amen.
[1:04:39] Hallelujah. There are deep secrets
[1:04:42] things secret things that are only
[1:04:45] changing inside of the bride of Jesus
[1:04:48] Christ in this hour. What God is doing
[1:04:51] and going to vindicate that token life
[1:04:55] in her. This is a secret catching away.
[1:04:59] This is a secret work that's going
[1:05:01] inside the individual. It's not looking
[1:05:04] at one
[1:05:05] another. I'm afraid that the that like
[1:05:08] even Paul said, comparing one to another
[1:05:11] is, he said, is carnal, but we're still
[1:05:14] doing that. Comparing our spiritual walk
[1:05:17] with another person's spiritual walk.
[1:05:19] Comparing this gift with that gift,
[1:05:22] Amen. It's carnal. You can't
[1:05:25] compare. God broke himself up. Amen. He
[1:05:29] broke up his character, his his
[1:05:32] characteristics, and he broke it up and
[1:05:34] placed it in each individual. We're all
[1:05:37] unique. We're all different. Amen.
[1:05:41] That's why we have to recognize who we
[1:05:42] are. We have to find who we are in
[1:05:45] Christ. Not who I am. You don't need to
[1:05:48] know who I am. You see who I am. More
[1:05:51] and more. You can see who I am in
[1:05:54] Christ. You need to recognize you. your
[1:05:58] individual. Amen. Hallelujah. Revelation
[1:06:03] brings
[1:06:04] life, not
[1:06:06] knowledge. Knowledge is so
[1:06:09] close to revelation that people think
[1:06:13] they got revelation and they got a bunch
[1:06:15] of
[1:06:16] knowledge. The bride can discern that
[1:06:18] and see that. She has that ability
[1:06:22] because knowledge will never produce
[1:06:24] what faith really can produce, which is
[1:06:26] the life of Christ living out of her,
[1:06:31] not your good
[1:06:32] works.
[1:06:34] Amen. Not your good church attendance,
[1:06:37] not even self-control over yourself.
[1:06:40] It's not about self-control. All those
[1:06:42] things are
[1:06:44] respected. Amen. Not drinking, not
[1:06:46] smoking, not swearing, dressing right,
[1:06:49] doing your hair, not cutting your hair.
[1:06:51] All those things are respected. But it's
[1:06:53] not the life of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:06:56] Amen. It's not the true faith of God
[1:06:59] living and expressing out through
[1:07:02] you. That can be all expressed all these
[1:07:06] things through knowledge. But faith is
[1:07:09] not knowledge. It's so close it will
[1:07:12] deceive the very elected. Amen. It's not
[1:07:16] recall. It's not discipline. It's not
[1:07:19] all your sacrifices, which they're all
[1:07:22] respected, but it's not that. It brings
[1:07:25] the life of Christ. You have all these
[1:07:29] things by human effort, but not the life
[1:07:33] of
[1:07:34] Christ. God left that in his own hands.
[1:07:37] Amen. God swore by himself, I'm my own
[1:07:42] interpreter. I will make it plain. I
[1:07:45] don't need you to live my life. Just
[1:07:47] give me your heart. Give me your vessel
[1:07:49] and let me live your my life through
[1:07:52] you. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:07:54] Hallelujah. Do you feel that call? Do
[1:07:57] you feel that hunger? Do you feel that
[1:08:00] thirst inside of you for the life of
[1:08:02] God? Is there something inside of you
[1:08:04] pulling you? Amen. That you want more of
[1:08:07] that life? Hallelujah. That's what faith
[1:08:10] is.
[1:08:13] Amen. Those are good. But revelation
[1:08:17] brings new life. The pillar of fire. The
[1:08:19] logos lives inside of us, possessing us,
[1:08:23] controlling us, leading us and guiding
[1:08:25] us into perfect
[1:08:28] faith, perfect realization of who we
[1:08:31] are. That changes everything in our
[1:08:36] lives. Everything, my brothers and
[1:08:38] sisters.
[1:08:39] Oh,
[1:08:41] God. Brother Brown is speaking
[1:08:47] here. I'm going to get my energy drink
[1:08:50] just to make sure I'm clear this
[1:08:54] time. Hallelujah. It's the rising of the
[1:08:58] sun. All these things are just merely
[1:09:03] traditions. What good would any of it do
[1:09:06] whether you had Lent or not?
[1:09:09] If there's no life in
[1:09:12] you, now we're talking about faith,
[1:09:14] perfect
[1:09:16] faith. It's only a
[1:09:19] memorial, which there's nothing against
[1:09:22] it, but they have certainly carried out
[1:09:25] their
[1:09:25] traditions, but left off the main
[1:09:29] thing. Oh God, help us in this hour. We
[1:09:34] got the word of life. We got the message
[1:09:37] of life of the life of
[1:09:39] Christ. Help us not to leave off the
[1:09:42] main thing.
[1:09:45] Amen.
[1:09:47] Hallelujah. Satan doesn't care. Listen
[1:09:51] to me. I'm going to repeat it. Satan
[1:09:53] doesn't care how religious how messes
[1:09:57] religious you
[1:09:59] are, how right you are in your
[1:10:02] doctrine. If you miss that
[1:10:07] life, if you miss that
[1:10:10] life, you won't come up anyhow. No
[1:10:13] matter how religious, how good, how many
[1:10:17] churches or message churches you join or
[1:10:20] you belong
[1:10:23] to or will belong to, it doesn't matter
[1:10:27] one thing. Unless you have that life,
[1:10:31] unless you are born
[1:10:33] again.
[1:10:35] Hallelujah. One thing that took my heart
[1:10:38] when this word struck me. I I had to
[1:10:42] know I had to know without a shadow of
[1:10:45] doubt that I've been born again.
[1:10:47] Hallelujah. I had to know that I'm I'm
[1:10:50] his and he is mine. No matter how many
[1:10:53] supernatural experiences I had.
[1:10:55] Hallelujah. And over 33 and a half years
[1:10:58] or so, amen, walking with the Lord, he
[1:11:01] has kept me. Amen. He has raised a
[1:11:04] standard when he needs to raise a
[1:11:05] standard. When I have fallen many times,
[1:11:08] he has lifted me up. When I wanted to
[1:11:10] quit, when I wanted to go in the other
[1:11:12] direction, he came and kept me. Amen. I
[1:11:16] was kept by the power of God through
[1:11:19] faith. Through the faith of the new
[1:11:22] birth, I was kept by the power of God.
[1:11:24] Hallelujah. Not of my own works, not of
[1:11:26] my own ability. Amen. I'm not the best
[1:11:29] church attender. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm
[1:11:33] not the best anything when it comes to
[1:11:35] thing. Like Paul says, I'm the chiefest
[1:11:37] of sinners. I make the most mistakes
[1:11:39] here in my own eyes. But he kept me by
[1:11:42] the power of faith. By the power of God,
[1:11:45] he's keeping me this morning. And I will
[1:11:48] press on. I will press on. I will keep
[1:11:52] walking. I will keep moving forward. I
[1:11:55] will keep growing in Christ because of
[1:11:57] him.
[1:11:59] No matter what Satan throws at me.
[1:12:03] Hallelujah. It doesn't matter what he
[1:12:05] throws at me. Amen. God. Cuz I have a
[1:12:09] revelation that God placed a word inside
[1:12:12] of me and that word won't return void. I
[1:12:15] got a revelation that God watches over
[1:12:18] his word. More than anything, he watches
[1:12:21] over his word.
[1:12:22] Hallelujah. It's not about me, my
[1:12:25] feelings, my emotions. Amen. This day
[1:12:27] and age where everybody's feelings get
[1:12:30] hurt. Everybody gets offended. Oh, God.
[1:12:33] My brothers and
[1:12:36] sisters.
[1:12:38] Hallelujah. Pity parties. I've I've been
[1:12:41] there. Feel sorry for
[1:12:43] yourself. I'm nobody. Look at all my
[1:12:47] mistakes. Look at this. Look at that.
[1:12:50] Not about that, my brothers and sisters.
[1:12:52] When the revelation of life, the life of
[1:12:55] Christ comes inside of you, that don't
[1:12:57] mean nothing. This thing will not
[1:12:59] inherit the kingdom of God. This thing
[1:13:01] has to be changed in a moment and a
[1:13:03] trickle in an eye. This thing is what
[1:13:06] faith is separating me from. Hallelujah.
[1:13:09] I can't wait to get out of this thing. I
[1:13:11] can't wait to be translated. God has
[1:13:13] prepared this vessel to be changed in
[1:13:16] this hour. Oh, God. That's what's taking
[1:13:20] place, my brothers and sisters.
[1:13:22] Hallelujah. Are you in the church
[1:13:24] triumphant? Are you in the Savior's
[1:13:27] body? Are you in this rapture this
[1:13:29] morning? Are you being quickened by the
[1:13:32] quickening power of the spirit of God
[1:13:35] this morning? We don't come for a church
[1:13:38] Sunday or Wednesday or Friday. We come
[1:13:40] to hear and be quickened by the word, by
[1:13:43] his spirit. Amen.
[1:13:46] Oh, God. Oh, more and more. More and
[1:13:49] more I need him. Not just church. I need
[1:13:52] him.
[1:13:53] Hallelujah. Glory to
[1:13:56] God.
[1:13:58] Amen. Greatest battle ever
[1:14:01] fought. Come out from amongst your
[1:14:04] people, Abraham. The thing of it is
[1:14:07] they're doubters and
[1:14:08] unbelievers. Have we recognized that
[1:14:10] yet? Have we matured above that yet? I
[1:14:14] love them all. all my family in that.
[1:14:18] But this this revelation that came to
[1:14:21] Abraham is the same revelation that came
[1:14:23] to me. Amen. Abraham, come out from
[1:14:27] amongst your people. Come out from
[1:14:29] amongst the doubters and unbelievers.
[1:14:31] Why?
[1:14:32] Why? Because they'll have you in the
[1:14:34] same condition. Amen. You don't find
[1:14:37] that. You don't find when you're around
[1:14:40] unbelievers and doubters too much and
[1:14:41] you're hanging out with them. Oh, he's
[1:14:43] my best friend from childhood.
[1:14:46] They pull you
[1:14:48] in. They pull you in. Hallelujah.
[1:14:52] Listen, I don't have to preach law. I
[1:14:55] don't have to preach. I don't have to
[1:14:56] preach dos and don'ts. The Holy Ghost
[1:14:59] preaches. If you got the Holy Ghost in
[1:15:01] your life, hallelujah. You got the
[1:15:03] conviction of God in your life. You got
[1:15:04] the life of God in your life. Abraham,
[1:15:07] when Abraham received that faith, what
[1:15:09] did what the Holy Spirit say? Come out.
[1:15:11] The Holy Spirit said, "Come out."
[1:15:13] separate. It's not man that says it.
[1:15:16] It's not law that says it. Holy Ghost
[1:15:19] says
[1:15:21] it. Come out and separate yourself for
[1:15:26] what? And live with
[1:15:28] me. What? You mean I can't live with the
[1:15:32] world and and live with
[1:15:35] Christ? No. No. Come out and live with
[1:15:41] me.
[1:15:43] Hallelujah. Who wants to live with him
[1:15:46] this morning? Who is living with him?
[1:15:49] Hallelujah. Amen. What is
[1:15:53] it? Leave all your conscience and senses
[1:15:57] behind you. We're talking about being
[1:16:00] prepared for this translation. And we we
[1:16:03] we're talking about the mighty angel has
[1:16:06] come
[1:16:06] down. Amen. It's not brother Tim. It's
[1:16:10] not any minister, but the mighty angels
[1:16:12] come down to prepare you for this
[1:16:14] translation, this transition that's
[1:16:17] taking place in your life. Amen.
[1:16:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Your conscience.
[1:16:24] Leave them behind. Open up your mind and
[1:16:27] remember it is
[1:16:29] me. Hallelujah. Jesus is saying, "Open
[1:16:32] up your mind when the word is coming
[1:16:35] forth and remember it's not me, the
[1:16:37] preacher." He's saying is remember it's
[1:16:40] me Christ. It's me speaking to you this
[1:16:43] morning. It's me speaking into your
[1:16:45] heart this morning.
[1:16:47] Hallelujah. Remember it's me. Open up
[1:16:51] your mind and remembers me. Come and
[1:16:53] live with me. Amen. Brother Brand says
[1:16:57] God is calling every seed of Abraham
[1:17:00] this morning to that same kind of what?
[1:17:03] Life.
[1:17:05] That same kind of life. God is calling
[1:17:07] every seed of Abraham this morning.
[1:17:10] Hallelujah. There's a different kind of
[1:17:11] life, amen, that the bride of Jesus
[1:17:14] Christ is living. There's a different
[1:17:15] kind of life that the spirit of
[1:17:17] revelation is revealing to the bride
[1:17:19] this morning, every morning. Amen. Into
[1:17:22] her heart.
[1:17:25] Hallelujah. Amen. The greatest battle is
[1:17:28] on now worldwide. God wants his children
[1:17:31] separating themselves from what?
[1:17:36] see, taste, feel, smell,
[1:17:41] hear. My God, Lord Jesus, help us all,
[1:17:45] even
[1:17:46] myself. This is only the first five
[1:17:49] senses he's asking us to separate from.
[1:17:51] And most of us can't even do that. Most
[1:17:55] of us are led by our
[1:17:56] eyes.
[1:17:58] Smell. You can't fast because as soon as
[1:18:01] you smell
[1:18:03] food, you want to
[1:18:07] eat. You can't hear. You can't hear the
[1:18:09] word of God because you're hearing all
[1:18:11] kinds of other things, all other kinds
[1:18:13] of voices. You can't hear his
[1:18:18] voice. Becoming totally dead to these
[1:18:21] senses brings Christ alive in your life.
[1:18:26] Amen.
[1:18:29] Now we'll go to the the the next
[1:18:31] five and see how we do.
[1:18:38] Imagination conscience, memory, reason,
[1:18:42] affections, and everything. He's
[1:18:44] saying he's saying separate. He said it
[1:18:48] doesn't matter if it does not agree with
[1:18:52] the word of God. Get rid of
[1:18:55] it. Let it go.
[1:18:58] Amen.
[1:19:00] If you want to play church, if you want
[1:19:03] to be religious, you want to be just a
[1:19:06] message believer, you don't have to
[1:19:08] listen to this. But if you want the life
[1:19:10] of Christ inside of you, you want the
[1:19:13] Holy Ghost to possess you, then get rid
[1:19:16] of it. If it doesn't agree with the word
[1:19:18] of God, paralyze it in your life. Bring
[1:19:21] it under subjection to the word of God.
[1:19:24] bring it under subjection to the faith
[1:19:26] that's being revealed to you. It's time
[1:19:29] to take
[1:19:30] control back from the devil. It's time
[1:19:33] to take control of this flesh. It's time
[1:19:36] to take control of our lives and let the
[1:19:39] word have the preeminence.
[1:19:41] They're preaching it out there, my
[1:19:43] brothers and
[1:19:44] sisters. They're preaching it out there.
[1:19:46] Take
[1:19:47] control. Positive mind, all these kind
[1:19:50] of things.
[1:19:51] self-control,
[1:19:53] self-discipline, all these things that's
[1:19:55] leading to nowhere, no purpose, no life.
[1:20:00] Amen. We doing these things as the
[1:20:03] spirit of God reveals to us what? For
[1:20:06] the life of Christ to manifest in our
[1:20:08] lives. Amen. Hallelujah. Listen, if
[1:20:12] you're a son and daughter of God, God is
[1:20:14] going to deal with
[1:20:15] you. He's going to deal with you.
[1:20:18] Hallelujah. if he has to lay you on your
[1:20:21] back. Amen. Whatever sickness has to
[1:20:24] come upon your life, he's going to deal
[1:20:26] with you. Hallelujah. And the greatest
[1:20:29] thing is that if you're a son and
[1:20:30] daughter of God, that's the greatest
[1:20:32] thing that could happen in your life. Do
[1:20:33] you know that God is dealing with you?
[1:20:35] Amen. He's not dealing with everybody
[1:20:38] this morning. I am sorry to say, I don't
[1:20:40] know who it is. That's not for me.
[1:20:43] That's not my position. That's for the
[1:20:45] judge. Amen. But he knows his own. He
[1:20:48] knows every elected seat of God. He know
[1:20:50] all that came out of his mind and all
[1:20:52] that was with him before the foundation
[1:20:54] of the world. And all them will come
[1:20:56] back to him. Amen. And all them that
[1:20:58] will hear his word. Every time they hear
[1:21:00] his word, there's something that's
[1:21:02] pulling on them inside for that kind of
[1:21:04] life. Amen. To pull them back into that
[1:21:07] kind of life. Where we we getting pulled
[1:21:09] back into the the atmospheres of God.
[1:21:12] We're getting pulled back into the other
[1:21:13] dimension where God is. We come from
[1:21:16] God. We go back to God. God is pulling
[1:21:19] us back up, my brothers and sisters.
[1:21:24] Hallelujah. What a revelation that is
[1:21:27] breaking. Amen. The capstone revelation
[1:21:30] in this hour. The mighty angel is only
[1:21:33] revealing it to his own. Those who are
[1:21:37] elected for the rapture. Yes. Everybody
[1:21:40] else will hear the prophet's voice on
[1:21:41] those tapes.
[1:21:47] But the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:21:51] will hear the mighty angel's voice in
[1:21:53] this hour.
[1:21:56] If you can't figure that out, my
[1:21:58] brothers and
[1:21:59] sisters, then forgive me. But this is
[1:22:02] the
[1:22:04] truth. A lot of things that are preached
[1:22:06] are in mysteries and parables, but the
[1:22:08] Holy Spirit will reveal it. If you're
[1:22:10] walking with the the word of God, you're
[1:22:12] walking with the spirit of God in this
[1:22:13] hour. You're walking with the spirit of
[1:22:15] revelation. He's speaking to you. Not
[1:22:17] just when you come
[1:22:18] here. No, he's speaking to you all the
[1:22:21] time. He lives inside of you. He's
[1:22:23] showing you things to come. He's
[1:22:24] revealing things to you in the week in
[1:22:27] the deadness of the hour of the midnight
[1:22:29] hour. He's speaking to you. He wakes you
[1:22:31] up. He speaks to you. You're washing
[1:22:33] dishes. You're driving car. No matter
[1:22:35] what you're doing, the Holy Ghost is
[1:22:37] revealing. Amen. Revelation after
[1:22:39] revelation. Amen. You're walking up
[1:22:42] Jacob's ladder like this. The word of
[1:22:44] God is constantly
[1:22:46] unfolding. He's not decreasing.
[1:22:50] Amen. The prophet is
[1:22:51] decreasing. But Jesus Christ is
[1:22:54] increasing in the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:22:57] He's increasing in this hour.
[1:23:00] Oh,
[1:23:01] hallelujah. We thank God for all the men
[1:23:05] of God, but we It's
[1:23:08] him. Hallelujah. Open up your
[1:23:13] mind to let every word of God come and
[1:23:17] march that word. That's a real
[1:23:20] soldier. Not what's been written, not
[1:23:23] the written word. It's the life of
[1:23:26] Christ that comes out of the written
[1:23:28] word. Amen. In this hour.
[1:23:33] Hallelujah.
[1:23:35] Yes. Greatest battle ever fought.
[1:23:38] Let us move on here. Got a lot more to
[1:23:41] say.
[1:23:43] Amen. This great
[1:23:46] battle, you know, somebody told me, you
[1:23:50] know,
[1:23:51] relax. It's all by
[1:23:53] grace. I, you know, I I know it's all by
[1:23:56] grace. I believe in grace. If it wasn't
[1:23:59] for grace, where would I be? But see,
[1:24:02] when grace is spoken without any
[1:24:04] understanding of what real grace is, I
[1:24:06] don't like it.
[1:24:08] Okay. Because I know it's all by grace.
[1:24:10] But I also know that we're in a
[1:24:13] battle. I'm in a battle. Oh yeah. I'm in
[1:24:17] a battle between life and death. And
[1:24:20] that will never stop until I'm out of
[1:24:23] here. Amen. I experience rest. I
[1:24:26] experience grace. I experience peace.
[1:24:28] It's always in here. The storm could be
[1:24:31] raging on the outside, but there's all
[1:24:33] peace and calmness here because Jesus is
[1:24:36] in the boat. Hallelujah. Amen. But I
[1:24:40] believe there's a great battle going on
[1:24:41] and it will continue to go on. And I
[1:24:43] believe if you're not in this battle,
[1:24:45] then Satan's got
[1:24:47] you. He's got you. Hallelujah.
[1:24:51] And here we are preaching the word of
[1:24:53] God. Maybe something will happen. When
[1:24:55] the word of God is coming forth, when
[1:24:57] it's being preached, no matter who's
[1:24:59] preaching it, it will shake you.
[1:25:01] Something will happen to wake you up. I
[1:25:04] believe this morning there's people that
[1:25:06] need to be woken up
[1:25:10] spiritually, not religiously, but
[1:25:12] spiritually woken up to this battle
[1:25:15] that's taking place that's happening
[1:25:17] around us. Hallelujah. And if you're a
[1:25:20] son and daughter of God, you're
[1:25:21] predestinated. Amen. God is determined
[1:25:24] to wake you up.
[1:25:26] Amen.
[1:25:30] Hallelujah. What is the
[1:25:33] Satan's
[1:25:34] weapon is
[1:25:37] disbelief. To get you to disbelieve your
[1:25:42] weapon. To disbelieve who you are and
[1:25:46] what God says you are in this hour.
[1:25:48] That's Satan's greatest weapon. That's
[1:25:51] what we battle. No matter what battle
[1:25:54] comes in our lives, it's always to make
[1:25:58] us disbelieve who we are. Satan will
[1:26:01] come and say, "Oh, yeah, this is a
[1:26:03] brother. He's a He's anointed brother of
[1:26:05] God. This is a daughter of God. This is
[1:26:07] a son of God. But who are
[1:26:11] you? Come
[1:26:13] on. You're that word. Really? You're
[1:26:17] that word?
[1:26:22] But you know what, my brothers and
[1:26:23] sisters, there's such a a perfect faith.
[1:26:26] That's why they call it perfect faith.
[1:26:28] Perfect realization that's taking place
[1:26:30] right
[1:26:31] now. Is a five-fold ministry doing that
[1:26:34] work?
[1:26:36] No. No man can do that
[1:26:40] work. Only the only he can do that work.
[1:26:44] put that perfect faith realization
[1:26:47] inside of you. So that you come to a
[1:26:49] place when these battles come your
[1:26:51] way, you go, "Oh, it's just you,
[1:26:56] Satan." Hallelujah. It's just you,
[1:26:58] Satan. Just you trying to make me
[1:27:00] disbelieve this, make me disbelieve who
[1:27:03] I am. Get behind me, Satan. Isn't that
[1:27:06] what we're commanded to do? Resist the
[1:27:08] devil. Resist the unbelief. And he shall
[1:27:11] flee.
[1:27:12] Hallelujah.
[1:27:15] Amen. Glory to God. Most of the times we
[1:27:18] come in here instead of receiving the
[1:27:19] word of God. We come in here
[1:27:21] condemned. We come in here with
[1:27:23] condemnation. We come in here with guilt
[1:27:25] upon us. And God tries to break that and
[1:27:29] break that and break that so that you
[1:27:32] can receive something of who you are. So
[1:27:35] that you can receive something to
[1:27:37] recognize who you are. so that you can
[1:27:39] get strength and stand as a son and
[1:27:42] daughter of God in this hour. Built up
[1:27:46] built up in this word, built up in Jesus
[1:27:49] Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:27:52] And Satan's weapon against you, he's
[1:27:55] trying to get you to disbelieve your
[1:27:57] weapon. If he does, he disarms
[1:28:01] you. Let's listen.
[1:28:04] If he can get you to disbelieve your
[1:28:07] weapon, that it's no
[1:28:11] good, that your weapon ain't strong
[1:28:14] enough. Oh man, that's a that's a big
[1:28:16] one. That's a big one. You look at the
[1:28:20] things in your life right now. You look
[1:28:22] at the challenges in your life. You look
[1:28:24] at the weaknesses in your life. You look
[1:28:27] at where you are in your life, the
[1:28:29] condition that you are in your life.
[1:28:31] The first thing he's going to come to do
[1:28:33] is take that word and say it's not
[1:28:35] strong enough for you to
[1:28:38] overcome. You don't got enough of that
[1:28:41] faith that he's talking about this
[1:28:43] morning inside of you to
[1:28:46] overcome. Then you should have a
[1:28:48] desperation inside of
[1:28:50] you. I want that faith. Listen, when I
[1:28:54] was overcoming things in my life that I
[1:28:57] needed
[1:28:57] God, listen, I let nothing get in the
[1:29:00] way of it. I'm going to tell you how it
[1:29:03] came for me. Everybody comes a little
[1:29:05] different, but I'm telling you, some
[1:29:06] things never change. E, and Brother
[1:29:09] Brand, Matthew, he preached the token
[1:29:10] message. He preached desperation. I'm
[1:29:13] sorry. Desperation will never change in
[1:29:15] our lives. And I knew I needed faith for
[1:29:19] deliverance. I knew I needed more faith.
[1:29:23] Hallelujah for for change in my life. So
[1:29:27] I got desperate. I put everything aside.
[1:29:30] Everything came second best in my life.
[1:29:33] Everything. God became first. And let me
[1:29:36] tell you when you really truly put God
[1:29:39] first. Not say you do. I don't God don't
[1:29:43] care. And a real child of God don't care
[1:29:45] about your lip service. don't care how
[1:29:48] much you brag on how good you are and
[1:29:49] how it works and how much you read your
[1:29:51] Bible and all that. That don't mean
[1:29:53] nothing to God. Then he say that oh
[1:29:57] their their outward doings, Amen, with
[1:29:59] their hands and their works, but their
[1:30:00] hearts are far from me. And did the Lord
[1:30:04] say that? The Lord knows the heart. He
[1:30:07] knows deep down in the heart when you
[1:30:10] really put God first in your life.
[1:30:12] Hallelujah. And you get desperate. That
[1:30:15] is between life and death. The prophet
[1:30:17] said that you need God, you need
[1:30:20] deliverance, you need a change in your
[1:30:23] life, God will come and meet that need
[1:30:26] right there, that desire, that that
[1:30:30] desperation. He never rejects a
[1:30:32] desperate heart.
[1:30:34] Amen. Oh, God. I don't know why I'm
[1:30:36] going off on all this. There's none of
[1:30:38] my notes. I'm trying to move here in in
[1:30:41] in such a way to try to figure out
[1:30:43] something here. Amen. God is just moving
[1:30:45] me in different directions this morning.
[1:30:47] God, I believe, is speaking to somebody.
[1:30:49] Amen. God's trying to get a hold of
[1:30:51] somebody's heart, somebody's life this
[1:30:54] morning. And tell them, Amen. What
[1:30:57] you're feeding off, what you think is
[1:30:58] faith is not faith. Faith is the life.
[1:31:01] My life when it comes inside of you.
[1:31:05] Hallelujah.
[1:31:07] Hallelujah. Amen. The great hour charge
[1:31:09] is at hand. Faith and doubt sitting in
[1:31:14] their self array this morning in this
[1:31:17] tabernacle I believe is here this
[1:31:19] morning. Faith and doubt is sitting on
[1:31:22] everybody's heart this morning.
[1:31:24] Hallelujah. Amen. Doubt on one side,
[1:31:27] faith on the other. Soldiers, stand at
[1:31:30] your post of duty. Our captain of the
[1:31:33] morning star, Amen. I can say the mighty
[1:31:36] angel, Amen, is here. He never goes
[1:31:41] back. He don't know the word
[1:31:44] retreat. He don't have to retreat. She's
[1:31:48] going right on in here now. See the
[1:31:51] battle? Yes, sir. Between life and
[1:31:53] death, between sickness and health,
[1:31:56] between faith and death. Oh my. Between
[1:31:59] liberty and bondage. The battle is on
[1:32:02] this morning, my brothers and sisters.
[1:32:04] I'm not just reading a
[1:32:05] quote. This is reality here this
[1:32:08] morning.
[1:32:10] If you can break into the spirit. Amen.
[1:32:12] Break into Christ desperation. Amen. And
[1:32:15] realize this is taking place this
[1:32:17] morning. Lord, I'm here this morning.
[1:32:22] Lord, show me, reveal to me, Lord, where
[1:32:25] I'm at in my walk with you, oh God, draw
[1:32:28] me closer. Amen. You leave these doors.
[1:32:32] Amen. The same people you came in, what
[1:32:35] happens? Death takes place.
[1:32:38] Amen. The the tree that's by the water.
[1:32:40] Amen. It rottens quicker. Your life will
[1:32:44] rotten quicker. Amen. You want to leave
[1:32:48] outside of these doors with your heart
[1:32:50] burning with inside of you because you
[1:32:52] came in contact with Jesus Christ with
[1:32:56] real faith this morning.
[1:32:58] [Music]
[1:33:00] Hallelujah.
[1:33:02] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. I don't know how
[1:33:04] much you got to pound it in by the
[1:33:06] spirit of God. Amen. Your message
[1:33:08] believing and your message coming to a
[1:33:10] message church, you're believing in God
[1:33:12] sent a prophet ain't going to do nothing
[1:33:14] for you on that day. Unless I see the
[1:33:16] token, unless I see the blood, I'll pass
[1:33:19] over you. Is that's what we want this
[1:33:22] morning. Stop letting Satan put a screen
[1:33:25] smoke screen over your life from getting
[1:33:28] to Christ, from getting to that life,
[1:33:31] from getting to that token. Amen.
[1:33:35] Sell
[1:33:36] everything. Leave everything in your
[1:33:38] life. Get Christ. Amen. Whatever it
[1:33:41] takes. What's more
[1:33:43] important? What's more important to you
[1:33:46] than Christ? Getting that token of this
[1:33:49] hour. What can what compares to
[1:33:52] Christ? To the word of God. Hallelujah.
[1:33:56] Hallelujah.
[1:33:58] Oh my. My my brothers and sisters, God
[1:34:00] knows what he's doing this morning. I
[1:34:01] don't I really don't.
[1:34:06] Hallelujah. Oh
[1:34:09] my. Let me skip over some stuff here.
[1:34:12] Thank you,
[1:34:14] Lord. Hallelujah. This battle has been
[1:34:18] raising raging since the prophet
[1:34:20] proclaimed God's word in these last days
[1:34:23] about the bride of Jesus Christ becoming
[1:34:26] the very image of the word made flesh
[1:34:29] again to fulfill the prophecies of the
[1:34:31] body change. Oh yeah this he hates that.
[1:34:36] Satan hates that. Hallelujah. This
[1:34:39] battle is raging and being won and
[1:34:43] overcome by the word of God that's in
[1:34:45] the bride of Jesus Christ. Oh yes, it's
[1:34:48] being won. There is overcomers.
[1:34:51] Amen. There's overcomers here this
[1:34:53] morning. Amen. Even now as we're
[1:34:57] speaking, the spirit of God is in
[1:35:00] individuals overcoming.
[1:35:03] Hallelujah. Amen. and taken her position
[1:35:05] in the capstone and God's appointed time
[1:35:09] perfect faith will accomplish finish in
[1:35:12] her and bring the final climax of the
[1:35:14] body change the rapture.
[1:35:21] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Jesus said in
[1:35:25] uh Luke
[1:35:27] 18:8, he asked when the son of man comes
[1:35:30] back will he find faith?
[1:35:32] Oh, he finds a lot of message churches.
[1:35:34] He finds a message, a lot of knowledge,
[1:35:36] a lot of intellectual knowledge, a lot
[1:35:38] of education. Yeah, right here in the
[1:35:40] message. A lot of educated preachers.
[1:35:43] Amen. A lot of knowledge preachers. But
[1:35:46] will I find
[1:35:48] faith? What do you think he was
[1:35:51] saying? Who was speaking?
[1:35:55] Jesus. What was he saying? Well, I find
[1:35:57] faith.
[1:35:59] He
[1:36:01] knows. He doesn't have to ask. He
[1:36:04] knows. Will I find my
[1:36:07] life living in individuals when I come
[1:36:11] back? It's my life I'm looking for.
[1:36:14] He ain't looking for nothing else. I'm
[1:36:16] looking for the token, the door, the
[1:36:18] blood, the Old Testament over the
[1:36:20] doorpost. The death angel will pass when
[1:36:22] he sees the blood. You think that's
[1:36:24] changed?
[1:36:27] You think because you believe that God
[1:36:29] sent a prophet and you're in a message
[1:36:31] and you have the capability to reading
[1:36:33] and listen to the message tapes that
[1:36:35] means that blood is over the doorpost of
[1:36:37] your
[1:36:38] heart. And you're still living for
[1:36:41] yourself. You're living for your own
[1:36:43] desires, your own pleasures of this
[1:36:45] life.
[1:36:49] Hallelujah. You're living for your your
[1:36:52] own purposes, your own plans. It's not
[1:36:55] I'll make my plans and God will get into
[1:36:57] them and change them because I give him
[1:36:58] the preeminence. But I'll make my plans
[1:37:00] and I Lord will you get into my plans.
[1:37:03] Will you will you will you do what I
[1:37:06] want to be to be done in my life? I want
[1:37:09] to go here. You know I I I it's true.
[1:37:13] It's true when they say I feel led to do
[1:37:15] this. Yeah, you do feel led to do that.
[1:37:17] Not the Lord leading you to do that. You
[1:37:20] feel led to do all these kind of things
[1:37:22] in your life. But it never never you
[1:37:24] never get led to to surrender your life
[1:37:26] to Jesus Christ. You never get led to
[1:37:29] commit your life to Jesus
[1:37:32] Christ. You never get led, Amen, to
[1:37:36] surrender all to Jesus Christ. But you
[1:37:39] get led and you want God to to be in
[1:37:41] your
[1:37:42] leading, in your leading, in your
[1:37:46] guiding, not
[1:37:48] his. Hallelujah.
[1:37:51] Man's ability to understand God is
[1:37:55] zero. Isaiah
[1:37:57] 55. For my thoughts are not your
[1:37:59] thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,
[1:38:02] sayeth the Lord. For the heavens are
[1:38:03] higher than the earth, so are my ways
[1:38:06] higher than your ways, and my thoughts
[1:38:08] than your thoughts. Proverbs 3:5, "Trust
[1:38:11] in the Lord with all thy heart. Lean not
[1:38:14] to thy own understanding, and all thy
[1:38:16] ways acknowledge him, and he shall
[1:38:18] direct thy path. I didn't know that the
[1:38:21] scripture was going to come up next that
[1:38:22] I had there. Hallelujah. But God knows.
[1:38:26] God knows what he's speaking here. God
[1:38:28] knows what he's doing here. I'm just I'm
[1:38:30] just a vessel to to speak what he wants
[1:38:34] me to speak. Amen. Let the word go
[1:38:36] forth. Amen. And let it land in the good
[1:38:39] ground that is supposed to land in today
[1:38:42] and produce fruit, produce the life of
[1:38:45] Christ, produce change in our lives this
[1:38:48] morning. Amen.
[1:38:50] Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:38:54] Hallelujah. Amen. Listen, my brothers,
[1:38:57] sisters, faith is not by your own
[1:39:00] education, your own reasoning, your own
[1:39:02] own ability to figure things out,
[1:39:05] comparing scripture with scripture,
[1:39:07] comparing quotes with quotes and all
[1:39:09] these things because man doing that
[1:39:13] always
[1:39:15] misinterprets, misplaces, and
[1:39:18] misrepresents the word of God.
[1:39:21] Listen, we talk about there's uh how how
[1:39:24] many thousands or whatever denominations
[1:39:26] out there and how many different truths
[1:39:28] out there. You talk about that serpent
[1:39:30] that brother Brandon tried to cut off,
[1:39:32] but he's seen it get into the message.
[1:39:34] What about the message? How many
[1:39:37] different doctrines are out there? How
[1:39:39] many different interpretations are out
[1:39:42] there? Oh
[1:39:44] my. God is not the author of
[1:39:47] confusion. Amen.
[1:39:49] The spirit of God is the same spirit.
[1:39:52] Amen. That reveals truth. Amen. He's not
[1:39:56] the author of confusion. All this
[1:39:58] confusion out there is because there's a
[1:40:00] lack of
[1:40:01] faith. Lack of real faith. Comparing
[1:40:04] scriptures and quotes and having a
[1:40:06] having an even having an understanding
[1:40:08] of the
[1:40:10] mysteries is not real
[1:40:12] faith. Amen.
[1:40:15] Faith is the life of Christ. When Christ
[1:40:18] is inside you, his life, he interprets
[1:40:21] his word.
[1:40:24] Amen. He won't misplace it, but he'll
[1:40:27] divide the truth. Rightfully, divide the
[1:40:30] truth and speak the same thing. I
[1:40:32] believe the bride with the spirit of
[1:40:34] Christ in her is speaking the same thing
[1:40:36] in this hour. Amen. No matter where she
[1:40:40] is around the world, it's not everybody
[1:40:42] in the message, but those who are
[1:40:44] anointed of the word of God, of the
[1:40:46] revelation of what God is doing in this
[1:40:50] hour. It's present truth.
[1:40:55] Hallelujah. Today,
[1:40:57] 2025, this written word, this written
[1:41:00] message has got to be revealing. It's
[1:41:03] got to be opening up. Present truth has
[1:41:06] got to be revealing to us those seven
[1:41:09] thunders has got to be start thundering
[1:41:11] my brothers and sisters bringing that
[1:41:14] faith that rapture and faith that life
[1:41:16] of Christ inside of her to such a place
[1:41:19] that this body can't contain him
[1:41:23] anymore.
[1:41:25] Hallelujah. Oh
[1:41:28] God.
[1:41:30] Hallelujah. The birth is a messy thing.
[1:41:34] It's a messy
[1:41:36] thing. It's between life and
[1:41:38] death.
[1:41:40] Hallelujah. God didn't make me a
[1:41:42] preacher to preach nice things, make you
[1:41:45] feel good, pat you on the back.
[1:41:48] Amen. Hallelujah. Sometimes a sword is
[1:41:51] swinging. That's the way God built me.
[1:41:53] Everyone has a part in the body. God
[1:41:55] built me that way. Amen. I don't know
[1:41:58] why I, but I see life and death. I I see
[1:42:01] this is this is I preach real
[1:42:04] experience. I preach the experience that
[1:42:07] I have of God, what God is revealing to
[1:42:09] me. I preach a God that's real to me and
[1:42:12] how he's showing me. Amen. And he I I I
[1:42:16] don't want to be up here. A real
[1:42:18] minister of God. It's an awful place to
[1:42:21] be up here. It's an awful thing we go
[1:42:23] through before we get up here and after
[1:42:25] we get down from here. Like brother
[1:42:28] Brand says, I'd rather be down there
[1:42:29] receiving eternal life than being up
[1:42:30] here and going through what we go
[1:42:32] through. But God portioned that in me. I
[1:42:37] can't do nothing. The more the life of
[1:42:39] Christ comes inside of me, the more I
[1:42:41] got to stand up here and project that
[1:42:43] life that he's revealing to me.
[1:42:46] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. I'm not going to
[1:42:49] answer on that day, my brothers and
[1:42:51] sisters. Amen. A as a a preacher to pat
[1:42:54] you on the back. Amen. Oh God, help me.
[1:42:58] Help each and every one of us that
[1:43:00] preach this word. Hallelujah. That tell
[1:43:03] you the truth in your face. You need to
[1:43:05] repent. You need to be born again. I
[1:43:08] don't care about being in the message.
[1:43:10] You need that new birth. You need to die
[1:43:13] out. You need to get it. If it's the
[1:43:16] only thing in your life you get, get it.
[1:43:18] Brother Ram says, get that life inside
[1:43:21] of you.
[1:43:23] Don't stop. He says, "Don't stop for
[1:43:27] nothing, but get that life inside of
[1:43:28] you. Get out of your comfort zone. Get
[1:43:32] out of your okay. None of us are okay.
[1:43:36] We're in a battle here between life and
[1:43:38] death.
[1:43:41] Hallelujah. Oh
[1:43:46] my. God is
[1:43:49] determined and prepared to bring his
[1:43:51] word to pass in us by faith.
[1:43:54] Faith is
[1:43:56] everything. Without faith, it is
[1:43:58] impossible to please
[1:44:00] God. All things are made known and
[1:44:02] revealed to the bride of Jesus Christ by
[1:44:07] faith. Peter knew that Jesus was the
[1:44:10] Christ by faith. John 16:13, "When the
[1:44:15] spirit of truth comes, it will guide you
[1:44:16] and lead you to all truth and make known
[1:44:19] to the bride of Jesus Christ who she
[1:44:21] is."
[1:44:22] The capstone
[1:44:24] revelation that reveals new knowledge or
[1:44:28] revelation of God's plan at the end time
[1:44:32] revelation. The capstone is the final
[1:44:34] cap off of all revelations to complete
[1:44:36] perfect faith in the
[1:44:38] bride. And she is predestinated to
[1:44:41] fulfill because she is the final voice
[1:44:45] to the final age.
[1:44:49] But she needs to be under that
[1:44:51] revelation of his life to be that
[1:44:54] voice. Not because you quote brother
[1:44:56] Brandham and you say what he says makes
[1:45:00] you the final
[1:45:01] voice. No, you know, you're taking away
[1:45:03] from the word of
[1:45:05] God. You're pointing people to different
[1:45:08] directions and not pointing them to
[1:45:10] Christ. It is not it's not the written
[1:45:13] word. It's the life that's written. is
[1:45:17] not written or could never be
[1:45:19] impersonated by Satan and his followers.
[1:45:24] Hallelujah. Amen. This
[1:45:28] spirit that was in the
[1:45:30] prophet spoke out and says, "I'll ride
[1:45:33] this trail
[1:45:34] again." Amen. This other words, this
[1:45:36] life that was living inside of me that
[1:45:39] took me and m matured me into a son of
[1:45:43] God and brought me to that place of full
[1:45:46] surrender to Christ will ride in the
[1:45:48] bride of Jesus Christ in this hour. He's
[1:45:50] not coming back, my brothers and
[1:45:52] sisters. There's a bunch of foolishness.
[1:45:55] People believe in
[1:45:56] that.
[1:45:58] Hallelujah.
[1:46:01] Amen. Hallelujah. Let me just skip over
[1:46:04] things here.
[1:46:08] Hallelujah. Brother Brandon, speak here
[1:46:10] now. The Holy Spirit is here on
[1:46:12] earth looking out those individuals that
[1:46:16] God has ordained to life in this
[1:46:19] age. Not the Leoian age as we know, but
[1:46:23] the rapture age, the bride age, the
[1:46:25] capstone age. And as soon as he finds
[1:46:28] it, he does just like he did on Jesus
[1:46:32] Christ, the great super son of God who
[1:46:35] redeemed all of
[1:46:36] us and comes down and takes his place
[1:46:40] and abro abroads into human
[1:46:43] life. Amen. And now notice brought the
[1:46:48] quickening power.
[1:46:51] Now that quickening power that comes
[1:46:54] upon Jesus quicken him to manifest every
[1:46:57] promise of the word for his day. So does
[1:47:01] the Holy Spirit come upon us in this
[1:47:04] day. And it's not a mockery of the Holy
[1:47:07] Spirit if it's not I if it's not the
[1:47:11] devil mocking the Holy Spirit, but it is
[1:47:14] real true Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:47:18] What he's talking about there is that
[1:47:20] people are just mocking the real Holy
[1:47:22] Spirit and the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:47:24] Remember who's going to come against the
[1:47:26] bride that is prophesied to come against
[1:47:28] the bride? It's people right here in the
[1:47:31] message. They're going to come against
[1:47:33] the bride because they're going to come
[1:47:34] against that life. Satan hates that
[1:47:38] life,
[1:47:40] right? Hallelujah.
[1:47:43] Amen. When it fell upon Luther, it
[1:47:47] manifested that promise of the hour.
[1:47:49] When it fell upon Wesley, it manifested
[1:47:51] that promise of the hour. When it falls
[1:47:53] in this day, it manifested the promise
[1:47:55] of this hour. When it fell upon Moses,
[1:47:59] it manifested the promise of that hour.
[1:48:02] Fell upon Noah, same thing. It
[1:48:04] manifested the promise of that hour.
[1:48:06] When it fell upon Jesus, it manifested
[1:48:09] the promise of that hour. It's the Holy
[1:48:11] Spirit coming down quickened and made
[1:48:14] alive to those people that have been
[1:48:17] fore orained by God to be in the
[1:48:21] rapture.
[1:48:23] Amen. Look what we've seen in this day.
[1:48:28] The quickening power has come to us. The
[1:48:31] opening of the seven
[1:48:32] seals. What was it? The intelligence of
[1:48:36] men?
[1:48:37] No, the quickening power of God. See,
[1:48:41] the quickening power of God foretold
[1:48:43] this would take place. See, the
[1:48:45] quickening power made the world testify
[1:48:49] that it is the truth. Oh, there's still
[1:48:52] another mighty short quick work, a a
[1:48:55] mighty manifestation that God is going
[1:48:57] to do in the bride of Jesus Christ. God
[1:49:00] is preparing a bride right now. Amen.
[1:49:03] For that mighty move of God. And the
[1:49:06] very seventh angels which represents the
[1:49:08] seven church ages all completed. We
[1:49:11] couldn't even see it. They did they took
[1:49:14] the picture not us. They were standing
[1:49:18] there. You see who was it? The supreme
[1:49:21] judge showing that he is the alpha, the
[1:49:24] omega, the beginning, the end. What
[1:49:27] identification? Quickening power did
[1:49:29] that to us. Quickening power lets us see
[1:49:32] his coming. Quickening power snatches us
[1:49:35] from death to life. Quickening power
[1:49:38] gives discernment to know what's right
[1:49:40] and what's wrong. What to do and what
[1:49:42] not to do. What has to be done and what
[1:49:45] ought not to be done. What should be
[1:49:47] done quick and empower and all these
[1:49:50] things as I invite the musicians up.
[1:49:52] There's a lot more to say.
[1:49:55] Hallelujah. As I close it off.
[1:49:59] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:50:02] I just got nothing left. I'm being
[1:50:04] honest with you, my brothers and
[1:50:05] sisters. I got nothing left inside of
[1:50:10] me. Everything's been taken out of me.
[1:50:17] Hallelujah. But that's good. Somebody
[1:50:19] received something.
[1:50:22] [Applause]
[1:50:32] Okay. We're not to come together and
[1:50:34] talk about the
[1:50:35] message. We're to come together and get
[1:50:37] in the message. The message is Christ.
[1:50:41] He is the
[1:50:42] word. We're to get beneath it, in
[1:50:47] it. He's not responsible for anybody
[1:50:49] outside of it, any person out from
[1:50:53] underneath the blood. No matter what,
[1:50:57] he's not responsible. You hear me this
[1:51:00] morning? All had to take not only
[1:51:02] himself, but this whole
[1:51:05] family. There's only one safe spot is
[1:51:08] under that
[1:51:09] token.
[1:51:11] Hallelujah. 1 Corinthians 5:50. Now this
[1:51:16] I say, brethren, that flesh and blood
[1:51:19] cannot inherit the kingdom of God,
[1:51:21] neither do corruption inherit
[1:51:23] incorruption. Behold, I show you a
[1:51:25] mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we
[1:51:27] shall be changed,
[1:51:29] transformed in a moment, in the twinkle
[1:51:31] of an eye, at the last trump. For the
[1:51:34] trumpet shall sound, and I believe it's
[1:51:36] sounded. Hallelujah. And the dead shall
[1:51:39] rise. I believe dead are rising, coming
[1:51:42] to life,
[1:51:45] incorruptible, and we shall be
[1:51:48] changed in a moment, in a twinkling of
[1:51:50] an eye. Let us stand.
[1:51:56] Hallelujah. God bless you
[1:51:59] saints.
[1:52:01] Hallelujah. Thank the Lord for his grace
[1:52:04] this
[1:52:05] morning.
[1:52:08] Father, just have your way this morning,
[1:52:13] Father. I gave everything I could give,
[1:52:16] Father, but I can't give I can't give
[1:52:19] what's needed, Lord.
[1:52:22] Let their hearts leave burning with
[1:52:25] inside of them.
[1:52:27] Lord, that the quickening power
[1:52:29] quickened them.
[1:52:32] Father, your word went forth and healed
[1:52:34] the people, delivered the
[1:52:38] people. Have your way now. Father, I
[1:52:41] commit each and everyone in your hands
[1:52:43] in Jesus name.
[1:52:46] [Applause]
[1:52:49] Amen. Praise God.
[1:52:52] Jesus is
[1:52:58] passing. Hallelujah. He wants to pass
[1:53:01] his way
[1:53:03] today. Is there anyone that has a need
[1:53:05] here today? Amen. Praise God. I see so
[1:53:09] many uplifted hands. Glory to
[1:53:12] God. Did he speak to your heart today?
[1:53:16] Did he say, "Let me in. Let me have all
[1:53:21] of you. Let
[1:53:23] me be your absolute. Amen. Praise God.
[1:53:27] He's still the
[1:53:28] same. He's an He's a
[1:53:31] healer. Glory to God.
[1:53:37] Amen. Brother Desmond, do we have oil
[1:53:43] here? Praise
[1:53:46] God. Hallelujah.
[1:53:49] Sister Joy, if you want to
[1:53:51] come forth, I'm going to pray for you.
[1:53:54] [Music]
[1:53:58] Sister, be in prayer,
[1:54:01] saints. If there's something you have
[1:54:03] need of this
[1:54:05] afternoon, say, "Lord, remember
[1:54:08] me. I need a touch from you." Praise
[1:54:12] God. Yes. Come and anoint our sister. We
[1:54:17] have it, brother Desmond. We're fine.
[1:54:19] [Music]
[1:54:24] Come. The Bible says in James
[1:54:28] that if they be sick or afflicted that
[1:54:32] they can come to the elders of the
[1:54:34] church. They can be
[1:54:36] anointed with oil which is a
[1:54:40] representation of Jesus
[1:54:43] Christ. And we are his representatives.
[1:54:46] He dwells and lives within us
[1:54:51] today. Joy, do you believe the word?
[1:54:54] Amen. We've anointed you with oil.
[1:54:56] You've been having severe pain in your
[1:55:01] neck. Father, Lord, as the elders of the
[1:55:05] church, according to thy word, we lay
[1:55:07] hands upon our sister. We've anointed
[1:55:09] her, oh God. And in the name of Jesus
[1:55:12] Christ, may your spirit come Lord and
[1:55:15] touch her neck, touch her body, every
[1:55:19] muscle, every atom, every molecule
[1:55:22] that's been afflicted, that's been
[1:55:24] affected by this pain. Dissolve now in
[1:55:28] the name of Jesus Christ and be made
[1:55:31] perfectly whole and give the
[1:55:35] glory unto the Lord Jesus Christ. joy go
[1:55:39] and let the joy of the Lord be your
[1:55:41] strength in Jesus name. Amen. Praise
[1:55:45] God.
[1:55:51] Amen. There was many uplifted hands.
[1:55:54] Glory to God. Father, you saw every
[1:55:57] uplifted hand here today. Lord, we know
[1:56:00] that you're you're mindful, Lord. You're
[1:56:03] you're desiring, Lord, that we should
[1:56:06] ask. And Lord God, in the name of Jesus
[1:56:09] Christ, every uplifted heart, every
[1:56:12] desire that's according to your will,
[1:56:15] Lord, may you come down and rest upon
[1:56:19] those hearts and lives this afternoon,
