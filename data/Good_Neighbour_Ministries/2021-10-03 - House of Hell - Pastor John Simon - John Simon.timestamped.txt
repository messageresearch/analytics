[38:55] be seated thank you very much
[38:57] worshipping worship team god bless every
[39:00] one of you musicians
[39:03] worship leader they both have different
[39:05] styles but it's the same holy spirit
[39:08] praise god hallelujah so be thankful to
[39:11] god for that
[39:13] you're conscious
[39:15] or you ought to be conscious and aware
[39:18] that
[39:20] though
[39:21] we are
[39:22] having these services here
[39:26] of course all our believers can't be
[39:28] here
[39:29] um
[39:30] for various reasons age
[39:33] immune immune problems
[39:36] uh stuff of that nature
[39:38] aged or whatever else
[39:41] but we are
[39:44] make sure
[39:48] talk to them
[39:53] that
[39:55] these services
[39:56] are not just local
[39:59] but um
[40:00] we we are certainly getting
[40:02] communications from various nations
[40:06] and recently we got some uh
[40:09] communication coming from in florida
[40:12] some of our spanish brethren there they
[40:15] weren't sure whether we are believers of
[40:17] the message of brother william marion
[40:20] branham
[40:22] and so i'm deliberately and purposely
[40:24] saying it right now so that uh they will
[40:27] be aware and conscious
[40:30] of who we are
[40:31] and what we believe
[40:34] and preach and teach
[40:37] veteran amen
[40:37] colombia in different parts of of the
[40:41] world
[40:42] in the uh you know they're watching
[40:45] or they watch the program uh when it
[40:48] goes out praise the lord so we are not
[40:51] just a blessing to you here
[40:55] but it's touching hearts and changing
[40:57] lives
[40:59] around the world
[41:01] we may be just a small
[41:03] part of it
[41:05] but because jesus prophesied about the
[41:07] great speckled bird
[41:09] that tried to get her to water down her
[41:11] doctrine
[41:13] they tried to polish up her doctrine
[41:16] they tried to put a black name on him
[41:19] and his doctrine
[41:20] they do every possible thing
[41:23] but the gates of hell shall not prevail
[41:28] against the true church of the living
[41:30] god
[41:31] it can't prevail against revelation
[41:34] can't prevail against these foundations
[41:37] that he set the church on
[41:40] because we know we are
[41:42] set
[41:43] on the true foundation
[41:46] which is the original
[41:48] the word of god
[41:51] that comes from the mind
[41:54] and then the mouth of god and now made
[41:57] manifest so we are thankful to god that
[42:00] we are a part of this great
[42:03] eternal
[42:04] purpose of god
[42:07] imagine that you were included in that
[42:13] and that's why paul said we are sought
[42:15] to be so thankful
[42:17] that he had so much in other words he
[42:19] had so much confidence in us that before
[42:22] we even got to earth he predestinated
[42:25] you to be a fellow
[42:27] laborer
[42:29] together with god
[42:31] to be a yoke fellow with him
[42:34] to get this work done
[42:36] amen
[42:38] there is late
[42:40] night is falling
[42:42] and we know jesus said that the broad is
[42:46] the way
[42:47] amen you know there's a lot of places
[42:50] that they call and name broadway
[42:53] and they just call it that but the bible
[42:55] already spoke
[42:57] about the broad way
[43:00] and the narrow way
[43:02] and there's a way in that narrow way
[43:06] and so ah few there be that's gonna find
[43:09] that little way that's in the narrow way
[43:14] and i'm thankful to god
[43:16] that he made a way for me to enter
[43:19] through the needle's eye
[43:21] and i'm glad for every one of you
[43:24] that because we can no more
[43:27] just get up and make a general statement
[43:30] and say oh we all saved
[43:33] we all in the bride
[43:35] we're all going in i don't know that
[43:39] i am believing that what i have preached
[43:42] and taught
[43:43] that you have caught that revelation
[43:47] and that by your individual faith
[43:51] that will take you in but i would know
[43:55] that fully until we get on the other
[43:59] side and in the words of the psalm
[44:01] you're just saying when we're together
[44:04] again just praising the lord then we'll
[44:08] see one another in the house of the lord
[44:11] amen meanwhile but
[44:13] during that time i am trusting him
[44:16] that as i see you visually hear you
[44:19] visually contact your spirit visually
[44:22] while we're talking about the word and
[44:25] sense what is in you
[44:27] that i can trust god that lord even if i
[44:32] leave the earth i know there's some
[44:34] amongst them that will be on that other
[44:38] side that's all i can trust god i just
[44:40] believe and look even if one
[44:43] amen i'll still be praising god
[44:47] if there's ten
[44:48] i'll be shouting
[44:50] if there's a hundred brother philip i'll
[44:53] be jumping and leaping
[44:56] lord of god hallelujah
[44:59] [Applause]
[45:01] but i'm believing god hallelujah and the
[45:04] holy spirit is leading
[45:07] make no mistake about this
[45:10] the pyramid is narrowing to its point
[45:14] we've come to the race's edge
[45:18] and we have got to believe and trust god
[45:23] every week i'm coming here
[45:26] but i'm not coming here
[45:28] with just another message
[45:31] i'm not just coming here to bring a
[45:33] religious discourse
[45:35] uh i'm not just coming here to try to
[45:38] appear spiritual
[45:40] or or some good or great preacher
[45:44] i am just here
[45:46] trying to catch the mind of the spirit
[45:49] for this hour
[45:51] and bring the word of god to you the
[45:53] best that i know how to bring it
[45:59] i was built for this purpose
[46:03] somebody else built for another purpose
[46:06] another preacher has a different style a
[46:09] different way of delivering the word
[46:13] god built each one for his purpose
[46:17] every vessel has its own purpose
[46:20] and so uh my ways my rough ways are the
[46:25] way of saying things you may not like it
[46:27] so god made it maybe didn't build you to
[46:30] listen to this but all those who are
[46:34] mine will come to me
[46:36] all whom god predestinate to hear the
[46:39] message this way will hear it
[46:43] then recognize it praise god hallelujah
[46:47] they'll recognize that somewhere deep in
[46:50] their
[46:51] deep within their soul they heard it
[46:54] before
[46:55] and so now they recognize what they

[47:43] the word here that can fill you up
[47:45] praise the lord hallelujah of course you
[47:48] can go up the stakes afterwards but
[47:51] right now we read from proverbs 7. now i
[47:54] would advocate
[47:56] and encourage you to read the entire
[47:58] chapter
[48:00] when you have the time
[48:02] but i read verses
[48:05] 24-27
[48:07] heart unto me therefore o ye children
[48:12] and attend to the words of my mouth
[48:15] let not mine heart decline to her ways
[48:20] go not astray in her path
[48:23] for she had cast down many wounded
[48:27] yay
[48:28] many strong men have been slain by her
[48:32] her house
[48:34] is the way to hell

[48:46] all today that the spirit of god will

[49:09] praise god god bless you
[49:11] praise god may the lord bless us praise
[49:15] god
[49:16] hallelujah
[49:18] um
[49:20] you know and we give god the glory
[49:23] for the spiritual astronauts that are in
[49:26] here
[49:28] you know one time i don't know why i'm
[49:30] going to be talking like this but anyway
[49:32] one time
[49:33] a father someone was talking to this
[49:37] father that was proud of his son that
[49:39] was in
[49:40] the bible seminary and
[49:42] said how's your son doing oh he's doing
[49:45] fine he says
[49:47] what's he studying said well he's
[49:49] studying um
[49:51] spiritual aeronautics
[49:54] aeronautics in a seminary how could he
[49:57] be studying about
[49:59] space and studying about the airplane
[50:03] flying and all those things in the
[50:04] seminary well
[50:06] well he said well the last time i went
[50:09] there and i asked dean how is my son
[50:10] doing he says man
[50:13] well your son
[50:15] you know your son he is just constantly
[50:19] in space
[50:27] so he left with the impression that his
[50:29] son is studying
[50:32] spiritual aeronautics space
[50:35] meaning that the deacon was trying to
[50:37] tell him your son is spaced out in the
[50:39] class
[50:40] he doesn't know what's going on
[50:44] i hope there is nobody in here spaced
[50:46] out and
[50:47] you don't really know what's happening
[50:50] around you and what's taking place
[50:52] because the word has taken off
[50:55] it has gone to another
[50:57] level and i believe certainly that we
[51:00] are in the third world there's so many
[51:03] things i'm seeing now i don't even know
[51:06] um you know i can't speak on it in one
[51:09] week so we just got to keep going praise
[51:12] the lord by his grace praise the lord
[51:15] hallelujah
[51:16] well um
[51:18] in this proverb chapter 7
[51:21] verses 24 to 27 which i read you'll find
[51:25] in there of course the terminology house
[51:28] of hell
[51:31] right
[51:31] so that was not brother branham's makeup
[51:35] even though he heard that in the vision
[51:40] house of hell
[51:41] because you know the sister
[51:44] was speaking with him and she said
[51:46] brother branham
[51:48] you know
[51:49] deliver the people they need deliverance
[51:53] all kinds of things that need to be
[51:55] delivered
[51:56] and he said i was just
[51:58] thinking about it thinking about it but
[52:01] how could i do it i'm just so weak but
[52:04] then he heard the voice behind him when
[52:07] he turned it was the lord jesus and he
[52:09] said to him
[52:10] go
[52:11] deliver the people
[52:14] deliver the people
[52:16] and he's thinking well how might one
[52:17] deliver these people
[52:19] before he could think he hurt himself
[52:22] saying
[52:22] house of hell
[52:24] give way to the name of jesus
[52:28] amen the name of jesus christ amen which
[52:31] is the word give way for this word that
[52:34] we're preaching you've got to open up
[52:37] and move aside for this word that we are
[52:40] preaching
[52:42] but in this
[52:43] text that we read solomon is saying how
[52:46] that he was
[52:48] standing at his window of his palace
[52:51] looking out towards the streets
[52:54] and there in the twilight hour evening
[52:57] time
[52:58] he said a young man
[53:02] was accosted
[53:04] or approached by a harlot
[53:08] and the harlot brought him
[53:11] to her house
[53:12] you can read the entire thing in that
[53:14] chapter when you get home
[53:17] but to the end of the chapter he is
[53:19] saying here
[53:22] ignorance to the word
[53:24] chained by lack of revelation
[53:28] chained because these clouds of darkness
[53:32] or teachers
[53:34] of the bible bible teachers sincere but
[53:38] they are spreading clouds of unbelief
[53:42] and darkness
[53:44] on the minds of the people
[53:47] and taking them away
[53:49] from the world
[53:51] the original truth
[53:53] spoken of in the bible
[53:56] by patriarchs prophets
[53:59] jesus christ the apostles the seven
[54:02] church messengers and in this hour men
[54:06] of god who have truly caught the message
[54:10] of this last prophet hallelujah and are
[54:14] speaking from the storehouse of the
[54:17] revelation of this mystery of the word
[54:20] being made known to us
[54:24] now
[54:26] change
[54:28] the chains of darkness
[54:32] before
[54:33] i go further
[54:35] the holy spirit let me to another vision
[54:41] that was had
[54:43] he says here
[54:45] souls in prison
[54:47] now
[54:50] now
[54:52] i was just a boy
[54:57] see i was just a boy
[55:01] and i was out hunting with my friend
[55:05] or hunting is my second nature
[55:09] we were about six months
[55:11] apart in age
[55:13] and he let his gun go off
[55:17] by mistake
[55:19] and shot me through the legs
[55:22] both legs
[55:24] real close to me
[55:26] with a shotgun
[55:28] and i was
[55:29] taken to the hospital
[55:32] and i
[55:33] there
[55:34] dying
[55:36] they'd taken an x-ray
[55:39] the shot was so close to an artery
[55:42] i thought
[55:44] well
[55:45] this is the end
[55:47] of me
[55:50] and then i went into a vision
[55:55] i went into a trance
[55:59] and i thought
[56:01] i was in hell
[56:03] see
[56:06] but when that vision struck me
[56:09] i was so weak
[56:11] i lost all that blood
[56:13] and there i was i felt myself sinking
[56:18] sinking
[56:19] falling
[56:20] dropping
[56:22] into an endless eternity
[56:25] sinking
[56:26] there
[56:27] first as i sank i saw myself going
[56:32] through them clouds of darkness
[56:35] he had to get past the clouds of
[56:36] darkness
[56:38] going down into hell i just told you
[56:40] what those clouds of darkness was
[56:43] to get past all the teachings of false
[56:46] teachings uh
[56:47] on scriptural teachings
[56:50] you know differing from the message of
[56:53] this messenger of this age
[56:56] going down down down down and the first
[57:00] thing you know
[57:01] i found myself in the regions of the
[57:05] lost
[57:08] and there i screamed
[57:11] and i looked and everything around me
[57:14] there was no foundations to it
[57:19] i could not stop myself from falling
[57:23] for i kept falling and falling
[57:27] and there was no stopping
[57:30] nowhere nothing to hold onto
[57:33] just falling
[57:36] oh my
[57:38] there i was i screamed
[57:41] remember i was just a boy 14 years old
[57:45] so i screamed for my daddy
[57:49] of course
[57:50] being just a kid that's all i could do
[57:55] i screamed for my daddy but my daddy
[57:58] wasn't there
[58:00] then i screamed for my mother
[58:03] my mother
[58:05] wasn't there
[58:07] i just had somebody catch me catch me
[58:10] catch me
[58:12] and there
[58:13] was no mother there to catch me
[58:17] i was going down
[58:19] and i screamed then to god
[58:22] and there was no god in that place
[58:26] there was nothing
[58:28] there
[58:30] and after a while
[58:32] as i was falling
[58:34] i
[58:35] i heard the most mournful sounds
[58:38] that i ever heard
[58:40] and it was the awfulest feeling
[58:44] along with those sounds
[58:46] that
[58:47] even a literal burning fire
[58:51] would be a pleasure
[58:53] to decide of what this was
[58:57] now
[58:59] you know
[59:00] these visions have never been wrong
[59:04] and in this one
[59:06] i tell you it was the most horrible
[59:09] feeling
[59:10] i ever had
[59:12] i heard a noise
[59:14] sounded like some kind of a haunted
[59:17] house some kind of a haunted affair
[59:20] and when i looked
[59:22] coming
[59:23] was a bunch of women
[59:26] they had green stuff
[59:28] you could see their face
[59:31] they had green stuff
[59:35] under their eyes
[59:37] and their eyes
[59:39] look
[59:40] run back like the women today
[59:42] paint their eyes and their faces
[59:46] run back like that their eyes and face
[59:50] and their work coming towards me going
[59:58] oh lord have mercy o god have mercy upon
[1:00:02] me i just screamed out lord have mercy
[1:00:06] where are you if you'd only let me get
[1:00:09] out of here and go back i promise you
[1:00:12] i'll be a good boy
[1:00:18] now
[1:00:19] that's the only thing
[1:00:21] i could have said
[1:00:22] and god knows i'll meet that at the day
[1:00:25] of judgment
[1:00:27] he has judged me for that statement i
[1:00:29] just made
[1:00:31] if it's true
[1:00:33] or false
[1:00:36] that's what i said lord
[1:00:39] let me go back and i'll promise you
[1:00:42] i'll be a good boy
[1:00:45] when i got shot
[1:00:48] back then i used to tell
[1:00:51] lies
[1:00:52] all kinds of lies
[1:00:56] not only that
[1:00:59] i had done pretty near everything
[1:01:02] anybody else had ever done
[1:01:06] it's only one thing
[1:01:09] and never done
[1:01:10] was to commit adultery
[1:01:16] god be merciful to me
[1:01:18] i looked around me and there was those
[1:01:21] weary creatures
[1:01:23] and they were looking at me like i'm a
[1:01:25] new arrival
[1:01:29] the most hideous
[1:01:31] horrible
[1:01:33] ungodly feeling
[1:01:36] look at them great big eyes
[1:01:39] with big
[1:01:40] long eyelashes out like that run back
[1:01:44] there look like a cat
[1:01:47] back like this green stuff under their
[1:01:50] eyes over
[1:01:51] thing looked like it conquered or
[1:01:53] something and they were just continually
[1:01:56] going
[1:02:00] and then
[1:02:01] in a moment of time
[1:02:04] i had come back to my natural
[1:02:07] life and senses again
[1:02:11] and from that time
[1:02:13] i knew
[1:02:15] there was a real
[1:02:17] regions of the damned
[1:02:20] somewhere
[1:02:22] for i
[1:02:24] was there
[1:02:25] is that right you couldn't have a better
[1:02:28] testimony
[1:02:29] don't tell me about it i've been there
[1:02:32] i know what it is
[1:02:34] and i'm telling you about it now
[1:02:38] okay
[1:02:39] now i'm going to take you from there
[1:02:42] to 40 years later because later he said
[1:02:46] i am 54. back then i was only 14.
[1:02:52] so it's 40 years ago and you know 40 is
[1:02:55] the
[1:02:56] number of judgment
[1:02:58] right
[1:03:00] now
[1:03:01] i went with
[1:03:02] my wife
[1:03:04] and we went out in tucson doing some
[1:03:07] shopping
[1:03:08] and she went
[1:03:10] in we went in downstairs
[1:03:13] and there was a bunch of them
[1:03:16] looking boys
[1:03:18] all right
[1:03:19] now i'm
[1:03:21] pause here a moment i want you to know
[1:03:22] all this i'm quoting
[1:03:25] from the prophet of this 20th century
[1:03:28] william marion branham
[1:03:31] and i'm saying that
[1:03:33] protect this church
[1:03:34] protect myself so that folks will
[1:03:38] understand
[1:03:39] that i am courting
[1:03:41] and i'm staying behind the word of the
[1:03:44] prophet amen
[1:03:46] are you following me
[1:03:49] listen
[1:03:51] and there was a bunch of them
[1:03:54] looking boys
[1:03:57] i think it was arnold schwarzenegger's
[1:03:59] as girly men
[1:04:03] and they had their hair
[1:04:07] ratted down
[1:04:09] today i believe we call it tails
[1:04:12] right
[1:04:13] like that wrecked it down you know how
[1:04:16] it is how some of the women do they will
[1:04:19] just take their hair to the back with
[1:04:21] some type of thing like that and the
[1:04:24] bangs come down in the front
[1:04:28] and wearing them funny trousers
[1:04:31] they had funny trousers back then and we
[1:04:34] got them here today
[1:04:36] right
[1:04:38] and uh my
[1:04:41] i guess whatever you want to call them
[1:04:44] back
[1:04:45] we call them beatniks i don't know what
[1:04:47] you call them now
[1:04:49] but it's the same thing maybe different
[1:04:52] style but same kind of funny trousers
[1:04:56] and there they were
[1:04:58] everybody looking at them
[1:05:00] and i couldn't just stand it so i went
[1:05:03] upstairs and sat down
[1:05:05] and there was an escalator there
[1:05:08] okay
[1:05:09] and bringing people up
[1:05:12] and i turned sick at my stomach
[1:05:16] seeing some of those women coming up
[1:05:18] that escalator
[1:05:21] oh young
[1:05:24] old
[1:05:25] indifferent
[1:05:27] wrinkled
[1:05:29] young
[1:05:31] every way everyone with little bitty
[1:05:35] shorts on
[1:05:37] they're filthy
[1:05:40] body sexy dressed women
[1:05:43] like that
[1:05:45] and here they come up the escalator
[1:05:49] i was sitting back in the chair
[1:05:51] with my head down
[1:05:54] but then i turned to look
[1:05:58] and
[1:06:00] when i looked
[1:06:01] at
[1:06:02] once i felt a change come over me
[1:06:07] i started feeling i had seen this
[1:06:11] somewhere
[1:06:13] i seen this
[1:06:15] somewhere
[1:06:19] her eyes
[1:06:21] were painted
[1:06:23] just like a cat
[1:06:26] you you know put up like this
[1:06:29] and they were wearing scat glasses
[1:06:32] and everything with eyes up
[1:06:35] green stuff
[1:06:36] under and off their eyes
[1:06:39] that there was the very thing i had seen
[1:06:44] when i was but a child
[1:06:48] there was the woman exactly
[1:06:52] i got numb all over my body
[1:06:56] see
[1:06:57] and then i really began to look around
[1:07:01] and then hearing all the people in the
[1:07:03] mall
[1:07:04] crowds of them
[1:07:06] there were i just heard a mumbling
[1:07:09] mumbling similar to that
[1:07:12] mumbling mumbling
[1:07:14] the noise of the crowd but it was up
[1:07:17] talking about prices and things in the
[1:07:20] building but the sound
[1:07:23] was the same
[1:07:27] there it was
[1:07:29] and i thought
[1:07:33] there were in hell
[1:07:36] they didn't even know it
[1:07:41] greenish blue under their eyes
[1:07:46] greenish blue
[1:07:48] he repeats under their eyes
[1:07:51] and he repeats it again
[1:07:53] there was those women i say painted with
[1:07:58] greenish blue
[1:08:00] under their eyes just the way the vision
[1:08:04] said or showed me
[1:08:06] 40 years ago
[1:08:10] oh my
[1:08:12] conquered eyes

[1:08:36] with them here styles and everything
[1:08:38] else with combs and the way they comb it
[1:08:40] back like that
[1:08:42] and then

[1:08:45] for the eyes were filled with paint
[1:08:49] they run back like a cat's eye and
[1:08:51] talking here talking there talking

[1:11:00] there they were
[1:11:02] just like in that vision

[1:11:06] just that mumble going on on the people
[1:11:10] them women coming up that escalator
[1:11:13] walking around with and and my hearing
[1:11:16] that
[1:11:19] and there was those green
[1:11:22] funny looking eyes
[1:11:25] mournful sounds

[1:11:29] oh my
[1:11:31] my wife came up and said billy just

[1:11:37] while honey and she said if you don't

[1:12:01] by the arm
[1:12:03] and
[1:12:04] we
[1:12:05] walked out
[1:12:07] friends
[1:12:08] we got to ask ourselves
[1:12:10] are we living in the regions of the lost
[1:12:17] are we already walking around
[1:12:20] in the regions of the dam
[1:12:24] oh my think on that with revelation you
[1:12:27] understand
[1:12:28] when all the elect seed are called out
[1:12:31] what's left
[1:12:35] the regions of the lost and damned all
[1:12:38] that's left is the lost and then
[1:12:42] right
[1:12:43] amen
[1:12:45] and that's the reason why i believe
[1:12:47] people can
[1:12:48] lie cheat
[1:12:50] steal
[1:12:52] swear
[1:12:54] cuss
[1:12:55] take the lord's name in vain
[1:12:58] they can do witchery witchcraft
[1:13:01] they can conspire and do all kinds of
[1:13:04] things
[1:13:05] they can talk about surgical strikes
[1:13:08] mass murder kill thousands kill
[1:13:11] millions kill people and everything else
[1:13:14] and talk about it being a surgical
[1:13:16] strike as if they're killing insects or
[1:13:19] swatting flies
[1:13:21] and have not a twinge of conscience
[1:13:25] they don't even feel nothing about it
[1:13:28] why
[1:13:30] they lost that something got put in man
[1:13:35] nothing sacred anymore
[1:13:38] conscience god
[1:13:39] fear of god god
[1:13:42] fear of holiness god
[1:13:44] preaches the church
[1:13:46] the word of god is now
[1:13:48] made into a laughing stock
[1:13:52] mockery
[1:13:53] jokes on the television
[1:13:56] my god hallelujah
[1:13:58] mike i tell you friends
[1:14:00] the people don't even have any
[1:14:03] sense of retribution
[1:14:05] anymore
[1:14:07] that they're going to pay for everything
[1:14:09] they do
[1:14:10] and every action they take listen
[1:14:15] what day are we living there in
[1:14:19] for i tell you something happened there
[1:14:23] what they are be living in
[1:14:26] could this be the third pole
[1:14:30] what he's talking about and i'll talk
[1:14:33] about that another time a lot of people
[1:14:35] talk the third police speaking on arms
[1:14:37] and legs the third pull is preaching
[1:14:40] to souls imprisoned now
[1:14:45] the third poll is preaching to the
[1:14:48] regions of the lost
[1:14:51] is it's giving a witness like noah did
[1:14:55] even though their door was shut yet the
[1:14:58] bible says god allowed the preach for 40
[1:15:00] more
[1:15:02] amen days so they can at least get the
[1:15:06] word and can be judged by that word
[1:15:09] but they didn't pay heed amen praise god
[1:15:13] and here he said could that be the third
[1:15:16] poem
[1:15:18] think of it
[1:15:20] praise god
[1:15:21] hallelujah
[1:15:23] my
[1:15:24] imagine that jesus went
[1:15:27] and preached to the souls
[1:15:30] that are in prison
[1:15:33] now i want you to catch this just this
[1:15:35] little piece here what he says i want
[1:15:38] you to know he preached to them souls
[1:15:41] that were in prison
[1:15:42] which is hell
[1:15:46] satan's prison is
[1:15:48] hell
[1:15:49] right
[1:15:50] as long as he can get you and take you
[1:15:52] there along with himself he don't care
[1:15:55] because he don't have hope of redemption
[1:15:58] you know no hope of salvation so as many
[1:16:01] is like a murderer that's being
[1:16:03] condemned to die he can only die one
[1:16:07] time so he doesn't care how many more he
[1:16:10] kills how many lives he destroys how
[1:16:14] many deaths how many mournful suffering
[1:16:18] sickness death that and deprivation
[1:16:21] deprivation he can bring on the human
[1:16:23] race he does not care
[1:16:26] amen and so he's going to bring you into
[1:16:30] hell praise god hallelujah oh my well of
[1:16:34] course hell is a place a holding place
[1:16:37] just like he held the patriarchs and
[1:16:38] apostles before and until
[1:16:42] brother branham says here before you go
[1:16:45] to the white throne judgment
[1:16:48] he says that's where you're held
[1:16:51] amen a place of torment yes
[1:16:54] but you're held in that place of torment
[1:16:57] just before the white throne judgment
[1:17:00] after which because no god will not
[1:17:03] bring anyone to judgment without the
[1:17:05] trial he says
[1:17:07] right they got to be tried and they got
[1:17:09] to come up before him the judge and
[1:17:12] therefore
[1:17:13] hell you're held in that place of
[1:17:16] torment and then death and hell and the
[1:17:19] grave and satan and everything is cast
[1:17:22] into the lake of fire
[1:17:25] amen hallelujah praise god amen
[1:17:30] friends
[1:17:31] i've been in both places

[1:31:26] she caused the entire human race to be
[1:31:29] taken into confinement
[1:31:32] and we got placed
[1:31:34] into our individual cells
[1:31:38] of our body
[1:31:40] bars of bone
[1:31:42] they hold my soul
[1:31:45] but this house of clay
[1:31:47] is gonna burst wide open
[1:31:50] when the angel the spirit of god sets my
[1:31:54] spirit free
[1:31:56] i'll take my flight like a mighty eagle
[1:32:00] for the hills of home they're calling me
[1:32:04] brother branham said one time i went
[1:32:06] into the zoo and when i looked there was
[1:32:10] a great golden eagle
[1:32:12] sitting in a pen just walking up and
[1:32:14] down walking up and down with his wings
[1:32:18] all droopy his head all droopy now and
[1:32:21] again he would look up with them big
[1:32:24] bright eyes looking up into the heavens
[1:32:27] because he was an eagle but there he was
[1:32:30] behind bars oh my friends he said and
[1:32:34] then i thought of so many of them people
[1:32:38] christians that are in them churches
[1:32:41] they're inside of those denominations
[1:32:44] they're on the bondage he uses the word
[1:32:47] he said they are prisoners amen
[1:32:50] hallelujah oh my brother i'll tell you
[1:32:53] but here we are with the word of god to
[1:32:56] tell you in the name of jesus christ you
[1:32:59] are free for whom the son of man sets
[1:33:02] free you are free indeed come out of her
[1:33:05] my people
[1:33:08] not partakers of our plagues
[1:33:11] amen no he says when that eagle could go
[1:33:14] free he'll fly up into the heavenlies
[1:33:17] where he is born for that he
[1:33:19] predestinated for the heaven that places
[1:33:22] in christ amen where he can rise up in
[1:33:25] the name of the lord oh praise god
[1:33:28] hallelujah there we are amen in our
[1:33:32] individual cells are you getting what
[1:33:34] i'm saying and the individual cell
[1:33:37] you're in is in this flesh body that
[1:33:40] you're because as i said to you if
[1:33:42] you're a really lack of god you are not
[1:33:45] of time you come from eternity you're
[1:33:47] going back to eternity you're not the
[1:33:50] flesh you are of the spirit
[1:33:54] the spirit man was made first
[1:33:57] the flesh man was only there so he could
[1:34:00] manifest and do certain things god
[1:34:02] wanted him to be able to do but the
[1:34:05] original man was there in the mind of
[1:34:08] god first
[1:34:09] amen
[1:34:10] but here you are in a cell
[1:34:13] amen
[1:34:14] and there
[1:34:16] when you go into the prison
[1:34:18] sometimes they throw you into a cell
[1:34:21] with another person
[1:34:24] is that right
[1:34:25] i can't say it's not right because
[1:34:29] you can't afford it
[1:34:32] but they may throw you in a prison with
[1:34:34] another person
[1:34:36] but what if they throw you into that
[1:34:38] prison and there's another person by the
[1:34:41] name of cancer
[1:34:45] you're inside of that cell
[1:34:49] and mr cancer is sharing the cell with
[1:34:52] you
[1:34:56] that prison guard
[1:34:58] is not going to help you to change
[1:35:00] who is in that cell with you
[1:35:02] because the guard himself the prison
[1:35:04] warden is satan himself
[1:35:07] but thank god
[1:35:09] we have a governor
[1:35:11] amen and the governor's name is jesus
[1:35:14] christ
[1:35:15] his name shall be called wonderful
[1:35:17] counselor mighty god the everlasting
[1:35:20] father he is the governor amen
[1:35:23] he got the right to give you a pardon
[1:35:26] bring you out of that cell
[1:35:29] i don't care if you have cancer right
[1:35:31] now you've got some other growth sharing
[1:35:34] your body along with you it's not
[1:35:37] supposed to be there talk to the
[1:35:40] governor
[1:35:42] talk to the governor
[1:35:44] talk to jesus christ
[1:35:46] and ask him to get that
[1:35:48] person that's sharing yourself with you
[1:35:51] out of there so that you can walk free
[1:35:54] and give him glory praise and honor
[1:35:57] amen for his mighty name
[1:36:00] [Music]
[1:36:01] [Applause]
[1:36:03] kick him out
[1:36:05] right out of there amen hallelujah
[1:36:10] amen so
[1:36:12] you can place whatever thing the devil
[1:36:16] tried to force on you that you got to
[1:36:18] share that in your body along with that
[1:36:21] other thing you don't have to share it
[1:36:24] you talk to the governor
[1:36:27] and let him give you a pardon let him
[1:36:29] cast that person out of there
[1:36:32] and set you free i hope people are
[1:36:35] hearing me everywhere that i can be
[1:36:37] heard
[1:36:38] i will obey the word of god
[1:36:41] and receive
[1:36:43] the
[1:36:44] the
[1:36:44] blessing of the lord the freedom the
[1:36:47] healing the deliverance
[1:36:49] but mainly the salvation
[1:36:53] the changing
[1:36:54] of your soul
[1:36:56] by the revealing of the word
[1:37:00] think of it
[1:37:03] confinement
[1:37:05] sharing yourself
[1:37:07] amen
[1:37:09] listen
[1:37:10] in the bible
[1:37:12] there was a man by the name of legion
[1:37:15] and when jesus asked him
[1:37:18] what is your name
[1:37:20] he said
[1:37:22] my name is legion
[1:37:24] for we
[1:37:26] are many
[1:37:28] that man
[1:37:29] and you go search and you'll see brother
[1:37:32] branham tells the story of legion that
[1:37:34] he was actually a good man
[1:37:36] but somewhere along the line he starts
[1:37:38] suffering spells
[1:37:39] and the devil tried to take advantage of
[1:37:42] that and start sharing his body
[1:37:46] amen along with that soul that was in
[1:37:48] that body
[1:37:50] and so he had an infestation of demons
[1:37:53] that had taken over his body
[1:37:55] but really
[1:37:57] he didn't know
[1:37:58] how to be free
[1:38:00] he ran to every seminary i mean he ran
[1:38:04] i didn't deliberately do that one but um
[1:38:07] he ran to every
[1:38:09] he ran around the cemetery i'm trying to
[1:38:12] feel for the world where he ran around
[1:38:14] the cemetery going from tomb to tomb
[1:38:17] breaking open the graves
[1:38:20] somehow thinking that how he could be
[1:38:22] free
[1:38:24] he was actually searching for
[1:38:26] deliverance
[1:38:28] and all the clothing they tried to cover
[1:38:30] up his sins and cover up all this past
[1:38:33] and cover up this that giving all kinds
[1:38:35] of doctrinal fig leaves and whatever
[1:38:38] bible said he tore him off
[1:38:40] and threw him away they weren't good
[1:38:42] enough for him
[1:38:44] but all praise god
[1:38:47] once sat alone but then one day what
[1:38:50] then jesus came hallelujah and set the
[1:38:54] captive free i want to tell you the word
[1:38:57] of god is here today
[1:38:59] and this word of god will set you free
[1:39:03] if you obey the promise of the world
[1:39:07] amen not i'm not talking about just the
[1:39:10] written word
[1:39:11] but the understanding the revelation of
[1:39:13] the word for unto you it is given to
[1:39:16] know the mystery of the kingdom
[1:39:18] hallelujah amen and you can't even see
[1:39:21] it or recognize it unless you are back
[1:39:24] there so that when you
[1:39:26] you see it now again you now can
[1:39:29] recognize it because you already saw it
[1:39:32] you were back there in him before the
[1:39:34] temptations of the world
[1:39:38] you're now coming out of your spiritual
[1:39:40] amnesia
[1:39:42] you're coming to into perfect
[1:39:43] realization
[1:39:45] hallelujah the spirit of the lord
[1:39:48] hallelujah is doing this amen yes sir

[1:39:54] out how was legion going to get out

[1:40:04] name of jesus christ amen wherever you

[1:40:16] minds come out wherever you are or your
[1:40:20] dark secret hidden places
[1:40:22] come out of there and let the clouds of
[1:40:25] darkness move back and the rising of the
[1:40:27] sun shine upon them
[1:40:30] they might see him who is the light
[1:40:32] and walk in the light as he is in the
[1:40:34] light

[1:40:39] that regions of the damned he saw those
[1:40:43] regions of the dam there in hell and i
[1:40:46] want you to know my friends
[1:40:48] that he says don't ever go there
[1:40:51] but thank god
[1:40:53] as one song talks about life's other
[1:40:55] side life has another side it's not just
[1:40:59] hell but there's another side to life
[1:41:01] and thank god these are regions of the
[1:41:04] bless you only have to uh you only have
[1:41:07] to listen him speak about beyond the
[1:41:10] curtains of time
[1:41:12] and you'll understand of that realm
[1:41:15] while the musicians are coming here
[1:41:17] praise god thank god brother sister we
[1:41:21] are now
[1:41:24] at the greatest junction of time
[1:41:29] and there's a fork in the road now
[1:41:34] which way to go
[1:41:37] where are you headed
[1:41:39] the road goes in a fork
[1:41:42] heaven
[1:41:44] or hell
[1:41:46] which way
[1:41:48] are you going to go
[1:41:51] choose this day
[1:41:53] whom you will serve
[1:41:57] this is a call from glory
[1:42:00] it may be to you
[1:42:02] god's last altar call i don't know
[1:42:07] people
[1:42:09] that were young
[1:42:11] i'm suddenly getting words
[1:42:14] they've passed away
[1:42:16] they're gone
[1:42:19] i'm shocked beyond measure
[1:42:23] that this is happening
[1:42:26] but god has promised in this last day
[1:42:30] that he will call
[1:42:31] and his true children
[1:42:34] will answer
[1:42:36] it's getting later than you think
[1:42:40] the number is getting fewer
[1:42:43] so i don't know when that last one will
[1:42:45] come in
[1:42:47] i saw in the vision and just a hand
[1:42:50] reaching out to me crying out
[1:42:52] you know just hands crying out for
[1:42:55] salvation redemption for somebody to
[1:42:58] take the word to them
[1:43:00] who knows
[1:43:01] that may be your neighbor
[1:43:03] maybe a friend
[1:43:05] it may be a loved one
[1:43:07] close by you you take for granted every
[1:43:09] day
[1:43:10] but let's make sure friends
[1:43:13] we save them and deliver them from those
[1:43:16] houses
[1:43:17] of hell
[1:43:19] their way solomon describes it he said
[1:43:21] they're
[1:43:22] charming look at these beautiful places

[1:43:34] everything else
[1:43:36] he said that's that's beautiful
[1:43:39] perfumes
[1:43:41] beautiful incense and everything else
[1:43:46] but her
[1:43:47] house
[1:43:48] is the house
[1:43:50] of hair
[1:43:52] don't go there
[1:43:54] for the good man of the house he says
[1:43:57] solomon said it's not at home
[1:43:59] the word isn't there
[1:44:01] it's not there
[1:44:03] so don't even bother going there stay
[1:44:06] with the word of god
[1:44:08] and the word of god will see you through
[1:44:12] praise be to his marvelous
[1:44:15] and a wonderful precious name
