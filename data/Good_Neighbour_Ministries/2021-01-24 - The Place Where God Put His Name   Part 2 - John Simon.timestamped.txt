[0:43] of the place where god
[0:46] put his name the place
[0:50] where god put his name
[0:53] now i want to
[0:56] read from the book of deuteronomy
[1:01] chapter 16
[1:05] verses 4 to 6
[1:10] shall we read out of the word of god
[1:15] and there shall be no leavened bread
[1:19] seen with thee in all thy coast
[1:24] seven days neither shall there be
[1:28] anything of the flesh
[1:32] which thou sacrificed us the first day
[1:37] at even remain all night
[1:41] until the morning thou mayest not
[1:44] sacrifice the passover
[1:47] within any of thy gates
[1:51] which the lord thy god giveth thee
[1:55] but at the place which the lord thy god
[2:00] shall choose to place his
[2:04] name in there thou shalt
[2:08] sacrifice the passover at evening
[2:11] at the going down of the sun
[2:15] at the season that thou camest
[2:19] fought out of egypt
[2:22] praise god god's blessing
[2:25] now upon the speaking and receiving
[2:29] of his wonderful and glorious word
[2:33] my friends let us pray together brothers
[2:36] and sisters in christ
[2:38] and may the lord bless us here
[2:41] as we go into the word of god
[2:44] with joy and the hunger
[2:48] of righteousness within our soul may the
[2:51] spirit of god
[2:52] rest upon each one of us in our various
[2:55] homes
[2:56] of various places wherever we are
[2:59] and may this word of god go forth
[3:03] may the great holy spirit be
[3:06] magnified and glorified amen
[3:10] let us pray our gracious god our
[3:14] heavenly father
[3:16] we ask your divine blessing
[3:20] upon this thy word and we
[3:24] pray with all our hearts lord
[3:29] that the great holy spirit
[3:33] though lord sometimes it seems
[3:37] so different yet we ask
[3:41] that you will have your way
[3:44] that you will take the word and apply
[3:48] this token to our lines to our hearts
[3:53] and may your name be lifted up and
[3:56] glorified
[3:57] for we ask it in the name of our lord
[3:59] jesus christ
[4:02] with the forgiveness of our sins the
[4:04] healing of our bodies
[4:07] oh god and for the renewing of our mind
[4:12] as the word goes sport in jesus name
[4:16] amen and amen
[4:21] now in introducing this subject
[4:26] of course we must first of all know
[4:29] what is god's name
[4:33] and secondly we must
[4:37] learn where did he put it
[4:43] and then where is god's name
[4:48] now i'll encourage
[4:52] encourage you in this coming week
[4:56] to spend some time reading
[4:59] the 12th to the
[5:03] 16th chapters of the
[5:07] book of deuteronomy
[5:10] read it with the spirit of christ upon
[5:12] you
[5:13] and i believe your heart your eyes of
[5:16] your soul
[5:17] will be opened up to the word
[5:20] of god so remember study
[5:24] the bible read the bible deuteronomy 12
[5:28] chapter 12 through chapter
[5:31] 16 and i'm sure
[5:34] that we will be a blessing to your heart
[5:40] now first of all
[5:43] we want to talk about where
[5:46] is what is god's name
[5:52] we find out that god has many titles
[5:57] he was called father
[6:00] he was called son
[6:04] of course father is a title
[6:07] and son is a title
[6:12] he was called holy ghost but that
[6:15] in itself is a title
[6:19] he is called rose of sharon
[6:22] which is a title lily of the valley
[6:27] that is a title he was called morning
[6:31] star
[6:32] that is a title he was called jehovah
[6:36] jiren that is a
[6:39] title oh praise
[6:42] god hallelujah now
[6:45] but announce all of these titles
[6:49] he has a name
[6:52] god has a name to him behold the glory
[6:57] enter in praise when
[7:00] he met moses
[7:03] he had not a name
[7:06] as yet a name
[7:10] as we know it as yet
[7:13] he told moses who art thou
[7:17] moses the voice answered i
[7:20] am that i am
[7:25] oh praise god hallelujah
[7:28] and then we see jesus on the earth
[7:34] many many years later
[7:39] and said i am that i
[7:42] am they said but you're a man only over
[7:46] 50 years
[7:48] less than 50 years old and say that
[7:50] you've seen
[7:52] abraham and he answered
[7:55] before abraham was
[7:59] i am and of course we know
[8:03] i am was the one that was in the burning
[8:06] bush of fire
[8:08] i am was the one that was
[8:11] the pillar of fire amen
[8:14] hallelujah i am that i
[8:18] am now back
[8:21] in the old testament
[8:24] from the generations of cain
[8:28] that wicked one came nimrod
[8:33] and nimrod was a wicked one himself
[8:37] for he went out and forced
[8:41] all of the little countries
[8:45] to come into one place
[8:49] and to build a great
[8:52] tower of course that tower was for the
[8:57] purpose
[8:58] of religious worship
[9:02] of trying to ascend into the presence of
[9:05] god
[9:06] without his invitation or without going
[9:10] by his provided way
[9:12] but with the spirit of rebellion
[9:16] wanting to enter into god's presence
[9:19] by his or their own way
[9:24] and of course it was religious worship
[9:27] at the tower of babel which
[9:30] we see friends that
[9:34] that was a type because that was the
[9:37] scene
[9:38] of denominational religion
[9:41] just where it came from
[9:45] and in this type if we are to study it
[9:48] we will see
[9:49] its end now
[9:53] the tower of babel was certainly
[9:57] a religion of course you know from bay
[10:00] belkin
[10:01] babylon from babylon we understand
[10:04] confusion
[10:05] chaos uh a
[10:08] massive mixture of confusing
[10:12] towns and there it was
[10:17] that god did not choose to put his name
[10:21] there
[10:23] for that was a symbol and type
[10:27] of mystery babylon it would mature
[10:32] and will mature to mystery babylon
[10:36] that is now under our sight
[10:40] of the prophetic telescope of the eyes
[10:44] of the true believer
[10:46] who looks into the word of god
[10:50] and sees today and sees beyond
[10:55] tomorrow and recognizing
[10:58] the ripeness of corruption
[11:02] and religious evil which is to be
[11:06] ripened
[11:07] under this mystery babylon
[11:12] it was religion but denominational
[11:16] religion
[11:18] it was a religion but not
[11:21] of god not finding
[11:24] its uh its origination
[11:28] in the word of god they
[11:31] it had no foundation but
[11:35] man-made foundations
[11:38] the might of the
[11:41] the uh what should i say the might of
[11:44] the cooperation
[11:47] and the union of man
[11:50] putting their mental physical all of
[11:53] their
[11:54] powers together to build this great
[11:57] mighty monument thinking that they could
[12:02] enter into the presence of god
[12:05] not going by his provided way
[12:10] but they all their own way
[12:13] that they think they have conceived in
[12:15] their own minds
[12:17] but in actual fact it was suggested and
[12:21] inserted
[12:25] and the wickedness of satan
[12:30] now we see here because it was not of
[12:33] the word of god
[12:36] mighty as it was glorious
[12:40] as it seemed god did not choose to put
[12:43] his name within
[12:44] a denomination or any denomination
[12:48] or any consul of denominations or
[12:51] group of denominations no matter how
[12:54] mighty no matter how numerous
[12:56] no matter how organized they were
[12:59] god did not choose to put his name
[13:03] within any denomination past
[13:07] present or that will rare its
[13:10] ugly beasts like head in the future
[13:13] but god has not chosen
[13:16] to put his name there
[13:20] amen hallelujah now god cannot put it
[13:24] could not put his name there
[13:27] amen because he said he will put his
[13:31] name in
[13:31] one place and that is the place
[13:35] that we should all look to and worship
[13:40] no wonder jesus said to the woman at the
[13:42] well
[13:43] the r is coming and now is
[13:47] you see you say we worship god in
[13:50] mongerism in uh samaria
[13:54] and the jews say we worship up here
[13:57] in jerusalem but the day is coming
[14:02] hallelujah oh my when it shall
[14:05] neither be there nor here
[14:09] but the true worshipper
[14:12] will worship god in spirit
[14:16] and in truth all blessed be his holy
[14:19] wonderful name
[14:21] amen glory to god hallelujah
[14:24] amen yes sir praise god so we see them
[14:31] each one of these denominations
[14:35] are promulgating the fact
[14:38] that they think they are the one
[14:42] they are the place where god
[14:46] choose to put his name
[14:50] put his power his spirit and all his
[14:53] benefits
[14:56] in them but that's contrary
[15:00] to the word of god and the question is
[15:04] still
[15:04] left unanswered but where did god
[15:08] put his name what is his name
[15:12] first of all and then
[15:15] where did he put it we'll have to
[15:18] find out what is god's name
[15:22] before we can find what it is
[15:26] where it is that he is going to be
[15:29] putting it
[15:30] in the first place so we've got to find
[15:33] out
[15:34] what his name is now we realize that
[15:38] while uh while we are talking about this
[15:42] let's move from nimrod and let's look
[15:46] at god in the old testament
[15:50] and let's look at that and see
[15:54] exactly what god has said in his word
[16:00] now god speaking in his word
[16:04] brother sister has told us
[16:08] clearly amen
[16:12] in deuteronomy he told them that he
[16:16] brought them up with the mighty hand
[16:19] out of the out of egypt
[16:22] and they were called the people of god
[16:26] until they came out of egypt
[16:30] and then they were called the church of
[16:32] god
[16:34] of course we know the word church
[16:37] means ecclesia or
[16:40] the called out wands
[16:44] let me repeat church
[16:47] means ecclesia or ecclesia means
[16:50] church which in turn means
[16:54] they called out ones
[16:58] called out of egypt then we're called
[17:01] out of denomination and called out of
[17:03] sin
[17:04] now called out once
[17:07] oh glory to god hallelujah they
[17:10] came out of egypt
[17:16] to be the church of god
[17:19] hallelujah for they could not be the
[17:22] church of god
[17:23] while they were in denomination while
[17:26] they were in
[17:27] egypt they had to come out
[17:30] first come out of her my people
[17:34] and be not partaker of our sins
[17:39] or else god said he'll have to judge you
[17:43] now let's look here friends we find out
[17:47] that god told them
[17:50] about the tabernacle and then later they
[17:54] built the temple
[17:56] and how god's name or presence would be
[18:00] in the midst of israel
[18:04] coming down in the form of the pillar of
[18:07] fire
[18:08] and settling down inside
[18:12] of the holy of holies above the ark of
[18:15] the covenant
[18:17] in the form of a pillar of
[18:21] fire and god said i'll choose the place
[18:25] of my
[18:26] worship i'll put my name there
[18:30] in that place hallelujah praise
[18:33] god and that's the only place
[18:37] god promised at that time
[18:40] in the old testament that he would meet
[18:43] with his people
[18:45] and they would be able to worship him
[18:48] bring up their offerings talk to him
[18:52] confess their sins make their sacrifices
[18:56] in that one place that he chose
[19:00] to put his name and where his chosen
[19:04] people
[19:05] could worship him and now of course we
[19:08] want to find out
[19:10] where that place is for jesus said
[19:13] it's not jerusalem it's not a terrorism
[19:17] at that time it was
[19:20] a jerusalem
[19:24] that god promised he would meet them
[19:28] and there are many uh many quotations
[19:32] in the bible that we may even mention
[19:35] this one
[19:36] uh you're using them whether the tribes
[19:39] go
[19:39] up and down because jerusalem is on a
[19:43] mountain amen and so whether the tribes
[19:47] go
[19:47] up and down praise god hallelujah
[19:51] so everyone wanting to
[19:54] make an offering make a sacrifice would
[19:57] have to go up to jerusalem
[19:59] bring the sacrifice to the high priest
[20:01] who would then offer it
[20:03] in the presence of god
[20:06] let me make at this time another
[20:09] observation that
[20:12] even the nation the great nation of
[20:15] israel
[20:17] god wanting people to know
[20:21] that he is aligning himself with them
[20:24] and that he is in their midst
[20:28] has allowed that nation
[20:33] to incorporate his name
[20:36] within the name of that nation
[20:40] israel
[20:43] meaning elohim
[20:46] people of the great elohim
[20:50] oh blessed be the name of our lord most
[20:54] high
[20:54] glory be to his marvelous name
[20:58] that god allowed his natural people
[21:02] to incorporate his name
[21:05] with their national name so that they
[21:09] can be
[21:10] forever identified
[21:14] as being a different people
[21:17] separated onto him
[21:20] for for his purposes and for the glory
[21:25] of his wonderful and his
[21:28] marvelous name oh praise
[21:31] god hallelujah how marvelous
[21:34] and wonderful that is brother sister
[21:39] now still in deuteronomy
[21:43] if god chose a place then it's important
[21:48] that we find out what he said about it
[21:52] and where it is
[21:55] i want to find out because i truly want
[21:58] to worship him
[22:00] and you should want to find out because
[22:02] you should want to
[22:04] know where to worship him
[22:08] and we are listening to this uh
[22:12] sermon or this service here today
[22:17] and i would believe some of us
[22:20] are mighty baptists some of us may be
[22:24] methodists
[22:26] some of us may be catholics some of us
[22:29] may be jehovah witness
[22:32] some of us may be christian science and
[22:35] many many names of the myriads
[22:40] of faiths so-called that
[22:43] are in the earth today but regardless of
[22:47] what you
[22:48] call yourself we are all
[22:51] seeking for the same thing
[22:55] and we are seeking for something
[22:58] we are seeking for that's to hit that
[23:01] spot
[23:01] or to arrive at that spot the place
[23:06] where god put his wonderful
[23:09] glorious name we want to know the truth
[23:13] for the bible said you shall
[23:16] know the truth and the truth
[23:20] shall set you free
[23:23] we want to know the place where it is
[23:27] for god had chosen to meet his people to
[23:30] worship him
[23:32] amen and it's right in your bible
[23:36] and thank god it's for all
[23:39] ages all ages and for
[23:43] all times so here we are at now
[23:47] glory to his marvelous and wonderful
[23:50] name
[23:52] now friends realize clearly
[23:57] that god met many people
[24:01] during the patriarchal times
[24:06] and the times of the prophets in many
[24:09] places
[24:10] some of them wherever he met them
[24:14] there would build an altar he'll meet
[24:17] them in deserts
[24:18] on mountains he'll meet them in various
[24:21] places
[24:22] god would meet them in a cave different
[24:25] places
[24:27] because that's different places but uh
[24:30] my friends and that's the way it was
[24:33] then
[24:34] because he was just coming
[24:37] to get his name his real name
[24:41] that would be known upon the face
[24:44] of the earth now of course we realize my
[24:48] friends
[24:50] that we are in the types
[24:53] and the shadows
[24:56] and we know that gabrielle
[25:00] called jesus or told mary
[25:06] that they should call his name jesus
[25:12] and i want you to know that jesus christ
[25:15] is god's tabernacle today
[25:19] amen israel had
[25:22] their temple and tabernacle back there
[25:26] the purifier came down settled
[25:30] in that tabernacle god placed his
[25:33] name there and the tribes had to go
[25:36] up and down to that tabernacle
[25:40] to worship god and to offer their
[25:43] sacrifices
[25:44] offerings and ask for their covering and
[25:48] cleansing from their sin
[25:50] at that place where god had placed his
[25:54] name now
[25:56] we see that jesus
[26:00] is god's tabernacle
[26:03] he is the place where god the great
[26:07] purifier himself
[26:09] came down and dwelt in him
[26:14] for you know
[26:17] the voice speaking from the heavens
[26:22] saying this is my beloved
[26:25] son harry him
[26:29] and so from him will comfort
[26:33] the word of god amen
[26:37] my beloved son yes
[26:40] my beloved son in whom i am
[26:43] pleased to dwell in god was announcing
[26:48] that he was now dwelling in this
[26:51] tabernacle
[26:52] called jesus and that was the place
[26:56] where he would put and had put
[27:00] and has put his name
[27:04] in jesus amen praise god
[27:07] so god tabernacled
[27:11] brought his great name
[27:14] and placed it upon
[27:17] jesus christ
[27:21] and that was the time when god
[27:24] for the first time put his name in
[27:27] a man that of course
[27:31] is a prophetic representation
[27:36] where god was showing
[27:39] what he would do in the future
[27:42] by spiritual multiplication
[27:46] after the planting of the seed
[27:50] that would be multiplied after that it
[27:54] was crucified
[27:56] of course his name
[28:00] was but in the man christ jesus
[28:04] his son who was in
[28:08] all of the types that they were speaking
[28:11] of
[28:12] in the old testament of all israel
[28:16] the temples the sacrifices the offerings
[28:20] the bread everything it was
[28:24] all a type of christ the veil
[28:27] everything was a type of jesus
[28:30] christ hallelujah amen
[28:33] and then the pair of fire will come down
[28:38] the smoke of god will fill the temple
[28:42] the fire of god would go into
[28:45] that tabernacle settle over
[28:49] the ark of the covenant
[28:52] and the voice of god would be heard
[28:54] thundering
[28:56] from it hallelujah
[28:59] the voice of god would be thundering out
[29:02] of that tabernacle
[29:04] i believe the voice of god thundered
[29:07] through the voice
[29:09] and person of jesus christ hallelujah
[29:14] and the old testament was only a type or
[29:18] symbol of what was to come in the new
[29:22] and when he came into jesus christ the
[29:25] bible says
[29:26] it sundered and the voice said this
[29:29] is my beloved son in whom
[29:33] i am pleased to dwell in thank god
[29:37] solomon could not build him a place of
[29:40] rest i'll choose the place where i
[29:42] choose to rest in and god chose
[29:46] jesus christ as his place
[29:49] where he would rest in and where he
[29:52] would put his name
[29:54] and where he would meet with man and
[29:58] talk to man
[29:59] and man would be able to worship him
[30:02] there
[30:02] at this place god chose the place
[30:06] god did not choose a denomination god
[30:09] did not
[30:10] choose anything else but he chose
[30:13] that his name would be on and
[30:16] in the man christ
[30:20] jesus all glory be to
[30:23] god forevermore hallelujah
[30:26] i praise him and magnified him
[30:30] gabriel call his name jesus
[30:33] the prophets call him jesus oh that
[30:36] wonderful name he was absolutely
[30:40] jesus before his birth
[30:44] even the holy prophet isaiah called him
[30:48] his name shall be called emmanuel
[30:52] which of course you know means god
[30:56] with us hallelujah god
[31:00] was going to manifest himself
[31:03] in the flesh to be among us and with
[31:06] us praise god to die
[31:09] for our sins and to take away
[31:13] the sins of the world and so doing
[31:16] he was given the name jesus
[31:20] amen so jesus is the name
[31:24] i say to you jesus is god's name
[31:29] for the jehovah of the old testament
[31:33] is jesus of the new
[31:36] testament the name was placed
[31:40] in the man christ jesus
[31:43] remember look back to the symbiology
[31:48] god did not place his name
[31:52] in a denomination amen
[31:56] he placed it in a man
[31:59] which was the symbol that the day will
[32:02] come
[32:02] when he would place his name and place
[32:06] his power
[32:07] his presence his spirit in the midst
[32:12] of all mankind that he had
[32:15] chosen to put his name in
[32:19] glory be to his marvelous name
[32:22] hallelujah amen yes sir
[32:25] so where we are to worship get in the
[32:29] spirit of christ
[32:31] and that is a place where we are to
[32:34] worship him
[32:35] i hope you're right in the spirit now
[32:38] as we uh talk about him and we
[32:42] we glorify him in his word
[32:45] let us worship and magnify his great
[32:48] name hallelujah oh praise
[32:51] god i don't care no matter if you
[32:54] remember methodist
[32:55] a baptist a catholic a protestant
[32:59] whatever you are i may
[33:02] be there is only one place that we
[33:06] care we can correctly worship god
[33:09] and not there not there not over there
[33:13] not necessarily in even my church or
[33:16] anyone else's church or any
[33:19] denominational name
[33:20] but we are to worship in christ
[33:25] but that is the place where
[33:28] we should be worshiping god romans
[33:32] chapter 8 verse 1
[33:34] for there is no no no condemnation
[33:39] to them which are in christ jesus
[33:43] that walk not after the flesh
[33:47] but after the spirit amen
[33:51] friends we can differ
[33:54] oh on on creeds on on dogmas
[33:58] on doctrines on on this or in that or
[34:02] man-made series uh you can
[34:06] uh it's your desire if you want to go to
[34:09] a matter of this church or
[34:10] you want to be faithful in the baptist
[34:14] church or
[34:15] you want to be a catholic or anything
[34:17] like that
[34:18] but once you are genuinely
[34:22] born of his spirit and you
[34:26] recognize him to be in him friends
[34:29] you become a member of his
[34:33] glorious body and then there
[34:36] is no difference hallelujah
[34:40] but the true believers are
[34:43] one in christ wherever they may be
[34:48] how god will deal with them where he'll
[34:50] bring them from
[34:51] east west north south that's not my
[34:53] affair
[34:54] that is not my business whether they
[34:56] stay whether they come whether they go
[34:59] that is god's affair but the main thing
[35:02] is that we get into christ and let him
[35:05] take control
[35:07] blessed be his holy name hallelujah and
[35:10] then all the walls of partition
[35:14] all those walls of separation through
[35:17] denomination
[35:19] god tears them down through the blood of
[35:22] jesus christ
[35:23] through the holy spirit the anointing of
[35:26] the living god
[35:27] he takes away all the walls of petition
[35:31] and differences because we are
[35:34] in christ jesus and we are here
[35:38] to worship god in spirit
[35:42] and in truth hallelujah
[35:45] amen because it's god's plan
[35:48] for us to worship him genuinely
[35:52] and truly in spirit
[35:56] and in the truth all glory to
[36:00] god forevermore hallelujah i bless him i
[36:04] magnify him and i give him all the
[36:06] praise
[36:07] and all the honor and the glory and all
[36:11] this
[36:13] a place of god chose to put his name
[36:19] amen we know there's a lot of different
[36:22] places as i've mentioned before
[36:24] in the bible where individuals
[36:28] met with god but that individual place
[36:32] where let's say jacob met him in the
[36:35] wilderness
[36:36] making his pillow a stone
[36:39] elijah met him and talked with him in a
[36:42] cave
[36:45] other ones met him by a mulberry bush
[36:51] wherever the place that is where
[36:54] god met that in that person individually
[37:00] but he mentioned that he would have
[37:03] one place where he would put his name
[37:08] and we are have established and are
[37:10] establishing
[37:12] that the place he plays but his name
[37:15] is in jesus christ
[37:18] so i don't know of any different
[37:20] different places
[37:24] that god promised to meet people today
[37:28] because at that time they made altars
[37:34] and maybe they had spots
[37:37] which were called amongst the greek
[37:41] uh oracles
[37:44] and whenever a prophet almighty man of
[37:48] god
[37:49] did a great work they tend to want to
[37:53] make that spot
[37:54] or place holy they want to make that
[37:59] spot that mountain that little hill
[38:02] that cave or or whatever
[38:06] they want to call it sacred listen
[38:09] in our modern terms we find out that god
[38:13] has not promised to meet anyone
[38:17] at any shrine made by man
[38:21] let me repeat god has not promised
[38:25] to meet any one of us at any time
[38:28] at any kind of a man-made
[38:33] shrine no spot nor
[38:36] place is holy or sacred
[38:41] no oracle no special prayer cave
[38:46] becomes holy and sacred
[38:49] no spot whether it be
[38:53] in italy whether it be down in the
[38:56] united states
[38:58] whether it be in brazil whether it be
[39:01] in africa there is no special place
[39:07] that we can go
[39:10] and that is a all healing waters are
[39:13] over here
[39:15] oh there's a healing tree over there
[39:18] there is healing in this spot no
[39:22] all is in christ amen
[39:25] oh praise god there are operations
[39:29] where god might meet a person in their
[39:31] faith
[39:32] but the official announced place
[39:37] that god has commanded to meet us
[39:40] is in the name of our lord
[39:43] jesus christ oh hallelujah
[39:47] blessed be his marvelous and wonderful
[39:50] name
[39:51] so we are not to the look at god that
[39:53] we're going to meet
[39:54] god in a certain certain cave
[39:57] or if i go to this certain certain
[40:00] church
[40:01] if i go to this holy church
[40:04] whoa the church is so holy it's so
[40:07] sacred
[40:08] it's not the church we are
[40:11] called by the word to meet god
[40:14] in christ so if you have never met the
[40:19] lord jesus christ
[40:21] if you've never asked your forgiveness
[40:23] of sins
[40:24] if you have not made your sacrifices to
[40:26] him
[40:27] if you have not made your life a living
[40:30] sacrifice to him
[40:32] you are yet to meet him let me invite
[40:35] you
[40:35] my friend to obey the word of god
[40:38] and come to him for your cleansing come
[40:42] to him for your sacrifices
[40:44] come to him make all of your prayers
[40:48] talk to him jesus christ glory to god
[40:51] hallelujah
[40:52] amen praise god we ought to recognize
[40:57] we are not christians just because we
[40:59] are protestants
[41:03] neither are we christian because we are
[41:06] catholic
[41:09] you're not a christian because you're a
[41:11] methodist a baptist
[41:12] a presbyterian a pentecostal you're a
[41:16] christian because you've repented of
[41:19] your sins
[41:20] god has opened his word to you and
[41:23] you've been
[41:24] baptized not in his titles but in the
[41:28] name of the lord and savior jesus christ
[41:31] we're there not just by water but
[41:34] where there is only one god one father
[41:38] one lord one baptism amen
[41:41] and that is the holy spouse baptism upon
[41:44] you
[41:45] that inducts you into baptism
[41:48] water baptism only inducts you into
[41:51] fellowship hallelujah of the local body
[41:56] praise god but the baptism of the holy
[41:58] spirit
[41:59] inducts you into the body of christ
[42:03] into christ hallelujah in other words
[42:06] the baptist holy spirit
[42:08] brings you into the truth and opens
[42:11] up the word of god to you that you might
[42:14] recognize him that he is the same
[42:17] yesterday
[42:18] today and forever hallelujah
[42:23] my friends egypt
[42:27] exodus chapter 12. we find
[42:31] in egypt there was one place
[42:34] that death could not strike there
[42:37] hallelujah praise god only one place
[42:41] that death could not strike
[42:44] foreshadowing
[42:45] the coming of a real place
[42:49] where god would meet his people and his
[42:52] people could meet him
[42:54] and death could not strike them there
[42:56] you know the answer to that
[42:59] oh under the blood of jesus christ

[43:33] must be killed by the elders
[43:36] how the blood must be sprinkled at the
[43:39] door
[43:41] foreshadowing the coming of christ amen
[43:45] hallelujah and under his shed blood
[43:49] that is where god meets with the true
[43:53] and when the death angel pass and our
[43:57] day

[46:06] earth
[46:07] regardless of his high positions
[46:10] regardless of whatever or whoever he
[46:13] wanted to call himself
[46:15] the bible says no man born in
[46:18] sin and and iniquity was worthy
[46:21] to take this book but there came a lamb
[46:25] one a bloody bleeding lamb as it was
[46:29] slain
[46:30] a lamb that was in a battle amen
[46:33] i believe that lamb was the lamb christ
[46:36] jesus

[46:46] hell
[46:47] preaching to the spirits that were in

[47:26] that can't strike it because it's the
[47:29] living word of god amen it

[57:24] the same body
[57:26] but in a bright form or hallelujah
[57:29] or a wife form and that's where
[57:33] he has placed his name in this day
[57:36] and in this hour there is no other name
[57:41] given under heaven among men whereby
[57:45] we must be saved jesus for that's the
[57:48] name
[57:49] of god's power of redemption hallelujah
[57:52] amen god has all other titles of
[57:56] rapha and and and you know
[57:59] jiren so on hallelujah
[58:02] but praise god many titles but all those
[58:06] titles are wrapped up together and
[58:09] compounded into one name it's the name
[58:12] of jesus
[58:14] devil scream and come out at the name of
[58:17] jesus
[58:18] the seeker healed at the name of jesus
[58:20] the lamb
[58:21] walk again the plain sea the death here
[58:24] at the name of jesus for at the name of
[58:27] jesus
[58:28] every knee shall bow and every tongue
[58:32] shall confess hallelujah all these
[58:34] various churches have all kinds of names
[58:37] but don't trust in those names the only
[58:40] name you can trust in and should trust
[58:43] in
[58:43] hallelujah is in the name of jesus
[58:46] christ
[58:47] jesus said well
[58:51] you know my name is john
[58:54] simon pastor john simon i come in my
[58:58] father's name
[58:59] because simon is my father's name so i
[59:03] come in his name
[59:04] so what jesus was saying when he said
[59:07] i come in my father's name
[59:11] and his name is jesus so his father's
[59:15] name
[59:15] is also jesus we must recognize
[59:19] that he came in his father's name
[59:22] amen hallelujah so the place where
[59:25] people are to meet god
[59:27] is in christ not in a denomination
[59:31] not at a shrine not in a holy cave
[59:35] a holy hill not some holy
[59:38] place a holy prayer mountain that is not
[59:42] where
[59:42] we are to meet with the living
[59:46] god but to meet him
[59:49] in jesus christ listen as
[59:52] his wife as his people
[59:56] we are his flesh as it says in
[1:00:00] genesis and again in the new testament
[1:00:03] flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[1:00:06] bone because we were in jesus christ at
[1:00:11] calvary
[1:00:13] and flesh of his flesh hallelujah
[1:00:17] and name of his name
[1:00:20] for at antioch they were called
[1:00:24] christians christians
[1:00:28] shall we bear his name and we are not
[1:00:31] ashamed to bear his name we will bear
[1:00:35] the shame
[1:00:36] the reproach for the word of god and
[1:00:39] carry the name of jesus proudly upon us
[1:00:42] because we are we have the ring of
[1:00:45] righteousness upon our finger
[1:00:47] we have the robe of righteousness upon
[1:00:50] our back
[1:00:50] we are now waiting now for the chariot
[1:00:54] ride of the rapture to take us out of
[1:00:57] here
[1:00:57] into the divine presence of the living
[1:01:00] god do you know my father
[1:01:03] can you tell me what is his name oh
[1:01:06] praise god the great of fire
[1:01:09] in the burning bush of fire o praise
[1:01:12] god forevermore god in the father god
[1:01:16] and the son god in the holy ghost god
[1:01:18] the only one who
[1:01:20] praised god god when the lightning
[1:01:22] flashing
[1:01:23] god when the thunder roll god all over
[1:01:26] creation
[1:01:27] the same god down in my soul
[1:01:31] blessed be his holy and glorious name
[1:01:34] we come in the name of jesus christ and
[1:01:37] for the glory of god
[1:01:39] amen amen so we understand now
[1:01:44] that god's present day flesh
[1:01:48] is not that jesus that was back there
[1:01:52] he used that body
[1:01:55] jesus one man but jesus said
[1:01:58] except by going to the ground the corn
[1:02:02] of wheat will abide alone
[1:02:04] but if it grows in the ground and
[1:02:05] resurrect it'll come back a thousand
[1:02:08] fold and so on so here we are
[1:02:11] so satan made a terrible mistake
[1:02:14] on the day of pentecost because he ended
[1:02:17] up instead of one jesus
[1:02:19] he ended up with a whole lot of them
[1:02:22] running all over the country and
[1:02:24] spreading the word of god
[1:02:26] that jesus preached to bring the people
[1:02:29] to his glorious name hallelujah thank
[1:02:32] god
[1:02:33] we today we have put on the name of
[1:02:37] heaven
[1:02:37] heaven on earth we are carrying god's
[1:02:41] family name upon us
[1:02:44] hallelujah thank god let me
[1:02:48] my friends begin to close with this
[1:02:51] thought here today just be patient with
[1:02:55] me in this moment
[1:02:56] the inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:03:00] upon this word of the living god for you
[1:03:03] to recognize and see
[1:03:05] clearly that god chose you and i
[1:03:09] in this hour to place his name
[1:03:13] with us upon us and to use us for his
[1:03:16] glory
[1:03:17] and for his honor not just as
[1:03:20] individuals
[1:03:21] but together as the
[1:03:24] body of jesus christ through which he
[1:03:27] can live
[1:03:28] manifest make known his name his life
[1:03:32] his word his light and his power
[1:03:37] right through us amen
[1:03:40] now we know that the great name
[1:03:44] appeared and it is called
[1:03:47] or interpreted j b
[1:03:50] h u they could not pronounce it
[1:03:55] they did not know fully what it meant
[1:03:59] all the expressions on all the
[1:04:02] understanding of all that that
[1:04:06] meant j v h
[1:04:11] and so they called him
[1:04:15] jehovah jehovah genesis 2
[1:04:19] amen when god said i am
[1:04:23] in other words i
[1:04:31] jehovah what did that mean i
[1:04:34] am the self-existent one who has created
[1:04:39] something off of myself
[1:04:43] let me repeat i am the self-existing one
[1:04:47] who has created something off
[1:04:50] of myself to be a son
[1:04:54] of mine a child of mine
[1:04:57] created something to be an amateur or
[1:05:01] an amateur god hallelujah
[1:05:05] amen see or praise god
[1:05:08] so he gave man god gave
[1:05:11] man that position that if he
[1:05:15] is born again cleansed by the spirit
[1:05:19] in filled by the genuine holy ghost i'm
[1:05:22] not talking about some pentecostal
[1:05:24] uh baptism of the holy ghost but i'm
[1:05:27] talking about a real
[1:05:29] holy spirit baptism that illuminates the
[1:05:32] word
[1:05:33] lights up the pages of the bible and god
[1:05:36] becomes his own interpreter
[1:05:38] making his word plain to you and makes
[1:05:42] you
[1:05:42] into an amateur common g
[1:05:45] or d because god is capital g o d
[1:05:49] our heavenly father amen and
[1:05:52] made us who we are amen praise god
[1:05:56] so god is not self-existent
[1:05:59] anymore he is not just
[1:06:03] yahweh anymore
[1:06:06] his name is jesus hallelujah
[1:06:10] and now he exists with his family
[1:06:13] here on the earth this great
[1:06:16] one who was called elohim
[1:06:19] allah allah elohim
[1:06:22] oh praise god forevermore
[1:06:26] he was jehovah
[1:06:29] jehovah the one who exists
[1:06:33] with his family that he is made off
[1:06:37] of himself the mystery of god
[1:06:41] now revealed from the entire bible
[1:06:44] oh praise god forevermore all part of
[1:06:48] himself
[1:06:49] he made into an amateur god hallelujah
[1:06:53] amen so and god made his
[1:06:56] children to predominate
[1:07:00] over the entire earth to have dominion
[1:07:04] so earth was was and is
[1:07:07] man's dominion according to scripture
[1:07:10] his domain and god made him to be
[1:07:13] a common or small god amateur god
[1:07:17] over the entire earth hallelujah
[1:07:21] he could speak and it would be so he
[1:07:24] could say this and it would be done
[1:07:26] their god is there is a place hallelujah
[1:07:31] oh praise god jehovah the self-existing
[1:07:34] one
[1:07:35] who existed before now exists today
[1:07:40] with his family his little ones all
[1:07:44] around them
[1:07:45] all praise god worshiping him
[1:07:49] praising him just like that did up in
[1:07:52] heaven
[1:07:54] when he asked job and may i
[1:07:57] conclude on this thought oh
[1:08:01] job where were you when my children
[1:08:05] the sons and daughters of god were
[1:08:07] shouting for joy
[1:08:09] and praising and worshiping me up in
[1:08:12] heaven where were you hallelujah
[1:08:14] were you there did you have
[1:08:16] representation there
[1:08:17] oh glory to god because if you are a
[1:08:21] child of god
[1:08:22] a true son of god you don't get eternal
[1:08:25] life on a certain day
[1:08:26] for the word eternal means without the
[1:08:28] beginning without an
[1:08:30] ending it means that you are a little
[1:08:33] tiny
[1:08:34] piece of god that he made himself
[1:08:38] he took himself a one of his part of
[1:08:41] himself
[1:08:42] to manifest it as a child of his own
[1:08:46] oh god bless you praise god forevermore
[1:08:49] i can go on
[1:08:50] uh forever around and around with the
[1:08:54] word of god
[1:08:55] but the time has come for us to go oh we
[1:08:58] must part my friends

[1:09:03] days come in as the book of revelation

[1:09:06] that one day there shall be no more
[1:09:08] division no more separation
[1:09:10] there shall be no more sea thank god
[1:09:14] hallelujah i look for that day of the
[1:09:17] coming of the lord
[1:09:19] and the changing of our domain and
[1:09:21] dominion
[1:09:23] and we go from this place and step into
[1:09:26] another
[1:09:27] for in my father's house there are many
[1:09:30] mansions
[1:09:31] and if it were not so i would have told
[1:09:34] you
[1:09:34] thanks be to god the place where god put
[1:09:38] his name
[1:09:39] first god placed his name in
[1:09:42] the tabernacle amongst the people of
[1:09:45] israel
[1:09:46] to this day that nation is called israel
[1:09:50] which el is the beginning of elohim

[1:09:58] so he identifies himself with them
