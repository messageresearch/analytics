TRANSCRIPT
========================================
started 6,000 years ago. That's why. Amen. Time started because of the fall. Because Adam and Eve fell from grace. When God said, "You can eat of all the trees that are in the garden." It wasn't fruit trees. It was people. It was it was individuals. It was it was it was God's creation. But he says of that tree of the knowledge of good and evil. That was Satan. That was the serpent. He says that circuit don't it wasn't a snake that was on the ground. It was an upright being. It's the missing link that science to this day science they call it the missing link theory between ape and man because they got this evolutionary theory that we come from apes. If we came from apes, I'd still be walking like this. Give me a break. evolution. The only evolution is the evolution of you being born again. Amen. By the spirit of God and being transformed in your mind and putting on the mind of Christ and receiving the revelation of God. Amen. But they fell in the garden because the serpent went to Eve and says, "Hey, you should know that if you do this, you're going to be like God." It wasn't eat an apple. It was an adultery. She made love with the serpent in the Garden of Eden. And two children were born. Because right after she made love with the serpent, she went to Adam and she says, "Man, you got to try this. This is amazing. My eyes are open." But that was the that was the unbelief. She went and took another husband and the moment you take another Christian doctrine or creed outside of the pure unadulterated word of God, you are committing adultery against the word of God. And that's why Jesus says, "I never knew you." When a man, that's why you look at the Bible, "And Adam knew his wife, and they brought forth, yes, a child." Christ never knew you. In other words, he never planted his seed, his attribute. I never planted my attribute in you. And therefore, there is no way that you could possibly please me. Genesis 3, the serpent beguiled Eve, told her that her eyes would be open. And look, she goes and and does the same thing with Adam. And right away, the two of them realize that they're naked. Why did they why did they realize that they were naked? And they had to go hide from God. Because their eyes were open while they were there. They were naked. They were clothed in the Holy Ghost. They were clothed in the protection of God's word. They came out from that. And look, two children are born, a Cain and an Abel, and one kills his brother. That's why the Bible says when Jesus was here and he he he rebuked those Pharisees when they they came to him and they says, uh, you know, we are the children of Abraham and we are this and that. He he turned around and says, you are of your father, the devil. He was a liar from the beginning. Who was the first liar in the beginning? The serpent. And that's why that nature was injected into the human realm. And that nature was injected with the wrong soul and the wrong the wrong understanding of God. And it was it it could never be born again. It could never be re uh uh uh uh saved as an attribute of God back into the bride of Jesus Christ ever. It was deceived. And that whole lineage, if you go back through the scriptures, you will see that that lineage runs right from Genesis to Revelation. The two seeds, the serpent seed and God's elected seed. You'll always see it. And God, look at read it in Genesis 3:4. And God hath given me another seed in place of Abel. And it was set. And it goes all the way down. And you will see that God's seed all the way down through and it came through an Ahab who was a prostitute. But yet through that lineage came Jesus Christ because God was showing that it wasn't going to be by works. It wasn't going to be by by because you were better or because you were you you you you made yourself something better or your organization or whatever it is. No, it's not because of that. Because of election. That's right. Amen. Because you were with him before the foundations of the world. And it's not because you're a robot or some kind of a clone either. You've been given free moral agency that when the word of God is revealed and the truth is made known, you can reject it or you can receive it. That's right. Amen. And if you reject it and you, you know, I go to I talk to somebody say, "Have you been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ?" They said, "I don't know how I was baptized. You need to know because every one of the baptisms in the book of Acts was done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And that gives you just Acts Acts 2:38 gives you the right to receive the Holy Ghost according to the word of God because God is going to honor his word. He's not going to honor the church doctrine or the teaching. When he judges us, he's going to judge us by the word. Amen. There's over 8,000 baptisms and every single one of them in the book of Acts is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And somebody says, "Ah, it doesn't matter." Is that right? No. So the word of God doesn't matter. You see, it shows because the Holy Spirit, the Bible says, "And the comforter shall come, and he who is the Holy Ghost shall come in you, and he shall guide you into all truth. The moment somebody comes to you and filled with the Holy Ghost says, but the word says this, I'm not saying it. The word says it. They turn around saying, I got baptized when I was a child. What are you going to do? You say, well, you can't give somebody revelation. You can't give faith to somebody. God gives faith. Amen. My sheep hear my voice. No other voice will follow. When the word comes and it speaks to that attribute, it has to respond if it's an attribute of God. Because he said, "All that the father have given me, might come, will come. Every son and every daughter of God will come." Next slide. Go to the next one. There's a timeline and we're going to stop in three minutes and we'll we'll pick this up again. If you look at this timeline, you can see that there was God alone in eternity before the creation. Genesis 1, the original creation between the time when God created the original creation. It could have been billions and billions of years that they were in the garden. It's unknown. Doesn't matter. It's irrelevant. The only the only reason that we need to know that is because people come and say, "You say the Bible is only 6,000 years old." I go, "Yeah, the Bible is the written word, but not the word of God. It had no beginning and no end. Yeah. Well, you say there's, you know, how do you explain the dinosaurs? No problem. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. Period. It wasn't until Adam and Eve fell. He says, "The day you eat thereof, you shall surely die." Adam and Eve could have been there for a trillion years because there's no time. Yes. Time was irrelevant. Yes. Things could come, things could be there. They didn't die. They just existed. So time is irrelevant when you are in eternity. Eternity is a circle. It doesn't end. Yes. That's why you put a ring on you, you know, when you get married, it's it's it's it symbolizes forever, right? Eternity is forever. So that that duration of time, those dinosaurs could have been there. Those anything could have been there. There could have been fossils and and there could have been uh uh you know men that were like in the almost in the full like like a serpent. He was almost in the image of God. Actually, he was in a in a human image but he had no attribute soul that came from God. He was created for a purpose because God wanted to be a redeemer. Now, we can't get into all of that, but God wanted to be a redeemer. So in order to be a redeemer from before the foundation of the world and to be a savior, something had to be lost. And redemption means to take back something that was originally yours. Okay, we can't get into all that. There's just way too much. But we're going to end it on this note. Genesis 1:2, present creation. Then there's a 6,000 year cycle all inside from the fall. The fall, right, Adam and Eve going to hide themselves to 2017. And there was a lot that took place in between that. We're going to be looking at that and looking at the 2,000-year dispensations that lead up to our day and what it is that we should be under expectation to see next. That okay, it's okay to have Bible study. Is this this is this making sense? Praise God. All right, come on up, Michelle. Let's do a song and then we're going to let you go home and we will continue this next week.
