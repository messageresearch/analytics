sister patsy her relative here i married about 10 years ago in trinidad and they live in denmark and they're visiting with her and so she brought what used well at the time there was no babies but now they're young men glad to see them i'll see them afterwards but praise god for every one of you that are here in the house of the lord may the lord bless you real real good glory to his wonderful name shall we turn in our scriptures our bible we are not here first of all i want to thank god for the worship is going higher and higher and higher and god is using the the brethren and they are in the spirit while they're doing it and we thank god for that also um i pray that god will continue to lift the level of everything higher and higher in his own way praise god and may god bless us together as we look into the perfect law of liberty joshua chapter 2 verse 18 from 18 to 21. just a point where we starting from and i'd like to talk about our lifeline our lifeline now i'll touch on quite a few things but uh i want you to bear that in mind pray mind glory to god let's read the scriptures if the they'll have that up on the screen it's up on the screen so we can all read it together i'll read it aloud behold when you come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window it says thread there but it's really rope okay in the window which thou didst let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we shall be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him and if thou utter this our business then we will be quit of thine oath which thou has made with us to swear and she said according onto your words so be it and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the window praise the lord not a little doggy but a scarlet line was placed in the window praise god may god bless our hearts our gracious father we thank you this morning for this glorious and awesome time that we have not come here to put on the best religious show possible that we can but we have already entered into reality we have entered into a power of the presence of almighty god and we are so thankful that you are here with us and that you confirm your words by your presence and by your spirit i pray lord that day earnestness the sincerity the genuine love and revelation from out of the word of god will sweep over our souls and carry us away into the great beyond may you take glory and honor in jesus name amen praise the lord god bless you real good please be seated now we have all been made aware that the great holy spirit uh has brought us out of our spiritual amnesia and made us aware uh by revelation that we didn't just got saved on this particular day in this certain year in this time in this age but that we were already in him before the foundation of the world we were always in eternity but we only now found out we only now found out uh that we were already in him we were taught we were thinking or we were taught that we now have to do something religious to be able to get in him to get in his graces to get into his love to come into his presence we had to do something religious some act some work some something to show that uh you know it's now happening but i'm here to tell you that it's not now happening he has now made us aware that we were already in him we're already in him before the foundation of the world that is let's say let's use a human term eternity past there's no such thing but i use that so you can understand in eternity past we were always in him from before the foundation of the world but now he is bringing us out in another phase of coming out of that spirit uh spiritual amnesia that not only has he brought us uh the revelation that we were already in him uh we were always there in him but he is now wanting to emphasize to us that not only that but we now have him in us the whole god of eternity in us now how can your mind understand that that god in you praise god and i'm so thankful that we are happy that he is in us praise god before there was a world before there was a moon before there were any stars before there was anything we were already in him and we had the word of god in us praise the lord it's not now coming in either it was always there within us praise god hallelujah and coming into that realization we are now able to manifest that word through our lives or the word can manifest itself that it is alive once again in us making itself known hallelujah and he by that manifestation is identifying you and i that you and i are a part of his great body that you are one little portion in this age that he has made aware of who you are and he is identifying you by showing that you have an ear to hear by your reception of revelation and that reception of revelation shows that you are a part of the body you're a brick in solomon's temple natural pointing that you're a part of the body spiritual but now that the body has come to realization of who and what it is it's now finding its place in the temple it's finding its place in god and being positionally placed by the holy spirit praise the lord now before we used to be taught many things that you have to know you have to know your position you have to be placed here place in this position now we're telling you or i'm showing from the word of god the word of god is telling us we don't have to do that we just come to know who we are we just get a revelation of god's program and that he is now placing us positionally where we are supposed to be and that's why a true son or daughter of god knows regardless of what the conditions are around you you are where you are because that's where you're supposed to be for this time it may change you may take you out to that and put you in another position but it's moving the holy spirit is moving all the time and fulfilling his word now listen closely remember think of it the people born of his spirit in a day like this just stop there do you a day like this a sodomite day a day of gomorrah a day like noah had that anything could be born again in a thing like that was that not just like when jesus was born can anything good thing come out of nazareth can anything good come out of that issue what can come out of this wicked and evil generation that we are living in but god for purpose that he will have a bride it's not what the bride does to take herself out but he already planned and purpose it that i'm gonna have a bride regardless of corrupt how wicked how messed up and muddled up and insane the age becomes i'm gonna bring out a bride that's pure without spot without wrinkle blameless justified in my presence by the word of god hallelujah amen people born of a spirit in an age like this in this great denominational age we are living in the distinction there is the age we are living in natural and the spiritual age we're living in that's so filled with denominational religious pollution and yet you are able to become out changed and freed and washed by the blood of jesus christ to live an upright life to live a righteous life to live a life that god wants you to live hallelujah amen you see it's the living god taking his living word you and me that's what he's talking about and vindicating it personally see this life that's in you that's in the word see is a germ it's a seed that was placed in that word and that makes it the living word for the germ is in the seed and the word is that seed that the sewer went forth to sow and the life that's in there is the life of christ see in the word personally and it vindicates itself something that you cannot do but he will do that in you because you can't ah do that but he will vindicate himself in you praise god that he may receive all the glory and no man can glory in his presence oh lord i work hard for you lord i sacrifice lord i pray so many hours oh lord i studied their night and i read all the books i listened to all the day that's wonderful and good but he wants to make it clear that he would share his glory with nobody he wants all the glory and all the praise and he is the one that's doing all of it and we are just yolk fellows that are cooperating with him obediently as we walk win the word of god hallelujah amen who praise god you see he is proving himself that it is not you that is doing that in there this is christ is the mystery of god revealed praise the lord he is speaking here hallelujah and you can't do it yourself see but it's him he repeats again because you and him have become one can you say amen amen you and him have become one you're in agreement you are in oneness you are an invisible union you're united you're married to jesus christ you're married to the word of the living god hallelujah oh praise god i want you to understand friends listen it's not him but you and him have become one that makes you a loved slave some of you didn't know it but you're a love slave is that right because you you can't get away from the word amen why it's not because the pastor is keeping you it's just like parents they send a turn to school but you can't watch over them 24 7. so you put them in the hands of a higher power who who doesn't sleep and he sees all and he knows all and he he can protect all his all in all his everything and that's where our fate rests in the being like that the mighty god you have a lasting father the prince of peace hallelujah jesus christ amen lord of god you become a love slave to him him the word to become a bride hallelujah praise god and what is the word the word is life not natural life the word is spiritual life hallelujah that no matter if this outside man dies the the germ that he puts in there continues to live forever it can never pass away it can never die or anything like that but satan wants to tell a lie to the world by the outside man dying that's the end of him and he tried to tell that lie with jesus that's the end of him it wasn't the end of him because it what was in him the father that dwelleth in him did the works and now the gene that lives in you manifests itself and does the work that he that liveth and believe it on me though he were naturally dead yet shall he live praise god because the holy spirit of the living god working moving takes that gene and uses it for his glory and for his honor amen praise god amen hallelujah so we understand you always had eternal life how many knows that amen go back to brother branham's fundamental teaching the words the bible's fundamental teaching eternity eternal means without the beginning and without an end that alone tells you you cannot now receive eternal life to begin on a certain day a certain month a certain year you had to be in the original mind and plan and planting of the great sower of seeds upon the earth you have to be already there before you can be here amen you have to be there before you can be here we can twist that backwards and go back to my old message on where were you when the morning stars sang together for joy and show that you're fighting god's word down here just like you fought against michael uh are up there you're doing the same thing down here you're resisting you're fighting the word you're doubting the word you're coming against the lord in the same way praise god hallelujah amen somebody says oh you know if i was in the days of jesus i would have never pierced him in the side i would have recognized no you know you reject the word of god it's just as much as we in the west in jesus say we are joking him piercing pierce him in his side but you do that by your doubts you do it by your fears you do it by your rejection of his people because now it's not god the word only being understood but god god misunderstood in his word his living word his people his children today he's being misunderstood because their actions are so uh out of the system their actions is out of the church system their actions are not in sync with the religious systems even in this message it's not in shape they're in sync with the word they're in sync with his life they're moved by his life by his spirit praise god you're not moved by brother so brother so you're not even moved by me you're hearing me but if i only say something that's not there god will show it to you and that's why we we're talking to eagles hallelujah we're not talking to chicken hawks or talking to all kind of what you call those little canaries when a great eagle or a young eagle can fly up and soar in the heavenlies of the word of god hallelujah what what you're going to do with a canary you can't even rise as high as the treetop much less what you're going to tell them amen or back to the word of god back to the holy spirit oh praise god forevermore glory to god amen hallelujah so uh uh let me make some statements here that uh if you listen close i want you to understand you're really never was saved anywhere down here on the earth the land was already slain before the foundation of the world you are now manifesting that salvation you're letting the rest of the world know what happened up there by doing what you're doing down here in other words jesus had to come back and go to the cross the lamb was already slain before the foundation but human being senses can't pick them up they don't know nothing about that so he has to come on the earth and dramatize what he already done and what i'm telling you is that we are here living out and manifesting what we already done you were always saved you were safe way back there right down right now right down to the present time praise god hallelujah amen can god lose anything so then how were you lost you see what i'm saying that word when it's used and when it's used even in the bible it's for the people to understand but for you yourself you know that god can't lose anything you can't lose anything so he really didn't lose you amen but in the eyes of man how he's going to express that to them without telling him all his secrets before the time yeah he can't do that so he said oh they're lost i i gotta i gotta bring them back i've got to save them yeah you see because they but they were already saved but god has expressed it that way can't let nothing out before this time i'm telling you now we're telling you now but this couldn't be said before because the devil is always there listening looking to copy and corrupt and uh undermine the kingdom of god saw the secrets of the princes of this world knew the things of god that would not crucify the lord of glory amen they fulfilled their part in the whole drama and didn't even know they were fulfilling their part as far as that goes amen praise god hallelujah i'm glad about that praise god aren't you happy about that [Music] god was really redeeming a part of himself out of the pawn shop the devil's spawn shop the devil only had temporary use of you until god was the came back through jesus christ to bring the ticket the tag the token and take you out of the pawn shop praise the lord and i'm glad that that tells me that god so loved me that that a portion of himself could never be left in the devil's spawn shop and he made a way to bring me out bring you out praise the lord god hallelujah and not only i'm finding out and i'm understanding now not only um did i always have eternal life let me say it because it might sound radical but listen but you are eternal life because you are a part of that original life i don't mean you are all of it but you're a portion of it and so you are a living part of eternal life living on the earth in other words eternity already broke into time in you and it's walking on the earth now they talk about aliens and they're looking for all kinds of paul already tell us you see you are aliens and strangers from the coming from god's commonwealth of grace and they don't even know that we are already here praise god because we are walking around with human bodies just like everybody else so we just human bodies but paul said we're really not from here we didn't even come from here when this is all over we going back to where we come from and then we're going to be known as we are alone we will be recognized of who we really are by the grace of almighty god hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah it's his presence in the individual with personal vindication of himself expressing himself through them the living word that's promise for the day whatever promise was for this age that's what he's going to manifest through you restored the word restored a vindication of the great revelation of god look he will look only in an individual never in a group an individual not in a group his identification is with an individual hallelujah so i can't get up here like elvis presley and says oh my we all bride is that right there's a whole lot of love in this room all of you have the stature of the perfect man i can't say that you individually must receive that revelation from god now in the church age book at remember page where brother branham said the importance of revelation to the true believer you cannot over emphasize the importance of revelation to the true believer amen praise god but i would just like to put this word which he has already here the which the importance of individual revelation not only to recognize the great revelation came forth by the seven seals amen but for you to have individual revelation on that because that is what he was saying that upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it amen praise god he wasn't talking to the group he said thou art peter and upon this rock what rock the rock of revelation amen individual revelation is of supreme importance praise god hallelujah praise god and we don't so our struggles are over right because everything is based on him and he has already overcome and i thank god for this great overcomer in my life uh christ is a mystery of god revealed all hell is against this teaching everybody's talking about revelation revelation any group you go to even message group you know the national group they're talking about revelation revelation revelation revelation most of the time they mean to have a better intellectual understanding of what you're hearing not that something one day you've been listening for a long time but one day something strikes your heart and a light bursts within you a bulb goes on amen and you recognize who you are by the grace of god hallelujah i want you to know that my brother sister all hell is against this teaching what teaching the teaching of people becoming aware not the church telling you they have a revelation and for you to be saved you believe the church you believe the group and then you get saved but you are saved or come to the knowledge that you are saved by your individual revelation of who you are and what god has done for you amen through the ages glory to god hallelujah all hills against this teaching grace god what teaching praise the lord that what teaching the teaching of god's word because you catch the revelation it brings you from way up in glory right back into glory and i'll tell you about lucifer and how he was in heaven and how he started a war in heaven how he start rumors and gossips and heaven lies in heaven how he started all these things and how he was kicked out the lucifer was kicked out and now he's come down here to do the same thing raise up a counterfeit church that's anointed by fallen angels to come amongst the people and to spread rumors of false doctrines blacken the name of jesus christ of the world to confuse the issue and to subvert the kingdom of the living god hallelujah and so that false church that he has there are things that are right in this bible they don't want you to know they don't want you to know that god is really one god and that all they were teaching all these years about blessed trinity and holy trinity is absolutely false and not found in the bible it's not found in the bible you'll never find paul or any of those apostles praying in that way or saying anything like that they will use terms like father son and holy ghost but jesus mentioned clearly to them who was the person that is the father the son and the holy ghost amen so that's the devil doesn't want you to know that there's one god because that brings your eyes start to focus now the baby's eyes start focusing it's not scattered vision now the vision is coming just by recognizing you begin right there one god and that's the teaching that the devil doesn't want the people outside to know let's not take it for granted how simple that sounds to you but that's earth chattering to people on the outside hallelujah that there is only one god and take it further his name is jesus christ [Music] i said his name is jesus christ and there is only one god hallelujah they don't even want you to know that jesus christ is that god that was in the old testament and is right now here with us the same yesterday today and forever they don't really want the people to know what rarely happened in the garden they'll tell them lies upon lies upon lies once it was an apple then it was a pair then it was something else then this it was this it was that none of them will come and tell the people the truth amen it was sexual sin in the garden and twins came forth from it cain and abel and the world got populated that way and spiritually the world already is populated that way praise god they don't want you to know that they make it sound like it's so of color so we can't preach that we can't say nothing about that we have to lead that we can expose to you what really eve did in the bible oh no they will tell you that that's what one of the things they don't really want you to know they don't want you to really know the trail of the serpent all his whole history from heaven right down in the garden right down to this hour and how he's going to end up in the bits of hell amen and the lack of fire the mystery of inequity they don't want you to know about that they don't want you to know the mystery of god through the ages when i say the mystery of god the mysteries that were in the word they don't want you to know that the bible as it is you can read it all right but it's a book that is filled with mystery and unless god interprets his own word to you you don't know what you have you just got it in your hand but you don't know what to really have until god begins to interpret his own word to your heart and to your life [Music] they don't want you to know the unveiling of god was done in our generation by a 20th century prophet a modern-day prophet not a must not ezekiel not isaiah the devil always wants you to look back on which is okay we go back to all those prophets but god sent us a present-day prophet 20th century prophet william marian branham praise god hallelujah oh my and he didn't come here to bring some new gospel or add to the word all he came was to magnify the word that's already here jesus said i didn't come to get rid of the word or to exchange i come to fulfill and the word there in the greek is magnify in other words i want to see it clear i want it to become so big that you can't miss it that you're going to see it that's what the prophet came is to make the word of god clear known to us praise the name the lord hallelujah but not only is the prophet was used to unveil god the word but now what is taking place is the unveiling of the bride for she she the bride before the coming to her bridegroom she always had to wear a veil so she was hid amidst all the rest of the people hid amongst humans him amongst the people but thank god god is now taking the veil off of the bride for them to recognize what he has done what he is doing in this day and in this hour don't tell me i shouldn't be excited oh brother simon calm down you shouldn't get so excited i'm excited because this is the hour this is the day this is the time when god is taking his people out of here oh his beloved bride his elected few his speckled bird praise god you know that in the in a lot of the uh weddings in the east the the young man can't see the bride he's not allowed to really see her he sees her form and that sort of thing but her face you don't know her face until he begins to lift the veil then when he lifts the veil you see her face clearly oh praise god and i'm glad he's lifting the face lifting the veil off of the bride to recognize that the is right amongst you right now she is just human like you amen but the word is what makes a difference amen the word makes the difference praise god hallelujah and now we thank god they won't want you to know this they want you to know that you got to have all kinds of priesthoods and this and that they don't want to recognize that the leadership has now changed the pillar of fire it's changed to joshua joshua is the one that's leading at this time the holy spirit is the one that's leaning at this time but they don't want you to believe that because uh how how you're going to move like that you got to have certain codes of conduct you got to have certain fundamentals laid out clearly that you are to act by but that's exactly what they did they give the people a primer on how to be a christian and they are to take those rules and live by those rules but god put the his law within our hearts so my friends it's the holy spirit leading i'm just watching myself there before i don't want to go off on this or that but stay right in the center there that praise god forevermore that we are led by the holy spirit and we are led by joshua the holy spirit amen praise god amen there it was that once it was moses obeying the pillar of fire leading them through the wilderness but when the children came through the wilderness moses had to die on as you know and his body was carried away and what happened joshua took them across the river hallelujah praise god i'm not pillar of fire later on was seen by joshua as the captain of the lord's hosts amen praise god we're right in that phase right now where the purifier working amongst the people of god unseen but recognized by the true believer hallelujah praise god forevermore oh praise god amen wow where are we at praise god when they don't want you to know that true what baptism is not father son and holy ghost but true water baptism is in the name of jesus christ for that is the name of the person who is father who is the son who is the holy ghost and that's the name in which we are to be baptized and of course they don't want you to know that a baptismal holy spirit is not speaking in towns you see how coming now that you can understand and see the word of god see how cunning the devil is one little twist here and he changed the thing on the book of acts that it's really a revelation they received that got them excited and that caused them to speak in towns but he take the emphasis off the revelation and put it on the tongue speaking down here speaking in tongues is the evidence of the holy ghost no and then devils start to creep in amen and then devils start speaking in tongues too do you know devils speak in tongues do you know they speak in tongues better than some of the people that claim they speak in towns they got them up in toronto there and some of them fall on the ground they're quacking like ducks they're bringing like jackasses they're barking like dogs and everything this is not a joke i'm seriously because i personally hear it in my own little life of casting out devils and seeing them moving on the ground like serpents and everything else and speaking in tongues and claiming that that's the holy ghost amen god already showed me since i'm a teenager that was not the holy ghost uh that that is all mixed in there you can't differentiate it the only thing that can discern the spirits is the word of god hallelujah and the word of god descends the spirits amen you recognize what those spirits are doing amen all hell is against this teaching all hell he repeats is against this truth so this teaching is the truth it's the word of god hallelujah because he repeats because it is the truth praise the lord glory to god but you see his mystery is only revealed to his beloved bride and she's the only one that can see it amen it's the truth but they're not going to be able to recognize and see that it's the truth but this beloved bride she will recognize and she will be able to see that is the truth of the word of god hallelujah now you say well well brother branham how do you know that's right you say something and a lot of believers would even say that to you how you know that's right he said how do you know that's right well you see he the word is vindicated praise god he stopped right there but let me take it and so he didn't want to expand because he would have to talk about himself he's trying to tell them the word has already been vindicated why because he the word vindicated himself through the ministry of brother william marion branham amen when jesus came let me let me go backwards when jesus came on the earth and he said the father that dwelleth in me my father and i said what father what are you talking about amen like that and he said well the father dwelleth in me he do at the works it's not me doing these signs wonders miracles and all these things it's not me that's the father manifesting himself proving that he is in me and that he's there working in me amen he all he wants to do is to make you conscious of his presence here is that right but they couldn't see it they were blind they couldn't recognize that it was god and christ but brother branham said the time will come when christ is in the church then he says the kingdom is coming back amen wow into oneness glory to god amen that's what i'm talking about now hallelujah about the word being vindicated it vindicated itself through the ministry of william marion branham when jesus was here they said no man can do these miracles except god be with him if they had a revelation they would have said in him oh my and now in our day god sent a genuine prophet that none of them can't denounce they can't they can't find a fault there's a lamb without splat but a wrinkle amen they can't he says you find one thing wrong and i'll put a sign on my back and you call me a false prophet and lead me through the streets they can't do it not through his whole lifetime amen and no man could do all those miracles except god be with him and in him and what was that was that william branham that's why he kept trying to tell of you it's not me it is this is not about me if i can only get myself out of the way so that william branham is not even sought of and you can recognize who is doing these things who is bringing the word who is interpreting the word to you it's not william branham the god is an interpreter of his own word there is a man here that can turn on the light and they're always keep thinking he's talking about william branham they don't understand he was talking of jesus christ who was there revealing himself through that that that that prophet's body amen that veil that he was using there for the glory of god hallelujah so we can see clearly by the man's life by his acts by the signs and wonders that god used him hallelujah and most of all the restoration of the full word hallelujah and god is proven his own word he is proving that is his word that came through that man he is dead and gone but this will never die this message won't end until we are taken out of here in a rapture hallelujah and even when we are gone this message will still be fulfilled because he already talked about the coming of the two witnesses he talked about uh you know jesus coming putting his foot on mount zion he talked about russia and china attacking israel for their oil we talk about all these things hallelujah so long after we're gone we're gonna see the lord will continue to fulfill itself hallelujah because god takes the man amen oh my but he don't take the spirit and the word will continue to fulfill itself amen because it's not a man's word it just came through a man but it was not a man's word it's god's word speaking for the spirit speaks through the prophet glory to god hallelujah amen so she only his beloved bride see it's revealed to her and she's the only one that can see it amen hallelujah oh what is the son of man being revealed hallelujah revealing himself through a son of man the son of man revealing himself through a son of man that we might know that he is here a greater than solomon is here the herald already announced the presence of the king and telling us he is here but it's not a king that you can see with your eyes but he's letting you know if you're a believer and your heart lets you know that the king word the king of peace the king of righteousness is here by the opening of the word of god hallelujah thanks be to god glory to his wonderful name oh my thank god i recognize that you know the first time i read one of brother branham sermons after two books were placed in my hands while i was still in the assemblies of god denomination in their bible college there and in the third year and then these two books came into my hand when i read them i don't know because right away i can tell what this man is saying that is the voice of god speaking and i'm i'm believing it though i don't know at the time i didn't understand it but something in here bore witness that that's right hallelujah i have held to it to this day to this hour i'm holding to the lord and the word is holding to me amen because it's the truth no matter how foolish i might have seen through the years no matter how foolish or apparent to some people like a dummy you could have made a whole lot of money going this way you could have had fame if you'd done this you could that you could have been a big person if you don't this you don't and then what is naturally the devil want to tell you you're foolish you're stupid because no no you just walk away you walk away from this you walk away from that you walk away from everything else and separate yourself to the word of the living god hallelujah amen oh my you didn't have listen to like i said in the early days when the message started there wasn't even one thought or even an inclination in the message that you can get in the message to become a pastor and you can maybe get some tithings there wasn't anybody the people that were coming in there was no tithing most of the time they were needy so you took care of them so uh a real men of god they come and they take the word not because they see something that they can get but they see what the word is saying to them out of that word and they get up and they follow it like abraham did amen they follow it praise the name of the lord hallelujah praise god are you with me amen glory to god hallelujah oh my see how do you know it is right how do you know because he the word is vindicated because and he repeats he the word properly vindicated showing himself to be the head ship of the church that he is the leader he is the one in other words he is the husband of the church he is the real leadership of the church amen praise god just just let your mind run through all those messages leadership this respects that that that he was already signaling without coming right out and telling us he is here now and you he's taking the leadership away from me and i got to decree so he might increase amen praise god glory to god amen yes sir so now you see praise god it will now be the headship itself listen close being recognized by personal identification that it's in the body amen personal identification be headship itself recognizing the body by personal identifications identifying himself proves the headship to the body amen the headship to the body so praise god that he has come in and by the life that is being lived by the word in you by the supernatural identification what i'm talking about let me slow down here is no more do you have to think like the denominations believe uh signs and wonders will follow them that believe but they are going out thinking that they have to go out and do all kinds of signs and wonders to prove that they believe but it didn't say that it says signs and oneness will follow if you believe it's something that will follow in other words you won't have to go thinking you're a miracle man or a miracle woman but you pray amen by faith amen and you leave it alone amen is that right you can't tell anybody that that this is the way it's going to be that's unless god tells you you got to leave it alone amen is that right and signs and wonders will just follow you it must be so normal let's be so natural some people might think that oh um that just happened it just happened but the fact is that keeps happening over and over and over and over and over again and you still think that's just happening well that's up to you or whatever you think but that's not the way it is it's just god working that way behind the scenes because it's no more the time of pentecostals where he's gonna do miracles around a certain man or woman for people to start oh there's a miracle man there's a miracle woman oh that's a godly no he wants them to recognize him not you so you go about your business live your normal life just be ordinary yes didn't he say that in the sales he said just don't go up with your head stuck up in the air walking with a big bible to show that you're religious and all these things he says just be simple be humble be reverent and god will bless you that's what all god's asking for simplicity humility and your christianity is not an act anymore again another quote and you can find it many places he said it becomes automatic said the sheep doesn't the sheep don't have to do nothing all it's got to do is eat and the wool just comes out and all them virtues come out they don't have to do nothing it just keeps coming out they keep adding wool but not in the sense of how you think like they find a piece of wood and stick it on themselves or they add other feather to become an eagle no but because they're eating the food there's the feathers come out the wool comes out the oil comes out everything comes out and they're adding from inside out they're working out their salvation with fear and trembling they're trusting in the word of the living god hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah amen hallelujah i'm so glad that uh we are in that lifeline i'm glad we're in that line lifeline and when i'm talking about the lifeline here which i'll touch on it for just a little while the lifeline we used to sing the old hymns how many remember that old hymn throughout the life line across the dark wave there is a brother whom someone could save somebody's brother oh then well dare to out the lifeline his peril to share amen oh praise god well really throwing out the lifeline as we understand it now or should understand it is his life is the lifeline and living your life in line with his life amen backside and front sight lined up your life with his life all lined up that is really the lifeline to the people what saves or pulls the people out of their amnesia is when they see him in you that is the line that is the lifeline that they can grab onto and hold on to and be pulled into the kingdom of god hallelujah not just you going about saying i'm a christian like the young man that came to brother branham when he was sitting in his car and gave him a truck and do you know jesus and about going to heaven he's talking to the prophet of the age and he gave him on the track and when brethren turned to him so that's very nice young man that's wonderful that's fine but you know did god tell you to do this praise the lord the lord and this and then he began to talk to him but he was illustrating how that is just not like that those days and those ages for that have passed and you're trying to go back in the age when they were just printing books and printing getting the word of god out and doing those things that's the way they had to give the word out but now the word is going out as living epistles the word is going on as living words the word is going out as wonderful words of life hallelujah the word of god is expressing itself amen god expressed in his own people in his own word recognized by him and identified before the foundation of the world praise the name of the lord hallelujah amen praise god so the lifeline we have to trout is to show his life that is in us for the glory of god amen praise god and we know i i will just pass by some things there that another place he said the lifeline is really his bloodline is that right are you in his bloodline are you one of his generations are you showing to the world that you are in the bloodline of jesus christ amen and that his the life is in the blood amen and so on you can take that and run with it praise the name of the lord praise god so we find out here um that he spoke clearly um about uh joshua the scripture we read joshua too about uh rahab the harlot throwing the scarlet line outside of our house this is what the lifeline is is to show it outside your house it's for the people to see the the scarlet cord outside your house is for them to see his life expressing through you not in the bible only that's written but to be expressing itself as living word in and through you not by putting on a but being yourself just walking if the word starts to control you maybe it doesn't have full control over you and maybe now you're going to mistake you're going to say things you're going to act certain ways you're going to do this and people will see that and want to hide you know hang you high but the fact is you are pressing on the upward way and allowing god to have his way in your life you are allowing god's power to transform to change you glory to glory is changing us glory to glory is changing you changing means changing all of us by his grace amen praise god hallelujah oh praise god so that's it my brother sister is to make sure that we are part of his bloodline and you are part of his bloodline then you want to show that lifeline outside you want to throw the card out the window praise god hallelujah we'll talk about that another time but watch there clear carefully the scripture continues that i think in page 78 of christ is a mystery of god revealed nations are breaking israel's awakening the signs that the prophets foretold gentile disnumbered with horrors and cummer return or dispersed to your own for the day of redemption is near very near man's hearts are failing for fear oh be filled with god's spirit you're lamb streamed and clear look up your redemption is near he is saying here nations are breaking israel's awakening you see what i mean he has now begun to give life into his body praise god quickening power he has begun to give life into his body which is the bride so the bride now uh just before the rapture life starting to come to her life starting to come in this brain hallelujah i don't know about you but i am i've got it all over me praise god i got it inside me i got it outside me praise god and i trust that somehow the holy spirit will help me to transform some of what that is in me on me and opening up itself that you will catch that hole to god's unchanging hand that will press you right through amen amen oh praise god how do you express it other than how they always used to express it something has got a hold of me i don't know about you but i know something real got a whole of me and not only can i spiritually believe it but i am starting these days to feel it all over me i can't get away from it there's nothing i can do about it i just feel it all over me around me everywhere praise god hallelujah and i thank god for it amen oh bless his holy name he has begun to give life into his body hallelujah praise god amen is giving life to the whole bride wherever she is around the world whether she's in namibia south africa wherever she is life is going out it doesn't mean all the churches or because remember god doesn't deal with groups he deals with individuals just like when billy paul he asked him after he had preached thousands of people he says billy how many people do you think really understood what i said he said well oh praise god he said you know i i think they all understood that's why they were rejoicing and everything else he says billy how many do you really unders believe understood what i said he said well uh i i really don't know and then brother branham said not that money in a crowd of thousands only about five really caught the revelation at that time of what he was saying that's what i'm talking about so oh forget the denominations the bride may be in her we don't know who she is she can be in the message a lot of people think the bride is only in the message but she's everywhere just like when elijah thought that oh i'm the only one lord i'm the only one that stand up for the lord of hosts and god says no no no no no i got some hidden up and they're still in the denomination they're still in the eating from decibel table is that right they're right they're still in the nomination but i got them there for a reason i got them there for a purpose and later on elijah understood why they had to stay in there before they're called out or brought out but they had to stay in there for a reason for a certain time and i believe that's right now even amongst the denominations god has his bride out there amen and they're hidden up praise god and this power this life that's going out it's going to reach them wherever they are even if they're in the bowels of africa down in india if they're in the middle of the sahara and nobody else is around god can still talk to them like he talked abraham god can still meet his seed just like he did back in the bible days he is still god and he still fulfills the word of the living god amen praise god oh praise god look if you feel like getting a glass of water and you want to get the glass of water and come back that's all right you want to get up while i'm preaching and stretch so that no i'm saying it real praise the name of the lord because you know a real proper public speaking you speak only for about 30 minutes or 45 minutes at the most and that's the if you get into all the psychological things and the mental things uh the proper time to speak is so many minutes and you should end it there and so on so that's the truth that's for natural but when you get the spiritual things and you begin to preach and teach the word of god because i i spoken uh there in africa and while i'm speaking there the people sit there from mourning midday there's tilted in there and i'm telling you they don't have a roof now they're on a big tree and the sun comes down and everything else is still there and going on and everything else and uh i said no no no i gotta stop you're gonna kill me i can't take this i gotta stomp oh my oh my when i stopped brother another brother get up when he started to speak the people didn't move no all of them didn't get the revelation but i'm sure a lot of them were getting it praise the name of the lord well praise god hallelujah a similar thing has happened right here in uh america down in the southern parts amen praise the lord hallelujah but now he's talking about israel awakening now you see this is what we're talking about brother branham didn't say what i'm going to say here in the word but it's like when i read that i can literally like see what he was thinking and what he would what he couldn't say it's too much for him to put all them things and tell the people at that time why are you talking about this aaron's rod that was left in the temple there somebody cut down a stick and made a rod for iron and a rod that was a healthy growing tree type of the bright thrift grows and uh things like that that thing dried up after a while but then when they brought it back and they put aaron's rod in the holy holies in front of the arctic covenant and stick it there in the ground when they go back the things start budding out of this dry stick this dry wood just like the bright tree comes out of a stump that was chopped down in the ground and everybody thought it was dead and everything else all of a sudden the thing starts blooming again the bible tells us and there how errands rod not only budded and bloomed it start to bear almonds they start to bear fruit almonds amen well what is talking about there when you see israel waking up top life coming into the bride in this hour that she might do what come to life bloom blossom again and bring forth life giving fruit from out of the word of god amen or what our what a time what a day we're living in amen yes sir and what is she going to bring forth almonds like in the time of no she is going to bring forth the original life because that should come from the original seed your original life is now blooming blossoming and coming forth for the glory of the living god amen praise god hallelujah i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them hallelujah how she come true i i got it written here this is me just put this down here how did bright street come through all these ages and now the life coming to the body brings her into a time when she began to bud she's come through that amen and she can always go through that when another person sees it just begin and just born into it and sees it hallelujah and then she begins to blossom praise god but i believe for believers who have caught the word for some time she is now ripening amen the fruit is ripening right there on the vine hallelujah and she has now entered into her harvest time praise god she come from root to blood to blossom back to the fruit amen time for the harvest amen the holy spirit of the living god comes on the scene to harvest his own word fruit from his own word fruit from his own fig tree fruit from his own vine for the glory of god hallelujah what a lifeline you can't even get rid of it that's not a lifeline that you can bust and break and and the person it breaks and and goes out like that praise god hallelujah amen now i'm going to i'm going to wind this up very quickly coming now to wisdom versus faith and say to you and now the only way that he can ever live that we can ever live is because we have eternal life that's the only way we can ever live and he he didn't put this word but forever is to have eternal life that's the only way we can ever live for this the body dies and all of the parts of that dies but that part that's in there that is eternal and it is god and it cannot die do you believe it [Applause] [Music] hallelujah it can't die but all this outside man all these parts human parts it will die but you will live forever because that gene on the inside of you is god and god can't die and you won't die hallelujah amen he one time you know he he quoted he said he that live that and believe it on me hath everlasting life praise god he said did you notice past tense he already had it no he didn't say that he just said he said do you notice past tense but really he's trying to you already had eternal life from beyond the foundation of the world but now you're living and you cut revelation you see what happened back there and you recognize that you have eternal life and you can't die the being in there the gene can't die hallelujah because that gene comes from god and is a part of the pillar of fire it's a part of the logos it's a part of god hallelujah it's one little lick of flame off of the big pillar of fire that dwells in you and me praise god forevermore oh praise god hallelujah you'll see how wonderful this great uh plan of god is that god sent down a a part of himself in the form of a gene hallelujah in us to fulfill his divine purpose amen hallelujah and we are resting on that not on our works not in our wisdom not our knowledge not anything we can do or we accomplish we cast down our crowns at the king of kings we cast our achievements we cast out our greatness our riches we cast everything down at the feet of the lamb of god for word is the lamb he broke the shield and brought us back to our senses the prophet many times will be preaching this suddenly so he says oh come to your senses what was that he's not just talking your five senses here is working but he's trying to bring the people out of the amnesia to come back to your spiritual sense of faith and love in god and in the word of the living god hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah amen praise the lord so understand clearly then i am not preaching here so you can get more so that you can get a bigger piece of eternal life because you can't none of us can get a bigger piece depending doesn't matter which age you're in doesn't matter how long you've been in the message or how short all the workers get the same pay some work from morning till night and they still get the same pay as the one who come in at three o'clock four o'clock in the afternoon the same day oh lord i serve you i went here i went there did this no he says it's my money and i have the right that to give but pay whatever who i want to pay you're going to argue with me so isn't this what you agreed for that that if you work for me that i'll give you this pay says yes he says well then you have nothing to say i want to pay the guy he's only working from three to four and then he goes home but he gets the same pain amen and that's what i want to tell you it doesn't matter whether you're young you're old you're just start to recognize you just came to know it hallelujah but or if you've been in the message since 65 or 50 whatever don't you feel that you have any spiritual complex of anybody because they oh i've been in the message now you should be listening to me because i've been here for 50 years i've been here you should have no complex none whatsoever you stand on the word of the living god because that's the bride stand is to stand on the ward stand on his promise and hold to god's unchanging hand amen hallelujah oh praise god amen how wonderful now that part that is eternal is god and it cannot die the word the bible is eternal because that is god in word form see oh my but what is in god was in god in his thoughts before there was any were spoken word all of it was god amen it was god hallelujah let me go back over that the part that's eternal is god and cannot die now the word the bible is eternal because it is god in word form and what was in god in his thoughts before there was any spoken word or before god spoke it it was all god hallelujah amen oh my praise god what is in you you all that is in you is you i don't it doesn't matter whether it's a fingernail it's you uh whether it's your eyebrow it's still you whether it's a stranded hair it's you you see anything that was in god at the time when it's taking even though it was not even spoke as yet because a word is a thought is that right then when the thought is spoken the thought becomes spoken word and when the spoken word is believed and comes into a person a believer and they begin to live that word it becomes the living epistles living word but go back don't let it blow your mind where did all this word or the life line the line of life you followed now where did it all come from it was in god and it was god it was part of god you lit with god little messiah acts praise god by the grace of god hallelujah amen yes sir oh my he just set down his word down here amen amen and so we are parts of him that are eternal amen i thank god and now you can sit and listen to hear the rolling thunder and the thunder roll from out of the word of god and you're not scared of the thunders now because you recognize a voice you recognize the voice but other people just hear noise lots of noise a lot of jumping a lot of screaming i look i was in all those meetings matter of fact i was there before it started i was there right in the brother's house and god used brother joseph coleman to make the entire bride around this world to become conscious you better start paying attention to those seven thunders you better start going in and all the brothers start studying and looking into those things and it woke the whole bridal it woke him up praise the name of the lord but then he fulfilled his purpose amen praise god but you see those seven thunders didn't come to give us more eternal life the seven thunders just came to sound out and wake up the seed that was already laying there to make it come awake look i don't know if the doctors still do it now but back in the old days when a baby was born the doctor would grab the baby by the two feet pick it up and give that baby a slap on the bum pow and i didn't say speak in tongues but praise god what did the seven thunders give that baby life did the slap give the baby life or that slap only allowed the baby to manifest that it has life it just woke up and come to life and prove that it it's a thing is the life thing is in it praise the name of the lord oh my glory god hallelujah [Applause] yes sir oh praise god see see so all the the great mighty things we've had the seven seals the the seven thunders it shows you these things to bring you up the amnesia to bring you back to life bring you to your senses bring it to yourself you recognize who you are and who he is oh praise god hallelujah amen glory to god amen glory to god hallelujah now you want to give me a little more time i got five minutes to one normally we end at one o'clock sometimes we end a little before but today uh you know i i did a lot of praying and a little a lot of studying in the word of god and the whole week was taken up i was taken up with the word and then so that's why i got to get this stuff out of me so put up with me just for a little while more now he continues hallelujah that was predestinated that was predestinated was the thing that was with god in eternity what that was predestinated the thing that was in god in eternity the oh my what was the thing that was with god way back in eternity the germ the gene praise god now let's go and expand on that a little bit more you you remember when the angel came to mary he says the holy thing that will be born of thee amen brother brethren saying now this predestinated thing amen praise god so we got some predestinated things some sacred things of god hallelujah in this hour born from the word of god holy things of god that were in god and set down here to fulfill purpose praise god god bless you all today and i want you to just quickly recap here because i said a lot of things and i want you to pick them in your heart and remember them and grow by them amen so today what we talked about really is that god is not only we were in him but he is in us we spoke furthermore on the word of life amen for the word gives life we touched on the supreme importance not just of revelation but of individual revelation then we touched on why all hell is against this teaching of individual revelation and of all the other things that they uh corrupt controve church doesn't want you to know and we touched on certain things god being one god jesus being the christ water baptism being in the name of jesus and the origin of sin and so on praise the lord of god hallelujah and then we touched on the headship of the word of god the word the revealed word is the headship over the his body the word of god wants to take preeminence of our lives so that he might manifest himself as the head of the entire body then we touched upon the lifeline and what it is a little bit that it's the bloodline that we're in a line of his life living our life in line with his life proving that we are in his bloodline and that we are of his generation for the prophets already prophesied and he shall see his generation right so we are proving that by living the word of god hallelujah the great bloodline and we touched also and emphasized that you always had eternal life you always had eternal life you can't get more of it you can't get less of it you can't be taken out of it whatever but you always had eternal life just like a son can't get his father's blood out of his veins he can't do it anymore he's just a son what's he going to do about it he can be a bad son he can be a wicked son he could be a disobedient son but he is still a son it is not his condition you have to worry about it is his position because his positions of sonship his condition might be sinful his condition might be error and what not but he's still a son of the living god hallelujah amen and then lastly we just touched on recognizing you're a part or you have a part of that holy thing in you that holy thing being the germ the gene of god within your heart is that right we have an anchor that keeps the soul what is that anchor and we just imagine like you got an anchor and you you throw it up there in heaven and and it hook on to something and you're going to escape this world by climbing up that rope no the lifeline is in you the haven of rest is right there you you come to a blessed assurance you come to us peaceful rest because you know the germ the gene the attribute is in you and that is what is your blessing the show runs that you are going to make it open on the other side hallelujah and so i thank god that in this hour the great eagle is once again passing over the barnyard as we have said it before and when he looks down and he looks at us he sees a small token of god in you a portion of god that's what he sees in you and by seeing that token in you he comes to claim that token is that right that's why the holy spirit baptizes you into himself into himself who is work is washing all over you right see because he sees that and he waters that by the grace of god and quickens you and what does he do brings you all to the world brings you from the flesh brings you from the influence of the devil what i'm saying he brings you out of the devil's pawn shop [Music] and while you were in that pawnshop the devil had temporary control but now thank god you're free you're a new creation [Applause] that god has only now come to claim his own property it was always his property he just left it in the world he let's allow it to go in the pawn shop hallelujah but but he has a token and and there's a token that's in there and that's token is there so he comes the holy spirit comes part of the token and he looks for the other part of the token to see if they're going to fit and when they fit the deep calls to the deep and a deep response and there comes an invisible union a perfect realization a recognition of who you really are praise god may the lord bless you [Applause] hallelujah oh praise god you coming brother it's all right you can stagger up here or whatever if you're drunk in the
