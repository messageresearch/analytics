[36:11] bless speaking of which God bless
[36:17] amen God bless you all um I want to
[36:21] start off by saying I'm so happy to see
[36:24] everyone um this 2024 I I should say
[36:28] 2023 2024 has probably been the
[36:33] hardest year and a half of my life um I
[36:37] went through a lot of challenges long
[36:39] story sto long story short uh 2023 I
[36:44] suffered a stroke here at church and
[36:47] that led to a series of different
[36:51] medical conditions that battled my body
[36:56] and for a very long time doctors could
[36:58] not identify what the problem was I I
[37:03] can't tell you how many different
[37:04] diagnoses I was given how many
[37:07] medications I was being treated for
[37:10] illnesses I didn't even have um and by
[37:14] God's grace you know um last May I had
[37:19] an incident where I ended up in the
[37:21] hospital and God introduced me I believe
[37:25] God introduced me to a
[37:28] neurologist that decided to do a series
[37:32] of tests um a full body screening of of
[37:37] everything basically and from there
[37:40] that's when um the doors started opening
[37:43] and answers started to become clear um I
[37:47] started to get definite um diagnosis of
[37:50] what the problem was but I was still
[37:53] under the influence of many many drugs
[37:56] that they were giving me
[37:58] um you know fantinel
[38:00] hydromorph all sorts of things I was
[38:03] literally
[38:05] Frozen um and uh finally uh fast forward
[38:10] to August of this year um I was at home
[38:14] with my parents and I just I couldn't
[38:16] get up I couldn't walk I couldn't move I
[38:18] could barely talk uh I lost all my
[38:21] colors we get to the hospital and the
[38:24] doctors tell us that my elect
[38:28] basically everything that keeps a person
[38:30] alive was almost at
[38:33] zero and had I stayed home that day I
[38:37] could have potentially suffered a
[38:38] cardiac ATR and not be here today um
[38:43] there are so many things that the doctor
[38:45] said to me that I would not be able to
[38:48] do I believe now that I look
[38:52] back I believe that there was a special
[38:55] thing that happened to me a lot of the
[38:58] abilities that were taken away from me
[39:01] during this time are things that make me
[39:05] who I am um my ability to speak clearly
[39:10] process information
[39:12] quickly
[39:13] um it kind of made Me puffed up you know
[39:17] I kind of be became a person that you
[39:21] know started to see myself greater than
[39:24] you know getting promotions at work
[39:27] getting hunt head hunted for
[39:29] opportunities and it really I'm gonna
[39:32] say it made me arrogant and funny enough
[39:36] everything that happened to me took away
[39:39] those abilities um I could barely speak
[39:43] I can barely you know my cognitive
[39:45] skills
[39:46] decreased and I was knocked down a peg
[39:50] two or three or even
[39:52] four and um I kind of realized that it's
[39:57] not me it is a god that is allowing me
[40:02] to be able to do EV everything that I'm
[40:05] able to do achieve all of the things
[40:07] that I'm able to do and the glory
[40:11] belongs to him the total praise belongs
[40:14] to him not to me um and fast forward
[40:19] again to
[40:20] October uh there was a doctor that I
[40:24] also came in contact with at Toronto
[40:27] Western Hospital which is the neurology
[40:29] center for the pro pro uh province of
[40:32] Ontario and he recommended a program for
[40:36] me um there's normally a two-year
[40:39] waiting list for this
[40:41] program um and I got into the program
[40:45] within like a couple of days of being
[40:49] referred
[40:51] um and at that program a lot of things
[40:56] were made clear
[40:58] but the moving thing for me is when I
[41:01] came out of that program the one thing
[41:03] that I struggled with a lot is my faith
[41:07] things would happen such such as memory
[41:11] loss and it just knock me down and be
[41:15] like what what is going on and my faith
[41:19] would constantly waver you know I would
[41:22] go into this phase of wo is me his
[41:25] self-pity you know wake up up in the
[41:28] middle of the night to look at my kids
[41:29] my husband to see I don't know if I'm
[41:31] going to see them
[41:34] tomorrow when I came out of the hospital
[41:37] in October I was put at a crossroad I
[41:42] believe God put me at a crossroad and
[41:46] going left meant that I continued in
[41:49] that wo was me State and going right
[41:52] meant that I put my faith in the Lord
[41:56] and and I trust that whatever his desire
[42:00] for my life is he will fulfill it
[42:04] according to his will
[42:07] and once I did
[42:11] that I called Pastor and I said I feel
[42:16] great I decided that I was going to stop
[42:19] hiding um there are a lot of there are
[42:22] still a lot of things that still happen
[42:24] to me I still suffer from seizures and
[42:27] whatnot but I said I'm going to start
[42:30] coming to church I'm not going to stay
[42:31] home
[42:32] anymore um I spoke to those around me
[42:36] the deacons and whatnot and said you
[42:38] know if this happens no need to call
[42:40] ambulance this is what you need to do to
[42:42] help me um you know recover in that
[42:45] moment and that has allowed me to come
[42:49] back into church and to hear messages
[42:52] God is
[42:53] speaking and I believe that there is
[42:56] something very very special in store for
[42:59] this ministry for this body of people in
[43:03] within under this ministry for me in
[43:07] 2025
[43:09] and I can't wait I'm looking forward to
[43:12] it and I'm happy I'm strong I am
[43:15] choosing to look forward brother Mike

[43:22] to go back to where I was or to who I
[43:26] was instead I want to look forward I
[43:29] want to keep moving forward and be led
[43:33] by the Lord so um I'm going to sing this
[43:36] song which is a song that has been with
[43:40] me um and has gotten me through a lot of

[1:31:27] matters I know that uh it is written in
[1:31:31] the word that he gives and he
[1:31:34] takes and we should always bless his
[1:31:38] name the last this year
[1:31:42] was very challenging for me and my
[1:31:47] family I I had my son this year in
[1:31:50] February and God blessed me with a
[1:31:52] healthy baby uh he's Joshua you all know
[1:31:56] him and then
[1:31:58] in I conceived uh again and this time it
[1:32:03] was a baby
[1:32:05] girl but somehow God has some other
[1:32:08] plans uh he decided to get that baby
[1:32:11] girl again with
[1:32:14] him and uh I went through a process uh a
[1:32:19] procedure that that's a termination
[1:32:22] process and and um there was lot of
[1:32:26] complications in that process and I
[1:32:30] didn't knew I came home after the
[1:32:32] delivery everything after happened I
[1:32:34] came
[1:32:35] home I didn't know that I was having a
[1:32:38] uterus infection I didn't knew and it
[1:32:42] was something not really good uh the
[1:32:46] even my lungs were shining I didn't know
[1:32:49] I I I didn't knew that if anything was
[1:32:53] happening in inside me everything was
[1:32:55] normal but then one uh like one night I
[1:32:59] felt like something is wrong with me I
[1:33:02] don't know somehow
[1:33:04] God like put that thought in my mind and
[1:33:07] I started feeling something is not right
[1:33:09] I told Joseph that I'm not feeling right
[1:33:12] I I I think something is going wrong and
[1:33:15] then I messaged my Midwife and then he

[1:33:38] inside of me and which can lead to a
[1:33:41] hemorrhage and which can even cause
[1:33:44] death but then God was there with me he

[1:50:52] you know last octob uh last March I went
[1:50:56] to uh my wife and I decided to take a
[1:50:58] trip and we went down to Arizona and it
[1:51:00] was probably the the mo the best trip
[1:51:05] I've ever been on anyway and not just
[1:51:07] because of my wife which was lovely and
[1:51:10] everything like that but the Lord just
[1:51:11] did so much there that it just uh kind
[1:51:14] of was amazing to me what he did there
[1:51:16] there were people there that we had to
[1:51:18] meet that we had to talk to that had to
[1:51:22] uh hear about this Revelation that we
[1:51:24] know all right and it was really a
[1:51:26] supernatural trip but on that
[1:51:30] trip um I started to feel like there was
[1:51:33] a headache a headache was was just in
[1:51:37] the background and we were doing a lot
[1:51:39] of Drive-In and I thought oh I don't
[1:51:41] know what that is this headache but then
[1:51:43] the next day the headache was there and
[1:51:45] the next day the headache was there and
[1:51:47] then it started growing a little bit we
[1:51:49] flew home God moving like crazy down
[1:51:52] there it was just incredible what he was
[1:51:54] doing I've never seen he's never used us
[1:51:58] like that before and and it was really
[1:52:00] something and yet this headache was
[1:52:02] there and and I got home and uh over the
[1:52:06] next month all the headache did was get
[1:52:09] worse but it would it would be fine in
[1:52:11] the morning but by the time the evening
[1:52:12] came oh I had just a pain I would if I
[1:52:15] did anything if I uh bent over to tie my
[1:52:18] shoes or if I exerted myself trouble if
[1:52:22] if I sneezed big trouble if I coughed
[1:52:26] even worse and this went on from from
[1:52:29] last March and it continued to go on and
[1:52:31] on and on and I thought oh boy I better
[1:52:33] go see a doctor so I went seeing a
[1:52:34] doctor he couldn't find anything wrong
[1:52:36] and uh anyway so it went on like that
[1:52:40] and and I was praying Lord you got to
[1:52:42] heal me I remember I went in with the
[1:52:44] Deacon's office remember Brothers we
[1:52:45] went in and I said hey pray for me and
[1:52:48] the brothers laid their hands on me and
[1:52:50] anointed me with oil and uh after that
[1:52:53] it it was a month or two after that
[1:52:56] still the headaches were there and um
[1:53:00] but I just said I'm I beli in God and
[1:53:03] God spoke to me in in in the uh I know
[1:53:05] I'm going to take up some time brother
[1:53:06] Danny but or pastor but anyway I'm going
[1:53:08] to do it because they sang that song God
[1:53:10] spoke to me one one service and he says
[1:53:14] yeah you get headaches and and and this
[1:53:16] is before any he knew anything he say
[1:53:18] you get headaches well you're going to
[1:53:20] have to depend on God for this one
[1:53:23] and I said all right I'm going to depend
[1:53:24] on God so anyway about a month
[1:53:28] ago I went and uh as at work and I I
[1:53:32] pulled a muscle in my back higher higher
[1:53:35] back this thing was was I know people
[1:53:38] have had back problems here and
[1:53:39] everything like that and uh I can relate
[1:53:41] to you uh but it wasn't lower back or
[1:53:43] anything it was just one muscle high in
[1:53:45] my back I went home one Sunday after
[1:53:48] church and whatnot at night I went to
[1:53:50] bed and and uh I lied down and I had to
[1:53:52] get up and my wife had to help took me
[1:53:54] took me 10 minutes to to help me out of
[1:53:56] the bed like that the pain was so bad in
[1:53:57] my back and I said oh boy she said hey
[1:54:00] why don't you take a muscle uh relaxer
[1:54:03] if was you know like that and I said
[1:54:05] well you got one she goes yeah so so she
[1:54:07] gave me a muscle relaxer I took it I was
[1:54:10] able to sleep that night I got up the
[1:54:11] next morning I went to work and I took
[1:54:13] another one you know just because while
[1:54:16] I was at work um just trying to stretch
[1:54:19] it out and make it feel better and uh
[1:54:23] then after two days I realized I haven't
[1:54:26] had a
[1:54:28] headache and I
[1:54:29] thought this is the first time I've
[1:54:33] every day that thing was coming it was
[1:54:35] headache it was terrible and I didn't
[1:54:37] have a
[1:54:39] headache and then my my back was feeling
[1:54:41] better so I stopped taking the mus
[1:54:43] muscle relax relaxer I didn't take
[1:54:45] anymore I'm not one for pills anyway I
[1:54:48] if I take a if you take a Tylenol you
[1:54:50] can probably take two Tylenols if I take
[1:54:51] one Tylen all it's like knocks me out
[1:54:54] but um do you know that from that moment
[1:54:58] on I have no more headaches everything
[1:55:01] is gone I can do whatever I want to do I
[1:55:04] am better than I was before the
[1:55:07] headache and you see God you know what
[1:55:10] did God do all I know is he answered my
[1:55:11] prayer it took him right up to that was
[1:55:14] in October so it took him whatever Seven
[1:55:16] 8 nine months but he passed me through
[1:55:19] it and I said Lord I'm trusted in you
[1:55:22] however you want to do it I don't know
[1:55:23] what the muscle relaxer did I have no

[2:08:21] your prayers and your support and it has
[2:08:25] truly been uh the backbone and the
[2:08:27] strength of of my ministry as a minister

[2:08:51] been a a a strong and mighty support uh
[2:08:56] standing next to me at these um you know
[2:09:00] at this time in our lives it's been a
[2:09:02] great challenge we've had to endure many
[2:09:06] many attacks of the enemy but we knew we
[2:09:10] were told that you know uh that this is
[2:09:13] you know a leader when he goes and takes
[2:09:16] the place you know he's the shepherd the
[2:09:19] enemy is going to try to strike he's
[2:09:21] going to do everything in his power to
[2:09:23] strike the shepherd so that the Sheep
[2:09:26] will scatter it's as simple as that and
[2:09:29] I am fully aware of that and um I'm
[2:09:34] prepared I'm a
[2:09:36] soldier I'm willing to stand and take
[2:09:40] the bullets if
[2:09:41] necessary and that is something that
[2:09:44] only God can put it into the heart of a
[2:09:47] of a pastor and a minister it's a it's a
[2:09:50] calling that only he can prepare and
[2:09:54] stand behind and vindicate and this I
[2:09:58] can truly say um I'm grateful for the
[2:10:02] Lord's support and his standing uh next
[2:10:06] to me and my wife in this position I
[2:10:09] want to thank God for the example that
[2:10:13] our former Pastor John Simon and sister
[2:10:17] Desiree set and the footprint
[2:10:21] and the strong uh hold that they placed
[2:10:27] in their
[2:10:28] Ministry upon the
[2:10:32] dedication
[2:10:33] to the service of the Lord and the
[2:10:36] example that he placed in front of me
[2:10:39] and my wife and truly they are pillars
[2:10:44] they continue to encourage and
[2:10:46] strengthen us they're still in the
[2:10:49] background Pastor Simon is still uh very
[2:10:54] strong amen you know it was the Lord
[2:10:57] that that that told him that it was time
[2:11:00] for him to step aside but not because he
[2:11:03] was getting weaker is because God has a
[2:11:07] purpose and a plan and we need to submit
[2:11:10] to that purpose and to that
[2:11:12] plan we we don't know God's uh perfect
[2:11:17] plan but we know that he is is working
[2:11:22] it
[2:11:23] perfectly amen and so all we can do is
[2:11:26] continue to surrender and trust him we
[2:11:29] love and appreciate every one of you we
[2:11:32] thank you for your support through the
[2:11:34] whole year um continue to
[2:11:37] pray I'm just as much under expectation
[2:11:41] for 2025 as you are but I believe that
[2:11:46] God started the work he's the author
[2:11:48] he's the finisher he's not going to
[2:11:51] Place Us in the front line to lose we
[2:11:54] already know that he's won the battle
[2:11:57] amen praise God so God bless each and
[2:12:00] every one of you as we move now um into
[2:12:05] 2025 Pastor Simon was in contact with me
[2:12:08] this afternoon and sends his greetings
[2:12:12] and wishes each and every one of you God
[2:12:16] bless you God Prosper you that was their
[2:12:20] prayer he said says that the Lord will
[2:12:22] bless and prosper each and every one of

[2:12:35] uh our slide this evening um we're going
[2:12:38] to be um entering into
[2:12:41] 2025 but in order to do that we need to
[2:12:45] burn some
[2:12:47] ships amen we need to burn some ships
[2:12:51] and so this is what we're going to be
[2:12:53] looking at this evening before we enter
[2:12:55] into our Lord's Supper um you'll notice
[2:12:58] that there's papers that have been
[2:13:00] placed in front of you on the pews uh
[2:13:03] they will be used later into the service
[2:13:06] you'll you'll have an opportunity as we
[2:13:09] go through the service you'll understand
[2:13:10] exactly what it is that we're doing
[2:13:13] let's go to the first scripture
[2:13:16] amen Luke chapter 9 verse 59-62
[2:13:24] and he said unto another follow
[2:13:28] me but he said Lord suffer me first to
[2:13:33] go and bury my Father and Jesus saith
[2:13:36] unto him let the dead bury the dead but
[2:13:40] go thou and preach the kingdom of God
[2:13:44] and another also said Lord I will follow
[2:13:46] thee but let me first go bid them
[2:13:49] farewell which are at home at my house
[2:13:52] and Jesus said unto him no man having
[2:13:55] put his hand to the plow and looking
[2:13:58] back is fit for the kingdom of God Amen
[2:14:03] let us pray father we thank you so much
[2:14:06] tonight Lord as we close this year
[2:14:09] father we look to enhance and move
[2:14:14] forward and not to look to the left or
[2:14:18] to the right but to just look straight
[2:14:20] ahead father father and and let go of
[2:14:23] all the things that have held us back
[2:14:26] and have you know uh been a hindrance in
[2:14:28] any way shape or form tonight Lord we
[2:14:31] want this to be a time of of change like
[2:14:35] never before we will never be the same
[2:14:39] after tonight we believe it with all of
[2:14:42] our hearts father that tonight we are
[2:14:45] going to burn some ships and we are
[2:14:47] going to enter into new land father
[2:14:50] where all things are possible to them
[2:14:53] that believe Lord add your blessing to
[2:14:55] the word of God tonight Prosper each and
[2:14:58] every one of us anoint speaker and
[2:15:00] hearer in the name of Jesus Christ we
[2:15:02] pray amen and amen God bless you Saints
[2:15:05] you may be
[2:15:10] seated glory to God burning the ships
[2:15:14] requires us to be
[2:15:17] courageous it's going to be something
[2:15:19] that we need to be courageous and ready
[2:15:21] to do and th although there are
[2:15:24] different accounts of a ship Commander
[2:15:27] doing this the most famous account is
[2:15:30] that of a Spanish explorer by the name
[2:15:33] of Hernan
[2:15:35] Cortez in 1518 Cortez was ordered to
[2:15:39] explore the interior of Mexico at that
[2:15:44] minute at the last
[2:15:46] minute Val Vasquez who was
[2:15:51] Diego Velasquez he was a uh Conquistador
[2:15:55] and the first governor of
[2:15:58] Cuba and in uh
[2:16:00] 1511 he led the successful conquest and
[2:16:04] colonization of Cuba so he was the
[2:16:07] governor that was giving instruction and
[2:16:10] at the last minute he told hernand
[2:16:14] Cortez not to go through however he went
[2:16:19] through they land landed in Mexico in
[2:16:23] 1519 worried that his crew might desert
[2:16:26] him and go back to Spain Cortez wrecked
[2:16:30] his ships and left the men no choice but
[2:16:33] to follow him he wanted them to realize
[2:16:36] there was no opportunity to
[2:16:39] retreat they had to give their fight
[2:16:42] everything they had failure was not an
[2:16:45] option we win or we
[2:16:48] perish they won
[2:16:51] two years later Cortez succeeded in the
[2:16:54] conquest of the Aztec
[2:16:57] empire the concept of burning
[2:17:01] ships goes back further in history than
[2:17:05] that it was Napoleon Hill that wrote a
[2:17:08] long while ago a great warrior faced a
[2:17:11] situation which made it necessary for
[2:17:13] him to make a a decision which ensured
[2:17:16] his success on the
[2:17:18] battlefield he was about to send his
[2:17:21] armies against a powerful foe whose men
[2:17:25] outnumbered his
[2:17:27] own he loaded his shoulders his soldiers
[2:17:31] onto the boat sailed to the enemy's
[2:17:34] country unloaded the soldiers and the
[2:17:36] equipment then gave the order to burn
[2:17:39] the
[2:17:41] ships that had carried them addressing
[2:17:44] his men before the first battle he said
[2:17:47] you see the boats going up in smoke he
[2:17:50] says that means that we cannot leave
[2:17:53] these Shores unless we
[2:17:56] win that's the only way that we will
[2:17:59] leave the shores alive is by
[2:18:02] winning Jesus Christ is not going to
[2:18:07] lose the battle he's already won the
[2:18:10] battle he's already won the battle in
[2:18:13] your life amen he's already given us a
[2:18:16] way to escape this world of the
[2:18:20] battlefield that we deal with each and
[2:18:23] every
[2:18:24] day it's a very extreme way of doing
[2:18:28] things when you say to burn the ships
[2:18:31] you'd have to be ready to give yourself
[2:18:34] completely over to the
[2:18:36] cause and I trust that there's people in
[2:18:39] here tonight that have decided to follow
[2:18:42] Jesus and have given completely over to
[2:18:45] that
[2:18:46] cause amen can you identify with that
[2:18:50] amen amen but it takes Extreme
[2:18:53] Measures to give us the motivation to
[2:18:58] succeed sometimes unless less than
[2:19:01] burning the boats won't work you're
[2:19:05] going to have to let go of certain
[2:19:07] things that are holding you back that
[2:19:09] have been keeping you in a in a in a
[2:19:13] condition from doing all that God wants
[2:19:16] to do in your life you're going to have
[2:19:19] to let go of hurts and sorrows and pains
[2:19:23] and things that that that you you know
[2:19:26] have have hindered your life over the
[2:19:28] last year because as sons of God we are
[2:19:32] living day to day right right yes we're
[2:19:37] leaving a year behind but tomorrow will
[2:19:39] be the start of a new year and it'll be
[2:19:42] a new day and it'll be a new challenge
[2:19:45] and it'll be new opportunities amen
[2:19:49] making a commitment like this would show
[2:19:51] how serious we are at leaving the old
[2:19:54] behind and embracing the
[2:19:57] new I want you all to know that tonight
[2:20:00] we have a great leader in the Lord Jesus
[2:20:03] Christ amen and so you don't have to
[2:20:06] worry if he shows you to burn some ships
[2:20:10] and leave them behind don't worry he's a
[2:20:12] great leader he will guide you he will
[2:20:15] direct you he will take you through amen
[2:20:19] praise God let's go to the the next
[2:20:22] slide
[2:20:23] Malachi 3 verse
[2:20:27] 2:3 or chapter 4: 2-3 he says but who
[2:20:31] may be able who may abide the day of his
[2:20:36] coming and who shall stand when he
[2:20:39] appear for he is like a Refiner's Fire
[2:20:44] and like Fuller soap and he shall sit as
[2:20:47] a refiner and purifier of silver silver
[2:20:51] and he shall purify the sons of Levi and
[2:20:54] purge them as gold and silver that they
[2:20:58] may offer unto the Lord an offering in
[2:21:02] righteousness I believe that we've got a
[2:21:05] leader who is a
[2:21:07] purifier he's a refining fire he can
[2:21:11] Purge the sin and unbelief in your life
[2:21:14] regardless of how how hard or how
[2:21:18] difficult it might appear to you you
[2:21:20] right now I can assure you he's a
[2:21:23] refiner he will Purge you he will do
[2:21:27] everything necessary in order to make
[2:21:29] you one of his righteous one of his sons
[2:21:33] one of his daughters that will be those
[2:21:36] that will bring the word of God deliver
[2:21:38] the word of God to this last generation
[2:21:41] that we are living
[2:21:43] in
[2:21:46] amen we're going to be looking at Elisha
[2:21:51] as we read the scripture from First
[2:21:52] Kings
[2:21:54] 19: 19- 21 and it talks about Elijah's
[2:21:58] actions after
[2:22:00] Elijah commissioned him to be his
[2:22:04] successor let's look at what happened
[2:22:06] when Elijah when Elijah passed the torch
[2:22:10] to
[2:22:11] Elisha just like in our day we've had an
[2:22:16] Elijah and that Elijah has gone off the
[2:22:19] scene amen but there's an
[2:22:22] Elisha that has that's riding the trail
[2:22:25] again that has taken the word taking the
[2:22:29] torch and is willing to do all that is
[2:22:32] necessary to fulfill the purpose and the
[2:22:35] plan of God that he's given us in this
[2:22:37] day and in this hour let's read our next
[2:22:39] scripture First Kings 19 so he departed
[2:22:43] then and found Elisha the son of shapat
[2:22:47] who was plowing with 12 Yol of oxen
[2:22:50] before for him and he with the 12 and
[2:22:54] Elijah passed by him and cast his mantle
[2:22:58] upon him and he left the oxen and ran
[2:23:02] after Elijah and said let me I pray thee
[2:23:06] kiss my father and my mother and then I
[2:23:10] will follow thee and he said unto him go
[2:23:13] back again for what have I done to thee
[2:23:17] and he returned back from him and took a
[2:23:20] yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled
[2:23:24] their flesh with the
[2:23:27] instruments of The
[2:23:29] Oxen and gave unto the people and they
[2:23:33] did eat then he arose and went after
[2:23:36] Elijah and ministered unto him now I
[2:23:41] want you to notice here
[2:23:45] that Elijah placed his mantle upon
[2:23:49] Elisha
[2:23:51] and Elisha
[2:23:53] immediately said to Elijah let me go and
[2:23:57] deal with whatever it is that I need to
[2:23:58] deal with he wasn't saying that he that
[2:24:01] that that he like that that he was going
[2:24:03] to not take the commission he said I got
[2:24:07] some things that I need to deal with and
[2:24:09] I want you to notice what he did he went
[2:24:12] back and he he took the oxen and the
[2:24:16] Bible says that he took the
[2:24:18] instruments to boil
[2:24:21] the meat in other words he burned all
[2:24:25] the equipment right that he was using in
[2:24:29] order to plow his farm in his
[2:24:32] Fields he was willing to burn everything
[2:24:37] because he knew that he was never going
[2:24:39] to go back yes that's right he took all
[2:24:43] the instruments he placed them into the
[2:24:46] fire he put the meat into the fire he
[2:24:49] cooked up a great Feast I can imagine
[2:24:51] listen the scripture doesn't say exactly
[2:24:54] what he did you know and what actually
[2:24:57] happened but I can imagine if we go into
[2:24:59] our minds we can see Elisha going back
[2:25:02] to let his parents know that hey I've
[2:25:05] received a commission I've received one
[2:25:08] of the greatest commissions that could
[2:25:10] possibly ever have been placed on my
[2:25:13] life because I've witnessed the
[2:25:15] testimony of Elijah and What the Lord
[2:25:18] Has Done through him and now now the
[2:25:20] Lord is calling me to do the same but he
[2:25:23] knew that he had to burn everything and
[2:25:26] leave everything behind because he was
[2:25:28] never going to go back amen listen he
[2:25:32] was not some poor
[2:25:36] individual he had 12 oxen he had all the
[2:25:40] equipment he was plowing he probably had
[2:25:42] a big
[2:25:44] farm so you know he was leaving behind
[2:25:48] sometimes it's hard to leave behind our
[2:25:50] our you know Financial gains and and and
[2:25:54] the successes of Our Lives when God
[2:25:57] comes and calls us to burn the ships and
[2:26:00] now come and serve
[2:26:02] me
[2:26:04] amen and so that garment when he placed
[2:26:08] it upon his shoulders the duties of
[2:26:10] being a prophet would now be on his
[2:26:13] shoulders God has given us a commission
[2:26:18] to take this gospel to take this word
[2:26:20] word and to and to bring it to a to a a
[2:26:23] a final end time generation amen and we
[2:26:27] need to be like Elisha ready to burn
[2:26:30] whatever needs to be burned and left
[2:26:33] behind so that we can fulfill that
[2:26:37] call what if honoring God meant changing
[2:26:41] jobs making less
[2:26:44] money would you do it would you be
[2:26:46] willing to burn that ship because we're
[2:26:49] going to look at different ships in our
[2:26:51] lives tonight that need to be
[2:26:54] burned amen praise God let me say
[2:26:58] goodbye this wasn't Elijah showing
[2:27:00] weakness it was respect and
[2:27:03] responsibility he needed to let his
[2:27:05] family know what had just taken place
[2:27:08] and that he was embarking on his new
[2:27:11] calling Elijah says what have I to do
[2:27:14] with you in other words I'm not going to
[2:27:16] hinder you go do what you need to do
[2:27:19] take care care of what you need to take
[2:27:21] care of but come back and get ready to
[2:27:24] go into the service of the Lord God has
[2:27:27] great things in store for us in
[2:27:31] 2025 we need to burn the ships that need
[2:27:34] to be burnt we need to leave behind the
[2:27:36] things that need to be left behind and
[2:27:38] we need to move forward so that God can
[2:27:41] do what he has to do in each and every
[2:27:43] one of our Lives amen we need to see
[2:27:46] that he used the meat to feed his family
[2:27:49] it was a goodbye
[2:27:52] Feast we're not given the details but we
[2:27:56] know that there was probably a great
[2:27:58] feast that had taken place there was
[2:28:01] maybe a lot of Tears too that had taken
[2:28:04] place because he had to leave his family
[2:28:07] behind he had to leave certain aspects
[2:28:09] of his life behind because God had
[2:28:11] called him to the greatest calling that
[2:28:14] could ever come upon his life and the
[2:28:17] greatest calling that can ever come upon
[2:28:19] your life
[2:28:21] life being called to the message of this
[2:28:24] hour and to stand as a representation of
[2:28:27] God's word in this day is a very high
[2:28:32] calling amen glory to
[2:28:35] God this is a calling to surrender to
[2:28:37] the
[2:28:38] lordship of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[2:28:42] making him absolutely the Lord and
[2:28:46] absolute in your lives like we heard
[2:28:48] tonight amen what shall I Surrender unto
[2:28:52] Jehovah you heard the song what is it
[2:28:54] that we need to surrender tonight what
[2:28:56] shall we surrender tonight what shall we
[2:29:00] burn out of our lives and be willing to
[2:29:02] let go of and leave behind
[2:29:05] completely amen burn the ships if you
[2:29:09] want to get rid of weeds you don't just
[2:29:11] pluck them up you need to kill them at
[2:29:13] the root amen I've got a you know I've
[2:29:17] got this garden tool that I've never
[2:29:19] used it's still at home but I got it
[2:29:21] over the years and it and and what it is
[2:29:24] it's like a wand that connects to a
[2:29:26] portable propane
[2:29:28] tank and then you start it and the fire
[2:29:32] comes out at the bottom and you can go
[2:29:34] and you can actually burn the weeds in
[2:29:37] your
[2:29:40] grass well God wants you to burn the
[2:29:44] ships he wants you to go to the root of
[2:29:47] the things that are holding you back yes
[2:29:50] and he wants you to burn and kill and
[2:29:53] destroy the root cause of whatever it is
[2:29:58] whatever ship that's bringing you back
[2:30:00] to those to those sinful unbelieving
[2:30:04] situations in your life God wants you to
[2:30:07] burn those ships amen not just burn them
[2:30:10] kill them it has to be completely
[2:30:12] annihilated hallelujah praise
[2:30:15] God if you want to get rid of roaches or
[2:30:18] bed bugs you don't kill most of them you
[2:30:21] got to eliminate all of them amen and so
[2:30:25] we don't leave things you know sometimes
[2:30:28] you get into a a
[2:30:31] relationship with the wrong
[2:30:33] friends and then the social media
[2:30:36] contacts and the phone numbers and and
[2:30:38] and and then all of a sudden you come to
[2:30:40] realize and you may realize here tonight
[2:30:42] young people that there's certain
[2:30:44] influences in your life that you're
[2:30:46] going to need to uh burn that ship
[2:30:50] and when you burn it you don't leave any
[2:30:52] openings you have to eliminate all
[2:30:56] contact you got to cut it completely
[2:30:59] away so that there's no back door so
[2:31:02] that you can go back well I'll just I'll
[2:31:04] hold on to their number and then you
[2:31:06] know no all you're doing is you're
[2:31:08] you're holding on to that number and
[2:31:10] allowing the back door to stay open
[2:31:13] because then they can come in with a
[2:31:14] message that can lure you
[2:31:17] back you need to burn every ship and you
[2:31:21] don't want to just sink the
[2:31:24] ship and leave it intact so that you can
[2:31:27] go some sometime and maybe bring it back
[2:31:30] up no you've got to burn it completely
[2:31:32] so that it's absolutely no good it can
[2:31:36] never be used again never to go back
[2:31:41] again amen praise God let's go to our
[2:31:44] next
[2:31:46] slide in Colossians 3: 5 to 10 it says
[2:31:50] mortify Therefore your members which are
[2:31:53] upon the Earth fornication
[2:31:57] uncleanness inordinate affection evil
[2:32:00] compus science and covetousness which is
[2:32:04] idolatry for which things sake the wrath
[2:32:07] of God cometh on the children of
[2:32:09] disobedience in the which you also
[2:32:11] walked sometime when ye lived in them
[2:32:14] but now ye have put off all these and
[2:32:19] look at the things that the scripture
[2:32:22] talks about here we may not realize that
[2:32:24] you know we need to burn a ship of
[2:32:28] anger sometimes anger takes a hold of
[2:32:31] us and it's and and and and that it gets
[2:32:34] out of you know out of
[2:32:37] control we need to be able to control
[2:32:41] anger by the word of God Amen be angry
[2:32:45] but sin not the scripture says so now he
[2:32:49] says put off these things anger wrath
[2:32:52] malice blasphemy filthy communication

[2:33:00] language like it's just common these
[2:33:03] days but not the Sons and Daughters of

[2:33:17] holy he's he's he's
[2:33:21] respectful he's a
[2:33:25] gentleman and and when we act that way
[2:33:28] how can you expect the Holy Spirit to
[2:33:32] be in
[2:33:35] you or even around

[2:42:45] starts to uh give you instruction on on
[2:42:49] how to get set free from this you start
[2:42:53] to be led by the spirit am that shows

[2:43:32] before are you ready to do
[2:43:35] that are you ready to make that
[2:43:37] transition into
[2:43:39] 2024 where you're willing to leave

[2:48:38] ship let go of that past experience let
[2:48:42] go don't try to figure everything out
[2:48:44] don't try to understand
[2:48:47] everything God wants you to just simply
[2:48:50] believe his
[2:48:51] word and move forward with him amen
[2:48:56] listen we're not burning sin out of our
[2:48:58] Lives Jesus took our sins already so
[2:49:01] don't be looking to try to to to to to
[2:49:03] burn the sin we're burning the ships
[2:49:06] that lead us to that
[2:49:07] sin that's what we need to do we need to
[2:49:10] burn the wrong
[2:49:12] attitudes our attitudes are ships that
[2:49:15] need to be burned if they're a negative
[2:49:18] attitude yes if you're having problems
[2:49:21] in in communication with with um you
[2:49:24] know relationship issues you need to
[2:49:27] examine your
[2:49:29] ego is it your ego that's speaking every
[2:49:32] time you get into a
[2:49:35] confrontation or is it a sincere desire
[2:49:38] to see both of you set
[2:49:43] free a good deal is when it benefits
[2:49:47] both sides
[2:49:50] I've never seen a deal that's that that
[2:49:53] that's a great deal when it only
[2:49:54] benefits one
[2:49:56] side it needs to benefit
[2:49:59] both and so sometimes it's our attitude
[2:50:04] it's our it's our inability to not
[2:50:06] forgive you got a spirit of
[2:50:08] unforgiveness on
[2:50:10] you if so that bridge and that boat
[2:50:16] needs to be that ship needs to be burned

[2:50:22] to forgive how you going expect God to
[2:50:25] forgive you you're holding on to
[2:50:28] unforgiveness it's a spirit you don't
[2:50:31] realize a spirit of unforgiveness is is
[2:50:35] hindering
[2:50:37] you from moving
[2:50:39] forward and it's and it's keeping you
[2:50:42] under a spirit of condemnation at the
[2:50:44] same time you don't realize that you
[2:50:47] need to burn that bridge if that's one
[2:50:50] of the bridges then write it down on the
[2:50:52] paper
