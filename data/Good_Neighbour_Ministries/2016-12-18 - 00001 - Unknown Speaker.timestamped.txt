[3:34] her laying like this a cross was there
[3:38] and then of course the Eagle's feather
[3:41] um in her hand uh which is all belief
[3:46] and their belief that the person is
[3:47] taking their
[3:48] flight right so that's the feather that
[3:52] she had in her hand hold like that and
[3:55] you know I thought to myself I said wow
[3:58] would that be something else
[4:00] if um something like that you know I I
[4:03] visualize maybe an eag or something
[4:06] passing by sure enough the
[4:09] granddaugh T on my T on my pants the
[4:12] smallest
[4:13] one and said oh did you see that uh an
[4:19] eagil passed right over while the
[4:23] service the internment in the graveyard
[4:25] was going on and around the same time it
[4:28] was a cloudy day what the sun broke
[4:32] through and um she said that but an
[4:35] adult came later and asked me the same
[4:38] question if I noticed the evil passing
[4:41] over and as soon as the service was eny
[4:44] was gone so uh one of God's Eagles took
[4:48] their
[4:49] flight and we are happy for her and uh
[4:53] we're happy for the family too they took
[4:55] it in the right way of course they WEP
[4:57] they GED and everything else but they're
[4:59] believer and they believe that she's in
[5:01] the presence of the Lord and most of all
[5:04] free from her suffering yes free from
[5:07] her pain she's gone to be with the Lord
[5:10] and in the presence of the Lord her
[5:12] influence was great and people came from
[5:16] everywhere uh and uh you know different
[5:19] people from everywhere and the the
[5:21] funeral Hall was spilled and spilled
[5:24] over into the foe uh there were people
[5:27] all around so we were happy to be a part
[5:30] of that and after the service um of
[5:34] course the internment after that they
[5:36] had a reception at the funeral Hall the
[5:40] the fireman's Hall that was there which
[5:43] is a beautiful place that they built in
[5:46] a reserve they're
[5:47] huge and uh uh they had so much of food
[5:52] and drinks some of you we sorry that
[5:54] they didn't come but there was a lot of
[5:57] food lot of drinks lot of tast
[6:00] M watering delicious chicken and um
[6:04] everything else it was just beautiful
[6:06] matter of fact when it was over even for
[6:07] that crowd of people there was so much
[6:09] left over they were uh begging people to
[6:12] take as much as they can and take it
[6:15] with them uh of that nature but uh
[6:18] however praise God uh my wife and I
[6:21] stayed uh with them after the crowds
[6:24] were gone everybody was gone that we we
[6:26] got a chance to speak with brother arm
[6:29] little more with them personally and
[6:31] with the children one onone and talked
[6:35] with them um we stayed there literally
[6:38] until about 6:30 uh in the evening and
[6:42] they uh then they left and went to the
[6:45] home I wanted to be assured that he
[6:47] wasn't going to go to an empty house
[6:49] with the wife gone and uh no and so I
[6:54] know that not only the girls are going
[6:56] to stay with him not just for one night
[6:59] but they going to stay with him until
[7:01] they can see that he's kind of adjusting

[7:10] course I'll be calling them from time to
[7:12] time and we'll see how the Lord will

[8:58] hallelujah okay
[9:00] let's read this together I believe
[9:01] everybody knows this so some of you I
[9:04] know maybe know it by heart but I have
[9:06] still read the Bible the Lord is my
[9:12] shepherd I shall not want how
[9:17] wonderful feel like preaching on this
[9:19] tonight instead can you say that read
[9:23] scripture like that and just read it
[9:25] like you're reading a novel does it mean
[9:27] what it says and do we really believe
[9:30] what it say if the Lord is your Shepherd
[9:35] am I going to lead you into triying
[9:38] pastors where there is nothing no food
[9:40] or nothing is God going to lead you
[9:42] there that is why David said the Lord is
[9:47] my
[9:48] shepherd if he's not leading anybody
[9:50] else I he's leading me amen the Lord is
[9:54] my shepherd I shall not want be want
[9:59] amen
[9:59] I shall not be in want because the Lord
[10:04] is my shepherd he maketh me to lie down
[10:07] in Green
[10:09] Pastures he leadth me beside the Still
[10:13] Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me
[10:19] in the paths of righteousness for his
[10:22] name's sake y though I walk through the
[10:26] valley of the shadow of death I will
[10:30] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[10:34] rod and thy staff they comfort me thou
[10:40] preparest a table for me in the presence
[10:45] of my enemies now anointest my head with
[10:48] oil my cup run over surely goodness and
[10:54] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[10:58] life and I will dwell in the house of
[11:03] the Lord forever I will dwell in the
[11:07] house of the Lord forever that's my
[11:09] thought is right in those words I will
[11:12] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[11:15] father we thank you once again for the
[11:18] great privilege of your sending us your
[11:21] written word and sending us the prophet
[11:23] and the Holy Spirit to interpret the
[11:25] word we pray that you'll bless us in the
[11:28] Simplicity of the this moment like you
[11:30] bless us on Sunday and father may your
[11:33] great Holy Spirit take all the praise
[11:35] the honor and the glory in Jesus name
[11:37] amen the Lord bless you
[11:42] richly
[11:47] Hallelujah now uh just to get right to
[11:51] it we know that when Israel crossed into
[11:55] the Promised Land one of the first uh
[11:58] stories that that we uh we find there is
[12:01] the story of RAB the
[12:04] Harlot and spiritual people understand
[12:07] that the story of RAB the harl is your
[12:10] story and my story spiritually speaking
[12:15] we were uh uh harlots to the
[12:20] denominations we jump from one to the
[12:22] other because we were searching for the
[12:25] love of God understand that's a Lev
[12:27] meaning there but I hope you understand
[12:29] what I'm saying they really uh searching
[12:32] for love searching for the love of God
[12:35] and jumping from one denomination but is
[12:38] Mr Baptist Mr Methodist where you know
[12:40] we're jumping from one to the other uh
[12:43] like that but in the middle of that
[12:47] there was something buried inside of
[12:49] rahab's
[12:51] heart and Reon said
[12:54] notice that she was a gentile woman
[12:59] but she asked for Mercy praise God even
[13:04] before the invasion of Israel she had a
[13:08] revelation that they were
[13:10] coming she had a revelation that there
[13:13] was going to be a change amen the age
[13:16] was going to change something was going
[13:18] to take place and she uh decided uh she
[13:23] knew that the denominations could not
[13:26] the Nations couldn't beat Israel God
[13:29] from their uh former uh uh their former
[13:34] uh what should I say what's the word I
[13:36] want here record every nation that came
[13:39] against them when they were coming out
[13:42] of Egypt even the mighty Egyptian Empire
[13:46] was defeated by Israel and the god of
[13:50] Israel so she knew these lesser uh
[13:55] demonic Nations uh could not defeat
[14:00] Israel and therefore when she got in
[14:03] contact with the spies she asked for
[14:06] Mercy amen not for herself only but for
[14:10] her household amen if they were willing
[14:14] to come into her house and the signal
[14:19] that would she would leave a Scarlet
[14:22] colored cord hanging in the window it
[14:25] wasn't a cord it was actually a rope
[14:27] right uh it was actually a fat red rope
[14:31] that they could see clearly and so she
[14:33] was asked to leave that but you know
[14:36] many times we sing and we read the
[14:38] scriptures and and we use the term about
[14:41] uh bringing all your loved ones in and
[14:44] in the message it was preached in such a
[14:46] way as if you can just whale pray every
[14:50] one of them in but brother gr and before
[14:54] used to say every baby that was born is
[14:57] going to heaven the said no if it's
[15:01] elected it goes to heaven right praise
[15:05] the Lord hallelujah it's the same way
[15:08] with our relatives if they are
[15:10] elected they go to heaven amen so it's
[15:13] the same way RAB had the right to tell
[15:17] them what was going to happen just like
[15:19] how we're telling them right now what's
[15:21] going to happen we have the right to
[15:23] tell them what's going to happen what
[15:25] dangers lie ahead tell them about coming
[15:28] events how was made clear by indicated
[15:31] prophecy yes and they have absolute
[15:35] right to come into her house or come
[15:38] under the protection of the
[15:40] blood but if they refus they would
[15:43] perish like anybody else it's the same
[15:47] thing today you be by becoming a True
[15:51] Believer of the word of God has a right
[15:54] to share what you have with all your
[15:57] relatives and friends and and give them
[16:00] a heads up a warning right to come under
[16:04] the protection of the
[16:07] blood and if they do not he the warning
[16:12] warning then son of man the blood is off
[16:15] of your hands amen but if you don't warn
[16:18] them the blood will be on your hands
[16:20] amen we must warn them of the things
[16:23] that are going to be so that they have
[16:26] the opportunity of being able to to take
[16:29] themselves out of
[16:36] peritter
[16:38] Amen
[16:39] anyway the fact is the sign was to place
[16:44] a rope a red Scarlet colored rope in the
[16:48] window which is symbolic of the token
[16:52] which is a symbol of the blood of Christ
[16:56] and if I might that's individ
[16:59] but prophetically and scripturally it
[17:02] speaks of the blood of Christ
[17:04] redemption's plan running from Genesis
[17:07] right through to Revelation from Genesis
[17:10] where he says the seeding woman will
[17:11] bruise the Serpent's head that red cord
[17:14] of redemption runs right through the
[17:16] entire Bible right to the Book of
[17:18] Revelation it ties that also okay but it
[17:22] tipes now the holy spirit for God is a
[17:26] spirit and he can't shed natural blood
[17:28] that's he had to take a body down from
[17:30] his glory and die so that he can shed
[17:33] blood that you and I could see but
[17:36] really it wasn't the chemicals of the
[17:39] blood when we see the There Is Power in
[17:41] the Blood but it was the life that was
[17:44] in the
[17:46] blood and the life that was in the blood
[17:50] was the Holy Spirit so God shed Spirit
[17:54] blood if you want to put it that way God
[17:56] shed Spirit blood amen and so uh this
[18:00] cord typ the token of the Holy Spirit
[18:05] and we want to thank God that we have
[18:07] the talken today in the form of the Holy
[18:10] Spirit it took a prophet to make that
[18:13] clear to us even when I was in all
[18:18] Pentecostal denomination we sing There
[18:20] Is Power in the Blood Power in the Blood
[18:22] power the blood we s about the blood of
[18:25] Jesus and we were visualizing the red
[18:28] blood dropping from his head and down
[18:30] his face which we still can but now we
[18:32] have the understanding that it wasn't
[18:34] the red chemistry brother BR put it this
[18:37] way he says not to be uh sounding
[18:39] Blasphemous and sacriligious but that
[18:42] blood dried up 1900 years ago but the
[18:46] life that was in the blood lives
[18:49] today and that life is the holy spirit
[18:52] if the same spirit that raised Christ
[18:54] from the dead dwell in you he shall also
[18:57] Quicken your of God even if the devil
[19:01] puts you in a grave he'll bring you out
[19:04] amen the Bible said even if you were in
[19:06] the sea even if you are eaten by lions
[19:09] he'll call and you'll answer amen amen
[19:13] praise God hallelujah so here it is that
[19:17] uh she uh had that token and she had to
[19:21] put it outside of her window you know
[19:24] what type that is telling you it's all
[19:26] right to say you have the Holy Spirit
[19:29] but it is not effective until you put it
[19:32] on public
[19:34] dis you must put it on public display
[19:38] suppose she said oh if I put the the
[19:41] cord in the window all the rest of the
[19:44] of the inhabitants of this city that
[19:46] knows that that that these Israelites
[19:48] are coming are going to think I'm a spy
[19:51] and and they going to grab a hold of me
[19:53] they're going to call me names they're
[19:54] going to throw me in jail at that point
[19:56] she had a revelation and she didn't care
[20:00] what they said and what happened to her
[20:02] life anymore she knew she was saved by
[20:05] the
[20:06] blood amen and we are saved by the blood
[20:10] but we must put it on public
[20:13] display you can't keep it in the house
[20:15] who knows about it if you got it covered
[20:17] in the blood covered up in your house
[20:19] the doors all locked your mouth locked
[20:22] everything locked up you have locked jaw
[20:24] you can't speak about it you can't talk
[20:26] about it you can't display it in your
[20:28] walk in your talk in your life all you
[20:31] got to do is say oh I'm a Christian I'm
[20:33] a citizen here I'm a Christian no it's
[20:36] got to be on public display so that they
[20:38] will know I am never going to be ashamed
[20:41] of him praise the Lord every Christian
[20:45] to take up their cross and follow Jesus
[20:49] UNAM and bear the reproach for the word
[20:56] of this hour amen oh there's a lot of
[20:59] reproach with it before it was a
[21:00] wonderful thing saying you're in the
[21:02] message oh praise the Lord you know a
[21:05] prophet has come he's got healing he's
[21:07] got miracles he's got gifts but now
[21:09] there's people that were once with the
[21:11] spirit of Judas right in the message
[21:13] head with him slept with him and then
[21:15] walked away from him and then used
[21:18] whatever he Tau them to turn it back
[21:20] against him until now uh the prophet's
[21:24] name start to become a b word and a
[21:26] proverb and just like the name name
[21:29] Christian was not something digifi it
[21:31] was like a curse word back there it was
[21:34] call you a criminal wasn't something to
[21:36] be proud up oh he's a Christian you
[21:39] Christian you see it was used in a
[21:43] disparaging way but now the devil come
[21:46] into this denominations and made it so
[21:48] dignified and high and mighty until
[21:51] every fil star want to say they're
[21:53] Christian even though the mascara
[21:55] streaks down their face while they're
[21:57] crying on their they have to be careful
[21:59] they don't stick themselves in the
[22:01] eye this still Christian every Governor
[22:05] every mayor they feel it's a part of
[22:08] your resume that you have to have there
[22:11] to give you
[22:12] credibility is that right oh my God
[22:17] Corin you know two
[22:19] Corinthians will certainly give you
[22:21] credibility in other words you have to
[22:23] show that you know the Bible or
[22:25] something about the Bible right that's
[22:28] what it was but praise the Lord God
[22:31] wants us brothers and sisters to stay
[22:34] under the blood amen she had to dwell in
[22:39] her
[22:40] house and we have to say I will dwell in
[22:43] the house of the Lord
[22:46] forever amen you're under his protection
[22:50] you're under his blood you're under his
[22:54] provision you're in his house and you're
[22:57] under his provision you're under his
[23:00] protection you're under his preservation
[23:03] you're precious to him and you're under
[23:06] the blood oh I want to stay under that
[23:09] blood I want to stay under the blood of
[23:13] the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen you
[23:19] see when reab after she was spared she
[23:23] got all of her people in everything that
[23:27] was under the core
[23:29] was
[23:30] saved in Egypt everything that wanted to
[23:34] be under that blood Strike the Blood
[23:38] over the door and anybody in that house
[23:42] where the blood is on the door everyone
[23:44] in that house will be saved you know the
[23:46] Egyptians even had an opportunity if
[23:48] they rushed in there and I think there
[23:50] were a few of them the Bible said that
[23:52] believe uh what Moses preached and ran
[23:55] some of the Jewish arms they were no
[23:57] minority but they were saved under that
[24:00] blood that sign of the blood amen praise
[24:04] God and Hallelujah he said they were
[24:07] saved under the
[24:09] blood in Egypt all was under the scarlet
[24:13] cord were saved and now all under the
[24:18] blood of Jesus Christ is saved am
[24:21] Hallelujah yes sir that's the way it is
[24:24] glory to God and you know the rest of
[24:27] our story how she uh she fell on the the
[24:31] eyes I think it's was Solomon uh Solomon
[24:34] uh here in the book brother R said
[24:37] Solomon but it wasn't Solomon you know
[24:40] and that's why they pick up all these
[24:41] stupid little things and oh he he made a
[24:43] mistake there Solomon wasn't even there
[24:47] whatever it's salon right and so Salon
[24:52] Prince of Israel got married to her H
[24:56] and and here that she was uh saved
[25:01] praise the Lord amen so brothers and
[25:04] here you can see already Jesus as
[25:06] Gentile
[25:07] connection you understand here also he's
[25:10] setting up the symbol the type and the
[25:13] shadow that he the prince is going to
[25:17] marry a gentile
[25:19] bride right with a questionable
[25:22] background of sin but he is going to
[25:26] redeem or save her or deliver her by
[25:31] marrying her is that right how are we
[25:34] Sav by the invisible Union of the
[25:36] brighten Christ by the word with your
[25:39] soul that is how you're saved by the
[25:41] word with your soul salvation is by
[25:45] Revelation amen the denominations have
[25:49] it salvation is just
[25:51] confession amen but we know that people
[25:54] today use that as a as a c oh I'm sorry
[25:58] they kick you one time I'm sorry and
[26:01] said but you're supposed to forgive me
[26:03] and they kick you again you're supposed
[26:04] to forgive me and they use that as a c
[26:07] that's what the devil is doing today oh
[26:09] the man apologized so you should forget
[26:11] that oh yeah but it's not coming from
[26:14] the heart is that right salvation is by
[26:18] Revelation amen how you going to even
[26:21] confess if it wasn't reveal to you that
[26:22] you sin are going to be are you going to
[26:25] even confess and hope to be saved if you
[26:28] no revelation of your Savor how you want
[26:31] to how you going to be saying you have
[26:32] no revelation of the blood you don't
[26:34] even know what you repenting for see so
[26:39] salvation is by Revelation amen amen
[26:44] remember that just simple statement
[26:45] salvation is by Revelation something had
[26:49] to be revealed to you before you could
[26:52] truly be born
[26:55] again and now after uh
[26:58] Rahab we read the story of Naomi and
[27:03] Ruth and here again we see another he's
[27:07] setting up another type and another
[27:09] symbol of course uh this another type
[27:13] this other symbol is Ruth a gentile
[27:18] woman who was formerly thought to be a
[27:21] moabite
[27:22] priestess and again the moabite
[27:25] Priestess which was uh similar
[27:28] I'm not saying every Catholic none is
[27:30] like that but the Babylonian system was
[27:32] that priestesses were there to serve the
[27:34] needs of those priests and certain times
[27:36] of the year they they had festivals
[27:39] Under The Groves that's why God start
[27:41] was against these Groves and and these
[27:44] Mountain uh uh altars that they used to
[27:47] have it was pure harlotry and homs on
[27:52] certain nights of the year when the moon
[27:55] was in certain uh positions and so for
[27:58] her to be come out from the background
[28:01] of being a m Priestess I'm let you know
[28:03] it plain clear so you understand what
[28:05] actually God did CU you just read the
[28:09] Bible Ruth left with you know the
[28:12] background of actually what it all is
[28:14] about so she comes from that kind of a
[28:18] background but she saw something in the
[28:21] light of
[28:23] Naomi and when Naomi left she said oh
[28:27] your God is not going to be my God what
[28:31] she c a revelation she caught a
[28:34] revelation enough to sell out or kick
[28:37] out our all Babylonian religion like we
[28:41] did amen and be able to follow her
[28:46] mother-in-law change the age from
[28:50] Pentecost right to the message of the
[28:53] hour what's the message of the hour Mo I
[28:56] love you I want
[28:58] Maria praise God I'm taking your home
[29:01] with me that was the message that she
[29:03] got and the same message we got praise
[29:07] God
[29:09] hallelujah amen and so we see here that
[29:14] Ruth this great
[29:16] moabit just like Rahab the Harlot was
[29:20] saved by the blood amen saved by
[29:24] marriage to boas what a background that
[29:29] they came from but to think about
[29:33] it that Solomon was the one that founded
[29:37] uh
[29:39] Bethlehem founded
[29:41] Bethlehem and he founded Bethlehem all
[29:45] with along with
[29:47] Rahab amen praise the Lord amen and now
[29:52] we see it come to the place where uh we
[29:55] get back to the text that we were
[29:57] touching on before how why he live with
[30:00] Bethlehem why was he born in Bethlehem
[30:04] in the Book of Psalms of Prophecy
[30:06] already said behold Bethlehem among the
[30:10] uh tribes of Judah uh this man was born
[30:14] there that's before Jesus was born uh
[30:17] those words were spoken and and the
[30:20] priest didn't recognize that uh none of
[30:23] them recognize that but brother BR said
[30:27] a crack named
[30:29] Simeon a blind woman named Anna is that
[30:33] right a carent a
[30:36] nobody and all priest that was ready to
[30:41] retire my God a bun of them no man
[30:45] people recognized that the Christ was
[30:48] upon the Earth Messiah was on earth now
[30:51] amen they recognize it and the priest
[30:54] didn't know anything about it oh my when
[30:57] the wise man came he came knowing and
[31:00] the priest didn't
[31:01] know where is he born King of the je
[31:04] they knew he was born King of the Jews
[31:07] but we come to worship him oh we don't
[31:11] know of any King the Jews accept the
[31:14] denomination I mean that's ruling over
[31:16] us all these years that's all we know
[31:18] about the that's the only King that we
[31:20] know that's ready to kill anybody that
[31:22] come against him or differ with him in
[31:24] his doctrine of of his kingship uh and
[31:27] rulership uh that's all we know about
[31:30] but the king said you know go and
[31:33] investigate this and the Bible says
[31:35] after the priest went which means they
[31:38] didn't
[31:39] know they came back and say yeah we
[31:42] found where it is written in the
[31:44] prophets and they quoted him about
[31:48] Bethlehem thou Judea art not thou the
[31:51] least amount the princes but out of the
[31:54] shall come a governor that shall rule My
[31:58] People Israel amen praise be to God they
[32:02] found it but look a whole bunch of no
[32:06] man people founded before them what a
[32:09] what to think about it they were blinded
[32:13] by the holy spirit amen yes sir praise
[32:16] God and God has a way doing things he
[32:19] keeps his spatter amen if God with
[32:22] simple Ordinary People he will continue
[32:25] to do just that amen
[32:28] now when job died he told them where to
[32:31] bury
[32:33] him when Abraham
[32:36] died he B SP of land and told him to
[32:39] bury him there now by the way uh brother
[32:43] BR isn't saying this here but in other
[32:45] places he said none of them like
[32:48] physically knew that that was actually
[32:51] the spot where Adam
[32:54] died and then uh they they come and joob
[32:59] wanted to be buried there by inspiration
[33:01] he wants to be buried the same place not
[33:03] knowing that Adam died on that Hill they
[33:05] want to be buried there and Abraham
[33:08] comes behind and and and he goes and
[33:11] buys that spot land and say oh bury me
[33:15] and Sarah you got Buri us right there
[33:18] and they got buried there and Jacob went
[33:22] up into Egypt you know with his sons to
[33:25] meet Joseph up there and when he was
[33:28] dying he made Joseph put his hand behind
[33:31] his thigh and swear to him that you are
[33:33] not going to leave my body here in Egypt
[33:35] but take me up and bury me beside
[33:37] Abraham and he took him back and buried
[33:40] him where Abraham was a man Joseph died
[33:44] if you read I believe around the end of
[33:46] the book of Exodus or J where he says
[33:49] take every one of my bones up with you
[33:53] don't leave one bone back here bury it
[33:56] back there right there praise the Lord
[33:59] outside of Egypt praise the Lord listen
[34:02] to The Prophet what was it they
[34:05] recognized and knew the first fruits of
[34:09] the Resurrection was coming from that
[34:13] land because that's where job said I
[34:17] know my redeemer Li and at the last days
[34:20] he will stand upon the Earth and those
[34:23] skin worms destroy in this body yet in
[34:26] my flesh I God imagine at the first of
[34:30] the Bible job already have a revelation
[34:32] of the body
[34:33] change is that right that I'm going to
[34:36] die but at the same time yet in my flesh
[34:40] I'm not going to be coming have some
[34:41] Spirit In My Flesh I'm going to see God
[34:44] praise the Lord he had a revelation from
[34:47] Genesis right on down to Revelation so
[34:51] is it today friends many people hold on
[34:53] to things of the world or hold on to
[34:57] same great system but all bury me in
[35:01] Christ amen for if those that are in
[35:04] Christ only those that are in Christ
[35:06] will God bring with him in the
[35:10] resurrection praise be to God hallelujah
[35:13] amen yes sir very important oh praise
[35:17] God now we know that the bride will be
[35:20] made up uh the bride will be made up
[35:23] many of
[35:24] Gentiles because it's a gentile bride am
[35:28] and you know in the book of Acts he said
[35:29] that he will call out people from among
[35:33] the Gentiles for his name not all the
[35:35] Gentiles but from among the Gentiles is
[35:38] that right he said I'll take one I'll
[35:41] leave one I'll take one I'll leave one
[35:42] do a bed I'll take one I leave one do
[35:45] feel I take one I leave one amen praise
[35:47] the Lord but he'll take out from among
[35:51] the Gentiles of people that he would Mar
[35:55] amen for his name give them this name so
[35:59] I'll take them out I'll choose them by
[36:01] the choosing of a bride praise the Lord
[36:04] you'll see the character in them and the
[36:07] character is not something we put on but
[36:09] the very seed that he himself placed on
[36:12] there will have the same character as
[36:14] himself for the word can only marry to
[36:17] the word if he is the word she has to be
[36:19] the word because God didn't take a
[36:21] separate part of dir to make Eve but she
[36:23] took a part of Adam and made Eve is that
[36:27] right now he's taking a part of Christ
[36:29] the word to make us hallelujah the new
[36:33] creation amen amen praise the Lord so we
[36:37] are a part of him now being revealed he
[36:40] was revealed back there but you being
[36:42] revealed now veiling of the Mighty God
[36:46] Hallelujah the Mighty God being unveiled
[36:50] not just before us in the form of
[36:52] brother BR but the mighty mighty God
[36:56] Demon veil in US
[36:58] and true us you are the veil that veils
[37:01] him you are the skin Veil that veils him
[37:04] not the badger skin and skin and all
[37:07] these other skins but you are the veil
[37:09] that fails him today praise the Lord so
[37:12] we bail him we reveal him is that right
[37:15] he be hide him and yet we reveal him
[37:17] praise God you are a part of that
[37:22] mystery amen praise the Lord that's now
[37:25] ongoing praise God hallelujah amen so
[37:28] there it is brothers and sisters we see
[37:31] it here bury me in Christ amen now David
[37:38] was born in Bethlehem I forgot to carry
[37:40] on that thought we know that also of
[37:43] course that when they took Jesus and
[37:47] they went and crucified him they
[37:50] crucified him on the same Hill also
[37:52] where Abraham was going to kill Isaac
[37:55] and so on the whole thing just kept
[37:57] going right on down and they were doing
[37:59] it by inspiration because remember they
[38:01] didn't have Telegraph and internet to
[38:03] know what this other one did so many 100
[38:06] years ago or whatever inspiration amen
[38:10] praise the Lord you know they kind of
[38:12] felt I don't know if they had all of
[38:14] them had a clar revelation but they felt
[38:17] that this ground here when the Messiah
[38:19] comes again Resurrection is going to
[38:21] start at this place and I want to be
[38:23] sure I'm going to be there amen praise
[38:25] the name of the Lord that resur
[38:27] starts glory to God of course that's a
[38:31] type of being buried in the world
[38:33] because the resurrection will be take
[38:35] place with the word Prophet said if
[38:38] there is no seed word in that heart
[38:42] there uh there is nothing to be
[38:45] reborn there's nothing to be reborn
[38:48] there has to be a seed in there to be
[38:50] reborn praise the Lord for a person to
[38:52] be saying I'm born again again amen
[38:57] there would have to have had a seed in
[38:59] there before to be born again glory to
[39:03] God hallelujah and then how are they
[39:05] going to deceive you and tell you
[39:06] they're born again but they're not
[39:07] seeing the word of the Y they're not
[39:10] recognizing the word when it's the word
[39:13] that sees the word and the Deep calls to
[39:16] the deep and the Deep will responden
[39:19] because the two are like the jigsaw
[39:21] apostle that the prophet spoke about
[39:23] they are made like hand and glove to
[39:26] feat each other right and when a True
[39:29] Believer hears the truth that thing fits
[39:32] your soul until sometimes youing know I
[39:35] I used to think that or I used to
[39:37] believe that I never heard it like that
[39:39] before but I already I had this feeling
[39:42] in me that that's right amen praise God
[39:45] why because you are a part of the word
[39:48] but it's now being revealed amen praise
[39:52] God this is your time this is your
[39:54] season and God is making himself to know
[39:58] know amen of course David was born in
[40:03] Bethlehem amen and he was the one that
[40:07] anointed was anointed also when Samuel
[40:09] came to him he was anointed also in ble
[40:13] him amen and praise the Lord and now you
[40:18] see I just showed you where a lot of
[40:20] them died and how they all got buried in
[40:22] the same place now I'm taking you the
[40:24] other way David was born in Bethlehem
[40:26] David was anointed in Bethlehem and
[40:29] David his greater son the Lord Jesus
[40:31] Christ The Royal seed comes and where
[40:33] where else is he going to be born yes be
[40:36] bor in
[40:37] Bethlehem for the word comes to the
[40:40] predestinated vessel Hallelujah it has
[40:43] to come to that vessel or place that God
[40:47] already had prepared amen you were
[40:50] prepared don't you understand that
[40:52] you're living beem
[40:54] today amen you are the place that with
[40:57] all a stinking straw and manure where
[41:00] the king of glory came down to come and
[41:02] live in our hearts a God that's rich in
[41:05] Mercy that come and dwell in us we we
[41:08] weren't better than anybody that stable
[41:11] wasn't better better than any other
[41:12] stable it had animals and had mess and
[41:14] had straw it had swaddling bands of
[41:17] clothing which the swaddling clothes is
[41:19] a sweat they put a cloth around the the
[41:22] neck of the animal and rest a yoke on it
[41:25] so that it wouldn't Scar the neck of the
[41:27] animal because the cloth would soak up
[41:29] the the salt from the sweat uh
[41:32] perspiration on the animal and not give
[41:35] it what they call G which is to say that
[41:38] it start to get red and bloody and
[41:40] everything else so that that's what the
[41:43] Clock Was and when he was born that's
[41:46] all Mary could find they was so poor she
[41:48] didn't have nobody knitting booties and
[41:51] fixing up everything else she did just
[41:53] grabb a a cloth that was filled with the
[41:56] animal and just wrapped him in
[41:59] that hallelujah amen when God come down
[42:03] in his AG all he could find is US and he
[42:06] took us as sinful as we were and wrapped
[42:09] him in that amen amen praise the Lord
[42:14] you understand what he did for
[42:16] us understand what he did for us amen
[42:19] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[42:22] you would think that baby will catch
[42:24] disease or that sickness or whatever
[42:26] else like
[42:28] that I think it was the reverse he
[42:31] Sanctified that
[42:32] clot he made that clot if they could
[42:35] find that today they would have that up
[42:38] in the Catholic church as a holy shroud
[42:40] or something my God I tell you because
[42:43] he's the one that transforms everything
[42:46] around him amen praise the Lord glory to
[42:49] God when he touches the light he
[42:51] changes touch Elijah he was so anointed
[42:54] that years after he was buried he still
[42:56] had the holy ghost in his bone amen you
[42:59] tell me that when you have the Holy
[43:01] Ghost now and even if they bury you the
[43:03] Holy Ghost is going to be your B to th
[43:05] years later whenever the Rapture comes
[43:08] the Holy Ghost will be there and he'll
[43:09] raise you up the grace of God you can
[43:12] have this assurance amen amen oh what a
[43:17] blessed thought to know that we've lost
[43:20] our fear of death for death is The Last
[43:24] Enemy and when you overcome the fear of
[43:26] death
[43:27] you are an overcome you already overcome
[43:30] praise the Lord hallelujah I'm not
[43:33] saying that you going to rush to your
[43:34] death but uh you know we have no real
[43:37] fear of
[43:38] death that our lives are going to end
[43:41] it's your natural life is going to end
[43:44] not the real you the life that is in
[43:47] there and God can give you another body
[43:50] and he will a glorified body praise the
[43:52] Lord hallelujah how wonderful to know
[43:55] that we are born again free from sin
[43:58] happy night and day want to make me
[44:01] shout there is no doubt I know that I've
[44:04] been born again praise the name of the
[44:07] Lord hallelujah oh think of it poor
[44:11] people Joseph and Mary real poor but how
[44:15] humble God makes
[44:19] himself God humbles himself and take the
[44:22] things that are not that he might bring
[44:25] to pass his great promises
[44:28] amen think about it how Jehovah laying
[44:31] in a Manger wrapped in the cloth taken
[44:34] from the Yoke off the neck of an ox they
[44:37] wrapped the Prince of Peace in it who
[44:40] are we then what do we deserve if God
[44:44] can humble himself like that ought we
[44:47] not to be able to Humble ourselves to
[44:49] become his servants and to serve him
[44:53] amen would that be the truth
[44:57] simple but that's powerful if God can do
[45:00] that for us we can do that for him
[45:03] praise the Lord hallelujah no matter how
[45:06] poor you are how little or insignificant
[45:09] you might be God can use you only if you

[45:19] anybody to do anything noely but he will
[45:22] use you if you let him amen no matter
[45:26] what condition or state you are in there
[45:29] is something lacking
[45:31] somewhere amen we try to twist it this
[45:35] way we pollut it just like the Nations
[45:37] have done Christmas all polluted that's
[45:39] right but if we could just get back get
[45:42] the tinel of off all these things and
[45:46] get the humility back in the human heart
[45:49] Bring humility back to Christmas that's
[45:52] the way it ought to be not commercial
[45:55] not light not most Santa Clauses but
[45:59] back to worshiping the God of all
[46:02] creation Jehovah God Amen praise the
[46:05] Lord get all the shiny things out of the
[46:09] churches get all this fancy stuff
[46:11] they're trying to put on all kinds of
[46:13] attractions on religion is that right
[46:16] that's what they're doing you know the
[46:18] attraction towards religion is not all
[46:21] these shows and programs and all these
[46:23] things that they're doing let me tell
[46:25] you in the book of ask what was the
[46:27] attraction that they needed the holy GH
[46:29] just came down and that was the
[46:31] attraction is that right one man that
[46:34] was going to that inational church for
[46:36] 40 years H Peter and John said take up
[46:39] your bed and walk and the man left them
[46:42] walk on the crow start to together 3,000
[46:44] were saved in the one day that's
[46:46] thect is that right they didn't need a
[46:49] big advertisement bu they didn't need
[46:52] public relations you know that the
[46:53] churches have uh uh administrator they
[46:57] got people trained in marketing and
[47:00] religious public uh publicity and all
[47:03] this stuff they have people train
[47:06] religiously to do all these things amen
[47:08] what we need is not those things even
[47:11] though they are helpful we need the Holy
[47:13] Ghost back in the church
[47:15] again we need the churches to Humble
[47:18] themselves under the the mighty hand of
[47:21] God we need to see the word born in the
[47:24] church again the word manifesting itself
[47:28] in the church again the prophet of God
[47:30] puts it this far he said if a church
[47:32] does not
