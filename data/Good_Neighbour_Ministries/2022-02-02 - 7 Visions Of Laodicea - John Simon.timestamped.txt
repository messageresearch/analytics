[0:44] of these seven church ages
[0:47] and in particular
[0:49] we are speaking on

[1:03] uh that our dear prophet and brother

[1:10] in 1933
[1:13] by the grace of god

[2:40] of the creation of god
[2:43] hallelujah praise god
[2:46] well
[2:47] speaking on the laodicean church age
[2:53] first of all
[2:55] we ended our last talk
[2:58] about
[3:00] leodisia
[3:02] showing how that the
[3:05] spirit or characteristics
[3:08] of
[3:09] the city
[3:12] of laodicea
[3:15] has transferred itself
[3:20] into the age in which we are living in
[3:24] and our age
[3:26] in our time
[3:28] is now displaying
[3:31] those
[3:33] characteristics that were in that city
[3:37] in a magnified form
[3:40] now
[3:42] in
[3:43] 1932
[3:48] brother william branham
[3:51] the 20th century prophet
[3:55] that was sent here to the earth
[3:59] under an anointing of the spirit of
[4:02] elijah
[4:04] prophesied by
[4:06] the prophet malachi
[4:09] chapter 4
[4:10] verse 5
[4:13] and how he would come
[4:16] and turn the hearts of the children
[4:19] back to the fathers
[4:22] in the book of revelation chapter 10
[4:25] verse 7
[4:27] he is also
[4:30] described
[4:32] or identified
[4:34] as the seventh angel
[4:37] or the seventh
[4:39] messenger
[4:41] to the seventh church age
[4:45] it is in this time
[4:47] that the great mighty angel of god
[4:51] came down from heaven
[4:54] and
[4:54] spoke shouted with a loud voice roared
[4:58] with a loud voice
[5:00] and said time shall be no more
[5:05] which
[5:06] that time
[5:08] was not telling us
[5:11] of
[5:12] time in terms of all time
[5:16] time for the planet or time for
[5:18] everywhere else
[5:20] no
[5:21] that mighty angel
[5:23] was referring to the time
[5:26] for the church ages
[5:28] are now over
[5:31] the church ages
[5:33] are at an end
[5:35] and here he came to give the final
[5:40] message
[5:41] to
[5:42] this seventh church age messenger
[5:48] this seventh church age messenger
[5:52] a prophet
[5:54] by call by ordination of the spirit of
[5:58] god
[5:59] by nature
[6:00] hallelujah
[6:02] was sent here
[6:04] to bring to us
[6:08] the last words of god
[6:11] blessing warning
[6:13] teaching guidance prophecy all of it to
[6:17] the gentile dispensation
[6:21] at the setting of its son
[6:24] for when this gentile dispensation is
[6:26] over
[6:28] then the entire economy of god goes back
[6:32] to the jews oh blessed be his holy and
[6:36] righteous name
[6:40] and now
[6:42] this
[6:43] prophet
[6:45] genuine bible prophet
[6:48] and especially
[6:52] i emphasize that because we live in a
[6:55] day
[6:56] where it has become fashionable
[7:00] for once to call themselves prophets
[7:06] now we know in the bible
[7:10] the bible tells us that if a prophet
[7:12] says he comes in the name of the lord
[7:16] and he prophesies anything
[7:19] and it does not come to pass
[7:23] then he needs to
[7:25] uh you know he needs to
[7:29] be exposed that a lying spirit
[7:33] came upon him
[7:34] and he is not a prophet of god
[7:38] he is not
[7:39] a true prophet
[7:41] of god
[7:42] of course baal had his prophets
[7:47] maman has his prophets
[7:49] uh shimosh has his prophets
[7:53] all the various gods of these false
[7:57] nations in the bible
[7:59] claim that they had prophets
[8:02] but that from ever of old
[8:06] has always been satan's strategy
[8:10] when god presents
[8:12] a prophet
[8:14] then he trolls uh uh raises up a whole
[8:17] bunch of music magicians or copycats as
[8:21] in pharaoh's court
[8:23] at the time of moses who will also cast
[8:27] down their rods and prophesy
[8:30] oh but we know there is only
[8:34] one true prophet from god to a
[8:38] generation
[8:41] and he is the one
[8:44] that we are to look and listen to
[8:48] for a true him
[8:50] comes the voice of god
[8:52] in these last days
[8:56] now this
[8:58] prophet
[9:00] this
[9:01] our dear
[9:03] loving brother william
[9:05] marion branham
[9:08] who was a vessel
[9:10] through whom the voice of god
[9:13] could speak
[9:15] is the one that prophesied
[9:19] and is speaking here now
[9:22] i'm only
[9:25] giving a voice
[9:27] to his words
[9:30] he says
[9:32] the leodisian
[9:34] age began around the turn of the
[9:40] 20th century
[9:43] perhaps
[9:45] 1906
[9:48] how long will it last
[9:52] how long
[9:54] we do not know
[9:58] now
[10:00] he
[10:01] mentions how that god
[10:05] had given him
[10:07] seven major visions
[10:10] one morning
[10:13] in the year
[10:16] 1936
[10:18] i would i want those numbers
[10:23] or that number of that year
[10:26] to remain
[10:28] in your mind
[10:30] primarily
[10:32] and see the background
[10:35] from which
[10:36] this man
[10:38] is speaking
[10:40] the word of god
[10:42] not in 2022
[10:46] not in
[10:48] 20
[10:50] uh
[10:50] 2020
[10:52] not in
[10:53] 1900s
[10:56] nothing of the kind
[10:58] no my friends
[11:00] this is
[11:01] in
[11:02] 33
[11:04] praise god hallelujah but now he says
[11:09] i base
[11:11] this prediction
[11:13] prediction
[11:16] on seven major continuous
[11:19] visions
[11:21] that came to me
[11:23] one morning
[11:25] in june
[11:27] 19
[11:28] 33
[11:30] the lord jesus spoke to me
[11:33] and
[11:34] said
[11:35] that the coming of the lord was drawing
[11:38] nigh
[11:40] but that before he came
[11:44] seven major events
[11:47] would transpire
[11:50] or would take place
[11:53] and so i wrote them down he wrote them
[11:56] down
[11:58] and that morning
[12:00] came to his church
[12:03] and he spoke these things that god
[12:07] had revealed and made known to him
[12:13] he gave out
[12:14] for it was a
[12:16] genuine
[12:17] revelation of god
[12:20] that was being made known
[12:22] god shining his great light
[12:26] on the age of lodesia
[12:30] opening up a window
[12:33] through which
[12:35] we could look through
[12:37] using the eyes
[12:39] of god's prophet
[12:40] who has already seen this
[12:43] and said thus saith the lord
[12:48] and the now the first vision
[12:51] as we come to these visions
[12:54] is
[12:55] the vision was
[12:57] that
[12:59] i saw mussolini
[13:02] would invade ethiopia
[13:05] and that that nation
[13:08] would fall
[13:09] at his steps
[13:12] and that vision caused repercussions
[13:16] many were very angry with me
[13:21] when i said it
[13:23] and they would not believe it
[13:27] but it happened anyway
[13:30] he just walked in there with his modern
[13:33] arms
[13:35] and took over and the natives did not
[13:38] have a chance
[13:39] but the vision also said
[13:43] mussolini would come to a horrible end
[13:47] with his own people turning on him
[13:51] and that came to pass just exactly as it
[13:56] was said
[13:57] now remember
[14:00] this was said in 1933
[14:04] before
[14:05] any intimation
[14:08] any inclinations any signs
[14:11] of any such a thing
[14:14] it was spoken
[14:17] by the mouth of the lord
[14:20] oh my
[14:21] the next vision
[14:24] was concerning he looked in the in the
[14:27] true prophecy through the eyes the
[14:30] telescopic
[14:31] visions
[14:32] of a prophet
[14:34] and saw an austrian
[14:37] by the name of
[14:39] adolf hitler
[14:43] and saw that how he would rise up
[14:46] to be
[14:47] a dictator
[14:49] in over germany
[14:52] and by in that position he will draw the
[14:56] entire world
[14:58] into war
[15:01] in looking out there
[15:04] he saw the siegfried line
[15:08] and saw how
[15:10] the allies america
[15:13] would have a a hard time
[15:17] overcoming
[15:19] the sacred line
[15:22] and they had indeed that did have a
[15:25] rough time
[15:27] recorded well recorded
[15:29] in history
[15:31] but it he also saw
[15:34] that
[15:35] hitler would come to a very mysterious
[15:39] end which
[15:40] all those who
[15:42] have read of this man knows that he come
[15:46] to a mysterious end
[15:50] oh
[15:51] think of god telling these things
[15:56] to a man
[15:58] since 1933
[16:02] that we might know and understand
[16:07] how the age would unfold
[16:11] and what signs we are to look look for
[16:16] oh praise god
[16:18] the third vision he said
[16:21] i saw
[16:22] was in the realm
[16:25] of world politics
[16:28] for it showed
[16:31] that there would be three
[16:33] great isms
[16:36] fascism
[16:38] then that would be followed by something
[16:41] called nazism
[16:46] then
[16:48] followed by communism
[16:54] but that the first two
[16:57] would be swallowed up
[16:59] by the third
[17:01] which is communism
[17:05] and then i heard a voice
[17:09] voice admonishing me
[17:12] watch russia
[17:14] watch russia
[17:17] king of the north
[17:18] watch
[17:20] russia keep your eyes on
[17:23] russia
[17:25] oh
[17:26] my friends
[17:28] though it was this is not planned
[17:32] at our present time in our world
[17:36] we see
[17:38] russia on the
[17:40] borders of the ukraine
[17:42] there is much talk about
[17:44] russia russia rising up in this hour
[17:50] this of course
[17:52] was never planned
[17:53] it just happens to fall that way as god
[17:57] wants it that i will be speaking and i'm
[18:01] speaking on this topic here today that
[18:04] you might receive light on the day light
[18:08] on the word
[18:09] recognize the signs of your times
[18:12] recognize the cut nearness of the coming
[18:16] of the lord and be ready for his
[18:19] glorious and marvelous coming
[18:23] yes
[18:25] watch russia
[18:27] king of the north
[18:29] they have much to do
[18:31] in prophecy
[18:33] as we shall further see
[18:36] as we go on
[18:39] oh my
[18:41] the fourth vision
[18:44] showed to me
[18:46] that there would be great advances in
[18:50] science
[18:54] and that would come after
[18:57] the second world war
[19:00] after the second world war
[19:03] he was shown
[19:04] there would be an upsurge
[19:08] of scientific achievements
[19:10] taking place
[19:12] one after the other and all the progress
[19:15] that was made in the other ages
[19:19] science
[19:21] after the second world war with so
[19:24] advanced
[19:25] that they will accomplish even more in
[19:28] that shorter period of time which they
[19:32] have
[19:33] until this time
[19:35] in which we live
[19:38] he said
[19:40] great advancement in science friends
[19:42] we're looking at it
[19:45] we're seeing all these rockets
[19:48] we're seeing all the advancement in in
[19:50] electronics
[19:52] we see the advancement in medicine
[19:55] we see the advancement in every uh
[19:59] branch of science everywhere
[20:03] but in particular
[20:05] when he looked
[20:07] just like danielle the prophet looked
[20:11] thousands of years ago
[20:13] and he could not describe cars
[20:16] said he looked and he saw
[20:18] highways
[20:19] he used the word highways
[20:22] and i saw chariots
[20:26] with eyes brighter than dragons
[20:30] he could not describe a car he saw this
[20:33] car headlights
[20:35] he said and they were running swiftly in
[20:38] the streets
[20:40] jostling traffic jams
[20:43] jostling one another
[20:45] like that man running to and fro
[20:49] my friends
[20:50] in that like manner
[20:54] this prophet
[20:55] looked
[20:56] when he looked he said i saw
[21:00] a car but the car first i want you to
[21:04] notice
[21:05] at that time cars were heavy
[21:09] they were made of steel
[21:11] they were just like tanks
[21:14] and there were large
[21:16] and long
[21:18] red fish tales and all manner of things
[21:22] of that nature
[21:23] my friends
[21:25] what he said i looked and saw in the
[21:28] vision a plastic bubble top car
[21:34] another place he described the car as
[21:37] having a
[21:38] shape like an egg
[21:40] oh my
[21:42] and it was running down
[21:45] the highways
[21:48] under something like a remote control
[21:52] right
[21:53] and the people appeared seated in this
[21:58] car
[21:59] without it having a steering wheel
[22:04] oh my
[22:05] 1933
[22:07] [Music]
[22:08] he is saying these things
[22:11] on the inspiration of the holy spirit
[22:15] and saying there will be such a car
[22:18] we're controlled by remote control
[22:23] now
[22:24] we haven't come to the fullness of that
[22:26] completely as yet they're working on it
[22:29] right now as we speak uh you can
[22:33] right now you can get in some cars and
[22:36] press a button and
[22:38] hold the steering wheel and it will park
[22:41] itself exactly
[22:43] the way it should park
[22:45] there are trucks now on the road that
[22:48] are being tested that would be able to
[22:51] go for uh hundreds of miles without a
[22:55] driver under remote control and this was
[23:00] spoken
[23:02] by god's servant
[23:04] in 1933
[23:08] people appeared sitting in the car
[23:12] without a steering wheel
[23:15] and
[23:17] they were so unconcerned about anything
[23:19] they were so used to it and unconcerned
[23:22] he said they were playing
[23:26] some sort of a game
[23:28] this this family in this car
[23:32] just sat around
[23:34] playing games and the car was taking
[23:38] them
[23:39] to where they wanted to go and their
[23:42] eyes of god's prophet looked and saw it
[23:47] now in the fifth vision
[23:51] this
[23:52] servant of god
[23:54] saw a great moral problem
[23:58] on the face of the earth
[24:01] and in this age
[24:03] and that moral problem
[24:06] as in the garden
[24:08] centered around women
[24:12] i quote
[24:13] god showed me
[24:15] that
[24:16] women began to be out of their place
[24:21] with the granting of the boat
[24:26] then
[24:27] next
[24:28] they cut off their hair
[24:33] which signified
[24:35] that there were no longer
[24:38] coming under the authority
[24:41] of a man
[24:43] but insisted
[24:45] on having their equal rights
[24:49] and in most cases
[24:51] more
[24:52] than equal rights
[24:56] certainly
[24:57] she said he looked and saw she began
[25:01] adopting man's clothing now you you must
[25:05] remember in those days in which he was
[25:08] speaking
[25:09] women wore
[25:11] long dresses
[25:13] down to the knees
[25:16] down to the ankles
[25:19] and
[25:20] their
[25:21] sleeves
[25:23] were ruffled right down
[25:26] to
[25:27] their wrist
[25:29] and to the neck
[25:31] it was right up they were completely
[25:34] covered
[25:35] and clothed
[25:38] and here is this anointed servant of god
[25:42] prophesying
[25:44] that he looked and saw
[25:47] women
[25:48] beginning to wear man's apparel
[25:52] of course
[25:53] that is totally unscriptural for the
[25:56] bible tells us in the book of
[25:58] deuteronomy she
[26:00] how that she shall not put on the
[26:03] garments that pertain to a man
[26:06] its abomination in the eyes of god says
[26:09] the scriptures
[26:11] listen to god's servant
[26:14] she adopted man's clothing
[26:19] and
[26:22] went into a state
[26:25] of undress in other words once
[26:28] her morality began to slip
[26:33] dropping our standards
[26:35] until she would wear men's clothing
[26:39] then of course
[26:42] it began to slip and slip
[26:45] until it came to the state
[26:48] where she would almost feel comfortable
[26:52] walking around in a state or condition
[26:57] of undress
[27:00] in the last picture or vision that i saw
[27:05] last picture i saw
[27:09] i saw a woman
[27:12] listen
[27:13] naked
[27:16] except for a little fig leaf type of
[27:20] apron
[27:23] and with this vision
[27:25] i saw the terrible perversion
[27:29] and the moral plight
[27:31] upon the whole world
[27:36] his sixth vision
[27:40] i looked
[27:41] and saw
[27:44] a great
[27:46] a woman
[27:47] cruel woman
[27:49] rise up
[27:51] in america
[27:55] this was the rise i believe
[27:58] of the catholic church
[28:02] i knew it could be
[28:05] a vision also
[28:07] of some woman
[28:10] rising
[28:12] into great power
[28:15] in america
[28:17] due
[28:18] to the popular vote
[28:21] of
[28:22] women
[28:24] oh my friends
[28:26] i want you to know
[28:29] that this was spoken
[28:31] in 1933.
[28:34] this is 2022.
[28:38] listen
[28:40] here
[28:41] in a marvelous wonderful powerful and
[28:45] revealing message
[28:47] entitled
[28:49] painted face jezebel
[28:54] but in the united states
[28:57] the woman
[28:59] is the head of the house here now
[29:02] this
[29:04] is a woman's country
[29:06] and that woman is a god of america
[29:11] i predict
[29:12] that before the coming of the lord
[29:16] that a woman
[29:18] will be a great
[29:20] ruler
[29:21] that's to say president
[29:24] in the united states
[29:28] because it's a woman's country
[29:30] and it all started in hollywood
[29:33] and it has to run its way
[29:36] right out see
[29:38] so there you go my friends prophecy
[29:42] of something that could not even be
[29:45] dreamed of
[29:46] back in those days
[29:48] that a woman
[29:50] would become
[29:52] president of the united states
[29:56] a woman is now
[29:57] the vice president of the united states
[30:02] let's keep our eyes
[30:05] upon prophecy
[30:07] upon the words of the prophet
[30:10] for modern events
[30:13] are made clear
[30:16] by vindicated prophecy
[30:20] oh praise god
[30:22] it has been spoken
[30:25] and now it's fulfilling itself in our
[30:28] day
[30:30] where we're not just listening to
[30:32] prophecy
[30:33] but we're watching it unfold before
[30:36] our very eyes
[30:38] oh friends
[30:40] listen
[30:42] in the seventh vision
[30:45] i heard
[30:47] a terrible noise
[30:50] a terrible explosion
[30:53] and as i turned to look
[30:56] i saw
[30:58] nothing
[30:59] but debris
[31:02] craters
[31:05] and billows of smoke
[31:08] rising all over
[31:11] america
[31:12] he saw
[31:15] his beloved nation
[31:17] of the united states
[31:20] growing up
[31:22] in smoke
[31:26] and then he says based
[31:28] on these
[31:29] seven
[31:30] visions
[31:35] along with the rapid changes
[31:38] which
[31:39] have swept
[31:41] the world
[31:43] quoting now
[31:45] from the revelation series
[31:49] remember let me say it again i am now
[31:52] quoting from his revelation series of
[31:56] sermons
[31:58] from his sermon
[32:00] the laodicean church age
[32:03] paragraph 43
[32:06] now we believe
[32:09] the ledician church age
[32:11] started in a.d
[32:14] 1906
[32:17] i predict
[32:19] now remember this
[32:22] i predict
[32:25] especially to you
[32:27] listening
[32:29] on the tape
[32:31] i don't say that it will be that way
[32:36] but i predict
[32:40] it will end by 1977
[32:46] that the church
[32:48] would
[32:49] go completely into apostasy
[32:54] and she will be ousted
[32:56] out of the mouth of god
[32:59] now i want i would speak on the fact
[33:02] here
[33:03] that that's the mighty angel prophesying
[33:06] speaking about the end of the church
[33:08] ages time shall be no more
[33:11] but he saw this and he
[33:15] as a man predicted that it would end
[33:19] about 1977.
[33:23] shall be ousted out of the mouth of god
[33:27] and the second coming
[33:30] or the rapture of christ
[33:32] might come anytime
[33:36] now i me i could miss that
[33:40] by a year
[33:42] i could miss it
[33:44] 20 years
[33:46] i could even miss it
[33:48] a hundred years
[33:51] i don't know where or when
[33:55] i just
[33:57] predict
[34:00] according to a vision
[34:03] that he showed me
[34:05] taking the time the way it's progressing
[34:10] this great nation
[34:12] at least i can see
[34:15] is going to strike a war
[34:19] and that war
[34:21] is going to blow it
[34:24] to bits
[34:26] now that's pretty close awful close
[34:30] i could be wrong
[34:32] because i am
[34:34] predicting
[34:36] everybody understand it
[34:39] i'm only predicting other places you
[34:42] said i do not prophesy but i predict on
[34:47] this one thing about the
[34:51] ending of the lyodisian church age
[34:55] oh praise god forevermore for his great
[34:58] grace
[34:59] and
[35:00] love that he's a mighty wonderful god
[35:05] now let me say this
[35:08] can anyone prove
[35:10] any of these visions
[35:14] wrong the prophet spoke these visions
[35:18] every one has come to pass
[35:22] listen he said
[35:24] each one has been fulfilled
[35:28] and the rest is in the process right now
[35:32] and i say to you that is exactly right
[35:35] the rest is in the process right now
[35:39] oh hallelujah
[35:41] from mussolini invaded ethiopia
[35:45] successfully then fell
[35:48] and lost it all
[35:51] hitler started a war
[35:53] that he could not even finish
[35:56] and died
[35:57] mysteriously
[35:59] as you know
[36:00] communism
[36:02] took over
[36:03] both fascism
[36:06] and nazism and swallowed it all up
[36:11] the bubble car
[36:14] has been built
[36:16] and is now only awaiting
[36:20] a better network of cars now
[36:24] listen
[36:26] with a spiritual mind i want you to pick
[36:28] up these things
[36:30] one
[36:32] he's already prophesying in 1933
[36:36] that cars will move away from using
[36:40] being built with steel
[36:43] to being made out of plastic material
[36:49] 1933
[36:51] that there were the cars will tend to be
[36:54] plastic
[36:56] suddenly the shapes of the car
[36:59] he already prophesied
[37:01] they would start having this rounded
[37:04] edges away from the long heavy
[37:08] tank like square
[37:10] uh shapes they had
[37:12] but under
[37:14] the vision of god
[37:16] he saw
[37:18] how the cars
[37:20] would
[37:22] have these rounded ships
[37:25] amen
[37:27] and
[37:28] he even saw the roads
[37:31] and said they'd have to have a better
[37:33] network of roads
[37:36] because these cars are going to run by
[37:38] remote control
[37:40] they're going to be under some kind
[37:42] another place is that some kind of
[37:45] power electronic power they're going to
[37:48] be under whatever that is now we we can
[37:53] talk now about gps we can talk about
[37:55] these things it's all right before us
[37:58] but a
[38:00] simple humble anointed man spoke these
[38:03] things on the inspiration of the holy
[38:06] spirit
[38:08] giving us visions
[38:10] of the laodicean age
[38:12] oh
[38:13] my
[38:14] oh yes
[38:16] women are all but naked
[38:22] and are even now
[38:24] beginning to wear topless
[38:27] bathing suits
[38:29] he said just the other day i saw in a
[38:32] magazine
[38:34] the very dress i saw in a vision
[38:38] in the vision
[38:39] it was plastic
[38:42] it was transparent
[38:45] of course he is prophesying that there
[38:47] will be a change in dress because what
[38:50] was back in his time 1933 were women
[38:54] with long dresses as i said with the
[38:57] long covered right to their wrists into
[39:00] their neck and he's already by vision
[39:03] seeing this
[39:04] on the inspiration of the holy spirit
[39:08] and for telling it
[39:09] by the glory of god hallelujah
[39:13] oh yes he said this dress
[39:16] was plastic
[39:19] and
[39:20] transparent
[39:23] it was transparent
[39:25] with three dark spots
[39:29] two covering
[39:31] the breasts on the top
[39:34] and a dark
[39:36] spot
[39:38] like an apron covering below
[39:42] my friends
[39:44] he continued
[39:45] he said now
[39:47] we also see the catholic church
[39:51] is
[39:52] on the rise
[39:54] right and
[39:57] we have
[39:58] one catholic president
[40:01] listen to this prophecy that there will
[40:03] be another back then john f kennedy
[40:07] came on the scene
[40:09] catholic president and he's already
[40:12] speaking
[40:13] 1933 there will be another
[40:18] and i believe right now
[40:22] there is
[40:23] another
[40:25] let us pay attention
[40:27] to the signs of the times
[40:30] the things of god that are pointing us
[40:33] back to his word
[40:35] letting us know that his word is true
[40:38] oh my
[40:40] listen friends
[40:42] i want you to
[40:44] hear this in particular
[40:48] listen
[40:50] thus saith the lord
[40:54] repent

[41:04] is called the iron curtain
[41:08] which will be

[41:30] watch that purple curtain
[41:34] that one will rise up
[41:37] in the united states
[41:39] and all over the world
[41:43] for it is the rise of the
[41:46] roman empire
[41:49] religiously speaking
[41:51] the cruelest
[41:53] of them
[41:55] all
[41:56] remember i say this in the name of the
[41:59] lord
[42:01] get away from it

[42:49] yet once more i shake not the earth
[42:53] but the heavens also
[42:56] once more god shall shake the earth
[42:59] and it will shake everything loose
[43:02] that can be shaken

[43:51] are shaking
[43:52] falling apart
[43:54] empty
[43:56] no adherence
[43:58] discipleship
[44:00] on the way down
[44:03] man
[44:04] running everywhere
[44:08] we find socially
[44:10] society
[44:12] is shaking
[44:14] morally
[44:16] shaking politically
[44:18] shock waves
[44:20] striking the earth everywhere
[44:24] amen
[44:25] we see
[44:27] this religious world
[44:29] shaking
[44:30] nature itself trembling
[44:33] on the climate change earthquakes
[44:37] pollutants
[44:39] everywhere
[44:41] the endangerment of species
[44:44] the passing away
[44:46] of various
[44:47] uh elements and things in the world
[44:51] the whole
[44:53] world order
[44:54] is shaking
[44:56] and showing
[44:57] the evidence of change
[45:01] the coming of a new world order a new
[45:04] system
[45:06] it's in its birth pains right now
[45:09] and everything else is being
[45:11] torn down
[45:12] being destroyed
[45:15] all that it can be reorganized
[45:18] remade
[45:19] deconstruction so they can
[45:22] do their reconstruction
[45:25] in their image and in particular i say
[45:29] in the image of the peace according to
[45:33] the bible amen so there's a lot of
[45:38] shaking going on for god said i'll shake
[45:43] the earth i'll shake the heavens also
[45:47] amen
[45:48] yes
[45:49] now back to the word
[45:52] last march
[45:54] 1964
[45:57] the good earthquake of alaska
[46:00] shook the entire world
[46:03] though it did not unbalance it
[46:08] see
[46:09] because another sermon god speaking
[46:12] through him talks about an earthquake
[46:14] that will strike the world that will
[46:17] throw the earth off its axis and change
[46:21] all the weather patterns and so on but
[46:23] that's another time oh
[46:26] oh so here it is
[46:29] god warning
[46:31] by a world tremble what he was going to
[46:34] do

[47:13] over to the lord jesus christ our
[47:16] faithful shepherd who loves you
[47:18] will care for you who will protect you
[47:22] and present you faultless before the
[47:26] glory of the eternal one
[47:28] in the in this ex exceeding great joy
[47:32] and i give him praise
[47:34] and honor and glory here today
[47:39] friends
[47:41] this man
[47:43] this prophet
[47:46] this servant
[47:48] this son
[47:51] and this saint of god
[47:54] in our day
[47:56] at this the end
[47:59] and ending
[48:00] of the gentile dispensation
[48:05] many have misunderstood him
[48:10] the man the best misunderstood the man
[48:14] they have misunderstood his ministry
[48:19] purpose
[48:20] and its meaning
[48:22] and they have misunderstood
[48:26] and still do
[48:27] his message
[48:29] which is still now in progress
[48:33] now remember
[48:36] as i
[48:36] conclude
[48:38] in every age
[48:40] in every time
[48:42] they've always tried to paint
[48:45] true
[48:46] prophets
[48:48] as crazy men
[48:51] as they were just odd fellows
[48:56] because there were men of the forest
[49:00] men of the deserts
[49:03] men of the mountains
[49:05] men that would go off and pray for long
[49:08] hours alone
[49:11] man that would be in the presence of god
[49:15] oh hallelujah
[49:17] and there
[49:19] can only be one
[49:21] major prophet to a generation there may
[49:25] be minor prophets but only one major
[49:29] prophet
[49:31] and i believe
[49:33] and teach
[49:35] william marion branham is god's major
[49:40] prophet
[49:41] that was said to this 20th century
[49:45] and he has fulfilled his mission
[49:49] the word has gone forth
[49:51] it lives in me now
[49:53] it lives in the hearts of millions
[49:56] around the world
[49:58] and it will continue to live
[50:02] long past the end of time
[50:04] until we enter
[50:06] into the glorious presence of the lord
[50:09] and so here we are
[50:11] we have
[50:12] seven visions
[50:15] concerning this age of leodisia
[50:21] course of events
[50:22] that would take place during the age
[50:24] from the beginning of it to the end of
[50:27] it
[50:29] and that is why i agree
[50:32] with our dear brother john paul
[50:34] lafontaine
[50:37] the writer of a wonderful song
[50:40] which i hold dear and i hum and i sing
[50:43] it within my heart
[50:45] this world is falling apart
[50:48] but jesus still lives down in my heart
[50:53] hallelujah
[50:54] and i thank god
[50:56] that those words are true and will
[50:58] remain true
[51:00] that this world
[51:02] is falling apart
[51:04] what you need to thank god for
[51:07] is that jesus christ
[51:09] our lord lives down in your heart and if
[51:12] he is not there
[51:14] i ask you tonight
[51:17] to let the great holy spirit come in
[51:20] let him find let that dove of peace
[51:24] find a nesting place
[51:26] within
[51:28] the altars of your heart
[51:30] god bless you
[51:32] good to have had you
[51:34] may the word of god
[51:37] rest richly between
[51:40] [Music]
[52:13] you
