[0:00] free and and it's its own person I don't
[0:03] have to answer to the pastor and it just
[0:05] moves when it wants to move then you
[0:08] really don't have anything because the
[0:10] house can fall down at any time but when
[0:13] you have people that are
[0:16] solidly AC in the presence of God are
[0:20] faithful they are like armor bearers to
[0:23] the minister unto the word they are in
[0:27] helps they have to minister governments
[0:30] on them
[0:31] administrations like um you know I don't
[0:35] really consider myself a great
[0:36] administrator but there are people in
[0:38] here that have those gifts uh that can
[0:40] assist me in administration there's
[0:43] other people that assist me so that's
[0:44] how the body works we we fing for one
[0:47] another and we don't think because I'm
[0:50] the hand and I can pick up something and
[0:52] the foot can only walk I'm better than
[0:53] the foot I'm not better than the foot
[0:56] because the hand is the foot the hand
[0:58] can't get anywhere without the foot
[1:00] everything has to work together amen and
[1:03] we need each other none of us is
[1:05] complete within ourselves no matter how
[1:07] confident you think you are you are not
[1:12] um fully complete within yourself right
[1:17] the body of Christ has to work together
[1:20] for the glory of God amen amen I must
[1:23] say uh I also am very happy to see how
[1:26] The Prayer Ministry is
[1:28] progressing and and what God is doing
[1:31] through it and the Miracles the signs
[1:34] the Wonders and the healings that are
[1:35] taking place I'm very thankful and
[1:39] pleased to God and I believe that by the
[1:42] end of this week by next Sunday uh I've
[1:45] written a booklet on prayer uh just
[1:48] brief on prayer that I think will be
[1:51] helpful uh to the congregation in how to
[1:55] pray under certain
[1:57] circumstances and we like to give that
[1:59] out to every one of you have my daughter
[2:02] starting to prepare it now uh it's just
[2:05] going to be about one page or two pages
[2:08] but it's just enough to stimulate you
[2:10] into an atmosphere of prayer praise the
[2:14] Lord and I trust God will richly bless
[2:16] you let a wonderful way I want to thank
[2:19] all the brothers that stood in the Gap
[2:22] while I was away um whether they
[2:25] ministered or not because everything
[2:27] still has to work uh like that amen for
[2:31] the minister to stand here a lot of
[2:33] background work has to be done and a lot
[2:36] of people are involved in it so we thank
[2:39] God that the church should work like a
[2:42] watch where you look and you see just
[2:44] the hands of the face right but you
[2:47] don't realize that there are main
[2:49] Springs and subsidiary Springs and
[2:52] everything else working in the
[2:53] background just for me to stand here
[2:56] right I just happen to be the face but
[2:58] everything is working in the background
[3:01] and we thank God for every one of you
[3:03] brothers and sisters amen amen is that
[3:06] right amen I want you to know that the
[3:09] only thing that God says a woman should
[3:12] not do in the church is to stand up here
[3:15] and preach or Minister the word of God
[3:19] other than that in this church you're
[3:22] open to everything else by the grace of
[3:25] God that's a white statement so take it
[3:28] um as it is the end is come is my topic
[3:32] today wow the end is come and the
[3:35] scripture is found in Ezekiel 7 verse
[3:58] 6
[4:00] amen all right let's read
[4:04] together and uh the end is come the end
[4:09] is come it watch for thee behold it is
[4:15] come amen praise the Lord God bless his
[4:19] word father we thank you for the reading
[4:21] of your word we pray and ask your
[4:24] blessing upon it and sanctify it and
[4:28] give us the inspiration thereof in the
[4:31] name of Jesus we ask it amen and amen
[4:34] God richly bless you amen praise
[4:40] God you know when you're young time
[4:44] seems to um move
[4:47] slowly is that right it seems like the
[4:50] days are long the nights are long and
[4:54] when you get into the school it looks
[4:56] like uh the classes don't end
[5:00] it goes on forever and things like that
[5:03] you know but as you grow older it seems
[5:07] like time passes much quicker somehow
[5:12] like there are not enough hours in the
[5:14] day and that's the way it is um well
[5:19] 365 days is actually
[5:24] 8,760
[5:26] hours
[5:28] five
[5:33] 25,600
[5:35] minutes and 31
[5:39] milon
[5:42] 536 seconds makes up an entire year
[5:48] praise the
[5:49] Lord uh when you think of uh of a year
[5:53] or of the future we can all say our
[5:57] future is certain amen
[6:00] and the reason why I use the word that
[6:02] the future is certain is because Ready
[6:05] or Not is
[6:07] coming is that right whether you are
[6:10] prepared to receive it or you are ready
[6:13] for it it's coming anyhow so we've got
[6:17] to be prepared now the Bible says I will
[6:22] guide thee with my
[6:24] eye and so we can see that even though
[6:28] God says he will guide us with his eyes
[6:32] yet our future is
[6:35] uncertain for sure it's coming but now
[6:39] you have to live in that
[6:42] future and then your future becomes
[6:45] uncertain because you don't know what is
[6:48] going to occur or what is going to take
[6:51] place and what the future holds the
[6:54] Bible tells us
[6:56] psalms
[6:58] 27
[6:59] verse
[7:01] one Bast not thyself of
[7:05] tomorrow for thou knowest not what a day
[7:10] might bring forth a lot of things can
[7:13] happen in the day you can start out the
[7:17] day happy and right and everything else
[7:20] and before the day is over you can be as
[7:24] down in depression as possible so things
[7:28] can change on Dy just like that right
[7:32] and we know friends that happiness peace
[7:36] and all these things don't just go
[7:39] lasting forever while we are in human
[7:41] life it comes in waves and Cycles yes
[7:45] like that it comes there's got to be ups
[7:48] and they got to be Downs amen there's
[7:50] got to be mountain tops there got to be
[7:52] valleys there light and there is dark
[7:55] and so on we have to face these uh this
[7:59] cudes or changes of life that take place
[8:03] in The Human
[8:05] Experience uh turn with me to 1
[8:08] Corinthians 10 uh verse
[8:27] 11 can we all read this
[8:32] now all these things happen unto them
[8:37] for
[8:38] amples and they are written for our
[8:43] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[8:47] world are come didn't say the end of the
[8:51] world but the ends of the world so when
[8:55] I see ends I got curious and I looked at
[8:58] that and sure enough in the NIV it says
[9:03] there unto whom the Fulfillment of the
[9:09] ages have come wow amen so Paul is
[9:15] speaking here and he's talking about the
[9:18] cycle of the church
[9:20] ages and the things that were going to
[9:23] be in his
[9:25] time but now we can say that the end is
[9:31] G for the angel has already
[9:35] descended and plac his foot on the land
[9:39] and on the sea amen and as already
[9:42] announced time shall be no more now we
[9:47] understand it means time of the church
[9:49] ages the
[9:52] dispensational time for the church ages
[9:55] are now over it's over done with and
[10:00] here we are sitting at the end of those
[10:03] Church ages ready for what crossing over
[10:08] is all right we're at the Crossing we in
[10:11] the age of Brotherly kindness lodia amen
[10:15] and here we are physically I'm talking
[10:18] about we are at the Crossing which is
[10:21] what I've been preaching to you that
[10:23] only the Holy Spirit opening up the word
[10:27] to you like he opened up Jordan to the
[10:30] Israelites to cross over into the
[10:32] promised land yes you remember the
[10:34] scripture first Joshua Joshua chapter 1
[10:37] how the priest had to advance uh by
[10:40] faith into the word into the water and
[10:43] as soon as their feet touched the water
[10:46] of Jordan Jordan parted yes and they
[10:49] were able to walk over on the other side
[10:53] which is a type that when the Ministers
[10:55] of the word begin to break into the
[10:57] genuine revelation
[10:59] of the word the word is going to start
[11:02] to open up to them and to the people and
[11:05] they're going to walk right over and
[11:07] walk right through and plant their feet
[11:10] in the promised land of God's word amen
[11:14] thank you Lord hallelujah so we thank
[11:16] the Lord Jesus for that now the
[11:19] Fulfillment of the ages have come what a
[11:22] wonderful time to be living in amen that
[11:25] we are living in the age of what the
[11:28] Fulfillment of Prophecy amen and more
[11:31] than that we are a part of the prophecy
[11:34] yes and we thank God that it is becoming
[11:38] unto us to play our part or to fulfill
[11:41] all righteousness all that is written of
[11:44] the Bride in the word we are called to
[11:48] fulfill amen and this is the hour where
[11:51] we are here taking the bride stand and
[11:55] you know what the bright stand is it's
[11:57] the stand by husband the word stand by
[12:02] the word and not to move from it but to
[12:05] stay right by the word of the Living God
[12:09] and not move from it praise the Lord now
[12:12] we know friends that uh there are four
[12:16] things that we want to look at here
[12:18] today that will come to an end we know
[12:22] the word of God is never ending amen but
[12:25] four things that we know we can look at
[12:28] that will come to an end Amen brother
[12:31] brother the seal B says he says we're at
[12:35] the
[12:36] end preach the message Serv is this the
[12:40] end time of the end well we know that he
[12:44] recognize end of what he didn't mean
[12:47] just the end of the world he was telling
[12:49] the people that the church ages are over
[12:52] amen it's the end of the church ages and
[12:55] now we are breaking into a new and
[12:58] brighter day
[12:59] amen now first of all four things when
[13:03] we look at it we've come to the end of
[13:06] these Church ages then we look at the
[13:09] end of Nations a lot of nations are
[13:12] going to begin to break
[13:14] up and fall
[13:17] apart you just have to look into uh the
[13:21] world today and you can see what is
[13:24] happening right now we see how uh
[13:29] Abraham was called out of or of the ches
[13:33] we see how out of him came Israel and we
[13:38] know how they disobeyed God's word and
[13:42] after disobeying God's word they was
[13:44] scattered all to every part of the earth
[13:49] and being scattered into every part of
[13:52] the earth they were no more a nation
[13:56] they were they only became a nation
[13:59] when the United Nations gave them that
[14:03] designation again but other than that
[14:05] they were just scattered
[14:08] tribes but then they were
[14:11] recognized and so uh we recognize that
[14:14] every nation sometime or the other in
[14:18] their relationship with God their Nation
[14:21] can be broken to pieces and come to an
[14:25] end brother sister let me tell you God
[14:28] have Mercy on North America and the
[14:32] United States of America and Western
[14:35] Civilization when we look at the
[14:37] scriptures here
[14:39] today it is getting from bad to worse
[14:43] God have mercy upon us I'm going to be
[14:47] careful Christ have mercy upon us
[14:50] hallelujah oh Jesus amen Catholic means
[14:53] Universal by the way doesn't mean Roman
[14:56] amen praise God but the fact is God have
[15:00] mercy upon us because what do we see
[15:03] here in this age that we are living in
[15:06] we see here that the nations are putting
[15:09] God out of the
[15:10] schools still claiming to be Christian
[15:14] but putting out of the schools they're
[15:17] breaking down the values of
[15:20] society they're teaching all kinds of
[15:22] ungodly things within the school system
[15:26] to catch the minds of children when they
[15:30] young hoping that they won't depart from
[15:33] it when they get older teaching them
[15:36] everything else about this that the
[15:38] other now when we look at the what is
[15:42] taking place brother the corruption
[15:44] everywhere in government in
[15:48] politics in the
[15:50] schools teachers with students students
[15:53] with teachers not to be graphic and to
[15:55] outline everything with you but you know
[15:57] you read the papers you hear the
[16:00] news the entire is going wild I'm glad I
[16:04] already raised my children and there
[16:07] have to deal with whatever they have to
[16:08] deal with in this age but I I pray for
[16:11] you young people and those of you who
[16:13] have young children because what you
[16:15] have to deal with is worse than my time
[16:17] amen worse amen worse with my than my
[16:22] time and God help you and that's why you
[16:25] need to be here in the house of God so
[16:27] that you have a strong faith and a
[16:30] strong
[16:31] foundation so that like Timothy's
[16:34] grandmother when when Paul looked at
[16:37] Timothy he said I can see the Fai of
[16:39] your grandmother you need see your
[16:43] mother in you I can see it in you
[16:46] because what that faith that was once
[16:49] given to the Saints was just passed on
[16:52] down to Timothy and he grabbed a hold of
[16:55] it God helped every one of us here
[16:58] everyday that we will pass on this Faith
[17:01] to our children and to our children's
[17:04] children that we can have something in
[17:06] this world a light still shining in the
[17:09] middle of this world Amen praise the
[17:12] Lord amen yes sir giv over to modernism
[17:16] giv over to science given over to human
[17:19] reasoning that is what is going on here
[17:23] now the end is come and it's watching
[17:25] for you it's almost like saying Hell
[17:29] has opened his mouth and it's ready to
[17:32] receive you it's enlarged it's ready to
[17:35] take in as much as it can take in not
[17:39] only the end of Nations because here we
[17:42] see friends Egypt was powerful thought
[17:45] it will never end to
[17:48] C he said when thepoon was coning he
[17:53] thought his Empire would never end the
[17:57] Persians when there were running over
[17:59] the entire world they thought their
[18:01] empire would never end and then after a
[18:04] while it went to Spain the Spanish
[18:07] Armada was everywhere into the Americas
[18:11] all over and then we find out L France
[18:15] was the world power and their empire
[18:19] stretched all the way down into the
[18:21] South America and all the islands
[18:24] everywhere Vietnam that conquered all
[18:27] those places and their power was in
[18:29] Africa everywhere and fraternity you
[18:33] know equality everything else is brought
[18:36] from the masses From Below because those
[18:39] that were on the top became so
[18:42] corrupt and they got so corrupt that the
[18:44] people say we're going to die anyway we
[18:46] might as well put an end to this thing
[18:48] some of us going to die the rest of us
[18:50] going to live and we can change the
[18:51] country amen and that's what happened
[18:53] and then France itself fell from being a
[18:56] world power and we we see we see uh uh
[19:01] Britain rose up as the world B britania
[19:05] rules the waves no setting on the sun of
[19:08] the British Empire because their empire
[19:11] went from the F Islands way to the north
[19:14] everywhere the British had their power
[19:16] and so they felt that Empire would last
[19:19] for thousands of years then come the
[19:22] marching hordes of hiters
[19:25] Nazis and the third right was at hand
[19:29] and they felt their empire would stand
[19:32] forever and everything else but what do
[19:34] we know it's fallen in the words of
[19:37] brother BR he said all those Empires
[19:40] where are they they're under the desert
[19:43] signs he said every one of their leaders
[19:46] are dead gone and buried and it's all
[19:49] over with Persia under Babylon but Nezar
[19:53] all gone amen but friends modern events
[19:57] are made clear by vindica prophecy come
[20:01] on now we're looking at the United
[20:03] States and Canada and Western powers
[20:08] that are here and we see what is taking
[20:11] place now we know that there are seven
[20:15] dispensations of
[20:17] time broken up innocense in the time of
[20:21] Adam and Eve until that was uh broken by
[20:25] sin and then after they fell into see
[20:29] God put them under the the dispensation
[20:32] of operating by their conscience God in
[20:36] them convicting them and they operated
[20:39] under the dispensation of conscience and
[20:43] then they were under the dispensation of
[20:47] Promise called sometimes it's called a
[20:50] patriarch patrial or abrahamic right
[20:55] because Abraham got the promise so they
[20:57] were all the dispensation of Promise
[21:01] after that there were ruled by human
[21:04] government which means Kings and stuff
[21:07] like that but then what happened is that
[21:10] God then brought them under the
[21:11] dispensation of law right under Moses
[21:15] they were under law and the law ruled as
[21:18] a school Master until Christ came and
[21:22] when the Lord Jesus came and died for
[21:25] our sins then they dispensation of grace
[21:30] started right amen the dispensation of
[21:33] grace started at the crucifixion it ends
[21:37] at the resurrection and Rapture of the
[21:40] church is that right that's how it ends
[21:42] it starts with the crucifixtion and it
[21:45] ends because nothing was paid for before
[21:48] so no nobody could really be genuinely
[21:51] borned again they had to wait for the
[21:53] Lamb's blood to be shed before that they
[21:57] just believe
[21:58] unto eternal life is that right and they
[22:02] had to wait until he could take them out
[22:04] of paradise take them out of where the
[22:07] devil had them and move them with him
[22:10] into Paradise so in actual fact the the
[22:13] dispensation of grace started when he
[22:17] died on the cross and paid the
[22:19] Redemption price for our sins thank you
[22:22] and with Grace which is what God's
[22:25] unmerited favor which we didn't deserve
[22:28] none of us were born we haven't done any
[22:30] evil or anything like that yet but
[22:33] before we were yet sinners Christ died
[22:36] for the ungodly died for our sins and
[22:39] already paid the price thank you Lord so
[22:41] that you can confess your sins raise
[22:44] your hands and say thank God I am free
[22:48] free from this world of sin free from
[22:51] adamic sin free from what Adam and Eve
[22:54] free from the curse because Paul said he
[22:57] blotted out the sermons The handwriting
[23:00] the condemnation that was against us he
[23:03] destroyed it Hallelujah and now we are
[23:06] free by the grace of God
[23:09] hallelujah amen and of course the last
[23:12] dispensation will be the millennial
[23:16] dispensation now we are aware the end
[23:20] under the Fulfillment of the ages are
[23:24] come Hallelujah now the next step is the
[23:29] rapture and the millennial
[23:32] dispensation I'm talking about for the
[23:34] church now for the world there is
[23:36] tribulation for us is the Millennium
[23:39] praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[23:41] hallelujah amen oh praise God forever
[23:45] more listen what the scripture says
[23:48] Titus 2 verse 11 for the grace of God
[23:54] that bringeth salvation has appear to
[23:57] all all men thanks be to God that the
[24:01] word of God has come to us the Bible
[24:04] tells us Revelation
[24:06] 227 whosoever will let him take of the
[24:10] Water of Life freely praise God oh come
[24:15] unto me everyone that thirs are you
[24:17] thirsty for more are you thirsty for the
[24:20] Revelation are you thirsty for the word
[24:23] of God I can't stop drinking I got to
[24:26] keep drinking God because I'm thirsty
[24:29] for the revelation of the word of God
[24:32] Amen so our this dispensation will end
[24:37] at the Rapture of the Church of the
[24:40] Living God and when this dispensation
[24:43] ends God will take the Holy Spirit out
[24:47] of from the earth hallelujah amen take
[24:51] the Holy Spirit right out of the earth
[24:54] glory to God and right now he's
[24:56] gradually
[24:59] fing he's gradually going
[25:02] out and another quotation brother said
[25:06] the holy ghost is now dealing with and
[25:08] in the bride so when she goes the Holy
[25:11] Ghost goes amen hallelujah because the
[25:14] salt she's the salt the salt goes the
[25:16] the light goes the Holy Ghost goes amen
[25:20] and when he the holy spirit is taken out
[25:23] he that let it or he that hinders ceases
[25:26] to hinder when is taken out then just
[25:30] imagine a world without the Holy Ghost
[25:33] operating the way that he is
[25:35] now think about it that would be
[25:39] equivalent to the 400 years that
[25:42] occurred between
[25:45] Malachi and the Book of Matthew there's
[25:48] a
[25:49] 400e period of
[25:51] History which in isra Israeli history
[25:56] they call it their dark ages or their
[26:00] tunnel
[26:01] period because during those 400 years
[26:04] they had more
[26:06] prophets they had no inspiration or
[26:11] Revelation the dreams the things that
[26:13] were taking place before was not
[26:16] happening they did not know and they
[26:19] were persecuted from Nation to Nation
[26:22] ruled by Greece ruled by Persia ruled by
[26:25] this one that one until the last one
[26:27] before Jesus came was

[29:11] genders they got male female and utter
[29:14] gender and of course it can't produce
[29:17] nothing else because it's already

[30:35] praise God brother the Bible tells us
[30:39] that they were eating drinking marrying
[30:41] and giving in marriage until until mm
[30:46] until the day that Noah entered into the
[30:49] AR Noah Noah was a
[30:52] noer of the word m k n o w e r of the
[30:57] word word he brought the Revelation for
[30:59] his day on who do you think is know
[31:01] today it's you amen and the Ark is the
[31:04] word amen praise God until the day that
[31:07] this Rapture takes place and pulls us
[31:10] out of here they're going to be eating
[31:12] and drinking and mocking and laughing
[31:16] and I thought you said Rapture was going
[31:18] to come I thought I thought you Jesus
[31:20] was coming again I thought this and that
[31:22] was going to happen but until that day
[31:25] yes and when we are missing out to here
[31:28] they're going to realize that there's an
[31:30] ingredient an ingredient gone from the
[31:33] cake and it's is not tasting good
[31:36] anymore the sweetness gone out of it the
[31:39] love gone out of it the brotherly
[31:41] kindness gone out of it the temperance
[31:44] gone out of it godliness gone out of it
[31:47] the whole world gone crazy and The Taste
[31:50] isn't there anymore and then they're
[31:52] going to begin to realize that what we
[31:54] were telling them was the sin
[31:58] Lord amen God help those ones that heard
[32:02] a little bit of this and have belied it
[32:05] and was hanging in there then maybe they
[32:08] will come up as foolish
[32:10] virgins maybe they will come up as God
[32:13] make Believers but they'll have to go
[32:16] through some persecution to be processed
[32:19] and purified before they can be
[32:21] acceptable the God and accept a lesser
[32:24] position than sunship but to be servants

[40:23] back up a little bit here we now fa the
[40:26] fall of the American
[40:29] Empire how many recognize that
[40:32] that's she is
[40:35] honey and being eaten out amen by the PS
[40:43] are eating
[40:44] out like uh the ants that eat the wood
[40:48] out of a house yeah I've literally seen
[40:52] in Africa and in the southern climates
[40:54] where you have these wood eating ants
[40:57] yes there's a solid looking post a solid
[41:01] looking house and when you go you lean
[41:04] on it your elbow goes right through the
[41:07] wood because they eat out everything and
[41:10] leave a false fren facad yes that makes
[41:14] it look like it's solid yes but it's not
[41:17] solid it's empty it's shallow yes then
[41:21] then the Christians look like Christians
[41:23] empty shallow because the C the world
[41:26] time world the cater the buxs eat out
[41:29] the
[41:30] foundation and so with the nation all
[41:33] the foundations that was built upon out
[41:37] amen by his Wicked
[41:39] BS amen and we love we see the American
[41:43] Empire amen falling in every possible
[41:46] way look I looked up there before I came
[41:49] here researched on it the reasons for
[41:52] the fall of the Roman
[41:53] Empire and I I got about several reasons
[41:56] here one bad
[41:59] Emperors the Emperors became bad because
[42:02] they were having all kind of sexual
[42:04] ories and parties and drinking some of
[42:07] them were playing kill crazy Cula and
[42:11] the Nero was a mad man playing music you
[42:14] know caught up saying he's educated
[42:16] playing classical music while Rome is
[42:18] burning and people screaming and
[42:20] hollering and many others you know
[42:23] vaspian and so on different Emperors of
[42:26] Ro there bad leadership yes is that
[42:30] right yes bad leadership don't you see
[42:33] the same thing occurring right now again
[42:35] yes in the sense that American
[42:37] leadership from the time of of Abraham
[42:40] Lincoln George Washington Andrew Jackson
[42:43] it's it's deteriorating it's getting
[42:45] worse it's getting worse it's getting
[42:47] worse it's getting worse it's now g into
[42:49] the Cs brothers and sisters amen
[42:52] hallelujah amen and this is not left to
[42:55] one man you can put it on one man
[42:57] because he's mounting it but the whole
[42:59] thing is going down to the
[43:01] BS and we see the Empire falling right
[43:04] now so bad emper was one reason the
[43:07] second reason was economic
[43:11] troubl taking
[43:13] place because of over Reliance on cheap
[43:18] labor slave labor that's exactly what
[43:21] was in the book but I'm telling you
[43:24] they're bringing down wages to the point
[43:27] where people can hardly exist yes this
[43:30] is what this is saying Rome fell that
[43:33] was one reason why Rome fell because the
[43:36] people started getting desperate and
[43:39] they couldn't live anymore I'm not going
[43:42] to go deep in these things just give you
[43:43] them the next one was the rise of the
[43:47] Eastern Empire of Rome which means
[43:50] endless political in
[43:53] fighting the nation start fighting
[43:56] within itself what did Abraham Lincoln
[44:00] said a
[44:02] nation divided against itself it canot
[44:07] stand amen maybe he was prophesying but
[44:10] this is exactly what's going on now it's
[44:13] inviting it's not look brother BR he
[44:16] says don't worry about the the the uh
[44:20] Robin That's speaking the word that's
[44:22] speaking on the outside of the of the
[44:24] Apple New York
[44:26] which is symbolic of the whole United
[44:29] States he says you worry about the worm
[44:32] that's on the inside eating at the core
[44:35] yes yes don't worry about oh the K Trump
[44:38] you're going to fire rocket this one is
[44:40] going to do that that's not the thing
[44:41] you need to worry to much about he says
[44:43] you worry about the invasion of the
[44:45] United States of America from the inside
[44:48] am amen that's what you need to be
[44:51] worried about amen the next thing is
[44:54] overand
[44:56] I and Military
[45:00] overspending do you know that all the
[45:02] most powerful nations of the world the
[45:05] United States spends eight times more
[45:09] than all of them put together that is
[45:11] why you hear President Obama says what
[45:13] are what are they talking about you
[45:15] think China or Russia or one of them are
[45:17] stupid enough to try to attack us
[45:20] they're spending on their military
[45:22] budget when you add eight of those
[45:24] powerful Nations together it just start
[45:27] coming close to the American military
[45:29] budget it's just that they they are
[45:32] spending on more sophisticated
[45:34] technology so they don't have to have a
[45:36] bulk of a army oh Kim Jam has a million
[45:40] men a million men why you need a million
[45:43] men when I can fire two missiles and
[45:46] white a million
[45:47] men you see so this is why when uh Romy
[45:52] was saying we need to expand the Army we
[45:54] need to do this we need you you're
[45:56] cutting down the Air Force you're
[45:57] cutting down on the on the battleships
[45:59] and stuff he says Mr Romney you don't
[46:02] understand the time has changed one of
[46:04] our that our modernized aircraft
[46:08] carriers of bhip now can take out the
[46:10] whole Fleet of those ones you're talking
[46:12] about so we don't need as many right cuz
[46:16] they're sending out planes they're
[46:17] sending out guided missiles they're
[46:19] sending out all kinds of stuff from off
[46:21] of there it's like one big Armory like
[46:24] that so that's where we are over
[46:27] expansion on over spending on military
[46:31] budget government
[46:33] corruption and over taxation can
[46:37] somebody say amen I know some of you not
[46:39] over tax you want to pay
[46:42] more more
[46:46] I government corruption over taxation am
[46:50] the next thing for you know Mass
[46:54] migration
[46:58] because of
[46:59] War are we are you seeing something here
[47:02] mhm in other words when Rome was at its
[47:06] height War took place Germany was
[47:10] attacked by what by the Euro Asians
[47:13] which means to say I don't know if it
[47:16] was um if it was um um the H or whatever
[47:21] but they were attacked and and uh they
[47:24] were being overrun Spain and all those
[47:27] places were being overrun by these
[47:29] people and as such
