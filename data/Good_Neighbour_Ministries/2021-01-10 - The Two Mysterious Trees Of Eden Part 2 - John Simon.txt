TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] glory be to god again we are gathered here on this beautiful sunday morning to give glory and honor to his great and mighty and wonderful name to him be glory honor and praise shall we read from the word of god genesis chapter 2 verses 8 to 9 and genesis chapter 3 we shall be reading also and the lord god planted a garden east in eden and there he put man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil genesis 3 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea had god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said you shall not touch you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for god don't know that in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the ice and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took off the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves a prince gracious father we thank thee for the reading of thy word we ask your blessing upon your servant and may your word go forth father and may it run swiftly throughout the earth to accomplish your divine purposes for your glory and honor in the name of our lord jesus christ amen praise god hallelujah my dear friends i'm so happy to be here once again with you to speak on this subject of the two mysterious trees that were spoken of in the bible that are in the garden were in the garden of eden last week of course we spoke on this very subject instead of this sunday's what we had planned to do we plan to have the lord's supper but i feel the urgency uh to continue with this flow of the two mysterious trees of the garden of eden so i believe it clearly that we ought to grasp the gravity of this confrontation between the evil venomous and sinister person this spirit being called satan and the elect of god in these last days in our study we discovered that the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil are really persons and not uh physical trees that are out uh they're growing from the ground but these two trees were actually persons the tree of life was jesus christ was there in the garden of eden the tree of knowledge science good and evil was also there in the garden of eden just as he was in heaven he was there lucifer was there jesus christ was there now we find after satan was cast out then we see the scene changing and here are both of these trees or individuals or persons in the midst of the garden of god we learned of course how by possessing and using the physical characteristics of the serpent this person called the serpent who of course at that time was not a snake slinking along the ground for the bible tells us that he was an upright being and that he was subtle or wise or smart or intelligent more than all of the other beasts of the field you see satan this serpent called the serpent at that time later after the great sin and fall of man god cursed him and said now from today upon thy belly shalt thou go now we find that he was and is the missing link between man and the animals of course the bible tells us you can look at that in your own bible genesis chapter 3 and it will show you that this was a person looking like a man moving like a man even thinking but was the missing link between man and the beast was was so close to looking like a man that you you can be mistaken and so it is in the spirit world between a true believer and a make-believer there is such a thin line that one can be mistaken not realizing which is the true and which is the false but this serpent this missing link between man and the animal world could walk the bible tells us he could talk the bible also tells us he could reason and he had the physical characteristics whereby the bible said that he committed adultery with eve for she was deceived she was beguiled or defiled by this evil one working through the serpent to commit this act with eve adam's wife and the bible further tells us that she bore a son and his name was cain we know that eve of course did not really eat an apple that is just a myth that is just something that sounds uh much more decent and sounds a lot more acceptable and palatable to those who would like to hear it that way but it is the truth it is the word of god that eve really did not eat an apple but my friends she was a partaker of this tree of knowledge of good and evil you see she committed sexual sin with the tree of knowledge the serpent who of course is the originator of carnal knowledge which brought death to man through that particular sin now my aim is to show you that this dangerous confrontation that took place in the garden of eden this same dangerous deceiving confrontation is repeating again right now in our day our age while i'm speaking here now and beyond it has taken place in this day and time and now i also want to show how that the elect therefore must come in contact with satan in not the serpent back there but in religious persons that he can make a use of and speak through them and so the elect of this day must come into confrontation with the serpent in such persons face to face speaking and acting like religious people and uh they'll even claim to be christians and yet he will be working through that vessel to accomplish his goals and his aims yes my friends it's a dark hour it's a deceiving hour the most deceiving are the most deceiving day that we have ever seen for it's written by the prophet zechariah there shall be a day which shall not be dark nor light but at evening time it shall be light my friends i believe we are living in that dark day that dismal day that day as of a twilight time when darkness is now turning back to light when the sun my friends the sun is up for the elected of god the true children the sons and daughters of the living god who have committed themselves to live for him to love him to serve him all praise be to his marvelous and wonderful name now this day of religious deceit this religious receipt will be so close and so appealing to our human senses that we will humanly not be able to detect it for even jesus said that this will deceive the elect if it were possible it would deceive even the elect if it were possible you see my friends only hebrews 44 12 is really going to help us the word of god is quick and sharper than any two-edged sword and is a discerner of the hearts and the thoughts and the intentions of man and the divider oh praise god hallelujah lord of the great holy spirit working through the believer is able to separate true from faults my friends oh praise his wonderful name and it's only by hebrews 4 4 12 in you that you will be able to discern that it's only having god's token or a peace a token of god dwelling within you by which you are able you by or by which you are enabled to discern between good and evil for if we live in a day when the deception is so great that some call evil good and good evil listen god of this evil age paragraph 27 38 oh the real eve my friends she will be tried by the word tried by the word just like eve in the garden of eden the serpent came and he quoted the word of god to her and it was the word did not god say and then he quoted what god said but quoting it and misplacing it misrepresenting it dislocating it oh my friends we cannot do that in this day we must not dislocate misrepresent we should not do it my friends the word of god must stay in its rightful place and be spoken in its precise position to accomplish what it was set here for glory to god hallelujah amen you see the serpent today just as he was back then is going to be quoting from the bible he'll be calling from the message just you a little twist here or a twist there and it it'll troll a lot of people off of the word of god but the elect can not be deceived more than god himself can be deceived for in them he has placed a typos for the soul he has placed the rock of ages in them for the foundation stone was laid in them from before the foundation of the world the foundation stone the keystone the capstone in actual fact it is the same stone of the living god just as it marched through time amen it was our foundation it's the key to the word and holds everything together and then it's the capstone the headstone the husband of the entire body of the lord jesus christ amen oh praise god hallelujah amen now that serpent true such persons will caught the word quote the cops of the message amen hallelujah but you see i know the difference you know the difference if you're a true seed of god between the written word and the revealed word of god hallelujah amen you see i might not even sometimes understand with my head what the written word is saying even though i'm well acquainted with the english language and the various tones and the various lights and levels of the language but in my head or brain i may not understand the written word hallelujah but by revelation i understand what the written word is saying what it is saying what it is making known in this day day and time hallelujah in other words i know by the revealed word what the reveal what the written word is saying let me repeat that i know by the revealed word what the written word is really saying hallelujah only the activity and action of the holy spirit can do that my friends oh that is what we all need to be filled with god's spirit our lamps filled and clear look up our redemption is near oh glory god hallelujah amen listen as adam's bride was tried by the word and adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but got confused on one word oh my hat not god said one promise and this is repeating again in our day in our time we are to experience this test this word test tested by the very word that we claim to believe hallelujah failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face i want to stress that this now being fair to eve that was back there the serpent as or in a person spoke to eve and tempted her and deceived her with a temptation doing it face to face and now that is being repeated again literally satan speaking out of the mouth mind and life of religious individuals claiming to be christians preachers claiming to be your brother like cain claiming that that they are judas like that they claim all these claims right by you using the same word for they know it just as much as you do to test you by the very word that you are supposed to believe amen listen we had to come in contact again by the same thing a serpent again but in a being or person hallelujah listen not just denominational truth we are not to be tested just by denominational truth for that would not deceive us or something like that but to be tested by every word of god you will be tested by the genuine message the genuine bible the genuine word of god amen in the beginning man was given the word to live by one word rep misrepresented by a man a person called satan in the person of an animal called the serpent satan in this person could talk to eve have a discussion with eve a conversation with her and in doing so he misinterpreted the god's word to her and she was lost and it is happening again my friends it is happening again be vigilant be watchful oh keep your eyes upon jesus oh praise his marvelous name for the blessed holy spirit in our lives in our hearts if you do not have the holy spirit if you are not sure whether he lives in your heart by faith then raise up your heart and hands to god and ask god o gracious heavenly father grant to me the fullness of your holy spirit that i may have the wisdom of solomon to know your will and your word and then all other things gifts virtues all other graces and gifts will be given on to me hallelujah if i seek you first you the word made manifest in this hour then all those other riches of the glories of god will be made known to me by the great holy spirit the teacher of john chapter 14. oh praise god hallelujah amen yes sir the same thing is happening again the serpent standing there in the person face to face with you and using the word of god claiming to have have fellowship having fellowship so called with you as he did with eve in the garden here he comes but this time he comes again under the guise of christianity under the guise of a seducing an enticing spirit he comes again under the enticement of using the word of god which causes many believers to let down or drop their guard for what they're hearing is the word of god and then he just puts a little twist of his tail upon it amen yes sir so these persons standing before me standing before you with satan in them literally speaking through them directly to you and you can only discern it by the word not outwardly looking on whether they are well dressed or or whether the guy is by the roadside or whether he is poor or or already is uneducated or whether he is highly educated oh that has nothing to do with it he may be a highly educated devil he may be a highly educated scholar and still filled with the holy spirit in the casting out of devils i've seen the great principles of great colleges and uh uh being prayed for and demons lo and behold was coming out of them with all the knowledge all the wisdom so we can't discern it outwardly just by looking at those things we are tested by the word and we in turn test him by the word of god for he said to jesus i can give you the entire world and all of its glories and riches but jesus said but it is written amen oh my but he's it's written also but jesus but it is also written so it's the greatest battle ever thought it's god versus satan it's christ versus satan in this last day christ in the believer battling against satan working through the spirit of the world and persons who he can reflect himself through now of course we know such a person is not really going to deny god uh satan the bible tells us satan believes that there's a god and he trembles because he knows at the end of the age he's headed for the pits and so it's foolish when a man or a woman says there is no god for even the devil knows that there is a god and he's going to answer for his crimes he's going to answer for the wrong that he has done he's going to answer for it so he's not he's not going to deny god and he does not deny there is a god and he's not going to deny that there's a prophet and that this man william branham is a prophet uh and he may even uh my friends be more uh fluent than you are more knowledgeable than you are in the bible in the scriptures and he can quote them to you and you are going to stand there and you are going to quote revelation to him and he is going to quote scripture to you he's going to quote written word to you while you are quoting and speaking revelation to him amen and so the battle goes on like that amen listen praise god and the reason why that this is also deceptive because you're both quoting from the word one by revelation and one by just the written word using it for the spiritual deception and it's so close because you are speaking using the same word by revelation and he is using that word as is holding on to his substitute for that substitute was given until the real comes on the scene or the fullness of the word comes on the scene or the logos comes on the scene but his safety his safety is holding on to the rima or the written word physically written he can hold on to that uh he cannot go out launch out into the deep he cannot launch out unless god takes him out there my friend and so he holds his substitutes but the real believer stands by the re present revealed word of god for the hour and its action through their hearts and through their lives amen praise god hallelujah oh my he stands by thy written word not knowing that the written word is just for the seven church ages the written word is there for the seven church ages but the written word my friends does not bind does not uh hold the man or the woman that is being set free upon the eagle's wings by revelation for they are now in the eighth day they are in a different age rich in the stature of a perfect man brother branham called the eternal church age they have come out of those ages and they are in the s eternal church age said oh i'm waiting for that hour when that man that woman that will enter into that eternal church age at the ending of the seals oh glory be to god hallelujah amen yes sir thank god my friends think about it hallelujah the word of god is true and real and that is why some are still caught unconsciously not accepting or taking what the prophet of this day the 20th century prophets has said they don't understand that a a prophet is a divine interpreter of the word of god amen oh and we cannot rise above the the prophet of the hour of the age or today much less to think that you are going to challenge him and you are going to this all the knowledge you're going to display is human knowledge human wisdom human geology human apologetics yeah you're gonna display those things marvelously and wonderfully yes sir but listen a prophet is an interpreter of the word of god and he is the personification of the interpretation of the word of god hallelujah well you might say oh it's written in the word of god it's written in the message and right away those kinds of spirits will say show me where it is show me in the bible show me where the prophet said that give me the chapter or the verse and if you cannot give them they said where did you get that from uh that's maybe your own thoughts your own ideas oh my friends they'll walk away from you shaking their heads and not realizing what they have done thinking that you are wrong not knowing that unconsciously they took away from the word of god oh glory to god hallelujah you were tested by reason tested by reasoning through the very word of god you're supposed to believe and that is happening right now it's taking place or praise god and god is allowing it to test you and prove you in the wilderness that he will see if you will stay with this revealed word of the hour as much as job was tested to see if he would stay with the word for the hour even if everything else was taken from him would he stand with god's god's few would he stand with god's word will you stand with the promise of the day would you stand with a god set prophet with a message for this age generation for you this message was said oh glory to his marvelous wonderful name oh praise god saints of god this is our life this is our walk to walk with the king hallelujah don't miss your day don't miss your hour don't miss your season don't be deceived and don't miss your time amen because god has allotted us a certain amount of time here upon the earth let's use it for his glory and honor be willing to hear be willing to repent hallelujah and repent of any lukewarmness if you don't understand ask god for wisdom and he will certainly grant it to you amen for this bride has one interest is to know that she has that birthright that she has that token life manifesting in and through her for his glory and honor amen praise god i'm just preaching the word simple messy rough it may seem in my style my way of speaking for this is the way i was built oh my but friends one thing i know is when the word of god is preached the holy spirit rides on the word or follows the word to perform whatever that word says amen long after i've left this uh platform the holy spirit will be following my words god's words spoken through me will follow the word and it will hound you and follow you and take the word into the heart of the elected wherever they are in this world this wide world that we are living in he'll find his children for his sheep my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow oh glory to god hallelujah oh friends let's stay with god's word in every way hallelujah let's run quickly up the mountain let's find ourselves in the capstone for this day and the hour hallelujah and let's have this confidence that the father has promised he will reveal this to his bride wherever she may be whether she is by herself in the woods up on the mountaintop down in a valley in some far-off country on the sea god promised when you hear it it will ring a bell within your soul it'll make contact you may not understand what up here but something in here is going to tell you that's right that's the truth that's the word of god and you'll know that it's not just uh brother john simon standing here and speaking or bringing the word of god to you but the holy ghost has to take that word and confirm it within your soul all my friends i commit you to him for there are many out there they watch the people that are elected or are of that bride i want to walk like her talk like her act like her amen oh my but i tell you friends it's different once you have caught the genuine revelation of the spirit of god you have entered into another dimension and then you begin to walk in a world alone with god you and god alone walking of course there are others that you will meet walking the same road but when you have caught this revelation you are walking in a dimension with god alone and then you find that you're not impersonating you're not impersonating you are just following the leading of the holy spirit for you don't have to impersonate you don't have to presume uh whatsoever or may i say it along the classical lines or the lines of literary classic we are not trying to imitate the life of christ or to produce an imitation of the life of christ for this is the real thing him in you are i and he is living his own true life through us and bringing glory to his own marvelous name now these two trees in eden won the tree of life jesus christ the other the tree of knowledge and we know my friends that we cannot depend on human knowledge we don't even have to try to figure out what god says we are just asked to believe to trees knowledge and revelation or faith and you don't get revelation by study though study is good but you don't get revelation genuine revelation just by comparison text on text on text uh quote unquote on gold yeah that's wonderful keep it up but it's not by that it's by the genuine supernatural revelation of the holy spirit you don't get it by studying books you know you find god on your knees you don't get god by genealogy you get god by neology and that's the way think of it two trees in the garden let me be just a little bit uh clearer on this one of them coating my friends i want to coat and i want you to be able to follow here when their eyes were opened branham speaking remember them two trees in the garden of eden how many knows that one of them was the tree of knowledge the tree of science see the other was the tree of faith as long as man eat from the tree of faith he lived but the first bite he took from the tree of science science knowledge he immediately separated himself from god and destroyed himself and every time man bites eats from the tree of science he destroys himself now do you understand now why science which is really good and evil it's good for science is producing wonderful medicines wonderful helps wonderful uh things but on the other hand it's evil a tree of good and of evil notice man destroys himself he bit off gunpowder from that tree and he kills his friends his comrades man bit off knowledge of automobile from that tree of science and with it automobiles he kills more people than all the wars put together oh think of it science destroys what faith builds i have nothing against the tree of science or knowledge it has done wonders yes but you cannot depend on that tree we must depend on our faith for faith is everlasting believe on god believe he is raised from the dead he says life forevermore hallelujah oh don't go back to that scientific way of high breeding splitting here and mixing there and splitting and mixing and everything else get away he says from the scientific way of hybridin what a mess man has got himself into trying to take science now to split an autumn look what mess he is in right now god just lets him destroy himself oh come away from that hybrid tree get over here to the original fruit that's got life in it and eat of him eat of him praise god oh hallelujah brothers and sisters that is what we are supposed to do is to eat by faith of him and then we'll be saved will be healed we'll be having peace of mind happiness joy and the blessing of almighty god oh my one tree defiled and the other one that came from heaven that tree of life he said your fathers at manna in the wilderness and they are dead but this tree if you eat of it you will live forever amen hallelujah amen praise god brother sister i tell you god's word is real and true one tree gives us access to the new birth the other one brings death think of it the tree of life gives us access to the new birth which was the original birth by which we were supposed to be born by the spoken word as it was at the birth of jesus christ or choose the tree of knowledge where there's another kind of birth contrary to god's original plan but allowed by him since it is in the world oh friends i tell you friends if we eat from that tree of life your pre you're gonna eat from it if you're predestinated to eat from it hallelujah or praise god and then they'll try to all the bugs and everything else restoration of the bright tree will seek to eat and chew and smash and criticize and see everything against that tree but that tree my friends is not gonna die hallelujah because the inside of of them they're holding their the the predestinated word of god the sword seed of god is in them and they'll bring forth or be mad manifest in his season praise god and i'm close let me close with this thought when you get as high as you can get on knowledge now that tree of knowledge is all right i want you all to understand i'm speaking on the topic so that you may have a balanced clear full understanding brother branham myself i'm not speaking against knowledge or speaking against science it has its place it has its use for it is a tree of good and evil it's a tree where they will hit the truth the right but then they'll miss over here but with this tree of life it's always right it's always truth it's always revelation so when you get as high as you can on knowledge now as long as you can get there after that believe that's what you have to do after you can't figure it out any longer and don't know then only believe that's the time you must believe when you can't figure it out then open your heart i will come by faith hallelujah only believe only believe all things are possible only believe only believe only believe all things are possible only believe only believe my friends take in all the knowledge you can get take all the education that you can get but when you come to the end of your thoughts on anything don't fuss fret and fume about it go into the realm of faith and believe god and god will reveal it make it known show it to you bring it to pass and glorify his great name do you understand what i'm trying to say here hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah amen to those of you who are in school or at school remember paul had all of that but what paul was saying is not that he threw away his education but he said i i set it aside i counted down and ash that i might win christ revealed in his own word that might know him in the power of his resurrection and in the fellowship of his suffering may god forgive give us of our sins may god cleanse us from all the mistakes may god forgive us for a former life and let's say lord i lay my life before you lay my heart before you i commit myself to you wash me and cleanse me and make me your child let me know that i am your child that i can say i and my father are one he lives in me he lives in me the god of all heaven on earth he lives in me may god bless you my friends may you go with the grace of god and the holy spirit upon you father i pray you'll heal those that are sick right now in the name of jesus may healing virtue go forth may healing power go forth may saving power go forth may delivering power go forth in the name of jesus christ father as they reach out to you may the holy spirit reach out to them wherever they are in this world in their home in the hospital and make the so-called impossible possible for you are the god of possibilities and there is nothing impossible with you in the name of jesus christ so let it be done for thy glory for thy honor and let the testimonies come in of deliverance freedom raising up oh a jubilee for in jesus precious and holy name may god bless you my friends will come together again next wednesday and then we'll be here uh with the lord's supper on the 17th next sunday here solemnly reverently to partake of a lord's supper may god bless you [Music] you
