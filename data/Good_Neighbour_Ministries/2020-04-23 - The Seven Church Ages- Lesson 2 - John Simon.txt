TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends it's good to be in the house of the Lord I'm happy to be here in the middle of the week for our Bible studies let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father bless our Bible study tonight may this lesson be a blessing to every heart may every child of God receive the Word of God and rejoice and give him praise for this great day and for this hour we bless your Holy Name in Jesus wonderful and precious name Amen and amen well tonight I will continue in our introduction to this seven church ages this will be part two now I'm reading from Revelation chapter 1 verses 1 to 2 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who bare record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw and now I'll read another scripture out of the Gospel of Luke chapter 10 verse 21 in that hour Jesus joist in spirit and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight o praise be to God now in last week's study which we began the introduction to this marvelous book of Revelation I pointed to the fact that John was only an inspired scribe but Jesus Christ Himself was the author it is usually said and many times I've heard it where Pope have said to me odd men wrote the Bible it was just men that wrote that Bible right but we understand clearly that the Bible itself tells us that holy men of God wrote and spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit they were inspired so it was not men that actually wrote the Bible men were scribes of the Bible but it was God Himself who wrote a true inspired and surrendered men about himself and his own Word and future things that were to come now there's a beautiful song that I've always loved and it's a song that was sung by the country-western singer bill and country singer Bill Anderson and that song says I have the pencil but he wrote this song I can do nothing alone I held the pencil but he wrote this song I can do nothing alone I meant clear also the teaching on the importance of Revelation to the true believer and in doing so I indicated that I was and I'm now speaking not just about the book of Revelation itself but I'm speaking about the god-given gift of Revelation for unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom but unto them it is not given Oh under you it is given to know the mystery or the hidden things of God the hidden things of God but unto them it is not given it is not given to wise men it's not given to the theologians it's not given to the prudent but it is given to those that are like babes in other words those that are willing to learn God's holy spirit revealing reveals himself in simplicity and is recognized and known in the same way I'm speaking about the gift of revelation I'm speaking about individuals for people that God will give this faculty of Revelation in their soul that they would recognize his word well did he say my sheep hear my voice and the stranger the will not follow revelation the supernatural ability and capacity to recognize and receive revelation from the presence of Almighty God this is a the revelation I am talking about not about the just the book but to understand the book to receive the things that are written in the book to be blessed by the book as you read the book as we study the book we need this faculty this capacity this recognition of what God Spirit is doing in our spirit now we understand that this is also revelation can be also called this sixth sense the sixth sense where we go beyond our five senses and the sense of faith comes into action of course the word faith means a revelation it does not only mean to believe for before you can believe there must be something that you must believe in and that has to be revealed to you so grace is fates foundation God reveals himself to whose whomsoever He wills by his marvelous grace for he said to this very book of Revelation I all the keel David I open and no man shuts I shut and no man opens now I I just spoke to you saying a balla had this supernatural ability you'll find that in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 4 where it says Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice a better sacrifice than Cain oh how wonderful no Bible was written no scrolls were read but but by this of faculty disability God made known to him exactly what he was supposed to offer and what he was supposed to do so by faith by revelation if I knew what he was supposed to do he knew who he was who his brother was where he came from and who was his father blessed be the name of the Lord I emphasize to you that revelation is the key to truly understanding the entire Bible and every word that is in it now by telling this god-given gift of being able to read between the lines and to perceive or see the hidden meanings out of God's Word then friends there you will be the condition or a state where a brace where you have eyes of an open and a humble and surrendered heart to God and you will understand that if the Bible was given to men by inspiration and by revelation then it must be received by revelation it must be accepted by revelation it enters our hearts and our lives by revelation all glory be to God oh we saw how Satan hates this quality of Revelation he hates this ability to receive revelation and because it reveals his origins it reveals his shameful fall from the heights of glory and he was down let me use up a phrase that's a little clearer he was kicked out of heaven just as much as you as a true believer has the right to kick him out of your life kick him out in your consciousness kick him out of your affairs have faith in God only believe all things are possible to them that believe yes so he hates revelation because it reveals to you his original his shameful degradation it reveals still his works his awful terrible murdering lying destroying ways it makes clear to you all of his total defeat by Michael and all of the other angels who defeated him and cast him out of heaven with all of his lies and so he got the name the father of lies and came to earth with vengeance in his heart for all of God's people the whole human race as well as God's elected seed that is within the human race so he hates Revelation with a passion because it also shows his final destruction and the very end of his existence for he is not an eternal being he is not an all-knowing being he is a creature and so his final end is coming and he will totally be dissolved he will lose total existence along with all of his followers that follow in his footsteps acts after his actions and received him as their representative my dear brother my dear tonight you can clearly see why Satan hits all revelation you see this ability to receive revelation to disability to receive present troops and present truth exposes him and that is why Jesus said to Peter he said clearly to him thou wert simon simon barjona flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father in heaven has revealed this unto you and upon this rock will I build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it Jesus has built his church on the rock-solid foundation of the revelation of himself who is the word no that is that is something that must be meditated upon think upon these things let the Holy Spirit make clear to you his word here tonight all Satan hates revelation but we true believers we love it with all our hearts now we see in the church age book page of 15 listen no Satan hits this book of revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he hates revelation he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not he knows Satan knows that a whole lot more than doom than 90% of the theologians listen he is a being that was in the presence of Almighty God worshipping up there and was kicked out and has so many thousands of years of distance and then a theologian will go to a school for you know five years 10 years 20 years whether he studied for 25 or 50 years of his entire life and hopes to compete against a Satan in in this type of situation condition the world conditions that we are in the only person that can defeat him decisively and cast him out the only person that can overcome him is Jesus Christ was already defeated him rose up in power and said I am the resurrection and the life in another place he said I have overcome the world all thanks be to God and we overcome the world by he that has already overcome living within our hearts glory be to his marvelous and blessed name Satan knows that the original church with the power of God is the is a blueprint for all of God's body all of his body that is a blueprint for his church but man has changed that blueprint and made at every other church body shape form organization system what however you want to term it they have changed it and split it up into parts now my brothers and sisters Satan knows that when the truth church begins to recognize that are and who she is then we know that he's in real deep trouble because the Holy Spirit working through the church will bring him to account of the Word of God now the book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist spirit will come into the church the violent if you file it and would do everything to destroy God's people and so he fights no of God in every possible way that's what he does that's what his job is to continue to fight the Word of God but we are here standing by the side of the word of God and we stand with the word he knows what the true church should be he knows what kind of character she should have he's fully aware of what works the greater works that the church is supposed to perform under the power of the Holy Ghost under the presence of Jesus Christ living within her life he is aware fully of the church what action she and she should have what kind of a life that she should live yes sir and he is aware of this ability to receive revelation how it exposes him it exposes all of his attempts to destroy the true church God's people it shows and reveals and exposes his constant attacks discrediting the Word of God but belittling the Word of God and by making fun of the word of God and trivializing the Word of God this happens all the time you see it sometimes on TV or you hear it on the news yeah as the Bible already predicted thousands of years ago how that there will come in the end there will come puffers there will come a curse who will say where is the promise of his coming where is this promise of this rapture what about this resurrection you're talking about what of this judgment you're talking about they'll say oh there's no such a thing oh yeah you're just just religious but we are not just being religious we recognize that day the message and they are in which we are living in and we know we are living in the shadows of a coming god we know we're living in the shadow of the coming of our Lord to catch his waiting bright away Satan is furious because of this exposure this revelation of all his works from Eden to this time and into the things that are going to be he is fully aware that we are conscious those who are regulated by the Word of God are conscious of him and can anticipate his works and his actions and the end of the defeat him and destroy him in everything that he tries to do Satan knows that if the people get the true revelation and God anoints them and they become a church anointed by revelation present truth by Jesus Christ himself in the present stage of his ministry that kind of a church will be an invincible army that he cannot defeat he cannot prevail against her in any way yes sir when that church when this church in this day this people this bright this bunch of Revelation believers wherever they are scattered wherever they are some are still in denominations they haven't recognized themselves they haven't recognized their position in Christ some learn various countries of the world speaking different languages but one language they speak is the language of truth the language of revelation the language of opening of the word and the empowering of the Holy Spirit and when the last date church is anointed by this word of God that to be open unto us then we find out when she recognizes realizes what God is doing when she recognizes the importance of the placing and the use of Revelation and that she is of the continuation of the book of Acts then her walk her talk her very the very actions will produced such a vindication that the world will recognized that these are a different people anointed by the pure hand of God and the Spirit of God fools true her for she is just a vessel for his glory and for his honor when that church begins to recognize what she is and who she is that she is a part of the word she is a part of the body of Jesus Christ and that she is him now being revealed Christ is the mystery now being revealed oh thanks be to God that Christ is revealing himself in his own word and that those who have eyes to see and ears ears to hear hear the work of the Lord and recognize your day and a message for your day thanks be to God when that church begins to recognize the word she should be what she should be standing for then she'll drop all her treats she'll drop off her spotty garments of all kinds of litanies and fundamentals and standards and practices of man and the systems of and spotty unclean perverted doctrines given through the centuries and using that to be credibility because yeah it's been around for so many years it's become when allies told over and over again after a while masses of people begin to believe it as truth but the true believer can cut through the veneer of lies and cut to the bone and be able by Hebrews 4:12 the Word of God is a discerner and it's even discern between truth and error lies and truth the Spirit of God in the believer is capable of doing that know what I'm speaking about here the church then we begin to understand what she is capable of she will begin to understand her potential her capacity and her power that Satan cannot withstand now there's a story in the Bible which is the story of Samson I'm sure many of you are aware of the story of Samson and there was one turning when the Philistine army went out to capture Samson just as much as all the demons of all past ages have accumulated in this last day called the division age and the accumulation of demon power is now coming like a flood and gets the Church of the Living God even so these overwhelming forces of over a thousand Philistines came against Samson and Samson had to fight against them and looking around for a weapon he found on the ground the jawbone of an asked that that ass had died and the jawbone was rotten one touch from him it would fall apart but here with the anointing of the Holy Spirit came upon Samson and Samson picked up that jaw bone oven ass and begin to smite the Philistines with the power of Almighty God in him and it's recorded in Scripture on that day that Samson one man destroyed one thousand Philistines with God's help with God's power with God's Spirit with God's anointing upon him he destroyed a thousand Philistines that day a thousand Philistines and let me emphasize Philistine warriors these were not farmers they were different ladies and gentlemen these are not powder puffs these were northern and veteran warriors coming against Samson and Samson came against them with this dry brittle jaw bone of an ass that was laying on the desert floor for years and years big data and the Spirit of God so anointed him it flowed into that jaw bone of an ass and he smoked and slew one thousand Philistines of course that was only a type and a shadow but what God's anointed church what do and should do in this age and in this hour the words of the Bible as I've spoken before have become dry and dead true the dark ages of the church and to a great that steps till drive in its dump given the national habit there it is dry brittle oh my friends that dry bone was like that but thanks be to God that brittle that does that not jump off that was back then which I am assuring to you was the Word of God through the ages that land there within these Muslims of call the church is called denominations called sanctuaries called whatever names that they were given dried up and dead oh we see in their in their activities of mysticism monasticism and finally in our day a whole host of denominationalism they have made the Word of God dry and brittle in the eyes of the people but oh how the Word of God comes alive in the hands of fate faint of courses of Revelation in the hands of one anointed but faith in the hands of a church anointed with acts 2:38 acts 2:4 x1a anointed by the Holy Spirit and when they take that word of God in the hands of Revelation oh oh praise God then that true church that was once blinded and has caught the relations of the last prophets message that does the invincible church once not dry brittle bone now becomes a supernatural weapon in the hand of faith of such a church that church will be able by having one of their believers will be able to destroy and chase 1,000 demons and two of them together will chase 2,000 disbelieving theological demons of hell away from the of God yes Satan hits Revelation but thanks be to God we love it he hates it but we love it for Revelation is supernatural and he can't get it for God reveals to whomsoever He wills for unto you it is given it's a gift it's given to know to know the mystery the hidden things of God but unto them it is not given Oh blessed be the name of the Lord revelation friends helps us to understand and discern between good and evil what is good and what is evil and makes plain to us the hidden things of God that was hidden for ages and for dispensation as Paul said Oh glory to his marvelous wonderful name by the use of this supernatural weapon oh thank god this weapon of Revelation we are able to stun and see Satan's activities too Anto sense his presence we also were able to recognize his when the truth his spirit right recognize two spirits working within the framework of the Church of the Living God now as Cain and Abel were born in the womb of King there were twins and they were in the womb of Eve together so are twins within the body of the modern day Church twins in the beginning twins in the end but the Spirit of the Living God is here to discern the Lord's body the Spirit of God is here to create the situation operation from unbelief and for the believer to recognize oh praise God so these two spirits are at work within the church body in this last night one God one of Satan twins in the beginning and here come the twins again in the end all children of God wherever you are this is the art of the manifestation of the certified seed sons and daughters of the Living God oh come and go with me tonight to my father's house where there is joy and peace oh there is love and grace and fellowship enjoy an understanding and light for me a children of the light we do not walk in darkness but the people who sentence spiritual ignorance on darkness have seen a great light and are walking in that light today oh the evening lights of common is a fact that God and Christ are one Oh Lord of God come my brothers my sisters across the world across the nation wherever you are come and enter with me into this glorious Liberty of the manifestations of the sons and daughters of God truly truly Satan hates the light of Revelation but we love it we love it and we love it because it empowers us to discern him it empowers us to discern his Antichrist spirit he may be did you know that Satan is a religious being lots of people will say oh there is no god but Satan is religious enough to know right that there is a God and that's why he trembles for his end is at hand so the Spirit of God in the true believer is able to deserve by the word by spiritual gifts by anointing that various means Satan his activities his works his presence his actions in this religious operating in a religious realm with his religious enticing spirits and seducing spirits blinding and deceiving and misleading the minds and the hearts of men all thanks be to God for the lesser the holy spirit of truth that John the Apostle speaks of how that when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth and show you things to come we love revelation don't you I love revelations because Satan and his cronies all his followers all his imps become powerless and paralyzed under the bright revealing spotlight of God's Word being made manifested oh thanks be to God we love revelation I love revelation because it causes us to be able to checkmate Satan checkmate his evil moves whether with the word whether in the church body or whether in life we are able to recognize his activities his movements and to checkmate him and to stop unlock his evil moves and what all of his plans that he planned meticulously and yet we we we water in and out of them we walk in the fiery walk out of the fire and none of our clothing none of our being is burned or smoky or worldly or touched by him Oh blessed be the name of the Lord we are able by this facility to be a to uncover all his schemes on all of his manipulations and the strategies we are able to recognize his undermining of the kingdom of God and rebuke him in the name of Jesus Christ saying the Lord rebuke thee in Jesus name we love revelation hallelujah because with revelation we're ever seen heavenly sunshine heavenly sunshine loving my soul with glory divine heavenly sunshine heavily sunshine hallelujah Jesus is mine hallelujah and with that sunshine of God's words shining in our hearts Satan can not prevail against us that gates of Hell shall not prevail against us and by overcoming and prevailing against them the deathless of Hell all night we overcome them by the Word of God revealed Word of God by our revelation lives hallelujah and by their testimony are vindicated testimony overcoming power is what we need today may God help every one of us today to receive God's overcoming power in our lives and to live with the knowledge the sense the confidence the boldness in the midst of all this virus this evil scene that has invaded the world mirror counter acting viral action of the Word of God spread and multiply by the pitching of the word man find a resting place within your heart
