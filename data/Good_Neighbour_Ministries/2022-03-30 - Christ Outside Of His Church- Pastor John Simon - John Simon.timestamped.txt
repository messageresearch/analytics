[11:30] is
[11:32] [Music]
[11:59] [Music]
[12:08] [Music]
[12:24] inspired us
[12:28] [Music]
[12:38] amen
[12:41] i believe that
[12:43] i believe enlightens god is here
[12:46] i believe the age
[12:49] uh the seventh church age
[12:52] and
[12:53] to its end has come to its end
[12:56] and god is
[12:59] doing a great work
[13:01] in building
[13:03] uh his body and finishing his bride
[13:08] as the harvest ripens
[13:10] for the going home
[13:12] so you must understand
[13:16] that
[13:17] what we had in our minds
[13:21] as
[13:22] this is the way to carry on church
[13:25] or that is the way to carry on church
[13:29] those were cultures religious cultures
[13:33] pictures
[13:35] given to us by the denominations
[13:38] and by the spirit of the system
[13:41] so god is now changing us
[13:45] in our way of thinking
[13:47] and our way of worship and everything
[13:50] so
[13:51] things are going to be totally different
[13:54] not what i am going to do changes i am
[13:57] going to make
[13:58] but god is making
[14:00] changes
[14:02] and what it'll flow into i don't know
[14:05] but it's flowing right now so be
[14:08] conscious of what god is doing and relax
[14:12] don't
[14:13] try to put on makeup or do anything just
[14:16] be who you are
[14:19] right and let the holy spirit have his
[14:21] way praise the lord
[14:23] well
[14:24] do you have a bible close to you
[14:26] although they they project the
[14:28] scriptures up theirs but if you do have
[14:30] a bible wit you will be nice because
[14:34] it'll be great for us
[14:36] i'm glad to see you here in the house of
[14:39] god
[14:40] tonight our topic will be christ
[14:44] outside
[14:46] of his church
[14:49] christ outside his church
[14:53] and our scripture is revelation chapter
[14:56] 3.
[14:59] verses 20 to 22.
[15:02] let's read from god's word
[15:09] it says here
[15:11] behold
[15:13] i stand at the door and knock
[15:18] if
[15:18] any man hear me my voice
[15:22] and open the door
[15:24] i will come in to him
[15:27] and i will sup with him
[15:30] and he with me
[15:32] praise god
[15:34] father thank you again
[15:36] for the reading of your word
[15:39] and bless
[15:40] us tonight
[15:42] as we think upon these things
[15:44] we ask it in the name of jesus christ
[15:47] amen and amen the lord bless you please
[15:50] be seated
[15:55] what a picture
[15:58] what a a very tragic
[16:01] and revealing picture
[16:04] of christ outside of his church i don't
[16:07] know if any of you ever seen of course
[16:09] there's artists have painted
[16:12] many pictures like that
[16:15] of jesus standing outside the door and
[16:18] knocking on the door trying to go in
[16:21] well
[16:22] that might not be the correct conception
[16:25] but
[16:26] the idea
[16:27] right that he's knocking on the door to
[16:30] come in
[16:32] just to think that
[16:34] it's tragic especially now that we've
[16:36] got the revelation
[16:38] that we can clearly see
[16:40] the unrecognized presence of god
[16:44] they
[16:45] when we look at that picture to see him
[16:49] outside of his house
[16:52] outside of his church
[16:54] like that
[16:55] we we see another picture here of the
[16:59] rejected king
[17:01] just as david was rejected by his own
[17:05] here he is
[17:07] rejected
[17:09] now
[17:10] while we're talking remember think of
[17:13] christ outside of his church
[17:16] as the word
[17:19] outside of the church
[17:22] the truth outside of the church
[17:26] right
[17:27] this is what we have come to in the
[17:30] laodicean church age
[17:32] for the word of god
[17:35] that they're supposed to be worshipping
[17:39] becomes the fulfillment of
[17:42] the scripture
[17:44] they honor me with their lips
[17:47] but they have no revelation
[17:49] so their hearts are far from me
[17:52] so in actual fact all the worshiping is
[17:55] going on all this stuff is going on
[17:58] but uh
[17:59] the word of god itself is outside of the
[18:03] church
[18:05] it's not there
[18:07] the rejected king
[18:09] and they have him outside also because
[18:11] they're ashamed of him
[18:14] they're ashamed of him the the things we
[18:17] talk about so normally and casually
[18:21] they will be ashamed to speak of such
[18:24] things
[18:25] they wouldn't want to speak about
[18:28] the garden of eden they can't even start
[18:30] from the beginning to start to unveil
[18:33] the word of god they don't want to talk
[18:35] about that they don't want to talk about
[18:37] the godhead it exposes them they don't
[18:40] want you see you go down
[18:42] and it's an exposure so they don't want
[18:45] to talk about those things
[18:47] amen
[18:49] look at this
[18:50] terrible
[18:52] picture
[18:54] of christ outside of his own
[18:59] church
[19:00] now
[19:01] is this a stranger
[19:03] that's why you don't open the door
[19:06] is it someone that you're unfamiliar
[19:09] with
[19:10] or is it some some body that come by to
[19:14] visit your house
[19:16] but
[19:17] you don't want them to come in
[19:19] because they can cause you a whole lot
[19:22] of trouble so you shut the door and pull
[19:25] the blinds and you keep quiet in the
[19:27] house so that they'll go away
[19:30] is this what they have done to him
[19:32] christ jesus the word of god in this
[19:35] hour
[19:36] so is this a stranger knocking on the
[19:40] door
[19:41] or
[19:42] are they afraid that this is a robber
[19:46] that has come in the middle of the night
[19:49] because this is the odyssey and so
[19:52] uh
[19:53] less scared because a robber has come
[19:57] like that but they don't know the real
[19:59] robbers in the house that's why he is
[20:02] outside the house
[20:03] now
[20:04] here it
[20:05] it's the truth amen praise god
[20:10] or
[20:11] is it the good man of the house
[20:15] come to the householder
[20:17] he has come to his own house
[20:21] and he's locked out
[20:24] he is put out he's unwanted
[20:27] my goodness
[20:29] i want you to see friends
[20:32] john chapter 1
[20:34] where the bible tells us matter of fact
[20:37] why don't we just john 1 10 to 12. can
[20:42] you put that up if you can place it up
[20:44] there brother and we'll read it together
[20:46] if you don't mind
[20:51] hallelujah
[20:57] he was in the world
[20:59] and the world was made by him
[21:03] and the world knew him not
[21:06] amen
[21:09] he came
[21:10] unto his own
[21:12] and his own received him
[21:14] not but as many as received him to them
[21:19] gave he the power
[21:21] to become the sons of god
[21:23] even to them that believe
[21:26] on his name praise god hallelujah
[21:30] now he came to his own
[21:33] and they received him not you already
[21:36] see where the truth is winding from then
[21:39] to now
[21:41] they received him not so he goes back to
[21:44] the door knocking at the end of the age
[21:46] they received him not
[21:48] they don't want him they don't want to
[21:50] receive the word of god
[21:52] that was sent to them praise god back
[21:56] then of course he was in flesh now he is
[21:59] back in the word form
[22:01] and they don't recognize that change
[22:04] that transformation
[22:06] which means they had no revelation
[22:09] because you recognize the word and
[22:11] whatever form it comes to you
[22:14] once your eyes of your heart has been
[22:16] opened towards him
[22:18] amen and what he is doing you'll see god
[22:21] you'll recognize what god
[22:24] is doing listen
[22:26] to
[22:27] this messenger for our age brother
[22:30] branham
[22:31] now there was a great deal of confusion
[22:34] over this verse
[22:36] because
[22:37] there were so many
[22:41] personal workers
[22:43] who used this
[22:45] in personal evangelism
[22:48] as lord jesus
[22:50] were at the heart's door
[22:53] of every sinner
[22:56] and knocking for admission
[23:00] it would then be said
[23:02] that if the sinner opened the door
[23:05] the lord would come in
[23:09] the whole message
[23:12] has
[23:13] a is a consummation to this age
[23:17] for he was he was not speaking to
[23:20] individual sinners
[23:23] for verse 22 says i'm still quoting
[23:26] he that had an ear to hear
[23:30] let him hear what the spirit saith or is
[23:33] saying on to the churches
[23:37] so it's the church that he's talking to
[23:41] and and saying you've closed your doors
[23:44] against me
[23:45] you don't want to receive me
[23:48] and now at the end of these church ages
[23:51] we'll come to the last one
[23:53] i'll be there still knocking on the door
[23:58] he's been knocking all through the edges
[24:00] but now he'll be knocking on the door
[24:03] giving you a last chance to open the
[24:06] door and to let him in and still they
[24:10] have the door shut and they will not let
[24:14] him in
[24:15] now in this i perceive that there is
[24:20] uh misinterpretations
[24:22] of the word
[24:24] given out
[24:25] because
[24:26] if that saying
[24:28] that this
[24:30] is uh speaking to the individual sinner
[24:34] and not
[24:36] about the church
[24:38] i want you understand that right here
[24:40] you can see the strategy of satan
[24:45] because it's partially true
[24:48] that he's speaking to the individual
[24:50] sinner
[24:51] but that is not the
[24:53] that is not the overall truth of what
[24:56] he's addressing at this point in time
[24:59] he is speaking to his church
[25:02] now what is a lie
[25:04] brother branham made it clear a lie is
[25:07] not a complete
[25:09] falsehood where you can tell someone
[25:13] well uh
[25:14] you know really that plane that's
[25:17] passing is not really a plane
[25:20] do you know that that's a certain kind
[25:22] of bird
[25:25] where i see you laugh because now
[25:28] that
[25:29] that
[25:30] you see nobody will why would they tell
[25:32] a lie like that
[25:33] right
[25:35] but
[25:35] you see brother branham said a lie a
[25:38] relay is always mixed with a little bit
[25:42] of truth just enough to cause you to
[25:44] believe
[25:46] it's always mixed with a tincture of
[25:49] truth that brings an element of doubt
[25:52] that cause you to believe
[25:54] so
[25:55] what satan did
[25:57] is take the literal word of him when
[26:00] he's speaking in this verse
[26:03] if any man
[26:05] hear my voice
[26:08] and open the door i will come into him
[26:11] will suck with him and he with me
[26:14] amen see
[26:16] he took that
[26:18] and the lie he's telling now is the lie
[26:21] of destruction
[26:24] because he distracted the people's
[26:27] thought processes
[26:29] from thinking about the whole
[26:31] body of christ the whole church
[26:34] to thinking about themselves as
[26:38] individuals
[26:39] and when they do that that's partial
[26:42] truth
[26:43] especially it's not a lie special truth
[26:46] just like he said um you know uh you
[26:49] know
[26:50] you can turn those stones to bread
[26:53] it's the truth isn't it but it was a
[26:55] temptation it said oh if you throw
[26:57] yourself off the mountain the angels
[26:59] will come and be it's the truth but it's
[27:02] only partial truth
[27:04] you know it's not it's just like god
[27:06] says if thou drink us any deadly thing
[27:08] it shall not hurt thee so brother grab a
[27:11] bottle of poison
[27:14] no
[27:14] see when you go deliberately doing that
[27:17] you were not commanded you were not
[27:19] ordered the spirit didn't lead you to do
[27:21] that you're not in a a process of of of
[27:25] work for the lord and then you found
[27:27] that somebody tried to poison you so god
[27:30] defends you that's a different thing
[27:33] so that's always certain strategy from
[27:37] the very beginning of mixing a little
[27:40] truth with error
[27:42] to defile to deceive to distract
[27:46] to cause you to doubt in every possible
[27:48] way is what he normally does
[27:53] so you got a ball of truth a dish of
[27:56] truth and he gives you a dash
[27:59] of misdirection
[28:01] mix that whole thing and you partake of
[28:04] it you're a million miles off
[28:06] because you fail to recognize that
[28:09] little dash of truth that he placed
[28:12] inside of there
[28:14] oh my praise god all he wants to do is
[28:18] put a little bit of theological
[28:20] misinterpretation
[28:22] and he unbalances that person beyond
[28:25] anything but the basic truth is this
[28:29] verse
[28:30] is intended for the body of christ for
[28:34] the church
[28:36] and this picture is showing us a picture
[28:40] of the church in the last day this
[28:43] edition church age has come to the place
[28:46] of apostasy
[28:49] where they have
[28:51] as second first thessalonians says
[28:55] falling away for they shall come of
[28:58] falling away first
[29:00] falling away from what what you're going
[29:03] to fall away from the word
[29:05] amen
[29:07] repent go back to where you you fall
[29:10] from amen praise god where did they fall
[29:13] from the word
[29:14] praise god so god is saying to them
[29:19] that this church as it nears the end
[29:23] praise god don't let satan deceive you
[29:26] that this is just about one individual
[29:29] person this is not about one individual
[29:32] person though it can be applied that way
[29:34] this is for the entire church of god
[29:39] hallelujah
[29:40] now he doesn't you know god doesn't
[29:43] explain nothing he just makes a
[29:44] statement and that's a the holy spirit
[29:47] will then break it to you just say
[29:49] something just say one word amen praise
[29:52] god and the holy spirit then opens it up
[29:55] so in there when you look at that
[29:57] scripture he's already seen you can tell
[30:00] now
[30:01] that he can see the effects of the evil
[30:05] and the poison of of denomination
[30:08] organization
[30:10] and systems of what they're going to do
[30:12] they're going to push out the truth of
[30:15] of god's word completely
[30:18] why because satan is trying to
[30:21] accomplish
[30:22] what he did in heaven
[30:24] he's trying to accomplish here on the
[30:26] earth
[30:28] he tried to undermine god's kingdom up
[30:30] there
[30:31] he's trying to undermine the truth down
[30:33] here
[30:34] he's trying to support the kingdom up
[30:36] there
[30:37] whisper campaign and propaganda among
[30:40] the angels first and then he was ready
[30:43] to move michael
[30:45] just first of all
[30:46] how foolish
[30:49] you're dealing with the creator and you
[30:51] think you're going to do something that
[30:53] he don't know about when he's omniscient
[30:56] omnipresent and everywhere this just
[30:59] shows you
[31:00] how he's so intelligent and smart on one
[31:03] hand like einstein but so dumb he
[31:07] doesn't know how to pull up his socks
[31:09] right so it goes that way
[31:12] now here we come and we understand that
[31:16] this tells you
[31:18] that he is outside of the church hebrews
[31:23] chapter 13
[31:25] verses 12
[31:27] and 14.
[31:32] praise god
[31:35] hebrews 13
[31:38] 12
[31:39] to 14.
[31:46] wherefore
[31:48] jesus also
[31:50] that he might sanctify the people with
[31:53] his own blood
[31:56] suffered
[31:57] without the gate
[31:59] outside of the church
[32:01] there's in hebrews already it's telling
[32:03] you he suffered outside the gate now of
[32:06] course you know there's types through
[32:07] the bible right on to calvary outside of
[32:10] jerusalem on golgotha's hill and so on
[32:13] it's always the case but so suffer
[32:15] outside the gate and there it was that
[32:19] he might cleanse his people
[32:21] let us
[32:22] go forth therefore come out the church
[32:26] come out the organization come out the
[32:28] system let us go forth therefore unto
[32:33] him the word
[32:35] praise god without the camp
[32:38] bearing the reproach praise god
[32:41] hallelujah because they already have
[32:44] their systems all set up and then you
[32:47] are going to tell them there is
[32:49] something else out there different from
[32:51] what we have bigger and better
[32:54] and you know it's the truth but who are
[32:56] you you're not a theologian how can you
[32:58] tell us who are trained men that have
[33:01] the knowledge of theologians that have
[33:05] added added books and books and
[33:07] knowledge for hundreds of years and you
[33:10] just come and tell us you got the truth
[33:13] you heard the truth and you believe the
[33:15] truth and you're leaving the church
[33:18] you see it's like a a paradox to them
[33:21] right so
[33:23] think of the scripture telling you here
[33:26] let us go forth therefore
[33:29] unto him
[33:31] without the camp
[33:33] outside the camp
[33:35] bearing his reproach
[33:38] for here
[33:40] we have no continuing city
[33:44] but we seek one to come oh thanks be to
[33:47] god
[33:48] here we have no continuing city
[33:51] all the great cities
[33:53] i was
[33:54] looking online and seeing many many
[33:57] great cities covered in ash covered in
[34:00] sand
[34:01] you call them names
[34:03] they're digging them out now pompeii
[34:06] whether it's over in egypt they're
[34:08] digging out the artifacts and cities
[34:11] that were great mighty cities in those
[34:13] days amen there were metropolises ah
[34:17] when i used to read of those things well
[34:19] a city back then will have maybe five
[34:21] ten thousand people no i stood on a
[34:24] mountain in italy and watched uh
[34:26] pompeii it extended for miles i couldn't
[34:30] even see the end it was like to the
[34:32] horizon so it there's millions of people
[34:34] in that city they already have so we
[34:36] think oh we got new york we got this we
[34:39] got oh they had it already
[34:42] it maybe didn't look like this
[34:44] but they already had it there is nothing
[34:46] new under the sun
[34:49] think about it my goodness
[34:52] i saw they had pipes
[34:54] made of lead or some kind of
[34:57] metal but they had pipes they had indoor
[35:00] toilets they had all those things the
[35:02] romans had that already so we got
[35:05] nothing new under the sun whatsoever so
[35:08] we can trust him this time
[35:11] this thought
[35:13] you can also expand on it so when jesus
[35:17] called the believer where he's calling
[35:20] the people right now
[35:22] peter
[35:23] if you believe me who i say i am step
[35:27] out of that
[35:28] ship
[35:29] that you're in
[35:31] just step out
[35:32] walk on the word
[35:33] walk walk on the water and that's going
[35:36] to show you your real faith do you
[35:38] believe this word you believe the
[35:40] promise
[35:42] do you have a quiet faith in this
[35:44] promise of this prophet
[35:47] amen what a message i'm so happy for
[35:49] this message
[35:51] we don't have to be like baal's prophets
[35:54] we don't have to like the prophet said
[35:56] you don't have to bang and to bring him
[35:59] down
[36:00] you don't have to scream the
[36:02] loudness and jump as high as you can he
[36:05] said
[36:06] you better live as high as you're
[36:08] jumping or live higher than you're
[36:10] jumping amen you see we don't have to do
[36:12] that praise god but when the holy spirit
[36:16] hits your soul you want to rejoice
[36:19] you yourself don't know how you're going
[36:20] to rejoice one time you might rejoice by
[36:23] laughing the next time you might be
[36:24] crying the next night me running might
[36:26] be jumping it might be throwing your
[36:28] hands up suddenly you don't know what
[36:30] your reaction is going to be but you are
[36:32] going to rejoice when you see the word
[36:34] of god
[36:36] hallelujah praise be to god amen
[36:40] yes
[36:42] jesus christ
[36:44] left out of the church
[36:46] amen
[36:47] hallelujah amen why because they took
[36:52] the creed
[36:54] instead of christ
[36:57] is that right
[36:58] they took creeds instead of jesus christ
[37:01] and wrapped themselves up and tangled
[37:04] themselves up in all those lines uh like
[37:06] that and uh uh instead
[37:10] of the holy spirit
[37:12] uh amen
[37:15] there's an there's a saying that said
[37:18] that era
[37:21] lies
[37:22] have taken the throne
[37:24] and they throw uh
[37:26] pushed the truth off
[37:28] i'm not giving the exact quotes but i
[37:30] but i've heard that them saying it in
[37:33] this modern time but that's the very
[37:35] fact that uh the holy spirit has been
[37:38] deposed
[37:40] so that popes can be enthroned
[37:44] is that right
[37:45] the holy spirit they put him out of the
[37:49] leadership of their lives
[37:52] and they brought themselves under the
[37:54] leadership of popes administrators
[37:57] supervisors bishops bishoprics and
[38:00] whatever else systems of organization
[38:04] because the people
[38:05] love the discipline of systems
[38:11] do you know that that's how this world
[38:13] has been acculturated and trained
[38:16] is to accept systems because everything
[38:18] is predictable
[38:20] once you come out the system it's not
[38:22] predictable and they don't like that
[38:25] you find that even now you got the
[38:27] internet they have it all set up you got
[38:29] to go according to these lines if all of
[38:32] a sudden said no i i don't really want
[38:35] uh google because they're looking into
[38:37] all my stuff and you cut through trying
[38:39] to put it off your phone or your your
[38:41] tablet and you see what's going to
[38:42] happen with you how your stuff will
[38:44] start mess up and stuff it doesn't
[38:46] matter whether it's microsoft google or
[38:48] apple or whoever it is then all of a
[38:50] sudden your stuff isn't working the way
[38:52] it's supposed to work right because you
[38:55] are now
[38:57] uh getting outside the system and once
[39:00] you get out the system they don't know
[39:04] what you are doing
[39:06] and they don't know what you can do
[39:09] right and it gets them nervous
[39:12] they want you to remain within the
[39:14] confines of that system so that you can
[39:17] become predictable
[39:19] but sons and daughters of god are not
[39:22] predictable
[39:24] for sons and daughters as the wind lord
[39:27] where it lists them no man knows where
[39:30] it goes so the sons of god and daughters
[39:32] of god that's the way they are
[39:35] and that's how the holy spirit places it
[39:37] in their heart amen
[39:39] remember elijah going to the king and
[39:42] god told him go to him
[39:44] and tell him
[39:45] that um
[39:47] you know make your will make up your
[39:50] will and
[39:51] make things right because you're going
[39:52] to sleep with your fathers
[39:54] and you know the story of hezekiah how
[39:56] he went to god and he prayed and he
[39:59] cried and he called him god god to give
[40:01] him 21 more years and brother branham
[40:04] said he did get it
[40:06] but he messed up all the good things he
[40:08] did for the first part of his reign and
[40:11] minister of his life but anyhow he got
[40:14] it so elijah prophesy
[40:16] you're gonna die so
[40:18] prepare yourself and he started walking
[40:21] home and when he's when the holy spirit
[40:24] said turn back
[40:25] and go back and tell him he's not going
[40:28] to die he's going to live
[40:31] amen praise god hallelujah and the
[40:34] prophet was arguing with god said but
[40:36] how am i going to look
[40:38] because i just tell him he gonna die
[40:42] you send me back to the same man to tell
[40:45] him he's going to live
[40:47] god says it's it's you you worrying
[40:50] about you
[40:51] i am the one telling you go back and
[40:53] tell him he's going to live
[40:55] and that's many times that's how we get
[40:57] ourselves preachers and people we get
[41:00] ourselves or how we are going to look if
[41:02] we say certain things god's interested
[41:05] in how you gonna look and you've got to
[41:07] be willing to die to yourself how you're
[41:09] going to look whether you look like a
[41:11] fool whether you look this is that you
[41:13] only want to stay with the world
[41:16] [Music]
[41:17] and so
[41:19] we see this situation here
[41:22] where they set aside jesus christ the
[41:26] savior and they set him aside uh
[41:30] for works
[41:32] and programs
[41:33] that prefer
[41:35] to have all kinds of church joining
[41:38] and uh church uh uh conformity to the
[41:42] system i was talking about this
[41:44] discipline
[41:46] and this oneness that uh satan
[41:49] regimentation of of of
[41:51] denominations and of systems this is
[41:55] satan's plan this is how he works even
[41:58] in the realm of natural realm of war and
[42:01] warfare which he created because he
[42:03] started up with war in heaven and when
[42:06] he comes to art he got into nimrod and
[42:08] began to teach him as brother vin has
[42:11] preached on this subject big subject the
[42:14] arts of war were what were inspired the
[42:17] evil arts of war nimrod got inspired
[42:20] with how to make weapons and how to make
[42:23] this and make that and make the other
[42:25] and how to discipline
[42:28] men into an army
[42:30] and because he was the first one of
[42:32] course he began to take over all the
[42:34] whole country and that's how come they
[42:37] start to uh want to build bay bell and
[42:40] things like that but watch that always
[42:43] now i'm not telling you to go rebelling
[42:46] against systems
[42:49] because we are in it right now
[42:51] but you need to recognize who you are
[42:55] you work with the system and in the
[42:58] system as far as you can go
[43:00] right
[43:02] and god didn't say you uh are gonna just
[43:05] uh make yourself
[43:07] a rebel or something but the system
[43:10] itself the shock itself is going to push
[43:12] you out
[43:14] because you are you're going to be
[43:16] oddball
[43:18] you're not going to be a fit
[43:20] for the what their their plans are right
[43:23] the the the bride doesn't fit into the
[43:26] plans of the world council of churches
[43:32] she doesn't ah she doesn't have to ask
[43:34] them
[43:35] to put her out you don't she doesn't
[43:38] need to walk out they're going to push
[43:41] you out
[43:42] that's the way it is
[43:44] all right so praise god
[43:47] what more can they do against them over
[43:50] so many centuries
[43:52] they don't understand
[43:54] that uh in the book of genesis it tells
[43:57] us
[43:58] how that
[44:01] noah
[44:02] stood in the ark lord preaching the word
[44:06] after he warned the people do you know
[44:08] that god kept the art door open even
[44:11] after the animal's gone and his family
[44:13] gone in the door is just waiting now to
[44:17] be shut
[44:18] but it's still open for a little while
[44:20] and noah kept preaching
[44:23] in that ark door
[44:25] all the time crying out to them the
[44:28] bible puts it this way and god gave them
[44:31] a space to repent
[44:33] but they did not right and i believe
[44:37] that
[44:38] in our day it wasn't just one day but
[44:42] just that all through these years they
[44:46] get a space to repent turn around change
[44:49] your ways change what you're doing come
[44:52] back to the word the spirit crying out
[44:54] calling out justifying telling preaching
[44:58] through these apostles and men of god
[45:00] trying to bring them back to the
[45:02] original way but they will not come back
[45:05] to the word the way god wants them to do
[45:09] that amen praise god and this is what
[45:12] the bible calls the falling away there
[45:14] shall come of falling away first
[45:18] is that right
[45:20] revelation remember from whence the word
[45:23] fallen
[45:24] and go back to where you felt from
[45:26] hallelujah praise god oh my wow i i
[45:32] really see this brother it's really
[45:35] clear brother branham says here
[45:38] don't you see
[45:39] this is the falling away
[45:42] this is the apostasy
[45:44] of the last day
[45:47] amen
[45:48] and when they do this
[45:51] this
[45:53] is now the open door
[45:56] for the antichrist to come in amen you
[45:59] see you turn away from the the truth of
[46:03] the word you put the word out of your
[46:05] life
[46:06] and you open the door automatically you
[46:09] open the door
[46:11] for the devil the antichrist
[46:13] to come into your life
[46:15] once you put the word aside
[46:18] amen
[46:19] okay
[46:20] praise god
[46:21] for if you reject
[46:24] me
[46:26] when i come in my father's name and was
[46:29] not received
[46:30] then another will come to you in his own
[46:33] name the same principle jesus said it
[46:36] when an evil spirit is cast out from a
[46:38] man
[46:40] it doesn't just go away like that it
[46:42] goes yes of course it's not there on the
[46:44] man but jesus said it circles
[46:48] and keeps coming back
[46:50] to see if that man's fate weakened or
[46:53] that man wants that habit what man wants
[46:57] that sickness that man wants that
[46:59] condition back again and
[47:02] if he opens the door jesus said that
[47:05] devil will come right back
[47:08] and this is the case here
[47:10] when you put away the word amen praise
[47:14] god
[47:16] literally you take off the door from
[47:18] your house
[47:21] don't you think that all kinds of
[47:23] characters are going to start coming in
[47:24] your house even if some of them will
[47:26] only push their head to see well who
[47:28] living in here
[47:30] but some bald ones are going to come in
[47:34] but the timid ones will just put their
[47:35] head to see who's living in there with
[47:37] with no door on the house well just
[47:40] think of people who reject the word
[47:42] that's what they've done
[47:44] they left the door off of the house for
[47:47] jesus as the door the truth the word is
[47:49] the door and you put that out completely
[47:52] praise god matthew 24
[47:55] mentioned
[47:56] all these signs in the heavens
[47:59] concerning
[48:00] this
[48:01] the last day just before jesus
[48:05] comes
[48:06] but
[48:07] he wasn't pushed out of the church in
[48:09] one day
[48:11] incrementally
[48:13] you know that's how satan works
[48:15] he doesn't make it obvious now i'm
[48:18] pushing you out no but slowly
[48:22] centuries
[48:23] is pushing out the word
[48:25] centuries
[48:26] a little bit here a little bit there a
[48:28] little something there is pushing the
[48:31] word out like that amen praise god
[48:35] because remember
[48:37] um
[48:38] that when
[48:39] uh ephesians the ephesian church age
[48:42] under paul
[48:43] which is the first church age the church
[48:45] was like i don't know how many of you
[48:47] saw it but
[48:49] just about five nights ago you had the
[48:51] full moon
[48:53] anybody here saw it or you were in your
[48:55] bed well i was still up so i was able to
[48:57] look out and see what a beautiful bright
[49:01] you know full moon the moon in his
[49:03] fullness that's a type of how the early
[49:07] church was
[49:10] for the moon types
[49:12] the bride
[49:14] and the sun types christ
[49:18] and the moon actually has no light of
[49:21] its own
[49:22] but it reflects the light from off the
[49:25] sun
[49:27] and sends that light back in the world i
[49:30] would say back into the church age
[49:32] right so you it catches the light from
[49:36] off of the sun on the other side of the
[49:38] world the sun might be over here
[49:41] the moon might be up here but it catches
[49:44] that light and then shines it back down
[49:47] right
[49:48] praise god so actually
[49:51] the stars are the same in the cat they
[49:53] reflect light they are reflectors they
[49:56] are not originators they are not
[49:58] creators but the word itself is the
[50:02] creator
[50:03] the sun sends forth its light so first
[50:06] church is the sun the the church was a
[50:09] full moon
[50:11] now i want you to get this picture if
[50:13] you have ever seen uh the movements of
[50:16] the moon
[50:18] that uh
[50:19] after the full moon then a slight bit of
[50:22] darkness comes on that orb that circle
[50:26] and then more darkness and more darkness
[50:30] more darkness when i looked at uh the
[50:34] tables last night because i want to see
[50:36] it
[50:37] it was just a sliver of light
[50:40] that was left from that bright full moon
[50:43] i saw last week
[50:45] darkness kept coming in coming in and
[50:47] all i was left
[50:48] and i look at it maybe tonight or by
[50:51] tomorrow night it'll go into complete
[50:53] blackness before it swings in this cycle
[50:58] and start getting a little light and
[51:00] then start coming back again of course
[51:02] you know that's because of the ages and
[51:04] the restoration and all that but there
[51:06] it is praise god that is actually what
[51:10] has happened praise god now
[51:14] in the part of the seventh church age
[51:18] it
[51:19] was still growing
[51:21] the light was getting brighter that's on
[51:24] the pentecost he doesn't say it but we
[51:26] know that the light was getting brighter
[51:29] see
[51:30] oh my
[51:31] and
[51:32] for a while and then suddenly it stopped
[51:37] short
[51:39] and from the time it stopped short
[51:44] it began to win back to almost
[51:47] nothingness that's what we are in now we
[51:50] are right now when the original
[51:52] pentecost that was at the southern
[51:55] street that had the
[51:58] original word of god because they were
[52:01] teaching oneness and all that kind of
[52:03] stuff baptism in jesus name amen and
[52:06] then later the devil got in there and
[52:08] then the splits came where trinity mix
[52:11] come in and and then it was no more just
[52:13] a oneness movement become a trinitarian
[52:16] and oneness and the mix just started
[52:18] right from there right and he says and
[52:21] it began to wane
[52:23] to almost nothingness
[52:25] now
[52:26] so instead of light
[52:29] we see blackness of apostasy upon us
[52:32] amen that's what's here the blackness of
[52:36] apostasy upon us at the end of the age
[52:41] this light will cease to shine for the
[52:45] darkness has taken over
[52:48] mine just look out in the natural world
[52:50] brother branham said way back you know
[52:52] he said that that the this deceit the
[52:56] system of this world and the economies
[52:58] of this world is based on a foundation
[53:01] of lies and deceit
[53:04] that based on lies
[53:07] now
[53:08] when i heard one of the reporters saying
[53:11] you can't believe anything
[53:14] this certain uh not just the leader but
[53:16] the nation and the spokesman saying
[53:19] because he says it's just a whole
[53:22] bucket of lies constant lies no truth
[53:27] lie he wasn't preaching by the way he's
[53:29] just talking but i said my that would be
[53:32] good if you can preach that somewhere
[53:35] but it's just lies lies lies that's what
[53:38] the world has come down to
[53:41] and people are getting into that because
[53:43] for them to survive
[53:46] and live
[53:48] in a society
[53:50] that's riddled with lies
[53:53] the devil is constantly prodding and
[53:55] pushing and influencing
[53:58] you me
[53:59] anybody for that matter
[54:02] to tell
[54:03] lies
[54:04] amen but we are not lies we are children
[54:08] of the light and children of the truth
[54:11] praise god hallelujah and now we see in
[54:15] this last day
[54:17] the last eclipse of the moon
[54:21] was a total eclipse speaking of his time
[54:25] it rained to total darkness he's talking
[54:29] about this
[54:30] uh you know this famous picture
[54:34] same time
[54:35] of the moon waning until it went into a
[54:38] total blackout right
[54:41] now in its seventh stage of that moon
[54:45] remember in the seventh stage of the
[54:48] moon it went into total darkness
[54:53] at the same time
[54:55] he didn't say
[54:56] on the earth but i am putting in those
[54:59] words now on the earth the pope of rome
[55:05] paul vi
[55:07] went to palestine to make a holy tour of
[55:12] jerusalem
[55:14] he was the first pope to go to jerusalem
[55:17] now this pope is called paul vi
[55:20] paul was the first church age messenger
[55:24] and this man goes by that name
[55:28] but
[55:30] he is not the first back there
[55:33] he is
[55:35] the sixth
[55:36] which is the number of man
[55:40] this is more than a coincidence
[55:43] and when he went to jerusalem
[55:46] the moon or let me say or the church
[55:51] went into total darkness
[55:55] amen
[55:56] that is it
[55:58] this is the end for i tell you this
[56:01] generation shall not pass away
[56:04] until all
[56:05] things be fulfilled
[56:08] praise god
[56:09] hallelujah amen
[56:11] praise god glory
[56:14] aren't you thankful to god that our eyes
[56:16] will be opened to see these things
[56:21] he's telling you darkness is all around
[56:23] but how come you see
[56:26] how come you could recognize
[56:28] and you're able to walk in the middle of
[56:30] this that's why
[56:32] he said in another part of revelation
[56:35] walk with me
[56:37] in white
[56:38] can you keep your robes clean while
[56:40] you're walking with me
[56:42] amen can you walk with the king and keep
[56:45] your ropes clean
[56:46] in this world a brother harold preached
[56:49] a beautiful message many many years ago
[56:52] and i remember him making this point
[56:55] that you we go up into heaven and he
[56:58] said while we are in heaven um and we
[57:01] asking abraham what about your faith you
[57:03] and sarah how did that change take place
[57:06] and maybe you go over there and say uh
[57:08] ezekiel
[57:10] what did you really see describe it
[57:12] about the wheel in the middle of the
[57:13] wheel and and uh uh michael and then one
[57:17] of them turns up by the way what age you
[57:19] from he says look
[57:20] at this here they all jump back
[57:23] i'm just playing you know portraying how
[57:26] he put it over low this year that's that
[57:28] darkest evil as worst age what we were
[57:32] in was nothing in comparison you you
[57:35] came out of there you got to be an
[57:36] overcomer you got to be and you know he
[57:39] was preaching away praise that was his
[57:41] heyday praise god hallelujah but that's
[57:45] the truth brother you don't realize
[57:48] when you if you come out of this
[57:52] and you go over there and you don't
[57:54] think of yourself you're nothing but god
[57:56] says you're an overcomer
[57:59] amen
[58:01] you think when they have a relay race
[58:04] they're gonna put their worst man at the
[58:07] end
[58:08] nah
[58:09] they put their best man or woman at the
[58:13] end of the race
[58:15] because they know if there's any
[58:16] shortage they can make that up easy
[58:19] they take
[58:21] uh they take a lightning bolt and put
[58:23] them put them at the end of the race
[58:26] because they can make it up and this is
[58:28] what god has done with you and i
[58:32] you were elected to be in this age
[58:34] hallelujah because now we're cleaning up
[58:38] everything praise god we're running away
[58:40] with the prize brother that
[58:42] lord of god you're running away with it
[58:45] because god ordained its soul praise the
[58:48] lord now we see now
[58:52] he's changing the thought it's the same
[58:54] thought but he's going to another realm
[58:57] here
[58:58] and he's saying now can you see where
[59:01] them two vines one through one false
[59:04] abraham having them two sons one after
[59:08] the flesh one after the spirit one after
[59:10] the promise
[59:12] one wanting the promise the other one
[59:15] after things of the flesh now we can see
[59:19] they come from the same parents
[59:23] hallelujah
[59:25] just like we come from the same pattern
[59:28] you come from the same parents right
[59:31] he says there were twins
[59:34] is that right
[59:36] hallelujah
[59:37] years ago i preached a message twins in
[59:39] the beginning twins in the end right but
[59:42] that's the point they're twins that's
[59:45] the reason why a bell could
[59:48] shake kane's hand and my brother
[59:51] he knows the devil back there and then
[59:53] he said my brother and not with any
[59:55] feeling whatsoever i just know
[59:58] we praise god
[59:59] don't don't uh fault me for knowing but
[1:00:02] uh
[1:00:03] praise god he's conscious of it but
[1:00:05] doesn't give him any feeling he's still
[1:00:07] his brother praise god oh my how
[1:00:10] wonderful to know that prophet said here
[1:00:13] now that uh
[1:00:16] that not uh they are
[1:00:18] twins
[1:00:21] and remember when i tell you this
[1:00:25] that they know they know
[1:00:28] much of the same truth together
[1:00:33] they know much of the same message
[1:00:36] right
[1:00:37] see
[1:00:38] but
[1:00:39] that's not it
[1:00:41] see
[1:00:42] remember
[1:00:44] but they are not of the same spirit
[1:00:47] they know the same truth
[1:00:49] but they are not of the same spirit
[1:00:52] so the moment
[1:00:54] one with the wrong spirit trying to
[1:00:56] bring a manifestation or interpretation
[1:01:00] or understanding of the word it's
[1:01:02] automatically wrong
[1:01:04] right
[1:01:05] and the other one can't help it don't
[1:01:07] have to think about it it will always be
[1:01:09] right because they're both coming from
[1:01:11] the same tree but one is a lemon and one
[1:01:14] is an orange
[1:01:15] one is the original and one is not one
[1:01:17] grafted in there right so here it is
[1:01:21] so remember
[1:01:23] cannot persecute elect
[1:01:27] hallelujah elect cannot harm elect
[1:01:32] many years ago we used to say oh
[1:01:35] my goodness
[1:01:37] um i can't take that guy to court you
[1:01:39] know
[1:01:40] because that uh
[1:01:42] brother or that sister defrauded me of
[1:01:45] three thousand dollars or five thousand
[1:01:48] dollars but but according to the
[1:01:50] scripture i can't take them to court i
[1:01:51] can't deal with that but you know
[1:01:56] the bible's telling you here elect can't
[1:01:58] persecute elect but it's not talking
[1:02:00] about that
[1:02:02] right
[1:02:03] because if one has the revelation and
[1:02:05] one don't have the revelation brother
[1:02:08] branham in another place tells you the
[1:02:10] law is there god put the law actually as
[1:02:13] a protection
[1:02:16] against these ungodly men and ungodly
[1:02:18] people you don't say oh i can't take
[1:02:21] them to court they're not elect
[1:02:24] right
[1:02:26] that's working against the things of the
[1:02:28] flesh of course that still has the
[1:02:30] leadership of the holy spirit that will
[1:02:32] tell you when
[1:02:33] to and when not to right even in that
[1:02:36] right i can't detail that but in general
[1:02:39] don't just be deceived
[1:02:41] when it comes to
[1:02:42] a brother or a sister who you really
[1:02:46] know in your heart there's an elected
[1:02:49] son daughter of god now that is
[1:02:52] something i can't even comment on it's
[1:02:54] between you that person and god that
[1:02:56] will have to deal with that and that
[1:02:58] means anything any any problem along
[1:03:02] that line praise god now remember
[1:03:06] these reprobates
[1:03:08] that
[1:03:09] persecute and destroyed elect
[1:03:12] remember these reprobates they are
[1:03:15] religious
[1:03:18] then he said they are smart
[1:03:23] they are of the canned line
[1:03:27] they are
[1:03:29] serpent seed
[1:03:32] they build their bay bells
[1:03:35] today
[1:03:37] build their cities build their own
[1:03:40] empires
[1:03:41] and all the while while they are doing
[1:03:43] that they are calling on god
[1:03:46] just like the other one
[1:03:49] amen
[1:03:51] they hate the true seed
[1:03:54] and they will do all they can even in
[1:03:57] the name of the lord
[1:04:00] to destroy god's elected ones
[1:04:04] but
[1:04:04] remember this with all that
[1:04:07] they are still needed
[1:04:11] in the church
[1:04:13] and i'm quoting here now brother
[1:04:15] mohammed said they are needed
[1:04:17] hallelujah but jesus said that
[1:04:20] he said don't pull it up don't pull it
[1:04:21] up if you pull up the tears you may pull
[1:04:24] up some wheat also i only may know the
[1:04:26] difference between the real beat and
[1:04:28] tears so you don't go not pulling up let
[1:04:30] let me do that in the end
[1:04:32] right the word will do all the pulling
[1:04:35] up
[1:04:36] the word will do the separating you you
[1:04:38] don't have to separate yourself from
[1:04:40] anybody
[1:04:42] i don't want this one no no no no the
[1:04:44] word will do that
[1:04:47] you just live and let the holy spirit
[1:04:49] have this wonderful way amen they are
[1:04:53] needed
[1:04:55] don't you think the chaff is needed for
[1:04:57] the wheat
[1:04:59] no chaff no wheat
[1:05:01] for the chaff actually protects the
[1:05:04] wheat he doesn't say that i'm saying
[1:05:05] this now i've been coding well you said
[1:05:08] that chaff protects the wheat it
[1:05:10] surrounds it until it comes to its
[1:05:12] maturity and then it's
[1:05:15] the chaff has to fall away because now
[1:05:17] the wheat can stand on its own praise
[1:05:19] god hallelujah so it doesn't need to
[1:05:21] chaff around it to prop it up and and
[1:05:24] that sort of thing see that's what
[1:05:28] then when it comes to that state what
[1:05:31] happens to the chaff then the chaff is
[1:05:34] now bundled to be burned with
[1:05:37] unquenchable fire
[1:05:39] amen and the wheat what happens to it
[1:05:42] the time comes when it has to be
[1:05:45] gathered
[1:05:46] into the garner
[1:05:48] oh praise god oh elect of god and i'm
[1:05:51] winding up here now
[1:05:56] and
[1:05:56] the prophet gives us some advice
[1:05:59] he says here
[1:06:01] beware
[1:06:04] i talked about this next thing
[1:06:06] and he said study
[1:06:09] study closely
[1:06:11] friends study
[1:06:13] we must study closely
[1:06:15] and the holy spirit brought my thoughts
[1:06:18] into the fact that
[1:06:20] do you know because a lot of people are
[1:06:23] hearing speaking about revelation
[1:06:27] many people are
[1:06:30] you know denying themselves reading
[1:06:32] their bible
[1:06:34] as simple as reading their bible
[1:06:36] listening to the tapes
[1:06:38] because they're living off of revelation
[1:06:41] but faith or revelation cometh by
[1:06:44] hearing
[1:06:46] and hearing comet by the word of god
[1:06:50] back to the word
[1:06:53] back to the
[1:06:54] reading your bible
[1:06:56] hallelujah praise god
[1:06:59] amen no don't don't just say well you're
[1:07:02] the pastor you're going to read your
[1:07:03] bible well i don't read my bible like a
[1:07:06] regimentation
[1:07:08] might be late in the night or early in
[1:07:10] the morning
[1:07:11] all of a sudden i might think of
[1:07:13] something and i run and pick up the
[1:07:14] bible
[1:07:15] it doesn't matter what i'm doing in the
[1:07:17] middle of writing something
[1:07:18] i just run pick up the bible and look up
[1:07:20] that one verse i'm not going to go and
[1:07:23] be like a dynamic nationalist i got to
[1:07:25] prove to everybody i'm spiritual so i
[1:07:27] need to study here for so many hours
[1:07:31] until the morning comes
[1:07:33] and when i see the sun come out then i
[1:07:36] stop reading no
[1:07:38] i'll just read the scripture that the
[1:07:40] holy spirit
[1:07:41] placed upon my heart
[1:07:44] and when it's five minutes or ten
[1:07:46] minutes i read it
[1:07:48] and i close the bible
[1:07:50] and then i meditate on what i read
[1:07:53] amen
[1:07:54] so study the word
[1:07:56] go back pick up those
[1:07:59] books of the and tapes listen to them
[1:08:02] even when you don't understand the
[1:08:04] prophet said that too long after i'm
[1:08:06] gone just lay on your coat sit in your
[1:08:08] chair play the tapes listen listen
[1:08:11] listen to it and let it come in this
[1:08:13] bread that's stored up for your soul
[1:08:15] amen and take it all in praise god
[1:08:19] beware
[1:08:21] study
[1:08:23] then he says be careful
[1:08:26] amen work out your salvation with fear
[1:08:29] and trembling
[1:08:31] rely upon god not on your wisdom don't
[1:08:35] lean on your wisdom don't link to your
[1:08:37] understanding
[1:08:39] and don't don't start thinking oh i
[1:08:41] really understand the message now i know
[1:08:43] the message i'm strong no no no no no
[1:08:46] you know nothing
[1:08:48] i don't know anything right you say oh
[1:08:51] that's not true because you read your
[1:08:53] bible yes you don't understand
[1:08:56] the more um one
[1:09:00] knows
[1:09:01] is the more they don't know
[1:09:05] is the more you realize that you really
[1:09:07] don't know
[1:09:08] amen
[1:09:10] hallelujah
[1:09:12] in all these lodges and things that
[1:09:14] happen to me talking about that i
[1:09:16] mention it now but you know that they're
[1:09:18] blindfolded before they're taken to
[1:09:21] another stage
[1:09:22] and that blindfold is just a symbol
[1:09:25] to say that person doesn't know
[1:09:28] right you go back to the martial arts
[1:09:31] and the fellow will start with a white
[1:09:34] belt
[1:09:35] and then the numbers the colors will
[1:09:37] change
[1:09:38] you know when he gets up to mastery
[1:09:42] there's no belt he can't what color is
[1:09:45] he going to put because by then you
[1:09:47] realized he don't know
[1:09:49] he realized don't know
[1:09:50] now he's got to go into creativity uh
[1:09:54] and allow himself to go to a state where
[1:09:56] he don't even know how he's going to
[1:09:57] answer a certain
[1:10:00] response from the opponent but because
[1:10:03] of the way he is
[1:10:05] something will happen something will
[1:10:06] work out but praise god amen your
[1:10:10] adversary the devil is even now going
[1:10:13] around like a roaring lion
[1:10:16] seeking whom he may devour hallelujah
[1:10:20] can you imagine that
[1:10:22] the devil is peering peeping looking
[1:10:24] behind every bush every park everywhere
[1:10:27] you go
[1:10:28] he's looking for an opening if we make
[1:10:31] any opening he'll seize it
[1:10:33] right like that so he says be careful be
[1:10:35] watchful
[1:10:37] amen be watch
[1:10:40] always watch
[1:10:42] onto prayer watch unto prayer and be
[1:10:45] steadfast
[1:10:48] this is the end time both the true and
[1:10:51] false vine
[1:10:52] they're bought coming into maturity
[1:10:56] before the wheat matures those ripened
[1:10:59] tears
[1:11:00] must be bound for the burning
[1:11:03] they are all joining the world council
[1:11:05] of churches that is the binding soon the
[1:11:09] wheat
[1:11:10] garnering will come but right now the
[1:11:13] two spirits
[1:11:15] are at work in these
[1:11:17] two vines
[1:11:18] so come out from among the tears
[1:11:22] start to overcome
[1:11:24] that you may be considered praised
[1:11:26] worthy
[1:11:27] and fit

[1:11:36] oh thank god they put him outside the
[1:11:38] church

[1:11:42] very happy they put him outside the
[1:11:43] church
[1:11:44] i believe bartimaeus was very happy that
[1:11:47] they put him outside the church because
[1:11:50] aleppo you couldn't even go close to the
[1:11:53] um to the temple in those days their
[1:11:56] temple guards they keep people like that
[1:11:58] away they can't come but it's good he
[1:12:01] was out beyond the camp he was outside
[1:12:04] there and you look at all those
[1:12:06] characters that were outside zacchaeus
[1:12:08] and this tax collectors and looked upon
