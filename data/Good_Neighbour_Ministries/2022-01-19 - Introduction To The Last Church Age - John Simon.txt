TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the lord it is indeed a joy being here with you on this wonderful night to think about the things of god and as the scripture tells us we should place our minds on heavenly things things of the lord and not so much upon things that are upon this earth welcome and the lord bless us together as we gather in his name to bring glory and honor to him praise the lord well i shall be reading from the book of revelation chapter 1 and then i will go over and read a verse from chapter 3 of the book of revelation and i will be speaking on the subject of introducing the last church age and that is what i will be dealing with tonight introducing to you the last church age in revelation chapter 1 reading from verse 12 john said and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the golden candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and girt about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his ears were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters and he that had in his right hand and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp to edge its sword and his countenance was as the sun shinet in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last amen now in chapter of this marvelous book of revelation the first part of verse 14 reads thus and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god amen let us pray our righteous father our loving father we thank you for this marvelous privilege and now we will we ask your divine blessing upon these wonderful ripples of truth may they spread out across the land may they reach the elected wherever they are he or she or or young men young women whoever they are may the spirit or of the living god reach them father you said not one will be left behind all lamb of god oh by the sprinkling of the blood of christ may this word drop upon whomsoever thou wilt for we ask it in the name of jesus christ who died for our sins arose again for our justification coming again for lord god for our glorification through rapturing grace in the name of jesus christ our lord amen and amen here in revelation chapter 1 we are seeing a glorious wonderful picture as john himself saw him walking up and down amongst the seven golden candlesticks and while he was walking amongst those candlesticks in his right hand were seven stars oh praise god hallelujah now of course seven candlesticks as the seven candlesticks that were in the old temple in uh amongst the israelites they find out that these seven candlesticks uh represent the seven church ages or the seven churches that were in asia symbolic and representative of the seven ages that were to come we will speak more on that the seven stars in his right hand were also represented representative of his preeminence and power over these seven stars which represented this seven messengers and of course an angel is a messenger so the seven angels to the seven church ages is what these seven stars in his hand his control his power is representative of now in our studies over the past year uh we have been blessed together to walk with him as john did spiritually we walk with him amongst these seven churches seven church ages we talked about the set the messengers we describe them each one replace them positionally in time and in the word of god we studied their portion of the word they were chosen to represent and to highlight to our hearts by the presence of the holy spirit upon their lives working through them using them for his glory and now after our journey coming to the ending of our journey in this glorious feast of the word of god we have come down now to the last church age better known as the laodicean church age as found in revelation chapter 3 amen and there in this last church age hallelujah the last day of the week spiritual week we've come to the last day of this spiritual week just as much as in john chapter 7 when the bible tells us when it came to the that great day now coming down to the last day it they feast but the last day of the week was the seventh day and at the ending of that seventh day beginning of the first day he lifted up his voice roaring like a lion speak seventh thunders blasting forth out of his mouth praise god and there my friends he's walking up and down the churches this great shepherd of the sheepfold with tender love and care walking up and down shining the light shining the light from these seven stars back into the church ages and now in this seven day week just before the eighth day comes the seventh messenger or last messenger of the age oh praise god and this study of course is just a broad outline or introduction to the last church age better known to us as the laodicean church age now of course laodicea means is a is a woman's name laodicea is a woman's name and leotisia itself means people's rights people's rights now let us talk about the characteristics of this church which will be and is in the seventh church age and the reason why we will or we must study the characteristics of the age is to understand what type of spirit what type of motivations actions are moving the people moving the church world and causing things to happen right because that church of leodisia that was back there was representative of the church age physically in which we lived now and therefore we will study the church age that was back there that we might have an understanding of what is happening here what is going to happen here right on out to fading out into the eternity for the la for the mighty angel cried one foot on the land one on the sea lifted up his hands towards heaven one with the open book crying with a mighty voice time shall be no more oh yes time for these ages have run out that is not saying all time for all universes all all planets is over but that time for the church age is over that is what we will be looking into all of these things as we consider laodicea the last church age we as we have said it is important for us to know the characteristics of the laodicean church age that was back there that we might understand the characteristics of our age as far as the world the world system the religious systems that we must survive and live in and that we may understand them how to walk this road that lies ahead before us now you'll say to me brother simon what what what are these characteristics of the leducian church age of which you have just told us now first of all we will find as we explore god's word that the laodicean church age is an age where it is predicted an age of women's rights women will rise up in great power an age where women will will be of great influence we will expand on these things later but i want you to recognize that pick that within your heart that this is a woman's age this is a woman's time a time of woman power female power female control female domination yes women are rising into power and there's nothing they can do to stop this for it is within the boundaries of god's word it is also a time of universal religion where we find that there is there will be and there is a push and a trend towards having universal religion everywhere there is a desire the hunger you see when one like that satan creates chaos then he creates the hunger it makes humans have the hunger for for seeing eye to eye finding unity somewhere uh finding common ground and thus we we now have a drive we have the push or urge towards having one universal religion whereby rulers kings governors presidents will no longer have to deal with uh thousands of disparate groups but one main religion making it simpler simpler to control simpler to discuss and speak with simpler to finance and so on but here it is we will speak on that during this talk on laodicea the last church age in our bible also ledecia is found to be an age of unions uniting time for the church of the living god uniting time for satan and his false vine also but naturally speaking it will be an age where there is a cry for union protection oh we see unions have grown in great strength and they will grow even stronger for out of those natural unions let me not go there now but we will we look at it the shadows of this here the hand is raised up the light striking against the hand throws the shadows on the wall we're looking my friends at that coming the shadow becoming reality in our day and in our time in this last age of laodicea an age of unions an age of a uniting time it will also be an age and of a call and a cry or let us use the stir of a demand for civil rights for equal rights all manner of rights there will be this pull this call a drive causing all kinds of uh social uh upheavals turbulence like the great waves of the deep my friends everywhere civil unrest cry for civil rights everyone seeking searching crying for demanding their various rights we will expand on that in the talks to come as we speak on this leo this year the last church age that will bring us to the consummation of all the ages put together be here as i said an age that will be characterized by cry for civil rights will be an age of politics man filled with politics and age filled with politics men experimenting in the laboratories of government to find the perfect means by which to govern civilization these are things we will talk about during our talk here on laodicea the last church age this will be an age of acumenism world council of churches as we have alluded to before that there will be a drive and a push towards having one universal religion and the world does not know what it is but here with ecumenism that religion that faith will be identified for it's already identified in the bible we will talk about these things but the drive the pull push towards ecumenism is seen felt an experience everywhere by those who live and work and move within the religious realm but also as that creates a disturbance in the spiritual realms in the natural realms of earth this last age characterizes the pollution the destabilization so of society of minds of hearts most of all it foretells us of great earthquakes striking the land striking the earth the earth will be struck by great earthquakes oh we will love to speak on these things in the weeks ahead as we talk about this last church age earthquakes you're seeing you're reading you're hearing of them everywhere earthquakes taking place earthquakes under the ocean just a few days ago one took place in the bottom of the sea causing a tsunami to go out to to uh oh kill and destroy and terrify my friends oh this is the age that we live in the last church age time is running out or has run out oh look about it an age of science this age this last age will be and is characterized by great scientific achievements great education man shall run to and fro the bible tells us and knowledge shall increase in the book of daniel aeronautical things will increase travel the speed of light the the desire for men to move everywhere go back and forth it's written in your bible i am proud to say that i am associated with one who knows all things before they even happen for his name is god the lord jesus christ himself who know it knows all things and i'm glad to be a part of his economy this last church age will also and is characterized as an age of materialism and riches everywhere is a cry for success and prosperity when men and women believe once they've made it into those ranks of riches realm of prosperity oh they have arrived at their nirvana they have arrived at their place of of of their dreams they come to the end of their rainbow and they believe they're sitting on top of the world we will speak on these things how men are carried away by this lust for life and this move from rocks to riches oh my friends as we delve into this last age of little dcl we will see these things unfold right before our very eyes it is also prefigured by the living god that this last age of leodisia will be an age of immorality unfaithfulness uncleanness [Music] oh friends you'll find it written in the gospel of luke chapter 17 verses 26 to 30. it is right within the word of god as it was in the days of noah the days of lot sodom so shall it be in that day when the son of man is being revealed and so this last age this will be one of the defining characteristics of this age where there'll be more millionaires billionaires trillionaires all materialism riches all these things will be here violence and evil across the land you'll see it everywhere but it will also be characterized to be an age of apostasy or we may say an age of the falling away from the true faith falling away from the word of god reduction in church attendance reduction in any desire for religious knowledge for knowing the god who created and places here it'll die out within the hearts of men and in the church world that hangs on holds on claiming to believe there's coming there there is and there is coming even more of the cold winds called north winds freezing ice of dead formality and religion coming with a fixation upon the people becoming icicles becoming icebergs my friends terrible times are facing us here now upon the face of the earth in this during this last church age you may read in your bible 2nd thessalonians chapter 2 verse 3. you may also read revelation 3 verse 16 speaking of the waves of spiritual indifference that will hit the slam like an asteroid into the face of the earth creating all manner of mayhem and religious destabilization and faith we'll find it everywhere amen yes sir but thanks be to god in this age we find the rebirth and the return of the spirits that were in the time of leodicia those wicked devils that were there from the time of noah accumulated with the same devils that were there in the time of pharaoh where they lost their bodies in the red sea those same devils that came back in the time of nebuchadnezzar and many perished under god's judgment with the handwriting upon the wall the accumulation of all those devils that were there by the rivers of babylon by the river euphrates yes all those wicked demonic spirits working in the church realm have returned all of them accumulated in ancient laodicea and now our adversary the devil has come down amongst us and he knows that his time is short for he is a creature oh and creature had to be made they had to be created and as such he has an end oh my and knowing that his time is short like a condemned murderer he decides now now he he's only have one life so he's going to kill us many and destroy as many and steal as many as he can steal from destroy from because this is the day and the hour when violence and evil are in their upswing at this time for the light is going out and as the light goes out the darkness comes in to rule oh brother sister let us walk with jesus christ that we may have our way of escape that he has planned i am the door you come through him and you'll be able to enter the doorway of escape oh praise god there is no safety zone in the day we are living in the only safety zone we can find is in christ the rock of ages hallelujah oh let us bury ourselves let us hide ourselves in the cleft of the rock oh praise god and jesus is soon to come with joy we welcome his appearing to him or her that hat and here to hear let them hear for the glory of god may the lord richly bless you keep you and bring you again into his divine presence for us to sink on these things in the light of his glorious coming amen [Music] you
