[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] brother ages and Printers [Music] [Music] he's a seasoned Minister the gospel value and take these his church is out alveta semi-random faith amen praise God so it was spirit of life assembly but these changed the name of the best bike ever glad to have him and the next time you love a sister definitely come also available god bless well tonight all the cars received the Word of God flavors so we're glad to have our brother it will be a really close so close to sea battle so close to the states amended barks - because the store [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] no it's on mute or something [Music] thank you very nicely on this Saturday even thank you so very much for you come into the house of worship and it's always a privilege blessing and honor to be with brother sister silent and you precious people that are here allow you a time during aren't you more than I'm sure that do you realize and those are not superficial words appreciate you so very very much while you're standing let's turn the Saint Saint Mark chapter 4 and if you don't want to read from the amplified that's ok I have 15 minutes to pack in an hour so mark chapter four tasting on that verses 26 through 929 and he said this is Jesus the master teacher so it's the king develop as if a man should cast seed into the ground and choose sleep and rise 90 days and the siege has sprung up in growth he knoweth not health for the earth brings forth fruit of herself the lane first the blade then to here and after that the full court in the youth but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he put a pen the sickle because the harvest see people hallelujah [Music] the kingdom of God is a lot of a man who scatters seed upon the ground and then continue sweeping for us ignited a policy the seed sprouts Minerva's and increases he knows about how the earth produces acted by itself first the blade then the ear the fulcrum in the ear open the greatest rock and permits and made in the east hence full of the Reapers and puts in the sickle because the harvest stands ready second Corinthians chapter three verse eighteen three but we all with an open face beholding as a neglect the glory of Lord are changed into the same image from Lord glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord from from the amplified but all of us as with unveiled face because we continued to behold in the Word of God as in a mirror the glory of the Lord our constantly being translated and to his very own image and if increasing splendor on from one degree of poverty to another or this comes from the Lord who is the spirit and let's set up this whole verse bezel watch the drillers chapter number four verse number 15 for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words amen and we'll once again from the amplified verse 15 or this we declare to you by the Lord's homework that we who are alive and remain unto the coming of all or chela know what may proceed into his presence or have an advantage and all over those who have previously fallen asleep for the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with all that cry of summons with the shell of the Archangel and the blast of the trumpet of God and those who have departed this life in Christ will rise first then we the living ones who remain on the earth shall simultaneously be caught up along with the resurrect the dead in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so always three-ton a fee of eternity shall be with the Lord therefore comfort and encourage one another with these words we can say there's a particularly but they statement appalled to the Corinthian church and not believers they to me they mirror one another real costly in in Thessalonians the word caught it from the Greek means pulled semantics taken like a thief like a thief does and I thought those these expressions are pretty irrelevant to us and Jesus said in a st. John chapter 8 verse 31 if you continue in my word then you're my disciples some time ago I had I had to have some body work done all my behavior you know the owner of the body shop said this to me he said you can take a bumper and that was a part of the vehicle that needed attention amen you can take a bumper now he wants him in such bad shape but it was had been hit and he said you can take a bumper that's been damaged by an accident but the bumper is repairable it's dented maybe twisted and he said you can lay that in the on a hot day in the presence of the Sun and that bumper will return to its original floor yeah this is what the messenger said and I'm saying things that he said that are very familiar with each child whom I'm assuming with each of you if if not the majority by far he said one of the primordial and blinks in the presence of the Sun and rocketing our maturity along with that he says that when a bride recognizes who she is hoo-wee we use that word bride very long and very heard correct in its usage but there would never be a bride if there wasn't a broad girl the largeness of the focus to me should be on the bridegroom but said when she recognizes who she is then that will bring all the the body change our that we bring on a resident of this together and this evening that if there's any one whose wife has been twisted rent method' life or the god of this evil age then there is a there is a remedy for the that's not affected by that this particular world in some form right with the mental emotional physical financial due to fear marriage whatever we're not immune from that and we're not exempt from a menace ooh I'm assuming that perhaps in any group of people any group of gathering about there would be people whose lives have been negatively affected and that we could say that they have been twisted you see what he declared him in a promise or length of the platform he brings that the past and so heaven and earth will pass but his work will pass away living so as the instructions of the messenger then that we just stay in that presence yes yes what you'll return to your original so are you returning to your original heart then actually this work out of the season has reconnected the believer and the embraces of the Word of Life it has reconnected us at least in recognition for to our eternalness if we are we're in a temporal body but we came from another world and I don't want to use statements that you're so familiar with but you can say well I've heard that a million times but I think it's so nice to recognize that we're transient people where there is something in it on the inside of the predestinated believer see no God that is brewing and continuing to grow and in poverty that we are change from it is led to the vessel in Atkins that we've ever alive and remain shall be caught they have to be they mirror each other right it was seeing parable the recent in result re an objective that has been expressed in and that in result our objective or goal is that there is a full of the full life in Maxine passed through various stages but explored itself right into that in see for anybody so what is telling me to us that that must pass through this life was in the stock the lines in the blade the line amen come on a from now us for itself yeah see right friends we are so privileged we can participate that we can and this is changing us Flipkens 3 verse 20 and 21 if you would read that from the amplified very very quickly chapter 3 verses 20 and 21 and to me it's the goal of the and objective how that the seat of go verse 20 both and I really appreciated how this is working but we are citizens of a state Commonwealth homeland that just really grim face we are citizens of a state the Commonwealth with this common the citizens of the kingdom of God the homeland which is in heaven and from and also we earnestly patiently await the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ the Messiah Savior who will transform and fashion a new the body of our humiliation to conform to and be like the body of his glory and majesty from into the mirror we are changed from glory to glory they meant can you imagine winning that when in troubles make the direction it from Egypt that unimportant to assume here of that there were people get that was advanced in age another cycle until saying to you that he had no need for a back in the cinemas those they were advanced in age and perhaps a life had been so long cruel to them not leaving them the best and they were someone handicapped they were perhaps disease and sick they were crippled can you imagine your and your mind when they began to eat chanting program cause that's the only place in not go meet with us right his mother so under the shed blood and that was applied on an and they begin to beat the Lambeth in the lab which it was a type of course of Christ or did they begin to make them can you imagine something supernaturally would have any any video game at cocktail hour run again to manifest itself in their body and they they can say without man something is a very to be [Music] 13 Papa and that's going to thank your body physically my body because that C is more powerful than the still pro body give you different focus but there is a seed of life all the inside there is greatness on the inside [Music] your pores there's a lot of stock churches there's a lot of shut churches there's a lot of cockroaches but then there's just there is a seed group and once again all that this once manifested it was that those spirits stages of growth stop Malaysia is now all in the sea this is just true that we assume so singing perspectives our pulsar this is reality Oh my brother sister Alton all the power of their party all the victory all the Dominion all the wisdom is now in the secret room or the opinions perhaps a gift of your parents your neighbors own or whoever it would be right if their opinion stop making amends that's a form you write it doesn't proceeding in your life the sister there is no saving to us a bath in the village yeah I think it is a close that we have sell sold ourselves very very short and we have really invest a matter of that we have done that we brought hurt you snort insult to the create for that region does better Indian aid us that wrote our names in the Lamb's Book of Life I think perhaps that we not only harm ourselves but have have we harmed the family ago and we harmed the kingdom of God and we harmed the progress of the dust just simply kept small thinking we will lose small fingers pop small things small talk small acts mom and so the three things fall and we talk we're going to we're going to really walk around very defeated because it's going to be over to me all the moments occurred to be look what's happened to me in Smith we can have our mantra dude washing the Lord and we can declare that creativity from physical genes right they may have not been the most brilliant I'm talking about they may not have been the most brilliant but when it comes to the the that birth and that life this actually you're into the realm of a sixth sense and then over here I want to talk about the something about you never see Jesus I'm talking about the talking is how he was surrounded by our loving the surrounded by you never hear him talking that I can't do that that's too difficult I'm too tired and what happened you near you you remember here talking about he was always his words were always the father's work so we're believe the baggage over here behind the top of this garbage and bring it all right and bring a place up over here and we we begin to educate ourselves we were talking teen to language right they're talking the language of our team we're going to believe that you embrace that they're not not that you haven't but if you embrace what is presented to you and you're you know you will send this up he gets squeezed out he gets what is true as the moment a mental asylum is already constantly do not see because we're human you will experience him more precious his integrity mentioning something that in comparison the indescribable the unleavened bread and in the one who produces it produces level people [Applause] these [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] set the captives free we into your and in the service
