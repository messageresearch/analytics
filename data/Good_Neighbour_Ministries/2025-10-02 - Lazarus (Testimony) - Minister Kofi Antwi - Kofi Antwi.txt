Sorry I was a little bit delay but you'll be blessed because God is here. &gt;&gt; Once the Lord is here that's all it matter. So I won't delay you too much. Uh we take the Bible. I'll use my background Lazarus because I'm going to give a testimony. I am not willing to maybe a little bit if I have time then I speak a little bit. If not the whole thing going to be testimony tonight since I got sick and the Lord has brought me back. I would love to give that testimony. So pay attention and listen because God, our God that we serve is not in the tomb. He's alive. &gt;&gt; He's alive. &gt;&gt; He raised Lazarus. He's still raising up people today. Amen. &gt;&gt; The churches don't know, but you and I, this must be a confidence to us that the Lord once we trust him and obey him and and walk with him, no matter what situation you go through, he's able to bring you out. Unless it's your time that he has ordained for you to go, no matter what. If we as believers have that faith, the Lord can do anything. All things are possible. &gt;&gt; I believe that. So, uh we take our Bible from John chapter 11 and I will start from okay let's start from verse 4. When I read sometime I to the praise I want it's all about Lazarus. God raising Lazarus from the grave and says uh his sisters you know I it's too long the time see so I'll cut it off. Okay let us pray. Brother Phillip can you come and pray before we start? Just stand and you want the mic or &gt;&gt; That's fine. Just lift your voice. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh John 11 verse4 when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the son of God might be glorified whereby now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. When he heard when he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abide two days still in the same place where he was. Then after that said he to his disciples, "Let us go into Judea again." His disciples say unto him, "Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee, and go thou tither again?" Jesus answered, "Are there not 12 hour in a day? If a man walk in the day, he stumble not because he said the he he he see the light of the world. But if a man walk in the light, he stumble because there is no light in him. Then this these things said he and after that he said unto them, "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth, but I go that I may awoke him out of sleep." Then said his disciples, "Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. How be Jesus speak of his death? But they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead, and I am glad for your sake that I was not there to the intent ye may believe. Nevertheless, lest let us go into him. Okay, for the time sake. Then uh verse 21. Let's turn to verse 21. I'm just going to rush. Then said matter unto Jesus, Lord, if thou has been here, my brother had not died. But I know that even now, whatsoever thou would ask of God, God will give it, give it thee. Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again. Okay. Okay. I I'm jumping. Okay. Let's jump to 39. Jesus said, "Take ye away the stone." Matter the sister of him that was dead said unto him, "Lord, by this time he thinkketh, for he has been dead for days." Jesus said unto her, "Said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldast believe, thou should have seen the glory of God." Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lift up his eye and said, "Father, I thank thee that thou hearest thou has heareest me, and I know that thou hearest me always, because but because of these people which stand by, I said it, that they may believe that thou has sent me. Okay, I'm go on. Please sit down. Right, we all know he he raised Lazarus from the tomb. I that's what I'm trying to say. But because the time I'm trying to rush. Brothers and sisters, let us give glory and honor unto the Lord because let me tell you, you all knew I was about to go to Thank you, pastor. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you. &gt;&gt; All right. I was about to go to Ghana on May 24th because my son Paul was going to marry and a week to go which was Saturday night. I went to in the that Saturday I went with my daughter a big girl because she was going to work at Toronto. I went to I went to Toronto with her, drove her, even went to free market, came back, drop her at 6K, came back home in the night around maybe 11 to 12, my wife was doing her washing, laundry. So we I was sitting bed with her. We were talking even try to help her to unfold the clothes. In my mind everything my mind has move from here that I'm going home and it reached a time I felt like I'm going to bed to sleep. So my wife hasn't finished the laundry. So he went to a big girl womb to keep on folding the clothes and I slept. But while I was going to bed, I put a tablet in about brother Abraham message and I slept. So in the middle of sleeping I woke up. Right that time I could not breathe proper. I realized I need help. So I went to Paul room and knock Paul door. Paul was at sleep and I told him Paul son your father I cannot breathe good so I call your mother and Paul called her mother and the mother came and still I wasn't able to breed good so I told my wife Mary please put water on my head then my wife cold water. My wife's putting cold water on my head and he says, "What is happening? What is happening?" You love to know that one I remember. But the way my breathing was going, I couldn't breathe normal. So my wife was desperate and right away I saw that this thing is serious on me and I tried to breathe but it wasn't coming good. So I lay down in the washroom floor which is the master bedroom and that's all I could remember. not knowing I was during that time pass out or Abigail how do you say that that's why I brought her so many things I don't know come around come around my daughter she knows all the terms I was gone I would say there are things Abi will say for me in in medical terms he knows everything. I don't know the terms. So my wife was crying. Paul was crying. So my wife told Paul to call the uh parameh. So he called the paramedics and while they are coming my wife also called h uh brother Phillip and I think Rose picked the phone. My wife was so crying because that time I I am totally gone. I can't remember nothing or see nothing. But according to my wife and he called brother Phillip. So brother Philip was right away he was on his way coming. He told them that brother Kofi is dying. Brother Kofi is dying and my wife says he saw things while he was in back home. They told her when somebody is dying the way the eye the ball the mouth uh the uh puff uh things coming out. So and those things he could see I was going through those things and before. So he was crying seriously. So brother Philillip just get in his car. Rose was crying and because my wife left the phone crying and Paul is talking with the paric on the line and they came. Thank God about six people because the way Paul was crying and calling them they realized it is serious something really is happening. So about six or seven of them came you know how here it is. When they came, they used the the shock, right? &gt;&gt; They they used the so basically to shock him. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Cardiac arrest. &gt;&gt; Okay. Say it loud. Don't don't don't let your mouth small. Say it so they could hear it. I want them to hear it. &gt;&gt; So basically, my dad was in cardiac arrest, which means that his heart stopped and he wasn't breathing. There was no signs of life. So the paramedics came. They had to do CPR and they also um delivered shock to him to get him back. &gt;&gt; So they did what they have to do. Then they get a pulse on me. Then they have to rush me to the hospital. So they told my wife I was playing the during that time they the tablet was playing and the message brother was talking about was Lazarus. Okay. Paul said they told Paul go off the tablet. So Paul went and off the tablet. While he was offing the tablet, Rabbi was talking about the resurrection of Lazarus. So Paul says that gave him a little bit confidence that no matter what this is not dead, my father will rise up again. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they took me to the hospital. My wife and Paul came and once they were in the hospital, my wife asked the secretary in the emergency, my husband, they have brought my husband here, can I please uh see my husband? The lady checked on the computer. My name was not there. So they haven't processed my name into their program yet. Then he told my wife, "Wait, I'm going to uh the counter to find out was the main office to find how things are going." So he went and came back and he says, "Yes, your husband is here." So they uh they told her that he should go to the uh u ICU, right? &gt;&gt; Huh? No. So, um that that time um they brought you into the emergency room and um they they told mom to go they they brought mom to a room and and told her to wait there. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, when my wife was waiting, there was a nurse who came to my wife. My wife asked said, "Where is my husband?" He says, "I cannot tell you. Just wait. there will be a doctor's coming to you to speak to you. So right there that time brother Philillip has called he's almost there. Paul have to go and direct him where to park so that he won't get a ticket and things. So, brother Philillip came in with Paul and while they come in the nurse could my wife says I wanted to see my husband where they have put him. He says no I can't tell you unless the doctors are coming to meet you. So my wife told brother Phillip my wife was so cold desperate because why is it that they have told me my husband is in the hospital but I cannot see my husband what is going on in her mind that's why she was thinking what's wrong if anything wrong they should let me see but this lady is saying no she can't talk to her unless the doctors so my My wife and brother Philillip came with Paul and my wife told brother Phillip, brother Phillip says sister Mary just calm down because he saw the situation says come down sister let's pray everything going to be all right. So he come my wife a little bit they wait for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Then Dr. Okay. While I was in the hospital, I have already gone that they were discussing the doctors were discussing and the nurses so many of them were discussing that how they going to come to my wife to tell her to get prepared to go and whether they will bury me or whatever they want to M. So while they were thinking like that in the room, all of a sudden they saw brothers and sisters something just creaking in the body again. Life just creek a little bit in the body. Then they started everything. They put life support and put the oxygen oxygen, right? &gt;&gt; Um so um when they found his pulse again um they had to intubate him. So they put a tube down his throat and they put him on a ventilator. So that's the life support. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Life support. And they rushed me and they came the doctor came to my wife and asked her did your husband fall down? My wife says no, but this is serious and we the doctor says I have done the that's the higher doctor in the in charge of the ICU says I have done everything but look to you should look into the man upstairs. I have done all I can do as a doctor, but the rest you have to look to the man upstairs. He have to do his job too. You know how doctors are, they won't say God, &gt;&gt; they won't say the Lord. But you and I know the man upstairs is me. The Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's calling the Lord Jesus Christ to do his job. Even I'm going to go I'm going to go back to the hospital for them to see what the Lord has done. &gt;&gt; So why the doctor says that brother Philillip was right there too, right, Philillip? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So he heard it not my wife alone or my children alone Paul. So they brought me to the ICU which is my the room that they will put me. During that time my breathing was just tiny tiny tiny bit. My eye has closed. I didn't see nothing. My daughter they Paul test her. So she she she took a taxi, one of her officers, pay her taxi and he drove right with taxi from Toronto downtown to Willen Hospital. So he came and saw it. They were talking to her. They told my wife, they were asking my wife, "What has happened to your husband? We we would like to know anything about him." So my wife talked to them about the medicine and things that I was I've have gone through already a kidney problem and uh diabetes medicine this I was already seeing so many doctors before this came. So my daughter explained every medicine that I was already taking to to them. Then they realized the things that they are dealing with. Only God could bring me alive because it looked like there was no hope. But when there is no hope and Jesus still in the boat, brother, keep your head up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sister, keep your head up. &gt;&gt; They brought me to the room still drugs that they were using. Abig girl know all the drugs. She could tell you some were serious. My high blood pressure was way overdose. They don't know what to do to a point Abigail was even challenging the doctors. Why are you giving this kind of medicines? Because sick kid is number one hospital for children that are born from birth to 18 years is number one in the whole world. So every medicine, every machine they use for humanity s get it number one is the best for children till they get 18. So they have best doctors, best scientific this that but when God call nobody can stop it anyway. &gt;&gt; So Abbe was H talking to the doctors, the medicine that you are giving to my dad is so strong because he knows all the name says why are you doing this? The doctor says no the situation h I have to do it because the situation is so bad. I have to do in another way. I have to do what I have to do. But uh it's like he is not certain about the situation. But God was there and watch. I think who came first Abby? Pastor Simon or brother Mike? &gt;&gt; Um it was it was pastor Simon that came. &gt;&gt; Okay. Pastor Simon came. He have talked with our beloved pastor. They have share ideas and pastor and him because pastor was at work. He couldn't make it. So pastor Simon came as soon as he get there that time I didn't see pastor Simon with sister Simon. He came in my wife. The situation was so serious to a point if you see my wife that time you you won't see that that is sister Mary. Pastor Simmon look at me and said brother Kufi is sleeping. She will wake again. As soon as my wife says he heard that her heart went to rest. That's all he said. But he stayed there for a little while with his precious wife. Pray for me. That time I didn't see nothing cuz I was in a coma. Right. All right. Okay. So, I didn't see nothing. Then the Lord, our sister, sister Alen, uh, brother Mike White, sister Elen, I think with his precious husband, brother Mike, the Lord sent them with the word of God, Psalm 118, to come and read it to me. Why I was when he came they came my eye hasn't opened I don't know nothing I pass out I'm gone they came and read and says brother Kofi will God will overcome all the enemies that are trying to attack they read they pray for me they gone brother Desmond his precious wife sister Elizabeth Okay. All that time I don't think my my body I could even move the body like that. No. Mad Desmond was there. He could say he came and he entered the room and he says captain and first time he says my wife says he came and told my wife I shake my body then the wife says brother Kovi tell my wife as you see you'll be wake and preaching to the people there and they pray they gone. So I was there. It took about uh one week right a week before I could open this eye. But still I wasn't seeing clear because medicine they give me blood. They here they put a a a thing that they will take blood from here because my ribs are high hard to to poke. So they put it here to poke me and get blood from me. I have swallow whole of my body and when my eye open they brought blood broad to give me blood they says I'm shock with broad and I'm also h I feel one word you says to me they said I forgot it anyway H is it if like you are hungry and you didn't eat and sa &gt;&gt; so they said I get also they brought machine they said they have to seal the holes there's a holes in my stomach they have to seal it they came with a machine seal it and they were saying why I wasn't waking up they were saying even if I wake up my brain will not function good so they have to scan the brain. So they took me to go scan my brain and my wife have to sign it twice. they according to the uh medical report my brain will not work good but somehow some somewhere every time they check everything was right because God was in control &gt;&gt; and I came back now I can see my wife my son like you visit me I can see my eye can see you one point my daughter says when I talk I wasn't able to talk even proper because I I couldn't see things uh talk like the way respond very very good but somehow it came back and I was able to talk But believe me, even when my eye open was not easy. I couldn't wake up lay on my back. The IV right they put on me somehow went wrong. This hand, this hand became like this. This hand too has swell up. And every time when in the night my wife will come in the morning she to stay there to help me when is going then I felt sad. There's one thing I want to tell everyone of you. The Lord says, "Husband and wife, what I the Lord have joined together, let no man put a sander because why? They are both one fleshed." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the time. Yes, I love my wife and I know all the scripture. We are in one flesh. I know that. But that time it became reality. serious that yes wives, husbands, love your wife because during that time I tell you the truth, God used my wife. I really saw that the Lord was really using my wife. It wasn't easy on her part to a point I'm looking at her and tears coming because she was going through a lot. Even pastor Simon sometime will call me oh brother Kofi how is Mary doing? I says that time I could talk. I says she's doing fine. says okay I know and I know she she know what he saw that Mary was going through a lot it wasn't easy because when he come and is going my he looked to me I need her I really really it's it's like if he is not there my eye will close and I'll die because That bond was so strong I don't know I can't put west to it. Then I realize my God husband love your wife. Wife love your husband. Clen in two of you clink in to be one flesh with the word. I realized I really need my wife because even though nurse will help you, I love the nurses. They did their part on me but it's not like my wife. So so many things medicine drugs to a point sometime the like if I make my hand like this the drug they will give me is almost full. And I have to drink it once. And sometime when I drink it, my body is still going boom. And my my my daughter, my children, they crying in the womb. The nurses have to come and kick them. And Abigail says, "No, the medicine is too much. Not to for you uh nurses and doctors to give him my my father wants divide it and give him little bit little bit but is too much but what can he say? Emmanuel was so upset when he saw so many medicine they giving me. He says, "Oh, this they're going to heal my father." They and he seen things, but God kept me. Some nurses after my eye is open, they come to me. I don't know there. They told me Kofi, they will mention my name. He says, "I was there when you were gone. I saw it." And thanks. Some of them are Christians, denomination, but not in the message. But at least they know that God has done a miracle. &gt;&gt; They realize God has done a great miracle. Some of them will greet will will even come to me, hug me. I was in the wheelchair. Some will even come rub my head and oh talking with me. They says listen I saw you when there was no life in your body and you came back. I was there. They were I not one. So when they are talking I'm looking at them individually. One man that spoke it struck me. His name was Latana. He says he live in St. Katherine. And he says he came to the room. He was the nurse in charge about me that day. He said when he came I wasn't breathing good. Uh there was like my body was like dead silence. He looked into the table. All he saw was a tablet and something told him to open it. He open it. Something tell him press it and he press it and he left the womb. So when I came back and life and I I could talk he told me he says Kofi I don't know I realize when I press the tablet I know that you are very religious man so I press that tablet for you somehow my wife brought that tablet he knows the way I was every night I prayed a tablet If you don't have one, get wine. When you going to bed, put it on. The message, whether it's brother Brown, whether it's our pastor, whether it's Deson, Phillip, Tim Beer, whoever is preaching, put it on and just go to bed. You never know what the Lord will use it for you. So he press it and he says Kofi I'm happy that you are back alive cuz when I came in there your body wasn't kicking or nothing. And I asked him where does he come from? He said I says I love your name because his name his name is Lana. And he says he's from Polish, Germany and English. His great grandparents were from Poland. They so they moved after the second world war. They move and they came here and born him. So I was thinking back of my mind now I know why this man even he doesn't know that God has used him. Could it be a Jew? I don't know. But that was it. They took me exercise do lot of exercise. the the day Desimon was preaching that time my son Paul Ebiguel Dborah that day they were going to Ghana they came to church here that day that Desmond was preaching one of the nurses came to me is a Filipino lady young lady very skinny and very strong lady strong by working very hard. She came to me, "Oh, you a Christian?" I say, "Yes." "What church you go?" I says, "Good neighbor ministry. Where is it?" I say, "It's in Benton, New Street." Before I knew it, he says, "Today I'm going to put you into the wheelchair. They have a a a incliner, but this one will know incliner. It's something incliner chair chair. So they take machine brought me put me in the machine and the machine will put me in the chair because I can't get up my hand. I can't move it this I can't move it that time. They put me in I'm in the then they roll me to the the studio like the where the nurses their main station where they have a big TV on the wall. Before I know it, Good Neighbor Ministry is on the board like that and I'm looking and before I know it, some nurses has g around me like that and they watching good and they go, "Oh, they see my daughter Ebiguel that time playing that day and they saw Paul playing sassiful. They saw my wife. They already know them because of the situation. They go, "Wow, oh now we know you are very very your family is so into it and oh that's a nice church this that and they were working so they couldn't stay there long." But you know what? You know what came to me? It came to me that if the Lord wanted to do witness without nobody, you open your mouth. When you surrender, he will do the job by himself. If he have to put you to hospital to be a witness to the people, you open your mouth and tell them, he will do it. He used my sickness and nurses were watching good neighbor and commending good neighbor and I was so happy in my heart right what was going on and I said thank you Lord so some of them got to know our church the whole floor people that I didn't know them I don't know them became even friends to me. I show one to pastor Simon. One lady I I he became friends with me and we talk and I show him to pastor Simon. So let me tell you after that all that I went came out come home. Paul Abigail Dborah has gone. I am home with my wife and Emmanuel. Because of the sickness, I could not go to Ghana. But when I came, I cannot eat. So my wife will make me food. When I try to eat it, I vomit. If he give me food, the food I'll vomit. And it was so serious. Early in the morning, my wife make the food. Says, "Brother Kofi, okay, and what do you want?" I said, "Go, honey, go make tea for me." He went downstairs doing the tea and I told Eman, Manuel, I need puddy. So, he go and get me puddy. And while I was eating the puddi, I wasn't feeling good. I told him, "Manuel, call your mommy quick." The mother came sitting on the chair. Mother tried to wake me up. I'm gone. He can't see nothing. As he tried to touch me like that, I just go on the ground. Boom. Gone. Then Emmanuel told Emmanuel call ambulance. And my wife something came on my wife. Abig girl had show his mother how to do a &gt;&gt; CPR. &gt;&gt; CPR. So my wife put that CPR into practice. He don't know but he just failed to do it. She was doing CPR. I wasn't me. I don't know nothing. Doing doing all of a sudden my wife full swag wasn't easy. Crying and doing it. Crying and doing it. All of a sudden, I wake up and I said, "I only my my chest, my chest. I feel so much pain in my chest." And that time the ambulance came and they took me to the hospital again. And while I was in the hospital, then they find out there is a I think water in my loins, right? Is it my loss or the &gt;&gt; say? The first the first time the reason why you went into cardiac arrest was because there was water in your lungs. &gt;&gt; Okay. Sorry to say it was the first time. So there was water in my lungs which they have to drain out. Then they drained the water. They took me also to St. Katherine and cut here and put something like I don't know how you call that. It's like a basically &gt;&gt; camera. It's light small but go through here come here go through my heart and I lay down flat and they put things on me and I look on the TV the doctor in the computer made two machines on me and I could see my stomach everything. They were checking my whole the thing, checking my whole body, my whole uh uh body to see if they could find maybe blood blockage or anything. They couldn't see nothing. So they then they brought me back to Willing Hospital. Then they realized my heart also is low. So they have to put a what do you call spacer? &gt;&gt; Pacemaker. &gt;&gt; Pacemaker. That one they have to take me to Huntington. And they took me to Huntington and cut here and put a peacemaker inside my chest. And I stayed there about two days and they says Kofi once we have put this time for you to go home. And I came home. And when I came home, I tried to everything they tell me, I tried to do it. Till the day I came, I was feeling so good. I said, "Okay, I'm going to come to church." I called pastor, sorry, pastor Danny, I forgot. Sister Pastor Danny with his wife, they came, they pray for me. And let me tell you that prayer wasn't a joke. When your pastor pray for you, you have to believe. If you don't believe, it won't take effect. He prayed for me. And let me tell you, that was the last prayer I received. And that was the last prayer I came out from the hospital. Okay? Because I believe that he was not just talking. He was praying and calling God for me to help me. Cuz during the time of my sickness, he was at work because he's busy at work and he can't leave it. So he communicate back and forth with pastor Simon and with the deacons. And Philillip was a man that the day that I was sick stayed there all night till Sunday morning he came to church. He didn't sleep. People don't know to worship God you have to pay the price. If you don't pay the price you don't get result. I can tell you me brother Kofi and I'm not saying this you go check me since the Lord called me this morning is here this morning is more than me here the time you don't see me in church unless something serious has happened to me or maybe something otherwise rain or sunshine I'm sitting in the house of the Lord and I believe all the preaching I hear sister rosemary know too right I don't take it as joke one time me and brother desa we drove with sister Elizabeth when we were coming the bridge they crossed the oak too much snow too much brothers you remember those days right we have to go under right we reach the church and p told there's no service we went Right? When you are a soldier, Christianity is like a soldier on the battle front. If you sleep, the enemy will kill you. So you don't have to sleep. You have to wake up with your gun sharp. Get ready to shoot the enemy. When the Lord know that you are serious like that, let me tell you what I went through. It took Jesus Christ to come down to wake me up. And if you tell me this is not how the Lord raised Lazarus, then I don't know. I am eyewitness in my time. In my time, &gt;&gt; the Lord has raised me up as he raised Lazarus. Don't let no I know healing is not or raising the dead is not the fullness that won't take you to the rapture. When h the Lord sent the disciples, Judas was among them. They cast out devils, right? So healing is not the main thing but it's part of it. You understand? It give us confidence that we have the talking &gt;&gt; right? It will give you confidence that you have the talking. If the Lord has done this for me, it strengthen me. I know, I have confidence that the Lord has raised me up. Why would he send brother Mike and sister to the hospital to come and read scripture to me? Why would he send them if he if it is not him? Why would he even allow pastor and pastor Simon to come and to the hospital? Why would he allow brother Phillip, brother Desmond, Sister Elizabeth, Rose to come into the hospital? Things that I went through, it was not easy. One point I told the Lord, I said, Lord, if I'm going to die and it going to glorify your name, so be it. I'm ready to go. But if it is not glorify you, then let me come back because you talk about pain. You talk about pain. My leg was my my leg on the floor was like this. One point the next when I'm in the bed like that and they try to get me up to sit and eat, they have to put their hand on my back otherwise I'll fall down. I couldn't walk. I couldn't talk. Sick pain. But I hold to the word of God. I say as if it is taking me, the sickness is taking me to grave. Lord, I'm ready. I'm ready to fight and go in. &gt;&gt; Because we have to be serious with God. When you reach that point, my brother, no, you have it's you and God. You only and him. And believe me, he never fail. God, the Lord Jesus Christ cannot fail because what he he took me through, I'm going to I'm going to finish soon. Let me tell you, I have faith in the Lord. nothing on this head the way I went through even nurses. One doctor came to me, he look at me, he says, "When you were dead, I was right in the womb. I don't know what would take your life. I He says, "I know everybody will die. I know life if if you grow, you're going to die. But you I don't know what can take your life." And I know why he says that. Because for me, I always believe my life belong to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only him can take it. Him gave it to me. Him can take it. &gt;&gt; So and if the devil going to kill me, you have to kill Jesus in brother Kufi first. If he cannot kill that God, the Lord Jesus that live in me, nothing. Have faith in the Lord. He's real. Sister Alen, thank you for coming to the hospital. I really appreciate it with your husband. Brother Desmond, thank you. Brother Philip, thank you. Pastor, sister, thank you for coming. Thank you for all of you praying for me. People pray in Africa. People pray. People calling me I don't even know they heard it. They know some of them even sinners are saying we don't are you well now because now your mouth is is talking big you talking because we heard you were dead but how come you are alive I says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ because in Jesus there is no dead &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the only one Lazarus trust in him Lazarus went to grave four days he raised him up. Brother, sister, have faith in the Lord. &gt;&gt; No matter what happened to you, have faith in the Lord. He will He will make a way when there's no way. I know God made a way for me. He made a way for me. This is reality in my soul. It's not joke. I have seen it. I'm eyewitness. You don't believe me. Come, let's go to the hospital. I have deacons, two deacons sitting here. I have pastor Simon. I have sister here. They saw, they came saw the body the way I was when my eye was not even open. My children were crying. My wife was crying. The whole house has turned upside down. Even my son Emmanuel, he doesn't come to church no more. He know God did a miracle for his father. &gt;&gt; Emmanuel know the Lord did a miracle for his father. Let me tell you is real. This gospel brother Baram preached to us. Let us hold on. Let us back our pastor the best you can. Hold on. Don't take it as a joke. Those that are listening to me in the line. Jesus raised Lazarus. Don't let those things stay in the book. Let it come reality to you that you could express it. You could talk. You could even as I'm going I'm going to Ghana. Let me tell you there are some believers. One preacher called my wife because that time he know I was coming and my wife told him I'm in the hospital. I die and I rose up. So they know brother Kofi was dead and came back. When I go there I don't know what going to happen. The man that was dead is talking like this. Who has done that? Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has done it. The God that brother Brown talked and pastor Danny is speaking, Pastor Simon has spoken to my soul is real. Is real. Is real. Brother sister is real. It's real. is real. The gospel is real. I know you may think I'm too emotion, but no, this is reality. I saw the hands of God. Let me tell you, God brought me back. Now, he has made me whole. He has made me brand new. He has made me perfect. He has made me I don't scared of nothing in life. I'm not scared of anything because I know my God is real. Jesus is real in my soul. Let us all stand up. Pastor, thank you very much. I always back the word and it's so real tonight. That's what I have for you. May the Lord bless each and every one of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. God bless you, my brother. &gt;&gt; God bless you, pastor. I love you. &gt;&gt; Was it three times? &gt;&gt; Three times. &gt;&gt; Three times. So there's three resurrections then. &gt;&gt; Three. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Dead and came back. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The Lord did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Wonderful testimony of the God that we serve. Amen. That uh we can know assuredly that unless it's your time to leave this earth, you could die three times. &gt;&gt; And if it's not your time, you're coming back. Amen. Praise God.
