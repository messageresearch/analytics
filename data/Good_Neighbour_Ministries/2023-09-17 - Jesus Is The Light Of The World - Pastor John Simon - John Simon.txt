happy to be back from our trip to Europe let me thank God for keeping us safe so we are here by the grace of God and I want you to know I'm not here to do the work of an evangelist but I'm here to do the work of a pastor a Shepherd which is to feed lead guide protect and preserve the Sheep of God the flock of God that he has put here with Among Us Praise the Lord so we give him glory and praise for that may the Lord bless you I'll just take my time and go into the word and you will see whether or not you receive something from it and I hear the preach some generalized sermon but we just try to yield ourselves so that the Holy Spirit can minister to each individual their need is that right there's no cookie cutter fate here where it is applies to everybody no God knows you God knows every one of us and so like on the day of Pentecost when he spoke everybody heard it's the same thing the mystery of preaching is that when the word is preached on the the anointing of the Holy Spirit then it goes to the congregation as a whole but to the every single individual that is in that congregation receives something for themselves it is my prayer today that each one of us will receive something from the Lord now these few thoughts were received while I was on the ship and I just kind of wrote them down so if I appeared to be um going back and forth I'm I'm not bringing a lecture or or something of that sort so that you look for um you know order and this and that God has his own order so we will just bring the word and may God bless each one of you today we will want to look into Genesis chapter 1. reading from verses 3 to 5. Genesis 1 3-5 it's on the board so you may read it let's read together and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day now let's go to verse 14 and 18. and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs for seasons for days and years amen let us pray our gracious heavenly father as I stand here father in the Simplicity of ministering your word I am helpless I have nothing of human knowledge that I can add to the people that they can't go pick up in some books somewhere or some computer but father we would ask that the holy spirit will come to us supernaturally and speak to your people and bless your people and lift us up in another dimension where we can recognize that you are the same yesterday today and forever to be to thee be all the glory and the praise as we honor and uplift you in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord amen and amen God bless you please be seated uh what I'm bringing to you here today is just to show you that um that God had here is expressing to us two creations one if you will notice in verses 1 uh to one three to five that God said let there be light and there was light later on he says Let There be lights in the firmament uh uh the moon the Sun the stars and so on let and let them be for this purpose you will know in other words you're breaking into time you'll need them to be able to measure days and seasons and times and so on so the first creation when he said let there be light that was not natural light or else you wouldn't have to go and create another life uh for the world so the first one was Supernatural like that first one was the logos you see that was the logos so then we understand from this friends that God had a an infinite if you want to say creation and he had a a finite one one that was eternal and one that was natural and bounded by time and that one will come to an end now we certainly know when God said let there be light and there was light what was that you must understand from The Book of Revelation but there was war in heaven Michael and his angels had to fight against the devil Lucifer and his angels and say there was a supernatural war going on in the heavens we understand from the scriptures that uh the devil was defeated and he still is defeated I want you to know the Devil is a defeated foe regardless of what trials he brings to you our mind your attention your family or wherever you are he is defeated and he is your football God says you are to make him your football in other words in plain kick him out you are supposed to kick him out of bounds and let the Holy Spirit have his way in your life don't invite him don't encourage him don't sympathize with him poor devil you know but uh you just kick him out of your life don't let him stay or have any place or hold upon your life now when God said let there be light what really that was was uh the logos and the armies of light will release against the Clouds Of Darkness of demons and Devils that were in the world for when they were defeated in the war in the heavens they came down to earth they came right down to earth we know that now we won't go into that because then you'll talk about Dr pember's Earth's earliest ages and how the devil who came down and made his headquarters and and create Havoc again and and then God had to now bring him to a place where he's dominated and replaced him and let man now begin to control and have dominion over the Earth and so he's still jealous to this day that mankind has been given the Dominion which he once had over the entire Earth and he's still considered himself as if he is the God of this world and he's projecting that but he is not anymore because you and I as Jesus said you are Gods you were the ones that are here to dominate over these Devils demons sickness troubled death trial whatever it is you are here for that purpose okay so we understand that God said let there be light so that the light could do what scatter the darkness when the light comes the darkness flees away it cannot stand in the presence of God amen oh praise God I understand your word and I watched it online who had wonderful Services how many of you can say Amen to that I understand in the middle of all this the Lights Went Out Darkness was here amen praise God but thanks be to God God used uh brother Alvin who happened to have two trucks that happen to be outside and and they had generators for his work that he does it just so happens but anyway they had generators so all he did was hook up whatever however he doesn't he's electrician and he knows that so he hooked it up and some lights came on by the grace of God and we all praise God even for a little light is that right we praise God for a very little light oh my goodness reflecting of the darkness that we arrince people were in spiritually waiting for the True Light wedding for the light of the Holy Spirit on the word what we have had down through these ages has been man-made wisdom and knowledge their accumulation of theological knowledge over seven Church ages and they present that inter and teach that in all the seminaries and uh Bible schools I'm not against knowledge I'm not against that type of thing I was in one of those schools I came out of one of those schools because the questions are asking and stuff like that but anyway but just so that you know for her fat brothers and sisters that uh this knowledge the devil is using it it was accumulated over so many centuries and they are going to that depository of knowledge and bringing back that to you and calling that revelation but that is not revelation Revelation is Supernatural deposit that God will deposit in the heart of the believer when they know nothing see God doesn't need your knowledge God doesn't need your wisdom God doesn't need anything from you all it needs is a humble heart all he needs is a surrendered life that he can flow through your life and be a blessing to the world Amen that's all God needs amen because his knowledge is infinite and if you have access to that knowledge then uh you just do all the things that are necessary to survive in this world you need to learn you need to go to school you need to have education but not for him if you look in the Bible just quickly most of those prophets were not educated man some of them couldn't even write their names and yet they would stand up and say oh I looked and I see like chariots moving swifter than horses and they have some big eyes a shining bright they were seeing cars but they weren't educated they could only speak from the what they knew naturally but it was God conveying to them like the Bible says holy man of God wrote and spoke as they were inspired by the Holy Ghost amen so they were they were doing it by inspiration if they gave it by inspiration you must receive it by inspiration you're not just here to sit in church you're not here to warm up you or a puppet but you are here to come in the presence of almighty God that you might receive something from his divine presence the Holy Spirit himself to speak to you out of this word of God Amen Hallelujah glory be to God Amen yes sir you see just like God had to create first when God created man you'll see the same principle in Genesis first God created man when you go back in chapter 3 you see like he's creating man again and then they say the Bible is contradictory they don't understand first he created a spirit man amen a man that was in His image and he's a spirit so it was a spirit man but later on the Bible says but there was no man to till the soil and to take care the garden see now he had to put that Spirit man into a flesh man into flesh that the man might be able to till the soil and that he might be able to do the garden and to do those things you see now I'm saying that it's the same principle God first had to have Supernatural light the logos and then he created the Moon Sun and the stars to be natural light for natural man to be able to see and go about the business of what they have to do amen hallelujah praise God now let's go to Psalm 27 1 if we can have that up on the board you don't mind my taking that time okay praise the Lord psalms 27 1. let's read that together everybody you have a voice right oh so let's all read it together using our voices the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid praise God you see God is your light that Supernatural light was the logos and that light is your life or your salvation the same light because God first has to reveal his word to you reveal himself through the word to you before you can be born again and to be born again means you were born before so how you born again where do you got that from you think it's talking that you were born from your mother you had a natural birth and therefore you can be born again now spiritually no you are born again from the very womb or mind of God from Beyond the foundations of the world and then being born from the mind of God from Beyond the foundations of the world we got lost when we came down or were sent down here to dwell in this atmosphere of Earth and so God had to find how to have a way to bring his children back to himself a real True Believer is not a creature of time they are they come from eternity and they're going back to Eternity uh you must recognize horses bring Fort horses right yeah goats bring forth goats pigs pigs Lambs sheep lambs and and God Burns forth is that right Paul said you are the offsprings of the Almighty if you are the offsprings of the almighty and he is eternal then and you I'm talking about your soul now is has to be eternal it has to be if you are a son or a daughter of God then you have to be eternal then there was no time when you were not and there will be no time when you will not be because you were always in him and you are with him from before the foundations [Applause] of the world that is why God asked job he says job you don't understand where were you when the morning star sang together and the sons of God were shouting for Joy where were you God we're always there so so I'm cutting all of this I'm cutting off pieces here to come to a conclusion here therefore you are not born again on a certain day or a certain year or a certain time correct praise the Lord you come to an epiphany you come to a recognition of who you really are that you are not the son of a Florence Simon you're not the son of Andrew Simon but your real father is the father of Lights you come from God you're going back to God because you come from him you're going back to him this is why the scriptures write so often saying only those whose names are written in the Book of Life the book the Lamb's Book of Life are the only ones that really going to be safe that's not me saying that the Bible is telling you that that your names were already there in his book and we are not here questioning anymore is my name written there no you recognize and that's why the Seven Seals were given to open up and reveal to us and make you certain of God that your name is in his book amen and God reveals it to you I am his child I am his child to be born again or to come to a new birth is to recognize who you really are and the Holy Spirit how do you do that by the spirit the spirit of God drazing away the darkness brought to you by theology by tradition by false religion by false Faith all these things driving away the fuckiness and the Darkness and the questionings or wondering uh how did this happen how did that happen where did I come from where am I going uh all these questions you're doubting you you try this church you run to the other Church run over here run over there it's the your soul inside searching to find oh praise God you're searching to find your father your children to find the truth of God's word no no man can give that to you only the Holy Spirit can give that to you [Applause] praise the Lord the spirit of God make causing you to recognize who you really are amen the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear amen praise God hallelujah you understand that this love goes first appeared as Melchizedek in the form of a man which was foreshadowing that one day it will become a man or be in a man and we know that man we recognize his name is Jesus Christ John chapter 1 let's read that again one to ten such just so you think I'm not just I'm just talking my own feelings it's in your book amen John chapter 1 reading from verse 1 to 10. in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God see the word was with God but then God said let there be light and that word went out and it went out in what form it became light it became light today we know it as gospel like the revelation of the word that goes out to lighten what Jesus said it to lighten the life of every man and woman that is in this world if they want it they can receive that light it's the shine into their hearts in all the dark places of your heart all the places amen praise the Lord and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was what the light of man praise the God hallelujah light for your soul not not sunlight but s-o-n light Heavenly Sunshine Heavenly Sunshine flooding my soul with Glory Divine Heavenly Sunshine Heavenly Sunshine Hallelujah Jesus is mine that's what it is all about God's light shining into the dark places of our hearts so God came in the form of a man Jesus Christ who rose up and said John 8 12 I am the light of the world praise God he's not saying that he's the son but the light of the entire universe the light of the spirit Realm praise God hallelujah so we understand that that is what it is and he sheds light not on the plants outside and the animals on the Earth but upon those who are willing to receive him he sheds light into their soul praise God hallelujah glory to God Amen that light that appeared in Genesis 1 later we understand was the same Pillar of Fire that came above Israel and gave them light by night and A Cloud by day over them praise the name of the Lord I want you to know that that if he was here he would say I am that Pillar of Fire I am the light of the world I am the seven golden candlesticks that were shining in the temple praise the name of the Lord Jesus I am the Seven Stars of Revelation 1. that shine out through these seven Messengers you know what it is you had said uh would you place that back up brother the design up there seven Church ages starting from the bottom with the Jesus Christ himself and Then followed by Paul followed by Martin Luther Columbus Luther We Believe Wesley and we believe in this age followed by the 20th century prophet brother William Marion brabham and that God just used him as a vessel we are not preaching and teaching you about the man we're just telling you what the Holy Spirit did through a man and use them for the glory of God and he said it long after I'm gone they're going to say all kinds of things but they're going to recognize that God had a prophet walk amongst them the Jews received their prophets the Gentiles had none and so God had to send a 20th century Prophet according to Malachi 4 5 behold I'll send unto you Elijah the prophet who will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers amen and praise God turn us back to the original faith that was there in the Bible praise the name of the Lord so we thank God for that Glory To His Marvelous name so we find out today what's happening people are following a lot of glares they're following anything that looks shiny it it looks like the real thing and it's not for all I know you can even have false coins in your pocket false money uh counterfeit stuff that's printed up that the devil has out there and you don't recognize it amen but God has the real true light he said I am the True Light he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but he shall have the light of life his light will lead your life and lead you through all the darkness that is in this present world that we are living in praise the name of the Lord may God help every one of us as we walk with him praise God and follow him who do you think that great star you know scientists have said the Christmas star they realize that there's three stars came together to make one great big star that the Wise Men followed and we understand that that star was shining leading the wise man to Christ that was in the manger isn't that funny how God brings his word the god of Heaven comes down condescending a human body and he's not born in a palace he doesn't go to kahaifa's the high priest to recognize him he doesn't go to the king and say move out to your Palace I'm greater than you I'll take you no he comes born in a manger God hides in simplicity God hides himself in Simplicity and he reveals himself also in simplicity so when you're looking for these high and mighty things or Dr so-and-so said listen um your great Theologian spoke to me you know I studied hermeneutics and apologetics and you know eschatology and pedagogy and so on so on like that oh it impresses people or that guy knows something he really knows you know that man's a doctor that man is a dumb dog do you know that he has a bad attitude he has all kinds of these so-called degrees and he doesn't recognize that he's missing the supernatural element the supernatural element any woman knows she bakes a cake and she leaves out one part you leave out the sugar you lose out leave out the yeast or whatever thing all you got is a big lump of dough and a big heavy lump I'm sorry to be talking like this you know but that's that's the way I speak um because you missed there's a missing ingredient and that's what's happened in the world today and all the churches around us I'm not saying we're the only ones right because God is teaching men and women around the world wherever they are but the fact is that element is missing they they're caught up with systems of learning of religious learning religious education they're caught up with theology they're caught up with uh denominationalism they caught up with Traditions they caught it with rituals they caught up with all kinds of things except coming back to the original word of God and let not the Theologian that not me or anybody but let God be his own interpreter and he will make it plain God will declare himself by the opening of the word and you recognize that it's him taking the word and making you know who he is God being his own interpreter amen glory to God so we know then of on the day of Pentecost what really happened is not so much the tongues but the fact is that the Holy Spirit came down upon them and revealed to them who they really are reveal to them who their father is and they recognize it and in their excitement they began to speak and and talking and tongue slot out of them I speak in tongues but privately you know I don't go you don't have to go around and get out there speaking in tongues for people to teach is spiritual spirit of God will flow through you and be a blessing to the world and that's what we are here to to do and that's where what you are here to be and let us all shine our lights and brighten our little corner wherever God places us God bless you in a position light up that corner for his glory that doesn't mean going around with a big Bible saying I am a Christian you know and you are not you know no no no you don't just live the life God wants you to live amen just be full of these virtues full of the love of God brotherliness kindliness the grace of God that will shine out of your life because that's him in you shining out through you you are just the Veil praise the Lord and praise God a lot of these things I'm saying is not even what I notes I have here because the fact is we are the there's so much I can say we are the badger skins the Bible speaks of in the temple because you are not the Temple of the Living God Lives in You by faith and the veil hides the the light from the candlesticks and the pillar of fire that was back of that veil was hidden behind the veil and so uh we are the badger skins so your skin color don't matter to God whether it's a sheepskin gold skin whether it's a whatever skin black yellow brown white skin it was skins that made up that Veil that was six inches thick and no light can go through it until God Jesus was crucified on Calvary amen which was a symbol that now the veil was rent opened up and now we are able to look in and behold the glory of God Amen the great Shining Light of the spirit of almighty God was able to make itself known to the world Amen praise God and he still lives do you believe it he still is making himself known to the world in this day that we are living in praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God God bless you sons of Light Daughters of light children of light walking in the light of God's word for this day amen hallelujah amen now you got you notice that monkeys love things that Glitter and shiny and I love those shiny things and Ravens they like to steal ladies don't mistake and put your wedding band near the window because some of these birds like Ravens they're attracted by that and it's honest to goodness they do they'll pick that thing up steal it and put it in their nest and carry it away like that and that's the same thing people you have church memberships now and they're looking for a great big Tabernacle uh you know they're looking for a fantastic building they're looking for scholarly pastors they're looking for men with degrees that can blast on this wall and they're looking for man that can you know speak and like an angel and then sing like anything they're just looking for all those kinds of things and their minds gone away to get to the sincere original truth out of the word of God back to the word to the original faith back to what God wants us to be and to recognize him amen that he is Lord of all I am God he says be beside me there is none of none else I'm the only one none beside me non-belorming on beside me everywhere there is no such a thing as a trinity that's a lie from the pits of hell it's not in your Bible the devil used into inferences in the Bible like zero he says father son Holy Ghost he's referring to the titles that he himself holds amen I am the father I'm a son and I'm a human being doesn't make me treat people I'm the same person that I am that's exactly what it is and that's how God is God the great father of all wanting to redeem his sons and daughters created a body for himself that's why Jesus says it's the father that dwells to me he do it the works God wasn't Christ reconciling the world himself created a body for himself got in that body did the work of redemption to bring us back to him aren't you happy that he offered himself as a Living Sacrifice to bring us back to himself I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I recognize Who I Am by the grace of God Amen so get away from all these shiny things that you see out there and let God have his way light is a beautiful thing how many of you recognize the qualities of Life uh just to talk about a few of it light is a a wonderful thing you know because a light revives and restores it brings life you know you have plants I'm not talking about rubber plants silk flowers I'm talking about real flowers those ones can live in any darkness and they can Thrive without any light but real plants have to have light amen and if you're a son or a daughter of God you can be going to a church but you really can't come into the fullness of who you are supposed to be unless you come on the light real light streams of everlasting light from the presence of almighty God to shine upon you amen thank God it's the rising of the sun amen praise God not the son out there but the Son of God shining upon us with his mercy and light upon us amen God's changing his bright shining light of wisdom and understanding no wonder he said a greater than Solomon is here The Book of Proverbs do you know that's the wisdom of Solomon Solomon speaking as a natural man with the heights of human wisdom God allowed that to be included in the Bible here and he's telling you that even that are greater than Solomon is here praise the Lord who is greater the wisdom of God reflecting for a man produce that now God's speaking through his own son or the body he created call it a son and spoke through it for his glory and what more can we ask for than to receive that from the presence of God wonderful praise the name of the Lord Jesus we give him all the praise all the honor and the glory amen praise God now God's light of man's you know I don't know about you but I received a a light bill the other day and I had to look twice because the cost of the light bill I don't know about your light bill but my goodness if you forgot one light on and let that thing keep running all day the next thing you know when the light bill comes it's way up there you're wondering what's going on see man's light you always got to pay for somehow whether the man is in the Pulpit say giving you light what is in a masonic Lord say he's given you light whether he is a rustic Christian or whatever he is or conspirator or he says he's giving you light uh you got to pay for that light but God's light is free the sun just shines you don't hear a booming voices now you must pay they go and they get solar light and then they go make money off of it right it's God's light and he just gave it free give the water free give the breeze you you're breeding free and any day he wants he can just stop it like he told job he says what are they talking about I can just tell the snow to just flood the whole place and they can't move nothing can happen all right and that's one thing God is God do you believe that amen he can dry up the ocean and turn the Sahara Desert into a into a sea he can do whatever he wants because he is God and we must trust him and believe him praise the Lord amen look I'm talking about him but he is here his presence is here we can't see him with our eyes but the one whom we serve by faith and believe in our hearts that that person is in our midst and we believe him with all our hearts and if we believe him one day there'll be a Rapture and we'll see him face to face and tell the story saved by the grace of almighty God not by my wisdom my my knowledge my effort of training to be a Christian but being empowered by the Holy Spirit to be what he wants me to be praise the name of the Lord I I'm going to try to say a little more and then let you go because as much I can stay say but praise God light is also a revealer because you may be walking on a dark path and you're walking and there's a pressing piss in front of you and you don't know it but if you had light shining you'll know where it is to avoid it you see light is a revealed it reveals to you also an enemy hiding in the bushes waiting with a hammer to hammer you but when you have light it reveals that enemy that's why the devil fears revelation he doesn't he's not scared of the Bible itself because he reads this do you know what the devil reads this you know the devil believe the Bible more than some of these people so there's no God and the Bible says the Devil Himself believes and he believes it's sincerely so much that the Bible says he trembles right he trembles because he knows the truth but he he's just the father of Lies he got to keep lying all the time I like that but so we find out friends that he can be hiding to try to Ambush you but the light of God will always reveal him to you and you'll recognize him and be able to get away from him amen praise the name of the Lord it will reveal to you these things unseen dangers Hallelujah reveal to you all this all kinds of lurking enemies you know also Darkness brings to you fear you're in darkness and you've gone into Fair why because you're uncertain of what to do and the devil wants to keep you in darkness so your your your your uncertain of who God is what should his children be like how should they live but I'm here to tell you be certain of God amen let the light of God shine into your heart amen so you can know what it is that you are doing praise God hallelujah when you're in darkness any little shadow you know I I told this to the church before when I was a boy I woke up early one morning when you know it's still dark and shadowy and I saw a man standing in the room oh my God like a a burglar or some I I start perspiring I'm not ashamed to tell you that uh in the instant I start perspiring I was fearful uh you know waiting for this man to make his move and I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for and he's not moving and then as the sun came up the light streamed Through the Windows only to see my father's pants on his shirt and on top of the he placed his hat ah so there were they in fear where no fear was needless fares and often we are in that situation of needless fears we're walking in a state of where we are like that so Darkness brings to us uncertainty it brings fear to us all kinds of Shadows and all kinds of fantasies now start coming to your mind monsters and whatever else you start to imagine because of the darkness but when the light is shining bright and everything else you can see where you're going what's all around you nothing can move without your seeing your fear is gone from you amen may God send the light of his word into your hearts today and drive away every fear from your heart every doubt from your soul and recognize your position in Christ amen yes sir Hallelujah you're walking in darkness you're walking having anxiety maybe you're here you're having anxiety I had it when I was a boy too I have to refer to this coming home after watching the movie Dracula and and it ended late and uh there was a graveyard that was a mile long and the road went right through the middle of the graveyard and my home was on the other side there's no way to get around that you must go through amen and so I'm walking well you know look how short I am when I was 10 years old recognize how short I was there and at that time I saw some adults going on the same road so I ran up a little bit close enough to them so as they walk I would walk and as they were walking but my feet were so short I couldn't keep up and the distance got further and further so all I can do is put my hands in my pocket and I'm whistling like I'm not scared and I'm whistling that's the way this world is we're in perilous times now trouble sometimes are here and the world is like whistling in the dark insane institutions are filled Insanity all around anxiety depression oppression is everywhere this is not a question or a matter of debate it's here everywhere people's nerves are on edge you get in the roads with the car and the nerves on edge you're walking and they're nerves on the edge you know all the time it's because they're walking in darkness but when a son a daughter a child of God is Walking In The Light of Life walking in the light of God's spirit and of God's word it lights up their life it gives them certainty they walk in confidence they walk knowing god is walking with them because he promised I'll never leave you alone praise be to God hallelujah amen God is good isn't he praise His name glory to God let me move on here now do you know that revelation tells us Revelation 21 to be exact could you put that up brother 21 23 to 27. I'm stretching this out because I want to keep you a little longer so you can receive some more of the word I could just keep talking and not give you the scriptures or say anything like that but I want to see it's not me saying it just saying it it's there in the Bible and the city had no need of the son what is this light that's going to be in the city the same light that was in rev Genesis 1. as it was in the beginning so shall it be I am the alpha I am the Omega I am the beginning I am the End Amen without me there is no other he is the Everlasting God amen yes sir praise God the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine on it for the glory of God lightened it and the lamb is that light is the light thereof you see God the logos himself he is the light that is the light that leads the true sons and others of God and he said I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness amen you will not walk around with the lack of understanding you will not walk reading your Bible with not having the spirit of Revelation you will not go out there uh thinking you have to have endless Bible studies to get to know God Amen praise the Lord you just fellowship with your father get close to him and you'll begin to know him more and more is that right praise the Lord my dad was alive I sit on his knee and he'd talk to me and I talked to him praise the Lord that's the same thing we go in prayer we go in the presence of God and we just talk to him praise God prayer is not something where you go and you have a real official prayer oh God I come to thee no Heavenly Father you're so good you're so kind you're wonderful I thank you so much that you remembered me millions billions have gone before my time but yet you remembered me amen oh that love of God filling and flooding the human heart to recognize that we are one with him we come from him we're going back to him and that's what he's here for the spirit of God is crying out and calling calling to his sons and daughters to come home come home why it's wedding supper time praise the Lord time to come home into the presence of God revelation 22 3-5 and there shall be no more curse but the Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it and his servants Shall Serve him and there they shall see his face and his name shall be in their forage I won't talk about that for it says no man see God and live but is turning wrong and saying that these sons and daughters going to see God's face and they're not going to die they're going to live and it's simple just to know because they come from him when they are one with him and they are part of him they can see his face and if you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God you will see the word you'll recognize every word of it if I a true son and daughter of God sitting here today and the moment I just move if I move off of the true revelation of that word like that something in here John 1 says you have a witness this is not by comparison comparing scripture with scripture which you you should do but it's not that if you have a witness a supernatural witness within you is that right and and that's the he is the teacher is that right he's giving you what he's giving you uh inside teaching um to use a human term he gives you intuition you know tuition means teaching so so the spirit of almighty God is now teaching us uh his himself teaching us to recognize who he is that he is not just a God in the sky but he is your father he is your father not just using the terms Loosely really here's your father amen your parents only brought forth this natural outer man that will pass away and die but the soul Eternal on the inside came from God and it must go back to God because it's Eternal being that's in a body of time and when it drops that body it rises to go back absent from the body present with the Lord hallelujah isn't that wonderful to know we are one with him praise the name of the Lord you know the natural Sun can only shine on half of the Earth at one time when it's a light over this way it's Darkness on the other side but this light when it shines it covered the entire universe it's everywhere because it's God there's nowhere where God isn't there it's already there praise the Lord and we thank God for that in the same way in the book of Acts when that light shine in the book of Acts and and Peter and his Apostles begin to speak they say but how here we every man in our own language they were hearing those men who are speaking in known languages right praise God and some of those people didn't speak those languages and other ones did but they heard everyone in their own language see when God speaks his voice is universal let's say the God was just being here today and speak to all of us every one of us would hear regardless of what language we our culture or background we're from we've it all here because he is God and his voice will come forth to bless each and every one of us amen praise the name of the Lord glory to his wonderful name so the darkness in the church ages we were blessed by the lives of these seven Messengers spoken of seven stars in his right hand revelation 1. because stars reflect the light of the sun after the sun is dead or gone down and so these Messengers or men anointed of God were used to reflect the light and truth of God's word off of the throne back into the darkened Church age that we might have some light to live with but then Paul died and the church went into later on into what we call the Dark Ages how many knows about that it went into the Dark Ages this is not I'm not making this up it's right there um but now in the Dark Ages and during this Dark Ages God still had he never leaves himself without a witness as one scripture God never leaves himself without the witness so even in the Dark Ages he had a few men a few people here and there that he would reveal himself too and there were like star lights reflecting his light back into the church age and being a blessing to the people amen but now we know the church ages have come to an end praise God but then Here Comes what the messenger from heaven the Holy Spirit himself come to interpret his own word and I've said it like this before um when we were in school we see a young lady that we really like and we give our friends a note and take this note to her all right because we don't have the courage to to go and take the note of ourselves so we give him the note and let him take it to her and she'll read it and some we this is what we were trying to avoid some some of the girls were just and that's like a bad feeling to that guy to know he's rebuffed like that but if he wrote the note and she read it didn't say anything sends another note read it doesn't say anything send another note she reads it again and she's giggling okay things looks like it's all right now so what's he going to do at that point you think he's sending a note again with his friend no no no no no no he he is now going to approach her himself and that's what I'm trying to tell you God has done he sent prophets he sent Messengers down Through the Ages bringing his word to his people but now is the time just before the rapture when he is coming in he has come in person he's appearing preparing for his physical coming Supernatural appearing preparing for his physical coming and appearance right so he comes to her and approaches her himself and that's what he's doing to you now by revealing his word to you is trying to let you get to know him the Unseen god making himself through the opening of the word he's here now as the day star from on high not one of those seven stars but he is the day star from Mannheim bringing Heavenly sunshine and shining his light within our hearts and flooding our souls with his glory Divine praise God I know you read about Gideon how many of you ever read about Gideon in the Bible I'm going to wind this up now so don't get nervous that I'm going to keep you till midnight like Paul did but even if I did on your fell out the window I will have to raise you up is that right praise God at least I'll try about a God give me the ministry preach the word I don't know he gave me the ministry to raise the dead but anyway so Gideon had this what did God tell him he says get some lights put them inside of the picture these are all types and shadows speaking of you and I like I said but the light behind your body's skin right he had The Light Within These um little containers like that and then God said at a certain time when it's necessary for the drive away your enemy and go fight them a sudden light break the pictures amen and when you break that picture the lights begins to shine amen and when the light shines the enemy wants to flee from it right so you know that let me put it up down to earth way not that you're living in a house that wraps roaches unlock all kinds of stuff like that but you know that if the room is in darkness you turn on that light watch them rats run watch them they're running everywhere spiritual is the same thing happen casting out Devils is really casting out on belief out of the hearts of men praise the Lord yeah it's nice to say that but I've I've cast out living Devils right there right in the presence of God I had some run out the church because the word of God preaching the truth coming forth he can't take it and and just come out some run to the bathroom and they vomit up all on the floors in the church because the holy the devil wants to come out he's hearing the word he knows it's the word he recognizes that the truth of the word of God you know it don't take you to to make me look like I'm a devil master I'm a miracle man you are a man of power no no no no that's not you want to hide the true sons of God wants to get out to the scene and get the people to look away to Jesus so you see Jesus only see his face alone recognize he is Lord of all and we are just Sons and daughters Servants of the Living God Amen Hallelujah how wonderful praise the name of the Lord you know that song let's come come brother I'm going to stop here because I can keep talking like this and we can go from word to word to word to word it's Eternal God's word is really Eternal praise the name of the Lord when I was young I didn't need notes right I didn't need notes whatsoever I would just speak and speak and speak and speak um like that but now I I got to put down the thoughts that he gives me so I I don't forget them and then when I get home I said oh my goodness I I didn't say this I didn't say that I forgot this I forgot that no that's the reason why I have notes Here praise the Lord but um I could be uh or I was like you know maybe like brother
