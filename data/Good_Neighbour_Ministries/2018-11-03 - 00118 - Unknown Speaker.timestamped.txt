[0:00] many times to temporarily forgotten that
[0:06] all things are in divine order in our
[0:10] eyes and therefore give up because
[0:13] things were not happening according to
[0:16] human expectations how often have you
[0:21] misinterpret your divine purpose and
[0:24] found yourself spinning in circles
[0:27] because we refuse to acknowledge and out
[0:30] divine inspiration come on the truth the
[0:42] truth and these are all powerful signs
[0:57] that you have been suffering of
[1:00] selectively spiritual amnesia a
[1:05] temporary forget under divine truth
[1:08] think upon selectively thinkin you can
[1:12] actually select them put on yourself
[1:15] spiritually jump by yourself while you
[1:20] do it
[1:22] believe in yourself to God's purpose
[1:32] we gained our memory and we discovered
[1:36] from select the spiritual Asia is the
[1:39] first image we re covering your divine
[1:43] guidance who is guiding you is to take
[1:48] the time to go inward our sister divine

[2:11] that the inspired spiritual desire to a
[2:17] Thursday figure such a powerful take
[2:21] that you bring your mind into such a
[2:24] place of spiritual denial of the word of
[2:28] God and speak things that there is no
[2:35] bleep they got Satan's drink last spring

[3:11] rule over the world taking about what he
[3:14] said there obviously again a man or
[3:18] woman that the Lord or old or his spirit

[11:29] I mean we all are good we could talk
[11:33] with denominations

[11:56] they have forgotten all these things
[11:58] they don't understand
[11:59] it anymore we must be with the disciples

[12:08] identified with Peters sermon on the day
[12:10] of Pentecost in acts 2 I heard what he
[12:13] said I believe what he said I don't hate
[12:15] what he said I'm now I'm identified the

[16:58] going through this white light why are
[17:00] the situation why do I have these drugs

[17:08] it's because God reveals to us
[17:11] step-by-step semesters revealed the
[17:14] whole thing to you when he revealed one
[17:15] step and sometimes you think is so
[17:17] simple sometimes you think all this item
[17:21] or a more spiritual just listen to that
[17:45] one step all the way it couple of
[17:48] yourself just refer to it and he'll
[17:50] review the next step and then he walked
[17:54] into your deliverance
[17:55] if you be walking to victory that's how
[17:59] Bulls Saints God tests us and tries us
[18:04] the secret belief we're not going to
[18:12] take it off we're not breaking not need
[18:16] your help
[18:18] enough upon us because sudeesh walked
[18:21] under these were this world here to to
[18:24] partake in this world and any form
[18:27] whether you do it like desire or not
[18:30] that spirits here and it's we're not
[18:34] immune to it none of us is immune to it
[18:37] but our defense our we got is the Word
[18:43] of God by staying in the Word of God
[18:49] I'm just going to pull us off here I got
[18:52] a lot more to say I'm just going to
[18:53] continue this series closed off with a
[18:57] couple of things maybe doing remembers
[19:42] we are the corner of Sunday pursue
[19:50] growth finally we need to develop a
[19:53] hundred forgotten we are to be intent
[19:57] with what we have the two materially but
[20:02] we should never be content with where we
[20:07] are spiritually our desire should always
[20:10] be to learn more about God and an
[20:13] experience more of his power in our life
[20:15] and to serve Him more fully the moment
[20:19] you feel that you have arrived
[20:21] spiritually you become a clear shot for
[20:25] the devil's arrows when you feel you are
[20:28] strong enough you begin standing on your
[20:31] own strength rather than his and that
[20:35] makes you bonneville read widely read
[20:40] dig deep keep learning we used to
[20:45] measure yourself by how you compare to
[20:48] others people think of some spiritual
[20:53] other words make their standards of
[20:58] comparison to Jesus fenders and you
[21:01] won't have to worry about the feeling
[21:03] that you have arrived it's not the truth
[21:06] defending yourself to Jesus not anybody
[21:09] else competitor month the Bible says
[21:12] Paul says is Carla and how many times
[21:17] now we compare ourselves spiritually I
[21:20] can create that up great is good
[21:22] and I read and I know the word just
[21:24] question I can fellowship what the work
[21:26] is much said but you're better south of
[21:30] Jesus you'll have a problem anymore it
[21:34] should always fall short as we get older
[21:43] we will remember everybody's thinking
[21:48] in fact we forget lots of things some
[21:56] memory loss comes with the territory but
[21:58] we must work hard come back and fight to
[22:04] spiritual memory loss there's too much
[22:08] at stake here
[22:09] and if you are ever struck down with
[22:12] awful disease and peace away at your
[22:15] mind leaving you helpless go fret the
[22:18] disease may take you from some memory of
[22:23] those promises Network but rest assured
[22:26] he will never forget
[22:32] and interchange book vocalization shows
[22:37] that the energy sphere would come into
[22:40] the church and the Bartlett at making
[22:43] lukewarm making horrible and bothers
[22:46] that that was the pike that we're
[22:49] fighting today each and every individual
[22:51] walk it exposes the Satan that reveals
[22:55] his works his attempted destruction on
[22:59] cos people and discrediting the Word of
[23:03] God I hope that's what's happening
[23:06] tonight exposing him break down the time
[23:11] he's cast in the lake of fire he fights
[23:14] the church the bride he cannot stand it
[23:19] I'm telling you tonight if you receive
[23:23] the work
[23:30] every situation circumstance in front of
[23:33] you and even your own self working on
[23:38] your self your own pride
[23:41] your interpretation to put blocks inside
[23:46] you you can't stand it can extend the
[23:51] meeting every time to work instead
[23:53] because why walk because you might
[23:58] receive something that will destroy take
[24:02] up a good luck and set you free
[24:08] we're here together we're here as a body
[24:13] of Christ we're here together Saints he
[24:17] has not going to be on three job or what
[24:22] no I'm here with you fighting together
[24:27] you are my brother you're my sister like
[24:31] he loved my keeper he if I don't care
[24:37] for you in love for you in that way and
[24:39] I
[24:39] to get back in my spirit I see too many
[24:48] people always need myself the devil who
[24:50] works on people so much over and over
[24:53] all to myself I just going to worry
[24:56] about myself like they have this same
[24:59] thing I've not said they can elicit
[25:00] their on their disobedience
[25:02] well sometimes you can't go around
[25:03] certain people that are under certain
[25:05] conditions but you can't read you can't
[25:09] read woke up some people are danger at
[25:17] times they're in danger they don't even
[25:19] thought I might be in danger but God
[25:23] might reveal to you I'm in danger that
[25:25] I'm a cop of so many things it's all
[25:29] possible things God reveals it to you I
[25:35] know
[25:45] my brother's keeper he fights that he
[25:50] cannot stand it
[25:51] he knows that of the people this is the
[25:53] church age world get a true revelation
[25:56] of the true church and what she is what
[26:00] she stands for and that she can do the
[26:06] greener works she will be invincible if
[26:12] they get a true revelation of the two
[26:16] spirits working in the framework of the
[26:19] Christian Church and by God's Spirit
[26:21] desert would stand and by spirit Satan
[26:27] becomes populace
[26:45] status vital decisions come off into
[26:49] God's Word what we not speaking to
[26:58] myself to come often
[27:01] every day every memory expert tells you
[27:08] that the key to remember the person's
[27:10] name is to repeat it up when you first
[27:17] when you are first introduced now look
[27:22] at the natural type of spiritual
[27:25] repetition helps memory that's what type
[27:31] of spiritual we need to come back to
[27:35] God's Word again and again and again
[27:39] God's Word gives us the perspective that
[27:44] we need we need to remind ourselves of
[27:48] God's truth God commands God's standards
[27:54] set aside specific disability type
[27:58] everyday to read your Bible write down
[28:01] what you learn memorize key verses
[28:04] high-tops truth deep in your heart
[28:07] worship regularly not that you just come
[28:11] to church worship all the time
[28:38] why would they do that they want a Great
[28:42] Awakening they're crying believing that
[28:47] there will be an awakening they are good
[28:50] people
[28:51] why is it what have they done they have
[28:56] not recognized the wakening of the bride
[29:02] you see he's singing here the church a
[29:07] swamp the people are looking for a Great
[29:10] Awakening out there but they're not
[29:13] recognizing that the bride has been
[29:16] awakened
[29:17] she has been awakened you and I was up
[29:23] to question here today the influence of
[29:29] the Word of God
[29:30] deepen the amnesia keep the memory
[29:33] diseases that you didn't see needs
[29:39] instead sin means I believe keep the sin
[29:44] he kept illegally learn away from you
[29:47] [Music]
[29:49] and be the Christian they feel the cold
[29:53] yeah
[29:53] but they haven't recognized what's been
[29:56] done
[29:58] something has been done and what has
[30:03] been done can never be preached by that
[30:05] the Seventh Seal was kept under
[30:13] revelation that's why 23 to seven
[30:18] Silver's doesn't ever really
[30:19] he was his pocket because it's hidden
[30:22] and only revealed to the bride but
[30:26] something ended up something had been
[30:29] done in your hearts something in the
[30:31] done your walk
[30:32] God the great work that you and he said
[30:37] he pressing on deep breathing no stop
[30:40] the lay into you
[30:44] everything will be thrown at you a key
[30:48] in the world
[30:50] [Music]
[30:55] they're saying something this must
[30:57] happen but they look at it part way on
[31:00] the future to come you know those ugly
[31:04] in the message to be looking for these
[31:05] prophecies wait a future with the
[31:07] company right now they're happening to
[31:10] make your heart the Spirit of God which
[31:17] is the word of God I weren't a spirited
[31:20] like we'll put the bride in her place
[31:25] the preacher but the Spirit of God the
[31:30] Word of God will put the bride in her
[31:32] place causes she recognizes because she
[31:37] recognizes her position in the work that
[31:40] she's in Christ
[31:47] she recognizes her position in the word
[31:51] [Music]
[31:53] that she is in Christ you see our part
[32:00] of the Saints but not beat one of your
[32:06] faith is I can never do that anyways we
[32:09] gotta think is faith
[32:12] well she recognizes her position this is
[32:18] how where it's too late there's a lot
[32:23] more I can say a little bit more but
[32:26] this hours too late when we look to the
[32:29] Word of God when we look at the truth
[32:31] that's another truth who Steven sit here
[32:32] to make our identity who we are
[32:39] recognizing our position our worship
[32:44] that we are Christians not church
[32:46] members but we are bride that's supposed
[32:50] to produce this unlike not just the
[32:55] fruit of the Spirit my light I hear
[32:58] tonight the death light also side
[33:00] identity that we live is that I live my
[33:03] hand up there was in psyche that's
[33:05] what's taking place he's recognizing
[33:07] that that was going on in her life she
[33:11] recognizes our position in the work she
[33:13] recognized her
[33:15] [Music]

[33:20] today recognizing as they are realizing
[33:25] what is also they have amnesia
