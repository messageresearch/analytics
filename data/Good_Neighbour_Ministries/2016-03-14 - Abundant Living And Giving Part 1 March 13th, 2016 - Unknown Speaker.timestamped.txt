[0:00] you know and and people are getting
[0:02] excited about gold I believe the Gold's
[0:05] gonna go up Way Beyond what it was not
[0:10] long ago here at 18 or 1900
[0:13] because we're going up okay
[0:17] and we're going to be walking on streets
[0:22] over here it's going to become the most
[0:26] valuable most precious thing on Earth
[0:28] because people are putting their trust
[0:32] in the dollar right in gold
[0:35] in value
[0:38] there's no richer Rich than the richness
[0:42] that you've received through the word of
[0:43] God amen amen
[0:48] this world is not my
[0:50] life
[1:14] foreign
[2:17] let us come tomorrow
[2:27] songs
[3:23] yeah
[3:25] this one
[3:39] friends come up
[3:41] welcome Pastor sir
[3:52] you are being blessed I'm embracing and
[3:56] giving glory to God Amen Lord richly
[3:58] bless you for being here today and may
[4:01] he take his word and bless us amen
[4:04] praise the Lord shall we uh turn to the
[4:07] word
[4:10] let's read from Mark chapter 12 verses
[4:14] 41-44
[4:21] house of the Lord
[4:23] and let's pray for the safety of those
[4:25] who are of their March 3. Mark 4
[4:30] 1 to 44.
[4:35] it's a story about a widow
[4:39] of sorry 12. what am I looking at
[4:50] Mark 12. I just took a glance now I saw
[4:54] it forward
[5:02] and Jesus said
[5:05] over against the treasury
[5:08] and beheld how the people cast money
[5:13] into the treasury Discerning their
[5:15] bodies
[5:20] and many that were Rich cast in much
[5:24] and there came a surgeon for Will and
[5:28] she Drew in two nights
[5:35] and he she called unto him his disciples
[5:40] and sell them to them look look look
[5:42] rarely I say unto you
[5:44] that this poor Widow had cast more in
[5:49] them all Faith which cast in to the
[5:53] treasure
[5:54] right
[5:56] for all David casting of their abundance
[6:00] but she of our want did cast in all that
[6:06] she had even all her living
[6:09] father will be come once again
[6:12] for this teachable moment
[6:15] asking the blessing of the Holy Spirit
[6:18] and that he the great teacher will take
[6:21] the word and apply it to our hearts
[6:25] that we may grow nearby in Jesus name
[6:27] amen Lord bless you please be safe
[6:33] some of you may not know it but
[6:36] on a Wednesday night I started on a
[6:39] series this church ship of life
[6:43] the stewardship of life talking about
[6:47] life and living
[6:49] and how we are to manage our own lives
[6:53] by the grace of God
[6:56] however it seems like a lot of people
[7:00] let the Christians they love to get into
[7:04] a lot of tea things
[7:07] they like to get into
[7:09] the mysteries of God
[7:12] and the deeper Revelations of God which
[7:15] is wonderful and we ought to know future
[7:19] things which theologians calls
[7:21] eschatology
[7:22] prophecy we need to get into all those
[7:26] things
[7:27] uh and to know that
[7:29] but at the same time we don't want to
[7:32] become
[7:34] scientists that have arise on the stars
[7:37] and can't discern the grass at our feet
[7:40] amen
[7:41] because it makes no sense
[7:44] you heading to the moon and you haven't
[7:47] even unraveled the mystery
[7:49] right around
[7:51] and a really mysterious things are the
[7:54] simplest things amen right
[7:58] um you can buy almost anything and you
[8:01] want in this world but you can't buy a
[8:04] bottle of peace
[8:06] peace of mind
[8:07] you can't buy joy in the bottle
[8:10] but it's it's there but it's so simple
[8:13] that we pass right over the top of it
[8:16] yeah
[8:19] yeah in second Corinthians 8 and 9.
[8:24] we're looking at the subject of
[8:26] stewardship
[8:28] and like I said before I spoke on on
[8:31] Wednesday night on the topic of the
[8:34] stewardship of life and we stress the
[8:38] point that God is the owner of
[8:42] everything amen do you believe that God
[8:46] owns everything we love the little song
[8:49] He Got the Whole World in His Hand He's
[8:52] Got The Whole World the world is the
[8:54] Lord's and the Earth is the Lords and
[8:57] the fullness thereof everything is that
[9:00] the captain of thousand hills are mine
[9:02] everything is mine even we us we belong
[9:07] to him
[9:08] we belong to him and we are in his hands
[9:12] so today I want to talk about giving and
[9:15] I want to talk about Abundant Living and
[9:18] giving everybody last the other uh three
[9:21] weeks ago I believe I took twenty
[9:24] dollars out of my wallet and I held up
[9:27] and I said who wants this everybody I
[9:35] freshened it up with my feet to get him
[9:37] dirty I said who still wants this dirty
[9:39] Bill
[9:40] everybody's still one in there doesn't
[9:43] matter what I did for that 20 dollar
[9:44] bill everybody wanted it I went to South
[9:48] Carolina preaching there I did the same
[9:51] thing everybody wanted a matter of fact
[9:53] one man ran right up to the front and
[9:55] was right there and if I took my foot
[9:58] off that turned it up and it was going
[10:00] to be gone
[10:03] but the fact is everybody wants money
[10:06] amen is there anybody here that doesn't
[10:08] want everyone doesn't want money
[10:10] I see no hands raised so that everybody
[10:14] wants money and not because we wash up
[10:17] honey but because to live in the present
[10:19] World System you need money to live you
[10:25] need money in which to live because of
[10:28] the system in which we are living and to
[10:30] be honest well you know me I have been
[10:34] reluctant through the years to teach or
[10:38] preach about money
[10:40] and about giving
[10:41] and one of the reasons why is because I
[10:45] look up there and see on the television
[10:48] screens
[10:49] and I've been into Mass meetings and in
[10:53] various churches
[10:55] where all the all they've talked about
[10:57] most of the time
[10:59] and money
[11:01] and uh people are pressured to give
[11:06] money
[11:08] and a lot of people have been hurt
[11:12] in giving money
[11:14] I think I got the Raiders now because
[11:17] you're so quiet now these are really
[11:19] listening that's good
[11:23] burn
[11:25] burn the churches
[11:26] and ministers
[11:29] in the giving of money
[11:32] but I want to thank my God that I have
[11:34] an example of my own mother and father
[11:39] who uh preach the gospel without
[11:42] belonging to any specific denomination
[11:45] they were just Christians by reading the
[11:47] Bible they were they didn't belong to
[11:49] any church it's afterwards that the
[11:52] Assemblies of God heard me as a young
[11:56] boy in the street maybe 14 years old and
[11:58] gave me a scholarship but other than
[12:01] that they didn't know anything they just
[12:03] read their Bible priest
[12:05] um what God put in their hearts and as a
[12:08] result
[12:10] um people were saying born again and
[12:12] join the various churches matter of fact
[12:15] a few years ago I went back to South
[12:17] America into Diana where I'm from I'm
[12:20] walking through a hotel lobby I'm here
[12:21] in the oldest animals that I know you I
[12:23] said how could you love me you're not in
[12:25] the same generation I haven't been there
[12:26] for 22 years now he said oh I know
[12:29] you're you're I know your family I said
[12:31] no he says yes he says who's your father
[12:34] I told him he said oh he says I know him
[12:37] I know him and your grandfather I'm one
[12:40] of his Converse
[12:45] and here he was the minister in charge
[12:48] of the museum and all this kind of stuff
[12:50] so anyway the fact is that people get
[12:54] born again
[12:55] and they get old they get sick when
[12:58] everybody else and people would be
[12:59] giving them
[13:01] ready to give them their property let me
[13:03] say no we're not doing it for that we'd
[13:06] be here just to preach the gospel bring
[13:08] on their first get in
[13:11] um I see I see that over and over where
[13:14] they turned down for Jews and then even
[13:19] bother with it one man lying in the
[13:22] street that was sick covered with sores
[13:25] they call them Lazarus because it was so
[13:28] comfortable source they took him they
[13:31] paid them using words natural herbs
[13:34] because back to them you know there's a
[13:36] hospital that the people in the know of
[13:38] natural things never even bother the
[13:41] gospel matter of fact they used to call
[13:42] my aunt to the hospital to help them out
[13:45] because she knew so much but anyway
[13:48] it took them took him and the bathroom
[13:51] and give him herbs and stuff like that
[13:54] and help them the man recovered his
[13:57] health
[13:59] and went to school
[14:02] and it was brilliant and in the several
[14:07] years he became an encounter he became a
[14:09] chief of counter he became the head over
[14:11] the bauxite company and was a powerful
[14:13] person in the country and he wanted to
[14:17] somehow repay them in various ways and
[14:20] it absolutely refused he couldn't do
[14:23] anything that they would accept so when
[14:26] I
[14:28] um was expected to a high school college
[14:31] actually what he did he heard about it
[14:35] and he went ahead and just paid for
[14:37] everything so when they turned up to go
[14:39] paying the fees and paying for the books
[14:41] and paying it was already paid for so
[14:44] that's how he got back at them because
[14:47] for years he's trying to get to do
[14:49] something and one thing what I'm trying
[14:51] to tell you so that's the reason one of
[14:54] the reluctance I I've had through the
[14:57] years of actually teaching and preaching
[15:00] on giving a praise on you prospering and
[15:04] God bless in you but to actually preach
[15:07] on giving I kept away from it because
[15:09] I've seen too much out there in the
[15:12] so-called Church world
[15:13] amen where people have been deceived in
[15:17] every possible way and they taught every
[15:21] possible way but I want to teach them
[15:23] what the bible really says about giving
[15:27] not what I see or anybody else says but
[15:30] what the Bible actually says about
[15:33] giving and by doing that I want you to
[15:36] get rid of all your thoughts ideas
[15:39] you don't need miracle wallets
[15:43] from some preacher giving you a miracle
[15:45] wallet and telling you if you send for
[15:48] this wallet send twenty dollars you get
[15:50] the wallet and after you get this wallet
[15:52] you know the wallet will always be full
[15:55] of good money
[15:57] but the bad fact is way back then that
[15:59] had to be false
[16:01] because of my argument was to turn
[16:03] around and say well if you can have a
[16:06] miracle wallet that's always going to
[16:09] have money in it every time I spend and
[16:12] I go back to the wallet there's money in
[16:13] the wallet why have you giving me the
[16:16] wallet
[16:17] in the wallet for your money for your
[16:20] ministry so far so why give me the water
[16:22] keep your Miracle wallet keep your
[16:24] Miracle belt keep your Miracle Water
[16:28] right put your coffee from the Catholics
[16:30] anyway
[16:33] keep all of that and just give me Jesus
[16:37] amen praise the name of the Lord so I
[16:41] want you to get rid of all these false
[16:44] ideas
[16:45] false things that they're placed in your
[16:47] mind if they want to sell you something
[16:49] tell you plain I'm selling you this book
[16:52] or I'm doing that don't say send for my
[16:55] free book and when you were sending send
[16:58] twenty dollars
[17:00] as an offering it's a trick right so
[17:03] open your eyes don't don't be foolish
[17:07] um you know like to just be wise as a
[17:09] serpent but harmless like a dove right a
[17:13] lot of Christians believe that it's not
[17:15] good to uh you know be thoughtful and be
[17:19] quick but you know we need to be
[17:22] spiritual but we also need to be
[17:24] practical
[17:26] well if you're not in heaven you have to
[17:28] be right there on this Earth and you
[17:30] need to have to deal with practical
[17:32] situations and you need to deal with the
[17:35] devil and sheep's clothing and sometimes
[17:39] they come right in the church yes is
[17:41] that right I said sometimes they're in
[17:43] the church and sometimes the worst ones
[17:45] are religion amen because the fact is
[17:48] when they covered up with religion you
[17:50] tend to want to trust them and that's
[17:53] their when they want to take you for a
[17:55] ride
[17:56] when you wake up amen and the reason why
[18:00] I can talk like this because I'm not
[18:03] depending on you for my salary amen
[18:07] ities I am not dependent on you for my
[18:12] salary
[18:13] I'm not dependent on you to pay me
[18:16] anything
[18:18] God is the source of my Supply
[18:22] uh one time
[18:24] I was working that's when I was doing
[18:27] building houses
[18:30] and um
[18:32] you know while I was there you know it's
[18:34] thank goodness I I have the I'm a
[18:37] contractor subcontractor this contract
[18:40] above me and uh oh he was talking kind
[18:44] of rough you know we had a bad time
[18:46] until you stop okay and then I said oh
[18:49] my you know I don't know what I'm gonna
[18:52] do with this boss I had no no and uh I
[18:56] don't know what and then I heard the
[18:59] Lord speaking quietly you know I don't
[19:01] mean I hear the liberal voice but inside
[19:03] boy speaking and saying your boss who is
[19:06] your boss is he your boss
[19:09] if he is your boss then you took the
[19:12] dependent on him
[19:14] but I am the boss over all the bosses so
[19:17] who are you going to trust him or me
[19:19] right and get you right off the bus and
[19:22] get you right on with me and that's when
[19:24] I learned to look to God so him lift the
[19:26] God says okay I'll pull back the
[19:28] contracts you don't have none he says
[19:30] that but what does God say about it
[19:34] if God say about it he can see whatever
[19:36] he wants
[19:52] but it's not what he says or he says
[19:55] What God Says
[19:57] so we ought to put our faith in God and
[20:00] in God's word heaven on Earth will pass
[20:03] away but my word will never pass away
[20:06] praise the Lord hallelujah so when I'm
[20:09] finishing up you will not be able to
[20:11] reevaluate yourself with all the
[20:13] requests you get from off the TV
[20:16] in the mail
[20:18] on other lines you will be able to more
[20:21] evaluate and have some more spiritual
[20:24] strength Hallelujah and not that these
[20:27] people could fear on you that if you
[20:29] don't give to the ministry you're going
[20:31] to go bankrupt
[20:33] all these lines and all these things
[20:36] they try to put on you and I want to get
[20:39] them off for you cast them out of
[20:42] Spirits or Devils is really the casting
[20:45] out of unbelief
[20:48] beliefs you know cast of unbelief and
[20:50] you cast out the devil amen praise the
[20:54] Lord
[20:54] but the essence of the fact is that the
[20:57] centrality of Christianity is giving
[21:01] because the Bible itself as you know in
[21:04] John 3 16 God so loved the world that he
[21:07] gave
[21:09] God so loved the world
[21:12] that he gave
[21:14] and God wants us to give so that we be
[21:18] like him
[21:19] amen so he wants us to learn to be
[21:23] givers
[21:24] and I'm not talking about learning
[21:26] Justice Just a Little Bit sometimes give
[21:28] your offerings but to have a life of
[21:32] giving
[21:33] where outside you're giving you're
[21:36] helping the poor you're helping your
[21:37] neighbor you're you're good you're
[21:39] giving up your time you're always a
[21:41] giver because that is the nature of God
[21:45] Amen
[21:46] amen that is the nature of God the word
[21:49] give is used over 1500 times of the
[21:51] Bible
[21:52] and Christianity is based on God giving
[21:57] his life for us hallelujah amen and we
[22:01] know friends that when we look at the
[22:04] Bible I want you to see her even in the
[22:07] text we use that God Jesus looking at
[22:10] the woman at the treasury was more
[22:14] interested in the motive of the giver
[22:18] than the money of The Giver that's right
[22:21] let me repeat that the Lord was born and
[22:25] arrested in the motive of The Giver that
[22:29] in the body or the amount of money or
[22:32] The Giver
[22:33] because if the amount of money you give
[22:36] is in the wrong attitude that's
[22:37] worthless amen we're bless the God and
[22:42] somebody coming with the right walk is
[22:44] an attitude then literally give God is
[22:47] ever like the Franklin of bread to
[22:50] multiplying to feed multitudes
[22:53] amen so it's the right flow live on the
[22:56] right action in giving that is the
[22:59] blessing that we received amen so why do
[23:03] we give this important
[23:05] it's just not how much we give but why
[23:09] we give and the quality of the heart of
[23:14] The Giver is more than the quantity amen
[23:18] amen so don't give just forgiving
[23:23] but gift from the heart
[23:25] and give a revelation
[23:28] and God will bless you amen giving is a
[23:33] responsibility that's right it's a
[23:36] command in the Bible and also
[23:38] responsibility for us as Christians
[23:41] it is also an opportunity
[23:44] for you to be able to give to God's plan
[23:49] God's program in God's kingdom praise
[23:52] the Lord and that's the reason I want to
[23:55] share with you three reasons why we as
[23:59] Christians
[24:01] ought to give Hallelujah and friends
[24:03] this subject is stewardship is very
[24:07] important
[24:09] giving
[24:10] it's a response
[24:13] to God for
[24:15] eign
[24:15] fast
[24:17] we are grateful for past blessings all
[24:21] the blessings we have received secondly
[24:24] it's a response for what God is doing
[24:27] for us give us and through us at the
[24:30] present time and we give him thanks and
[24:33] praise for them and it's also a response
[24:36] into what God will do for us in the
[24:40] future
[24:42] hallelujah praise the Lord let me give
[24:45] you a little secret if you go I'm afraid
[24:47] of God for something
[24:48] and you ask him for it say Lord I ask
[24:52] you to heal my mother or heal my father
[24:55] or or God provide me with a new car
[24:59] you know what's the best thing you can
[25:01] do for sure not to believe it start
[25:03] thanking him in anticipation
[25:07] of the reception of that thing amen that
[25:11] is fake faith is praising God Amen
[25:16] before you actually have the stuff in
[25:18] your hand because you believe it you
[25:20] start thanking him before your body
[25:22] amen you see it's not simple brothers
[25:25] and sisters thank God
[25:29] praise the Lord hallelujah if you heard
[25:32] that you
[25:34] um had a what the lottery and the money
[25:38] was going to be delivered to your house
[25:41] in the British truck you don't have
[25:43] nobody else yet but it's on the way yes
[25:46] so you're not going to wait for it to
[25:49] get to your house and then you will
[25:50] start rejoicing you have already started
[25:53] to Rejoice before and even arise
[25:56] as surely as your faith pulls down the
[26:00] blessing of God said God's Prophet your
[26:03] unbelief sends it back where it comes
[26:05] from yeah but if you love texting
[26:08] translation if you can keep believing
[26:12] you can have whatever you say yeah it'll
[26:15] appear it will manifest it will become
[26:17] visible for the things that are seen are
[26:20] made from the things that are not seen
[26:23] everything that is created here is by
[26:26] God's spoken word amen the invisible
[26:29] became visible by the spoken word of God
[26:33] hallelujah now so you say friend
[26:36] assignment why do we give second
[26:37] Corinthians 8 9 of course are classic
[26:41] passengers praise the Lord every man
[26:44] according to his purpose in his life so
[26:46] let him give not the presently our
[26:49] necessity for God
[26:51] love it a cheerful Giver hallelujah amen
[26:57] praise God so one the first thing it
[27:00] does the first reason it allows us to
[27:03] express our appreciation for past
[27:05] blessing yes hallelujah praise God that
[27:09] is why sometimes people wanted to know
[27:12] why I'm happy to pay my bills
[27:15] some people are not happy to pay bills
[27:17] when they see they're built they get
[27:20] done
[27:21] what I expect I have to explain I said
[27:24] look I'm paying my bills because I'm
[27:27] happy for the past blessings
[27:29] that I received I receive services and
[27:33] I'm thankful for those Services I know
[27:35] I'm paying for the services praise God
[27:38] so I'm happy to receive that because I
[27:41] already been blessed by them
[27:43] company blessed me oh you don't think so
[27:47] but yeah but yes that's why I have
[27:50] lights in my home they bless me praise
[27:53] God the Walker
[28:07] so I turn it around the opposite way so
[28:10] that when it comes I don't feel bad I
[28:12] feel wonderful that God is able to
[28:15] provide for me in such a way that I'm
[28:16] able to pay my bills okay
[28:19] amen so I rejoice when they come here
[28:22] praise the Lord hallelujah so you are
[28:25] not together or in that way the blood of
[28:29] course in his word tells us her second
[28:32] Corinthians 9 7 that we ought to give
[28:35] not reluctantly or under any convention
[28:40] right don't give father con function or
[28:44] grudgingly because if you give that way
[28:46] you're giving is worthless you see God
[28:49] is trying to get us in the right moment
[28:52] forgiveness
[28:53] Hallelujah
[28:55] matter of fact that is the reason why
[28:58] it's at first brother Branham never
[29:02] would receive an offering throughout his
[29:04] entire Ministry he will not take up an
[29:07] offering
[29:08] and refuse to do it but then one night
[29:12] when the Lord appeared to him and said
[29:15] no
[29:16] it's my command in the word that the
[29:19] people give
[29:20] your tithes and get their offerings
[29:23] and you true Sympathy for the people or
[29:27] you uh thinking that you're doing good
[29:30] telling them not to give but that is
[29:34] contrary to my word they ought to give
[29:37] so the life of his lesson they open the
[29:39] door to Blessing by their giving and
[29:42] taught them otherwise and from then on
[29:45] he um he started to take up an offering
[29:49] so our greatest reason for giving to God
[29:52] is out of gratitude amen
[29:55] I know I'm grateful to God for what he's
[29:58] done through my life the blessings are
[30:00] complex I can't wake up them all what
[30:03] he's done for gun free and the things
[30:06] is different
[30:07] broadly true situations that we brought
[30:10] me out of that nobody could explain and
[30:13] tell me that this human uh wisdom
[30:16] brought me out I know he brought me out
[30:19] of my request my God he brought me out
[30:22] of the sickness the pain the trouble I
[30:25] know he brought me out of the tracks
[30:27] that never set for me everything that
[30:29] surrounded me God knocked me out amen
[30:32] hallelujah and I know that I can say
[30:36] just like that friends that in according
[30:39] to God's word that God Supply the needs
[30:42] of God's people is also overflowing in
[30:45] many expressions of thanks to God
[30:47] hallelujah gratitude for past blessings
[30:51] say together with me the words that you
[30:53] want to see up here on the screen listen
[31:09] not your boss
[31:24] that your job your business is only a
[31:29] pipeline
[31:31] that God uses to bring his blessings to
[31:34] you let me let me just make it very
[31:37] simple it's like you can have a whole
[31:39] ocean of fresh water here in front of
[31:43] you and you need fresh water right
[31:46] but the fact is if you don't have a
[31:49] pipeline to it the water will be right
[31:51] there and you won't be able to get it is
[31:53] that right so God's what is the natural
[31:57] economy a business gives you a quick
[31:59] Lane to that economy a job gives you a
[32:02] pipeline to that economy and so on and
[32:04] so on you follow what I'm trying but if
[32:07] you have no connection to it how are you
[32:09] going to draw from it well that's when
[32:11] the same thing God is telling you here
[32:13] in his work by giving you awkward up the
[32:17] way for him to now be able to send down
[32:20] His blessings to you and then he uses a
[32:23] pipeline of a business a job something
[32:26] that you're doing he opens up the way
[32:28] and brings the blessings into your lives
[32:31] somebody say amen amen praise the Lord
[32:34] is that the truth praise God nothing
[32:37] from nothing
[32:40] some open up the way and let God have
[32:43] his way in your life this is not
[32:45] something that glorious thing when you
[32:48] go into the church world and see the way
[32:50] they treat the people giving me thumbs
[32:52] up uh our laborious thing yes it becomes
[32:56] a thing where oh not again oh here they
[32:59] go again and that's how a wife will
[33:01] begin to understand brother sister
[33:14] but for the water to come
[33:17] do you know what the first thing they
[33:19] have to do they have to use the section
[33:21] A Hole where they poured a little water
[33:24] in first
[33:25] and then there we got the pump and that
[33:27] is called priming the pop is that right
[33:31] yes sir well that's actually what God is
[33:33] telling you by giving it's not that he
[33:35] needs your family but he needs you to
[33:37] prime your tongue he wants you to see
[33:39] your heart amen if you're attached to
[33:42] things or you are really sick first the
[33:45] kingdom of heaven and his righteousness
[33:46] and all other things will be asked on to
[33:48] you he's constantly testing us to see if
[33:51] we're attached to things or we are
[33:54] actually not our eyes on him
[33:56] and that is the reason why every week
[34:00] every day he's testing Us in that
[34:04] particular area but never got your eyes
[34:07] off of this God no matter what goes on
[34:09] around you it's not this boss is not
[34:13] this High Corporation it's not that one
[34:16] they came and did that because God
[34:49] thank you
[34:51] hallelujah praise the Lord
[34:54] Oh Glory to God let's see the next uh
[34:57] scripture there praise God hallelujah
[35:00] amen
[35:03] and God is able to make all grace of God
[35:07] covered you that you always having all
[35:11] sufficiency in all things
[35:14] they are bound to every good work praise
[35:20] God hallelujah
[35:25] wants to bless you so that you have
[35:27] enough to to do all the good works
[35:30] in the heart to do listen you can't do
[35:34] it on good intention
[35:36] hallelujah oh if I have this money I
[35:39] will be able to write Bibles for the
[35:41] mission field it's a good intention but
[35:43] it doesn't help the church it doesn't
[35:45] have God or his kingdom so if I had it I
[35:48] would help that sick person across the
[35:50] street or that many mother or widow or
[35:55] grandmother that's left alone in our
[35:57] house I would help her if I had some
[35:59] extra well God is saying you give to me
[36:03] how much like give me that little loaf
[36:05] of bread give me that stick give me
[36:07] whatever you are I almost implied and in
[36:10] the words of David my comfort is full
[36:13] and rub it off of you are an excess that
[36:16] I can freely get what I'm feeling it
[36:19] abundance
[36:24] giving brings up God of living
[36:27] Hallelujah so that's the way it works
[36:30] according to God
[36:32] praise God hallelujah amen the Bible
[36:35] tells us that the Lord himself came down
[36:39] and he who was in the heavens that falls
[36:42] heavily he for our sex be careful
[36:48] it's in your Bible
[36:54] your pronouncing the word So Soft like
[36:56] you're scared to pronounce it is that
[36:59] right
[37:00] now
[37:01] he became for that we may become rich it
[37:07] is your right to be rich because that's
[37:10] the word he became poor the Bible says
[37:13] the fox says
[37:16] and the birds have a mess but the son of
[37:20] man he had nowhere to lay his sweet hand
[37:25] Hallelujah
[37:27] the Lord will provide
[37:31] Jehovah Hallelujah the Lord will provide
[37:37] he had nowhere no nowhere to lay his and
[37:42] he became poor that you may become rich
[37:46] in your hand that scripture alone you
[37:48] can keep that in your head all week he
[37:50] became quarter that might become rich
[37:52] rich
[37:54] praise God Rich Lord of God hallelujah
[37:58] wonderful it's not where you are now you
[38:01] might not be able to imagine it but God
[38:03] said yes
[38:07] which doesn't mean that you got just
[38:10] doesn't have to do with only money but
[38:13] you can be rich in hell
[38:15] is that right yes sir you can be rich
[38:17] with wealth you can be rich in joy you
[38:20] could be rich with peace beloved I wish
[38:22] above all things that you prosper in
[38:25] every aspect of your life prosper and be
[38:29] in hell even as your soul brother
[38:33] mental health physical health spiritual
[38:36] health so that you have in every way God
[38:39] wants you to prosper everywhere
[38:48] thank you
[38:50] we give because God gave the Lord Jesus
[38:54] Christ
[38:55] amen hallelujah
[38:58] my wife's birthday is in September it's
[39:00] coming up and I can guarantee you that I
[39:04] will go out and will buy her a gift
[39:08] why am I going to buy her this gift
[39:10] uh people say something I love her
[39:13] there's millions of women in the world
[39:15] Amen
[39:17] praise the Lord
[39:18] and because I'm thankful that God gave
[39:21] her to me it's no matter what you think
[39:24] about here is what I think about her and
[39:27] now you know I am the beholder praise
[39:31] the Lord praise the Lord and in my eyes
[39:34] is beautiful I said in my eyes she's
[39:37] beautiful
[39:38] and I cannot do you because I love her
[39:41] in September I'm wonderful and I'm going
[39:44] to give her sometimes the gift and I'm
[39:46] going to feel very happy in Daredevil to
[39:49] give it to her because giving is a
[39:53] practical way in expressing your love
[39:57] and your appreciation
[40:27] oh my God
[40:32] Lord I love you amen Hallelujah heavenly
[40:36] father I appreciate you shall you sing
[40:41] it heavenly father I am appreciated you
[40:47] I love you I love you I'm your food I
[40:53] bow down before you
[40:56] Heavenly Father
[40:58] I am Christian
[41:02] Corinthians 8 8 Paul says I'm not
[41:05] commanding you
[41:07] but I want to test the sincerity of Your
[41:12] Love
[41:13] hallelujah praise the Lord since he
[41:16] giving to God throughs our love for God
[41:20] no matter what we say
[41:23] it doesn't matter is what we do
[41:26] amen
[41:27] with their lips but many their hearts
[41:30] are far from God
[41:32] and then God can't bless them
[41:35] now the second reason why we're giving
[41:38] to God is because giving allows us to
[41:41] examine our present motives
[41:45] amen that's second reason we're given to
[41:48] God it allows us to examine our present
[41:52] motives for really giving so we examine
[41:55] ourselves why we are actually giving
[41:58] praise God hallelujah because you see
[42:01] many Christians have the attitude of
[42:04] because human race not just Christians
[42:07] have this not into the selfishness
[42:11] as I usually say it uh it's like the the
[42:16] people of God my trouble everybody got
[42:18] eye trouble I I I'm this
[42:24] is everything to do with life
[42:26] see me and mine and everything else you
[42:31] know and and the moment you off you you
[42:34] try to say something that they talk even
[42:37] if they don't say who their mouth is
[42:38] watching it for me
[42:39] right it's all about me it's all about
[42:42] me and I'm trying to get you if your
[42:45] name is to be me but uh
[42:47] um
[42:48] it's all about me and that's what the
[42:51] people are thinking all the time you
[42:53] remember the man in the Bible that Jesus
[42:55] spoke to and he says my Barns and my
[42:58] farm and and my cattle and this
[43:01] everything is mine mine mine not
[43:04] realizing that God give you all of it
[43:06] what are you talking about just buying
[43:08] this and mind that praise the Lord so
[43:10] from time to time we need
[43:16] in other words checking of our emotions
[43:18] all right the Bible says that the man or
[43:21] a woman examine yourself
[43:23] to see whether you are in the Revelation
[43:26] in other words you're living under the
[43:29] inspiration of Revelation rather than by
[43:33] reason under your own emotion amen we've
[43:37] got to live by the word praise God
[43:39] hallelujah amen we've got to get to the
[43:43] point
[43:51] are we considering it brother sister
[43:54] that we must remember that God is the
[43:58] source of the supply yes and that we are
[44:02] only managers of what yes it's in our
[44:05] eyes but it's time when his talent
[44:07] whether it's our family whether it's our
[44:09] Fortune what every blessings in your
[44:11] hand we are only managers that is why we
[44:14] use the word sure because the steward
[44:16] manages a house or manages a property
[44:18] something that doesn't belong to him and
[44:21] we are given a 99 and he says give me
[44:25] back ten right a group of man is the 99
[44:28] and then I will bless you praise the
[44:31] Lord amen so the second reason why God
[44:35] wants us to give is that we avoid the
[44:38] virus the same or the curse of
[44:41] selfishness because it runs robots
[44:45] right now even in the political Realm
[44:50] it helps us to keep that way our
[44:52] priorities and balance
[44:55] we have enough keep our lives in other
[44:57] words in balance
[44:59] uh look at Deuteronomy 14 22 to 23.
[45:05] Deuteronomy
[45:07] Hallelujah
[45:09] thou shall truly tie all of the increase
[45:13] of thy sin
[45:15] amen let the feet that the field amen
[45:23] shall bring forth year by year
[45:26] and those shall eat before the Lord thy
[45:29] God
[45:30] in the place which he shall choose the
[45:34] bless his name
[45:35] place the tide of the Corn and of the
[45:38] wine
[45:39] amen I wrote the first things out of the
[45:43] hearts of the thought that though must
[45:47] learn to fear the lord always
[45:50] Hallelujah in other words a simple comes
[45:53] what he's saying
[45:54] in a lot of words that when you pay your
[45:57] tithes it makes you always conscious
[46:00] that all I have come from him
[46:03] and as much as it comes from him the
[46:06] Lord gives
[46:07] and that simple the Lord can think of me
[46:09] amen
[46:11] therefore I have to live with spiritual
[46:13] fear or respect
[46:16] before God with what I do with my living
[46:20] and with my hearing amen because I'm
[46:24] always conscious that he's watching and
[46:27] he knows every path that I take praise
[46:31] the Lord you got to seek first the
[46:34] kingdom of heaven and it's righteousness
[46:37] and all other things
[46:39] will be given unto you now I got to
[46:44] refer back to myself my dear precious
[46:46] wife there when Desiree and I got
[46:50] married
[46:51] no matter what happened and I will tell
[46:54] you what happened because we we went
[46:57] through all kinds of
[46:59] experiences uh like that but people say
[47:04] no matter what happened we are going to
[47:07] bring all these types first they don't
[47:10] make any difference
[47:12] because you know some people got it
[47:14] backwards they think um but I don't have
[47:19] any money why should I type to God
[47:22] but that's the reason why you should
[47:25] because you're the one that needs even
[47:27] the blessing even more
