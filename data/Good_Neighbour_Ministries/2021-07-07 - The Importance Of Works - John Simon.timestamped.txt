[4:22] of jesus christ our lord
[4:26] amen and amen
[4:30] as we have just read
[4:33] in the scriptures
[4:36] of revelation 2 9 to 19
[4:40] god saying i know
[4:43] thy works remember
[4:46] now jesus is speaking
[4:50] standing there before john
[4:53] and he is saying to john i
[4:57] know thy works
[5:00] now just think of it the god of heaven
[5:04] who knows everything who is aware
[5:07] of every sparrow he said there's not a
[5:11] spiral that will fall i don't know about
[5:14] it
[5:14] the the hairs upon your head i know
[5:18] every one of them because they are
[5:19] numbered
[5:21] oh my a god who
[5:24] knows all things
[5:28] omniscient omnipotent
[5:31] a god that is all seeing
[5:35] that knows all things and he
[5:38] is saying none of your works are hidden
[5:42] none of your works are forgotten none of
[5:45] your works are
[5:46] overlooked or brushed aside but
[5:49] i know thy works whether they're good
[5:53] whether they're bad
[5:54] but i know thy works
[5:57] not what you say they are
[6:00] but god is saying i
[6:03] know thy works
[6:08] amen hallelujah
[6:11] i prince this is a marvelous statement
[6:16] because you're saying uh children i know
[6:20] all your actions
[6:24] you're seen and you're unseen
[6:27] known and unknown i know all of your
[6:30] actions
[6:32] in front of people behind people in
[6:34] front of the pastor behind the pastor
[6:37] in front of the saints and away from the
[6:40] saints
[6:40] i know thy works
[6:43] i know your activities
[6:46] i know every one of your actions
[6:50] remember the all-seeing
[6:54] eye of god is always
[6:58] upon us and that should teach us
[7:04] as believers that we
[7:07] should always live lives
[7:10] being conscious of
[7:13] god knowing that he is seeing
[7:18] everything we say and do
[7:22] amen hallelujah and by this
[7:27] god he is implying also i am
[7:30] interested in you
[7:34] and i'm interested in your works
[7:37] i'm interested in whatever you do and
[7:40] i'm so glad
[7:42] that god is interested
[7:45] in what we do and he knows
[7:49] our works praise god
[7:53] hallelujah amen now it is important
[7:59] that we clearly understand
[8:03] that works do not save us
[8:08] let me repeat good works
[8:13] being a good man a good woman
[8:16] a good church member a good person
[8:19] good citizen good works
[8:23] do not save us paying indulgences
[8:27] do not save us paying for masses
[8:31] do not save us paying for any religious
[8:36] uh item does not save us
[8:40] no good works from the human
[8:44] being saves them salvation
[8:48] is of the lord salvation
[8:51] is without money in the book of idea
[8:55] and without the price no price
[8:59] no money he gave himself freely
[9:03] for all and died already for your sins
[9:08] and we do not have to pay
[9:11] anyone for any such things
[9:15] whatsoever for salvation
[9:18] is not of works salvation
[9:21] is not of man salvation
[9:25] is of the lord
[9:28] now we must clearly see
[9:33] that even though it doesn't save
[9:36] us salvation is
[9:39] important to us as christians
[9:44] for it's an important element
[9:47] that comes forth from a saved life
[9:52] a one who knows that their lives have
[9:56] been
[9:56] changed and transformed by the
[10:00] spirit of almighty god
[10:03] matter of fact james chapter 2
[10:07] verse 17 he says
[10:10] faith without works
[10:14] is dead amen
[10:19] revelation without action
[10:23] is dead salvation
[10:27] not followed up by good works and with
[10:31] good
[10:32] works is dead it's not real
[10:35] salvation if works
[10:39] do not follow a save life
[10:42] or works is very important
[10:47] be expressed to god our gratitude
[10:52] for what he has done bringing us from
[10:56] the
[10:57] my reclaim placing our
[11:01] feet on the rock to stay
[11:04] how marvelous is our god
[11:08] now how important are works
[11:14] it's important because works
[11:18] reveals or manifests
[11:21] the faith that you claim you have
[11:25] you can sing you have faith
[11:28] but your actions speak louder
[11:31] than your voice than your words
[11:35] and therefore your works
[11:39] your actions activities
[11:43] my friends reveals
[11:46] to the entire world
[11:49] amen of the faith that you hold within
[11:54] so it is important that our works
[11:58] follow our faith oh hallelujah
[12:03] works are also important
[12:07] because they are a fruit
[12:11] of the of a saved life
[12:14] a life of one who has been
[12:17] truly born again
[12:20] will bear that marvelous
[12:24] fruit of good works
[12:27] it will naturally flow from them
[12:31] to be kind to be courteous
[12:34] amen to be righteous to be faithful
[12:39] these things will flow
[12:42] from the life of a true
[12:46] believer that has been saved
[12:49] elected changed by the grace of
[12:53] almighty god hallelujah
[12:57] all prince grant your works
[13:01] on the outside of you
[13:04] justifies and tells of the
[13:07] new spirit that you have
[13:10] within you for as the prophet said
[13:14] and your heart will i give them
[13:18] i'll take out the stony heart
[13:21] and i'll give them a heart a new heart
[13:24] amen i'll put in your spirit
[13:27] if it's in them and so your
[13:31] works expresses
[13:34] that new heart this new spirit
[13:37] that lives within you and
[13:41] lets the world know that your
[13:44] your old man or the old way
[13:48] you used to live has passed away
[13:52] and all things have become
[13:55] new you have now become a
[13:59] new creation you have been born
[14:02] again in christ through the divine
[14:05] election you've come to the realization
[14:10] amen of who you really are
[14:14] and you are born again by that
[14:17] revelation
[14:19] that the word of god opens up
[14:22] and reveals to you
[14:26] amen good works
[14:30] important but it does not save you
[14:34] you can pile them up as high as a
[14:36] mountain
[14:38] you can pay millions of dollars
[14:42] you can uh all my friends build all
[14:45] manner of charitable institutions
[14:48] you can place widows and orphans homes
[14:52] old parked homes you can feed the poor
[14:56] the hungry wonderful
[14:59] but good works will not save you
[15:03] good works amen i know
[15:07] your faith and i know your good works
[15:11] because faith is separate from works
[15:15] and revelation comes to you
[15:18] and that produces the life the fruit
[15:22] of the works that now flows out of you
[15:26] naturally the holy spirit begins to work
[15:30] in and through your life amen
[15:34] good works are
[15:38] also important because
[15:41] it inspires faith
[15:44] in him amen when
[15:48] they see your good works
[15:52] our good works the life we live
[15:56] the stances and positions we take
[16:01] the way we conduct ourselves
[16:04] in this world full of filth
[16:08] perversion darkness on every hand
[16:11] and yet we hold our heads high
[16:16] we hold ourselves pure and we
[16:19] walk through this world in in
[16:23] white the righteousness of christ
[16:27] the robe of the bride
[16:30] is the word of god the
[16:33] righteousness of christ no wonder paul
[16:36] said
[16:37] put you on the lord jesus hallelujah
[16:41] amen so we have put on christ
[16:44] and out of him blows
[16:47] all of these wonderful works
[16:50] unto the children of men
[16:54] matter if the bible tells us
[16:57] when you do good works they will see
[17:01] your good works
[17:02] and glorify your father
[17:06] which is in heaven o praise god
[17:10] don't you want your father in heaven to
[17:13] be glorified don't you want him to be
[17:16] praised
[17:17] and magnified oh praise god forevermore
[17:21] hallelujah
[17:22] amen good works they're wonderful
[17:26] but they must arise from the correct
[17:30] motive
[17:33] some can do good works to be admired
[17:37] others do good works to be seen
[17:40] my friends others do good works
[17:44] because they think it will save them it
[17:46] will
[17:47] not all my friends
[17:50] good works an expression of the
[17:53] heart of the believer
[17:57] gratitude to god love for him
[18:02] and for what he has done for us
[18:05] when we think about his love when we
[18:08] think about his grace
[18:10] his substitutionary sacrifice
[18:14] when we think that he took our place
[18:17] on calvary oh what else can we
[18:21] do but our time on earth that we
[18:24] spend here we want to spend it
[18:28] working for the lord we want to work
[18:31] till jesus comes
[18:33] we'll want to work until he calls us
[18:37] come up hither and we're called into the
[18:40] presence of god while we are here let's
[18:43] work amen jesus said work while in this
[18:47] day
[18:48] where you don't know when night time
[18:51] it's come in and when night time comes
[18:54] it goes all
[18:55] dark and you cannot work in the night
[18:59] so let's work till jesus comes
[19:02] and let our the holy spirit work the
[19:05] works of god
[19:07] through us that he might bring glory
[19:10] to his marvelous and wonderful
[19:13] name real true works
[19:18] must flow from the correct motives
[19:22] and the correct motive for love for
[19:26] for for good works is the love of god
[19:30] when the love of god so saturates
[19:35] envelops and takes preeminence
[19:40] over your heart you can't help
[19:44] but be one who prays for others
[19:48] who gives who goes
[19:52] you become a helper most of all
[19:56] overall you take on the spirit
[20:00] of servanthood for you have become a
[20:04] prisoner to the word a prisoner of the
[20:07] jesus
[20:08] christ who becomes your lord of
[20:11] all and the word now takes preeminence
[20:15] over your walking you're talking you're
[20:18] living
[20:19] you're acting what you see what you hear
[20:22] the word of god becomes
[20:25] your control center the holy spirit
[20:29] works in your life and he proves through
[20:32] your works
[20:33] that you have crowned him lord of all
[20:37] lord of your life lord jesus
[20:41] i created thee now lord take my
[20:44] life and let it be comfy created
[20:48] lord to thee take my moments and my days
[20:52] let them flow in ceaseless praise
[20:56] oh mare lions be a sweet smelling savor
[21:00] unto god may our lives be the perfume
[21:04] from these flowers of human life
[21:08] which are here today and gone tomorrow
[21:12] as the prophet said you are like the
[21:14] flowers
[21:15] like the grass of the field you're here
[21:18] today
[21:19] and you're gone tomorrow you are like
[21:22] the smoke
[21:23] that can be blown away with the evening
[21:26] breeze
[21:27] so my friends while we are yet alive
[21:31] while we are yet healthy while we still
[21:34] have time
[21:36] let's work till jesus comes again
[21:39] and the bridegroom calls us home let's
[21:42] do what he tells us to do
[21:45] and fulfill the law of christ the word
[21:48] of god
[21:49] hallelujah with the great motive
[21:53] of love hallelujah
[21:56] and to be a servant of the living god
[22:01] prisoner of jesus christ
[22:05] now some years ago
[22:09] i was uh
[22:12] i was just dealing with a situation
[22:17] in which a foreign person
[22:23] had to be picked up dropped off
[22:27] to the hotel had to be
[22:31] taken for meals and such like
[22:36] and in doing so i of course
[22:41] i opened the car door i let them be
[22:44] seated close the car door
[22:46] i gathered their luggage took it place
[22:49] in the back of the vehicle
[22:51] and so on when they're about to
[22:55] have their meal i would move over
[22:59] pull uh have the chair drawn out let
[23:02] them be seated
[23:03] place it back like that and
[23:06] at the end of let's say
[23:10] about a week that person said
[23:16] you're not a real
[23:19] bishop you are not a real
[23:23] you can't be a bishop
[23:26] and i said well no
[23:30] if you see it that way i'm not a bishop
[23:33] and i knew what i was saying because
[23:36] the bible tells us answer a fool
[23:38] according to their folly and then the
[23:40] next time it says answer not
[23:42] a fool according to their paulie so i
[23:45] said
[23:45] well no i'm i'm not a bishop
[23:49] in that way and i let it go at that but
[23:52] i'm telling you this
[23:53] to say that like the pharisees and
[23:57] sadducees in the bible
[24:01] many have created
[24:04] a a visual of what people should expect
[24:08] a bishop a pastor a minister
[24:12] should be and their picture is
[24:16] one that is high and mighty
[24:19] one that is robbed in scarlet
[24:23] purple or uh black and white or
[24:27] whatever colors white green many colors
[24:32] resplendent as a prince
[24:35] of the church all my friends
[24:41] on the contrary
[24:44] jesus said he who would be the greatest
[24:48] let him be servant of all
[24:52] so he's calling his children
[24:55] to a life of service
[24:58] a life of surrender a life of
[25:02] obedience to walk in the light of the
[25:05] world
[25:07] amen my friends
[25:10] to be a real trustworthy
[25:15] servant one first of all
[25:19] have to have the qualities of obedience
[25:24] they must also have the qualities
[25:28] of loyalty
[25:32] they must also have
[25:36] an attitude of faithfulness
[25:41] and they must also
[25:45] have patience of course these are
[25:48] mentioned
[25:48] in the scripture which we read jesus
[25:52] saying i
[25:53] know your faith i know your works
[25:56] i know your patience i know about it
[26:00] so a real servant
[26:03] needs to have this attitude of
[26:06] servanthood
[26:08] oh not the pomposity
[26:11] uh that goes along
[26:15] with quantification my friends
[26:20] but one that would live in humility and
[26:22] then
[26:23] surrender real true humility
[26:27] oh my friends god is calling his
[26:31] children
[26:32] back to the word amen
[26:35] or praise his marvelous name
[26:38] amen oh a servant of god must have
[26:42] patience and we know
[26:45] friends face must be tried
[26:50] to produce patience and that is why
[26:54] these saints of tired torah
[26:58] were being tried by the age in which
[27:01] they
[27:01] lived in by all the persecutions
[27:06] that they had and the trials that came
[27:09] their way and outwardly they appear
[27:13] poor but god is saying
[27:17] you're trying of your faith has made you
[27:20] rich in pensions in faith
[27:24] in works your walk with god has been
[27:27] enriched
[27:29] hallelujah don't you despair
[27:32] don't cry don't be discouraged
[27:35] but hold fast let no man take your crown
[27:41] because i know thy words
[27:45] i know what you are going through and i
[27:48] know your works hallelujah
[27:51] faith mighty
[27:55] faith must be tried
[27:58] to produce patience
[28:02] when faith is tried in the refining
[28:06] fires of god
[28:09] it begins to produce patience and
[28:11] godliness
[28:12] and other virtues within the heart and
[28:16] lives
[28:17] of the believer i'm not saying
[28:21] you must understand me these things are
[28:24] in you by the holy spirit but they have
[28:26] to come out
[28:27] and it takes these trials fiery trials
[28:32] for you to be able to express them
[28:35] and work them on the outside hallelujah
[28:39] because of course patience is
[28:42] one of the virtues and that
[28:46] these virtues are in us
[28:50] my friends unexpressed
[28:53] until the holy spirit through
[28:56] death trails through his own way
[29:01] is able to manifest to us
[29:04] how much patience we have
[29:08] oh praise god the growth
[29:12] the development and maturity of patients
[29:16] within our lives is the
[29:19] character development process
[29:23] that the holy spirit uses
[29:27] to bring about the changes
[29:31] within the hearts and lives
[29:34] of his saints yes
[29:38] all the trials all the mockings you have
[29:42] been going through
[29:44] all the persecutions amen
[29:48] my friends as they increase i want you
[29:51] to know
[29:53] that your character is being further
[29:57] developed and strengthened by the
[30:00] grace of almighty god hallelujah
[30:04] amen to a christian with character
[30:09] trials are not the source
[30:12] of discouragement or of despair
[30:17] but they are real elected
[30:21] believing saint of god sees
[30:25] trials as a great marvelous
[30:29] opportunity for another victory
[30:33] glory to god my friends
[30:37] if there is no trouble
[30:41] how will you wear win a crown
[30:44] if you are not in a contest how can you
[30:48] win a prize
[30:50] no ticket no chance no

[30:57] trail how are you going to develop
[31:00] oh praise god how the cat of christ
[31:04] going to flow through you fear
[31:08] not when you go through the fiery trials
[31:11] for the triumph of your face work at
[31:14] patience
[31:16] that is the work of god working patience
[31:19] in you
[31:20] so the true believer sees
[31:24] triangles as an opportunity
[31:27] for another resounding victory
[31:31] against the world the flesh and the
[31:34] devil
[31:35] so that god may be glorified
[31:38] hallelujah amen also
[31:42] the true believer the overcomer

[34:01] bend they would not change their
[34:03] doctrine from one god to tree
[34:06] they would not burn even though
[34:09] they were persecuted they were given the
[34:12] inquisition they were tortured
[34:14] burnt at the stake for the sunnah
[34:18] oh my friends what did that do
[34:21] it all friends it rebounded on satan

[35:12] remember friends what i'm saying here
[35:17] these saints of thyatira
[35:21] did not just develop good character
[35:26] during good times but
[35:29] they develop their character
[35:33] or they expressed the death of christ
[35:37] or their work out their salvation
[35:41] by the words of god in them
[35:44] they were able to do it more
[35:48] during the hard times you can do it some
[35:51] of it during the good
[35:52] times but hard times tests trials
[35:55] persecutions

[36:01] amen and refines the very
[36:04] cut of christ which is already
[36:07] in you amen hallelujah
[36:11] so it was during the dark ages
[36:17] that the tank of these saints was
[36:20] expressing
[36:21] and it was so outstanding that
[36:24] god had to refer to it said i
[36:28] know your works i know your pensions
[36:31] your
[36:31] faith your loyalty i know what you
[36:35] how you are and what you're doing praise
[36:38] god
[36:38] hallelujah he could see himself
[36:41] being manifest and expressed within
[36:45] the hearts of these believers
[36:49] during this these dark ages
[36:53] the dark ages were edges of
[36:56] potpourri
[36:59] my friends where
[37:03] the pop strength and power of the popes
[37:07] arose the mixture of church and state
[37:12] mixed together oh an earthly
[37:16] combination for earthly victory
[37:21] and they have conquered and they are
[37:24] conquering and they will continue to
[37:27] conquer
[37:29] and create mayhem
[37:33] but that will only go on
[37:36] until the prince of peace comes again
[37:40] oh praise his name and he has promised
[37:44] that he will come again oh blessed be
[37:48] the name of the lord
[37:49] then we shall be able to say peace on
[37:52] earth
[37:53] and good will towards men
[37:57] here we find the developed character
[38:00] during the towns of the popes
[38:05] that developed character during this
[38:08] time
[38:08] of inquisition and persecution

[38:27] are you walking uh the line
[38:30] of compromise where you can tomorrow
[38:34] you're back in the world
[38:36] the next day you're back in the church
[38:38] you're doing the same things like the
[38:40] people in the world
[38:41] but you want to claim to be a christian
[38:44] just because
[38:45] you maybe have some good uh offerings
[38:48] times indulgences and so on
[38:52] in the church you think that will save
[38:55] you no
[38:56] that will not send you salvation is of
[38:59] the lord
[39:01] election is of the lord

[39:09] age of potpourri age
[39:12] of branches of persecution
[39:15] and ages of pornography
[39:19] pornography which is to say the
[39:22] rule of hard luts
[39:25] to be ruled by the spirit
[39:29] of the harlot church amen
[39:33] and this is the time where god
[39:37] speaks cleanly in his word that he
[39:42] i know your works but there's one thing
[39:45] amongst you
[39:46] which i hate that woman jezebel
[39:51] oh he's not talking of just one woman
[39:54] but the spirit of jezebel
[39:58] was operating through the church
[40:02] and that church was sending out
[40:05] by uh by the power
[40:09] of uh what should i say
[40:12] transferring transference of that same
[40:16] attitude and spirit that was upon
[40:20] her as a godless
[40:23] false church false to the word
[40:27] she was giving off that spirit on her
[40:30] daughters
[40:31] who picked up the same attitude live
[40:34] like jezebel act like jezebel's draft
[40:36] like jezebels
[40:37] lie cheat steal and behave like jezebel
[40:41] uncover themselves like jezebel oh my
[40:44] friends
[40:45] that same spirit is still in the world
[40:49] today
[40:50] in the form of a church spirit
[40:53] and at the same time in the church
[40:57] in the form of a spirit of lust
[41:01] in the world and perversion
[41:05] in every possible way
[41:08] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[41:11] amen everyone that loves
[41:15] is born of god worth john

[41:27] age of of all of this type of thing

[42:02] that you already place your face
[42:06] in him because good works
[42:10] i repeat over and over
[42:13] good works do not serve you
[42:17] but they will come forth from a
[42:20] saved life as a fruit
[42:24] of the holy spirit amen
[42:27] i believe in good works and i believe
[42:30] it truly even if a man is not saved
[42:34] you have to be a good man and still have
[42:37] good works in his life
[42:38] and do the best you can for the glory of
[42:42] god
[42:43] amen oh hallelujah
[42:46] listen as i wind this up
[42:50] i know your love service faith and
[42:53] pensions
[42:54] that you are doing amen god is telling
[42:57] them again
[42:59] don't think that i've forgotten
[43:03] the world will tell you god doesn't care
[43:08] god doesn't know god is even blamed
[43:12] hurricanes come earthquakes come
[43:16] did jesus come and the first thing the
[43:19] devil
[43:20] puts in the minds of the people why did
[43:23] god do that
[43:24] he's not letting them know that he did
[43:27] that
[43:28] he is the author of evil he is the
[43:31] author of sin
[43:32] he is the author of wickedness and he is
[43:35] the chief
[43:36] one that loves to blame the other party
[43:40] from the book of genesis right to the
[43:43] end
[43:44] he will always blame others for his evil
[43:48] that he is doing and have the people
[43:51] hating god blaming god and say god did
[43:55] it
[43:55] god is a good god and only good
[43:59] flows out of god and the devil as a
[44:02] great man of
[44:03] old uh oral roberts said god
[44:06] is a good god and the devil is a bad
[44:10] devil evil flows out of the devil
[44:13] and only goodness flows out of god
[44:16] and here we are people are blaming god
[44:19] for all these things
[44:20] when they should blame the devil and
[44:23] turn their hearts to
[44:24] god and ask him for his great
[44:28] protection and love now the word
[44:31] tayatara
[44:33] has various meanings but amongst them
[44:38] is this meaning meaning
[44:41] continual sacrifice
[44:45] some have taken this to
[44:48] mean we should offer continual masses
[44:52] we should continuously go to mass we
[44:55] should continuously burn candles and
[44:57] incense
[44:58] we should continuously be that way
[45:01] and uh well let's leave that alone
[45:05] but i believe
[45:09] that this is speaking to us
[45:13] of saints continually
[45:16] offering themselves to god
[45:19] as living sacrifice suffices
[45:24] amen offering their service their lives
[45:28] their walk
[45:29] their future their everything to him
[45:33] not that jesus back there
[45:36] but christ in you the hope of glory here
[45:39] today
[45:41] and we offer ourselves to him
[45:44] in a continual sacrifice
[45:47] of our lives our labors
[45:51] to him are true believers
[45:55] of the lord yes
[45:58] surely those believers of that age
[46:02] were the cream of the crop of that
[46:06] particular time amen
[46:10] they were full of the holy ghost if you
[46:13] want to be the cream of god's crop
[46:15] you've got to be full of the holy ghost
[46:18] full of revelation
[46:20] amen full of faith amen glory to god
[46:25] and to recognize that you were
[46:29] created unto good works
[46:32] that's why god created us that we might
[46:35] live
[46:36] unto good works to express his salvation
[46:40] in the form of good works and that we
[46:43] might
[46:44] show forth his praise and honor and
[46:47] glory
[46:48] causing men to give praise and honor
[46:51] and glory to god because they'll say
[46:54] like
[46:54] as they said of jesus no man can do
[46:57] these miracles
[46:58] except god be with him and they'll be
[47:01] able to say of you
[47:03] no one could live righteous clean
[47:06] and good and honest in these
[47:10] crooked wicked perverted times no
[47:14] man can our woman can do that except
[47:17] god be with them and in them oh my
[47:20] brothers and sisters
[47:21] let's live such lies that we will
[47:25] gladly show forth his praise
[47:28] and give our lives that the world may
[47:31] see in us
[47:32] that we are living sacrifices
[47:35] unto the living god and we are bringing
[47:39] forth and showing to the world good
[47:42] works
[47:43] that flows from the spirit of christ
[47:47] who lives and reigns over our
[47:51] hearts and over our lives
