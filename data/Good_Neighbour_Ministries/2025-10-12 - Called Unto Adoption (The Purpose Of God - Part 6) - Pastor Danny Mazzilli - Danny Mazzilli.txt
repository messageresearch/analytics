But this morning, if I could but touch [Music] the hem of his garment, if I could but touch some part of his robe, I know I'd be here. My sins are forgiven. If I could baptize him, I know I'd be home. Somebody sing it over him. If I could baptize in the hem of his garment. If I could baptize some part of his world, I know I'd be here.

He's here. It's a kind of an oxymoron kind of a thing. We know that he's here, but we're going to ask him to bless and to do what? Have his way. How many want him to have his way? Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We know our place in this service and we know his place in this service. Let him have his place in us this morning. Right? Let's not do what he's supposed to do. We'll just get out of the way and let him do what he's supposed to do this morning. Amen. If it wasn't for the grace, for the grace of God in my life, where would I be today? And what would I have done with? Let's repeat that again. If it wasn't, oh, if it wasn't for the grace, for the grace of God, [Music] where would I be today? And what would I have done with my life? For it was not who had sought him, but it was Jesus who had sought me. His hand of love to me was gi. And now I belong to him. And I'm thankful this morning if it wasn't for the grave. Oh, brother Gerald, come lead us over. [Music] Where would I be today? And what would I have done with my life? See, I was so lost. Oh, I was so lost and blinded walking in the darkness of sin. [Music] But God predestinated me this day to walk in his love. If it wasn't for the grace. If it wasn't for the grace. [Music] Hallelujah.

It's something that um that uh we can certainly acknowledge and be proud of. Amen. That whenever you can uh achieve that uh level of service in the Lord in the same way that our precious former pastor John Simon and sister Desiree uh did and exceeded by many many over 50. Amen. And so, um, we can certainly, uh, appreciate that and see the results of it, the fruits of it. Amen. And we don't just see it here. We see it everywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. As as a part of this ministry, you go here, you go there, you see others that you've um, you know, that were, you know, members at one time here and that have moved on. You know, they moved to different churches, different areas. um all scattered all over Ontario, but many many many souls have come through this ministry. Amen. And so we can certainly uh say that we're proud to be a part of it. Praise God. And so we enjoyed some services there. Um we we got to enjoy Brother Marcus again yesterday morning. um you know if I don't know if if you tuned in or not but um he certainly uh he certainly uh did exactly like what he did here last Sunday and um you know he he he contacted me and he's the day before he oh brother I'm going to be ministering Saturday morning just to let you know you know I'll be bringing a similar thought you know because the Lord's leading me but you know I just want you to know cuz I know you're you're thinking about coming. I said brother I'm coming. I said are you kidding? I'm coming. I'm coming to get a double portion. Praise God. And we got a double portion, didn't we? Amen. I'll tell you, it was wonderful. Praise God. And he said, "Send my greetings." Cuz, you know, we had some time yesterday to talk and he just uh he was just so um blessed to be here last Sunday. He says, "Oh, brother." He says, "I so enjoyed, you know, um the uh time with your uh you know, with with the saints at Good Neighbor Ministries." He says, "Please send them my greetings. I so enjoyed the fellowship afterwards. You know, we went to the brother's house there." I said, "Oh, brother Mike." Yes. And sister Elaine. I said, "They're wonderful." Um you know, at at hospitality and and uh he said, "Oh, we had such a wonderful time of fellowship." I said, "Praise God." And so he just appreciates everything that um everybody participated and and you know we're we're uh there he he he says I've got new friends. I've got new friends. He says he says brother I feel such a wonderful connection. You know he says the friendship is is real. And you know I said yes brother it's it's that love of God &gt;&gt; that burns within our hearts. Amen. Praise God. And so we are so grateful for that. And so um let's um now move on. And uh I want to wish everybody a happy Thanksgiving. Amen. Praise God. I don't have like a specific Thanksgiving message for you today. Okay. I got something better. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I got something that that's uh that's right in the in the stream of what God wants to do in this day and in this hour. We've had many thanksgivings and we appreciate and and truly there's nobody that appreciates the Lord the way that that this that the sons and daughters of God appreciate and give thanks unto the Lord. She's got an attitude of gratitude all the time. Amen. And so we're so grateful to the Lord. And so may God bless you this Thanksgiving as you spend time with your families and with your friends, those that are online. We wish you a a very wonderful Thanksgiving weekend and uh may you come to realize how wonderful the Lord is um as you give thanks unto him first and then be thankful for your loved ones, your families, your friends and so forth. Praise God. And so we're going to go to the word of God. um we've been on a series of uh you know the purpose of God and I believe we can stay on that series for a long time because every time you know I go a little deeper and then the Lord opens up something else and so we've been looking at this series you know we started by recognizing and living the purpose of God and then we went to part two manifesting your purpose you know and looking at aspects of manifestations of the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost in our lives then we looked at the purpose purp of the Holy Ghost. And you know, because you know, people talk about the Holy Ghost, they've received the Holy Ghost, they think they've received the Holy Ghost and um and and not realizing what the purpose of the Holy Ghost is. And he has a purpose when he comes into your life. And it's his purpose for you according to his good pleasure. Amen. And this is all an element that just continues to unveil and unfold itself. And then we looked at do you understand the purpose of the Holy Ghost, you know, and and you you got to start looking at your your your self and looking at your situations and your conditions and start to truly understand how the moving of the Holy Ghost operates and moves in our lives and understanding what the Holy Ghost is. And we know that there's a difference between the anointing of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the Holy Ghost himself. Amen. And so, and then um you know, and then last week we looked at that the Holy Ghost produces a new birth and that there's a new birth in every dispensation. People talk about I've been born again, but they don't realize that there's a new birth under the dispensation of the message of God for your day. Amen. and that there's an element of a new birth that takes place that places you into the age and the dispensation of what the word is to produce in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so today we're going to move on and we're going to look at the element of being called to adoption. The purpose of the Holy Ghost and what the Holy Ghost does and what the new birth actually does is it calls us unto adoption as sons and daughters of God. Amen. And so let's go to our scripture. I'm sorry I've kept you standing so long, but we'll read our scripture from Ephesians chapter 1 verses 3-7. Amen. It says, "Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places." He didn't say some, he said all. Because this is the hour that we get it all. &gt;&gt; All the spiritual blessings. Amen. And they're available when we get into heavenly places. and according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundations of the world, that we should be holy without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath hath made us accepted in the beloved, in whom we have redemption through the blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Father, we're so grateful today, Lord. Many of us are dealing with so many different elements of this life and circumstances. But here today, Lord, this is our opportunity to come and and to assemble with you and know that you are present, that you're here with us, that you're that you've already you've already moved us into heavenly places through the worship, Lord. and we've prayed and Lord we've come and Lord we just want to be sincere and say father won't you help us today won't you speak to our needs today won't you Lord um just uh uh let your word become so real in the situations in our lives where we need the word Lord that's the standard that delivers us it's what gives us victory in our lives what gives us confidence Lord many of us you You know, there's some that are maybe sick and afflicted at home, Lord. My wife, you know, sister Jennifer, Lord, you know, having a little infection, Lord, and uh, you know, having to deal with some some medication and and and penicellin and it's just affected her, Lord. But you can you can change all of that even right now, Father. We just pray that you will Lord just set her completely. Liberate her, Father, and let this sickness leave her. And may she just rejoice as she accepts and receives that portion of perfect faith, Lord, that you've made available for each one of us. And Lord, there's many here that are that are in need. So Lord, my hands are in the air. Father, I need you this morning. Lord, I need you to come and I need you to take this vessel and just do and have your way. Father, with all the sincerity that's in my heart, Lord, I I I pray for the needs of your children and for the for this for this local flock that you've placed into our care, Father. May you touch, meet, heal, restore, open the blinded eyes, oh God, and raise up &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ for your glory. Father, we give you thanks and praise in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Praise God. You may be seated. Glory to God. We just read this wonderful scripture and you know uh the the thing that really um stood out when I read the scripture and I was studying was you know having predestinated us. And a lot of people look at that predestination and they look at that thought and you know that right away they think oh I'm predestinated to eternal life. No you're not. If you've got eternal life, there's never a time you didn't have eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. You're a son or a daughter of God. You were before the foundations of this world a son and daughter of God. Amen. So, you're not predestinated unto that. Read the scripture. It says you are predestinated unto the adoption &gt;&gt; of a son. And therefore, because we we are we're in this dimension. We're here in this life and we're dealing with the things of this life as human beings. We are in a process in this humanity of being transformed and being adopted by the spirit of God to become God himself, the word made flesh in this day and in this hour. Amen. God's word every time that he was sending his word, it was so that it could actually manifest him because in the beginning was the word. The words was with God. The word was God &gt;&gt; and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; And you know, this has to become more of a reality to us saints. And so we're we're we're looking at this this element of being uh progressively translated to where in the moment in the twinkling of an eye, we're going to be changed. &gt;&gt; But there's a process in all of that. And part of that process is our adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So here Paul is talking, you know, he's he's the first church age messenger to the first church age. And Paul's speaking here to the Ephesian church. Amen. And we know that the Ephesian church in the New Testament is a type of Joshua of the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; So, so Paul has this revelation. Paul was the first messenger. Paul was like, you know, like like like we heard, you know, when brother Marcus was talking about that Paul laid a foundation for the church and Paul had a revelation of the message for his day. And that's why he could say my gospel. That's why Paul he he he had a revelation that that he was, you know, the word in his day that the Holy Ghost had given him a a a revelation of the foundation of the church and that he was going to and that's why he could turn around and say that if an angel &gt;&gt; that even if an angel comes from heaven and says anything different than what I'm saying to you, &gt;&gt; let him be cursed. That's the kind of revelation that he had. He knew who he was. Amen. He understood his position in the word of God. He knew that he was laying a foundation. And when he talked to these Ephesians about adoption and about placing, he knew what he was talking about. But he still only had a portion. &gt;&gt; He had he did not have the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we're here. &gt;&gt; Why would God have to have seven messengers? Amen. Because each one of those messengers had a portion of the word that they would bring in their dispensation. And every one of those individuals that caught the revelation for their day under that dispensation, they got adopted as sons. &gt;&gt; And listen, when I'm talking about sons, I'm talking about you sisters, too. &gt;&gt; Okay? Sons, daughters. The scripture talks about adoption of children. Amen. Praise God. And so here all of them, they all came into their adoption. They all came into their placing. And yet, here we are a couple thousand years later. And we're talking about adoption. We had a prophet that came in our day &gt;&gt; that that, you know, and and this is and we're going to be looking at, you know, many of you know, we're going to have some quotes here from from the adoption series. If you get a chance, go back and read it. I don't know how long we're going to be on this, but I I'm just so enjoying it. Amen. Praise God. There's nothing new that I'm going to bring you, but I believe the Holy Ghost has something for us. Amen. Because it's him that's progressively moving us into that perfect place because we're going to have a you know, you know, we're going to have a like a full adoption and that's going to be in the body change. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. We're going to get a new robe, a new uh you know, praise God. Don't let me get ahead of myself. &gt;&gt; And so here Paul's speaking. He's talking about So Joshua came out under the ministry of Moses, under the ministry of Moses to, you know, to to to move the children of Israel into the promised land. Amen. You know, but it was not Moses that placed them. &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was Joshua &gt;&gt; that placed the children of Israel and gave them their positioning, their placing. Amen. God promised that he would be with them. Amen. Glory to God. If they would obey and come under the leadership of the Joshua commission. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. And so God has given us a promise. Amen. And so the land was promised to them before Joshua. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was promised to Abraham and to his seed. &gt;&gt; So Joshua was just fulfilling the the the promise of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything that you're doing that that I'm talking about that that the five-fold ministry is is unveiling to you is something that God already saw in the back part of his mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why he he predestinated us unto adoption. Amen. Glory to God. into the placing into our positions as sons and daughters of God. Glory to God. So, so we understand that the land was promised to them before that. It was promised to to Abraham and to his seed. And God sent us a Moses in our day. Amen. By the name of William Miam Branham. Glory to God. A ministry, the 20th century prophet who had a type of Moses. Actually, he typed Moses. He typed Joshua. He's a type of the Holy Ghost. The There's so many types in the ministry that were displayed through his ministry. Amen. Praise God. Glory to God. But here we are today and we recognized that the that the progression of the word has taken us now into the age where the five-fold ministry under under a new age. Amen. We're no longer under Leodysa. Amen. &gt;&gt; I like the way brother Marcus said it. He says, "Brother, I'm I'm not I'm not in Leodysia &gt;&gt; because I'm not blind." &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'm not wretched. I I'm not miserable. I I've got I've got the Holy Spirit. I got the Holy Ghost all over my life. He's given me a brand new life. Amen. He's given me a future. Glory to God. So, I don't know about you, but but here we are. We're under a new dispensation, and we know it as the age of the church. The bride, &gt;&gt; the bride age. Amen. This is the age where where Christ uh and and the bride become one. She comes into her fullness. The full adoption is going to produce the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what it's going to produce for you and me. Glory to God. Amen. So now we look to being, you know, uh translated by the Holy Ghost. Amen. through the adoption of our bodies. Amen. And so, um, you know, brother Brandham took us through the the church ages and that's why we recognize, you know, the messengers to to every age, each of them having a portion of the word, but the fullness of the word was something that was only made available in the evening time. Amen. This is where we we get it all. This is where the faith that we receive is going to be rapturing faith. It's going to be perfect faith. It's going to it's going to give full adoption. Amen. And this is what we want to look at here over these next few services. And so that's why we're looking to this element of being called to adoption. Amen. Praise God. And so, you know, I started to do a little bit of uh, you know, last week we we finished off last week where where we were talking about the new birth. And so, the new birth is actually only the beginning of your voyage, of your journey. A lot of people think that, you know, well, once once you know, you're you're you're born again, that that's it. You're in the kingdom. You're going, you're, you know, you're you're you're all set. there's nothing else for you to do. Hallelujah. You can just be a a Christian and and life is going to be wonderful and and everything's going to be just fine. How many are experiencing that? I'm 31 years down the road and I'm telling you, we got battles that we need to deal with and face and overcome. Amen. Praise God. Because God gave us the land. God promised us the land. God placed us in the land. But God says, "You possess it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so the new birth is something that that that is that is uh you know required. Amen. And that's why we you know we we uh read a a a um a quote you could put it up there from brother Brandham from spiritual amnesia because we're coming out of this amnesia. It's a constant, you know, amnesia that's being let, you know, released from our lives as we as we expand by the Holy Ghost, the word of God, and it's being revealed to us and being revealed by revelation to us. The amnesia just keeps, you know, keeps just falling off our lives. Amen. But here, Brother Brandon, he's talking about you that wants the Holy Spirit, you that wants the experience, not an emotional excitement. You want the Holy Ghost, the life, the germ of life inside you. And you can't get rid of that amnesia that's making you. You can't identify yourself until that amnesia comes off of you by the new birth. You're going to have a hard time identifying yourself in the body of Christ. And when you cannot identify yourself, how can you serve God? How can you serve the ministry? How can you serve within the body? You don't know your your identity. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so you you can't identify yourself. You don't know where you stand. You don't know what you are. My goodness, let's get rid of it right now. He says, there's a new birth here for you. A real real genuine new birth. Amen. And so, so, so you know, we we want to we want to platform from here because I believe that I'm talking to people that have that have receive the new birth. Amen. That have recognized the word for their day. &gt;&gt; That have recognized what the Holy Ghost and the purpose of the Holy Ghost is in this hour. Amen. This hour, this time. We listen, I can't come to you with with Noah's message. I can't come to you and say, "Hey, we need to build an ark because there's going to be great earthquakes and there's going to be a flood and you know, did you hear that California is going to get a big wave? &gt;&gt; I think we better build an ark and move to California." That's not the message of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. We need to know what God requires in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've heard it over and over and over again, but this is the element that places you in your rightful position as a son or a daughter of God. And so the evidence of the new birth is when you come out from your spiritual amnesia. Amen. And you recognize the word for your day, how it pertains to you personally. Amen. Otherwise, what are you doing in this church? There's a there's a thousand churches out there. There's one down the street here. It's got probably a thousand cars in the in the parking lot right now. There's a lot more people over there. They might Oh, well, maybe I should be there because that's where all the crowds are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, like &gt;&gt; what what is it? What element has brought you into where you are here amongst a few? &gt;&gt; Remember, it was always a few. Just go right back to the very beginning. And it's always been a few. &gt;&gt; Look at Abraham. &gt;&gt; He was with a whole clan of of people, but God came to him personal &gt;&gt; and said, "Separate yourself." &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. You know about when God comes and identifies you as an individual and says, "I got to do something in your life." And you know that when he did it, nobody else could do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you you you could say just like blind Barameus, they ask him, "What's going on, Barardemus? How is it that listen? I've been coming to your church for so many years. I don't know what you and I I heard it sounded like the word and everything else, but all I can tell you is that man, &gt;&gt; that Jesus, &gt;&gt; he did." So he I was as blind as a bat, &gt;&gt; but now I can see. Hallelujah. And this is the element that brings us into why we're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. And so how it pertains to you, what the word is to manifest through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants to bring this you know personal. He wants listen when a father is going to adopt a son first of all that son has to be born into that family. He's got to be naturally of that family. Amen. He was in the father before he became a manifested son. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So, you're not here by chance. &gt;&gt; You're here because you were already in the mind of God when he was back before the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he had a plan and you know he he's manifesting that plan and your identity in that plan is one of those attributes awakening out of spiritual amnesia &gt;&gt; because the water of the word comes to you in your day and boom something starts to &gt;&gt; bounce on the inside &gt;&gt; and then you know that wait a minute here I've I haven't heard this before I I haven't heard it in this way. Why why is it affecting me in the way that it's affecting me? What is this? This is called the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. And so there's many different churches out there that are talking about adoption. You can go and go on the internet and you can look up, you know, spiritual adoption and you will get all kinds of Christian churches that will give you an interpretation on adoption. But you know what? 95 to 99% of them are basing it out of a trinitarian God. How many fathers do you have? &gt;&gt; Right? You can't have more than one father. &gt;&gt; Okay? Unless you're, you know, you're adopted into another family or your mother and father are divorced and now you've got this other but I'm talking about your real father. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Your gene father. How many? &gt;&gt; One. &gt;&gt; One. There's only one. Amen. And so here now the foundation of adoption when it when when when you don't have the the right foundation like Paul said. Amen. If you don't have the right foundation then how do you know how who who's who's really anointing you and who's really adopting you? How do you know? Is it is it the Holy Ghost? Is it Jesus Christ his son? Or is it God the Father? Because there's three. And so right there, there's an element that that puts a question into your mind of what true adoption. God is not the author of confusion. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what we're going to be looking at here is God's way and the way that he's done it. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And by by knowing what he did yesterday, you can know exactly what he's going to do today, &gt;&gt; what he's doing right now, and what he's going to do into the future. Amen. It's just that people are not looking. They're they're constantly looking back. They're constantly looking forward, but they're never looking to what he's doing right now. &gt;&gt; And this is what we're interested in. Amen. And so, you can go to the next slide here. I want to look at the amplified version of um this very scripture that we read. And here it says, "Blessed and worthy of praise be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in heavenly realms in Christ." Just as in his love, he chose us in Christ. So wait a minute, he chose us in himself and now he's saying he chose us in Christ. It's because don't look at this scripture and say God the father and our lord. When it says God the father and our lord Jesus Christ, it's not talking about Danny Mazili and John Simon. It's talking about Danny Mazili and the spirit of Danny Misilli and the man, the individual of Danny Mazili, right? I'm just using like a a metaphor here. So, if you've seen me, you haven't seen my wife. You haven't seen my father. My father's in a retirement home. He's he's he's still alive. Jesus said, "If you've seen me, you've seen the Father." &gt;&gt; It's I that speaketh to thee. &gt;&gt; I am He. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Same self person. Amen. Praise God. And so, so, and when when he talks about being in Christ, he's talking about being in the anointed word. &gt;&gt; In the anointed word &gt;&gt; that we're in right now. We are in the anointed word. We are we are Christ in the present stage of his ministry. The word anointed for this day and for this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see it's it's understanding. So here now he's actually selected us for himself as his own. Amen. Be when did he do it? Before the foundations of the world. So that we would be holy. that is consecrated, set apart for him, purpose-driven. Remember we talked about what holy is. People think holy, you got to live clean and you got to be just completely, you know, consecrated and you all you do is fast and pray every day and every time you see somebody is, oh, God bless you. God bless you. That's not what he's talking about being holy. That's being righteous. That's self-righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Being holy is being set apart for God's purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what being holy means. God has a purpose in adopting you. God has a purpose in giving you the Holy Ghost. God has a purpose in placing himself in you. Jesus said, "You'll know that I am in you." We need to come to this element. And when he comes into you, it's so that he can fulfill his purpose, &gt;&gt; his desire, his will for his glory. And this is the challenge for us as adopted sons because we still have this battle that goes on within our flesh as as human beings that our will wants to fight his will. What was the fight in at at Gethsemane? Wasn't it Jesus said not my will &gt;&gt; but thy will. Wasn't there a struggle for will for for you know because because we as human beings, we're still human. We're still going to feel the elements and the pressure of this dimension and everything else. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. But God wants us to to, you know, to to to die out to our will so that so that our purpose becomes his purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; All the things that we start to do and live and and manifest once we've been born again now we start to place it in in in in line with his purpose. Amen. So, you know, and we're going to be looking a little more at that. Okay. So, let's let's just move on here. So, set a apart for him and purpose-driven. Amen. And blameless in his sight. Glory to God. Now, you're never going to be perfect. Okay. But in his sight, you are blameless. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. He sees you through the blood. &gt;&gt; He sees the, you know, it's all it's it's all, it's everything. He saw you. He saw that that you would overcome in this age. &gt;&gt; And that's how he could predestinate you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so he pre now watch. He goes on blameless in his sight. In love he predestinated. and loving lovingly planned for us to be adopted to himself, his own children through Jesus Christ. Amen. And when we talk about through Jesus Christ, we're not talking about another person here. Amen. It's because of what Jesus Christ did. Amen. We could not be adopted but by Christ coming to give his life for yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to see that in a in a more in depth as we move along here. in accordance with the kind intention and good pleasure of his will to the praise of his glorious grace and favor which he so freely bestowed on us in the beloved Jesus Christ his son. In him we have redemption. That is our deliverance and salvation through his blood which paid the penalty for our sin and resulted in the forgiveness and complete pardon of our sin in accordance with the riches of his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh listen. when he when he came and paid the price, everything that you were going to need in order to to be an adopted son, every element and every authority that you would require as a son or daughter of God, he paid the price for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. There's nothing and and listen and you and you let's move along here. Let's look at some natural aspects. Okay? I just, you know, I was just digging in, you know, and looking up certain things and as the Lord was just giving me say, you know, so this morning, early this morning, he gave me this thought about look at the natural aspects of adoption. People talk about adoption and I'm not talking about adoption of just children. Okay? So don't think of, you know, just adop just look at the word adoption. People, businesses, big corporations, they're adopting new products. or adopt, you know, we're in the process of an adoption of this new process by which we will, you know, do this or replace that or, you know, uh, whatever, right? And so I I looked it up and I came up and the these are the things that came up and and there was five stages of an adoption process that I found to be quite common in all of the different aspects of of adoption, right? And I started to read it and I said, "Oh, this is interesting." You know, and I just started to draw certain things from it. But there's five stages of adoption process. And this model outlines the journey a person takes from beginning or from becoming aware of an innovation to adopting it. So you you become aware, you know, like so so let's let's look at this in different ways here. you you become aware like you know remember you know there's other people that haven't heard this right and so we want to lay in a foundation for them and give them something that they can kind of associate with you know if they're non-Christian and they haven't received the word for their day and so you know Jesus said feed my sheep he said also feed my lambs amen so I like to keep things simple sometimes and and you know give a little portion for the lambs amen and so here now he goes So the first thing is awareness. The individual learns about the new idea or product. You know many people have not heard this message. They and so they become aware of what the potential is in serving the Lord Jesus Christ. But what makes your product different brother or sister? You know when you're out there and you're testifying. And so the first element is the individual learns about the new idea or the new product and they so they they they they stumble into it. They start to look into it. They start to peer into the word of God. They start to see your life. They start to peer into your you as an example and the way that you live and and the way that you display yourself as a Christian and they become aware. And then there's a research number two a research and discovery aspect where the individual starts to seek more information. And so you start looking a little deeper into this element because remember this person is a is is in a process of adoption. Right? We're looking at the natural aspects. And then there's evaluation and decisionmaking. The individually mentally starts to weigh the pros and the cons. boy, if I can serve the Lord, this is the benefits of serving the Lord. If I can, you know, I know there's some cons that are, you know, a part of it too, I'm going to be rejected. I'm going to be dealing with family and friends that are going to think that, you know, oh, what's the matter with you? Have you been brainwashed? Have you been, you know, what's going on? Amen. These are all these little elements that, you know, that that look. And then comes number four, the trial, you know, and there's a trial process. And you know, the individual uses the new idea or product on a small scale. Well, maybe I'll try this. Maybe I'll pray about this or maybe pray about that and see if this actually is going to produce change in my life. I'm trusting that we're way further down the road, saints. Amen. Praise God. But then there's this element that goes to the next stage of adoption or rejection. And listen, let's face it, this is not for everybody. This is not going to be this is not an adoption that's going to be that the whole world is going to get adopted as sons and daughters of God. It's not to all the world. It's to the sons and daughters, the children of God. Amen. And so the children of God, they will receive the word. &gt;&gt; They will not reject the word. But there will be those that will reject the word. And there's nothing wrong with that because the scripture says they will reject it. &gt;&gt; Now these are factors that influence the adoption. And this model identifies five characteristics of an innovation that that influence its rate of adoption. Okay. So the so the speed at which an individual can get transformed and you know just just let your mind uh you know uh elaborate you know use pronouns and adjectives and let the Holy Spirit just kind of you know stir your hearts. Relative advantage the degree to which an innovation is perceived as better than the idea that supersedes it. Amen. That you know is is it better to serve God? I don't know. Does everybody feel that it's better to serve the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. I think that, you know, when you look at the the advantages of serving God, we there's many many advantages to serving the Lord. Amen. Compatibility, the degree to which an innovation is perceived as being consistent with the existing values, past experiences, and needs of a potential adoption. You know, you know, people listen, all you got to do is look back on your life and know that that this proved to be the right decision. Amen. It proved to that that it was good. It was right to serve the Lord. Amen. To take the Lord at his word and allow him to mold and shape and bring new ideas into your life to transform you from the from the condition that you were in to the condition that he's now placed you in. Amen. the complexity, the degree to which an innovation is perceived, whether it's difficult to understand or not. Listen, this church is not built on understanding the word of God. This church is built upon spiritual revelation. &gt;&gt; You need God to reveal to you the word and who you are. And there's no complexity when it comes to that. Amen. God reveals the trial ability. Don't worry. You're designed to overcome every single trial &gt;&gt; because God doesn't God doesn't choose you from before the foundations of the world knowing that you're not going to be able to overcome the trial. But in that trial, there is something in there that you need that that's going to mold and shape you to exactly what he wants you to be. Because God does not rate you based on your ability. God does not rate you based on your loyalty. God rates you based on character &gt;&gt; that you develop by going through the fire and becoming more like him. Amen. So so trialability, I'll tell you, you know, you're you're you're you're already you're already designed to overcome. Amen. Praise God. And observability, the degree to which the results of an innovation are visible to others. Oh, praise God. I don't know about you, but can people see Jesus Christ in you? Can people see his life being expressed through your life? Can people see you going through trials and then see you a week later rejoicing? &gt;&gt; Amen. Can people see that? Listen, no matter what comes this person's way, my God, they just keep that I'm I'm observing that they just keep getting back up again. &gt;&gt; What is it in them? What is it that that I see them every Sunday? &gt;&gt; I see them Wednesday nights. &gt;&gt; The neighbor. Where you going? Going to church. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's nice. &gt;&gt; Sunday. Where you going? Going to church. &gt;&gt; Oh, well that's that's cool. Next week. Where you going? Going to church. Well, you go to church often, eh? Where you going? Prayer meeting. Oh. Oh, that's interesting. Where you going? Special meetings this weekend. Meetings for what? church. Hallelujah. Going to meet with the Lord. Amen. What what what's going they've observed some kind of a change in your life that that they just it's just it just seems to be so real to you as an individual and and they're they're starting to say, "Well, you know, maybe maybe I should uh let you know, get to know a little bit more about this church." Amen. Praise God. And so, you know, um that's the natural aspects. And then it talks about here that there was five qualities for adoptive parents right now a parent that's adopting. So here now you know like you know maybe you put yourself in in God's shoes for a moment here and you can look at you know at you know how God is looking you know well I I'm thinking about adopting here and so he looks at flexibility. He looks at your attitude the ability to adapt to the unique complexities and multiple relationships with an adoptive family. God starts to look at you in the way that you interact with one another. &gt;&gt; How do you interact with one another? Do you have that family love for one another? &gt;&gt; These are things that you know that you know we get scarred sometimes. Listen, we're all scarred human beings. Let's face it. Every single one of us, we're scarred human beings and we take a beating every week. I don't know about you, but every week you got to deal whether you and I'm not talking about a physical beating. I'm talking about the the the mental oppression that you got to deal with every single day as a son or a daughter of God because that's the greatest battle right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister, brother, listen. You got to believe the word. It's the word that God sent you that's going to give you the overcoming ability to deal with this age to overcome this age to overcome this flesh to overcome the battles of the of the of relationship issues to overcome you know we weak and tired and overworked situations it's God giving you that ability. Amen. Praise God. But you know he's looking for your attitude. He's looking for flexibility in your attitude. Then he's looking at self-awareness. He's looking at understanding one's own feelings and how they impact the family. God's looking at you and the way that you deal with your, you know, with your own um, you know, your own heartaches, your own, you know, you talk to a person and that person just talks to you and says one little thing that gets you upset right away. You got an attitude. Right away. you don't want to talk anymore, you get quiet, you know, uh, you know, self-awareness, right? We need to be self-aware. We need to know that this thing is our enemy. &gt;&gt; It'll fight you. It's at emnity with God. Remember that your carnal mind is at emity with God. &gt;&gt; This is the hour that we need to overcome these things. &gt;&gt; God, listen, the five-fold ministry is for what? Perfecting. So, you're going to get a lot of perfecting. Amen. Praise God. as as part of of of God, you know, dealing with our lives. And God is saying, examine your attitude. Examine your your ability to deal with situations. Understand the other person's situation. Place yourself in their situation. Know that God has given you a power. Listen, there's an authority that comes with an an adopted son or daughter of God. E &gt;&gt; there's an authority that comes with it. We're going to learn a lot more about this and it's going to develop our ability to overcome situations in our lives in a practical way because unless you can start dealing with the practicalities of how to handle this this human vessel because this is not what God's adopting. But he's adopting that he he's he's placed you in contact with your theophony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now I'm going to get a little bit ahead of myself. Okay. But this is the element that that we're that that this is what's going to produce the rapture. Remember, you've been you you when you came into contact with this message, you actually came into contact. We say, "Oh, we've seen the light. We've received the Holy Ghost. We I I I've given my heart to Jesus Christ." Let me tell you what's actually really happened. You've made contact with the eternal part of God that you are &gt;&gt; which is called the theophony. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you've come into contact with your theophony, it starts to feed you by revelation what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are in contact with this. It's an element which is a supernatural element that is changing your body. But if you don't understand how to deal with this human part here, you're going to be fighting against yourself. You're going to be living underprivileged based on who you are as a son of God. But you know what? It's okay because God doesn't come to adopt babies. &gt;&gt; God's looking to adopt sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's move on here. Glory to God. And so it goes on. It talks about curiosity, a desire to understand each other, a child's state, the biological family, their identity, understanding one another in the body of Christ, you know, as sons and daughters of God, as as as you know, those that are of the faith. Amen. Praise God. Coming into the unity of the faith. Praise our God. Forever more. And patience. Looking at patience. You know, now this is a a these are parents that are looking to adopt children. And these are some of the elements that is a very common way that they naturally will evaluate a child. &gt;&gt; They'll look at the way if that child, you give the child a candy, it takes the candy and throws it in your face. This kid's got attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God's looking at your attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's looking at all these aspects of, you know, patience and the ability to allow that child to integrate into the body of Christ. God wants you to God wants to mold you so that you can so that you can be edifying to the body. Because remember, he's called you personally according to his purpose and according to his good pleasure, not your pleasure. We got a lot of pleasures in this life and God don't mind you having pleasure. But make sure that pleasure doesn't interfere with his purpose in your life in this day and in this hour. Amen. And empathy, the capacity to understand and share feelings of the child and other family members. Amen. And so this is, you know, what we're talking about that that ability to to to work together and to to support one another. And, you know, God is looking to adopt sons and daughters of God that are that are willing to to get into their position to to listen, the the reason why he predestinated you is because he knew that you would want to do it, but you would have to overcome certain things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so, let's move on. Now, let's go to the spiritual applications. Amen. You know, we're laying in a foundation today and then we're going to go from here. All right? So you know when we look at the key definition of adoption the Greek term the word of adoption which is huthisia signifies the formal act of placing someone in the position of an adult son giving them the full rights and responsibility that come with it. Now if you go back into the Roman times when they did this form of adoption because it was very common that the father would put the son under tutors and would you know get them you know molded and shaped and prepared to where they would come to the place where he could publicly bring them before the people and and place them before the people and at that point he'd put a robe on them and he'd say this is my adopted son. In other words, he was saying, "This is the one now that I am transferring." Remember, it's a form of adoption. God is in a in an adoption process. That's what he's done right from the very beginning. It's God been manifesting himself in different forms of different uh manifestations in different dispensations. That's what the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit has been doing right from the very beginning. And so there's this adoption process. And he places the full authority on that son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can now sign the checks. &gt;&gt; He can now hire and he can now fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound. Whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you've been given that authority and you've been placed by the Holy Ghost and you're now moving in that in that position as a as a an adopted son or daughter of God, you are you are growing in your authority. You are growing in your re in in your revelation of God because revelation is progressive. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. The fullness of the word has come. Amen. And we know that the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead, if it dwell in you, it'll quicken your mortal body. But guess what? You're still here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why? Because you're in process. You're in progress. You're you're you're you're a son that's being that you're now in in the adoption process because you've been born again by the spirit of God. You've recognized the word for your day. Now you need to come under submission to the word so that it can do and train and mold and shape you as a son or daughter of God to overcome whatever comes your way. &gt;&gt; Cuz you are &gt;&gt; victorious &gt;&gt; in God's eyes. You're already victorious. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we've got to go through the process. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so when the adoption comes, it signifies that that that the full authority is being placed into the son, which is why God gives you the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; God gives you the Holy Ghost, which is himself now in you to take his purpose to the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this is what he's doing. He's placing his spirit. And what does it do? It liberates you from the law. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You no longer come under the bondage of the law. &gt;&gt; You are no longer under under a lost spirit. You're like the master that used to, you know, the ones he put you under, those school masters, they're under you now. &gt;&gt; What? Quiet. Go get me something. &gt;&gt; Get my bath. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You see, all of a sudden, the authority changes. Amen. And you're no longer under the law of the school master. Now you're walking with authority as a son or a daughter of God in this hour. Amen. Glory. And it transforms you. Amen. Through adoption, we become uh you know, we we we are declared justified. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. God not only chose you, not only called you, chose you, he he he justified you, he sanctified you, and he's now he's going to glorify you with the robe &gt;&gt; of a body change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. So, this is this is God's plan. This is something listen, it was his idea, his purpose, his thoughts. It's not something that he okay you know it something that you know was an afterthought where he says you know uh you know I'll make it a plan you know I'll make it plain to us that it was before listen it was before the foundations of the world and he knew who would be adopted because they would eventually mature into sons and daughters of God &gt;&gt; he knew that you would &gt;&gt; not a guess it's not something he just, you know, oh well, the world's going to go into sin and uh, you know, I'm just going to I'm just going to have this plan and everybody, whoever wants it, can be adopted. No, that's not the way it was done. God, because of his ability in the beginning, God, the self-existent one, God was alone with his thoughts, which means he wasn't alone. you were there &gt;&gt; because you're part of his thoughts. &gt;&gt; But he had a plan and he knew that you'd be one of those thoughts in this age that would mature into a son of God. Let's look at the next slide. 1960, brother Brandham in adoption series number two, he says, "Your adoption is not your birth." People think, "Oh, I'm adopted now. I've been born again. I'm adopted." No, that just starts your adoption. Listen, he goes, "Your adoption is your placing." When you were born again, John 1:17, I believe, "When we were born of the spirit of God, we are sons of God, but we were predestinated." He stops right there. Now, here's what I'm trying to get to. For this, sons of the last day. What? Sons of the last day. Yeah. those in those that that would be coming after that would receive the Holy Ghost. We've been in the end time now. We're the ones that have received the Holy Ghost for our day. So, we are the sons for the last day. He goes on, he says to to to see we were predestinated to what did he say? Unto adoption. Like we were saying earlier, we're not predestinated unto, you know, going to heaven. There's nowhere in the scripture where you will find you are predestinated to go to heaven. If you're a son of God, you're a daughter of God, you're eternal, you came from God, you're going back to God. &gt;&gt; This is all about going back. &gt;&gt; This is about we were there, now we were. Now we're here, and now we're going back. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you're being but but he says, but you're predestinated unto adoption. Because here on earth, God had to have a plan &gt;&gt; by which he would call his sons and daughters and by which he would call his end time church for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Remember this is all for the rapture. The adoption now is talking about adoption of bodies for the rapture, adoption of our theophes. Amen. This is what we are being adopted into. That's the that's that's the plan of God. Remember that's what he wanted to do in the beginning. Adam was in a theophony body. Amen. When God made him in his image, God made Adam in his image. Called their name Adam. It was it was Adam and Eve. They the both of them were in one body and they shared a theophony. Brother Bram says that they shared a theophony body. And that theophony body when Eve was separated, they were still in theophony because they were eternal. That body had no death. Eve goes now and submits to the will of the serpent. What happens? Jesus now God, Adam, the first Adam, he goes and gives up his theophony to save Eve. &gt;&gt; What do you mean he gave up the theophony? Simple. Without a theophony, no eternal life. He forfeited eternal life right there and then. He gave himself for her. He left his theophony right there and then and took on human flesh. And that's why he died after 900 and whatever years. Do you see that? &gt;&gt; You're a little bit quiet. He gave up the theophony so that he could go for his wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. What did Jesus do? &gt;&gt; He come now. He gives his life so that he could go back to his theophony. &gt;&gt; But he had to pay a price. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is the whole process that we're going to be looking at here over the next week or two on how we are connecting back to our theophies &gt;&gt; and how it's going to bring us into the fullness of the change. Hallelujah. Praise God. So here go let's let's go to the next slide. Oh, did I finish reading this one? &gt;&gt; Okay, go back, please. We were predestinated unto adoption. Now, now here we are. Now, this is what hurts the Pentecostals a little. They say, "I got born again. Praise the Lord. I got the Holy Ghost." Fine. You're a child of God. That's right. But yet, that ain't what I'm talking about. See, you're predestinated unto adoption. Adoption is the placing of a son. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And unless you come into this adoption process that I'm talking about here this morning, &gt;&gt; there's no rapture for you. Hallelujah. Glory to God. This is the process by which God is going to take us out of this dimension. &gt;&gt; Amen. So here, let's go to the next slide. But now to place, how are you? You're first born into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost. How many knows that? All right. The next, you are predestinated unto the what? Adoption. What is that? You are predestinated unto placing. So listen, you're not in this church by chance and you're not in this local body to do nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're here for a purpose. What we're going to be looking at here over the next couple weeks is is is we're going to be discovering a little bit more how it is that God is using us. How God is is uh you know placing us because it's all about now placing. Amen. You are predestinated unto the placing. That's what you're predestinated to do. So the first thing you need to know about your adoption into God's family through Christ is that God chose you positionally predestinated you for a position in love for adoption. And when did he do it? Before the foundations of the world. Amen. Glory to God. And so here now let's let's move on. Says here adoption can only come through Christ. We know that &gt;&gt; you can't even be adopted unless you recognize Jesus Christ gave up the ghost so that he could send it back onto you because the adoption process starts by you receiving the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; which is the new birth for this hour. And here now let's read it. Okay, let's go to the next slide. Ephesians 1:es 9-11 he says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure with he which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him. So, so he's talking about every son and daughter of God is going to be brought in. Pay attention. Now, &gt;&gt; he goes on here in verse 11, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you've got an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's an element. Listen, there's many different kinds of inheritances. Okay? He but let's finish the scripture. He says being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will &gt;&gt; not your will, not your desires. Everything that everything that's in that book, that book of inheritance gives you your complete placing and authority. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's an inheritance for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says it very clearly. In whom we have obtained. Now, now you you know people would say, "Well, yeah, brother. I mean, Jesus died for me. I accepted Jesus. I inherit eternal life." No. No. You obtain it by predestination unto the adoption as a son or daughter of God. You obtain it. It's not just automatic. Everybody can claim out there. There's a lot of people that are claiming out there, hey, Jesus Christ died for my sins. I now I'm I'm free. I I I'm I'm going to heaven. God has adopted sons and daughters who have an inheritance coming to them. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And the inheritance is not something that we're going to get later on when we get there. We're not looking for that inheritance because when the the the final aspect of of our translation puts us into our theophony body where we are going to end up ruling and reigning as one with Christ. &gt;&gt; We're not going to need an inheritance then. &gt;&gt; You need an inheritance now. &gt;&gt; It's like a lot of people out there, &gt;&gt; okay? A lot of people out there looking for inheritance. They say, you know, they're waiting for mom and dad. &gt;&gt; They're looking They're looking to mom and dad for for for their inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. They'll go, you know, listen, I in Italy, my my sister was telling me, and you know, I hear that in Italy now. No, no, no, no. We ain't waiting for you to die. What? You come and live with us and sign everything over now. It's not like you have a choice because they're older, you know? We want it now. And people are looking for the inheritance now. Well, God has an inheritance for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and this inheritance that he's got for you, it's it's it's going to blow your mind. &gt;&gt; It's it's going to give you it's going to give you everything that you need. He says, "I'm going to give you houses and lands here and over there." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let's read the next quote here. He goes on. And he says, "Now a little farther now. Now the 11th verse, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance." Oh, an inheritance. Brother Bram says, "Somebody has to leave you something to inherit it." Is that right? An inheritance. What inheritance do we have? What inheritance did I have? I didn't have any, but God left me an inheritance when he put my name on the Lamb's book of life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. God placed your name in that book. Listen, you go to a lawyer and you say, "I'm here. I'm here to, you know, to hear the inheritance. My mom and dad died, you know, and and I oh, they got millions of dollars and I'm here. Where's the lawyer? Come on. Let's get this over with." And he's sitting there and there's three, four other people at the table. Brother, sister, brother. Starts calling the names. He doesn't hear his name. Well, what's going on here? &gt;&gt; The father didn't put your name &gt;&gt; in the book. &gt;&gt; There's Listen, there's going to be a lot of people. That's why the scripture makes it very clear. Those whose names were written in the Lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; before the foundations of the world have an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm looking for that inheritance right now as a son of God. I don't want to wait until I get over to the other side. I'm not Look, listen Listen, I need it now. Come on, saints. &gt;&gt; You need to overcome situations in your life. You got circumstances you got to deal with. You got relationships that need to be healed. You've got healing that's required in your body. Listen, I don't know about you, but when the children of Israel, when they were taken out of bondage out of is out of Egypt, they went out with great substance. Hallelujah. I'm looking for great substance in this hour. And you know what? My father is rich. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He's He owns the cattle on a thousand hills. He says, "I have an inheritance. My name's written in the book." Glory. He said, "Watch." He goes on now and he says, "Put my name on the Lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world." Oh, you say, "Now wait a minute, brother. Jesus did that when he died for you." No, he never did. Hallelujah. Jesus come to purchase that inheritance. &gt;&gt; The one that Adam lost when he lost that book. It was that theophony. It was that life. It was that eternal aspect of God that he gave up. It was the It was the tree of life. All of a sudden, he couldn't get to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; But he says, "You can get back to it." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's what God has prepared for you. And he's placed your name there. And he says, "Now read very next, very next line. In whom we also have obtained apparent obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his good will." God chooses. We don't choose. People say I chose Jesus. Hallelujah. Now I am free. He never listen. You didn't choose Jesus. &gt;&gt; You You know people, oh I found Jesus. You never found Jesus. &gt;&gt; When Jesus finds you, you know you've been found. &gt;&gt; You understand that you would you'd have never looked in these places to find him. &gt;&gt; You'd have never found him the way that he found you and then he revealed himself to you. You'd have never gone there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close now and I'll let the musicians come. I'm going to close with a couple of quotes, last quotes here. He says, now let's let's go on. Adoption number four. Look, has predestinated us unto this inheritance. Now, if I'm right, inheritance of something, if God is knocking at my heart and saying, "William Brandham, I called you a long time ago before the foundations of the world to preach the gospel." &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Could that be his inheritance? Let's read. He says, "I I have an inheritance, an inheritance of eternal life." Now, God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me. &gt;&gt; How's how's this word going to be how's eternal life going to become real to you? How is this inheritance going to become real to you? I don't know about you, but when my father gives me an inheritance and he gives me $100,000, it's real in my hands. &gt;&gt; I can see it. &gt;&gt; I can put it into my bank account. Amen. &gt;&gt; I could apply it to some debt to get rid of certain things or I can go out and buy my wife something beautiful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to get a cookie for that. Hallelujah. You see, it's a real something. It's a substance. It's something that's in your hand. He says, "Now listen." He says, "God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing I could do to it to inherit it. It was blank. It was valid. There's nothing I could do. But in the fullness of time, God sent in his own good time, Jesus, the lamb slain from the foundations of the world, his blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance to be what? What inheritance? The sunship to be a son or a daughter of God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Not when I'm out of this time. I'm a son of God. Now &gt;&gt; you're a daughter of God. Now you can claim your inheritance. Now you can claim what your what what your father has promised you. He's promised you healing. Take it, brother. &gt;&gt; He's promised you uh uh relationships. Take it, sister. &gt;&gt; He's promised you all the financial all the all the prosperity that you have need of that you have need of according to his purpose, according to his good pleasure. If God sees it fit to put two million, three million, 10 million &gt;&gt; or $10 &gt;&gt; into your hands, &gt;&gt; it's what you need &gt;&gt; for his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we'll end with this. And now, this may just choke you to death, but did you know that men that's that are sons of God are amateur gods? Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the hour where we're coming into our fullness. &gt;&gt; This is where we accept the word. We believe the word. Whatever aspect has to be moved out of the way. Whatever God has to deal with, let him deal with it. Amen. Did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur gods? How many ever know that? How many knows that Jesus said so? That the Bible said Jesus said, "Did not your law say itself that you are God's?" And if you call them gods, which God God said in Genesis chapter 2, he's talking about Adam back in his original state. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where him and Eve had full dominion, full authority, full power over the earth. Amen. That's what he's talking about. He says they were gods because they were had full domain over the dominion of the world. He give him dominion over all things and he lost his godship. He lost his sunship. He lost his domain. And Satan took it over. &gt;&gt; But brother, we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Not somewhere down the road. Now. &gt;&gt; Now. Amen. Praise God. He says, "Waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top." How many knows we're in the capstone age? &gt;&gt; How many knows that love is moving and sweeping and and and dealing and and and moving into our lives where we're where we're seeing everything different. We we recognize the sinner out there. We're not looking at them and and and blaming them for their condition. We're saying, "Listen, there's a better way. Come this way." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got to have a heart for the people. You got to show sympathy for the people. You got to show the love of God. Amen. You got to show the same love that Jesus showed. Amen. When he gave his own life, glory to God. He says when the pyramid gets up to the top, when the full sons of God will be manifested, when the power of God will walk out, hallelujah, and will take every power that Satan's got away from him. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It belongs to him. Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Go to the last the very last slide. The very last slide. Right to the very end. Happy Thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Praise God. This is what we are thankful for. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we be thankful for anything &gt;&gt; greater than this? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Blessed be the name.
