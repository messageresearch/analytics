TRANSCRIPT
========================================
life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it should bring a completely fresh experience with God every single day that you feast on the word of God. Amen. Praise God. So, we had some tremendous meetings there. While we were there, um, you know, uh, Brother Isaiah's granddaughter, you know, when she was, you know, I could tell right away when when I first met her, you know, um, on the Saturday night, there was something stirring in her heart and she was asking questions and I was saying, "Wow, she's asking me the right what this is while we're driving to the services because she lives with brother Isaiah. You know, the family lives together and she's asking I said, "Wow, she's asking the right questions." I said, "Praise God." I believe, you know, something's stirring in her heart. Well, anyway, by the end of the weekend, she wanted to be baptized again. She had been baptized and but but uh she realized that that uh you know something and and I was talking to her. I said, "Well, obviously something has changed on the inside, sister, that never happened." The she says, "Yes." And she was really just feasting on the word and zealous. And so anyways, um on the Sunday after the service, they they um um use a pool in one of the local uh hotels in the area. And so we went to this hotel and we went and she was baptized there. Uh brother Isaiah baptized her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And while we were sitting there, you know, I'm sitting and I'm watching and I'm looking and I look over at the window. you could put up the the the picture there. And if you'll notice in that picture, I took a picture with brother Isaiah and his daughter. And then I said, "What do you see in that mirror in that in that window?" And they both looked at it and it was like the cloud in the picture. And they and they both said, "That's the cloud." I said, "How long you've been baptizing in this place?" They said, "Well, we've been coming here and baptizing." I said, "Well, praise God." I said, "I believe God is meeting his people right here, vindicating his presence." Amen. And so, um, we were very blessed, uh, for the Lord to vindicate, um, you know, our dear sister Michaela being baptized. And the next picture, I said, "Well, I got to get into this picture, too." So, I, you know, I I got into the picture and I said, "Praise God. I was there. I witnessed it. I saw it. Praise God." And so I'm very grateful to the Lord um for his wonderful move uh in Iowa last weekend. Praise God. But that was last weekend. We're interested in what God has for us today. Amen. You've come here today because you're interested in what the Lord has available for us. Amen. I'm excited about the word of God. I'm also excited about the upcoming Christmas um dinner that we will be hosting here at the Burlington Convention Center. I'm expecting to see everyone every single one of you um that are in this household of faith. You are part of the family of God. Uh uh guests are welcome also visitors are welcome to join us for the dinner. You just need to put your name on the bulletin board there. There's a list and we want you to put your name there and uh how many people will be coming with your family. I don't want any excuses. Oh, brother, we're having a hard time right now. That doesn't matter. Put your name on the on the list. You know how things are done uh here. We trust God. Amen. We believe God. And so God wants every one of his children at the Christmas table this year. Amen. Praise God. So, I'm looking forward to seeing every single one of you there. Amen. Let's let's all stand. Let's all go to the word of God now as we um surrender ourselves. I trust that uh you've been praying. Amen. And that you have an expectation for the Lord to give us something. I'm just as expectant as you are. Amen. Let's pray. And let's ask the Lord to come. Father, we just so appreciate it every time that we come together in this way. Father, where you come, where you are the mighty angel, where you are the director, the guide, the inspiration in the midst of your children, Lord, that you're the one that breaks the bread of life and gives understanding to the hearts. Lord, it's only by revelation that we walk with you in this day and in this hour. And so we ask you to come and minister to our hearts, Lord. Speak to us this afternoon, Lord. Let our hearts burn within us, Lord, as we uh feast upon your word. Lord, I'm just a man, but I surrender this vessel to you now in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, we commit this service and each and every need that's in every heart. Lord, you know each one. Father, may you meet that need now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Praise God. Let's um we've been on this series uh today. We're on part 11 of um the purpose of God and called unto adoption. We've been looking at obtaining our inheritance. It's all part of the adoption of sons and daughters of God. Amen. And uh last time that we ministered, we ministered on the fellowship of the mystery. Uh today we want to continue on that. We want to look at um so call it part two of the fellowship of the mystery and we're just uh trusting that the Lord is going to unveil to us a little bit more about this tremendous uh walk that we have with the Lord. Amen. This is not just a regular Christian uh church. Amen. We believe in the supernatural. We believe that God is is moving in this hour. Amen. and that there's individuals that have recognized that. Amen. Let's read our scripture from Colossians chapter 1 verses 25- 27. Um Paul's speaking here. He says, "Whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God." Amen. So he realized that he was a part of the word and that he was given a portion of the word to to bring forth so that it could fulfill the word. Amen. In his particular day. Amen. And he goes on to say here, even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints. Amen. to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. Praise God. I love that. To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles. And then he goes to tell us what the mystery is, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. Amen. Praise God. What it truly is to be a a a a son or a daughter of God. What it is to be a Christian. People talk about Christianity. There's churches that are full today. &gt;&gt; But there's a revelation to the sons and daughters of God. What is the true meaning of Christ in you? &gt;&gt; The meaning of being a Christian. Amen. Uh let's read the quote here. Brother Brand is speaking here in Christ the mystery of God revealed. He says, "Now for a text, I want to take out of there this for a text basing it upon the entire Bible." Not take note of this, but I want us title this Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; Christ being the mystery of God revealed. Now, I took it in order as a Sunday school lesson so we could all read together and have this fellowship together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so, you know, um we're looking at uh the fellowship of the mystery. And here, brother Brandham, you know, uh in 1963 when the seals were open, you know, he came to the seventh seal. And when he opened the seventh seal, there was basically silence. And um there was not a lot that he would bring out when he actually ministered on the seventh seal. But what we've come to realize in this day is that this uh message that he preached, Christ is the mystery of God revealed, was actually the seventh seal being preached. Amen. And so, you know what ended up happening is when that seal was opened to brother Brandham, he said the Bible became a brand new book. Yes. &gt;&gt; And that's why he could say now for a text I want to take this and he says basing it on the entire Bible. &gt;&gt; So the entire Bible is based on Christ &gt;&gt; being revealed. &gt;&gt; It's about God's plan of revelation. &gt;&gt; And then God here, you know, in the book of Genesis, it's it's all in seed form. Everything, you know, shown in seed form. And then by the time we get to the book of Revelation, it's God revealing because that's why it's called the book of Revelation. And it's the revelation of Jesus Christ. It even says it right in the beginning of the book. Amen. God unveils this great plan that started not back in the Garden of Eden. No, no. It started before the foundations of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read our next scripture. We read this last week in Ephesians 3:es 8-11 because Paul here, you know, we want to we want to uh catch the mind of Paul. We want to catch the thought of what the Holy Spirit was unveiling to Paul because Paul could only see so much in his day. And Paul did not fully comprehend this mystery of God. He didn't realize that it was going to go through another seven church ages. He was the first church age messenger. But yet there was another six church ages that were to transpire and another 2,000 years of church history was going to be made. Amen. And he had no idea that this was all going to, you know, uh culminate in in a a prophet coming in the 20th century by the name of William Branham because he didn't he didn't know about the reformation. He didn't know that there was going to be a reformation. He didn't understand that that that Luther was going to, you know, that that that the word was actually that this whole mystery of God, it was actually going to be, you know, uh, blackened out by the church. Amen. That they would try to blacken out because any time that the Holy Spirit would try to do anything, what would happen? organized religion would come in and take a hold the you know the the the nicicolein spirit which is to take over the church. Amen. And to control the word and we know that that that took place and and darkened everything and buried every son and daughter of God that would come and recognize the word for their day. Every bride member throughout the dark ages. Satan would just squash them. squashed them, squashed them, trying to put out, didn't realize that this whole process was still to take place, not realizing that God was going to send a prophet in the 20th century that would restore the word back to the faith of the original fathers, back to the original faith, to put back that that that uh divine revelation back into the hearts of the children of God. Amen. That they would that there would be a people in the last days that would catch this revelation and understand it and come out from under any kind of organized religion and allow the Holy Spirit to have absolute preeminence and control in their lives. And so here Paul only had a a a part of the understanding of what this fellowship but he did he did have an understanding because God gave him the revelation of himself. The Lord revealed himself to Paul. Amen. And that's what happened through in every bride member of the church. All through the dark ages, all through those seven church ages, Christ would reveal himself personally to each one. Amen. Praise God. And so here now Paul's speaking. He says, "Unto me who am less than the least of all the saints is this given." Here he is. He's speaking it again just like he's spoken in Colossians. That I should preach among the Gentiles the uncarchable riches of Christ. Amen. and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden God. Amen. who created all things by Jesus Christ, to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church, the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen. So everything that's why brother Brandham preached that message and and titled it Christ is the mystery of God revealed and Christ has been condescending all the way from the thoughts that he had in his mind. He started to condescend and he's been condescending down through all of the ages. But yet there was this mystery that was locked up because there was one thing that he would never allow Satan to do and that was to impersonate the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it's the only thing that will actually call you and give you a revelation of this hour, &gt;&gt; a revelation of what God is doing now. &gt;&gt; Without you seeing the word, you will just be another church member. That was the element that he locked up and made it so that there was no way that my children would be deceived. &gt;&gt; He was going to Listen, there's no way that sons and daughters of God can ever be deceived. &gt;&gt; You think you were looking for God? &gt;&gt; You were not looking for God. It was God in the Garden of Eden when when when Adam and Eve fell into sin. &gt;&gt; And guess what? You're born in sin. &gt;&gt; So don't think for one minute, oh, I looking for God. I was always looking for God. I knew that I was a son of God. No, you didn't. &gt;&gt; You didn't know nothing. You were born in sin, shaped in iniquity. You were speaking lies. And like Adam and Eve, the moment sin covered you, you were hiding from God. God was an inconvenience to you. Going to church was an inconvenience because you you you you'd feel condemned so you'd stay away from church. &gt;&gt; But God knew your life. God knew that your life was going to go through what it went through. God knew that he had to come to you at a certain time. That he couldn't come to you when you were younger. You know that, you know, like not to say God can't come to young children. Sure he can. Amen. But God knows every single one of us personally. &gt;&gt; Every attribute that went forth from God. You you are in his mind. You are him. You are his expression. So he knows you. &gt;&gt; He knows you better than you know yourself. This thing here that you got locked into and and fell into spiritual amnesia doesn't know God. &gt;&gt; It rebelss against God. It's the thing that fights you every time you got to come to church. You're excited, but this thing you get up and oh yeah, I got to feel a headache. You know, oh, I want Is it raining out? I wonder whether I should go to church. You're one of these weather believers, you know. I wonder whether I should go to church because, you know, it's bad out there. You know, I can trust God. I I can trust God for this, but I can't trust God to bring me safely to church. Oh, glory to God. Aren't you glad God found you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You You weren't even searching for God. &gt;&gt; You It wasn't until God opened your understanding, &gt;&gt; okay, that you now actually started to search for him. &gt;&gt; But your understanding had to be opened first. I was thinking about this and I was wondering when was it that that that that moment that God, you know, actually called me. I was actually, you know, going back in my mind and wondering about that because every one of us should be able to remember that moment when when the light came on, &gt;&gt; when something took place, you didn't quite understand it. But what happens is that when when when the Lord comes to you and it could be in such a simple way. Amen. All of a sudden your desire and this is how you know that God has come. Pay attention. Your desire now is for the word. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden you're reading things. You're reading scripture that you just couldn't. You you try to read one paragraph and you were snoring. You never you never even took the time to open the Bible &gt;&gt; while you were in school and you were going to Catholic school. You go to church on on that once or twice a year and you would you would you would go for a for a snooze. But then all of a sudden God opens your understanding. Something clicks on the inside. You didn't realize but that was God now awakening that attribute. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because if you're a son or a daughter of God, you always were. &gt;&gt; You just came into this dimension into a human body born of your parents. But then you're in this amnesia, not knowing that you're actually an attribute of God. But when God decides to awaken that attribute, your desire changes for the word. All of a sudden, I remember I went to see Gabriel to go get some furniture. We're talking. He gives me an amazing deal on furniture. I said, I said, man, I said, this is a great deal, you know, uh, are you satisfied? I'm, you know, he goes, he looks at me, he goes, you a Christian? I said, I was brought up Roman Catholic. I said, if that's Christianity, I'm a hypocrite. He goes, yeah, that's good. He gives me a tape and it was the Hebrews 1957 and I'm listening to that tape. Now the here's where I want to make a point here because we are not against tapes or listening to tapes. &gt;&gt; Let me make that clear, &gt;&gt; okay? Because I listen to them every day. I just wrote I just read you a quote from brother Brandham, okay? But I got a revelation and an understanding &gt;&gt; that that God gives revelation, not man. &gt;&gt; Okay? Faith cometh by hearing. By hearing what? The man. The word. &gt;&gt; The word. &gt;&gt; And here I was listening to that tape. I didn't understand it. But by the time I got home, I wanted more. I called Gabriel. I left. The Lord had it for me to leave my $250 sunglasses at a doughnut shop down the street from his place. I said, "I gotta go back for those glass." God knows, you know, you're going back for those glasses at the same time you're going to pick up some more. He gives me a whole box of tapes. For the next three months, I'm listening to those tapes and and I'm and I'm I'm talking about the word. I had no idea who this man was. I didn't know he was a prophet. I had no idea. I didn't even know that he was a prophet and fully have a revelation on who he was for probably seven, eight months after I was baptized. Amen. But my my experience was with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And your experience has to be with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how you know that something has changed your desire now because what it is, it's the Holy Ghost coming into your life to awaken you &gt;&gt; to him &gt;&gt; to the word. Amen. Praise God. And so I realized that that was the point where God had triggered that attribute. It was in that experience of that day being at brother Gabriel's and I know brother Tim Beers was there, brother Vishnu was there and they were having some fellowship there and they noticed when you know when myself and my family came in and they noticed certain things that you know that that were kind of awkward or you know and and so so the here was a time and a season. I'm just using that as an example. You can go back into your own experience, but you need to find, you know, you need to go back and and see where it was that that that you all all of a sudden your desire became for the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that's that's what's required for a son or a daughter to come into their position as manifested sons of God. This is the mystery. This is the fellowship of the mystery. This is what Paul was trying to convey to the people in his day. And here I am and I'm I'm I'm moving under this fellowship of this mystery of God, knowing and understanding much better now what it's all about. Amen. And so this entire series has been on the purpose of God. Amen. And how God, the self-existent one, had a plan. and and and that's all part of the of the fellowship of that mystery. Amen. And we looked at how, you know, and throughout this whole series, we've been looking at how the Holy Ghost, the evidence of the Holy Ghost was not you speaking in tongues or shouting or or or uh you know um uh sensation. The evidence of the Holy Ghost was your ability to recognize the word for your day. &gt;&gt; And it would it would change your your your whole purpose. That's the true birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go back and you you'll see that that when when that genuine experience took place, your purpose changed. Your your whole life changed and people around you noticed. &gt;&gt; They said, "This person is either crazy or they've met God." &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's that's, you know, that's what what really the the purpose of God takes over your whole life. And now you're you're walking this new walk with God. Amen. And so that was the the true evidence of the of the Holy Ghost. And then we were looking at adoption and how we are predestinated unto adoption. Amen. We're not predestinated unto a heavenly dimension. That's not what No. No. We're predestinated unto the adoption of sons. Amen. And when when we when we become uh fully manifest sons, it's because we've we've actually made contact with our theophony bodies and and that that uh change which is being produced right now through the preaching of the word and which we call the rapture. This is the rapture dispensation. This is the element that that that has awakened us. Amen. It's the word that's right now quickening us into that other dimension. Amen. Praise God. And so we realize that that when God sent Malachi 4 and Revelations 10 through the Reformation, Amen. Luther Wesley, William Brham, the seventh church age messenger, the 20th century messenger. Amen. prophet to this age. We realized there was another dispensational change that took place. And you must recognize that dispensation is what we're in now. Amen. We're no longer under the seven church ages. We are under the eternal church age, which is the bride age, which is where Christ himself now is calling sons of God into adoption. adoption unto sons of God. Amen. Let's read our next quote here. So he says here the mystery of his will and remember how we hung on that. How many was here this morning? Let's see how we stuck on that. The mystery of his will. Amen. Now it is not just a little thing. Then it's a mystery. God's will is a mystery. And each man has to seek out the will of God for his or herself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I took that quote because that jumped out on me. God's mystery, but God's mystery is not some universal understanding. God's mystery is something that includes you as a part of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's not just knowing &gt;&gt; the mystery, &gt;&gt; but it's understanding that you are a part of &gt;&gt; the mystery. &gt;&gt; And this is what puts you into the fellowship &gt;&gt; of the mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not talking about the mystery of fellowship &gt;&gt; where people come together and oh brother, let's have some fellowship and before you know it, it turns into battleship. No, I'm talking about the fellowship of the mystery &gt;&gt; because you've entered into that element where you recognize that you are a son or a daughter of God. You are a part of God's program. You've you've recognized that you were one of those attributes that was in the mind of God before the foundations of the world that was expressed into this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because remember what he said there in Colossians how that by that in that in that through the generations it was it was a mystery. It was not revealed through all those generations but it was to be revealed in these last days. Let's go to the next uh quote here. He says how that he would send Jesus. Amen. And this is where we you know where a lot of people they don't understand. All they do is they place Jesus on the cross. And that's all they put him there and they say he died for my sins. But they have no revelation on the fact that he came that the word that was from the beginning in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh. &gt;&gt; Okay. His purpose in becoming flesh &gt;&gt; was so that man could be God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so that God could be man &gt;&gt; and that when he died on the cross because you were in him in the before the foundation of the world, you were in him when he went to Calvary. &gt;&gt; When he rose from the dead, you rise from the dead. &gt;&gt; Every attribute that was in God from the beginning, remember God in the beginning, he created angels. And the purpose of the angels was so that he could be called God. Yes, &gt;&gt; he wasn't even God before he created the angels because something had to worship him &gt;&gt; cuz God is an object of worship. &gt;&gt; But when he expressed sons, that's what made him father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And that's why you can say, I HAVE A FATHER. &gt;&gt; I am a SON OF GOD. I'M NOT AN ANGEL. I'm not some some being that's going to have a beginning and have an end. No, you have no beginning. You have no end &gt;&gt; because you're a son. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And he says here, he says how that he would send Jesus that through this sacrifice, we would all have a right to the tree of life. And who is the tree of life? &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the tree that was in the Garden of Eden that Adam and Eve could feed on every night in the in the cool of the evening. They could just feast around that tree, which was not a literal tree. It was Christ. &gt;&gt; He was the tree of life. He says, "But of that tree, you shall not eat, for it is the tree of good and evil. &gt;&gt; It knows both. &gt;&gt; The day you eat thereof, you will die." And that's what brought about the reason we're here today. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God had a plan. &gt;&gt; God had a plan. Amen. And this is what we're feasting on. Amen. This is what's bringing us back home. &gt;&gt; This word is what's restoring us back to our original placing in the word of God. Amen. Glory to God. So he says those who he forneew, he called. Those who he called, he has already justified. Those who he had justified, he's already glorified. God since the beginning of the world predestinated us to the adoption of sons. Amen. Now the whole creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God. Oh, I imagine Paul had a wonderful time. I'd have liked to have been there with him. Wouldn't you? Amen. You see, he he was he was caught up into this revelation and understanding that he was a son of God and that he would manifest a in the fullness at some point. But he knew that it hadn't come yet. He realized that this was something because he said the earth and the creation, the whole creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God. Because when they ate from that tree of knowledge of good and evil, everything fell. &gt;&gt; All creation fell. the animals, the trees, everything had a now now everything had death. Now everything had a a death which is which is a separation from God because he's life. And so that's why Paul had an understanding that that there would be a time when the sons of God would come into manifestation in their fullness &gt;&gt; and it would restore everything back. And that's why the whole earth, that's why all of creation, that's why the the earth, that's why the the earth is belching with with with weather patterns and and and birth pains and and uh we're having all kinds of hurricanes and and and the world is just, you know, earthquakes and this and that. What is it? It's groaning. It's wanting the sons of God to manifest so that because they know that they carry the word of life that WHATEVER THEY SAY HAS to obey. Amen. That's why when when God placed Adam in the Garden of Eden, he says he says whatever you says I give you full dominion over the entire earth. If he had have spoken to the tree move to there, it would move. He had full dominion as a son. He was God on earth. Amen. Praise God. Amen. Let's look at the next slide. These are quotes from adoption uh the fourth um the fourth uh message that he preached on it 1960. He says, "Now he said he made known to us the mystery." And listen what he says here. He says, "Get the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit on you sometime and start running that through. Just watch how it goes." This afternoon I had about 30 minutes to study. Just, you know, looked the lesson over, maybe not. Uh, I'll say half of that, maybe 15 minutes between the times I got to running. And I thought, the mystery, how mysterious. And the scripture packed me back into the Old Testament, then back over into the New Testament, tied something together. See, the mystery of his coming. You see, this is what brother Brandham was breaking into when he was into this adoption series. He was, remember, he was he was the first fruit of the manifestation of a son of God going through the adoption process that would come into full manifestation. He didn't even realize that that Revelations 10:1-7 was coming, but he knew that that the that that the word would manifest the sons of God eventually. But he didn't have a full understanding of how it was going to happen. It wasn't until 1962, late '62, where God started to give him those visions. Sir, is this the time? Wh what was it? He didn't have any idea. And then even when he went to preach those seals, he said, "I'd have been completely wrong if the Holy Spirit, if the Holy Ghost, if the angel hadn't come into that room on on the opening of each of those seals and give me a revelation and broke the vision of exactly what was actually under those seals." Amen. He'd have made a mess of it. Goes to show you the progression of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so here he says you know uh he says the mystery how mysterious in the scripture packed me back from the old to the new tied something together. See the mystery of his coming the mystery of his will the mystery of us sitting together. Remember it cannot be taught in any seminary. &gt;&gt; So don't be looking, oh I'm going to go do a study on God and how I am a son of God. No, forget it. You're not going to get it in any seminary. Period. It's a mystery. &gt;&gt; You cannot know it by education or by theology. It's it's the it's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation of the world. Now, pay attention. Waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Why does it why why does it need to wait for the manifestation of the sons of God, brother Chris? Why? What is it that's being unveiled in the revelation of this hour that requires sons of God to come into their full maturity, to come into their adoption, to come into an understanding that that church is not just about joining a church, going there on Sunday, going there on the Wednesday services, you know, going up to the front, taking the Lord's supper, all these the all these things. That's not what church is. God didn't even God didn't even institute church. It was man that instituted church. &gt;&gt; When the first church went out in the book of Acts, they went everywhere. &gt;&gt; They went into the highways and the byways and they and they just preached the word of God under the inspiration. Paul says, "I don't come to you with enticing words, &gt;&gt; catechisms, and all of this. I come to you in the power of his resurrection." In other words, God was in him. &gt;&gt; He recognized the Holy Ghost was in him and he was bringing forth the word for their day. &gt;&gt; He was he was manifesting sunship. Didn't understand it. Didn't realize it. But this is how God has always been doing it. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't change. Amen. Praise God. And so, we're looking at this whole fellowship of the mystery and and trying to understand it in a in a greater way. And you know, that's why I've been in this study. I've just been rejoicing around it. I don't know. Like I I can't convey to you all the thoughts that pour into my mind. I forget half of them. I'll be honest with you. You know, like I wake up in the morning sometimes and that's my best. That's when my mind is clear and I'm sitting there and I'm going thoughts are pouring through my mind on this word and I'm seeing things like, "Oh God, hallelujah. Praise God. But I'm lazy. I don't want to get up and go and write all these notes down right now. I'm still half asleep. But I'm but I'm but I'm rejoicing because this this revelation is not something that you can you can study. It's revealed. &gt;&gt; It's revealed to you. &gt;&gt; That's why your position, your calling, your placing in the body. Oh, I'm going to join the church and because I'm good at this, I'm going to do that for the church. No, God is going to place you in the body &gt;&gt; according to his purpose and his plan. what he saw in you before the foundations of the world. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what's in you, how you're built, how you're designed, and how he can best use you to edify and build the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I, you know, just started reading through certain scriptures on the on the sons of God. And, you know, let's go to the next scripture here from Romans chapter 8. you know, there's some some things in in the scripture here that just, you know, struck my heart. So, he goes on, he says here in Romans 8:es 8-11, he says, "Now, pay attention." Like, let's draw from the word because faith comes from the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. I got no I I don't have anything for you. &gt;&gt; I just have a yielded vessel, &gt;&gt; but I'm trusting that the Holy Spirit will will will, you know, as you're pulling on the word of God, God's going to meet your need. God's going to speak to you. God's going to make this word live. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the letter kills, but the spirit brings it to life. Amen. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. Now keep in mind, we're talking about the fellowship of the mystery, which is bringing into adoption sons of God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Okay. You coming into your rightful position as a son of God. And when I say sons, I mean daughters, too. Okay? But he says here, "But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit." Okay? If so be that the spirit of God dwell in you. So you got to, you know, do you know, have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? &gt;&gt; That's the question that's coming out of there. &gt;&gt; Paul's not saying that, but but Paul in Acts chapter uh 19, he asked a bunch of disciples. He says, "I see you're praising God. I see you get together. I see you guys having a great time. He says, "But have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?" You could ask that question to 99% of the churches out there. They won't know how to answer that question. But if you've received it, you know, &gt;&gt; you know that you know. Amen. The word is alive. The word is real. When you read a scripture like this, it it just speaks to you in volumes. If so be that the spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his. &gt;&gt; He's just making it straight. &gt;&gt; He's just making it plain. So you young people, if you're still questioning, if you're still wondering, oh, am I his am I am I a am I am I a part of the bride or anybody, young, old, doesn't matter. You could be in this message for 30 years. Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? &gt;&gt; Amen. You got he says he says here he says uh not if any man h have now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his. So you got to check yourself you need to make sure your calling your election and he says and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So in other words don't put any merit on your ability to do anything in this body. Oh I go to church every day. You got Catholics, they go to church every morning and every night. &gt;&gt; THE BODY'S DEAD. &gt;&gt; GOD is not LOOKING AT YOUR FLESH. GOD'S NOT LOOKING AT YOUR WORKS. God's not looking at your at your ability to to do what what you think you're doing for God. No, sir. You must be in Christ. &gt;&gt; You must have pleaded the blood of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; You must recognize that when he died at Calvary, you died with him. &gt;&gt; And when he rose, you rose with him. But you're stuck in this body. But you know who you are. You recognize. Now look, he goes on. And if Christ being you, the body's dead in sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. Who's righteousness? He just said your body's dead, but because of the spirit in you righteousness. Whose righteousness? His righteousness. You can't have any righteousness that's going to please God. It's only if he dwells in you. So watch, he goes on. He says now, "But if the spirit of him, here it is, that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you." He's making it so clear here that it's by the Holy Ghost. It's by the spirit of God in you that you have any hope of being resurrected. He's made it clear here. Your body is dead because of sin. That's why Jesus had to come as a man. He had to be born in a the womb of a woman. Not the way that man is born where there was a man and a woman coming together. No, she had to be virgin. He He was virgin born. He was born of a virgin. Amen. By the spoken word. Remember, it's all about the word. &gt;&gt; You must you must receive the spoken word. You must like Mary say, "Be it unto me to the angel according to thy word." &gt;&gt; That's what gives you this relationship with Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what awakens you to the understanding that you are a son or a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; It's the word birth, not the natural birth. So, he goes on here. He says, "Now watch next scripture." We're going to continue here in Romans. He goes, "For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God." &gt;&gt; We're talking about sunship. Amen. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the spirit of adoption. This is where God is actually uh bringing you through a process. of understanding who you really are. &gt;&gt; The adoption process, not and and why is he doing that? Because in the Old Testament, when there was an adoption of a son, it was because the father was passing down all of his rights, &gt;&gt; all of his all of his leadership, &gt;&gt; all of his wealth, &gt;&gt; all of his authority, &gt;&gt; all that was in God, he poured into Christ. And all that was in Christ, he poured into the church, which is the body of Christ. Amen. He's passing this authority of adoption. So, it's the spirit of adoption. And look, whereby we cry father. &gt;&gt; See, you can't call God father unless you're a son. &gt;&gt; You you you understand now. You're not just a churchgoer. You're not just a you're not just a a Roman Catholic or you're or a Baptist or a Presbyterian or or a Methodist or a Pentecostal. No. When you come into this revelation of the spirit of God in you, you turn around and say, "I'm not the son of Dominic and Ida Mazili. &gt;&gt; This is but I'M A SON OF GOD." &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM caught that revelation. I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Brandham. I am the son, a son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now I can now knowing who I am, I can move into my position. I can understand my authority. I can recognize what God it what it is that God wants to impart unto me. Amen. Praise God. The spirit itself beare witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. Amen. And if children, here it is, then hes of God and joint hes with Christ. Amen. You see how it's all about the mystery of God. It's all about Christ becoming man and man becoming God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this whole process that that God is bringing us through. And if children, heirs, heirs of God, and then if so be that we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified together. Amen. You got to bear the reproach for the word of God. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's not an easy walk. You're not going to just walk this walk and just come to church every Sunday and oh everything is fine and I can do this and I can do that and putting, you know, putting church secondary. No, no, no, no, no. If God has filled you with himself by the Holy Ghost, you can't wait to read the word. You can't wait to get into the house of the Lord to hear the word. You can't wait to hear the supernatural. You because listen, God discerns hearts. &gt;&gt; God knows what you have need of. &gt;&gt; God knows exactly where you're at. He knows what you need to hear in order to bring you out of that amnesia that you're in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Let's read on here. He says here, "For I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us." &gt;&gt; Now, and and look what he go and look how he ends this in verse 19. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. There it is again. Glory to God. Listen, when the word opens up to you, like when I started to, you know, look into this and and, you know, I was triggered by listening to certain messages and I'm going to share a little testimony here in a bit. But but understanding how this this word you know all of a sudden that's why brother Brandham when the seals were ripped open for him and when God opened his understanding to the to the mighty angel himself that had come down this that's why the book became a new book that's why when you read these scriptures you just it just blows your mind look read on here Romans 8:22-23 for we know that the whole creation He goes and reiterates it again. Groanth and travaleth in pain together until now. Imagine the whole world has been in this great travail all the way going right back to Genesis when right back to the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve fell. Right from that very moment that death set in the earth started to groan. It was it was dying at that point. Why? because it was separated from God. The the the the the inheritance that God had placed in Adam that was to bring forth every son and every daughter of God, he lost it at that moment when when when Eve was deceived and allowed the enemy to come in and inject himself into her which brought forth Cain and Abel. That's why the original sin was not an apple. Had nothing to do with an apple. If apples opens the eyes of the women, then let's hand out some apples because they're walking naked and they don't know it. They dress themselves in ways they present themselves in ways that was the original thing that that you know that that when when the eyes were opened. Amen. And she wanted to create. She wanted to be a a procreator because that's that's what Satan wanted. He wanted to bring forth of his own kind. He wanted to pervert. He wanted to change the program of God. Amen. But that's what caused the entire fall of every son and daughter of God. Adam lost that book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's been restored. He says, "For for we know the whole creation groanth and travaleth in the pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also." Amen. That's why we we we struggle in this world which have the first fruits of the spirit. Even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body. We're groaning within ourselves because there's something about another body that we go to. If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have another one that's waiting &gt;&gt; and we're groaning for that &gt;&gt; because that will bring into full maturity the sons and daughters of the living God here on earth. Amen. Praise God. How many knows that we're going into a millennium? &gt;&gt; Amen. God's going to have bodies for us. Glory to God. We are we are we are we are waiting for that adoption to wit to to to bring forth so that we can go to our bodies, the redemptive bodies that are waiting for us, our theophony bodies that are waiting for us, the ones that brother Brandham saw when he went beyond the curtain of time. Amen. And he saw each and every one of our bodies there. Amen. Waiting. Glory to God. Praise God. But there's a process to get us there. &gt;&gt; And that process is the process that we're in right now. &gt;&gt; That's why church is not about just coming together and reading scripture. Church is about God speaking the word line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, there a little, quickening your mortal bodies by the same spirit that dwelt in Christ, raising you into heavenly places so that you can recognize who you really are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Let's read our next our next scripture in first Peter verse 1 3-5. Listen here. He says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again. You were born into this world. You're born into flesh. But now he's you there's a there's a new birth unto a lively hope." And the word lively, if you look up lively, it means eternal life. It means life. The eternal life, the eternal hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance. Now, we we want to know about our inheritance. I want you to know that your inheritance is not something of this world &gt;&gt; because it's it it makes it very clear here. He says it's incorruptible. It's an inheritance that's incorruptible. So, it's not something that's going to that that's going to last, that's going to be No, it's it's fading away. Okay? Anything that's corruptible is going to fade. So don't be looking for, oh, God's going to give me billions of dollars here on earth. God can do whatever he wants. If he needs money to move through the ministry to fulfill his purpose, he will use those that have a revelation on Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; Until you you could be a son or a daughter of God, do you know that? And not have a revelation on Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; You haven't come into it yet. There's a lot of people that are still groaning. They groan every time they got to go like this. You see, there's groaning going on, but you're you're you're groaning into the sons and daughters of God. Amen. And there's a there's a fullness of the word that God's made available in this day and in this hour. You will catch a clear revelation of everything that God wants you to have in order to fulfill his purpose because to each is given a portion of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. In order to fulfill their part within the body. But he goes on here. He says to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled. So it's not something that anybody could alter with. Has to be God. Amen. and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you. Jesus says, "I go to prepare a place for you, &gt;&gt; that where I am, you may be also." What? God doesn't need to prepare houses for us. &gt;&gt; He's not talking about mansions. &gt;&gt; He's talking about the fact that when he rose, our theophies were in him because our theophies are the attributes of God. They are the they are the the the the bodies that he connects with the attribute in order for you to manifest as a man god on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. So here he goes on. He says now reserved in heaven for you who. So who means that that's a person. Who? Not a not what that thing. No, no. Who meaning that it's an actual being, it's an actual expression of God himself who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in these last days. &gt;&gt; That's why there's a word for us today. &gt;&gt; And this is what we feast on. &gt;&gt; This is what I'm interested in. This is what excites me. Amen. Praise God. That inheritance that's incorruptible. Amen. Praise God. Because God is God is wanting you to be a son that can speak on his behalf. And this is the only age where the full adoption brings you to a place where you become the voice of God &gt;&gt; to the last generation. Amen. Praise God. Mature believers. Amen. Who who have a desire to fulfill the word of God. Not, oh, I don't know about going to church next week. I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it. I don't know about my schedule. I don't know about this. It's always No, no. Everything should be you working it out around your church, around your time with God. This is the hour where the sons of God. They they they they are moving into full manifestation. Amen. Everything else has got to fade away eventually. Everything else is going to fade away. This world is not our home. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know I'm I'm preaching this. It's another thing to live it. But we need to understand who we truly are. &gt;&gt; When you understand your authority, your position, it changes when you pray. &gt;&gt; It gives you a confidence that you can walk up and lay hands on the sick and know that you're not going to heal them, but God can heal them. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation of That's why Brother Bram says when she gets to a place where she knows who she is, she'll be an invincible army. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; For you to come into that into that position as a manifested son. Amen. That inheritance. Praise God. That's undefiled and fadeth not away. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. It's our man. It's our time to manifest the word for our day. And it is going to bring to pass the fullness of the body change. Amen. It's going to take us out of this dimension. Glory to God. Let's read on here. Next quote. Listen here. He says, "Now, what do you think?" He's talking about this scripture here. the writer of this book that seen it and seeing where it would be manifested in the last days, waiting for and groaning for those sons of God to rise in the last days with the power of the Holy Ghost at the end of the age to reveal the secret things from the foundation of the world to bring it up. Now, let's go back into the foundation of the world again to get a revelation to see if we're right or not. Here, brother Brandham. Now, he's he, you know, he he's he he he he realizes that that, you know, um from the reading of these scriptures that we've read here, he realizes that there was things that were to be revealed through the manifestation of these sons of God that would come into their position, that would recognize who they were. Amen. And so he says, he says, "Now these things, let's go back to the foundation of the world." So now what scripture comes to your mind? Job. &gt;&gt; Where were you? &gt;&gt; So let's read the scripture. &gt;&gt; He says here, "Where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?" Now he's talking to Job. Job is going through this whole experience, okay? this whole experience of losing everything, of being completely annihilated, his family being destroyed, his pets, his cows, his his all his herds, everything. God just allowed the enemy to just wipe out everything. Amen. Glory to God. This is all uh you know, this was all in the in the in the plan of God. This whole book of Job, you can't even really place where this book of Job really fits in. And I believe it was it was a scenario that God played out and and and inspired uh the writer uh of this book to to write it so that we could understand how God deals with sons and daughters. Amen. But he says here and he goes and he goes he says, "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare if thou has understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy? &gt;&gt; He's talking to Job here in the midst of his, you know, this great trial. Amen. But he was showing Job something. He was giving Job a revelation of who he actually was and who Job was. That's why Job caught the revelation and knew that I will see my redeemer. These these he he he knew that he would actually come into the manifestation of sunship because God revealed something to him. But here I want to share something here. I was listening to a service by brother Aleister Francis. Okay. Who was a pastor in South Africa and he's the brother that ministered at our youth camp here in July at uh brother Danquis many of you may remember and I was able to meet him and connect with him. And so I was listening to to a service that he was preaching and as he was preaching and in the beginning of this service he started to share an experience that he had and he said um I was many years ago and he was laying he he was bringing the thought because of you just read this scripture. Okay. And he says, "Many years ago, Brother Isaiah Brooks came to visit us here in South Africa and he brought with him another minister by the name of John Simon." And so I was directed to be their chauffeur to take them to the meetings. And we were taking them and I and this is brother Alistister saying and I was I was under the understanding that brother Isaiah Brooks was going to be ministering this service. And so when we got there, brother Isaiah Brooks said, "Oh no, brother." He says, "Would you please let John Simon, brother John Simon, preach this service." And brother Alistister didn't know Brother John. He didn't know who he was. He got a little bit nervous. He says, you know, like because you know, like you don't know what, but he says, "But I but I knew brother Isaiah." So he allowed Brother John to take the service. And so here now he was explaining and he went on to say that that um brother Simon took this very scripture from Job chapter 38 and he made and he read the scripture and then he made a very profound statement that brother Alistister said never left him. It set his mind racing because brother Simon went up there read the scripture and he made this statement. And he said, "If the sons of God shouted back there before the foundations of the world, then would they not also shout when they manifest in the last days?" Amen. &gt;&gt; And he and brother Alistister said it just set his mind into a into a uproar of thoughts where where he couldn't he couldn't he just the whole day he was just you know mesmerized by these thoughts that had that had gone through his mind and and it just blew his his thoughts and and he says and it and it has never left him. has left and it has affected him up until this day where he brought this testimony about this actual uh uh experience that he had with brother Simon ministering the word. &gt;&gt; And so this thought that that you know that he was bringing forth I'm listening to all of this you know and he says and I just you know and I never mentioned that it was John Simon at the you know through the times that I've ministered but he says I want to give flowers now. I want to give credit. In other words, do where it was because God was anointing our pastor. And we know that we were under an anointed ministry. We know that it was a a spearheading ministry. We know that God was revealing not the man, but he was surrendered to the spirit of God. He he came into the revelation of who he was. That he was a voice in the last days. He was a son of God that was anointed under the five-fold ministry. And when you yield yourself in that way and you come under that kind of surrender, humility, God can use you and speak through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, while I'm listening to all this, you got to understand this all happened over the last, you know, maybe this happened about four four weeks ago. Four Yeah, about four four weeks ago. Four, five weeks ago &gt;&gt; when this all just unfolded pe before me. And then I'm starting to look at everything and I'm and I'm and the Holy Spirit is just showing he says and you look at the individuals that were involved. Brother Isaiah Brooks, Brother John Simon, and here I am in this series inspired by a lot of the preaching that's been that's that that actually brother Alistister is is a teacher in the five-fold ministry like no other teacher that I've ever heard. I'm just gonna give flowers where they deserve. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I recognize that it's the five-fold ministry. I recognize that it's the mighty angel himself. I recognize that God is revealing things in this hour to the sons and daughters of God through the five-fold ministry and that there are individuals that are placed. I cannot teach like he teaches. Amen. I cannot preach like brother Simon preaches. I can but I'm I'm who I am. &gt;&gt; Okay? And that's and that's that's what I I just want to express who I am. And every son or daughter of God can only be what God has made you to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's your ability to humble yourself and allow the Holy Spirit to use you. So all of this is going through my mind. And I look at the timing of everything. I'm listening to this. He's talking about brother Isaiah. Brother Isaiah had had uh um called me to ask me to come and minister in Iowa. And here this is all happening all at the same time. Now, while brother Alistister was preaching, and this is what really struck me, he was talking about how God's attributes were in his mind when he was the self-existent one, and he had these clusters of attributes that would go forth in different ages and dispensations. &gt;&gt; And he made this statement. He said, "Those clusters of attributes will find themselves. They will unite &gt;&gt; in the dispensation under the leadership of the Holy Spirit under the revealed word for their day and for their hour. It would bring them into their position as adopted sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; You I said there's no way. Hey, and I I had, you know, I reached out to brother Alistister and I, you know, I was telling him, brother, like this is just remarkable the way this is all unfolding. And he says, "Yes, brother. It's the family of God. It's the clusters. They You couldn't miss. That's why I had to come to this church. &gt;&gt; You had to come to this church. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're one of those clusters that went out from God that has to unite with the word because the uniting of the word IS BRINGING JESUS CHRIST BACK TO earth again &gt;&gt; in bride form in the bride's ministry. AND IF YOU'RE A SON or a daughter OF GOD, YOU'VE GOT TO FIND YOUR RIGHTFUL POSITION IN THE BODY OF CHRIST. AND PEOPLE JUST WANT TO SAY, "OH, I just going to listen to the tapes." Good for you. You need to be under a ministry. You need to find where God has placed you. You need to know that you've got a pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God didn't set up the five-fold ministry just for fun. &gt;&gt; Exactly, brother. &gt;&gt; For the perfecting, for the equipping. Amen. I can even you can even go back and I can show you where quotes in the Bible where brother Brandham said that the pastor of a local church has supreme authority over that church even more than if he come into the church &gt;&gt; and he was the prophet of the age &gt;&gt; because he understood the offices of the pastor. He understood the offices of an evangelist of a of a of a a teacher. All of those God's those are God's gifts that he has that he has given to the church for the equipping and the perfecting of the body &gt;&gt; till they all come in. Read the Ephesians 4. Till they all come into the unity of the faith, the revelation of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. The body of Christ. Glory to God. And so this whole experience that I had and and seeing how God was working all of this out and hearing, you know, and I shared it with brother Simon and he was just hallelujah. Praise God. This is the attribute sons of God coming into the unity understanding what the word is is producing in this day and in this hour. Glory to God. Listen, I hope I haven't lost you. You guys still with me? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. This is that third pull. Hallelujah. Listen, I'm not going to get into all that element right now, but this is that third pull. It's the unveiling of that seal. Amen. It's the opening of the word to the sons and daughters of God. And they're all personally coming into their positions and understanding where they fit in the mystery. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. We're winding this down. Let's go to the next uh quote here. He says here in the hand of the Lord came upon me. The hand of the Lord 1954 he says why I said about God spoke to Job one day and he said Job where was you when I laid the foundations of the world tell me what what they're they're fastened unto said what when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy a hundred million years before the world was ever formed they had shouting religion. Oh my goodness. Glory to God. I'm not going to get into this today. This is going to be for next week. Amen. But here he's talking about then talk about something new. Why? It's the oldest there is. You see, God ain't going to use anything different. You see, sons of God shouted. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THEY SHOUTED. WHY WERE THEY SHOUTING? BECAUSE THEY HAD SOMETHING TO SHOUT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GLORY TO GOD. AND I BELIEVE THEY'RE SONS OF GOD IN THIS HOUR. THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING THEY need to shout. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Glory to God. He says, "Then talk about something new. Why? It's the oldest there is and the only kind that there really is." Yeah. It's the oldfashioned heartfelt sky blue sinkilling religion, brother. It don't whitewash you. IT WASHES YOU WHITE from the inside out. Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. would make you do things you didn't think you ever could. &gt;&gt; You're going to see and recognize and do things that you never thought were possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Let's read the next quote here. I'm winding it down. He says, "What was he? In the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. And the word was made flesh. And he said, "You condemn me because I call myself the son of God. And it's written in your laws that ye are gods." Man was made to be a god. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. This was God's plan. &gt;&gt; His domain is the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The whole EARTH IS AWAITING NOW FOR THE MANIFESTATION of the sons of God to be made manifest. Look how far behind we are. But remember the prophets. He said if you call them gods who the word of God came to. Amen. Praise God. God is manifesting himself in sons &gt;&gt; in this hour. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Next quote. He says here, "It is I." And this sign was to return, not an ark, but God dwelling in the flesh of his people in his church. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. See, Jesus said, "Amen. At that day, you'll know that I'm in the Father, the Father in me, and I in you, and you in me. And it's God in you. All that God was, he poured into Christ. And all that Christ was, he poured into the church. And so, it's God above us, God with us, God in us. No wonder we are commissioned to baptize using Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Not three different gods, three offices of one God. See, God above us, God in the Father, God in us, with us in the Son, cleansing his way, condescending, coming down, making a way that he could get back and bring his people back to make manifested sons of God. You see, it's not until we reunite with our theophony bodies that we come into the full manifestation of the sons of God. Because then our theophony is the body that we will possess which is an eternal body &gt;&gt; so that we can dwell and rule with him here on the earth. Glory to God. He says just he says uh uh uh condescending coming down make back his people to make manifest his sons of God like they had them in the garden of Eden. The whole world is groaning and waiting for that hour for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come. I'm going to read one scripture and one final quote in John 1 John 1:es 1:2. He goes on and he says, "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God." But he says, "Therefore, the world knoweth us not because it knew him not." You see, unless you know that you've got a father, how can you be a son? &gt;&gt; You need to know the father. You need to know where you came from. You need to know the plan of God. You need to know that he wants you to know that it's it's I in you, your hope of glory. Like we read at the beginning, beloved, now are we the sons of God. And it doth not appear what we shall be, but we shall know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. Blessed be the name of the Lord God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you recognize saints? &gt;&gt; Listen here in this final quote. He says, "Tell me brother, my brother, tell me my sister, when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time?" Now when there when when was when were there ever a time in history that was to manifest the time to deliver all nature? Nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation. Why? Before the atonement was made, before the Holy Ghost was even poured out, before all the Old Testament on down there, there could have been manifestations. It had to wait till this time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He says, "Now all things has been brought, coming, shaping up to the headstone. Glory to God. to the manifestations of the sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ till it will join him and his church &gt;&gt; together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh what a time saints. What a time. Let us pray. Father, Lord, this word of life that you've unveiled to us, that you've made available in this day to the sons and daughters of God. Lord, it's just your grace, Lord, that we are able to recognize and see this glorious plan, this glorious mystery of the fellowship that you that you had with your children from before the foundations of the world. And now, Lord, you're making it plain to us. You're making it clear to us. You're making it real to us, Lord, that that we're that that we're that we're being changed. Little by little, we're being transformed. Little by little, we're being uh Lord moved into heavenly places in Christ Jesus until that final day Lord when the when the uh the saints of God, the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet you to meet with the saints to meet with our theophanes, oh God, and to be in that glorious place, Father, where we can rejoice around the throne of God like Job said, "Blessed be your wonderful name, Lord. Let these words become reality to our hearts, Lord. Bring us back service after service where we can feast upon you, oh God. We will never fail but to give you all the glory, the praise, and the honor in Jesus Christ's name." Amen. Let's sing that song. We are the sons of God. [Music] of God. Oh yes. Come on.
