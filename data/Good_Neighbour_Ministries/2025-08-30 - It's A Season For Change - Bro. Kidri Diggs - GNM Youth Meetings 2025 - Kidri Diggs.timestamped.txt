[27:45] But maybe we need something to praise
[27:47] him about, right? How about greater than
[27:50] all my sin? Try that.
[27:53] Greater than all my sin is the blood
[27:59] that still cleanses
[28:02] me. Is the grace that still set me free.
[28:08] of it to praise him.
[28:13] [Music]
[28:14] I know the blood supply.
[28:19] I'm walking in newness
[28:23] of life. I cannot fall.
[28:27] [Music]
[28:32] Greater than all my sin tonight. Oh,
[28:34] greater than all my sin is the blood
[28:40] that still cleanses
[28:43] me. Is the grace that still set me free
[28:51] to praise him.
[28:53] [Music]
[28:55] I know the blood of God. I'm walking in
[29:02] newness
[29:04] of life. I cannot fall.
[29:08] [Music]
[29:14] Last line. I cannot fall. He's greater
[29:19] than all the blood of the lamb.
[29:24] [Music]
[29:25] Anybody want to put their hands together
[29:27] for him now?
[29:29] Oh boy.
[29:31] [Applause]
[29:36] F.
[29:38] Praise God. Praise God. Turn around and
[29:40] shake somebody's hand. Say, "God bless
[29:42] you, pilgrim. So glad to see you in the
[29:45] house of the Lord." And
[29:48] wow.
[29:53] Songwriter said,
[29:55] "Oh,
[29:57] glory,
[29:58] glory, hallelujah.
[30:01] Oh, praise the Lord today. I know I'm
[30:04] free.
[30:05] [Applause]
[30:07] Oh, he is with me. And if I stay close
[30:12] to him, safe from harm and danger I will
[30:16] be.
[30:19] Well, burdens now are lighter.
[30:23] Rider is my way.
[30:26] It is such a joy to walk with.
[30:29] [Music]
[30:31] And when this journey here is over, I'll
[30:35] set my feet on heaven shore. Eternity
[30:39] all joy will just begin.

[30:59] And if I stay close to him,
[31:02] [Music]
[31:05] when my Jesus saved me, everybody. Oh,
[31:08] when my Jesus saved me, he washed my
[31:12] sins away. He cast him in the bottom of
[31:16] the sea. Come on. He picked me up,
[31:21] turned me around. He set my feet on
[31:24] heaven's ground. And now I'm walking
[31:28] happy, glad, and free.
[31:32] [Music]
[31:38] Praise the Lord.
[31:47] And if I stay close to him, safe from

[1:17:29] [Applause]
[1:17:31] Our
[1:17:34] theme this weekend has been preserving
[1:17:38] the truth in our youth. I believe that
[1:17:42] the Lord um has a people in every
[1:17:46] generation and the way that we as the
[1:17:50] the the the carriers of the word, we
[1:17:53] we're the ones that hand off the baton
[1:17:55] to the next generation. And that's the
[1:17:57] Lord preserving his word. He says that,
[1:18:00] you know, in in Psalms 121 verse um 8, I
[1:18:05] believe it is, that that he says that
[1:18:08] that the Lord shall preserve thy going
[1:18:11] out, thy coming in from this time forth
[1:18:15] and even forever more. In other words,
[1:18:19] he knew that you would be here. He knew
[1:18:22] that you might go out and he knew that
[1:18:25] you would be coming in. And he said,
[1:18:28] "I'm going to preserve my word in you
[1:18:31] and I'm going to bring it into
[1:18:33] manifestation at the right time." Amen.
[1:18:37] Praise God. We've got we've got somebody
[1:18:40] here this evening, our brother Kyrie
[1:18:43] Diggs, who has been anointed of the
[1:18:46] Lord. Amen. To bring the word of God as
[1:18:49] an evangelist.
[1:18:51] Amen. He's got Listen, his last name
[1:18:54] ain't Diggs for a reason. It's there's a
[1:18:58] reason cuz the Holy Spirit can dig
[1:19:00] things out of your life. Last night, he
[1:19:03] was digging out things that were in your
[1:19:04] heart.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; He was checking the condition of your
[1:19:07] heart. Amen. And tonight, I believe he's
[1:19:10] going to go a little deeper. He's going
[1:19:12] to bring you into that relationship with
[1:19:14] him. Amen. And a greater understanding
[1:19:17] so that you as a young person can
[1:19:18] understand this is just not just another
[1:19:21] meeting. This is an appointment with the
[1:19:25] Lord himself.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; This is the five-fold ministry in
[1:19:31] blossom.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, you can listen to the tapes,
[1:19:35] but tonight you can listen to the mighty
[1:19:38] angel's voice himself speak to you
[1:19:41] direct into the needs that you have in
[1:19:44] this day and in this hour. Amen. So,
[1:19:46] it's with great pleasure that I
[1:19:49] introduce to you our brother Kyrie Digs

[1:19:56] Carolina.

[1:21:05] switch out the mics.
[1:21:07] We have to switch out the song leaders.
[1:21:11] Everybody's going to be a song leader.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not like what we just saw.
[1:21:18] Some of you was giving by 20%.
[1:21:21] Some was given 80. Some was given 100.
[1:21:25] But when we get over there, everybody's
[1:21:27] going to be the same.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:31] So, we just love the Lord. If you have a
[1:21:33] unspoken request, you can acknowledge
[1:21:34] the Lord by uplifted hand.
[1:21:37] Amen. Let's pray.
[1:21:40] Lord Jesus, Father God, we enter this
[1:21:42] place on the merits of your mercy and
[1:21:44] grace. And Lord God, we know that it's
[1:21:46] nothing that we have done, but it's all
[1:21:48] your choosing, Lord. You chose us before
[1:21:52] there was a world, Lord. Lord, and the
[1:21:55] conditions of life couldn't stop your
[1:21:59] choosing, Lord. Lord, for you had a
[1:22:02] picture of us, a image of us, of who we
[1:22:05] are and who we are to be. And Lord God,
[1:22:08] we know you're not going to stop until
[1:22:10] we fulfill that image in your mind. So
[1:22:14] Lord, help us to yield to the goodness
[1:22:16] of God, to the grace of God, the mercy
[1:22:18] of God, because it's by your mercy and
[1:22:21] grace that we here today. Lord, we pray
[1:22:23] that you would bless each and every
[1:22:25] church represented. Lord, bless the host
[1:22:28] church, Lord, and the pastor, Lord, and
[1:22:30] all that they put into this meeting,
[1:22:32] Lord. Lord God, I pray you return it to
[1:22:34] them hundfold,
[1:22:36] Lord God. And for those of us who've
[1:22:37] come expecting, Lord, meet our
[1:22:40] expectation.
[1:22:42] Lord, let there be such a release of
[1:22:44] faith in the building, Lord, that the
[1:22:46] enemy won't be able to hide,
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; but you have to let go
[1:22:51] and dismiss himself, Lord.
[1:22:54] Lord, we ask you as always to forgive us
[1:22:57] for our sins and trespasses, Lord. And
[1:22:59] just, Father, take us in a place that
[1:23:02] this flesh, this flesh can't go. In the
[1:23:05] wonderful name of Jesus Christ, we pray.

[1:24:46] Amen. Praise the Lord. Ecclesiastes 3:1
[1:24:52] the Bible says to everything there is a
[1:24:56] season and a time to every purpose under
[1:25:02] the heaven.
[1:25:04] A time to be born and a time to die. A
[1:25:08] time to plant and a time to pluck up
[1:25:12] that which is planted.
[1:25:15] Amen. John chapter 12.
[1:25:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:25] John 12. And
[1:25:29] just to make the reading short,
[1:25:32] uh, verse 24,
[1:25:40] verily, verily, I say unto you, except a
[1:25:42] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[1:25:45] die, it abideth alone. But if it die,
[1:25:50] it bringeth forth much fruit.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And may the Lord bless his word.
[1:25:57] You can have your seats.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tonight, by the grace of God, I I
[1:26:06] need your help. Amen.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. But most of all, we want we want
[1:26:10] the Lord to take over this service.
[1:26:11] Hallelujah.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. But tonight, my subject is uh it's
[1:26:18] a season for change.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; It's a season for change.
[1:26:23] You know, but as we look at the word of
[1:26:25] God,
[1:26:27] look here. The Bible says the verse we
[1:26:29] just read, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:26:32] you, except a corn of wheat fall into
[1:26:35] the ground
[1:26:37] and die."
[1:26:40] That's the first thing we got to do.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; The seed, the life that God put within
[1:26:49] us. Amen. To get that back, we have to
[1:26:54] die.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Because we were all born with a sinful
[1:26:58] nature.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you young people something.
[1:27:01] Amen. Nobody in this building is better
[1:27:04] than anybody.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We all had to come through
[1:27:08] the stages of death.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We all had to experience,
[1:27:13] Amen. a repentance. Hallelujah. We all
[1:27:16] had to experience, Amen. You know,
[1:27:19] realizing that we're wrong.
[1:27:21] realizing that our current nature that
[1:27:24] we were born with doesn't match up with
[1:27:27] God.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; So what did that cause us to do? That
[1:27:30] causes us to repent. Hallelujah.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; And die to our ways. Hallelujah. That's
[1:27:35] the only way we're going to get close to
[1:27:37] God.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; But Hallelujah. What what are you
[1:27:40] saying, Brother Diggs? Acknowledge your
[1:27:42] sins.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Don't play games with it. Hallelujah.
[1:27:47] Don't say, "Well, I I ain't really
[1:27:50] bothering nobody." You make the devil
[1:27:52] strong when you think like that.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I'm not one who who who
[1:27:58] likes to play games with spirits.
[1:28:00] Hallelujah.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; But church, uh uh when you think about
[1:28:04] it, he says, uh except that goes into
[1:28:08] the ground and the first thing it has to
[1:28:10] do is die.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; It abideth alone.
[1:28:16] But if it dies, hallelujah,
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; it's not only going to bring forth
[1:28:20] fruit,
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; it'll bring forth much fruit.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But what good is a seed if
[1:28:26] it don't die?
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is nothing to anybody. Amen.
[1:28:30] Now, I got something for you tonight.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Can you see that?
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; That's a seed. Hallelujah.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; And everybody in here tonight
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; is a seed.
[1:28:45] Hallelujah. See, one thing about this
[1:28:47] seed, I can't put it in a good
[1:28:49] atmosphere and say, "Come forth."
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; I can't just take that seed and put put
[1:28:57] it on the pull pit. I wonder if you
[1:29:00] wonder how many of you know what kind of
[1:29:02] seed this is. Hallelujah. You because
[1:29:05] you've got experience with this kind of
[1:29:08] seed, you can look at it and say, "That
[1:29:11] might be a peach seed." But you will
[1:29:13] never know where stood until it starts
[1:29:16] to come forward.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something. It ain't
[1:29:20] just going to come forward in a good
[1:29:22] atmosphere. It has to find the right
[1:29:24] conditions.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; But the only way I can get anything out
[1:29:30] of the sea, it must first be buried.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; I'm going leave it right there.
[1:29:39] Hallelujah. You say, "Well, oh, Brother
[1:29:41] Diggs, I'm a good person." No, you have
[1:29:44] to experience dirt.
[1:29:47] [Applause]
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Everybody in this room had to experience
[1:29:52] dirt.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Wrong. Sin, hallelujah. And
[1:29:57] it's by the dirt, hallelujah, of our
[1:30:00] lives, hallelujah, that's the first
[1:30:02] stage where life begins to come forward.
[1:30:05] Amen.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; So don't be ashamed that you got
[1:30:08] problems or you got habits or you got
[1:30:10] situations. Those things God put it
[1:30:13] there so you can recognize that are
[1:30:15] greater than Solomon is here tonight.
[1:30:19] [Applause]
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. First stage, amen, is death.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; And without death there be no life. We
[1:30:29] thank God for the resurrection,
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; but there'd be no resurrection
[1:30:35] if there was no crucifixion.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; So Christ came and he had to die.
[1:30:43] Hallelujah. To break the chain of the
[1:30:45] enemy.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; So it was by his death, hallelujah, that
[1:30:50] we are set free. And if you die tonight,
[1:30:53] guarantee you'll be set free.
[1:30:59] [Applause]
[1:31:03] Hallelujah.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Now, we had church last night.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; We had church this morning.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; So, if we don't have church tonight,
[1:31:12] it's because you bring another spirit
[1:31:14] here.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But church, as
[1:31:18] we look at the first stages of death,
[1:31:21] you know, we hear about death and we be
[1:31:23] like, "Oh, I'm so afraid to die."
[1:31:26] No, don't be afraid of it.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Welcome that change.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; We're in a season. Hallelujah. It's a
[1:31:35] season for change. Even right now, we're
[1:31:37] getting close to what? Fall. What
[1:31:40] happens in fall? The the the the sap in
[1:31:44] the tree. It begins to go down in the
[1:31:46] root. Why? To preserve life.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The tree goes through a
[1:31:52] stage where it looks like it's dead, but
[1:31:56] it's really preserving life.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; So church, when you die to yourself,
[1:32:00] hallelujah, you're not Hallelujah.
[1:32:03] You're not in a bad place, but what are
[1:32:05] you doing? You're bringing forth
[1:32:07] something for another season.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; But you look at it, church, when you
[1:32:14] think about death, let's go to um Psalms
[1:32:18] 119.
[1:32:20] No. Psalms 116.
[1:32:23] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:25] Look at it. Ain't nothing still came
[1:32:27] forth yet.
[1:32:29] And the Holy Spirit is here.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is moving.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; But I still ain't got nothing out of the
[1:32:36] seat.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:32:41] Looking nice and pretty, sitting in
[1:32:43] church or or or acknowledging that God
[1:32:46] sent the message ain't good enough.
[1:32:49] Hallelujah. Knowing knowing the name of
[1:32:52] his dog or his horse ain't good enough.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Being to experience the relics and and
[1:32:58] going out to the den and all these
[1:33:00] things ain't good enough. You have to
[1:33:03] die.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; That's our ways.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:12] But how does God look at death?
[1:33:15] Psalms 116 verse1 15
[1:33:19] if you got it say amen.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible says precious is the sight of
[1:33:26] the precious in the sight of the Lord is
[1:33:29] the what? Death of his saints.
[1:33:33] When God look at you, hallelujah,
[1:33:36] repenting, asking him for forgiveness,
[1:33:39] God says, "Oh yes, my child."
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; God says, "Yes, I love it. I can't wait
[1:33:45] to bless you." Hallelujah. Because you
[1:33:48] acknowledge that there is a higher
[1:33:50] power.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; It's a beauty of death.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; It's a It's a glorious thing. When you
[1:33:58] allow God to take over this flesh,
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; we all had to come to a place where we
[1:34:04] die. But we look at it, God said it's a
[1:34:07] precious, it's a beautiful thing. First
[1:34:10] thing about that seed, it must
[1:34:12] experience dark conditions.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; That's pretty much all of us.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; All of us are born in sin. for the
[1:34:24] parents in here. For you young people,
[1:34:27] none of you none of your mas and daddies
[1:34:29] had to teach you how to lie.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; It was already in you.
[1:34:37] You were born with it. Hallelujah.
[1:34:41] It was what is it? It's the surrounding
[1:34:44] of the seed.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What we call flesh. Amen.
[1:34:48] You say you go in there and steal the
[1:34:50] cookies and then mom and dad will come
[1:34:53] say did you two years old come and ask
[1:34:57] you did you take those cookies? No
[1:34:59] ma'am.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; What caused you to look your mom
[1:35:04] straight in her face and lie to her?
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; It's the nature you were born with.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my. It's the nature we all were born
[1:35:16] with. So God wants us to get rid of that
[1:35:20] sinful nature.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can get rid of it
[1:35:23] is to die.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; But church, I want you to understand
[1:35:27] something. You and I, every every one of
[1:35:30] us, your seed has to meet corruption.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; The seed has to meet an atmosphere of
[1:35:41] corruption
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; before it can bring forth life.
[1:35:46] You might say, "Brother D, I'm a good at
[1:35:48] two shoes. I ain't never did nothing."
[1:35:50] You still a wicked seller.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Just for having that thought is wicked.
[1:35:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But you look
[1:36:01] church, they have to take this seed,
[1:36:05] pack it in the ground,
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; put it in a condition
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; where it has to hallelujah be succumbed
[1:36:13] by it surroundings.
[1:36:15] Everything is dark. Hallelujah. Look
[1:36:17] like there's no life. The dirt smothers
[1:36:21] the sea.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We going somewhere now.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; And some of you right now may be
[1:36:31] smothered by your habits.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Some of you may be smothered by your
[1:36:35] wrongs.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But it's all right.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; This is not the real seed.
[1:36:44] But it's the dirt, hallelujah, that
[1:36:47] allows the seed to unlock. Hallelujah.
[1:36:51] And as the seed is in the ground compact
[1:36:54] around all darkness, the longer it sit
[1:36:57] there, it dries out the shell.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Well, like we you see some of the mas
[1:37:05] and daddies, what happened to us?
[1:37:07] Hallelujah. We were so surrounded by
[1:37:09] dirt to one day we said, "I'm tired of
[1:37:12] living like this.
[1:37:16] I'm tired of being in this darkness.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; And as the seed, hallelujah, gets so
[1:37:23] compact with darkness, everything dries
[1:37:26] out and then it starts to break away
[1:37:29] from the shell.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; I wonder if somebody breaking away
[1:37:34] tonight.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you tired of the life
[1:37:38] you're living? Are you tired of doing
[1:37:40] the things that you've done and you say,
[1:37:42] "Man, I got to get loose."
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as that seed begins to
[1:37:48] break forward, why it starts to The
[1:37:52] second thing, Hallelujah. Let me just
[1:37:54] say it like this. I want to read you
[1:37:56] something the prophet of God said. He
[1:37:58] said, "It makes a difference when you
[1:38:02] come sincerely to God."
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Look, hallelujah. You have to die for
[1:38:09] you only live by dead substance.
[1:38:11] Hallelujah.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; I'm here tonight because somebody else
[1:38:14] died.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody else died to their
[1:38:18] ways and they began to live a Christian
[1:38:21] life and I saw that Christian life and
[1:38:24] that Christian life pulled me in. It
[1:38:27] made me want to repent. It made me tired
[1:38:30] of how I was living. And it's because
[1:38:32] they died I'm alive.
[1:38:36] Hallelujah.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Church, don't take it for granted. Just
[1:38:40] coming to church and singing good songs.
[1:38:42] Somebody had to die at this church may
[1:38:44] be like this.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Look,
[1:38:51] we live by dead substance.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Wasn't the fellowship good this evening?
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; We ate some good old Italian sausage.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; The pig had to die.
[1:39:05] Well, we out there.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; I told brother Danny I said
[1:39:16] and that Italian sergeant was busting.
[1:39:18] Hallelujah. But the pig had to die so I
[1:39:23] can receive strength.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we ate some hamburgers.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; The cow had to die.
[1:39:33] And we had to eating the cow. We ain't
[1:39:36] even thinking about what the cow went
[1:39:37] through. All we can say is, "Man, move.
[1:39:42] This cow good. Give me some m put some
[1:39:46] tomatoes on it. Put some pickles on it.
[1:39:49] Let's dress it up." Why? You're eating
[1:39:51] the cow because you want to live.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think about all the
[1:39:56] people, young people in your life that
[1:39:58] sacrificed so you could be here. Think
[1:40:00] about how much mom and daddy sacrificed
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; so you can live.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; What always gets me with young people,
[1:40:10] hallelujah, you know, when when they're
[1:40:12] young, mom and daddy hold their hand
[1:40:14] across the street and the kids go
[1:40:16] willfully
[1:40:18] look up at you and smile cuz you feel
[1:40:21] like they're your protector. Buses come
[1:40:23] and they snatch you back and you don't
[1:40:25] know, you don't even know the trouble.
[1:40:27] You just looking,
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; kicking your leg.
[1:40:32] Next thing when it's time to walk
[1:40:33] because they're your protector, you
[1:40:35] trust that and go
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; and walk.
[1:40:38] When does that change?
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; It changes. Hallelujah. When you start
[1:40:46] thinking for yourself
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; and you start Hallelujah. for some for
[1:40:51] some reason. Hallelujah. When you get
[1:40:53] old or become a teenager, you start to
[1:40:56] think that mom and daddy is no longer
[1:40:58] protecting you from the bus crossing the
[1:41:00] street. Hallelujah. Or protecting you
[1:41:03] from some kind of bad substance. No,
[1:41:06] that love is still there. But because
[1:41:08] you want to live your own life, you
[1:41:11] resist that love
[1:41:15] when it's always been there. They've
[1:41:18] given it. I remember one time I was
[1:41:20] doing something wrong and I began to
[1:41:22] think, hallelujah, how will my mama feel
[1:41:25] if I get caught up doing us? You ever
[1:41:28] thought about that? You ever thought
[1:41:30] about how mama and daddy would feel?
[1:41:32] Hallelujah. If you get caught up in some
[1:41:34] nonsense, most of the time we don't
[1:41:36] because we're thinking about ourself.
[1:41:38] You ain't dead yet.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody will always be
[1:41:43] affected by your actions. Somebody will
[1:41:46] always be affected by your life cuz
[1:41:49] somebody's watching your life. Even
[1:41:51] right here to now, right now in this
[1:41:54] service, your friends are watching you
[1:41:56] how you respond to the word.
[1:42:02] My listen and he say friends, not a sign
[1:42:06] card. Something died that you could live
[1:42:10] forever more. What? Jesus Christ.
[1:42:15] Jesus died. Hallelujah. So we could be
[1:42:17] here in 2025. Hallelujah. Celebrating
[1:42:21] the resurrection.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; But how many of us take it personal?
[1:42:26] Hallelujah. You know, and as that seed
[1:42:28] dies, it breaks away from the shell and
[1:42:32] then the real life within starts to come
[1:42:36] out.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Don't get nervous. I ain't going to be
[1:42:38] long. Amen.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; It's in atmospheres like this where the
[1:42:44] real you will come out.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about two brothers
[1:42:51] for a second.
[1:42:53] Cain and Abel.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; We know the story.
[1:42:58] But one thing I want you to understand
[1:43:00] about Cain and Abel, they grew up in a
[1:43:02] Christian house.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:08] They grew up in a house
[1:43:11] where all was talked about was the glory
[1:43:13] of God.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Adam, hallelujah, the Satan.
[1:43:19] He had no hold over Adam.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible says Adam gave up his life
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; just like who? Christ.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Adam was willing to die to save his
[1:43:30] wife. Hallelujah. See, so he was ready
[1:43:33] to die so that his wife could live
[1:43:36] because God said as soon as you take
[1:43:38] taste of it, you will die. I wonder how
[1:43:41] many of us are ready to die for the
[1:43:43] cause.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; The cause of Christ.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; But I want you to look at these boys for
[1:43:50] a second.
[1:43:52] All they heard every day. Think about
[1:43:55] it. Son, me and mom, we will be in the
[1:44:00] presence of God. and God would come down
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; and we would fellowship in the cool of
[1:44:05] the day.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; It was such a glorious time.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was no mystery. We didn't
[1:44:12] hear two voices. It wasn't one soul. It
[1:44:16] wasn't a thunder. It was God himself.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; And he would come down and we we would
[1:44:21] have fellowship. Hallelujah. And I
[1:44:23] wasn't hallelujah distracted by his
[1:44:25] voice. Hallelujah. I knew exactly how he
[1:44:28] sound.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He wasn't Adam wasn't
[1:44:32] giving a testimony to those boys of what
[1:44:35] somebody else said.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; He was telling them what he experienced.
[1:44:40] Hallelujah. He was telling what him and
[1:44:42] his mama experience. Hallelujah. On the
[1:44:45] daily. Can you imagine? Hallelujah.
[1:44:49] Seeing God every day.
[1:44:52] And then because of your choices,
[1:44:57] because of your choice,
[1:45:00] it takes you right out of that
[1:45:01] atmosphere.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; This atmosphere here tonight can go with
[1:45:06] you everywhere you go.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; The only thing will stop it is your
[1:45:10] choices.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But look this day, Adam,
[1:45:17] Eve, Cain and Abel are going to church.
[1:45:22] Every day they heard about the goodness
[1:45:24] of God. Every day you imagine, can you
[1:45:27] imagine Adam talking to his boys and he
[1:45:30] say, "Son, hallelujah. I would walk down
[1:45:34] in the Sahara in the safari and look at
[1:45:37] the lion and say, Kitty, come here.
[1:45:43] And if that big old line was
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; and it will come right up to his master,
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; it will come right up to him.
[1:45:55] Hallelujah. And there was no fear.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Adam had no fear.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he had a life without
[1:46:07] sin,
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; you imagine he controlling everything.
[1:46:10] Hallelujah. He'd walk up to the tree and
[1:46:12] grab an apple off the tree and another
[1:46:14] one would pop back on it just like that.
[1:46:17] That was the atmosphere he lived in.
[1:46:19] Hallelujah. Amen. You talking about
[1:46:21] prosperity, Adam was the king of it.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; And he would hallelujah tell his boys
[1:46:29] about that life.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'd speak to creation and it
[1:46:33] would obey."
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:36] This is what Hallelujah Bible study was
[1:46:39] like in Adam's house.
[1:46:42] And you know what? It's the same in your
[1:46:45] house.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; We talk about the same God Adam talk
[1:46:50] told Adam told Cain and Abel about.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But what happens is we
[1:46:56] reason with it. Amen. But look, he's
[1:46:59] telling those boys about God and his
[1:47:01] relationship and how mom and daddy saw
[1:47:03] God every day till sin came in and took
[1:47:07] away that.
[1:47:09] Sin took away that relationship.
[1:47:11] Hallelujah. Sin took away God coming
[1:47:14] down every day having fellowship. But
[1:47:16] what I want you to understand, it wasn't
[1:47:19] on God's end.
[1:47:22] God remained faithful.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Even when they were caught in sin, God
[1:47:29] still came down and call their name.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; And God is calling your name tonight.
[1:47:36] [Applause]
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; How's he calling you? By his word.
[1:47:46] It's not an identity of Cadre or Danny
[1:47:50] or Nelson or Miguel. It's an identity of
[1:47:53] seed inside.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; And if the word hallelujah is doing
[1:47:58] something to you, hallelujah,
[1:47:59] connecting, that's God calling your
[1:48:01] name.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; God called Adam, Adam, where art thou?
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Even after they committed sin,
[1:48:15] So I don't want to hear your excuses
[1:48:17] tonight.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Brother D, I got this problem.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; I got that problem.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Adam, Adam,
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; the ones who started it all.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; After they sinned, God still was
[1:48:34] faithful.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; So you can't give me tonight, brother D,
[1:48:39] but my problem is different. Adam, Adam.
[1:48:43] Where are thou?
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; And God didn't stop until he was face to
[1:48:50] face with Adam again.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; And he won't stop until he's face to
[1:48:55] face with you again.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; If you belong to him, he'll keep calling
[1:49:00] your name
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; and he won't stop.
[1:49:05] But then you think about it, church.
[1:49:07] These boys, they grew up in a good
[1:49:09] house, a good atmosphere. Hallelujah.
[1:49:12] But then there was going to come a day
[1:49:14] where everything they heard had to be
[1:49:17] tested.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Everything they heard, hallelujah, was
[1:49:21] either going to live or die.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; You can only produce what's in your
[1:49:26] seed.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Now, this is a peach seed. The only way
[1:49:31] I can get apples out of this is if God
[1:49:34] does something supernatural.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; And that's what I love about God. People
[1:49:40] looked at me and said, "He ain't going
[1:49:41] to never be nothing. They ain't know
[1:49:43] what was in my seed."
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; So don't judge it by the outside. God
[1:49:47] can do something supernatural.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And even for the parents,
[1:49:52] sometimes we look at our kids and we
[1:49:54] don't believe what's in the inside.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Look,
[1:50:03] now they get to a place where it's time
[1:50:05] to worship.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? They get to a place
[1:50:09] where it's time to worship.
[1:50:11] And he says, "Okay,
[1:50:14] now I didn't talk y'all about God. I
[1:50:16] done told y'all about God all y'all
[1:50:18] life. Now it's time for y'all to show
[1:50:21] what you believe."
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; What if God tonight
[1:50:28] would ask you to show me what you think
[1:50:32] about me?
[1:50:38] I preached a message one time called Now
[1:50:40] what?
[1:50:42] Now what? In the same book of
[1:50:45] Ecclesiastics.
[1:50:47] Amen. I'm following your pull tonight.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; And God is hitting these areas cuz some
[1:50:52] of you want to drift on me, but we going
[1:50:53] to pull you back in.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Listen. Hallelujah. I preached a message
[1:50:58] called Down What? One time. Amen. The
[1:51:01] same book. Hallelujah. Solomon. Solomon
[1:51:04] said he's going to give his heart to
[1:51:08] experience everything he desired.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand he wasn't
[1:51:13] tricked.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Everything he did was what he desired.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says he had men servants.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Solomon knew what it was like to have a
[1:51:26] butler. Hallelujah.
[1:51:28] Solomon had maids.
[1:51:31] The Bible says Solomon had dancers.
[1:51:34] Solomon had a Beyonce before there was a
[1:51:36] Beyonce.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Solomon had a Chris Brown before there
[1:51:42] was ever a Breezy.
[1:51:51] I know where you at. Hallelujah. But
[1:51:55] church, hallelujah.
[1:51:57] Solomon said he's going to build himself
[1:52:00] houses.
[1:52:02] The biggest houses you see out on uh uh
[1:52:05] Lake Ontario doesn't even compare to the
[1:52:08] palace Solomon's living in.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Solomon had vineyards.
[1:52:19] You talking about organic
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; stuff we would kill for right now.
[1:52:28] Real stuff. Solomon had herds, real
[1:52:31] beef, not just soybean stuff.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Everything you could think about. The
[1:52:36] Bible says, and this is for some of you,
[1:52:38] Solomon had gold and diamonds.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; You know, the first thing somebody do is
[1:52:44] when they struggling, they go put on a
[1:52:45] little fake chain.
[1:52:55] thing ain't even real.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; First thing you want to do is put a
[1:53:01] little chain around your neck.
[1:53:03] Especially boys looking like a little
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Walking around with a little chain on
[1:53:08] your neck. Hallelujah. What the sister
[1:53:10] want to do? Put a little ring on.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Then they go too far. Want to put
[1:53:14] something on the ankle.
[1:53:18] So what
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; you know in some cultures that anchor
[1:53:22] bracelet represent prostitution.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; And if you have hunger to do these
[1:53:31] things, amen, you ain't dead yet.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; You go put your little chain on. H. The
[1:53:37] Bible says don't wear graven images.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we ought to ask
[1:53:41] ourselves, do we want to be a Christian
[1:53:43] or not?
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't fake it out. If you
[1:53:47] really going to be one, be one.
[1:53:48] Hallelujah. And I can say this cuz look,
[1:53:51] I had gold changed this big.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; I don't tell this stuff all the time cuz
[1:53:59] some of y'all I hear it and bring a
[1:54:01] uncertain sound. Well, brother D. God
[1:54:05] can deliver me, too.
[1:54:08] God deliver him. He can deliver me, too.
[1:54:11] He say he had ropes. He say he had her
[1:54:14] bones. If he God dealt him when his time
[1:54:17] came, he can do the same for me. You
[1:54:19] might be the one who neck get infected.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; But the bigger issue was it wasn't the
[1:54:31] gold chains. It wasn't a h a the the
[1:54:35] ankle braces or the rings.
[1:54:38] I wore that stuff for image. Amen.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; How people looked at me when I had it
[1:54:45] on.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Let me say this right now. Hallelujah.
[1:54:48] And look, you do whatever God tell you
[1:54:50] to do.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; I ain't telling you go home and take it
[1:54:53] off cuz you be taking it off for me.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Do what God tell you to do.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; And I'll say it just like this.
[1:55:00] Hallelujah. Before I died, I came to
[1:55:03] church as I was.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what I love about my
[1:55:07] pastor. He accepted me how I was.
[1:55:11] Hallelujah. Came to church with my
[1:55:13] Jordans on, with my gold on, all that
[1:55:15] stuff. He said, "Boy, come on in his
[1:55:17] word."
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; See, you got to be in the right
[1:55:23] atmosphere. Hallelujah.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to welcome them in. Amen.
[1:55:28] Come on in here. You know how they say,
[1:55:30] you know, they got false scriptures.
[1:55:32] Now, the Bible say, "Come as thou are."
[1:55:35] That ain't even in the Bible.
[1:55:43] Really?
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Really?
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Just like Eve eating an apple ain't even
[1:55:50] in the Bible.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; That's things made up by men. Bible say
[1:55:56] she ate a fruit. People
[1:56:05] say all the time, well, you know, in my
[1:56:06] church, you know, we uh we come as we,
[1:56:09] you know, the Bible say come as you are.
[1:56:10] The Bible don't say that.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; But you're welcome to do that.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Come as you are. But the real
[1:56:19] interpretation of that, come as you are,
[1:56:23] but don't remain the same.
[1:56:26] Amen.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. We want you to come as
[1:56:31] you are.
[1:56:33] Come with all your problems. Come with
[1:56:35] all your issues. But don't look to
[1:56:38] remain in that condition. If you want
[1:56:40] God, if you want God, be prepared to
[1:56:43] die.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Be prepared to give up something.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, friend of mine, we
[1:56:51] was at work one time. Hey, y'all know
[1:56:53] I'm a storyteller. We was at work one
[1:56:56] time and he he was a nominational
[1:56:58] Christian. He said he said, "Hey Dre,"
[1:57:01] he said, "Man, I like rap gospel." He
[1:57:03] said, "Man, it just, you know, I just
[1:57:05] like the beats." And you know, I pulled
[1:57:07] up beside somebody and I was just
[1:57:09] praising God and you know, I had my
[1:57:11] speakers in the back and it was that
[1:57:12] thing was thumping.
[1:57:14] He said, "Lady pulled up beside me and
[1:57:16] she was like,
[1:57:20] he said, I wish she could have hear what
[1:57:23] I was listening to.
[1:57:25] She did hear it.
[1:57:32] If you hear that, that ain't going to
[1:57:34] make you want to say,
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; you ain't dead yet. Amen.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I used to
[1:57:44] have a
[1:57:53] baby made me want to get loose. Baby
[1:57:54] want
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Let me let me give you a little insight.
[1:58:10] I do these things so that you could see
[1:58:13] I enjoy God.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; I enjoy church.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; I enjoy the atmosphere of the Holy
[1:58:23] Ghost. I enjoy when we all come
[1:58:25] together. I enjoy when we worship. I
[1:58:29] enjoy seeing you smile.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; That's the problem. Hallelujah. We've
[1:58:34] come to church and presented church as
[1:58:37] some old dad tradition. But God is
[1:58:40] alive. We are happy. We're excited about
[1:58:44] God. We love the Lord. I gave up my life
[1:58:47] for this. And I enjoy it. You ain't
[1:58:51] going to make me be a bubble along.
[1:58:55] I'm going to dance. I'm going to worship
[1:58:57] because God's been good to me.
[1:59:03] God's been good to us.
[1:59:06] And we sit back in church like a bunch
[1:59:08] of mannequins.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Anybody woke up this morning?
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; I said, did anybody woke up this
[1:59:20] morning?
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Who did that for you?
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Who did that for you?
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; So, you ought to be able to give him
[1:59:26] some praise.
[1:59:32] And what you going through shouldn't be
[1:59:34] able to stop you from giving God praise.
[1:59:39] Where you come from, your background,
[1:59:41] none of that didn't stop God from waking
[1:59:44] you up.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; So none of that should stop you from
[1:59:49] giving God praise.
[1:59:52] [Applause]
[1:59:59] We've hammered conduct and order so much
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; people get rebuke because they smile.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Ain't no smiling. You You laugh too
[2:00:09] much. This is serious.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Y'all know Jesus had a sense of humor.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; I give you a scripture.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus talking about Harry. He said, "Go
[2:00:23] tell that old fox." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Jesus called a man a fox. Call him out
[2:00:28] his name.
[2:00:31] Oh. Oh my. But what we do, we want to
[2:00:36] make everything fit
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; to our liking.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. You ain't going to do that to
[2:00:42] me.
[2:00:43] [Music]
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to give me some old dead
[2:00:47] cold church service. Hallelujah. I come
[2:00:50] to worship. Hallelujah. I come to give
[2:00:53] God praise. And if I want to give a high
[2:00:55] five, I'mma give a high five.
[2:00:57] Hallelujah. Because God has been good to
[2:00:59] me. Hallelujah. And if I want to give
[2:01:01] God some praise, that's what I'm going
[2:01:03] to do. Amen. And if I want to do it with
[2:01:05] my brothers, they going to do it with
[2:01:06] me. Hallelujah. Because we are glad
[2:01:09] about Jesus. We are glad about the
[2:01:12] resurrection.
[2:01:16] If you need Jesus, you've come to the
[2:01:19] right place cuz you are more believers.
[2:01:23] We are believers.
[2:01:24] [Applause]
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Church on that day of Pentecost, they
[2:01:29] were worshiping. They were excited. They
[2:01:32] was changed forever.
[2:01:34] [Applause]
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Bible say they were drunk.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; What happened? They had died,
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; died to their religion, died to their
[2:01:51] ways. They didn't even care how people
[2:01:53] was looking at them. Peter said, "This
[2:01:56] is that.
[2:01:57] This is that. This is that." And I'm
[2:02:02] saying tonight, this is that. If you
[2:02:05] want God, this is that you are in the
[2:02:09] right place.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:18] This is a fresh anointing.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Ain't something cold and stale from the
[2:02:24] 1960s,
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; but it's a God that's alive.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; It's a God that can still
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; take away sin.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church. Look,
[2:02:38] as I think about it,
[2:02:40] you know, the grace of God and what the
[2:02:43] Lord has done, you take those two boys,
[2:02:46] Adam and Eve, all they heard about from
[2:02:50] their youth was the message of the hour.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Can anybody relate?
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Can anybody relate?
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Adam and Eve. Hallelujah.
[2:03:04] All they could do was talk about God.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; That's the message of the hour.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Talking about God and what God has done.
[2:03:12] Hallelujah. A prophet came to what?
[2:03:15] Bring us back to God. Not to himself,
[2:03:19] not to his church, not to his graveyard,
[2:03:22] not to his caribou, not to his bear, not
[2:03:26] to his belt buckle, but back to God.
[2:03:31] That's where we are tonight. We are in
[2:03:34] the presence of God. Everything else is
[2:03:37] dead. Everything else is irrelevant. But
[2:03:40] God is still alive.
[2:03:43] God is still delivering. God is still
[2:03:46] breaking yolks. God is still
[2:03:49] [Applause]
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; I see some of you.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That just emotion
[2:04:03] that they he he getting the people all
[2:04:06] excited.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; What you want me to do? Get them
[2:04:10] prepared for a funeral
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; or should we celebrate God?
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Should we celebrate God
[2:04:22] or should we all put on black suits,
[2:04:25] black dresses and get ready? Hallelujah.
[2:04:28] [Music]
[2:04:34] I told my family
[2:04:36] if I was to leave before y'all, don't
[2:04:39] nobody come to my funeral in a black
[2:04:41] suit.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz my going on is going to be a joyous
[2:04:48] occasion.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the one that I served all
[2:04:55] this time. I'm going to be in his
[2:04:58] presence. Hallelujah. So, you ought not
[2:05:00] to cry for me. You ought to say, "He
[2:05:04] made it.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; He made it."
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Church, think about those boys.
[2:05:13] Everybody all right,
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; man. This thing still ain't brought
[2:05:17] forth no life.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; All this Holy Ghost in here and it still
[2:05:21] ain't brought nothing for
[2:05:23] It still look the same to y'all too,
[2:05:25] don't it,
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; man? You know the prophet said the
[2:05:28] closest place to God on earth is where?
[2:05:31] The pull pit.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; And it still ain't brought nothing.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; I hope you catching me.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just coming to church
[2:05:45] sitting here ain't that ain't it.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; There has to be a death. Amen.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Has to be a death.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Like I say, I'll go back to myself when
[2:05:58] I came when I first came in early stages
[2:06:01] where I saw a life. I saw my mom really
[2:06:06] come into something real.
[2:06:08] And it was this truth, church. And and
[2:06:11] and and we started to experience she she
[2:06:14] she hate me for saying this, but we
[2:06:17] start to experience grace then wrath.
[2:06:20] Cuz
[2:06:24] mama ain't play.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them kids who had to be home
[2:06:28] before the stop lights come on.
[2:06:31] Street lights. See y'all know nothing
[2:06:34] about that. We got right. I you gave I
[2:06:37] called the I call the government on
[2:06:39] youm.
[2:06:42] Our parents will come to school and beat
[2:06:44] you.
[2:06:46] Beat the teacher too. She get in the
[2:06:48] way.
[2:06:57] for the adults.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; But I used to say
[2:07:07] I used to say with her
[2:07:10] I saw her changing right before me.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; What was happening? It was a death where
[2:07:18] she would just used to go upside our
[2:07:21] head because we didn't do what she say.
[2:07:26] Y'all might as well say amen. It's the
[2:07:28] truth.
[2:07:30] Y'all know before we got the Holy Ghost,
[2:07:32] we were some of us were rough.
[2:07:35] Some of us were quick to fight.
[2:07:37] Like some of you young people, you get
[2:07:39] mad real quick. Real quick. Mama told
[2:07:42] me,
[2:07:45] "I wish you would in my house."
[2:07:51] My mama's first name is Sonora,
[2:07:55] and that Z is for whip.
[2:08:02] I say, "She ain't watching this, so she
[2:08:04] can't get me."
[2:08:06] But what we start to experience, we
[2:08:09] start to see a life changing. We started
[2:08:12] to see somebody dying. Hallelujah. But
[2:08:15] we didn't know what was going on. What
[2:08:16] was happening? She was getting closer to
[2:08:18] God.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Something that her Pentecostal church
[2:08:22] couldn't do.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Church. I never forget cuz we were
[2:08:29] stopped. I hope everybody all right.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; I never forget one of one of the Miguel.
[2:08:34] One of the first things I saw I said,
[2:08:35] "Boy, mama changing."
[2:08:38] Me and my brother used to have to be
[2:08:40] home before the stoplight. Come on. Just
[2:08:42] in case y'all don't know what that mean.
[2:08:44] That means before the sun go down.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; That's a We in a different day now. Wish
[2:08:52] you would tell a child. Come on.
[2:08:54] All my friends out. All my friends. I
[2:08:57] don't care what your friends doing. You
[2:08:58] ain't in this house. shooting.
[2:09:06] Me and my brother was shooting
[2:09:07] basketball.
[2:09:10] A man, I wish he just preached the word.
[2:09:12] I am.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; The word is reality.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; I ain't here to tell you about what God
[2:09:23] did in Noah. I'm here to tell you about
[2:09:25] what he did in me.
[2:09:28] I ain't here to tell you about what God
[2:09:30] did in a prophet. I'm here to tell you
[2:09:31] about what he did in me.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Cuz the same seed in them is the same
[2:09:35] seed in me.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which is the same God.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I ain't taking away from
[2:09:41] their experience. Amen. We need them.
[2:09:43] Hallelujah.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; But anyway, me and my brother was
[2:09:46] shooting basketball and the sun started
[2:09:48] to go down. I said, "Well," I said,
[2:09:50] "Well, we getting lost. Let me let me
[2:09:52] get out of here.
[2:09:54] I ain't get nothing tonight.
[2:09:58] So I started easing my way back home.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; Bro kept playing cuz they were winning.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; He knew full well what the rules was.
[2:10:09] But you know what? He winning feeling
[2:10:11] good. So he said, "You know what? I'm
[2:10:13] going to be disobedient tonight."
[2:10:17] That's normally how disobedience take
[2:10:19] place. What is it? It's called pleasure.
[2:10:26] The whole world is in the condition it's
[2:10:28] in now because Eve found pleasure.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; And pleasure is the thing. Hallelujah.
[2:10:37] What the enemy will give you, he'll give
[2:10:39] you a false conception of pleasure.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For people who smoke
[2:10:45] cigarettes, they say
[2:10:52] one after one. And then you ask them,
[2:10:54] you say, "Why are you smoking?" It
[2:10:55] relaxes me.
[2:11:00] Not even realizing you smoking tar.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; You actually killing yourself.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Church, you ever thought about
[2:11:07] Hallelujah. For all of you who've been
[2:11:09] tried by that and and you got friends
[2:11:11] who might be smoking a little blunt here
[2:11:13] and there.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's in here.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; It's in here.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something about me.
[2:11:29] Hallelujah.
[2:11:30] If there's something in your life
[2:11:33] that's not under the blood, we going to
[2:11:36] talk about it tonight.
[2:11:39] because it's not covered.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; So God will talk about it and just show
[2:11:44] it to you so you can ask for
[2:11:46] forgiveness.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; But some of us are so stubborn. We know
[2:11:51] God talking to us and we look down at
[2:11:53] the floor.
[2:11:58] You keep on rolling.
[2:12:04] You keep
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; you You can see I'm a guy from around
[2:12:14] the way.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But look, pleasure
[2:12:20] pleasure is the thing that defeats a lot
[2:12:23] of people,
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; especially a lot of young people.
[2:12:25] Hallelujah. You get caught up in the
[2:12:28] things that you like. Hallelujah. Some
[2:12:30] of us are so caught up on the internet.
[2:12:33] And I wonder how many of you got got a
[2:12:35] got a subscription.
[2:12:42] What streamer you are caught up with?
[2:12:46] I wonder how many of you are just so in
[2:12:48] love with Cassinet
[2:12:51] or I show speed.
[2:12:54] All these different streamers that you
[2:12:56] look at their life and you like, man, I
[2:12:58] wish I had that.
[2:13:00] They wish they had what you got.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; They wish they had God.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. They life is in a whirlwind. And
[2:13:10] when it all start to crumble, you know
[2:13:12] what they do? They run back to God.
[2:13:15] But pleasure is the thing that started
[2:13:17] this whole thing. Hallelujah. And you
[2:13:20] know, like I was saying, my brother
[2:13:21] them, they were winning. They were
[2:13:23] winning. So he kept playing. I think
[2:13:25] they had him beat everybody. They kept
[2:13:26] playing. Kept playing.
[2:13:29] I start making my way to the house. I
[2:13:32] ain't feel like getting down tonight.
[2:13:35] So, I'm in the house safely.
[2:13:38] Light. Come on.
[2:13:42] Sun down. No, brother. I said, "Boy,
[2:13:45] this going to be good, boy."
[2:13:51] I said, "Boy, this your mama go up. This
[2:13:53] going to be good."
[2:13:57] Y'all know how we is with our siblings.
[2:14:01] Shame on you.
[2:14:05] And not want to see your sibling get
[2:14:11] church.
[2:14:12] He finally get home. It's black outside.
[2:14:16] The moon out.
[2:14:20] I said, "Boy, this going to be a show.
[2:14:21] Get your popcorn ready."
[2:14:25] Mama going to cut loose cuz she didn't
[2:14:27] did it before. So I know something about
[2:14:29] to happen. So you know what? I'm kind of
[2:14:33] watching but really don't want to be
[2:14:35] seen cuz when that belt get to flying if
[2:14:36] you in the way you going to get
[2:14:38] something too.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; You know how it is. You hang with the
[2:14:44] wrong person they get caught doing
[2:14:46] something. Hallelujah. You are guilty by
[2:14:48] association.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Oh you say brother D, I don't do that.
[2:14:52] Hallelujah. If you hanging with those
[2:14:53] kind of people, that spirit in you, too.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Look, he comes in. Hallelujah.
[2:15:02] My mama say, "Boy, you know when they
[2:15:04] call you out your name, you're in
[2:15:06] trouble."
[2:15:08] Boy, what you doing come this lady?
[2:15:09] Said, "Mom, we were winning and we were
[2:15:11] winning and you know what I'm what I'm
[2:15:13] going to tell the fellas, man. I got to
[2:15:14] go cuz I got to be home before the sun
[2:15:16] come down."
[2:15:18] She said, "Yeah, you got to be home
[2:15:19] before the sun come down." He said, "But
[2:15:20] mom, we were winning and I ain't want to
[2:15:22] just leave." She said, "Okay, well, next
[2:15:24] time
[2:15:28] you play,
[2:15:31] you win the game, and then you come
[2:15:33] home. Don't you do this again."
[2:15:35] I'm sitting over there like,
[2:15:42] "You ain't going to do nothing.
[2:15:45] I didn't came home for nothing.
[2:15:50] She ain't even raise her voice.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; And he look at me like,
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; but that was me seeing a season of
[2:16:04] change.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; That was me seeing that somebody else is
[2:16:10] dealing with mama.
[2:16:13] when there used to be wrath because
[2:16:15] rules are broken. Now she's giving
[2:16:18] grace.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm like, what is happening to her?
[2:16:21] And it didn't stop there. It was over
[2:16:23] and over different situations where she
[2:16:26] would once bring the wrath. Now she's
[2:16:27] talking to us, trying to understand
[2:16:29] where we're coming from. And we wasn't
[2:16:31] used to that.
[2:16:34] We were used to ducking.
[2:16:43] But when God comes in,
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; like brother Miguel was saying and
[2:16:48] brother Danny was saying, when God comes
[2:16:51] in, hallelujah, he's not going to play
[2:16:54] second fiddle.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; He's going to change your nature.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what God does is he
[2:17:01] changes your taste.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You start to lose the desire
[2:17:06] for certain things. What is it? It's the
[2:17:09] Holy Ghost making room.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost possessing that
[2:17:15] body.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; So, he starts to push out things that
[2:17:19] doesn't agree with his nature.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; He starts to push out things that
[2:17:24] doesn't agree with his mind.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; But the thing is, when we allow God to
[2:17:29] take control of the house,
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; maybe tonight God is trying to push
[2:17:34] something out the way
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; so he can possess the house.
[2:17:39] But we'll come when we'll come and say,
[2:17:41] "Well, I did my good deed. I came to
[2:17:42] church."
[2:17:44] But like I said, church, I came. I'm
[2:17:47] talking about a death. I came to church.
[2:17:50] Hallelujah. Like they say, as you are,
[2:17:53] as you were, but as I sat there, the
[2:17:57] word start to do something to me.
[2:17:58] Hallelujah. The word start to
[2:18:01] Hallelujah. invade my privacy.
[2:18:05] Hallelujah. The word start to invade my
[2:18:08] thoughts and God start to make himself
[2:18:11] welcome. Hallelujah.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. God started to spread around and
[2:18:16] before you know it, those gold chains
[2:18:18] didn't mean anything to me anymore.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; God gave me a simple revelation. I say
[2:18:24] me. Hallelujah. Again, I ain't trying to
[2:18:26] tell nobody what to do. It got to be you
[2:18:28] and God.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; But one day, I looked in the mirror.
[2:18:32] Hallelujah. I was about to go somewhere
[2:18:34] and boy I was suited and booted boy. I
[2:18:37] was suited and booted. Boy, I had it on.
[2:18:41] I had it on boy. Gucci links.
[2:18:46] Had on my Gucci rope. Hallelujah. My
[2:18:48] hair and bone. And I looked in the
[2:18:51] mirror and God said, "Now,
[2:18:56] when you step away from this mirror,
[2:18:59] you ain't gonna see nothing you got on.
[2:19:02] So everything you got on is for
[2:19:04] everybody else.
[2:19:09] You ain't going to see your chains.
[2:19:13] You ain't going to see your rings, your
[2:19:15] bracelets.
[2:19:17] Everything you got on is for your image
[2:19:21] when people look at you.
[2:19:26] And the Lord start to deal with me in
[2:19:27] such a way. Hallelujah.
[2:19:30] To where I'm not wearing this for me.
[2:19:32] I'm wearing this for
[2:19:35] everybody else.
[2:19:40] So it became real simple. I stopped
[2:19:42] doing things for everybody else and I
[2:19:45] started doing for myself.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:50] That's the change.
[2:19:55] I wonder even right now if I was to
[2:19:58] close, have you died yet?
[2:20:02] All the word that's been preached in
[2:20:04] this place. Hallelujah.
[2:20:07] It doesn't have to be Hallelujah.
[2:20:09] rolling over of chairs
[2:20:13] and everybody screaming to the top of
[2:20:14] their lungs. Although I love it,
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; I love it. Hallelujah.
[2:20:21] Hallelujah. But when God deals with us,
[2:20:25] it's a sincere act.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:30] It's inviting him in to take over.
[2:20:33] Church, what happens after death?
[2:20:38] after the seed dies and the Bible says
[2:20:42] rocks.
[2:20:45] She is no good. She hadn't rotten yet.
[2:20:50] The seed ain't rotten.
[2:20:53] It was just peeled away from the fruit.
[2:20:57] Hallelujah.
[2:20:59] But when it's rotten, it starts to
[2:21:01] decompose.
[2:21:04] It starts to be unrecognizable.
[2:21:07] It starts to meet corruption.
[2:21:10] Hallelujah.
[2:21:12] It has to get to a place, hallelujah.
[2:21:15] Where its life is not its life.
[2:21:19] The quickening power within begins to
[2:21:22] take over and bring it back to life
[2:21:25] again.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; When you die, God takes over that you
[2:21:31] may live.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then this seed,
[2:21:36] hallelujah,
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; which is planted in the ground,
[2:21:41] what begins to activate the process? The
[2:21:44] warmth of the sun.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; The seed
[2:21:53] can be buried under four feet of
[2:21:55] concrete.
[2:21:57] That's right.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; And once the sun starts to warm up that
[2:22:01] concrete,
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, there's something inside of
[2:22:06] that seed
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; that connects with the su.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Even concrete can't stop that
[2:22:12] connection.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; Pornography can't stop that connection.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; The internet can't stop that connection.
[2:22:22] Substance abuse can't stop that
[2:22:24] connection. molestation can't stop that
[2:22:27] connection. If you ever get in the
[2:22:30] presence of the sun, you will come
[2:22:33] forth.
[2:22:38] And I want to tell you, the sun is
[2:22:40] shining right now.
[2:22:44] The warmth of the Holy Ghost is in the
[2:22:47] room right now,
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; and he's trying to pull you out of the
[2:22:51] concrete.
[2:22:56] church. That's what happened to us. We
[2:23:00] came to church in that condition after
[2:23:03] we died, repented. Hallelujah. You know
[2:23:06] what? We might need to fill this pool up
[2:23:09] cuz I've been feeling back there that
[2:23:10] somebody need to give their life.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You've been coming to church
[2:23:14] too many times. Now is the time to give
[2:23:17] your life.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; Now is the time to mean business with
[2:23:21] God. You know, brother Miguel, I've been
[2:23:25] saying to myself,
[2:23:27] what good
[2:23:29] is an annual meeting every year if
[2:23:32] nobody repents?
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; What good is an annual meeting if the
[2:23:43] young people don't enter into a change?
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; I know some of you came for the food.
[2:23:53] and good neighbor. Y'all outdid yel,
[2:23:55] boy. Y'all y'all put a ice cream par out
[2:23:57] there this time.
[2:24:00] See, whatever.
[2:24:04] Happy.
[2:24:06] But what good is all that
[2:24:09] if you leave out of here with the same
[2:24:10] spirits in your life when the sun is
[2:24:13] shining?
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:16] Look, even brother Miguel said it.
[2:24:19] Hallelujah. We'll spend time, young
[2:24:21] sisters. We'll spend time reading
[2:24:23] romance novels.
[2:24:25] How you want your relationship to go.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Sister told me one time she was reading
[2:24:36] a romance novel
[2:24:39] and as she was reading it, God broke her
[2:24:42] into another realm cuz she was a
[2:24:45] Christian. Hallelujah. broke into
[2:24:47] another room and showed her a mirror
[2:24:52] while she's reading the novel.
[2:24:55] Showed her evil spirits standing behind
[2:24:57] her, caressing her hair.
[2:25:02] Showing her that as you're reading this
[2:25:04] novel, you're really entertaining evil
[2:25:06] spirits.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of us in this room got
[2:25:13] things in our life that we're
[2:25:14] entertaining.
[2:25:16] where the basis of it is an evil spirit.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; Y'all see where we at now? Now we're
[2:25:27] moving into demonology
[2:25:29] where God is trying to set somebody
[2:25:31] free.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; You've been holding on to that thing so
[2:25:35] long and God's trying to set you free.
[2:25:38] There's enough power in here to cast out
[2:25:41] any demon,
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; to cast out any devil,
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; but you got to want to go free.
[2:25:49] [Applause]
[2:25:53] Hallelujah.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; I've seen young people in church
[2:25:59] possessed by demon demon spirits.
[2:26:02] Hallelujah. One young girl, as soon as
[2:26:05] the spirit started moving, her eyes
[2:26:07] rolled back in her head. Pastor told me,
[2:26:10] he said, "Hey, go pray for us something
[2:26:11] some something." I was at another
[2:26:12] church. He said, "Go pray for us
[2:26:13] something." She out of breath. And I
[2:26:15] walked up to her, she was go.
[2:26:18] Her eyes rolled back in her head. It was
[2:26:20] a spirit that didn't want her to go
[2:26:23] free. And I walked up to that devil and
[2:26:26] said, "Hey, you got to go.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; You got to get out of here.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Leave her body right now.
[2:26:35] And every bornag again holy ghost fil
[2:26:39] person in this room got power over
[2:26:42] demons.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; Don't you think you got to live that
[2:26:49] way?
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; The main thing that gets us is fear.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; The imaginations of fear.
[2:26:59] We paint out these scenarios
[2:27:03] of things that hadn't even happened.
[2:27:06] If I get saved, my boyfriend gonna leave
[2:27:08] me. Let him go.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; Let him go. I guarantee you there's a
[2:27:15] Christian man that'll treat you a whole
[2:27:16] lot better.
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:20] Vice versa. Amen. Let her go. If she not
[2:27:24] willing to serve God, let her go.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:28] But church, when you look at all of
[2:27:31] these things, you get to the place to
[2:27:33] where, man, this thing still ain't
[2:27:34] brought forth life.
[2:27:38] How many believe God is here?
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; And this thing still ain't came forth.
[2:27:46] The only way it's going to come forth,
[2:27:50] it has to experience dirt,
[2:27:55] water,
[2:27:58] sunlight.
[2:28:02] All of us have experienced dirt.
[2:28:07] And right now, God is giving you the
[2:28:09] water.
[2:28:12] But are you going to bathe in the
[2:28:13] sunlight? Are you going to spend time
[2:28:16] with God? Hallelujah. Don't get nervous.
[2:28:19] I ain't going to be too much longer.
[2:28:21] But church, once that seed once the seed
[2:28:25] starts to feel the presence of the sun,
[2:28:28] there's something in it that cannot stay
[2:28:31] away.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:38] And it's rice. You ever heard a farmer
[2:28:40] say, "Man, the sun came it, spring came
[2:28:43] a little too fast and then it got cold."
[2:28:47] Because when spring came, hallelujah,
[2:28:50] the rays of the sun projected a certain
[2:28:52] way on that crop and it just started
[2:28:55] coming forth. It can't be stopped.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; The process, that connection can't be
[2:29:02] stopped. And I want to say to you, if
[2:29:04] God has a seed in you, and if he ever
[2:29:07] starts dealing with you, the devil can't
[2:29:10] stop that.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brad, I'm not ready." It ain't
[2:29:19] going to stop.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I ain't ready to give my
[2:29:23] life." It ain't going to stop. He going
[2:29:26] to keep coming and coming until you
[2:29:29] surrender
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; because you belong to him.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; Joy.
[2:29:38] I look around while I'm preaching
[2:29:41] and some of y'all look like this the
[2:29:44] most angriest time of your life.
[2:30:00] Are you happy about what God is doing in
[2:30:02] your life?
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; And if you're not happy,
[2:30:11] it's because you haven't met that
[2:30:13] connection yet.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me wind this down.
[2:30:21] Okay.
[2:30:25] Death.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; Y'all know what that mean, right?
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; I've been preaching for one hour.
[2:30:40] Hallelujah.
[2:30:43] We spend longer than that on the
[2:30:44] internet.
[2:30:48] We longer than that on IG,
[2:30:52] Tik Tok,
[2:30:55] captivated by the stories
[2:30:58] and we get in God's presence. We got a
[2:31:00] time limit. How are you ever going to
[2:31:03] make it in eternity if you have a time
[2:31:05] limit?
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; Church, let me say it like this.
[2:31:11] After you come through those stages,
[2:31:13] like I said, don't get nervous. I'm
[2:31:14] about to close. Hallelujah. Because I
[2:31:17] know some of y'all thinking we got
[2:31:19] refreshments after those
[2:31:25] church
[2:31:27] after you come through those stages.
[2:31:30] First stage death,
[2:31:32] second stage, hallelujah,
[2:31:34] is where the life starts to come forth.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the word in you seeing
[2:31:43] the word.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the connections of life
[2:31:48] starting to connect. It ain't what you
[2:31:51] doing, it's the grace of God.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God allowing you to be in an
[2:31:57] atmosphere where the word can connect
[2:31:59] with your seed. And as that word connect
[2:32:02] with your seed, life starts to come
[2:32:04] forth.
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; But God ain't done yet. There's still
[2:32:10] more. Amen. What happens when you start
[2:32:13] to grow? You're not finished. until you
[2:32:16] start producing fruit.
[2:32:19] [Applause]
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible says, "You shall
[2:32:26] know them by their fruit."
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you are no good to me until
[2:32:32] you stop producing fruit.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; The Bible say he gave one five talents.
[2:32:40] He gave another two talents and he gave
[2:32:43] one one talent and he gave all of them
[2:32:45] the talents according to the ability he
[2:32:48] knew that was in them.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If God gave you something is
[2:32:53] because he knew he knew you could
[2:32:56] produce fruit with it.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look, the five brought forth
[2:33:02] five. The two brought forth two. But the
[2:33:06] one who said, "I ain't ready yet.
[2:33:10] I ain't ready yet.
[2:33:14] I
[2:33:15] I'mma mess it up.
[2:33:18] I'm afraid.
[2:33:21] So I'm I'mma just bury it."
[2:33:24] God said, "You wicked
[2:33:27] and unprofitable servant."
[2:33:30] And I want you to catch the scripture.
[2:33:33] He said, "Why didn't you take what I
[2:33:35] gave you to the exchanges
[2:33:38] and bring me interest?"
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[2:33:47] he's the vine
[2:33:49] and we are the branches.
[2:33:54] Young people,
[2:33:58] you owe us something.
[2:34:04] You owe me something. Hallelujah.
[2:34:10] And until you give it to me, you're in
[2:34:13] debt.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; There's something God put inside y'all
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; that belongs to me.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; There's something God put inside y'all
[2:34:24] that belongs to us. And until you give
[2:34:27] it to us, you're in debt.
[2:34:30] Hallelujah. There's something God put
[2:34:32] inside of everybody's seed.
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; And until you give it to us, you owe us.
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; But the thing of it is is people are
[2:34:44] satisfied burying what God put inside of
[2:34:47] them.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm the vine. Ye are the
[2:34:53] branches." What does a branch do? A
[2:34:56] branch bears fruit of the life of the
[2:34:59] vine.
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna make it real personal, young
[2:35:05] people. Hallelujah. What's supposed to
[2:35:08] happen is you're supposed to be God's
[2:35:11] hands.
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be God's feet.
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be the attributes of
[2:35:17] God.
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; And until you start to give me that, you
[2:35:21] are in debt.
[2:35:24] H. You owe us. Hallelujah. Amen. God put
[2:35:28] something in you that should produce the
[2:35:31] same life that went in the ground.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; And until I see God just coming to the
[2:35:37] youth meeting ain't good enough.
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; It's time to bring forth life.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:47] Now, before I close,
[2:35:50] this is the question.
[2:35:53] What stage are you in?
[2:35:56] Because everybody may not be in the same
[2:35:59] stage.
[2:36:01] Some of you may be in a stage where you
[2:36:03] need to die,
[2:36:05] but that don't mean the person a little
[2:36:08] further ahead better than you. No, it's
[2:36:11] just another stage.
[2:36:13] Some of you may be in a stage where you
[2:36:15] didn't you didn't acknowledge that
[2:36:17] you're a sinner and you've you've
[2:36:19] repented and gave your life to God, but
[2:36:22] you sitting in church dead.
[2:36:27] There's another stage.
[2:36:30] There's another season. Hallelujah.
[2:36:32] Amen. Like I said about Solomon, Solomon
[2:36:35] experienced everything. And then he said
[2:36:38] all the music. He say he had music.
[2:36:40] Amen. Solomon was Solomon had his Taylor
[2:36:43] Swifts, his Cardi B's, his megs, he had
[2:36:46] every He had his Glor.
[2:36:58] It's amazing to me, Brother Danny,
[2:37:01] that our young people think that they
[2:37:03] can come to church, experience all this
[2:37:05] worldly stuff, and God not to talk about
[2:37:08] it.
[2:37:10] God is real
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; and he's mindful of the life that you
[2:37:17] have
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; and he talks about these things because
[2:37:20] he wants to set you free. Hallelujah.
[2:37:23] But the thing of it is is do you want to
[2:37:25] go free?
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Or do you want to say,
[2:37:29] "Well, I went to church. It was good. It
[2:37:31] was a good atmosphere."
[2:37:33] What about God breaking the chains?
[2:37:36] No, the chains ain't good enough. What
[2:37:39] about God breaking the shackles?
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; Because the chains can be broke, but if
[2:37:45] you still got shackles on them, hook
[2:37:47] them chains right back up again.
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; And some of us experience a powerful
[2:37:52] anointing and we thank God and walk out
[2:37:55] free, but we still got shackles on us.
[2:37:58] And as soon as we go back home, those
[2:38:00] demons jump right back on us again.
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:06] I was in a church one time
[2:38:09] and this lady was hearing the word
[2:38:12] and all of a sudden she just started to
[2:38:15] getting frantic and say, "I got to go. I
[2:38:17] got to go." She got up and leave.
[2:38:20] Be careful.
[2:38:22] Those of you be hearing the word and
[2:38:23] you, man, I got I'm got I'm going to get
[2:38:26] me some water.
[2:38:29] I'm I'm going I got to use the bathroom.
[2:38:33] All these different things. Sometimes it
[2:38:35] be spirits that don't want to come out
[2:38:38] because they hear the word and they hear
[2:38:40] the word talking directly to them.
[2:38:42] Hallelujah. Sometimes, hallelujah,
[2:38:44] people don't come to church because God
[2:38:46] is so direct.
[2:38:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is not picking on
[2:38:52] anybody. Hallelujah. Let me say it like
[2:38:54] this. If you've heard me talk about
[2:38:56] anything in your life, what is it? It's
[2:38:57] God's love.
[2:39:03] [Applause]
[2:39:11] This young lady, she walked outside. Her
[2:39:14] car was blocked, so she couldn't leave.
[2:39:17] So, she had to come back in. The brother
[2:39:20] was still preaching.
[2:39:22] She was getting frantic and she went in
[2:39:25] the back and the spirit took over. She
[2:39:29] started throwing chairs in the back of
[2:39:31] the church.
[2:39:32] Now, if you would to ask her that
[2:39:34] morning when she woke up if she thought
[2:39:35] she was going to ever go to church and
[2:39:37] start throwing chairs, she would have
[2:39:39] said no.
[2:39:41] But she had babysitted that spirit so
[2:39:44] long till it got to a place to it
[2:39:47] embarrassed her
[2:39:49] and she started throwing chairs and
[2:39:52] doing all this stuff. And uh they come
[2:39:54] and running and get the brothers. She
[2:39:56] throwing chairs. The spirit the spirit.
[2:40:04] I walked back there, me and some
[2:40:05] brothers.
[2:40:07] I looked in her face, say, "Put that
[2:40:10] chair down."
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; You know what she did? She put the chair
[2:40:16] down.
[2:40:19] Cuz that spirit recognized another
[2:40:22] spirit.
[2:40:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:27] And when you get another spirit in you,
[2:40:29] all of your habits will recognize that
[2:40:32] there's something else taking place.
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; When you get God in you, hallelujah, it
[2:40:38] won't be so easy to do certain things
[2:40:40] anymore because the devil will recognize
[2:40:42] that there's something else living
[2:40:44] inside of you.
[2:40:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You young people hear us
[2:40:48] talk about God and the Holy Ghost is
[2:40:50] something real. Amen.
[2:40:55] &gt;&gt; It's something real. I can go on and on.
[2:40:58] I was in South Africa. Hallelujah.
[2:41:01] And a young man,
[2:41:04] look at where we're going now.
[2:41:08] The Holy Spirit start to move like it's
[2:41:10] moving right now. Dealing with hearts.
[2:41:15] Hallelujah. Remember I said last night,
[2:41:18] the devil doesn't know what's in your
[2:41:20] heart.
[2:41:21] All he can do is hear and study you.
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; So what he'll try to do is block the
[2:41:27] word
[2:41:28] &gt;&gt; because it's the word that sets you
[2:41:30] free.
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And look church. Hallelujah.
[2:41:34] This this this this young lady.
[2:41:37] Hallelujah.
[2:41:39] She started the spirit started moving
[2:41:43] and coming out
[2:41:45] and screaming and I mean this young this
[2:41:47] young fell he started screaming and
[2:41:49] doing all these things right in the
[2:41:50] middle of a youth meeting.
[2:41:53] The power of God start to move him.
[2:41:56] I realized something.
[2:41:59] If God is in us
[2:42:02] the devil has to fall subject.
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:42:08] So he started screaming and hollering
[2:42:10] and all these things. I walked up to him
[2:42:13] when nobody else could hear me. And I
[2:42:16] said, "Hush."
[2:42:19] He said,
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; he had to hush cuz I told him to.
[2:42:27] Didn't Jesus do that in the Bible?
[2:42:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Be quiet. Come out of
[2:42:32] them."
[2:42:34] So me just being foolish enough to do
[2:42:36] what Jesus did
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; if he and me is the same God. It's the
[2:42:41] same spirit, it's the same controller of
[2:42:44] demons. So it'll do the same thing
[2:42:46] today. So I walked up to him. I said,
[2:42:49] "Hush." He said, I said, "Come out
[2:42:51] quietly. Be quiet." He said,
[2:42:54] and the spirit came out just like that.
[2:43:02] What are you saying, brother D? Come,
[2:43:04] musicians, come.
[2:43:07] Why do we end up on that?
[2:43:11] Cuz I'm challenging spirits.
[2:43:15] And I want every spirit in here that's
[2:43:18] not of God
[2:43:20] to know that we are stronger than you.
[2:43:23] Hey,
[2:43:26] &gt;&gt; there's more of us than it is of you.
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; There's more Holy Ghost anointing in
[2:43:34] here than demon powers.
[2:43:38] So, I'll say to Satan and his imps, you
[2:43:42] have to let go.
[2:43:48] But it takes a willing heart.
[2:43:51] It takes somebody who's tired of living
[2:43:53] the way they living,
[2:43:56] man. This thing still ain't came for.
[2:44:01] What is it going to take? It has to be
[2:44:04] buried.
[2:44:05] There's a season to die.
[2:44:09] &gt;&gt; There's a season for birth.
[2:44:12] &gt;&gt; And then there's a season for fruit.
[2:44:15] &gt;&gt; And the thing of it is, I'm asking you
[2:44:17] tonight, what season are you in?
[2:44:20] Hallelujah.
[2:44:21] Like I said, get the pool ready.
[2:44:23] Hallelujah.
[2:44:25] Hallelujah. I believe that there are
[2:44:27] some genuine Hallelujah. conversions in
[2:44:30] this room.
[2:44:32] &gt;&gt; No, I'm not saying that everybody is
[2:44:34] sinners and everybody got habits and all
[2:44:37] these things. Hallelujah. But what
[2:44:38] season are you in?
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; God doesn't bring a a a a word like like
[2:44:44] the brother said this morning. Who told
[2:44:46] you that?
[2:44:50] And like I said about Solomon, Solomon
[2:44:52] experienced everything. He did
[2:44:54] everything under the sun. He experienced
[2:44:57] the music, the women, the men, the the
[2:45:00] the the the movies, all the stuff that
[2:45:03] you think about you want to do. Solomon
[2:45:05] experienced all of it. And his
[2:45:07] conclusion was all vanity
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; and vexational spirit.
[2:45:15] Amen.
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; All of it made Solomon weary.
[2:45:20] &gt;&gt; He said the conclusion of the matter is
[2:45:22] to serve God.
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; So I'll ask you if you leave this room
[2:45:29] without God.
[2:45:32] I'll say you're telling yourself you
[2:45:35] love being in the condition you in.
[2:45:40] We say, "Well, I'm I'm just Brother
[2:45:42] brother D. I appreciate it. But I'm just
[2:45:44] I'm just trying to find God.
[2:45:47] I'm make this real plain. God is not
[2:45:51] missing.
[2:45:55] God is not in hiding.
[2:45:58] &gt;&gt; He's waiting on you to acknowledge his
[2:46:01] presence. He wants to do it for you
[2:46:04] greater than you want it. He's a
[2:46:07] deliverer.
[2:46:09] He's a peacegiver.
[2:46:11] He's a mighty conqueror.
[2:46:14] &gt;&gt; He's a warrior.
[2:46:17] &gt;&gt; He's help in the time of trouble.
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; If you in trouble, he's your help.
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; All of my help comes from the Lord.
[2:46:31] &gt;&gt; Every bit of it.
[2:46:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:35] Every bit of it.
[2:46:37] But you ask yourself, you just want to
[2:46:38] be a pretty seed sitting in that
[2:46:41] atmosphere
[2:46:43] and ain't never bringing forth nothing.
[2:46:50] &gt;&gt; We're in the presence of the Holy Ghost
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; and that's all it's been was just a
[2:46:55] pretty seed.
[2:46:58] It ain't gave us nothing.
[2:47:01] But if I bury it,
[2:47:04] if I water it,
[2:47:07] if I bring it in the presence of the
[2:47:09] sun,
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; it'll give me that life inside.
[2:47:16] &gt;&gt; I wonder tonight, young people, will you
[2:47:20] give me life?
[2:47:22] Will you give back life to me?
[2:47:25] Hallelujah. And some of us ain't so
[2:47:27] young.
[2:47:32] Some of us been living this way a long
[2:47:34] time,
[2:47:36] just being an idol worshipper.
[2:47:39] But what about knowing that God is in
[2:47:42] full control?
[2:47:44] &gt;&gt; That God is the one.
[2:47:47] Hallelujah.
[2:47:49] God is the one doing it.
[2:47:53] Hallelujah.
[2:47:54] What season are you in?
[2:48:01] See, right now this is spiritual
[2:48:02] warfare.
[2:48:05] And I know most of you are thinking
[2:48:07] about it.
[2:48:09] Don't think too long.
[2:48:11] Be prepared to make a decision.
[2:48:15] Will it be God
[2:48:17] or are you going to just go back to the
[2:48:19] life you was living?
[2:48:22] Hallelujah.
[2:48:25] Put the song up for me.
