[17:48] resurrect every single hearted here this

[18:04] see that from the beginning of time,
[18:07] your love has been expressed, oh God.
[18:09] It's been nothing but love, Father.
[18:12] Lord, your love expressing down through

[18:43] Father, but I believe with all my heart
[18:46] by by the election of God, God's mighty
[18:49] hand of love leading us here this
[18:52] morning as we gather together, Lord
[18:54] Jesus. And Father, as we gather in your
[18:57] presence, we want to receive what you
[18:59] have for us this morning, oh God. We
[19:02] don't want to leave empty, Lord. We
[19:04] don't want to leave the same way, Lord,
[19:07] because you have predestinated us this
[19:09] morning. You have called us here this
[19:12] morning, Lord, to receive something from
[19:15] you, Lord. That's your desire in your
[19:17] heart to give us a more of you, a part
[19:21] of you this morning, Lord. And I pray in
[19:24] the name of Jesus Christ, Lord, that you
[19:26] would move upon every heart, Lord, this

[19:31] through this place, fill this place, oh
[19:34] God, this morning, every heart, Lord,
[19:37] that we will experience what the
[19:39] resurrection is, Lord. What the Easter
[19:42] morning means to us, Lord, not what the
[19:45] world has projected on our minds, Lord,
[19:47] but we leave here, oh God, with a peace
[19:50] that passes all understanding in our
[19:52] hearts, oh God. a a a a freedom of
[19:55] deliverance in our souls, Lord, in our
[19:58] minds, in our hearts, Lord, that you
[20:00] would just move in a mighty way and heal
[20:03] the people, Lord. Lord, there there
[20:06] might be afflictions in their minds, in
[20:08] their hearts, in their spirits. There
[20:10] might be circumstances upon their lives
[20:12] this morning, but you are greater. You
[20:15] have risen, Father. The the quickening
[20:18] power is here this morning to do what it
[20:21] needs to do. Lord, give people the faith
[20:24] this morning, oh God, to receive it,
[20:26] Father. And Lord, as the word would come
[20:29] forth once again, the most important
[20:31] part of the service, Father, I sent my
[20:34] word. It's your It's always been your
[20:37] spoken word, Lord, that has changed
[20:39] everything. Your spoken word created the
[20:42] worlds that we see. It created us this
[20:45] morning. It created all things, oh God,
[20:48] this morning. Once again, Lord, not by
[20:51] man, not by might, not by power, but by
[20:54] your spirit, sayeth the Lord. Come
[20:56] again, Lord, and speak your word, your
[20:59] created word into our hearts, Lord. And
[21:01] may there be hearts that will receive it
[21:03] this morning, Lord. If there's any
[21:06] doubt, Lord, any demon power, Lord, any
[21:10] power of unbelief, Father, cuz we know

[21:32] daughters of God have liberty and have
[21:34] gathered this morning to hear from God
[21:37] Almighty in the name of Jesus Christ.
[21:40] Loose these atmospheres and Lord come

[23:38] All I want to do is
[23:43] love his soul.
[23:46] [Music]
[24:36] service to the King of
[24:38] Kings. Because he died so I can live. I
[24:42] will live my life in service to the
[24:45] king because he loves great and
[24:49] small. I will serve him with my
[24:53] all because life on earth is temporary.
[24:57] I will give my time to gain eternity. I
[25:01] will serve Jesus Christ my Lord that
[25:04] gave me with a double-edged sword. He
[25:06] slew the giant and later prophesied the
[25:09] Messiah would die. But his body not see
[25:12] corruption.
[25:15] I will serve Jesus Christ, my Lord, like
[25:17] the prophet Isaiah, who turned from the
[25:19] influence of the world, received the
[25:22] call of fire and declared to Israel. His
[25:25] name will be called
[25:28] Emanuel. Although I am young and have a
[25:31] lot to learn, I know I must have
[25:33] revelation to receive God's word. I will
[25:36] serve the King of Kings by giving him my
[25:40] heart, my time, my talents, my thoughts,
[25:44] my everything. The Lord Jesus Christ
[25:47] died so I can be reconciled, redeemed,
[25:49] and restored. He has shown me the way
[25:52] back to who I was before the foundation
[25:54] of this world. I am his child, his
[25:57] attribute, his seed. So I will love and
[26:00] serve the King of Kings with all of me.
[26:04] [Applause]

[32:17] [Music]
[32:32] be ready.
[32:35] I
[32:36] see. I
[32:44] see the cross
[32:49] of darkness
[32:54] from the sea
[32:57] of good enough for me.
[33:04] Oh, they

[33:52] How wonderful it is to be in the house
[33:53] of the Lord. Amen. as we have to
[33:55] celebrate. You know, I was just thinking
[33:57] about love and then our brother touched
[33:59] on the song the capstone of love and it
[34:01] just blew, you know, birthe my heart
[34:03] open because it's like when you have a
[34:05] revelation of who God is and how much he
[34:07] loves us, right? As our pastor shared on
[34:09] Friday, victory day, he died to give us
[34:11] the victory and then now he loves us
[34:13] beyond the love that we can even begin
[34:15] to comprehend. So, I just pray that
[34:18] beyond anything you recognize how much

[38:07] morning? Let me
[38:11] see if the
[38:13] [Music]
[38:14] spirit had raised Christ from the
[38:18] dwelling.
[38:20] [Music]
[38:39] Oh my
[38:52] Your word also.
[39:00] [Music]
[39:07] [Music]
[39:16] [Music]
[39:18] As
[39:20] long
[39:22] [Music]
[39:26] you will
[39:28] break your body.
[39:44] [Music]
[39:48] dwell in
[39:50] you. Amen. Praise God. Glory to God.
[39:55] Amen. Thank you. Amen. God bless you
[39:58] saints. Amen everybody. Welcome into the
[40:00] house of the Lord. Happy Easter.
[40:03] Happy resurrection morning. Amen.
[40:07] It's um I believe this is the most
[40:11] significant most important day in the
[40:14] history of the world
[40:16] was when he kept his promise. He went to
[40:19] Calvary but he kept his promise. He
[40:23] said, "I will raise up again
[40:27] and then I will send you the comforter
[40:31] which is my spirit, the Holy Ghost." And
[40:35] when it comes upon you, it's going to
[40:37] guide you. It's going to lead you. It's
[40:39] going to direct you. It's going to bring
[40:41] you into a perfect relationship with me
[40:45] like you've never possibly imagined.
[40:47] Amen. Praise God. And so, we're very
[40:51] excited today to be in the house of the
[40:53] Lord um and celebrate this glorious day.
[40:56] Next Sunday, we will have our former
[40:58] pastor uh brother John Simon who will be
[41:01] ministering for us. Amen. And um I'm
[41:04] looking forward to that. I always get
[41:06] excited. I don't know about you, but I
[41:08] always get excited when uh when uh he he
[41:11] ministers the word of God. Amen. I love
[41:14] him. I respect him as my elder, as like
[41:17] a father in the in the gospel. Now, I
[41:19] don't call him father John. So, don't
[41:21] worry, okay? We call no man father. We
[41:25] have one heavenly father. We have our
[41:27] earthly uh mother and father, of course,
[41:29] and we love them and and we respect
[41:31] them. But when it comes to the gospel
[41:33] and the word of God, we have one father
[41:36] and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[41:39] Amen. So, I'm looking forward to um uh
[41:42] listening to our uh precious brother
[41:45] John who uh is always music to my ears.
[41:49] It just it just meets the need. I was
[41:51] birthed under that ministry. I was
[41:53] birthed under the voice that proceeded
[41:56] from his mouth. But I knew it was the
[41:58] voice of God. Amen. And that's what we
[42:01] have recognized in our day by God's
[42:03] grace. That same voice is still speaking
[42:07] today. Amen. We know God sent us a
[42:10] prophet and God's voice oh it sounded
[42:14] right around the world over seven times.
[42:16] But when the prophet left the scene, he
[42:19] introduced us to the voice that was the
[42:22] voice that was in him. Amen. And that's
[42:24] what we follow today. That's what uh
[42:26] inspires us. And it's that
[42:30] spirit that's going to raise us up.
[42:32] Amen. Glory to God. And so, um, we want
[42:35] to continue to remember Sister Carol.
[42:38] Um, she had some surgery. Sister Carol
[42:40] Lewis had surgery this past week. She
[42:42] was brushing with life and death, but
[42:45] somehow the Lord is keeping her and the
[42:48] prayers of the saints. She's very
[42:49] grateful for that. She spoke with Sister
[42:52] Jennifer yesterday and and let us know
[42:54] that she's back home and she's getting
[42:57] better and she appreciates everybody's
[42:59] prayers. Please continue to pray for
[43:01] her. Amen. Praise God. How many has a
[43:04] request this morning? Has a need this
[43:06] morning. Say, "Lord, remember me. I have
[43:09] a need." Glory to God. Father, we're so
[43:12] grateful this morning. Lord, as we
[43:15] approach your word, Father, we approach
[43:17] it with uh Lord, with sovereignty within
[43:20] our hearts, oh God, with humility, Lord.
[43:24] We approach you because you are the king
[43:26] of glory. We recognize, Lord, that we
[43:29] are uh very
[43:31] unable, we're not capable, Lord, to do
[43:35] anything without your spirit and your
[43:37] presence when it comes to the to the
[43:40] preaching of your word. But Lord, we
[43:42] just ask that you will anoint these uh
[43:45] scriptures, these uh notes that I've
[43:48] laid down. Father, there's so many
[43:50] notes. Lord, I can't even imagine in my
[43:53] mind how to convey the things that burn
[43:56] within my heart, Lord, as as I studied
[43:59] this week. And Lord, it just it's too
[44:02] much. It it's just hard when I come to
[44:04] this place now where I've got to uh
[44:07] convey to the people, Lord, I need your
[44:09] help. And Lord, we all need your help to
[44:12] to give us the portion that we all have
[44:14] need of. So Lord, anoint your people to
[44:17] pull on you. And may you meet every
[44:20] need, Lord, and anoint this vessel. I
[44:22] surrender it to you, Father. Have your
[44:25] way, Lord. We love you. We appreciate
[44:27] you, Lord. And we surrender all things
[44:30] now. We We so thank you for this
[44:33] wonderful day, Lord. It is the rising of
[44:36] the sun, Lord. We appreciate you. We
[44:39] love you. We can't say enough. Lord, may
[44:42] you have your uh precious way now. We
[44:44] pray in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you,
[44:47] saints. Let's look to our
[44:49] scripture. We've been on a series here
[44:53] on um this is love. And we know that um
[44:57] saints, everything that that that we
[45:00] read from the word of God, I want you to
[45:02] know that it's it's a love letter to
[45:05] you, to the bride, to the church, the
[45:08] the word of God is his love letter to
[45:11] us. And we want to look within the word
[45:14] today. We're going to be looking at the
[45:16] Apostle John a little more in depth.
[45:19] We're going to see how he relates to the
[45:21] church and why he's been called the
[45:23] apostle of love. That's why his gospels
[45:26] are called the gospels of love. Amen.
[45:28] Praise God. And so, um, there's I've got
[45:31] so much that I want to bring, but I'm
[45:34] going to just see how the Holy Spirit
[45:36] leads me through these notes. And as you
[45:38] pull on the word of God, I believe we're
[45:40] all going to receive our portion. Amen.
[45:42] Romans chapter 8 verse 11 a very
[45:46] familiar scripture says but if the
[45:48] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[45:52] the dead dwell in
[45:53] you he that raised up Christ from the
[45:56] dead shall also
[45:59] quicken speed
[46:01] up take your molecules and translate
[46:05] them and change them and move them from
[46:09] one dimension to another. He's going to
[46:12] quicken your mortal body. The word that
[46:15] we are receiving in this day and in this
[46:18] hour that the church, the the the true
[46:21] church is is feeding on is is a word
[46:24] that will quicken. Amen. It'll transform
[46:27] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[46:31] dwelleth in you. Praise God. You may be
[46:37] seated. Amen. We had a Good Friday
[46:40] service here where we talked about the
[46:42] victory of the resurrection. And truly,
[46:45] that is the victory for us is the fact
[46:48] that he rose and that he came and that
[46:52] he gave of himself and he's come back
[46:54] now onto the church to prove to this
[46:57] world that the that that the victory is
[47:00] going to be fulfilled in the scripture
[47:03] of a rapture. Amen. that that there's
[47:05] going to be a group of people,
[47:08] individuals that are going to be a part
[47:10] of the body of Jesus Christ. It's not
[47:13] because you're going to belong to a
[47:15] certain church that you're going to go
[47:16] in the rapture. It's not it's not going
[47:18] to be because you belong even to a
[47:20] message church or that you heard that
[47:22] God sent a prophet or that God has
[47:25] anointed uh you know uh the the
[47:28] five-fold ministry in this hour. It's
[47:30] going to take a lot more than that,
[47:32] saints. It's going to take a personal
[47:35] revelation, a personal experience,
[47:39] something that is going to change you,
[47:41] that you will never be the same. Amen.
[47:45] Once you've had this experience, the
[47:47] rapture will become a reality. You'll
[47:50] realize that you've already been
[47:51] raptured. You've already been taken out
[47:54] of this world because you're a strange
[47:57] speckled bird. You're living different
[47:59] than others. you're you're you're uh you
[48:01] know you're not like the rest of the
[48:03] world, but it's because of the life of
[48:06] Jesus Christ that dwells within your
[48:09] mortal body that causes you to live a
[48:12] life that's completely contrary to that
[48:15] which we see out there in the world and
[48:17] even in the church world. Amen. Praise
[48:21] God. Now, if you've met the God and the
[48:24] spirit that I'm talking about here,
[48:26] you'll know exactly what I'm saying. If
[48:29] not, listen closely because the Lord is
[48:33] going to speak to us today. Amen. Praise
[48:36] God. Let's go to the next slide. Today's
[48:39] title is resurrected with him. The
[48:43] resurrection has taken place. But if the
[48:46] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[48:48] dead dwell in you, and you should know
[48:51] by now if it's dwelling in you, then
[48:54] you'll know you're already resurrected.
[48:56] You've already been snatched out of this
[48:58] world. Amen. And you're in a a rapture
[49:01] condition. You're you're you're on your
[49:03] way to a complete and total body change.
[49:06] It's going to culminate in the body
[49:08] change. It's going to culminate in the
[49:10] in the moment and in the in the
[49:12] twinkling of an eye, but it's already
[49:14] started in your life when you receive
[49:17] this word. Amen. And so let's read our
[49:20] uh our first quote here from it is the
[49:24] rising of the sun. But if the spirit of
[49:27] him, God, the holy spirit that raised up
[49:31] Jesus from the dead dwell in you. Now
[49:34] there, there you are. If the
[49:37] bridegroom's spirit dwells in the bride,
[49:42] if the bridegroom's spirit dwells in the
[49:46] bride. So there is actually a marriage
[49:49] that's taking place right now between
[49:51] Christ and the church. Amen. And this
[49:56] marriage is in progress. And it requires
[49:59] for the bridegroom's spirit to dwell in
[50:02] you as the church, the bride. When God
[50:05] made his first bridegroom, he made the
[50:09] bridegroom first and he was both man and
[50:12] woman in
[50:14] spirit. Formed him in the dust of the
[50:18] earth to make him material. And notice
[50:20] when he made Eve from Adam, he took not
[50:24] another piece of clay. He took the same
[50:27] piece of clay. So if you're a part of
[50:30] God, it's because you come from God.
[50:33] Amen. You come from his body. You come
[50:37] from his mind. You come from his very
[50:40] existence, his being. You are an
[50:43] attribute of God. He took not another
[50:45] piece of clay. He took the same piece of
[50:48] clay, the same word. For Adam was a
[50:52] spoken word. See, he took from him and
[50:56] then taken he had masculine and feminine
[50:59] spirit and he took the feminist spirit
[51:03] away from Adam and placed it in Eve.
[51:08] So, it's still part of Adam's spirit.
[51:13] Amen. It's Adam's flesh.
[51:17] Then it was Adam's spirit,
[51:21] the dynamic that quickened the mechanics
[51:24] of his body.
[51:27] So the bride must also be flesh of his
[51:30] flesh and bone of his bone. Glory to
[51:36] God. Amen. So here we see now that the
[51:40] bride is
[51:43] actually Adam, Christ, a portion of him.
[51:48] She's not something different. She is
[51:52] actually an attribute of God, a part of
[51:56] God. And the same spirit that was in
[51:59] Adam was in Eve. That's what quickened
[52:02] them to live. Amen. Praise God. And so
[52:06] we know now that it's not going to be uh
[52:10] uh uh because you joined a church. It's
[52:13] not going to be because you put your
[52:15] name on a certain church or you belong
[52:18] to a denomination that believes in Jesus
[52:21] Christ. It's going to be that he himself
[52:25] declares to you personally that you are
[52:28] a part of me. And you shall know that I
[52:31] am in the father, ye in me, and I in
[52:34] you. On that day, you're going to know
[52:36] that it's you and God. It's you in
[52:39] Christ. It's you. It's Christ in you
[52:42] that's going to quicken you out of this
[52:44] dimension. Amen. And we are right now in
[52:48] that dimension and dispensation of
[52:51] perfect love.
[52:54] This whole
[52:56] story in the mind of God was an
[52:59] expression of his love for his children,
[53:03] his family. We are the seed gene of God.
[53:08] And he had always in the back part of
[53:11] his mind wanted to have this this
[53:13] fellowship, this this uh
[53:17] uh existence with his family. And God
[53:21] can only have fellowship with God.
[53:25] God can't you can't understand God
[53:28] unless you've got the spirit of God.
[53:31] That's why the Bible says it's
[53:32] impossible to please him without his
[53:35] spirit. And his spirit, the Bible says
[53:38] God is
[53:40] love. And so this is the age of the love
[53:43] dispensation.
[53:45] This is the age where your relationship
[53:48] uh experiences a love which is called
[53:51] the love divine. It's the agape love of
[53:55] God. It's it's this that we've been
[53:57] talking about. It's this love that's
[54:00] taken you out of this world, taken you
[54:03] out of the tradition that you were
[54:04] under, pulled you away from church
[54:08] membership and and tradition of man.
[54:11] It's brought you into a personal love
[54:14] relationship with God himself. Amen.
[54:18] Let's look at our next scripture here in
[54:20] 1 John
[54:21] 4:16 because we're going to be looking
[54:23] at John here very closely. And I want
[54:26] you to see the
[54:28] relationship and the relation and the
[54:30] type and why it is that that you are
[54:34] experiencing and recognizing the word
[54:37] that's being revealed in this day and in
[54:39] this hour.
[54:41] John was was a gospel of love. And we're
[54:44] going to see that all his gospels were
[54:47] gospels of love. And we have known and
[54:49] believed the love that God hath to us.
[54:53] God is
[54:55] love. And he that dwelleth in love
[54:58] dwelleth in God and God in him.
[55:02] So if you have been called to the
[55:04] revelation of this hour, you have been
[55:08] called to a grace and a love that
[55:11] supersedes any other kind of love that
[55:15] you could have ever possibly
[55:17] imagined. And as you grow in that
[55:20] relationship with God, you'll better
[55:22] understand what it is that I'm saying.
[55:24] Amen. Praise God. And so we're in this
[55:28] capstone age. It's called the bride age.
[55:31] And the church is now being called into
[55:34] this
[55:36] age. Whether you know it or not, that's
[55:40] the age that we're living in now. We're
[55:43] beyond the seven church age. Praise God.
[55:46] We've entered into the capstone age. And
[55:49] God has sent us a 20th century prophet
[55:52] by the name of William Branham who came
[55:54] and was the one to fulfill certain
[55:58] scriptures. Malachi 4:5 and Revelations
[56:02] 10
[56:03] 1-7. And by by recognizing these
[56:06] scriptures, it is the first step of you
[56:09] entering into that age without
[56:13] recognizing this messenger because God
[56:16] sent messengers. God does nothing unless
[56:19] he first reveals it unto his servants,
[56:21] the prophets. And we need to understand
[56:24] that in order to understand the age that
[56:27] we're living in. And to not recognize
[56:30] the fulfillment of scripture that
[56:33] pertains to a particular age and
[56:36] dispensation is to miss Christ.
[56:39] It's always been that way. When Christ,
[56:41] they were talking about him coming in
[56:43] the Old Testament. Behold, he comes
[56:46] riding in on the on the full on the on
[56:49] an ass on the full of a mule. He comes
[56:51] riding in into Jerusalem and he
[56:54] fulfilled the very scripture to a tea.
[56:57] But yet it was only a handful that
[57:00] actually recognize the word was being
[57:03] fulfilled in their day. You see, you've
[57:06] got to understand scripture for your day
[57:09] in order to recognize what God is doing.
[57:12] Amen. Praise God. And so here I want to
[57:14] read a quote here from the uh
[57:18] um from uh Ephesians church age. It says
[57:22] a few moments ago I mentioned that John
[57:25] understood what it was to love God. Now
[57:28] we're looking at John here. So so just
[57:31] bear this in mind as this is all from
[57:33] from this point on. Bear in mind that
[57:36] we're that we're looking at John very
[57:38] closely and we're seeing how we relate
[57:40] to John and how we actually type John in
[57:43] this love dispensation. And he says here
[57:46] now he says I mentioned that John
[57:48] understood what it was to love God. That
[57:50] great apostle of love would certainly
[57:54] see when the church began to lose that
[57:57] first love of God.
[57:59] Let me tell you, if there's anything
[58:02] that that's happened in the churches
[58:05] today, they've lost their actual first
[58:09] love for God. And John was able to
[58:13] recognize that. And I know you could
[58:15] have recognized that before you come to
[58:17] this message.
[58:19] You saw that the that the world was was
[58:21] falling apart. If there listen, we're in
[58:24] a love dispensation, but yet the world
[58:26] is a million miles away from love.
[58:28] There's more separation and war and and
[58:31] and division than there's ever been.
[58:35] Amen. And so John recognized it. You're
[58:39] going to recognize it.
[58:41] And he says here in 53, 1953, do you
[58:45] believe? Do you now believe? He says,
[58:46] now St. John, you say, brother Brandham,
[58:49] you sure read a lot out of St. John. He
[58:52] says, it's one of my favorites. John is
[58:55] a book of love.
[58:58] So John is a very uh significant
[59:02] apostle. Amen. We can see that John not
[59:06] only types the bride but also types the
[59:09] dispensation that we're living in
[59:11] because John was the youngest of the
[59:14] apostles and he was the one who wrote
[59:17] the book of revelation. Amen. He was the
[59:20] one that was given the revelation of the
[59:22] end time. He was the one that that that
[59:25] was caught up and and given the the the
[59:28] mysteries of the word. He had a special
[59:31] relationship with the Lord. You're going
[59:32] to see here. He was the youngest apostle
[59:35] and he's mentioned several times as we
[59:37] will see as we read certain scriptures
[59:40] as the one who Jesus loved. Yes, sir.
[59:43] You're going to see that over and over.
[59:46] His epistles are the epistles of love.
[59:49] In all John's books, he's constantly
[59:51] telling us, "Love one another." The
[59:55] entire book of Revelation is a book of
[59:59] God's love being revealed in symbol
[1:00:02] form. It is the revelation of Jesus
[1:00:06] Christ. Amen. And who receives the
[1:00:09] entire revelation of Jesus Christ? John.
[1:00:13] And who is John? He's an end time
[1:00:16] writer. Yeah, he's an He gets caught up
[1:00:19] into the spirit. He gets He He gets
[1:00:22] called to come up hither and see all
[1:00:25] that was going to take place in this
[1:00:27] age. Amen. In this end time age. Amen.
[1:00:31] Praise God. And his anointing is an
[1:00:35] eagle anointing as we're going to see.
[1:00:38] Now here now I'll read the next quote
[1:00:40] here from the invisible union of the
[1:00:42] bride of Christ.
[1:00:44] You're the virtuous bride of Christ,
[1:00:46] washed in the blood of Christ, precious,
[1:00:50] virtuous, sinless son of God, standing
[1:00:53] with a pure, unadulterated bride word
[1:00:56] that he washed uh by the water of his
[1:01:00] own blood. It's his spirit that purged
[1:01:03] you. It's his blood that cleanses you.
[1:01:07] And you're ver listen, you're spotless.
[1:01:10] you your sin has been wiped away like it
[1:01:14] had never happened in the first place.
[1:01:16] That's what that's what he's done for
[1:01:18] you. Amen. That become flesh and
[1:01:21] manifested that he might take you which
[1:01:24] were
[1:01:25] predestinated in his bosom in the bosom
[1:01:29] of the father before the beginning
[1:01:32] before the foundations of the world. The
[1:01:35] same as he
[1:01:37] was. He was that great attribute of God
[1:01:42] called love. Jesus is love. God is love.
[1:01:48] When you're talking about Jesus, you're
[1:01:50] talking about God. We're not talking
[1:01:52] about three in one here. We're talking
[1:01:54] about the same person. Amen. When John
[1:01:57] looked upon the throne, when he was
[1:01:59] brought up and caught up into into the
[1:02:01] heavenly spirit, he looked upon the
[1:02:03] throne and he saw one that was seated
[1:02:07] upon the throne. Amen. He that was, he
[1:02:10] that is, and he that is to come. Amen.
[1:02:13] Glory to God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. So,
[1:02:17] all the
[1:02:18] virtues he goes on to say here. Now,
[1:02:20] listen, let's go to the next slide. Now,
[1:02:24] this is a this is a familiar uh slide.
[1:02:27] And, you know, I'm going to put it up
[1:02:28] here as I expound a little bit on John
[1:02:30] and and and uh how we type John in the
[1:02:33] book of Revelation. But we can see here,
[1:02:36] you can see that very top capstone. It's
[1:02:39] called grace love because it is the
[1:02:43] grace of God that you've been called
[1:02:46] into the love of God. Amen. Praise God.
[1:02:50] And he said, and when when we read here
[1:02:53] from this um quote, he said, "The same
[1:02:57] as he was, we are the same as he was. We
[1:03:02] were we were from his bosom. We're not a
[1:03:05] different
[1:03:06] material. You're not the person that you
[1:03:09] think you are. The real you is an
[1:03:12] attribute of God. You're just using this
[1:03:14] body in the human realm that we're
[1:03:16] living in. But the real you is actually
[1:03:19] a part of God. You are a messiah. You
[1:03:22] are actually a a a son or a daughter of
[1:03:26] God. And if you are a son or a daughter,
[1:03:28] then you come from God.
[1:03:30] Amen. And here we see that we are as he
[1:03:35] was an attribute of love. And so can you
[1:03:38] see what we are a part of as the bride?
[1:03:42] We are God's love to this end time
[1:03:46] generation.
[1:03:48] And if they're going to receive God's
[1:03:51] love, they're going to need to know the
[1:03:54] spirit that dwelleth in you because
[1:03:57] it'll quicken their mortal bodies. It'll
[1:04:00] bring the last one, the last son or
[1:04:03] daughter of God, wherever they are, they
[1:04:05] will need to hear this message. Amen.
[1:04:09] The whole plan of redemption is an
[1:04:12] expression of his love. In Revelations 1
[1:04:16] verse one, it says, "The revelation of
[1:04:19] Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him to
[1:04:23] show unto his servant, his servants,
[1:04:27] things which must shortly come to pass.
[1:04:30] And he sent and signified it by his
[1:04:33] angel unto his servant John."
[1:04:37] You know, when you read that scripture,
[1:04:39] who was the angel that was sent to John
[1:04:42] as a type in our day? Amen. Being the
[1:04:45] bride. Amen. God sent us an angel. God
[1:04:49] sent us Malachi 4:5. God sent William,
[1:04:53] Mary, and Branham anointed under the
[1:04:55] ministry of the seventh church age
[1:04:58] messenger to bring a word that was going
[1:05:01] to transform and bring us back to the
[1:05:04] original faith. Amen. was going to open
[1:05:06] up all the mysteries of God. Amen.
[1:05:09] Praise God. And in chapter 4, John is
[1:05:12] told to come up hither to be shown what
[1:05:16] must come to pass in the church. And so
[1:05:19] that is a type in in chapter 4, uh God
[1:05:23] is calling John right after the seven
[1:05:25] church ages. And you see the seven
[1:05:27] church ages here on the on the side.
[1:05:30] Ephesians, Samia, Pergamus, Titus,
[1:05:33] Sardis, Philadelphia, Leodysa, and
[1:05:36] you'll see that there's a gap there.
[1:05:37] We've passed over that gap. Now, we're
[1:05:40] in the grace dispensation age. It's the
[1:05:43] eternal age. It's where the mighty angel
[1:05:45] himself. It's where Christ himself comes
[1:05:48] to possess and become flesh again in you
[1:05:54] to take on bone of your bone, flesh of
[1:05:57] your flesh to possess you to to to
[1:05:59] anoint you to to speak this word in
[1:06:03] human flesh. Amen. Praise God. And so
[1:06:06] here we see that um when John gets
[1:06:10] caught up into this uh uh dimension in
[1:06:14] in
[1:06:15] Revelation 4, remember he sees he sees
[1:06:19] this great throne and and and what he
[1:06:23] sees there he sees uh surrounding the
[1:06:25] throne four creatures. Yes, sir. And one
[1:06:28] of them was was the face of a lion. The
[1:06:31] other was the face of an ox. The other
[1:06:33] was a face of a man. The other was the
[1:06:35] face of an eagle. Now, brother Brandham
[1:06:38] told us that these, he says, now listen
[1:06:41] to what he says here in the breach. He
[1:06:42] says, "Now remember the lion and the ox
[1:06:45] and so forth ahead of a man and so forth
[1:06:48] and then watching those seraraphims that
[1:06:50] word while all Mark, Matthew, Luke, and
[1:06:54] John all stood around the book of Acts."
[1:06:57] He was telling us that those four
[1:07:00] creatures
[1:07:01] represented Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
[1:07:04] John. Amen. And they were they were
[1:07:07] around the throne. They were they were
[1:07:09] not guarding the throne. They were they
[1:07:12] were actually if you look at Matthew,
[1:07:14] Mark, Luke, and John, because brother
[1:07:16] Brandon makes reference here to the book
[1:07:17] of Acts. Before you can get to the book
[1:07:20] of Acts, you've got to go through
[1:07:22] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Amen. And
[1:07:24] when you look at all four of these
[1:07:27] apostles, you will see the anointing
[1:07:29] that was on each and of of these
[1:07:32] apostles. And I want to draw your
[1:07:34] attention. The first one was the line of
[1:07:36] the tribe of Judah. And look, Matthew,
[1:07:39] what is he? He's he's all about the
[1:07:41] coming of the king. He brings the
[1:07:42] lineage of Jesus Christ right in the
[1:07:45] opening of his scriptures, the tribe of
[1:07:47] Judah. Gives the genealogy all the way
[1:07:49] back to Adam. Then look at Mark. It's
[1:07:52] the the ox anointing. It's all about the
[1:07:54] lamb of God who takes away the sins of
[1:07:56] the world. All these anointings. I'm
[1:07:58] just laying in a foundation here. And
[1:08:00] then Luke, he had the man anointing.
[1:08:03] Luke, you see when he starts, oh, great
[1:08:05] Theophilus, you know, he starts to
[1:08:07] expound. He has the the the the
[1:08:09] understanding the of the man age where
[1:08:13] where we entered into the to the
[1:08:15] missionary age and it and it opened up
[1:08:17] and started the reformation of the
[1:08:19] church. But the one that I want to you
[1:08:21] to particularly pay attention to is
[1:08:24] John. Because John, he was the one that
[1:08:28] represented the eagle. He had an eagle
[1:08:31] anointing on him. He had a prophetic
[1:08:33] anointing on him. Amen. And the age that
[1:08:36] he came that that that that and that the
[1:08:39] messenger came in our day, William
[1:08:41] Brandham came under that eagle anointing
[1:08:45] and dispensation that was given and
[1:08:49] shown to John.
[1:08:51] Amen. And so we can see now the bride,
[1:08:55] she's under that anointing.
[1:08:58] We represent the eagle anointing. The
[1:09:01] same anointing that was on John is on
[1:09:03] the bride. You are going to be able to
[1:09:06] see things in the word of God that other
[1:09:08] people will not be able to see. An eagle
[1:09:11] goes way, way up and when he looks down,
[1:09:14] he sees a lot more. You've been given
[1:09:17] eagle vision in this hour to recognize
[1:09:19] what God is doing in this hour. You've
[1:09:22] been anointed for this portion of the
[1:09:25] word of God. And that's what you can't
[1:09:27] help but see it. You're going to see it.
[1:09:30] Amen. So these four beasts surrounded
[1:09:33] the throne of God and they and they and
[1:09:35] and and what do they guard? Matthew,
[1:09:37] Mark, Luke, and John, the Holy Spirit.
[1:09:40] Remember, they were they were they were
[1:09:42] surrounding the throne, which is God.
[1:09:46] When we talk about the Holy Spirit,
[1:09:48] we're talking about God. Jesus Christ.
[1:09:50] God, the one that was on the throne,
[1:09:52] Jesus Christ. Amen. Who is he? God.
[1:09:56] Amen. We're not talking keep make sure
[1:09:59] you you don't get confused. Don't get
[1:10:00] that trinitarian spirit on you now.
[1:10:03] Amen. He saw one on the throne. Here he
[1:10:06] Israel, the Lord thy God is one.
[1:10:10] You will not listen. The mysteries were
[1:10:13] being preached. William Brham was
[1:10:16] preaching these mysteries uh in
[1:10:21] 1956. The serpent seed mystery.
[1:10:25] You would not have understood why it is
[1:10:27] that you can see what you're seeing
[1:10:29] right now had you not seen the the the
[1:10:33] the serpent seed mystery of iniquity
[1:10:36] that had gotten into the church and
[1:10:38] realized that there's two seeds that are
[1:10:40] in in the church.
[1:10:43] And without that mystery being revealed,
[1:10:46] it was it was all under those seals.
[1:10:50] But yet they were being revealed for a
[1:10:53] purpose so that so that you could
[1:10:55] recognize the time and the season and
[1:10:58] why you're not serpent seed.
[1:11:03] Why adultery is destroying families
[1:11:06] these days. It's not an
[1:11:08] apple. You understood the godhead. You
[1:11:12] understood the things of baptism in
[1:11:14] Jesus name. It made perfect sense when
[1:11:16] you understood the godhead. Yes, sir.
[1:11:19] But why is it that 95% of the Christian
[1:11:22] churches out there are trinitarian and
[1:11:24] believe in baptism in the name of the
[1:11:27] father and of the son and of the holy
[1:11:28] spirit because they haven't received
[1:11:31] Malachi 4:5.
[1:11:34] He's the one that turned the hearts of
[1:11:35] the children back to the original faith
[1:11:38] of God's word. And without that, you've
[1:11:41] got no foundation. You're in a state of
[1:11:43] confusion. You're just a church member.
[1:11:46] You're just going to church. you're just
[1:11:48] doing traditions of man. You'll go and
[1:11:50] nail yourself to the cross thinking that
[1:11:52] that's going to get you into heaven.
[1:11:54] You'll go and do a thousand Hail Marys
[1:11:56] and a and a hundred our fathers thinking
[1:11:58] that that if you do the rosary every
[1:12:01] single day that's going to get you into
[1:12:02] heaven.
[1:12:04] You don't you you need the foundation of
[1:12:07] this word. You need to understand the
[1:12:09] the the very essence of the of the
[1:12:12] scripture which is the Holy Ghost. And
[1:12:14] he said, "I will send him unto you. He
[1:12:18] will guide you into all truth."
[1:12:22] So without the Holy Ghost, you're going
[1:12:23] to be in a state of confusion. Amen.
[1:12:26] Praise God. Now, Revelation Now, when we
[1:12:30] go to Revelations chapter 5, okay, we're
[1:12:33] going to move quickly here. In
[1:12:35] Revelation chapter 5, I'm going to read
[1:12:37] it and then I'm just going to expound a
[1:12:38] little bit on it because I'm not going
[1:12:40] to get into all the depths. When I was
[1:12:42] when I was doing all of this study, I
[1:12:44] had to I had so many notes that I was
[1:12:47] pulling out of everything and I said,
[1:12:50] "My God, I can't there's no way I can
[1:12:52] put this all into one message. It's
[1:12:54] going to be like two or three." So, I'm
[1:12:56] just going to I I'm just going to stick
[1:12:58] to my notes here and if you pull God
[1:13:02] will give you what you need while we're
[1:13:04] while we're preaching the word of God.
[1:13:06] Amen. I believe in the in in the power
[1:13:08] of God to to to speak and to minister to
[1:13:11] the needs of the people through the
[1:13:13] five-fold ministry under the anointing.
[1:13:15] Amen. And I feel his anointing. Now, in
[1:13:18] Revelations 5, I saw in the right hand
[1:13:21] of him that sat on the throne a book
[1:13:24] written within and on the backside
[1:13:26] sealed with seven seals. And I saw a
[1:13:29] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:13:31] voice, "Who is worthy to open the book
[1:13:33] and to loose the seals thereof?" Yes.
[1:13:36] And no man in heaven nor in earth,
[1:13:38] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:13:41] the book, neither to look thereon. And I
[1:13:44] wept much. John was weeping a lot. He
[1:13:49] was screaming. Why? John, remember, he
[1:13:52] was the one that got caught up. He was
[1:13:55] the one that that was was given
[1:13:57] revelation that that uh that that opened
[1:14:01] his understanding to what was actually
[1:14:04] going on. He come to realize that there
[1:14:06] was that that his name was in that book.
[1:14:10] He realized what that book was. And that
[1:14:13] book there's only one way that we would
[1:14:16] be reconciled and our inheritance would
[1:14:18] be would be fulfilled was for that book
[1:14:20] to be open. And he was starting to weep
[1:14:23] and cry because he saw the book in the
[1:14:26] in the hand. But he realized he heard
[1:14:28] nobody worthy in heaven on earth. Nobody
[1:14:31] was worthy. And it put him into a state
[1:14:33] of utter uh panic. But here now listen
[1:14:37] on. And I wept much be because no man
[1:14:40] was found worthy to open or even to read
[1:14:42] neither to look onto this book. And one
[1:14:46] of the elders said unto me, weep not.
[1:14:49] Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[1:14:53] the root of David,
[1:14:56] hath prevailed to open the book, and to
[1:15:00] loose the seven seals thereof.
[1:15:04] Only the lamb could open the book.
[1:15:08] Only Jesus Christ could loose those
[1:15:11] seals. Amen. There was things written
[1:15:14] inside there that that that were going
[1:15:17] to be made known. And we know, brother
[1:15:20] Brandham said that the book contained
[1:15:22] all the names. Amen. Of those that were
[1:15:26] the seed of God.
[1:15:28] And John was was was panicking because
[1:15:31] wait a minute here, you know, this was
[1:15:33] the original plan, remember? And when
[1:15:35] when Adam fell and Eve fell in the
[1:15:39] garden, Adam had the book, but he lost
[1:15:42] the book. Brother Bram says that it had
[1:15:43] to go back to the rightful owner. God
[1:15:47] didn't want that book. God wanted it to
[1:15:49] be in the hands of Adam so that he could
[1:15:51] express his plan of fellowship with his
[1:15:55] seed.
[1:15:57] So John was caught up to see all of this
[1:15:59] and he knew that that that this book had
[1:16:02] to be open and there was only one that
[1:16:04] could open the book. Now read on. He
[1:16:06] says here and I beheld and lo in the
[1:16:07] midst of the throne and of the four
[1:16:09] beasts and in the midst of the elders
[1:16:11] stood a lamb as as it had been slain.
[1:16:14] And we know that that is Jesus Christ
[1:16:17] because who is the lamb of God that was
[1:16:19] slain from before the foundations of the
[1:16:22] world? It was Jesus Christ. Remember
[1:16:24] this was all in the mind of God. What we
[1:16:28] have been been uh fulfilling is is the
[1:16:31] the the literal book the inheritance of
[1:16:34] the book the story of your life my life
[1:16:38] Moses's life Abraham's life all the seed
[1:16:42] genes of God from from Genesis all the
[1:16:46] way to the revelation right into the
[1:16:48] millennium.
[1:16:50] It's been all about the the the plan and
[1:16:54] the love story of God. Amen. And so the
[1:16:58] lamb having seven heads uh horns and
[1:17:02] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:17:04] of God sent forth into all the earth.
[1:17:07] And he came and he took the book out of
[1:17:10] the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:17:12] throne. Now how does how does somebody
[1:17:16] go and take a book right out of the hand
[1:17:19] of God? Amen. You need to understand
[1:17:21] that was Jesus Christ changing his
[1:17:26] his position his his uh he he he was he
[1:17:30] was playing the next part. He was coming
[1:17:33] to he was reconciling the world to
[1:17:36] himself.
[1:17:38] It was God himself that went and took
[1:17:40] that book and went to the cross. It was
[1:17:43] the lamb of God. It was not somebody
[1:17:45] else. It was God himself. He was just
[1:17:49] going from the self-existent one that
[1:17:52] sat upon the throne into the office of
[1:17:54] the lamb because he had to leave the
[1:17:57] throne because he needed to come and get
[1:18:00] you,
[1:18:02] get me, redeem and call the inheritance
[1:18:06] that was written within the book. So
[1:18:08] only the lamb which is Jesus Christ can
[1:18:11] loose the seals.
[1:18:13] And in chapter 6, John is showed by
[1:18:16] vision all the mysteries that were
[1:18:18] sealed under each of those first six
[1:18:21] seals. Six and seven. Chapters six and
[1:18:25] seven. And in Revelations chapter 8,
[1:18:28] when the seventh seal is open, all we
[1:18:30] hear is that there was a half hour of
[1:18:32] silence in heaven. So all the sounds
[1:18:36] stopped.
[1:18:37] All the all the rejoicing stopped. all
[1:18:40] the because they were rejoicing that the
[1:18:42] lamb had taken the book. But then all of
[1:18:45] a sudden when the seventh seal was open,
[1:18:48] John said there was silence for half an
[1:18:50] hour. Why? Because the lamb had left the
[1:18:53] throne. The lamb had come down to the
[1:18:57] earth. And the next time we see the lamb
[1:18:59] is in Revelations 10 1-7. And now not
[1:19:03] only does he have the book in his hand,
[1:19:05] but he's got an open book.
[1:19:08] He's got a book that's been open and he
[1:19:10] was the only one that could open the
[1:19:12] book. Amen. And God had a scripture that
[1:19:14] needed to be fulfilled. And this is
[1:19:16] where we come in. This is where the the
[1:19:19] the the love dispensation comes in. When
[1:19:22] the head came to meet with the body, it
[1:19:26] was grace. It was love that was coming
[1:19:29] down. It was the mighty angel himself,
[1:19:32] the head coming to meet with the body.
[1:19:34] Amen. Praise God. So there was a half an
[1:19:37] hour of silence and it's not until
[1:19:39] Revelations 10:1-7 that the mighty angel
[1:19:42] now appears and and it's an earthly
[1:19:45] angel that has to meet him to receive
[1:19:48] the message to re to to to preach those
[1:19:52] seals. And who was that earthly angel?
[1:19:55] William Branham.
[1:19:58] Glory to God. and and and in 1963, March
[1:20:02] of 1963, he preaches the opening of
[1:20:05] those seven seals. And it was the most
[1:20:08] supernatural time the prophet said, if
[1:20:11] there's ever been a time and he was the
[1:20:14] angel just like John who would get
[1:20:17] caught up one day at a time and he would
[1:20:20] see, literally see the vision of each
[1:20:23] one of those seals when they were open.
[1:20:25] He was given the mysteries to understand
[1:20:28] what was under those seals. And John is
[1:20:31] a type of the church. So you can expect
[1:20:33] to recognize what was under those seals.
[1:20:36] You can you you can be under expectation
[1:20:38] that you're going to receive the same
[1:20:40] revelation that John received and you're
[1:20:43] going to one day hear the same thing
[1:20:45] that John heard which was come up
[1:20:47] hither. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:20:50] So here we go. Now the prophet preaches
[1:20:54] the opening of those seals. He says the
[1:20:56] book, the Bible has become a completely
[1:20:59] new Bible.
[1:21:02] Why?
[1:21:04] Because it's a dispensational change.
[1:21:08] We're no longer under the seven church
[1:21:11] ages anymore.
[1:21:13] We're under an eternal age.
[1:21:16] We should know. this church should know
[1:21:19] more than anybody else because we had we
[1:21:22] had a minister our pas our former pastor
[1:21:24] who was one of those that caught the
[1:21:26] revelation like John. We had a John
[1:21:29] Hallelujah that caught the same
[1:21:31] revelation that John had that was one of
[1:21:34] the front runners of the dispensational
[1:21:37] changes preaching messages right in the
[1:21:39] beginning. Have you received the Holy
[1:21:41] Ghost since you believed? Listen, I'll
[1:21:44] tell you something. You need to receive
[1:21:46] the Holy Ghost in this hour. There's a
[1:21:50] dispensational change. And if you go
[1:21:52] back to Joshua chapter 5, you will see
[1:21:55] that the children of Israel, they had to
[1:21:57] be re they had to be circumcised because
[1:21:59] the ones that had come through the
[1:22:01] 40-year wilderness, they had all died
[1:22:04] and in their unbelief.
[1:22:06] But the ones that were going to cross
[1:22:07] over had to be recircumcised. And you
[1:22:10] will see, read it in there. I'm not
[1:22:11] going to go back and read it, but you go
[1:22:13] read Joshua chapter 5. Right in the
[1:22:15] beginning, he says they need to bear the
[1:22:17] reproach. They they they need to be the
[1:22:20] the the reproach needs to be lifted off
[1:22:22] of them. They need to receive the spirit
[1:22:25] of God in order to cross into this
[1:22:27] promised land. Because this promised
[1:22:30] land, it's not for everybody. It's for
[1:22:33] the attribute sons and daughters of God
[1:22:36] that are called under this dispensation
[1:22:39] of love. Amen. Amen. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:22:43] Amen. And we thank God for that
[1:22:45] prophetic ministry.
[1:22:48] Oh my. Praise God. The prophet though is
[1:22:51] no longer on the scene. But the same
[1:22:54] spirit that raised Christ from the dead,
[1:22:57] he's still on the scene. He's still with
[1:23:01] us here this morning. Amen. He's still
[1:23:03] right here present. And the sons and
[1:23:05] daughters of God are still out there.
[1:23:08] and they need eagle food.
[1:23:11] They need to come under that eagle
[1:23:12] anointing. And there's some out there
[1:23:15] that are still waiting on the
[1:23:17] bridegroom's call. Amen. Listen to this.
[1:23:19] Go to the next slide here. In the me in
[1:23:22] the in the message of Shane
[1:23:24] uh uh William Brandham says, "Dear God,
[1:23:28] we see the h the handwriting on the
[1:23:30] wall. Lord, we're at the end time. We
[1:23:33] know that there is great things laying
[1:23:35] ahead. Oh, glory. There's a rapture
[1:23:37] laying ahead. saints. But yet somewhere
[1:23:40] somewhere out in this mess out here is
[1:23:44] still an honest people that's been
[1:23:46] ordained to life. It would be impossible
[1:23:49] for one man or two men but God. All of
[1:23:54] us together. God, all of us together,
[1:23:59] the body of Christ. Let us spread in
[1:24:02] every corner we can the good news that
[1:24:05] Jesus is coming. and see just spread a
[1:24:08] little bread along a little word. Next
[1:24:11] slide. He says, "Wherever the eagles
[1:24:14] are, they'll follow that food."
[1:24:18] What food? This food. Yes, sir. Whether
[1:24:21] it comes by a
[1:24:23] tape, hallelujah. Or whether it comes by
[1:24:26] a word or a testimony.
[1:24:29] I don't know. But you got a testimony of
[1:24:31] what God has done for you. Then that
[1:24:33] testimony is anointed. If you are an
[1:24:36] attribute of God, glory to God, he says,
[1:24:39] "Eags will follow it to its
[1:24:41] headquarters." Right back to the word.
[1:24:44] She will not go back to a doctrine
[1:24:46] teaching. No sir. He says, "Where the
[1:24:49] carcass is, there the eagles will
[1:24:51] gather." Dear Jesus, we know that thou
[1:24:54] art the carcass that we eat. Yes, sir.
[1:24:57] Thou art the word. And the word was made
[1:24:59] flesh and dwelt among us. We pray God
[1:25:02] that as we scatter the word that the
[1:25:05] true eagles will find it.
[1:25:08] Are there some eagles out there? Are
[1:25:10] there some eagles out there anointed
[1:25:13] with a prophetic spirit upon their lives
[1:25:15] to recognize what God is doing in our
[1:25:18] day? Amen. Glory to God. Thank you,
[1:25:22] Jesus. Listen here. We're winding this.
[1:25:26] We're we're going to we're getting
[1:25:28] there. Hallelujah. So, let's now now
[1:25:31] we're going to go to St. John chapter
[1:25:33] 13. And I want you to keep in mind here
[1:25:35] because we're looking at John here.
[1:25:37] Remember, it's John that caught all of
[1:25:39] this. It's it's it's John. It's the
[1:25:41] eagle anointing that's upon you in this
[1:25:44] hour. You are a type of John. You're the
[1:25:46] you're you're the one that Jesus loves.
[1:25:48] God, listen, he's got a church that he
[1:25:50] loves. He says if if if you're a part of
[1:25:54] God, then then then God is love. And if
[1:25:57] you are a part of God, then you are
[1:25:59] love. You become God's love, God's
[1:26:02] expression, God's witness, God's
[1:26:04] identification in this hour. Amen. And
[1:26:07] so, let's go to our next slide, which is
[1:26:11] St. John 13:es
[1:26:14] 21-23.
[1:26:16] Now, remember, bear in mind, John is the
[1:26:20] one that represents and types the bride.
[1:26:24] He's a type of the church, the end time
[1:26:25] bride. Amen. As we look at these
[1:26:28] scriptures, I want you to notice how it
[1:26:30] pertains to John. And remember, it
[1:26:32] pertains in the same way to you. So when
[1:26:35] Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in
[1:26:38] spirit and testified and said, "Verily,
[1:26:41] verily, I say unto you, that one of you
[1:26:44] shall betray me." Then the disciples
[1:26:47] looked one on another, doubting of whom
[1:26:50] he spake.
[1:26:52] Now there was leaning on Jesus his on
[1:26:56] Jesus bosom one of his disciples whom
[1:27:00] Jesus loved.
[1:27:03] Pay attention. Next slide. Simon Peter
[1:27:07] therefore beckoned to him to John that
[1:27:11] he should ask who it should be of whom
[1:27:14] he spake. He then lying on Jesus' breast
[1:27:18] saith unto him, Lord, who is it? John
[1:27:21] asking Jesus, he's lying on his
[1:27:24] breast. Can you
[1:27:27] imagine? Here's God on
[1:27:29] earth. And John was there just, you
[1:27:33] know, leaning on Jesus' breast and he
[1:27:36] just looks up. He says, "Lord, who are
[1:27:39] you talking about?" And Jesus right away
[1:27:42] says, "He it is to whom I shall give sap
[1:27:45] when I have dipped it." And when he had
[1:27:48] dipped the soap, he gave it to Judas
[1:27:50] Escarias, the son of
[1:27:53] Simon. Now, here we are reading from the
[1:27:56] book of John. John is the one that
[1:27:59] receives the secret, the revelation of
[1:28:03] who the antichrist that was right there
[1:28:05] in the midst of the church. Amen. And
[1:28:08] you as the as the called out sons and
[1:28:12] daughters of God under that same eagle
[1:28:14] anointing, having recognized the prophet
[1:28:16] of Malachi 4:5 and that you now have
[1:28:20] Elisha's mantle upon
[1:28:23] you, the prophet went off the scene, but
[1:28:25] the spirit like Elisha and Elijah, you
[1:28:28] now have a double portion of that eagle
[1:28:31] anointing, that prophetic ministry all
[1:28:34] over your life.
[1:28:36] And you now are the one that Jesus is
[1:28:38] revealing his secrets to. You're the one
[1:28:42] that's catching the revelation of who
[1:28:46] the Antichrist is. And we know that by
[1:28:49] the prophet's messages and you go back
[1:28:52] and study them, you will see that he
[1:28:54] exposes exactly what the mark of the
[1:28:56] beast is, who the antichrist spirit is,
[1:28:59] how it's going to rise up in these last
[1:29:01] days, how it's already moving into its
[1:29:04] full authority and power. Amen. But we
[1:29:06] just we we we just we're not going to
[1:29:09] get into all that right now. We're just
[1:29:10] going to finish up here the thought that
[1:29:12] the Lord has laid upon upon my heart.
[1:29:15] Amen. So Peter, Peter was there with
[1:29:18] with Jesus, but Peter, he represented
[1:29:21] more faith. But John, he was the one
[1:29:24] that Jesus loved. He was the one that
[1:29:27] would get the secrets of Jesus. He would
[1:29:29] be the one that would uh that that the
[1:29:31] Lord would speak to, that would unveil
[1:29:33] himself to, that would give him the
[1:29:35] mysteries of what exactly. Because if
[1:29:38] you read all of John's writings, you'll
[1:29:41] see that he receives a lot more
[1:29:43] revelation than the rest of those that
[1:29:46] were the disciples amongst
[1:29:50] him. And so he was showing them the
[1:29:53] antichrist. The bride in this hour gets
[1:29:56] a complete understanding of that. Amen.
[1:29:58] The antichrist was right in the church.
[1:30:01] But John, a type of the bride, is given
[1:30:03] the revelation of him. But the others
[1:30:05] didn't know. They probably saw Judas get
[1:30:07] up and leave and figure, oh, he's just
[1:30:09] going off to do something. You know,
[1:30:11] he's he handles the money, so he must be
[1:30:13] going to make a, you know, something, do
[1:30:15] something. But they didn't recognize
[1:30:18] because it was only John that had that
[1:30:22] close love relationship with the Lord
[1:30:25] Jesus. God has a church in this hour
[1:30:28] that he's in love with and they are in
[1:30:31] love with him. And because of that love
[1:30:35] relationship, he's he's unveiling
[1:30:37] himself. This is love. This is real
[1:30:40] love. When you can when you can enter
[1:30:42] into the Holy Spirit in prayer and then
[1:30:45] he comes and he reveals his thoughts to
[1:30:48] you, unveils his secrets and his
[1:30:50] mysteries to you. Amen. You are the one
[1:30:52] that he loves because John because Jesus
[1:30:55] loved John. He got the secrets. John
[1:30:57] gets the name of the antichrist. He's
[1:31:00] listen then look if you go into John 12
[1:31:04] he gets the he he expounds the very name
[1:31:06] then saith one of his disciples in John
[1:31:09] 12:4 Judas Escariat Simon's son which
[1:31:13] should betray him John actually knew who
[1:31:18] what his name was you go back and read
[1:31:20] the other gospels you won't see that
[1:31:23] it's in John's gospels where he receives
[1:31:26] the revelation of the secrets of the
[1:31:29] things that God is going to do in the
[1:31:31] end time. Amen. Glory to God. Why?
[1:31:34] Because he had an eagle prophetic
[1:31:36] anointing and was given the revelation.
[1:31:39] Amen. Glory to God. This is a special
[1:31:42] relationship. You're the one he loves.
[1:31:45] If you're seeing what you're what what
[1:31:47] we're ministering here this morning and
[1:31:49] today, it's because you're one of his
[1:31:51] loved ones. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:31:55] Can you see it? Can you identify
[1:31:57] yourself with John? Let's go here. Let's
[1:32:00] read on here. Next quote. In Christ, the
[1:32:02] mystery of God revealed. Listen what he
[1:32:03] says. But God's great mystery. What the
[1:32:06] eternal God had as a mystery has now
[1:32:10] been unfolded in Jesus Christ. Then
[1:32:13] given down to who? The church. It's
[1:32:17] being unfolded. The great mystery of God
[1:32:19] has always been God becoming flesh.
[1:32:23] Right?
[1:32:25] That's the great mystery. Yes. He wants
[1:32:27] to become flesh in you.
[1:32:30] He wants you to know though. That's why
[1:32:32] he said on that day ye shall know.
[1:32:35] People will read that scripture but they
[1:32:37] don't know but you shall know. Amen. He
[1:32:41] says it come right down to his church.
[1:32:44] What was once in God's mind is now in
[1:32:47] the body of Christ. And who is the body
[1:32:50] of Christ? The church. the church of the
[1:32:53] end time. Amen. Jesus making love to the
[1:32:57] church, his bride whispering secrets to
[1:33:00] her. Amen. He says, "You know, you know
[1:33:03] how you tell your wife things? You know
[1:33:05] the little girl you're going to marry,
[1:33:07] you love her so much, you just tell her
[1:33:09] secrets and get her get her up next to
[1:33:12] you and love you and everything." You
[1:33:14] know how it is. That's what God Christ
[1:33:17] is doing to the church.
[1:33:19] He's letting her know the secrets. Just
[1:33:22] the secrets. Not these flurers, not
[1:33:25] these ones that are out there. They
[1:33:27] claim Christianity. You ask them about
[1:33:29] baptism and they they say, "I was
[1:33:31] baptized as a baby. I don't need to be
[1:33:33] rebaptized." You know, and they'll tell
[1:33:35] you, "Oh, Jesus Christ is there's three
[1:33:37] in
[1:33:39] one." There's no revelation of who God
[1:33:43] actually is. Amen. because he has not
[1:33:46] revealed himself to them personally. I
[1:33:51] mean his wife. That's who he's talking
[1:33:53] about. See? All right. Now look. No. By
[1:33:56] having the revelation of his secret made
[1:33:59] known to them by his grace. How? The
[1:34:03] grace of God.
[1:34:05] Glory to God. Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:34:10] So, the bride is the one that receives
[1:34:12] the opening of those seals. The bride is
[1:34:15] the one that receives all the secrets.
[1:34:17] The mysteries are revealed to her
[1:34:19] because he loves her because he's his
[1:34:23] choice. She's a part of him. He could
[1:34:26] not go anywhere else. He has to go to
[1:34:30] those whose names were written in that
[1:34:33] book.
[1:34:34] That book is now open and it's being
[1:34:37] declared and the names are being called.
[1:34:39] Amen. Praise God. That's another message
[1:34:42] all in itself.
[1:34:43] John was the youngest. He was the one
[1:34:45] who lived the longest. He was the one
[1:34:47] who saw the beginning to the end. And
[1:34:50] you have been given the mind of God, the
[1:34:53] mind of Christ, to go right back into
[1:34:55] the mind of God from before the
[1:34:57] foundations of the world to see all that
[1:34:59] God had in his mind. Lord, we preach it
[1:35:03] all the time. In the beginning was the
[1:35:05] word, and the word was with God, and the
[1:35:07] word was God. Amen. Glory to God. And
[1:35:11] God allows you to see the beginning to
[1:35:14] the
[1:35:15] end. A type of
[1:35:18] John. Glory to God. Here we go. Next
[1:35:22] scripture. We're winding her. The first
[1:35:24] day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene
[1:35:27] early when it was yet dark unto the
[1:35:30] suppler, and seeth the stone taken away
[1:35:33] from the supplr. Then she runth and
[1:35:35] cometh to Simon Peter and to the other
[1:35:37] disciples whom Jesus and to the other
[1:35:40] disciple whom Jesus loved. There it is
[1:35:43] again. Who was that other disciple that
[1:35:46] was always with Peter? John.
[1:35:49] And saith unto them, they have taken
[1:35:52] away the Lord out of the supplr and we
[1:35:54] know not where they have laid him. Peter
[1:35:57] therefore went forth and that other
[1:36:00] disciple. It's amazing how it sits there
[1:36:03] and you know like we've never seen it
[1:36:04] really before like this and came to the
[1:36:08] supplr. Go to the next
[1:36:11] slide. So they ran both together and the
[1:36:15] other disciple John did outrun Peter and
[1:36:20] came first to the suppler. You see
[1:36:23] listen when when when you catch a
[1:36:25] revelation of this word you you want to
[1:36:28] you want to you're you're just zealous.
[1:36:30] You're like a house on fire. You know,
[1:36:32] you know God is up to something, man. I
[1:36:34] can't wait to get there. I just can't
[1:36:36] wait to get to see what to see what the
[1:36:39] Lord told me. He told me what was going
[1:36:41] to happen. He told me he was going to
[1:36:43] rise again. He told me he was going to
[1:36:45] come for me. Oh yes, she he had a
[1:36:47] revelation. He was zealous. He ran there
[1:36:49] first. And he stooping down and looking
[1:36:52] in saw the linen clothes lying. Yet went
[1:36:55] he not in.
[1:36:57] Then cometh Simon Peter following him,
[1:37:01] and went into the supplr, and seeth the
[1:37:03] linen clothes lie, and the napkin that
[1:37:06] was about his head, not lying with the
[1:37:08] linen clothes, but wrapped together in a
[1:37:10] place by itself. And then he went in
[1:37:14] also that other disciple, there's John
[1:37:17] again. He went back in now, which came
[1:37:20] first to the
[1:37:21] suppler, and he saw, and he believed.
[1:37:25] Hallelujah.
[1:37:27] For as yet they knew not the scripture
[1:37:30] that he must rise again from the dead.
[1:37:32] The others that had that that had come
[1:37:34] that had seen. They didn't understand
[1:37:37] the scripture. It wasn't open to them
[1:37:39] that he's risen. But John, he believed.
[1:37:43] Why did he believe? Because it was
[1:37:45] revealed to him. Because he had a
[1:37:47] revelation of the resurrection. He knew
[1:37:50] that he was now resurrected in Christ.
[1:37:53] He knew that this was this was a reality
[1:37:55] that God's word had come to pass. Amen.
[1:37:59] Glory to God. So here now he says uh um
[1:38:03] in in uh Revelation, let's go to the
[1:38:05] next
[1:38:06] slide. We're going to read a couple of
[1:38:08] scriptures. Now we're going to go back
[1:38:09] to Revelations chapter 4 and we're going
[1:38:11] to close here. After this, I looked and
[1:38:14] behold, a door was opened in heaven. And
[1:38:18] the first voice which I heard was as it
[1:38:20] were a trumpet talking with me, which
[1:38:23] said, "Come up hither." And we know that
[1:38:25] this is a type of the bride being called
[1:38:29] into the rapture. And I will show thee
[1:38:31] things what's which must be hereafter.
[1:38:34] And immediately I was in the spirit. And
[1:38:37] behold, a throne was set in heaven. And
[1:38:40] how many sat on the throne? One. Glory
[1:38:43] to God. Amen. Praise God. Now next
[1:38:48] slide in in uh
[1:38:52] Revelation
[1:38:53] uh chapter 4 he says and there was a
[1:38:58] living creature what John
[1:39:01] represented the entire church was taken
[1:39:06] up. I told you one person here in a
[1:39:10] vision can represent the entire body of
[1:39:14] Jesus Christ.
[1:39:17] Who does John type?
[1:39:19] The bride.
[1:39:21] Who got caught up after the seven church
[1:39:24] ages and went into a rapture? The bride.
[1:39:28] Amen. Because why? Because she's the one
[1:39:32] that he loves. Next quote. He goes on
[1:39:35] and oh, and notice John being take up
[1:39:38] immediately after the church age was a
[1:39:41] type of the raptured church. Immediately
[1:39:45] after the church age is over, this
[1:39:47] Leodysian age, then comes the rapture.
[1:39:52] The church goes up like John did into
[1:39:55] the presence of God. Amen. And the next
[1:40:00] slide says, he and his church has gone
[1:40:03] to glory. John there on the aisle of
[1:40:07] Patmos, a revelator to the church, has
[1:40:10] been a type of the church which is
[1:40:13] lifted up into glory. Let the musicians
[1:40:16] come. Come up hither showing you say he
[1:40:20] represented the church. To everyone that
[1:40:24] hears this word, this message, John
[1:40:29] represents him. John represents you.
[1:40:34] John represents you. You're the one that
[1:40:36] that's going to get called in the
[1:40:39] rapture that's going to receive that
[1:40:40] body change that's going to receive the
[1:40:43] word that says come up hither. John was
[1:40:45] a representation of the blood of Jesus
[1:40:48] Christ, a testimony of the word. He was
[1:40:51] a witness of the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:53] Ghost with a p personal fellowship with
[1:40:57] Christ. And he represented the
[1:41:01] entire church.
[1:41:04] What hour are we living in,
[1:41:07] saints? Here we have an end time
[1:41:11] message that has turned our hearts back
[1:41:14] to the word that has given us a
[1:41:17] revelation
[1:41:19] of the mighty angel who has come down to
[1:41:25] possess and to call and to make claim.
[1:41:29] He paid the price. The lamb took the
[1:41:33] book. He was a bleeding lamb. Why was he
[1:41:36] a bleeding lamb? Because he had made the
[1:41:38] sacrifice.
[1:41:40] He had already given and made the
[1:41:42] sacrifice. Now he has a right to take
[1:41:44] that book. And within that book is the
[1:41:48] names of every one of the sons and
[1:41:51] daughters of God that are going to be
[1:41:53] called in this last day. And he had a
[1:41:56] right to take that book. And my God, we
[1:42:00] could move on here and continue on, but
[1:42:02] when when when in Revelations 10 verse 8
[1:42:06] to 11, the angel tells John to go and
[1:42:11] take the open book.
[1:42:14] He says, "You now go and take the book
[1:42:18] out of the hand of the Lord Jesus."
[1:42:21] How can you take anything from the Lord
[1:42:23] Jesus?
[1:42:25] is because you are a part of the Lord
[1:42:27] Jesus. You are his wife. You are the one
[1:42:31] that's that has the same the the same
[1:42:34] authority as Listen, when a husband and
[1:42:36] a wife get married and they go to the
[1:42:38] altar and they sign the marriage
[1:42:41] certificate, the husband and the wife
[1:42:43] become
[1:42:44] equal. She takes his name. She has the
[1:42:48] authority to use his name. She has the
[1:42:51] right to use his name. She's got the
[1:42:54] same authority that he has. Amen. And
[1:42:56] that's what the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:42:58] has. She has the same authority to take
[1:43:01] the book and to eat the book and then
[1:43:05] she's going to prophesy what's in the
[1:43:07] book. She's not going to say something
[1:43:10] different. Remember everything that was
[1:43:13] in that book, Brother Bram says, was all
[1:43:15] the names of the sons and daughters of
[1:43:18] God. And so what is the prophecy? What
[1:43:22] is it that we
[1:43:23] prophesy? We're prophesying and we're
[1:43:26] speaking the word that pertains to this
[1:43:29] day that's being fulfilled in our day.
[1:43:32] And if your name is written in that
[1:43:34] book, then you are going to hear that
[1:43:37] word. You're going to recognize that
[1:43:39] that's your name being called to come
[1:43:42] and actually fulfill the portion of the
[1:43:47] word that was ordained for this day and
[1:43:49] for this hour.
[1:43:52] You can't help it. It's your name being
[1:43:55] called. And by you recognizing your
[1:43:58] name, it's giving you the faith to live
[1:44:00] this word. To recognize what God is
[1:44:03] doing in this hour. It shows that your
[1:44:05] name's in there. When you can identify
[1:44:07] with it, you can say, "My name's in the
[1:44:10] book." Amen. Because I hear what's being
[1:44:13] spoken. I hear what's being preached. I
[1:44:16] am resurrected. I'm already in Christ
[1:44:19] Jesus. I am his flesh. I am his body. I
[1:44:23] am I am filled with his blood which is
[1:44:26] the spirit of God. And whatever listen
[1:44:30] the Bible says in
[1:44:32] Revelations 21 I believe it is the
[1:44:35] spirit and the bride say come. That is
[1:44:40] the bride prophesying again. That's her
[1:44:43] with this message, with the spirit of
[1:44:46] God upon her, speaking the word, calling
[1:44:49] the resurrection, calling sons and
[1:44:51] daughters of God out of their tradition,
[1:44:53] calling them out of their bondage,
[1:44:56] calling them out of their mental
[1:44:58] illness, calling them out of their
[1:45:00] condition of poverty, poverty spirit,
[1:45:04] you know, uh, defeated spirits. He says,
[1:45:06] "Come up hither. Amen. You don't have to
[1:45:10] stay in that condition anymore. Let's
[1:45:13] sing that song. If the same spirit that
[1:45:15] raised Christ from the dead, hallelujah.
[1:45:17] Praise our God forever
[1:45:20] more. If the same spirit that raised
[1:45:25] Christ from the dead dwell in you. Let's
[1:45:29] all stand. Dwell in you.
[1:45:32] Oh, it's the same spirit that is
[1:45:36] [Music]

[1:50:15] Yeah.
[1:50:23] [Music]
[1:50:25] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:46] [Music]
[1:50:47] Amen. Praise God. You got the proof of
[1:50:52] the resurrection in you now. Praise God.
[1:50:58] Go out and live it. Go out and testify.
[1:51:01] Go out and let the people know what God
[1:51:03] is doing in this day and in this hour.
[1:51:05] Amen. Those that are ordained to hear
[1:51:08] it, they can't miss it because the eagle
[1:51:11] anointing is upon their lives. It's upon
[1:51:14] that attribute. It's the age that we're
[1:51:16] in. It's it's And listen,
[1:51:19] remember, love them.
[1:51:22] Let it be with
[1:51:23] love. You could prophesy. You could do
[1:51:26] all kinds of things, but if it's not
[1:51:27] done with with charity, which is his
[1:51:30] love, it it it it profits nothing.
[1:51:34] You can't make somebody what they're
[1:51:37] not. Remember that. If you're an eagle,
[1:51:40] you were always an eagle. If you're a
[1:51:42] son or a daughter of God, your name was
[1:51:44] written in the Lamb's Book of Life when
[1:51:47] before. So, don't be trying to drive
[1:51:49] this down somebody's throat. But when
[1:51:52] somebody wants to keep going with you
[1:51:55] back and forth and they're willing to
[1:51:57] reason and they're willing to, you know,
[1:52:00] uh, discuss the scriptures and go back
[1:52:03] and forth with let that's God dealing
[1:52:05] with their lives. That's God causing
[1:52:08] something to stir up on the inside for
[1:52:10] that seed for all the tradition and all
[1:52:13] the the the generational things and all
[1:52:16] the the the the teachings of men and uh
[1:52:18] that's been put upon their lives. Just
[1:52:21] share the gospel with them with the love
[1:52:23] of God. Hallelujah. Let them know that
[1:52:26] God's love is going to override their
[1:52:29] mistakes. Usually, you'll find, listen,
[1:52:32] go back and look at your own experience.
[1:52:34] God came to you when you were at the
[1:52:37] bottom. You were at a point of no
[1:52:40] return. You didn't know. I know there's
[1:52:42] a lot of young people that were born and
[1:52:44] brought up into this message, but you're
[1:52:46] going to have to receive the same birth
[1:52:48] that every one of us received.
[1:52:52] So, don't look just because you didn't
[1:52:54] have a a really negative experience or
[1:52:56] something like that. There's something
[1:52:58] that has to awaken inside of you. It's
[1:53:01] not going to be based on an experience
[1:53:03] of negativity. But, but most of us, we
[1:53:06] come to a place, even if it's just
[1:53:07] within ourselves, to say, "I don't even
[1:53:09] know who I am. I don't understand why
[1:53:12] I'm here. I don't understand why I've
[1:53:14] come to this earth. What's my purpose
[1:53:16] for being here? Why is it that people
[1:53:18] are rejoicing and I and I feel
[1:53:21] miserable? I feel uh oppressed. I'm not
[1:53:24] happy. I'm not satisfied. That that was
[1:53:27] me 30 years ago. And I had to use drugs
[1:53:30] in order to satisfy the thirst that was
[1:53:33] in me to be satisfied. And every son and
[1:53:37] daughter of God needs to be satisfied.
[1:53:41] And there's only one thing that's going
[1:53:42] to satisfy that attribute of God, and
[1:53:45] that's him.
[1:53:47] Glory to God. So just go out, love your
[1:53:50] families, love your friends, be with
[1:53:53] them, share with them the gospel, pray
[1:53:55] with them. I had a friend of mine that
[1:53:57] was driving by here yesterday, you know,
[1:54:00] just he was driving. He saw my truck in
[1:54:01] the in the in the parking lot while I
[1:54:03] was here studying. He he he he texts me.
[1:54:06] He said, "Hey, I'm outside." I said,
[1:54:07] "Hey, come on in." You know, actually,
[1:54:08] he he text me as he was going by. He
[1:54:11] says, "Hey, can I pick you up
[1:54:12] something?" I said, "Yeah, actually, can
[1:54:14] you pick me up a biscuit?" You know, I
[1:54:15] was kind of hungry. He picked it up. He
[1:54:17] came back here. We sat down. We chatted
[1:54:18] for a while. And I noticed the way he
[1:54:20] was walking. He was walking a little
[1:54:21] funny. I said, "What's what's up?" He
[1:54:23] says, "Oh, I got a problem with my
[1:54:24] back." I said, "Can I pray for you?"
[1:54:26] Well, yeah. I said, "Sit down. Let's
[1:54:29] pray."
[1:54:31] He didn't experience that before.
[1:54:34] But let's see what the Lord is going to
[1:54:36] do.
[1:54:37] I don't have to tell
[1:54:39] him tell I just just
[1:54:42] just be who you are.
[1:54:45] Let God's love be expressed in in who
[1:54:48] you are. Be yourself. Don't put on
[1:54:50] nothing. Amen. Glory to God. Praise God.
[1:54:53] Let's pray. Father,
[1:54:55] we just so appreciate you, Lord, that
[1:54:57] you're you're you're just amongst common
[1:55:01] people, Lord. And it's just the grace of
[1:55:03] God that we can say, "Lord, thank you.
[1:55:06] We love you." And we know why. It's
[1:55:08] because you first loved us.
[1:55:11] No other explanation. Father, you came
[1:55:15] to
[1:55:17] me. I wasn't looking for you. You came
[1:55:20] to me. Thank you, Jesus. Lord, it's it's
[1:55:23] just beyond human understanding. This
[1:55:26] love, it is beyond human understanding.
[1:55:29] Father,
[1:55:30] Lord, we're just asking you that Lord,
[1:55:32] you know every heart, every need, every
[1:55:34] life, Lord, those that are even out on
[1:55:37] on the uh YouTube that have listened
[1:55:40] into this message, Father, I pray for
[1:55:42] them, Lord. I pray that you will meet
[1:55:43] them, that somehow your love and your
[1:55:46] anointing will sweep over their lives
[1:55:48] and and change will take place. Lord,
[1:55:51] they will know that there is a God, that
[1:55:53] there is a living God that's
[1:55:55] resurrected. That's what Easter was all
[1:55:58] about. That you would come back and
[1:56:01] touch your people. Oh God, you so love
[1:56:04] the world that you gave yourself.
[1:56:06] Father, Lord, we love you. We thank you.
[1:56:09] We praise you. Lord, remember the
[1:56:12] upcoming services this Wednesday, Lord,
[1:56:15] next Sunday, Lord, all the services that
[1:56:18] are that are coming up. Father, may you
[1:56:21] just uh come on the scene, Lord, and let
[1:56:24] the same spirit just continue to move in
[1:56:27] our midst. Oh God, you are the same
[1:56:28] yesterday, today, and
[1:56:31] forever. Protect us, watch over us, and
[1:56:34] guide us. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[1:56:36] name. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now,
[1:56:39] just so you know, um for the next month,
[1:56:43] I will not be ministering services
[1:56:47] because I will be um still transitioning
[1:56:51] with the business. You got to
[1:56:52] understand, I couldn't just walk away.
[1:56:55] It's a multi-million dollar business. I
[1:56:57] could not just walk away um and just
[1:57:01] place it into, you know, somebody else's
[1:57:03] hands. So, there's a transition that's
[1:57:05] happening and I I'm asking for your
[1:57:08] prayer that you'll pray for me through
[1:57:11] this next four weeks. You're in good
[1:57:14] hands. You've got you've got good uh
[1:57:18] capable brothers that are going to
[1:57:19] minister the word of God. Our former
[1:57:21] pastor is going to take a couple of the
[1:57:23] services. You're going to be blessed.
[1:57:25] Amen. And if I can be here on those
[1:57:27] Sundays, I will. I'm I'm you'll probably
[1:57:31] see me, but I just won't have the energy
[1:57:35] that I want to give to preparing and and
[1:57:38] and setting myself aside to, you know,
[1:57:40] to put uh, you know, and and consecrate
[1:57:42] and get from the Lord what what you all
[1:57:45] have need of. But I know that you're in
[1:57:47] capable hands. And I know that God will
[1:57:49] provide. And I know that we're all going
[1:57:51] to get blessed. Amen. Praise God.
[1:57:54] Because it's him we feed on. He's the
[1:57:57] one that we feed on. Praise God. So, God
[1:58:00] bless you. Have a wonderful Sunday. Go
[1:58:03] and fellowship and have your beautiful
[1:58:05] Easter meals with your beautiful
[1:58:07] families. Love them. Appreciate them.
[1:58:09] Let them know about what the what God's
[1:58:12] love has done for them. Amen. God bless
[1:58:14] you. I'm going to hand it over to you,
[1:58:16] Brother Anthony.
[1:58:18] [Music]
[1:58:25] Praise God. Let's give God an applause.
[1:58:28] Amen.
[1:58:33] So just a reminder that next Sunday you
[1:58:36] have a general
[1:58:38] meeting. So it's for the tight paying
[1:58:41] members. So after the service you're all
[1:58:44] going to go out and have a little
[1:58:45] refreshment and then after like 10 15
[1:58:48] minutes all the tight payment people are
