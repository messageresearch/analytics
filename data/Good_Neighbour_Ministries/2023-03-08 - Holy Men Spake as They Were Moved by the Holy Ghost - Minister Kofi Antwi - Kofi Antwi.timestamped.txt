[23:14] amen
[23:16] thanks be to the Lord
[23:24] [Music]
[23:27] may the Lord bless every one of you
[23:30] and
[23:32] I don't take much time
[23:35] because
[23:38] the word
[23:40] is good
[23:43] God is good and the word that he giveth
[23:46] to us is good
[23:48] so we have to deliver the word
[23:50] we don't have to waste time
[23:53] so I greet every one of you in the name
[23:56] of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I
[23:59] greet our pastor and those that are
[24:02] watching on the line I greet every one
[24:05] of you in the name of the Lord
[24:08] we go straight to the word because
[24:11] Christ is our
[24:14] motive everything that we do without him
[24:18] it means nothing but with him all things
[24:22] are possible
[24:23] so let's go through the word straight to
[24:25] the word first we will read the
[24:28] scripture right or at the back Hebrews
[24:31] 13 age and we will read
[24:35] uh
[24:37] first I think first Peter first sorry
[24:42] second Peter 1 20.
[24:45] and
[24:46] uh Brothers one would you pray for us
[24:54] yes Lord
[25:01] yes Lord
[25:13] yes in Jesus name
[25:17] amen
[25:18] okay so Hebrews
[25:21] first we will read the Hebrews
[25:24] 13 verse 8 it says Jesus Christ the same
[25:27] yesterday and today and forever
[25:32] that's right at the back of the
[25:35] the church there you can see it and even
[25:38] you can see it back there to First a
[25:41] second period
[25:42] 120
[25:44] goes no knowing this face that no
[25:48] Prophecy of the scripture is of any
[25:52] private interpretation
[25:56] for the prophecy come not in all time by
[26:01] the will of man but holy men of God
[26:05] speak as they were moved by the Holy
[26:09] Ghost may the Lord add his Blessing
[26:12] please be seated
[26:18] the scripture that we just read
[26:23] right
[26:26] God
[26:28] has already interpret his own scripture
[26:34] because
[26:36] remember
[26:38] we all know children of God we come to
[26:41] the World by the seed of God
[26:45] so if the seed of God is in you then you
[26:49] are predestinated for that day that you
[26:52] are in this world
[26:54] because when God revealed the world to
[26:57] you that you are his son or daughter
[27:00] that means you are the scripture that
[27:04] have to be made manifest God cannot go
[27:07] nowhere
[27:08] but goes to his elect
[27:13] God can goes nowhere but to the elect
[27:18] and it doesn't matter whether you were
[27:21] dedicated on educated or it doesn't
[27:24] matter how they you are born to even a
[27:28] bad family or good family or good
[27:31] educated family or uneducated family
[27:35] once you are predestinated
[27:38] by God
[27:40] God cannot go nowhere but comes to you
[27:45] because
[27:47] the scripture has tell us plainly
[27:51] the holy man thank you brother
[27:55] the holy man they were moved by the Holy
[27:58] Ghost
[28:00] because God's children are elect
[28:04] and once you are elect
[28:07] you are the word that have to be made
[28:09] flesh
[28:12] it doesn't matter how you think how you
[28:15] feel how family you born to Once God has
[28:19] elected you
[28:21] he saw you before the foundations of
[28:24] this world that's why he sent you here
[28:27] then that means you are the word that
[28:30] has made flesh
[28:35] because
[28:37] that make God
[28:40] as he said the scripture said Jesus
[28:43] Christ the same yesterday today and
[28:46] forever
[28:48] because the denomination is not of God
[28:54] is of mermaid interpretation
[28:58] man tried to take the word of God the
[29:02] letter
[29:03] that's why the Bible says the letter
[29:05] kill it
[29:06] but the spirit gave life
[29:09] because God's children
[29:12] we are we have the seed already in US
[29:16] it's not your father or church or
[29:19] anybody give you the seed
[29:21] is God that give the seed
[29:24] amen and if he is here he cannot give
[29:27] you the sea today he has is something he
[29:30] has already done
[29:32] he has already done it
[29:35] so it doesn't matter what happens to you
[29:39] your end your future is clear
[29:43] it's perfect
[29:46] that's why the Bible says the children
[29:48] of God does not sin because of the seed
[29:51] of God like brother Daniel was preaching
[29:53] he says when once
[29:58] the word has opened to you
[30:00] so much that the Bible become a new
[30:03] Bible then the devil attack
[30:07] he saw attack you so much that you
[30:10] wanted to even he want you to like give
[30:13] up but let me tell you don't give up
[30:19] if Satan is attacking you don't give up
[30:23] because God is in control
[30:25] Jesus
[30:27] says my sheep hear my voice a stranger
[30:32] won't follow
[30:34] we are the seed of God
[30:37] we are the ones that are predestinated
[30:40] that's why Satan sometimes would like to
[30:44] take you to a corner bombard your mind
[30:47] bombard your family bombard any any
[30:51] enemies he will use to attack you he
[30:54] wanted to use to attack him sometimes he
[30:57] will bring sickness he will tell you oh
[31:01] you are not good he will accuse you is
[31:04] because of the seed but don't worry when
[31:07] you see like that rejoice
[31:10] separate the flesh
[31:13] and look to the seed of God in you that
[31:18] God says who you are
[31:20] and many try to take your heart all your
[31:25] mind everything and focus on the seed of
[31:29] God in you what God has done that bring
[31:32] God on the same because otherwise you
[31:36] will be always depressed oppressed
[31:39] because the enemy attack
[31:43] he will attack you
[31:45] in so many ways brothers and sisters let
[31:48] me tell you for the past some weeks I've
[31:52] gone through some tries bombardment of
[31:55] the devil bombarding me left and right
[31:59] bombarding me bombarding me in this even
[32:02] like today since I'm coming here I'm
[32:05] struggling I'm struggling I'm struggling
[32:08] why because
[32:10] but I know who I am
[32:13] I know what God has done
[32:16] it doesn't matter the Bible says the
[32:18] righteous man falls seven times he rise
[32:21] up seven times is something that is done
[32:24] already
[32:26] it's not something will be done if
[32:29] something is finished product Christ has
[32:33] done it
[32:34] and I'm standing on that no matter how
[32:38] he accused me or try me let me fall ten
[32:42] thousand times Christ will raise me 10
[32:45] 000 times and so is you
[32:49] recognize that the enemy can turn you
[32:53] back because Christ has done it it's a
[32:58] finished product
[32:59] because let me tell you that's why you
[33:03] are sitting here that's why you come
[33:05] here because when the prophet came let
[33:09] me tell you Satan attacked him so much
[33:12] he attacked him he attacked his wife he
[33:15] attacked his children attack the
[33:18] ministry attack him you remember when he
[33:21] went to Chicago
[33:23] 400 false prophet what do you think they
[33:26] were doing those were they were coming
[33:29] to attack him but God
[33:32] was there
[33:34] God was standing beside the prophet
[33:37] those were devils in flesh coming to
[33:41] attack the word
[33:43] and so is it today they may not come
[33:47] physically Sometimes they come by
[33:49] thought sometimes you come by
[33:53] standing there a beast you see him you
[33:56] say oh this man or this sister or this
[33:59] woman let me tell you once he speaks and
[34:03] it's not the word it's not of God it's
[34:06] the devil it's not him or her but look
[34:11] at the motive behind it because Jesus
[34:15] Christ when he was here Satan attacked
[34:19] him he said it is written it is written
[34:23] he used the word to do what to defeat
[34:26] Satan so let us lose the word that has
[34:29] he has fortified in our soul to defeat
[34:33] the enemy
[34:35] if you do like that
[34:37] Satan can never torment you no matter
[34:41] how he torments you he know that you are
[34:45] not gonna give up you're not gonna
[34:48] surrender to him his straights his ways
[34:52] brothers and sisters we know the hour is
[34:56] late
[34:56] we know Ukraine one look at Russia look
[35:02] at China I was listening China is
[35:05] increasing his military budget why is he
[35:09] doing that he's preparing for the third
[35:11] world war let me tell you get yourself
[35:15] ready it's more it's later than what you
[35:19] think
[35:20] it's just like I was talking with
[35:22] brother the best food you like and your
[35:27] mother is cooking the food and you could
[35:29] smell the taste of the food that food
[35:33] hasn't you haven't eaten yet but you are
[35:36] smelling is almost getting ready to come
[35:40] for you to eat that's what the world is
[35:43] that's what the Ted Wallace we are
[35:46] almost home we are almost this world is
[35:50] falling apart that's everything is going
[35:53] chaos is heading towards tribulation
[35:57] is heading towards tribulation look at
[36:00] the economy the money you pay you can do
[36:04] nothing everything is so bankrupt and
[36:08] grew up or whatever you may call it it's
[36:11] all chaos
[36:13] it's all chaos
[36:16] yes sir let me tell you outside looks so
[36:20] nice is just like if you have ever seen
[36:24] in Africa when a cow shake and the Sun
[36:27] Touch It Outside is so hard but by
[36:32] accident your footstep in you will see
[36:35] just go right inside
[36:37] he knows what I'm talking about
[36:40] the inside is so soft but the surface is
[36:44] so hot that is the world right now it
[36:48] looks so grammar and soap duty but let
[36:51] me tell you everything is headed towards
[36:54] disaster so let us fortify ourselves
[36:58] once the word says the holy man
[37:01] were moved by the Holy Ghost
[37:04] sisters brothers it is you and I that
[37:09] the Holy Spirit has come to it is you
[37:12] and I that Christ
[37:15] has revealed himself to let me tell you
[37:19] since we came here there are so many
[37:22] people that has come here but inside
[37:25] them something is wrong they've gone
[37:29] back to the world they've gone back to
[37:32] Saturn but we who
[37:35] we were thinking we were grasshoppers
[37:37] some of us we were thinking we were
[37:39] nobody Now by God's grace
[37:43] we see ourselves
[37:45] his grace is shining upon us his grace
[37:49] is let us know who we are that we are
[37:53] not just grasshoppers that we are his
[37:56] bride do you like the chosen one
[38:01] oh my the one that the Bible says the
[38:06] holy man the holy Sisters You Are Holy
[38:10] sister okay Sisters You Are Holy sisters
[38:14] so the word of God has to come to you I
[38:17] don't care what you think you may think
[38:20] you are not good you do this God doesn't
[38:23] care about that he looked to his seed in
[38:27] you that's why you you could come here
[38:31] Brothers the same thing it's not the
[38:34] work of righteousness
[38:36] it's not how much you know
[38:38] not how much you can even cut brother
[38:41] Abraham let me tell you this is Christ
[38:45] himself
[38:47] has done it he sent a prophet to us and
[38:51] the prophet is gone but Christ is here
[38:56] Christ is here the bride that the the
[39:00] wife of Christ his messenger is the Lord
[39:04] Jesus Christ himself
[39:06] we rely on him
[39:09] we lean on him we rest on him
[39:13] in him all things are possible
[39:18] in him we live in him I breathe you
[39:21] breathe in him you walk you work you go
[39:26] to work and come
[39:27] through him all things are possible when
[39:32] he swear to Abraham he didn't let
[39:35] Abraham swear to him he swear by himself
[39:39] and he has said
[39:43] I will not lose one of my children and
[39:48] if you are one of his children let me
[39:52] tell you
[39:53] you can never be lost your name is
[39:56] written in the palm of his hand who can
[39:59] take you he has spoken
[40:03] the Lord has spoken
[40:05] who can challenge him
[40:07] when God speak normal
[40:11] nobody
[40:12] let me tell you Christ is the answer we
[40:17] live in the hour when God
[40:19] is revealed to us so much
[40:23] different ways of God revealing things
[40:27] that were hidden in his mind that even
[40:32] that the prophets
[40:34] all of them didn't know because the
[40:37] Bible says the least in the kingdom of
[40:39] God is greater than John's about this
[40:43] don't you know you are greater than
[40:45] gender about this because God has
[40:48] revealed place that even prophets they
[40:52] didn't know but you know
[40:55] because God has done it for you he has
[40:59] healed all those things the prophet is
[41:01] not in part but you the least in the
[41:06] kingdom of God
[41:07] you are the greatest
[41:10] God has made you like that he has poured
[41:14] his Spirit everything that was in God he
[41:18] pour into Christ everything that was in
[41:21] Christ where did he pour to the wife
[41:25] every man
[41:27] let me tell you
[41:29] as brother Dan is sitting here
[41:32] let me tell you
[41:34] I thank you
[41:36] okay sorry it's okay
[41:38] as brother Dan is sitting here you think
[41:41] he wants his wife to suffer
[41:43] you think he will leave his wife for
[41:46] some man to come and speak some nonsense
[41:48] to his wife you will see how he blow
[41:51] that man away and Christ is jealous of
[41:55] you
[41:56] His Eye Is Watching Over You 24 hours
[42:00] whatever you think
[42:02] that Christ is not there he's dead
[42:05] he's dead
[42:07] no matter how weak you think you are no
[42:11] matter how soft you think you are even
[42:13] if you are not thinking about him
[42:15] yesterday
[42:17] he's still there
[42:19] because once his seed is in you and he
[42:23] know that this world once you come here
[42:27] the enemy will attack because of what
[42:31] our mother is dead
[42:33] our mother is commit adultery with a
[42:35] serpent so we were all in spiritual
[42:39] amnesia
[42:40] so Christ know that that's why he came
[42:44] back here to redeem us
[42:46] to die for us to share his blood now he
[42:52] has redeemed us even though this flesh
[42:55] torment us this is your enemy it's not
[42:58] your brother not your sister your number
[43:01] one enemy is your flesh me coffee my
[43:06] number one enemy that I fight I struggle
[43:09] I he accused me 24 hours is my flesh I
[43:15] wanna get him out but I don't know how
[43:17] to but let me tell you Christ
[43:20] by his grace
[43:22] I don't care how much he accused me I'm
[43:26] gonna still believe the word because the
[43:29] word in my soul
[43:30] says I'm perfect
[43:33] the word in your soul said you are
[43:36] perfect
[43:37] it's time we realize who we are because
[43:41] the word has come to us the word
[43:44] couldn't go nowhere
[43:46] in the days of marriage where do you
[43:49] think the angel Gabriel will go
[43:51] we'll go to there were so many womans
[43:54] girls virgins
[43:57] in Bethlehem but not all of them God
[44:02] didn't choose them there are so many
[44:05] churches denominations
[44:07] they claim their virgins
[44:10] even though they can be virgin how much
[44:12] they want God will never choose them he
[44:17] chose Mary he chose you you are married
[44:23] today
[44:24] you are married today the world has come
[44:28] to you
[44:30] by his grace
[44:32] not by the will of man not by the will
[44:35] of church not even by the will of
[44:39] yourself
[44:40] is by the will of God
[44:46] set free
[44:48] you are free indeed
[44:51] let me tell you
[44:53] a lot of people think
[44:55] that brother Abraham did it no he didn't
[45:01] do it it was Christ
[45:04] otherwise brother Brown could have ran
[45:06] away
[45:07] could have even commit suicide
[45:10] one time he want to commit suicide who
[45:13] hurry towards Christ
[45:16] wasn't him
[45:18] the seals he didn't break it towards
[45:22] Christ that broke the serving seal it
[45:25] was Christ that gave him the word
[45:28] everything he did was Christ
[45:31] and the bride everything we will
[45:34] accomplish is Christ
[45:38] we cannot do it without him
[45:41] I come to realize that that I myself
[45:45] can't do nothing without him I can't do
[45:48] nothing
[45:50] let me tell you
[45:51] if I leave it to myself I'll be just
[45:55] like a pig in a pic and yacht
[46:00] and so is you let Christ take control
[46:04] full of you
[46:06] let Christ suck your soul
[46:09] so that everything he have for you
[46:13] you will accomplish it
[46:15] but it's not easy
[46:17] it will be thicker in your mouth
[46:20] but better in your belly because you
[46:23] know why
[46:24] to walk with Christ is not easy walk
[46:28] like us Brothers Desmond was saying
[46:31] let me tell you sometimes
[46:33] it gonna cost you
[46:35] so many things
[46:37] so many prices
[46:40] sometimes let me tell you it will even
[46:44] put you in a sick bag you say me yes
[46:48] sit back because God wanna get Glory
[46:51] over there
[46:52] sometime even we have to die
[46:56] so that God will gather Glory
[46:59] be up right you have to pay price
[47:02] because our brothers and sisters that
[47:05] came first didn't get it easy
[47:09] Paul one time they have to pass him
[47:12] through window
[47:14] on basket for him to go and preach the
[47:17] gospel you can you know it's all in the
[47:20] scripture
[47:22] right sometimes you are going to get
[47:24] frustrated
[47:26] sometimes
[47:29] oh my husband and wife
[47:33] you fight one another like hyenas
[47:39] like you don't do what sometimes I do
[47:43] I do
[47:45] let me tell you
[47:47] I am still here
[47:49] I don't grow I don't be in the sky
[47:52] right
[47:54] sometimes I disagree with certain things
[47:57] and I have to fight with my wife but
[48:00] sometimes God even have to come in and
[48:03] tell me coffee even though you are right
[48:06] but don't do that and sometimes some of
[48:09] you will tell you like that wives
[48:11] husbands
[48:13] because why
[48:15] say why my wife can see this because we
[48:18] are individuals
[48:20] God is dealing with us as individuals
[48:24] so not you say
[48:28] and you see your wife doesn't see
[48:31] and you try to show her the moment you
[48:34] try to show her to bring her to the way
[48:37] you are seeing it it's like a war
[48:41] why are you talking you tried to tell me
[48:44] this this then argument he'll try
[48:48] because she is standing on what God has
[48:52] given to her
[48:55] and sometimes he will be saying things
[48:58] to you
[48:59] and you can see that
[49:03] because it's not for you
[49:06] it's for hello
[49:08] because Gentiles God is dealing with us
[49:11] as individuals
[49:14] so sometimes patient
[49:17] to one another
[49:19] patient
[49:21] to wife patient to husband patient to
[49:25] even our children so many of us
[49:27] sometimes we want our children to be
[49:30] like this oh come to church do this do
[49:33] that no they have to face it for
[49:36] themselves
[49:37] because God have to deal with them as
[49:40] individuals
[49:42] you can give salvation to your child
[49:45] this message a lot of people
[49:48] has bring their kids and their family
[49:51] they try to make it and I said it like a
[49:55] Muslims inshallah I said that last time
[49:59] inshallah because the father go and put
[50:02] his hair in general law inshallah then
[50:05] they send gold then the kids go follow
[50:07] no that doesn't work in God's way
[50:10] God says
[50:12] each and every one and as a matter of
[50:15] fact he says to be in the bed
[50:18] I'll take one and leave one to be in the
[50:21] field I'll take one and leave one father
[50:24] will be against the son the son will be
[50:27] against the Father the wife will be
[50:29] against the husband the husband will be
[50:31] against the wife
[50:34] because you know what we came to this
[50:37] world
[50:39] and because of the spiritual Amnesia we
[50:43] have been mingled with the world
[50:46] which evening for marriages sometimes
[50:49] God have to break it
[50:52] so God is the one that is orchestrating
[50:55] everything
[50:57] he's the one that is bringing the
[50:59] Salvation everything the light won't be
[51:03] deceived
[51:04] right that's why sometimes we try to
[51:08] push it
[51:09] to somebody it doesn't work because it's
[51:13] not for them
[51:15] you'll remember when you came to the
[51:16] message
[51:18] I for instance I took the whole message
[51:21] to my Village
[51:22] telling my mom my uncle everybody I told
[51:27] her if I'm seeing this everybody's
[51:29] supposed to see but the moment you do
[51:31] that you know what you they will think
[51:33] about you you are crazy you are mad
[51:37] you are mad
[51:39] you have gone insane my mommy used to
[51:42] tell me oh my son you have gone insane
[51:45] insanity
[51:47] the whole village everybody oh
[51:50] insane
[51:52] your son has gone insane because why
[51:55] it's not for them
[51:57] it's for me
[51:59] it's not for them it's for you it's not
[52:02] for them all we have to do is to do what
[52:05] pray for them
[52:07] we pray for them if they are God elect
[52:10] God appropriate time you bring them in
[52:14] and it won't be you
[52:16] it won't be me
[52:18] the gospel let me tell you God has said
[52:22] my word will never return unto me voice
[52:26] every word will accomplish what I have
[52:29] spoken
[52:31] if I speak
[52:33] it have to accomplish what I speak
[52:37] because
[52:39] it's the spirit of God
[52:42] pick
[52:44] he knows why he speak
[52:46] but sometimes
[52:49] even though
[52:50] we know too much
[52:52] so we take the word
[52:54] and we go and we just do like this to
[52:57] the people
[52:58] right
[53:00] and it's not the spirit of God speaking
[53:04] but it's you speaking
[53:06] but if God really wants somebody do you
[53:09] know you don't have to do nothing
[53:12] or if God needs somebody you don't have
[53:15] to do nothing
[53:17] just maybe hand a tape
[53:19] or just say brother God love you
[53:23] one word like that
[53:26] that spirit of God leads he catches the
[53:30] person who drag him or her straight to
[53:33] Christ
[53:35] oh
[53:36] why are you drinking
[53:41] it may be all kinds of God knows how to
[53:44] speak to his children
[53:46] but sometimes because we know we have to
[53:48] take the Bible the Bible says this Bible
[53:50] says the Bible says in his Bible we
[53:52] become like a pilot to the people and
[53:55] you see that it become you and them War
[53:59] right but if we leave it to God to do it
[54:03] my brother my sister
[54:06] it's not hard
[54:07] God will do the job
[54:10] brother always says he was going to buy
[54:12] furniture in brother Gabriel
[54:14] oh brother Gabriel the brothers said God
[54:18] bless you
[54:20] that attract him
[54:22] and he's sitting here today
[54:25] right
[54:26] it brought a Gabriel preached to him
[54:28] preach the whole sermon to him
[54:31] no
[54:33] one word
[54:35] God bless you that was the spirit of God
[54:38] listen
[54:40] for him to come in
[54:43] so God is saying we should yield our
[54:47] life
[54:48] because the holy man
[54:50] we are moved by the Holy Ghost
[54:53] so once we yield ourselves to the word
[54:56] that pertain to our life for the day God
[55:01] appropriate time will speak the right
[55:04] word that he wants to the people and the
[55:07] people will come and when they come you
[55:10] yourself will know you have done nothing
[55:14] the same
[55:15] that has damage
[55:18] other than that
[55:20] we can't do anything
[55:23] and the person when he come
[55:26] will after his eyes open
[55:29] then he will realize Jesus Christ
[55:32] the same yesterday today and forever
[55:37] because God does not change
[55:40] when he was here
[55:42] Matthew the apostles some of them he
[55:46] just go he says follow me
[55:48] that one word that spirit of God lives
[55:53] in his mouth
[55:54] because why God word is a spirit
[55:58] when he's released at the right time
[56:02] the person that God is speaking to have
[56:05] to follow he have no choice because the
[56:08] seed is already laying down there God
[56:11] has opened that seat it's like a woman
[56:15] when he got pregnant and the baby is
[56:18] about to come the first thing
[56:21] the water will just burst when the water
[56:25] burst it's time for the baby to do what
[56:28] come out
[56:30] back home our parents where they don't
[56:33] living in the rural area they don't have
[56:36] hospitals are there but when the woman
[56:38] pregnant and the water begin to boss
[56:42] right away they look for any car in that
[56:45] Village to take them rush them to
[56:46] hospital
[56:47] because why that baby is coming
[56:51] they may not educated they may not have
[56:54] scientific machine or whatever but they
[56:57] know one thing
[56:59] once they see that water coming from
[57:02] that woman that is pregnant that baby
[57:05] they have to get other somebody that
[57:08] will deliver the baby because the baby
[57:10] is coming and so is it with God children
[57:14] when the right word who lives in your
[57:18] tongue that appropriate time
[57:21] that word that will lead if it is God
[57:26] word for that hour that seed
[57:29] is coming because that seal is open in
[57:33] the passing heart and is coming to hear
[57:36] his father that's why Jesus said my
[57:39] sheep hear my voice strangers that will
[57:43] never follow
[57:44] all of us sitting here
[57:46] one day you heard that voice and it
[57:50] turned you around
[57:52] I heard that voice I tried to Shake It
[57:55] Up I tried to run I try to go my way
[58:00] many times but brothers and sister no
[58:04] matter how you try to run once you hear
[58:08] that voice
[58:09] they're gonna bring you
[58:11] to where God wants you God who has
[58:15] started the work
[58:16] will finish the work
[58:19] he has chose you call you his elbow no
[58:24] matter how Satan try to attack you
[58:28] no matter how you go even to depression
[58:31] or oppression or even you yourself try
[58:35] to put curse upon you God doesn't care
[58:38] one bit
[58:40] look at Saul
[58:42] Saul and you Saul as example to you
[58:45] sorry if you wanted to kill God's
[58:48] children
[58:49] he went to the witch of Endor place and
[58:53] the winter course Samuel
[58:56] and some were tall Saul says tomorrow
[59:00] you and your son got a time will be with
[59:03] me and where is Saul saw is in God's
[59:07] place because he was a seed of God
[59:10] you are a seed of God no matter what you
[59:14] do
[59:15] God has already
[59:18] finished the work
[59:21] don't lose hope
[59:24] don't give up
[59:27] don't be discouraged be encouraged
[59:32] fortify yourself with the word let the
[59:35] word be your absolute
[59:37] let the word guide you everything
[59:40] because the enemy will leave us like
[59:43] this he will always attack you'll get
[59:46] you one in a corner and think you are
[59:50] nobody
[59:51] you get he will come like a fraud even
[59:55] into the church but the spirit of God
[59:58] will raise up standard and cast him out
[1:00:01] I believe that I know I believe God word
[1:00:05] more than anything
[1:00:07] because when I look at William Abraham
[1:00:09] life
[1:00:10] when I listen to the tape
[1:00:13] I am a man I'm not good in reading so I
[1:00:16] base everything on the tape I listen to
[1:00:19] the tape like I I'm pasting
[1:00:22] the text
[1:00:24] you got to listen to it
[1:00:27] it will help you if you can read it read
[1:00:30] the books wherever the brothers tell you
[1:00:32] really
[1:00:33] he helped you a 45 years old because
[1:00:38] it's not William Brown is the voice of
[1:00:40] God but using William Brown voice
[1:00:43] and speaking
[1:00:45] the voice of God that calling the bride
[1:00:49] if you are not elect then forget it but
[1:00:53] if you are electors
[1:00:55] then you cannot go away with the books
[1:00:58] or the tapes
[1:01:00] a lot of people think
[1:01:02] oh brother Brahm if I don't need a take
[1:01:06] I don't need preachers I don't need the
[1:01:09] books how you gonna go to heaven
[1:01:12] are you gonna go to Christ
[1:01:15] because Christ has chosen the churches
[1:01:18] has turned him down the message that's
[1:01:22] why the whole world is in a chaos
[1:01:25] the church's side chaos
[1:01:28] families are in chaos
[1:01:30] because when the prophet came
[1:01:34] if they were receive the prophet they
[1:01:37] got a prophet reward
[1:01:39] we who have received the prophet we are
[1:01:43] getting the reward of the message
[1:01:47] we are getting the reward of what the
[1:01:49] Bible because it's Christ
[1:01:53] is Christ that was in William Brown
[1:01:56] Abraham
[1:01:58] even though
[1:02:00] the churches they saw the Miracles
[1:02:03] they saw the signs wonders dead rays
[1:02:09] but
[1:02:11] when it came to the word to make
[1:02:13] manifest
[1:02:15] the third pool
[1:02:17] they turned it down
[1:02:20] it was common people
[1:02:22] that held him gladly and who are the
[1:02:25] common people today is you and me
[1:02:28] it's you and me look at the message
[1:02:32] we're sitting here we think we are
[1:02:34] nobody
[1:02:35] we are the Angels
[1:02:37] that the world don't know about
[1:02:40] we are here they're looking in the sky
[1:02:43] looking for angels to investigate there
[1:02:46] is that that danger that they have to
[1:02:48] look is you God has blinded their eye
[1:02:51] they cannot see
[1:02:53] but you and I when I see you I see a
[1:02:57] ghost Angel sitting down
[1:02:59] I'm looking at God's angels that has
[1:03:02] come down here fulfilling God's word I
[1:03:06] am God angel that God has said they're
[1:03:10] going to the Moon shooting ups and down
[1:03:12] and looking for now they want to shoot
[1:03:15] and go to their son or whatever they
[1:03:19] will find nothing brother Abraham says
[1:03:21] they're going to look all over their
[1:03:23] walk they cannot see nothing there they
[1:03:26] think that they are looking for is right
[1:03:28] down here
[1:03:29] right it's you and me God hiding himself
[1:03:34] in Simplicity coming to them you are
[1:03:37] working some are working in the factory
[1:03:39] some are working in business some are
[1:03:43] working
[1:03:44] simple driving trucks some businessmen
[1:03:48] walking and passing them and they don't
[1:03:52] know they are bypassing the god that
[1:03:54] you're looking is now working on the two
[1:03:57] feet in the white form
[1:03:59] walking beside them and sometimes they
[1:04:02] need something I remember one time I was
[1:04:05] going in elevator one lady
[1:04:08] a white lady the elevator just opened
[1:04:12] crowd of people says oh my God
[1:04:15] as soon as he says oh my God I says God
[1:04:18] is here what do you want
[1:04:26] God is right here what do you want oh no
[1:04:29] no no he gets shot and it's true
[1:04:32] God is right here you calling God God is
[1:04:35] right here
[1:04:36] he wanted to answer you not me I am not
[1:04:39] the almighty God but he live in me
[1:04:43] and he wanted to answer you
[1:04:45] simple things people don't really
[1:04:47] recognize it you understand and you are
[1:04:51] walking you sometimes you will see
[1:04:53] they're talking something
[1:04:56] and the thing they are talking is so
[1:04:58] bothering them and you have it's so
[1:05:02] simple to you you have the answer
[1:05:04] but when you give it to them they won't
[1:05:07] take it because you know what they're
[1:05:09] looking at
[1:05:11] a man I'm looking for God
[1:05:15] and that God that they are looking is
[1:05:18] now in his son
[1:05:19] bride form
[1:05:21] wanted to answer them
[1:05:23] they don't want it and some people too
[1:05:27] they come even in the message
[1:05:30] sitting right in the pew
[1:05:33] the message will be preached preach
[1:05:34] preach preach preach preach preach
[1:05:36] preach but they won't open your heart
[1:05:39] they're still looking they'll go home
[1:05:41] pray 24 hours read brought a brown
[1:05:43] message 24 hours but God come in the
[1:05:46] flesh in the pulpit
[1:05:48] different forms
[1:05:50] and talking to them the answer coming
[1:05:54] and they cannot see they don't want that
[1:05:57] they want to just listen to the tapes
[1:06:00] they want to read the books it's good
[1:06:03] but recognizing God is now in the flesh
[1:06:07] in the bright form in the fight for
[1:06:10] ministry right on the pulpit
[1:06:14] talking to you
[1:06:18] you remember in the days of Moses
[1:06:21] Moses was leading the children of Israel
[1:06:24] and the people says
[1:06:26] Moses
[1:06:28] you take too much upon yourself
[1:06:30] we wanted to see God
[1:06:34] Moses all right if you want to see God
[1:06:36] Moses go and he prayed to God God says
[1:06:39] okay let them watch let them clean and
[1:06:42] come and meet me I will come down and
[1:06:44] talk to them
[1:06:46] right they don't want man it's the same
[1:06:48] thing today
[1:06:49] why people don't want checked the true
[1:06:52] church that the power of God let me tell
[1:06:56] you
[1:06:57] me I said it and I said it
[1:07:01] I will never once Pastor Simon preach
[1:07:04] the whole world I won't trade him for no
[1:07:07] preacher
[1:07:08] unless it's gone and let me tell you I'm
[1:07:11] gonna pray for whoever God choose these
[1:07:13] two brothers I'm gonna pray
[1:07:16] I want the same spirit
[1:07:19] to come upon them
[1:07:21] I don't want a hypocrite or hypocrisy
[1:07:24] what mermaid interpretation
[1:07:28] no sir we will never tolerate that
[1:07:32] I'm I'll be gone
[1:07:34] I want to see Christ
[1:07:36] because I know him
[1:07:38] I had met him
[1:07:40] he knows me he knows the way I am
[1:07:44] he has brought me all the way from
[1:07:47] Africa jungle
[1:07:50] and he has revealed himself to me let me
[1:07:53] tell you when I came here I I don't
[1:07:56] believe I was not believing in a
[1:07:58] preachers because I thought they were
[1:08:00] all crooked bunch of snakes vipers they
[1:08:04] want your money
[1:08:05] unless I see God then from you can talk
[1:08:09] how much you want but unless I see
[1:08:13] that's me
[1:08:15] unless I see
[1:08:16] and God revealed Pastor sermon to me
[1:08:20] so let me tell you
[1:08:22] I want God
[1:08:24] I wonder God that was the William
[1:08:26] Abraham
[1:08:27] the god that
[1:08:30] is reality
[1:08:32] a lot of people don't want that
[1:08:35] that's why they go
[1:08:38] to intellectual preacher because he
[1:08:42] preached the cause for them
[1:08:45] and they think the course will lead them
[1:08:46] to Christ
[1:08:48] you need a man that is standing here
[1:08:51] preaching God behind his King
[1:08:55] if God is not the run for your life
[1:08:58] I don't care how much he caught I don't
[1:09:01] care how much he speak that don't mean
[1:09:04] nothing to Kofi Angie let me tell you
[1:09:08] because I'm I don't play with My Soul
[1:09:11] if I my soul is one time
[1:09:15] one time life
[1:09:17] if I may say if I don't go to God I'm
[1:09:21] done so I won't joke it with a man
[1:09:25] I will trust it with Christ
[1:09:28] and so must be you
[1:09:31] a man
[1:09:33] or sister
[1:09:35] this is not we're talking about
[1:09:37] something easy something joke this is
[1:09:41] Ray brother
[1:09:43] this is real
[1:09:46] this is not because I'm coming to church
[1:09:49] here and joke this is between you and
[1:09:53] God
[1:09:54] this is reality
[1:09:56] but Abraham
[1:09:58] he seek God tell he saw him God come to
[1:10:02] him the pillow fire visit him many times
[1:10:07] since we are here rather small sitting
[1:10:09] here
[1:10:12] so many times
[1:10:14] God come down it says my servant follow
[1:10:19] him he will lead you through
[1:10:21] what do you think
[1:10:23] we come here for joke
[1:10:26] come here for Duke then you don't know
[1:10:29] me
[1:10:30] I'm I'm I'm I am very friendly but when
[1:10:34] it comes to God word
[1:10:37] let me tell you I may not know the
[1:10:39] letter much but I know the altar
[1:10:43] you all can make me he came to me
[1:10:46] the author himself
[1:10:48] I used to say until I see him face to
[1:10:51] face and talk with him I'll never
[1:10:54] worship God and I saw him
[1:10:58] I know the God I'm servant
[1:11:03] if people are in the message are serious
[1:11:06] all the preachers false preachers hidden
[1:11:10] in the message they will be detected
[1:11:12] easy
[1:11:15] I'm telling you the truth
[1:11:17] they'll be detected easy they won't get
[1:11:19] nobody to fool
[1:11:21] it's not by intellectual talk will make
[1:11:25] you know God
[1:11:27] see the thing for yourself and the thing
[1:11:31] becomes great to you
[1:11:34] then you are setting
[1:11:36] that's why so many people come in the
[1:11:39] message they backslide and go
[1:11:41] because they themselves haven't met God
[1:11:45] because let me tell you
[1:11:47] you young ones if you are coming here
[1:11:50] because
[1:11:51] you feed him by intellectual or the
[1:11:54] message is good
[1:11:56] let me tell you one day you're gonna
[1:11:57] face some tries
[1:11:59] will shake you to the Rock if you don't
[1:12:04] see for yourself cry out until you know
[1:12:07] that you know
[1:12:10] that's what David says when I walk in
[1:12:13] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[1:12:16] for down with me thy staff they comfort
[1:12:19] me
[1:12:21] David know
[1:12:23] that the god that chosen
[1:12:26] and called him
[1:12:29] you have confidence
[1:12:30] in that God
[1:12:33] you have confidence
[1:12:35] I have confidence in the message
[1:12:38] I have confidence in the Bible
[1:12:41] no matter what
[1:12:44] even if I'm going the grave it's all
[1:12:47] right
[1:12:47] I will not be afraid
[1:12:50] I am so certain of that
[1:12:53] that this is just say the Lord the
[1:12:56] message to my soul what William Brown
[1:12:59] preached what Pastor Samuel has preached
[1:13:02] I know
[1:13:05] is the truth
[1:13:08] I can lay down my life for it
[1:13:11] that is the truth
[1:13:14] it's not a hypocrite
[1:13:18] is so real to me
[1:13:20] the message is sorry
[1:13:25] since I came to this world I never see
[1:13:29] something like this
[1:13:32] this is the true word of God
[1:13:36] this is the absolute
[1:13:39] William Brown is the 20th century
[1:13:41] Prophet the world may not like it
[1:13:45] but he is
[1:13:47] his
[1:13:49] God
[1:13:51] what's in William Brown
[1:13:53] and we who has accept that message
[1:13:57] that God has revealed himself to us let
[1:14:01] us be like soldiers
[1:14:03] not be like chickens I was watching ego
[1:14:08] I was telling brother Philip
[1:14:10] documentary
[1:14:12] do you know that eagle when it's high
[1:14:16] you can see like other five mice to 15
[1:14:19] miles away
[1:14:21] any animal that moved that eagle
[1:14:23] conceively
[1:14:27] never mind he's so high
[1:14:30] he can see that anymore movie if it is
[1:14:34] playing Ground
[1:14:36] and I said wow
[1:14:39] that's why God
[1:14:41] typed his spiritual eager
[1:14:44] he's a bad
[1:14:46] that fly so high
[1:14:49] and still yet just ship to the water and
[1:14:53] come and grab the fish
[1:14:55] why
[1:14:57] God's bright real eagles
[1:15:03] we are not chickens we eat fresh
[1:15:06] crackers
[1:15:08] the carcass is what the flesh word of
[1:15:10] God
[1:15:12] so if you are eager you come here
[1:15:16] and you eat the flesh characters coming
[1:15:18] out from the pullback it come like a
[1:15:21] fire lighting
[1:15:23] but you take it
[1:15:25] cheater in your mouth but bitter in your
[1:15:28] belly because that's what your father
[1:15:31] offered to you
[1:15:33] when Moses when the children of God said
[1:15:36] they want to see God
[1:15:38] Moses
[1:15:39] brought them to God when God was coming
[1:15:43] down
[1:15:43] this has no
[1:15:46] God don't speak to us now speak to Moses
[1:15:50] then your servant will tell us
[1:15:52] since that time God says okay I'm not
[1:15:56] going to speak to man like that no more
[1:15:59] I'm gonna raise up Prophet my Prophet
[1:16:02] will talk to the people
[1:16:04] and get back to me
[1:16:07] I the Lord and since that time he has
[1:16:11] ordained men to preach the gospel he has
[1:16:14] ordained faithful Ministry after the
[1:16:17] Prophet come then the fight for Ministry
[1:16:20] it will break the prophet will bring the
[1:16:23] word like a cake then he called some of
[1:16:26] the faithful ministry as the world break
[1:16:29] then the faithful Ministry come out they
[1:16:32] come out God knows
[1:16:35] each each one of them have their time
[1:16:38] God just bring them in his own way and
[1:16:42] when they come out they come in the way
[1:16:45] God has shaped them
[1:16:47] it's not sometimes it doesn't fit the
[1:16:51] way the people want so that people don't
[1:16:54] want it but God has designed it like
[1:16:57] that
[1:16:58] so that it may take some away
[1:17:01] it may bring some me it may make some
[1:17:05] Ponder
[1:17:06] let me tell you how God is real
[1:17:09] brotherly our God is good

[1:20:20] speak even better than me so I'm not
[1:20:22] worried because you know why I get it
[1:20:25] you know where I get it I think Paul

[1:20:33] oh sorry a Paul yeah Stephen and Paul
[1:20:37] 's sign for them to kill Steven

[1:20:48] right Paul was inside and when Paul came
[1:20:51] look how what Paul did
[1:20:55] right
[1:20:56] God Knows Best
[1:20:58] sometimes God will put us into a
[1:21:01] situation
[1:21:02] you say you believe the message when he
[1:21:05] push you into that kind of corner like
[1:21:07] that
[1:21:08] then you you bargain

[1:23:06] the message people have made it have
[1:23:09] they have ripped the message you have
[1:23:11] they can talk about the quote but when
[1:23:14] it comes to reality like that they
[1:23:16] haven't seen it
[1:23:17] so many have been seen it
[1:23:20] me I don't believe half of the message I
[1:23:23] believe everything God did I may not
[1:23:26] able to quote it right or present it
[1:23:28] right but my heart God knew
