that they were they're going to be sending up another spaceship uh into the heavens and for the first time in the history of spaceships going up the commander of the entire project will be a woman the woman is now going to be the head of this PACE program that's going up into the heavens so I just want you to just notice these little signs pointing to the power and influence of the woman typing of the church slowly coming in um and though it looks slight it's just coming in without notice the people don't know what is absolutely going on all the business in the United States they're fighting over whether to have a dictatorship and move away from democracy it's all Paving the way for the proposal dictator it's all Paving the way for that so it will not come broad you know broad like that you're coming more subtly but it'll be literally the same thing coming in that way to rule one man like that ruling over the people uh with uh but he's not coming just with political power he's coming Financial religious spiritual and a political power he's coming with all of those Powers combined to bring it to Bear may God bless you thank you for um listening to just these few comments but uh to me when I see these things I know things are happening out there things are taking place things are moving praise the Lord now um on Wednesday nights of course I just like to get to the word so you can get out not because I want to rush out if the Holy Spirit wants to do something and he'll do something other than that in the middle of the week I want to be able to get back home you know and rest and go back to your work and become on the first day of the week and we give glory and praise to God Amen praise the Lord uh let us read the scripture first before I begin to sum 1. and for a brief while I'll just talk about the things of God Psalms chapter 1. begins blessed is the man that walketh not in the Council of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he this is my text shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of living by the rivers of water that bring it forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not build them and whatsoever he do it shall prosper the ungodly are not so but our lighted shaft which the wind driveth away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish amen gracious Heavenly Father we have read from the holy script and now we pray father just a bit of a bread of life as we go along the way on this week day father just strengthen us and recharge us father may your life our father make us so strong with the Vitality of the Holy Ghost that we might carry out your will and purpose and plan in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen please be seated I want to call this God's Tree by the river and it's funny why I called it that because when I read the scripture uh I I thought of an old tree that I knew um in days of Boyhood and that was a tree known to all the boys in the tongue and we love that tree because that's the tree that was hanging branches big branches that you can go out on hanging over the river and we just love that tree because from that tree we can plunge off of the tree right in the river and do our swimming and we did a lot of swimming and plunging off of that tree so that tree has um grip uh you know it holds a great place in memory when you think back of some of the things you did as a young person uh jumping off of that tree some people jumped off with a tire or something a tube and other ones that can really swim they jumped up plunged off and they swam around and everything in that tree that was by the river and that tree was there for years I've never gone back so I don't know if the tree is still there because the Bible tells us that this tree that's planted by the river of Living Water it can't with them so I don't know if that tree may still be alive for all I know and maybe young men of this generation may be doing exactly the same thing lunging off the branches of that tree in the river amen now um I'm looking at the fact quoting first brother Branham here God is speaking of his fruit tree that he had planted he planted a fruit tree amen and he planted it on the day of Pentecost now he said that because that's where he wanted to begin he didn't want to go from Genesis and you know tracing the tree all the way down so he just started there for this dispensation of which he was the prophet and Minister too that uh he would talk about that not talk about it in Israel not talk about it back there he briefly alluded to the fact how Kane's generation back there tried to kill the tree and God had to make no up bring the tree out in the ark and through the All the Troubles and trails and when the flood was over then the tree could come to life again okay well he just spoke brief and passed over that because he didn't want to go into commenting on all of that he wants to deal with his age his time his season that he was in right and he wanted that tree you see he brought forth that tree from on the death Pentecost and he brought it there for a purpose and the purpose was that it would bear his fruit word amen it would bear his fruit word the word then would be the fruit of that tree well when the tree will bear any fruit the fruit will be the word of God Amen praise the Lord hallelujah yes see because he wanted a church that would keep his word all done through them ages he wanted a church that would keep his word all down because Eve had failed him the Jews have failed him the law failed all of them failed so God had that tree that he knew would not be destroyed not killed would wither and would come down through their ages praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen now uh just to back up here this tree of course is mentioned first of all Genesis 2 verse 9 right when it talks about and there was a river in the Garden of Eden and from that River they went off other rivers right Rivers came from the central main river and there was many rivers but this one was planted right there the conjunction of Where the River become Rivers right and says that tree was there planted amen praise God hallelujah now we find out psalm one three it tells us about the tree again and we know it's the same tree because uh he said David saw this tree and we know that that he was not just talking about some natural tree that was planted by a natural River because the prophet said David saw that tree amen praise God hallelujah and there he saw the tree Again by Rivers amen hallelujah there was the tree planted then if you're to go to Revelation chapter 22 uh verse 2 you'll find it speaks again and there was a tree tempted by a river the Bible calls that tree the Tree of Life Hallelujah that was planted by the river actual fact here it doesn't not that text but listen he says now you know that the Tree of Life had come from God out of Heaven hallelujah amen so that was not a natural ordinary tree that somebody planted with a seed amen oh but this was a God's tree this was God's Tree of Life and God had planted the tree from Heaven amen and this is the tree that he said your father's at Manna From The Wicked manner in the wilderness and are all dead but this tree if you eat of it you will live forever that sounds very much like Jesus and the woman at the well if you eat this bread you'll live forever amen that was the tree amen if you eat the fruit off of this tree you'll live forever I wish some of the people that are into Health Foods would find a tree like that where where if they can eat the fruit of that tree they'll live forever oh my I don't even know if a natural tree like that was discovered if it would really bring life or death because they would start killing each other to become have the patent or the ownership of that tree and the selling of the leaves and this and that and they're gonna be a lot of murders and killing for it but this tree we are talking about is God's Supernatural Tree of Life everything about it gives life praise God forevermore amen now we know God that tree came out of God from heaven and was placed there in Eden and an angel guarded that tree from the Garden of Eden and it was kept in heathen and the tree of life is still now in the Garden of Eden of course he says here spiritually speaking so don't go looking arranging the world to find you know the garden somewhere to find this Magic Tree or some carnal people will think but it's a spiritual tree and it's found in God's Eden amen is where you'll find it I believe I'm I'm in that Eden right now uh in that condition uh of of a edenic state praise God because I've entered into his rest praise and I'm eating fruits from off the tree because in Revelation it tells you and that tree is going to Bear a manners all manner of fruit upon the 12th man is a fruit praise God hallelujah one fruit for each season no doubt and uh there's healing in the tree there's salvation in that tree there's power in the tree because it's there by the river praise God hallelujah amen now we know that tree planted that tree will support the bear fruit nine different kinds of spiritual fruits amen and those fruits were to go along with them nine spiritual gifts amen why to balance it right because he said it already it's all right you you can go and ask God for tongues for healing for miracles but if you don't have the character if you don't have these uh fruits of the spirit to help to control those gifts then they're going to be outside of God's balance amen praise God power without control is devilish she said right without controls over it it's devilish and it's the Holy Spirit we know has to really control these uh Divine gifts praise God I thank God for God for history that is by the Riverside amen I trust a lot of people will still go down by the Riverside I I trust they will go there now and again and dip in the fountains filled with Emmanuel's blood where Sinners plans beneath the stains amen praise God a trust never go down they're not going down by the river anymore these days they'll go by the baptismal Funk they'll go back for a sprinkling or something but I pray that God will come back these people will come back to the word come back to the River of Life amen and receive something from the presence of God Amen now yes sir back then you see Eden but now this tree got planted he planted it in the Earth on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah this tree planted spiritually on the day of Pentecost amen this was the tree that David saw long ago and spoke of it and wrote of it but notice when he wrote of it and wrote about these songs it was all about something joyful always something joyful when he saw this tree he was joyful praise God and when we see this tree we are joyful because we know there's life in the tree praise God hallelujah amen and this was a tree he says that was planted by Rivers God says is planted where by Rivers not body methodists not by Baptists not by Presbyterian not by Lutheran hallelujah amen but planted by Rivers now listen he's really thinking maybe at that time about the Rivers of Babylon that's why he went right inside was planted by Rivers but not them Rivers Methodist Baptists Presbyterian and all these other rivers but he is planted by the rivers of water singular right or mice that's the way it is one River one water amen coming from that River Hallelujah and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water praise God hallelujah then David said blessed is that man blessing is that man of course when he says blessed is that man he was speaking in of Jesus Christ Our Hallelujah who was the who is the Tree of Life he's speaking of him but he's also speaking of the church amen that would have his roots in the word of God it's also speaking of individual Believers if they will plant themselves under by faith into uh the word of God the rivers of Living Waters amen and there we said when he saw it that he spoke of this tree amen now remember this tree it says here he could not die hallelujah thank God he could not die and he leaves that came from home from him shall not wither no matter how much heat the devil puts on them no matter how many bugs he puts to eat them and Destroy them they can't wither because the tree to which they're from is getting on the water from underground Springs water from the river is getting direct water from the river Hallelujah and I'm glad we've made contact with the Divine channel of Grace where our souls can be watered by the word of God hallelujah amen praise God forever amen no matter what they do to it they will never be able to kill that tree they cannot kill the tree amen because it's where the tree is planted hallelujah it's where the tree is Blended it's where he is splinted why he's planted by the rivers of water and that's why David is saying his roots cannot die now his thoughts are moving now right he's coming now now and he's saying it's because of the roots of the tree it's in the river and getting water well you know that's the way tree is feed themselves is by extracting whatever they need from the soil that is around them and if there's a pond or a pool you'll find a lot of roots because all the trees are trying to get their Roots over to that pool to get to uh the Water there amen oh my you might see no so he goes on he says you know when I was a boy there was a great big tree big old tree sitting there and the wind would blow and every time the wind would blow I would think it would blow down that tree but instead the tree kept standing up there but you said he said year after year the tree was still there why was that he said because it would it would just loosen up the roots of that tree by rocking that tree back and forth loosen up the roots and that caused that tree to dig down even deeper Hallelujah with its roots so it can get a better hold oh so is it with the Christian mockery comes laughter comes making fun of you as a Christian comes what it does what does that do to you persecution will come and it may even Shake Christian to make them pray more shake them to make them dig down more them to get a better hold so they can stand the storms of life praise God I'm so glad that our God does that no wonder he said quoted all joy when you go through the fiery trials count it all joy when you are tested and you're tried praise God because the trying of your faith worketh patience and when you think you are weak that's when you're even becoming strong and stronger for his glory and honor just about the time when you think Lord this is enough I'm ready to give up I'm ready to give up but the Bible said we are not tempted with any Temptation that he knows that we can't bear Amen in other words God will tempt you but temp the word tempt is used there but it's really test right to your breaking point and just when you're a little limit about to break then he relaxes him amen praise God and he knows exactly you you will say oh I can't take it I can't but God knows how much you can bear is that right praise the name of the Lord aren't we glad we have a lord like that that knows everything is in our hearts amen he says that's the way it is amen oh my see planted by the rivers of water David saw him and when he saw him praise God now he's talking about the tree but the tree is now a man and he's saying when he saw him he was planted but there this tree and by the river and he could not die thank God the devil could not kill Jesus take God he says because I live you as the leaves on this tree you will live also I am the vine you are the branches if it were not so I would have told you praise God and because of him we live today we Rejoice today we praise God today attack blessed are your eyes my eyes my heart that we see these things many many like he said long to see these things from the days of the prophets now and now you are seeing these things blessed are your eyes that you're able to see these things to the glory of God hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah notice notice he now he could not die but why is it empty the tree could not die because his roots was in the river listen now we know he had life in that that roots life was in them groups no where is the roots or where is the life of the tree it's always in The Roots now we're talking now we come down we are living in a country like this where we can talk about winter and we know that winter comes all the life that was in the tree start dreaming and growing down into the roots and why is it going into the Earth because it's going to protect them that sells until the winter is passed until all the storms of winter is past it's going to hide Me Oh My Savior hide till the storms of life are passed we hide in the roots of the tree and he is the root and offspring of David root and Branch praise God and we give glory to his great name amen all right see the life stays in the roots amen his roots had life in them to brings forth fruit in his season when he wants fruits to come forth when he wants Life to Come forward and I just pay attention to the word season it's really talking about what age is the age is that's what he's talking about the ages he knows when when one age is going to end and there's going to be a gap there and then it's time for fruits to come forward and then he'll bring forth some more fruits amen so he brings forth fruit in his season not in our season man season oh well we need to do get a program here brother because we need to have hundreds more of membership so let's plan a program of how to attract the people to come you see that's good and you could do that but that's man but God has his own plan he has his own way how to bring forth fruit in his season not in our season amen oh my now before I go on to that he says here this is a tree that will not cast its fruit fruit comes on that tree and that fruit will not be cast off or put away and that's because the tree is always at the river in the river it's root in those Waters of the river but watch another tree that gets away from that River gets away from that water amen it will just bear nothing but naughty worm eaten fruit and it will begin to drop on the ground and cast its crop amen you've seen that we've seen all these crab apples and all kinds of fruits where the tree becomes so withered and everything else and that's what's the matter with art with the Church of the day do you believe it they've gone away from the rivers of God's word they've gone away from the revelation of the word of God hallelujah amen and them spiritual things of God and so they're casting their fruits he said what do I mean cast their fruits their their Believers live like the world they act like the world they're still cheat and lie like the world they smoke they drink they gamble like the world they have parties even in the church to pay to be able to raise money to pay the preacher Lord have mercy they even have all manner soup suppers the race monies dances and everything else you see what's happening they have cast their fruit that's what it means by they cast their fruit they cast their fruit they're just like the world and the unbeliever and they look that way and they and the unbeliever even says there is no difference in them people and me so what's the use amen he puts it this way those are my words there is no difference in that person and me praise God and he says that's what caused communism to rise up in Russia you know there was an old European gentleman my wife and I well his name is Stan Lee and we just were taking care of him it's one of those cases where um he had a bit of money but we were just taking care of it and um of course he wanted to give us all his stuff and we said no no no no no no we are not doing it for that right uh we're just doing it because of the grace of God in our hearts and he just broke down and started to cry and since I you know I am I'm an atheist I don't believe in God and he says and the reason why I can tell you the Day and The Time uh when uh my father was killed in the war and I was just a young man and just my mother and I and other siblings and we just had a plot of land and a garden with some things that we were just growing to be able to eat and the priest came and the priest demanded it all took it all and took the land and threw us out of there and watched this mother mistreated and died right he said when I saw all the things that the church was doing that absolutely turned me away to thinking there can't be a God and these can't be as Representatives right well I'm saying that in that light brother Branham said that is the reason for the rise of communism in other words the hypocritical living or life uh by people that were claiming to be Christians is what caused communism to rise up he said it rose up there and that's what happened and anywhere that is that happens that's what happens see down there they burnt up the Catholic Church there in Russia when they saw that and again down in Mexico when they come across them lying Pips and places where they burnt babies and and none having nuns having these babies and finding human bodies and full-grown human bodies laying in them lying pets what do they do you see they have cast their crop amen they've gotten away from the word of God and God just shook them off the tree amen they're not on God's tree hallelujah amen we know right here in Canada that this is he's speaking from way back when he was alive but right now you know that uh up north what note there and all these different places that the church and churches are still doing these very same things amen oh there are many things that will tell you not just of the Catholic Church the southern baptist conference convention down there in the South and all of the things that have taken place there and many of the other organizations but it's this hypocritical living that crossed the rise of communism and it's this hypocritical living Even in our time that is causing the rise of an evil monster we know fascism give way socialism give with fascism to socialism socialism to Communism and so on until we come right down capitalism and we come right down to this time what that monster that's going to merge into I do not know but we are living in a time when that cycle is just about to repeat again amen the hypocrisy is at such a height when these things are supposed to take place again amen notice in the midst of all that this man is planted by the river and I just put some red ink around this where he said he is not stuck in by the river he's not going to go into that but what he's talking about somebody you want to transplant something or or confuse something they're going to stick a root or something by the river no no he says this man is not just stuck in there he has planted God deliberately planted him by the river amen so this is a tree that God planted by the rivers of water and he shall bring forth fruit in his God season this man is going to bear fruit in God's season because God planted him there Hallelujah now let's read psalms one let's do that because that's what he's saying here blessed is oh well he's quoting from memory blessings is the man that sit at not in the seat of the scornful nor stands in the way of sinners he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of waters he shall bring forth his fruit in his season and whatsoever it went shall prosper the ungodly is not so amen and why because he will not stand with him the ungodly in judgment amen praise God but with the righteous with The Godly he will stand with us amen praise God and one day he said if you stand with him he'll stand with you stand by the Bible is the Bible the word will stand with you praise God hallelujah o praise God now notice thank God also has ordained Messengers to each age and that messenger is ordained to come and bring forth the fruits from God's tree bring them forth in the season Hallelujah don't you believe you are the fruits of brother Brandon's Ministry don't you see what you're talking about there fruits of the messengers message bring forth the fruits in this season the season here that God placed him praise God so you see he will bring forth his fruit in a season and then fruits it cannot wiggle because them them are predestinated fruits predestinated fruits you can't destroy those fruits Hallelujah because that's predestinated Lord of God hallelujah Ephesians 5 says we are now sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus hallelujah praise God now again breaking into his thinking the fruit is hanging on the tree so he says we are seated in Heavenly places in Jesus Christ amen hallelujah oh don't you see what happened God by his foreign knowledge predestinated us unto adoption of the children of God by Jesus Christ Hallelujah this is the predestinated fruits that are supposed to come from the tree oh my by his foreknowledge he predestinated everything that would happen right down the road and all that was done by his foreknowledge because he forsy it he could predestinated amen right because he can tell from beginning to end so therefore the predestinated fruit was already in the root of that tree thank God we were in the root thank God we were in the root of David and the branch of David thank God he is divine we are the branches Hallelujah I'm so glad that we are the root praise God and now is our season to Bear him fruit I'm not going to watch Poetic here but the fact is this is our season to Bear some fruit so that when he said when the son of man comes again son of man comes against will he find fruit amen you remember the Fig Tree if you read that that's exactly what he said when he comes again the son of man come will he find fruit may God find fruit bearing lies upon this Earth that believes this war and stays with the word and will not move to the right nor to the left amen praise God hallelujah amen yes sir I'm so glad because it's predestinated predestinated now notice carefully see not only David saw it but Joel saw the tree and spoke of it but he spoke of it when it was at down he saw it when it was at down amen praise God and worms begin to Egypt he saw all that but the tree could not die amen hallelujah it's brute because the life is in the root amen hallelujah and in the root there was predestinated truth praise the Lord that's not me that's him speaking here he says here now you see if the life was in the root for in the root he had predestinated truth it had God's word what's the predestination truth the word the revelation of the word was there to come in the season oh praise God for predestinated people praise the Lord hallelujah amen and that's the way this tree is who praise God hallelujah now we know the New Birth come by Christ and we cannot die with that birth Hallelujah you come from the tree how are you gonna die you're from the tree and the tree has to root in the water now you you just quickly you understand that he's talking about that our origin is way back in the mind of God and the root of the tree and everything else you you can go ahead with that and it comes right down praise God hallelujah they are now discovering that they can grow trees and they actually grow better when the tree is upside down you've seen them and it's bearing even more Tomatoes when they find how to put them upside down and the thing is bearing all kinds of tomatoes oh my just think of it and this tree is a tree that has its root not in the earth not in ground but the tree has the roots up in the mind of God he said the tree comes from Heaven it's a different kind of a tree praise God it's an eternal tree it's a tree that's bearing branches that can't die fruit that can't wither can't die leaves that can't wither hallelujah amen praise God and Joel saw that tree hallelujah oh see how it is you can take that tree and it can be persecuted it can be made fun of and it has been made fun of since the Garden of Eden until this time but it cannot die amen it's predestinated they've clogged that it and the tree still lives they beat the tree and the tree is still alive might have done everything to it and it still lives what happened it cannot die he will not die amen he can't because he's holding in him the predestinated word oh praise God why would you know when you read it Forward he's he's thinking and talking about Jesus Christ how he can't die and how you know he's always resurrected then his mind switches to the believer now he cannot die for he has the predestinated word in him Hallelujah and we cannot die because we have the predestinated word in Us Praise the Lord oh my praise God how do you know that you know when I said that that's how that's the evil one though he said how do you know that because I believe it now and even when you close your eyes and if you slip away and gone with the Lord you don't know anything but you are believing the word now so you don't have to worry about that then amen amen everybody can say whatever they want but we're going into the presence of almighty God hallelujah amen you see he cannot die and I'm going to start winding this up because he's holding in him the predestinated word of God and it has to come forth for for his fruit is in his own season in his predestinated season and we are in our predestinated seed season and the fruit must come forth for he said it's in its season praise God I believe we caught the word in our season we cut the word at the right time they'll know when it is time for them to know praise God and I believe this is the time when we have come to know the revelation of this word of the Living God you see Joel saw that they saw every one of them when they began to eat it down to the bottom but God already spoke and said I will restore saith the Lord in other words you can't kill the tree no matter what state it look or how you eat it down I will restore you break off a branch and think you're gonna kill it that way I will restore you try to chop it down here it will come up again I will restore have you ever seen uh in our old yard we had tree like that where we cut it down right to the roots we say it's gone now we cover it up with Darkness it's out of the way and a year passed maybe a year and a half next you know Nutrisystem again the tree is living again but that's what God is talking about this is a tree you can't kill you can chop it you can Club it do whatever you want hallelujah oh my you see it will grow right back because it's my tree brother let me quote brother Branham here because I like this statement all then friends oh what a tree oh my what a tree praise God and I want to say here what a tree what a word what a revelation what a promise for this age for this owl I thank God that we have got our Roots planted by this revelation of this message or roots in the rivers of Living Water hallelujah praise God amen amen yes sir Hallelujah but watch the other bunch Cain's children come up and what are they doing they got some bugs amen and trying to get them bugs to eat down the tree and to eat it right down to the stock stock Hallelujah back there with Noah God just took a crop of it and put it in the ark and carried it over safely through to the other side hallelujah oh praise God I believe in this hour God has us put inside of our Ark amen but this time the ark is not uh some wooden Art built back there but it's the ark even the Old Testament the word was in the ark hallelujah amen so I believe God will preserve us and take us over to the other side amen he'll do it himself for his glory and he'll put us there and take us through because the tree this tree Hallelujah was predestinated to bring forth his fruit in his season praise God hallelujah I thank God for his his old tree by the river amen and I believe that if we had some uh you know of the people from the South they would have sang Down by the Riverside Hallelujah because they need to go Back Down by the Riverside and let's be God's tree planted by the river brothers and sisters may the Lord richly bless you amen deserve this wonderful times we have in the house so God these services are going to just be getting simpler and simpler and simpler until some people are going to think it's nothing nothing to it but to you who recognize that is God's great mystery secret being revealed and spoken to his bride amen praise the Lord they can hear the outer part of it because they're outside the veil but when you're in the veil then you are in the midst of the glory or the Shekinah Glory of the presence of the Living God and you can hear the voice that spoke to Aaron Moses you can hear that voice speaking to you amen and I
