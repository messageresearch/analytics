what we had uh uh some of our young people went down to uh a youth camp down in uh Michigan so glad to have them back and from what I understand is uh out of I don't know must have been 200 young people but it seemed like uh young Gabe here was the hit of the party everybody in Michigan believing W Believers wise knows who brother Gabe is now so we're glad that his influence went out and that he was a blessing to them down there I believe he was because you know sometimes you just got to loosen up a little bit right how many believe that you got to loosen up a little bit and and be free right absolutely and and that's uh that was their testimony but um right now we're we have uh is is uh is it confirmed brother coffee Adam the return of Adam is that is that confirmed I think it [Music] is so our African singers Adam are going to do something that's a little bit off the off the top right it's not they they didn't practice it a whole lot but you know since when do you got to practice being African doesn't make sense right so we know they're good and God bless them as they come but let thing he didn't bring us this far to leave us just the chorus of it we'll have them come and then after that we have a testimony all right he didn't bring us this far to leave us he didn't teach us to swim to let us D he didn't build his home in us to move away he didn't lift us up to let us down he didn't us up sing it again he didn't bring us this far you know it brother sister he didn't bring us this far to leave us he didn't teach us to swim to let us try he didn't build his home

how much he's done for you and how much he's dealt with you and he's done the same for me and he's done same for everybody else and then you go out of the country and then all around the world what a mighty God we serve amen I tell you one songwriter uh he put it this way and and I want to sing this and I'll tell you why I want to sing this because one thing I've noticed over the years that probably 75% of the time if not more and I probably didn't sing it on purpose but we sang this song every time brother Danny would come to preach and I kept on noticing why is this song keep on coming up every time brother Danny come in and preach and now I know why because the song writer says how lovely on the mountains are are the feet of them who bring good news good news praise God you know who he's talking about don't you and the preachers and the ministers and the five-fold ministry and uh so let sing that brother Danny is going to come and give us a little bit of his testimony we know what's happening in a very short amount of time he's going to become become the pastor of Good Neighbor Ministries so we asked him if he thought it would be a good idea and he agreed to come and give a little bit more of his testimony does that sound all right with you in the meantime how lovely on the mountains are the feet of them who bring good news come on now oh good news announcing peace proclaiming news of Happiness our god reigns our god reigns everybody now oh Our God R come ahead brother Danny Our God [Music] R sing my god reigns oh my god reigns my God my [Music] God [Music] amen praise God our god reigns amen he has reigned you may be seated for a little bit praise God um so um they asked me if it would be a good idea to give uh a short testimony and um just uh so what I'll do is I'll I'll just I gave this testimony um back in actually it was December 31st uh 200 N exactly 14 years ago and um it's interesting because it's exactly the halfway point of my serving the lord to date by the grace of God and um I am just as zealous maybe not as wild as I was when I first came to the Lord but uh still very very zealous and still very thankful for the grace of God in my life and in my home amen so I'm gonna I'm gonna make it brief I'm GNA Go real quickly through some of the the background um and my desire tonight is truly to give the Lord Jesus all the glory through this testimony because it was his mighty hand and his work in my life um from from a very young age I realized that uh uh I was having certain experiences that I couldn't quite understand couldn't quite uh you know they would just be strange events that would happen while I was young but I was born in 1961 February of 61 as veto Dany mailli and as a child it was decided that I'd be called Danny using my second name and um I I guess the Lord had a purpose in that because we know that um there's something in the name right and so uh the Lord decided that uh that it would be Danny and it was something that came strong on my mother's heart that um I not be uh called veto but Dany and uh so that's that's how I got my name and um as a child I remember having uh strange moments of bliss I would just have these moments when I was you know young and all of a sudden I would feel such a Euphoria around my life and I couldn't quite understand what it was but I just I just felt so good I loved everything and then I realized that you know at some point as I started to get a little older and it would happen I would start to wonder why am I here why am I on this Earth You know and that was something that always stayed with me um from a young age and uh you know as time went on I came to realize that uh the Lord had a plan but I also remember some extreme moments of fear and I mean I would have nightmares after nightmare of of a presence around me at times that would just paralyze me and I realize now the difference between the two and and um you know one was you know that somebody was chasing after me and that was always going to kill me and come after me and kill me and and I used to have those dreams and I'd be running for my life running for my life and uh I realize that uh you know now as time has gone by I don't have those dreams anymore by the grace of God but I have the fights mentally and spiritually which you all know about which are the greatest battles that we will fight as we grow in the Lord but I was born in Toronto at Mount siai hospital I grew up in Scarboro till I was 16 years of age and then my family moved to miss Saga it was at this time when we moved to miss Saga that my life took a a very bad turn and you know it was all because of your you know like one thing I can say say young people is your peers and those that you hang around with um will have a definite influence on your life and it was at that time you know when I was 17 16 17 18 that I started to experiment with drugs and by the time I was 21 I was addicted and drugs was just a regular part of my life I got involved into a rock and roll band it was a professional band we used to play at you know V use all over Toronto and we'd be paid like you know thousands of dollars to play you know for a one night uh uh performance and along with that came all of the more of the drugs more of the drinking more of the you know the life that um that you know that Satan had a con absolute control over my life and you know um however that didn't stop me from working I always had this desire to be successful and that I would have my own business um and so I would you know work hard wherever I worked I would immediately you know grow in that work environment I'd get you know raises and then promotions and I ended up at a company um started working at a company when I was 17 years old the company was uh Caravan trailer rentals and um Caravan trailer rentals I worked there for about six years and um it was there that uh that I actually met my beautiful wife Jennifer um you know she had come to work at the company um and I was working in the rental office at the time I was 19 years old and the guys were telling me hey have you seen the new girl at the front there's a new receptionist she's beautiful you know I said oh I gota check her out out you know and so I went there and um you know I was going up and I remember this very very clearly because this was another event that took place that I realize now that it was God putting us together because I went up into the office and I remember it clearly I came up these stairs and I went to the reception and I was looking to see where she would be you know just nonchalantly and then she wasn't there and then I turned around around and she was filing some papers at a filing cabinet and then I looked over at her and she looked at me and I immediately had a flash like a light flash that just kind of struck me was kind of unusual but I just didn't really you know make anything out of it I thought maybe it was a sun or something that hit my eye or whatever but not realizing you know that that was my wife and that God was you know showing me that um that you know later on I didn't know then believe me I I had I only had you know a few things on my mind as a young man right and you know and uh you know we just want to go after the girls that are pretty right but anyways um time went on and uh our relationship started to develop uh the company was owned and operated by a a gentleman by the name of Gabriel alter okay he took a very strong liking to me and within a few years I was actually seated in the office next to him and I was the head P purchasing agent for the company buying millions of dollars of raw materials and I was only like 21 years old and I was making an income that was you know almost twice my dad's income he thought like what the the world is going on you know but that was just the grace of God and um you know that company did a lot in building a certain character a certain um attitude towards business and I believe you know God used a few people within that company to mold and shape me to um have the the kind of positive outlook and positive mental attitude that led me to be an entrepreneur and to be successful in business so there was good seeds planted there um and it was there that I met my Rebecca praise God because the company had three camels as their logo and uh it was owned by Gabriel alter and uh you know there's just you know certain things that we look back now and we realize you know strange but just the grace of God Amen but I was a real big risk taker and by the time I was 22 years old I had decided that I wanted to be on my own I wanted to have my own business I wanted to get out and I left the company and um uh went and started a cleaning business and while all of this is going on I want you to know that I had a drug addiction to cocaine okay and it was a Strong Addiction but yet I was able to function you know that drug is is a is a powerful drug and Satan used it to lure me in and you know I was still able to function I was still able to do business I felt Invincible at times when I was on it you know it was just the the the the effects of it but it gave you know it did certain things um and Satan was actually um trapping me because I thought I was in control of it at the time but let me tell you young people uh you're never in control when you're under the influence of drugs he is absolutely in control of your life to the point where by the time I was um you know just before I came to the Lord I was I was so addicted that you know I was um being pulled anytime he wanted me to to be on on the drugs he would take me to places to go and get it and you know Satan Made A Way that I had a friend who was a very close friend who was a dealer and he used to just give it to me you know and that was and that was even worse that's what made it even worse and you know um so it it was really all of this was all happening but yet I was in business for myself and within a couple of years of leaving caravan trailers I was broke and and uh but but I never gave up and and so I started another business and it was in 1985 that I started um in the fruit market business with a friend in Oakville and um uh within two years of that starting that Fruit Market business um and another store we were broke again and it was in 19 late 1986 when um we decided that the only thing that we could afford was a bankrupt business because we lost everything and so we went and took over fantasy Fruit Market which is the the one that we eventually had right up until now um in 1987 and we were able to build that business up and it started to become very successful and we started to do very well and by 1990 I was um in the real estate business building with two other partners we were building a $10 million townhouse complex and we were doing well I had a I had my own stretch limousine I had a Jaguar I had a $120,000 yacht parked up in Midland white Heritage Marina my wife and I and Christina when she was just a baby we would go boating into Georgian Bay and I was with you know multi-millionaires and I was moving at levels but all at the same time I was under the influence of this drug addiction and so it was in 1991 that the real estate market crashed and it was bad and we ended up losing everything I lost everything plus by the time all the smoke cleared I still owed about $600,000 in debt and so I remember very specifically we were in a rental home and Jennifer you got to understand something I protected her just unconsciously I protected her from all of this it was I kept so much out of her all she all I wanted her to do was just worry about taking care of Christina and by that time we had Michael in 1991 and I didn't want to tell her you know that that things were as bad as they really were but they were really bad and I remember I was sitting up in our bedroom um at a rental home in Miss Saga and uh I had just received another court order the lawsuit for people that we owed hundreds of thousands of dollars to that were suing us and I went up into my bedroom I never told her nothing I would just say yeah you know things are not going well but we're GNA we're going to be okay you know but I remember going up into my bedroom and I was sitting on my bed and I was actually contemplating how to commit suicide because I just didn't see a way out you know you can get so deep you know into despair at times that you just don't see a way out and I remember looking up and I said if there's a God I need you after that we still had fantasy Fruit markets but I went back because I had left fantasy Fruit markets kept a small ownership in it and had sold a portion to some partners and they had literally um destroyed the business it was going under so that was in despair I was in despair but I but it was the only thing that I had that I could go back to not realizing that it was at that time that God started to do things supernaturally in restoring my life and all I remember is putting my head down and doing and working and working and working doing whatever I had to do in order to keep food on the table I was negotiating deals with all the creditors I had negotiated deals the you know uh the finance companies would call they they said we're we're we're picking up your boat I said that's fine you know where it is go pick it up you know they they repossessed everything I had to sell the limousine you know for a cheap price just had to get rid of everything that I had just to survive and meanwhile God was working in in getting us back on our feet again and within about four years fantasy had really started to grow to the point where we were um uh expanded to two other locations actually we were at we were at two locations we had just gone from one to the second location um uh we still had just a single location when the Lord came into my life in 1994 and it was in 1996 that we went to the second and then the Third location in 1999 but God was restoring everything and it was at that time that you know while I was in the restoration stage um sister Jennifer and I had moved into a house in Miss Saga and I was going to buy furniture and it was at that time that I went to see brother Gabriel faretti and uh purchased some furniture from him uh he was a friend of my partner my partner's wife was in the interior decorating business and so uh he he was the person that she dealt with and and my partner said Dan if you need any furniture go and see this guy he'll take care of you he's a great Furniture maker so I went there and I bought all this furniture anyway long story short he gave me an incredible deal on furniture that I was shocked and I looked at him and I said I said this is incredible are you are you satisfied with this you know with this price he goes yeah yeah that's fine you know the way Gabriel is right he looks at me goes you a Christian I said uh I was brought up Roman Catholic I said um if that's Christianity then I'm a hypocrite I just told them because I knew I would go to church on Sunday and I would be a devil on Saturday night and you know so it was all hypocritical and and I knew it but you know he he said so I said to him I said and he looks at me he goes yeah that's good he says here listen to this tape take it so I took it and you know while I was at gab's place there I noticed that there was some people there I didn't know who it was I realized now it was brother Tim and and I believe brother Vishnu was there at the time and I heard I heard like God bless you or God something and you know I it just caught my attention but it didn't really I was chasing Michael because he was running around in the showroom and um and so that's just a side note of something that was there at the time that I that I recall but um anyways I listened to the tape sister Jennifer and I listened to it on the way home it was brother brandom preaching on uh the Hebrew series on uh Paul being knocked off his high horse and you know I'm listening to that and I'm and uh but I didn't I couldn't understand what it was but something was striking my soul that was speaking to me out of this tape that I couldn't quite understand so by the time I got home I realized that I'd left my sunglasses at the donnut shop just down the street from Gabriel's so I phoned Gabriel just as we arrived home in this 45 minute drive I said and I called him I said Gabriel I got to come back there I left my sunglasses at a doughnut shop I said but do you have any more tapes he says yeah yeah yeah so I went there and he gives me a whole box full of tapes and there're the old brother brandham you know the cassette tapes and I listen to those tapes every single day for about 3 four months and every now and then Gabriel would call me you know and he would say Dan he says uh I go right by you sometime you want to come to church I said when you go to church he goes I go Tuesday I go Thursday and I go uh Sunday I go what three times a week and then I thought in my mind I said no no I'm not going I said what is this you know and I said well maybe sometime gab maybe sometime you know okay and then he you know a few months with another month or so and and stuff and then we're talk and then I call him sometimes and about the T and then he call me again he goes I'm going right by your place tonight you want me to pick you up I can pick you up right there miss Saga Road at the Tim Hortons so he pulls in there I said okay I'm coming I said okay I gotta go I let me go and see so Gabriel pulls in at the Tim Hortons he pulls in a van he had about 12 people in the van it was Filipinos Africans uh all these different I got into the front seat and I looked back and I thought oh my God what am I doing here and and uh so anyways long story short he took us to the service and it was at the Little White Church in Winona and Pastor Simon stepped out you know there was uh about 50 to 60 people all worshiping I've never seen anybody worship like this people worshiping the Lord Pastor Simon stepped out and he preached a message that night and it was on the woman at the well and while he was preaching that message talking about that prostitute's life my whole life was flashing by and I realized that that he was talking to me that I was I was that individual and something Supernatural happened that night because I was weeping and crying I'm trying to hide my my face from Gabriel and you know like I just I felt you know just overwhelmed by what was being preached and that was the start of you know coming to the Good Neighbor or to at that time it was Eagles crime Ministries I had no idea that a man that was 5 foot4 could pack that kind of power and anointing that was speaking to my heart like that and so it was there that the Lord really spoke to me I started to attend the churches I came to get baptized um in 1994 and um uh you know it just it just went from there I don't want to really uh you know I can't really go much further than that here I am now today after 29 years um I'm excited about the Lord I'm excited about the word why because he's a supernatural God he did so much Supernatural I mean it would take me out hours to give you the testimonies of the supernatural that took place in my home in my wife her testimony and how the Lord delivered her it was Supernatural I realized at the time that God had called me I was crying out I said Lord you got to call my wife how in the world because our marriage was going opposite ways at the time I remember I would come home from church you know and I'd be praying for my wife that the Lord would somehow open the understanding to her to make her see this I remember you know I'd come home from work and she'd be going out with her girlfriends you know and I'd be going you know to church and she'd be going out with her girlfriends you know and I remember one night I called brother Mike and I said brother I said can you please pray for my wife she's going to a bar you know and supernaturally I'll tell you she came home early that night she was petrified of of an experience that she had at that bar of of demons that that that that she never went back again and I remember that so well and it was at that time that she said I'm coming to church and it was at that time that uh you know she came to hear Pastor Simon and she heard some tapes before and she says wow he's got a sense of humor uh you know I I I'll come I'll come and uh did uh did he have a sense of humor yeah he sure did and he called my wife and I and our family by the grace of God to this message that I'm very very grateful for God bless you [Applause] Saints praise God praise God one we all stand once my soul was astray from the Heavenly way and was wretched and vile as could be but then my savior of
