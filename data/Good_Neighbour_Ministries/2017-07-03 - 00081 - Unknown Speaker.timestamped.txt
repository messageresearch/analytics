[25:52] Amen. And in St. John's 14:12, Amen.
[25:58] reads like this. Verily, verily, I say
[26:00] unto you, he that believeth on me, the

[26:04] I do shall ye do also, and greater works
[26:08] than these shall he do, because I go to
[26:11] my father. Amen. Praise God. You all may
[26:13] be seated tonight.
[26:16] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[26:20] Now I want you to just answer just a
[26:22] simple little question for me tonight.
[26:25] And if anyone knows it
[26:27] or give me just a quick shower. When you
[26:31] hear the word
[26:33] deposit, what's the first thing that
[26:36] comes to your mind?
[26:39] Amen. Glory to God. See, there you go.
[26:43] Amen. That's what that's when you hear
[26:46] that word deposit. Amen.
[26:48] Hallelujah. Because you're all familiar
[26:50] with that, right? Thank you,
[26:54] Lord. And we want to speak about tonight
[26:58] the the
[27:00] deposit.
[27:03] Amen. The word deposit is to place for
[27:12] safekeeping. And God has a deposit safe.
[27:18] And his word is safekeeping.
[27:24] Amen. Hallelujah.
[27:28] Or in a trust. When you have a deposit,
[27:30] you put it in maybe in a trust or in a
[27:32] bank account.
[27:34] Amen. So you got money in the bank. No,
[27:38] it's safe, right?
[27:41] The think
[27:44] the ticket safe.
[27:47] One strike of a pen, you can just one
[27:49] little express it can just disappear.
[27:55] Or to give a security or impart payment.
[28:00] So when you make a deposit on an item,
[28:03] amen, you make a down payment and it pay
[28:07] part of it so later you can get it and
[28:10] pay the rest or you know, praise God.
[28:13] Like you make a down payment on a house.
[28:15] Amen. Later, you know, can get a
[28:18] mortgage and then you can acquire the
[28:20] house and you pay. Amen.
[28:23] Hallelujah. Or it's to deliver and leave
[28:27] an item. Deposit an item, leave it
[28:30] there. To put in place or set
[28:36] down especially
[28:39] carefully. Amen. So the first thing when
[28:42] you hear about deposit, you think about
[28:44] money.
[28:46] Amen. Or money in the
[28:49] bank. Now, in order for you to make an
[28:53] withdrawal, you got to put something
[28:55] there first.
[28:57] You can't go to the bank and you say go
[29:00] to withdrawal and you got nothing there.
[29:03] Amen. We're going to be practical
[29:05] tonight. Amen. Hallelujah.
[29:10] First, you got to make a deposit or
[29:13] somebody got to put something there for
[29:14] you for you to withdraw.
[29:20] Amen.
[29:22] Hallelujah. We hear of a gold or diamond
[29:26] or oil
[29:28] deposit. Amen. And when you think
[29:33] about an oil deposit, you think about
[29:37] fortune. You got you're rich. You find
[29:41] an oil deposit or a diamond or gold
[29:43] deposit rich. And in the early American
[29:48] history, right, those who know about
[29:50] American history, you must have heard
[29:53] about the California gold
[29:57] rush where over
[30:00] 300,000 people rush to California
[30:03] because they found gold. they're going
[30:06] to seek and find
[30:08] fortune. And even before
[30:10] that, right, the Europeans, they were
[30:14] promised
[30:15] that in this North American country and
[30:18] a land where there is gold cities, gold
[30:22] everywhere. And people just took off and
[30:24] they left, right? They took their family
[30:28] and they gave up everything they had and
[30:30] they just, you know, went to seek their
[30:33] fortune. But to their surprise when they
[30:36] came here, right? There
[30:39] was really
[30:41] nothing. So they were
[30:43] misled. Amen. And you know in the gold
[30:47] rush, the California gold rush, Amen.
[30:50] when they discovered gold there, right?
[30:53] Even when they discovered oil in Texas,
[30:56] right? People became million,
[30:58] multi-millionaires overnight. Amen.
[31:01] Praise God.
[31:02] And that caused so much disruption and
[31:05] and and killing because people be became
[31:09] greedy. They kill the natives by the
[31:14] thousands. They poison them. They shot
[31:16] them. They massacred them to drive them
[31:19] out from their own land. Amen.
[31:24] Just to get this what they think is so
[31:29] valuable. Amen.
[31:33] But you know that is the greatest
[31:35] deposit that was ever
[31:39] made and few finding this deposit.
[31:44] Few death people finding it. And this
[31:47] deposit was made way before the
[31:49] foundations of the world.
[31:53] And another deposit that God had placed
[31:56] or made is a deposit or part of
[32:01] him in you.
[32:06] A part of God himself, a part of the job
[32:10] of God's life or a part of the G that
[32:14] God has placed in you and I
[32:18] way before the foundations of the world.
[32:21] Amen.
[32:23] Hallelujah. Praise God. And that deposit
[32:27] is without price.
[32:30] Money can't buy that. And it's only by
[32:32] his grace alone and by his mercy that
[32:35] you receive that. You didn't do anything
[32:38] to deserve that. Amen.
[32:42] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[32:49] Now, you may receive a letter in the
[32:55] mail, and it's just a piece of paper
[32:59] stating that you have a check for a
[33:02] million dollars.
[33:05] Right?
[33:08] And you might say,
[33:10] "How do you know you got a million
[33:13] dollars?
[33:15] It's just a piece of ordinary piece of
[33:17] paper, right? Stating that it's for a
[33:20] million dollar. Just states a million
[33:22] dollars. Pay to the owner or pay it to
[33:25] so and so name, right? A million
[33:27] dollars, right? Well, this check it came
[33:31] from the government,
[33:35] right? And it is if it is from the
[33:37] government, Amen. You're going to have
[33:40] to have what you're calling the
[33:41] controller of accounts signature or the
[33:44] governor or some person that owns the
[33:49] government financial institution with
[33:52] his signature and with a stamp on it. Or
[33:55] when you get this this check, you start
[33:57] to rejoice because you believe that you
[34:00] got money in your hand. You ain't seeing
[34:03] it, but you know it's written there.
[34:06] Amen. Hallelujah.
[34:09] Praise God. And you go about hollering
[34:12] and shouting and everything, but it's
[34:14] just a piece of paper.
[34:17] Amen.
[34:22] Hallelujah. But before that paper could
[34:26] have been printed, someone had to make a
[34:29] deposit.
[34:31] To back up that piece of paper.
[34:34] Amen.
[34:36] And if it's truly an official piece of
[34:38] paper, real. Amen. The money is already
[34:41] there in the bank. Amen. This is just a
[34:45] representation of what's there. Praise
[34:47] the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen.
[34:51] So God has placed a deposit in you,
[34:56] a representation of the greater things,
[34:59] of himself, of the full blessings of
[35:01] God. Amen. Hallelujah. in you.
[35:08] Treasures buried in earthn vessels.
[35:12] Hidden.
[35:14] Hallelujah. Ordinary looks so ordinary.
[35:17] Looks so simple. Just like a piece of
[35:18] paper could be brushed aside, pushed
[35:22] aside, trampled over. Amen. The greatest
[35:27] treasure. Amen. In anyone's life.
[35:31] Hallelujah.
[35:32] I don't care what you've done or what
[35:35] accusation Satan puts against
[35:37] [Music]
[35:39] you. You may have cancer. You may be
[35:41] sick in your body or some kind of demon
[35:44] is oppressing you. I don't care what you
[35:48] have. But I've got a message for you
[35:50] here
[35:52] tonight. There is pardon.
[35:55] Amen. There is grace. That's right.
[35:58] There is healing.

[36:02] love. Amen. There is peace and there is
[36:05] joy for you.
[36:07] Money can buy peace. That's right.
[36:10] Because you see it all over the world.
[36:12] Yes, Jesus. Billionaire,
[36:15] multi-millionaires seeking just peace in
[36:17] their mind. They take a gun and they
[36:19] just blow their brains out.
[36:21] They go drugs. They do everything else
[36:23] trying to find joy and peace. Amen. But
[36:26] only the prince of peace can give you
[36:28] real peace. Amen. That's right. Amen.
[36:31] Hallelujah.
[36:32] Yes, Jesus.
[36:34] You say why I'm so excited about this.
[36:38] Amen.
[36:40] For it is written, though your sins be
[36:43] as scarlet, they shall be white as snow.
[36:46] Amen.
[36:48] Come, let us reason together, says the
[36:50] Lord.
[36:53] There's forgiveness. There is nothing
[36:55] you can do that God can't forgive you.
[36:58] That's right. Amen. Amen.
[37:02] Hallelujah. Now, if you take a look
[37:05] right at this deposit for your healing,
[37:09] it was put in God's medicine cabinet.
[37:14] [Music]
[37:16] Amen. So, if you want healing
[37:19] tonight, go to God's medicine cabinet.
[37:22] There is a deposit that has been made
[37:25] there on your behalf. That's right.
[37:27] Amen. Amen.
[37:31] That was made on the day of Calvary.
[37:34] Amen.
[37:37] He was wounded for our transgressions.
[37:42] And with his stripes we were he
[37:47] past work.
[37:50] So go and claim what is rightfully yours
[37:53] tonight.
[37:55] Amen. Hallelujah. There may be struggle
[37:57] with something or some little thing in
[37:59] your body. Amen. It might be minor, it
[38:03] might be major. No matter what it is,
[38:05] pain in the back, pain in the legs,
[38:07] whatever heart pain, what kind of pain
[38:09] it is. Amen. It's already been paid for.
[38:12] Settle.
[38:14] Hallelujah. These things we need to be
[38:17] reminded over time and time again. Amen.
[38:19] Cuz when the pain come, you know, we
[38:21] just lie and we just, you know, like a
[38:23] wounded soldier in a corner just, you
[38:26] know, sulking and, you know, but we need
[38:30] to be reminded tonight what things God
[38:34] have the deposits that God has been
[38:37] placed in his bank. Amen. On your in
[38:42] your account that you can draw.
[38:46] Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, Lord. You got a
[38:49] bank account. Amen. And where is this?
[38:54] Chase. CIBC. No. Where your bank account
[38:58] is.
[39:00] The thieves go break in there. They go
[39:03] hold it up and take any day. They could
[39:04] just that could disappear where M and
[39:07] rot can enter in. Yes. And it's yours
[39:12] tonight. Amen. Hallelujah. The deposit.
[39:15] God's deposit that's made for you.
[39:20] Receive it. Hallelujah.
[39:22] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. And
[39:26] your healing has been bought and paid
[39:28] for and it's all yours.
[39:30] All you have to do is just reach out and
[39:33] get it.
[39:36] And that seems to be the hardest thing
[39:38] for people to do. Reach out and claim
[39:40] what is right for you. Because you know
[39:43] Satan will put every obstacle in your
[39:45] way to prevent you. Amen. He will block
[39:48] your mind to tell you it's not yours.
[39:50] That's right. Amen. It's not for you.
[39:53] Yeah. Look what you done. You didn't
[39:55] deserve that. You don't deserve healing.
[39:58] Look what you done. But you know he's a
[40:01] liar.
[40:02] Tell him he's a liar tonight.
[40:05] God's word is truth. And when you hear
[40:08] the truth, it's going to set you free.
[40:11] So whatever chain Satan is trying to
[40:13] bind you with tonight, tell him you get
[40:16] the hints. You're loose. You're free.
[40:19] Amen. Loose your mind. Yes, Lord. Amen.
[40:22] Hallelujah. Amen. Now, in order that
[40:26] people would see and know, God promised
[40:29] that he would send gifts.
[40:31] Is that right? Amen. And we spoke a
[40:35] little recently on our prayer night.
[40:37] Amen. The nine spiritual gifts that God
[40:39] has sent for us. It's all for us. It is
[40:42] for the believer.
[40:45] God's gifts are only for the believer.
[40:49] It's for those who can believe.
[40:53] It's not for the unbeliever. Amen.
[40:58] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. The Holy
[41:00] Ghost is not for those who do not
[41:02] believe in it. Amen. It's for those who
[41:04] believe in it. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[41:08] Well, you
[41:09] say when you read the Bible, what makes
[41:12] you carry on? So when you say he was
[41:15] wounded for our transgressions and with
[41:17] his stripes you were
[41:19] healed. When you say well whatsoever
[41:23] things you desire when you pray, believe
[41:26] that you have received it and you shall
[41:29] have it. Amen.
[41:31] Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Well, we should
[41:35] start rejoicing. Amen. Amen. Because if
[41:38] you believe that, you will start
[41:39] rejoicing.
[41:40] Hallelujah. How would you feel that
[41:43] someone wrote you a check and you went
[41:45] to the bank and you said NF? You know
[41:49] what that means? Sufficient funds. The
[41:52] back
[41:54] problem.
[41:57] Amen. How will you feel in your
[42:00] hand? Amen. If you work hard and the
[42:04] boss pay you and when you go to cash
[42:07] check not y nothing. Amen. But with
[42:12] God's back who could bank up God's back.

[42:17] It's in
[42:19] inexhaustible resources.
[42:22] Amen.
[42:23] Inexhaustible.

[42:28] tonight. Amen. That's right. How much
[42:30] you going to believe him for tonight?
[42:32] It's according to your faith.
[42:35] Amen. How much you going to believe for,
[42:38] you will receive it.
[42:40] Amen.
[42:41] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Well, you
[42:43] say, "Well, that's just words." But,
[42:46] brother, before that word to be written
[42:49] in the Bible, there had to be be a made
[42:52] there had to be a deposit made at
[42:54] Calvary.

[42:57] up there to take care of every single
[43:00] thing that you need.
[43:03] Amen. Yes, sir. Heaven and earth will
[43:06] pass away, but God's word will never
[43:08] pass. Can't fail. What he promised he
[43:13] shall do, must do. Amen. Hallelujah. And
[43:17] each of us has an
[43:19] accounting and we can draw of it next
[43:23] week, next year. When you going to draw
[43:27] it when

[43:34] there what you have need of. Amen.
[43:37] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[43:41] And the Lord is standing there. That's
[43:43] how the prophet put it. With a pen in
[43:45] his hand. That's right. Amen. Ready to
[43:50] write your forgiveness. Amen.
[43:54] ready to write your healing.
[43:57] Anything you have need of, he's ready to
[44:00] write it tonight. Yes, Lord. But you
[44:03] know something, you got to fill it out.
[44:05] That's right.
[44:08] He gave each and every one of us. Yes,
[44:11] Jesus. A blank checkbook.
[44:15] Imagine you get a blank
[44:17] checkbook signed by the creator
[44:20] himself.
[44:23] Imagine that. Think of it. A blank
[44:26] check. A million. What's that thing?
[44:29] Amen. A billion dollars. What's that
[44:31] thing? Amen.

[46:06] bar, but you're invited to come into
[46:08] God's holy presence, and he made a way
[46:12] for you to be here tonight.
[46:15] He was expecting you to be here tonight.
[46:19] Don't you believe that? Amen. Amen. He
[46:23] wanted you to come.

[46:51] time there was a little woman
[46:53] sat
[46:54] in. Amen. With an issue of blood for
[46:58] many many years she
[47:01] suffered. The blood was flowing from
[47:03] her. She couldn't get it
[47:06] stop. She spent all her life saving
[47:10] going from doctor to doctor. Amen. And
[47:14] they couldn't do any good for her.
[47:19] moving from church to church. Amen.
[47:22] Trying to seek to find
[47:26] satisfaction. Think about your own
[47:28] situation. How God met you.
