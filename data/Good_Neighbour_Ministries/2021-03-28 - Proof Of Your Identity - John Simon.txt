TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] thank god the sun is up it's sunday morning to give glory and praise to his great and glorious name thank god friday they placed him in the ground but sunday the day when he rose again no wonder it's not only s-u-n-d-a-y but it is s-o-n-d-a-y good sunday morning to you all may the lord bless you my brothers and sisters in christ loved ones of the dear and blessed lord jesus may he bless us together as we come together as one family in his name we are together again just praising the lord giving glory to his marvelous name once again we will read from our scriptures we will read from the book of acts chapter 19 verses 11 to 17. shall we read god's word now and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick and kerchiefs or aprons and the dis diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them then certain of the vagabond jews took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus saying we're journey by jesus whom paul preached and there were seven sons of one skiva a jew and chief of the priests which did so and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know and paul i know but who are you and the man in whom the evil spirit was leapt on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus and fear fell upon them all and the name of the lord jesus was magnified glory be to god let us pray righteous loving merciful heavenly father we adore thee we bow down before thee and we give these thanks and praise for this wonderful morning and for the grace that we are here to see another day and to worship you lord we ask your divine assistance we ask you to reveal yourself to us you being the word make known to us the treasures of the wisdom and the knowledge of the lord jesus christ and may you lord transfer this wisdom this knowledge this understanding this anointing this revelation of this name to your people profusely father may you pour out your holy spirit upon all they that will hear the word around the world whatever nation whatever land whatever time for your glory father to see be all the praise in jesus name as we lift him up to your glory amen praise be the god now we have just read from the book of acts this remarkable story about the seven sons of skiva we can clearly see that those devils that had possessed this man that they were attempting to exercise or cast the devil out of that these devils in this man knew jesus and they knew paul the absolutely knew who they were the question that was asked of the sons of skiva was a question of identification and that is what this sermon is going to be about proof of your identity proof of your identity that is of your spiritual identification and this is what these devils were inquiring of these sons of skiva about because they wanted to know who are you uh jesus we know he has a reputation in hell uh paul we know he has a a a reputation in hell but we've never heard your name we don't know you we don't recognize you there is nothing that we can recognize you by yeah there you see so their spiritual identification was questionable hence the question uh jesus i know paul i know they're clearly identified to us but what's the proof of your identity uh who are you you say you come in the name of jesus but do you have any mark do you have any proof do you have any uh anything to show us that we might know that you are indeed who you claim you are amen you see so they were asking for some proof of their spiritual identity before complying with their authority that they were attempting to exercise let me repeat that again these demons wanted to be certain about their spiritual identities before they would comply to their authority praise god it's just as if you are in the street and some no name person some guy some lady some anyone came up to you and we're trying to exercise the authority of a policeman and you will ask them who are you uh you're not in uniform you don't have any id or identification you have no number you have nothing by which i can identify who you are i am not saying i will obey the law but i need to see your identification this is what these demons were asking of these sons of skiva right who are you and they were supposed to be able to identify who they were praise god but there were not they were not certain of god they didn't know themselves who they were and here there were at this time being asked this question and that's what this sermon is about it's based on this question that was asked of the sons of skiva when they had no answer because they did not know who they were and they were guessing or presuming about what they were actually doing all they had was a name and it was a name that they had heard from someone else all they had was knowledge and proven detailed information documented information of someone else's supernatural experience my friends this is actually what is taking place today where people are basing their lives their ministries their churches and it's based my friends on their knowledge and they do know they may be prolific in their knowledge of what they know proven detailed documented information knowledge about this individual's supernatural experiences and the power of god the presence of the lord that moved individual which they might have seen on a video read in a book uh heard on a tape or watched it on television but you see they had not experienced that themselves they had no real knowledge of their own they were going by someone else's supernatural experience amen they had heard someone else preach but they had never surrendered to it so therefore they had no identification with it but yet they were still trying to use the authority credibility and anointing of that preaching they were trying to use that to be able to enhance them themselves the in the eyes of the public see they were testing testing and experimenting and presuming with the word of god that they had heard they were just presuming and experimenting with the word paul had preached and paul had used in prayer the name jesus that paul had used in expelling demonic powers out of those that were suffering blind deaf dumb crippled all manner of sicknesses and sorrows they had over and over seen and heard paul use the mighty name of jesus christ and they were now taking that very name of jesus and they were experimenting with it to see if by the use of this name which they thought was just the magic word that they could rebuke and expel demons successfully and build their so-called business for they were having it as a business well my friends every age and every generation must face this same challenge where the devil will come and challenge us after this message that we are claiming to preach we're planning to declare many are telling the wonderful marvelous uh heart-stopping stories of how god used the prophet william marion branham and indeed it's wonderful it's beyond human imagination or human intelligence it's god using a man beyond our imagination read the book a man sent from god read the book the 20th century prophet read my friends beyond the curtain of time when he was caught up into the presence of almighty god yes many of these things are beyond our human senses but here they my friends many today are going by the documented uh detailed knowledge all the available information about this our dear brother uh and prophet for this 20th century and basing their entire lives and ministries on that that they can take whatever is in there and use that presume about it guess about it my friends experiment with different parts of it trying to see if they will get the same effect as brother branham had not knowing this is not something you're and and and scheme and manipulate and prove or it's not some kind of a actor or something you have to learn or something you're going to find out or discover this is the real genuine last day power of god making itself manifest through the prophet of god through god's servant in this day in this hour or praise god's wonderful name so every age will have a face this challenge by satan as to who you are where you come from and where you are going proof of your spiritual identification are you are you a gene of god are you a germ of god you're origin is it after his kind are you after his seed are you one of his original thoughts are you one of the names written in the lamb's book of life from before the foundation of the world friends we are not here to promote ourselves amen and we must not just promote ourselves as disciples followers and heirs amen of anointed men of god who might have gone before of whom particularly i speak about this prophet because he is the gentile prophet for this generation that god sent to this hour to this people to call out the people for his name out of egypt spiritually speaking which is denominationalism come out of her my people found in the book of revelation come out of her my people because why god is going to judge her like he's stoned jesse bell like he made dogs lick her blood he said i'm going to judge her i don't want you to be a partaker of her judgments of her plagues that i'm going to bring upon her so come out dissociate yourself walk away from it and walk into the glorious liberty of jesus christ our lord hallelujah amen so we are not to walk around as if we are we are inherited something from the prophet of god we must not walk around as if we are here inheriting his power his life his holiness his walk anything whatsoever from him but certainly we must be like them we must live like them we must act like them walk like them satan is still saying today not just to those sons of skiva that were back there but he is still saying today in our day jesus i know paul i know william branham oh yes i know oh my uh william branham you mean the promised prophet of malachi chapter 4 verse 5 i i know him i had many a battle with william branham and in his meetings and i was defeated by him so many times i remember one time in the united states of america this little man five feet four i met him on a stage and i met him in the person of us of a above six foot 250 pound man under my influence of demon possession ran up to the platform with his hands outstretched his fingers like this ready to grab a hold of him and ran up to the platform on the pulpit and was about to grab him while saying these words i'm gonna break every bone in your body i'm gonna tear you limb from them and as he said that he was roaring he was going to tear brother branham limb from limb like that and as he ran up to the platform the deacons were about to go to restrain him but brother branham raised his hand as if to say no stand back and as the gentleman came up why shouldn't say gentleman as this fierce and ferocious demon-possessed individual accosted the prophet and about to grab a hold of him by the truth and to trackle him brother brenham stood there and said because you have challenged me as a servant of the living god in the name of jesus christ you must not you will now fall at my feet and he fall at your feet and he was carrying on like that about to grab him but the crowd noticed that he kept punching and he couldn't touch brother branham he wasn't touching him he tried grabbing and his hand couldn't grab a hold of nothing and after a while and before you know it he fell on his face at brother brandon's feet and then they took him and dealt with him afterwards yes william branham i know because i met him in germany he left america where he was born i don't know why he never stayed there but he flew all the way over to germany and was having meetings there and in those meetings i felt i'm gonna make a mess of these meetings and show him up for a fraud i'm gonna show him up that he's not a real prophet and so i got my wizards and my witches together and brought several of them into his meeting and they began and with their feathers and their smoke and their spells all of a sudden the wind started coming to that tent trying to lift it up and the skies become dark and the howling of the wind the crowd became scared and worried about this but brethren says no don't be afraid he turned to those witches and wizards and said in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost go from this place and stop you what you are doing they never even stopped they did not even have any s stoppage pause or anything when he used the name of father son and holy ghost he said then in the name of jesus christ i command you to cease what you are doing now let the winds go back and let the sun come out to shine glory to god hallelujah the winds the crowds heard the winds going and going back and all of a sudden out of the darkened mid-air the darkness daytime uh element came the light of the sun true glory to god and the meeting went on the devil was once again defeated so if satan were here he would say it william branham oh yeah i know i know him he left germany and went over there flew to sweden to finland and there in finland he had prophesied two years before that he saw this vision of a boy in the middle of the street with a bike dead and that god would use him to raise the dead from the middle of the street now brother branham was coming going to a meeting and while he was on his way to the meeting that was close to the russian border and at that time russian troops were on the walls and as he drove around the corner there was a was a boy lying in the middle of the street hit by a vehicle and was dead laying in the street and as he came some of the brethren who had that written in their bibles two years before looked and saw that it was the same scenery described by the servant of god he got out of the car and went to the boy laid his hands upon him the spirit of death in the name of jesus christ up comes the lad jumped up and without asking any question whatsoever he took his he had the wheel of a bicycle with the stick that he was running down the road and he just took that and up the road he went he delivered by the power of god from the grasp of death those russian soldiers on the wall began to weep and cry oh my if there's a god like that i'll believe that amen my friends yes so the devil said yes william branham i know amen but who are you who are you my friends we must pray like he prayed we must believe god like he believed god we must live like he lived and we must preach the word in faith like he preached the word of the living god hallelujah then and only then are we going to see the hand of god i tell you my br my brothers and sisters perfect faith cannot be inherited the power of the holy ghost the genuine anointing of god cannot be inherited genuine gifts and callings of god cannot be inherited there is no such a thing in the bible as apostolic succession there is no such thing in the bible as prophetic succession i'm quoting brother branham himself out of the seven church ages salvation is not passed on by natural birth any more than there is any truth to apostolic succession it is not in the word in the message call of the seven church ages again the ephesian church age oh how far have we wondered from the first church pentecost is nowhere in view and the word cannot be found apostolic succession which today abounds is not found in the word of god it is a man-made device it supersedes illegally the word of god the truth of god not man it for his god has set in the church not man has set their own leaders in the church but god has said in the church and not even the truth when they say peter was in rome peter was not even in rome so there is no such a thing as apostolic succession we are just surrounded by lies given by religious rascals vagabonds to the revealed word of god for this day and time amen yes sir i tell you when elijah and elisha were coming to coming at that time elisha already knew everything about elijah just like many of us today knows everything about brother branham the time he was born what happened they know him to the very detailed information about his life elijah knew all that about elijah for he was a servant but when elijah came to the jordan when he came to the gap when he had to cross from the ages into the capstone he did not need to impress neither god or satan of how much he knew about elijah but he did have to know god himself for himself he needed to know the lord god of elijah the jehovah of miracles he did not ask where is elijah he said where is the god of elijah hallelujah and he slapped the waters amen with the mantle that elijah o praise god had given unto him amen praise god and that was not a physic just a physical object it was a symbol praise god of the holy spirit that you needed to have if you want to do the things i did that's what elijah was trying to praise to him praise god hallelujah amen yes sir and so there is no such a thing as apostolic succession and when the train came god had to speak to joshua himself it was god who said to joshua in joshua chapter 1 verse 2 moses my servant is dead we might as well read this as saying william branham my servant is dead now you must arise and go over this jordan hallelujah if you have got to do it it's you that must cross this jordan by faith in god and by the leadership of the blessed holy spirit amen paul did not get his apostleship from peter he got it from god himself in the book of acts the bible tells us how god spoke in the night to the prophet ananias and said ananias rise go to the street called strength there you will find one paul one saul amen praise god i want you to go there lay your hands upon him baptize him in water in the name of jesus christ for he i will use as a light to the gentiles praise god he will bring the revelation he will bring the light of god's word to the gentile peoples of the world amen praise god paul was god's identified apostle and messenger to the first church age so that even peter the apostle peter deferred to paul in ii peter chapter 3 verse verses 15 and 16 peter speaks of things that paul speaks of that are hard to understand he even had a time he was wrestling along with what paul was saying amen so you see there was no apostolic succession paul was the messenger even though he came after peter amen the younger as with jacob anisa the younger was actually god's anointed servant and prophet for that generation and paul himself said i'm one born out of boot time amen but he was vindicated that he was the first church age messenger let me say it again there is no such a thing as apostolic succession on scriptural ungodly unholy and alive from the pit of hell look it is not enough for oh to be a natural descendant or even a spiritual descendant of a mighty man of god or even of this prophet of this generation is not enough my friends to think that by parenting and just saying the words and quoting the quotes that he has that we can inherit his anointing and his authority that he had over the devil and in the supernatural dimensions of this world amen let me tell you friends plainly you cannot inherit revelation revelation comes by grace you cannot inherit discernment discernment comes by the supernatural operations of the grace of god you cannot inherit any of these gifts or callings for they are given by god before repentance you cannot inherit inspiration you cannot inherit conviction that comes from god alone i quote that david duplici again god has no grandchildren amen my friends i don't want to hurt anybody here but what i have said and what i'm saying now but the reason people are so tossed about is because the church and individuals uh uh together has drifted away from the glory of the shechema of the living god amen they've drifted away from the glory of the revealed word of god for this day and hour shifted away from the pure anointing and power that flows out of that word hallelujah ichabod is now written above the doorposts amen and upon the signs of many of these denominations their glory is departed they have a name and that name only speaks of their glorious past but this is the point their glory that used to be there that were in the past was there that glory is departed and they're trying to milk it they're trying to live off of it they're trying to survive off of that my friends but it's gone it's passed away and we're living in another day and in another time there is an ongoing struggle among believers everywhere to just live holy to live pure to live righteous to live godly and to stand for god's word in this day and hour and it is a battle it is a fight because this struggle goes on there's a struggle in the lives of of the believers of god for this not only holiness but they're struggling to hold on to their to loyalty they're struggling to hold on to having a sense of christian responsibility many today are thinking that faithfulness is updated that you may even think this type of ministry and preaching is out of date it's old-fashioned and i'm proud to say it's the all-time holy spirit and the devil won't go near it that's the reason people fear it for it's good enough for me hebrews 11 they came with sheepskins and got skins that came them the monster my friends you would never think those would be man of god but those were the kinds of people god called on the scene to bring his word the most unlikely making the high places low and the law of places high amen praise god hallelujah amen yes believers want to claim christianity but have no accountability they take this kind of christianity that we are preaching today is an old-fashioned primitive type of christianity and it is because we what the original word the original holy spirit anointing the original moving of god damn the original revelation out of his word amen people today they they're in christ today and they're out tomorrow they are with this group today and oh they like it so they've gone to that group tomorrow church hopping like that all the time amen many of our young people have gone to church trying out their mother's faith or their father's faith but that doesn't work many have tried to live by being propped up by the preacher the cats tend to stand alone with god because there are like hot house tomato plants that's got to be propped up all the time and has got to be spread and protected from all kinds of bugs when the real plant is out in the wild there bearing the storms and the wind and the insects and everything else and they are rugged they are strong because they are god planted them there and when god really plants a christian a real believer they are rugged saints of god that can stand the very test of time hallelujah amen many try to live by the preachers convictions live amen by brother branham's faith by his visions by his convictions but that would work my friends you are facing a real devil that is here today and you can not sell your ship with yesterday's breeze take up about it my friends you've got to have your own moment of enlightenment your own flesh of inspiration god has got to give you divine enlightenment amen of revelation and heartfelt conviction out of his divine word for yourself this is the end times this is the evening time the sun is going down darkness is everywhere and is covering the land and neither god nor satan will let you get away with anything else than personal faith conviction and revelation from god where you are certain of who you are and then satan will begin to obey your authority but if you don't know who you are you have no revelation of who you are you have no seed you have no anchor amen no credibility in hell no reputation in hell the devil will not give you the time of day but when you say i come in the name of jesus you come in the character you come in the stature you come with the person of christ in you hallelujah you're not talking about him christ in you your hope of glory greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world now the devil starts to turn around break screech scream and demons scream and come out at the word of god the power of the holy ghost cancers are coughed up amen they go from the people amen sicknesses disappear why not because of you but because christ is on the scene the pillar of fire is here amen and he is able to cross the miles i don't care where you are you can be six thousand miles away from here there is no distance with god there is no distance in prayer there is no distance in the anointing if thou canst believe all things are possible to them that will believe the word of god accept the promise accept the word of god rise and be healed in the name of jesus christ trust him believe him amen o man of blind receive their sight may the deaf hear amen praise god whatever is the desire of your heart and i give it to you in the name of jesus christ our lord receive it if you can believe you'll have it then tell and testify of the goodness and the grace of almighty god hallelujah amen the devil is not afraid of just your saying jesus but it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble it's his life behind your name that makes the demons tremble may god live behind your skin oh my god may the same god that was living back on the badger skin goat skin sheepskin that were hanging in the veil of the temple may god use you as his veil for this hour and live behind your skin and manifest himself and there my friends is real christianity not you trying to be a christian or trying to live right or trying to be good but the life of god in me the life of god in you the life of christ living through you and manifesting and projecting his own self through you that is god interpreting his own life and his own word and making himself known to this generation that he is the same yesterday today and forever praise god hallelujah oh praise god the name of jesus i know paul i know but you you are here now the uh you know jesus paul isn't here you are here now william branham isn't here you are here now amen i know that but who are you well praise god if you are a true child of god you can say i come in the name of jesus christ hallelujah i rebuke you in the name of jesus christ oh my i have done so myself many times and seen the mighty hand of god manifest and declare itself well praises name is the same yesterday today and forever only believe for all things are possible to them that will believe amen in this day this generation i believe right now that we have got to come to grips with this message of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelation 10 1 to 7 hallelujah we are my friends the children of the living god i believe we are in the last generation of these ages of the church i'm not talking about the end of the world you've still got to have the tribulation you've got to have israel come to power you've got to have the two witnesses come back there's many other events that must take place eschatologically there are things that must come to pass i'm speaking about the church i'm telling you we are not the pepsi generation we are not the cult generation we are not the ex-generation we are the joshua generation we are the rapture generation oh praise god forevermore this is the hour and the day in which we are living here hallelujah praise god so those men made their claims rebuked the devil and the devil sprang on them and tore their clothing and kicked them out of the house in which they were yes jesus i know paul i know but i identify yourself oh you can't identify yourself then i'm going to throw you out of here amen my friend if the devil would get a chance to look into your heart amen will he be able to see jesus there will he be able to recognize that you are you are in dwelt you are filled you're anointed with the person in the presence of jesus christ himself and that when you speak you can not be denied for it is christ in you the hope of glory amen glory to god hallelujah they stood dog dumb they could not give an answer they were mad a laugh in stock in front of the public there were religious church members their father was a chief priest and yet the devil made a laughing stock out of them we got to be careful in our day and in our time regardless of who we are today amen but friends i want to thank god in the midst of the confusion oh there is a real true church of god and there are few in number but take god that church is marching to the drum beats of the word of god i don't know what you hear but do you hear what i hear oh praise god we're marching to the rhythm of god's holy word brother branham some time ago saw the church of god as a bunch of young women well dressed holy clean righteous marching to the sound of music amen and when they march with the sound of music like that the first group was so dressed they were so half naked dressed there my friends sex exposure clothing on and they marched to the top of the hill and when they got to the to the very cliff they fell right down into the canyon the gulf that was below he began to cry he said lord all these years of preaching and is this what the church world is is this what i have produced and while he was crying he heard music coming again oh and when he looked it was another group of young women but these were properly dressed modestly dressed marching to the sound of the music that they were marching though oh thank god god still has a a triumphant church marching to the sound of the gospel and the power of the word of god hallelujah and he watched them march to the very cliff of the hill and then instead of going down this set march right on up into the skies i'm believing it's the true believers of this generation that will be raptured out of here by the grace and power of almighty god o blessed be the name of the lord glory to his marvelous name amen that we will we are able in this day to fight against satan and prevail against him by the by the word of god the blood of our of the chest and blood of jesus christ our testimony and the name of the lord jesus christ hallelujah amen praise god we live in an age where people are so unstable and tossed about going wherever the biggest name preacher is they want to get into the biggest convention or the biggest camp meeting chasing after all manner of attractions religious attractions oh the biggest singing group is coming to town the best singers that run after that after the best singers and seeing groups that can find right in this message i'm talking about oh yes sir oh praise god where the biggest church is they are there wherever they have the best of everything they are there wherever they're getting the largest crowds they are there amen we've got to be careful that like eve we are not charmed by satan dressed up in an expensive suit of religion all friends back to the word back to the promised word of this day and of this hour amen oh my friends we live in a day when people have no root to them root you see the most important thing in the tree is its roots doesn't matter how beautiful that tree is the true tree has to have roots if you want to be a real christian you must be rooted and grounded in jesus christ our lord praise god hallelujah you you're not a vagabond you're not the run around you're not a butterfly christian flying from flower to flower church to church or flying around like that you are rooted you are grounded you are stable when god calls you out you come out but then you are stabilized by the anchor of his divine word now with christianity comes responsibility there comes loyalties and we need to be loyal in this time we need not justice here i believe i believe in jesus you need to be long you must believe and then you must be long praise god hallelujah my friends if you're a real true christian your lawyer your love and your loyalty for jesus christ your lord and your savior is what you must display you must also have love and loyalty towards your local pastor as your spiritual leader as the bible tells us we must give them double honor for they are they that watch for our watch for our souls amen we must have love love and loyalty for our local church amen and we show that love and loyalty by our regular attendance we show that love and loyalty by our faithful support financial and otherwise amen we show our love and loyalty by our defense and protection of our local church protecting it and defending it for the glory of the living god doesn't matter how beautiful the church is no matter how beautiful the tree is doesn't matter how beautiful and righteous that christian so-called christian person is they must have deep roots within christ in the word of god and the revelation of this hour so that they will not be blown away by the storms we cannot trade away the power of god or water down the promise of this age we cannot have a faith that has no backbone to it but one that rests upon the unchanging word of the living god we cannot put our faith in some spiritual denominational monstrosity contrary to the word of god and the promise of this day we must stand by god's word hallelujah amen let my friends as i'm i'm now concluding i want to encourage you with all my heart to hold to the absolute truth that you are hearing put down some deep roots praise god hallelujah like paul said i'm transplanted i'm a one born of the due time god maybe transplanted you maybe you were born out to do time but now you are here under the watering of the word of the holy spirit put down some deep roots so you can be rooted and grounded in jesus christ and hold to god's unchanging hand o to god's unchanging hand oh to god's unchanging hand amen build your hopes on things eternal and hold to god's unchanging hand may the lord bless you heavenly father as the word has gone forth i pray father you will strengthen believers you will save those who need a genuine salvation baptizing water those that need the correct baptism not in the titles of father son and holy ghost but in the true christian baptism of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ may they have it father may you fill them with the holy spirit by giving them a moment of epiphany and opening of the word lord making
