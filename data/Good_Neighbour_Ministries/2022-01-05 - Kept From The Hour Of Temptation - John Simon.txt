TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the lord praise the lord let the earth hear his voice praise the lord praise the lord let the people rejoice oh come to our great eternal father in the presence of our god let us approach him by the way of prayer and of the word of god here we are again praising the lord worshiping his great name and proclaiming the gospel around the world and wherever we are in the book of revelation is found our scripture in revelation chapter 3 verse 10 and our subject is the hour of temptation the hour of temptation and may the lord bless us all as we go into these things of god today oh gracious heavenly father as we surrender our hearts and lives to thee may the great holy spirit draw near once again settle down upon us with the jew of heaven that they hidden life might be expressed all lord receive your glory honor and praise and be thou lifted up in the wonderful marvelous victorious name of jesus christ our beloved lord amen i read our scripture in revelation chapter 3 verse 10 because thou has kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth amen what a blessing to be even reading from this book and the to receive the light of understanding from the word of god because thou has kept the word of my patience i will also keep thee from the hour of temptation god is saying simply if you will i will he is saying if you will keep my word then i will stand uh by you i will you stand by my word and i'll stand by you you keep my word and i will keep you or preserve you through this time of temptation that is coming up on the face of the earth now we know and realize as i was just reading this morning of a new development of a beautiful motor car being made that can now go a thousand miles on one electric charge and it can do it at top speed we are certainly living in an age of speed and uh we see it in planes they're getting faster we see it in cars faster there we see it in the rockets they're shooting to the moon and everywhere that we can find and when we think even the blazing fast speed of our internet that we are receiving today we are left absolutely amazed by what we are beholding as we see prophecy being fulfilled taking place emerging right before our very eyes yes indeed we're living in an age of instant everything instant the we love in our day because of this motivation and this culture of speed and haste and hurry and hustle and bustle as the scripture prophesied that would be in this day that it shall come to pass men shall go to and fro to and fro god prophesied that already in his word prophesied in the book of daniel how there will be cars in the streets and they will be running on something called highways and they will have car lights eyes brighter than the eyes of dragons you see that's all they knew at that time so that's how they can express it but we understand that that prophet looked ahead in time and saw cars he said i see them jostling chariots jostling in the streets traffic jams men women running to and fro everywhere uh the bible tells us so we are living in an age of speed and of instant everything we have no patience we are in a hurry we want to get there fast we we we want to have our breakfast we oh we can't wait uh like the old days where they boiled oats or they boiled something and they have to wait and put in the spices and wait until it's done no we want to be able to quickly put some um cereal in a bowl pour some hot water on it and right away everything puffs up everything is just opened up and there you go you have instant cereal we want to have breads instant even our coffee no time to boil brew and all of that you know and even if we do say we brew it's a quick brew it's better be fast or it's going to be left right there none of this boiling and straining and whatever else and waiting for it to properly brew itself like that no we have to have it uh coming through a machine where we can have instant coffee instant tea instant hot chocolate everything has to be speed with fast why because we live in an age of constant pressure and pressure is upon us in every possible way and a pressure that we must let off well we as believers believe we let off that a lot of that pressure by our faith in the word of god and by prayer in the presence of god oh meditation in the presence of god we let we let off the pressure we heal our hurts and we let go our fears and all the things we forgive and free ourselves from the attachments of this life and of this earth and let off the pressure the bands of evil that tried to bind and constrict our minds and we are set free by the grace of almighty god god is saying in his word if you keep my word i will surely keep you oh my brother my sister friends wherever you are do all you can to read your bible read your bible pray every day and let the god of heaven keep you as he you keep his word the way you know how to what level you know how what god has revealed to you keep that and god will keep you as he has promised amen god is saying let me bring you into our time if you have safeguarded the word that you have received all believers of this message if you have safeguarded this message that you have received a man within your heart if you have driven away the birds on the on your hearts altar of sacrifice as our father abraham did these evil thoughts these uh demonic inspirations suggestions and evil that will come to your mind to drive god out of your thoughts to put the word out of your thoughts some trouble some trial some person that disturbs your peace of mind oh you stood by the word you stand by the word and god said if you drive the birds away if you cast away these things from your heart and cast your cares upon me oh praise god he'll stand by you heal all you in his mighty hand and preserve you and protect you in this time of trouble and trial he will keep you there in his great love amen god's word in us is a rich deposit of truth hallelujah which we have received from heaven above when we thank god for it amen hallelujah and god is trusting you and i as believers that we will keep and preserve the truth of god within our hearts and not lose it not lose it by the cares of life by the pull of prosperity not by the attractions of the and pleasures of the things of this world but that we keep the truth keep the word of god that god has placed within your heart and within your soul o blessed be his name don't you lose that pearl of great price don't you lose the pearl of great price but oh my friends this treasure we have of the rev revelation hallelujah of the word of god within your heart and within your soul god is saying hold on to this pearl of great price hold on to it preserve it keep it within your heart this treasure that you behold within our orton orton vessels in our bible we are told by the lord jesus christ himself how that a certain woman her husband went far away from home of course a symbolic type of the bride and jesus christ or you may want to say the church and jesus christ and the husband goes out of town as jesus has gone to heaven and left his bride behind and here she is she's keeping house and back in the eastern days look and maybe even to this day in some countries because of the culture instead of a ring on the finger there were a band of of coins on a chain on the top of their head on their forehead and the loss of one of those coins are to put it this way if that woman was found unfaithful unclean in any way the priest would take away one of those coins so that on his return when the husband comes he'll find one of the coins gone and realize what acts actually happened in his wife's experience in this case this woman lost the coin right in the church right in the house in her own house she lost that coin and god is saying to us keep the word don't lose the word don't drift from the revelation of the word but stank firmly by the truth until the crown you gain hold to the god's unchanging hand don't swerve to the left nor to the right but you're not your trust in kings horses rich men powerful men men of persuasion uh men of influence but put your faith in your trust in the unfailing realities of the revealed word of god for this day and time for let every man be a liar and let god's word be the truth this woman lost the coin the bible says she did not just sit down and weep and cry but she began to clean up her house as we ought to clean up our lives she started to scrub and and use her broom and dust and everything else searching for the coin wherever it might be lost wherever you might have lost some coin out of your experience out of your life your walk with god i'm praying and i'm asking god and i'm speaking to you now and saying oh my dear brother my dear sister may the holy spirit speak to your heart speak to your life and may you be able to recapture oh the fervency of your first love all the the graft the great desire that you have had for god the passionate love that you had for your husband christ the word may the great holy spirit of the living god speak to our hearts tonight and may he my friends bring us back to the place where we said lord i'll stand by your word and god answers if you will i will if you will stand by the word i will keep you i will preserve you in the hour of temptation that lies right ahead now what does the bible mean when it says the hour this word patience he says you know in hebrews 6 13 to 15 and i'd like to read that for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear no greater he swore by himself in other words he used himself as the guarantor there was no one else greater than he that could guarantee his word his promise what it is that he wanted to accomplish amen saying surely blessing i will bless thee that's a promise to abraham and to abraham's seed and multiplying i will multiply thee and so after that he abraham had patiently enjoyed he obtained the promise you see praise god the spirit of god is speaking about the word of god which is given to us but we must learn not to just rush around rush about expecting everything to happen instantly instant porridge instant ancestor prayer instant healing instant miracles we have gotten ourselves into a a cycle where we expect everything instantly and we do not give god the chance to work a miracle we do not or give ourselves the chance to become still that we might know that he is god oh my friends he the word of my patience keep the word of my patience and so we understand that this patience is speaking off is to have the patience to endure while you are waiting on the fulfillment of the promise that is within the word of god hallelujah amen oh my i tell you friends let us endure let us persevere let us hold fast and let us wait upon the lord that we might mount up in a rapture with wings like eagles hallelujah or praise god forevermore this is the way god teaches his people about patience using abraham as an example of how to endure and have patience wait for the promise that god will fulfill his word in a physical manifestation amen that's what we always want to believe instant everything when abraham could wait for 25 years before he could have the son of the promise when he could wait on god to fulfill his word listen friends every time we pray in this age the instant after we pray we expect a physical manifestation that her eyes can see we can feel and we can testify to that we got the answer when we breathe and we don't learn patience that way amen we could have more patience in life if we learn to wait on god in the book of hebrews chapter 11 verse 17 it reads by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac hallelujah you see he had patience and if you want to know more about patience you can listen or read the sermon the stature of a perfect man and have a full understanding on what patience is may god help us everyone here today and so after i want you to see this now after god fulfilled his promise he had waited for 25 years now here comes the son he has the son and after he has the answer to that promise in his hands god said go to the mountain sacrifice it sacrifice isaac the very thing you prayed for believed for endured for have patience for and now it's here and now god's asking you to lay it down at his feet once again and as humans many times you don't want to let go you just got the blessing you don't want to let go oh my you see abraham was tried after he received the word of promise most people think that before once we pray in the name of jesus over the promises of god that there could be no trial anymore after we receive our answer but the word tells us abraham was tried after he received the promise of god and that is exactly true just as it was with joseph that the bible tells us in psalm 105 verse 19 the word of the lord tried him the word tries the word will try a believer that way so that they can build up for their faith and their patience to be able to continuously receive great exceeding wonderful promises out of the word of god from time to time we pray and we get the answer but we must learn to receive patience within our souls and by patience we will be able to possess and control the life you now live on this earth and the life to come but with patience you possess your soul and we begin to lose your soul lose yourself when you're caught up in the the tizzy dizzy uh things of this life and you're carried away by them and you've come out of focus off center and your foundations are are shaken and you are left out there not certain of god listen my friends god says because you have taken my word and hereby you have become patient because you are held to the word and never swerved to the left and the right i will keep you from the hour of temptation which shall come upon the earth to try the purpose of that hour of temptation is to try them that dwell upon the earth my friends that is a promise that speaks about the ending of the gentile dispensation which will finally consummate or or uh it will come to its climax at that time through the bride being caught up in a rapture and when the bride is caught up in the rapture the tribulation officially begins because i believe as we talked before edges overlap and while one is coming in another is going out so while the bride is going up in coming going out of here the tribulation is coming in and when you look at the systems the events the atmosphere on the face of the earth you realize that the tribulation is already coming in its influences it's darkness it's penchant for sin for evil the poison spawning wickedness everywhere and at the same time the bride of christ these are they who washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb and they will walk with him through this world in white even though that spirit of tribulation is already here and works and is working within the hearts and minds of the children of disobedience oh my and that is why god says terrible time is coming a time of trouble is coming a time of tribulation is coming a time of severe temptation is coming but you have my promise anchor your soul to the word of god if you have his promise you make him that type host of your soul oh the anchor of your heart so that when the buffeting and the trials and the tribulation and the storms of life will come you are anchored in jesus and the storms and temptations of life you'll brave amen you'll overcome because of his presence power in your life and in your the patience that you have to endure the mockings the scoffings and all the other things that went on you held to god's word you're holding to god's word and let us continue to hold to the promise of the word of god in the midst of it all listen to the word of god i will keep thee this is a promise this is god speaking this is not an earthly king not just any man speaking but the eternal suffering god is speaking and saying i with all my power with all the hosts of heaven with all the armies of god with all the supremacy i will keep thee from that hour of temptation hallelujah amen my friends many interpret that scripture to say the church will go through the tribulation but i'm here to disagree with that and to tell you the true bride church of jesus christ shall not go through the tribulation let me repeat their true elected bride church of jesus christ shall not go through the tribulation period for they missed it he did not say i will keep thee in the hour of temptation so that you can go through it but the scripture says i will keep thee from the hour of temptation you will not even be able to pass through that we will come right up to the tribulation we will come right up to that hour of temptation and when it comes and tries to overtake or take us up they're not going to close us up because we're going up in a rapture in grace of the lord jesus christ hallelujah this temptation my friend will be exactly like the temptation eve had in the garden of eden when she was tempted by satan not some figment of the imagination not some mythological being with a fork tail and horns but a a snake a character looking like a man but with the nature and spirit and cunning and subtlety of a snake he's a snake a liar murderer and cheat to begin with and we are supposed to be tested and tempted by that evil spirit being embodied in human flesh again meeting him meeting the church face to face to tempt her as he tempted eve the temptation then we will not now discuss but to show everything morphs everything changes everything progresses to its magnification and it comes to its fullness so when we look here in the word of god amen we find out that just as she was tempted by something that seemed as if it would give her more freedom and give her more light actually in fact it seems so reasonable to her and from the standpoint of human thinking it will seem to be so right and everything else so enlightening and life-giving that this time when satan brings it he will not just fool one individual woman but he will deceive the entire world but thank god these whose those whose names are written in the lamb's book of life from before the foundation of the world the bible says they shall not be deceived the bible tells us that it is impossible for him to deceive the elected now in the word of god the prophet of malachi 4 william marion branham by revelation through the anointing of the holy spirit has made known to us clearly how this temptation will come about and that is what i'm now presenting to you that you may have a crystal clear understanding that my friends this ecumenical move that has already started it seems like a blessed thing for the church naturally speaking it seems like a wonderful thing for the church beautiful it even seems on the surface as a scriptural thing that christians ought to want desire and follow but don't be fooled by it and elect will not be fooled by it but can see in it nothing but a trap that is set right there certainly they present themselves saying we want to be agents to fulfill our lord's prayer which when he prayed saying o father let them be one even as you and i are one you see they're they're believing by taking that scripture and then trying to get the church to come into one world church they will be fulfilling the word of god but but god doesn't need the so-called righteousness of man to fulfill or bring about his word i also want to point to the fact because they have no revelation of the true oneness of god their idea of having one world church is on a false foundation to begin with here my friends that there might be one we find out to accomplish that they will work themselves into a position to become politically strong while the elect is running from politics they are going to behind the scenes appearing religious but mingling and mixing and blending themselves into politics out there which the bible tells us and teaches us whoa politics is of the devil satanist behind it it's based on lies and deceit yes that is the word of god but they will mix themselves and are mixing themselves and are already mixed into politics in every way and they are growing themselves that they might become so strong in politics so that they may bring pressure on the governments of the world and cause them i use the word cause here but you can use the word and pressure them prod them or my friends push them as they did with the crucifixion of jesus to cause all men to join with her the false church the false vine the one world church yes and to join her directly or in directly by adhering to certain principles that they will lay out and draw up and and show or give to governments because as religious authorities they will present that to them governments will accept it uh because these are supposed to be religious authorities and they will have these governments enact them or pass them effectively into law so that they can enforce them so that no body no people no organization no group listen this is prophecy prophecy and progress this is the word of god fulfilling itself we're looking at it now and we look ahead and we see the ripening of the fruit until it rots no one will be recognized no group will be recognized as actual churches until they come under the direct influence of all the principles and objectives of this false church that claims to create a one world church so here we see a prophecy of church the church the world the world system of churches denominational churches rising to a place of political power so as to influence the law making and church recognition by their great power influence and pressure that they will and are bringing to bear upon various governments into the world but thank god the elect is not left in the dark for a prophet has spoken the voice of god for these last days warned us ahead of time shine the light in the darkness of his dizzy trap that he is setting to catch the those that are not watching what is going on we have been warned a light has been shined a light of prophecy from the mount of the prophet of malachi 4 shining upon this wicked trap set my friend's hair upon the earth or in the ground oh but thank god the elect will not be fooled by leaves of religion spread on the ground cover that spot spread on the twigs and on the brambles as to make it look natural but the eyes of the elect on the inspiration and revelation from the word of god coming from the storehouse of the prophet of malachi 4 5 they see the trap and they will not be deceived but they will hold to god's unchanging hand the church world is headed to religious domination church domination and their council their evil so-called council my friends will not allow little groups small groups who differ from them will lose their charters lose any recognition lose licenses lose rights and privileges there they will even come to the point of persecution which they will not call persecution they will call it keeping the law like they did when they crucified jesus they were crucifying a criminal they were just keeping the law but they were crucifying their word and here my friends they will come down to the point where churches will even lose their property they will lose spiritual rights and when i say lose spiritual rights they lose their spiritual rights to even speak to people about faith religion born again holiness jesus christ one god original sin the truth of god's word the trace and the serpent right down to his tricky uh business that he is doing in this hour you will lose your right to speak the truth of the word of god you will not be able to preach nor teach to other people the things that we have learned oh my friends as it was with the apostles so will it be with the bright church of jesus christ in this last day for as soon as they had the great revival up there at pentecost came out of pentecost walked into what i would say walk into a an eternal day the eighth day and as they walked out right in front of the church right in the shadows of the cathedrals there lay a man that was sick and crippled up could not walk god's way could not walk and he was they left him there a beggar passing in and out left him a beggar oh and he asked for help for peter and paul silver they said to him sir sir uh a copper a copper if i can have a copper well to show you these preachers were not uh preachers of great elegance dignity man of luxury man of money they said silver and gold we have none in other words listen sir we are broke shall i repeat that it's in your bibles in your scripture where peter and john said sir we are broke but such as we have we give to you in the name of jesus christ rise and walk hallelujah and you know the rest of the story the bible tells us that he leapt up he ran he shouted and the crowds began to gather and the news began to spread abroad of the mighty works that god has done for he like 40 years old and he was like that condition from the time of his birth and here he was shouting and running and praising god and the leaders the religious leaders of that day as will the religious leaders of this day while this word this message sermons of this character from not just myself many men of faith that stand by the word of god and the promised god of god for this hour we may even say things differently but we're looking ahead there's a rapture coming there's a tribulation coming israel's revival rise of the red heifer back to the third temple the power of god the coming of the lord jesus hallelujah second coming oh my friends i tell you great things lies ahead in these days that we are living in let's look to the word of god but just as they did to the apostles back there for setting the people free as we set people free by them coming to know the truth or have a revelation of the truth oh my what did they tell them they did not rejoice with them and say oh praise god people are are being set free their eyes are being opened god is revealing himself no they don't want you to see they don't want you to read your own bible for yourself they want to to interpret it for you and speaking in an unknown language or tongue and then you really don't know what you heard or what you receive my friends back then the bible said we can't deny that these things happened but all we can do is at least block them or stop them from going about preaching in the name of jesus so they're called the apostles and they issued that trust and that threat hangs about above the bride church of this last day like a cloud if it's not evident it's coming it's coming like the sick darkness of egypt it's coming the angel of death is surrounding everywhere don't you preach no more that one god doctrine don't you preach about eve in the garden of eden and her original sin that it was not her eating an apple but having sexual affair with the serpent who was in the form of a man until then he was cursed and be made into what we know as a snake oh god have mercy don't you preach such things don't you preach about one god when we are teaching uh that there is three and and miraculously they become one when the bible tells us hero is real the lord thy god is one lord one lord hallelujah and that lord that god made himself a flesh body not another god but he came into god in flesh appearing jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever to walk amongst men and be called emmanuel god with us oh blessed be the name of the lord so i'm showing from the word of god i'm preaching from the things that were left in the storehouse and i'm telling you that we will be obstructed hindered and even jailed for speaking the truth of the word of god that has been restored to us as the apostles were in the book of acts chapter four you may read all about this in the book of acts chapter four yes my friends right now just for you to be able to do certain religious uh responsibilities and things you must receive their so-called registration and for just a little window of time we may be able to get by with with having this registration having this permission having that having that on the edges of it all but the time is coming and is almost here when it will be strictly enforced that you must be a part of them must be a part of their group or you cannot have it and you will not be able to carry on any religious things and orders whatsoever but you will be pushed out effectively decimated and made powerless humanly speaking right now the local ministerial association has to approve you and dare you say you are not a trinitarian dare you press press the fact that you believe in one god they'll kick you out they'll have nothing to do with you they will not register you they will not help you to get certain uh uh risk positions of power yes sir even now we know there's certain government buildings certain corporate buildings you can't rent you can't have them unless you are some registered group or person you cannot have it to become a chaplain in the jails hospitals army you have to be registered with a trinitarian group or you will not be allowed not to say one or two that are believing that full truth may slip through the net their net but i'm telling you the r is coming it's going to be so tight none will be allowed in or through or be able to operate in those positions whatsoever amen it will become so mandatory until it will be recognizable and acceptable oh my to all these trinitarian groups that are existing are here today pressure pressure on who pressure on the bride pressure on the people there it is and as that pressure increases it'll be harder and harder for groups for individuals pastors preachers teachers evangelists to resist it anymore or else they will lose their privileges their tax privileges their religious privileges they'll lose it all it'll all disappear and so many will be captain i will keep thee from that hour of temptation that will come and is coming upon the face of the earth many will be tempted my friends to go along if you can't beat them join them that's what a lot of them will begin to think and so they will feel it's better to serve god publicly amen in the framework of that or coming organization than not to serve god at all publicly but they air they are in total spiritual and religious and christian era to the word they are like eve in the bible believing the devils lie oh my friends and they began not knowing that you already switched their service to satan appearing as an angel of religion of light and of god and they may even raise him up in the temple and worshipping us god even want to call him jehovah my but the elect will not be deceived those whose names were back in the very genes of god mine of god and are down here on this earth in a human body with divine purpose for the glory of god to bear witness to the promised word for this age for the the furthermore will be kept not just from the hour of temptation that shall be kept from the image of the beast amen because my friends that temptation will morph that temptation my friends will transform itself they try to transmute the old alchemists from dirt into gold they're going to transmute this movement of one world church into one world order one great image to the beast let's not speak of the image danielle saw those things you can do yourself searching in the word of god amen my friends coming that image comes with fullness and here it is that image erected to the beast it will not affect the bride of christ because he promised i'll keep you from not in or during but from the hour of temptation and so the bride will be caught up in a rapture in the presence of the lord all thanks be to god we already have an escape route we have my friends a way made for us we can start right now climbing jacob's ladder from earth to glory into the very presence of almighty god this delightful wonderful winsome moment of love when all my praise god when rahab met isaac in the fields here comes the bride who meets jesus in the air by his rapture in grace and power hallelujah brought there by the holy spirit amen let me tell you what started out as a little seed of evil in the in the ephesian age will now raise its head as the monster of satan to defile on his defiling and will deceive the whole world amen for the world system we see out there of the catholic church and the president's protestant church systems merging melting blending together forming this great monster and i tell you they will control the wealth of the entire world prophecy again from the prophet of malachi 4 5 right straight from the storehouse amen yes sir they'll control the wealth of the entire world system hallelujah and that will be a trap because then men and women churches will be tempted by the religious recognition trap they will be tempted by their wealth trap oh the the the pull for them to join that system just let me attach myself to that system and i'll become wealthy and the wealth will pass through my life my hands let me attach myself i got recognition i'll be recognized you see the great hour of temptation by being with that system but let me tell you my friends that system will begin to kill them amen by refusing them privileges of buying and selling whereby they could make a living in other words it will kill them physically it will kill their businesses it also will kill out their churches it will destroy their way of making a livelihood yes this spirit is already here upon the face of the earth and beginning to do these things in such a cunning way on the different names that makes it look and seem reasonable and acceptable but it's a work of the devil it's satan already working and moving up on the face of the earth my friends yes rome already has acquired an israel acquiring most of the gold of the earth you say oh the church rome doesn't have it but let me tell you they're doing it under so many names like a hydra headed monster that you are not aware that they're sucking and vacuuming all the gold of the earth is going to roam yes and they will control all the supplies of gold and they're close to it if not already on the other hand the jews have all the bonds all the paper mortgages everything else in their system and we find out after a while rome wanting to have supremacy will begin to call in all the paper and began to demand gold oh my let me tell you my friends in other words they're gonna smash the present world money system and that's going to fall with a great crash but they have to have destruction before reconstruction and so they have to destroy it and they'll reconstruct it in their own image yes my friends oh and as that system falls i tell you with that system falling the jews jewish people will be trapped with all their wealth all their human wisdom they will be trapped but they will see it beneficial to themselves to come into an uneasy alliance with rome they won't want to do it they'll do everything to avoid it but they will come into an uneasy alliance with rome and then that harlot church called mystery babylon mother of harlots will take over the world she will take it over it's in your bible it's spoken by the 20th prophet 20th century prophet william marion branham in this day in this hour it's already been spoken and now it must come to pass and it is now prophecy in progress may the lord bless you my friends i trust this has been strengthening enlightening and also shining a light on the dark corners of life that lies ahead god bless you as you shine a light on your pathway as you walk through the dark of lodesia may god bless you we'll come again together on on sunday morning in the church building in the house of god where we will come to have a time to speak about the things of god next wednesday we'll be here again to continue on these marvelous wonderful and thrilling topics that god has placed in his word for us not to titillate our natural human taste not to play on our palate my friends not to itch our ears or cause us to uh just move our feet our toes but to stir our hearts and bring us back to a clear recognition of the word of god god be with you god bless you and preserve you what till we come and meet again [Music] you
