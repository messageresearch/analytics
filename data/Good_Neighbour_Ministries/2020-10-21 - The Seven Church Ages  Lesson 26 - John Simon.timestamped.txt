[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good evening friends
[0:15] and thank you for being here what a
[0:18] great honor
[0:19] to be here with you in the presence of
[0:22] the living god
[0:24] hallelujah now uh
[0:27] my talk today will be
[0:30] brief and to the point
[0:33] and trusting that god will use it
[0:36] to bless your heart and your life
[0:41] glory to his marvelous name
[0:44] we shall read out of the book of
[0:47] revelation
[0:48] chapter 2 verse
[0:51] 7 let us read out of the blessed word of
[0:55] god
[0:57] he that had an ear to hear
[1:00] let him hear what the spirit
[1:04] saith unto the churches
[1:08] to him that overcome commit
[1:12] will i give to eat of the tree of
[1:16] life which is
[1:19] in the midst of the garden
[1:23] of god now may god bless
[1:26] us today as we continue
[1:29] our wonderful talks
[1:33] um on the seven church ages
[1:38] we have just uh concluded our last talk
[1:44] speaking about the nickelodeons
[1:47] and nickelodeonism
[1:51] now we identified
[1:54] it starting from nicholas
[1:59] in the church age of ephesus
[2:03] and he founded this but that was just
[2:07] the
[2:08] natural start of it
[2:11] up on the earth nickelodeonism in
[2:15] actual fact the seeds of
[2:18] nickelodeonism were planted in the earth
[2:21] in and through nicolas
[2:23] satan planted it for he
[2:27] was the first one with that rebel spirit
[2:32] in heaven we are told how much that he
[2:35] tried to use negligenism in the sense
[2:38] that he
[2:39] dominated over about one-third
[2:42] of the angels and tried to permeate his
[2:46] influence upon all of them
[2:50] with his lies and profusion of deceit
[2:54] and deception and after a while
[2:57] controlling them he created an
[3:00] atmosphere
[3:02] of uh rebellion
[3:06] and subversion of the kingdom of heaven
[3:12] and under this as you know
[3:15] there was a great war in heaven
[3:18] and michael fought against
[3:22] lucifer satan and his
[3:25] angels of darkness so the hosts of
[3:29] heaven
[3:31] were in a great battle
[3:34] against the armies of darkness
[3:38] the armies of darkness were defeated
[3:41] conclusively by michael
[3:45] thanks be to god and the angels of god
[3:49] and the bible said he was kicked out
[3:53] he was cast out of heaven
[3:56] cast out ignominious defeat
[4:00] cast out there in shame
[4:03] and degradation this mighty great
[4:08] angel that once was in the presence of
[4:10] god
[4:11] was cast down from the glories of heaven
[4:15] to the filth to thee to the
[4:18] evils of the world below actually he
[4:22] turned the entire thing filthy and evil
[4:25] as
[4:25] his personality and character is
[4:29] my point here is to detail or
[4:32] outline to you that nicolasism
[4:36] is not just a happening but it had its
[4:40] very
[4:42] beginnings its genesis
[4:45] was right in heaven came to earth
[4:49] and nicolas happened to be the one used
[4:53] to proliferate it now
[4:59] i want to be able to touch
[5:02] on the serpent's seed
[5:06] you might have heard about the doctrine
[5:10] or mystery of the serpent's seed
[5:14] you may have been told that eve at an
[5:18] apple you might have been told that
[5:22] it was not an apple it happened to be a
[5:25] pair
[5:27] and so various uh
[5:30] ideas thoughts and presumptions of man
[5:34] like that have been told through the
[5:38] ages
[5:41] until they have become like folklore
[5:45] uh stories that are in the bible
[5:50] but this is not so for in actual fact
[5:55] we know what happened and we
[5:59] will introduce that here today what
[6:02] happened in the garden of eden
[6:05] introduced to you
[6:07] how the serpent inserted himself
[6:11] and was able to obscene a seed child
[6:16] and was able then to infect the entire
[6:20] earth with the virus of sin
[6:24] now we realize friends as we have read
[6:28] in our scripture revelation 2 7
[6:31] to him that overcometh
[6:35] will i give to eat of the tree of life
[6:40] which is in the midst of the garden of
[6:43] god
[6:45] now this is the reward of all overcomers
[6:49] from the past now and even
[6:52] in the future for it's for the
[6:55] overcomers of
[6:56] all ages and friends when the last
[7:00] sounding and called the battle by the
[7:03] trumpet of god
[7:05] has been sounded and when all
[7:08] our armor is laid down
[7:12] then we shall rest in the paradise of
[7:17] god
[7:19] and our portion
[7:22] will be the tree of life
[7:25] forever amen
[7:28] tree of life now
[7:32] the term tree of life is mentioned three
[7:35] times
[7:35] in genesis and again
[7:39] three times in the book
[7:42] of revelation and in
[7:45] all six places it
[7:49] symbolizes represents
[7:53] and types the very same thing
[7:58] you say well what is the tree of life
[8:01] well what does a tree stand for
[8:04] everywhere we can read it in the bible
[8:08] numbers 24 6 balaam describes israel
[8:13] trees of lion aloes which the
[8:17] lord had planted now
[8:20] trees throughout the scriptures referred
[8:23] to
[8:24] people or to persons
[8:27] or to a person as it
[8:30] does in the book of psalms chapter 1
[8:34] which begins blessed is the man
[8:38] then it goes onto says he shall be
[8:42] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[8:46] waters psalm chapter 1 verses
[8:49] 1 to 3 you will find that there
[8:53] now in the garden of eden we understand
[8:56] that there were two trees
[9:00] standing in the midst of the garden
[9:03] one was the tree of life
[9:07] and the other was the tree
[9:10] of knowledge of good and evil
[9:16] according to our bible records man was
[9:19] supposed to live
[9:21] by the tree of life but he
[9:24] was not supposed to touch
[9:28] or partake of the
[9:31] tree of knowledge of evil
[9:34] for the result of his touching
[9:37] would be death
[9:41] now we know that death of course entered
[9:45] into him by sin
[9:49] and how that by sin man became
[9:53] separated from god
[9:57] now the tree of life that was in the
[9:59] garden
[10:00] that tree which is the source of life
[10:03] and as we have said before the tree is a
[10:06] type
[10:07] a representation or symbol
[10:11] of persons or a person
[10:14] now this tree of life is a type of
[10:18] christ a type of jesus
[10:21] christ who was in the garden
[10:25] in john chapter six through eight jesus
[10:29] himself
[10:30] identifying himself as being
[10:34] that tree of life because he sets
[10:38] himself forth
[10:39] as the source of all spiritual
[10:43] and natural life he called himself the
[10:47] bread that came down from heaven
[10:51] he spoke of giving life to man that if a
[10:55] man
[10:56] ate up this bread he would live
[10:59] forever and would not die
[11:03] he said i he knew abraham
[11:06] and he said abraham knew him
[11:10] and abraham longed to see his coming in
[11:13] flesh
[11:14] long to see his day and the bible says
[11:18] and abraham saw it by vision
[11:21] and abraham saw it and rejoiced
[11:26] to a savior of
[11:29] of his children of his seed was coming
[11:32] on the scene and that is why of course
[11:35] jesus was able to identify
[11:37] uh the spirits that were on the
[11:39] pharisees and the
[11:40] sadducees that they were satanic
[11:44] and they were of the serpent's seed and
[11:47] that they were
[11:48] evil you are of your father the devil
[11:51] for he's a liar from the beginning this
[11:54] is what jesus said
[11:56] you see before abraham was
[12:00] he was i am he identified himself
[12:04] as the great i am
[12:08] he prophesied that he would give living
[12:10] waters to men to drink
[12:12] that if they were to drink they will
[12:15] never never
[12:16] be able to thirst again and would live
[12:19] eternally oh praise god
[12:22] he is the great i am he's the bread of
[12:26] life
[12:26] he is the rock in the wilderness he is
[12:29] the tree
[12:30] in the garden in the midst of the garden
[12:34] in the paradise of god he is jesus the
[12:38] wonderful and lovely lord and savior
[12:42] jesus christ now
[12:46] some scholars do believe
[12:49] that we are making much ado about
[12:51] nothing
[12:53] they believe that these two trees
[12:56] were just two ordinary trees
[13:00] but i beg to differ god's word
[13:03] differs from what they're thinking these
[13:07] two trees were not two ordinary trees
[13:11] one my friends of course
[13:14] we know was jesus glory to god
[13:18] hallelujah listen what the scripture
[13:21] says here
[13:22] from the scriptures john the baptist
[13:24] said that
[13:25] axe was led to the root
[13:28] of the trees he was not speaking of
[13:31] natural trees
[13:32] but of spiritual trees and spiritual
[13:36] principles upon which his acts was being
[13:40] laid
[13:41] first john uh 5 11
[13:44] says and this is the record
[13:48] that god has given us eternal life
[13:53] and this life is in his son
[13:56] life in the tree of life now with the
[13:59] bible says
[14:00] the life is in his son so the son was
[14:03] that tree
[14:04] right so here we are uh
[14:07] first john 5 14 and ye will
[14:10] not come to me that you might have life
[14:14] praise god so the record of the word
[14:17] shows
[14:18] that eternal life is in the son
[14:22] which is the lord jesus christ
[14:26] for it says he that hat the sun hut life
[14:30] and he that had not the son hut
[14:34] not life praise god
[14:37] the word doesn't change the record
[14:40] remains the same that life
[14:43] is in the sun and so we know
[14:47] life in the tree of life life in the sun
[14:51] and we realize that son is none
[14:54] other than our lord jesus christ for he
[14:58] was that tree standing in the midst
[15:02] of the garden now let us approach
[15:06] the beginning of this revelation this
[15:10] expose of the satan
[15:14] manifesting himself through the serpent
[15:17] seed
[15:21] by allowing himself since god had a son
[15:25] he had to have one too
[15:27] and so let's look at that the bible
[15:30] tells us in the book of genesis
[15:33] that eve was beguiled by
[15:36] the serpent we know that means she was
[15:40] actually seduced by the serpent
[15:45] let's use another word here she was
[15:48] defiled
[15:49] by the serpent it says in genesis 3
[15:54] chapter 1 now the serpent was
[15:57] more subtle wise intelligent
[16:00] oh then any other beast of the field
[16:05] which the lord god had made he was more
[16:09] subtle than any other beast
[16:14] he was more subtle than any other
[16:17] beast of the field or any
[16:21] animal of the field which the lord
[16:25] god had made
[16:29] now we know this beast was close to
[16:32] being
[16:32] a human being and yet he was
[16:36] an animal a pure
[16:39] beast
[16:42] the reason why he was close to being
[16:46] like a human being he looked like one
[16:50] what like one talked like one
[16:53] subtle reason like one
[16:56] intelligent he was
[16:59] an upright creature
[17:03] he walked like a man and was
[17:06] somewhat between a chimpanzee
[17:11] or ape and the man in fact he was
[17:15] and still is the missing link that they
[17:18] are searching and digging around
[17:21] for but you see he was
[17:25] closer to being a man
[17:28] now this is the origin of high breeding
[17:31] this is the origin
[17:32] of nicolasianism and its insertion
[17:36] into the entire human race
[17:40] so you see he was so close to being
[17:43] a human being between
[17:46] beasts and man that he
[17:50] was able to mingle his seed
[17:54] with a human being
[17:58] he could mingle his seed with the woman
[18:02] and create a conception
[18:07] now when that happened according to our
[18:10] bible
[18:11] god cursed the serpent
[18:14] cursed the cooperators
[18:18] chris the woman curse the ground
[18:21] the three that were in cooperation with
[18:24] this
[18:24] evil act of defilement
[18:27] beguilement seduction by
[18:31] this serpent this beast
[18:34] that appeared like a man but was a
[18:38] beast in his soul a beast in his being
[18:42] and here it was that he changed
[18:46] god by his curse
[18:49] changed every
[18:52] bone in the serpent's body
[18:56] and he saw he couldn't walk anymore
[19:01] he had to crawl now we know he was
[19:05] upright for the bible tells us clearly
[19:08] from this day which means from
[19:11] before or the times before he was
[19:14] not on his belly he walked like a man
[19:18] and talked like a man but because of his
[19:21] evil sin this perpetration of evil
[19:26] god said from this day on
[19:29] your belly shalt thou go
[19:33] and god cursed him changed every bone in
[19:38] this body
[19:39] cause him to crawl upon
[19:42] the ground like a snake
[19:45] remember the bible calls the serpent
[19:48] but after it was cursed then snake
[19:52] he was called the snake now science
[19:56] wants and they're doing everything to
[19:58] try to find that
[20:00] missing uh link that they're searching
[20:03] for
[20:04] and this isn't any evolution
[20:08] they've gone into all kinds of false
[20:10] pseudosciences
[20:12] calling it uh evolution and they're
[20:14] looking for the evolution
[20:16] and there's no such a thing as evolution
[20:19] god created man man was made
[20:22] man did not ever loot but that
[20:26] is the they're finding the the evidences
[20:29] some evidences
[20:30] of the serpent seed which
[20:33] looked like a man between a man and an
[20:36] ape and was able to walk and
[20:39] talk but was cursed by the living god
[20:42] and
[20:43] placed upon his belly and god
[20:46] said from this day on your belly
[20:49] shalt thou go of course this is one of
[20:52] the mysteries
[20:53] of the living god that happened in eden
[20:57] when eve turned away from the tree of
[21:00] life
[21:02] up from the tree of knowledge in other
[21:05] words satan had knowledge of her
[21:08] and then that brought death
[21:12] sin upon the earth
[21:15] upon this specific time now
[21:18] friends listen what god says in genesis
[21:20] 3
[21:21] 15 i will put
[21:24] enmity between thee
[21:28] that's the serpent and the woman
[21:32] and between thy seed
[21:35] and her seed to this day there is a fear
[21:39] of women and snakes
[21:41] i will put enmity between the and the
[21:44] woman
[21:46] and between thy seed and her seed
[21:49] this of course also speaks spiritually
[21:52] between
[21:53] the church and satan and between the
[21:56] the children of the bride
[21:59] of the wife of christ and the seed of
[22:03] the serpent
[22:04] also it speaks about that enmity
[22:07] and it shall bruise thy head
[22:11] and thou shalt bruise his heel
[22:14] now that is speaking of course the
[22:17] woman's seed
[22:18] being jesus christ for no women have a
[22:21] seed of ourselves
[22:22] we know that that's really the seed of
[22:25] god
[22:26] that passed through the woman because
[22:28] jesus was not
[22:29] from mary he was he just passed
[22:32] through mary mary was a vessel ordained
[22:36] predestinated
[22:37] blessed and used by god to be
[22:41] the conduit that jesus christ might
[22:44] be here on the face of
[22:47] the earth so we see that if
[22:51] we were to think carefully
[22:55] between the woman's seed and i see
[22:59] the bible is telling you it's not
[23:02] i'm not telling you william branham is
[23:06] not just telling you
[23:07] the bible is telling you there was
[23:10] the woman's seed and there
[23:14] was and is this serpent seed
[23:18] it's in your bible just read it for
[23:21] yourself
[23:22] in genesis chapter 3 15.
[23:25] so we know that the serpent
[23:28] surely had and still has
[23:32] a seed oh man my if
[23:36] the seed of the woman was a
[23:40] man-child that came
[23:43] on the earth apart from
[23:46] man then the seed of the serpent
[23:51] will also have to be the same thing a
[23:53] man-child
[23:55] that came on the earth apart
[23:58] from the instrumentality of man
[24:04] we know every bible student no student
[24:07] knows
[24:08] that the seed of the woman was jesus
[24:12] christ and
[24:13] is jesus christ and he
[24:16] came by the instrumentality of god
[24:21] seed planted by the spoken word
[24:24] and not by human intercourse
[24:28] but by the pure spoken word of god
[24:32] gabriel standing before mary
[24:36] thou shalt bear a son and his
[24:39] name shall be called jesus for he shall
[24:42] save the people from their sins and the
[24:46] word of god caught in the womb
[24:48] and the word of god became flesh
[24:52] by the spoken word spoken word
[24:56] to living word the word
[24:59] met flesh in jesus christ and he
[25:02] walked up on the earth and displayed the
[25:06] character and characteristics of
[25:09] personality of the living god
[25:12] praise be to god now we know friends
[25:16] as we look into the word of god
[25:20] that this literal serpent seed was
[25:23] sown upon the earth just as
[25:26] jesus was sown
[25:30] upon the earth but one was so
[25:34] sown or planted or placed here by
[25:37] god while the
[25:41] serpent seed was placed here
[25:44] by the instrumentality of satan
[25:49] manifesting and operating himself
[25:52] through
[25:53] a beast that had the
[25:56] shape and form and looks
[26:00] like a man for as you go into the world
[26:04] you'll find that he was
[26:05] beautiful snakes still are
[26:09] and he was charming and snakes still
[26:12] charm birds
[26:13] my friends in every way we
[26:17] see the parallelism we see the character
[26:21] that's right there with the serpent's
[26:24] seed and so we see
[26:27] that he had to get his seed here apart
[26:31] from the instrumentality of a man
[26:36] and so he used the beast
[26:39] the snake that is what he used
[26:43] to be able to copycat
[26:46] and to pervert that which
[26:50] god had already done
[26:54] and so praise god hallelujah
[26:58] the bible tells us clearly
[27:01] how that gabriel spoke the word to mary
[27:05] and how the word of god came to pass
[27:08] and that it was god actually
[27:12] reproducing himself
[27:15] in the human race god
[27:19] injecting placing himself
[27:22] in flesh for the word was made flesh
[27:26] john chapter 1 for the word
[27:30] was god and the word was made flesh
[27:34] and dwelt among us glory be to god
[27:38] it was god reproducing himself
[27:42] so satan's serpent seed
[27:45] had to literally be him inserting
[27:49] himself also within
[27:53] the bloodstream of the
[27:57] human race he found an
[28:00] open door that door
[28:04] was the woman
[28:08] and since it was impossible
[28:12] for him to create for he himself
[28:16] is a created spirit being that has a
[28:19] beginning and will have him
[28:21] his end in the
[28:24] lake of fire the pits of hell
[28:28] he will find his end there
[28:31] he is not eternal
[28:34] he had a beginning
[28:38] he is a created being
[28:42] he's a loser from the beginning for he
[28:45] lost the war
[28:47] and he is still a loser he just
[28:50] doesn't know it as yet but he will
[28:54] lose it and the bride is prophesied
[28:57] that she will overcome him by the
[29:01] word of the blood of the lamb and the
[29:04] word of our testimony thanks be unto god
[29:08] glory to his marvelous and wonderful
[29:11] name
[29:13] now friends by his seed of injection
[29:19] into the human race this serpent
[29:24] before adam had carnal
[29:27] knowledge of eve
[29:32] the serpent this tree of
[29:35] knowledge of good and evil
[29:40] had knowledge of eve
[29:44] before adam did
[29:48] and the one that was born
[29:52] from that population that one that was
[29:55] born
[29:56] from that was named
[29:59] cain according to the bible
[30:03] for first john chapter 3 verse 12
[30:07] it says for cain who
[30:11] was of that wicked one so
[30:14] cain was the son of the serpent it's
[30:17] in your bible first john chapter 3 verse
[30:22] 12
[30:23] cain son of the serpent
[30:28] begotten of that evil one
[30:33] injected in the human race
[30:36] and placed here upon the earth
[30:40] the bible tells us clearly
[30:44] in another place that adam
[30:47] was the son of god for he was by
[30:51] original creation
[30:54] luke chapter 3 verse 8
[30:57] 38 and we find out that
[31:00] cain showed his characteristics
[31:05] exactly like that of lucifer that
[31:09] evil satanic being
[31:13] that was there in the great eons of time
[31:18] and so he was
[31:21] a father of lies
[31:25] he was a bringer of death
[31:28] as the bible said he was a murderer
[31:31] from the beginning as jesus said you are
[31:34] of your father the devil
[31:37] for he was a murderer from the beginning
[31:41] what was that it was satan created a son
[31:44] like god had a son and god
[31:46] dwelt in the sun satan got his son
[31:49] by eve the son's name was came
[31:52] but it was satan that was in him
[31:56] still fighting the greatest battle ever
[31:59] fought
[32:00] which started in heaven came to the
[32:02] earth and the contest
[32:04] continued on from that time
[32:08] and we see here in the word of god
[32:12] his character let me repeat
[32:16] just like his father the devil a liar
[32:20] a bringer of death a murderer
[32:24] and a defiant one
[32:28] against the will and word of the living
[32:31] god
[32:32] in other words he was born a rebel
[32:36] as he was in the heavenlies so
[32:39] is he upon the earth the spirit of a
[32:43] rebel that loves has a
[32:46] wonder lust loves to wonder here and
[32:50] wander there and when he's asked in the
[32:52] bible
[32:53] when's coming stop from going to and fro
[32:56] to and fro to and fro
[32:57] he just loves to wander about
[33:01] and has the spirit of a rebel and here
[33:04] he was defiant in the bible
[33:06] when he faced the almighty god and
[33:09] genesis chapter 4
[33:11] verses 5 9 13 and 12
[33:15] showed how cain was so sub-human
[33:19] on human in his
[33:22] reactions to god
[33:26] the bible says god speaking
[33:30] but unto cain and to his offering
[33:33] he had no respect
[33:37] and cain was very roth in other words
[33:41] he got angry with god just think of it
[33:45] a human being a creation of god getting
[33:48] angry with god
[33:52] and his countenance fell
[33:56] and the lord said unto cain
[34:05] where is a bell thy brother
[34:09] and he said i know not
[34:13] this rebel spirit in him i know not
[34:16] uh i don't know am i my brother's keeper
[34:20] the spirit of the rebellion
[34:24] disobedience offensive
[34:27] oh my think of it and cain said unto the
[34:30] lord
[34:31] my punishment is greater than i can bear
[34:35] behold thou hast driven me
[34:38] out this day from the face of the earth
[34:43] and from thy face shall i
[34:46] be hid and i shall be
[34:50] a fugitive and
[34:53] a vagabond upon the earth
[34:56] think of it satan's separate seed
[35:00] vagabonds rebels renegades
[35:04] upon the earth and it shall come to pass
[35:07] that everyone that find that me shall
[35:11] slay me wherever they will find me
[35:16] now in our next talk
[35:20] we will speak my friends twins in the
[35:23] beginning twins in the end
[35:26] we will continue on this topic
[35:29] of the serpent seed and expand upon it
