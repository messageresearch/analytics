word that he giveth to us is good so we have to deliver the word we don't have to waste time so I greet every one of you in the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I greet our pastor and those that are watching on the line I greet every one of you in the name of the Lord we go straight to the word because Christ is our motive everything that we do without him it means nothing but with him all things are possible so let's go through the word straight to the word first we will read the scripture right or at the back Hebrews 13 age and we will read uh first I think first Peter first sorry second Peter 1 20. and uh Brothers one would you pray for us yes Lord yes Lord yes in Jesus name amen okay so Hebrews first we will read the Hebrews 13 verse 8 it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever that's right at the back of the the church there you can see it and even you can see it back there to First a second period 120 goes no knowing this face that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy come not in all time by the will of man but holy men of God speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost may the Lord add his Blessing please be seated the scripture that we just read right God has already interpret his own scripture because remember we all know children of God we come to the World by the seed of God so if the seed of God is in you then you are predestinated for that day that you are in this world because when God revealed the world to you that you are his son or daughter that means you are the scripture that have to be made manifest God cannot go nowhere but goes to his elect God can goes nowhere but to the elect and it doesn't matter whether you were dedicated on educated or it doesn't matter how they you are born to even a bad family or good family or good educated family or uneducated family once you are predestinated by God God cannot go nowhere but comes to you because the scripture has tell us plainly the holy man thank you brother the holy man they were moved by the Holy Ghost because God's children are elect and once you are elect you are the word that have to be made flesh it doesn't matter how you think how you feel how family you born to Once God has elected you he saw you before the foundations of this world that's why he sent you here then that means you are the word that has made flesh because that make God as he said the scripture said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever because the denomination is not of God is of mermaid interpretation man tried to take the word of God the letter that's why the Bible says the letter kill it but the spirit gave life because God's children we are we have the seed already in US it's not your father or church or anybody give you the seed is God that give the seed amen and if he is here he cannot give you the sea today he has is something he has already done he has already done it so it doesn't matter what happens to you your end your future is clear it's perfect that's why the Bible says the children of God does not sin because of the seed of God like brother Daniel was preaching he says when once the word has opened to you so much that the Bible become a new Bible then the devil attack he saw attack you so much that you wanted to even he want you to like give up but let me tell you don't give up if Satan is attacking you don't give up because God is in control Jesus says my sheep hear my voice a stranger won't follow we are the seed of God we are the ones that are predestinated that's why Satan sometimes would like to take you to a corner bombard your mind bombard your family bombard any any enemies he will use to attack you he wanted to use to attack him sometimes he will bring sickness he will tell you oh you are not good he will accuse you is because of the seed but don't worry when you see like that rejoice separate the flesh and look to the seed of God in you that God says who you are and many try to take your heart all your mind everything and focus on the seed of God in you what God has done that bring God on the same because otherwise you will be always depressed oppressed because the enemy attack he will attack you in so many ways brothers and sisters let me tell you for the past some weeks I've gone through some tries bombardment of the devil bombarding me left and right bombarding me bombarding me in this even like today since I'm coming here I'm struggling I'm struggling I'm struggling why because but I know who I am I know what God has done it doesn't matter the Bible says the righteous man falls seven times he rise up seven times is something that is done already it's not something will be done if something is finished product Christ has done it and I'm standing on that no matter how he accused me or try me let me fall ten thousand times Christ will raise me 10 000 times and so is you recognize that the enemy can turn you back because Christ has done it it's a finished product because let me tell you that's why you are sitting here that's why you come here because when the prophet came let me tell you Satan attacked him so much he attacked him he attacked his wife he attacked his children attack the ministry attack him you remember when he went to Chicago 400 false prophet what do you think they were doing those were they were coming to attack him but God was there God was standing beside the prophet those were devils in flesh coming to attack the word and so is it today they may not come physically Sometimes they come by thought sometimes you come by standing there a beast you see him you say oh this man or this sister or this woman let me tell you once he speaks and it's not the word it's not of God it's the devil it's not him or her but look at the motive behind it because Jesus Christ when he was here Satan attacked him he said it is written it is written he used the word to do what to defeat Satan so let us lose the word that has he has fortified in our soul to defeat the enemy if you do like that Satan can never torment you no matter how he torments you he know that you are not gonna give up you're not gonna surrender to him his straights his ways brothers and sisters we know the hour is late we know Ukraine one look at Russia look at China I was listening China is increasing his military budget why is he doing that he's preparing for the third world war let me tell you get yourself ready it's more it's later than what you think it's just like I was talking with brother the best food you like and your mother is cooking the food and you could smell the taste of the food that food hasn't you haven't eaten yet but you are smelling is almost getting ready to come for you to eat that's what the world is that's what the Ted Wallace we are almost home we are almost this world is falling apart that's everything is going chaos is heading towards tribulation is heading towards tribulation look at the economy the money you pay you can do nothing everything is so bankrupt and grew up or whatever you may call it it's all chaos it's all chaos yes sir let me tell you outside looks so nice is just like if you have ever seen in Africa when a cow shake and the Sun Touch It Outside is so hard but by accident your footstep in you will see just go right inside he knows what I'm talking about the inside is so soft but the surface is so hot that is the world right now it looks so grammar and soap duty but let me tell you everything is headed towards disaster so let us fortify ourselves once the word says the holy man were moved by the Holy Ghost sisters brothers it is you and I that the Holy Spirit has come to it is you and I that Christ has revealed himself to let me tell you since we came here there are so many people that has come here but inside them something is wrong they've gone back to the world they've gone back to Saturn but we who we were thinking we were grasshoppers some of us we were thinking we were nobody Now by God's grace we see ourselves his grace is shining upon us his grace is let us know who we are that we are not just grasshoppers that we are his bride do you like the chosen one oh my the one that the Bible says the holy man the holy Sisters You Are Holy sister okay Sisters You Are Holy sisters so the word of God has to come to you I don't care what you think you may think you are not good you do this God doesn't care about that he looked to his seed in you that's why you you could come here Brothers the same thing it's not the work of righteousness it's not how much you know not how much you can even cut brother Abraham let me tell you this is Christ himself has done it he sent a prophet to us and the prophet is gone but Christ is here Christ is here the bride that the the wife of Christ his messenger is the Lord Jesus Christ himself we rely on him we lean on him we rest on him in him all things are possible in him we live in him I breathe you breathe in him you walk you work you go to work and come through him all things are possible when he swear to Abraham he didn't let Abraham swear to him he swear by himself and he has said I will not lose one of my children and if you are one of his children let me tell you you can never be lost your name is written in the palm of his hand who can take you he has spoken the Lord has spoken who can challenge him when God speak normal nobody let me tell you Christ is the answer we live in the hour when God is revealed to us so much different ways of God revealing things that were hidden in his mind that even that the prophets all of them didn't know because the Bible says the least in the kingdom of God is greater than John's about this don't you know you are greater than gender about this because God has revealed place that even prophets they didn't know but you know because God has done it for you he has healed all those things the prophet is not in part but you the least in the kingdom of God you are the greatest God has made you like that he has poured his Spirit everything that was in God he pour into Christ everything that was in Christ where did he pour to the wife every man let me tell you as brother Dan is sitting here let me tell you I thank you okay sorry it's okay as brother Dan is sitting here you think he wants his wife to suffer you think he will leave his wife for some man to come and speak some nonsense to his wife you will see how he blow that man away and Christ is jealous of you His Eye Is Watching Over You 24 hours whatever you think that Christ is not there he's dead he's dead no matter how weak you think you are no matter how soft you think you are even if you are not thinking about him yesterday he's still there because once his seed is in you and he know that this world once you come here the enemy will attack because of what our mother is dead our mother is commit adultery with a serpent so we were all in spiritual amnesia so Christ know that that's why he came back here to redeem us to die for us to share his blood now he has redeemed us even though this flesh torment us this is your enemy it's not your brother not your sister your number one enemy is your flesh me coffee my number one enemy that I fight I struggle I he accused me 24 hours is my flesh I wanna get him out but I don't know how to but let me tell you Christ by his grace I don't care how much he accused me I'm gonna still believe the word because the word in my soul says I'm perfect the word in your soul said you are perfect it's time we realize who we are because the word has come to us the word couldn't go nowhere in the days of marriage where do you think the angel Gabriel will go we'll go to there were so many womans girls virgins in Bethlehem but not all of them God didn't choose them there are so many churches denominations they claim their virgins even though they can be virgin how much they want God will never choose them he chose Mary he chose you you are married today you are married today the world has come to you by his grace not by the will of man not by the will of church not even by the will of yourself is by the will of God set free you are free indeed let me tell you a lot of people think that brother Abraham did it no he didn't do it it was Christ otherwise brother Brown could have ran away could have even commit suicide one time he want to commit suicide who hurry towards Christ wasn't him the seals he didn't break it towards Christ that broke the serving seal it was Christ that gave him the word everything he did was Christ and the bride everything we will accomplish is Christ we cannot do it without him I come to realize that that I myself can't do nothing without him I can't do nothing let me tell you if I leave it to myself I'll be just like a pig in a pic and yacht and so is you let Christ take control full of you let Christ suck your soul so that everything he have for you you will accomplish it but it's not easy it will be thicker in your mouth but better in your belly because you know why to walk with Christ is not easy walk like us Brothers Desmond was saying let me tell you sometimes it gonna cost you so many things so many prices sometimes let me tell you it will even put you in a sick bag you say me yes sit back because God wanna get Glory over there sometime even we have to die so that God will gather Glory be up right you have to pay price because our brothers and sisters that came first didn't get it easy Paul one time they have to pass him through window on basket for him to go and preach the gospel you can you know it's all in the scripture right sometimes you are going to get frustrated sometimes oh my husband and wife you fight one another like hyenas like you don't do what sometimes I do I do let me tell you I am still here I don't grow I don't be in the sky right sometimes I disagree with certain things and I have to fight with my wife but sometimes God even have to come in and tell me coffee even though you are right but don't do that and sometimes some of you will tell you like that wives husbands because why say why my wife can see this because we are individuals God is dealing with us as individuals so not you say and you see your wife doesn't see and you try to show her the moment you try to show her to bring her to the way you are seeing it it's like a war why are you talking you tried to tell me this this then argument he'll try because she is standing on what God has given to her and sometimes he will be saying things to you and you can see that because it's not for you it's for hello because Gentiles God is dealing with us as individuals so sometimes patient to one another patient to wife patient to husband patient to even our children so many of us sometimes we want our children to be like this oh come to church do this do that no they have to face it for themselves because God have to deal with them as individuals you can give salvation to your child this message a lot of people has bring their kids and their family they try to make it and I said it like a Muslims inshallah I said that last time inshallah because the father go and put his hair in general law inshallah then they send gold then the kids go follow no that doesn't work in God's way God says each and every one and as a matter of fact he says to be in the bed I'll take one and leave one to be in the field I'll take one and leave one father will be against the son the son will be against the Father the wife will be against the husband the husband will be against the wife because you know what we came to this world and because of the spiritual Amnesia we have been mingled with the world which evening for marriages sometimes God have to break it so God is the one that is orchestrating everything he's the one that is bringing the Salvation everything the light won't be deceived right that's why sometimes we try to push it to somebody it doesn't work because it's not for them you'll remember when you came to the message I for instance I took the whole message to my Village telling my mom my uncle everybody I told her if I'm seeing this everybody's supposed to see but the moment you do that you know what you they will think about you you are crazy you are mad you are mad you have gone insane my mommy used to tell me oh my son you have gone insane insanity the whole village everybody oh insane your son has gone insane because why it's not for them it's for me it's not for them it's for you it's not for them all we have to do is to do what pray for them we pray for them if they are God elect God appropriate time you bring them in and it won't be you it won't be me the gospel let me tell you God has said my word will never return unto me voice every word will accomplish what I have spoken if I speak it have to accomplish what I speak because it's the spirit of God pick he knows why he speak but sometimes even though we know too much so we take the word and we go and we just do like this to the people right and it's not the spirit of God speaking but it's you speaking but if God really wants somebody do you know you don't have to do nothing or if God needs somebody you don't have to do nothing just maybe hand a tape or just say brother God love you one word like that that spirit of God leads he catches the person who drag him or her straight to Christ oh why are you drinking it may be all kinds of God knows how to speak to his children but sometimes because we know we have to take the Bible the Bible says this Bible says the Bible says in his Bible we become like a pilot to the people and you see that it become you and them War right but if we leave it to God to do it my brother my sister it's not hard God will do the job brother always says he was going to buy furniture in brother Gabriel oh brother Gabriel the brothers said God bless you that attract him and he's sitting here today right it brought a Gabriel preached to him preach the whole sermon to him no one word God bless you that was the spirit of God listen for him to come in so God is saying we should yield our life because the holy man we are moved by the Holy Ghost so once we yield ourselves to the word that pertain to our life for the day God appropriate time will speak the right word that he wants to the people and the people will come and when they come you yourself will know you have done nothing the same that has damage other than that we can't do anything and the person when he come will after his eyes open then he will realize Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever because God does not change when he was here Matthew the apostles some of them he just go he says follow me that one word that spirit of God lives in his mouth because why God word is a spirit when he's released at the right time the person that God is speaking to have to follow he have no choice because the seed is already laying down there God has opened that seat it's like a woman when he got pregnant and the baby is about to come the first thing the water will just burst when the water burst it's time for the baby to do what come out back home our parents where they don't living in the rural area they don't have hospitals are there but when the woman pregnant and the water begin to boss right away they look for any car in that Village to take them rush them to hospital because why that baby is coming they may not educated they may not have scientific machine or whatever but they know one thing once they see that water coming from that woman that is pregnant that baby they have to get other somebody that will deliver the baby because the baby is coming and so is it with God children when the right word who lives in your tongue that appropriate time that word that will lead if it is God word for that hour that seed is coming because that seal is open in the passing heart and is coming to hear his father that's why Jesus said my sheep hear my voice strangers that will never follow all of us sitting here one day you heard that voice and it turned you around I heard that voice I tried to Shake It Up I tried to run I try to go my way many times but brothers and sister no matter how you try to run once you hear that voice they're gonna bring you to where God wants you God who has started the work will finish the work he has chose you call you his elbow no matter how Satan try to attack you no matter how you go even to depression or oppression or even you yourself try to put curse upon you God doesn't care one bit look at Saul Saul and you Saul as example to you sorry if you wanted to kill God's children he went to the witch of Endor place and the winter course Samuel and some were tall Saul says tomorrow you and your son got a time will be with me and where is Saul saw is in God's place because he was a seed of God you are a seed of God no matter what you do God has already finished the work don't lose hope don't give up don't be discouraged be encouraged fortify yourself with the word let the word be your absolute let the word guide you everything because the enemy will leave us like this he will always attack you'll get you one in a corner and think you are nobody you get he will come like a fraud even into the church but the spirit of God will raise up standard and cast him out I believe that I know I believe God word more than anything because when I look at William Abraham life when I listen to the tape I am a man I'm not good in reading so I base everything on the tape I listen to the tape like I I'm pasting the text you got to listen to it it will help you if you can read it read the books wherever the brothers tell you really he helped you a 45 years old because it's not William Brown is the voice of God but using William Brown voice and speaking the voice of God that calling the bride if you are not elect then forget it but if you are electors then you cannot go away with the books or the tapes a lot of people think oh brother Brahm if I don't need a take I don't need preachers I don't need the books how you gonna go to heaven are you gonna go to Christ because Christ has chosen the churches has turned him down the message that's why the whole world is in a chaos the church's side chaos families are in chaos because when the prophet came if they were receive the prophet they got a prophet reward we who have received the prophet we are getting the reward of the message we are getting the reward of what the Bible because it's Christ is Christ that was in William Brown Abraham even though the churches they saw the Miracles they saw the signs wonders dead rays but when it came to the word to make manifest the third pool they turned it down it was common people that held him gladly and who are the common people today is you and me it's you and me look at the message we're sitting here we think we are nobody we are the Angels that the world don't know about we are here they're looking in the sky looking for angels to investigate there is that that danger that they have to look is you God has blinded their eye they cannot see but you and I when I see you I see a ghost Angel sitting down I'm looking at God's angels that has come down here fulfilling God's word I am God angel that God has said they're going to the Moon shooting ups and down and looking for now they want to shoot and go to their son or whatever they will find nothing brother Abraham says they're going to look all over their walk they cannot see nothing there they think that they are looking for is right down here right it's you and me God hiding himself in Simplicity coming to them you are working some are working in the factory some are working in business some are working simple driving trucks some businessmen walking and passing them and they don't know they are bypassing the god that you're looking is now working on the two feet in the white form walking beside them and sometimes they need something I remember one time I was going in elevator one lady a white lady the elevator just opened crowd of people says oh my God as soon as he says oh my God I says God is here what do you want God is right here what do you want oh no no no he gets shot and it's true God is right here you calling God God is right here he wanted to answer you not me I am not the almighty God but he live in me and he wanted to answer you simple things people don't really recognize it you understand and you are walking you sometimes you will see they're talking something and the thing they are talking is so bothering them and you have it's so simple to you you have the answer but when you give it to them they won't take it because you know what they're looking at a man I'm looking for God and that God that they are looking is now in his son bride form wanted to answer them they don't want it and some people too they come even in the message sitting right in the pew the message will be preached preach preach preach preach preach preach preach but they won't open your heart they're still looking they'll go home pray 24 hours read brought a brown message 24 hours but God come in the flesh in the pulpit different forms and talking to them the answer coming and they cannot see they don't want that they want to just listen to the tapes they want to read the books it's good but recognizing God is now in the flesh in the bright form in the fight for ministry right on the pulpit talking to you you remember in the days of Moses Moses was leading the children of Israel and the people says Moses you take too much upon yourself we wanted to see God Moses all right if you want to see God Moses go and he prayed to God God says okay let them watch let them clean and come and meet me I will come down and talk to them right they don't want man it's the same thing today why people don't want checked the true church that the power of God let me tell you me I said it and I said it I will never once Pastor Simon preach the whole world I won't trade him for no preacher unless it's gone and let me tell you I'm gonna pray for whoever God choose these two brothers I'm gonna pray I want the same spirit to come upon them I don't want a hypocrite or hypocrisy what mermaid interpretation no sir we will never tolerate that I'm I'll be gone I want to see Christ because I know him I had met him he knows me he knows the way I am he has brought me all the way from Africa jungle and he has revealed himself to me let me tell you when I came here I I don't believe I was not believing in a preachers because I thought they were all crooked bunch of snakes vipers they want your money unless I see God then from you can talk how much you want but unless I see that's me unless I see and God revealed Pastor sermon to me so let me tell you I want God I wonder God that was the William Abraham the god that is reality a lot of people don't want that that's why they go to intellectual preacher because he preached the cause for them and they think the course will lead them to Christ you need a man that is standing here preaching God behind his King if God is not the run for your life I don't care how much he caught I don't care how much he speak that don't mean nothing to Kofi Angie let me tell you because I'm I don't play with My Soul if I my soul is one time one time life if I may say if I don't go to God I'm done so I won't joke it with a man I will trust it with Christ and so must be you a man or sister this is not we're talking about something easy something joke this is Ray brother this is real this is not because I'm coming to church here and joke this is between you and God this is reality but Abraham he seek God tell he saw him God come to him the pillow fire visit him many times since we are here rather small sitting here so many times God come down it says my servant follow him he will lead you through what do you think we come here for joke come here for Duke then you don't know me I'm I'm I'm I am very friendly but when it comes to God word let me tell you I may not know the letter much but I know the altar you all can make me he came to me the author himself I used to say until I see him face to face and talk with him I'll never worship God and I saw him I know the God I'm servant if people are in the message are serious all the preachers false preachers hidden in the message they will be detected easy I'm telling you the truth they'll be detected easy they won't get nobody to fool it's not by intellectual talk will make you know God see the thing for yourself and the thing becomes great to you then you are setting that's why so many people come in the message they backslide and go because they themselves haven't met God because let me tell you you young ones if you are coming here because you feed him by intellectual or the message is good let me tell you one day you're gonna face some tries will shake you to the Rock if you don't see for yourself cry out until you know that you know that's what David says when I walk in the shadow of death I will fear no evil for down with me thy staff they comfort me David know that the god that chosen and called him you have confidence in that God you have confidence I have confidence in the message I have confidence in the Bible no matter what even if I'm going the grave it's all right I will not be afraid I am so certain of that that this is just say the Lord the message to my soul what William Brown preached what Pastor Samuel has preached I know is the truth I can lay down my life for it that is the truth it's not a hypocrite is so real to me the message is sorry since I came to this world I never see something like this this is the true word of God this is the absolute William Brown is the 20th century Prophet the world may not like it but he is his God what's in William Brown and we who has accept that message that God has revealed himself to us let us be like soldiers not be like chickens I was watching ego I was telling brother Philip documentary do you know that eagle when it's high you can see like other five mice to 15 miles away any animal that moved that eagle conceively never mind he's so high he can see that anymore movie if it is playing Ground and I said wow that's why God typed his spiritual eager he's a bad that fly so high and still yet just ship to the water and come and grab the fish why God's bright real eagles we are not chickens we eat fresh crackers the carcass is what the flesh word of God so if you are eager you come here and you eat the flesh characters coming out from the pullback it come like a fire lighting but you take it cheater in your mouth but bitter in your belly because that's what your father offered to you when Moses when the children of God said they want to see God Moses brought them to God when God was coming down this has no God don't speak to us now speak to Moses then your servant will tell us since that time God says okay I'm not going to speak to man like that no more I'm gonna raise up Prophet my Prophet will talk to the
