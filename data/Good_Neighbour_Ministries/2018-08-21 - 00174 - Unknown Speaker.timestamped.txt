[0:28] don't you need to do everyone's they
[0:30] worried when we see that precious work
[0:50] that's going to strengthen me to receive
[0:52] strength from it it's a supernatural
[0:54] strength don't be looking for evidence
[0:57] this is not something listen baby this
[0:59] something that you see what it's been
[1:02] invested in that's when you see it but
[1:05] before that just faint it's just pulling
[1:08] it from the unseen you're trying to
[1:10] because you believe
[1:17] [Music]
[1:28] [Music]
[1:44] [Music]
[2:08] by the transforming power of the
[2:13] perineal here at chop their job they
[2:16] start to receive everything that we have
[2:18] needed in order to overcome and so when
[2:21] you press through those pipes and you or
[2:25] you you are being super not truly
[2:37] empowered by God to overcome the
[2:40] situations in your life then you wonder
[2:42] why all of a sudden
[3:04] [Music]
[3:31] [Music]
[3:44] service part and this part of coming
[3:51] into the house this is the natural what
[3:57] is God's purpose for this he says for
[4:01] the perfecting of the Saints unto the
[4:04] work of the ministry unto the building
[4:06] of the body of Christ that's the whole
[4:09] purpose so that you can receive he says
[4:18] here when you what okay in first Peter
[4:24] what you have faith okay what God is
[4:29] giving you another faith because
[4:32] remember this is all
[4:37] so you can comfortably unit do you know
[4:39] that once God gives you a revelation
[4:41] there ain't a demon that can take it
[4:44] back so don't ever think that you lose
[4:50] you can't lose revelation because
[4:53] revelation is docking you so it's not
[4:57] something that could ever be taken
[4:59] listen in first Peter 1:23 says these
[5:01] things have I written to you concerning
[5:03] them that seduce you because the devil
[5:06] is going to try to seduce you and try to
[5:08] defeat you and try to weaken you
[5:11] he says ministers and met with false
[5:13] doctrine of the anointing which you have
[5:16] received of him abideth in you and you
[5:20] need not that any man teach you this is
[5:25] not about this is about receiving the
[5:31] word we see it's as simple as that if
[5:37] you're hearing what I'm speaking today
[5:38] if you're hearing the the spirit want
[5:41] the Spirit is speaking to you as an
[5:43] individual and you receive it you're
[5:45] being empowered and you're being
[5:48] transformed into the Word of God into
[5:51] actually living it in front of the
[5:53] people it's not something that you can
[5:55] explain he says he says perhaps the same
[5:58] anointing teaches you all things and is
[6:01] truth
[6:02] is the lie and even has it has taught
[6:05] you you shall abide in so you're always
[6:10] in Christ you see it's him that your
[6:13] hope of glory
[6:14] it's heaven you that overcomes him
[6:17] that's duty honor country because you
[6:19] receive it you believe and you accepted
[6:22] it and now because you're letting it
[6:25] there you're speaking that you're
[6:26] manifesting each believer that has a
[6:34] need to be but every one of you has that
[6:37] need you need to be in a position you
[6:41] need to be given the equipment so you
[6:44] should be looking for your position how
[6:49] you're gonna do for the local the Saints
[6:56] are equipped as each one fulfills their
[6:58] responsibility to serve to minister and
[7:01] to build one another up
[7:04] so you're equipped to do all of this
[7:07] here equip that strengthen identify and
[7:10] build up you see if you get the right
[7:13] instruction and you accept the word for
[7:17] your day and what God is trying to do in
[7:19] this is this is so important of a
[7:21] receiving right not because God wants us
[7:24] to come into the unity of faith so he
[7:26] can empower for the body because it's
[7:29] that happy that gives the destruction of
[7:30] the body it's still all these Christ
[7:33] but whatever the joints are locked
[7:38] and they're gonna be controlled by my
[7:41] evil spirits and Allah do not serve
[8:06] through his people brings this to pass
[8:09] its Christ in you it's him we are
[8:13] keeping focus that such work is first
[8:16] and foremost a privilege it is an honor
[8:20] to serve it is an honor to be called
[8:25] disbanded the South conclusion God will
[8:37] always people to serve equipping
[8:40] everyone but how effectiveness depends
[8:43] on how we do this together as blood luck
[8:48] you see why unity so forth see why it's
[8:52] so important to recognize and to see how
[8:56] it is that that when we operate with the
[8:59] spirit of the giving spirit of love the
[9:02] spirit of magnification glory God knows
[9:06] how to correct identified and deal with
[9:09] situations that need to be dealt with
[9:10] God to provide a way of dealing with
[9:13] your circumstances God will give you
[9:16] that you couldn't deal with everything
[9:19] because when you come under subjection
[9:21] of what you're hearing here it all
[9:24] starts at home if your house is not in
[9:27] order
[9:27] you're not at home living and breathing
[9:30] and and manifesting this word that God
[9:33] is giving us as an atom as a as a father
[9:37] as a mother as a young person you're not
[9:40] manifesting it in your daily routine and
[9:43] you're not living it how could it really
[9:45] have effect because remember the program
[9:47] says this is not something you put on
[9:49] this is something you live this is who
[9:52] you are and just who you are
[9:54] they've been oppressing your life and
[9:58] blesses and builds the body of Christ
[10:01] next slide
[10:02] what does God expect from the church
[10:06] until the attaining you can feel debate
[10:10] and the knowledge of the Son of God to a
[10:13] mature man to the measure of the stature
[10:15] which belongs to the fullness of Christ
[10:18] until we come into that community until
[10:22] we come into that one mind and one
[10:24] Accord you see it was waiting and went
[10:27] up into the upper room but there was
[10:29] only 120 then came into one and that's
[10:35] what started this horror that's what
[10:39] started the building up of the body and
[10:42] all through the ages has been those that
[10:46] recognize their day and their message
[10:49] and they were the representatives of God
[10:52] they were God's Word be manifested
[10:56] people and it progressed on and listened
[11:01] they received
[11:20] overcome everything perfect because
[12:04] you're in the right word and the word
[13:13] was sent and not to return talking about
[13:24] the coming of the Lord
[13:26] they've all been talking about the
[13:28] second coming of the Lord you know what
[13:29] the second coming of the Lord is here
[13:35] you know why they listen because he's
[13:38] here now in the word
[13:41] he's the mighty angel let's come down
[13:44] the head put his foot of the seed about
[13:48] the land and said time shall be before
[13:50] and he's coming out into a five fold
[13:53] ministry this is what we've been talking
[13:55] about he's come out and they're missing
[13:57] him because they're looking for a
[13:59] literal coming meanwhile the little
[14:01] comings gonna be what we did here glory
[14:06] to God but they're missing they're now
[14:08] in Word form because he's here because
[14:11] he said by the foolishness of preaching
[14:14] they cometh by hearing and
[14:18] hearing the word and people say now but
[14:20] it's just dandy
[14:21] it's just John cycling it's just
[14:25] Christopher
[14:26] it's just Philip it's just Tim that's
[14:32] what you're looking at but my sheep hear
[14:37] my voice Jesus said what the spirits
[14:42] saying what the spirits are you hearing
[14:47] what God is speaking and how he's
[14:50] calling this church and positionality
[14:52] pleasing that is the coming of the Lord
[14:58] and you will miss it if you're looking
[15:03] like the rest of the world see the
[15:06] difference he's in word for his first
[15:11] coming was when he came to the earth
[15:16] the words made and among them in the
[15:21] name of Jesus Christ and he looked at
[15:26] all of those denominations all of those
[15:28] Pharisees and all those Socrates he was
[15:31] talking to them that they're saying our
[15:33] Father was Abraham you were up your
[15:36] father you were Beelzebub they were
[15:40] calling God devil there's no us what's
[15:57] gonna happen you meet yourself Cobb you
[16:01] think yourself something's develop you
[16:03] know we just recognize what God is doing
[16:05] according to the scripture and if you
[16:08] can show you anything different than
[16:10] what the word says according to God was
[16:13] supposed to take place at this date at
[16:14] this hour
[16:15] then I might believe but I believe the
[16:17] word that's why being baptized as adults
[16:21] because he that believeth and is
[16:24] baptized shall be saved not some baby
[16:27] baptism or even a baptism as an alum
[16:31] into the titles of Father Son and Holy
[16:33] Ghost which is how the amount is 90% of
[16:37] them out there you haven't baptized
[16:40] you have not submitted to the Word of
[16:43] God and taking on the name of the trust
[16:45] as your husband and because not your
[16:49] gloss I don't care how sincere on race
[16:51] blood it's not about being sincere in
[16:55] place when the tsunami comes there's
[16:58] gonna be a lot of sincere and nice
[17:00] people but that's not gonna love them up
[17:03] when that earthquake strikes California
[17:06] there's going to be a lot of preaching
[17:08] going on that supporting and they're
[17:10] gonna be preaching on the power of
[17:12] government the blessings of Lord how the
[17:14] gods are provided but when that
[17:16] earthquake comes and the urban opens up
[17:19] it's gonna welcome
[17:20] why because believe the rapture takes
[17:24] you on the side mentioning the body
[17:28] James let the musicians never sold
[17:44] Myrtle yes because a lot of us are
[17:48] perfect we can't help it you're human
[17:50] it's only sure that human vessel you're
[17:52] going to feel a burden of this place you
[17:54] feel the pressures of this life you're
[17:57] gonna feel the circumstances and the
[17:59] elements and the bills are going to be
[18:01] there and the pressures are going to be
[18:04] there the kids are going to be giving
[18:05] their heart time sometimes is just gonna
[18:08] happen Saints you're gonna feel sick
[18:10] sometimes
[18:11] again these are all the things with this
[18:13] world there's all part of overcoming
[18:27] glory of God Saints wink just a lot and
[18:32] on and on the next slide says well the
[18:37] church are we to do the church growth to
[18:42] attain a unity invaded as we embrace the
[18:46] truth the true knowledge of the Son of
[18:49] God the church is called to ensure into
[18:53] the fullness of Christ to do the
[18:56] woodcock bringing him glory and eternal
[19:00] gratitude conclusion God desires the
[19:04] whole body to mature as we grow in
[19:07] living out the fullness of Christ as we
[19:11] do so God's divine glory is revealed
[19:17] god bless you sings I trust that somehow
[19:21] this word is gonna give you strength to
[19:26] go up meat Monday morning
[19:31] [Music]
[19:41] I can meet the challenges that would
[19:43] have faced me this week and there's
[19:46] going to be some it's just the way of
[19:48] five states we've got that we've gotta
[19:50] be mature about who we are and we've got
[19:53] we've gotta be able to stand up and take
[19:55] the blows and move on and press on and
[19:58] know that God is not going to go back to
[20:01] what he says there's nothing sometimes
[20:13] they get whacked and sometimes they just
[20:19] [Music]
[20:23] provide all of our needs
