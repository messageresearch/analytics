to bring us to petroleum to Foster Edison Sunday and I was really blessed to have fellowship with Dr Edison Campbell and his family and Saints there and I happen to meet and see my Filipino Brothers there we I haven't seen them for a long time but you know in my own country in our own country I did not see them all the time but in this far country I saw them praise God to God be the glory uh I am a man with seven children and four of them are here in three of them are here in Canada one in Vaughn Toronto and one in two in Alberta my youngest daughter came ahead of us for five or six months and uh I think the church there in Alberta they want her to stay so they I believe they help her to get a job faster so I am going to stay we are allowed to stay until December 6th December 6 we would be going back to Philippines and I heard that Pastor Simon has been in the Philippines once I think and he traveled to a very far a place in bicol and I I said to him at the office while ago please come to Philippines again to to our place because we we miss his visit at that time and he said it was a long time so I'm so uh happy to be invited and to know that there is a message Church that believes the message of the hour and uh I look at your church outside when we arrive and it's just big and beautiful it's not like our church in the Philippines so we are so thankful for God's blessing in this uh in this land brothers and sisters and my uh my wife passed away last year 2022 the Lord took her so uh she was taken by the Lord and she got the breast cancer in in within one year she passed so my children my daughter they want me to come over and spend time with the family and I have two kids left in the Philippines and one is she is in Hong Kong working so uh kindly uh pray for us that the Lord will lead us and and guide us while we are here in this beautiful land I believe the prophet likes this country too but around him even and I like the I like the drawing there at the back and it was a good time uh having a fellowship with Pastor Simon while ago there and uh I believe he is a real servant of God a real pastor with uh the Holy Spirit and a love for the Church of the Living God in in this area so please excuse my English it's a Filipino English so I hope you so uh like brother brother said uh thank me for what I mean not for what I say mm-hmm amen so thank you for uh the welcome uh in this area I I believe that we are The Same Spirit and uh my my work and ministry as Pastor Edison has uh mentioned a while ago my job is to church planting that's I love church planting I go to to the places in my country and I I would stay for a month or three months just to start a work in an area where there is no church and by the help of the Lord and by his uh Holy Spirit God has enabled us to start a church out of nothing so we have the privilege to do that around the country in the Philippines and I would like to I am 57 years old now I started when I was 17 years old preaching the gospel and I heard Pastor also started at the young age and I intend to preach the gospel till Jesus comes or till my last breath if you know I love seeing people get saved I love seeing people get get a life change that's that's my uh desire that's why I I don't want to stop preaching the gospel so uh in some of my experience of opening a church I have to sleep I have to stay in the mountain and where the tribes are the Headhunters they they are fighting each other and I have to stay at One Tribe and they are at War at another tribe but I have I have I have access in that mountain because of the family that was converted in my church and I began to preach to the drives to the tribal men and I was able to baptize 21 Headhunters in Mountain Province so to God be praised to them and we have a church now there now God gave us a church from that area so all glory and praise belongs to Jesus Christ so the pastor told me this to have my time but actually in my church when they give me the pulpit at 10. I am I I wanted to finish my sermon in one hour they I call myself an 11 hour person because preacher because when the clock hits at 11 I stop oh and I don't know you know I that's I tried to maintain that but I I just let the Holy Spirit pray for me to to share a message to you tonight and thank you once more Pastor for the privilege and the brothers and sisters here and brother Joe my Filipino old friend from Philippines I saw him again this time and he he was with he was with us in petroleum and a bunch of Filipino brothers and sisters was was there so I'm glad to see him again tonight amen so kindly stand with me again brothers and sisters let us read the word of God in respect please let us open our Bibles in Genesis 1 1. and in Genesis 1 1 it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth let us pray father in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ bless Thy Word bless the Saints and may the Holy Spirit be with us father fellowship with us Speak Lord Thy word today children help us Lord in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen please be seated my message tonight is entitled the three creations I would like to read again Proverbs chapter 8 verse 22 to 30 where it says the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old I was set up from Everlasting from the beginning or ever the Earth was when there were no depths I was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought forth while as yet he had not made the Earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the Dust of the world when he prepared the heavens I was there when he set a compass upon the face of the depth when he established the clouds above when he strengthened The Fountains of the deep when he gave to the Sea his decree that the water should not pass his Commandments when he appointed the foundations of the Earth then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him may God bless his word what was the first creation of God I would like to read from the message of the prophet in the question and answers 1953 he said in paragraph 22 he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creations of God the first creation was God himself then out of God came the logos which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us out of the logos came forth the man in another quote entitled preparation 1953 the prophet of God said in paragraph 23 let's take and take a little mental trip tonight you and I and let's go back before there was a star in the heaven before there was there even was not anything setting way back in eternity that was God then going out of God or God unfolding himself come the logos which was the son of God or the word of God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the logos the prophet of God said that the first creation was God himself manifesting the logos which the prophet of God said he also called theophany a visible form of God that can appear and disappear from the spirit of God amen that's the first creation before he created the heavens and the Earth before he created the angels and man God was the first creation manifesting unfolding himself into a visible form called the logos or theophany so God we praise to God be the glory amen that's why in Revelation 3 14 our Lord Jesus Christ was called Das and unto the angel of the Church of laodiceans right this thing say it the amen the faithful and true Witness the beginning of the creation of God when did God gave himself birth to his son or to his logos many preachers teach that the son was born in the manger but what did the prophet of God said when was the son when did God himself gave birth to the son in the message entitled it's a question and answer 1953 in paragraph 21. prophet of God said now if God created man in his own image and in his own likeness what kind of a man did he create a spirit man now if you'll notice after he had made all decorations and created the spirit man the close reading of this now to the one that asked the question will find this that God gave Dominion of the cattle and the fishes and everything to the man but in his making up there he made man in his own image to lead the cattle lead the Beast of the field just like the Holy Spirit leads the Believers today sons and others of God are led by the spirit of God and the spirit of God will lead us always to the world to the spoken word and to the written word there is no other living outside of this brothers and sisters amen there is no other leading leading out of the spoken word in the written word because the prophet of God said the Holy Spirit feeds on the word he feeds on the word amen he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creations of God the first creation was God himself then out of God came the logos which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us out of the logos came forth the man let's go back a hundred million years before there ever was a star moon or anything in the world now there was a time when there was not nothing there nothing here it was just all forever an eternity and all of ever and Eternity was God he was there in the beginning now let's go out here on the edge of this banister and look over and see these things happen no man had seen the father at any time no man can see God in the bodily form because God is not in body form God is a spirit no man had seen the father but the only begotten of the father had declared him notice now there's nothing there's just space there's no light there's no dark there's no nothing seems nothing but in there it is a great supernatural being Jehovah God who covered all space in all places at all times he was from Everlasting from Everlasting he is the beginning of creation that's God can't see nothing can't hear nothing not a move of an atom in the air nor nothing no air no nothing but yet God was there there that was God now notice then after a while I'll begin to see a little sacred light begin to form like a little Halo or something you could only see it by spiritual eyes what is that I the eye of Revelation we cannot use these two eyes anymore right now what we need to use is the eye of understanding which is the eye of Revelation no one has seen God and then the next thing to begin to see by the eyes of Supernatural looking we see a little white light forming out there what is that that was called by Bible readers logos or the anointed or the anointing as I was going to say the part of God began to develop in to something so human beings could have some type of an idea what it was that little light moving that was the word of God paragraph 31. now God gave himself vert to this son which was before there was even an atom or heir to make an atom Jesus said glorify me father with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world see way back in Yonder that Saint John 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made less and dwelt Among Us God unfolding himself down to a human being blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah now back there when this little Halo comes but just by Ice you can see nothing yet just Supernatural we see a Halo standing there that's the Son of God the logos and I can see him playing around like a little child before the father's door with all eternity and now then in his imaginary makeup he begin to think of what things would be and I can hear him say let there be light and when he did and I come bursted and the sun came into existence she willed for hundreds of millions of years forming clinkers burning forming like it is today still burning still breaking atoms if the atomic bomb would ever get let loose the atomic chain would take this Earth would be like the sun Yonder just bursting and blowing if you could stand over on another continent and look off at this it would look like another Sun where the atoms was burning this Earth if the chain would ever get let loose and he'd just start turning whirling like that millions and millions of miles reached these big flames of billions of Fahrenheit of heat that goes up that sun now watch this now beautiful he made the Sun and then the first thing you know a big clinker fellow way about like this Earth went spew then this logos here now the Son of God is watching it he lets it fall for a hundred million years and stop it then another one flies up and he let it flow up fall for millions of years then he stops it and we're standing watching it come into this existence he's got something in his mind what he's doing he is writing his first Bible the first Bible that man ever looked to was the Stars the zodiac it's perfect it dovetailed with this Bible here it starts up the first of the zodiac is the Virgin is that right the loss of the zodiac is what Leo the Lion that's first coming of Jesus came through a virgin the second he came as the lion of the tribe of Judah see drawed it all out the cancer AIDS and everything down through he put that all in the sky and place it out all these meteors pieces of earth or sun hanging off there amen blessed be the name of the Lord will God be the glory that's what the prophet of God said brother he says Jesus before he created the world before he created the heavens and the Earth God had to unfold himself into logos form that's the answer to the mystery of Genesis 1 26 let us make man the Oneness they thought the word us refers to Angels the trinitarians they were confused they thought that the US refers to three persons but the prophet of God whether he was not confused it was revealed to him what is the meaning of the word our in US it refers to the logos the visible form of God and the image of God refers to the spirit the invisible form of God amen everyone say praise the Lord God be praised to God be the glory amen Blessed Be His holy name in the plan of creation the logos was included the visible form that's why we human beings brother Branham said we are made in the spirit because God is the spirit but we have the visible form the likeness of God the likeness of the logos amen thanks be to God if we can receive the same revelation amen this Revelation was missed by the trinitarians this Revelation was missed by the Oneness but God showed it to his prophet and the prophet of God showed it to the Bride of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah what a blessed people we are to be part of the body of Christ amen Hallelujah in another quotation that I would like to read prophet of God in the five definite identification of the True Church of the Living God 1960. he said the beginning of the creation of God that is who the Lord Jesus says he is but those words don't mean exactly as they sound to us just taking them the way they sound has made some people in fact multitudes of people get the idea that Jesus was the first creation of God making him lower than the godhead then this first creation created all the rest of the universe and whatsoever it contains but that is not right so let us be careful there brothers and sisters that's why in this message there are those who preach two Lords they are also misled they are also confused of this manifestation of God in logos form amen I don't believe in two Lords or to God's Brothers but I'm I'm surprised why some preachers are getting into that Doctrine you know if you just remain faithful to the written and the spoken word and you just listen to the Holy Spirit you will never go wrong because Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God you can never be wrong you can never go to the left or to the right because the holy spirit is anchored not in the five senses of your spirit which can be deceived the holy spirit is anchored deep down into your soul where genuine faith revelation takes hold brothers and sisters that's what the prophet of God said that's what I believe Brothers in this message I don't want to believe or to teach anything outside of the spoken word and the written word the spoken word and the written word has dovetailed together by the holy spirit so that his people and his children could be fed with pure manner from the Holy Spirit and he said to us so be careful the prophet of God said it's not what the two Lords think that God created this second person Jesus Christ and then this Jesus Christ created the rest of the universe that's not what the prophet of God said let us continue you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the Bible the words are he is the beginner or author of the creation of God now we know for a surety that Jesus is God fearing God he is the creator John 1 3. all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made he is the one of whom it is said Genesis 1 1. in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth also it says in Exodus 20 11 for in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day see there is no doubt that he is the creator he was the creator of a finished physical creation surely we can see what these words mean now to have any other interpretation would mean that God created God how could God be created when he himself is the creator so this quotation is a warning to the two two Lords believers but they don't see it see only the prophet and the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ can see this revelation so after this logos after this the opening the prophet of God called this logos the opening that could appear and disappear from the Fountain of eternal spirit the prophet of God also used the word in morphing God who changed his mask amen and if you read from Genesis to revelation God and morphe was manifested in many ways from the Old Testament and the New Testament amen the first thing he created in Genesis story I want you to know about my Genesis story let us make man the first thing he created was angels to worship Him became God and he said let us make money our image what kind of man he make spirit man he made the man to give him control then he made Man Out of the Dust of the earth then he fell he became he become a savior a God then a savior sin brought on sickness then he become a Healer so we notice here from the message of the prophet that is the first thing the first creation was God himself manifesting in logos and the opening form then out of that logos he begins to create the heavens and the Earth angels and the man and the man was the last thing he created prophet of God said amen you believe that brothers and sisters now the prophet of God quoted Genesis 1 1 and 2. he said in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God move upon the face of the waters now the prophet of God explained this that there is a space of time between Genesis 1 1 and Genesis 1 2. you believe that Saints the prophet of God said that someone was speaking the other day to me he said Genesis is wrong and the six days of creation that he said I said Genesis 1 to Genesis 2 is absolutely a different thing the first chapter of Genesis says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth period how he did it and when he did it that's up to him yes then in verse 2 the world was without form and void then we start off from there for the creation but in the beginning how far we don't know all those seeds that he had in there when the waters went off life come back on the Earth again refurnish the Earth and when God's word is sowed there is nothing can keep it from happening the way of a prophet 1963. to God we praise to God be the glory Genesis 1 he said in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth period how long he done it I don't know nobody else does God did that that's period that's the end of the sentence and when he began to use it the world without form and void and water was upon the dip and the spirit of God move upon the Water but in Genesis 1 said God created the heavens and the Earth in the beginning that's all don't fast about it just believe it God created it it's not my business to know I'm glad he did it and let me live here for a while he's got a new one wherein dwelleth righteousness influence 1963. the first chapter of Genesis said in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth period how long he was doing it I don't know he did not tell us but in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth perion and the world was out of form that's when God started to use it see the difference Church Genesis 1 1 and Genesis 1 2 God made the world he might have been a hundred trillion years making it I don't know how long he was but he made it he did not say how long he was it's none of our business how long it was he just said in the beginning God created the average in their period that settle said that's all of it how long he was doing it that's not but when the creation begin to spring up now in the other time when he began and I believe that in there that everything on Earth reflects heaven I believe that because that you see everything struggling for life is because that there is a life that it's reflected from and I believe that when God made the man he started reflecting the smaller things such as animal life and then the next thing he created was something different that's exactly the way the Bible says he did it he made first the trees and the botany life he made man and then the last thing that ever come from the earth in the form of creation was a man nothing higher ever come because why it was a perfect reflection of the highest in heaven which which God is a man see a man so it shows that the Perfection of evolution was God which is a man countdown 1962. and man is the lower creation according to the prophet of God and according to the Holy Bible Hebrews 2 6 it says but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that our mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him thou May destroy him a little lower than the Angels thou crownest him with glory and honor and did they set him over the works of thy hands but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of that crown with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste that for every man blessed be the name of the Lord and man was made to begin God we know that Genesis 1 26 he had domain over the whole Earth and he was made to be an amateur God I don't know if that's the correct pronunciation a mature God and now when he receives God he becomes a Son of God again he was made in the image of God God had hands God had faith so therefore a man was made like him so he is and a mature God but sin blinded every fiber in his body in his mind in his heart but now don't never try to study it out you cannot figure it out in the Garden of Eden Satan choose his part of the man his head his intellectuals that's why brother Branham the prophet of God there is an intellectual faith there is an intellectual love we must not have that what we must have is genuine faith what we must have is genuine love because genuine Faith believes every written and spoken word of God he doubts nothing that's the genuine fate but intellectual faith it reasons that's why we need genuine love because genuine love love the enemy we have so many profess professing love today but the only love what is good to them and if you can only love the people that's good to you and you cannot love the unlovable your lab is in question because genuine love loves The Sinner and even the enemy amen brothers and sisters to God be praised to God be the glory amen and I want to have that genuine love I want to love everybody even those who have spoken evil and bad things about me even if I have known this person that behind my back he has spoken bad things about me I want to be able to shake his hands and rajaj the love of God for my heart without hypocrisy and pray for his soul that one day he will get right with God I cannot do it without the holy spirit is impossible it is impossible to love an enemy it is impossible to love a man that you know behind your back has been telling things bad about you it is impossible to express a real genuine smile to this man or to this woman the natural way the carnal way you would like to smack him in the face and maybe take a hold of his hair and bang it into the the wall That's the kernel you know but there is nothing impossible with God if the holy spirit is shared abroad in our hearts these things are possible amen in a real genuine believer has already radiates that Divine love and genuine love in their lives Amen to God be praised to God be the glory amen Hallelujah I hope I have not spend so much hours now say in your body inside of you we got another question on that directly to answer it better inside of you is a spirit another man the outside of you is one man the inside of you is another man so the inside of you is the supernatural the outside of you is the physical this being if you are Spirit led by God you become a messenger of God hallelujah or an angel let me read it again if you are a spirit led by God you became a messenger of God or an angel God's messenger God's angel is the very same word cannot separate it God's messenger or God's angel which has the greatest Authority an angel from heaven or an angel at the pulpit which has it the prophet of God said the angel at the pulpit Paul said if an angel from heaven comes and preached any other gospel to you than this which I've already preached let him be a curse so the angel Anointed with the Holy Spirit and with the word stand next to God that's right in the heaven his authority all Praises be to God all powers in Heaven and Earth is given to my hand go and I'll go with you whatever you bind on Earth albine in heaven what you lose on Earth I loose in heaven oh oh if the great holy church only realize its power to do these things but there's so much doubt and feel and trembling and wondering if it will could it happen as long as that exists the church can never stand upright and when every talk of fear is banished and the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church and all fears are gone and the church has the power see why they have everything that heaven owns behind them they are ambassadors of the throne absolutely an ambassador of Christ has the authority and everything that Christ holds belongs to that ambassador and he said go ye into all the world you are my Witnesses after the Holy Ghost is come on you what is a witness is an ambassador is to come and witness something the whole power of Heaven is right in your hands oh why do we set and the church is barren and we said Dorman is because that we don't recognize these things that should be the name of the Lord now the souls that were in prison that repented not were not Angelic being that had been brought down in the form of angels but it was the spirits of those small letter a Angelic beings that fell before the foundation of the world back there When The War went on in heaven and Satan the dragon fought and Michael and the dragon dragon fought and Lucifer was cast out with all of his children all of the angels that he had deceived and those angels come to the Earth and was subject then to become human and when they did that's when the sons of God saw the daughters of man was fair and look unto them wives they are sons of God every one that's born in this earth is a Son of God regardless of whether he's a sinner or what he is he's the son of God created in the image of God for the phrases of God he created that way but God in the beginning knew who would receive him and who would not receive him therefore he could predestinate or not predestinate but by foreknowledge he could tell who would be saved and who would not be saved for he knew which person would take up which spirit and those spirits that come from the Throne of God and stand before that Throne of God and live billions and billions and aliens of time before the world ever began in the presence of God do you think they don't know something about worship they come down and get right into man and they worship God absolutely they worship God and they have a knowledge of God and their smarts ruled educated always but God rejected them from the beginning so therefore friend membership of a church or knowledge of some theology or something does not have one thing to do with it it's got to be the blood of Jesus Christ and the new birth that joins you to him as one person there you are God in the beginning men and women was made one not two they were made one they were separated one put in flesh one in ethiopathy listen to this church this is deep the prophet of God teaches us things that are so deep but they are understandable by the revelation of God the prophet of God said there was one put in flesh and one in the opening he knew that so sin so in order to prove that to you when God made the woman he never took some dust and made her like he did the man he took a rib out of the side of Adam and he became a byproduct of a man because he's part of him you get it now see there you are there are the Angels small letter a and God in the spirit that's joined with God is one Spirit that's right now the spirit of God that dwells in the church Christian Church is the spirit that come from heaven that God knew before the foundation of the world that rejected the devil's lie my and that Spirit had to take a body of Flesh to take his testing he had to come flesh like this others did and all of them put on the equal yoke and God by the beginning knew the spirits that would which would not there you are the devil is also wise he's just deceived he just received the burial if possible so the spirits these angels letter A not the capital A that which was in prison Angels if you'll notice it's a little a which means man Angels Messengers here on the earth they sinned and the only way that they could sin would be disbelief and the way they had their own religions and they did not believe the message of Noah they did not believe the message of Enoch and they rejected their message and was condemned the Bible said they were question and answer 1957. he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creation of God the first creation was God himself then out of God came the logos which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made blessed and dwelt among us out of the logos came for the man so many people are you know that tattoo Soul teaching in the Philippines and around the world or the soul when a man is born again they said the old soul is annihilated and died and replaced by a New Soul from the seventh Dimension from the Throne of God that's a very popular teaching in this world but it's it's false it's lie they said that when you are born again and received the baptism of the Holy Ghost a New Soul from the seventh Dimension comes down immediately because your old soul was burned and annihilated because it was sinner but you know the prophet of God said brothers and sisters where is your day opening that is my question tonight where is your day opening prophet of God said your soul is your the opening you can you cannot Google that you can search that in the message amen you search It soul of man is but some preachers they kept pointing to seven Dimension or some other places in heaven where you get your theophany he got all his creation made let us plural make man plural own image now if God is unsaid if the logos was in the form just mythically speaking drama in the form of a Hello then it's supernatural see Genesis 1 26 is a fitness problem to the believer it has been made clear by the prophet of God how to understand Genesis 1 26. the answer is the logos and the opening that's the answer to us and the word our there prophet of God said let us plural make man plural in our image let us make man in our image so then that God made disperse man he was a spirit man he was something on the order of God the Son of God the logos see praise be the name of the Lord and now the logos that went out of God which was the logos all this begin to form a body shape and this body shape was called in the scholars teaching the logos the logos that went out of God in other words a better word for it was what we call atiopane brother say amen for that he opened it what is the opening the opening is a human body that's glorified not exactly with flesh and blood like it will be in its glorified States but it is of a form of a human body that does not eat neither does it drink but it's a body a body that's waiting for us soon as we leave this one there went into that body and that's the kind of body that God was let us make man in our image and in our body in our likeness now when man becomes into that body he had control all the fishes and the fowls and the beasts of the field there was no man to till the soil Genesis 2 he then made male and female but there was no man to till the soil then God made Man Out of the Dust of the earth give him like a hand like a chimpanzee give him a foot like a bear give him made him an image this Earthly body is the image of animal life and it's made out of same kind of material your body is made just the same kind of material as a horse or a dog anything like that it's made out of calcium potash petroleum Cosmic light All Flesh like that it's not the same place it's different place but it's made out of the Dust of the Earth where it come from but the difference between an animal and a man God put a soul in the man and he did not put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that the opening God be praised to God be the glory where is brothers and sisters Hallelujah don't believe any man pointing you to so many places where your tea opening will come from your the opening is inside of this body the soul is that the opening and the prophet of God said when we die this body goes back to the Dust and that soul that he opened it will be received in a Celestial body but the prophet of God said it's a temporal body called celestial that will last until the Rapture only have you read that it's temporal and when the Rapture comes you leave the celestial form your soul my soul which is the opening will pick up the body that rotten and was resurrected that's what the prophet of God said and glorified body reunited brothers and sisters that's the sitting of the prophet amen and I believe you believe the same because I don't teach anything outside of that heaven Hallelujah so let me repeat it again when we die temporarily our the opening will be received in heaven in a Celestial form the prophet of God is temporal it's a body that will last until the Rapture only amen and when the Rapture comes you leave that Celestial form because your soul you're the opening my the opening would have to pick up this will be Resurrected amen can we say praise the Lord they said be the name of the Lord amen I don't know if I can finish this Recreation I already spent so much time pastor just for the first creation alone I might I might just stop it you know you know it will take more time to finish the second creation and the third creation I don't want to hurry you know okay because uh it's all about time it's already quarter tonight is that sometimes our clock in the Philippines is not working right foreign amen let me just finish this first creation I don't know uh I just want to finish this first topic and then because I don't wanna let you sit there so long for so many hours so let me just finish this okay so first so he was he first was god Jehovah and out of him out of him came a white little white like Mystic light like a Halo and that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning that was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father that was that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's what we read in Proverbs 8. that Proverbs 8 that was the logos talking there I was brought forward before he created all things but to the tunity and Trinity they see that Proverbs 8 as another verses that's the problem brothers and sisters amen and he said that was the son of God that came up on the boss of the father what's what what was that that was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the beginning was God and then out of God came the logos as part of God that went out of God oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord see let me bypass some of this quotation so that is the first of the three creations of God the second creation let me just mention it in a short way the second creation prophet of God said what is the second creation now the first thing God this was God Jesus was God in the form of man that's hard for people to swallow even today he was God that's what he was he was nothing less than God he was God manifested in blessed he was the creator in his own creation he was the creator in his creation by the creation for the creation he was the creator in his creation by his creation for his creation all with winds right back in God the whole thing did you say fullness of God he was the creator in so much that he was God and he was a being on Earth a being of time which means that he must have a beginning therefore he created himself a body to live in God himself created a body for himself see that by discretion he might save the Lost creation that he had created so the purpose of the second creation was to save the Lost creation because the first creation was lost God had to make another creation and this is the opening to human flesh this is the second creation amen that should be the name of the Lord I give him praise and glory tonight and what is the third creation a prophet of God said the third creation is God will create human beings not by sex but from the dust of the Earth making them glorified body and including in that third creation he said I make new heavens and new earth everybody say praise the Lord Brother says let's all stand I give the let me just close in prayer and give
