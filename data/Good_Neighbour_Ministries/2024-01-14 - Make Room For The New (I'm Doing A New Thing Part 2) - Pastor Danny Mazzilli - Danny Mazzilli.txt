everybody into the house of the Lord this morning God bless you worship team thank you so much brother Anthony thank you for the worship this morning oh it's good to Worship the Lord and get into Heavenly places in preparation for the word of God amen amen that's that's an absolute requirement you know it all starts when you wake up in the morning on Sunday morning you know um being being prayed up is such a a powerful um Advantage if I could say um you know uh you want to pray in the morning you want to come with expectation in your hearts you want to know that um that you're going to meet the Living God Amen in this day and in this hour you know that's what makes us so different from the rest of the the the the church world like you know I'm not putting down anybody or anything but it's all based on your own faith and your own experience with God and you know you choose the way you want to worship and serve the Lord Jesus and um and worship him on Sunday mornings but um as a as a son or a daughter of of God that's really come into that understanding and realization of the word of God for this day and that God is alive that the Lord Jesus is alive he's present he's um he's he's walking the the the pews Walking The Halls walking in the Sunday school he's a living God that wants to fellowship and move in the midst of his people amen and when you come into that atmosphere and that understanding you know it's it's it's levels of consciousness right you can walk into a room and um and you could be conscious of only one thing because that's where your mind is constantly on so if you know if you come into the place and your mind is on Sports and you know there's another brother whose mind is on Sports the first thing you do when you come to church is you go to talk to that other brother about sports it's just it's just you know that that's just how the mind works right we're we're we're humans right and so but if you come in because you've been having fellowship with the Lord you've been you're under expectation you read the word this morning you say wow praise God this is wonderful and then you come into the the house of the Lord and he starts to he starts to actually repeat those scriptures back to you amen he starts to give you understanding on what you read this morning now you've entered into a fellowship that's completely different you see you come with expectation to meet the Living God and now you know he knows your hurts he knows your burdens he knows your needs okay and and so if you come with that kind of a heart of expectation guess what you're going to leave rejoicing you might be sad but you'll leave glad amen you might be depressed but you'll leave expressed filled with the spirit of the Living God Amen praise God hallelujah so I welcome every single one of you um I welcome guests if if there's any guests in our midst this morning God bless you and welcome into the house of the Lord amen we welcome you here I believe that um you know everybody loves new things and sometimes you know I got a call this week from somebody that's you know looking to you know find a church locally and and so forth and um you know just let them know we've got the Sunday school because she was looking for Sunday school for her children and her grandchildren actually and I said you're more than welcome to join us I let her know what you know what time and so forth but she's just in that investigation stage right now and kind of wanting to discover praise God she's here amen praise God hallelujah thanes that's wonderful you know because um you know we we're mindful of of uh God's people you know wherever they are and sometimes they're looking for something new and I'll tell you something you come into the house of the Lord with that kind of expectation you know um you're going to get something new because you know every everybody likes new things am I right amen everybody you know especially clothes right people love new clothes why because they want to cover themselves make themselves look better right everybody likes new cars you know because they want to cover themselves around with something that's that looks nice it's fresh it's new it makes you feel good right everybody you know like you know when you get a new suit you feel good when you get a new dress it makes you feel good right it's all about new things but here now God is saying that I'm going to do something new amen he he's going to do something new for us that that that you know that kind of new never gets old the clothes they get old the cars they start to break down they give us trouble the relationships sometimes they can be struggles new relationships they can be a struggle but God wants to do something new this morning I believe he wants to continue to do some great new things in our lives amen so let's um let's go now to um to the word of God let's pray first and then we're gonna um allow the media team who I appreciate all very much for their great work um they've done some fantastic work on our website if you get a chance you can go and review it it's been you know semi- updated we're getting there right we're moving along we've

our scripture this morning let's all stand in honor of the word of God Amen So today we're going to continue along the the same thought that we started last weekend I am doing a new thing he saysi am doing it so if you can trust that he's going to do it for you then you just need to surrender and let it happen amen praise God Isaiah 4318 verse to 19 remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old behold I will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall ye not know it I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert praise God you may be seated God bless you Saints hallelujah praise God last week you know just a quick review we were looking at um God doing something new and we read from the scriptures from the book of uh Exodus 12 ver1 where the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron and said that this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year for you God was declaring something to the children of Israel that he was going to start something brand new he was going to give them a new beginning they had been under bondage for 400 years they had not known anything different they had just known the way they were brought up and the way they were taught and the way that they that all they knew was was was the whip that's all they knew is that if they didn't if they didn't obey the whip would come down the whip would come down but God doesn't operate that way with his people no sir God says if you obey I Will Bless he says I will bless you I will give you a brand new start and you can change from this day on I'm going to create a new life a new future I'm going to give you I'm going to place my heart inside of you and you will know that I am your God and that you are my people amen he's a jealous God Amen praise God and so he was declaring that to Israel that it was a time for deliverance time time to move on time to go and inherit the promises of God Amen this for Israel was a new beginning a fresh start Hallelujah they are now at the threshold of stepping over into their destiny the destiny that God had planned for them he was silent for 400 years amen but he's silent no more that's how he always does it Saints he he just becomes to he just comes to a place where he wants to do something new and how does he do it he becomes real to the people he starts to manifest himself in the Supernatural he starts doing things in your life and our lives personally that we cannot deny this is the Living God this is God that called me this is not some church not some uh tradition because Mom and Dad belong to church I'm going to belong to church no sir this is a reality this is how God comes on the scene calling his people and says I'm going to do something fresh and something new amen praise God you know um in Psalms 138:8 we read last week you can put it on I believe it's the next slide he says the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me Hallelujah God's concerned about you amen don't be looking to the left or to the right don't be looking to you know to the conditions God is concerned about you and he has plans for you amen thy mercy oh Lord endureth forever forsake not the works of thine own hands amen God's own hands are going to come upon your life amen God's Own Direction and God's Own purpose is going to come into your life and change things and he's going to do it in such a way that you will be amazed God can make things new and can change things and and he works in the Supernatural brother philli amen amen he works in the Supernatural praise God hallelujah amen so God says I will do a new thing amen and you know what when he brought those children out he brought them out it says in in Psalms 105 he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes amen God knows your needs in 2024 he knows your your financial needs amen he knows your health issues things that you may be facing right now and things that you might have to face down the road but he says not one feeble not one feeble amongst my people if you can believe that and if you can accept that and you can receive that you can you can experience that amen you don't have to be feeble you don't have to be sick you can say Lord You're The God That Health all my diseases he's still the same God Amen he'll do it for you like he did it for them amen he's the same yesterday today today that's what we're interested in today what are you going to do for me today Lord he says I will do it for you today amen praise God and so you can leave 2023 behind if you were sick in 23 you can leave it in 23 amen you can leave bad relationships in 23 amen you can you can leave behind sorrow you can leave behind oppression and depression and the things that were that that that were burdening you listen listen God can lift your burdens the Lord can lift your burdens just like that he can do it believe it Saints you don't have to stay in that oppressed condition all the reason why you're staying in that oppressed condition is because you you're not making room for the new to Come Oh Glory that's where we're headed this morning amen so we we've got a new beginning of Health we got a new beginning of wealth we got a new beginning of healing and we've got a new beginning of Happiness amen that's what we can look forward to in 2024 so let's move on now let's go to the next slide amen praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus So today we're going to move on and part two is about make room for the new you know a lot of people they they want new but they don't want to make the room they don't want to let go of some of the things from the past you know we carry things from the past and and and and you know we just want to carry it and oh poor old me you know I had such a terrible upbringing there's just no way I could have a good future all the scars of the past you don't have to carry them anymore am you can leave them behind yes you can let go of every single thing that brought you down in the past I'm telling you you got to empty out so that God can refill amen let's read the scripture Isaiah 54: 1-5 says sing O baren thou that did not bear Break Forth into singing and cry aloud thou that did not TR veil with child for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife sayeth the Lord now I want you to just as we're reading this I want you to I want to bring it to today and I want you to see the type and what it is that the Lord is saying here amen he's saying here that you know that um you may have felt Barren you may have felt like you know that you weren't bringing forth fruit in your life and things are just remaining the same and there's been no life because he talking about a woman here for you know to to bring forth children but but the type is life we need to read between the lines here so open your thoughts and expand your thinking let the spirit of God for more are the children of the desolate listen the world is full of unbelief and you're surrounded by it every single day you're you're you're bombarded by it and you got to be careful cuz a lot of people you know what they get so caught up in the negative that they want to allow that to become their experience they want to say well you know what what hope do I have look at the condition of the world look at the wars that are going on look at this and look at that and and and and many are the children of the desolate people that don't know God that don't want to receive God that don't want the hope of a new future the hope of Salvation listen we're Christians for a purpose because God expressed salvation that day on Calvary salvation from what from this salvation from the the the the the failures of this world and the falling apart and the conditions of the world we can barely bring our children up in schools that will still allow God in the school we're living in a place where there's so much desolate but he's saying that that you that you are not uh desolate because you're married to him the married wife we're talking about the bride of Christ the True Church of the Living God that has taken Christ as their savior as their redeemer as their husband as their provider Oh Glory to God so so listen what he says here he says he says enlarge the place of thy tent make room room you need to make some room here enlarge thy tent he says and let them stretch forth curtains of thine habitations Oh Glory to God you're going to have so much room when you come under this Revelation that God is going to do something new in your life that that that he's going to pour in more than what you could possibly imagine Hallelujah he says spare not he says l thy cords and stretch thy Stakes he says put them out don't you be afraid to declare that this house now is is being led by the Lord himself don't you be afraid to put out the barriers and the stakes to show the people listen the tribes of Israel they would put boundaries in their land because they would they would keep the squatters out of their land make a decision that no squatters are going to come into your land amen for thou shalt break forth on the right hand on the left and thy and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles what you mean he's talking about today about the church the True Church of Christ the bride this message of Christianity came to the Gentiles it came to the Gentiles God knew that Israel was going to reject their Messiah but he also knew that there would be a people that would receive his word amen it's all through the scripture Saints if you can't see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you need to go back and read it over again Hallelujah and make desolate cities to be inhabited Oh Glory to God Burlington there's a place that can that you can come and find find safety and refuge in Jesus Christ you can receive the blessings of the Lord right here in Burlington I know there's many other churches out there God bless each and every one of them praise God but we're a part of this church God has given us responsibility of this land we've put our Stakes out on the four corners of our land and we're saying this is a House of Refuge this is a place where the word of God is going to come fresh oh yes it's going to be freshh from the Lord every Sunday every Wednesday you can come into the prayer meetings and you can be delivered on Friday nights God is doing something new right here Amen in Burlington and this is going to be a place and a city that can be inhabited by the people of God Amen fear not for Thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for Thou shalt not be put to shame glory to God Amen they shall know that I am their people and that they they are they are my people and I am their God we will not be ashamed don't you be ashamed of this gospel don't you be ashamed of what God has revealed to you in this day and in this hour because it is your hope of glory it is it is the people's hope to receive Christ and to be delivered from what is happening in the world right now this world is falling apart I I'm sorry I don't have to be the one to say it all you got to do is turn on the news you can easily find out that this world is not in a good condition right now hallelujah praise God he says for Thou shalt not be ashamed for Thou shalt forget the shame of what thy youth thy youth you mean there's young people in this place that have made mistakes and they're shameful of their mistakes that's okay he says come into the house of my habitation and I shall let you forget that shame amen I shall remove it from your life he says I will remember it no more amen that's what he wants to do for our young people amen there's nobody that's going to be left out no sir when they went out of Israel even the children the small children they walked up to those Egyptians they kicked them in the leg and they took their gold and they couldn't do a thing about it Hallelujah glory to God Amen because God was with his people God was showing that he was delivering amen praise God for Thou shalt not be put to shame for Thou shalt forget the shame of thy Youth and shall not remember the reproach of thy widowhood anymore Oh Glory to God for thy maker is thine husband who the maker how many makers is there one one God one God hallelujah brother and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament Oh Glory to God Amen Hallelujah listen he says for thy maker is thy husband the Lord of hosts is his name and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole Earth shall he be called how many gods one one God you need to know that you need to know who your savior is you need to know that there's not three in one three persons in one there's no such thing the Old Testament was the Lord God that was condescending down when he was talking about the Mighty God the counselor the Prince of Peace who were they who was Isaiah talking about he was talking about the Lord that he was going to condescend and he would become the Messiah of the people it's not another God it's not God the Father in Heaven the son on earth and the Holy Spirit moving in our midst it's all God in his three offices listen I'm a father I'm also a son I'm the son of Dominic and Ida missil I'm a human being my name is Danny that's my name I'm the the same person though and when Jesus stood there before his disciples after he had been risen from the dead listen to what he said Matthew 28:19 all power how much more than all is there no more no more can somebody please give me a all description of all all things beginning and up down nothing else all power has been given unto me in heaven but wait a minute I thought God the father was in heaven and he had all the power yeah he does but Jesus was expressing himself God on earth right in heaven and on Earth all power he says now go ye and make disciples baptizing them and this is where this is where the enemy came in and put his own interpretation go back to 325 ad you'll find out that church and state came together there was a big Nia council meeting and they decided at that point after 325 years that they were going to inject the trinitarian doctrine of Father Son and Holy Ghost three persons in one three separate entities in one call it what there's no such thing he says go into all nations and teach them baptizing them in the name n a m not names name and he goes of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit now Jesus was standing right there and Peter was there and all the other Apostles and they knew very well what he was saying because on the day of Pentecost Acts 2:38 after the spirit because the the Lord told him go into the upper room and wait because I'm going to Endo you with a power that is going to change this world forever amen he says you shall be my people amen you're the ones that are going to go tell them about this formula that I've given you and they all received the Holy Ghost and they went into the streets now watch Peter was present when Jesus said all power unto me not unto us unto me just like he said to philli when Philip went to him and says Lord you've been talking about the father you know show us the father you're telling us you know while he was with the disciples he looks he says Phillip have I been with you so long he says if you see me you see the father it is I I am with you just like he told the woman at the well they said Oh Our Father said that when when when Messiah comes he will do these things Jesus turned and looked at the woman at the well and said I am he read your scripture it's it's right there in front of your face it's simple but they don't want to receive that and you know that that is such an important element it changed my whole walk with God because now I knew who I was worshiping I knew what he's doing I knew what he had done I knew what he's going to do and it changes everything and Peter right there on the day of Pentecost when the people said after they heard them speaking in their languages and they were God was speaking to them and Peter and and they looked to Peter and they said what must we do to be to be saved what must we do to receive this that you have and he said repent he says turn away from your old ideas and thoughts and traditions and he says be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ read it there's over 3,000 baptisms in the book of Acts and every one of them was done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you'll see nowhere that it was done in the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost I challenge anybody to show me where it was ever physically done I'll show you in the book of Acts thousands of baptisms and everyone in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ another one Acts 19 listen we could get into all kinds of scripture here but we want to move on but we know who Our Redeemer is amen we know who's called us amen hallelujah let's go to the next slide so in Luke uh St Luke Chapter 5 praise God we're going to read that in just a minute but just a couple of thoughts here we need to expand our minds to make room we need to make room and one of those rooms is the room of tradition we need to we need to clear out those old paintings those old uh ideas all those old way we need to we we need to clear out all those old teachings that that were that were instilled in our lives from growing up you know some of us were brought up in Catholic schools some of us were brought up in in in in non-Christian schools and we were taught one was taught that there is a God but then they were taught that you got to pray to the Virgin Mary you got to pray to St this one St that one St Christopher if you want good if you want to travel somewhere you know these are all traditions and teachings of man there's nowhere in the scripture that you will find prayers of the Saints praying to the Saints we believe in the in the in the in the uh uh prayers of the Saints uh the Apostles Creed what Apostles Creed there was one Apostles Creed repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and when the Holy Ghost comes to you Jesus says he will guide you I will lead you into all truth that's what you need that's the Apostles Creed amen that's what we need to receive this morning there's no prayers you know for to uh you know Hail Mary and all of these things Mary she's our sister God chose her blessed above all women because she brought forth the body of Jesus Christ she's blessed but she's not the mother of God no there's no such how can God have a mother I'm just talking straight up here he says I am Alpha I am the Omega I'm the beginning and I'm the end so how does God have a have a mother Jesus listen when Mary was there and the and the angel Gabriel came to her said the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you and that moment that he spoke God's word he spoke a seed into her womb and she said be it unto me according to Thy word his word is a seed she received his seed and right from that moment her life was completely changed amen hallelujah she's our sister we will rejoice with her we will give her praise and and and and for for for being strong and courageous to be able to stand in the midst of that unbelief where people thought she was a prostitute she had been with another man oh how dare she even Joseph thought you know that people said how could he possibly take a woman that's already with child she had to stand the reproach of the word of God amen and we need to stand the reproach of the word of God when we tell the people the truth hallelujah praise God this is the truth Saints we need to get rid of the boundaries in our minds that have become barriers those boundaries that we place in our minds you know tradition and stuff like that they become the barriers of what God wants to do in your life to expand your thinking to expand your ability to to expand your Revelation to know that he's a living God he's present amen glory to God but sometimes we gather all kinds of junk you know like I was saying listen our garage is designed to put cars into them we all forget about that and we tend to fill it with all kinds of stuff and guess what we can't even fit our cars in there but you need to move the junk out in order to put the cars in the garage was designed for cars you've been designed to be an inhabit of the word of God thank you Jesus the spirit of God wants to live in you wants to possess you wants to give you Clarity of mind and allow you to look into your future and see that it's all clear because we don't know what the future holds but we know who holds the future hallelujah praise God that's what we that's what we are holding to Saints that's what we believe amen so we need to expect great things from God and attempt great things with God you got to come out of that shell you got to be willing to to be courageous you got to be willing to stand on this word and tell the people what is the truth amen you don't have to drive it down anybody's throat remember Jesus said very clearly this is the beautiful thing that you know that that should set every son and daughter every Christian free he said no man comes to me L my spirit my father he's talking about the almighty the spirit of God he was he was in a human vessel displaying the human sacrifice but it was still God so he had to he had to uh you know associate in that way because he was moving with with with carnal people human beings but those that received the spirit of Truth they they had a revelation on what he was saying yes Lord that's you up there that's you right in front of me but you he says no man comes L my father draws him l no man can come unless God draws God pulls my sheep hear my voice I didn't hear Brother Gabriel's voice that day when I went into his his furniture room I heard him he he was talking you know he was talking like a guy that was like you know kind of like you know oh yeah that's good you know like he he he didn't he didn't he he was oh praise the Lord you know I said to him I said I he goes to me he says are you a Christian it was like he was asking me a question like you know like you know it was it was like I felt a little bit you know moved right I said I said I don't know I had to tell him the truth I was brought up this way you know if if if if Christianity is you know the Roman Catholic church or whatever uh I'm a hypocrite because I ain't living the word of God not even close but something spoke out of those lips behind that that word there was a call when he said are you a Christian no that was God saying come my son it's time I didn't know I didn't have any idea but that was God speaking and when God handed me the tape to listen to a minister that that that that that was making sense something takes place on the inside and that's why I'm saying to you we're going to look at some things here today I believe that is going to that's going to break a lot of barriers and it's going to allow you to make room for the new amen but but we got to let let's move on praise God and so St Luke 5: 36-39 it says and he spake also a parable unto them no man putteth a piece of new garment upon an old if otherwise then both the new maketh a rent and the peace that was taken out of the new agree not with the old and no man putteth new wine into Old bottles else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles Shall Perish but new wine new things new revelation new uh move of God still the same God must be put into new bottles you got to be willing to let go of all the old you got to empty right out and you got to let the holy SP Spirit regenerate you regeneration comes through baptism that when you go into that tank and you receive baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it is a type of death burial because you go under the water and Resurrection to New Life and when that takes place in your life you're a new bottle Hallelujah brand spanking new and you can start to take some of that new wine new wine I'll tell you new wine can burst I've seen it happen I I grew up making wine with my father every single year and I would see sometimes you know he would put the the the the tops on a little bit too tight you know or put a cork in there thinking that you know it was okay to Cork it come out the next day and there's wine everywhere because the corks exploded because the wine was still fermenting but that's like you and me I remember when I first came to the Lord I couldn't shut up I couldn't wait to tell the people I was bursting and bubbling and making a mess all over the place hallelujah hallelujah praise God that's what happens when you receive this new wine amen it's a revelation that you cannot contain you cannot explain it just bubbles inside of you it just it just changes you it just G gives you life beyond measure amen no man also having drunk old wine straight way desireth the new for he sayith the old is better and that's the way it is out there don't think it's easy to to to tell people about this new wine because people like aged wine people like to stick with their aged wine they don't want something new they know that it's a little bit too much you know I can't take it it's going to it's going to throw them off a little bit hallelujah praise God but God wants to fill us with brand new wine amen and he wants to know that you're a brand new bottle this morning morning you got to be willing to be brand new you got to be willing to let the spirit of God transform you and change you from the condition that you're currently in to the new condition amen praise God forever more he wants to inspire us with new wine which is present truth that's what new wine is amen and in that new wine there's Revelation for a rapture there's Revelation that you can be changed that not only will your life from that day that you start to receive new wine start to express and manifest a new life people will know that you're different people will know that you're not the same anymore you don't even have to say anything people are just going to know that there's something different about you when you're with your friends or your co-workers and the f bomb is going off over here and this one's cursing his mother and the other one's cursing his boss and everything else and they see you all peaceful and calm and relaxed and not reacting in the same way they look and the enemy don't like that so he's going to try to say hey drink this you need some you need some good old aged whiskey here you know some old wine but you you've been changed amen you're brand new you can't take that anymore that's old that's that's another life that's not who I am I've Been Changed by the grace of God I've been I've been transformed and been translated out of this this life that had a control and a hold of me and I've been made new hallelujah praise God they'll want the old because they'll think it's better our responsibility to say Lord fill my cup fill me up Lord he'll do the content filling don't worry he just needs you to make the space he needs you to open up he needs you to allow him to come in praise God to do the work that he wants to do in your life we need to make room for him to fill us with new wine faith for the day do you know that that new wine that's coming forth right now is your overcoming power in this age that when you receive you know that's why a lot of people but it's it's the word Danny you know you're telling me all the same listen we quote the same scriptures we talk about the same Lord Jesus but yet why is it that it's different when we speak it than when others speak it without Revelation it's because there's no Revelation there's no understanding they haven't got the mind of Christ to understand the word word it's as simple as that if the spirit of God is in you it will guide you to all truth amen simple simple simple amen but that faith that that God is releasing right now in in this world in this hour it's Jesus Christ in the present stage of his ministry amen praise God and so I encourage you to to to provide space for God to fill you let's stretch ourselves and enlarge our capacity so that he sees you as ready and willing and able to pour His blessings into amen you got to stretch you got to allow this this Revelation you got to stand and sit long enough to allow the spirit of God to speak to you and and make it simple and plain amen praise God new wine of Revelation for this hour amen glory to God we need to uh you know expand our vision we need to we need to expand our vision we need to you know we we need to not see ourselves the way that the world sees us but see ourselves the way God sees us and the way God wants to perfect in you the work that he started so we need to see that we need to have that Vision that God is my my vision has changed listen since I've come into this office here as the pastor of Good Neighbor Ministry God is enlarging my vision it's natural process that when you grow in Christ he will enlarge your vision you will see things that you never saw before you will see Deliverance like you never saw before you will recognize that God can do things that you thought you couldn't get rid of you couldn't deal with but God can do it all you got to do is allow the vision to be expanded amen allow our challenges to be challenged amen how can how can you stretch yourself and do more in the body of Christ Christ what can you do to get into your position into your office because when you're called to the body of Christ we just finished you know and we're still in that series of seeing ourselves in the word positioning our ourselves in the word and we're going to continue with that this Wednesday night so but but God wants you to know that you've been called for a purpose you've got a placing in the word of God and he wants to use you he wants to bless you he wants to anoint you he wants to anoint your your your position amen he's so he's saying I I I want I want to challenge you to to expand your your you know get out of your comfort zone get outside of that comfort zone don't let church just become a tradition you know that you just go to church on Sundays get into the house of the Lord anytime you can get into the house of the Lord get into prayer when you know that you're going into the house of the Lord get into prayer before you start your day let God be an every single moment part of your life not to be overly religious I'm not talking about that I hang out with my friends I love my friends and I want to live the life that Christ gave me in front of my friends so that that influence of Christ can influence them to live better if possible you know to quit their swearing you know a lot of them when they're around me now when they do swear they're always apologizing oh Danny sorry you know I said Thank you for having respect unto the Lord amen I'm just a man okay we all make mistakes but I but I but I thank you for being respectful unto the Lord amen praise God they're conscious of God Amen and that's what's important that's how we have an influence in the world that we live in amen praise God so we have to take responsibility also we need to expand and take responsibility for the things and and be faithful in the current things that God has us to do because if you can be trusted and be responsible in the things that you're currently doing God can add more you see that's another way of God making space in your life when you're good and you're faithful to the responsibilities that you already have I praise God for those that are faithful in the media faithful in the cleaning committee faithful in the trustee office faithful in the Deacon's office faithful in the ushers positions faithful in keeping the house of the Lord in such a way that we can be proud amen praise God these are faithful calls and faithful positions and God is going to bless you regardless of whether you want to be blessed or not it's coming your way oh glory to God listen when that email went out and said cleaners wanted that was another way of God saying I want to bless some people I want to pour out some blessings you know what they're going to work they're putting in their seven eight hours some of them are sleeping in too much some of them are are are are taking too many sick days I think I need to bring them into the house of the Lord and get them to do some work and then I can pay them with something that they'll never ever ever regret Hallelujah if God you get on God's payroll look out it's coming God's payroll it's from Glory Hallelujah which bank Eternal Bank Hallelujah which insurance company eternal life hallelujah praise God that's what you can receive when you become a part of this wonderful economy of God Amen praise God Glory Hallelujah so you know what as we expand the wrong thing to say is Lord take away my problems that's the wrong thing to say okay because now you're focused on the problems you should be saying Lord expand my ability to handle the things that I can't control expand my faith so that I can overcome the things that look like problems to me but not to you it's not a problem to you Lord you can give Faith to overcome anything because the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against Revelation and when God wants to give you faith in the word of God God wants to give you Revelation over that mountain or that situation Satan cannot stop it Jesus said the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against that instruction that divine revelation that's my mind speaking into your situation glory to God Amen and so we need to ask God to expand our ability to handle pressure you're built for it you're an eagle you don't have to be Bal to be an eagle you're an eagle God has designed you to fly higher and and and into places and and under certain circumstances and storms look at that eagle man when he when he sets his mind on something he pierces through the storms all he does is he goes higher he allows the spirit of God to speak to him and say come up hither my son I've got something prepared for you amen you don't have to stay in that in that in that chicken pen you were not born a chicken you were born an eagle amen when you heard this message this Revelation there was a there was a call in there that was an uncertain sound that only you and God there was a deep call to the Deep God was calling you out of that chicken pen God was calling you out of a life of of of misery depression oppression he's doing it today am that's what he's saying today he says all you got to do is is let me do something new your life expand your thinking expand your ability to receive my word amen praise God hallelujah so ask them to to you know sometimes when the new comes in we we want to try and protect the old because the new looks like it's a bit of a threat it's as simple as that you know people get threatened by new things but we need to understand that that's all part of the process of Deliverance amen praise God at first in looks like a threat puts you under tension makes you a little nervous oh I don't know if I can stand in this position do you think that I I'm ner listen ask my wife okay it's not easy to what I've been called to here there's been some serious battles going on but God is the one I trust amen and it doesn't matter if it takes me to my grave I will have finished my course that's the way I'm looking at it I'm it's not easy I'm I'm I'm nervous sometimes I I I get I get I get I I get scared sometimes that's human that's just that's just who I am I I think sometimes I'm going to get up on the stage and I'm going to start to minister and and my mind's going to go blank on me that's that that's a great fear for a minister you know because Satan likes to throw things and and throw things at you and and make you think that you can't go into this call you can't go into this position God wants to place you God wants to bless you he wants to do more in your life but you got to you got to be courageous you got to be willing to step out and to and and say Lord give me the ability to to handle the pressure so that so that I can do your will and and and then when when when you can get yourself so out of the way it it can be like I was you know I mentioned the pastor Simon sometimes said pastor Simon sometimes you know you get up on the stage there and it's like you're in a candy store and you're looking everywhere and you can pull scripture here pull this there inspiration coming from here inspiration coming from there it's glorious but that's not something that we are in control of all we got to do is believe that God will do it for his people because this is not about me this is not about you this is about the body of Christ coming into its position so that we can fulfill the purpose that God has placed in our lives amen hallelujah so the new looks like a bit of a threat you get nervous and and you know it's going to it's going to change things around you people are going to get nervous around you people are going to feel a little bit uncomfortable about your position about your your your your your call of of you know taking this word and allowing God to do absolutely everything brand new in your life this year those old those old Spirits those old friends are going to come hey let's go for a drink come on man it's Friday night those things are still going to try and call you out but you got to be courageous and you got to be strong and you got to you got to let God be your strength at those times it's when you're at your weakest Point that's where God can become the strongest in your life amen amen praise God forever more listen understand that change has always been rejected always change nobody likes change some people do if you're like me you got add a little bit you like change you don't mind things happening last minute oh this is exciting H Allelujah this is different I'm good with that I'm a little I'll watch but I know that he'll give me direction he'll give me wisdom he'll give me discernment in the situation because we trust in him amen we believe in him but change has always been the big thing that causes disturbance you know that change causes War yeah why do you think World War One World War II World War Genesis World War Exodus World War Ezekiel all kinds of Wars because every time God wants to do something new there's a stirring in the camp look Jesus the word made flesh came to Earth he was brand new nobody understood who he was the Pharisees they were so caught up in their Traditions their their barns were completely full with all kinds of tradition to the point where they couldn't even recognize the word being made flesh right there when when the Virgin Mary was was was with child and the scriptures said a virgin shall conceive so many hundred years earlier and there she was manifested right in front of them they called her an illegitimate woman they couldn't recognize it was God doing something new but not new in that it was not spoken just like he's got something new for you that he planned from before the foundations of the world this is not just for today this is not for yesterday this is prophecy being fulfilled in your life because you're the new in this hour amen praise God Jesus came they couldn't take it they felt threatened what did they say oh you are uh you be elab he says why do you condemn me you condemn me for for for for doing uh good works you you you you condemn me for Healing The Sick for raising the dead oh no no no we don't condemn you for that we condemn you for saying that you are the word made flesh hallelujah oh we're going to this this doesn't end this week by the way I'm only halfway through my notes this is just going to get better I believe it's just going to get better praise God they couldn't take the word made flesh they couldn't recognize that that that Jesus of the Old Testament was Jehovah of the Old Testament was Jesus of the New Testament the Messiah that had come to to take away the sin the unbelief they wanted no they just wanted to take a goat slit its throat and allow the blood to cover them and that would be enough and they could go back out next Friday night and sin again but he says I come to take away the sin like it never happened in the first place Hallelujah why because he's got a people that he's got to bring back to Eternity they got to go back to Eternity because they came from eternity they are attributes of God they are cleansed they are clean they cannot sin he's come back for those seed that elect attribute of God he's bringing back those that are not caught into sin but are trapped in a human body they couldn't take Jesus they wanted to just keep killing the goats they just wanted to just keep with their Traditions they couldn't see the word made flesh in front of them so I came across this on the internet you know as I'm studying and I'm looking at things and some things they they catch my attention and I oh interesting so this one individual I forget his name right now I forget his name right now but anyway he wrote this and it's on cognitive dissonance I want you to listen care carefully here sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong when they are presented with evidence that works against that core belief the new evidence cannot be accepted did you hear what I said okay they're holding on to a certain belief system and this is most people okay they hold on to this belief system system and they just can't they can't let it go even when evidence is produced to them it works against that core belief and the new evidence cannot be accepted at first it creates a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable and it is called cognitive dissonance you can look it up on the internet Look up the definition dissonance COG I nitive mental dissonance you know look it up and you'll see how it perfectly describes here and because it is so important to protect the core belief now this person because it is so important to them to protect this core belief people will rationalize ignore and even deny anything that does not fit in with that core belief yeah that's what the Pharisees were experiencing they were experiencing the modern [Music] day description of cognitive dissonance they were so caught into their own belief system their own writings their own Traditions their they were so so memorizing the word to the point where all they could see was the memory of every scripture they could point to any scripture in the Bible and they could repeat it but they were like robots and there's a lot of people that get caught into their traditions of of you know denominational thinking I was brought up Roman Catholic I'm a Roman Catholic till I die I'm going to let the priests come and give me the last rights where is that in the Bible Jesus has a right to you and only Jesus nobody else there is no other mediator between man and God God but Christ Jesus scripture I'll go with the word of God Amen he says even if it is the truth come on now a lot of people they'll sit there and man they'll go man that's the truth I never heard it that way you mean I mean that's what he meant in the word of God even if it is the truth even if it is what will set them free and liberate them from the condition that they're in not allowing to make space for that new thing that God wants to do in their lives which is to give them the revelation of this word and this message even if it's the absolute truth that sets you free Jesus said the truth shall set you free he says even if it will set them free from the chains of sin which is unbelief in God's word they will not accept it cognitive dissonance people experience it all the time when God shows them something in the word of God that's truth hallelujah in Romans go to the next slide Romans 1: 25-28 who changed the truth of God into a lie and worship the Ser the the the the served and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator see people people get to a place where oh no no no no no my my church's tradition is greater than what you're telling me in the word of God they're saying in other words that that the creation is greater than the Creator they're saying no no I listen to my my my priest he tells me what I need to do if he tells me that I can go and I can go into the into the cupboard once every couple weeks and confess my sins about adultery and this and that I can go back out and do it again because it fits with them you see that's cognitive dissonance that's a mental condition listen here what it says who is blessed for forever amen the Creator for this cause God gave them up unto vile affections you see when you reject the truth look out you're going to allow anything now to come in and take control of your mind God gave them up to vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature if we've ever been in a time where the world is in absolute chaos when it comes to gender identity this is the time Saints what a you know depression amongst that particular group and suicide is running rampant because they don't know who they are God wants to tell them who they are God wants to give them their identity but they want to take on an alternate identity they want to be given over to and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one towards another men with men working that which is unseemingly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meat and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge they reject the word of God God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do things which are not convenient do you know what a reprobate mind is it's when you believe something to actually be the truth and it's actually a lie next as we wind down here this I say therefore in Ephesians chapter 4:17 to20 this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their minds they're not allowing the spirit of God to you know people just won't sit long enough sometimes you just sit there I tell people I say listen you know what I know that what I said today may be a little bit hard for you to fully understand you talk to them about serpent seed about what the original sin was sometimes you know things like that the baptism and all that I said listen don't don't just believe and trust me I'm just a man but I said get down and and and spend some time you know pray and and and then read your your Bible and see if the spirit of God doesn't come and do something that opens your understanding and do something new in your life he says not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their minds having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart they just don't want to be sincere enough they just don't want to be sincere enough you you get them to a place they get too uncomfortable all of a sudden they'll start to joke they'll start to change they'll try to you know they'll say a dirty joke or something like that and and they'll try because because they can't handle truth it it gets them so uncomfortable but you know if if you want if you listen if you want God to do something new in your life this year you're going to need to get out of that uncomfortable you're you're going to have to break through you're going to have to take that pressure and you're going to need to sit still and sit long enough to allow the word of God to come in and make sense to you allow the spirit of God to open your understanding because you've been you you've been you you you're you're you're alienating yourself from the light people will say I'm an atheist I don't want to know God I say that's fine I don't believe that Danny you told me that testimony of that girl that was in your church went into the dentist office and had a cardiac arrest and they were they pronounced her dead brought her back she was in the hospital for so many days the mother uh said there's no way I'm praying I'm leing God and and God rose that woman up out of a coma where the doctor said that she would not make it she was clinically gone but she came back and she had a testimony Hallelujah and God does I don't believe that Danny well listen Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe he didn't say anything about to them that don't believe so I understand your position yes all good brother it's just the way it is see God opens the understanding God does the new thing in your life Hallelujah than you who being who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lacious that's living just any way they want and lust and all kinds of to work all uncleanness with greediness but ye have not so learned Christ you have not been taught in that way you have been given faith and Revelation to know what is something new and embrace it and allow God to change you and translate you into what he wants you to be amen if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus you see it always will bring you back to the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God Amen let's go on to the next slide as we close therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new Creature if you've accepted this this work of God in your life that you you you say Lord do that new thing in my life I'm ready I'm I'm I I've made room for you I'm making room I'm gonna go home I'm gonna clean out the garage it's a type you see you're going to express that Revelation that's in you you can't help it you know when you when you organize your thinking it's it's a proven fact you know if you're if you're organized up here everything around you will just automatically get organized just the way it works before I start to move onto something new with the Lord whether it's a new message or or whatever it is that I that I ask my wife the first thing I got to do is clean house let's clean up vacuum under my desk clear all the papers organize everything throw out some of the old stuff because I got addd I can't help it I I get distracted I see this here I see that there I got to clean it I got to get rid of it I got to organize it and then now okay everything looking good everything's ready okay let's go it's just the way that I'm designed okay but but you see I I like that part because I don't like disorder I don't like things messy and clean I thank God for a wife that's got add OCD she loves to keep the house clean I love it and she enjoys it sure it's a little tough going up and down the stairs and this and that I'm going to get you an elevator but it's all about the grace of God and being in our position understanding how God has designed us and allowing the spirit of God to use us in those areas and in those ways praise God God so you become a brand new creature old things are passed away he says behold all things are become new how can All Things become new here's Paul back in the day you know in in in e in Ephesus and he's talking to the Corinthians and he's telling them all things become new it was all new back there why is it all new back there because it's all new here too it's all all about him it's all about his spirit it's all about him doing it it's all about him progressing this word and making this Prophecy of the Rapture come to pass we are going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye that day is approaching Saints it's a lot closer now than it's ever been amen praise God but he's got to do something new in your life you got to allow that new to come in amen because the new is him the new is Christ the new is him in you changing you translating you moving you uh delivering you from all the things and he says and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation you are a reconciliatory chist the church the bride the wife the helpmate you are Eve but not Eve in a fallen condition Eve restored the partner allowing the the the the spirit of God to have preeminence over your life now you are a part of that reconciliation the ministry that that he's what's he doing he said he's reconcilia the church to himself reconciling us back to him making us one with him but there's only one way that that can happen that cannot happen any other way it has to be that you were you you were you were a son or a daughter of God before you came to this earth you were a child of God your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before you came to this church it's not something that just happens today but it's something that awakens in you to bring you back out of your spiritual Amnesia to bring you back to who you actually were were God chose those from before the foundations of the world Listen he chose a Jacob and he rejected an Esau he said Jacob do I love Esau do I hate why because he knew the seed he knew where the seed originated it was not the seed of God which was which was Adam's seed back in the Garden of Eden but the serpent got in there and beguiled Eve and placed his own seed in there and out of there came forth many different seed one seed unto the Lord Abel and one seed unto the serpent Cain why did why why did Cain kill why did he murder his brother what was it that was in him is because he was not the seed of God and we need to understand that not everybody in the world is the seed of God I'm not telling you that because that's what we believe that's in the scripture amen it Jesus himself said there's the children of obedience the children of Disobedience you were of your father he told the he told the the the the priest right there what he was on Earth in in St John chapter 6 he says you are of your father the devil he was a liar from the beginning who was the first liar in the beginning Cain where's your brother I don't know I just killed him back there but I don't know who was the first liar you see serpent seed God's seed so listen to brother brandham here he says in the in the saman age let the musicians come now then here here we are coming to a conclusion and so am I as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and Jesus dwelt in the fullness of the godhead bodily right Jesus was in the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifested in flesh okay Jesus was the father manifested in flesh called it the son gave it the name Jesus and went to Calvary to be that human sacrifice because it required a man's sins a man must die that's why Jesus Took man's place and that's why anybody that accepts Christ at the cross their sins can be forgiven them anybody and so the father was manifest In the Flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifested in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons and daughters of God even as we are socalled we did not become seed by rebirth listen carefully here so you're born ex you know like when somebody comes to the altar says oh I accepted Christ into my heart and they come to the altar that doesn't mean that they've been born again that means they've made a confession that's a good start that's that's where it starts but it and and it could lead like me I came to the altar I remember I come to the al pastor Simon I want the Holy Ghost I want the Holy Ghost see people will come because they want that change they want to repent but that doesn't mean that there's an elected seed of God in there that's going to go all the way that's going to end up being a manifested word of God in human flesh cuz that's what we become we become the interpretation of God in this age what we accept the word of God for this age amen and so we did not become seed by rebirth we were seed we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn only Sons and Daughters of God Eternal thoughts of God can actually really have like the ultimate new beginning and fresh start to receive the word of God God and to be changed because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken and that's why sometimes you'll talk until you're black and blue and the person will just deny the word of God and they'll just go on just let them go on it may not be their time and season yet because to everything God has a time and season or it may be that that's just who they are that's not up to you and me we don't take responsibility for that glory to God Amen we need to understand that so here he says Jacob he says look Esau was twice the guy this is from the message why we are not a denomination Esau was twice the guy that Jacob was when it come to being a man taking care of his old blind Daddy and everything else and Jacob was a little Shyer hung around his mother's apron little old boy but God said I love Jacob and refuse Esau before either boy was born in Romans 8 it says that's exactly right God knows what's in man God knows every single one of us praise God forever more thank you Jesus Hallelujah I'm going to leave it right there let's pray our gracious father what can we say Lord you've said it all there's nothing more that we can do Lord we just we just want to say Lord I'm making room I'm making room today Lord I'm letting go of the old and I'm laying hold of the new I'm going to let my

your children this morning Lord and do something Lord that's brand new Lord let their those that are on the stream this morning Lord May if they've been challenged oh God to search the scriptures to

own this message we do not claim to to be the only ones that have this message the message is your word Lord we're not putting our own interpretation on it Lord we've only quoted the very scriptures
