TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good sunday morning to all of you what a joy to be here again in the house of the lord and while i'm at it let me mention to you that next sunday we will uh begin the service with a beautiful worship service before my sermon or speaking so please bear that in mind i believe it will be enjoyable it'll be wonderful and we'll all rejoice together god bless you what a pleasure now for today i would like to read out of the first book of the bible genesis reading from the word of god chapter 3 and i'm reading verses 1 to 4. now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea had god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said you shall not touch it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die a gracious father be ask your blessing upon this service today as we send forth thy shining light and thy marvelous truth may the word of god living god be a discerner of the hearts and thoughts and minds of men we commit ourselves into your glorious gracious hands for service in your kingdom and to you be all the praise the honor and the glory for we ask it in the name of our lord jesus christ amen friends think of it no man wants his wife to just leave the home and go wandering around the streets where she may be picked up and so this subject i'm speaking on is not new but i'm taking a little bit of a different approach for here we see in the garden of eden the picture of adam god putting adam his son into a deep sleep and the bible says out of his side god took a rib and there he made woman now understand clearly adam was a cr spoken word creation of god he was created by god's spoken word eve came out from his side which means that she was a part of him which tells us that she was of this very same material that he was made of which of course is a perfect type of christ and his bride because he the lord jesus christ being the word out of him comes to church comes the bride the bride will then be have to be the genuine word of god for if he is the word and she came out of him the church also must be out of the word so let's go back now how then can the true bride or the true church you know dissimulate analyze debate over the word of god when she should be the reflection of that very word because she comes from the word she comes from the word and she is part of the word if she is the true church if she is the genuine bright class of saints redeemed by the mighty hand of god then she would be of the same identical material as he yes now adam being a man after they sinned he died but this second adam is a quickening spirit he is the eternal one living in human flesh therefore if the genuine bride is comes from him from his side for as adam uh had to sleep and his wife was taken from his side even so the bible tells us isaiah 53 that jehovah struck him and jesus died out of his side came blood and water with his own blood he bought her and for her life he died oh thanks be to god that he paid the redemption price to redeem the genuine true church of the living god so we see adam in type did exactly and eve did exactly what happened later on in the new testament when jesus died and she the bride was taken from his side now the distinction that i'm making now is that adam being mortal died but this second adam being immortal being eternal then it must follow that his bride is of the same eternal material of which he was he has made so she is of the same class of being as he is oh thanks be the god saints that the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord i want to thank god for that eternal life that dwells in our hearts by faith if we are true believers now here is the picture adam and eve according to genesis 3 they're found in the garden oh enjoying the beautiful blissful atmosphere the sweet soft zephyrs the the smells of the perfume of the flowers in the air the peaceful atmosphere of the lions of the lambs of the other animals that were there undisturbed and what a peaceful wonderful time they were enjoying yes they were enjoying first of all fellowship with god and that's the first thing that we must bring ourselves to that we must keep in continuous fellowship with the eternal god we must have always our telephone line to glory always talking with god and having supernatural communication and divine inspiration striking our souls and so they had fellowship consistently with god as the bible tells us here in genesis that the lord will come down in the evening time in the cool of the day and god would talk with his son and his daughter and together oh what fellowship the vine they had together walking and talking with god in this idyllic egyptic situation in which god had placed them in this fellowship that they had with god they also were enjoying their marriage bliss for it was not good for a man to be alone and god provided him with a beautiful wonderful wife that was in harmony with him they walked together in this marvelous marriage blessed and this marvelous joy that they care together they also walk in this mutual joy of companionship for not only is the husband a husband to his wife but he also ought to be a a friend a companion someone to talk to someone to care someone to share someone to be able to take you know any observation anything on your thoughts that we could share one with the other and there were in this marvelous tape of enjoyment of companionship these two walking hand in hand i can see the glow of joy and the peace upon their faces there they were in the presence of god these two always walk together for they were in agreement my friends so must the church walk together with god consist consistently for this is the state of oneness this is the invisible union of the bride of christ this is the state we must always be in in consistent fellowship with god hallelujah praise his wonderful name but one day eve decided that she was going to take a walk all by herself that she wanted to walk alone and so as my topic being god's wandering church she wandered away from her husband adam and there in the garden she became a target for deception because the serpent accosted her and the bible tells us that uh he turned up on the scene knowing that adam was not around you see friends the church the true church must stay with the word she must not wander away or off the word but to stay with the world at all times for the word of god is her protection the word of god is her leadership and her guide so the church uh must be in that state at all times trusting him and his leadership by his holy spirit and his grace and stay in a state of being in love with him jesus christ the word of god for the hour and so praise god hallelujah when she wandered away from her husband is just as much as the husband to the true church is the word of god my friends if you are not married to the word if you do not have a relationship with the world then come to christ come to the god of heaven and ask him tell tell him that you give him your heart oh praise god so you may have a relationship i'll walk with him talk with him a harmony a great fellowship continuous fellowship of joy a continuous state of bliss and the peace that passeth all men's understanding oh glory be to his marvelous name and so as i've said she met the serpent i will not dwell on who he was break down his personality his suspicion his cruelty but i will at this point deal with the fact that he approached her in genesis 3 and he said it wasn't her that spoke to him but he approached her as the devil will always approach the church and he said yes has god said in other words i agree with you that god said you shall not eat of every tree in the garden amen had god said you shall not eat of every tree in the garden and the bible tells us clearly here from we can see that satan was a a seed of discrepancy that he was planting for he was the second preacher in the bible he was a counterfeit preacher for god came down and had his services had his little church with his son and his daughter and would speak and preach peace to their heart but here comes this counterfeit devil this preacher that was a copycat of what god was doing and began to preach to her and he preached by asking a question which in most cases engenders doubt or speaks of doubt or misunderstanding or ignorance within the mind now remember he preached from the word of god for he quoted the word of god he said had god said you shall not eat of the trees that of the garden he was a preacher and he was preaching out of this same bible matter of fact if he were here today he would be preaching and quoting right out of this very bible and preaching the from god's word see amen listen he also prophesied yes he prophesied for he said you shall not surely die now that's a prophecy and the fact they did die which means that he was a false prophet he was contrary to god's word he was actually under the guise of a religious question was undermining her faith in the infallible word of god and so is it today with strifes and debates and analytics and all manner of questions that are engendered and strife that's being engendered it's nothing but the work of satan trying to undermine the word of god the foundations of the kingdom of the living god oh praise god hallelujah and so the very serpent deceived her and there we see it clearly frame that he told her lie and the lie was that he said to her god lied to you by telling you that if you eat you are going to die but i can tell you you shall not surely die so he actually deceived her by telling her that the word of from god was a lie my friends is the same lie being told in these last days to the modern day church that there are faults in the word of god there are mistakes in the word of god the word is god is not true in every area there are parts of it maybe you cannot rely on the devil will say and he is still a liar and a father life oh my think of it friend here they were one in one harmony together in that marvelous garden and the harmony they had was broken the harmony between the true church and the living god became broken because she wandered away from the word of god going into vain philosophy psychology going into theories of man going into all kinds of uh thoughts of man theologies of man and once she begins to do that she has wondered a away from the word of god as a wanton woman will wander away wander the streets away from her husband back to the word church back to the original husband jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and now because she wandered away from our husband the word of god the church was deceived eve was the seed a type of the church being deceived by satan satan said see seduced her by his worldliness by his fleshliness carnality blindness his evil spirit his character which was evil to its very core and so here was eve being persuaded by the very uh success deceived that she could live on and enjoy a wonderful wanton life but my friends that god doesn't play games with his word he says i the lord thy god i'm a jealous god and so here is the church of this modern age seeking success in every aspect in a search for money in a search for popularity in a search for political power now if we read from matthew chapter 4 we find this is about the temptation of our lord jesus christ he is being tempted by the devil and the last temptation i believe maybe that'll be the last one for the church also the temptation of being drawn into political power and uh the narcotic of an addiction and the pride and pop and popularity that goes along with a political power the bible reads as such and again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and said unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me and jesus said get thee hands satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou sword now here was satan the god of this evil age who had the power over all the kingdoms of the earth and even offered them all of its political power over to jesus christ thinking that he will pers persuade him that he would be able to twist him away from the word but he failed to realize jesus was the word for in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god not first second third fourth fifth sixth but the word was god and that is why he answered satan saying not the lord thy god for he knew who he was and satan also knew who he was satan is not an atheist satan believes for the bible says the devil believes enough to tremble amen forget the name of jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord amen so here it is my friend he turns to her and he said you shall not surely donnie this church tempted seduced by success popularity money political power this church is now being deceived saying you shall not surely die now notice he added one word to the genuine word of god now remember for a lie to be effective it cannot be a total complete lie like looking at a ball and telling someone it's a table that's an outright lie but you see a lie must have a tiny portion of truth in it so he quoted the word of god and wrapped up that around his line and fed it to her but in the words god's word was i'm not and here it is in revelation chapter 22 we can read for uh verse 18 for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of this prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of this book prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book so he added to the word of god one word leads to spiritual death where your name will be taken out of the book of life and condemnation sets in and so when the church begins to change god's unchangeable word when the church begins to allow herself to be persuaded to to to be uh enticed seduced by the devil with his enticing spirit anointing a lot of modern day preachers today that will not preach the truth will not preach even the fullness of the truth as i say they'll preach us a part of the truth enough the devil can take the rest and tell the biggest lie that he wishes to tell because they're only speaking part truth they'll leave out of hell they'll leave out sin they leave out the blood they'll leave out one god they'll leave up what really is the original sin was it eating an apple they won't tell you because it will upset their upper cart their meal ticket their position their popularity and their power it will take them out of that condition where they will have to stand with god alone and that is a terrifying thought to them to stand on their own in the presence of god think about it here it is friend that here the apostolic church founded in a pentecost with the presence of the living god hallelujah we find the apostolic church after john had died began to slowly wander away matter of fact the church had already began to slip and slide and wander even from the times of paul and paul made the observation that a grievous wolves have come amongst us brethren who are grievous wolf he recognized that there was a slipping the church was sliding the church was beginning to wonder some wandered back into legalism others like demons wandered away into worldliness demos has forsaken me heaven loved this present world and again some wandered into financial success and money for he said alexander the copper smith has done me much harm so there were people in the bible back there with the same attitude and the same spirit that were caught up with all of these endeavors and different things and wandering away slowly from the genuine unoriginal word of god listen i'm not here to keep anybody a true genuine son or daughter of god is kept by the word of god through their revelation of a true faith they are kept by the holy spirit he is your defense he is your leader he is your guide he is the one that protects for you provides for you he is the one that shows your love mercy and grace and in him we put our trust glory be to god hallelujah and so the apostolic church wandered away my friends into roman religious paganism disguise and presenting itself as christianity but it is paganism under the disguise of christianity and so the entire church world wandered away from the word of god we see in revelation chapter 2 verse 5 the bible tells us remember therefore from whence the word fallen god is speaking to the church at ephesus and already the church had backslid already the church were falling away from the original truth foundational doctrine apostolic teaching that god had given to them and the spirit of god speaking to the church seven churches is saying to the ephesian church age remember therefore from whence the word fallen and repent and do the first work or else i will come unto thee quickly and i will remove your candlestick out of his place except so rip in oh my friend the entire church wandered away deceived by denominations into denominationalism and they're nervous for standing alone upon the word of god they have to have a headquarters they have to have some type of superintendent pope bishop uh archbishop someone above them directing controlling and directing things amen but so this apostolic church wandered away from god's word for they wandered away from the teaching of one god one name by which we are saved one baptism one lord one faith not three thousand denominations not three thousand faith not a pagan faith not a worldly faith but one faith one lord one baptism in jesus name one lord and one birth thanks be to god hallelujah remember he was saying to the ephesian church from whence you have fallen in other words remember how you fell from pentecost remember what happened in the upper room and you are falling away from that into a state of worthiness and carnality oh my here we find the modern church in the same falling away from the world from the word of god into worthiness and caught up with the glitter and glamour of the age with the gold and the glory and now we are finding the church in a state of denominational chaos the navy national conflict and constant confusion oh my god she wandered away from holding us into worldliness and from purity as adam and eve my friends fell from innocence into the age of conscience even so this modern church has fallen from her state of spiritual innocence of the apostolic time until today we must ask the question does this modern church have a conscience is the conscience of the church seared with the hot iron have the church lost its balance and have wandered away from the word of god lost her standards lost all her position she lost her shame oh may god have mercy on this modern day butch calling itself the true church of the living god and hiding under the guise of christianity yes sincere and heart sha that worship is no more what we are presented with is can the worship the worship is so can under the guise and lie of satan that by canning the washer we can keep it fresh for a long time but let me tell you god already called israel do you don't you store up any of the mana for the next day for it will rot never mind how beautiful it looks it will rot but trust me i will send you new manner for every day and we should trust god in our day that god will and has sent new manner for us today and we ought to receive god's word for this day and for this hour and recognize this is not modern day pentecost this is back to the word the original pentecost to preach what paul prays to preach what the apostles preach to preach what the prophets and the original men of god pray oh stand up church of the living god come out of your darkness and come to the light so christ can give you life amen now the church is filled with plastic christians filled with practice performances filled with entertainment like samson entertain the world the church is now having stadiums filled to entertain the world filled and invaded with business management and she has lost her position of supernatural enablement my friends instead of miracles and the movement of god for revival and salvation now she depends on marketing to be able to draw multitudes she depends on public relation and has none of the power that penteco the original pentecost of acts 2 4 had now she's trying to sing him down she tried to music him with drums and beautiful uh orchestras she's trying to draw him down like ahab's prophet oh my god but elijah did not need all of that all he needed was this simple clear word of god and he knew god was with him and when he prayed the fire of god fell upon the sacrifice for if there is no sacrifice then how will the fire fall it must be the right sacrifice and then the fire will vindicate it confirm it and seal the faith of god's servant and of his servants and of his people instead of them looking to be prospects of god that will prophesy and speak god's word regardless their eyes have been blinded like balaam and instead of prophets now they're after profits they're searching for profit they're looking for numbers they've gone into the numbers game they're looking after the average take-in how much did we bring in today how much did this meeting make did we profit or did we meet the amount we spent or are we underwater that is the modern thinking instead of those things are of nothing to a true servant of the living god for god will make our way somehow when beneath the cross we bow yes a life committed and consumed by service to the living god as john wesley said i'd rather to burn out for god than to be sitting on the shelf somewhere we must be in service for the king and always be about the king's business and so here friends we are now confronted with men who call themselves preachers call themselves prophet but these are men and women who have never been to the desert they have never been taken by god to the mountain top experience of the holy spirit and the power of god they've never been to such a place instead of the call of god to go hungry to go sacrificial to god suffering to go into a state of crucifixion before a supernatural spiritual resurrection they know nothing about it and then instead of being called of god they're waiting to be called by the church called by the church but when god calls a man or calls a woman then he brings them in by his call into a supernatural born-again experience of the holy spirit and of course they recognize that they are not now being ordained that's just a a modern-day event witnessing to the world publicly that the individual was already ordained before the foundation of the world and it is now being recognized by his fellow brethren but true servants of god don't wait around for the last path part first but they wait for god's ordination god's called god's anointing god's presence god's leadership god's spirit confirming the word oh blessed be his name amen but what we find here friends that these wait to be called by the church to go to a seminary to have mans certification man's ordination to put on denominational blinders and to see the scriptures from the point of view that is only allowed by that particular denomination contrary to the word of the living god they see only what they want you to see in their theology and so you see that and you believe that and to wander out of those confines as many times to be kicked out to be expelled excluded put out of the fellowship and it's an awful shunning state for one to be in but true servants of god cares not about such things but they'll walk with god and god alone if necessary oh if you know the lord you need nobody else but to walk in fellowship with him and if there are others of the light precious faith you will find yourself walking hand in hand with god's little flock he is called out once by the grace of god hallelujah so we are not here for man's certification of man's ordination amen or to get a ba or a dd but to rest in the grace of god i'd rather to have god's original born-again experience and to be led by him into s supernatural spiritual adoption and divine recognition that you are a son or daughter of the living god god vindicating his word and testifying that you are his own oh praise god hallelujah the church which once had fellowship one with the other and with god the church the modern church has now become a battleship when the church should have been two fellows or more in one ship in fellowship that church has now become a battleship wars rumors of wars paul said wars fighting spreading fussing amongst you my god divisions everywhere but look upon it friends that fellowship because of the devil has become a battleship and now some of these churches have become so huge and become so successful in man's way of saying doing it saying it or recognizing it they have become so filled that they have become a cruise ship they cannot move with the speed and anointing of the quickening spirit and so it's become a cruise ship presenting you with a smoker's board of bible studies and you can have as much as you want 24 7. and if you're willing to feed on that that and fatten up yourself that's all right if you want a cruise ship or you want to live on a battleship but i'd rather to be in fellowship with the living god so that when i come to the end of life's way that god will say come thou good and faithful servant enter into the joy of the lord here you are on your cruise ship but must we be carried away on a flowery bed of religious ease no my brother sister we must fight like soldiers we must fight if we must reign fight against the powers of satan fight against evil and wickedness preach the truth without fear or favor oh glory to god and put your faith in him and god will make a way somehow a church has not changed no more zeal no more self-sacrifice no more faithfulness they're not going out by faith anymore we hardly have any real missionaries uh instead of missionaries we have opportunists i now want to be sure that the money is already there the financial support has to be already in place or they are not going and they call themselves true sons and daughters of god back to the bible no wonder man like peter and paul and john when they're accosted in the strength and a bigger ask them their answer was we are penniless we have no money silver and gold we have none but such as we have we give unto thee rise take up your bed and walk they had the coins of the kingdom but they had not the whirly coins of caesar all glory to god may god bring us back to the fabric of our faith the foundations of our faith and that raw primitive faith that relies on god alone not speaking words or just talking religious terms but trusting him in every aspect of your life's work and let him make a way for you here we are going as missionaries overseas seeking many times not solved but seeking gold seeking wealth seeking fame seeking fortune and deceiving their local natives many times corrupting many times the local population and there and jesus himself foresaw this and said their cross over sea land to go and make their disciples to fall more to kill the children of hell he said such a real hypocrite that jesus spoke about you will read about them in matthew chapter 6 matthew chapter 22 and matthew chapter 23 also the bible describes them in jude 11 to 13 woe unto them for they have god in the west came and ran greedily after the error of balaam for reward they were preaching for money they were serving god for gain yes they ran greedily after the error of balaam for reward and perished and again saying of four these are spots in your feasts of charity when they're fish with you feeding themselves without clouds are they without water carried about of every wind winds of doctrine trees whose fruit withering without fruit twice dead plopped up by the roof raging waves of the sea falling out their own shame wandering star let me say that again wandering stars i'm preaching about the wandering church wandering away from the word of god oh yes wandering away so whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever o friends jude speaks of these angels these messengers these preachers that kept not their first estate that did not stay in their position but by the spirit of rebellion upon them spirit of neglect in some cases just indifference to the word of god they don't take it seriously just enough to get a religious atmosphere and spirit around but they are indifferent to god's divine command and so god's church wandered away from his word and began to do its own will to fulfill their own uh twisted and perverted desires contrary to what's in this bible yes friends we're living in a dark dismal day the dark day for god's church but thank god the friday of the crucifixion of the word of god is passed and is passing and it's now the mourning of the rising of the sun of righteousness with healing and deliverance in his wings the truth and the light is coming up is coming up for its morning time watchman what of the night the morning coming amen hallelujah the light is coming morning is coming morning is here it is the rising of the sun a man has come and turned on the light the seals are now open on our hearts truly are ablaze with the presence of almighty god my friend maybe you have wandered away from god's voice maybe have wandered away from this message of god but now you're welcome home come home come home it's supper time maybe you have been walking in the darkness of sin doubt fear religious and denominational ignorance maybe you have been wearing blinders but rise shine for your light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee the hand and the heart of the lord god of heaven has chosen you once you come to him now please come and surrender your life to him tell him lord i'm sorry the choices i made for the things i have done i ask for your forgiveness lord i receive you into my life and come into my heart lord jesus come lord and i will walk with you as he invites you to come and walk with him as the song says come walk with me the way is straight and narrow come walk with me you cannot walk alone for the way is rough and there are many dangers [Music] oh bride come walk with me and i will see you home may you surrender your life to him and may he lead you home to his father's house god bless you until wednesday again for our next bible study of the church ages next sunday with our beautiful worship service and preaching of the anointed word let us come into his presence with thanksgiving and enter his sportsman praise until then god bless you [Music] you
