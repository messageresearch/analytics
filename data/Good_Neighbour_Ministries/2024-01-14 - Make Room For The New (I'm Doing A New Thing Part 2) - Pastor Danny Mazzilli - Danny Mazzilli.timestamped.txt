[37:46] everybody into the house of the Lord
[37:48] this morning God bless you worship team
[37:51] thank you so much brother Anthony thank
[37:54] you for the worship this morning
[37:57] oh it's good to Worship the Lord and get
[37:59] into Heavenly places in preparation for
[38:02] the word of God amen amen that's that's
[38:05] an absolute requirement you know it all
[38:07] starts when you wake up in the morning
[38:09] on Sunday morning you know um being
[38:12] being prayed up is such a a
[38:16] powerful um
[38:18] Advantage if I could say um you know uh
[38:22] you want to pray in the morning you want
[38:24] to come with expectation in your hearts
[38:26] you want to know that um that you're
[38:28] going to meet the Living God Amen in
[38:31] this day and in this hour you know
[38:32] that's what makes us so different from
[38:34] the rest of the the the the church world
[38:37] like you know I'm not putting down
[38:39] anybody or anything but it's all based
[38:42] on your own faith and your own
[38:43] experience with God and you know you
[38:46] choose the way you want to worship and
[38:48] serve the Lord Jesus and um and worship
[38:51] him on Sunday mornings but um as a as a
[38:55] son or a daughter of of God that's
[38:57] really come into that understanding and
[39:00] realization of the word of God for this
[39:02] day and that God is alive that the Lord
[39:04] Jesus is alive he's present he's um he's
[39:08] he's walking the the the pews Walking
[39:11] The Halls walking in the Sunday school
[39:14] he's a living God that wants to
[39:16] fellowship and move in the midst of his
[39:18] people amen and when you come into that
[39:21] atmosphere and that understanding you
[39:23] know it's it's it's levels of
[39:25] consciousness right you can walk into a
[39:27] room and um and you could be conscious
[39:30] of only one thing because that's where
[39:33] your mind is constantly on so if you
[39:36] know if you come into the place and your
[39:39] mind is on
[39:40] Sports and you know there's another
[39:42] brother whose mind is on Sports the
[39:45] first thing you do when you come to
[39:46] church is you go to talk to that other
[39:48] brother about
[39:49] sports it's just it's just you know that
[39:51] that's just how the mind works right
[39:54] we're we're we're humans right and so
[39:57] but if you come in because you've been
[39:59] having fellowship with the Lord you've
[40:01] been you're under expectation you read
[40:03] the word this morning you say wow praise
[40:05] God this is wonderful and then you come
[40:07] into the the house of the Lord and he
[40:09] starts to he starts to actually repeat
[40:11] those scriptures back to you amen he
[40:14] starts to give you understanding on what
[40:16] you read this morning now you've entered
[40:18] into a fellowship that's completely
[40:20] different you see you come with
[40:23] expectation to meet the Living God
[40:26] and now you know he knows your hurts he
[40:29] knows your burdens he knows your needs
[40:31] okay and and so if you come with that
[40:34] kind of a heart of expectation guess
[40:36] what you're going to leave
[40:38] rejoicing you might be sad but you'll
[40:41] leave glad amen you might be depressed

[48:37] you know just a quick review we were
[48:39] looking at um God doing something new
[48:41] and we read from the scriptures from the
[48:44] book of uh Exodus 12 ver1 where the Lord
[48:48] spake unto Moses and Aaron and said that
[48:50] this month shall be unto you the
[48:52] beginning of months it shall be the
[48:53] first month of the year for you God was
[48:56] declaring something to the children of
[48:58] Israel that he was going to start
[49:00] something brand new he was going to give
[49:02] them a new beginning they had been under
[49:05] bondage for 400 years they had not known
[49:08] anything different they had just known
[49:10] the way they were brought up and the way
[49:12] they were taught and the way that they
[49:14] that all they knew was was was the whip
[49:17] that's all they knew is that if they
[49:18] didn't if they didn't obey the whip
[49:20] would come down the whip would come down
[49:22] but God doesn't operate that way with
[49:24] his people no sir God says if you obey I
[49:28] Will Bless he says I will bless you I
[49:31] will give you a brand new start and you
[49:34] can change from this day on I'm going to
[49:37] create a new life a new future I'm going
[49:40] to give you I'm going to place my heart
[49:42] inside of you and you will know that I
[49:44] am your God and that you are my people
[49:47] amen he's a jealous God Amen praise God
[49:51] and so he was declaring that to Israel
[49:53] that it was a time for deliverance time
[49:55] time to move on time to go and inherit
[49:58] the promises of God Amen this for Israel
[50:01] was a new beginning a fresh start
[50:04] Hallelujah they are now at the threshold
[50:07] of stepping over into their destiny the
[50:11] destiny that God had planned for them he
[50:13] was silent for 400 years amen but he's
[50:17] silent no more that's how he always does
[50:20] it Saints he he just becomes to he just
[50:23] comes to a place where he wants to do
[50:25] something new and how does he do it he
[50:28] becomes real to the people he starts to
[50:31] manifest himself in the Supernatural he
[50:34] starts doing things in your life and our
[50:36] lives personally that we cannot deny
[50:39] this is the Living God this is God that
[50:43] called me this is not some church not
[50:46] some uh tradition because Mom and Dad
[50:49] belong to church I'm going to belong to
[50:51] church no sir this is a reality this is
[50:53] how God comes on the scene calling his
[50:56] people and says I'm going to do
[50:58] something fresh and something new amen
[51:00] praise God you know um in Psalms 138:8
[51:05] we read last week you can put it on I
[51:07] believe it's the next slide he says the
[51:09] Lord will perfect that which concerneth
[51:13] me Hallelujah God's concerned about you
[51:18] amen don't be looking to the left or to
[51:19] the right don't be looking to you know
[51:22] to the conditions God is concerned about
[51:25] you and he has plans for you amen thy
[51:28] mercy oh Lord endureth forever forsake
[51:31] not the works of thine own hands amen
[51:36] God's own hands are going to come upon
[51:38] your life amen God's Own Direction and
[51:41] God's Own purpose is going to come into
[51:44] your life and change things and he's
[51:46] going to do it in such a way that you
[51:48] will be
[51:49] amazed God can make things new and can
[51:52] change things and and he works in the
[51:54] Supernatural brother philli amen amen he
[51:57] works in the Supernatural praise God
[52:00] hallelujah amen so God says I will do a
[52:03] new thing amen and you know what when he
[52:06] brought those children out he brought
[52:08] them out it says in in Psalms 105 he
[52:11] brought them forth also with silver and
[52:14] gold and there was not one feeble person
[52:17] among their tribes amen God knows your
[52:20] needs in
[52:21] 2024 he knows your your financial needs
[52:24] amen he knows your health issues things
[52:28] that you may be facing right now and
[52:30] things that you might have to face down
[52:32] the road but he says not one feeble not
[52:36] one feeble amongst my people if you can
[52:39] believe that and if you can accept that
[52:41] and you can receive that you can you can
[52:44] experience that amen you don't have to
[52:46] be feeble you don't have to be sick you
[52:49] can say Lord You're The God That Health

[53:31] were burdening you listen listen God can
[53:35] lift your burdens the Lord can lift your
[53:38] burdens just like that he can do it
[53:41] believe it Saints you don't have to stay
[53:43] in that oppressed condition all the
[53:45] reason why you're staying in that
[53:47] oppressed condition is because you

[54:33] room they don't want to let go of some
[54:35] of the things from the past you know we
[54:38] carry things from the past and and and
[54:40] and you know we just want to carry it
[54:41] and oh poor old me you know I had such a
[54:44] terrible
[54:46] upbringing there's just no way I could
[54:48] have a good future all the scars of the
[54:52] past you don't have to carry them
[54:54] anymore

[54:59] let go of every single thing that
[55:02] brought you down in the past I'm telling
[55:04] you you got to empty out so that God can
[55:08] refill amen let's read the scripture
[55:11] Isaiah 54: 1-5 says sing O baren thou
[55:16] that did not bear Break Forth into
[55:20] singing and cry aloud thou that did not
[55:24] TR veil with child for more are the
[55:27] children of the desolate than the
[55:29] children of the married wife sayeth the
[55:31] Lord now I want you to just as we're
[55:34] reading this I want you to I want to
[55:36] bring it to today and I want you to see
[55:38] the type and what it is that the Lord is
[55:41] saying here amen he's saying here that
[55:44] you know that um you may have felt
[55:46] Barren you may have felt like you know
[55:48] that you weren't bringing forth fruit in
[55:50] your life and things are just remaining
[55:52] the same and there's been no life
[55:54] because he talking about a woman here
[55:56] for you know to to bring forth children
[55:58] but but the type is life we need to read
[56:01] between the lines here so open your
[56:03] thoughts and expand your thinking let
[56:05] the spirit of God for more are the
[56:07] children of the desolate listen the
[56:09] world is full of
[56:11] unbelief and you're surrounded by it
[56:14] every single day you're you're you're
[56:16] bombarded by it and you got to be
[56:18] careful cuz a lot of people you know
[56:20] what they get so caught up in the
[56:22] negative that they want to allow that to
[56:25] become their experience they want to say
[56:28] well you know what what hope do I have
[56:30] look at the condition of the world look
[56:32] at the wars that are going on look at
[56:34] this and look at that and and and and
[56:37] many are the children of the desolate
[56:40] people that don't know God that don't
[56:42] want to receive God that don't want the
[56:44] hope of a new future the hope of
[56:48] Salvation listen we're Christians for a
[56:52] purpose because God expressed salvation
[56:55] that day on
[56:57] Calvary salvation from what from this
[57:02] salvation from the the the the the
[57:04] failures of this world and the falling
[57:07] apart and the conditions of the world we
[57:09] can barely bring our children up in
[57:11] schools that will still allow God in the
[57:16] school we're living in a place where
[57:19] there's so much desolate but he's saying
[57:22] that that you that you are not uh
[57:26] desolate because you're married to
[57:29] him the married wife we're talking about
[57:32] the bride of Christ the True Church of
[57:34] the Living God that has taken Christ as
[57:37] their savior as their redeemer as their
[57:42] husband as their provider Oh Glory to
[57:46] God so so listen what he says here he
[57:48] says he says enlarge the place of thy
[57:53] tent make room
[57:55] room you need to make some room here
[57:58] enlarge thy tent he says and let them
[58:02] stretch forth curtains of thine
[58:05] habitations Oh Glory to God you're going
[58:08] to have so much room when you come under
[58:11] this Revelation that God is going to do
[58:13] something new in your life that that
[58:15] that he's going to pour in more than
[58:17] what you could possibly imagine
[58:20] Hallelujah he says spare not he says l
[58:25] thy cords and stretch thy Stakes he says
[58:28] put them out don't you be afraid to
[58:31] declare that this house now is is being
[58:34] led by the Lord himself don't you be
[58:38] afraid to put out the barriers and the
[58:40] stakes to show the people listen the
[58:42] tribes of Israel they would put
[58:43] boundaries in their land because they
[58:46] would they would keep the squatters out
[58:48] of their land make a decision that no
[58:50] squatters are going to come into your
[58:52] land amen for thou shalt break forth on
[58:55] the right hand on the left and thy and
[58:59] thy seed shall
[59:01] inherit the
[59:04] Gentiles what you mean he's talking
[59:07] about
[59:09] today about the
[59:11] church the True Church of Christ the
[59:15] bride this message of Christianity came
[59:18] to the
[59:19] Gentiles it came to the Gentiles God
[59:22] knew that Israel was going to reject
[59:25] their Messiah but he also knew that
[59:28] there would be a people that would
[59:29] receive his word amen it's all through
[59:33] the scripture Saints if you can't see
[59:35] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[59:37] and forever you need to go back and read
[59:40] it over

[1:03:31] in one there's no such thing the Old
[1:03:34] Testament was the Lord God that was
[1:03:38] condescending down when he was talking
[1:03:40] about the Mighty God the counselor the
[1:03:44] Prince of Peace who were they who was
[1:03:46] Isaiah talking about he was talking
[1:03:49] about the Lord that he was going to
[1:03:51] condescend and he would become the
[1:03:53] Messiah
[1:03:55] of the people it's not another God it's
[1:03:58] not God the Father in Heaven the son on
[1:04:01] earth and the Holy Spirit moving in our
[1:04:03] midst it's all God in his three offices
[1:04:07] listen I'm a
[1:04:09] father I'm also a son I'm the son of
[1:04:13] Dominic and Ida
[1:04:15] missil I'm a human
[1:04:17] being my name is Danny that's my name
[1:04:23] I'm the the same person though and when
[1:04:26] Jesus stood there before his disciples
[1:04:28] after he had been risen from the dead
[1:04:31] listen to what he said Matthew
[1:04:32] 28:19 all power how much more than all
[1:04:37] is there no
[1:04:39] more no more can somebody please give me
[1:04:42] a all description of all all things
[1:04:47] beginning and up down nothing else all
[1:04:51] power has been given unto me in heaven
[1:04:55] but wait a minute I thought God the
[1:04:56] father was in
[1:04:58] heaven and he had all the power yeah he
[1:05:01] does but Jesus was expressing himself
[1:05:05] God on earth right in heaven and on
[1:05:09] Earth all power he says now go ye and
[1:05:13] make disciples baptizing them and this
[1:05:16] is where this is where the enemy came in
[1:05:19] and put his own interpretation go back
[1:05:22] to 325 ad you'll find out that church
[1:05:26] and state came together there was a big
[1:05:28] Nia council meeting and they decided at
[1:05:31] that point after 325 years that they
[1:05:35] were going to inject the trinitarian
[1:05:38] doctrine of Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:05:40] three persons in one three separate
[1:05:42] entities in one call it what there's no
[1:05:44] such thing he says go into all nations
[1:05:48] and teach
[1:05:51] them baptizing them in the name n a m
[1:05:58] not names name and he goes of the father
[1:06:03] and of the son and of the Holy
[1:06:06] Spirit now Jesus was standing right
[1:06:10] there and Peter was there and all the
[1:06:13] other Apostles and they knew very well
[1:06:16] what he was saying because on the day of
[1:06:19] Pentecost Acts
[1:06:22] 2:38 after the spirit because the the
[1:06:24] Lord told him go into the upper room and
[1:06:26] wait because I'm going to Endo you with
[1:06:29] a power that is going to change this
[1:06:32] world forever amen he says you shall be
[1:06:36] my people amen you're the ones that are
[1:06:38] going to go tell them about this formula
[1:06:41] that I've given you and they all
[1:06:44] received the Holy Ghost and they went
[1:06:46] into the streets now watch Peter was
[1:06:48] present when Jesus said all power unto
[1:06:51] me not unto us
[1:06:54] unto me just like he said to philli when
[1:06:56] Philip went to him and says Lord you've
[1:06:58] been talking about the father you know
[1:06:59] show us the father you're telling us you
[1:07:01] know while he was with the disciples he
[1:07:03] looks he says Phillip have I been with
[1:07:05] you so long he says if you see me you
[1:07:08] see the father it is I I am with you
[1:07:13] just like he told the woman at the well
[1:07:15] they said Oh Our Father said that when
[1:07:17] when when Messiah comes he will do these
[1:07:20] things Jesus turned and looked at the
[1:07:23] woman at the well and said I am he read
[1:07:27] your
[1:07:28] scripture it's it's right there in front
[1:07:30] of your face it's simple but they don't
[1:07:33] want to receive that and you know that
[1:07:35] that is such an important element it
[1:07:38] changed my whole walk with God because
[1:07:40] now I knew who I was worshiping I knew
[1:07:43] what he's doing I knew what he had done
[1:07:45] I knew what he's going to do and it
[1:07:47] changes everything and Peter right there
[1:07:51] on the day of Pentecost when the people
[1:07:52] said after they heard them speaking in
[1:07:54] their languages and they were God was
[1:07:57] speaking to them and Peter and and they
[1:07:59] looked to Peter and they said what must
[1:08:01] we do to be to be saved what must we do
[1:08:04] to receive this that you have and he
[1:08:06] said repent he says turn away from your
[1:08:09] old ideas and thoughts and
[1:08:12] traditions and he says be baptized in
[1:08:16] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ read
[1:08:20] it there's over 3,000 baptisms in the
[1:08:24] book of Acts and every one of them was
[1:08:25] done in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:27] Christ you'll see nowhere that it was
[1:08:30] done in the titles of Father Son and
[1:08:33] Holy Ghost I challenge anybody to show
[1:08:36] me where it was ever physically done
[1:08:40] I'll show you in the book of Acts
[1:08:42] thousands of baptisms and everyone in
[1:08:44] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:47] another one Acts 19 listen we could get
[1:08:49] into all kinds of scripture here but we
[1:08:52] want to move on but we know who Our
[1:08:54] Redeemer is amen we know who's called us
[1:08:57] amen hallelujah let's go to the next
[1:09:00] slide so in Luke uh St Luke Chapter
[1:09:04] 5 praise God we're going to read that in
[1:09:07] just a minute but just a couple of
[1:09:09] thoughts here we need to expand our
[1:09:11] minds to make room we need to make room
[1:09:15] and one of those rooms is the room of
[1:09:17] tradition we need to we need to clear
[1:09:19] out those old paintings those old uh
[1:09:22] ideas all those old way
[1:09:24] we need to we we need to clear out all
[1:09:26] those old teachings that that were that
[1:09:28] were instilled in our lives from growing
[1:09:30] up you know some of us were brought up
[1:09:32] in Catholic schools some of us were
[1:09:34] brought up in in in in non-Christian
[1:09:36] schools and we were taught one was
[1:09:38] taught that there is a God but then they
[1:09:40] were taught that you got to pray to the
[1:09:41] Virgin Mary you got to pray to St this
[1:09:43] one St that one St Christopher if you
[1:09:45] want good if you want to travel
[1:09:47] somewhere you know these are all
[1:09:49] traditions and teachings of man there's
[1:09:52] nowhere in the scripture
[1:09:54] that you will find prayers of the Saints
[1:09:57] praying to the Saints we believe in the
[1:10:00] in the in the in the uh uh prayers of
[1:10:03] the Saints uh the Apostles Creed what
[1:10:06] Apostles Creed there was one Apostles
[1:10:09] Creed repent and be baptized in the name
[1:10:11] of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall
[1:10:13] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[1:10:16] when the Holy Ghost comes to you Jesus
[1:10:18] says he will guide you I will lead you
[1:10:21] into all truth that's what you need
[1:10:24] that's the Apostles Creed amen that's
[1:10:26] what we need to receive this morning
[1:10:28] there's no prayers you know for to uh
[1:10:31] you know Hail Mary and all of these
[1:10:33] things Mary she's our sister God chose
[1:10:36] her blessed above all women because she
[1:10:38] brought forth the body of Jesus Christ
[1:10:41] she's blessed but she's not the mother
[1:10:44] of God no there's no such how can God
[1:10:47] have a mother I'm just talking straight
[1:10:48] up here he says I am Alpha I am the
[1:10:51] Omega I'm the beginning and I'm the end
[1:10:53] so how does God have a have a mother
[1:10:57] Jesus listen when Mary was there and the
[1:11:00] and the angel Gabriel came to her said
[1:11:02] the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost shall
[1:11:05] overshadow
[1:11:07] you and that moment that he spoke God's
[1:11:10] word he spoke a seed into her womb and
[1:11:15] she said be it unto me according to Thy
[1:11:18] word his word is a seed she received his
[1:11:22] seed and right from that moment her life
[1:11:25] was completely changed amen hallelujah
[1:11:27] she's our sister we will rejoice with
[1:11:30] her we will give her praise and and and
[1:11:34] and for for for being strong and
[1:11:36] courageous to be able to stand in the
[1:11:38] midst of that unbelief where people
[1:11:40] thought she was a prostitute she had
[1:11:42] been with another man oh how dare she
[1:11:45] even Joseph thought you know that people
[1:11:47] said how could he possibly take a woman
[1:11:49] that's already with child she had to
[1:11:51] stand the reproach of the word of God
[1:11:53] amen and we need to stand the reproach
[1:11:56] of the word of God when we tell the
[1:11:58] people the truth hallelujah praise God
[1:12:01] this is the truth Saints we need to get
[1:12:03] rid of the boundaries in our minds that
[1:12:05] have become barriers those boundaries
[1:12:08] that we place in our minds you know
[1:12:10] tradition and stuff like that they
[1:12:11] become the barriers of what God wants to
[1:12:14] do in your life to expand your thinking
[1:12:16] to expand your ability to to expand your
[1:12:19] Revelation to know that he's a living
[1:12:22] God he's present amen glory to God but
[1:12:26] sometimes we gather all kinds of junk
[1:12:28] you know like I was saying listen our
[1:12:30] garage is designed to put cars into
[1:12:35] them we all forget about
[1:12:37] that and we tend to fill it with all
[1:12:40] kinds of stuff and guess what we can't
[1:12:43] even fit our cars in
[1:12:46] there but you need to move the junk out
[1:12:49] in order to put the cars
[1:12:51] in the garage was designed for
[1:12:55] cars you've been designed to be an
[1:12:58] inhabit of the word of God thank you
[1:13:01] Jesus the spirit of God wants to live in
[1:13:03] you wants to possess you wants to give
[1:13:06] you Clarity of mind and allow you to
[1:13:09] look into your future and see that it's
[1:13:11] all clear because we don't know what the
[1:13:13] future holds but we know who holds the
[1:13:16] future hallelujah praise God that's what
[1:13:19] we that's what we are holding to Saints
[1:13:21] that's what we believe amen so we need
[1:13:23] to expect great things from God and
[1:13:26] attempt great things with God you got to
[1:13:30] come out of that shell you got to be
[1:13:32] willing to to be courageous you got to
[1:13:35] be willing to stand on this word and
[1:13:37] tell the people what is the truth amen
[1:13:39] you don't have to drive it down
[1:13:40] anybody's throat remember Jesus said
[1:13:43] very clearly this is the beautiful thing
[1:13:45] that you know that that should set every
[1:13:47] son and daughter every Christian free he
[1:13:50] said no man comes to me
[1:13:53] L my spirit my father he's talking about
[1:13:57] the almighty the spirit of God he was he
[1:14:01] was in a human vessel displaying the
[1:14:05] human sacrifice but it was still God so
[1:14:07] he had to he had to uh you know
[1:14:10] associate in that way because he was
[1:14:12] moving with with with carnal people
[1:14:14] human beings but those that received the
[1:14:16] spirit of Truth they they had a
[1:14:18] revelation on what he was saying yes
[1:14:20] Lord that's you up there that's you
[1:14:22] right in front of me
[1:14:23] but you he says no man comes L my father
[1:14:27] draws him l no man can come unless God
[1:14:30] draws God pulls my sheep hear my voice I
[1:14:35] didn't hear Brother Gabriel's voice that
[1:14:37] day when I went into his his furniture
[1:14:39] room I heard him he he was talking you
[1:14:42] know he was talking like a guy that was
[1:14:44] like you know kind of like you know oh
[1:14:46] yeah that's good you know like he he he
[1:14:49] didn't he didn't he he was oh praise the
[1:14:52] Lord you know I said to him I said I he
[1:14:55] goes to me he says are you a Christian
[1:14:58] it was like he was asking me a question
[1:14:59] like you know like you know it was it
[1:15:01] was like I felt a little bit you know
[1:15:04] moved right I said I said I don't know I
[1:15:09] had to tell him the truth I was brought
[1:15:11] up this way you know if if if if
[1:15:14] Christianity is you know the Roman
[1:15:16] Catholic church or whatever uh I'm a
[1:15:20] hypocrite because I ain't living the
[1:15:22] word of God
[1:15:23] not even close but something spoke out
[1:15:27] of those lips behind that that word
[1:15:31] there was a
[1:15:33] call when he said are you a Christian no
[1:15:35] that was God saying come my son it's
[1:15:37] time I didn't know I didn't have any
[1:15:40] idea but that was God speaking and when
[1:15:42] God handed me the tape to listen to a
[1:15:44] minister that that that that that was
[1:15:46] making sense something takes place on
[1:15:49] the inside and that's why I'm saying to
[1:15:51] you we're going to look at some things
[1:15:52] here today I believe that is going to
[1:15:54] that's going to break a lot of barriers
[1:15:56] and it's going to allow you to make room
[1:15:58] for the new amen but but we got to let
[1:16:01] let's move on praise God and so St Luke
[1:16:04] 5: 36-39 it says and he spake also a
[1:16:09] parable unto them no man putteth a piece
[1:16:11] of new garment upon an old if otherwise
[1:16:15] then both the new maketh a rent and the
[1:16:18] peace that was taken out of the new
[1:16:20] agree not with the old and no man
[1:16:23] putteth new wine into Old bottles else
[1:16:26] the new wine will burst the bottles and
[1:16:28] be spilled and the bottles Shall Perish
[1:16:31] but new
[1:16:32] wine new
[1:16:34] things new
[1:16:36] revelation new uh move of God still the
[1:16:40] same
[1:16:42] God must be put into new
[1:16:45] bottles you got to be willing to let go
[1:16:49] of all the old you got to empty right
[1:16:50] out and you got to let the holy SP
[1:16:53] Spirit regenerate
[1:16:55] you regeneration comes through
[1:16:58] baptism that when you go into that tank
[1:17:02] and you receive baptism in the name of
[1:17:04] the Lord Jesus Christ it is a type of
[1:17:08] death burial because you go under the
[1:17:11] water and Resurrection to New Life and
[1:17:15] when that takes place in your life
[1:17:17] you're a new
[1:17:19] bottle Hallelujah brand spanking new and
[1:17:24] you can start to take some of that new
[1:17:26] wine new wine I'll tell you new wine can
[1:17:30] burst I've seen it happen I I grew up
[1:17:33] making wine with my father every single
[1:17:35] year and I would see sometimes you know
[1:17:37] he would put the the the the tops on a
[1:17:39] little bit too tight you know or put a
[1:17:41] cork in there thinking that you know it
[1:17:42] was okay to Cork it come out the next
[1:17:44] day and there's wine everywhere because
[1:17:47] the corks exploded because the wine was
[1:17:49] still fermenting but that's like you and
[1:17:52] me I remember when I first came to the
[1:17:54] Lord I couldn't shut up I couldn't wait
[1:17:57] to tell the people I was bursting and
[1:18:00] bubbling and making a mess all over the
[1:18:02] place hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:18:05] that's what happens when you receive
[1:18:07] this new wine amen it's a revelation
[1:18:09] that you cannot contain you cannot
[1:18:11] explain it just bubbles inside of you it
[1:18:14] just it just changes you it just G gives
[1:18:17] you life beyond measure amen no man also
[1:18:20] having drunk old wine straight way
[1:18:23] desireth the new for he sayith the old
[1:18:25] is better and that's the way it is out
[1:18:27] there don't think it's easy to to to
[1:18:30] tell people about this new wine because
[1:18:33] people like aged wine people like to
[1:18:35] stick with their aged wine they don't
[1:18:36] want something new they know that it's a
[1:18:38] little bit too much you know I can't
[1:18:40] take it it's going to it's going to
[1:18:42] throw them off a little bit hallelujah
[1:18:44] praise God but God wants to fill us with
[1:18:47] brand new wine amen and he wants to know
[1:18:50] that you're a brand new bottle this
[1:18:52] morning morning you got to be willing to
[1:18:55] be brand new you got to be willing to
[1:18:57] let the spirit of God transform you and
[1:19:00] change you from the condition that
[1:19:02] you're currently in to the new condition
[1:19:06] amen praise God forever
[1:19:09] more he wants to inspire us with new
[1:19:13] wine which is present
[1:19:14] truth that's what new wine is amen and
[1:19:18] in that new wine there's Revelation for
[1:19:21] a rapture
[1:19:23] there's Revelation that you can be
[1:19:25] changed that not only will your life
[1:19:28] from that day that you start to receive

[1:21:27] me all the same listen we quote the same
[1:21:30] scriptures we talk about the same Lord
[1:21:33] Jesus but yet why is it that it's
[1:21:37] different when we speak it than when
[1:21:41] others speak it without Revelation it's
[1:21:44] because there's no
[1:21:45] Revelation there's no understanding they
[1:21:48] haven't got the mind of Christ to
[1:21:52] understand the word word it's as simple
[1:21:54] as that if the spirit of God is in you
[1:21:57] it will guide you to all truth amen
[1:22:00] simple simple simple amen but that faith
[1:22:05] that that God is releasing right now in

[1:22:33] Revelation you got to stand and sit long
[1:22:36] enough to allow the spirit of God to
[1:22:38] speak to you and and make it simple and
[1:22:40] plain amen praise God new wine of
[1:22:43] Revelation for this hour amen glory to

[1:23:01] sees us and the way God
[1:23:03] wants to perfect in you the work that he

[1:23:26] enlarge your vision you will see things
[1:23:28] that you never saw before you will see
[1:23:31] Deliverance like you never saw before
[1:23:34] you will recognize that God can do
[1:23:36] things that you thought you couldn't get
[1:23:38] rid of you couldn't deal with but God
[1:23:40] can do it all you got to do is allow the
[1:23:42] vision to be expanded amen allow our
[1:23:45] challenges to be challenged amen how can
[1:23:49] how can you stretch yourself and do more
[1:23:51] in the body of Christ Christ what can
[1:23:53] you do to get into your position into
[1:23:55] your office because when you're called
[1:23:58] to the body of Christ we just finished
[1:24:00] you know and we're still in that series
[1:24:02] of seeing ourselves in the word
[1:24:04] positioning our ourselves in the word
[1:24:06] and we're going to continue with that
[1:24:07] this Wednesday night so but but God

[1:24:34] church just become a tradition you know
[1:24:36] that you just go to church on Sundays
[1:24:39] get into the house of the Lord anytime
[1:24:40] you can get into the house of the Lord
[1:24:42] get into prayer when you know that
[1:24:44] you're going into the house of the Lord
[1:24:45] get into prayer before you start your
[1:24:48] day let God be an every single moment
[1:24:52] part of your life not to be overly
[1:24:55] religious I'm not talking about that I
[1:24:57] hang out with my friends I love my
[1:24:59] friends and I want to live the life that
[1:25:02] Christ gave me in front of my friends so
[1:25:05] that that influence of Christ can
[1:25:08] influence them to live better if
[1:25:10] possible you know to quit their swearing
[1:25:12] you know a lot of them when they're
[1:25:13] around me now when they do swear they're
[1:25:15] always
[1:25:17] apologizing oh Danny sorry you know I
[1:25:20] said Thank you for having respect unto
[1:25:22] the Lord amen I'm just a man okay we all
[1:25:27] make mistakes but I but I but I thank
[1:25:30] you for being respectful unto the Lord
[1:25:32] amen praise God they're conscious of God
[1:25:36] Amen and that's what's important that's
[1:25:38] how we have an influence in the world
[1:25:40] that we live in amen praise God so we
[1:25:43] have to take responsibility also we need
[1:25:46] to expand and take responsibility for
[1:25:49] the things and and be faithful in the
[1:25:51] current things that God has us to
[1:25:54] do because if you can be trusted and be
[1:25:57] responsible in the things that you're
[1:25:59] currently doing God can add more you see
[1:26:02] that's another way of God making space
[1:26:05] in your life when you're good and you're
[1:26:09] faithful to the responsibilities that
[1:26:12] you already have I praise God for those
[1:26:15] that are faithful in the media faithful
[1:26:18] in the cleaning committee faithful in
[1:26:20] the trustee office faithful in the
[1:26:22] Deacon's office faithful in the ushers
[1:26:24] positions faithful in keeping the house
[1:26:27] of the Lord in such a way that we can be
[1:26:30] proud amen praise God these are faithful
[1:26:33] calls and faithful positions and God is
[1:26:36] going to bless you regardless of whether
[1:26:38] you want to be blessed or not it's
[1:26:39] coming your way oh glory to God listen
[1:26:43] when that email went out and said
[1:26:45] cleaners wanted that was another way of
[1:26:47] God saying I want to bless some people I
[1:26:50] want to pour out some blessings you know
[1:26:52] what they're going to work they're
[1:26:54] putting in their seven eight hours some
[1:26:55] of them are sleeping in too much some of
[1:26:58] them are are are are taking too many
[1:27:00] sick days I think I need to bring them
[1:27:02] into the house of the Lord and get them
[1:27:03] to do some work and then I can pay them
[1:27:05] with something that they'll never ever
[1:27:08] ever regret Hallelujah if God you get on
[1:27:12] God's payroll look out it's coming God's
[1:27:15] payroll it's from Glory Hallelujah which
[1:27:19] bank Eternal Bank Hallelujah which
[1:27:22] insurance company eternal life
[1:27:25] hallelujah praise God that's what you
[1:27:27] can receive when you become a part of
[1:27:30] this wonderful economy of God Amen
[1:27:33] praise
[1:27:34] God Glory
[1:27:36] Hallelujah so you know what as we
[1:27:40] expand the wrong thing to say is Lord
[1:27:43] take away my problems that's the wrong
[1:27:45] thing to say okay because now you're
[1:27:48] focused on the problems you should be
[1:27:51] saying Lord expand my ability to handle
[1:27:55] the things that I can't
[1:27:57] control expand my faith so that I can
[1:28:00] overcome the things that look like
[1:28:03] problems to me but not to you it's not a
[1:28:06] problem to you Lord you can give Faith
[1:28:09] to overcome anything because the Gates
[1:28:12] of Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:28:15] Revelation and when God wants to give
[1:28:17] you faith in the word of God God wants
[1:28:19] to give you Revelation over that
[1:28:21] mountain or that situation Satan cannot
[1:28:25] stop it Jesus said the Gates of Hell
[1:28:29] shall not Prevail against that
[1:28:32] instruction that divine revelation
[1:28:34] that's my mind speaking into your
[1:28:37] situation glory to God Amen and so we
[1:28:40] need to ask God to expand our ability to
[1:28:45] handle
[1:28:47] pressure you're built for it you're an
[1:28:51] eagle you don't have to be Bal to be an
[1:28:54] eagle you're an eagle God has designed
[1:28:57] you to fly higher and and and into
[1:29:00] places and and under certain
[1:29:03] circumstances and storms look at that
[1:29:05] eagle man when he when he sets his mind
[1:29:08] on something he pierces through the
[1:29:10] storms all he does is he goes higher he
[1:29:13] allows the spirit of God to speak to him
[1:29:15] and say come up hither my son I've got
[1:29:18] something prepared for you amen you
[1:29:20] don't have to stay in that in that in
[1:29:22] that chicken pen you were not
[1:29:25] born a chicken you were born an eagle
[1:29:28] amen when you heard this message this
[1:29:30] Revelation there was a there was a call
[1:29:32] in there that was an uncertain sound
[1:29:34] that only you and God there was a deep
[1:29:37] call to the Deep God was calling you out
[1:29:39] of that chicken pen God was calling you
[1:29:41] out of a life of of of misery depression
[1:29:44] oppression he's doing it today am that's
[1:29:47] what he's saying today he says all you
[1:29:49] got to do is is let me do something new
[1:29:52] your life expand your thinking expand
[1:29:54] your ability to receive my word amen
[1:29:57] praise God hallelujah so ask them to to
[1:30:00] you know sometimes when the new comes
[1:30:03] in we we want to try and protect the old
[1:30:07] because the new looks like it's a bit of
[1:30:08] a
[1:30:09] threat it's as simple as that you know
[1:30:12] people get threatened by new things but
[1:30:15] we need to understand that that's all
[1:30:17] part of the process of Deliverance amen
[1:30:20] praise God at first in looks like a
[1:30:22] threat puts you under tension makes you
[1:30:25] a little nervous oh I don't know if I
[1:30:27] can stand in this position do you think
[1:30:28] that I I'm ner
[1:30:31] listen ask my wife okay it's not easy to
[1:30:37] what I've been called to here there's
[1:30:39] been some serious battles going on but
[1:30:42] God is the one I trust amen and it
[1:30:45] doesn't matter if it takes me to my
[1:30:48] grave I will have finished my course
[1:30:52] that's the way I'm looking at it I'm
[1:30:54] it's not easy I'm I'm I'm nervous
[1:30:56] sometimes I I I get I get I get I I get
[1:30:59] scared sometimes that's human that's
[1:31:02] just that's just who I am I I think
[1:31:04] sometimes I'm going to get up on the
[1:31:05] stage and I'm going to start to minister
[1:31:07] and and my mind's going to go blank on
[1:31:08] me that's that that's a great fear for a
[1:31:11] minister you know because Satan likes to
[1:31:13] throw things and and throw things at you
[1:31:16] and and make you think that you can't go
[1:31:18] into this call you can't go into this
[1:31:20] position God wants to place you God
[1:31:22] wants to bless you he wants to do more
[1:31:25] in your life but you got to you got to
[1:31:27] be courageous you got to be willing to
[1:31:30] step out and to and and say Lord give me
[1:31:33] the ability to to handle the pressure so
[1:31:36] that so that I can do your will and and
[1:31:39] and then when when when you can get
[1:31:41] yourself so out of the way it it can be
[1:31:44] like I was you know I mentioned the
[1:31:45] pastor Simon sometimes said pastor Simon
[1:31:48] sometimes you know you get up on the
[1:31:50] stage there and it's like you're in a
[1:31:52] candy store and you're looking
[1:31:53] everywhere and you can pull scripture
[1:31:54] here pull this there inspiration coming
[1:31:56] from here inspiration coming from there
[1:31:58] it's glorious but that's not something
[1:32:01] that we are in control of all we got to
[1:32:04] do is believe that God will do it for
[1:32:06] his people because this is not about me
[1:32:09] this is not about you this is about the
[1:32:12] body of Christ coming into its position
[1:32:15] so that we can fulfill the purpose that
[1:32:17] God has placed in our lives amen
[1:32:21] hallelujah
[1:32:22] so the new looks like a bit of a threat
[1:32:24] you get nervous and and you know it's
[1:32:27] going to it's going to change things
[1:32:29] around you people are going to get
[1:32:30] nervous around you people are going to
[1:32:32] feel a little bit uncomfortable about
[1:32:34] your position about your your your your
[1:32:36] your call of of you know taking this
[1:32:39] word and allowing God to do absolutely
[1:32:41] everything brand new in your life this
[1:32:44] year those old those old Spirits those
[1:32:47] old friends are going to come hey let's
[1:32:48] go for a drink come on man it's Friday
[1:32:50] night
[1:32:53] those things are still going to try and
[1:32:54] call you out but you got to be
[1:32:57] courageous and you got to be strong and
[1:32:59] you got to you got to let God be your
[1:33:01] strength at those times it's when you're
[1:33:04] at your weakest Point that's where God
[1:33:06] can become the strongest in your life
[1:33:08] amen amen praise God forever more
[1:33:12] listen understand that change has always
[1:33:16] been
[1:33:19] rejected
[1:33:20] always
[1:33:22] change nobody likes change some people
[1:33:27] do if you're like me you got add a
[1:33:30] little bit you like change you don't
[1:33:33] mind things happening last minute oh
[1:33:35] this is
[1:33:36] exciting H
[1:33:38] Allelujah this is different I'm good
[1:33:41] with that I'm a little I'll watch but I
[1:33:45] know that he'll give me direction he'll
[1:33:47] give me wisdom he'll give me discernment
[1:33:49] in the situation because we trust in him
[1:33:53] amen we believe in him but change has
[1:33:57] always been the big thing that causes
[1:34:00] disturbance you know that change causes
[1:34:02] War
[1:34:04] yeah why do you think World War One
[1:34:08] World War II World War
[1:34:11] Genesis World War Exodus World
[1:34:15] War Ezekiel all kinds of
[1:34:19] Wars because every time God wants to do
[1:34:22] something new there's a stirring in the
[1:34:25] camp look Jesus the word made flesh came
[1:34:31] to Earth he was brand
[1:34:35] new nobody understood who he was the
[1:34:38] Pharisees they were so caught up in
[1:34:40] their Traditions their their barns were
[1:34:43] completely
[1:34:45] full with all kinds of tradition to the
[1:34:48] point where they couldn't even recognize
[1:34:51] the word being made flesh right there
[1:34:54] when when the Virgin Mary was was was
[1:34:57] with child and the scriptures said a
[1:35:00] virgin shall conceive so many hundred
[1:35:02] years earlier and there she was
[1:35:04] manifested right in front of them they
[1:35:06] called her an illegitimate
[1:35:10] woman they couldn't recognize it was God
[1:35:14] doing something
[1:35:15] new but not new in that it was not
[1:35:20] spoken
[1:35:22] just like he's got something new for you
[1:35:25] that he planned from before the
[1:35:27] foundations of the
[1:35:29] world this is not just for
[1:35:31] today this is not for
[1:35:34] yesterday this is prophecy being
[1:35:36] fulfilled in your life because you're
[1:35:39] the new in this hour amen praise God
[1:35:42] Jesus came they couldn't take it they
[1:35:46] felt threatened what did they say oh you
[1:35:49] are uh you be elab
[1:35:52] he says why do you condemn
[1:35:55] me you condemn me for for for for doing
[1:35:59] uh good works you you you you condemn me
[1:36:01] for Healing The Sick for raising the
[1:36:03] dead oh no no no we don't condemn you
[1:36:05] for that we condemn you for saying that
[1:36:08] you are the word made
[1:36:11] flesh hallelujah oh we're going to this
[1:36:15] this doesn't end this week by the way
[1:36:17] I'm only halfway through my
[1:36:19] notes this is just going to get better I
[1:36:21] believe it's just going to get better
[1:36:23] praise
[1:36:24] God they couldn't take the word made
[1:36:28] flesh they couldn't recognize that that
[1:36:31] that Jesus of the Old Testament was
[1:36:34] Jehovah of the Old Testament was Jesus
[1:36:36] of the New Testament the Messiah that
[1:36:39] had come to to take away the sin the
[1:36:42] unbelief they wanted no they just wanted
[1:36:45] to take a goat slit its throat and allow
[1:36:48] the blood to cover them and that would
[1:36:50] be enough and they could go back out
[1:36:52] next Friday night and sin
[1:36:55] again but he says I come to take away
[1:36:59] the sin like it never happened in the
[1:37:02] first place Hallelujah why because he's
[1:37:05] got a people that he's got to bring back
[1:37:07] to Eternity they got to go back to
[1:37:09] Eternity because they came from eternity
[1:37:12] they are attributes of God they are
[1:37:15] cleansed they are clean they cannot sin
[1:37:18] he's come back for those seed that elect
[1:37:21] attribute of God he's bringing back
[1:37:23] those that are not caught into
[1:37:27] sin but are
[1:37:30] trapped in a human
[1:37:35] body they couldn't take Jesus they
[1:37:38] wanted to just keep killing the
[1:37:41] goats they just wanted to just keep with
[1:37:43] their Traditions they couldn't see the
[1:37:46] word made flesh in front of them
[1:37:52] so I came across this on the
[1:37:57] internet you know as I'm studying and
[1:37:59] I'm looking at things and some things
[1:38:00] they they catch my attention and I oh
[1:38:03] interesting so this one individual I
[1:38:05] forget his name right
[1:38:08] now I forget his name right now but
[1:38:13] anyway he wrote
[1:38:16] this and it's on cognitive dissonance I
[1:38:20] want you to listen care carefully
[1:38:23] here sometimes people hold a core belief
[1:38:27] that is very
[1:38:30] strong when they are presented with
[1:38:32] evidence that works against that core
[1:38:35] belief the new evidence cannot be
[1:38:39] accepted did you hear what I
[1:38:42] said okay they're holding on to a
[1:38:44] certain belief system and this is most
[1:38:47] people okay they hold on to this belief
[1:38:50] system system and they just can't they
[1:38:55] can't let it go even when evidence is
[1:38:58] produced to them it works against that
[1:39:00] core belief and the new evidence cannot
[1:39:03] be accepted at
[1:39:06] first it creates a feeling that is
[1:39:09] extremely
[1:39:11] uncomfortable and it is called cognitive
[1:39:15] dissonance you can look it up on the
[1:39:17] internet Look up the definition
[1:39:19] dissonance COG I nitive mental
[1:39:23] dissonance you know look it up and
[1:39:26] you'll see how it perfectly describes
[1:39:29] here and because it is so important to
[1:39:32] protect the core belief now this person
[1:39:36] because it is so important to them to
[1:39:38] protect this core belief people will
[1:39:41] rationalize ignore and even deny
[1:39:46] anything that does not fit in with that
[1:39:49] core belief yeah that's what the
[1:39:53] Pharisees were
[1:39:56] experiencing they were experiencing the
[1:39:58] modern
[1:39:59] [Music]
[1:40:00] day description of cognitive
[1:40:04] dissonance they were so caught into
[1:40:07] their own belief system their own
[1:40:09] writings their own Traditions their they
[1:40:13] were so so memorizing the word to the
[1:40:16] point where all they could see was the
[1:40:18] memory of every scripture they could
[1:40:20] point to any scripture in the Bible and
[1:40:22] they could repeat it but they were like
[1:40:25] robots and there's a lot of people that
[1:40:27] get caught into their traditions of of
[1:40:30] you know denominational thinking I was
[1:40:32] brought up Roman Catholic I'm a Roman
[1:40:34] Catholic till I die I'm going to let the
[1:40:36] priests come and give me the last rights
[1:40:38] where is that in the
[1:40:41] Bible Jesus has a right to you and only
[1:40:45] Jesus nobody else there is no other
[1:40:49] mediator between man and God God but
[1:40:51] Christ Jesus scripture I'll go with the
[1:40:55] word of God
[1:40:57] Amen he says even if it is the
[1:41:04] truth come on now a lot of people
[1:41:07] they'll sit there and man they'll
[1:41:09] go
[1:41:11] man that's the
[1:41:16] truth I never heard it that
[1:41:19] way you mean I
[1:41:21] mean that's what he
[1:41:24] meant in the word of
[1:41:27] God even if it is the truth even if it
[1:41:32] is what will set them
[1:41:35] free and liberate them from the
[1:41:38] condition that they're
[1:41:40] in not allowing to make space for that
[1:41:43] new thing that God wants to do in their
[1:41:45] lives which is to give them the
[1:41:47] revelation of this word and this message
[1:41:50] even if it's the absolute truth that
[1:41:53] sets you free Jesus said the truth shall
[1:41:55] set you free he says even if it will set
[1:41:59] them free from the chains of sin which
[1:42:02] is unbelief in God's word they will not
[1:42:05] accept
[1:42:07] it cognitive
[1:42:10] dissonance people experience it all the
[1:42:14] time when God shows them something in
[1:42:17] the word of God that's truth hallelujah
[1:42:20] in Romans go to the next slide Romans 1:
[1:42:25] 25-28 who changed the truth of God into
[1:42:28] a
[1:42:29] lie and worship the Ser the the the the
[1:42:33] served and worshiped and served the
[1:42:35] creature more than the
[1:42:37] Creator see people people get to a place
[1:42:40] where oh no no no no no my my church's
[1:42:43] tradition is greater than what you're
[1:42:47] telling me in the word of God they're
[1:42:49] saying in other words that that the
[1:42:51] creation is greater than the
[1:42:54] Creator they're saying no no I listen to
[1:42:57] my my my priest he tells me what I need
[1:42:59] to do if he tells me that I can go and I
[1:43:02] can go into the into the cupboard once
[1:43:04] every couple weeks and confess my sins
[1:43:07] about adultery and this and that I can
[1:43:09] go back out and do it
[1:43:10] again because it fits with them you see
[1:43:14] that's cognitive dissonance that's a
[1:43:17] mental condition listen here what it
[1:43:19] says who is blessed for forever amen the
[1:43:21] Creator for this cause God gave them up
[1:43:25] unto vile
[1:43:27] affections you see when you reject the
[1:43:30] truth look
[1:43:31] out you're going to allow anything now
[1:43:34] to come in and take control of your mind
[1:43:37] God gave them up to vile affections for
[1:43:40] even their women did change the natural
[1:43:42] use into that which is against nature if
[1:43:45] we've ever been in a time where the
[1:43:47] world is in absolute chaos when it comes
[1:43:50] to gender identity this is the time
[1:43:55] Saints what a you know depression
[1:43:58] amongst that particular group and
[1:44:01] suicide is running
[1:44:03] rampant because they don't know who they
[1:44:05] are God wants to tell them who they are
[1:44:08] God wants to give them their identity
[1:44:10] but they want to take on an alternate
[1:44:12] identity they want to be given over to
[1:44:15] and likewise also the men leaving the
[1:44:17] natural use of the woman burned in their
[1:44:20] lust one towards another men with men
[1:44:23] working that which is unseemingly and
[1:44:26] receiving in themselves that recompense
[1:44:29] of their error which was meat and even
[1:44:32] as they did not like to retain God in
[1:44:35] their knowledge they reject the word of
[1:44:37] God God gave them over to a reprobate
[1:44:40] mind to do things which are not
[1:44:44] convenient do you know what a reprobate
[1:44:46] mind is it's when you believe something
[1:44:49] to actually be the truth and it's
[1:44:52] actually a
[1:44:55] lie
[1:44:57] next as we wind down
[1:45:01] here this I say therefore in Ephesians
[1:45:03] chapter 4:17 to20 this I say therefore
[1:45:06] and testify in the Lord that ye
[1:45:08] henceforth walk not as other Gentiles
[1:45:12] walk in the vanity of their minds
[1:45:15] they're not allowing the spirit of God
[1:45:17] to you know people just won't sit long
[1:45:19] enough sometimes you just sit there I
[1:45:21] tell people I say listen you know what I
[1:45:23] know that what I said today may be a
[1:45:25] little bit hard for you to fully
[1:45:27] understand you talk to them about
[1:45:28] serpent seed about what the original sin
[1:45:30] was sometimes you know things like that
[1:45:33] the baptism and all that I said listen
[1:45:35] don't don't just believe and trust me
[1:45:37] I'm just a man but I said get down and
[1:45:41] and and spend some time you know pray
[1:45:44] and and and then read your your Bible
[1:45:46] and see if the spirit of God doesn't
[1:45:48] come and do something that opens your
[1:45:51] understanding and do something new in
[1:45:53] your
[1:45:54] life he says not as other Gentiles walk
[1:45:57] in the vanity of their minds having the
[1:46:00] understanding
[1:46:01] darkened being
[1:46:03] alienated from the life of God through
[1:46:07] the ignorance that is in them because of
[1:46:10] the blindness of their
[1:46:12] heart they just don't want to be sincere
[1:46:15] enough they just don't want to be
[1:46:17] sincere enough you you get them to a
[1:46:18] place they get too uncomfortable all of
[1:46:20] a sudden they'll start to joke they'll
[1:46:21] start to change they'll try to you know
[1:46:23] they'll say a dirty joke or something
[1:46:24] like that and and they'll try because
[1:46:26] because they can't handle truth it it
[1:46:29] gets them so uncomfortable but you know
[1:46:32] if if you want if you listen if you want
[1:46:34] God to do something new in your life
[1:46:36] this year you're going to need to get
[1:46:38] out of that uncomfortable you're you're
[1:46:40] going to have to break through you're
[1:46:42] going to have to take that pressure and
[1:46:43] you're going to need to sit still and
[1:46:45] sit long enough to allow the word of God
[1:46:47] to come in and make sense to you allow
[1:46:50] the spirit of God to open your
[1:46:52] understanding because you've been you
[1:46:54] you've been you you you're you're you're
[1:46:56] alienating yourself from the light
[1:46:57] people will say I'm an
[1:46:59] atheist I don't want to know God I say
[1:47:02] that's
[1:47:04] fine I don't believe that Danny you told
[1:47:06] me that testimony of that girl that was
[1:47:08] in your church went into the dentist
[1:47:10] office and had a cardiac arrest and they
[1:47:13] were they pronounced her dead brought
[1:47:14] her back she was in the hospital for so
[1:47:16] many days the mother uh said there's no
[1:47:19] way I'm praying I'm leing God and and
[1:47:21] God rose that woman up out of a coma
[1:47:24] where the doctor said that she would not
[1:47:26] make it she was clinically gone but she
[1:47:29] came back and she had a testimony
[1:47:32] Hallelujah and God does I don't believe
[1:47:35] that Danny well listen Jesus said all
[1:47:39] things are possible to them that believe
[1:47:41] he didn't say anything about to them
[1:47:43] that don't
[1:47:45] believe so I understand your position
[1:47:50] yes all good
[1:47:52] brother it's just the way it is see God
[1:47:55] opens the understanding God does the new
[1:47:59] thing in your
[1:48:00] life Hallelujah than you who being who
[1:48:05] being past feeling have given themselves
[1:48:08] over unto lacious that's living just any
[1:48:12] way they want and lust and all kinds of
[1:48:14] to work all uncleanness with greediness
[1:48:17] but ye have not so learned
[1:48:21] Christ you have not been taught in that
[1:48:25] way you have been given faith and
[1:48:26] Revelation to know what is something new
[1:48:30] and embrace it and allow God to change
[1:48:32] you and translate you into what he wants
[1:48:35] you to be amen if so be that ye have
[1:48:38] heard him and have been taught by him as
[1:48:41] the truth is in Jesus you see it always
[1:48:47] will bring you back to the word in the
[1:48:50] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:48:52] God the Word was God Amen let's go on to
[1:48:55] the next slide as we close therefore If
[1:49:00] any man be in Christ he is a new
[1:49:04] Creature if you've accepted this this
[1:49:07] work of God in your life that you you
[1:49:09] you say Lord do that new thing in my
[1:49:11] life I'm ready I'm I'm I I've made room
[1:49:13] for you I'm making room I'm gonna go
[1:49:16] home I'm gonna clean out the
[1:49:18] garage it's a type you see you're going
[1:49:21] to express that Revelation that's in you
[1:49:24] you can't help it you know when you when
[1:49:26] you organize your thinking it's it's a
[1:49:28] proven fact you know if you're if you're
[1:49:31] organized up here everything around you
[1:49:33] will just automatically get organized
[1:49:37] just the way it works before I start to
[1:49:40] move onto something new with the Lord
[1:49:42] whether it's a new message or or
[1:49:44] whatever it is that I that I ask my wife
[1:49:46] the first thing I got to do is clean
[1:49:48] house let's clean up
[1:49:50] vacuum under my desk clear all the
[1:49:53] papers organize everything throw out
[1:49:55] some of the old stuff because I got addd
[1:49:58] I can't help it I I get distracted I see
[1:50:01] this here I see that there I got to
[1:50:02] clean it I got to get rid of it I got to
[1:50:04] organize it and then now okay everything
[1:50:06] looking good everything's ready okay
[1:50:07] let's
[1:50:08] go it's just the way that I'm designed
[1:50:12] okay but but you see I I like that part
[1:50:15] because I don't like disorder I don't
[1:50:17] like things messy and clean
[1:50:20] I thank God for a wife that's got add
[1:50:25] OCD she loves to keep the house clean I
[1:50:27] love it and she enjoys it sure it's a
[1:50:31] little tough going up and down the
[1:50:32] stairs and this and that I'm going to
[1:50:34] get you an
[1:50:35] elevator but it's all about the grace of
[1:50:39] God and being in our position
[1:50:42] understanding how God has designed us
[1:50:44] and allowing the spirit of God to use us
[1:50:46] in those areas and in those ways praise
[1:50:49] God God so you become a brand new
[1:50:52] creature old things are passed away he
[1:50:55] says behold all things are become new
[1:50:59] how can All Things become new here's
[1:51:02] Paul back in the day you know in in in e
[1:51:05] in Ephesus and he's talking to the
[1:51:07] Corinthians and he's telling them all
[1:51:10] things become new it was all new back
[1:51:14] there why is it all new back there
[1:51:17] because it's all new here too it's all
[1:51:20] all about him it's all about his spirit
[1:51:23] it's all about him doing it it's all
[1:51:25] about him progressing this word and
[1:51:28] making this Prophecy of the Rapture come
[1:51:30] to pass we are going to be changed in a
[1:51:32] moment in the twinkling of an eye that
[1:51:35] day is approaching Saints it's a lot
[1:51:37] closer now than it's ever been amen
[1:51:39] praise God but he's got to do something
[1:51:41] new in your life you got to allow that
[1:51:43] new to come in amen because the new is
[1:51:45] him the new is Christ the new is him in
[1:51:48] you changing you translating you moving
[1:51:51] you uh delivering you from all the
[1:51:54] things and he says and all things are of
[1:51:58] God who hath reconciled us to himself by
[1:52:02] Jesus Christ and hath given to us the
[1:52:06] ministry of
[1:52:10] reconciliation
[1:52:12] you are a
[1:52:18] reconciliatory chist the church the
[1:52:22] bride the wife the
[1:52:25] helpmate you are Eve but not Eve in a
[1:52:29] fallen condition Eve
[1:52:31] restored the partner allowing the the
[1:52:35] the the spirit of God to have
[1:52:36] preeminence over your life now you are a
[1:52:39] part of that reconciliation the ministry
[1:52:42] that that he's what's he doing he said
[1:52:44] he's reconcilia the church to himself
[1:52:48] reconciling us back to him making us one
[1:52:51] with him but there's only one way that
[1:52:53] that can happen that cannot happen any
[1:52:56] other way it has to be that you were you
[1:52:59] you were you were a son or a daughter of
[1:53:01] God before you came to this earth you
[1:53:03] were a child of God your name was
[1:53:05] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:53:07] before you came to this church it's not
[1:53:10] something that just happens today but
[1:53:12] it's something that awakens in you to
[1:53:14] bring you back out of your spiritual
[1:53:16] Amnesia to bring you back to who you
[1:53:19] actually were were God chose those from
[1:53:22] before the foundations of the world
[1:53:25] Listen he chose a Jacob and he rejected
[1:53:27] an Esau he said Jacob do I love Esau do
[1:53:30] I hate why because he knew the seed he
[1:53:34] knew where the seed originated it was
[1:53:36] not the seed of God which was which was
[1:53:39] Adam's seed back in the Garden of Eden
[1:53:42] but the serpent got in there and
[1:53:44] beguiled Eve and placed his own seed in
[1:53:47] there and out of there came forth many
[1:53:50] different
[1:53:51] seed one seed unto the
[1:53:54] Lord Abel and one seed unto the serpent
[1:53:58] Cain why did why why did Cain kill why
[1:54:01] did he murder his brother what was it
[1:54:04] that was in him is because he was not
[1:54:07] the seed of
[1:54:08] God and we need to understand that not
[1:54:11] everybody in the world is the seed of
[1:54:14] God I'm not telling you that because
[1:54:16] that's what we believe that's in the
[1:54:18] scripture amen it Jesus himself said
[1:54:21] there's the children of obedience the
[1:54:25] children of Disobedience you were of
[1:54:27] your father he told the he told the the
[1:54:29] the the priest right there what he was
[1:54:31] on Earth in in St John chapter 6 he says
[1:54:33] you are of your father the devil he was
[1:54:36] a liar from the beginning who was the
[1:54:38] first liar in the beginning Cain where's
[1:54:42] your brother I don't know I just killed
[1:54:44] him back there but I don't
[1:54:46] know who was the first liar you see
[1:54:49] serpent seed God's seed so listen to
[1:54:54] brother brandham here he says in the in
[1:54:55] the saman age let the musicians come now
[1:54:58] then here here we are coming to a
[1:55:01] conclusion and so am
[1:55:03] I as the Eternal logos God was manifest
[1:55:07] in the Sun and Jesus dwelt in the
[1:55:10] fullness of the godhead
[1:55:13] bodily right
[1:55:14] Jesus was in the godhead
[1:55:18] bodily and that Eternal one was the
[1:55:22] father manifested in flesh okay Jesus
[1:55:27] was the father
[1:55:29] manifested in flesh called it the son
[1:55:33] gave it the name
[1:55:35] Jesus and went to Calvary to be that
[1:55:39] human sacrifice because it required a
[1:55:42] man's sins a man must die that's why
[1:55:44] Jesus Took man's place and that's why
[1:55:47] anybody that accepts Christ at the cross
[1:55:51] their sins can be forgiven them
[1:55:55] anybody and so the father was manifest
[1:55:58] In the Flesh and thereby gained the
[1:56:00] title of son even so
[1:56:04] we Eternal in his
[1:56:07] thoughts in turn became the many
[1:56:11] membered spoken word seed manifested in
[1:56:16] flesh and those Eternal thoughts now
[1:56:19] manifest in flesh are the sons and
[1:56:23] daughters of
[1:56:25] God even as we are socalled we did not
[1:56:31] become seed by rebirth listen carefully
[1:56:35] here so you're born ex you know like
[1:56:38] when somebody comes to the altar says oh
[1:56:39] I accepted Christ into my heart and they
[1:56:41] come to the altar that doesn't mean that
[1:56:44] they've been born again that means
[1:56:46] they've made a confession that's a good
[1:56:48] start
[1:56:50] that's that's where it starts but it and
[1:56:52] and it could lead like me I came to the
[1:56:54] altar I remember I come to the al pastor
[1:56:55] Simon I want the Holy Ghost I want the
[1:56:59] Holy Ghost see people will come because
[1:57:01] they want that change they want to
[1:57:02] repent but that doesn't mean that
[1:57:04] there's an elected seed of God in there
[1:57:07] that's going to go all the way that's
[1:57:10] going to end up being a manifested word
[1:57:12] of God in human flesh cuz that's what we
[1:57:15] become we become the interpretation of
[1:57:17] God in this age what we accept the word
[1:57:20] of God for this age amen and so we did
[1:57:25] not become seed by rebirth we were seed
[1:57:28] we were seed and therefore were reborn
[1:57:32] for only the elect can be reborn only
[1:57:36] Sons and Daughters of God Eternal
[1:57:39] thoughts of God can
[1:57:41] actually really have like the ultimate
[1:57:44] new
[1:57:45] beginning and fresh
[1:57:47] start to receive the word of God God and
[1:57:50] to be changed because we were seed is
[1:57:54] the reason we could be quickened in
[1:57:57] nonseed there is nothing to Quicken and
[1:58:00] that's why sometimes you'll talk until
[1:58:02] you're black and blue and the person
[1:58:05] will just deny the word of God and
[1:58:06] they'll just go on just let them go on
[1:58:09] it may not be their time and season yet
[1:58:11] because to everything God has a time and
[1:58:12] season or it may be that that's just who
[1:58:15] they
[1:58:15] are that's not up to you and me we don't
[1:58:19] take responsibility for
[1:58:21] that glory to God Amen we need to
[1:58:24] understand that so here he says Jacob he
[1:58:27] says look Esau was twice the guy this is

[1:58:42] and everything else and Jacob was a
[1:58:43] little Shyer hung around his mother's
