[0:00] in Africa so that you learn real
[0:03] discipline. You have a deacon there,
[0:05] have a beacon there, have another one
[0:07] there, another one there. And if it's a
[0:08] big combination, have another one covers
[0:10] the middle part. And each one has a
[0:13] special long
[0:17] rod. And somebody with behavior, you
[0:21] [Music]
[0:23] just or they preach for hours on and you
[0:27] start falling asleep. man or woman.
[0:33] Praise the Lord.
[0:35] Bring you back to your senses. Praise
[0:37] God. But they they give you literal
[0:40] discipline in that kind of form. But I'm
[0:43] saying you got to have some spiritual
[0:45] discipline. You got to have parameters
[0:48] to anything that you're doing. And if
[0:51] you go too far, you need to expect that
[0:53] somebody is going to correct you or
[0:56] whisper in your ear or tell you
[0:58] something. And you can't start to huff
[1:00] on a puff like a, you know, blow the
[1:03] house down or, you know, puff up this
[1:05] little toad, you know, all smoke like
[1:08] that and ready to bust out as you call
[1:11] it, you know. No. Praise God.
[1:16] Need I don't want you to go to the
[1:17] opposite way either.
[1:20] where you all the thing on your sword
[1:23] and you just wait till you can get out
[1:25] of air shot when none of the believers
[1:28] can hear you and then you go up who they
[1:30] think they are but whatever else who I
[1:33] just come there they should be glad I
[1:35] come to that
[1:37] church you come to the church think
[1:40] about it praise the Lord you are honored
[1:42] to come in the presence of the Lord any
[1:45] church that's really dedicated to the
[1:47] glory of God amen praise Praise the
[1:49] Lord. You're just so full of yourself
[1:51] that you think that way. Praise God. Are
[1:53] you listening to me now? Amen. Praise
[1:55] the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to
[1:58] God. Now listen to God's prophecy. He
[2:00] says, "Now when you enter this
[2:05] sanctuary, you are to keep
[2:08] still one to
[2:11] another and worship God. For if you want
[2:15] to visit each other, there is places
[2:18] that you can visit each other with, but
[2:22] never in here walking around where the
[2:26] rest of the people can't hear themselves
[2:30] think. Is that right? You know what I'm
[2:33] talking about. It's all right to wear
[2:35] all kinds of shoes, but it's not good
[2:38] when you're making sure that we know
[2:40] you're coming.
[2:44] I know God says we are a Christian army,
[2:46] but you don't have to
[2:51] stop. You don't have to stop for us to
[2:54] know your God. Praise the Lord. Matter
[2:57] of fact, let all the earth keep silent
[2:59] before
[3:00] you. Tiptoe softly in the presence of
[3:03] God. You're going out tiptoe softly.
[3:06] You're showing reverence for God.
[3:09] It's not because I'm the man standing
[3:11] here and you have some resentment
[3:12] against me. I can show him that, you
[3:14] know, I can walk out to I come in when I
[3:17] want to dare him to say anything. You're
[3:19] not daring me. You know, if you're in
[3:23] God's house, praise the Lord. And we
[3:26] here to give God praise, honor, and
[3:28] glory. Praise God. Hallelujah. We should
[3:31] not make such noise and things.
[3:34] I've seen in churches until it has made
[3:37] me feel real bad
[3:40] because people do not come into the
[3:43] sanctuary of the Lord to meet each
[3:45] other. When we come, we come to worship
[3:48] God. Amen. Amen. You want to visit, go
[3:52] to your homes or somewhere else. This
[3:55] sanctuary is dedicated to worship. You
[3:58] want to fellowship, stand
[4:02] outside, talk anything you want to as
[4:06] long as it's right things and holy
[4:09] things. And you can go to one another's
[4:12] homes or go visit some other places
[4:15] round about. But when you enter this
[4:18] door, we are to come in here and be
[4:22] quiet in the presence of the Lord. Amen.
[4:25] Is that right? Praise the Lord.
[4:27] Hallelujah. Praise God. Now that God, he
[4:30] didn't have a 4A, but we have a 4A. And
[4:33] the foyer was built particularly and
[4:35] deliberately for that to avoid people
[4:38] talking and fellowshipping inside here
[4:40] and that you would go out in the foyer
[4:44] after the services ended and there you
[4:46] can talk and you can
[4:48] fellowship. Now if other people want uh
[4:51] that are impressed and touched by the
[4:53] Holy Spirit want to stay within the
[4:56] house of God and in these pews or come
[4:59] to the uh platform kneel here as if it
[5:02] was an altar in the presence of God,
[5:05] they should have that right to be silent
[5:08] and meditating. Uh if you want to spend
[5:11] five minutes, 10 minutes before they get
[5:13] up and go out, they have to have that
[5:15] right. While the music is still being
[5:18] played softly, your the bands are still
[5:21] playing softly. They ought to have that
[5:23] right. Right. And you can go out in the
[5:26] party, talk and fellowship out there. I
[5:28] said talk and fellowship. I didn't say
[5:30] shout and yell. I said talk, fellowship,
[5:32] not shout and yell. Praise God. The
[5:35] deacons know and the trustees know to
[5:39] close this the inner door.
[5:42] Praise the Lord. Just to dampen whatever
[5:45] sound is coming from that may be
[5:48] outside. Praise God. And that the people
[5:51] can have that. Now we are transforming
[5:54] even how we our attitude. My topic
[5:58] actually today is how to behave in the
[6:00] house of God.
[6:01] how to behave in the house of God.
[6:05] Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. Now go there
[6:10] and
[6:11] listen and win. He says the trouble is
[6:15] we do too much talking and don't listen
[6:19] enough in the presence of God. When we
[6:22] are when we come in here, we are to wait
[6:25] upon him. Amen. Praise the Lord. Come
[6:29] in. No wonder we had a revival going on
[6:32] up there on the mountain when the church
[6:34] was on Bruce Dale until it became so
[6:38] jam-packed. Over 450 people pack people
[6:42] down in the basement, cars up and down
[6:45] the street until the neighbors begin to
[6:46] complain. And after a while, we couldn't
[6:48] sustain it because we couldn't expand.
[6:51] We couldn't buy any of the property. And
[6:53] so we we were kind of in a situation
[6:55] where we were forced that we we had to
[6:57] move. And uh just about that time is
[7:00] when uh we had a little uh church split
[7:03] and some people went off and some
[7:05] remain. And this nucleus is here and
[7:08] we're trying to grow ourselves just back
[7:11] to what God did in our lives. But there
[7:14] were prayer things going on. The Holy
[7:17] Spirit was moving in a wonderful way.
[7:20] They take a picture and at that time
[7:22] they were called the eagles cry.
[7:24] uh to to the photographers a surprise.
[7:27] There was a eagle sitting in a nest
[7:29] right into the sign. Some I believe some
[7:32] believers even have it today
[7:34] supernaturally. Not somebody
[7:35] photoshopper or painting something. It
[7:37] was right there and and and things like
[7:39] that were happening. People have come
[7:41] against the message were dropping dead.
[7:44] People were being healed. People were
[7:46] coming with wheelchairs and rising up
[7:48] out of it and walking in the name of
[7:50] Jesus Christ. Amen. Miracles were taking
[7:53] place. The hand of God was moving in a
[7:56] wonderful precious way. And that was the
[7:59] order that we used to keep just like
[8:03] what he said here.
[8:05] The presence of God reverence. Come on
[8:08] in the sanctuary.
[8:11] True. People tiptoe in. And they were
[8:13] tiptoeing in not only because I preach a
[8:17] message like this because of what they
[8:20] were seeing happening.
[8:22] I didn't have to tell them there's
[8:24] something is what some of them used to
[8:26] say. Something is in that building.
[8:29] Something is in that place. But we know
[8:31] it's somebody. Amen. But brother Ben
[8:34] said, when you start going to a certain
[8:36] place, whether in your closet or whether
[8:38] in church, and you
[8:41] uh decide you're going to meet him at a
[8:43] certain
[8:44] time every day or whenever you want to
[8:47] worship, he said he'll come there and be
[8:51] there before you even get there waiting
[8:54] on him.
[8:55] So the Lord will be in here. Praise the
[8:58] Lord. And when people become conscious
[9:00] of God and just think, But it's not an
[9:03] office building. It's another building.
[9:04] You just barge uh like that. Not
[9:07] recognizing that you are coming not only
[9:09] into a building, but you're coming in
[9:12] here in an atmosphere so you can get
[9:15] your yourself into the spirit and
[9:19] presence of the Lord. Amen.
[9:22] Praise God. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[9:26] Now for you to do
[9:28] that, let
[9:30] there let uh brother Olrich would come
[9:34] in and he would play the song. Now back
[9:40] then they didn't have all the stuff we
[9:42] have now. Now we we can have the
[9:45] brothers long before the service start
[9:48] before have prepared worship music
[9:52] that's soft and low.
[9:55] Worshipful, plain in the
[9:57] background so that when you step into
[10:00] the doors, the atmosphere is already
[10:03] there and you can enter into it and add
[10:06] your prayer, your thought or the prophet
[10:10] said open your Bible quietly. Not just
[10:13] open your
[10:16] Bible in that kind of an atmosphere, you
[10:18] want to be as reverent as possible.
[10:23] you don't feel like praying or you
[10:24] prayed enough, then you can quietly
[10:26] begin reading your
[10:30] Bible. Soft music. The ushers are to
[10:34] stand at the
[10:36] door and see that nobody come in here
[10:41] and
[10:44] talks or you have done your talking
[10:48] outside and then you come in.
[10:52] [Music]
[10:54] If you desire
[10:56] to
[10:57] silently, you can come to the front and
[11:01] pray
[11:02] silently. When you're finished, you walk
[11:05] back to your seat. You may want to open
[11:08] your
[11:10] Bible. What your neighbor does, what
[11:13] they do is up to them. You have nothing
[11:16] to say to them and nothing to do. You
[11:19] want to talk to him.
[11:22] You say in your heart, I'll see him or
[11:25] her outside, but right now I'm in here
[11:30] to worship God. Amen. Is that right? In
[11:33] other words, he's saying don't let the
[11:34] devil distract you cuz he'll
[11:36] deliberately make somebody else
[11:38] unintentionally. The person doesn't mean
[11:40] anything, but they'll do this or they'll
[11:41] do that. You know, when you want to come
[11:43] to church, from the time it comes Sunday
[11:46] or whatever to come to church, the devil
[11:47] is going to start putting distractions.
[11:50] your brand new car that's supposed to
[11:52] work 100% with your eyes closed. You
[11:56] just how come this thing is not
[11:59] working right? Or you do something that
[12:02] cost something else. You're never parked
[12:04] in front of your garage or parked in
[12:06] front of your driveway and can't get up
[12:08] to get you stirred up so you may come in
[12:10] the house of God all fired up the wrong
[12:13] way.
[12:16] The devil has all kinds of tricks,
[12:18] right? And you got to do what? And then
[12:20] he'll follow you all the way. If you do
[12:23] make it and you get in the house of God
[12:26] after you pass through the the valley of
[12:29] worry and the valley of worry valley of
[12:32] sleeping or everything else and you're
[12:34] still in the house of God, then he
[12:37] doesn't stop.
[12:41] That monkey sits on your shoulder trying
[12:43] to whisper in your ear. And then you you
[12:46] know your neighbors are there going
[12:48] about their business simply and then
[12:50] he's going to come say you know she
[12:52] turned that Bible too loud you know you
[12:54] should really stop turning that Bible
[12:55] too loud and and if you bother with them
[12:59] you going to be irritated and think it's
[13:02] the person that you should be irritated
[13:04] with. It's not difficult with the
[13:06] person that's trying to work on you.
[13:09] Right? So then we have to watch all this
[13:11] and just give you a few minutes. But
[13:13] that's exactly what the devil does. So
[13:15] they're to stand at the door, see nobody
[13:17] talk. If you want to talk to him, say in
[13:20] your heart, I'll see him or her outside,
[13:22] but I'm in here to worship God and read
[13:26] his word or sit here silently. And then
[13:30] with the music of Major Alrich or Sister
[13:34] Gertie, Sister Gertie with the old
[13:36] piano, she would come in and play softly
[13:40] in the
[13:42] background at the cross
[13:47] where some
[13:50] sweet soft
[13:53] music is to be
[13:55] played
[13:57] until the time for other service. And
[14:01] then
[14:03] reverently the song leader gets
[14:06] on and begins to lead congregational
[14:11] songs. And then in the midst of that, if
[14:15] someone has an outstanding soul, they
[14:19] will come and sing
[14:21] it. And then the music will continually
[14:26] play. And then I would hear that and
[14:30] know that it was my time to come out. In
[14:32] other words, some kind of a system need
[14:35] to be set up so that when the pastor is
[14:37] in the back there either by these days
[14:40] they have a monitor they can put on a
[14:42] monitor. I don't have one there back yet
[14:44] but they're working on it to put it on.
[14:47] So I know
[14:49] exactly when I have to come out or we
[14:51] have a visiting speaker. They know when
[14:53] they have to come out because it will be
[14:55] right there. They'll have some kind of a
[14:57] means by which they could know. Amen.
[15:00] Praise the Lord. And then the minister
[15:03] walks into the
[15:04] congregation in the middle of a people
[15:07] that was praying and worshiping God
[15:09] under the anointing of the spirit. I
[15:12] tell you, when you do like that, you are
[15:14] bound to hear from heaven.
[15:17] Praise God. Hallelujah. There is no way
[15:20] to keep from it. But if the minister
[15:24] walks into a bunch of confusion, when
[15:28] you are confused, the congregation
[15:30] confused, then the spirit of God is
[15:32] grieved.
[15:34] Hallelujah. We do not want to do that.
[15:37] We want to come here to worship. We have
[15:39] our own lovely homes. You can go there,
[15:42] visit with your friends, go somewhere
[15:44] else. But this is God's house.
[15:48] And there's little children now. Now,
[15:51] little babies, I mean, that they cry out
[15:54] in the
[15:55] services. Sometimes it's a drink of
[15:58] water and sometimes they need
[16:01] attention. They don't know no different.
[16:04] That's the way babies do. That's the way
[16:07] they get the attention that they need
[16:09] something. So, if we by the grace of God
[16:12] now know enough and we have dedicated a
[16:15] room and we call it a cry room, we call
[16:18] it nursery. But it's right straight
[16:21] there. And mothers can take their babies
[16:25] there. Praise God. If they begin to cry.
[16:30] We also have the foyer. Some mothers
[16:32] want to be in the washroom too. So
[16:34] instead of going down necessarily into
[16:36] the um nursery, they'll go out in the
[16:40] foyer in there where we have to monitor
[16:42] out there and everything that's in there
[16:45] is shown up there and they can uh you
[16:48] know feed their baby or get the baby
[16:51] quietened out there by the grace of God.
[16:54] Now uh I know you may be getting
[16:56] restless a little bit now but let me
[16:58] know let you know this is necessary.
[17:01] I don't have too much more to say, but
[17:03] uh this is necessary. You need to hear
[17:05] this. Praise the Lord. Glory to God.
[17:08] Hallelujah. So uh so then um you mothers
[17:13] if
[17:15] your baby starts
[17:18] whimpering, remember there's other
[17:20] people there and it bothers them because
[17:23] they come here to hear the service,
[17:26] right? So mothers, if your baby really
[17:29] start whimpering, I don't think he's
[17:31] talking about the baby just little baby
[17:34] sound, but he's talking about the baby
[17:36] start wailing and crying and keeping a
[17:38] whole lot of noise. And then you see,
[17:42] you've got the room, you can take them
[17:45] there for every real mother wants to
[17:47] take her baby to church, right? So, in
[17:51] that room, we have a speaker that has a
[17:55] control where we can turn the volume up
[17:58] or down. There's a toilet there, water
[18:02] basin, everything for the mother's
[18:04] convenience, chairs for you to sit, a
[18:07] place to change, change room, your baby,
[18:10] and everything. It's sitting there. It's
[18:12] all fixed. Let's use it for the glory of
[18:14] God. Amen. Amen. Amen. and mothers when
[18:18] we use it. Let's not leave it in a
[18:21] mess. But let's clean up after our
[18:24] babies, clean up after our children,
[18:26] clean up after ourselves.
[18:29] Praise God. Hallelujah. And then
[18:32] sometimes we have teenage children and
[18:35] sometimes adults that want to pass
[18:38] around notes to one another in the
[18:42] congregation or begin to joke, laugh,
[18:47] cut up in the sanctuary. Now come on. He
[18:52] says you're old enough to know better
[18:54] than that.
[18:57] You young people, if you expect to be a
[19:00] real man someday and raise a proper
[19:03] family for the kingdom of God, then you
[19:06] you young woman expect to be a mother,
[19:10] raise a family, then start off doing it
[19:14] right right now in the beginning. If you
[19:17] see it act right, do right. It'll turn
[19:20] out right. Can you say praise God? Don't
[19:23] wait then when you start right now.
[19:26] Hallelujah. Amen. For I have seen
[19:28] churches where children were permitted
[19:31] to run all over the
[19:34] sanctuary. And the adults stand at one
[19:37] corner of the sanctuary and shouting to
[19:40] the children at the other end of the
[19:43] sanctuary calling out, hollering. He
[19:46] didn't say yes. He said hollering across
[19:49] the room to one another. That's a good
[19:52] way to ruin the service. that's coming
[19:56] even on the other
[19:58] night. Amen. Praise the Lord. Not even
[20:02] at the end of this service, we're going
[20:04] out and if people start shouting to one
[20:07] another, he said that's a good way to
[20:08] ruin the service or even the next
[20:11] service that's coming up because it's
[20:14] too much of a strain. Amen. So go out.
[20:18] Hallelujah.
[20:20] Now then, if you do right, the gifts
[20:24] will begin to fall down among you.
[20:29] The gifts will begin to start to
[20:31] reappear. You believe that? Amen.
[20:36] Praise the Lord. I trust this is the way
[20:39] it ought to be. When people have a new
[20:41] church, they begin to get too starchy.
[20:45] See, this is a place to come worship.
[20:49] and spiritual gifts will begin to come
[20:51] among you. And so when they come amongst
[20:56] you,
[20:57] then Satan will come in and try to take
[21:01] away some shows some kind of a
[21:05] flaw, bringing some kind of a fraud.
[21:08] Like I said, he's come with his tricks
[21:10] because he realized God's getting ready
[21:12] to move. So when God gets ready to move,
[21:14] he's right there to to see if he can
[21:17] obstruct or or subvert or do this or
[21:21] whatever. Hallelujah. But now when these
[21:25] gifts begin to appear, we begin to
[21:27] worship God. Then we must dedicate
[21:30] ourselves that from
[21:31] here must go out the word of the living
[21:34] God around the world and around the
[21:37] globe. Do you believe that? Praise the
[21:40] Lord. Hallelujah. We always say we're
[21:42] going to take the word to the world. Now
[21:44] we have a place to dwell in a roof on
[21:46] over our head, a clean nice church to
[21:48] sit in, but let us dedicate ourselves
[21:51] newly to the task and consecrate
[21:54] ourselves to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[21:56] Praise the Lord. Very important that we
[21:59] do that. I'm winding this up now. Just I
[22:01] know it's now 1:00 on the dot. I just
[22:04] need about 5 minutes more and wind this
[22:06] up. He says, "Now in this church, we are
[22:08] blessed with brother Neville, a real
[22:11] pastor, a real pastor, a wonderful man
[22:14] of God." Amen. He knows the message and
[22:18] he holds with it all he's got. He's
[22:21] gentle. I would say, brother Brad, he's
[22:24] even sometimes a little afraid to speak
[22:27] to the people.
[22:30] Oh brothers, I don't mean that but I all
[22:32] I mean is that he's you know brother
[22:34] talk. I just means that he is gentle. He
[22:37] doesn't speak up and speak out you know
[22:40] to say them sharp cutting things like
[22:43] sit down or keep still. I've noticed
[22:46] that and even listens. But it so happens
[22:50] that God made me so I can do it. Praise
[22:53] the Lord. And I want you to remember
[22:56] that these are just not my words. You
[23:00] listening
[23:02] right? This is all being taped.
[23:05] Everything is being taped. And let every
[23:07] deacon stand to their posture duty.
[23:10] Remember, you are here under a
[23:13] commission directly from God to hold
[23:16] your post and position sacred. Every
[23:20] trustee just the same. Amen. Amen. the
[23:24] pastor. It isn't the pastor's place or
[23:28] the deacon's place uh the pastor's place
[23:32] to do these things and to get there to
[23:36] even say that. See, the deacons, they
[23:40] are the ones that are the policemen of
[23:43] the church. Can somebody say amen?
[23:46] Praise God. I think we have time to put
[23:48] in to our budget um to get some
[23:51] handcuffs.
[23:54] Is that
[23:55] right? Praise the Lord. Don't take me
[23:58] literal now. We use the Holy Ghost to
[24:01] handcuff you with handcuffed by the Holy
[24:04] Ghost. In other words, you become a
[24:05] prisoner of Christ. We don't need to uh
[24:07] do anything. But here it is. He said,
[24:10] "Now you are on the commission to hold
[24:13] your ghost sacred. Now, young
[24:16] couples come outside and sometimes they
[24:21] blow their horns. Some things like that.
[24:24] A mother sends her daughter or her son
[24:27] out there, send them out there. And what
[24:30] happened? She goes out of the church, go
[24:33] out with some renegade kid and run out
[24:36] there sitting in a car while her father
[24:39] thinks she's in church. Like that. We've
[24:41] had uh of course we've had um people
[24:44] leave this church because I will not
[24:46] pull up the pack. Uh the the young kid
[24:50] uh leaves and have a couple of the girls
[24:53] in the
[24:54] church out in a nice car cuz they were
[24:58] well off and they could buy a real fancy
[25:00] car where a normal kid can't buy. and
[25:03] and and they're in there in the dark
[25:04] parking lot uh chatting away and um they
[25:10] expect myself or the demon to put up
[25:13] with that and and then start wagging
[25:16] their finger in my face and don't you
[25:19] don't tell my child don't speak I said
[25:21] well no that doesn't work like that here
[25:24] we're sorry that you're unhappy the way
[25:26] we operate here but there's a lot of
[25:28] places we want you to be happy and
[25:30] there's a lot of places that you may be
[25:32] happy under those kinds of conditions
[25:35] and you were free at any time to go to
[25:38] such uh you know to such a place but
[25:40] it's not going to happen here and so
[25:43] quietly you know they left and so it's
[25:46] the same thing right now um that kind of
[25:49] thing should not go on here whether it's
[25:51] in a car or anywhere else parents bring
[25:54] you here to worship you need to stay in
[25:56] the house of God and worship God and
[25:57] give him glory right here amen praise
[26:00] the name of the Lord hallelujah amen
[26:02] The deacons ought to see to that and
[26:05] tell them you either come in here, sit
[26:08] down, or I'm going to take you in my car
[26:10] and take you home to your mother or take
[26:12] you home to your parents right away.
[26:14] Praise the Lord. Remember, love is
[26:16] corrective. Genuine love is corrective.
[26:19] And you must stand that correction.
[26:22] Mothers, there's a place for you here.
[26:24] And if the deacon speaks to you, stand
[26:26] the correction. Young kids, no
[26:28] different. Young adults, same adults,
[26:32] you no different than to run around over
[26:34] the building, talk over the building,
[26:36] carry on conversations in the
[26:38] auditorium. Don't you do that. It's
[26:40] wrong. It's dis it isn't pleasing to
[26:43] God. For Jesus said, in closing, it is
[26:48] written, "My house shall be called a
[26:52] house of worship, of prayer, a house of
[26:55] prayer for all nations." what they were
[26:59] buying and they were
[27:01] selling and he platted
[27:05] ropes and ran them people out of the
[27:09] auditorium. We certainly don't want that
[27:11] to happen in this sanctuary.
[27:14] So let us dedicate our lives, our
[27:17] church, our tasks, our service and
[27:21] everything that we have to worship
[27:25] God and dedicate
[27:27] ourselves and dedicate this building to
[27:31] the glory of God. Will you agree with
[27:33] me? Amen. Let us change our approach,
[27:36] our attitude and let us bring the glory
[27:40] and presence of God down where God can
[27:44] come and meet with us and we can
[27:46] fellowship with him. Shall we stand as
[27:48] we look to the Lord in prayer? God bless
[27:49] these words. How we ought to behave in
[27:52] the house of God.
[28:03] Now, heavenly father, we thank you for
[28:06] the going forth of thy gracious law, thy
[28:11] word of truth. Father, in this this
[28:15] teaching moment, may the word of God
[28:18] sink deeply within our hearts as lives
[28:21] are being uh refreshed for th those who
[28:26] already knew this but kind of uh uh Lord
[28:30] God l on it. May the spirit refresh
[28:34] their action and to the heart. For those
[28:37] who are now being shaped and formed, may
[28:40] the spirit of God like the great master
[28:43] sculpture take the word of God and shape
[28:46] the lives and change the hearts, change
[28:48] the minds. And father, may we save it in
[28:52] ourselves from today, I'm going to act
[28:56] different. I'm going to be different.
[29:00] I'm going to treat the house of God
[29:03] differently. I'm going to make it a
[29:05] place of
[29:06] worship that's clean
[29:10] naturally, consecrated
[29:13] spiritually. For I now dedicate myself
[29:16] and my
[29:18] service onto the glory of God. Amen.
[29:23] Father, may each one pray a similar
[29:26] prayer within their hearts.
[29:29] that we will all enjoy the
[29:33] fruits which will be the power and glory
[29:37] of the spirit of almighty God working
[29:40] among
[29:41] us and creating this church as a
[29:44] lighthouse in this
[29:47] community. A place where the word of God
[29:50] can go out. Bless us each one today.
[29:53] Bless our families as we go on the road.
[29:55] Protect us. Take us safely to and fro.
[29:57] Father, and in all that we do take
[30:00] praise, honor, and glory in the name of
[30:02] our Lord Jesus Christ, the word of God.
[30:05] Amen. And amen. God bless you real good.
[30:09] I trust that you've taken this message
[30:12] seat,
[30:15] sincerely, and seriously into your
[30:19] hearts and that you will act upon it.
[30:23] Can I have your promise that you're
[30:25] going to act on the word of God? Amen.
[30:29] Let us keep this as a genuine center in
[30:32] the house of God. And we want to
[30:34] beautify it even more than this to keep
[30:38] it the way God wants us to keep it.
[30:41] Amen. The Lord bless you. We'd like to
[30:43] announce that next uh Sunday we are
[30:46] going to have a visiting preacher uh out
[30:48] of Connecticut coming to minister for
[30:51] us. Brother Elijah gift will be
[30:55] ministering next weekend Sunday only for
[30:59] the glory of God. Amen. No service on
[31:02] Saturday night. So don't turn up in the
[31:04] parking lot looking at the sign saying
[31:06] clothes for the season because uh nobody
[31:09] will be here. Uh just um come on Sunday
[31:13] morning, worship fully like we said into
[31:16] the house of God and let us raise up
[31:18] holy hands without wrath or doubt.
