[1:11] now our scripture is found
[1:14] in matthew chapter 12
[1:18] reading verses 38
[1:21] and 39 then
[1:26] certain of the scribes and of the
[1:29] pharisees
[1:31] answered saying master
[1:34] we would see a sign of thee and he
[1:37] answered and said unto them
[1:40] and evil and adulterous generation
[1:45] seek it after a sign
[1:49] and there shall be no sign given to it
[1:52] but the sign of the prophet jonah
[1:57] jonas praise god my emphasis will be on
[2:00] the fourth
[2:01] first part of it an evil
[2:05] and adulterous generation
[2:08] seek it after a sign
[2:13] o praise god let us pray

[2:32] spirit anoint our hearts together
[2:37] that we do not come together by
[2:39] tradition
[2:41] or churchianity but we come together
[2:45] led by the holy spirit drawn
[2:48] into his presence with the trill
[2:52] the excitement and the heartthrob of
[2:56] happiness that comes from the joy of
[3:00] knowing
[3:00] jesus christ in the fullness
[3:04] of his power and authority
[3:07] through the word of god bless us now we
[3:11] pray
[3:12] for we ask it in jesus name
[3:15] amen and amen praise god
[3:18] hallelujah amen
[3:21] well friends
[3:25] many books of course have been written
[3:28] and many perspectives given about
[3:32] america's place the united states of
[3:36] america
[3:37] her place in bible prophecy
[3:42] now my that is not my main
[3:45] topic tonight i'm just passing
[3:48] by that but you ought to know
[3:51] that the united states of america is
[3:53] identified in
[3:55] revelation 13. however
[3:59] uh prophets through the ages
[4:03] have preached sermons and spoke the word
[4:07] of god
[4:08] from different perspectives
[4:12] jeremiah was told to write
[4:16] what god said to him and put it in a
[4:19] book
[4:20] john was told to write part of it
[4:24] john right and another part god says
[4:27] don't write but the fact is they were
[4:30] directed
[4:31] by god and what they wrote and said was
[4:35] just saith the lord it came
[4:38] from the mouth and
[4:42] pen of god's prophet
[4:45] of that day and in our day
[4:49] the same holy spirit has spoken
[4:53] to our dear precious brother
[4:58] and said pick up your pen and write
[5:03] and here we see history repeating itself
[5:07] again because from the time of
[5:13] of israel in their history
[5:18] under what was happening on the king
[5:21] ahab is happening
[5:25] again it is now
[5:28] being repeated in the world's
[5:32] history and in particular
[5:35] in the history of america
[5:42] when that was happening it was during
[5:45] that
[5:45] time that the prophet elijah
[5:50] appeared on the scene
[5:53] with a message from almighty god
[5:57] hallelujah and here now in our modern
[6:00] times
[6:02] when the same prophetic type of
[6:06] scenery and atmosphere is here once
[6:09] again
[6:11] a prophet in the spirit of elijah
[6:15] true prophecy of malachi 4 chapter 5
[6:20] that would turn the hearts of the
[6:21] children to the fathers
[6:24] amen oh my praise god
[6:28] here we are god promised it
[6:31] and we believed it so
[6:36] and just as israel had left egypt
[6:40] to go into the wilderness and then the
[6:42] promised land
[6:44] even so has god's
[6:48] people had to leave they
[6:51] the task masters of denominationalism
[6:55] they had to leave this la that land
[6:59] where they labored and were enslaved
[7:04] there in prisons with stained glass
[7:06] windows
[7:08] and set free by the power of the word of
[7:11] the living god
[7:13] amen and when they were brought
[7:16] out and speaking of israel now
[7:21] they grew as a nation
[7:25] and leaders came forth you know after
[7:28] moses and joshua
[7:30] and then later on we had great leaders
[7:33] david you know coming forth
[7:36] in the leadership of the nation
[7:40] of israel but then
[7:44] israel made a fatal mistake
[7:49] they placed ahab
[7:52] on the throne
[7:55] and ahab brought with him
[7:58] his wife jezebel
[8:02] in actual fact jesse bell kept very
[8:06] quiet
[8:06] mute but she was actually
[8:11] the neck that was turning the head
[8:14] for he was the head of the nation but
[8:18] jezebel was behind him orchestrating
[8:21] manipulating
[8:23] moving scheming uh doing all manner of
[8:26] things
[8:27] to change the complexion
[8:30] and change the atmosphere
[8:34] and the worship in the
[8:37] and culture in that nation
[8:40] of israel
[8:44] i believe the same thing
[8:47] has been done in the united states of
[8:50] america
[8:51] it has already been done and is going on
[8:55] right now
[8:56] because we know the prophet of malachi 4
[8:59] 5
[9:00] who we believe is brother william marion
[9:02] branham
[9:03] that came the 20th century prophet
[9:06] in the time of uh john kennedy and
[9:10] jacqueline kennedy
[9:11] administered during that time and
[9:14] made his own applications
[9:18] on that particular situation
[9:22] now just the same as
[9:26] the early settlers in the united states
[9:29] left the old lands uh in europe
[9:34] to come to america to find
[9:38] freedom freedom of worship
[9:42] in particular where they could give
[9:45] glory
[9:46] and praise to god
[9:49] and there arose like in israel
[9:54] great men great generals
[9:57] men like washington
[10:01] abraham lincoln and
[10:04] then after that time
[10:08] they began to digress or digress
[10:11] from the word of god and the way of god
[10:14] the way of
[10:15] worshiping god and they
[10:18] received a poorer caliber
[10:24] a poorer quality
[10:27] of leadership in the nation
[10:31] until if we were to come up to that
[10:34] this 20th century and this
[10:38] 20 to 2020
[10:43] 2021 we come to this
[10:46] time where we see america at her lowest
[10:50] point
[10:52] where the leadership has come
[10:56] almost to nothing
[11:01] the this
[11:04] poor caliber and quality of leadership
[11:08] have succeeded great men
[11:12] that have gone before worthy men
[11:16] that was in that position
[11:20] now then we see a an
[11:23] ahab with a jezebel
[11:26] uh behind him to direct him
[11:30] in everything that he does
[11:33] but thank god
[11:36] as it was then so was it again
[11:40] and so is it or then rose up the great
[11:44] messenger
[11:47] that the spirit of elijah that god sent
[11:51] in our day
[11:54] and then in this time of the
[11:58] latter rain this
[12:02] message of this messenger
[12:07] is now ready and a red for
[12:10] battle for a great mount zion
[12:14] showdown mount carmel showdown
[12:19] now we know that john the baptist
[12:23] was the forerunner of jesus
[12:26] christ and he
[12:30] planted of course the former
[12:34] reign
[12:37] it was rejected by the organizations
[12:40] of his day sadducees pharisees uh it was
[12:43] rejected
[12:45] and jesus came and he had a mount zion
[12:50] showdown the second
[12:54] forerunner of christ is going to saw the
[12:58] seed
[12:59] hallelujah for the latter
[13:02] rain oh glory to god hallelujah
[13:07] and when he saw the seed i
[13:10] tell you it will be a showdown
[13:14] between them denominations and creeds
[13:18] between them and the revealed
[13:21] word of god in the lives of the
[13:25] various believers
[13:28] and then he's gonna come back
[13:31] amen and take his
[13:35] bride in a rapture out of here
[13:38] praise god now when they spoke about the
[13:42] latter rain
[13:43] back in the pentecostal days
[13:47] they had a complete misunderstanding of
[13:50] the latter rain
[13:52] they did not understand what it was they
[13:55] just know
[13:56] knew it was the moving of the holy
[13:58] spirit
[13:59] or when they got a second wave
[14:02] within pentecost itself they called
[14:06] that the latter rain not realizing
[14:10] that when it comes to using the term
[14:14] latter rain first of all
[14:17] quoting brother branham spoken word is
[14:20] the original seed
[14:23] now joel in joel 2 28
[14:27] god is speaking about the coming
[14:31] of the former and later reign
[14:34] that he will pour out upon his people
[14:38] now the word former in hebrew
[14:41] is more
[14:50] h and that means teaching
[14:54] it'll be a teaching reign in other words
[14:58] a former and a lateran it would be a
[15:01] teaching rain
[15:03] and a harvesting amen
[15:07] teaching rain and a harvest
[15:10] rain praise god now
[15:13] we've had the teaching rain now we got
[15:16] to get ready
[15:17] for the harvest rain of course the first
[15:21] rain is when you
[15:22] plant the seed any farmer knows that you
[15:25] you plant the seed and you
[15:27] wait for the spring rain or the
[15:31] first rains former rains at
[15:34] planting time for that rain
[15:38] to germinate the seeds
[15:41] and there we have it but then
[15:44] there must come another rain
[15:47] when those grains or fruits begin to
[15:51] mature
[15:53] you see the sunlight the sun is not
[15:56] enough
[15:58] excuse me the sun will sweeten
[16:03] the grain or sweeten the fruit but if
[16:06] too much sun then it begins to dry up
[16:09] you need a bit of rain to give it some
[16:12] plumpness
[16:13] and ripeness moistness
[16:16] oh praise god how we need the
[16:20] spirit of god to fall upon the word and
[16:23] quitting the word of god
[16:25] to give us that sweetness plumpness and
[16:28] ripeness
[16:29] that we need in this day and in this
[16:32] hour as we minister the word of god
[16:36] to a people in this time
[16:39] of the harvest reign for the seed have
[16:42] been planted
[16:44] the water will raise it up again oh
[16:48] praise god hallelujah a prophet of god
[16:52] has come with the word of god the spoken
[16:54] word being the original seed
[16:57] that seed has been planted in in the
[17:00] heart
[17:01] of the true believers that believed it
[17:03] and received it
[17:04] oh praise god now it's been growing
[17:08] all through this time between his
[17:11] preaching passing and now
[17:15] the growing and now the maturity
[17:18] walking in the way and will of god
[17:21] hallelujah
[17:22] and now i want to tell you friends
[17:26] it's harvest time praise god hallelujah
[17:30] amen it was so strange
[17:34] that just before just before
[17:39] their planting become to a maturity
[17:43] just before the people entered into the
[17:46] promised land
[17:48] let me go back to elijah just before his
[17:50] ministry comes this maturity
[17:53] amen his elisha comes to his maturity
[17:57] elijah was called away into the presence
[18:01] of god
[18:02] just before joshua caleb and the young
[18:06] ones
[18:06] come to their maturity to enter into the
[18:09] promised land
[18:10] moses was called off the scene
[18:15] amen and jesus john was called into
[18:19] seclusion
[18:21] separated from those whom he loved
[18:25] but yet it was for a purpose and plan of
[18:28] god
[18:30] and many don't didn't mess up did not
[18:33] understand that kind of separation
[18:38] that kind of a seclusion
[18:41] but it was in the purpose plan
[18:45] of the living god to make the word
[18:49] come to life again see
[18:52] their messages have been had been
[18:54] rejected moses elijah
[18:57] and john the messages were rejected by
[19:00] the various
[19:02] groups that they had declared
[19:05] the word of god to but thank god
[19:10] their seed had been sown
[19:13] the message had gone forth through
[19:16] their ministry their planting time and
[19:20] hour was over amen
[19:23] the next thing was harvested judgment
[19:26] would strike the land straight the
[19:29] hearts
[19:30] they had served their purpose assigned
[19:33] posts to the nation and
[19:36] to the people so the next step

[25:46] hour lord of god hallelujah
[25:49] amen oh praise god
[25:52] thank god he sent to moses but moses
[25:56] could not
[25:57] come until the people cried in their
[26:01] heart
[26:02] and called out to god for they needed to
[26:06] have
[26:07] a touch from his mighty hand glory to
[26:10] god
[26:12] what a day what an hour you remember
[26:15] when moses was there in egypt
[26:19] how he threw his rod upon the ground
[26:23] and the bible says the magicians
[26:26] the wise men of pharaoh came
[26:30] and threw their rods upon the ground
[26:34] moses rod became a serpent
[26:37] their rods became serpents they were
[26:40] working signs and wonders too
[26:43] and they were doing it but the bible
[26:45] says moses is
[26:46] rod his serpent at the other serpents
[26:50] and swallowed them up completely
[26:54] amen but friends we are here
[26:57] in a day as our scripture says
[27:01] an evil and adulterous
[27:04] generation seeks after a sign
[27:10] there are multitudes of them
[27:13] moses came first through his
[27:16] stick on the ground became a serpent
[27:19] then here comes the impersonators
[27:21] here comes an army of copycats
[27:25] here comes these ones that were tried to
[27:29] to do exactly what moses did
[27:33] brother branham comes on the scene with
[27:35] a mighty
[27:36] gift of discernment first of all the
[27:40] first pull
[27:41] mighty gift of healing with the spirit
[27:44] of god
[27:45] moving within his hand it wasn't long
[27:48] after that
[27:49] there came a whole bunch of different
[27:51] preachers at that time
[27:53] with feelings in their hands and
[27:57] fire in their hand and blood in their
[27:59] hand of
[28:00] oil coming out to their hand and
[28:03] everything of
[28:05] that nature but not on not
[28:08] until god had produced it and manifested
[28:12] it
[28:13] through brother branham then we see all
[28:16] these ministries
[28:18] copycatting that then the spirit of god
[28:21] said okay
[28:22] he moved on to discernment where he
[28:25] would stand and
[28:26] with his back turned call the people by
[28:29] their names tell them their
[28:31] address where they're from where they
[28:33] were born
[28:34] and things when you were a child i i can
[28:38] see you you were sitting here
[28:40] and you were thinking you were thinking
[28:42] this this this this
[28:44] and is that true the person would say
[28:46] yes sir
[28:47] that's true oh thousands and
[28:50] thousands and tens of thousands of times
[28:53] are never one time
[28:55] wrong shortly after that
[28:59] oh we end up with a lot of disearners
[29:03] people began to discern they begin to
[29:06] suddenly start to
[29:07] claim everybody is a prophet everybody
[29:10] starts seeing things
[29:12] everybody start to get visions
[29:16] oh you never heard of that before
[29:19] but now all of a sudden there's a
[29:21] proliferation of them
[29:23] like like flies coming off of a dead
[29:26] carcass
[29:27] that all of a sudden you've gotten a
[29:30] whole set of them
[29:32] and now we are ending up with a
[29:34] multitude
[29:36] of sign seekers in one night
[29:40] what was seen in the ministry of this
[29:42] prophet
[29:43] thousands of deliverances thousands of
[29:47] miracles and healings
[29:48] they would be happy if they got ten and
[29:50] they would rejoice at what a revival
[29:53] what a big meeting they had
[29:55] one crippled walk and they oh it was so
[29:58] massive they put it in a magazine or
[30:00] something
[30:00] and it was just a normal everyday thing
[30:03] with him
[30:04] that even while he was going about his
[30:07] normal life during the day
[30:09] he'll be praying for people somebody
[30:11] will come he'll lay his hands upon them
[30:13] they'll be healed he'll tell them keep
[30:15] quiet don't tell anybody about it just
[30:17] go about your business
[30:18] they'll be delivered by the power of god
[30:20] not today they want the glory
[30:22] they want the popularity they want the
[30:25] money
[30:25] they want the spotlight they want the
[30:28] attention
[30:29] they want the name instead of taking the
[30:32] name of
[30:32] jesus and walking as his servants
[30:36] in the shadow in his shadow no
[30:39] they want to put themselves to the front
[30:43] whoa i am doctor so-and-so i have a phd
[30:48] lld you know i i have this and i have
[30:51] that they're plaster your wall
[30:54] with with degrees yeah oh my

[31:00] of that
[31:01] that's okay you keep professing i want
[31:03] to be possessing
[31:04] but in any case we find there are
[31:07] multitudes of them
[31:10] and we live in this day where they have
[31:13] universities they have bible schools
[31:16] they have
[31:16] all kinds of places putting those things
[31:19] out
[31:20] where you can literally take some money
[31:22] and go buy a
[31:24] buy a doctor divinity certificate or
[31:26] diploma
[31:28] you can go and pay for a of a
[31:31] doctor of this and a master of that and
[31:34] uh whatever else literally for
[31:38] money they can buy it
[31:41] my friends this is the world we are
[31:44] living in
[31:46] and that is why back to the word
[31:49] so that the word could straighten your
[31:51] mind your
[31:52] thinking your thoughts of your heart
[31:54] give you the clarity of
[31:56] thought and the clarity of discerning
[31:59] through
[32:00] the filters of the word of god and
[32:02] separate truth from
[32:04] error right from wrong o blessed be the
[32:08] name
[32:08] of the living god amen they know
[32:12] little or anything about the word but oh
[32:15] they'll
[32:15] jump they'll dance they'll scream for
[32:17] signs
[32:18] and wonders amen they don't know
[32:22] anything about the true move
[32:24] of the living god all they want to see
[32:26] is blood and fire and
[32:28] smoke and feathers and all kinds of
[32:32] various things
[32:35] they don't care what is in the word
[32:38] they're busy
[32:39] doing their gesticulations
[32:42] oh oh they don't want to hear
[32:46] what's in the word of god when the word
[32:49] says
[32:49] all that you do do in the name of jesus
[32:52] christ
[32:53] oh look what we're doing here contrary
[32:56] to the word of god
[32:57] amen i'm a preacher yes you may be
[33:01] assigned both
[33:02] but if the signpost is pointing in the
[33:04] wrong direction you're
[33:05] bearing false witness to the very word
[33:08] of god
[33:09] you claim to represent here it is my
[33:12] brothers
[33:13] and my sisters amen
[33:17] they'll support any sign no matter how
[33:19] unscriptural it is
[33:21] oil coming out of a statue
[33:24] blood coming from brick that man carved
[33:28] with his hand
[33:29] and then kneels before it to worship
[33:32] contrary to the word of god thou
[33:34] shalt not bow down to them nor serve
[33:38] them
[33:38] for i thy god and the living god
[33:42] hear o israel the lord thy
[33:45] god is one lord and the lord thy god is
[33:48] a
[33:49] jealous god amen back to the bible
[33:52] back to the word of god and the original
[33:56] faith taught unto us amen within
[34:00] his promise for this day amen
[34:03] god word warned us about this day coming
[34:08] matthew chapter 24 jesus speaks about
[34:11] this day
[34:12] coming how there'll be these two spirits
[34:15] upon the earth
[34:16] one a deceiving false
[34:20] and the other one the true spirit or the
[34:23] holy spirit
[34:24] who is the spirit of truth but there
[34:27] will be
[34:28] cl so close together that only the
[34:31] elected
[34:33] will be allowed to be able to detect
[34:37] or discern the difference between those
[34:40] two spirits
[34:41] it's just like in the garden of eden did
[34:45] you know satan came preaching to eve
[34:47] he said god said right he
[34:51] quoted what god said he caught it from
[34:54] the very
[34:55] they didn't have a bible then but he
[34:57] caught it from the word of god
[34:59] of what god said he said not god said
[35:02] this this this this and this yes he
[35:05] quoted from it
[35:06] he was one of the first early preachers
[35:10] amen oh my god had to come and say well
[35:14] look
[35:14] uh the woman's seed is gonna bruise that
[35:18] serpent's head
[35:19] and here comes god preaching the word
[35:22] but the two
[35:23] together like that it takes revelation
[35:27] discernment
[35:28] the discern between good and evil
[35:32] truth and error amen how you gonna tell
[35:35] those spirits apart
[35:38] both religious one esau one jacob both
[35:42] are sons
[35:43] what one claim is the son the other one
[35:45] playing jesus son
[35:47] how are you going to know which one
[35:50] is the ear of god
[35:53] my friends only one way give them the
[35:56] word
[35:57] test amen test them
[36:00] by the word as john said try every
[36:03] spirit
[36:04] and prove them amen whether they be
[36:07] in the faith hallelujah so
[36:10] you've got to give give them the word
[36:12] test and if they
[36:14] don't speak in line with the word
[36:17] they are of their father the devil
[36:20] who was a liar from the beginning
[36:23] and he deceived the first two brides
[36:28] they deceive eve in the garden he
[36:31] deceived
[36:32] the church after paul left the scene
[36:36] and took her into the dark ages
[36:39] he deceived them but this one
[36:42] who is predestinated by election
[36:45] to receive this word of god she will not
[36:48] be deceived
[36:49] individually individuals may be well
[36:52] if they listen to the lies of the
[36:55] serpent
[36:56] whispering and hissing within their ears
[37:00] but listen to the voice of god in these
[37:02] last days
[37:03] listen to the word of god that's been
[37:06] given to you
[37:07] in this hour amen see trying to
[37:11] get the last that brighter hybrid dies
[37:14] herself and
[37:15] mongrel lies whatever she's going to
[37:17] bring forth amen
[37:19] but we want to produce nothing but the
[37:21] pure
[37:22] word of god hallelujah
[37:26] amen praise god many are leave
[37:29] many are being fallen by the wayside
[37:32] because they're taken to creeds
[37:36] take into their own thoughts turning
[37:39] from
[37:40] god's original word to a great
[37:44] time of science seeking music
[37:47] loud music dancing shouting
[37:51] running up the aisles amen that's good
[37:55] amen but god never plays
[37:58] signs ahead of his word
[38:02] the bible tells us signs should follow
[38:05] the word
[38:06] amen oh my signs will
[38:09] follow them that believe it doesn't
[38:12] precede
[38:13] they want signs to for a revival
[38:16] and it's not that the signs don't
[38:18] produce the revival
[38:19] the word is supposed to produce the move
[38:23] of god
[38:23] and then signs follow amen
[38:27] after that so stay with god's word
[38:31] and promise of the hour remember when
[38:35] elijah came to that widow he said bake
[38:38] me a cake first
[38:40] and god always says you give me
[38:43] seek first the kingdom god always wants
[38:46] to come to his word
[38:48] first receive the promise first
[38:51] and then all these other things will be
[38:54] added to you
[38:55] and manifested through your life for his
[38:59] glory
[39:00] and for his honor amen praise
[39:03] god come to the word first that for the
[39:06] seed word of god
[39:08] then becomes quickened by the blessed
[39:11] holy spirit
[39:12] amen how can a messenger from god
[39:16] differ with the word of god
[39:19] how can the true messenger of god preach
[39:22] tree gods
[39:23] or tree in one how can a messenger
[39:26] teach something like the trinity when
[39:29] that
[39:30] is only uh something that came
[39:33] forth uh in the early parts of
[39:37] christianity paganism
[39:40] introduced into christianity by the
[39:43] pagans
[39:45] of pagan rome and brought in
[39:48] until today it's accepted as fact that
[39:50] that's the word of god
[39:51] it's not the word of god for god does
[39:55] not change his word or his mind about
[39:58] his word
[39:59] when he said i am one hero
[40:02] israel jehovah is one praise
[40:06] god i the lord thy god i'm a jealous god
[40:10] amen praise god jesus said
[40:13] i am praise the lord i and my father
[40:17] are one not three not two not
[40:21] million whatever one praise
[40:24] god and that is what he taught and that
[40:27] is what
[40:28] we believe a true preacher true man of
[40:32] god will declare
[40:33] the whole word not part of the word
[40:37] and then high discrepancy doctrine part
[40:40] of the word
[40:41] and hide from the people that it's only
[40:43] one not
[40:44] three and baptism is to be in the name
[40:47] of jesus christ not in the
[40:49] titles of father son and holy ghost
[40:52] which are not even names but
[40:54] only the titles of the one person who is
[40:57] a father
[40:58] who came as a son and is now in
[41:01] invisible form as the holy ghost
[41:03] amen hallelujah glory to his marvelous
[41:07] wonderful name amen denominations
[41:12] hated him then and they're gonna hate
[41:14] you now
[41:15] but stand by the word of the living god
[41:18] like they crucified him and persecuted
[41:21] him
[41:22] so he said they're going to persecute
[41:24] you they're going to call you all
[41:26] mandarin names and speak
[41:28] evil and spread all matter of rumors
[41:31] about you
[41:32] amen praise god hallelujah
[41:35] oh i thank god that he sent a messenger
[41:39] in our day a true voice of
[41:42] god in these last days
[41:45] hallelujah to get a people ready
[41:49] for the rapture oh glory to god
[41:52] and that they will act like abraham
[41:55] did as for they are the royal
[41:58] seed of abraham who
[42:02] held to god's word in god's hand
[42:05] and in this hour we will hold
[42:08] god's unchanging hand or praise his name
[42:12] because we are predestinated together
[42:15] to be caught up to meet him in the air
[42:18] by the power of the blessed holy spirit

[42:37] oh there's only one glimmer of light
[42:41] and it's coming out of this message left

[44:02] problems like any other country
[44:04] every that's everywhere but i'm telling
[44:07] you all
[44:08] as a whole there's a great mixture
[44:11] within that nature that nation
[44:14] at that this particular time that she's
[44:18] back
[44:18] in her homeland amen praise the
[44:22] lord jesus thank god a messenger came
[44:26] that was dedicated
[44:30] to the word of god
[44:33] and his presence was indicated
[44:37] by the word of god malachi 4 5
[44:40] and his ministry was vindicated

[45:06] versus era lies
[45:10] amen verses
[45:13] the light and truth coming from the word
[45:16] of god
[45:18] many people will not understand this
[45:20] message
[45:21] many people will hate it many will be
[45:24] angry with it
[45:25] and that's because they have been taught
[45:28] the scripture
[45:30] church people so-called christian people
[45:32] yet they'll be angry
[45:34] and misunderstand because they've been
[45:37] taught a certain way
[45:39] and to see the bible from a certain
[45:41] perspective
[45:43] they have on blinders like we put on
[45:47] on horses and donkeys
[45:50] and they're looking through blinders
[45:53] they can't see
[45:54] here they can't see they're just looking
[45:57] in one direction
[45:58] and won't listen to anything air else
[46:02] blind their eyes and deafen their ears
[46:05] and
[46:05] harden their hearts and refuse to
[46:09] recognize the word of god for this day
[46:12] and for this hour amen because they're
[46:16] looking at the scripture in a certain
[46:18] way that
[46:19] they consider to be
[46:22] the truth amen and even
[46:26] a lot of good men and there's a lot of
[46:29] good men
[46:29] and good preachers out there in those
[46:31] denominations
[46:33] when i speak of denominations i'm not
[46:35] speaking about the people in there
[46:38] those people are people in there who are
[46:41] following that because they're trying to
[46:43] meet their spiritual hunger and quench
[46:46] their thirst it's not their fault
[46:48] but the denominational system
[46:51] has caught them in a net of
[46:55] unbelief contrary to the word of god
[46:59] and a lot of men and women
[47:02] and children young people are caught in
[47:05] that denominational uh trap
[47:08] there and so they misunderstand
[47:12] this word and this preaching
[47:16] of this word of god and misunderstand
[47:20] this messenger
[47:21] will call him all kinds of names call
[47:24] you all kinds of names
[47:26] because so much has been called the
[47:29] truth
[47:31] every one of those denominations claim
[47:32] they have the truth
[47:34] oh my i don't have to tell you i have
[47:37] the truth
[47:38] you search the scriptures and then you
[47:40] you believe you'll find it or think you
[47:42] find eternal life
[47:43] you will see you'll know whether i'm
[47:46] telling you the truth or not
[47:47] recognize it by the word the holy spirit
[47:51] will lead you and guide you amen
[47:54] thank god all mine
[47:58] and just as john came the first time
[48:01] and said behold the lamb of god
[48:04] that taketh away the sins of the world
[48:08] thank god he sent another prophet to the
[48:11] gentile dispensation
[48:15] who not only says behold the lamb of god
[48:18] the word
[48:19] that uh you know the beholder that
[48:22] taketh away
