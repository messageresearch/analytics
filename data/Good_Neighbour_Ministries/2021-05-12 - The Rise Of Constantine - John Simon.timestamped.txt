[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] good evening my dear friends
[0:16] what a joy it is to come into the house
[0:18] of god
[0:19] one with the other gathered together
[0:23] in his name this
[0:26] living assembly of the saints of the
[0:30] most
[0:31] high god we are here for another church
[0:34] age lesson
[0:37] and our scripture for
[0:41] tonight is found in revelation
[0:44] chapter 2 verses 14
[0:48] to 16. and our
[0:51] topic is the rise of
[0:54] constant time the rise of
[0:58] constant time let us read our scriptures
[1:01] have a
[1:01] brief word of prayer and a
[1:04] short bible study in the presence of the
[1:07] lord
[1:08] as we prepare for the weekend
[1:12] and for those who come into his presence
[1:16] with thanksgiving and with joy we
[1:18] welcome
[1:19] all of you baptized
[1:22] unbaptized preparing to be baptized
[1:26] having your hearts open and ready to
[1:28] receive the word of god
[1:30] may the great holy spirit of almighty
[1:33] god
[1:34] minister to you the truth of his word
[1:38] we read from revelation chapter
[1:42] 2 but i have a few
[1:45] things against thee because
[1:49] thou has there them
[1:52] that hold the doctrine of balaam
[1:57] who taught balak to cast
[2:01] a stumbling block before the children of
[2:04] israel
[2:06] to eat things sacrificed
[2:10] onto idols and
[2:13] to commit fornication
[2:17] so hast thou also them
[2:20] that hold the doctrine
[2:24] of the nickelodeons
[2:27] which thing i hate
[2:31] glory be to god
[2:37] our gracious heavenly father
[2:41] we thank thee for the reading of the
[2:43] word
[2:44] we pray that the great holy spirit will
[2:47] once again
[2:48] visit with us breaking the bread of life
[2:53] and causing us to drink of the
[2:56] stimulating effects
[2:59] of the presence and the power
[3:02] the efficacy of the holy spirit
[3:06] within our hearts and within our lives
[3:09] in the midst of
[3:10] the weak mingling mixing rubbing our
[3:14] shoulders
[3:14] and our our beings and our our
[3:18] our thoughts with the people of the
[3:21] world and the things of the world
[3:23] oh god which we were once in and we
[3:27] so love them pity them
[3:30] sorry for them and pray
[3:34] that the blood of jesus
[3:37] will be shed abroad in their hearts
[3:40] and they'll be brought to the knowledge
[3:44] the same knowledge that that was given
[3:46] to
[3:47] us by the opening of our hearts and of
[3:50] the word
[3:52] to thee be the praise that you showed
[3:55] mercy to us
[3:58] that we were allowed father to approach
[4:01] thee
[4:03] by the opening of our eyes and our ears
[4:06] to others
[4:06] their ears are deaf and their
[4:10] mouths are sealed but to us you have
[4:13] given to us
[4:14] an open door to thee be the praise the
[4:18] honor and the glory for we ask it in no
[4:22] other name
[4:24] but in the name of our lord jesus christ
[4:27] amen and amen
[4:32] praise god last week
[4:36] we spoke of the church of god
[4:41] in a state of pergamus
[4:45] in a state of purgatory
[4:48] in a state of persecution
[4:51] uh so we can understand that the church
[4:54] of god
[4:56] the little church that had the
[4:59] revelation
[5:00] of one god being persecuted by those
[5:04] babylonian
[5:06] priests who had
[5:09] the favor of the then
[5:13] seat of government
[5:16] and so using their favor they could
[5:20] manipulate
[5:23] the powers of the government
[5:26] to act on their behalf
[5:30] and to persecute the saints of god
[5:34] just as much as cain who was a brother
[5:39] persecuted abel who was
[5:42] his brother and so
[5:46] that happened naturally in genesis
[5:51] no it it ha it happened then
[5:54] spiritually and it is happening again
[6:00] in our day and in our time
[6:04] and i want you to be absolutely
[6:08] conscious of that or
[6:11] having a spiritual awareness
[6:15] that you might recognize it for everyone
[6:20] says i'm a christian i'm a believer i go
[6:23] to a church i do this i do that
[6:26] well cain was from the same mother or
[6:29] mother church eve we came from the same
[6:31] mother
[6:32] but they were not of the same father one
[6:35] of god
[6:36] one of the devil one of adam and one of
[6:40] the serpent
[6:41] we must recognize that this is why
[6:44] the bible tells us try the spirits
[6:49] and see if they be of god
[6:52] how do you tried a spirit they're
[6:55] tested or tried by the word of god
[7:00] give them the word test
[7:04] how do they react to this message
[7:08] how do they react to the truth
[7:12] of the word of god do they try to
[7:15] explain it away do they try to shuffle
[7:17] it away put it under a rug
[7:19] put it in the past or do they try to
[7:22] uh you know reject it to be lit lit
[7:25] or uh uh you know just put it to the
[7:29] corner
[7:30] no my brothers the moment you see that
[7:33] you realize that that's a spirit of
[7:36] darkness
[7:38] a spirit of light wants the truth
[7:42] what's the revelation wants the power of
[7:45] the holy
[7:46] spirit because man's soul is not
[7:50] fed by intellectual information
[7:54] even though to survive in this modern
[7:56] world
[7:57] it that is important education
[8:01] information is important
[8:04] but that is only to exist in this
[8:06] present
[8:07] world but to have fellowship
[8:11] in your encounters with god my friends
[8:14] we need that connection that
[8:18] supernatural invisible union
[8:22] of your soul to christ
[8:25] christ just means the anointed word
[8:29] for he was the anointed physically the
[8:32] anointed
[8:33] word son of god now we have the written
[8:36] word
[8:37] but only when the holy spirit comes and
[8:39] anoints that
[8:41] word to your eyes the word
[8:44] opens up your your vision breaks
[8:46] revelation
[8:47] comes and then you know how to act
[8:52] you don't just read the bible and try to
[8:55] act as they did in the past
[8:57] but you allow the holy spirit
[9:00] who is the same yesterday today and
[9:03] forever
[9:04] to reveal his word to you
[9:08] and without thinking about it you will
[9:11] be
[9:11] under his influence his power where you
[9:14] will be acting the life
[9:16] and living the life of christ even
[9:20] automatically and even unconsciously
[9:25] you won't have to think about your
[9:26] christianity anymore
[9:28] you have to try to do this i have to be
[9:30] that i have to do this
[9:32] i can't do this and i can't do that and
[9:34] they can't do the other
[9:36] now we don't do something certain things
[9:38] not because we can't but we don't want
[9:41] to
[9:42] because the word tells us and we want to
[9:44] walk
[9:45] in union and in line with the word of
[9:48] god
[9:48] and to obey the word of god hallelujah
[9:51] glory to god
[9:53] so the terrible
[9:56] persecution of
[9:59] official rome fell upon the
[10:04] true believers of that time
[10:07] until constant time arose
[10:10] on the scene and the first
[10:14] thing he did was to grant
[10:18] freedom excuse me
[10:22] freedom of religious worship
[10:27] and he had a reason or reasons
[10:30] why he granted religious
[10:33] freedom of religious worship
[10:38] and one he realized that the good
[10:42] emperors before him
[10:46] were emperors that left the christians
[10:49] alone
[10:51] and allow them to worship
[10:54] their god for the romans had many gods
[10:59] god for harvest god for traveling god
[11:01] for sickness
[11:03] god for this and a god for that now
[11:05] maybe called saints now but
[11:08] but that's what the romans had back then
[11:10] various
[11:11] gods for different uh things
[11:15] and so he left the christians alone
[11:18] because he believed in the eyes of the
[11:21] population he would be perceived as a
[11:25] good emperor
[11:29] and he realized
[11:33] that killing christians was a senseless
[11:36] affair
[11:38] there was no real political capital
[11:43] for him in engaging
[11:46] in killing christians
[11:51] and finally he noticed that the public
[11:54] had got
[11:54] tired of this bloody
[11:58] persecution of the christians
[12:01] and they didn't like it anymore
[12:05] even though they were pagans themselves
[12:07] they
[12:08] there were satiated
[12:12] with uh this bloody time
[12:16] of christians as the bible says they eat
[12:19] up my
[12:19] people as they eat bread oh my
[12:23] and thousands of believers slaughtered
[12:27] and killed at that time
[12:30] and the public turned against it and he
[12:34] recognized
[12:35] it as a good politician
[12:39] he left it alone and he
[12:42] took the uh persona
[12:45] he took the the appearance
[12:49] or to project the fact that he wanted to
[12:53] be
[12:53] recognized as a good emperor
[12:58] and so the persecution halted
[13:01] and christians began to have freedom of
[13:04] worship
[13:06] and to be able to give glory to their
[13:09] god
[13:09] on high that was his first reason for
[13:13] giving them
[13:15] freedom of religious worship
[13:19] the second and the best known reason
[13:23] is because constantine knew that he had
[13:26] a very
[13:27] difficult battle military
[13:31] battle ahead and
[13:34] he needed all the help
[13:38] that he could get
[13:42] because it was important for him
[13:45] to win that battle so that he could have
[13:49] the control
[13:52] of farm control on his
[13:55] empire the roman empire at that time
[14:01] one night
[14:04] he went to bed
[14:07] and constantine dreamed the dream
[14:12] and in his dream he saw a white cross
[14:17] appearing before him
[14:23] and the voice speaking saying by
[14:26] this thou shalt conquer
[14:30] and so he walk out of the dream
[14:34] struck by it him being a pagan
[14:39] why would he have a dream like that he
[14:42] looked on it as an
[14:43] old man from some higher power
[14:48] that was trying to tell him that if he
[14:51] got the christians to pray for him
[14:54] he would get the victory he
[14:58] would win the battle
[15:01] so he went to the christians
[15:06] and asked them to pray for him
[15:09] and promise them that if their prayers
[15:13] were
[15:14] effective he promised them
[15:17] absolute total freedom
[15:20] of worship and service to their
[15:24] god on high well
[15:28] you know the rest of the story he
[15:31] was victorious
[15:35] and freedom of religious
[15:38] worship was now granted
[15:42] not by just whim or
[15:45] wish or just mere words
[15:49] of the emperor but from the edict
[15:52] of nantes n-a-n-t-e-s
[15:57] 3-12 a.d
[16:00] freedom of worship
[16:03] was legally granted to christians
[16:10] and constantine
[16:13] made himself
[16:16] the patron
[16:19] of christianity at that time
[16:23] so he was the emperor but he made
[16:25] himself
[16:26] the patron because he now felt that if
[16:29] he took care of these christians and
[16:32] and and behaved in such a way
[16:35] that he could be a help to them
[16:39] whoever their god was would bless him
[16:42] and bless his empire watch over him
[16:46] and keep him safely so
[16:50] as a petr patron
[16:53] he decided that the church needed his
[16:56] help
[16:58] there you go now here is man
[17:01] trying to work the righteousness of god
[17:04] by his own will this is not by a dream
[17:08] this is not by a revelation this is not
[17:11] by direction
[17:12] this is his own feeling even though it's
[17:14] a good desire
[17:17] even though it's a good thought but it
[17:19] was not
[17:21] god's perfect will many times we have a
[17:24] thought
[17:25] we think this we think that go back to
[17:28] the word
[17:28] is it there does the word permit you
[17:31] does the word allow you
[17:32] is it the truth is that what god is
[17:35] telling you
[17:36] according to his promises within his
[17:40] word and so
[17:44] he decided that he would help the church
[17:48] in every way
[17:50] especially in her own affairs
[17:54] and here is where he uh emperor
[17:58] a politician a military man
[18:02] puts his influence and his hand
[18:06] into the affairs
[18:09] of the church my friends
[18:13] you understand what that is
[18:16] that how god's church
[18:20] and god's truth is is strange
[18:24] to the world and the those that are of
[18:27] the world
[18:29] and then that spiritual man an unnatural
[18:31] man
[18:32] can hardly find agreement because the
[18:35] natural spirit of natural man will not
[18:38] uh you know be in agreement with the
[18:41] spirit of god because one is carnal
[18:43] one is spiritual oh my
[18:47] and so the church started to go
[18:50] now into a tail spin like an airplane
[18:54] falling from the sky
[18:58] why he wanted to help the church
[19:00] [Music]
[19:02] is because this
[19:05] sworn in the flesh
[19:10] this patch of weeds
[19:14] in god's garden of eden
[19:17] began to come up
[19:20] because leaders of the church
[19:24] were in disagreement
[19:28] over certain doctrines and teachings in
[19:30] the church
[19:32] there was one called arius
[19:35] bishop of alexander who
[19:38] taught his followers
[19:42] believers that jesus was not
[19:46] god he was not truly god that's what he
[19:49] was teaching
[19:50] while yet claiming to be a christian
[19:55] of course the other group of people
[20:00] from the western church held a totally
[20:03] opposite view believing that jesus
[20:08] was the very essence of the one true god
[20:13] amen hallelujah
[20:16] so that caused the emperor
[20:20] to call for what we know in history
[20:24] and what you should note call for the
[20:28] council at the city of nicaea
[20:33] in 325 a.d
[20:36] called the nicean council
[20:41] and that council as i have for told you
[20:44] was the purpose
[20:46] is to work out the difference
[20:49] between jesus not being god
[20:54] and jesus being the essence of god the
[20:58] one true god
[21:01] god and flesh appearing hallelujah glory
[21:04] to god
[21:05] amen and so
[21:09] here it was this
[21:13] intrusion or interference
[21:18] of pagan influence
[21:22] through the emperor who thought he was
[21:24] doing good
[21:27] into private church
[21:31] affairs at the particular time
[21:39] was not according to the word
[21:42] even though you see i want you to catch
[21:45] this
[21:46] back of his thoughts he really thought
[21:48] he was doing good
[21:49] because he believed now he was uniting
[21:54] having this council so that he could
[21:57] unite
[22:00] the christians the two parties
[22:04] one believing in jesus christ as the one
[22:07] only true god
[22:09] and the other believing he is not god
[22:12] as such and so
[22:16] he wanted them to iron out their
[22:19] differences
[22:20] and come to a common
[22:23] understanding you're going to find that
[22:26] that same spirit
[22:28] that caused him to do that runs
[22:31] right into our day and in our time
[22:35] still attempting to do the same thing
[22:38] between the doctrines
[22:42] of the trinity and the teachings
[22:46] of hero israel the lord
[22:50] thy god is one lord there is one lord
[22:55] and jehovah that led the churn
[22:59] of israel as a pillar of fire as the
[23:02] cloud of fire in the old testament
[23:06] is the same jesus of the new testament
[23:11] for back there he was in a pillar of
[23:13] fire
[23:14] he was in a bush a burning bush he was
[23:16] in a pillar of fire he was in a pillar
[23:18] of cloud
[23:19] and now he comes back
[23:22] but where they try to to intertwine
[23:26] their trinity doctrine
[23:28] they don't realize that that was not a
[23:30] second person
[23:33] but that the god the eternal spirit
[23:37] the father spirit created
[23:40] a body for himself
[23:44] and that body was called his
[23:48] son because it came out from him
[23:52] and that body was a temporal one
[23:56] that he could come into
[23:59] and use so that he could speak
[24:03] to his people through that body
[24:07] so this is my beloved son hear
[24:11] ye him why because god was in christ
[24:16] reconciling the world onto himself
[24:21] and so
[24:24] all of this started with constantine
[24:27] trying to bring union unity of
[24:30] all the of the churches at that time
[24:33] that time
[24:34] together as one but that spirit didn't
[24:38] die
[24:38] it's alive until today
[24:42] still attempting to form a world
[24:46] council of churches still trying to
[24:49] bring about
[24:50] an ecumenical council
[24:54] and in their minds and in their hearts
[24:58] they're thinking like constantine did
[25:01] that this is a good thing this is a
[25:02] wonderful thing
[25:04] they're not seeing behind it
[25:07] the workings of that satanic power
[25:11] they're not seeing behind it the powers
[25:14] of darkness
[25:16] they are not seeing behind it the lies
[25:19] of
[25:19] lucifer they do not see the real
[25:22] motivator puppet master and engineer
[25:26] of what is really going on
[25:31] oh what satan failed to
[25:35] achieve back then he
[25:39] will achieve for the bible tells us that
[25:42] later on he
[25:43] will achieve that
[25:46] and it will come to pass that he will do
[25:48] it through
[25:50] an ecumenical move but thank god
[25:53] may god help us that before that time
[25:57] that he'll catch his waiting right away
[26:01] and she'll be in the presence of
[26:02] almighty god
[26:05] when this tribulation on the earth
[26:07] starts
[26:08] and the purging of sin and the purging
[26:11] of evil
[26:13] oh the coming of the king with his
[26:16] bride beside him riding on a white horse
[26:19] and his name shall be called the word of
[26:22] god
[26:22] hallelujah with the armies of heaven
[26:26] following him to bring about judgments
[26:29] of the wrath of god
[26:31] upon the face of the earth at that
[26:34] particular time
[26:35] oh praise god oh it's always
[26:39] a troublesome thing when governments
[26:44] begin to put their fingers and to
[26:47] interfere into the
[26:50] word of god and interfere
[26:54] in the ways of the
[26:57] church of the living god
[27:01] now the very decision in that
[27:04] that time that was handed down by the
[27:07] council of course
[27:12] uh was first of all they said it was
[27:15] right
[27:16] that jesus was the very essence of god
[27:20] two years later on the pagan influence
[27:23] that reversed it
[27:25] and said no uh that was
[27:29] that was a wrong judgment we gave
[27:32] and from that time that false doctrine
[27:36] started being foisted or placed
[27:41] in the minds and in the hearts of the
[27:43] people
[27:46] and it opened the door
[27:49] also for church and state to come
[27:53] together
[27:54] but this wasn't ready for known by god
[27:57] because
[27:58] look what age we are studying here today
[28:02] the age of pergamos
[28:05] and pergamos or the word pergamos
[28:08] means one sorry
[28:12] married sorrowly married
[28:15] so god already through the spirit of
[28:18] prophecy
[28:19] through the telescopic vision of god's
[28:23] prophetic
[28:24] saints uh prophets and servants
[28:27] he foretold that there would be a
[28:31] marriage a spiritual marriage taken
[28:34] place
[28:34] and here is what it is and here it was
[28:38] the spiritual marriage between state and
[28:41] church
[28:43] to this day those attempts are
[28:46] constantly
[28:48] being made
[28:51] church and state married
[28:55] now those babylonian priesthood
[29:00] could achieve their work
[29:03] of marrying the church
[29:06] joining or uniting the church with
[29:09] politics
[29:11] so politics and religion
[29:15] got united
[29:18] and the offspring
[29:22] or the child of that kind of a union
[29:24] what else could it be but some
[29:26] hybrid denominational uh work
[29:31] i'll just stop there and you can take
[29:33] that on
[29:36] but all manner of hybrids
[29:39] and eve brought 14
[29:44] and now the state
[29:48] government mixed into
[29:52] the church brings forth nothing but a
[29:55] hybrid
[29:58] yes sir what did this interference
[30:01] accomplish
[30:04] first of all by interfering
[30:07] into the affairs of the church
[30:10] the church got married to the state who
[30:13] now
[30:13] feels it's responsible
[30:16] to watch over the church imagine that
[30:19] the state watches over the church
[30:21] when the church been the spiritual one
[30:23] that has the heart and the mind the eyes
[30:26] leadership guidance prophetic powers of
[30:29] the holy spirit
[30:30] to be able to even go to the king
[30:34] and tell him oh king this is happening
[30:36] this is going to happen that's going to
[30:38] happen but of course now they don't
[30:39] believe such things
[30:40] like elisha going to the king and say oh
[30:43] the enemy is going to attack you around
[30:45] here
[30:46] put your armies there or they're trying
[30:48] to come by this area
[30:50] no they don't believe in that anymore
[30:53] they don't trust that they will now come
[30:55] and tell the church
[30:56] what to do and how to do it but they try
[30:59] to do it in such a way
[31:00] well we only cost so far and the rest
[31:03] believe to you
[31:04] but they make sure they have their hands
[31:06] on it they can control
[31:08] every part of it now make no mistake
[31:10] about it
[31:11] god says you are to heed the higher
[31:14] powers that above you
[31:17] god tells us whether it's a good or a
[31:20] bad government he said be
[31:22] subject to the higher powers
[31:25] god put them there for a reason
[31:28] regardless of good or bad that's not our
[31:30] business
[31:31] we are here to be christians and to live
[31:34] the life god
[31:35] wants us to live amen
[31:38] now notice carefully
[31:42] while politics married to christianity
[31:46] at the same time that interference of
[31:48] christian time
[31:49] caused paganism babylonianism
[31:54] to be married into christianity
[31:58] so it's that the nicene concert paganism
[32:02] and christianity
[32:03] got mixed and intermingled together
[32:08] and all those mystery babylon
[32:12] teachings of the babylonian priesthood
[32:16] with its orders secret societies
[32:19] with all of its so-called uh
[32:23] mysteries and hidden knowledge
[32:26] got mixed into christianity
[32:29] and now they can put christian labels on
[32:33] it
[32:34] they can legitimately call themselves
[32:37] this or that name themselves with a
[32:40] christian name
[32:42] to gain credibility
[32:47] now constantine's interference also
[32:51] caused federal
[32:54] aid or government aid
[32:57] could now flow into the churches
[33:01] legally by law
[33:05] because that's the time when
[33:08] churches began to have money
[33:13] constantine began to give them buildings
[33:16] now you i i can't go on this but let me
[33:19] just drop the thought
[33:20] jesus never really had a church building
[33:23] none of the apostles if you read in your
[33:25] bible they know about the church
[33:26] building
[33:27] they met in homes they met everywhere
[33:29] it's
[33:30] at this particular time
[33:33] that he began to give buildings
[33:36] and caused the people to come up from
[33:38] homes come out from caves
[33:40] and grow into buildings
[33:43] now i'm not saying that we should go
[33:45] back on the trees
[33:47] or on the buildings i'm just showing you
[33:50] the
[33:50] the truth or the rationale of why
[33:54] this has happened just to protect us
[33:56] from the heat and the cold and
[33:59] our physical body give us shade and
[34:01] stuff like that
[34:02] uh but originally it was not
[34:06] so or we shall say in the words of god's
[34:08] servant
[34:09] in the beginning it was not so
[34:14] and so here it was
[34:17] the church began to fall air to
[34:19] properties
[34:22] beautiful buildings
[34:25] and money given to them to
[34:29] build beautiful marble
[34:32] white marble altars
[34:35] and beautiful carved
[34:38] images artistic they claim it's
[34:42] beautiful art
[34:43] it is but that's not whether it's art
[34:47] it's crude rude a rock
[34:50] or whether it's a beautiful image god
[34:53] said you shall thou
[34:57] shalt not bow down to them nor
[35:00] serve them for i the lord thy
[35:03] god am a jealous god oh
[35:06] my and yet my friends
[35:10] it's being done even to our day
[35:14] and given such so-called dignity
[35:17] acceptability and credibility that
[35:20] masses multitudes are drawn into this
[35:24] net this web of sin
[35:29] this web of disobedience to the will way
[35:32] and
[35:33] word of god back to the word
[35:36] back to the original faith back to the
[35:39] bible
[35:40] back to the sayings that god has given
[35:43] to us
[35:43] that we might keep his word with all
[35:46] our hearts amen
[35:50] and so here are the beautiful altars
[35:54] like cain had
[35:55] a beautiful altar while a bell's was not
[35:58] beautiful
[36:00] just looks rough and crude a bloody
[36:03] bleeding bleeding lamb
[36:06] that was there crying for its life but
[36:09] yet
[36:09] dying for the lost oh just as jesus
[36:13] eli eli lama sabactin i
[36:16] and he gave up the ghost the lamb of god
[36:20] given his life for the loss that we
[36:22] might be
[36:23] saved oh thank god i know it was the
[36:26] blood
[36:27] i know it was the blood i know it was
[36:29] the blood for me
[36:31] well that day jesus died upon the cross
[36:34] he gave his life up brother sisters
[36:36] for the lost amen hallelujah and i know
[36:40] it was the blood for me oh praise god
[36:43] forevermore amen it was
[36:47] right in this age
[36:50] according to revelation chapter 13
[36:54] verse 3 how that
[36:57] the beast was wounded
[37:01] unto death that was the pagan empire
[37:06] got wounded unto death
[37:09] but take god when we look in the bible
[37:12] we read
[37:13] that it actually came back to life
[37:16] next week we'll speak about that
[37:19] we'll expand a little more so you can
[37:23] fully
[37:23] and truly understand and i would like
[37:27] for you to read in preparation for that
[37:32] uh danielle chapter 2
[37:36] verses 31 to 35.
[37:40] we would love to read that during the
[37:43] week
[37:44] actually you can read the entire chapter
[37:46] but we will be focused on
[37:50] verses 31 to 35
[37:55] because this roman empire
[37:59] that was dying
[38:03] was wounded life
[38:06] bleeding out of it
[38:10] oh my friends
[38:13] was now about to arise come back to life
[38:20] amen but now imperial rome
[38:25] militaristic rome with all its legions
[38:29] is now transforming itself to return
[38:34] to power in the form
[38:37] of what is known today as the
[38:40] holy roman empire
[38:46] suddenly got holy no more pagan or no
[38:49] more so-called pagan
[38:50] in exit maybe pagan but her name
[38:55] was called the holy roman empire
[39:01] it suffered so much depletion
[39:05] so much losses right down through their
[39:08] entire histories
[39:11] oh when you see the time of the
[39:15] various ones right on true uh that'll
[39:18] take me into other histories let's just
[39:20] stop
[39:21] let's stop here we'll continue on next
[39:24] week
[39:25] as we go into how the
[39:28] roman empire transformed itself
[39:32] from a military and political power
[39:35] into a a religious power
[39:40] and therefore when it was dominating and
[39:43] controlling
[39:44] and ruling from the outside
[39:47] obvious as a military power
[39:51] it now transformed itself from a pagan
[39:55] militaristic political
[39:59] power into
[40:03] a religious
[40:06] power that would not control and rule
[40:10] from the inside now this is a symbol and
[40:13] type of
[40:14] mystery babylon and how the system works
[40:19] ruling and dominating
[40:22] right from the very confessionary of the
[40:26] priests
[40:27] right to the very pinnacles of rome
[40:31] tentacles everywhere in every nation
[40:34] every country
[40:36] almost at every street corner
[40:39] controlling
[40:40] dominating communications information
[40:44] flowing back and forth
[40:46] influences various kinds of powers
[40:50] acting as if it's a sleeping cat
[40:54] just sleeping with his eyes like lazy
[40:57] it's holy
[40:59] uh you know it's harmless until the
[41:02] moment
[41:02] comes it's disturbed and then the fangs
[41:06] come out and it's ready my friends
[41:09] to persecute and kill and destroy
[41:12] as it did in the years of the
[41:14] inquisition
[41:16] we will get back to the word of god we
[41:18] will talk more about this
[41:21] and get into the study of this
[41:24] are you with me shall i continue along
[41:27] this line
[41:28] oh praise god those those of you whose
[41:32] hearts are open whose minds are open
[41:34] and who are willing to receive this
[41:36] knowledge
[41:37] praise god take it in what you are
[41:41] receiving
[41:42] not even not many preachers don't hardly
[41:44] even
[41:45] know this they're not willing to receive
[41:48] this
[41:50] but god promised that he'll make the law
[41:53] places high and the high place is low
[41:57] may the great holy spirit take the
[41:58] knowledge of the word of god
[42:01] and fill all the earth and may the
[42:04] knowledge of the lord
[42:05] stand to the very end while we are
[42:08] waiting on the coming of the lord
[42:10] may the lord jesus christ bless you now
[42:13] and forevermore
[42:14] in a wonderful way and i'll be here with
[42:18] you preaching the word of god
[42:20] god bless you my brothers and sisters
[42:23] amen
[42:24] praise god
[42:45] [Music]
[43:00] you
