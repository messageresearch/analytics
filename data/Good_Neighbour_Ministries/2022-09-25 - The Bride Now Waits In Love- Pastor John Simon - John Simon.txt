you here despite the rainfall it's not brother Paul let's see now all right brought David yes yes yes praise the Lord glad to have him here praise the Lord God bless you real good brother I I can tell you God is doing something with this church uh and it's all it's out of my hands at this point I am just the speaker the the one used to be a voice uh for the word uh but really he is directing the church he is taking control of the church I'm just a visible representation of the pastor but the real Shepherd of the flock is Jesus Christ himself for the pillar of fire is just no more over there somewhere in a bush the pillar fires here he's with us his power is here his presence is here he's not a dead god of the Bible or in the Bible but he's a living God with us all in every step of the way praise the Lord because that is what we are about we are worshiping this person who as a brother Branham said we feel him in our hearts uh you can't prove nothing because you can't see you can't see much eyes but we we know is here by faith his action he says how you know uh the wind blood work listed no man knows where it goes but you know where the wind is when you see the leaves are moving you know the wind is passing by and it's the same way that we don't see the wind we don't see God but we know that he's here and we worship with the confidence of the unfailing reality of a living God hallelujah praise God God bless you let's go to our scriptures so we can begin to talk about the Lord I just say a few things here whether short long and then we go to our places amen John chapter 14 verses 1 to 4. John 14 1 to 4. praise the Lord we share with you the grace of God and the love of God may God bless us all amen our scripture let's read the scripture first of all to have a foundation let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether I go you know in the way you know praise the Lord hallelujah amen now our topic our subject for the day uh is the bride now waiting in love praise the Lord and adjust to throw the sin um I would have just arrived here on time and be here at the church and you know they have this blockage up there and I ended up going one way ended up all the way almost that way past the Bus Station train station into a big Park the road doesn't come out so I have to turn all the way and come back here again and can't come down so go back out and then come all the way around on burlock and then when I walked in and the thought says oh my goodness those people are waiting I hope they have patience and then my thoughts went back and said oh but your subject is the bride now waiting in love I said oh my praise God hallelujah Brethren everything we do even what appears to you to be a mistake is God knows what he is doing let us just rest in his unfailing grace as Abraham said shall not the judge of this Earth to write whatever God does is Right amen amen no matter what you think he said look I made you you clean my hands if I want to make you smash you up break you up turn you to dust and then make you all over again what do you have to say about it I am the Creator I am the maker I'm the one that's doing these things and it's for a purpose and a reason and my thoughts are above your thoughts so let's rest upon his unfailing grace our gracious father we thank you for the word thank you for your people here I want to be thank you for your presence we pray you'll bless us together as we wait on the showers of your grace and you receive all our glory honor and praise in Jesus name amen and amen the Lord bless you praise the Lord please be seated foreign 1965 and that would be paragraph uh 167. okay I repeat so that you may be able to afterwards check on it see whether the things I'm saying are true if they are in uh the message if they're in the Bible the word of God you're able to do that it's a God of this evil age 1965 paragraph 167. okay and it begins like this this little faith woman that lives by faith amen the bride their bride that person may be here there here off somewhere else in some other Church some other denomination wherever it is she the bride you see the idea that the bread is only made up of the people who claim to be in the message that's not what he's talking about here this is 1965. he is telling you clearly the bride that person that's here there off here off somewhere else in some other Church some other denomination whatever it is you see the Bride is a makeup of wherever God has hid her or placed her this is just now the time of in gathering this is the time of the last Harvest and he is gathering in her in wherever she is notice he identifies his bright hair and he calls her this little faith woman amen isn't that wonderful to know that God looks on us as the little faith woman well of course faith is a revelation so this little Revelation woman this woman who has a thirst for Revelation from the hand of God hallelujah this as we preached last Christmas this wise woman amen for you are wise when you seek God uh his Shining Light of Revelation you are counted wise and we see that Wise Women as we spoke of at Christmas there how God dealt with them and uh Elizabeth and Mary and how God worked through their lives to make them a blessing amen hallelujah and a woman or a church or a person as wise amen when God works through them by revelation hallelujah praise God and when she lives by the revelation of the word of God that's what makes her wife she's not wise in her own eyes she's not wise with her own understanding she is not wise with any of the denominational teachings she is not made Wise by intellectual uh discussions of even this message she is not made Wise by all kinds of concerted convoluted ideas coming from the minds of man and then trying to present that to the mind of the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah but thank God he has said the pure word and the true bride is able to discern it and to recognize it Hallelujah by Revelation through the presence of the holy spirit amen hallelujah amen yes listen here he says now she believes the word and then obedient to the word waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed what is she waiting for for the promise of the age to be confirmed but this is what I'm saying be heard be recognized Time for Action but don't act uh prematurely wait on the presence of God wait on the direction of God let the Holy Spirit lead when he is ready he is the one that will come and cross everything to get into action and to move by the Holy Spirit hallelujah oh praise God hallelujah yes sir she is wise because she lives by revelation this woman is wise because she can't live without the presence of her husband who is the word she needs the word that she might live hallelujah amen you see uh because of this word that God has given when it's revealed to you then you have something to believe without the Revelation you see faith it doesn't have anything to believe somebody say oh I believe this I believe that but why do you believe it do you have a revelation of it or you believe it because you read it or you believe it because you heard somebody say it uh what do you believe see a revelation uh puts it this way as I repeat now uh Revelation the prophet said nobody can give you that God himself has to give you that you can't get it from anywhere amen so Revelation then is by grace because it's not you can't study yourself into it you can't go and break in the window or the door and climbing like a thief on a robber you think you can but you really can't because Revelation is by grace and grace alone hallelujah amen and because this woman believes the real has the revelation of the word she can see something that she can believe in and she can rest her face on that hallelujah amen so she believes the word and because she believes with it all her heart praise God do you believe the word do you believe the revealed word praise God it's a difference in believing the written word it's another thing to believe the revealed word which is not different than the written word is spiritually unveiled to the individual amen it doesn't change the word make the written word different or something or the other it's just a spiritual unveiling of the written word to the individual Hallelujah giving them confidence in God hallelujah amen praise God Amen yes sir so here uh we see in God's wonderful word that she believes the word and because she believes the word that is and that gets the word preeminence and by the word having preeminence in her life and leading her guiding her instructing her sons and does the god led by the spirit of God she unconsciously begins to walk into a life of spiritual obedience to the world Hallelujah she doesn't have to walk around uh saying oh you know Ten Commandments yeah the first commandment is this the second commandment is that or walk around with the New Testament now well I got to remember Jesus said uh be not angry in certain situations and remember Paul said that you shouldn't do this in the you don't go around with those things at all because your control is not from the outside James said we have a witness inside is that right Paul talks about the power that worketh within us the prophet said the Sheep doesn't give wool coming from the outside the world comes from the inside of the sheep a mule a fox a wolf that can't go and try to produce wool no they have to go kill a sheep and then take that wall and scrape it somehow and then try to put it on and try to make themselves into a sheep but a real sheep that woe comes from the inside they don't have to work themselves into producing woe they don't have to work themselves into getting virtues you don't have to work themselves into anything they just feed on the Green Green Grass of the word amen and produce the white white milk of the manifestation of the Life of Christ the Pure Life of Jesus Christ begins to flow through them and the world comes out of them amen because they it's their nature to do that to produce the world so it's nothing they have to think about I'm talking about our Christianity an original Christianity that is not one by theology not one by the wisdom of even religious men it is not one imposed or given to us by even the Giants that we find in the land that we are in but we are to rest on his unfailing grace Hallelujah and by that Grace amen we are able to have victory for his life in US gives us the victory here life in US gives us Holiness he life in US gives us Perfection his life in US produces the fruit on these branches we are he is divine but we are the branches to produce the fruit Hallelujah but he gives us the sap he gives us the quickening power to produce the fruit in our lives so it's not about us it's about him [Applause] Glory worthy honor power adoration to Jesus Christ Our Lord who has given this to us amen blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen yes sir so she is obedient to the word not by legalism not just by our self saying oh I'm just gonna I'm just gonna do what the word says no even when she isn't thinking amen even when she's not thinking and she's just living she walks into Obedience of the word and if while doing that she makes a slip here a mistake there whatever she still keeps walking because she knows that the blood has already been shed to take care of all of that and all I have to come back and say Lord I know I shouldn't have done that I'm sorry Lord forgive me here forgive me there and then the blood already was always there his brother Branham said you asking me to pray for you for healing he says don't you understand your stripes were laid on him on the cross you're already healed hallelujah amen it's your face now in believing the word of God and God using me now to lift that Faith by pronouncing you heal but you're healed already he said even if I wanted to I can't heal you again because Jesus Christ done it all at the cross amen by his stripes we are healed we delivered we are saved praise God by the power of the Holy Spirit the presence of the Living God drives every devil away that can't stand in his word of the Living God amen hallelujah amen yes sir the Bible said she believes the word she has obedient to the word and now what does she do she gets to a place now where she just rests and she's waiting Hallelujah and I'm saying to you right now this is the time of the season when the bride is in a state of waiting in love for the word that she's been hearing recognizing through the age through the time through the season in all his forms and all its lights and all its shapes yeah she's been seeing it she's been rejoicing in it and she's waiting for that word now to be conformed for that promise to come alive for this Bible to move and live and be convincible before us the promises that he gave in this word to live in our day not in Paul's day nothing brother branham's day it lived over there we've seen that praise God we're witnessing to it but let the spirit of God witness to his own word in our day and keep promise in this day and that's what she's waiting for that's what I am waiting for that's what every one of us should be waiting for praise be to God look on my preaching here it's not going to bring it down praise the Lord all this is is here for is to open our understanding it's open our understanding so that we enter into a deeper state of rest just rest just relax God is working things out all right let me repeat it again I've said it over and over God is working things out there is no Tangles or no not in life that he can't undo God has the answer for every problem Jesus is the answer for every situation he is working Kings out amen and while he is working it out just rest you're having that headache you take the the the the uh well I didn't want because I'm on the internet here to be advertising for a brand name that's why I pause yeah yeah that's why I pause because I could have said said a headache pillars that's why I pause to be able to adjust myself there right but when you take the pill you don't lay on the bed analyzing I wonder if this so soon so chemical is interacting properly with some chemical and before it all works in my body to contact me in this nerve and pass through this part before it gets to the place that's aching no you don't think about it once you're taking that word once you take it in you just rest and let it do its work let him do his work don't get in his way don't get in this way just let the Holy Spirit do his work and he's working I said he's working the spirit of God is at work right now the Living God is taking care of everything right now he said but I don't know if he's seen me or if he's not my problem or he's taking care of me listen God knows every single ant in other words you've seen him on the platform calling the people by their name and call their address where they live and and then he says oh oh they don't believe he says well then uh remember when you were just a child and you were under a tree and you were looking towards the east and when you were looking towards the east when you were a child you are thinking and this is what you were thinking and he tells them what they were thinking what that is is not to bring glory to himself for you to look at him but that was God trying to show you I am God I know everything I go every one I know every situation I know every problem amen praise the Lord cast your cares on me for I care for you Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Living God I want you to know that clearly friends because she is now the bride now who recognizes the word amen I'm not saying the bride that claims she is in the message not the bride that says I believe the message not the bright or the person that said I believe the prophet I believe this quote I believe that but they have caught the revelation of the unwritten word Hallelujah now you must understand that uh uh uh what What's his name uh between Cain and Abel we'll get to that in a in a little while a little while we'll touch on that a little while and let you see clearly that uh Cain can can definitely did not want to subject himself to Abel's revelation right and God says the Revelation Abel has and had was the word for God bore witness to it even though think back then there was not one word written but evil got a revelation what word was that he got a revelation of what word we're not talking just about the writings in the Bible which we respect we love and we ought to believe in but the Bible is only a representation of an unseen being right and this being revealed to Abel that it was not a fish it was not a horse or a goat but you must kill a lamb which rep down the blood of the Lamb my friends will represent that thing that will save you sacrifice a lamb and all that with all prophecy and type Point into the coming of Jesus Christ the Lamb of God that would be sacrificed now he's in the beginning of the Bible getting a revelation is what's going to run right through the Bible right to the end of the Bible and here he is doing it by what by revelation by faith we understand no man can please God without faith no man can please God without a revelation so the unwritten word it was not written bible there was no books no nothing written yet but yet Abel knew now I won't expand on that now but what that Revelation that Abel had is what Cain was fighting against he was fighting against that because Abel couldn't pick up uh look the prophet said it here Abel couldn't do that there was no writing he couldn't even go to show me it in the Bible show me it in the word he couldn't go even to the world because they didn't have nothing written there to point anybody too amen he could only say I know God spoke to me and this is what he said oh but you can go off that way and get the false Doctrine or something like that but if it's the right spirit the Holy Spirit he can't differ from the word it doesn't matter even if you didn't know that verse it's in that word if the holy spirit is revealing choose a word amen it can't therefore so it's easy then for the True Believer to step off the boat and start walking on the water because they have faith in him amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah says she waits in love for his promised word of the age to be confirmed praise God or uh you know to be proven or use brother Branham use these words often to be Vindicated what we believe what we see in the word what we're trying to tell others and they may not be able to perceive or to understand because listen while I am talking like this you are talking like that Satan's got his agents peering peeping they're listening a word on word just like it is in the Bible they marked his mouth they go through everything he's saddened how he said it and everything else and and they were doing that brother Branham said to do what to find something that they could trip him up or or be able to tangle him up or to Blacken his name amen you see what they thought it was just him they didn't realize that they were fighting God Amen didn't realize that amen praise God hallelujah but she's watching she is waiting and listen what it says she is waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed to be Vindicated she is not only wearing she is watching for it so just waiting and she is watching oh praise God hallelujah we're waiting we're watching we're watching the signs we're watching every move we're watching everything that's taking place because we're waiting and we're watching praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God notice she is watching for she is part of that word Hallelujah so what is she what is he saying there she knows that she is a part of the word before she didn't know but now she knows she's part of that word she is part of that word that was before this Bible was ever written she was part of that Unwritten word that was with him and in him before the foundation of the world she was there with him and she recognizes that now Hallelujah not just by saying it makes you that amen but by knowing it through Revelation places you into that Dimension places you into that place amen she knows she was with him in eternity and it's because that she knows this she is waiting in love because she's waiting for what the rest of the word she's waiting for the rest of the world to come to the word that she's waiting for the Deep to call and come to the Deep amen that deep call to Something in the depths of your soul and brought you to himself and now that word wants to come with the true baptism of the holy spirit amen and come together amen for the invisible Union of praise God hallelujah amen for my glory to God God bless you amen many things I'm saying here praise God you know you can take an interpret it six other ways but if you've seen the right thing you recognize amen praise the name of the Lord Jesus oh praise God hallelujah amen so she's waiting in love for the rest of the word to come on on this word for this day and with this hour to finish the mystery to finish the mystery and to complete her purpose for this age see the mystery of the ages the true church hidden down through all these ages she is finishing that mystery now and she's empowered now by the rest of the word making her understand what was happening all down time until this hour and what she has to do and what is to fulfill in this age and in this hour amen as that word unfolds unveils itself piece by piece to her she's waiting in the middle of that unveiling praise God it's not like the unveiling of the Mighty God one day all of God was unveiled and and you got it no it continues like a Roman Candle to unfold and unfold and it keeps on veiling itself piece by piece to the True Believer As She Goes she goes amen hallelujah because she has to complete her purpose down here amen praise God hallelujah amen so she's waiting she's waiting for his life his life now amen to come to her for uh let me see if I have the scripture here Colossians chapter 3 verse 4 if you want to put that up there we might read a few verses but you don't mind that yes a few verses in there hallelujah amen because this bright body is waiting for his life now quickly to uh reiterate or to mention this again that we are in a condition like the first Adam was but now Through the Ages this was the building of the physical body of the second Adam that one lay on the physical Earth back then but now this is the new creation so we are Parts on pieces of that body of Christ who is the second Adam and the second Adam is on the earth now do you believe that amen praise God the second Adam is on the earth now but when God created Adam and had him on the earth there he did not come to life until the Bible says I am God breathes the breath of life and he became a living Soul amen God had to breathe so she is waiting for her life amen she's waiting for her life to come to her praise God Hallelujah to to confirm her position of who she is and to make the Bride come alive or the whole body come alive by his grace upon her hallelujah amen yes sir just waiting for that quickening power to come on the Living Word praise God on the word the Epistles of this hour to come upon it in this day and to manifest the life the perfect life of Jesus Christ I'm not saying you going out and trying to work yourself into that but I say saying uh God is his own interpreter who is going to interpret his life to this generation he did not intend that he's going to come back like he walked on the shores of Galilee and walked down the streets of New York and people would say oh there's Jesus oh that's how sweet he is that's how that's the picture they draw you of how sweet Jesus was he can't even point a straight finger his finger always has to be drooping or chocolaty and you know no no no no no no no he wasn't like that one minute he can be pick up the children with love in his arms and in the next minute he turned around and say castle out of Darkness weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth right amen so he was brought a lamb and a lion right so we see here praise God so when he he himself now comes to the his physical body on the earth at this age and in this stage he begins to live his own life through heart and they don't have to try and interpret the word for our two other people that's not what they have to do they just are resting and letting him interpret his own word interpret his own life manifest his own presence because his glib on everybody oh I'm born again oh I'm a Christian oh I'm this I'm that everybody can say that amen but the Bible says at Abel God proves confirm his testimony that he was right the bride is resting and waiting for her faith to be confirmed to be Vindicated problem that is just saith the Lord she for her she knows it's right she don't have to have it proven for her to know she already knows but for all the onlookers and wondering what's going on what are they talking about what are they thinking you know for Satan who might be want to know what is it they got a hold of what is this what's taking place amen God is going it's going to interpret his own life true of her praise God and let them deal with that amen do you believe that praise the name of the Lord praise the Lord let's read Colossians 3 from verse 4 and see what it says when Christ see she is waiting for her life amen the life to come to her the body amen now look who's this life when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall we also appear with him in glory because if he's in you they're going to see you and they're going to see him all at the same time you know they see Jesus they see the father it's all I and my father are wanting to see the same thing amen praise God if they can see praise the Lord let us continue Marty fight therefore the members which are upon the Earth amen fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence covetousness which is idolatry amen for which things seek the wrath of God come up on the children of disobedience amen praise the name of the Lord he knows that those are the things that Satan will use the five senses of the body to manipulate and cause human beings to fall into so Paul is saying mortified the members of your body and allow the Holy Spirit to bring them under control of his word amen praise the name of the Lord now I want you to realize that I'm talking about the bride waiting in love for uh the word to confirm the word and when you think about this we can name some names in the Bible quickly and then I'll go to the last stage of this here uh there was Rebecca while she was journeying with the the messenger to get to Isaac she was waiting while traveling she was waiting and waiting in love that what she had believed from being told by elieza she was waiting for that to be confirmed and when she saw him that confirmed it oh my praise God hallelujah and what what about Ruth in the Bible who you know uh she was there working in the field uh so Boaz while he was riding by with his servants uh and just loved him you know the rest of the story and then how he told her that he is going to seek to redeem her and this type of thing and she kept working she didn't stop working she's kept working in the field but she was working and she was waiting and she was watching for the promise that he made to her to be confirmed to be met manifest and Vindicated before all the people what he told her privately was not going to go out publicly everybody was going to see a display of this bride everybody was going to recognize she is the one amen she she was saying she's the one but now we know she is the one not because she said so but God is proving it so that she is the one praise the name of the Lord we can see it also figured out there in job we can see it in Mary and also we can see it now in the select bride praise the Lord but before I finish this sermon it wouldn't be finished unless I touched on what he was really talking about what I am talking about what brother Brandon was talking about when he told a simple beautiful story of that little young lady waiting in love for the coming of the boss's son and he says you know how I love ranching you see he just starts with these nice little stories and they seem like nothing he's just telling a story the boss's son you know and he was the owner of everything as far as I could see he owned all the cattle ranches and everything else like that a cattle in a thousand hills belong to the Lord he said it all belong to him and here he come towards one of the ranches where uh these uh this Foreman had five daughters and then they had their cousin with them for her father was their father's brother but he died and before he died he said well would you take care of my daughter so that daughter was staying with them instead of them caring for her loving her they put her to be like the ugly duckling put her in the kitchen to do all the cleaning all the scrubbing all the pigs tight and we clean out all the dishes to be washed all the clothes to be washed and meanwhile they are there but you know maybe painting their nails and got manicuring themselves and whatever else and looking like that and then they got the news the boss's son was coming right oh my I think the whole world knows Jesus Christ is coming they know he's coming back amen and he's coming back to take a bride Hallelujah so they heard the word the boss's son coming to take a bride oh my goodness they start to dress up even more they start to Manicure even more they start to do every cunning thing they could do to entrap to uh and to entice and to get him into their raps amen praise the name of the Lord say oh my see oh praise God he says in them days you know I lay under a tree and with my pistol on my side when I heard the winds blowing and the sound of a voice said Adam Where Art Thou and I look towards the Stars and I heard one of them old Cowboys Slim from Over the Texas way blowing through a comb covered with a piece of paper and he was blowing down at the cross where my savior died down there for cleansing from sin I cried there to my heart was the blood applied glory to his name he says oh God I pulled that blanket over my face and tried to help myself cause God was walking and looking down those dark Hills amen yes sir so he talked about it and said they heard that he was coming amen and they started to make themselves ready amen there is a Readiness to be made make yourself ready but some have it today make yourself ready by joining a church make yourself ready amen by doing this or doing that hallelujah amen that's not what he requires see you can have oil in your lamp you see you got to have oil in your life just dressing up and saying well we'll build a big nice church will belong to a better church we'll we'll get a pipe organ in that will give us better worship better music we'll get plush seeds to cause the people to be so comfortable oh my this is not what God requires according to his word righteousness is what God requires Hallelujah Jesus Christ amen so all my now these girls thought they could make themselves ready for the coming of this boss's son this young man of course the little cousin she just you know reminds me of a cast off somewhere uh amen she was a beautiful woman she was a nice girl see but she was not even considered right she she was just a relative she wasn't even considered whatsoever now that's the true picture of the bride of Christ today she she's a she's just a relative a croissant amen and they are the ones they believe hallelujah amen oh just there she's not even considered amongst that bunch of interdenominationals oh my so the poor fellow arrived and went to working they didn't know it but he was looking for a wife amen he was sick and tired of seeing these slick City girls amen who stayed around all dolled up all the time hung around bar rooms rode around with the boy that had the best car I rode around with the one who had a Cadillacs and different things he was sick and tired of it and that's why he said I'll go out west and find me a real wife amen I'll hunt me a real girl that will be a real mother to my babies Hallelujah who will not hang out in all kind of sowing circles and and all kinds of societies amen but I'll just be a real mother Hallelujah I wonder if the Lord Jesus will find the real kind of church that he wants or some denomination that knowing he's coming tack a name on themselves calling themselves Church of Jesus Christ no with no oil in their lamps amen they got all the fine frocks all the fine buildings all the niceties that you could think about amen they got the biggest churches the biggest things the biggest this or that but God don't want that do you believe it amen he wants you and I as individuals praise the Lord they may have the best pastors they may have the finest Deacon boards see but he wants you with some oil in your lamp in your life amen some Revelation in you and he is coming to catch that oil and bride away he's coming to catch what the oil and the bride away praise the name of the Lord hallelujah as the as that young man looked upon the scene there what he saw was so disheartening and what Jesus looks upon in this modern world with all these denominations and churches and remember denomination doesn't have to be what we call a denomination it can even be somebody a a group that claims to believe this message and may even have a message name on it but the structure the system the workings of if the control of it the direction of it amen could be completely denominational right so he's talking about that completely in that way hallelujah amen so he was disheartened amen but watch now oh my this boy was watching and he went out to look for them Hallelujah he was looking for something different and then of course he saw this girl which is what I'm getting back to I don't want to go through the entire um story you can look it up you can go through it and hear everything that he said hallelujah amen hallelujah no he met her and when he met her throwing out dishwater right remember it's not dishwater for herself love covers a multitude of sins so she's throwing out the dishwater but it's for the rest of them right so she's throwing out the dishwater and he spoke with her a while and um he asked her are you willing to make yourself ready uh uh to to go with me uh will you wait for me to come back because he I will I will be back at a certain time you see and when you begin to see them trees starting to Bud uh praise the Lord You're With Me Now then you know it's near time for me to come back when them trees start budding right you'll know it's near the time when you come back then I'll be back about Springtime around that time see oh my blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth Hallelujah the boss's son is coming amen hallelujah that's going to be a a great wonderful different day when he comes here on the scene praise God I want you to understand that when this boy spoke to her uh he may not be thinking of it but he made her promises he met that girl certain promises that he would do he says first of all he made the promise I'll marry you sadly he says I'm going to prepare a a big house for you Hallelujah I'm going to get a place for you and then I'm going to come and carry away and take you to that house that I already got prepared for you oh my that's the boss's son now amen praise God hallelujah now remember uh brother sister praise God that all these promises were made now I'll be back one I'll take you away from here I'll build you a home like you have never seen in your life and then I'll take you to it amen I'll build you a real home hallelujah amen hallelujah so she worked with everything she could just to prepare herself and her wedding dress which is a perfect type of the bride of Christ today she got her garments ready Hallelujah now you see she began to display a little bit of that wedding garment and instead of the questions understanding they said why you silly child you mean to think that a man like that would do anything like that for you oh my she said amen he promised the church says amen he promised praise the Lord she's waiting in love amen oh I'm not she said I'm just looking for it amen I'm looking for his promise to be conformed a longing for his promise to come alive amen I'm coming to an ending of this but just give me a break here praise the Lord hallelujah amen you see she worked hard and she struggled just like the bride the bride has made herself ready and many of you may be going through struggles many of us men struggle with this little thing that thing whatever we're struggling but that is all of the whole uh of the whole uh journey and parcel of God that you might prepare and be ready with the wedding dress when he comes Hallelujah the trial of your face worked at patience amen glory to God see now he said I told you they said I told you that you was wrong he ain't coming he ain't coming and if he's coming it's not for you she says I don't care I know I got more time because he said he's coming he'll be here and they just laughed the clock ticked away and then they heard horses galloping Wheels rolling and the old Buckboard stopped amen let me tell you this Gentile dispensation has come to its clothes amen we can already hear the wagon wheels rolling it's moving on back to the Jews we hope we hear the horses galloping the events time the events modern events are being made clear by Vindicated prophecy in this word hallelujah and it's making us more certain than we ever was that the word is fulfilling itself and it's coming to pass amen amen amen the Buckboard stopped all at once it stopped I don't know when time is going to stand still but let me tell you I don't know when eternity eternity not us being Eternal but stepping into fullness of Eternity when time will stop and blend itself right into eternity and you'll cross right over to the other side amen oh praise God she jumped from between the rest of them ran out of that door he jumped out of his Carriage she fell into his arms he said it's all over now honey Amen Let the now he said let them all causing the nominations left them all sitting there looking on Amen and he took her with him oh praise God now listen God's Prophet I know of another great promise a promise this one has got to be

ahead to prepare this house for you that where I am you may be also amen I'm gone and I'm dead I'm coming back to receive you after I got the place prepared says I'm coming back to receive you oh they might say we are going crazy in here but brother to me right now the breaking of this sea is breaking like this under the supernatural thing whatever that is breaking under that Supernatural thing I can almost hear the sound of the clock of time taking itself away and going right into eternity amen I can almost see an angel standing there and saying at the last of the seventh angel message time shall be no more and that little bride will step away from it then hallelujah and fly away into the Arms of Jesus one of these days right into an eternal Realms taken to the father's house oh my let
