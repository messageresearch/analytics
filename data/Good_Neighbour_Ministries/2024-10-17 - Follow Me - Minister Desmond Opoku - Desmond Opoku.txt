can start from uh let's start from 41 then we can understand the story he first founded his own brother Simon and said unto him we have found the Messiah which is being in interpreted the Christ he brought him to Jesus and when Jesus beheld him he said thou are Simon the son of Jonah thou shall be called cifas which is by interpretation a stone and the day following Jesus would go forth to into Galilee and founded filth and said unto him follow me that will be my subject follow me and Philip was in basda and the City of Andrew and Peter Philip founded Nathaniel and said unto him we have found him whom the whom Moses in the law and the prophet did right Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and Nathaniel said unto him can can there any good thing come out from Nazareth Philip said unto him come and see Jesus saw naani coming to him and said unto him behold an Israelite indeed whom is no guy natanian said unto him where knowest thou me Jesus answered and and said unto him before that F called the when thou was under the F tree I saw thee n answered and said unto him brabi Thou Art the Son of God Thou Art the king of Israel Jesus answered and said unto him because I said unto thee I saw thee under the victory beloved D thou thou shall see greater things than these and he said unto to him very very I say unto you Hereafter you shall see Heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the son of man may the Lord add his breing unto his you may be seated Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord before we we start I'm going to give you a little bit about the the trip of Africa I went to Africa for my brother funeral and you know as a a minister you cannot go anywhere say I'm going just do your own your own project or your own thing God is always with you he is the leader wherever he leads you you will go my heart I thought I was thinking when I landed Acra I will go and minister to a certain place but the Lord did not allow me so I stopped and I went to I went to Kumasi the following day for the preparation for the funeral and the things that I need to do I'm doing a little project over there at a at some place so I just went to see those those places there and everything was going well I thank God for that and I encourage anybody if the Lord prays in your heart to to to put your money in use you got to use it one day you're going to benefit for that so that's where that's what I'm doing if I have a letter I always like to put somewhere in the future you're going to yell you going to yell where you were not thinking that you're going to have have something by the time you know God make it increase and you're going to benefit from that you and your family so it's very very important that in Canada here is very tough for you to save money in the bank but if you can do something somewhere do it brother Abraham said if you are working work whatever you doing doing but you have to be ready whenever he comes you're ready to go we don't know when the rer come so you cannot sit down there oh rer is coming so I'm not doing nothing what I get I eat no it doesn't work like that so I'm just doing a little project I went there and check it out and it's it's coming out good I thank God for that amen and then I I went to that after that Sunday I went to church at Kumasi and I met bran there and it was a very wonderful uh meeting we had over there was great after that I went to my village where the funeral was taking place and we did everything and everything was fantastic we have a wonderful weather everybody cry a little bit because we miss him that was my big brother so that is part of the game when you miss somebody you always miss him you know I was very very very very missing cuz he is the one who raised me up I'm number seven he's number two so he's bigger than me way bigger than me he used to just straighten me up with his stick and hands and everything so I do really appreciated him and the same brother that me and brother kfy and brother F went and we pray for him when he had his three Strokes I think two strokes and you couldn't walk he couldn't stand and we pray for him and die God uh raise him up and then walk and from that day the people get after that the people get baptized so God through that God save people hallelujah so everything God has everything in purpose your life everything that comes your way has a purpose has a meaning don't say oh this is mine this no every little whether good or bad or anything God has already ordained you for a special purpose Hallelujah that's why he said follow me Hallelujah if you follow God you will never lose that's the best investment you can ever do in your life Hallelujah glory to God because right now I'm tasting the benefit of God and I always happy it doesn't matter what second comes my way always good Hallelujah I don't say bad or anything is good cuz God will God will make it right at the End Amen I that's why I said Christians we are the happiest people in the face of the Earth you have to be happy you have to enjoy your salvation hallelujah thank you Lord amen and then I I met the some of the people that we we we baptize them and I the some of them go to this church and I went there before I went the church gave me fans to because I I brought something about the building that they doing and the church pastor Danny gave me fans to support that Ministry and I went to meet them and we we went and bought some cement uh my brother can you put the the video I'm going to show you a small video

Danny said whatever you giving don't stop giving whatever you're doing is going to your investment the greatest investment you have ever done to invest in the kingdom of God Christ because everything

nobody couldn't go he became a so sweet Fellowship Hallelujah you know the Bible say when you talk about God you always draw near oh Hallelujah talk about him he didn't tell you to follow him just

you know what seron did Philip had that right away he went and found nael Just Two Words follow me follow me that word alone philli couldn't take it it was so much mean to him Hallelujah that he has to do something he has to do something right away if you if you when we read the word of God when Andrew Andrews saw the Lord Jesus Christ he went and found his brother Peter come and see whom I have found and he explain by the word of God not just say whom I have found the Messiah whom Moses and all the prophets spoke of so that means they were reading the word of God all the time and they were expecting glory to God if this man was not expecting he could not say all the prophets wrote about his life right away everything open to him when you hear this message what open to you that you came have you lost the Zeal that caus you have you lost the confidence that brought you here tonight Hallelujah this word here is not just a word is something special God calls you why he just said follow me why he said follow me because he knew him before the foundation of this world he knows all whom he called and whom he is going to call he know all of them glory to God hallelujah philli obeyed the call when he obeyed the call Jesus said follow me he obeyed the call and follow him and rather was something begin to move inside and he know that this is a special call so he has to find Nathaniel And when he you said he said he said uh said an Israelite whom is no guy what do guy mean the word guy means dishonest deceit he said no guy there's no disness no dishonest inside Nathaniel he was faithful Hallelujah you obey the call you take you obey the call of the Lord Jesus Christ this message that's why you are sitting here tonight so there's something for you to do hallelujah amen thank you Lord are you preparing to do what God has called you for and this call is a special call it's not just something that you going to eat every day no those out there they eat every day God give them every day because they rainfall unjust they rainfall just that's the way it is they rainfall everybody Hallelujah but he call you a special call so you have to search what you need to do for the glory of God he didn't call us to just sit inside the church every Sunday every Tuesday every Wednesday there's a there's more than that hallelujah amen you know what I find we Christians We complain more than the the people out there oh I am sick I get a headache ah oh I have to go to the doctor when he goes to the doctor the doctor said oh brother see this this and that and this and that right you started panicking Christians you startop panicking do you know who you are there's something special you can create you can create your own atmosphere you know last week is this this week yeah

storm a bullet Messa anything you has a power to overcome that Hallelujah you are ESP special people we are peculiar people when you read this Bible here there is not one time you Bible tells you this his Messengers or his followers they say I am sick I don't do that I don't do that no Satan scare of them even Paul De the Bible tell us he was bitten by deadly snake and what did he do hey boy he shake his head and put him on the fire and the people the people that were in the land was looking at him thinking you're going to fall dead Hallelujah glory to God you are invisible Army you are invisible Army praise God what what happened to Paul and Saros these two people let me tell you before any fruit or any food go come out and bear fruit he has to go to ground the seed has to go to ground and the seed doesn't doesn't when you put the seed down it doesn't comes out just like that that seed has to be what rotting then the the the seed the life inside the seed comes out so when you sick don't think that when you SI don't think that you're going to just get up and go Satan will never do let you go you have to claim your right there's nothing that can hold that seat down there if there's a concrete you will pass through and come out you are the seed of God hallelujah nothing is coming to stay on you and distract you you are God's children take your rights and move by the power of God the churches this gospel start from the beginning in the day of Pentecost when they came out there was no fear you know how many people stood there and die for the gospel so that we can sit here hallelujah this gospel is life and nobody can kill life the life belong to God and this life is a special life Hallelujah this just tell follow me and Paul said follow me as I follow Christ if this church does not follow Christ you cannot follow but thank God God has raised us up Hallelujah and now our pastor is leading us through you heard the Sunday service Oh Glory to God let us join together when we join together with one Accord we're going to see things in this church here will get up and walk dead will raise this is in the church this is for you and me for the strength of the body of Christ Hallelujah my brethren this gospel is real when I talk about this gospel with anybody I started shaking because I feel it I feel in my bone I feel in my soul I feel in my hair I feel in every part of my body Hallelujah because when you see Christ how do you think Paul and all of them nothing can take because they see the manifestation of God in front of them they said this and it's that Hallelujah it never change yes Hallelujah if God showed himself the same ministrator we believe right here now this is the bright time what God did through all the messages they saw God face to face but Abraham saw God face to face now the bride of Christ this is our time what do you think we going to see we're going to see the Lord Jesus Christ himself manifesting through us everyone of us whether your child old young whever it doesn't matter whether you speak English broken Spanish Jew uh Arabic anything God here don't think that I don't speak speak your language Hallelujah you think when I I I I go to Africa I ministered to them in in my language I ministered in English whomever I met or I meet I feel God will place in me what I have to do what language they can hear better Oh Glory to God hallelujah oh this go gospel is Tre is seated and honey if you really understand what God is doing right now Hallelujah God is doing Mighty work are you want to be part of that let us work Hallelujah every prayer God hear and when you pray don't think that God didn't hear you don't be like those people when they say they believe but they don't believe here right here like my country so many churches so many Christians but when that that place there Satan work faster than what they think God will do so when they say something he's a Christian you you you steal some somebody's stuff he's a Christian you you steal it you going to come and ask you did it you said no you come maybe three times he's a Christian listen me you you will not do it but them they go to the Witchcraft or the river and curse you within a short time you're going to die no matter what you're going to die let me tell you God is real Satan is real because we know over there how the thing work maybe you never see the other side but we see both side so when I'm here I know what I'm talking about God God is God he's he's he's powerful than any spirit in this world who makes Satan Satan has no power over you Hallelujah stand for your right thank you Jesus see when you pray or anything don't say I didn't get it when Daniel was praying and God was G him the answer giving him the answer Mar has to fought how many days before Daniel has to receive Daniel never wavering he stood on his prayer and his prayer what came to him Hallelujah it doesn't matter what you're praying for it doesn't matter what you believing if your believer your God child stand as a god child don't look like if you going and see somebody sick or Satan is destroying people and they are God people God created them every one of them them is God creation right so I I cannot see Satan tormenting somebody and I was standing there without doing nothing what I do I will go and rebuke him to leave that God property amen cuz everything is God property Satan cannot do nothing he cannot create Hallelujah Satan is a [Applause] destroyer amen God said greater you this even this thing your Marvel you yourself You Phillip you're going to see things F did see he was sleeping and God said go see this man that going there sitting on his Chariot how did how how did he go he just wake up the break of an eye he was

real a blink of an eye he was there on the desert on the desert Hallelujah one day you'll be sleeping by the time you wake you wake up you're in Africa you don't know where you are you preaching glory to God that's the god that we serve Hallelujah say how do I come here God said I brought you here I can't speak the languages who made the language I I am the Lord God who made everything what do you

you fine okay let's go e he was really a real servant of Christ there's a certain old negro sister that came to the church and she was filled with the Holy Ghost and such a great character she was and she had a husband he was a good old fell his name was the called him Gabriel we just called him Gabe for short and so we can never get him to line up at the church he he just didn't want to come to church he said that all the boys down around the pool room where he hung out said that's a bunch of holy rollers and nothing to him and the only thing Gabe had to do was on Sunday morning get his pool queue and go down to the pool room or something and gr around the boys but his wife was a real devout saint and she'd go to the church and she'd pray and have the pastor and all to pray for Gabe because it really down his heart he was a good man and he run a little business down there a little on the corner little shoe shine business and shine shoes get enough money and play pool while he went to play pool so he just didn't want to line up with the gospel and the pastor old Gabe liked to hunt a lot so the pastor was a hunter too so he'd take Gabe and go hunting so one day after a all day tramping through the the Wilderness and the sloes is on the road home that afternoon and and they had so much gain they could just barely tote it had the rabbits and the birds all over them going along and they come around an old familiar path as they come up come up top of the hill and they went down into the little city down there is on Saturday and the sun was going down and the pastor haded to look around he hadn't heard old Gabe say nothing for quite a while and he watched around and Gabe was looking over his shoulders towards the the sun setting as it was going across the Western Horizon and the pastor looked back and he noticed Gabe wasn't standing him looking back as he walked and so the pastor walked on for a few minutes and after while a big black hand laid on his shoulder and when he turned and chist old Gabe was looking him in the face with tears running down his cheeks dripping off like his he says Pastor in the morning use G to find me right up there at that morning's bench so then I was coming right back from there and take a seat to the side of my faithful wife and that is going to remain in that church until God calls me home and the pastor of course turned around in amazement he said Gabe I wanted and waited and long and prayed for years for this he said gab is it sett he said yes Pastor settle but I want that Holy Ghost too and I was coming up the morning as B in the morning and I was going to get it or I was going to die right there he said Gabe I I appreciate this said but I want to ask you something G what sermon did I preach that that inspired you to do this I'd like to know what sermon I preached what I preached on or what hymn did the choir sing that that inspired you to make this great decision game and the old negro looked at the pastor and he said pastor he said I sure appreciate every Su you preached he said I appreciate everything that you said pastor he said and I appreciate every fine hymn the choir saying but said pastor it wasn't that he said you know I was looking at that sun going down y did you know that M your son too is going down the light of our body is leaving that's true it's true here this morning man amen the sun setting setting in your life in mine and it's setting on time in Civilization she's finished and he stands at the door yes knocking longing waiting that little knock something down in your heart that says it's I open up now that's him Gabe had listened to that and he turned around he said another thing Pastor he said you know I'm a bad shot he said I couldn't hit nothing you know I couldn't and just look at here at the game enough to last me and my wife all next week and said you know I can't hit nothing but said he gave it to me said I just happen to think he must love me or he wouldn't be so good to me did you ever realize that in India today the little children i l laying on the street their little belly swelled up their little gums down like this starving to death their
