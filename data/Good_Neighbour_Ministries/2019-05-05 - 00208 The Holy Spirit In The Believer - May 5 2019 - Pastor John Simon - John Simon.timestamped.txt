[2:04] on the lord state - given brains and on
[2:08] HBC them you are welcome here
[2:12] - a good paper of ministries here happy
[2:16] let me love you me in the house of God
[2:20] before we continue with the rest of the
[2:23] service we have the education of baby
[2:36] Jesus Christ and we do have the
[2:41] dedication of this wonderful wonderful
[2:45] me Rebecca and Orin we invite them to
[2:54] come to the front and all friends family
[2:59] members those who wish to identify
[3:02] themselves fit them we certainly welcome
[3:07] you here to take God's grace
[3:20] [Music]
[3:24] we are in the life of the friends family
[4:09] grandparents we know very well brother
[4:13] Desmond and sister Elizabeth
[4:19] we have did all of you here in house of
[4:23] God I see other team player at the night
[4:26] here
[4:26] also to see every one of you
[4:37] anyway we are happy certainly happy and
[4:41] rejoicing to be here in the house of the
[4:45] Lord and we are we are inspired and
[4:50] encouraged that they are still people
[4:53] that will bring their child into for a
[5:00] blessing and to start their life right
[5:05] maybe or roughly run off track and
[5:09] everything else but the Bible says if
[5:11] you start to write even if a strain
[5:15] they'll come right back on track after
[5:17] one and right so I would make that clear
[5:21] here to be that every parent has a part
[5:25] to play
[5:26] we're not here to just print children
[5:29] adopt them to the world and leave them
[5:31] and war ways but we have a part to play
[5:35] with in their life and education or
[5:40] christening is not an epochal event or a
[5:43] bottling the child to the church or to
[5:46] anybody you will have your position as
[5:51] parents once you were just a young man
[5:55] she was just a young woman but with the
[5:59] birth of children you become a father
[6:02] and she becomes a
[6:04] their rule changes these are the
[6:08] changing seasons of life that we all
[6:11] experience
[6:14] now you must recognize that and I throw
[6:18] back your instrument of God for us to
[6:22] bring forth each other and now your
[6:25] instrument of God to raise this child in
[6:30] the fear of God to protect to provide
[6:34] and to train this channel we have our
[6:38] part negatively so you are coach this is
[6:47] not basketball this is not a game it's
[6:50] not a good life that you have in your
[6:53] hand and God has called you all of all
[6:58] the people who were really chose you to
[7:00] be the trainer of this job and the Bible
[7:04] is treatment the child one day young so
[7:08] that when they get older she's paying
[7:10] attention to be here right they were not
[7:15] from the way so really happy for this
[7:18] position I trust that you voluntarily
[7:27] accepted by proportion or because you
[7:32] feel that you have to do it but because
[7:35] it's in your heart
[7:36] amen now the script right coaches in
[7:41] proverbs 22:6 train up a child in the
[7:44] way they should go and when they are old
[7:47] they will not depart from it but if you
[7:52] have a trainer a child the way they
[7:53] should go that means you go away it
[7:57] assumes the fact that you know the way
[8:00] because that's the way you will be able
[8:02] to train
[8:03] the child remember when Jesus was Miss
[8:07] young and and Mary came and said said to
[8:15] him but we were seeking you
[8:18] I had the father was seeking you and
[8:20] turtley was he was a challenge
[8:23] discipline it was God in flesh he said
[8:26] woman not senior who was speaking to us
[8:29] from the chatter speaking how does God
[8:31] speak with truth and same woman so to
[8:34] know I must be about my father's
[8:35] business I've gotta carry out God's
[8:39] business right so you've got to carry on
[8:42] God's business you know and you see
[8:46] Lamberton son's business simplified so
[8:49] this is God in sight and God chose you
[8:53] to be one of his to be able to raise
[8:55] this child for his glory and for his
[8:59] honor
[9:00] now it's a full-time job
[9:03] it's not a part-time job and sometimes
[9:07] going to tax you emotionally and apart
[9:13] because raising a child properly is not
[9:17] cheap it starts from sister baby right
[9:20] up to college and university and I'll
[9:23] tell you right now because
[9:26] have some experience with that it costs
[9:28] a lot of money maybe the Knights wind up
[9:38] the mother and I tried to land there and
[9:42] voila sleep pandemonium child is out
[9:44] there somewhere with their friends they
[9:48] say bye you still wondering what they're
[10:22] sleeping
[10:23] the mother's heart was still tearing and
[10:26] thinking about their child and so the
[10:29] flop think about this job and protect
[10:32] this child in every possible way
[10:37] right that's very important in training
[10:40] the child might be jealous foolishness
[10:43] is bound in the heart of a child but the
[10:47] rod of Correction generated far from him
[10:51] now this is not about time to get to
[10:53] child abuse but we know that we have
[10:59] some direction from our parents and Jews
[11:07] five in middle school and that doctor
[11:11] what is his name is doctor
[11:27] [Music]
[11:35] okay jack some person sees you and this
[12:12] I'm gonna tell you bobak oh my goodness
[12:16] you give me at that school
[12:18] and this good is you call and tell your
[12:20] father that boy that girl does not help
[12:24] you get into school if you only get it
[12:26] again a bunch of wild
[12:43] [Music]
[12:46] training or giving them an outline to
[12:55] live by and yes sir dedication I want to
[13:22] ask you today Orin but if you mess the
[13:28] rapists child is here come good
[13:33] but you remember we best to raise this
[13:37] challenge in the fair job you don't have
[13:40] to know as much as me already got that
[13:44] but you need to know the right way that
[13:52] means that you need to be in some of
[13:55] this book here right
[13:57] praise the Lord very important for you
[14:00] to do that
[14:01] amen hallelujah
[14:04] don't listen to what is that one thing
[14:10] one prophet a number like this up before
[14:14] I formed thee even in your mother's
[14:19] belly I knew and before we came out of
[14:24] the womb I sanctified thee and I
[14:28] ordained thee to be a prophet to the
[14:33] nation's listen to Paul but when please
[14:36] God separated me from my mother's womb
[14:39] and called me by His grace amen
[14:43] hallelujah so God has intentions towards
[14:47] you and towards this child
[14:49] person for you to do your death and the
[14:51] Rays you tell the way he wants you to
[14:54] and the greatness legacy of any child is
[14:57] the memory that they will carry with
[14:59] them throughout life of their models
[15:02] bacon they found out that when they're
[15:04] near hold up in their hands and talking
[15:06] to them I have some of those memories
[15:09] and you say oh the character they can't
[15:13] talk but they did accomplish is there
[15:17] some people like myself that I can
[15:20] remember as far back as when I was
[15:22] treated and when I tell my mother things
[15:25] that when I couldn't hardly talk that I
[15:28] saw and because to me I
[15:34] that's right well I heard you say this
[15:39] is open you know that because even
[15:42] though I couldn't speak
[15:44] they are the tough sponge they start
[15:46] picking the plates in front about the
[15:51] same from them okay Treach what about in
[15:53] front of them all that is very very
[15:56] important but I thought there's a reward
[15:58] for that amen when you do that in the
[16:02] report is regardless at that that when
[16:05] to do that that people reward you in
[16:08] every possible way
[16:10] because when it comes down you say well
[16:13] done thou good thank you sir enter into
[16:17] the joy of your Lord praise the Lord
[16:22] god bless you just leave my hands of the
[16:26] child pray for the charter and then we
[16:29] have a beautiful
[16:30] certificate that we would like to
[16:33] present to you hoping that you will
[16:35] frame it or keep it somewhere so the men
[16:38] inside is older they're not the way
[16:41] she's our fully aware what's happening
[16:43] now but later on you can explain to them
[16:46] that you have been blessed dedicated in
[16:49] the house of God so they are blessed
