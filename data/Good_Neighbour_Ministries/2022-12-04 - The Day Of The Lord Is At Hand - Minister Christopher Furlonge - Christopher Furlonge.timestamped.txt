[42:02] So reading from first Thessalonians 5
[42:05] but of the times and season brethren
[42:10] you have no need that I write unto you
[42:15] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[42:20] day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in
[42:25] the night
[42:27] for when they shall say peace and safety

[43:14] of the night nor of Darkness
[43:18] therefore there's a warning here now
[43:21] therefore let us not sleep as do others
[43:27] but let us watch and be sober
[43:32] for a day that sleep sleep in the night
[43:35] and there that be drunken are Drunken In
[43:39] the Night
[43:41] but let us who are of the day be sober
[43:44] putting on the breast Spirit respite of
[43:49] faith and love and for a helmet the hope
[43:53] of Salvation do you have that hope today

[1:19:05] linen and clean and white for the fine
[1:19:09] linen is the righteousness of the seeds
[1:19:12] man
[1:19:13] we say well brother Chris
[1:19:19] you know a righteous person is not a
[1:19:22] sinless person
[1:19:25] a righteous person is not one that make
[1:19:27] mistakes the one that doesn't make
[1:19:29] mistakes you know they make mistakes
[1:19:32] do you make mistakes
[1:19:34] we all do
[1:19:36] we all do what a righteous person is put
[1:19:40] in their trust in the righteous one
[1:19:44] who forgives them from all their
[1:19:46] mistakes and all their sins
[1:19:48] amen so when they say I am not righteous
[1:19:51] just put your faith put amen hallelujah
[1:19:56] keep confessing your sins in the
[1:19:59] righteous one
[1:20:00] amen he made a provided way for each and
[1:20:04] every single one of us we have no excuse
[1:20:08] the sacrifice has already been delayed
[1:20:11] it's for you now to accept it

[1:20:20] him say Lord forgive us

[1:20:25] Hallelujah and you will become the
[1:20:27] righteous one in the one that paid the
[1:20:30] price for you and I
[1:20:32] Hallelujah
[1:20:34] amen amen and amen
[1:20:37] we have heard it many times
[1:20:40] the secret coming of the Lord the sudden
[1:20:44] going of the church
[1:20:47] what there'll be two in the field one
[1:20:51] taken one left behind
[1:20:54] amen there'll be two in the bed I'll
[1:20:57] take one and leave one showing that the
[1:21:00] coming of the Lord will not just be any
[1:21:03] certain
[1:21:05] location
[1:21:08] not any certain area
[1:21:12] you'll go up in sunset Mountain Diego be
[1:21:15] going to be appearing up there I know we
[1:21:18] all got to gather up there you know one
[1:21:20] time there were people doing that
[1:21:23] I believe in 1971 there's so loud
[1:21:26] everything and I went up sunset Mountain
[1:21:27] and waiting for the coming of the Lord
[1:21:31] so many deceptions for us
[1:21:34] but when you do things without a
[1:21:36] revolution and without a clear
[1:21:38] understanding from God we call that sin
[1:21:42] man so we need to have faith
[1:21:46] Revelation a clear understanding of
[1:21:50] God's word to each and every one of our
[1:21:52] hearts and it's an individual thing
[1:21:56] what is God is showing your brother I'm
[1:21:58] not showing you ways what is showing
[1:22:00] your sister is not showing you for to
[1:22:02] every man is allotted a portion of
[1:22:05] Revelation
[1:22:06] [Music]
[1:22:09] what is what you need God is going to
[1:22:12] give it to you amen amen amen hallelujah
[1:22:15] amen
[1:22:16] praise be to his wonderful name
[1:22:18] Hallelujah
[1:22:20] amen
[1:22:22] Hallelujah
[1:22:23] thank you Lord
[1:22:27] the Rapture or this
[1:22:30] secret catching away is going to be
[1:22:32] Universal
[1:22:34] just as our Prophet taught us
[1:22:36] one place one time the Earth in darkness
[1:22:41] right now in darkness
[1:22:43] maybe
[1:22:45] in the Australia or somewhere the other
[1:22:49] part of the world it may be Darkness
[1:22:52] right now right amen and a prophet
[1:22:54] reminder I say somewhere between I
[1:22:56] believe seven or nine this Rapture is
[1:22:59] going to be
[1:23:01] foreign
[1:23:06] it's going to be some time maybe it's
[1:23:09] for North America maybe for whatever
[1:23:10] amen hallelujah so we can't really just
[1:23:13] put time and date and anything like that
[1:23:17] and location amen it could be a secret
[1:23:20] sudden cutting away remember that
[1:23:25] so it never tell you to to focus your
[1:23:28] attention on time or location you say
[1:23:31] get ready
[1:23:33] be ready at every moment
[1:23:36] Hallelujah
[1:23:39] amen thank you Lord
[1:23:43] praise be to God
[1:23:45] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:23:47] Hallelujah
[1:23:50] now we see
[1:23:52] in the Book of Revelation John was
[1:23:55] transmitted from the Isle of patmas into
[1:23:59] the spirit over in the Lord's Day
[1:24:03] amen so what is the Lord's Day
[1:24:07] is it at 24 hours a day
[1:24:10] you see from my understanding amen and I
[1:24:14] hope and I pray that you may be able to
[1:24:17] catch this I believe the Lord's Day
[1:24:20] is that Eternal day
[1:24:25] because when John went into that day he
[1:24:28] could have seen the past because in the
[1:24:31] present and he could have seen the
[1:24:32] future so it was like a big panoramic
[1:24:36] view he was watching at
[1:24:39] man so he could have seen these things
[1:24:41] and he started to write
[1:24:44] man he could have seen that what was
[1:24:46] being going to be taking place right now
[1:24:49] right now
[1:24:50] right now
[1:24:52] and the Lord tell him he said John
[1:24:54] some things you're gonna have to write
[1:24:56] them
[1:24:57] to warn them right
[1:24:59] and some things you gotta seal it up
[1:25:02] shut it up don't write it
[1:25:05] it's only in that appropriate time and
[1:25:08] season when I want them to know I will
[1:25:10] let them know you know what it is but
[1:25:12] don't let them know
[1:25:15] amen hallelujah
[1:25:17] so I believe that is that day
[1:25:20] the day of the Lord
[1:25:22] amen because man due to sin slipped into
[1:25:26] time
[1:25:27] it was one
[1:25:29] Eternal day then
[1:25:31] but man break that train and we're going
[1:25:34] back to that eternally
[1:25:36] amen hallelujah
[1:25:39] man so that is my understanding how God
[1:25:44] has shown it to me I hope it
[1:25:48] it breaks to you the same way
[1:25:50] Hallelujah
[1:25:52] thank you Lord
[1:25:53] so it's not a personal revelation that I
[1:25:55] receive in and it just things that are
[1:25:58] there that God would be mindful to show
[1:26:02] his people
[1:26:03] man he's the one to interpret it he's
[1:26:06] the one for you to see it man I could be
[1:26:09] speaking uh saying a lot of things here
[1:26:12] amen this morning but he's the one to
[1:26:15] Break It individual to each heart
[1:26:17] amen hallelujah and that's what
[1:26:20] Revelation is a clear understanding of
[1:26:22] the word of God to the individual
[1:26:25] amen hallelujah it's shut up from some
[1:26:28] it's only for those who have eyes to see
[1:26:30] when I see it and he gives you the eyes
[1:26:33] that inside Ayah he's the one who will
[1:26:36] reveal it to you that's how I see it
[1:26:38] amen that's how it is
[1:26:40] praise be to his wonderful name
[1:26:42] Hallelujah
[1:26:44] thank you Lord
[1:26:46] thank you Lord
[1:26:47] this is the day of men men are fighting
[1:26:50] but the day of the Lord will come when
[1:26:53] these kingdoms will become the kingdom
[1:26:56] of the Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ
[1:26:59] because when the Lord was up on Long
[1:27:02] Temptation man when Satan presented all
[1:27:05] the kingdoms of the whole team the Lord
[1:27:08] knows one day he will be his anyhow
[1:27:12] will give it to you because he knew then
[1:27:15] true sin that Satan got hold of them
[1:27:18] amen but you know one day
[1:27:22] he's going to become is going to come
[1:27:25] back to him
[1:27:26] amen because it was forfeited amen man
[1:27:29] gave it over to the Satan amen but the
[1:27:33] Lord knew one day that the kingdoms of
[1:27:36] this world is going to be him praise
[1:27:38] amen hallelujah
[1:27:40] thank you Lord
[1:27:42] praise be to his name amen then there
[1:27:46] will be a great millennium
[1:27:49] the Lord's Day the coming of the Lord
[1:27:52] his judgment that's be that will be the
[1:27:56] Lord's day let me read it again
[1:27:59] Hallelujah
[1:28:01] then there'll be a great millennium
[1:28:04] the Lord's Day
[1:28:06] the day of his coming his judgment
[1:28:10] that will be the Lord's Day
[1:28:14] this is the day of men that's the reason
[1:28:18] they slam you around and do what they
[1:28:22] want with you but there'll be a time
[1:28:24] that they won't do that anymore
[1:28:29] they'll call you now Holy Roller and
[1:28:32] fanatic but there'll be a time when they
[1:28:35] cannot do that anymore they scream and
[1:28:39] wail and fall at your feet amen and when
[1:28:42] we take a look in the Book of Malachi
[1:28:46] four
[1:28:48] you'll walk out on the ashes of the
[1:28:51] wicked
[1:28:54] amen so in Malacca if you read
[1:28:57] if you go through all the scripture
[1:29:00] you'll see we are all the prophets
[1:29:04] from Jeremiah Isaiah Joel and who's here
[1:29:09] all of them were speaking about this day
[1:29:12] the day of the Lord amen hallelujah
[1:29:17] and I'll give you some scriptures later
[1:29:19] on where you can do a little study on
[1:29:23] yourself for yourself amen where all
[1:29:25] these things have been Tiding amen and
[1:29:28] may God give you the understanding for
[1:29:31] it amen so we see in the Book of Malachi
[1:29:34] amen you'll walk out on the ashes after
[1:29:37] they burnt up leave them need a root no
[1:29:40] Branch that's exactly what the Bible
[1:29:43] says the righteous shall walk upon the
[1:29:47] ashes of the wicked
[1:29:49] they'll not be left root a branch
[1:29:52] nothing to come back to they'll be all
[1:29:55] done away with no this is man's day
[1:29:58] man's doing man's work man church but
[1:30:02] the day of the Lord is coming
[1:30:05] amen so that is the day that we are
[1:30:08] speaking about
[1:30:10] that day of the Lord when he is coming
[1:30:12] what when he's coming to do
[1:30:14] man
[1:30:16] first is going to take us out from here
[1:30:19] amen
[1:30:20] the day of judgment
[1:30:23] the day of his coming amen
[1:30:27] that we're speaking about
[1:30:29] men when this world will be unheliated
[1:30:34] and you gonna walk upon the ashes of the
[1:30:39] wicked
[1:30:40] amen hallelujah
[1:30:42] oh it seems crazy to the world
[1:30:45] sure did in all ages it will in this age
[1:30:49] but just wait for that age that is to
[1:30:52] come

[1:30:57] will come
[1:31:00] let us serve him now
[1:31:03] amen
[1:31:04] amen
[1:31:06] that in that day when he comes we will
[1:31:09] be found faithful
[1:31:12] man where do we live or where do we
[1:31:15] sleep
[1:31:16] amen we'll be awaken up at the sound of
[1:31:19] the trumpet and we will rise in the

[1:41:21] other country but they're like they're
[1:41:23] many Trinidad they love to be their wife
[1:41:26] I don't know why

[1:41:30] God of poet is Right upon his wife
[1:41:33] he have an arms and he's gonna take her
[1:41:36] out before
[1:41:38] judgment strike this before that
[1:41:40] Dreadful day of the Lord

[1:41:47] we gotta be prepared
[1:41:50] for God to take us or before that great
[1:41:53] and Dreadful day of the Lord and as

[1:42:47] minister you're kind of a little bit
[1:42:51] not fearful but to mix mingle with

[1:44:21] that they could have understood what he
[1:44:24] was speaking about
