the line or at home sick may the Lord be with you those that are on the way may the Lord bring them in safely to the the house of the Lord because without him we are nothing just imagine when you are blind and there is this heart and you are staying in the outside and you don't know your way then you the heart will burn you really really hard but it will tell you you'll cry out unto the Lord tonight I'm going to speak about Jesus wants all his wife to receive their sight that's the topic brother put up Jesus wants all his wife to receive their sight because without you receiving the sight you cannot fulfill the word of God you will be just going to church and the church will be boring on you even in the message but when you have your sight open by the word by Christ it changes everything Pastor thank you so much so I'm going to speak about Jesus once all his wife to receive their sight so the scripture the lord gave it to me was anyway thanks a little bit cuz you guys have missed me I have missed you sit down a little bit let me tell you about England my trip cuz most of you need to hear it uh you all know I went to England for visiting my brother almost 26 close to 27 years I haven't seen we haven't seen one another and I was there I went to Coventry an area one of the city is in England you that are English or probably know heard about England and know the history you know I went there and while I was there I was saying to myself I wanted to a message Church to visit I contact Brother Philip FR in England City he gave me address but my brother don't want to send me there and I don't know the way too much of uh train maybe I'll got Miss I don't want to get myself tangled up so I have to visit Pentecostal churches and that's what I did but the Lord knew what he was doing while I was there I knew one of my younger brother's son he named him after me has come to England just finished University in Ghana and came to England but I wasn't when I was going I wasn't think I was going to meet him so when I was with my brother I asked of that my brother that my brother son and he says oh okay let me call him for you so he gave a call to him and he came and visit me he was so happy he called me Grandpa that's how in my language when somebody named somebody after you are you said what did you say when somebody says I love you I give my son the same name to you how do you call that I don't know how they call it that like he name him after your name that means you are important to that person so the child came the same like Paul age he came sit talk just talking about back home things then he reached even I have to go lead him to go home then close to the subway he turned to me says Nana what church do you go to what church it's like a strength thing to be like that sh I said he come from Ghana if I says good neighbor he won't know so I have to go blow of the message Church how they call it in Ghana they call it spoken word that's the easy for somebody to know so I said I go spoken word he goes you go spoken word I said yeah he goes you believe brother Abraham I said yeah so you believe the serpent seed I say yeah you believe that Jesus Christ is God I say yeah he says a friend that I used to go to university told me about it and that is the gospel that I love in my heart but I was raised at seven days but I'm seeing that everything brother Braham spoke is the truth I go wow everything is like a I I can't even explain it you I'm just H talking how it came about then he was ready to go pick the train I says okay I have few times so when he went I says no I'm not going to leave this alone I'm here in England and I'm looking like a dog used to go and look for a bone to Cho if the bone has dropped into the dog come close to the dog then the dog don't need to have to go look for the bone to chew so I just called him back he came back again and I tried to test him I want to give him some money he says no no no no I don't need no money I was doing good back home I have my private car I have my business but I'm I'm looking to Future not just to stay in Ghana that's why I came to England I want to school my school and life better than back home so I'm okay I'm okay so he came back when he came we talk then I said I look into my back I have the testimony of the n and I said wow let me give this book to him to go read it that's the holy book book I have in my bag and I gave it to him and he says oh I love reading and brother Philip friend place he give me the church he says you look into today and also he wanted to seriously even today I spoke with him he says he wanted to come to Canada because the job he's doing in England is like looking for old people and going school so Canada is looking for people like that they'll give them immigrants and they will come here with his education he saw it he goes to all the advanced well website so he but he L Canada so he says he told me today he have a pride looking forward to see that if God willing if God want him to be here he going to be here and he told me he's reading the message book he in fact he's looking any chance the chance come for him to go to the messy Church whichever way the Lord want for him he wanted to go in and we Fellowship expain to him a lot of things and he was blowing out of his mind and he says wow that's why I love brother Braham because he preaches the truth and I want to thank the Lord that on passing in England right at least I could see that there's some seed hidden there and the Lord want me to go Jack it so I thank the Lord for that amen and I miss you all but when I came because of the of former Pastor team pension te we have to finish it this is the day I got a chance to come back and preach and share my testimony free with each and every one of you may the Lord bless you now let us look into the word is Luke chapter 18 verse 25 uh 35 that's where I'm going to read That's Luke 2835 and it came to pass okay everybody is ready and it came to pass that as he was coming n onto Jericho a certain blind man said by the way side begging and hearing the multitude passing by he asked what it meant and they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passes by and he cried saying Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and they which were before rebuke him that he should hold his peace but he cried so much there more thou son of David have mercy on me and Jesus stood and command him to be brought unto him and when he was come near he asked him saying what will thou that I shall do unto thee and he said Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith had saved thee and immediately he receiv received his sight and follow him right Jesus didn't tell him follow me right because why the s that were open were spiritual sight the word has open to him amen even though he received his physically side it was spiritual side here tells me that his spiritual side has been open yeah I saw this today his sight and follow him glorifying God and all the people when they saw it give praise to God May the okay let's pray gracious Eternal Father Lord Jesus Lord God With You Lord I am nothing I can't do anything without you father you know this broken voice this oh God my weak points and I can't even say it you know only the heart father I pray for my brothers and sisters that as you have chose me tonight to stand here and bring the word Lord draw nigh and bless my brothers my sisters bless the pastor bless me bless everyone that is hearing your word from outside watching at home Lord bless it we commit all things into your hand in Jesus name amen amen may the Lord add his Blessing please all of you should be seated don't worry tonight I'm not going to keep you long because the heart is so much some of you have work you are tired but don't worry your reward is coming because Jesus has given you a reward he has open your eye already and he's going to give you a reward to come those that are faithful to him you're going to get double reward okay the scripture that we read you saw it the man was blind need help but nobody could help him and sometime that's not the the world we live in today the naturally speaking so many people in the world are what blind the churches so many churches are what blind and Jesus is passing this man has gone to denomination churches for so long none of them could open his eye One Day by his grace a True [Music] Believer he had some no and a True Believer is passing by his way and he says I hear some noise what is this going on the True Believer told him it is Jesus passing by it is Jesus that is passing by as soon as he heard that it is Jesus the Deep deep called to the deep in him rose up because even though he was physically blind the seed was laying down the seed need the word to open up to him and here was the word as soon as they says it is Jesus that seed just come up the seene am Jesus also is the one you can go to church message church for 30 years 40 years 20 years 10 years 5 years by without Jesus passing by your way and you cry out to him if you are a seed that seed will be laying down there but when you cry out unto the Lord when you heard his voice and you cry out let me tell you he will open your spiritual eye and you will be a changed person nobody have to tell you to come to church nobody have to tell you to read brother Braham books I'm bringing it today come on no Pastor have to beg you Pastor Danny don't have to beg you to be in the house of the Lord because you not doing it for him because your eye has been open that is what happened to this man in the Bible Jesus was passing by and he had a True Believer he heard people crying some noise and he heard it spiritually so he called he need help he says who is passing by the True Believer told him oh here is Jesus says what Jesus Jesus I need my sight Lord I need my sight the people even the Believers tell him shut up shut your mouth you making too much noise but the man didn't care he need a sight because he was so Des he has sat down in his heart crippled inside even though the seed was there he was inside but through Jesus passing his way he says he never sees something like that in his life and I want to tell each and every one of you since you ever came to Good Neighbor have you ever seen something like this have you ever apart from you coming coming to contact Good Neighbor Ministry have you ever had the voice of God like this speak to you from Pastor Simon to Pastor Dany to desmon Philip Christopher timia even myself the least one have you heard the voice speak to you like this never a man speak like this man because Jesus Jus when he speak you have to act people don't know that's why you go in the message people are still in the message dragging their feet even they can go good message church but they are dragging their feet because why when Jesus is passing when Jesus is speaking they will open up their heart so that he could speak to them to open their blind spiritual Blind Eye for them to see the word of God making life in their life making way because when God come everything pushes out all fear all sorrow all pain will push out because Jesus is on the scene this is what happened to the blind mind and at this particular hour we know the whole world is in darkness and only the ones that have the light from starting from where the 54 Ministry and going down to the congregation and the 5old ministry is the one that God is flowing through to feed the children of God a lot of people think you can read brother Braham message books you can listen to the tape and stay home and you are okay even some don't believe in listening to the a preacher but let me tell you you need a stor missing to take this Bible and take the prophet message to shape up your life yes sir and place you where you have to be in Christ then you are fit for the job call you to do otherwise my sister my brother mother you will be just walking like the blind mind even though you a seed of God you will be just like a blind mind wow Because Why without the five4 ministry because you need the word to preach in flesh come on without the word preach in flesh you can never receive God in spirit form in reality for your life for this hour thank you brother you have added it for this hour present stage of his ministry sir then he shape you clean you up then let me tell you it takes away the demon Spirits for this hour from your life so that you can do the job that Lord called you for and this is the challenge the people don't want the voice of God Al life for them for today in their life but they want brother Braham voice back there on the tape on the books oh he was a prophet that pill of fire was on his head don't you see that my brother my sister they can tell you ups and down but bring them that brother where do you Fellowship where are you fellowshipping if you believe brother AB Braham brother Abraham himself told us that we need five4 Ministry yes sir and it's in the Bible it's not something is making a up if you don't believe me believe brother Abraham and if you believe brother Abraham brother Abraham message lead you straight back to the Bible in the 54 Ministry yes sir right it's right there teachers evangelist I don't want to mention it it's right in the Bible if you don't believe that let me tell you you are a sinner then you need God because the devil today believe brother Braham don't you know the devil don't believe what brother Braham preach the devil believe it and tremble but putting what brother Braham preached to action putting what brother Braham preached to action it was Christ in brother Abraham so that Christ is still speaking right watch this blind mind the Lord has opened his eye he could have says okay the Lord has open my I am going home hey whoe my eye is open that's it no he recognize he need Fellowship he recognized the word that he has open the word that has opened his eye is continuation and if he want to fully be free he have to follow the word on you have to walk with the word talk with the word receiving strength from the word yes sir and the more he walk with the Lord the more his eye were open and the more you since you came and contact Good Neighbor your eye has been open more and more some of us when we came here we didn't even know the Prophet we didn't even know so many things we know today why because we walk with God like as unique un un or uni walk with God and the Bible says he wasn't that's what we are doing so many call themselves believers they don't want to walk with God they have locked their mind with intellectual like this Bible they study 24 hour preach or even do whatever with it read brother Brown message do whatever they want with but tell them the simple ABC do the ABC God is not asking us to know everything just do the ABC and God will take the rest they don't want to do it but they want the high Mighty things in God but the simplest thing God is asking them they don't want to do it you say why are you saying that I know I Sease it I talk to people I meet people so you can't fool me with that I know some of them you talk they have heighty minded on the prophet message but ABCD come to church will they come no come and receive God word for your day in flesh amen they won't do it they don't want to do it then you want to tell me oh I Mighty tell me if God is in you God War you also he said my word is sweeter in your mouth talking is sweet but it's bitter in your bear do don't you know when you take the word then the word started you eating and the word go down it bring bitterness it brings so much bitterness that if you don't watch it you don't want to come to church come on you come the time you want the time you don't want am I telling the truth or lie if I'm telling the truth praise the Lord amen because I'm know I don't want to speak to Cemetery okay I want to speak with you in reality because I'm not a cemetery preacher if I want Cemetery I live in Woolen we have two sides downtown one on the front one on the back so many dead there I could go stay there and talk to the day I want to talk to our life people because the gospel we have is alive brother Abraham gave us life amen Pastor Simon when he was preaching in this ppet gave us life pastor D take the pulpit on Sunday couldn't you see life was coming look at how the brothers came brother zah Brooks oh my when he stay here and preaching I was watching I was looking everything he was saying do you realize he even didn't take brother Braham book and read it he just b b b b b b b b b b till he finish I says that is brother kofy right there because that's the way the Lord deal with me I saw myself right in brother Isaiah Brook preaching that he preach here you understand because sometime as a man I I'm worried I says Lord why are you with me and I can use your book read this that says don't worry keep it up listen to the T read the best you can just go there I will come and speak to you I I'll speak speak to those that I wanted to speak to don't worry about it and it encouraged me a lot so brothers and sisters the hour is late the time is at hand we know the world is falling apart life is not easy I know how hard it is for you to work and come to the church how hard it is for you to pay the bills how hard it is some of you even your children are not coming H you want to come to church you have to they are giving you oh I'm coming evening I'm coming on your I'm coming and they dragging you to be late don't worry about those things drag yourself to be in the presence of the Lord the word come in flesh and God will reward you thank you Lord I'm not lying I'm telling you the truth yes we that has been in there long we know all this brother this morning tell him if I'm telling lies he has done that long time dragging all the family to be here and sometime even if they are coming they are fighting you they make you look like you are no good don't worry it's a test and that test is proving you because when you come to God you must be try and the try you don't choose the try the try could come from your children your wife your your husband your friends anyhow the Lord know the tribe but all of it drag yourself to the house of the Lord God is calling because his wife some of them I are are not open it's not that the Lord don't wanted to feed them come on the Lord is bringing his word to feed them but they don't want to eat the food they want the ice ice cake you know like a kiss when their mother have a cake for them and the ice on it that's all they want when they get the ice they think that's the end of it no God is saying No this blind man realized the ice cake won't do him nothing all the box that Bing him won't do him nothing you understand so every time Jesus the time he has open his eye wherever Jesus was walking he was following him he was going to church with Jesus today like today he was going to church with who Jesus and who is Jesus the word sir the word preach in flesh if you accept that that's why Jesus said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood very good brother you have no part in me I said my word is sweeter in your mouth but bitter in your belly some people can talk this word better than me power oh left and right but tell them to eat the the the the the blood the blood of Christ ah no I don't want that he look ugly no this look ugly this no it's not bit for me now it's too much big they won't say it but their life shows it so many are hidden in the message like that and God is saying eat my flesh drink my blood when you drink it walk with me don't be afraid I'm not saying come to church 24 hours make you a a True Believer I know sometime family things happen business thing happen sometime Naturally Speaking you can get sick or some distraction but don't make it year after year after year wherever you are watching in the message the hour has come God is saying don't eat only the ice cake you eat the ice on the top of the cake and you leave the cake because he wanted to open your eye you were seed he wanted to take you home the hour has come the Lord wanted to take us home who want to stay in this world the way the world is who want to stay in I went to England when I came all my my body was pain because my brother house was so small they bedroom is that from here to here you put a session there more no chair the room is fill that's what England people are living in most of them the room is so small you can't even do nothing I said what a what a place have I I was even counting the days to get out cuz old building like that there steps go way up like that clamp up you have to like squeeze myself one washroom in the whole house old building Paul says when the British people reach there they have already put those houses they didn't need to build right we don't want to be staying on this well with all kinds of problems okay we don't want to live in this world we think we are sovereing Canada you live here give glory and thanks to the Lord for Canada Canada is a young country and is build nice clean I'm not joking I have seen things and I'm I'm I'm I'm straightforward when I compare and I was telling my brother my house he says oh you live like a football house like those that play soccer in over there they live that kind of house and I says then your brother get for in Canada a poor guy but God by his grace has given me that room I'm going to enjoy it you understand some of us we have houses here we came mean we didn't have it the Lord has given to us so let us give the Lord the praise for that thank you Lord let us rejoice let us pour our heart and Worship the Lord you may say brother Kofi what are you saying let me tell you unless you have travel then you wouldn't know okay when you travel out then you give thanks to What the Lord Has done for you the only thing my my son Paul said England people their train they make Canada train like a trash they have so much train under this way that way left right under right other than that everything we have my brother is beautiful in Canada big houses big nice clean right some of us the Lord has put you in so give him praise give him thanks Give Him worship give him when you come to the house of the Lord let the house rock like a soccer game like a basketball game like a hockey I know Canadians re Canadians love hockey anyway my game is soccer but if you love hockey let the house rock like Canada in hockey when gresy the best hockey guy I know in Canada was gresy when he picked the hockey G stick everybody a proing that's what God want his house to be doesn't matter whether two or three or four or five let me tell you that's why and I I'm I'm straightforward I'm going to say it that's why sometime when I go to my country some area some Corner the Lord does things even I cry because over there when I preach like this with my small preaching like this thinking I don't know nothing here people begin to Rejoice the more they Rejoice the more they pull the gift God comes out and do things for me to see that shocked me Hallelujah I'm telling you the truth my brother my sister God does things it Shock Me Make Me cry I said Lord I cannot do it you know me you didn't give me education why this I can this thing even I can go tell my brothers and sisters what am I going to tell them I'm seeing you do this I'm seeing you do that I'm seeing you do this but you know what I realize the people had pull out come with what I'm saying then God flow out then the spirit of God begin to move healing take place amen people who have finished University with Engineers they come to me Kings they take me to their houses the palace this that that and it buffle my mind I said Lord this place me I'm I'm born as poor as poor as poor can be I couldn't even go here but I know it's you that has done that it's you that make me see that it's you that doing that I cannot go there I know that I'm lying to you none of my family one only one that I know is to go top like that but me no those kinds of people no way so let us if we want to see the power of God let us pour our heart into the word when our pastor is preaching support him W be stand on the pulet support him pull the gift the pastor don't operate the gift the gift is there like L onaro you are tasty God has made you tasty because like I'm coming here God have let me do my part if you don't know I have the whole day I've sit down trying to cry to the Lord Lord what do you want me to bring to your children and and this is what he gave me and as I told you that's why you opened my eye to see the blind mind I couldn't see it before but when I saw it I said wow this not that the blind mind natural eye was open but his spiritual eye was open yes sir then I realized my God what then he is said you know what I want to open all of my children all of my bride around the world I want to open their eye for them to know me I am not God that hide from my children I want to give I gave myself to you I die for you on my Calvary do who do you think I die for it's you and if you love me come to my presence you come come to my presence I'll feed you than I know each and every one of you your heart I know what you want I know what is good for you what is not good for you then I will feed you little by little there that's why I've given you five4 Ministry the word is preached you may not like some of them you may not like Philip style of preaching or Christopher or Tim or or desmon or even the pastor Pastor Dan or myself doesn't matter you didn't choose God chose so you don't have to reject it it's not the style how much they talk or how much they preach listen you go into a house a house have Sanctuary sorry the the PA where you walk in before you go to the hall and before you go to the bedroom before you go into the kitchen before you go into the washroom right the house is not one thing have different places for you to sit into the house or whether it's apartment the same way and so is it with God word even the 54 Ministry he has designed as the way he wants so that maybe coffee will be a small washroom for you to come in the pastor is the big Hall can be one room Christopher one room Desmond one room philli one room then the house make it complete yes sir you understand so if you don't come you know what you are doing you are telling God it's not enough what he has done is not enough but I want to tell you it's enough this blind man as soon as he heard Jesus voice that Jesus is passing I'm going to be finishing in 2 minutes this man didn't hold hold on and says I'm going to shut my mouth sometimes some of us miss our blessing because we don't pull the gift kof don't operate the gift oh let me tell you coffee don't prate the gift I don't have gift to give it to you God I don't know why would God call this boy R sh can read better and put him in the pulpit and says preach you operate the gift so when you come here come here with your gift when I'm preaching pull the gift if you want to see God pull the gift you want to see the healing pull the gift just one stand here pull the gift thank you Lord what you you think we we go some places and we we we we preaching the people have work through is mostly Philip and desmon secretly the people they are sinners they pull the gift they are not Believers and healing how many times thism has stand here and tell you what God has done healings you think is a Lie Is Magic because the people cry out for the gift to operate then God is not desmon going to do a flip or me even Pastor Danny when he go some place and you see gift somebody cry out that's the way God made it you don't cry out you don't get you cry out you cry out and he don't give it to you you don't lose nothing do you lose something you cry out if you are sick you cry out you need job you cry out you you you you are in pain you cry out you cry out cry out cry out sometime people will think oh this brother is crying out too much he shout too much he this too much you don't know leave the person alone let him cry out he's crying so that he could touch God for his need you sit down there you zip your mouth some of them sorry to say they come to church whether it's timia preaching pastor Pastor Danny Pastor Christopher Philip desm myself they make the devil zip their mouth not even one a in how can you get healing you want to see healing then the brothers stand up and talk about healing you going to think this brother is bragging too much bragging on healing healing is a our biscuit come on you want biscuit it's a Biscuit in this message yes sir I'm telling you the truth healing is a biscuit you may say brother K why don't you get healed don't do you know that brother Braham was praying for people getting healed and his eye was still having pain on his eye sometime God will let even me he knows I will cry out to him cry out to him but he have his time he going to deliver me so I'm I'm not worried but I'll cry out I will cry out until the time my time that he has said for me come to pass Hallelujah the blind man cry out yes he did and the Lord says come what do you want me to do for you the Lord even didn't heal him right there he he even put him to a question what do you want me to do for you on is not that his I just puffed off Lord I want to receive my sight so the Lord says receive thy sight thy faith has made thee whole the man I puffed up he didn't go home and cover himself or Rejoice or friends or outside party he followed that voice and I can tell you by the word of the Lord if your eye open you follow that word with all of your heartu with all of your mind with all of your soul yes Lord so that God will get glory in you when God sees like that all the healing all the gifts he can trust you and give it to you because why when he give it to you some of us we don't even want to come to church what about 3:00 you are sleeping and the Lord comes to you and says wake up go to this house so so and so so person is sick go pray for him then you you put a blanket and cover yourself because why you don't want to come to church and you want to see a miracle you can talk how much you want God won't give it to you but when you are serious when which father will give his inheritance to even a son or daughter that is not serious about his way unless you are serious when God opened that man eye let me tell you I believe continue reading the people start rejoicing because that man was what following the Lord working with the word so they see what the Lord Has Done says oh oh my God this man eye has open the word has opened to this man his natural eye open he can see everything so wow this is a wonderful thing is that not what the world is waiting for the world is waiting for that when the word has open to you spiritually you can open up the word to them the and you walking with Jesus let me tell you when I went to England and visit Pentecostal they give me something to talk not nothing about anything was when we were picking the their congregation members they pick me on a car some of them want the car to come and stand right on their door otherwise they not coming to church so when they give me opportunity to talk I talk I says if your eye has been open the driver don't have to come and wait you you will get into the house of the Lord do you know what the next time my brother was going to that church to do something my brother whom I go visit they told him even I didn't go there again even though his wly things this that they told my brother they said my God your brother if he's not a preacher he's so into the word of God [Music] seriously God is my witness my brother came and told me okay that is what you want to be you want to even where you are passing by you're passing by in some areas because you have eat the word so much that the word not just you going to say repent and be baptized in Jesus name or come out from theom no no no no just leave your life go as our pastor has taught us let what God plac in your had that maybe you have seen lat you take wisdom and speak about that and just pass by God will do the rest right when my brother told me I was shocked about it and that is the way God want us to be when your eye is open don't stay back you can how can you stay back Jesus has visited you a sinner a rotting like a pck a Pok or pick and you will stay home no I can't not until my dead bed I said again some of you hear me not until brother kofy dead bed my eye is open I can't even if I close it it can't close it's open that blind mind eye he cannot close it again because the Lord has do what open the eye so all you have to do is to follow the lord all I have to do is to follow what the word in flesh and the word in flesh is what bringing it in the five4 ministry whether I'm preaching I'm not preaching I'll do everything unless I'm not saying 100% that like like that I won't come to church I I'll come to church 100% sometime things happen we are woman being the Lord knows sometime even he want to use you he won't let you come that night let something happen and use you we understand all that but I won't make it like a like some Christians I put it that way Christians God has opened your eye and you still dragging your feet like your eye is not open if your eyes is open whether it's bitter or sweeter or cold you take the word and go forth and God will bless you it's too it's too I think it's time now for me to stop because it's too hot I don't want all of you you to get too much I want you to go home rest we we can't be spiritually spiritually of there and not thinking practicals as our pastor taught us today was very H some of you I respect you all of my brothers and sisters I respect you the higher position the lower whatever God has pred praise you let us all get together and feed on the way in here once I'm here I'm not afraid I'm in a good hand
