Let's all read this together because this is what we believe and this is what we uh we all here for. But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are sleep that you sorrow or not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you, by thus sayaeth the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them return asleep. For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God. And the dead in Christ shall rise first. And we which are alive, we are alive, will be caught up and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. Amen.
