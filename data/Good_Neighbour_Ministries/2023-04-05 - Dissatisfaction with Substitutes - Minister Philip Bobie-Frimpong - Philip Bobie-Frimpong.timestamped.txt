[24:52] don't look at me or you
[24:55] he's the lovely one he's coming in
[24:58] Plainview
[24:59] the people cannot avoid they will
[25:02] manifest whatever is inside of them
[25:04] because the Bible said that every sin
[25:07] shall bring forth after his kind they
[25:10] can hide and do everything but whatever
[25:11] kind in them it's time to manifest amen
[25:15] praise God please be seated
[25:18] and let's have a word of Prayer
[25:21] our gracious Eternal God we thank you
[25:24] for making a way for us to be here
[25:26] rain and thunderstorm and everything but
[25:30] you still by your grace ask me the way
[25:33] for us to be here
[25:35] father God I have nothing to say unless
[25:38] you come and speak to help your children
[25:40] help me to take myself out of the way
[25:43] and speak and bless your children the
[25:46] time they are thinking in the rain to be
[25:48] here oh God you promise you never leave
[25:51] us not forsake us so I believe you're
[25:53] not disappointed but you come and speak
[25:55] to us like in the cool of the evening we
[25:59] thank you and we love you in Jesus name
[26:02] amen
[26:04] praise God hallelujah amen the people
[26:08] managed without taking much time so that
[26:10] we can go have three scriptures it's a
[26:14] Bible study so we're gonna read a little
[26:15] bit more it's Genesis chapter 3 verse 1
[26:18] to 7.
[26:25] Genesis 3 1-7
[26:29] if you finally say Amen
[26:32] now the second was more subtle than any
[26:36] beast of the field which the Lord God
[26:39] had made and instead of the woman he had
[26:43] God said
[26:46] ye shall not eat of every tree of this
[26:49] garden and the woman said on the serpent
[26:52] he may we may eat of the fruit of the
[26:55] Trees of the garden but of the fruit of
[26:59] the truth is in the myths
[27:01] of the garden God has said You shall not
[27:04] eat it
[27:08] shall you touch it lest ye die
[27:11] and the serpents of the woman you shall
[27:14] not surely die see right there he's
[27:16] hiding something and substance the word
[27:18] of God for her
[27:20] for God do not know that in the day you
[27:22] eat thereof then your eyes shall be open
[27:25] it shall be as God's knowing Good and
[27:28] Evil
[27:29] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[27:32] good for food and that it was pleasant
[27:34] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[27:38] make one wise she took of the fruit
[27:41] thereof and did it and gave us one to a
[27:45] husband with her and he did it
[27:49] and the eyes of them both were open and
[27:53] they knew that they were naked and they
[27:56] saw fake leaves together and made
[27:58] themselves apron that's religious spirit
[28:00] and Revelation 3 14-22
[28:08] if you're not gonna read all that
[28:19] and unto the angel of the Church of
[28:22] lordisia write this thing say the amen
[28:24] the faithful and true witness the
[28:28] beginning of the creation of God
[28:31] I know the rest that thou are never cold
[28:37] not hot I would that were cold or hot
[28:43] so then because now I look warm and
[28:45] neither cold nor hot I was PV out of my
[28:48] mouth
[28:49] because that says I'm rich and increase
[28:53] with goods and have need of nothing and
[28:57] no it's not that thou are wretched and
[28:59] miserable
[29:01] and poor and blind and naked
[29:05] I canceled you to buy me of gold tried
[29:08] and fire that that must be rich and with
[29:11] remain that that means be close and that
[29:13] the shame of thy nakedness do not appear
[29:16] and anoint the eyes of the ice ice up
[29:19] that thou may see
[29:21] and as many as I love I rebuke and
[29:24] chasten
[29:25] therefore
[29:28] be zealous and repent
[29:31] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[29:34] any man
[29:35] hear my voice and open the door I will
[29:38] come into them and will support them and
[29:41] heal with me to him that overcome it
[29:43] well I grant to sit with my Throne to
[29:47] mean to me in my throne even as I also
[29:49] overcame and I'm now
[29:52] set down with my father in stone he died
[29:54] and he let him hear what the scripture
[29:56] says the last one then that's it
[29:57] Ephesians 5 23 just once one verse
[30:04] Ephesians 5 23.
[30:06] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 23.
[30:16] for the husband is the head of the wife
[30:18] even as Christ is the head of the church
[30:20] and he is the savior of the body
[30:23] heavenly father bless the reason of your
[30:25] word in Jesus name amen please be seated
[30:29] if I was supposed if that my title
[30:32] tonight is
[30:35] um
[30:36] the bride
[30:39] does not or will not be satisfied or
[30:42] substitute
[30:44] but original word of God
[30:46] amen the bride will always like the
[30:49] original word of God many of us were in
[30:52] denominations and so many places but the
[30:55] weather
[30:56] receiving we are not good enough for us
[30:59] just like that either on the chicken
[31:01] back Barnyard those those who couldn't
[31:05] satisfy them
[31:06] amen so but one day he hear that voice
[31:11] the right voice at the right time
[31:14] man something in him
[31:17] in hell in him who said this is it
[31:20] amen because you might be the amazing
[31:22] world this church that church Methodist
[31:25] when none of them
[31:27] satisfy the soul
[31:29] where the true word of God for the hour
[31:31] that's what the ego will feed on no any
[31:34] other food he can eat uncontaminated
[31:37] food the vulture can eat everything and
[31:40] eat the good and bad but a true Eagle he
[31:43] will not eat any dead food you want the
[31:45] flesh where the Eagles are guarded
[31:52] the Eagles will be there because the
[31:54] Eagles won the first kill
[31:56] the word for Luther will not satisfy him
[31:59] methodists will not satisfy him even the
[32:03] word of Pentecost that's past will not
[32:05] satisfy him they want the present stage
[32:08] of his ministry because this bride of
[32:11] Christ is a different it's a special
[32:13] bride he is going to take up his flight
[32:17] so he needs the right weather the right
[32:19] time to enable him take that flight amen
[32:22] praise God so when you read in the
[32:26] scriptures you realize that
[32:29] Eve
[32:30] the first
[32:32] um The Bride of Adam
[32:35] was deceived by the devil
[32:38] amen and rahbraham says somewhere that
[32:41] Eve was what she was
[32:45] [Music]
[32:45] um
[32:46] she was craving for phds knowledge
[32:50] she did that for the knowledge for
[32:52] wisdom
[32:53] because all that was he was craving for
[32:56] and then
[32:57] one thing is when she recognized him her
[33:01] and the husband
[33:02] recognized that they were naked
[33:05] they tried to what cover themselves
[33:09] and I'm going to read this for a short
[33:11] time the Bible tells us when we've done
[33:14] number one the Bible says that when
[33:17] we've done wrong
[33:19] that we should Purge our souls by the
[33:23] Holy Spirit
[33:24] get down
[33:26] let the Holy Spirit reveal to us that we
[33:28] are done wrong
[33:30] and they stay before him till you die
[33:33] out purging our souls now they have
[33:37] turned around give you a purgatory
[33:40] after you are dead then the priest makes
[33:42] a lot of money to pray you out of
[33:45] purgatory why is Nancy's that's what the
[33:50] canker worm done
[33:51] sure pray out of purgatory caused so
[33:55] many hundred dollars to get his soul
[33:56] prayed out
[33:58] of the Purgatory I want to even
[34:02] find Purgatory in the Bible anything
[34:04] like it
[34:06] there is no such a thing in the Bible
[34:08] but they give them a Purgatory see after
[34:12] you are dead oh yes I know
[34:16] amen
[34:17] Hallelujah so what has happened is that
[34:21] when some people when they do something
[34:24] wrong
[34:25] instead of making things right they try
[34:28] to
[34:29] go around it
[34:32] your sin cannot be covered unless you
[34:35] repent and make things right if you do
[34:39] you've done somebody wrong go to that
[34:41] person make it right before you go to
[34:43] God there's so many people unless the
[34:47] thing is is dealt with is gonna be there
[34:51] all the time
[34:53] so you have to go and make it right and
[34:56] repent I wonder where is there those
[35:00] times repentance people crying before
[35:02] God for their mistakes
[35:04] amen because when the word of God
[35:06] touches your heart it's softens and
[35:09] Mellows the heart the Bible said a
[35:11] contract and a broken spirit I will not
[35:13] despise it's time that we come back to
[35:17] the basis and do things right repent and
[35:21] don't hold grudges forgive one another
[35:24] you have brothers senses he said don't
[35:26] hold anything your heart against anybody
[35:28] regardless of what they have done to you
[35:30] go to them make things right and God
[35:34] will make a way for you because little
[35:37] foxes is spoil the van little things
[35:40] that we don't take care of it grow to be
[35:42] big
[35:43] so anything that you have to deal with
[35:46] you have to deal with it now
[35:48] deal with that situation don't brush it
[35:51] off
[35:52] amen and what other thing that Adam
[35:55] elevates they cover themselves
[35:59] we have a lot of religious covering
[36:02] that people cover themselves on religion
[36:06] they
[36:07] cheat they lie they do everything
[36:10] by the covet of religion and
[36:13] um our Pastor said that it has been
[36:15] coming to this message
[36:17] religious covering I said all kind
[36:20] of mean spirit I hiding in the form of
[36:23] religion amen and they won't try to make
[36:26] things right
[36:28] they won't try to repent because it
[36:31] comes back to the seed
[36:33] amen so we have a lot of religious
[36:36] covering and that Spirit runs all the
[36:39] way from Genesis and went back to
[36:42] um Judas
[36:44] this Same Spirit
[36:46] and Judas was a trustee a church member
[36:50] um the one who takes off the money and
[36:53] he was still stealing God's money
[36:55] you have a lot of people cheating lying
[36:59] doing all kind of mean things but it's
[37:02] still hiding in religion religious
[37:04] Spirits pastor says it goes so bad that
[37:08] he has
[37:09] taking all the money of the of the what
[37:12] of the of the church that when it came
[37:15] for the taxman came to Jesus to pay
[37:18] taxes he didn't bother himself to ask
[37:20] Judas about any money he said go and
[37:23] look for the face a direct face to go
[37:26] and he told them where to go to get a
[37:28] face so that I can get money towards to
[37:31] pay for it and what I'm trying to say
[37:33] tonight Jesus Christ is the same
[37:35] yesterday today and forever whatever you
[37:39] have need of God knows where to find
[37:41] that fish if you have desire in your
[37:45] heart to win souls whoever God has
[37:49] whatever Souls they're gonna pass
[37:51] through you to win a face to God God
[37:54] knows it you have to dedicate yourself
[37:57] you have to ask God to direct you that
[38:00] face that God needs the natural and
[38:03] spiritual face both of them you have to
[38:05] compound to both your natural and
[38:07] spiritual face wherever they are he told
[38:10] Peter where to cast The Net he knows
[38:14] where to cast The Net now will bring you
[38:16] the right face at the right time that
[38:19] will bring results because remember in
[38:21] the book of us nobody just joined the
[38:23] church until God and then so if you
[38:27] sincerely pray and your heart is right
[38:30] God will bring the right face the right
[38:33] job the rightness the right thing he is
[38:37] able he knows where they are
[38:39] you know the Bible said that Elijah
[38:41] prayed earnestly that should not Reign
[38:44] for three and a half years and did not
[38:46] rain he prayed again it rained he said
[38:48] that he was subject to like touching
[38:50] like we are it means that he has
[38:53] mistakes
[38:54] but I didn't look at his fault but he
[38:57] prayed sincerely the angel of God told
[39:00] by Abraham if you'll be sincere nothing
[39:04] can stand before you amen so we have to
[39:07] be sincere we have to be earnest
[39:11] sometimes we have to be desperate
[39:15] we live in a causing life
[39:17] no wonder God's gonna call persecution
[39:20] on the church because the persecution
[39:22] will let you pray more
[39:24] sometimes he allow those things to come
[39:26] to our life the prophet said that when
[39:28] that um that Widow that Elijah
[39:32] um he bake him a cake face
[39:35] that that woman got to a place that was
[39:40] nothing for her to eat
[39:42] and she knew if nothing happens she's
[39:46] going to die with her son
[39:49] she said that that that gets your door
[39:52] somewhere you're gonna your prayers will
[39:54] change
[39:55] because we have causing life
[39:59] that God wants us to what
[40:02] be more sincere
[40:04] he said that the angel terrific can be
[40:06] more sincere
[40:07] just pray endlessly not just five
[40:09] minutes time when you sleep no we got to
[40:13] prayer but I know that we pray all the
[40:15] time a Christian is praying all the time
[40:18] um person that wish a Christian pray
[40:20] everywhere lifting holy hands we know
[40:23] we're praying all the time even your
[40:25] mind your thoughts 24 hours you praying
[40:27] a true bride of Christ but there are
[40:29] certain situations we need to set a time
[40:32] alone with God sometimes God wanted to
[40:35] set a time aside to spend time alone
[40:38] with him
[40:40] so that he will come and confirm and
[40:43] vindicate what you are talking about
[40:46] he will never leave you nor forsake you
[40:49] he's the same yesterday today and
[40:52] forever amen so let's just trust God
[40:57] hey man
[40:59] what I'm trying to say substitute will
[41:02] never make it we did the original thing
[41:06] amen and when I got my knees they
[41:10] covered themselves with their own
[41:12] religion of figurines God said no this
[41:14] was no way you can't even go to the
[41:16] presence of God with your own words
[41:19] with your own ideas he said my first
[41:22] ahead and your thoughts by ways ahead
[41:25] and your ways you got to come by his way
[41:27] it's his own ideas you have to try to
[41:30] your own thoughts and let his thought
[41:32] let the mind of Christ be in you so that
[41:35] God can reveal to you so that he will
[41:38] direct your thoughts he will direct your
[41:40] ways commit your wisdom to God and he
[41:43] will bring it to pass
[41:45] they will give you the desires of your
[41:47] heart
[41:48] let it stress be my way I want God's way
[41:51] to be my way not my own rebate his way
[41:54] that's what the bride of Christ needs
[41:57] amen so they are self-covering religion
[42:00] will not work and God
[42:03] has to kill the first lamp so that the
[42:07] blood of Christ I think let me read you
[42:09] a little bit here
[42:11] um if I can find it
[42:16] verse 239 the restoration of the bright
[42:19] tree
[42:20] now this little canker worm begin to
[42:23] bore himself into the back what did he
[42:27] do he began to take the religion is
[42:30] covering is Doctrine away from it
[42:33] religion is a Doctrine a covering that
[42:36] covers anything that's the reason our
[42:39] religion is taught is blood
[42:41] the blood the life is in the blood
[42:45] that covers the word and the life is in
[42:49] the blood the blood is religion and the
[42:52] life is in the blood is what brings the
[42:55] results while you see
[42:58] it's not covered by fake leaves
[43:01] Adam and you've tried that one time
[43:04] can't do the same thing did you notice
[43:07] that Cain brought some of the botany
[43:10] life too see but it didn't work
[43:13] it didn't work with Adam and Eve and it
[43:16] won't work today
[43:18] when God refused it at the beginning
[43:21] it's refused for eternity
[43:24] man-made Chris and thus will never take
[43:28] it
[43:29] hey my soul your own words to not he has
[43:31] to be what the blood sacrifice and when
[43:36] King
[43:37] was told to bring uh do the sacrifice he
[43:41] did exact same thing
[43:42] he did his own way the Fig Leaf he
[43:45] taught God to accept it but God refused
[43:48] it
[43:49] but Able by revelation
[43:52] offered an excellent sacrifice and God
[43:55] testified of his gift
[43:58] would that Revelation you cannot please
[44:00] God
[44:01] the letter killed by the spirit given
[44:04] life amen because every state must bring
[44:07] forth of his kind somewhere he said that
[44:09] he can't try to do everything but he had
[44:13] a wrong seat on him that wrong State
[44:16] cannot bring a good sacrifice it will
[44:19] not cannot bring better sacrifice it has
[44:22] to be a right seed and with the rising
[44:25] to bring the right sacrifice and God
[44:28] will testify of his gift he sees in you
[44:32] in back of this I used to think
[44:35] what was it that made Peter able to say
[44:39] that blood blood will say that this is
[44:43] it you understand of the Living God what
[44:47] makes them even the woman that the world
[44:49] to recognize that what made all those
[44:52] people act different what was it that
[44:56] came to that Hebrew children and said
[44:58] that even if you perish we'll perish but
[45:01] you're not going to bow down to this and
[45:03] then I became so quiet with the seed of
[45:06] God in them if they have their right
[45:09] seed so it doesn't matter how much
[45:10] persecution they receive brother Abraham
[45:13] and even job when they get the end of
[45:15] the road there was something in them
[45:17] that came up and said that the lord
[45:19] giveth and the Lord taken blessed be the
[45:22] name of those there's something because
[45:23] they have the right thing so no matter
[45:26] how that they're going to be pressurized
[45:28] no matter what will come out to them
[45:30] that rice seed will come up will come
[45:33] forth and say the writing at the right
[45:36] time to bring their right results
[45:38] because it's the seed that matters is
[45:41] there seed oh that's why he said that
[45:43] let all of them grow together they're
[45:46] written the test
[45:48] he will come you don't touch it he'll
[45:50] come and do I say if you try to take
[45:52] that the test away from the original one
[45:55] you're gonna destroy some of the wheat
[45:57] so let them all grow together and I will
[46:01] come and I'll take those that are strong
[46:03] and bend them and take the right one to
[46:06] myself he's the same yesterday today and
[46:09] forever it has to be the right sea that
[46:13] it will break the right results amen
[46:16] praise God God is under for God he's an
[46:19] awesome God he's the same yesterday to
[46:22] them forever he has never lost a battle
[46:25] amen praise our God
[46:28] thank you amen
[46:31] and
[46:32] even the Lord God himself
[46:35] when
[46:37] he gave them example
[46:40] of that animals the blood of the goals
[46:44] and of the
[46:47] sheep and all those things
[46:50] those were substituting means a
[46:53] replacement it was the original blood
[46:57] because human life you all know that is
[47:01] higher than the animal life so even
[47:04] though those animals were good they were
[47:06] good for a certain time up to a certain
[47:08] point it didn't have that and that
[47:12] original thing instead to take them to
[47:14] Eternity it can only do to up to a
[47:16] certain point it wasn't that um what did
[47:20] I say it wasn't that original so he
[47:23] couldn't take this thing from because
[47:25] remember those people when they go back
[47:29] within a year they went back with the
[47:31] same design they are there is no change
[47:34] amen so they were all looking for that
[47:37] Redemption the world looks something is
[47:39] not right we need that original blood
[47:41] who gonna bring that plan how can we get
[47:44] that blood and they look at themselves
[47:46] nobody was worthy Abraham Moses nobody
[47:51] that when the cry went out there was no
[47:53] one
[47:54] holy God himself the original God has to
[47:58] come down in the form of man to fill our
[48:01] infirmities to feel what we are going
[48:04] through to see how his his children sons
[48:08] and daughters are going through and to
[48:10] share that original blood and that blood
[48:13] was said once and for all and when it
[48:16] was said that hell and Grave were
[48:20] defeated
[48:22] yes sir because what Paul said that
[48:25] great where is your stink that was
[48:28] something means that crave death also
[48:31] death was just think death used to sting
[48:33] before that time
[48:34] it was a stinger
[48:36] but when Christ
[48:38] shed his blood
[48:40] death has no single again cannot sing
[48:42] anymore why is this Victory bro it's
[48:45] gone that thing is gone because Christ
[48:49] himself
[48:51] not a second person
[48:53] God that created the entire universe he
[48:57] came and said that original life
[49:01] the original blood
[49:03] so right now you don't have to worry
[49:06] anymore
[49:07] because he was wounded for your
[49:10] transgression
[49:11] he was bruised for your iniquities the
[49:15] chastisement of his peace was upon Him
[49:17] of the stripes you were healed he said I
[49:20] am the Lord God that he left all your
[49:23] disease not some this is all your
[49:26] disease so if you have any sickness just
[49:29] bring you to the altar let God deal with
[49:31] it you have to accept your healing and
[49:34] confess I'm Healed don't look at your
[49:37] circumstance God faith loose beyond what
[49:40] you can even see feel of such Faith goes
[49:44] beyond that feeling it goes beyond that
[49:47] the what you are seeing or what the what
[49:50] the doctor is saying because the doctors
[49:52] remember he is doing the best that he
[49:54] can he go by what his what his
[49:56] instruments tell him but we are dealing
[49:59] with unseen God a God that knows
[50:02] everything and God has that oh man he's
[50:05] just speak one word and everything
[50:07] changed but you can't force God's hands
[50:11] but he come come when he wants to in his
[50:14] own time he can speak change everything
[50:17] amen so we we are so privileged that we
[50:21] have a god like that that lovers and
[50:24] care for us that he shared his blood he
[50:27] said scarcely with any friend who will
[50:29] give his life to his his mother or
[50:31] brother but he came
[50:33] that love is beyond human everybody's
[50:35] compression and share that blood
[50:39] and what that happened
[50:41] all those who died
[50:45] who are in Paradise
[50:47] they were looking for that
[50:49] um job and other right said I know my
[50:51] redeemer liveth even though skin worm
[50:54] destroyed this place despite this but in
[50:57] my flesh I will see God they all saw by
[51:00] The Rapture so they were looking to him
[51:02] and when that thing happened he was able
[51:04] to go and take them all set the captains
[51:07] free and throw their keys from the
[51:09] devil's hand and make him a toothless
[51:12] that's why I love the song that my my
[51:14] son used today I went to enemies camp
[51:16] and I took back what he stole from me
[51:19] Satan I stand under my feet amen
[51:21] whatever that the
[51:23] conqueror's eating God said I will
[51:25] restore said the Lord whatever you have
[51:28] lost it's time for restoration it's time
[51:31] to restore everything because he has
[51:33] promised us he restore everything your
[51:35] faith then the devil tried to eat your
[51:38] faith try to bring things to bring this
[51:40] situation to just make you faithless God
[51:42] said Iris child the faith I won the
[51:45] all-time religion because when that
[51:47] blood of Christ was said he came on that
[51:51] one
[51:52] like 120 in there
[51:54] Pentecost those who waited for him but
[51:57] remember all those substitute spirit
[52:01] just do that Spirit could not go towards
[52:04] Pentecost because they can just come all
[52:08] the way but they can't come to the right
[52:11] to receive the right path the right
[52:13] thing so when the when he came that God
[52:16] himself was coming to dwell inside of
[52:19] them and live his life through them that
[52:21] you that Spirit couldn't get there so it
[52:23] faced with our message that we have all
[52:26] those of judah's spirit all those
[52:29] impersonators they cannot make up the
[52:32] Rapture because the final goal is the
[52:34] rapture we are going to a Rapture the
[52:37] true bride and Seed of God we are
[52:40] growing the Rapture I believe I'm one of
[52:42] them you believe you're one of them amen
[52:45] that those will do that Spirit they can
[52:47] come near it amen so what happened they
[52:50] have Pentecost they receive God multiply
[52:53] himself
[52:54] and even though he multiply himself and
[52:57] he himself
[52:59] said that no one can join unless God
[53:02] lead them and let God permit them to be
[53:05] part
[53:06] after the Pentecost the church grow and
[53:09] grow then we have that Anonymous and the
[53:12] Safari spirit
[53:13] just lying demons
[53:16] because remember God knows everything
[53:19] one time I was telling somebody remember
[53:22] you deal with a Believer you deal with
[53:24] God here
[53:25] you have to be honest because he knows
[53:29] everything you can't hide
[53:31] but they forgot they think that they
[53:34] were going to deceive Peter and the rest
[53:35] because you know when ananias when
[53:39] Barnabas by Revelation he brought all
[53:43] his land everything that he had
[53:45] those people were going to be
[53:47] impersonators then God has not revealed
[53:50] to him what he has to do
[53:51] but he was just following what analyzed
[53:54] with that Revolution so him and his wife
[53:56] conspired
[53:58] to just keep a little portion here and
[54:01] then just go when Peter told him you
[54:03] perished with it before you brought it
[54:05] it was yours so you can just do whatever
[54:07] you have for that so God don't want
[54:10] people who try to hide
[54:13] and see it and try to hide from the
[54:17] people and try to bring all kind of
[54:19] schemes and all those Spirits God wants
[54:22] you to get rid of all that
[54:24] and get rid of that so that God can deal
[54:26] with them Pastor preacher sermon about
[54:28] baptismal fire it's on the day of
[54:31] Pentecost when the fire of God came he
[54:33] said fire what will fire you do it's
[54:36] like to pray with fire going to burn you
[54:38] there's some people they are not ready
[54:41] they have to watch give themselves up so
[54:45] that the fire of God that Pentecost and
[54:47] that baptism fire will burn every trace
[54:50] of sin will burn everything like God so
[54:54] that God can have full prominence and
[54:58] flow through them and do his job this
[55:01] old this corner here I gave you this but
[55:04] this corner is for me this is my
[55:07] sickness oh this is my uh my sickness
[55:10] this my this I am this you're not
[55:13] willing
[55:14] to lay it down
[55:16] so that God will bend that thing
[55:20] and flow through them
[55:23] so what is happening they have all those
[55:26] and a nice spirits
[55:28] and the going here during this doing
[55:31] that where God don't want that spirit
[55:34] he won a Christian that will Allah
[55:36] himself
[55:38] to let God
[55:40] deal with your heart deal with your
[55:42] conscience deal with everything that he
[55:45] have that full preeminence
[55:47] and flow through the bride of Christ
[55:50] and live his life through you again
[55:52] because remember I promise that the
[55:55] words that I do
[55:56] so you also do whilst he was still on
[56:00] his ethnic Ministry couldn't do
[56:01] everything so it's the bride of Christ
[56:03] we are the one to continue that job amen
[56:07] said the weather I do shall you also do
[56:09] when you lay your hands on the stick
[56:11] they shall recover hey man he gave us
[56:14] those Authority those power
[56:16] so when your son your daughter is saying
[56:19] lay your hands on them pray over them
[56:21] you don't have to wait for the team
[56:23] person you can pray first and then
[56:26] you call the group world to enforce the
[56:29] Holy Ghost
[56:30] and first and for all of them because
[56:32] one will cast a thousand two which is
[56:34] two thousand ten thousand so the
[56:36] majority will bring more best you have
[56:38] to go to work you have to pray you have
[56:41] to do the thing and God will do the rest
[56:43] he's the same yesterday today and
[56:47] forever God has never changed amen
[56:52] what am I saying today tonight
[56:54] so
[56:56] is the all-time I read this for quick
[57:02] here
[57:04] yeah I think the same thing okay
[57:08] there's the three verse
[57:11] um paragraph 44 States
[57:15] shall follow them that are believers not
[57:18] make Believers because they may believe
[57:21] us they they don't want to go all the
[57:23] way far
[57:24] they are making believe that's why the
[57:26] description I read he said either you
[57:29] are hot or cold
[57:31] God doesn't want
[57:34] um those who are in between
[57:37] you have to be cold or hot that's why
[57:40] the prophet told is saying that if you
[57:42] will be a bomb I want to be the best
[57:44] bomb be the best of everything you are
[57:47] doing
[57:48] this thing is no time to play
[57:51] it's life and death the thing is just at
[57:55] the end of the I just had a point when
[57:58] you're getting the end of the pyramid is
[58:00] getting smaller and smaller the light
[58:04] feel
[58:05] so a God in you will do it I understand
[58:10] that
[58:11] but you have a path to do is also
[58:14] surrendering heart
[58:16] because some people they are God's
[58:18] children
[58:19] but the problem of it is they don't have
[58:22] the joy of their salvation because of
[58:24] little things is keeping them from to
[58:27] have the job the establishing because he
[58:29] promised that I'll give you what three
[58:32] redemption in three parts but this story
[58:35] and spirit
[58:36] when God delivered God doesn't do a
[58:38] halfway job
[58:40] he delivered him from all aspects all
[58:42] three of them
[58:44] but if you
[58:46] refuse like those tribe that refuse to
[58:49] go over the Jordan
[58:51] is there a choice they refuse to stay
[58:53] there
[58:54] nobody can force you but if you really
[58:57] want he's willing to bring you to that
[59:00] place amen
[59:03] so these things I do you will also do it
[59:07] and vindicate that you are a Believer
[59:10] just the same as the words that I done
[59:13] because the living father lives in me
[59:18] it aren't me
[59:20] that read the work you can do it
[59:23] it's my father
[59:25] and it won't be you during the rest
[59:28] it will be me in you
[59:31] doing the rest see now you're going to
[59:34] all the way otherwise you are going to
[59:36] form what is known to be as a bride
[59:39] see I'll go with you you'll be part of
[59:43] me you'll be my bride
[59:46] my life will be will be in your body
[59:51] just like a husband and wife is one
[59:54] person
[59:55] you and I are going to work to be one at
[59:59] that day
[1:00:00] you know that I am in the father
[1:00:03] the father in me
[1:00:05] and I in you and you in me just love
[1:00:09] that said all that God was he poured
[1:00:11] into what into Christ
[1:00:13] and all that Christ was important to the
[1:00:17] bride so we have all of fullness of
[1:00:20] godliness remember it says that the
[1:00:23] baptism of the um justification gave way
[1:00:27] to sanctification sanctification gave
[1:00:29] way too baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:00:32] the baptism the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:00:34] Ghost himself which is God himself in
[1:00:38] their bride
[1:00:39] riding the trails once more
[1:00:42] he is in the bride right in the tree is
[1:00:45] no more
[1:00:47] um any other person
[1:00:49] um I went to Ghana I didn't even know I
[1:00:51] just I just recently I got it from the
[1:00:53] from the from the tips
[1:00:56] I went there
[1:00:58] and
[1:01:00] I went to preach in a church that God
[1:01:02] helped brother coffee to set up Pastor
[1:01:04] has been there Michael's Church
[1:01:07] whilst I was preaching I was telling
[1:01:10] them I'm not serving a God on the wall
[1:01:13] what good is historical God to me if he
[1:01:15] cannot do anything that he did back then
[1:01:17] he's the same yesterday to them forever
[1:01:20] so I'm not serving a dead God I'm
[1:01:23] serving a living God
[1:01:25] whilst I was talking in that fashion
[1:01:27] all of a sudden I saw commotion
[1:01:30] everybody is going outside the church
[1:01:33] the members were saying they were going
[1:01:35] out because it was a small it's the
[1:01:38] inside situation the church hasn't grown
[1:01:40] yet if it were to be here
[1:01:42] the big things the Dickens will take
[1:01:44] over
[1:01:45] so the Pastor said they should come
[1:01:47] when they came they came with a a boy
[1:01:51] about seven eight years had something
[1:01:54] called conversion it's like like and you
[1:01:58] can see these guys like lifeless
[1:02:01] and then they brought him to me
[1:02:04] and then
[1:02:07] I prayed for him
[1:02:09] it's like nothing happened so
[1:02:11] I told him to put the child somewhere
[1:02:14] and I began to preach but I could see
[1:02:19] I could feel they were looking at the
[1:02:21] child at me so I was in panic something
[1:02:24] came on me and I told them that
[1:02:28] I am not a Healer
[1:02:30] nobody can heal anybody
[1:02:32] only Jesus Christ is the Healer he's the
[1:02:35] same yesterday to them forever and then
[1:02:38] he will do it in his own time he's on
[1:02:41] time God he may not come when you want
[1:02:44] him to be but he'll be there right on
[1:02:46] time so I began to live Jesus Christ
[1:02:48] that and all because all everybody
[1:02:51] attention went on Jesus and I will leave
[1:02:53] Dr Jesus up you lift Jesus up by the
[1:02:56] time we phrase the service a kid who was
[1:02:59] almost lifeless could not drink could
[1:03:02] not do anything he began to drink he
[1:03:05] began to walk he began to run and then
[1:03:08] people came for me to pray for them and
[1:03:10] I didn't understand and then I realized
[1:03:12] that in that situation God did not want
[1:03:15] me to be like the one getting the glory
[1:03:17] because he That Glory belongs to him so
[1:03:20] he permitted that way and then later I
[1:03:23] came I was reading the listening the
[1:03:25] message and Brad Brown was saying that
[1:03:28] so many times when the people come the
[1:03:30] prayer line
[1:03:31] if because like they are looking at to
[1:03:34] him as he's the one doing something but
[1:03:36] when without even the prayer line when
[1:03:38] he's speaking and the people receive it
[1:03:41] without coming top they gave the glory
[1:03:43] to God because they know no man can't
[1:03:46] touch them but God himself touched them
[1:03:50] so it's the same yesterday forever God
[1:03:53] could have done anything well because
[1:03:55] just let me pray and let the guy raise
[1:03:57] up and then give him glory but in that
[1:03:59] situation he chose for me to let the
[1:04:02] people put their faith in Christ so that
[1:04:06] in future when they get into situation
[1:04:08] they will call on that God
[1:04:12] come on the scene
[1:04:14] and heal them he is the same yesterday
[1:04:18] today and forever amen praise God
[1:04:22] hallelujah
[1:04:24] so what am I saying that
[1:04:27] sanctification gave way to baptist the
[1:04:30] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the Baptist
[1:04:32] great word the Holy Ghost himself so now
[1:04:36] is Christ
[1:04:38] himself riding the trail is no more
[1:04:43] anybody's hand
[1:04:45] is Christ during the works again amen
[1:04:50] Hallelujah
[1:04:52] I'm gonna read this um it's in there I
[1:04:54] pick up my pen to write
[1:04:57] this one is the spoken word he will now
[1:05:00] here's what I'm trying to say to you the
[1:05:02] law of reproduction bring forth
[1:05:05] of its kind Genesis 1 living this life
[1:05:09] is the true church bright Comes The
[1:05:12] Headstone
[1:05:13] will be a super Church
[1:05:16] a super race
[1:05:17] as the nearest the great headstone
[1:05:21] there will be much
[1:05:41] foreign
[1:05:48] foreign
[1:06:26] but before he could marry her she had
[1:06:29] fallen answers for she was put to bring
[1:06:33] more ideas like Adam's wife was to
[1:06:36] believe God's pray the release or doubt
[1:06:39] it and died
[1:06:40] then from a little group of Truth
[1:06:46] is
[1:06:50] version of his way and through them
[1:06:54] and by them
[1:06:56] will be fulfilled all that has been
[1:06:59] promised for instance in the Virgin who
[1:07:02] knows no man Chris or government in
[1:07:05] other words
[1:07:06] today is the last time
[1:07:09] this is the one that will not see the
[1:07:13] first one still this was Christ will
[1:07:16] never fall because if Christ uniting
[1:07:19] himself with his children
[1:07:21] if you read Jerusalem Post
[1:07:24] you realize that
[1:07:26] now
[1:07:28] Saudi Arabia
[1:07:30] China has
[1:07:31] Saudi Arabia used to be on Locker heads
[1:07:33] with Iran
[1:07:35] China has United them now Syria is going
[1:07:39] to have to also emperor in Saudi Arabia
[1:07:44] they're all United remember
[1:07:47] before the Lord Jesus Christ died
[1:07:50] all those people they have a different
[1:07:53] belief or system for our system that it
[1:07:57] all became one and persecuted away
[1:07:59] but now what is happening
[1:08:02] it seems like all those Arabs they were
[1:08:04] fighting
[1:08:06] is that right but now they're all United
[1:08:12] to fight Israel
[1:08:15] and the bride of Christ is the same
[1:08:18] thing going on
[1:08:31] but don't worry because if Christ
[1:08:35] uniting himself with his body
[1:08:39] it's no more the individual life is you
[1:08:43] the hope of God for all that was in God
[1:08:51] it's not Churches United to be one
[1:08:54] that's the man-made priest
[1:08:57] but this Union is already taking place
[1:09:01] amen because you have that spirit of God
