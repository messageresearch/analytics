[0:09] the house of the Lord that we're going
[0:12] to read this morning from The Book of
[0:13] Psalms chapter 8. it says O Lord our
[0:19] Lord how excellent is thy name in all
[0:22] the Earth
[0:23] who has set thy Glory above the heavens
[0:26] out of the mouth of babes and sucklings
[0:30] has thou ordained be because of thine
[0:33] enemies that thou might is still the
[0:35] enemy and the Avenger
[0:38] when I consider thy Heavens the work of
[0:41] thy fingers the moon and the stars which
[0:44] thou has ordained
[0:45] what is man that thou art mindful of him
[0:48] and the son of man that thou visiteth
[0:51] him for thou has made him a little lower
[0:54] than the angels and has crowned him with
[0:57] Glory and Honor Thou made us hymn to
[1:01] have dominion over the works of thine
[1:03] hands thou has put all things under his
[1:06] feet
[1:07] all sheep and oxen yea and the beasts of
[1:11] the field the fowl of the air the fish
[1:14] of the sea and whatsoever passeth
[1:17] through the paths of the Seas O Lord our
[1:21] Lord how excellent
[1:23] is thy name
[1:25] How great is our God
[1:27] how great how wonderful it is that we
[1:30] should have the privilege of assembling
[1:33] ourselves together
[1:34] and like Precious Faith this morning to
[1:37] receive his wonderful word God bless you

[8:19] to me and I kind of Lord was
[8:21] fellowshipping with me with this Matthew
[8:23] 6 34 it says take no thought
[8:26] for the moral very popular scripture for
[8:29] tomorrow shall be taught take thought of
[8:31] itself sufficient unto the day but I
[8:33] like the
[8:34] the Amplified version it says so do not
[8:36] worry about tomorrow
[8:39] for tomorrow will worry about itself
[8:40] each day has enough trouble of his own
[8:44] and if we go back a little bit before
[8:48] that he talked about
[8:51] seek first
[8:53] because the worry
[8:56] we spend time worrying about the past
[8:59] the present and the future but he said
[9:01] worship instead of worry he said seek
[9:05] first the kingdom of God and everything
[9:06] else will be granted unto you so this
[9:09] morning we don't know we don't come in

[38:09] bless you praise the Lord God bless
[38:12] every one of you uh let's look to the
[38:15] word of God
[38:17] and we'll look to Matthew chapter
[38:23] one I believe
[38:30] versus Verse 18
[38:36] reading from Verse 18 Matthew chapter 1
[38:40] reading from Verse 18 to 21.
[38:48] just before me read let us pray our
[38:51] gracious father
[38:53] before us lays the open book
[38:57] we ask that the great holy spirit will
[39:00] come and minister to us from the word of
[39:05] God
[39:06] feeding us the bread of life
[39:09] bless us
[39:11] Quicken us wake us up
[39:15] stir our hearts
[39:17] Grant o God will experience the pull
[39:21] and may you receive all the glory and
[39:25] the praise what a supernatural Time Lord
[39:29] what a great day we are living in
[39:33] May you father come on the scene take
[39:37] and interpret your own word that we
[39:40] might go and be what you want us to be
[39:44] in our rightful position for the age
[39:47] till you be the glory the honor and the
[39:50] praise in Jesus name amen and amen
[39:54] praise God Matthew
[39:57] 1 18.
[40:00] now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[40:05] this wise
[40:07] when as his mother
[40:10] Mary was espoused to Joseph
[40:14] before they came together
[40:17] she was found with child of the Holy
[40:22] Ghost
[40:23] then Joseph her husband
[40:27] just man and not willing to make to make
[40:31] her a public example
[40:33] was minded to put her away
[40:37] privily or privately
[40:40] but while he talked on those things
[40:44] behold the angel of the Lord appeared
[40:47] unto him in a dream saying
[40:50] Joseph
[40:51] thou son of David fear not
[40:55] to take unto thee Mary thy wife
[40:59] for that which is conceived in her
[41:02] is of the Holy Ghost
[41:06] that is what we are taking for a subject
[41:09] conceived by the Holy Ghost
[41:12] and may the Holy Spirit bless us all
[41:15] together please be seated
[41:21] amen
[41:25] now of course uh
[41:28] conceived by the Holy Ghost
[41:30] one would think that
[41:34] um you know
[41:35] that's when Jesus really began
[41:39] but Jesus Christ didn't begin there
[41:43] you see the body whom we call our no as
[41:48] Jesus the lamb
[41:51] he began right there in the terms of
[41:56] being conceived but we will go into this
[42:00] as we talk about it and to do that I
[42:04] must go back on what some of what I have
[42:07] previously taught on last year and some
[42:12] of it will come back to you while I'm
[42:15] continuing to speak here today by the
[42:19] grace of God
[42:21] now we understand therefore that
[42:25] um the body was just a human body that
[42:29] God created and used Mary to bring it on
[42:33] the scene
[42:34] but the the person of God himself
[42:39] was the one that indwelt that Temple
[42:42] for God was in Christ
[42:45] the Bible tells us that the Bible tells
[42:47] us the word was made flesh and dwelt
[42:51] Among Us and other scriptures but it's
[42:54] showing you there that he was both human
[42:57] but at the same time he was all God a
[43:03] theologian would say he was very God and
[43:06] that's you know all that sort of talk
[43:09] but he was all God completely God and
[43:13] completely man amen now praise God now
[43:19] in the Bible Genesis 1 the Bible tells
[43:23] us that God created Adam and when he
[43:28] created him he breathed the bread of
[43:31] life in him and he became a living soul
[43:35] now we know that when God said he became
[43:40] a living soul
[43:41] that did not mean that when God breathed
[43:46] in him at that time that it was eternal
[43:49] life
[43:51] that God breeded into him at that time
[43:55] right see because Adam was really
[43:59] already
[44:00] eternal
[44:02] but now this shape or form that was made
[44:08] you see
[44:10] um that shape or form
[44:12] that had to have natural life
[44:17] so when God breeded that was not uh
[44:23] eternal life because Adam was already
[44:27] eternal
[44:28] so this was just natural Life coming to
[44:32] him now if you can think ahead of me you
[44:34] will see when Jesus breathed on them
[44:37] Iran said receiving the Holy Ghost
[44:40] that's not when they actually received
[44:44] the Holy Ghost they received the promise
[44:46] there they got it under their Pentecost
[44:50] but we are not talking about that right
[44:53] now right so we find out as we've spoken
[44:57] before uh Genesis 1
[45:00] God created one man
[45:03] in his own image
[45:06] and in his likeness
[45:09] is that right
[45:10] okay so God's image God being a spirit
[45:15] and he made it making that man in His
[45:18] image
[45:19] it was a spirit man
[45:21] that God made in his own image right
[45:26] okay so here's the spirit man but then
[45:30] later on he says and there was no man to
[45:33] till the soil
[45:34] there was no man to keep the garden
[45:37] there was nobody to take care of
[45:40] anything
[45:41] and then Genesis 2
[45:44] I think it's verse 7 where he says and
[45:48] then God formed man of the Dust of the
[45:52] Earth
[45:54] and when he formed this man of the Dust
[45:57] of the Earth
[45:59] then the spirit man now had a house or
[46:06] there was now a body
[46:09] that the spirit man could inhabit
[46:13] now that body body had Natural Life
[46:16] but the spirit man could now manifest
[46:20] through that body
[46:22] and he could Now kill the soil and do
[46:26] whatever purpose or plan God had for him
[46:31] amen praise God so that Natural Body
[46:36] formed
[46:38] and having in it Natural Life
[46:41] see in there and there it was we saw
[46:45] there was Adam
[46:48] the spirit man
[46:50] Adam
[46:52] a natural man that was formed
[46:55] but it wasn't let's say two different
[46:59] atoms
[47:01] it was just him
[47:04] right it was just him but we'll go right
[47:07] into this later and we'll see here let's
[47:09] go to the word of God Amen Now power to
[47:13] transform God's power to transform
[47:17] now he created by his word for he sent
[47:22] his word see
[47:24] and by that bless all them seeds he had
[47:29] placed upon the Earth
[47:31] amen now we're talking about you see
[47:35] natural type spiritual
[47:37] so when we're talking about all the
[47:39] seeds it's not just all those natural
[47:41] seeds you you before we used to think
[47:44] that God just planted the garden and
[47:47] those seeds he's talking also about the
[47:49] spiritual seed right that uh they came
[47:54] forth by the word
[47:57] and when they came forth by the word so
[48:01] all the seeds he placed upon the Earth
[48:05] thank God I'm glad God blessed all the
[48:09] seeds on the earth here
[48:11] and in this stage I thank God for his
[48:14] seed that he has placed in this
[48:17] particular age praise God hallelujah now
[48:21] go back to Adam the spirit man was not
[48:25] visible
[48:27] the spirit man could not be seen
[48:31] he could not be touched he could not be
[48:33] felt
[48:34] but when he got into the natural man
[48:39] then he could be touched seeing felt and
[48:43] heard right and then here he is uh still
[48:48] a spirit man
[48:49] but now he's come under the limitations
[48:52] of a human body
[48:55] and he's got to live under those
[48:57] restrictions
[48:59] of that human body that he was living in
[49:05] praise God thought the Bible says this
[49:08] natural man God breathed on him and he
[49:12] become a living soul that is to say like
[49:17] when the Titanic went down they said so
[49:20] 300 or a thousand or well many Souls
[49:23] were lost a plane goes down they say so
[49:26] many Souls it does not mean that
[49:30] um he the soul was dead and it come
[49:33] alive or or something like that he's
[49:36] just telling you that he became a living
[49:38] person
[49:40] Adam now can be considered a living
[49:43] person right now all the seeds that he
[49:48] had placed upon the Earth
[49:50] he formed the seeds by his word
[49:56] for there was nothing else to make the
[50:00] seed out of
[50:03] you seeing there now
[50:04] there was nothing for him to make these
[50:08] seeds out of
[50:10] therefore those seeds are a part of
[50:13] himself
[50:14] the seeds that he sent down here are a
[50:18] part of him because there was nothing
[50:20] else because he was Elohim praise the
[50:23] Lord I'm a kind of teaching today not
[50:26] preaching like last week but you see
[50:30] being God Elohim the self-existent one
[50:35] nothing else is there so out of himself
[50:41] these seeds came forth praise God
[50:45] hallelujah amen look so we see therefore
[50:50] this Mighty God hallelujah is doing this
[50:54] so you must recognize the difference
[50:56] between the seed and the ground and the
[50:58] seed in your heart
[51:00] but there's not much difference because
[51:03] one is in the natural ground and the
[51:05] other one is in the human flesh which is
[51:07] nothing but the dust of the earth and
[51:10] also ground too so when he talks about
[51:13] the sore went forth to sow and and so on
[51:16] you can understand how he planted those
[51:20] those seeds that's what he was talking
[51:22] about how spiritually he planted those
[51:25] seeds upon the earth now when he did
[51:29] that
[51:31] there was nothing else to make
[51:34] them seeds out of
[51:36] amen nothing else you see
[51:39] just himself was there praise God so you
[51:43] hear us over and over saying you are a
[51:45] part of God
[51:47] you're a part of him but you're only now
[51:50] revealed on this Earth
[51:53] you only now come to manifestation for
[51:57] this is the age of your manifestation
[52:03] or let me say it this way uh this is the
[52:06] edge
[52:06] for you to know what you need to know
[52:09] and in the time when you need to know it
[52:12] so the word itself coming to life being
[52:17] activated by the Holy Spirit praise the
[52:21] name of the Lord so there was nothing
[52:24] else to make that seed out of the seed
[52:26] out of
[52:28] and he placed them
[52:30] amen
[52:32] and they were
[52:34] hit like beneath the waters
[52:37] amen and when the time came he just
[52:41] began to speak and say Let There be let
[52:46] there be I kind of believe our time has
[52:49] come
[52:50] when the same holy spirit is saying let
[52:55] there be let there be let there be in
[52:59] other words come forth
[53:02] come fork and the spirit begins to call
[53:06] amen and them seeds started to come to
[53:10] life amen praise God hallelujah now we
[53:15] find out many times it looks like the
[53:18] Bible is just repeating itself
[53:21] I see and like it's even uh saying
[53:26] something that it that doesn't seem to
[53:29] say in other words we understand it a
[53:32] different way like how we read about the
[53:34] first Adam and we read about Adam is
[53:35] like you Adam created twice uh you see
[53:39] but that's not what it is if God has to
[53:42] reveal that to you
[53:44] amen for instance in the Genesis 1
[53:49] if we find God created man in his own
[53:54] image
[53:55] in the image of God created he him
[53:58] male and female created he them amen and
[54:04] then he goes on to talk about the other
[54:06] things he created then we come to find
[54:09] out
[54:11] Genesis 2 there was no man to tell the
[54:14] soil he's just showing you how people
[54:16] can misunderstand the scriptures and the
[54:19] Bible repeats itself and it looks like
[54:21] it's contradicting but it's not
[54:23] contradicting it's talking about a
[54:26] spiritual man or a spirit man and a not
[54:28] true man amen praise God for there was
[54:33] no man to kill the soil
[54:35] then God created
[54:39] The Man Out of the Dust of the Earth
[54:42] you see now praise God so he says now
[54:47] that's what God did he created the
[54:50] spirit man first then the natural man
[54:52] now uh my if you can apply this yourself
[54:55] you will understand that part of the
[54:58] gene that was in you was always there
[55:01] all the time but the age in which you
[55:04] were to be born and to come and then he
[55:07] has to come about and bring about a
[55:10] union of that life praise God so that it
[55:15] could come forth in the age when it's
[55:17] supposed to come forth and to live and
[55:20] to perform his will
[55:22] not by putting on religious just being
[55:25] yourself
[55:27] and let the Holy Spirit work his will
[55:29] through you
[55:31] amen you don't have to get super
[55:33] spiritual you don't have to know
[55:35] anything you don't have to know all as
[55:37] we claim the message you don't have to
[55:40] be aware of every court you don't have
[55:43] to know this not that you need to just
[55:45] know him
[55:47] and you need to recognize Who You Are
[55:50] you need to recognize your purpose here
[55:53] to express God to be available for him
[55:57] to use in this age
[55:59] vessels set apart by the holy spirit
[56:02] that he can use it for his glory and for
[56:05] his honor amen praise the name of the
[56:08] Lord hallelujah amen so we understand
[56:13] he's formed that uh first one by the
[56:17] spirit
[56:18] which was the first man and the second
[56:22] man
[56:23] he formed from the dust praise the Lord
[56:26] Genesis 2 7 amen praise God so man
[56:32] formed from himself
[56:33] and man the other man formed from the
[56:37] dust of the Earth
[56:39] praise God now we see coming from the
[56:42] dust of the Earth let me pause here you
[56:45] remember when God gave Abraham a promise
[56:48] and said I'm gonna take your seeds or
[56:51] your seed that they're going to be
[56:53] without number and I'll take them from
[56:56] the dust to the Stars
[56:59] right I can use the word back to the
[57:01] stars because that's what he was talking
[57:03] about I formed them or I put them into
[57:06] flesh I put them into bodies but after
[57:10] their purpose is done I'm gonna take
[57:12] them out and take them back where they
[57:15] come from
[57:16] praise God take them back where they
[57:19] come from praise the Lord now he
[57:23] breathed
[57:24] they
[57:26] Spirit of life
[57:28] Breath of Life I'm quoting brother
[57:31] Brandon here what he how he said it into
[57:34] him see not not eternal life
[57:39] natural life life to your flesh or to
[57:45] your body praise God because the other
[57:47] man is already Eternal praise God so he
[57:51] breathed in the spirit of life into him
[57:54] and he became a living soul
[57:58] a living person as I explained uh before
[58:03] Hallelujah for God John 4 says God is a
[58:07] spirit
[58:08] and there that worship Him must worship
[58:11] Him in spirit and in truth
[58:13] praise the Lord now see the first man
[58:18] then that he created we must understand
[58:21] he was a spirit man in the image of God
[58:27] right there it was in the image and in
[58:31] the likeness of God right then he took
[58:36] that man and put that man in the flesh
[58:40] form that he created
[58:42] amen praise God hallelujah so you
[58:45] understand we we come
[58:49] Eternal but in each age so many he has
[58:52] gonna come forth and he formed you
[58:56] praise the Lord praise God I don't want
[58:59] to run ahead of myself praise the Lord
[59:01] amen so we see then
[59:05] he became a living Soul continuing God's
[59:09] power to transform now because the great
[59:14] Creator had just sent forth his word
[59:19] and saw the word seed was now there
[59:23] praise God hallelujah praise the Lord
[59:27] amen now this is just letting you know
[59:31] what's there before the natural seed was
[59:35] formed the word seed was already there
[59:39] waiting
[59:40] praise the Lord just the same with us
[59:44] before your body was formed praise God
[59:49] not by God himself back there forming
[59:53] Adam but because of sin God ought to use
[59:58] a woman to do the farming
[1:00:01] amen
[1:00:03] and before that was formed their Eternal
[1:00:09] part the gene the charm the seed word of
[1:00:13] God was already there waiting for that
[1:00:16] body to be formed
[1:00:18] hallelujah praise be to God Amen oh my
[1:00:23] see let me repeat this quote because the
[1:00:27] great Creator had sent forth his word
[1:00:31] and the word seed was there
[1:00:35] Hallelujah therefore we know that before
[1:00:40] the real sea the natural seed was ever
[1:00:44] formed the word seed was there waiting
[1:00:48] amen the word seed was already there
[1:00:50] waiting for the other part of it to be
[1:00:53] formed because every seed as he
[1:00:56] explained later on has a germ of life
[1:00:59] that you can't see in it
[1:01:03] that natural seed has a pulp around it
[1:01:08] but it's not the pulp it's the life
[1:01:11] that's in there that gives all of that
[1:01:13] something that it can live and move by
[1:01:16] amen praise the Lord see now praise God
[1:01:20] so we understand that God is like that
[1:01:25] amen praise God now when God speaks the
[1:01:30] word
[1:01:31] that's when the Holy Ghost comes down
[1:01:35] and he comes down to do what to Quicken
[1:01:38] the world
[1:01:39] he comes down to Quicken the word praise
[1:01:42] the Lord or breathe the Breath of Life
[1:01:44] on the word praise God so that that word
[1:01:48] could come to life amen praise God the
[1:01:52] same without us here today as I'm
[1:01:54] preaching the word the Holy Spirit comes
[1:01:57] on the scene and he begins to breathe
[1:02:01] the Breath of Life
[1:02:03] over the entire congregation
[1:02:06] to bring to life any seed of God that is
[1:02:10] not yet woke up the spirit of God just
[1:02:13] begins to breathe the Breath of Life
[1:02:16] the scripture just came to me like a
[1:02:19] hand that's just over her chickens
[1:02:22] waiting for them to come forth praise
[1:02:24] God offer them eggs waiting for for them
[1:02:28] to be born praise God and to come to
[1:02:31] life for the glory of God hallelujah
[1:02:33] amen so we find out that God formed a
[1:02:39] natural seed around this Supernatural
[1:02:43] word seed
[1:02:45] he just formed a natural seed around
[1:02:48] that amen and so the germ of Life lay in
[1:02:54] that natural seed and it has to lay
[1:02:57] there and wait
[1:03:00] until God says let there be life
[1:03:06] or let every seed now come forth
[1:03:09] and let it begin to bring forth after
[1:03:13] its kind is that right so we see
[1:03:16] therefore
[1:03:18] in you even while you are a sinner there
[1:03:22] was The Germ of life in US
[1:03:25] waiting on the correct season
[1:03:29] waiting on the time when God plans for
[1:03:32] it to comfort
[1:03:34] listen it's got nothing to do with the
[1:03:37] day when you recognize
[1:03:40] each one recognizes in their time
[1:03:45] by God's perfect will
[1:03:48] God can have you sitting for 40 years
[1:03:51] under the influence of the message and
[1:03:54] you'll never recognized
[1:03:56] but when the hour comes the Holy Spirit
[1:04:00] speaks the word breeds the breath of
[1:04:03] life and that seed comes to life by his
[1:04:06] grace and by his will
[1:04:08] amen that's why we don't push pull tug
[1:04:12] try to convince or anything like that
[1:04:15] that is not our business that's God's
[1:04:18] work that is a supernatural work that
[1:04:22] God himself is doing in this day and in
[1:04:25] this hour praise the name of the Lord O
[1:04:28] glory to God Amen yes we sit here now
[1:04:33] look when he put that seed there in the
[1:04:38] earth
[1:04:39] hallelujah amen natural and spiritual
[1:04:44] amen see he put it there and it can only
[1:04:49] come forth
[1:04:51] with the power of life within it
[1:04:54] that will begin to transform it
[1:04:58] from a seed into the kind of plant he
[1:05:03] wants it to be
[1:05:05] is that right praise God or whatever it
[1:05:09] was but it was God had to put that seed
[1:05:12] in there
[1:05:13] but it was there with potentials already
[1:05:17] in it
[1:05:18] waiting praise God hallelujah oh my I
[1:05:23] didn't even know what potentials were in
[1:05:25] me uh you don't know what potentials
[1:05:27] were in you but when the spirit of God
[1:05:30] comes and Strikes that then it begins
[1:05:34] the potentials begins to come forth amen
[1:05:37] oh my and then
[1:05:41] it would come forth and be whatever he
[1:05:45] said it should be
[1:05:47] oh my it would be that
[1:05:50] as long as it stands in Its Right
[1:05:55] category
[1:05:57] in other words it stays in its place
[1:06:00] recognize and stays in its place right
[1:06:04] in this category praise God now that
[1:06:07] thought wasn't expressed here but in
[1:06:09] other words as long as it doesn't go on
[1:06:11] hybrid itself
[1:06:13] but it stays in this category and begins
[1:06:16] to move right there it would be just
[1:06:20] exactly what God said it would be it has
[1:06:24] to be that way he had made it that way
[1:06:27] and this is now making a channel
[1:06:32] amen praise God because when he wakes
[1:06:35] that seed up that seed becomes a channel
[1:06:37] for him to manifest
[1:06:39] or to express himself because he has an
[1:06:41] outlet then he has a channel through you
[1:06:44] and through me praise the Lord to
[1:06:46] manifest praise the Lord now and
[1:06:50] anything that stays in his channel in
[1:06:54] his line of his word it will have to
[1:06:58] bring forth exactly his word amen praise
[1:07:03] God hallelujah amen praise God so God
[1:07:07] speaks the word but then the word has
[1:07:10] life in itself to reproduce itself you
[1:07:14] can find that in the church ages Amen to
[1:07:17] reproduce itself praise the Lord
[1:07:19] hallelujah amen so God through a seed of
[1:07:24] his word and there's only one thing that
[1:07:27] can Quicken that word and that is the
[1:07:31] holy spirit amen the holy spirit is the
[1:07:35] only one can activate the life that may
[1:07:39] be head
[1:07:40] in a seed in a human being
[1:07:44] it's hidden the human being so by the
[1:07:46] preaching of the word the holy spirit is
[1:07:49] able to send the reign of his presence
[1:07:52] upon the hearts of the individual and if
[1:07:56] there's a seed hidden under the Earth
[1:07:58] the spirit of God wakes it up activates
[1:08:01] it and brings it into life so it can
[1:08:04] begin to manifest what God wants it to
[1:08:07] be to manifest for the hour amen see the
[1:08:12] spirit is the only one for it is the
[1:08:15] life Giver to the world
[1:08:18] and when the life in the world meets
[1:08:22] with the life of the spirit that it
[1:08:26] produce whatever whatsoever the seed is
[1:08:29] are supposed to be amen it will produce
[1:08:32] that the seed doesn't have to do
[1:08:34] anything of itself the spirit of God is
[1:08:36] doing that by watering you with constant
[1:08:39] revelation
[1:08:41] by water in your understanding what the
[1:08:44] holy spirit is opening of his word
[1:08:46] by watering us and then we begin to like
[1:08:50] any plant expand expand unfold that
[1:08:54] flower begins to expand and unfold then
[1:08:57] grow for the glory and praise of the
[1:09:00] Living God hallelujah amen oh my John 1
[1:09:04] 1.
[1:09:06] in the beginning was the word
[1:09:09] Hallelujah and the Word was with God but
[1:09:14] now with understanding we understand in
[1:09:17] the beginning was all the word
[1:09:19] and all the word was in Christ
[1:09:22] hallelujah amen amen and the word became
[1:09:27] what
[1:09:28] oh you think it's him only up there oh
[1:09:32] my that word become flesh
[1:09:35] but for him he came flesh because his
[1:09:39] job was right there to do what the
[1:09:42] father sent him to do the others came in
[1:09:45] various ages right down to this age of
[1:09:49] the end time but it's still the same
[1:09:52] word of God being made flesh by the Holy
[1:09:55] Spirit oh praise God forevermore yes sir
[1:09:59] amen we see that said so that word of
[1:10:03] God was already there that germ all the
[1:10:08] germs went into Christ
[1:10:10] all the genes went into Christ
[1:10:14] Hallelujah and so the word was formed
[1:10:20] the word was formed and it was formed
[1:10:24] using Mary the word was conceived by the
[1:10:30] Holy Ghost
[1:10:31] right and therefore it came forth as
[1:10:35] Jesus Christ but before it was he was
[1:10:39] Jesus Christ first it began to end
[1:10:43] morphe
[1:10:45] as Melchizedek
[1:10:47] amen it's all them seeds that make up
[1:10:52] you see that milk has that coming forth
[1:10:56] but all of them together make up one
[1:10:59] person Jesus Christ
[1:11:01] Hallelujah for all that God was was in
[1:11:04] Christ
[1:11:06] amen oh thanks be to God Amen all
[1:11:10] Brothers O Brother preachers here you
[1:11:12] see why we are of the order of
[1:11:14] Melchizedek
[1:11:16] oh my glory to God we are of the order
[1:11:19] of Melchizedek because we are a part of
[1:11:23] that we're a part in him praise the name
[1:11:26] of the Lord amen praise God you see we
[1:11:30] find out that that we were there as part
[1:11:34] of the word as germs in him already
[1:11:37] praise the Lord and then we know that
[1:11:41] Melchizedek became Jesus Christ through
[1:11:45] God using the womb of Mary
[1:11:49] amen Melchizedek
[1:11:52] become a teeny weeny bit
[1:11:56] of germ
[1:11:57] the great God
[1:12:00] Amen to come down from his glory
[1:12:04] and became a teeny little germ
[1:12:08] and come from The Unseen
[1:12:12] to the scene
[1:12:13] right he humbled himself
[1:12:17] came down what condition
[1:12:20] bringing us Redemption
[1:12:22] that in the middle of a ledician age in
[1:12:26] the dead of night when we had not one
[1:12:29] faint hope inside God humbled himself
[1:12:32] and came down amen praise the Lord
[1:12:35] hallelujah now let me begin to speak
[1:12:38] something here because there's a lot of
[1:12:40] people go around talking about the
[1:12:42] Immaculate Concept conception
[1:12:45] you ever heard of it
[1:12:51] and the emphasis by them is that the
[1:12:55] body of Jesus was created in the womb of
[1:12:59] Mary
[1:13:01] and therefore Mary is this uh she's
[1:13:04] blessed but this great holy person
[1:13:07] almost like a god herself and almost
[1:13:10] like a redeemer herself and a mediate
[1:13:12] tricks and whatever else uh they
[1:13:16] proponged her to be as such so talking
[1:13:19] about Immaculate Conception and here we
[1:13:22] go proving this word we find out now we
[1:13:27] find
[1:13:28] he caused this to happen
[1:13:31] when this little seed
[1:13:35] amen without the man
[1:13:38] came into that egg in the field see amen
[1:13:45] you see now you gotta understand came in
[1:13:47] that egg God sent his word which we
[1:13:52] would want to say that's like the sperm
[1:13:55] or germ of God
[1:13:57] and then here is the egg now if he had
[1:14:01] left that egg to be produced by Mary
[1:14:05] then that would have been sinful flesh
[1:14:10] and he couldn't inhabit sinful flesh
[1:14:14] therefore he had to bring both sperm and
[1:14:18] egg
[1:14:20] so that when it comes together
[1:14:23] the life produced by that is the perfect
[1:14:26] life that we know as Jesus Christ
[1:14:30] amen now you see why I use the term the
[1:14:35] Immaculate Conception comes into view
[1:14:37] because that's the real Immaculate
[1:14:39] Conception
[1:14:41] that's the real Immaculate Conception
[1:14:44] amen God creating both
[1:14:47] and I as I've often said before that
[1:14:52] um
[1:14:53] he did not come from Mary
[1:14:57] he only passed through Mary
[1:15:01] God used her and blessed be her name
[1:15:04] because God used her praise God glory to
[1:15:08] God and we see that that's what he did
[1:15:10] now what I'm saying I'm going to give
[1:15:12] you the quote continues here amen now
[1:15:16] when the seed without a man came into
[1:15:20] that little egg in that the field
[1:15:24] that he had created
[1:15:28] you understand so it's not me saying it
[1:15:31] I just said it ahead but there's a quote
[1:15:34] saying it into that egg in that field
[1:15:37] that he had created
[1:15:39] right oh my see then that little seed
[1:15:44] that little germ right crawls into that
[1:15:48] egg
[1:15:49] and it starts developing cell after cell
[1:15:53] after cell
[1:15:55] and when it does that
[1:15:57] it's living off of the mother's life of
[1:16:03] her body
[1:16:05] and there she begins to feed our child
[1:16:09] or feed it
[1:16:11] through her bloodstream praise the Lord
[1:16:15] every mother in here doesn't know that
[1:16:17] that's what she has to do but that's
[1:16:19] what she's doing before the child evil
[1:16:21] is born she's beating that child but
[1:16:25] she's feeding that child through her
[1:16:27] blood
[1:16:28] right she's feeding the child through
[1:16:31] her blood praise God I want you to
[1:16:34] listen close here because let me alert
[1:16:37] you he's trying to show you she had
[1:16:41] nothing to do with one Speck of blood in
[1:16:44] him
[1:16:46] but
[1:16:48] he fed us a germ he fed on the blood of
[1:16:53] his mother
[1:16:54] because he had to eat
[1:16:57] and the natural body has to live
[1:17:00] so it used the blood of the mother to
[1:17:02] feed upon
[1:17:04] but the the life that was in him that
[1:17:09] she had nothing to do with whatsoever
[1:17:13] I'll read the rest of it that's just a
[1:17:16] praise see by me now see she feeds it
[1:17:20] not its blood but her blood
[1:17:24] right oh my see for she feeds it through
[1:17:29] her bloodstream
[1:17:31] see oh my no it has not one Speck of
[1:17:36] that Mother's blood but it feeds it from
[1:17:39] the vitamins from the mother
[1:17:42] but remember not her blood see not
[1:17:48] living by her blood to keep it
[1:17:53] now he does that to keep it from shock
[1:17:57] and things like that through that blood
[1:18:01] and that water right oh my I'm going to
[1:18:06] jump over some things here you can go
[1:18:08] yourself and read that and proving his
[1:18:10] word now we find that God came into his
[1:18:15] little self
[1:18:17] and began to develop cells there through
[1:18:22] that right from his mother's vitamins
[1:18:27] and things
[1:18:28] then when he became old enough
[1:18:32] in there
[1:18:34] he began to eat himself
[1:18:38] and what as he grew he began to eat it's
[1:18:44] the dust of the earth which came up
[1:18:47] in other words his body begins to grow
[1:18:50] his body begin to form
[1:18:53] that's the dust of the earth
[1:18:55] deforming amen right
[1:18:58] which come up plant life animal life he
[1:19:02] began to eat fish as you know and bread
[1:19:06] and so forth and began to develop cells
[1:19:10] then when he become fully matured at the
[1:19:14] age of 30 he was baptized in obedience
[1:19:17] to to God in the water went out and he
[1:19:21] went on his ministry
[1:19:23] right now this process that he's talking
[1:19:27] about if you're thinking Every Single
[1:19:29] Seed literally passes through the same
[1:19:31] process
[1:19:32] right amen now and what happened when he
[1:19:37] come to that age of maturity the dove
[1:19:42] which was God descending from heaven
[1:19:45] with a voice saying this is my beloved
[1:19:49] Son
[1:19:50] in whom I am pleased to dwell amen
[1:19:54] praise God he says in other words what
[1:19:58] he was talking about is how Jesus
[1:20:03] was begotten
[1:20:06] in the womb of Mary that is why he's
[1:20:09] called us the only begotten son right he
[1:20:14] was begotten in the womb of Mary praise
[1:20:19] the Lord hallelujah we're not talking
[1:20:21] about the spirit of course I'm talking
[1:20:23] about the body uh being formed like that
[1:20:27] praise the Lord hallelujah amen praise
[1:20:30] God now
[1:20:34] Jesus of course was not created a repeat
[1:20:37] he wasn't created
[1:20:40] he was formed in the womb of Mary from
[1:20:43] the dust of the earth just like Adam was
[1:20:46] formed by God back in Genesis now it's a
[1:20:50] new creation coming and now he is formed
[1:20:54] Again by God but the dust of the earth
[1:20:58] is using is not ground
[1:21:01] the dust of the earth is a human being
[1:21:04] and he uses that to have the body that
[1:21:09] would be called his son to be formed at
[1:21:12] that particular time through the body
[1:21:17] the body feeding of his mother praise
[1:21:22] God hallelujah amen now token message
[1:21:27] amen we know that when Jesus came to the
[1:21:30] Earth he came to represent the Lamb of
[1:21:32] God
[1:21:34] so that he could take away our sins
[1:21:37] so that he could redeem us that he could
[1:21:40] buy us back and bring us back to God and
[1:21:43] be our substitute and so on all those
[1:21:46] various things amen praise the Lord so
[1:21:50] only when the Dove came upon him that he
[1:21:53] was fully empowered and quickened to go
[1:21:56] forth and to
[1:21:58] um performance Ministry and that is
[1:22:01] similar like when rain comes down on the
[1:22:05] seed only then is the seed activated and
[1:22:08] quickened that it can come forth and
[1:22:11] begin to express what it's supposed to
[1:22:12] be amen no matter how long you or I were
[1:22:16] in Christianity we could never manifest
[1:22:18] what we are supposed to be until the
[1:22:21] right reign of the Holy Spirit Came Upon
[1:22:24] Us amen and to bring out of you what was
[1:22:29] hid in you that you yourself didn't know
[1:22:32] what was hid up in you until God begins
[1:22:35] to manifest through you amen hallelujah
[1:22:39] and so God sends the true baptism of the
[1:22:42] Holy Spirit upon you
[1:22:44] when the dove
[1:22:46] the Holy Spirit conceives the word by
[1:22:50] the spirit coming upon that son or
[1:22:53] daughter that's formed or in a human
[1:22:57] body amen and he falls upon it praise
[1:23:02] God nobody else nothing else could
[1:23:04] Quicken that but when he comes he
[1:23:07] quickens it to life amen amen praise God
[1:23:10] Amen and that seed begins to produce
[1:23:14] what is supposed to produce for the
[1:23:16] glory of God Amen oh my praise God now
[1:23:21] we find out rapture the Rapture book
[1:23:25] then how do we get into his body
[1:23:30] amen First Corinthians 12 by one Spirit
[1:23:35] we are all baptized into one body
[1:23:40] amen no more uh you know human beings in
[1:23:45] other words when you break back to that
[1:23:47] realm recognize you are one of his
[1:23:49] you're the spirit man or Spirit man if
[1:23:53] you want to put it that way all together
[1:23:56] amen it's you they all baptize into one
[1:24:00] body because they all make up part of
[1:24:03] him
[1:24:03] amen so they baptize the one body by the
[1:24:07] Holy Spirit baptism amen by one Spirit
[1:24:11] we are all baptized and that the spirit
[1:24:15] is the Life of Christ
[1:24:18] amen and the life of any seed which he
[1:24:24] is the word seed praise God do you
[1:24:28] believe that
[1:24:30] and from him come many seeds he said
[1:24:33] look what he says he says do you know
[1:24:36] look how simply says it that
[1:24:39] uh the first tree
[1:24:42] any oak tree the first oak tree he says
[1:24:46] you know all these other oak trees
[1:24:49] come from that first tree
[1:24:52] well this is the same thought coming
[1:24:54] forth here he was the and is the
[1:24:58] Original Seed
[1:25:00] and every other seed that ever comes
[1:25:04] forth to Till the World Ends comes forth
[1:25:07] from him if it's going to comfort
[1:25:09] nothing else can produce it we don't
[1:25:12] want to go into all this talk about
[1:25:13] Theology and this and that nothing else
[1:25:16] can produce it no emotion no intellect
[1:25:19] no nothing only he can produce it
[1:25:23] himself
[1:25:24] only he can reproduce himself praise the
[1:25:27] name of the Lord for he is the seed and
[1:25:31] if that life if that seed see is there
[1:25:37] laying there then this baptism of the
[1:25:41] holy spirit will come upon it and then
[1:25:44] it's bound to bring forth this life that
[1:25:48] is in that seed amen praise God when the
[1:25:52] Holy Spirit comes upon it so if you're
[1:25:55] going to teach them about the Holy
[1:25:56] Spirit you understand is not what the
[1:25:59] denominations taught us for so long that
[1:26:02] Holy Spirit is now going to come on you
[1:26:05] and you're not going to get the Holy
[1:26:06] Spirit no you find out that spirit with
[1:26:10] Spirit are going to meet the prophet
[1:26:12] puts it so he says watch what happens
[1:26:15] when two omnipotenses meet and come
[1:26:18] together amen praise God because this is
[1:26:22] part of God Amen them and God themselves
[1:26:25] come and makes contact with him calling
[1:26:28] it back to himself
[1:26:30] praise God calling it back to his
[1:26:32] position praise God hallelujah amen yes
[1:26:37] sir I tell you your spirit alone
[1:26:39] quickness the word
[1:26:42] amen praise the name of the Lord now we
[1:26:46] want to go now to come the communion
[1:26:48] book I'm saying it so it goes on tape
[1:26:51] maybe you can use that too and we want
[1:26:54] to talk about this because right here
[1:26:57] you can see the two books
[1:27:00] the book of natural life
[1:27:04] and the germ or the gene the Lamb's Book
[1:27:08] of Life
[1:27:09] is that right
[1:27:11] so now you you take that thought and
[1:27:13] expand it and you understand that uh we
[1:27:17] are almost like two books walking around
[1:27:20] right because you got a natural life and
[1:27:23] and then you got the germ or the gene
[1:27:26] now if a person doesn't have the gene
[1:27:30] they really only have one
[1:27:33] one book and when that book is read and
[1:27:36] done uh you know they stand before the
[1:27:40] judgment and all that not to go into
[1:27:43] that but you just take that thought and
[1:27:45] you can run with it praise God so
[1:27:48] there's a connection there uh between
[1:27:51] the the spirit and the word seed the
[1:27:54] Lamb's Book of Life and just the natural
[1:27:59] book of life that we have now quoting
[1:28:03] from the communion book
[1:28:06] the First Book of Life coming up that
[1:28:10] comes up when you are born
[1:28:12] the first book of natural life amen then
[1:28:18] way back down in there there
[1:28:22] is a little grain of life amen now he's
[1:28:28] talking about you you're born the
[1:28:30] natural book of life but done in there
[1:28:34] amen he says is the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:28:40] a grain of life I was explaining this to
[1:28:44] some of the young sisters that there's a
[1:28:46] little grain of Life laying in there and
[1:28:50] you would wonder where did that come
[1:28:53] from where did that come from amen and I
[1:28:57] said to them take myself you see uh
[1:29:00] William Branham well 40 years ago
[1:29:04] William Branham the same one you see
[1:29:07] here tonight that somebody back there
[1:29:10] would say I knew William Branham 40
[1:29:13] years ago he was nothing but a rank
[1:29:16] rascal
[1:29:18] see because I was born of Charles and
[1:29:24] Ella Branham
[1:29:26] I was nothing but a rank
[1:29:29] sinner
[1:29:31] I was born in their nature
[1:29:35] and therefore I was a sinner
[1:29:38] and I came to the world
[1:29:42] a liar and having all the habits of the
[1:29:46] world already laying in me
[1:29:49] because I was born in other words by
[1:29:52] natural birth through Charles and Ella
[1:29:55] Branham
[1:29:57] but see down in there
[1:30:00] right another nature was present
[1:30:06] predestinated in there by God
[1:30:10] Hallelujah takes me to God Amen see oh
[1:30:14] my that was in there well
[1:30:19] I only cater to one
[1:30:22] see I good and good and grew up and when
[1:30:26] I grew up I started to become
[1:30:29] a liar
[1:30:32] I become everything else
[1:30:35] because that's a sinner because I was
[1:30:39] raised up that way and in that nature of
[1:30:44] human life amen doesn't matter who you
[1:30:47] are
[1:30:48] nobody is born holy
[1:30:52] is that right
[1:30:53] I said nobody's born holy
[1:30:56] and you're born where are you going to
[1:30:58] Manifest this Natural Life
[1:31:00] right just like that now we find out I
[1:31:04] become a liar and everything else
[1:31:06] because I was raised up that way but let
[1:31:09] me repeat back down in there was a
[1:31:13] little speck of Life all the time not a
[1:31:17] speck of God's life
[1:31:19] what's right there laying in there all
[1:31:23] the time praise God oh my praise God I
[1:31:28] thank God for that friends that we can
[1:31:31] recognize that there's a spirit man
[1:31:33] living in this man
[1:31:35] is that right in you there's a spirit
[1:31:39] woman living in this woman that can be
[1:31:42] seen they can't see that person but that
[1:31:45] person lives in this person amen and
[1:31:49] they are manifesting God through this
[1:31:53] person hallelujah amen praise God now
[1:31:57] the Bible tells us we were dead in sins
[1:32:00] and in trespasses
[1:32:02] is that right
[1:32:03] Ephesians believe you Ephesians 2 right
[1:32:07] anyway the Bible says you were dead in
[1:32:10] sins and in trespasses
[1:32:12] wow what is he talking about it is the
[1:32:16] natural man that was born from mother
[1:32:20] father amen since the Garden of Eden
[1:32:23] that man was dead in sins and in
[1:32:27] trespasses
[1:32:29] doesn't matter how long he lives his end
[1:32:31] is going to be death
[1:32:34] doesn't matter what how many years
[1:32:37] how good how charitable
[1:32:39] how religious how educated his end is
[1:32:43] death
[1:32:44] and after death the Judgment that is his
[1:32:48] end as it really is oh my because that
[1:32:53] man is dead in sins but down in that
[1:32:57] mind if that person is an elected seed
[1:33:01] there is a speck of God's life living in
[1:33:05] there
[1:33:06] amen because back of God's life praise
[1:33:10] God and when it is the right time
[1:33:13] what is the right Edge
[1:33:15] for that to come to life then God will
[1:33:19] cause his word to go forth by a preacher
[1:33:22] preaching or some other means he'll let
[1:33:25] his word go forth
[1:33:27] and wake up that Speck of his life
[1:33:30] thus was hiding in there all the time
[1:33:34] amen praise God o my praise God continue
[1:33:38] on
[1:33:40] now remember
[1:33:42] there
[1:33:44] there was another William Branham in
[1:33:49] there
[1:33:51] this William Branham a Lyra cheated this
[1:33:54] and that you know everything else but he
[1:33:57] says remember there was another William
[1:34:01] Branham living in there
[1:34:04] that one
[1:34:05] a little spot of eternal life down there
[1:34:10] you would go home take the book and you
[1:34:12] read it yourself and you can slow down
[1:34:14] and think about it amen you see that
[1:34:18] little spot of eternal life down there
[1:34:21] from the genes of God
[1:34:24] amen
[1:34:26] the word of God
[1:34:29] that was placed in there he called it
[1:34:32] the dream he called it The Germ he
[1:34:34] called it a spot of eternal life and you
[1:34:36] can go over what was being said here
[1:34:38] what he calls it that it was just laying
[1:34:41] there but it was laying there just
[1:34:42] waiting
[1:34:44] waiting for the time when it caught it's
[1:34:48] its name is called right let there be
[1:34:52] comfort
[1:34:54] Glenn
[1:34:56] come forth
[1:34:58] Gabriel come forth It's just waiting on
[1:35:02] his time
[1:35:04] it doesn't matter what persuasive
[1:35:06] preacher what powerful preacher comes
[1:35:08] that person could be in the church and
[1:35:10] they never understanding
[1:35:12] they never receiving the fullness of the
[1:35:16] word
[1:35:17] amen she teaches us with patience
[1:35:20] it teaches us to have Grace
[1:35:22] broadly kindness because humanly we look
[1:35:26] and see I can't see how she can
[1:35:28] understand this I can't see you cannot
[1:35:31] see how he can't understand this but it
[1:35:34] is in God's time for everything there is
[1:35:38] a time and a season and a purpose and
[1:35:41] God knows that Hallelujah but we human
[1:35:44] beings we always want to push this way
[1:35:46] and push that way and pull the other way
[1:35:48] amen praise the name of the Lord oh my
[1:35:52] so the word of God was placed in there
[1:35:57] amen but you understand brother sister
[1:36:00] God already seen your name
[1:36:05] and I'm saying that because your name if
[1:36:09] you are part of the Eternal genes of God
[1:36:11] is already in the book the Lamb's Book
[1:36:15] of Life
[1:36:17] is that right it's already in the lamps
[1:36:19] look alive so he knows your name over
[1:36:21] there never mind what they call you over
[1:36:23] here in the Book of Life is he knows
[1:36:27] your name in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:36:30] and he knows what word to cause the
[1:36:34] minister to minister or to preach
[1:36:37] the prophet said you see it's not
[1:36:39] calling your name like James G in other
[1:36:41] words your natural human name they give
[1:36:43] you when he was born give him the name
[1:36:46] Jesus you come down here give him the
[1:36:48] name Harold give him the name this give
[1:36:50] him but he says but he knows your name
[1:36:54] and then he calls your name how by the
[1:36:57] word the opening of the word
[1:36:59] and if you are a part of the word and
[1:37:02] the preacher is preaching the word and
[1:37:05] you happen to be that exact part of the
[1:37:09] word it'll shake up your soul and wake
[1:37:12] you up and you'll recognize who you are
[1:37:14] amen because your call your name is
[1:37:18] being called right out of the word now I
[1:37:21] don't know any name you don't know any
[1:37:22] name but you're gonna know it you're
[1:37:25] gonna know it amen when the spirit calls
[1:37:28] your name amen praise be to God
[1:37:30] hallelujah amen praise God so that we
[1:37:34] understand here from all I'm saying is
[1:37:37] that God's thoughts
[1:37:40] or genes or attributes or germs amen are
[1:37:45] a part of God
[1:37:47] housed in a human body
[1:37:51] we were housed in a human body housed in
[1:37:54] a barn for a little while amen praise
[1:37:58] God and God then amen
[1:38:03] formed from the dust of the Earth
[1:38:06] they
[1:38:08] house that you were going to live in
[1:38:12] when a male female black white brown
[1:38:14] yellow whatever God knows that and he
[1:38:18] knows the reason why he put you there
[1:38:20] is that right you believe it
[1:38:22] I believe it so you see the stupidity of
[1:38:26] people when they look at uh race
[1:38:31] when they look at culture
[1:38:33] when they look at backgrounds
[1:38:35] God's genes are ageless
[1:38:39] and timeless
[1:38:42] and they are not limited to any race
[1:38:45] color creed or nothing
[1:38:48] the book of Acts says for they are the
[1:38:51] children of the my Almighty born by the
[1:38:55] blood of God and of the almighty amen
[1:39:00] praise God these are just houses we are
[1:39:03] allowed to live in so we can be down
[1:39:05] here and perform whatever we are
[1:39:08] supposed to perform for the glory of God
[1:39:11] we don't have to be aware of what we are
[1:39:15] supposed to do or you're supposed to
[1:39:16] know this you're supposed to know your
[1:39:18] purpose you suppose and then people are
[1:39:20] confused
[1:39:21] and that people are in chaos they don't
[1:39:23] know what they're doing all you are
[1:39:25] supposed to do is to live a Christian
[1:39:28] Life
[1:39:30] just live
[1:39:31] eat like he at walk like he walk and be
[1:39:35] a normal person don't be a stuck up in
[1:39:38] other words don't try to the
[1:39:40] denominational view of a Christian is
[1:39:43] somebody that looks so holy and Pious
[1:39:46] and righteous that they look different a
[1:39:50] natural difference it's not the natural
[1:39:52] difference it's a supernatural life
[1:39:55] that's flowing out of you that shows the
[1:39:58] difference without you saying anything
[1:40:01] not that you're gonna you're not gonna
[1:40:03] talk about him or about his word but
[1:40:06] it's what's coming out to you when
[1:40:08] you're not even thinking
[1:40:09] your unconscious godliness begins to
[1:40:12] flow
[1:40:13] somebody says something to you and and
[1:40:15] you don't even think about it you say ah
[1:40:17] don't worry about that the normal person
[1:40:20] that person you might have blow up knock
[1:40:23] their head off or wrestle them to the
[1:40:26] ground and they don't understand oh some
[1:40:28] will deliberately come and try to stir
[1:40:32] you up
[1:40:33] as Bob will say
[1:40:35] to hurry up and he will come and try to
[1:40:39] Stir It Up but when he comes you just
[1:40:42] smile because you know that's the devil
[1:40:43] just using one of his agents to do that
[1:40:46] and you're not even worrying about it
[1:40:48] but that's what God is doing in this
[1:40:50] time what a season we are living in amen
[1:40:53] when we begin to understand these things
[1:40:56] I want to say God bless mothers brothers
[1:40:59] let's give a hand for mothers
[1:41:03] [Applause]
[1:41:09] and I'm doing that not because we read
[1:41:12] in the Bible about Mary but what the
[1:41:15] truth that the prophet is bringing forth
[1:41:17] here that is not only Mary Mary that was
[1:41:22] formed in her by the direct spoken word
[1:41:26] but the the physical body was formed by
[1:41:30] God's spoken word amen but now he allows
[1:41:34] us to be formed
[1:41:36] Amen in the womb of a woman a wife a
[1:41:42] mother
[1:41:42] and come forth amen and that's why I'm
[1:41:46] saying and that's why I believe that's
[1:41:49] the way it takes me to now anyway why he
[1:41:53] said honor your father and your mother
[1:41:57] that your days may be long upon the land
[1:42:00] that the Lord thy God givethly it's the
[1:42:03] only commandment given with a promise
[1:42:06] attached to it
[1:42:08] because he used uh women uh who should
[1:42:14] be honored
[1:42:15] to bring forth that which is his own
[1:42:19] to feed it amen and to take care of it
[1:42:24] before it even come forth they're
[1:42:26] feeding it that's the prophet said here
[1:42:28] from their bloodstream
[1:42:30] they're feeding it that's why some of
[1:42:33] you will wanted to know all of a sudden
[1:42:35] oh my my wife asked me to go and buy
[1:42:38] some green mangoes
[1:42:42] I don't know how she wanted to suck on a
[1:42:45] lemon
[1:42:47] but they asked for strange things at
[1:42:50] strange times but brother Branham taught
[1:42:53] us that he says because something is
[1:42:57] calling for that like the boy that at
[1:43:00] the the the the bicycle tire off he says
[1:43:03] he needed the the chemicals or the the
[1:43:06] vitamins that was in that and that's why
[1:43:10] he was eating it and that's why they eat
[1:43:13] some of these strange things they want a
[1:43:16] ice cream and lemon at the same time
[1:43:20] right some kind of thing like that but
[1:43:24] it's because that child is calling for
[1:43:27] that it needs that some element in there
[1:43:30] it needs
[1:43:31] and God used them to form that house
[1:43:37] that that child or that germ or Gene is
[1:43:42] going to live in
[1:43:43] praise the Lord hallelujah so God bless
[1:43:46] you mothers
[1:43:48] God honor and bless you just as much as
[1:43:51] the honor Mary every real mother in here
[1:43:55] is blessed by God and honored by us and
[1:43:58] praise be to God for you God bless you
[1:44:01] all
[1:44:02] you see
[1:44:04] a little spot of eternal life done there
[1:44:08] from the very genes of God
[1:44:12] you see why I talk a lot about the seed
[1:44:14] and the Gene and The Germ because that's
[1:44:17] what it is
[1:44:19] you see it's the word of God
[1:44:22] that was pla the word of God was placed
[1:44:26] in there praise the Lord oh my
[1:44:30] then I looked up
[1:44:32] to the trees
[1:44:35] and I began to think
[1:44:37] leave I seen you
[1:44:40] fall off last year
[1:44:42] and here you are this year you're back
[1:44:45] again
[1:44:46] where did you come from what brought you
[1:44:49] here
[1:44:50] you see it was that eternal life
[1:44:55] working in the body in other words he's
[1:44:59] saying the eternal life in him was
[1:45:00] waking up
[1:45:02] it was coming awake
[1:45:04] but it started as it went on its way
[1:45:08] it started to think about things right
[1:45:12] oh my but then
[1:45:15] one day
[1:45:17] as I walked on I heard that voice
[1:45:22] oh my what a beautiful sermon right
[1:45:24] there
[1:45:25] one day as we were walking on our
[1:45:28] natural life and enjoying life and
[1:45:31] living and everything else I heard that
[1:45:34] voice
[1:45:36] amen and when I heard that voice what
[1:45:39] did it do it attracted your attention
[1:45:42] caused you to turn aside amen oh my oh
[1:45:46] see oh my and what did the voice amen
[1:45:50] praise God begin to say to me
[1:45:53] don't ever smoke don't drink and so
[1:45:58] forth see it spoke talking to me and
[1:46:02] saying that now it may not talk to you
[1:46:04] in an audible voice but somewhere he
[1:46:07] says in your life he says some of you
[1:46:10] can think of this it spoke to you
[1:46:14] amen it might not have said it like he
[1:46:17] said it but somehow you're not supposed
[1:46:20] to do this
[1:46:22] you're not supposed to be here
[1:46:25] like when brother Peter was here you
[1:46:27] know told me how he went into a bar and
[1:46:30] he's talking and thinking that he's a
[1:46:32] he's just a everybody with all the other
[1:46:35] guys and and he's talking the then
[1:46:39] those guys turn around and says man
[1:46:41] you're different you're supposed to be
[1:46:44] here
[1:46:47] and he recognized that that was the
[1:46:50] voice of God speaking to him amen and
[1:46:54] every one of us like he said here we
[1:46:58] will have something of like that
[1:47:01] somehow you know you are different
[1:47:04] because something revealed to you you're
[1:47:07] not just an ordinary person living a
[1:47:10] book of life and when the book comes to
[1:47:11] an end you close the book and that's the
[1:47:13] end of it no sir Oh my Jesus already
[1:47:16] done that for us in the old Temple there
[1:47:19] in Capernaum Bible says he read from the
[1:47:23] book called out the names and then he
[1:47:25] closed the book this Natural Body my the
[1:47:29] book may be close Hallelujah but out of
[1:47:32] that came a voice this is my beloved Son
[1:47:36] hear ye him praise Peter God Amen and
[1:47:40] that's the hour that we are living in
[1:47:42] here right now brother sister amen
[1:47:45] praise God
[1:47:47] oh my praise the Lord God forevermore I
[1:47:51] give him praise amen that voice is a
[1:47:54] voice like no other voice you ever heard
[1:47:57] like that Pastor that was passing by he
[1:48:00] was already a Pentecostal Minister he
[1:48:03] was the administrator of a major
[1:48:05] hospital and he was going by from work
[1:48:08] with his briefcase he just heard the
[1:48:10] voice of brother Branham we had received
[1:48:13] the first couple of tapes
[1:48:15] first time I'm going to hear Brother
[1:48:16] Brandon's voice
[1:48:18] weekend and we were just glued to that
[1:48:21] old Woolen Sac recorder
[1:48:24] and at the same time the tape coming
[1:48:28] forth and we were glued listening to it
[1:48:30] and we heard Bang Bang Bang on the door
[1:48:33] uh minded disturbing us went to the door
[1:48:36] opened it and he rushed me said what's
[1:48:38] that you're listening to he said I heard
[1:48:40] that voice I said he said I I don't know
[1:48:43] who that person is but that voice is
[1:48:46] coming from Heaven oh right now I
[1:48:48] believe anything that man says
[1:48:51] he never heard of brother Branham
[1:48:55] he nothing about it all he did was hear
[1:48:59] a voice
[1:49:00] have you heard that voice
[1:49:02] has it made a difference in your life
[1:49:06] if you have not been baptized get
[1:49:08] baptized if you haven't repented repent
[1:49:11] turn to God surrender your life whether
[1:49:14] you're here or you're out there in in
[1:49:16] the digital land up there hear the voice
[1:49:19] of God for your day and for your hour
[1:49:22] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:49:25] Jesus Christ and you shall receive the
[1:49:27] Holy Ghost and he shall come upon you
[1:49:30] and bring to you to life to glorify your
[1:49:33] father which is in heaven amen all at
[1:49:37] once
[1:49:38] you see I looked up
[1:49:41] and when I looked up I said now I know
[1:49:46] I'm not the son of Charles and Ella
[1:49:49] Branham
[1:49:51] it means that he's not just he's not
[1:49:53] like
[1:49:55] putting away his mother and father but
[1:49:58] he's saying in natural life is really
[1:50:00] I'm not the son of Charles and Ella
[1:50:03] Branham that's just the flesh part right
[1:50:06] oh my see there is something out there
[1:50:11] that's now calling out to me
[1:50:14] amen all friends go listen my little
[1:50:17] Eagle story recognize you're not a
[1:50:21] chicken amen could anybody here
[1:50:23] recognize that I'm not a chicken I'm an
[1:50:27] eagle by the grace of God hallelujah I'm
[1:50:31] here I eat chickens praise God
[1:50:34] hallelujah I'm not a chicken I'm a eagle
[1:50:37] by the grace of when chickens see me
[1:50:40] they're scattered because Oh Glory of
[1:50:43] God because they know that you're ready
[1:50:45] to come after them for the glory of God
[1:50:48] amen glory to God hallelujah amen there
[1:50:52] I'm not a chicken there's something up
[1:50:54] yonder there somewhere out there calling
[1:50:57] me oh great over wherever you are
[1:51:02] whoever you are open up for me amen
[1:51:05] shouldn't every one of us begin to pray
[1:51:07] like that oh God open up the word open
[1:51:11] up your understanding open up the whole
[1:51:13] thing to me let me see the vistas of
[1:51:17] your promises and of your grace Lord let
[1:51:19] me see it clear praise God forevermore
[1:51:23] amen yes sir oh my open it up for me
[1:51:27] because Jehovah I want to come home
[1:51:32] you can't go and go home unless it's
[1:51:34] opened up to you there's no way you can
[1:51:37] do it
[1:51:38] and then
[1:51:41] that's when that happened
[1:51:43] he said then I was born again
[1:51:48] what brother Branham a minister in the
[1:51:51] Baptist Church preaching
[1:51:53] for many years
[1:51:56] 40 years old preaching
[1:51:59] and then
[1:52:01] he gets this strange feeling
[1:52:04] heard that voice and his life started to
[1:52:07] change and then when he comes to a full
[1:52:11] recognition because remember you heard
[1:52:13] the voice since he was a boy passing
[1:52:15] onto that tree carrying the water
[1:52:17] but it's only later on he understood
[1:52:22] because and he says when that angel came
[1:52:25] to him and said your Strange Life and so
[1:52:28] on was because I'm beginning to he said
[1:52:30] the moment I heard that voice I
[1:52:33] recognized it was the same voice
[1:52:35] that he heard when he was just a child
[1:52:37] amen and the same thing with us what
[1:52:40] spoke to you as you would say oh
[1:52:42] something said to me in my mind
[1:52:45] but now when you hear it comfort in the
[1:52:48] form of the word you recognizes the same
[1:52:51] voice
[1:52:52] praise God hallelujah says then I was
[1:52:56] born again
[1:52:57] that little life was laying there amen
[1:53:01] that life water was poured upon it and
[1:53:05] then it began to grow the Waters of Life
[1:53:09] the word of God was poured upon it and
[1:53:13] it began to grow praise God oh my in
[1:53:17] other words that began to manifest
[1:53:20] itself now that old life that's the one
[1:53:25] that was forgiven
[1:53:28] and put in the sea of God's
[1:53:31] forgetfulness
[1:53:33] never to be remembered against me no
[1:53:37] more
[1:53:38] see that life when those things were
[1:53:42] done
[1:53:43] or even done we are still alive in this
[1:53:46] body that is what God puts in the sea of
[1:53:49] his forgetfulness because he knows you
[1:53:52] and you he knows you're a part of him
[1:53:54] and he lost the seed of God really can't
[1:53:57] sin
[1:53:58] Satan is just doing that so that he he
[1:54:01] thinks he can get God so angry that he
[1:54:03] take one of his child and throw them in
[1:54:05] the fire
[1:54:06] like he did with all those uh religions
[1:54:09] with idolatry where they thrown their
[1:54:11] children in the fire or to feed them to
[1:54:13] crocodiles but God is not like that God
[1:54:15] knows his own he says I'm not going to
[1:54:17] lose one
[1:54:19] there's my neck coming right back to me
[1:54:21] praise the name of the Lord Jesus amen
[1:54:24] you see when you see when we understand
[1:54:27] this is remember
[1:54:30] now we stand Here We Stand Justified
[1:54:35] Hallelujah we stand here Justified
[1:54:38] when you understand what what was just
[1:54:41] said and what he just said you
[1:54:43] understand the gene in you is absolutely
[1:54:48] sinless
[1:54:50] because it can't sin it's a part of God
[1:54:54] James said it for the seed of God cannot
[1:54:58] sin it can't do it amen praise God
[1:55:02] hallelujah oh my praise God forevermore
[1:55:06] let's jump over uh to the Future home
[1:55:11] praise the Lord
[1:55:13] amen okay I still have 10 minutes to you
[1:55:16] let me use it up
[1:55:19] I'm not going to hold you beyond that
[1:55:22] but I want to get some of this stuff out
[1:55:26] future home of the Heavenly Pride
[1:55:28] and the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:55:32] Earthly bride amen praise the name of
[1:55:36] the Lord praise God
[1:55:38] now we know we understand here that
[1:55:42] we're talking about us having a holy
[1:55:46] convocation
[1:55:47] and the convocation is as them seas are
[1:55:52] brought back to recognition of the word
[1:55:55] they are coming together collecting and
[1:55:59] they all start worshiping God together
[1:56:01] again and praising him with
[1:56:03] understanding like Paul said not just
[1:56:06] praising him because you read it in the
[1:56:08] Bible but you praise in him now with
[1:56:10] Revelation or understanding and giving
[1:56:13] God all the praise the honor and the
[1:56:15] glory and you come into a state of holy
[1:56:18] convocation
[1:56:20] praise the name of the Lord amen praise
[1:56:23] God hallelujah because the spirit
[1:56:26] falling on the word seed the gene or The
[1:56:28] Germ amen the dove are coming on that uh
[1:56:33] Lamb of God Jesus back there the spirit
[1:56:36] coming in our day upon us amen for this
[1:56:41] hour praise God in other words one of
[1:56:44] God's little lambs the Holy Spirit
[1:56:47] coming again and anointing his children
[1:56:50] because uh quote the prophet again he
[1:56:54] says only those two natures one
[1:57:00] and the other coming together could ever
[1:57:02] fit
[1:57:04] it can't fit a fox or can't fit some
[1:57:06] other animal only those Natures can fit
[1:57:10] together amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:57:14] but you see that's why we stress and we
[1:57:17] preach that it's not just coming to
[1:57:21] church
[1:57:23] because you can cast a net in the sea
[1:57:26] like Jesus said
[1:57:28] like I preach the word of God
[1:57:30] and the word of God brought in a lot of
[1:57:33] people into the church but that doesn't
[1:57:37] mean because you have a church full of
[1:57:39] people that they all are Christians
[1:57:42] or in our terms all our message
[1:57:45] Believers are all our bride or all going
[1:57:50] in the presence of God that is as much
[1:57:52] as saying you throw the net and you
[1:57:55] caught some catfish
[1:57:58] and when you pull them in by God those
[1:58:02] catfish turn into rainbow trout
[1:58:05] it doesn't happen that way
[1:58:08] they are whatever they are
[1:58:12] by whatever life is in them
[1:58:16] right praise the Lord praise God or
[1:58:20] brother Glenn might be smarter than me
[1:58:22] and he might pull one of those things
[1:58:25] where you catch a pig and put him in a
[1:58:28] sheep pen and by tomorrow morning
[1:58:33] why God is no more a a pig he's a sheep
[1:58:37] it's not being in the church
[1:58:40] it's not the pen that you're in that
[1:58:43] change
[1:58:44] I'm sorry I'm talking like this but it's
[1:58:47] not the pen that you're in that changes
[1:58:50] your life
[1:58:51] oh I go to this big church over here my
[1:58:54] Minister and so and so my shepherd is
[1:58:56] educated over there that has nothing to
[1:59:00] do with it
[1:59:01] it's the very nature of the thing praise
[1:59:05] the name of the Lord that's the nature
[1:59:07] of it praise God hallelujah amen the
[1:59:11] spirit of God manifests whatever it is
[1:59:15] now I'm going to end this here praise
[1:59:18] the Lord
[1:59:20] Hallelujah
[1:59:22] I thank God we are in the kingdom of God
[1:59:25] not by our own will but by
[1:59:28] predestination
[1:59:32] praise the Lord
[1:59:34] I was about to say and I'm going to
[1:59:37] show you what he said about this but
[1:59:39] it's right here in front of me in the
[1:59:41] quote here
[1:59:42] now
[1:59:44] we know when you're into the kingdom of
[1:59:47] God with eternal life
[1:59:50] with the predestinated life that never
[1:59:54] did ever start
[1:59:57] amen
[1:59:59] it never started on any day
[2:00:03] so therefore you wasn't saved on any day
[2:00:08] oh my
[2:00:10] oh for you were always saved these are
[2:00:15] not my words this is the Prophets The
[2:00:17] Words of Malachi 4 5.
[2:00:21] Jesus just come to redeem that
[2:00:26] is that right
[2:00:28] that is all he come here to redeem but
[2:00:31] whosoever will May Come
[2:00:33] but he only come to redeem that
[2:00:36] predestinated that came from him but you
[2:00:39] see you were saved from the beginning
[2:00:43] because you had eternal life in you to
[2:00:48] begin with
[2:00:49] you come down here with eternal life is
[2:00:52] that right amen you didn't go get saved
[2:00:57] as they would think like that at the
[2:01:00] altar that is just an Awakening
[2:01:04] that is like a spiritual resurrection of
[2:01:07] a seed when the word of God makes it
[2:01:10] aware of who it is amen
[2:01:14] praise the Lord amen oh Hallelujah no
[2:01:19] matter
[2:01:21] look what it is talking about the high
[2:01:24] priest and that prostitute that was back
[2:01:28] there the woman at the well you see
[2:01:32] outwardly
[2:01:34] this man was pious
[2:01:36] righteous walking around with a prayer
[2:01:39] book
[2:01:40] make sure that it's painted with gold so
[2:01:43] you can recognize what book it is
[2:01:46] he was just pious
[2:01:49] amen but he wasn't a son of God
[2:01:54] see
[2:01:55] he wasn't the Son of God outwardly he
[2:01:58] was pious
[2:01:59] but inwardly he was not a son of God
[2:02:03] but what about that little prostitute
[2:02:06] see
[2:02:07] at the well she was really the daughter
[2:02:10] of God the same thing with Jacob and
[2:02:13] Esau right the same thing that you're
[2:02:16] seeing here right there no matter how a
[2:02:20] scholar we must color that priest was
[2:02:23] no matter anything like that he still
[2:02:27] didn't have predestination the
[2:02:30] representation of that predestination in
[2:02:33] him
[2:02:36] he had no representation whatsoever
[2:02:39] praise the Lord hallelujah how wonderful
[2:02:43] to know that we are here but you have
[2:02:46] representation there in the presence of
[2:02:50] the Living God
[2:02:52] because if you got eternal life you have
[2:02:56] that
[2:02:57] and that means you had to be a part of
[2:03:00] God all the time because he is the only
[2:03:04] Eternal there is
[2:03:06] and with those words I'm going to close
[2:03:07] here amen praise God God is the only
[2:03:11] Eternal and if you claim you have
[2:03:13] eternal life then you are claiming you
[2:03:15] are a son you are his daughter you're a
[2:03:17] chip off the old block
[2:03:19] amen you are a part of him now reveal
[2:03:22] upon the Earth you're a part of that
[2:03:25] host when Daniel said I looked and saw
[2:03:27] shrones and crowns being cast down to
[2:03:30] the Earth amen praise God the Bible
[2:03:32] tells us we are Kings and Priests to God
[2:03:34] come from the prince of God to be
[2:03:37] priests to this wicked age or whatever
[2:03:41] age you're in we are here in your own
[2:03:44] way doesn't mean you got to be like they
[2:03:47] say a priest just by yours saying a good
[2:03:50] word to somebody
[2:03:52] you don't know somebody was going to
[2:03:56] kill themselves or read somewhere and
[2:03:58] passing another person on the street and
[2:04:00] the person oh good morning how are you
[2:04:02] how's your and start talking to person

[2:04:08] person changed their mind
[2:04:10] and you don't know if that even ever
[2:04:13] happened to you now
[2:04:15] because God don't always tell you what
[2:04:17] he's doing
[2:04:18] that's why he says the prophet said just
[2:04:21] go and live
[2:04:22] and just be a Christian and let your
[2:04:25] order of your life like a be away side
