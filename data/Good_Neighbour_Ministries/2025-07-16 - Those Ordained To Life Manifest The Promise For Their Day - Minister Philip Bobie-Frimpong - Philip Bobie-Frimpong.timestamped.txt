[0:00] Jesus, it won't be long with these
[0:03] things going on. The rapture is around
[0:06] the corner. Amen. Even if it terrorists,
[0:08] we are going to the sixth dimension. We
[0:11] are going to meet our loved ones when
[0:12] the time comes for God to call us. But
[0:15] with the modern events
[0:17] with this pope from America and all the
[0:21] scriptures as we read over here so many
[0:25] scriptures were fulfilled on one day
[0:28] when the Lord Jesus Christ was
[0:30] crucified. So don't let anybody put this
[0:32] in future for you. Anything all things
[0:35] can happen like with just like pimp p
[0:38] then we gone in a twinkle of an eye.
[0:41] We're going to be with the Lord. Amen.
[0:43] We shall be changed one of these days.
[0:46] As Sarah was changed to be a young lady
[0:49] before she received that promised child.
[0:52] So we going to be changed one of these
[0:54] days to receive our rapture. Amen. We
[0:57] are going to fulfill that rapture. We
[0:59] are the last one fulfill the rapture.
[1:02] Amen. Hallelujah. It's never happened
[1:04] before of the group of people. Yes, it
[1:07] took place with Elijah. It took place
[1:10] with Enoch. But it never happen with a
[1:13] whole bunch of people going one at one
[1:16] time. But it's going to happen. There is
[1:18] a meeting going on in the air in the
[1:20] street by me. Going to meet him in the
[1:22] air. Brothers, I will meet you over on
[1:24] the other side. Amen. Our God is
[1:27] awesome. He's the same yesterday, today,
[1:30] and forever.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; One of these days,
[1:33] all the sorrow will end.
[1:36] Hallelujah. One of these days, brother
[1:38] Brian, all the gray hair will go back.
[1:41] You're going to be like a 21 year old
[1:43] boy. Amen. Enjoy the presence of God.
[1:46] Amen. Don't worry.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; Sooner, very soon, you're going to see
[1:49] our king.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. No wonder that black mind that
[1:54] talk about he said that I don't want no
[1:57] crowns.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:58] &gt;&gt; I just want to see his face.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. 24 hours. The one that we love,
[2:05] &gt;&gt; the one that we've been praying, the one
[2:07] that we cherish.
[2:09] &gt;&gt; One of these days you're going to see
[2:11] him face to face. Oh man, also be God.
[2:16] Hallelujah. We are blessed people. He's
[2:19] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:23] Our God is good. He hasn't changed and
[2:26] he will never change. Whatever he did
[2:28] back then, he's doing the same thing in
[2:30] our lives because it's the same
[2:32] yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:35] Is this gospel real to you?
[2:39] &gt;&gt; Is it real to you, brothers and sisters?
[2:41] Yes. Amen. If it's real to you, then you
[2:46] have met God on the back side of the
[2:47] desert. Amen. Because when it becomes
[2:50] real to you, you can't stop. But talk
[2:53] about him. Let's talk about Jesus. 24
[2:56] hours. He's the king of kings. Amen.
[2:59] He's the rose of Sharon, Lily of Valley.
[3:02] Amen. Oh, if our conversation,
[3:04] everything should be centered around
[3:06] him. And sometimes you know why some
[3:09] people can't stand you, it's not your
[3:11] fault. Because all your conversation
[3:15] when you talk to them for a long time,
[3:17] it brings back the word.
[3:19] You talk with them, you talk them for
[3:22] long unconsciously
[3:24] something you bring back some of the
[3:26] word and the people that fifth dimension
[3:29] them they hate it and there sometimes I
[3:33] have some friends that old friends try
[3:36] to talk to them because like when the
[3:39] gospel first comes to you bum bum you
[3:42] want to let everybody knows but as as
[3:45] you matured you project grace. Yes.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; So we I never in my heart when I say
[3:53] anything about gospel to them just talk
[3:56] about normal things basketball but
[4:00] because there's something in the
[4:02] believer
[4:04] you talk talk talk talk talk you by time
[4:06] you catch yourself something of the
[4:08] scriptures comes in and something rise
[4:11] up in them and they fighting it
[4:13] &gt;&gt; but it's not your fault. So you are not
[4:17] the one going to separate yourself from
[4:19] anybody. The word of God that's the
[4:21] separation. So you don't have to worry.
[4:26] Just be pleasant.
[4:29] Be simple and live a Christian life.
[4:32] Everything will fall in place.
[4:35] And one other thing to listen to your
[4:37] thoughts because it's a voice of God to
[4:40] you.
[4:41] If you miss it, you miss a lot of
[4:43] things.
[4:45] God speaks in a little so small voice.
[4:49] Some people when they pray, they only
[4:52] want to do the talking. They pray.
[4:56] They don't relax and let God speak back
[4:59] to them
[5:01] because it's not a one-way prayer. There
[5:04] have to be a relationship.
[5:07] Give me an opportunity to talk back to
[5:10] you in the cool of the evening. Because
[5:13] remember Elijah when the wind the
[5:16] thunder that was in him so many things
[5:20] but he came in a little still small
[5:22] voice that same God is here today he's
[5:25] the same yesterday today and forever he
[5:29] hasn't changed amen
[5:32] praise God and one more other story
[5:37] about the reality of the Lord Jesus
[5:39] Christ
[5:41] about the story that Abraham gave about
[5:44] birth his friend
[5:46] &gt;&gt; who was a wicked h said he has like a
[5:49] lizard eye and then when they went for
[5:53] the fishing no for the for the hunting
[5:56] he just to get the phones to kill them
[6:00] and one thing that really
[6:05] um touched my heart over the weekend
[6:08] when I listened to that queen of Sheba
[6:10] was the love
[6:13] &gt;&gt; that
[6:14] that mother dear project.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; She was willing to give her life.
[6:22] That deer realized that her life was at
[6:25] danger, but she don't she didn't care.
[6:29] She was willing to die.
[6:32] And because of that love of God, the
[6:35] love that she projected,
[6:37] it brought God down. In that mind
[6:43] bullet could not what could not work.
[6:47] And he saw the reality of God. And when
[6:50] God becomes red to you like that,
[6:53] &gt;&gt; nobody will tell you to serve him. And
[6:57] as a Christians sometimes God has to
[7:01] come and give us a flash of those
[7:05] reality of him that give us a faith to
[7:08] move on to push on to press on because
[7:12] you need those experiences.
[7:14] You need to have that encounter with
[7:16] God. It helped Moses. It helped Paul.
[7:21] They were never the same. know that
[7:22] Abraham said you have to meet God face
[7:25] to face like those people met him before
[7:27] you can even preach because those
[7:30] encounter it helps you and encourages
[7:32] you like if God put some thought in your
[7:36] heart and you see it manifest one time
[7:40] and then he give you another one it
[7:42] manifest the second time it keep on
[7:44] manifesting what does it do to you it
[7:47] gives you courage it gives you
[7:49] encouragement to trust that voice
[7:52] &gt;&gt; because you know that voice that speak
[7:54] to you, that voice will never fail.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the reality of the word of
[7:59] God
[8:00] &gt;&gt; become so real to you. You know he's
[8:02] with you.
[8:04] His presence is with you.
[8:07] So he gives you what? The reality of the
[8:10] word of the living God. And if
[8:14] God let you pray for somebody, the
[8:16] person get healed. You pray for the next
[8:18] one, you get healed. You pray for
[8:20] situation. What does it do? It gives you
[8:22] encouragement
[8:24] &gt;&gt; to be able to step on and do that. But
[8:26] the problem of it is some people will
[8:28] not even make an attempt
[8:30] &gt;&gt; to try.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; You got to try.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; And one thing that we have to realize,
[8:41] you are not God. I am not God. He's a
[8:45] sovereign God.
[8:47] He does what he wants. So when you pray
[8:50] for the situation, it's not you
[8:53] obligated to raise that person. You are
[8:56] not obligated to bring the thing to
[8:58] pass. He is obligated
[9:01] to bring what he wants to bring to pass.
[9:05] He's obligated to answer what he wants
[9:07] to answer. He obligated to do what he
[9:10] has to do because he's a sovereign God.
[9:13] So if you pray for somebody once and it
[9:16] doesn't happen, it doesn't mean that you
[9:18] should stop
[9:21] because that thing pastor Mo used to say
[9:23] never what give up. You got to keep on
[9:26] doing it.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; Doing your best and God will take care
[9:30] of the situation because it's a
[9:32] sovereign God. And even in our normal
[9:35] lives
[9:37] when you ask God for something
[9:40] I always say it because the life here is
[9:43] too fast.
[9:45] Even my children they want this daddy we
[9:47] want it now.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; But God doesn't operate in that. He want
[9:53] us to have patience
[9:55] at the right time. He will make it
[9:59] clear. He'll bring it to pass. You can't
[10:02] force God. You can't tell him what to
[10:05] do. You can just bring your petition
[10:08] with faith
[10:10] believing it will come to pass.
[10:13] And every prayer God answers. Sometimes
[10:17] is wait a little a little bit. Sometimes
[10:20] is yes right away. Sometimes it's no.
[10:24] But whenever as a true Christian,
[10:27] whatever God's perfect will is, we want
[10:30] that to be what? To be there in our
[10:32] lives.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; Even though true sunshine or rain,
[10:36] whatever, whatever it takes to please
[10:39] God, that's what I'm willing to do.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; I'll trade sunshine for rain.
[10:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:48] &gt;&gt; I'll trade sunshine for rain. If that is
[10:50] his will, I'm willing because life is
[10:54] short. You here today, you gone
[10:57] tomorrow. I think it brings me to this
[10:59] thing that I want to read. Let me see
[11:02] this. I came across something like that
[11:04] here.
[11:06] Um, that's fine.
[11:14] That's okay. Does a place that
[11:23] That's okay. I don't have it. But
[11:25] there's a place that you are saying that
[11:27] life is short.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; You cannot even say you got to tomorrow
[11:32] be tomorrow is for you. Anything can
[11:35] happen at any time.
[11:37] &gt;&gt; So we got to be ready and just serve God
[11:41] the best that we know how because
[11:43] tomorrow is not for you.
[11:46] We all know what happened to our
[11:47] precious brother Kufi on that night.
[11:51] If it was his time, he would have gone
[11:54] just like that 2:00 a.m. in the morning.
[11:57] So tomorrow is not for you, it's not for
[12:01] me. So we got to be ready every time. We
[12:05] have to have spirit of forgiveness.
[12:08] Never hold anything or hurt against
[12:10] anybody regardless of the situation.
[12:13] Let love project and grace will takes
[12:18] over because you are there to receive
[12:22] this word of God. Amen. Our God is
[12:25] awesome. And then if you carry back, you
[12:29] carry the thought
[12:31] from Jesus Christ from the time of Paul,
[12:36] the church went into what?
[12:39] um dark ages and
[12:43] in those dark ages
[12:46] the Catholic Church they kill 68
[12:49] millions
[12:52] those
[12:54] is in first book of Matus and
[12:56] Inquisition Spanish Inquisition and all
[12:58] those places they murdered 68 million
[13:02] Christians who do not believe Catholic
[13:06] teachings which was contrary the word of
[13:08] God. So the church went what like in the
[13:13] dark ages but the Bible said that
[13:15] whatever the caterpillar has eaten the
[13:17] can has I will restored say the Lord. So
[13:22] during the restoration time, God raised
[13:24] up Luther
[13:26] and he was revealed to him that the just
[13:29] shall live by faith. And at that time,
[13:33] those attribute of God, those children
[13:36] of God who were ordained to life, they
[13:40] received what Luther said.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; They came out from the Catholic Church,
[13:45] received the word that came through
[13:47] Luther.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. And the gospel move on to who?
[13:53] Wesley sanctification.
[13:55] You got to live a sanctified life. Then
[13:58] it's preach to get rid of all the
[13:59] lipstick and all the immoral dressing
[14:02] and everything and be sanctified. Lead
[14:05] that clean life.
[14:09] And at that time
[14:12] those who are ordained to life, they
[14:14] followed that voice. And then it came to
[14:17] Pentecost,
[14:19] restoration of what? Of the gift.
[14:23] And they began to speak in tongues this
[14:26] that that and then they made the
[14:29] speaking in tones as the evidence of the
[14:32] Holy Ghost.
[14:34] But
[14:35] the Bible, the Bible didn't say the
[14:38] speaking in tones is the evidence. It's
[14:41] a gift of the Holy Ghost.
[14:44] So the gospel has to move and God sent
[14:47] us a vindicated prophet William Myron
[14:51] Braham.
[14:53] He fulfilled
[14:55] Malachi 4:5,
[14:58] Revelation 10:7, Amos 3:7,
[15:02] um Luke 17:30,
[15:05] so many scriptures.
[15:08] And what happened? Because
[15:13] the people at his time,
[15:16] those who were not ordained to life,
[15:19] they love the part of the healing. When
[15:23] he was sending the people to their
[15:25] churches, they were so happy receiving
[15:28] them. But when it came to the revealing
[15:30] of the word, when the seas were open,
[15:33] when he began to tell them that women
[15:35] should not preach, you have to have um a
[15:38] deacon should be a man of wine wife
[15:40] trying to set the church in order.
[15:42] Talking about the serpent seed, not
[15:45] apple, it was an adultery that caused
[15:48] the fall of man. He began to tell all
[15:50] the gospel truth. They began to get away
[15:53] from him. And when the final thing
[15:56] happened, the revelation of the seven
[15:58] seals. When the seven angels caught him
[16:00] up in the constellation to bring the
[16:03] seals,
[16:04] that was his third pool ministry.
[16:08] They didn't want nothing to do with him.
[16:11] But that was a crowning of his ministry.
[16:14] Amen. Ended. The sins were revealed. And
[16:19] it's been open from that time. Christ
[16:22] came down the sin. Christ has come down.
[16:25] He is the capstone the reveal that seven
[16:28] seals. Amen. And when that thing
[16:32] happened, he said I must decrease
[16:36] and Christ must increase.
[16:39] So what is happening is that
[16:42] there's a movement going on because we
[16:46] said if Luther
[16:50] people that follow Luther if they have
[16:53] received what Luther said and and also
[16:56] believe what God will reveal after they
[17:00] would have been in a better place. But
[17:03] they just make a doctrine out of that
[17:06] and and bust God in that doctrine. And
[17:12] Wesley did the same thing. And Pentecost
[17:16] did the same thing. But he said that you
[17:19] have to what? Receive what God has
[17:22] given. And because the gospel keep on
[17:25] moving on. He's the same yesterday,
[17:28] today, and forever. I'm not saying that
[17:31] he's going to give you something
[17:33] different. Whatever he's revealing going
[17:35] to line up with the word, but you can't
[17:37] limit God because he's the same
[17:41] yesterday, today, and forever. And the
[17:43] mistake that some people make is that
[17:49] as Elijah cried out, where is the God of
[17:53] Elijah?
[17:55] He was looking for the same spirit
[17:59] that was in Elijah. That God that was in
[18:03] Elijah is what Elisha cried for. So the
[18:06] bride will always cry for the same God
[18:10] that was in the pro because remember he
[18:12] said that your servant Moses is dead.
[18:16] Joshua be that courageous and move on
[18:20] with the word of God. And Joshua types
[18:22] the Holy Ghost. So we gone past baptism
[18:26] with the Holy Ghost. It's now the Holy
[18:28] Ghost himself in the bride riding the
[18:32] trail once more because the bride and
[18:35] the Christ become one. The husband and
[18:37] the wife is one. Eve was the same
[18:40] material for Adam. And that same God is
[18:44] here. He's the same yesterday, today,
[18:47] and forever. He didn't use other
[18:48] material. He's the same in the bride and
[18:51] the spirit. will say exact same thing
[18:54] because in the same spirit that raised
[18:57] up Christ is in you, it also resurrect
[19:00] what your your your mortal body. Amen.
[19:04] Because the same God, God hasn't
[19:06] changed. Now they're looking for Jesus
[19:08] Christ on the cross, but they forgot
[19:11] that now he's in the body.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; He's in you, brother Mike. He's in you
[19:15] here. Amen. Jesus move. And the people
[19:19] that have some people have missed that
[19:21] change.
[19:23] They miss that change that um what am I
[19:27] saying? They miss that manifestation
[19:30] or they miss the promise for the age
[19:34] because remember it happened the
[19:35] Pharisees and they said this. They were
[19:37] looking to the letter, but the letter
[19:40] has put on the flesh
[19:42] &gt;&gt; and they crucify the flesh that the
[19:45] letter has put on. And I'm afraid the
[19:49] same thing is happening now. Some people
[19:53] are crucifying Jesus Christ in the flesh
[19:56] without even not knowing it because he's
[19:59] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[20:02] You are part of him, part of the
[20:06] attribute of Christ. He's in you. He's
[20:09] in me. He's the same yesterday, today,
[20:12] and forever. Let me see if I can find
[20:14] this. Amen.
[20:16] Hallelujah.
[20:19] He said that not all men will receive
[20:22] Christ. Oh no. But those which God for
[20:26] ordaining life is housed around some of
[20:29] the death of the earth. That's the one
[20:31] he comes to quicken. They are the ones
[20:36] that now that death will lay there in
[20:38] the sun and say, "Oh, this old sand is
[20:40] too hot. That rock say this old son is
[20:43] too hot." But that little seed said,
[20:46] "That's what I'm looking for." And begin
[20:48] to spring forth to life. It quickened
[20:51] that part of the death because the son
[20:54] was sent not to quicken the rock, not to
[20:57] quicken the dead but to quicken the life
[21:00] of the seed. So if that life of the seed
[21:03] is in you, you will recognize what God
[21:06] is doing now.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; You won't put him in the past.
[21:12] You will not misplace that word of God.
[21:14] You'll not dis dislocate it because he's
[21:18] the same yesterday, today, forever.
[21:21] Everyone who is ordained to life will
[21:24] recognize what Christ is doing in his
[21:28] age.
[21:30] That's the time that we are living in is
[21:32] a bright age, a bright time. Remember
[21:36] that um the wave chief
[21:40] when the Israelites when they get their
[21:43] first fruits the the chief the priest
[21:46] wave it he doesn't wave it on the
[21:50] seventh day
[21:52] but what the first day which comes back
[21:55] the eighth day.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So now is a mighty
[22:01] angel in the bride of Christ doing the
[22:05] exact same thing he did because
[22:10] except he said except a wheat of corn in
[22:13] the ground what it abides alone. So
[22:16] Christ he died on Calvary just to what
[22:20] multiply himself. So now a true
[22:24] Christian have become a hot potato in
[22:26] the hand of the devil because first he
[22:29] only have the Lord as one person to deal
[22:31] with but now he has but everybody the
[22:34] bride in a many member body so he
[22:37] doesn't know what to do.
[22:40] Amen. And that God is in you is in me.
[22:42] He's the same yesterday today and
[22:45] forever. Amen. So, I think I'm going to
[22:49] wrap it up very soon with this here. Let
[22:53] me see.
[22:55] Amen. Hallelujah.
[22:58] Yeah. Wrap it up right now. He's the
[23:01] same yesterday, today, and forever. He's
[23:06] on time. God. Hallelujah. God is good.
[23:10] So what I'm trying to say is that you
[23:13] have to have confidence
[23:17] in and in God that is inside of you.
[23:21] Don't underestimate yourself
[23:25] because it's not you
[23:28] but Christ in you the hope of glory. He
[23:32] is the one living your life through you.
[23:34] You see we get become it become a burden
[23:38] on us
[23:40] when we try to do things by ourself
[23:45] trying to fulfill it by our own self.
[23:48] You can't do it by your own self but
[23:52] allow him and recognize that he's inside
[23:56] of you doing the things. And when you
[23:59] come down in the middle of it, he will
[24:02] manifest himself because the true bride
[24:06] is not just a church member.
[24:09] Some people think that church attendance
[24:12] will put their name in it. It's good to
[24:16] come to church. Don't get me wrong,
[24:19] but you must be in the mystical body of
[24:22] Christ.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; That's the main thing. You must have the
[24:28] Holy Ghost.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Before I preach, I always used to have
[24:33] if I become a preacher, I always going
[24:35] to preach about the Holy Ghost
[24:38] because that's your token.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; That's your everything.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; You must have it. You must receive it.
[24:45] You must know what Christ is doing. And
[24:47] you have to live it in your life.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; You got to have that. If you don't have
[24:53] it, you miss the main thing.
[24:57] Amen.
[24:59] Hallelujah. Our God is awesome,
[25:02] &gt;&gt; brother Mike. So, I think I'm done for
[25:04] the day. Just a little exaltation. I
[25:07] hope that it blesses and helps somebody
[25:09] because our God is on time. God is the
[25:12] same yesterday, today, and forever. He
[25:15] hasn't changed. Amen.
[25:34] Amen.
[25:36] Praise the Lord.
[25:38] How do you believe that he's here? I
[25:41] mean, believe that that the present
[25:43] stage of his ministry is that he's come.
[25:47] But where did he come to? Let's all
[25:49] stand. He came to me.
[25:53] [Music]
[25:56] He came to me.
[26:03] When I could not come
[26:07] to where he was,
[26:11] he came to me.
[26:17] That's why he died
[26:22] [Music]
[26:24] on Calary.
[26:28] [Music]
[26:30] When I could not come
[26:34] to where he was,
[26:38] he came to me.
[26:41] One more time, everybody.
[26:43] He came to me.
[26:47] Thank you, Lord.
[26:50] He came to me.
[26:54] [Music]
[26:57] When I could not come
[27:01] to where he was,
[27:04] he came to me.
[27:09] [Music]
[27:10] That's why he
[27:13] [Applause]
[27:14] [Music]
[27:24] could
[27:26] [Music]
[27:31] he came to me.
[27:36] Oh, I got to prove
[27:40] I'm one in a million.
[27:44] I got to show
[27:47] the power of the blood.
[27:52] I got to prove I don't belong in Satan's
[27:56] e.
[27:58] I've got to show that I'm a person. This
[28:02] world isn't worthy of again.
[28:06] Oh, I got to prove
[28:10] I'm one in a million.
[28:14] I got to show
[28:16] the power of the blood.
[28:21] I got to prove I don't belong in Satan's
[28:28] got to show that I'm a person.
[28:33] [Music]
[28:35] Oh, we are the ones who are going to
[28:38] stand.
[28:40] Keep our testimony clean
[28:44] in the midst of an unbelieving world. We
[28:47] keep looking to the unseen and really
[28:51] know that we will overcome
[28:57] and receive his promise.
[29:02] I strong.
[29:05] Oh, I got to prove
[29:08] I'm in a million.
[29:12] Yes, I got to show
[29:14] the power of the blood.
[29:19] I got to prove I don't belong in Satan's
[29:24] evil
[29:25] [Music]
[29:27] that I'm a person.
[29:30] One more time. Yes. I got to prove. Oh,
[29:34] I got to prove
[29:37] I'm one in a million.
[29:41] I got to show the power of the god.
[29:48] I got to prove I don't belong in Satan's
[29:53] evil.
[29:54] I got to show that I'm a person. This
[29:58] world isn't worthy of
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:04] And uh as uh brother Tim often says, he
[30:07] changes it and he says, "What are we
[30:08] going to prove?" Nothing. But there's
[30:10] one inside that's going to prove. And
[30:13] you got to identify with that one, and
[30:15] that'll be you proving that you're one
[30:17] in a million. All right. Praise God.
[30:19] You're dismissed. God bless you on this
[30:21] wonderful Wednesday night. And uh may
[30:23] the Lord uh bless your Thursday. Bless
[30:25] your day at work. Bless your day with
[30:27] that fella or that guy or that girl.
[30:30] Bless my day with that guy I was talking
[30:32] about tomorrow. Cuz I know you know what
[30:34] the darkness that that fella is in.
[30:37] A little bit of light creeped in today
[30:40] and and then he he he you can see that
[30:42] he was hungry. So let's see what happens
[30:45] tomorrow.
[30:46] How many believe God is more than able
[30:49] to do whatever he wants to do? He'll go
[30:51] just like he came to you. He'll go to
[30:53] somebody else. But how will he do it?
[30:56] Through a life lived. Not just words
[30:59] spoken, brother. Forget that stuff. They
[31:01] got they they got sick and tired of that
[31:02] stuff. It's everywhere. But this word
[31:05] lived and spoken will do marvelous
[31:08] things. Amen. God bless you. What a day
[31:12] that will be
[31:15] when my Jesus
[31:17] I shall see.

[31:26] saves me by his grace.
[31:30] When he takes me by the hand and leads
[31:35] me through the promised land,
[31:40] what a day,
[31:42] glorious day
[31:45] that will be.
[31:50] There will be no
[31:52] sorrow there.
[31:55] No more burdens
[31:58] to bear.
[32:00] No more sickness
[32:02] will be
