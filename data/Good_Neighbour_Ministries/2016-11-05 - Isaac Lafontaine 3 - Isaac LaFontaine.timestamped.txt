[0:00] knowled about the Battle he knew that
[0:02] somebody coming up there was going to
[0:03] take a few shots and they're going to be
[0:06] wounded so he knew to lay out a bunch of
[0:10] those Med packs so that when people get
[0:12] there they're going to need it right so
[0:16] I said all of that about video games not
[0:18] a blanket endorsement for video games I
[0:20] said all of that to say that as we
[0:23] progress forward on the
[0:24] battlefield we begin to realize that if
[0:27] we look close enough God has ahead of
[0:30] time and he's laid for you right there
[0:33] exactly
[0:42] what so it can feel like the most
[0:44] terrible thing in the world I cannot
[0:46] believe this has happening to me I don't
[0:48] understand you stop for a moment and
[0:50] begin to look around what was the pastor
[0:52] preaching this Sunday what was being
[0:55] said to me I open the Bible and I'm
[0:56] starting to read and a lot of times
[0:58] they'll give me exactly what I need
[1:00] right when I need and he lays those
[1:03] things in place and guess what it's a
[1:05] characteristic of him that he's such a
[1:07] planner that he's always going to come
[1:10] on the scene now a lot of times we say
[1:12] but that God can come on the scene and
[1:15] and do a miracle he can just show up we
[1:17] say oh God please come on the scene
[1:19] right now I I I need healing my daughter
[1:22] needs healing my son's got a fever or
[1:24] this is happening and we we we think in
[1:27] terms of calling him down from Glory
[1:30] and he goes all right I I'll come down
[1:32] and heal your son and he gets up off the
[1:34] throne and he comes down the the golden
[1:36] stairs or whatever and this is all
[1:39] denominational mentality that we have of
[1:41] him getting up and having to come on the
[1:42] scene every time we do that because we
[1:44] know from precedent from scripture and
[1:47] from the prophet of the hour we already
[1:49] know that if you
[1:52] believe your healing is already done
[1:55] yes so there's a med pack laying there
[1:58] with your healing
[2:00] if you believe it that's right
[2:04] right all things are possible to them
[2:06] who believe and the med Pack's just
[2:08] laying there yes Hallelujah and you're
[2:10] like Lord please come on the scene my
[2:13] son he's got a fever or my daughter or I
[2:16] need healing for this or we need
[2:18] financial help for this and all all the
[2:20] time the med Pack's laying right there
[2:23] why because he knew from the end he knew
[2:25] the end from the beginning and he saw
[2:27] exactly where you're going to be right
[2:28] now right
[2:30] laid the M back out there yes sir and
[2:33] that's how a guy who's a sound man and a
[2:35] musician like me can stand up here and
[2:37] deliver a message today to you and I
[2:39] don't feel qualified at all to do that
[2:41] but I have complete confidence that
[2:43] there's a reason that before the
[2:45] foundation of the world God looked and
[2:47] he saw this service am and he knew where
[2:49] you are right now he knew everything
[2:52] about what you're going through right
[2:53] now and he took a sound man off the
[2:55] soundboard at his own church today and
[2:58] he said I'm going to send that guy up
[2:59] there because he's going to say
[3:01] something that's going to present it in
[3:02] just a way and you're going to receive
[3:05] that I'm your med back amen
[3:17] amen so yeah I'm a little bit nervous
[3:19] but I know that this is how God works so
[3:22] I don't know what it is that I'm going
[3:23] to say I don't know what it is that's
[3:24] going to reach you and help you and
[3:26] encourage you I'm not sure which thing
[3:28] I'm going to say might be something
[3:29] about important something I don't know
[3:31] but somehow some way God has an order
[3:34] that he does things and he knows that
[3:36] this service is going to happen I know
[3:38] that he's going to feed his people and I
[3:40] know that if I can just yield myself
[3:42] just let my mouth talk and let God speak
[3:44] through me let it happen I know that
[3:47] you're going to be blessed whatever you
[3:48] stand in need of today whatever you're
[3:50] up against he's already provided
[3:53] for now does that not give you a lot of
[3:56] confidence no worries right not at all
[3:59] why wor worry why worry at all you know
[4:02] that everything that you're ever going
[4:04] to go through he saw I saw one Minister
[4:05] one time explained this way if I had a
[4:08] frame uh of a uh a picture print frame
[4:12] and I held it up here and you're looking
[4:14] at my beautiful face to this picture for
[4:17] me yeah it's
[4:20] beautiful you're looking at me and if
[4:23] it's a portrait you're looking at me
[4:24] just the way I am right you can see me
[4:26] from one Vantage Point kind of
[4:28] two-dimensional but if I go like this
[4:31] and I'm hiding over here then people
[4:33] over there that are looking through the
[4:34] picture frame they might not be able to
[4:35] see me through the picture frame the
[4:37] people over there can because their
[4:38] Vantage Point can see me over here so if
[4:42] you can imagine that this picture is
[4:45] time that we live in the beginning of
[4:48] time that we know it and the end of time
[4:49] as we know it here in this earth right
[4:52] and Eternity is happening all back here
[4:54] inside the picture so God can take the
[4:58] you have to look at the picture and see
[4:59] what it sees in this moment in this time
[5:02] but God can go poke his head through the
[5:05] picture frame and look back beginning
[5:07] way back before time began and he can
[5:09] look Way Beyond over there what's going
[5:12] to happen way over there and he goes oh
[5:14] way down there I can see that the
[5:15] picture looks pretty good right now
[5:17] they're all dressed up they're all at
[5:18] church this Sunday morning everything's
[5:19] going pretty good but I know that Monday
[5:21] afternoon about 2:00 this brother is
[5:24] going to go through this last night we
[5:25] had an incident going back over to
[5:27] brother Danny's house uh
[5:30] where uh I'm sure who who was it that
[5:33] almost uh that got hit at the light
[5:35] there there were two trucks could
[5:37] get your daughter was driving right so
[5:40] he knows at a certain time of night a a
[5:44] couple pickup trucks are going to blow
[5:45] right through a red light knows exactly
[5:48] what's going to happen so he looks down
[5:49] there he sees that happening and he says
[5:52] okay well I know that's going to happen
[5:54] so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
[5:55] anoint the dad to say to his daughter
[5:59] hey you know what when you're sitting a
[6:01] light before you just take off take a
[6:04] look around because a lot of times these
[6:05] people blow through lights moments
[6:09] before it
[6:11] happens so God saw the coming evil and
[6:15] he goes oh that's happening there I will
[6:17] anoint this dad to say something that's
[6:19] going to save their lives amen amen
[6:23] don't underestimate the ability of those
[6:25] things to happen put something on your
[6:27] heart to say go ahead and say that amen
[6:32] amen so I can have a lot of confidence
[6:37] in my actions and and going forward not
[6:40] because I have confidence in me as
[6:42] handsome as I
[6:44] am uh it's not necessarily me I can just
[6:47] stand here and just say God can use me
[6:49] to say something for you and I trust him
[6:51] to do
[6:52] so you to do the same thing in the next
[6:56] slide here it says God sees the
[6:58] beginning and the ending of all things
[7:01] for Adam and Eve he saw what was
[7:03] happening in the garden he knew exactly
[7:05] what was going to happen and he provided
[7:06] a way he knew all of the everything that
[7:09] was going to have to be apparatus
[7:11] because he knew the fall was going to
[7:12] happen he knew these things were going
[7:13] to happen because he knew the attributes
[7:15] of himself had to be expressed in the
[7:17] end time and he knew that he wanted to
[7:20] develop this he wanted to have children
[7:22] he wanted to do these things so all of
[7:24] this he sees it coming and he lays in
[7:26] place a way of Escape uh and a way for
[7:30] them to have
[7:32] Seth if you understand what I'm saying
[7:35] he provided a way in Noah's day he
[7:37] planted a bunch of trees which were
[7:39] exactly the kind of trees that no one
[7:41] needed right where he could find them so
[7:43] he could build an ark and Float out of
[7:45] the
[7:46] FL you can believe it or not believe it
[7:48] but he built a pretty big boat there's a
[7:50] lot of trees in that thing right he
[7:53] provided he naturally provided something
[7:56] in this three-dimensional way he
[7:58] provided something
[8:00] that will fulfill what was going to
[8:01] happen as a way of Escape amen for
[8:05] Joshua he did for Rahab think about this
[8:09] a prostitute and he provides a way all
[8:13] those walls fall down and she's able to
[8:15] walk out of there and coming from that
[8:17] lineage comes Christ and everything else
[8:20] he provides a way of Escape for these
[8:22] things everybody else in J would
[8:25] die for David
[8:30] David anointed as a little
[8:32] boy D wanted to anoint
[8:35] Saul and Prophet comes out and says that
[8:40] God wants to anoint this little
[8:42] boy he has another plan because he knows
[8:45] the end from the beginning he knows if
[8:47] I'm going to anoint somebody I'm going
[8:48] to do it this way and what happens you
[8:50] realize where this goes with Saul and
[8:52] everything like that and all of the the
[8:55] years that happened of Saul being the
[8:58] the leader of the Israelites right all
[9:00] of this time that he happens and all the
[9:03] bad things that happen and the victories
[9:04] and the good time all of that stuff is
[9:06] Just Happening Here on the Earth but the
[9:09] anointing happened way back when he was
[9:11] a child so God already laid in place who
[9:15] this King was way back when and then you
[9:19] watch it long enough and it becomes
[9:22] manifest and it was God laying in place
[9:25] way back from the very beginning one of
[9:27] my favorite things to consider and this
[9:31] is basically en
[9:33] Closing one of my favorite things to
[9:35] consider is how he lays in place
[9:40] something for the Gentiles and the
[9:41] reason I get excited about that is I'm a
[9:43] gentile the Gentiles right so you watch
[9:47] all the historical precedent all through
[9:49] the Old Testament of God's people the
[9:51] Israelites and they're going through the
[9:54] motions and and they're going through
[9:57] experiences and everything and it's
[9:58] written here in this Bible and then New
[10:02] Testament rolls around here and Jesus is
[10:04] born comes on the scene and has a
[10:07] sacrifice the lamb led to the slaughter
[10:09] we all know and Spills his blood for us
[10:13] spills his blood for his people and US
[10:15] everybody in the entire world and then
[10:18] establishes in the New Testament and
[10:21] acts two establishes a
[10:24] church and sends his holy spirit to live
[10:27] in the church to live in the people
[10:30] and when he does he establishes this
[10:32] church why because he's looking at seven
[10:36] Church ages that are coming down the
[10:38] road amen and he establishes this and he
[10:41] shows us exactly what it's supposed to
[10:43] look like right he lays it there in
[10:45] place and says this is my original
[10:48] thought for this church this is what I
[10:51] want it to be and
[10:54] immediately we start to humanize right
[10:57] you see right away in the first AG
[10:59] they're already starting to go back to
[11:02] organizing it they go oh great God has
[11:04] given us this church well the first
[11:05] thing we should do is uh get organized
[11:08] here and God said no I just showed you
[11:12] that this is how I want the church to
[11:13] operate I want it to be led by the Holy
[11:16] Spirit and right away we start to go
[11:18] into these things and we start to see
[11:20] great men like Paul and and uh the John
[11:24] the uh out on the aisle of patmas
[11:26] writing these things right and we see
[11:28] even some people that may not be
[11:30] mentioned necessarily in scripture like
[11:31] polycarpon he one of my favorite
[11:33] historical figures because these are
[11:36] guys that fought against the whole idea
[11:39] of organizing this thing becoming an
[11:41] organized church but we see the grace of
[11:44] God that he laid in place this is what
[11:46] this original church is supposed to look
[11:48] like and it will again come back to that
[11:51] in the end time but it's been his plan
[11:54] all along this is what I want so then at
[11:57] the very tail end of what this book book
[11:59] that we hold today is a vision that God
[12:03] himself comes and he says it to ascribe
[12:07] on the aisle of pus write these things
[12:10] and he writes the story of what's going
[12:12] to happen from then until
[12:15] now until the last day right amen so
[12:19] here's John the Baptist Sitting on This
[12:21] Island and he's sitting there and he's
[12:23] writing and there's the angel there's
[12:26] God right there telling this is I'm
[12:28] writing this down because I need to put
[12:30] all of this in place so that my people
[12:32] when they come up on whatever they come
[12:34] up on already know that this is set in
[12:36] place and we're going to be just fine
[12:38] everything's fine she establishes what
[12:40] the church is going to be says this is
[12:42] what it's going to be and this is what
[12:44] you're going to go through all of these
[12:45] times he shows you everything that's
[12:47] going to happen through all the seven
[12:49] Church ages Paul and irenius and Martin
[12:52] and Columba and Luther and West and all
[12:54] of these guys that come through they
[12:55] have the same interesting that they have
[12:57] the same characteristics and interesting
[12:59] that they're still buffeted against and
[13:02] they're holding back against organized
[13:04] religion they're holding back against
[13:06] the Beast system he wants to come in and
[13:08] pervert that original church that he
[13:10] wanted to create there and as it flows
[13:12] through there's ups and downs and
[13:14] there's almost utter darkness and
[13:15] there's a little bit of light here and
[13:17] and there's this battling back and forth
[13:19] and God always continued God always
[13:22] active term God always puts his man on
[13:24] the scene he keeps putting his man on
[13:26] the scene and although he may take his
[13:28] man off off the scene he never takes a
[13:30] spirit right so it just flows right in
[13:32] from this man to that man to this man to
[13:34] that man and then we come down to here
[13:36] in this day and age you realize what
[13:37] you're a part
[13:39] of you realize what you're a part of if
[13:41] you go back into HEI where HEI talks
[13:43] about being the messenger with a message
[13:46] for God's people that's where this
[13:48] started when you go and present the
[13:49] message to somebody and say look you may
[13:51] look it up online and you may say all
[13:53] kinds of different things about what the
[13:54] message is but the message is you with I
[13:58] with people all the time been around the
[13:59] message their whole life and if I ask
[14:00] them can you define what the message is
[14:03] Give me a definition in 30 seconds tell
[14:06] me what the message of the hour
[14:10] is well you know I think it'll take
[14:13] longer than that really like and we got
[14:15] to talk about uh brother brandom and we
[14:17] got to talk about God sending a prophet
[14:18] we got to talk about all these things uh
[14:20] we got to talk about the healing
[14:21] campaigns and then we got to talk about
[14:23] this and that none of which is the
[14:26] message then we got to talk about
[14:28] creating squirrels we talk about stories
[14:30] and we got to talk about this and that
[14:32] we got to talk about the S visions and
[14:34] we got to talk about the mountain range
[14:36] that has this and that none of which is
[14:38] the
[14:40] message people try to define the message
[14:43] by what's happening right now the
[14:45] message started way way way way back
[14:48] it's a concept that started way back in
[14:50] the Old Testament HEI says I am God's
[14:52] messenger and I have God's message and
[14:54] I'm bringing it to the people amen so
[14:56] you're part of something that's a
[14:58] message and what is God laid his church
[15:00] in place established it there's your
[15:02] medack this is what this is the original
[15:06] and if anything needs to be cut it's to
[15:07] be cut to fit that and he puts it right
[15:11] there and then he writes in the book hey
[15:13] guys because he never would allow you to
[15:16] go through history without having a
[15:18] warning and without having some kind of
[15:20] way of establishing of knowing where the
[15:22] truth was he's always going to provide a
[15:24] way remember so all of this stuff begins
[15:27] to happen in history and he's done both
[15:29] he's established the church that there
[15:30] it is over there and then he points to
[15:32] it and says scribe write this down
[15:34] there's the original church and this is
[15:36] what's going to happen you're going to
[15:37] go through all these ages and all of
[15:38] this stuff is going to happen and then
[15:39] you're going to get down to the last age
[15:41] and I'm going to reveal a bunch of stuff
[15:42] to you and we're going to get down to
[15:44] the end of this thing and what's going
[15:46] to happen is emerging from history this
[15:49] church over here will be the same as
[15:53] that original church that I told you to
[15:55] keep in touch with right back there this
[15:58] church will manifest what acts 238
[16:00] manifest because it has to because it's
[16:03] the Original Seed as it grows through
[16:07] the stages of the stock and the digging
[16:09] into the ground and hearing from the Sun
[16:12] and being drawn up watering and all of
[16:15] the things that happened to grow this
[16:16] thing eventually and then the shot comes
[16:19] up and everything like that but
[16:20] eventually emerging is the exact
[16:22] original SE that he said that's it and
[16:25] it pops up again here in the last day
[16:27] that's you
[16:39] because he's faithful to do it
[16:42] always so we've got our med
[16:46] pack there it is amen Hebrews 13:5 says
[16:52] let your conversation be without
[16:55] covetousness and be content with such
[16:57] things as you have
[17:00] for ye for he has said I will never
[17:02] leave thee nor forsake
[17:05] thee never he said he never would but I
[17:09] don't feel him very close I don't care
[17:11] what you feel
[17:13] respectful I don't care what you feel
[17:15] because he says I'll never leave you or
[17:19] forsake
[17:21] you Philippians 1 six be confident of
[17:25] this very thing that he which had begun
[17:28] a good work in you will perform it until
[17:32] the day of Jesus Christ amen
[17:35] am amen amen has he begun has he begun

[17:58] hand

[18:07] I'm sorry but what's so great is at the
[18:12] beginning of the work when I was there
[18:14] when I was way back there he began a
[18:16] work and then he keeps fulfilling
[18:18] fulfilling fulfilling fulfill and you
[18:20] know what he is going to see it
[18:22] completed all this to your complete
[18:26] Perfection like absolute perfection un

[18:31] this original idea that God had when he
[18:33] established this church and you're

[18:37] manifest 2,000 years later you're
[18:41] manifesting the Original Seed that's
