========================================
God bless their behind me. Praise the Lord. [Music] You're worshiping him, Lord. Can I just sing? You're worshiping every [Music] single song. and sing. [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh, [Music] and beneath the [Music] [Music] [Music] mighty might be rej. Glory. [Music] [Music] Merc. [Music] [Music] And there my savior [Music] [Music] shall and all that cheer [Music] to Sing [Music] the [Music] to no And we backgroundise. Praise the Lord. Once again, we have come to the Lord's house on the Lord's day to partake of the Lord's table. Not in by tradition, not in ignorance, but with a clear revelation of what this all means. [Music] The scriptures of course tell us what it is. Now, these uh two brothers are going to serve the Lord's supper. [Music] One will go forth on one side with the bread. Please hold on to it while the other is serving on the other side with the wine. And after both sides are finished, then the wine will come to you. And the ones who have no bread will also receive the bread. Once everybody has their portion, you hold it in your hands and then after which we will take it together. Is that right? Please do not take it before because Paul said what? Have you no houses? He says did you eat before you come? Right. So let's wait one on the other and take the Lord's supper together. Amen by the grace of God. After they've done that, we'll worship for a while and also we're going to stop a chance to pray. examine yourself and then after which we will greet each other in Christian love and then I it's on my heart to pray for Sarah Brandon today. So if you don't mind I'll pray for this one individual. So, I'm not forming a prayer line, but just this individual has been on my heart, and I'm going to anoint her with oil and pray for her. Yes. And when I'm doing it, I want you to agree with me. Right. Agree with me that God will completely heal and deliver this young woman to a full life. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Because God has promised to the world they shall lay hands on the sickness and the promises they shall recover. Hallelujah. We obey the word by laying on the hands. Amen. and we believe the recovery to him. But we believe that he said also where two or three are gathered together in my name and they pray and ask together for anything it shall be believing of course it shall be granted. Do you believe that? Amen. Do you believe there's power in prayer? Amen. Believe prayer changes things. Amen. Hallelujah. Your prayer can change you from sickness to health. Yes. Amen. From want to prosperity. Amen. Every blessing that's in your heart, there is power in prayer. Brother said, you know, if you know that prayer brings God's blessings down, then why don't you pray, pray, pray for prayer brings God's blessings down. Amen. Is that right? So let's bring down the blessing of God upon the Brennan family and especially upon this young woman. Hallelujah. Amen. In the name of Jesus Christ because we believe in a miracle working God. You have seen it in this church where women that were pronounced by the doctors to be barren for the rest of their lives have born children. Yes. You have seen those sitting, not all of you, but some of you that are here have seen people that were sitting in wheelchairs upon. Amen. And they're still running today. Yes. We mention it over and over because it's a testimony of a woman with her leg. The doctor give up the flesh eating disease, eat out half of it, and she's ready to go. No answer. And God stopped them in distress. Yes. Is that right? Amen. We've seen the hand of God. Amen. So we believe and if you can believe all things are possible to not believe in the simplicity of this sacred moment the great physician can do anything and anything can happen. I've told you before. I've been to services like this just talking like that and boom, all of a sudden man coughs up against why the cancer was scared of the revealed word. Is that right? Amen. Praise the Lord. And the same way in a service just talking on the word. I'm glad to be here. Not even preaching yet. I say I'm glad to be here. It's nice to be in the country and you know God is still the same yesterday. Boom. The Holy Ghost drops. Tongs break out. People fall on the ground, men run to the altar. Just like that. See, God is able to do it. Rain can come out of the sky just like that. Is that right? Only believe. All things are possible to them that believe. We don't have to work ourselves into it cuz the word the word is here. Amen. We believe God's word. Gracious heavenly father, bless the rest of this service. Breast of God's blessing. Oh, gracious eternal God. So grateful father, so thankful for making a way for us to give this love supper. Lord, we pray oh God that you bless the bread as a presentation that when we take it all that are sick will be healed. May the sick be healed, may everyone be blessed. We thank you and we pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. And now we ask our brother Christopher from long to ask God's blessing upon the wine. And it's real wine. It's not grape juice. It's real wine. It represents the stimulating effects of the Holy Spirit, the new wine that is in our life. Gracious God and heavenly father, we heard your word today say without the shedding of blood there is no remission for s and dear heavenly father this wine which represent your blood father Lord you died to shed your blood for our sins Lord and as we partake of it Lord let oh God let healing take place let deliverance take place Lord as we Believe Lord Father all things Lord are possible to them that believe Father Lord bless this vine Lord Father sanctify it Lord as we partake of it Lord Jesus we commit each and everyone in your hands in Jesus name amen [Music] praise the Lord you may proceed uh to serve the elements to God's people rather you go on this side I'm going you Ser just pass the over brother and the brother is on the other hand to take [Music] the same position.

This is my body which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me. Shall we all stand? Those of you who are partaking this is the bread. Take eat for this represents his body that was broken for you. away from the bridge. [Music] [Music] After the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sought saying this cup is the New Testament. In my love, our redemption was written in red. Yes. With the blood of Christ. Hallelujah. This do ye as often as you drink it. Why? In remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come. Wow.

Let us take the coin with the understanding and the revelation of this hour. God richly bless you. Take it together. We are one in Christ. Let us bow our heads and pray while I pray. Our gracious heavenly father on this sacred Sunday, we come to your table as guests who have been invited to come and we are not resting or trusting in our own worthiness but we trust in the worthiness of Jesus Christ. And as we look and as we have partaken of the emblems of our Lord's death, may we remember why he died that dark day on Calvary. That he died to cleanse us. He died to heal us. He died to satisfy your judgment and your righteousness. your justice and we remember his eternal love and the boundless grace of a God rich in mercy. May we receive the assurance that we are forgiven. Amen. And that we are the possessors and beneficiaries of eternal life. Hallelujah. And that now in us dwells the home of glory. Amen. Glory. As the bread and the cup nourishes our body, so may your spirit strengthen our soul until the day of your coming. When we will hunger no more. We will thirst no more. No more pain, no more sorrow, no more sickness. And we will sit with you at the heavenly table in the presence of our Lord saying hallelujah right now. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.

We want to thank the Lord for a wonderful Lord's supper. want to thank the Lord that uh he saw it fit to visit with us and to give us signs of his presence. Amen. Just like I told you, it's as simple as that. One time I was in a service just again talking about the Lord. But it's when you're talking with revelation, that's right. Uh you're not you don't have to be sculpting big deep stuff. It's because of what's in you. And the Holy Spirit fell like that. And to my surprise in this message, I thought the pastor would rejoice and he said, "Oh my God, I was so scared. I felt chills going up in my spine." He was in the message and he never heard speaking in tongues. Wow. Never saw the Holy Spirit fall like that out of a pure blue sky. Never really had the experience, but he was preaching. the message. We got to come back to the word. Amen. Listen, if this church is the true church, it has got to produce another book of Acts. Thank you, Jesus.

And I'm going to ask um a precious sister. She's here. She Praise the Lord. I do right under my eyes. Praise the Lord. If I was not sure of that, I would see. But that's what happened. We got to try in this life not to be too lifted up. That's right. Cuz then we don't see what we need to see. Amen. The great Let's sing. He was for our transgression. [Music] He was broken for our transgressions. Yes, he was [Music] surely [Music] and by his [Music] we The price for healing was paid for healing. I lost true again just [Music] [Music] perfect. Oh yeahior. Too late. Everybody [Music] might [Music] surely. He wants to [Music] see our father in the name of Jesus who died for our sins and rose again. Amen. Isaiah 53. He was woken up for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him. And by his stripes, his suffering, he was made sick that we may be well. He bore pain that we may go free. He took all of this upon himself and according to his word by faith that the Holy Spirit lives in me and lives in this congregation. As we pray together, I lay my hands upon this precious sister. Make this gospel real to her. Amen. In a way that shall never forget it. Yes. Remember her in this hour. Yes. May the power of God, the presence of the Holy Spirit lead my body and by my hands being laid upon her, I transfer this anointing and this power from me to her into her being now from the crown of her head to the sole of her feet to cleanse the blood in her body to cast out every virus and every germ, every contamination Hallelujah. To heal every organ and to bring complete and total deliverance for the glory of almighty God that for years to come. Many will say, "I was there that day when our sister Sarah Bre was healed by the power of God. A miracle took place." And they'll talk about the miracle of Sarah Bre. Ladies might be my victory in your hand right now. Spirit of the living God, come upon her. Save her. Yes. Heal her. Yes. Make her whole. Let the doctors wonder and marvel. Amen. Let me serve a miracle working God. Amen. Amen. And amen. Father, a prayer anoint me to be able to dedicate her babies. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In the name of Jesus. Receive me. Hallelujah. Amen. If Jesus himself was here, Amen. He couldn't do anything else. That's right. Because that's what he said in his word. Amen. Amen. You genuinely do believe that trust God and throughout her live a full and complete life for his glory. God bless you. [Applause] I know that there are other sick troubled and tribes within the congregation. I pray a general prayer. Yes. But in another service, I'd love to have a healing service where we lay hands and pray for all those who have sickness, troubles, trial. And while you're waiting, remember this. The trials only came to test you. That's right. The burdens didn't come to break you. Amen. But to mend you. Yes. Sometimes God brings these things to give us a new perspective. Amen. That we might have the chance at a new beginning. Yes. Amen. Is that right? You know, sometimes you got to start your Christianity all over again because you thought you had it, God, you knew it and then you found out you didn't have. Amen. So, we want to start all over again. God bless each one of you here today. Sisters downstairs for the washing of the saint's feet. Brothers upstairs for the washing of the saint's feet. Of course, we are doing it by the commandment of the Lord. And uh it has significance. I've said it through the years. I repeat it again. It's not something that the other church is just pushing aside. But there was a meaning to it that whether you are rich or you are poor. Amen. Whether you are high or you are low, the Lord's supper is meant to let us remember where he came from. Is that right? Amen. Cuz here is a rich man have to bend down and wash a poor man's feet. Amen. I'm not talking about the pope now. That's just a fact. Right. Uh but yes, because God is showing you got to stay humble. That's right. Right. And in the old Pentecostal days, they said be humble or you're going to stumble, right? You humble yourself and allow the Lord to make you humble. Doesn't matter if you have billions of dollars because uh blessings, money, power, influence. It brings a certain thing that if you don't watch it, it brings arrogance. Yes. Brings pride. It brings a sense of power, control, but that has got to be under the hand of God and the direction of the Holy Spirit with the character to be able to use it for his glory. So he he's given this Lord's supper and the washing of the saints feet to constantly remind us that we we are blessed to be a blessing and we are called to serve. Yes. Is that right? Amen. That's what it is about. Also, as believers together, we are to look out for each other and wash one another's feet. You see, back in those days, they um they would go to the Roman baths and they may even take a shower. to maybe take a good bath there which is a symbol of your washing away s. But then when they finish at the Roman bath, they got to walk home. Yes. We all got to walk and get to heaven. Is that right? And in walking home, they didn't have Cadillacs and and Tesla cars and Toyotas on the road. The mode of transportation was camels, donkeys, horses, and these horses and these donkeys and camels, they operated on what we know today as methane gas. [Music] In other words, they let out a lot of stuff on the streets. And back then we didn't have boots and they didn't have boots and covered shoes like we have. They wore sandals. Just cut a piece of skin, put two straps, tied it around your leg just to keep thrs from, you know, going to your leg. So as they would walk out on the dusty street, they just washed. They're clean. And now they're walking on the dusty street and they're talking to their friends, happily going home. And before you know it, they step right into a fire of dogma. They got to take their foot out now and go to their home. If they're wealthy, they have a push footwash blocky to wash their feet. And that's why Jesus took that role of taking the towel to show you that if he could humble himself to be a footwash donkey for all of us. Amen. Go you and do likewise. Yes. Is that right? Amen. Can you be a footwash donkey for him today? Amen. Amen. Can't you get to a place where, oh, I'm not washing her feet because of this that I know of or or she did this or he did that. I'm not going to wash his feet. Nobody's going to get me. You see, the Holy Spirit was not to so cleanse your heart. That's right. To a place where you are in a state of unconditional love. Is that right? Yes. I don't care who it is, but you love everybody. That's right. So, let's wash the saint's feet. And by doing that, what you're doing is our daytoday walk. We already saved. We already been washed. But you got to walk every day on this road going home to glory. From time to time, you may step into something nasty. [Music] And sometimes you can't even wash it yourself. You need a brother or a sister to encourage you, to help you say the right amen, and wash that thing off for you. Say, "Brother, you're free. Don't go around believing that you're condemned. You're free." Sometimes it takes a brother or sister to say that. Is that right? So, let's do that here today, one for the other. God bless you, sisters. I'm going to pray the closing prayer for the service so that when you go downstairs wash the saint's feet, you're free to go. Brothers, same ups here. Amen. Our gracious God and heavenly father, we thank you for this for your wonderful presence, Father, for visiting with us and making us feel alive. Thank you for the indwelling spirit. Bless each one here today. Quicken us more and more to thy word. Open up our understanding. Father, as we go to wash the saints feet, Father, remind us where you brought us from and show us where we could appear and make us a blessing one to the other in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. God bless you before you leave because next Sunday next Sunday will be our church Christmas dinner which we have every year but it will be next Sunday after the service. However, because they have a policy that at 5:00 p.m., no one can go into the building before 5:00 p.m. So, I would like to put the service instead of 11 to put it at 1 Yes. I didn't Sunday school. Thank you, brother. I didn't really look at this. I just glanced down, but I didn't look at it. We spoke about it, but I'm just I like to be free so I'm just talking. Yeah. So at 1/3 there will be the service so that the service takes so many hours by then you're finished. There's just a small gap in there. Uh if you want to catch a Tim or something light before you get over there for 5:00, then uh that would be a lot better than you know the service ending real early and you got 5 hours or 4 hours in between and not knowing what to do. Okay. So, the service will start at 1:30
