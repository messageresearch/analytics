[1:32] may the lord bless us all together my
[1:35] subject for today
[1:36] is perverted tastes
[1:40] perverted tastes a scripture
[1:44] is found in john
[1:47] the gospel of john
[1:51] chapter 7.
[1:54] reading from verse
[1:58] 30 7.
[2:02] in the last day the great day of the
[2:05] feast
[2:06] jesus stood and cried
[2:10] saying if any man thirst
[2:13] let him come unto me and
[2:17] drink he that believeth
[2:20] on me as the scripture hath said
[2:25] out of his belly shall flow
[2:28] rivers of living water
[2:31] but this speak he of the spirit
[2:34] which they that believe on him
[2:37] should receive for the holy ghost was
[2:40] not yet given
[2:41] because jesus was not
[2:45] yet glorified thank
[2:48] god for the reading of his word which is
[2:52] the breaking of the bread of life to our
[2:56] hearts
[2:57] praise god thank god amen
[3:02] yes sir we thank god for the lord jesus
[3:05] because we know that he
[3:08] is the one as the scripture says john 3
[3:11] 16 a very common verse
[3:14] god so loved the world that
[3:18] he gave his only begotten
[3:21] son that whosoever
[3:26] believeth in him not
[3:29] on him but in him should
[3:32] not perish but would have
[3:37] eternal life thank god
[3:41] that he gave of that
[3:44] life or of that water of life
[3:48] amen and he gave it to a thirsty
[3:52] perishing people of that particular
[3:55] age you say brother simon well how did
[3:58] he do it
[4:00] he did it by
[4:04] being crucified allowing himself to be
[4:06] crucified on calvary
[4:09] and allowing his own and poured out his
[4:13] own blood
[4:15] he did not spill his own blood
[4:18] for spilling his blood that could be an
[4:21] accident
[4:22] he did not accidentally do this he did
[4:25] not accidentally die for your
[4:28] sins he purposely had a mission to die
[4:32] he had his purpose and his
[4:36] purpose was redemption through blood
[4:39] and so he gave his life as a ransom for
[4:43] many
[4:44] he is the one my brothers that literally
[4:48] poured out his life the waters
[4:52] of his life the water the life of course
[4:56] is
[4:56] in the blood and he poured it out
[5:00] with an intentional act
[5:03] of giving his life for others
[5:06] that he might be the fountain of life
[5:10] and also the bread basket
[5:13] of life oh hallelujah as
[5:16] david said oh this man
[5:20] was born there little bethlehem
[5:25] least among the tribes
[5:28] least among the cities of judah
[5:32] but oh thank god the wheat
[5:35] basket the wheat a basket of israel

[5:42] spiritually
[5:43] jesus the bread basket of the
[5:47] entire world that we can feed upon him
[5:51] and the waters from the well types
[5:54] though
[5:55] he is the water of life to quench
[5:58] all of the thirst of the entire
[6:03] human race jesus
[6:06] born at bethlehem a bethlehem
[6:11] there he was cradled
[6:14] or in the hay cradled
[6:18] with the yoke they cl

[6:24] there but thank god he's looking for
[6:28] another place to be cradled here today
[6:31] oh my god hallelujah
[6:34] and to think that my god chose me
[6:37] chose you to come in and dwell in our
[6:41] hearts
[6:42] cradle himself within these
[6:46] stinking sinful hearts transformed by
[6:49] the power of god
[6:51] changed by the blood of jesus christ to
[6:54] a place where he can come
[6:57] and cradle himself within
[7:00] our hearts that he might display
[7:03] from us the pouring forth
[7:07] of the waters of life to to the
[7:10] perishing
[7:11] people that are around us that they

[7:32] god may he find a dwelling place
[7:37] within the manger of your heart
[7:40] and my heart praise god now
[7:44] from the text we read on the last day of
[7:48] the feast

[8:00] every one of you who that you're
[8:03] thirsty come you can drink
[8:06] and when you drink out of your bellies
[8:10] will flow rivers of living
[8:13] waters of course they did not understand
[8:17] but he was speaking of the spirit of
[8:21] almighty god
[8:23] that would when it comes in to build the
[8:25] believer
[8:27] it will just overflow itself
[8:31] and pour out upon all those
[8:34] around it praise god hallelujah

[12:12] soul with a spring in your step oh my a
[12:15] smile on your
[12:17] face and the grace of god bubbling up
[12:20] within you
[12:21] amen hallelujah thank god
[12:25] brother sister god created
[12:28] man to have a thirst
[12:33] to have desires within them
[12:36] and that thirst is a creation of god
[12:41] that god himself allowed to be
[12:45] within your heart
[12:48] right or wrong is set before each one of
[12:51] us
[12:52] the tree of life and the tree of death
[12:56] or of knowledge
[12:57] of good and evil is set before
[13:00] all of us as it was in the garden of
[13:04] eden
[13:06] and god has made us to thirst
[13:11] and many take that blessed holy thirst
[13:15] or desire or taste that god
[13:19] placed within them to curse
[13:22] after him and begin to
[13:26] thirst long desire
[13:29] and lust after the things that are
[13:33] in the world now there's a great
[13:36] uh man called plato
[13:40] many of you may or may not know of plato
[13:44] plato had this theory which of course
[13:48] is in the bible that man is a tree part
[13:52] being you're made up of three parts
[13:55] soul spirit and body
[13:58] so plato brought forth the
[14:02] theory that each part of the human
[14:06] being has appetites
[14:09] thirsts or desires tastes
[14:14] things that come from within you
[14:18] and as i four said god placed in man
[14:22] natural appetites natural
[14:25] thirsts and tastes
[14:28] and certain we find out friends
[14:31] that god has given us the desire to have
[14:35] food you can't go without food
[14:38] you can't live on air oh
[14:41] my yes man has made
[14:44] this made to be a social being
[14:48] and to have fellowship one with the
[14:51] other
[14:52] that is why isolation
[14:55] is a punishment when
[14:59] people are isolated oh my
[15:02] think of it because man was made
[15:05] to be a social being a
[15:08] man was made with sexual
[15:12] desires for sexual reproduction
[15:16] that is desire placed there in
[15:19] man giving them desire
[15:22] to love and to be loved
[15:26] god has given us that desire
[15:31] but what satan has done
[15:34] and is doing he has perverted
[15:38] these natural tastes desires and
[15:42] appetites
[15:43] that god has given to man
[15:47] and twisted them like he did eve
[15:50] away from the word to knowledge
[15:54] of good and of evil and the wisdom of
[15:57] this world
[15:59] and lead men and women
[16:02] astray from the things of god
[16:07] that instead of them having a source for
[16:10] god
[16:11] they are for the word
[16:14] they have a thirst for the world
[16:18] and the things that are of
[16:21] the world and so he puts a thirst in the
[16:24] people to run to
[16:26] night clubs and to cocktail parties
[16:30] and to live immoral and
[16:33] drink drugs smoke
[16:37] and that thirst is in there
[16:42] given to you by god but satan
[16:45] twists it around to the
[16:48] evil and to the wrong things
[16:52] and you will never be satisfied by such
[16:55] things
[16:57] i said you will never be satisfied
[17:01] until you come and drink from
[17:04] christ the fountain of eternal life
[17:08] that's flowing here today to fill your
[17:11] soul and satisfy your longing
[17:14] meet all your needs praise god and place
[17:18] you to a place my friends
[17:20] ah where you are alive because the devil
[17:24] is deceiving the people that now you're
[17:28] living
[17:28] now you're drinking now you're smoking
[17:30] now you're womanizing
[17:32] yeah now you're a harlotry around and
[17:36] uh going here and lying and cheating and
[17:40] do whatever you have to do
[17:42] now you're living but god's word says
[17:45] now you're
[17:46] dying now you're dead for he he
[17:49] or she that liveth in sin is dead
[17:53] even while they think they are
[17:56] alive oh praise god my brothers my
[18:00] sisters
[18:01] hallelujah we look to god
[18:04] the order of eternal life praise
[18:07] god when we are truly born again
[18:11] and have the artisan well of the holy
[18:14] spirit pouring forth from within our
[18:18] souls
[18:19] then my friends it's it's a living
[18:22] fountain
[18:24] because it's flowing day and night
[18:27] glory to god hallelujah you don't have
[18:30] to wait
[18:32] for uh for another local church revival
[18:37] in other words just church and advertise
[18:39] we have a revival
[18:41] but that's a local church revival meant
[18:44] for their local church

[18:49] invite you to
[18:51] this revival for this certain brand of
[18:54] church i want you to invite you to this
[18:56] certain
[18:57] brand of church they have a revival over
[19:00] there
[19:01] we're not talking about that kind of
[19:03] revival
[19:04] we're talking about a god-sent
[19:06] heaven-set revival
[19:08] that reaches out to one and all
[19:12] and when the rain falls it doesn't
[19:15] discriminate
[19:16] it doesn't fall in one one place here
[19:19] and one church
[19:20] and avoid the other no it falls
[19:23] everywhere
[19:24] but as if you want it if you want it
[19:28] some people put up an umbrella because
[19:30] they don't want the holy spirit
[19:33] reign of the open word to fall upon them
[19:36] but they want to protect themselves and
[19:39] run from it
[19:40] and run and hide but to the true
[19:42] believer
[19:43] we don't have to wait on any local
[19:47] revival drummed up with the preacher
[19:50] coming with revival in his suitcase
[19:52] and when he's stepping that pulpit and
[19:54] open that suitcase revival jumps out
[19:57] oh no the revival is a heaven-sent
[20:00] revival

[20:39] vindicates itself by
[20:42] saints by wonders by miracles by
[20:45] supernatural occurrences
[20:48] which you may think it's an accident or
[20:51] or it's a coincidence it's not a
[20:54] coincidence

[22:51] a personal private secret relationship
[22:56] within your heart that you enjoy
[23:00] between yourself and the lord
[23:03] jesus christ oh praise god satan's prime
[23:09] activity one of his prime activities
[23:13] i say friends is to pervert
[23:18] the original taste that god place
[23:22] in man when man was created
[23:26] perverting human thirst
[23:30] and desire away from the natural
[23:33] appetites
[23:35] to unnatural appetites remember
[23:38] satan is not a creator so he already he
[23:42] has to take what god already has made
[23:45] and then mess it up take a life that god
[23:49] has made
[23:50] clean pure mess it up
[23:54] that's what he does god gives us all
[23:57] natural
[23:57] taste as human beings natural desires
[24:02] and
[24:02] appetites and satan comes along with a
[24:06] temptation
[24:07] with a loss with a lie with some
[24:09] cheating
[24:11] and turns on our perverts
[24:15] that natural taste and causes
[24:18] you to use it for something
[24:22] contrary to the word of god
[24:27] listen friends
[24:30] this time that we're living in
[24:33] young men young women they're getting
[24:37] old before their time
[24:41] some of the men young men young women
[24:45] they get to 2025
[24:50] and some of those young women
[24:53] are already entering into menopause
[24:58] how shocking you say brother simon how
[25:02] is that what's doing it
[25:03] let me tell you it's the hybrid food
[25:07] the hybrid food that they are feeding
[25:11] the people
[25:12] is causing this kind of thing to go on
[25:17] yes the life that the people are living
[25:20] today
[25:22] is influence because you become
[25:25] what you eat and so they eat perverted
[25:29] food and they end up living perverted
[25:32] life and it's uh the scientists
[25:37] splitting all these things and doing
[25:39] that
[25:41] brought us to this where they're
[25:43] literally
[25:44] killing you with hybrid food
[25:47] and in the churches this is what has
[25:50] happened
[25:51] the high breeding of the word of god
[25:55] they're mixing in man-made material
[25:59] along with the word of god
[26:03] and feeding that to you and when you're
[26:07] eating it it
[26:08] tastes like the word of god
[26:11] but at the same time you're taking in
[26:14] some
[26:14] man-made material and then what does it
[26:17] produce
[26:18] a perverted christ-so-called christian
[26:22] life
[26:22] a perverted representation
[26:25] of christ which is contrary
[26:29] to the word of god amen
[26:32] listen it's the hybrid food
[26:35] the hybrid spiritual preaching
[26:39] that's producing a bunch of hybrid
[26:43] church members claiming
[26:47] that they are really christians but
[26:50] that's not different than
[26:52] some of the oversized turkeys
[26:56] that they hybrid the turkey instead of a
[26:59] normal natural turkey
[27:03] or a normal natural chicken
[27:06] that's the meat is tight and sweet
[27:09] uh all to the taste they pervert it
[27:13] so they can uh profit and make money off
[27:16] of
[27:16] it so they can uh reproduce faster
[27:20] and they can grow bigger and have more
[27:22] pounds
[27:23] so they can make more money
[27:26] yes sir and this is what happens
[27:29] and then the turkey can hardly walk
[27:32] because
[27:33] it's carrying so much weight and
[27:36] it's so heavy and the hands the hands
[27:40] and the under all the chickens become
[27:43] so heavy because of the
[27:46] hybrid food it's not the bird's fault
[27:50] it's the kind of food that they're
[27:53] feeding to those birds
[27:55] and it's the kind of fifth uh
[27:57] foolishness
[27:58] fed to church members the hybrid
[28:02] nonsense that's being fed to them
[28:05] causing them to get big in the head
[28:08] filled with pride filled with self until
[28:11] they're falling over
[28:13] they can hardly walk the line straight
[28:16] they can hardly have a
[28:17] balanced christian life but other than
[28:20] that
[28:20] they're falling off left right and
[28:23] center on the
[28:24] extremes everywhere amen
[28:28] yes sir oh can't hardly
[28:31] reproduce themselves and there they find
[28:34] they got to have some kind of a a
[28:37] religious
[28:38] geological pill to wake them up
[28:42] or a pill to put them to sleep appeal
[28:45] to make them feel high and holy
[28:48] appeal for this and appeal for that but
[28:51] we got the power of
[28:53] god in a word of god that will lift your
[28:56] heart your soul
[28:57] for he said who everyone to me that
[29:01] thirst at
[29:02] oh drink from the waters and
[29:05] then you will never thirst again
[29:08] and out of your belly will flow rivers
[29:11] of
[29:12] living waters oh hallelujah praise
[29:15] god amen brother sister
[29:18] science civilization
[29:24] and human education
[29:27] now i'm not saying that education is
[29:30] wrong
[29:30] but i'm saying that they're putting all
[29:33] kinds of stuff
[29:34] in there and leading men
[29:37] astray from the word of god
[29:40] and teaching your children all kinds of
[29:43] things
[29:44] contrary to the word of god
[29:47] and the human race is being destroyed by
[29:51] this
[29:51] we destroy ourselves just like
[29:55] the dead mother eve there in the garden
[29:59] of eden and it's running on like that
[30:02] even on to this day as i've said before
[30:08] man is made with natural appetites
[30:13] and one of those appetites we are made
[30:15] to thirst
[30:16] we are made to thirst desire or have a
[30:20] taste for we have all a desire
[30:24] for love to love
[30:27] and be loved there's nobody i know
[30:31] not human they may say they don't
[30:34] desire that but we all have a desire to
[30:38] to be loved and
[30:41] to love because that's a natural
[30:44] god-given desire that he has placed in
[30:48] us
[30:49] and so it's not wonder or secret
[30:53] that young men and women in particular
[30:57] in the prime of their lives they
[31:00] thirst for love
[31:05] that thirst in their desires
[31:08] to love one another
[31:11] as the songwriter says someone
[31:14] to care someone to
[31:18] share all my struggles
[31:21] like no other can do
[31:25] you'll come down from the skies
[31:29] wipe the tears from your eyes
[31:33] you're his child and he cares
[31:37] for you hallelujah
[31:42] amen so it's not true
[31:46] for women to love man and man
[31:49] to love woman amen and
[31:53] we thirst and have this desire
[31:56] within us and satan
[31:59] takes that and perverts it
[32:03] and creates immorality
[32:06] creates all manner of adultery
[32:10] fornications causes all
[32:13] manner of sexual sin oh
[32:16] my friends let us pay heed to the word
[32:20] of god
[32:21] we see another uh thirst god has placed
[32:26] in the human race is a thirst
[32:30] especially in women these days
[32:33] you can't be too sure about that it may
[32:35] cross over
[32:36] and even go to some men but that thirst
[32:40] to be beautiful
[32:43] women source for beauty
[32:47] and it's natural for them to have that
[32:51] taste and that desire
[32:55] listen uh doesn't matter whether they're
[32:58] young
[32:58] or how old they get how many he how much
[33:02] here
[33:02] or or how little here they have on their
[33:05] head
[33:06] they still are built by god
[33:09] and made that way to have
[33:13] a thirst for beauty
[33:16] and it's a natural thing for a woman to
[33:19] want to look
[33:21] pretty because it's a god-given
[33:24] instinct that god has placed within
[33:29] the woman and god gave her that beauty
[33:33] for her particular mate
[33:37] that she already has or that she will
[33:40] meet later on but god
[33:43] gave you that beauty for that one mate
[33:48] that you're going to meet someday
[33:50] sometime
[33:51] or the mate you already have your beauty
[33:54] is for
[33:55] that person that god gave it to you for
[33:59] and so women want always
[34:02] to be beautiful and pretty
[34:06] and it's not wrong for a woman
[34:10] to want to be beautiful
[34:13] or pretty now i'm just saying my friends
[34:19] christian women i don't believe they
[34:20] should go around
[34:22] with their face all made up
[34:26] and when i say that i'm not talking
[34:28] about makeup
[34:30] i'm saying they're not to go around with
[34:32] their face
[34:34] like grim uh their face
[34:37] looking as we say the mother the kid
[34:39] said gross
[34:42] unnatural out of thought in other words
[34:45] they
[34:46] think by making their face serious
[34:48] making their face
[34:50] grim they're trying to provide
[34:52] themselves
[34:53] us a form of protection to push away
[34:57] anybody or any man any person
[35:01] that would look at them they they throw
[35:03] them off
[35:04] by making their face turn and cream
[35:07] and made up like that but god didn't say
[35:11] that that's what you have to do because
[35:13] that's not making yourself pretty that's
[35:14] making yourself petty
[35:16] but not pretty my brothers and sisters
[35:19] god
[35:19] wants us the women in particular
[35:24] to be beautiful
[35:27] and to be pretty god is not not against
[35:31] that
[35:33] he just doesn't want you
[35:36] to take satan's lie
[35:40] and for satan to come
[35:44] and to pervert that beauty and turn it
[35:47] to worldliness
[35:48] and to the chains of the world as he is
[35:51] doing to the
[35:52] entire human race at this particular
[35:55] time
[35:56] oh stay with me my friends give me a
[35:59] break here let me preach the word of
[36:01] god i trust you will open your hearts to
[36:04] receive the word of god for today
[36:07] some of you may not like it the way i
[36:09] say it
[36:10] but i've got to say it because it's in
[36:13] the bible
[36:14] it comes from the last day prophet it's
[36:17] thus saith the lord
[36:18] it's the saiyan the scriptures this is
[36:21] what we are here for
[36:23] judgment begins at the house of god
[36:26] you got to let the word of god judge you
[36:29] while you're here on earth in the church
[36:33] so that as the scripture said so later
[36:36] on when the
[36:37] real big judgment come you shall
[36:40] not be judged because you've already
[36:43] been judged by the word
[36:44] come my brother come my sister and let
[36:48] the word of god go through your life
[36:50] amen and judge you cleanse you and make
[36:54] you
[36:54] what he wants you to be oh praise god
[36:58] satan has perverted the beauty of women
[37:02] today
[37:04] until he's letting them become so
[37:08] unnatural and then turn around and
[37:11] tell them that is beauty
[37:16] be a model and you can be beautiful
[37:20] be like this dress like that
[37:24] use this certain fashion use a certain
[37:27] color
[37:28] whatever and
[37:31] what is he doing he is perverting the
[37:36] natural or at least playing on the
[37:39] natural appetite or desire
[37:42] god has in your heart and then he's
[37:46] trying to pervert it away
[37:48] from the word of god
[37:51] into the world and the things of
[37:55] the world but his perverted
[37:58] kind of beauty that worldly so-called
[38:01] prettiness
[38:03] is unnatural unholy
[38:07] and it's the most horrible thing that
[38:09] you could think about
[38:11] that a person can walk around like that
[38:14] unnatural out of
[38:18] kilter totally out of balance
[38:21] with life and with the word of god
[38:25] hallelujah you say well brother simon
[38:28] if a woman wants to be pretty if a woman
[38:32] wants to be beautiful
[38:34] and has the desire to do so what should
[38:36] she
[38:37] do your answer is in the word of
[38:40] god it's there in first timothy
[38:44] 9 let the women adorn
[38:49] themselves in modest
[38:52] apparel having a christ-like
[38:56] spirit that's the way
[38:59] the woman should quench her source of
[39:02] being pretty
[39:03] amen in other words your beauty
[39:07] is not so much an outside beauty
[39:10] even though you will have that which she
[39:13] dress
[39:13] modestly with modest apparel
[39:17] hallelujah beautiful
[39:20] amen but the real beauty
[39:24] is a christ-like spirit
[39:27] that is projecting out of that woman
[39:30] that is her real beauty pouring out of
[39:33] her
[39:34] christ in you your beauty christ in you
[39:39] hallelujah your everything praise
[39:42] god you want to be pretty get into
[39:45] christ
[39:45] you want to be pretty follow the word of
[39:48] god
[39:49] the way it should be followed that's the
[39:51] way you can
[39:52] make yourself pretty with a christ-like
[39:55] spirit
[39:56] and dress yourself with modest
[40:00] apparel hallelujah oh
[40:03] my oh i'll tell you what a perverted age
[40:07] we're living in
[40:09] an age where you can hardly
[40:11] differentiate
[40:13] between male and female
[40:17] some of the most horrible looking things
[40:20] you see around you
[40:21] and in the streets when you look at them
[40:25] sometimes they look like an
[40:27] alien from outer space some
[40:31] not even human anymores beyond human
[40:35] ice painted that way lips painted that
[40:38] way
[40:39] listen let me say something here before
[40:40] i continue to speak
[40:43] source people have a
[40:47] right to paint themselves
[40:50] pierce themselves do whatever they want
[40:55] it is their freedom their right and
[40:58] their liberty
[41:00] and i have nothing to do with that they
[41:03] can do that if they want
[41:05] they can twist if they want they can
[41:08] wear all the pants that they have
[41:10] dragging down they can have the chicago
[41:14] walk the special kind of swagger
[41:17] that they they can go with that's their
[41:20] right
[41:21] amen but i also and we as christians
[41:25] have a right also
[41:26] we have the right not to want that
[41:30] we have a right not to desire that and
[41:33] we have a right to also
[41:35] say to us that is wrong
[41:39] to us we don't want it we don't want to
[41:43] see it we don't want to have it
[41:45] we don't want to wear it we don't want
[41:47] to be like that
[41:48] and we have a right to say that too so
[41:51] i'm speaking about our
[41:52] rights amen but those people have their
[41:56] rights
[41:57] that's up to them if they want to live
[41:59] that way but we choose
[42:01] not to live that way i want god's way to
[42:04] be
[42:05] my way throughout my entire life
[42:08] walking in the light of the word of god
[42:11] and not to go around
[42:14] man and even women
[42:18] or i should put it the other way women
[42:21] and even
[42:21] men having
[42:25] lizard looking eyes
[42:28] paints all kinds of
[42:32] things provided by satan and his
[42:34] factories
[42:35] that he enriched a lot of people with to
[42:37] create these
[42:38] uh so-called products
[42:42] that will make you deceive women and
[42:45] deceive
[42:45] men by putting on these
[42:50] painted masks that they wear
[42:54] and a funny looking slanted
[42:57] lizard eyes and eyelashes
[43:02] and so on contrary to the word of god
[43:06] the wearing of all kinds of funny
[43:08] clothes
[43:09] my god they'll sell you a dress that
[43:13] will
[43:13] hardly cover anything that's that small
[43:16] and tell you three thousand dollars
[43:20] for that dress because i'll tell you my
[43:23] god are we becoming like the king that
[43:26] is told the story
[43:27] when the devil will lie to you and tell
[43:29] you that you are
[43:31] well dressed and you're not even dressed
[43:34] amen
[43:34] the king had no clothes and they
[43:38] deceived him and told him
[43:40] he was dressed and that's what the devil
[43:43] is doing today
[43:44] in the world today deceiving the people
[43:47] that they are dressed when they are not
[43:50] he is tripping them and they are ending
[43:52] up undress and
[43:54] dog meat within the world that we are
[43:57] living in god have mercy
[43:59] because we are surrounded by perversions
[44:03] when we have women desiring to have
[44:05] their
[44:06] hair long and reaching out for the bible
[44:10] says a woman's hair
[44:12] is her glory and she is not to cut it
[44:15] off
[44:17] but we find today some women
[44:20] want to shave it all off because it's
[44:22] it's it's
[44:23] it's like it makes me look with the
[44:26] times
[44:27] it's more modern i noticed this
[44:30] fimstar she wore that style
[44:34] and so they go after that instead of
[44:36] looking up the word
[44:38] of the living god oh my
[44:41] and then we have the men out there
[44:45] that bangs and
[44:48] whipped uh rollers in the hair
[44:52] and with earrings nose rings
[44:58] and everything else man and woman
[45:01] that think it's beautiful a little
[45:03] diamond here
[45:04] a little gold here a little dot there
[45:07] oh my nothing is wrong with someone
[45:11] or wearing an earring or somebody
[45:14] wearing rings or something of that
[45:17] nature
[45:18] but i'm trying to show you it's gone
[45:21] into the realm of perversion
[45:25] amen all kinds of piercing whether on
[45:28] your belly button whether it's a
[45:31] piercing on your ears or your
[45:34] nose and nostril and all these things
[45:36] praise
[45:37] god hallelujah brother sisters
[45:40] complete perversion everywhere
[45:43] when we can have men wearing rollers
[45:47] in the hair out there satan
[45:50] is the perverter
[45:54] satan i said is the perverter
[45:58] of the human taste and turning
[46:01] men away from god may i repeat
[46:05] first timothy 2 9
[46:09] our sisters having the desire to be
[46:11] beautiful
[46:12] pretty the bible said let the women then
[46:16] adorn
[46:17] themselves in modest apparel
[46:21] with a christ-like spirit
[46:25] oh hallelujah milk
[46:28] and subject to their husbands
[46:32] subject to your own husband not subject
[46:35] to somebody else's husband
[46:37] or somebody else's friend or boyfriend
[46:41] or young man or young woman but subject
[46:45] to your husband your own husband
[46:49] amen hallelujah that's the way
[46:52] that you are to adorn your life and a
[46:55] way
[46:55] for you to live just a minute let me
[46:57] touch on something here
[46:59] when it says to be meek
[47:03] and to subject yourself to your husbands
[47:08] it just doesn't mean that you must be a
[47:09] pain in the neck
[47:11] in other words that uh the the woman
[47:15] should be the neck that thinks she
[47:17] always has to turn the head
[47:20] he he just happened to be the head but
[47:22] i'm going to be the neck
[47:24] and i'm going to turn him which side i
[47:26] want to turn him
[47:27] god didn't say that in his word amen
[47:32] listen god put the man to be the head of
[47:35] his home
[47:36] and to be the priest of his home
[47:40] the leader of his family
[47:43] and if there's any men listening to me
[47:45] here god didn't
[47:47] ask you to be some limp loose leaf
[47:50] god didn't ask you to be a mango but to
[47:53] be a man
[47:54] and to stand with the word of god and to
[47:57] have the spirit of a man exuding from
[47:59] you
[48:00] now let me balance that with this
[48:04] god wants the woman to be meek
[48:08] but god didn't take the woman
[48:11] my friends and turn her for you to turn
[48:14] her into a dish rag
[48:16] so that you can have her under your feet
[48:21] and you can step on her walk on her
[48:24] abuse misuse her in any
[48:27] possible way no we are not to do that
[48:32] mentally physically or any other way
[48:34] but the bible tells us in the book of
[48:36] genesis
[48:38] god gave the woman to be a help meet
[48:41] or a mate to help you
[48:45] as you both walk along life's road
[48:48] can two walk together except there be a
[48:51] greed
[48:52] the bible says one cord will be broken
[48:56] but a twofold cord will not be
[48:59] easily broken and the two shall be
[49:02] one flesh and that's going to be oneness
[49:05] when they are together when they work
[49:08] walk
[49:08] think talk and like that together
[49:11] then there's a oneness unbreakable that
[49:14] comes between them
[49:16] a love that grows between them
[49:19] and takes them right on walking
[49:22] down the road of life and when they look
[49:25] back
[49:26] my friends they can only see joy and
[49:29] peace
[49:31] and their offspring will bless
[49:34] them and thank them and praise them
[49:37] for what god has used them to do
[49:40] within their lies amen
[49:44] yes that is satan's job
[49:49] that he goes on with this to pervert
[49:51] your desires
[49:53] pervert the tastes of man and
[49:56] women amen to
[50:00] working giving your your body certain
[50:02] kind of
[50:03] lusting and temptations and desires and
[50:07] appetites and
[50:08] giving your spirit your mind mentally
[50:11] all kinds of pictures all kinds of
[50:14] different desires and stuff like that
[50:16] he plays on that and he will play on
[50:20] your
[50:20] spirit amen play on your
[50:23] body also perversion
[50:26] amen and that's what the
[50:30] nations of the world have taken
[50:32] perverted tastes
[50:36] perverted desires contrary to the word
[50:39] of god
[50:40] back to the bible back to the word of
[50:43] god
[50:44] back to the original faith stand upon
[50:48] the promise for this hour
[50:50] watch what god will do hallelujah
[50:53] they took the virgin
[50:56] thirsting to be pretty thirsting to be

[51:07] thirsts for
[51:08] joy everybody thirsts for fellowship
[51:11] hallelujah all these truths god
[51:14] put them into us but a lot of people try
[51:17] to satisfy that by
[51:19] partying they're gonna get joy in the
[51:22] jump up
[51:23] joy in the jazz they're gonna have joy
[51:26] like that twisting and twirling somebody
[51:30] else's
[51:31] wife round and round they go turn
[51:34] foot your partner to the left turn heart
[51:37] then to the right
[51:38] oh my god have mercy what a wicked
[51:42] devilish world that we are living in oh
[51:45] my god may he help us here today amen
[51:50] god made us to thirst for
[51:53] him we have to thirst
[51:56] after him and not allow the devil
[52:00] to twist the thoughts of our minds and
[52:03] of our hearts
[52:04] to thirst after something else
[52:08] and to pervert your proper
[52:11] desire and your proper thirst
[52:14] away from that amen hallelujah
[52:19] praise god may god help every
[52:22] one of us here today listening to the
[52:25] word of god
[52:27] god wants us to thirst for him
[52:31] and not for the church
[52:34] hallelujah next week
[52:38] we have mother's day
[52:41] and after that we will
[52:44] pick up this thought from another aspect
[52:50] and go forth in the name of the lord
[52:53] conquering with the word of god
