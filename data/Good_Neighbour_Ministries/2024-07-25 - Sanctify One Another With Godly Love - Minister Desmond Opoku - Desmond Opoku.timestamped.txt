[22:43] 33 submitting yourself one to another in
[22:48] the fear of God wives submit yourself
[22:53] unto your own
[22:55] husband as unto the Lord
[23:00] for the husband is the head of the wife
[23:04] even as Christ is the head of the church
[23:07] as he is the savior of the body
[23:11] therefore as the
[23:14] church subject unto Christ so let the
[23:18] wives be to their own husband in
[23:25] everything husband love your wife
[23:28] even as Christ also loved the church and
[23:32] gave himself for it that he
[23:36] might he might
[23:39] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[23:43] of Water by the word that he might
[23:47] present it to himself and glorious
[23:50] church not having sport or
[23:53] wrinkle or any such thing but it should
[23:57] be holy holy and without brish so so
[24:02] ought men to love their wives as their
[24:05] own bodies he that loveth his wife
[24:10] loveth himself for no man ever yet hate
[24:15] his own flesh but nourisheth and
[24:19] cherisheth it even as the Lord the
[24:26] church as even as the Lord the church
[24:31] for we are members of the body of his
[24:36] flesh and of his bones for this cause
[24:40] shall a man leave his father and mother
[24:44] and shall be joined unto his wife and
[24:48] they too shall be one fresh this is the
[24:51] great mystery but I speak concerning
[24:54] Christ and the church nevertheless let
[24:57] everyone
[24:59] of you in particular so love his wife
[25:02] even as himself and the wife see that
[25:07] she
[25:08] reverence her husband may the Lord add
[25:12] his Blessing to the reading of his word

[25:53] bypass what is written in his word
[25:58] very difficult for us to sub submit
[26:01] ourself to one another or the
[26:04] husband Hallelujah it takes God to do
[26:09] that
[26:11] Hallelujah without submitting submitting
[26:14] or grow or giving up your will to the
[26:18] Lord you cannot be a Christian a good

[30:44] were
[30:46] coequal they were all one one fresh if
[30:50] you read Genesis
[30:52] 5 five today I'm going to read a little
[30:55] scriptures here because everything that
[30:58] we talk based on
[31:00] scriptures Hallelujah the scriptures is
[31:04] the word of God this is our pattern
[31:07] without the word of God we cannot move
[31:10] nowhere Hallelujah this is our
[31:14] life Hallelujah you take this from every
[31:17] Christian he's no more a Christian thank
[31:20] you Lord Genesis Genesis uh 5 1 and 2
[31:36] this is the book of the generation of
[31:38] Adam in the day in the day that God
[31:41] created
[31:43] man in the likeness
[31:45] of God made he him male and female Ted
[31:51] he them and blessed them and called
[31:55] their
[31:56] name Adam
[31:59] so both of them were Co
[32:04] equal because
[32:07] Adam Eve was in Adam Hallelujah so they
[32:14] were all Co equal no
[32:18] more this and
[32:20] that hallelujah praise the
[32:23] Lord blessed be the name of the Lord
[32:28] how did Adam get into
[32:31] trouble I think everybody know how Adam
[32:34] get into trouble by
[32:37] who Adam get into trouble by
[32:41] who
[32:44] woman without woman we cannot
[32:48] live but at the same time there are
[32:52] fresh they are one praise the
[32:56] Lord how how did the church got into
[32:59] trouble by who woman the
[33:04] church because
[33:07] woman type the
[33:09] church
[33:11] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[33:13] Lord why why they get in trouble because
[33:16] God put this
[33:20] word that the day that you eat that tree
[33:24] of good and knowledge and Evil
[33:28] you shall surely
[33:30] die
[33:32] so the church right now they took what
[33:40] knowledge theolog uh what what do you
[33:43] call it
[33:45] intellectual and
[33:48] knowledge the same time is good at the
[33:52] same time it's evil and the church took
[33:55] that so God has to come down and
[34:00] separate the same way that he did he
[34:03] separate he separate the Eve from Adam
[34:08] hallelujah thank you
[34:12] Jesus if a woman refuse to submit
[34:16] herself to the husband is what trouble
[34:21] trouble in the
[34:23] house trouble in the home
[34:28] it doesn't mean that the man should
[34:31] doesn't mean that she should lay on the
[34:33] floor for the man to walk on
[34:36] her he is part of your
[34:40] body they have because Adam there's
[34:46] nowhere in the Bible where you heard
[34:51] that Adam hat his wife or he say
[34:54] something to her that hurt her they were
[34:57] in love
[34:59] Harmony so you have to love your wife no
[35:04] matter what circum sometimes comes your
[35:06] way you have to love your wife you know
[35:11] why excuse me because maybe the Lord
[35:14] want to drink a littleit
[35:19] water

[35:29] no matter what happen you have to love
[35:32] your
[35:33] wife the wife has to love the
[35:38] husband because
[35:42] remember we are God's
[35:46] Property and God has given your wife as
[35:52] his property to take care of her the
[35:56] same time the woman God has given your
[36:00] husband to take care of
[36:03] him whatever you do unto one another one
[36:08] day you go into anything that okay this

[36:15] care of you for me and I will come back
[36:19] I will come back and check it out how
[36:21] you how you treated the the property how
[36:25] how how how how it is whether it's good

[36:33] another you have to
[36:35] remember we are God property your wife
[36:39] is God property your husband is God
[36:42] property and you put on your hands so
[36:45] one day when we cross over you and your
[36:48] wife are going to meet the Lord himself
[36:50] and you are going to come account for
[36:52] one another how you treated
[36:55] her and how you treated him
[37:00] Hallelujah when we read the Bible he
[37:02] said what he said is born of your bone
[37:06] fresh of your
[37:08] fresh you know sometime the way we live
[37:12] our life at
[37:14] home affect our
[37:17] children as husband and
[37:21] wife you cannot just always curse here
[37:26] and bring good things here it cannot
[37:30] work for my understanding as a Christian
[37:34] you have to say good things to your
[37:37] children you have to say good things to
[37:40] your wife you have to say good things to
[37:43] your
[37:45] husband you know marriage is not
[37:48] something that you pick
[37:50] up it's something that you pick up God
[37:54] gave it to you it's two different
[37:56] characters
[37:57] are going to meet together no matter
[38:00] what the circumstance you're going to
[38:02] get ation somewhere
[38:05] somehow that's where God comes in
[38:09] because when you were married he said in
[38:11] love in death you would be with her
[38:15] Hallelujah my when a man is going to
[38:18] marry a woman they
[38:20] said the family the tradition they
[38:25] said If a woman get riches he bringing
[38:30] home if he get Adept he's going to the
[38:34] husband that's what they said you stick
[38:39] together no matter what circumstance
[38:42] comes your way you're going to
[38:44] leave back home when I was growing up
[38:48] the men they used to treat men
[38:51] differently when the woman doesn't
[38:53] listen they use their hand that's
[38:56] totally Rong but the woman will pack her
[39:00] bag and everything and run out go to the
[39:03] mother and father's home where their
[39:06] parents
[39:08] live the mommy and the father will ask
[39:11] them say no you has to go back to your
[39:15] husband when you B together marriage is
[39:18] not
[39:20] something that you're going to run away
[39:23] from it work it out you have to work it
[39:27] out
[39:29] Hallelujah no matter what situation
[39:31] comes you have to work it out how you
[39:35] are your appearance to your children or
[39:38] your grandchildren is very very
[39:41] important how you solve problem in front
[39:44] of your children is very import very
[39:48] very important why nowadays some of the
[39:51] children don't want to marry no
[39:54] more because some of them what they saw
[39:58] at
[39:59] home how they live
[40:02] together they get
[40:04] scared so they don't want to approach
[40:08] it but we Christian God has given us
[40:11] something
[40:13] special so we have to hold it
[40:16] tight and work it
[40:19] out because God Is Watching Over Us the
[40:22] same time he's
[40:24] watching his church
[40:28] Hallelujah you know when the church went
[40:32] chaos he sent the prophet to
[40:36] come and take the bride out from
[40:39] there Hallelujah so right
[40:43] now we are the bride you know back home
[40:47] when they not back home even here when
[40:50] the woman doing something they get
[40:52] something called
[40:53] s they just take take they put there
[40:57] they mix they blend something and they
[40:59] put in the water everything and the see
[41:02] and all the the the remaining stick
[41:06] inside there and they take the good part
[41:08] the water clean part that's what God has
[41:11] done for us he came down he he see all
[41:15] the the the church and now we are the
[41:19] good part there he put us here so we are
[41:23] the one who is going to stay with
[41:26] examples but example start from where
[41:29] home not only church
[41:32] Hallelujah the church is our Gathering
[41:36] Place hallelujah thank you
[41:46] Lord as I said you will never read
[41:50] anywhere Adam struck his wife or Eve
[41:54] struck his the husband but let me tell
[41:57] you
[41:57] in this morning age here where we are
[42:01] living now when people people can come
[42:04] in the church and sit down here clean
[42:08] clean clothes God bless you my brother
[42:11] God bless you my sister when they get
[42:14] home and let it count my brother and my
[42:19] sister you wish you can even get your
[42:22] ear to
[42:24] hear one thing
[42:28] we have to learn in the
[42:31] marriage
[42:34] is you don't compare somebody to your
[42:38] wife or to your
[42:41] husband he is good as he is she is good
[42:46] as she is that's why God joins you
[42:50] together it doesn't matter what a poor
[42:54] or Rich handsome whatever is
[42:58] you you belongs to one
[43:01] another stay close stay
[43:05] TI Satan always tried to set a trap for
[43:10] us not for out there for out there he
[43:13] know he got them we are the one Satan is
[43:17] trying to set trap every little thing
[43:20] that he going to get
[43:21] it so what I tell you is stay close to
[43:25] one another
[43:27] don't
[43:29] say bad things anything that is not good
[43:33] to one another and then you come you
[43:37] know why sometimes so many people so
[43:40] many Brethren their prayers they can't
[43:43] get answer for their prayers it's what
[43:46] they talk it's what they bring out there
[43:49] is a different story when they come to
[43:52] the meeting or in the church it's a
[43:54] different story you say you say another
[43:57] word over here and you said another word
[44:00] over
[44:01] here it's you don't know which one you
[44:04] talking
[44:05] about you curse here and you breast here
[44:09] it cannot
[44:12] work that's why I said today my message
[44:15] is strange we talking I'm talking to one
[44:18] another we are talking to one another
[44:21] because the the church start from home
[44:24] and we have to leave here and the life
[44:27] that we live is going to reflect what we
[44:31] claim to
[44:32] believe it's very very very
[44:36] important our children sometime why our
[44:39] children cannot stay
[44:41] here we Cur
[44:44] them you going to be this you going to
[44:46] be this and tomorrow you're going to
[44:49] turn around and say something good about
[44:51] it they say they see each and everyone
[44:56] is guilty I am guilty everybody's guilty
[45:00] Hallelujah because sometimes Satan come
[45:03] and struck us
[45:04] heart and we forgot we forget who we are
[45:09] and get
[45:10] overboard and these children when they
[45:12] growing up oh cuz as a child always when
[45:17] your daddy and your mommy say something
[45:20] sometime is stick in your mind and Satan
[45:24] love to bring that memory back all the
[45:26] time
[45:28] Hallelujah so it's very very important
[45:32] we we are getting old you see my belly
[45:35] my body was not like that was flat now
[45:38] it's clean but now I'm
[45:40] going you young
[45:44] people stay with the word of God you
[45:47] haven't got married yet you're going to
[45:50] get married and all these things has to
[45:52] be taught so that you can take lesson
[45:56] from what we went to you will never
[45:59] see since I've been in this message you
[46:02] will never see brother Simon will ever
[46:06] even Fellowship will talk about his
[46:09] children he always say good things about
[46:12] them how they they pressing did this did
[46:16] this let us say the same thing to our
[46:20] children stop saying negative
[46:25] things about our children children say
[46:28] good things to one another as a church
[46:31] so that we can grow one another as a
[46:34] church so that we can pray together with
[46:38] a cleansing heart so that God will come
[46:41] in and what and manifest himself Among
[46:45] Us each and everyone want to see God
[46:48] manifest himself Among Us right if you
[46:52] live right and nothing hinder there
[46:55] because what what Satan that every time
[46:57] you made a mistake even when you praying
[47:01] in the middle of prayer that thing comes
[47:03] down and it's hitting you he still
[47:06] confusing
[47:07] you if we live
[47:12] together in
[47:14] love we sanctify one another with love
[47:18] it doesn't matter who your children home
[47:22] your brother your sister Hallelujah
[47:30] remember when Moses make just one
[47:34] mistake and
[47:36] struck The
[47:38] Rock in the
[47:41] wilderness and God never forgave him God
[47:45] never
[47:47] forget God never forget everything that
[47:50] you do he never forget he know what he's
[47:53] doing he forgive if you go back and
[47:57] repent and carry
[48:00] on when you do something to one another
[48:03] whether your wife or your your your
[48:05] husband don't stay there say oh it's my
[48:09] husband or it's my wife so I'm not going
[48:11] to apologize or I'm not going to say
[48:14] sorry honey I'm sorry I made a mistake I
[48:17] did this and this there's nothing that's
[48:20] why I say is very hard for human being
[48:24] to submit thems
[48:27] to one
[48:28] another you
[48:31] know one time somebody told me he was
[48:36] sleeping in the middle of the
[48:38] night he wake up when he wake up his
[48:42] wife was curing
[48:44] him I do this I do do I was this I I
[48:48] wash your clothes I
[48:50] make and all kind of stuff so he pretend
[48:54] that he didn't hear
[48:55] nothing so in the morning or in the
[48:58] daytime in the evening the hus the wife
[49:01] Nice D she cooked for him the man came
[49:04] home he didn't talk he didn't want to
[49:08] eat the
[49:09] food the wife didn't
[49:12] know that when you was curing him you
[49:16] cursing your husband the same husband
[49:19] that you you beh him the the same
[49:23] husband that take care of you take care
[49:25] for your children in the middle of the
[49:27] night you cursing

[49:46] word what you thought I was I don't know
[49:48] how I get up how you were curing me now

[49:58] work we take a lesson Satan can do
[50:02] anything if you if you give
[50:05] way Satan can do anything to destroy us

[52:58] Holiness and excitement for the gospel
[53:02] and the Salvation he has given unto us
[53:05] this is worth more than
[53:07] anything Hallelujah there's nothing that
[53:11] can
[53:12] compare what we are doing here right now
[53:15] you sitting in the peill and by the
[53:17] grace of God I standing here to share
[53:20] this little exultation with you is it
[53:23] not a
[53:24] blessing we could be somewhere
[53:30] hallelujah thank you
[53:35] Lord ah thank you
[53:38] Lord we have to find a way to live a
[53:44] life that can
[53:46] be Seer
[53:49] Seer that will show our children our
[53:53] grandchildren that this is the way God
[53:56] made made us God took that E
[54:01] from the man's side so that we can be
[54:05] one and what during the fall after the
[54:11] fall Eve you know Adam
[54:15] could could could could have leave God
[54:19] to kill the woman but she is the part of
[54:24] him so he took him he took all the blame
[54:28] say he's my wife I will never let her go
[54:32] and God admitt that said take
[54:35] it but there's conditions because he
[54:39] fail to
[54:41] listen the same apply to Sarah when
[54:45] Sarah lied before God God could have go
[54:49] God could have
[54:50] killed Sarah but he is part of
[54:57] Abraham to fulfill what God has
[55:01] planned so we cannot separate the woman
[55:05] from man we are one Hallelujah but
[55:09] there's a position that a woman should
[55:12] not
[55:14] go in the
[55:17] Bible praise God let me read a little
[55:20] bit in
[55:24] here uh first Timothy
[55:30] 2 first
[55:33] Timothy 2 11 to 15
[55:56] let the let the woman Le in Silence with
[56:00] all subjection but I suffer not a woman
[56:04] to teach nor to user authority over man
[56:08] but to be in silence for Adam was first
[56:12] form than
[56:15] Eve and Adam was not deceived but the
[56:19] woman being deceived was in
[56:21] transgression not withstanding he shall
[56:24] be saved in childbearing if continue in
[56:27] faith and charity and Holiness with
[56:34] sobriety you
[56:38] know is very very hard from some some
[56:42] some wom some
[56:46] sisters sometime you tell them
[56:49] something because this is the
[56:52] church the
[56:54] church the woman would do something the
[56:57] sister will do something and you tell
[57:00] her she does not understand she still
[57:04] arguing you know church God Pastor
[57:09] deacons and
[57:10] trustees deacons are
[57:14] helping the pastor so that the load can
[57:17] be lighter so that he can work he can
[57:21] study better for to feed
[57:24] us but when they get overboard and you
[57:29] tell them they start
[57:32] arguing instead of them to submit to the
[57:36] word of God you know God has set the
[57:41] church God has set the
[57:44] church
[57:47] ah a regulation principles that the the
[57:52] congregation can
[57:54] use to be a blessing to
[57:57] them but some of them don't want to use
[58:02] it something happen the deacons will
[58:06] call you and
[58:09] then for the welfare for all the
[58:12] congregation you start to talk with them
[58:15] they get mad and
[58:17] sometime they go and they tell their
[58:20] husband then they they get mad they
[58:22] don't want to go to the church anymore
[58:24] he's not here but I'm just speaking
[58:28] Hallelujah submitting is very very very
[58:34] tough mostly for the sister because the
[58:37] woman they are high
[58:41] temper High temper it cannot Temperance
[58:46] is good but if the temperance is like a
[58:48] high the the blood is good but if it
[58:51] goes higher too high you have to take
[58:54] medicine to bring it down
[58:57] right high blood pressure you need a
[58:59] medicine to bring it
[59:01] down don't let the blood go so high
[59:04] before you take a medicine and then you
[59:06] you you lower it
[59:08] down we are working
[59:11] together because as a as a human when
[59:15] this hand get hurt the whole body get
[59:20] hurt so one
[59:24] affect the whole body affect
[59:27] and sometime you know you know
[59:31] sometime you you have to know who you
[59:35] listen sometime cuz sometime people
[59:38] leave go outside from the church and
[59:41] they listenting to other messages
[59:45] somewhere and then they get
[59:48] confused and they try to they try to
[59:52] bring it around the congregation and the
[59:55] pastor will look that and say no you
[59:58] cannot do this here he has to hold tight
[1:00:04] because if that effectivess of that
[1:00:07] disease comes to the church what he
[1:00:09] going to do the whole church get cont
[1:00:12] terminated then the pastor job going to
[1:00:14] be
[1:00:16] had to
[1:00:18] clean so the Deacon when the Deacon see
[1:00:21] something that is not right we have a
[1:00:24] right to protect the flocks in the
[1:00:27] church it doesn't matter who you are
[1:00:31] we're going to call you and let you know
[1:00:34] that we mean God business we will not
[1:00:38] stand and for something to happen first
[1:00:42] before it cause trouble no we have

[1:05:01] that let's
[1:05:03] move hallelujah thank you
[1:05:08] Lord God has principles in the church
[1:05:12] and we
[1:05:15] are everything is for us if we humble
[1:05:18] ourself together I just read another
[1:05:22] another here Corinthians
[1:05:25] Corian
[1:05:27] 14
[1:05:34] 34 14 34
[1:05:39] 4 let your woman keep silence in the
[1:05:42] churches for it is not permitted unto
[1:05:45] them to speak but they are commanded to
[1:05:48] be under obedience as also said the Lord
[1:05:52] and if they will learn anything
[1:05:56] let them ask their husbands at home for
[1:06:00] it is a shame for a woman to be speak in
[1:06:03] the church what come and come no what
[1:06:09] came the word of God out from you from
[1:06:12] you or came it unto you only or came it
[1:06:18] unto you only if any man think himself
[1:06:21] to be a prophet or a spiritual let him
[1:06:24] acknowledge
[1:06:26] that the things that I write unto you
[1:06:28] are the Commandment of the Lord but if
[1:06:31] any man be ignorant let him be ignorant
[1:06:35] wherefore Brethren convert to prophesy
[1:06:37] and forbid not to speak with tongues let
[1:06:40] all things be
[1:06:42] done
[1:06:44] decently and in
[1:06:46] order praise the
[1:06:49] Lord
