TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good morning friends good Sunday morning to all of you may God richly bless us together here today I'm happy to be in the house of the Lord to praise him and give him Thanksgiving for all of his goodness and all of His mercies to me now last week we explained the meaning of the word quicken we quoted up from a poem called the little plant and spoke of gods that spoke of the fact of God's elected seed for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again if the seed be planted the word will raise it up again and furthermore we talked about the seed gene of God how it was placed in the believer and for the believer to be conductor a conductor or conductors of the word of God in the age in which they are living in then we close with the thought of mechanics and dynamics that a car may have all the gas but if that spark plug that's not fire and there's no fire on the gas all you have is a piece of junk it may be beautiful it may be expensive it may be a lovely looking church might be a wonderful looking Christian person but whoever they are without that fire of the Holy Spirit that quickening power of the spark of the Living God making himself manifest in the life of that church or that individual it's nothing but a piece of junk but with the fire the motive power of the Holy Spirit is able to empower and motivate and move it to accomplish the perfect will and plan of God no Paul made it clear that his knowledge of Jesus Christ was not from the seminary it was not from the University of Gamaliel but his knowledge was from God he said by revelation he made known unto me the mystery by revelation he not the seminary he not the Malians University but he Jesus Christ who met him on the road to Damascus he revealed to me the mystery he revealed to me all of his hidden secrets all the great secrets of God that were hidden for ages and ages and for generations as it is written in the scriptures he has now made know all of his secrets that were hidden being made known to his people to his living Saints he is revealing himself and his word now let us read from the scripture Ephesians chapter 3 verses 1 to 5 for this cause re Paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you Gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given to me you word how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote afore in a few words whereby when you read you may understand my understanding my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men but as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel how wonderful Paul received revelation for all received hidden knowledge oh we're speaking this morning on the Spirit quickens the word and before we continue speaking let us have a brief word of Prayer dear God we come today in the name of Jesus Christ made a great holy spirit move up on the scene Lord move on the waters of the word let the word of God be stirred up in our soul and let the word live today as it has never been alive let it leap off the pages of the Bible let it Lord God just leap into our hearts and you take all the praise the honor and glory for we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen now Paul received God's great secrets by revelation and he received it by revelation how are you going to receive it how do we receive it how we probably receive revelation Ephesians 3 10.0 tells us clearly is by revelation Hebrews tells us faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God it means that as you listen to this sermon faith revelation is knocking on your door may you open your heart may you open your mind your life and let the word of God come in we read in the book of revelation of Jesus knocking on the door asking to be let in and he was left on the outside oh I plead with you my friends my brothers and sisters do not leave him out of your experience do not exclude him from your life do not keep him away from your lifestyle but today I encourage and urge you to invite him into your life and he will set all things right for his glory and honor how do you receive revelation how do you receive faith you receive it as I staff or sit by listening to this sermon here today also by listening to the faithful preaching and teaching of your pastor the Word of God just reading out of the Bible if you are a child of God he will quickly your understanding to that word of God o listening also to the sermons of the messenger of this seventh church age will quickly your spirit quicken your soul to recognize the Word of God for your day and a message for your day you also may be able to receive revelation by reading the Word of God aloud to yourself a simple as it sounds reading the Word of God faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God reading the Word of God sometimes allowed yourself or by listening to media yeah you know your your tablet or having it like on there that will help you to receive some understanding and revelation from the Word of God you also will be capable of receiving revelation by having seasons of prayer sweet hour of prayer time for prayer in the presence of the Living God and ask God for wisdom during your time of prayer like Solomon asked God for pray for wisdom give me understanding Lord that I might know what to do and how to do it and he asked God for wisdoms God says you ask something that's far above riches far above just power or you've asked for wisdom which is the most excellent thing it's a great thing when you ask God to open up your understanding may you ask him today and I believe God will answer your prayer and give you the wisdom and the knowledge the leadership that erection that you seek here today you also may be able to receive revelation by times of meditation times of silence Oh blest quietness holy quietness in the presence of living God when God can whisper his secrets into your soul why don't we just in our heart say Lord open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see thee the the word I want to see the word open up to my soul that I might recognize who you are and who I am o God help us here today oh yes sir also we receive it by meditation for the Bible says these are my people and they are also the Sheep of my pasture God layton's us to sheep now what does she do after they've eaten grass and they go in the quietness under a shaded tree somewhere and they'll begin to chew what we call their cud they'll they'll bring it back up and they'll chew that grass finer than when they first eat it so sometimes we must do that with the Word of God also cows do the same they regurgitate sit under a tree and really begin to chew more finally the things that they had eaten and here you are today listening to the Word of God and I would pray my friends that you will regurgitate that you will take this to heart play it again sit listen and slowly be able to take it in your life inculcated into your character let the Word of God move richly within your soul to open up the gateways of your understanding that well did the messenger say to us long after I am gone just sit or lay there quietly in your room and to these tapes all friends this is advice we all should listen to coming from directly from God's servant and prophet of this hour yes sir believers I will encourage you to play play list these sermons and listen to them over and over and receive it into your soul while you are in the presence of the Living God because thinking of the word of thinking on the Word of God in silence opens up this supernatural portals of the higher dimensions in God and brings you to a place of a deeper walk where you no longer have to think about there about how to live and how to walk and what actions to take but you live in a state of grace you consistently live in a state of unconsciousness when the spirit of a mighty God flows through you without you having to think about any act any word consciously but it flows out of your life as your bless the entire atmosphere and the surroundings all around you absolutely so also you may receive revelation simply by having fellowship fellowshiping with your brothers and sisters around the revelation of the word create such an atmosphere and puts the entire group into heavenly places and set their minds upon things above and god sends down revelation by the bucket loads are by the handfuls on purpose for his glory and for his own and that revelation inspires and anoints the believer as they receive it we know also that you may receive a sudden flash of revelation lightning from the troll of God's tricks your soul sometimes you're sitting in the church and you're listening to the sermon or you're listening to a broadcast like this and in the middle of it a light from heaven heavenly sunshine shines down upon your soul and Witten's the Word of God whenever sons and daughters of God gather to worship God as they did before the foundation of the world creating great noise and praising and worshipping God like the voice of many Sun during waters in the presence of God when they rejoice job 38 verse 7 now here we see the very importance of fellowship fellowship is very important for when we come together he promised with two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst to bless I believe he's here today I believe the Lord is flowing through this media I believe the Holy Spirit is anointing hearts changing lives bringing men and women to Christ and bringing believers closer to Jesus Christ and bringing ministers even to a clearer more powerful understanding of the Word of God not because of me but because it's the Great Holy Spirit Himself making himself known through the opening of the word for one and all that are willing to receive the Word of God in their day and in their time now as we started this talk by giving you various definition of the word quicken we found in those definitions that the word quicken means to stimulate or to excite interest quickly means to give or to restore life as in the quickening of the body of Jesus Christ quicken it restored life to the dead physical body of Jesus I'm applying that to thee o the Holy Spirit quit me the letter that kills the dead word and brings it to life in the alert of the believer also it means the cause of fire to burn it if there's no fire my friends it's no use to sacrifice being on the altar as a wonderful brother priest a wonderful message no sacrifice no fire will fall o blessed be the name of the Lord so we need the fire we need the Holy Spirit we don't want or desire to have a dead church a dead life a dead walk and unexcited existence in the presence of the Living God but we want to walk with God every day and see the vindication of His divine presence working within our lives yes sir well did the old song says burn burn holy spirits burn and me set my soul on fire fill me with the Holy Ghost and God's will desire make me like the Christ of old healing and raising the dead Oh blessed be the name the Lord may God help every one of us here today to enter into the presence of God enter into inheritance of his word that he has sent to us through the Ministry of William Marian bran Hamed a prophet of God for this 20th century read his his biography read his life story written by Gordon Lindsay and man sent from God 20th century prophet written also by Perry green Oh may the Living God bless these words to our hearts here today let the fire of God fall upon this word here today may the fire of God fall upon this altar and anoint the word of God fire fire fire fire fall on me as it was on the day of Pentecost may the fire of God fall on me may the Spirit of God search our hearts and burn out every trace of sin and bring the light and glory in now quicken also means to speed up it means to make something faster or to cause something to accelerate o blessed be the name of the Lord as I think of this I am thinking of a very popular song that we all love these are the days of Elijah these are the days of the Elijah oh praise God and it reminds me of Elijah and am first Kings chapter 17 and 18 is where you will find that story you can read it for yourself how that Elijah had met with behalf and told him after the great drought that they had that he had right on the chariot go back to Jezreel Oh for I hear the sound of the abundance of rain Oh rain is the Holy Spirit's anointing is coming the power of God is coming down to heal you to save you to deliver you to raise you up to vindicate his word the spirit of the Living God the rain is coming and he had said whoa he's like I'm gonna get there before you so he grabbed the home of his reigns and you know a king yes the best chariots he has the best horses and he took off in a cloud of dust heading towards Jezreel but the Bible says but the hand of the Lord the hand of the Lord was upon Elisha and when the Holy Spirit anointing fell upon the Elijah Elisha and all prophet the Bible says that Elijah out when all of a hams chariot and was waiting him at the gate of Jesse just real because Elijah got there before he did think about it this the Spirit of God fell upon an old man and quickened him typing that old man like they the ancient word of God given down to us and we think it's an old word but when the Spirit of God fell on that man as it falls upon the word of God for this day 2000 years five five thousand years later it falls upon that word it brings that word alive and it quickens the word accelerates the movement of the Word of God within your heart your life your experience your walk your church life all your associations the Holy Spirit be canceled animated - anointed to give you the zeal the strength to make the power that you need to overcome and to defeat the works of the devil to defeat him and defeat every strategy that he will bring against your life so that no evil fiend form that gets you can't prosper it cannot because you you believe and you're a child of the king and you've asked God to open your eyes oh and if you think your eyes are already open then you need to ask him to open your open eyes to see more and to see further until you can look into tomorrow all the things that are going to be and see modern offense me and make clear by prophecies being vindicated by the Holy Spirit in this day an hour how happy we ought to be the Holy Spirit anointing an old prophet type of the word quitted him to the point that he already had the king with his chariot and horses to the Kings to the gates of Jezreel the hand of the Lord fella come up on the Elijah and he outran Oh blessed be his name well praise God I want to ask here today if it did that to an old man then what will the Holy Spirit do in your life in this day now as a young person what will the Holy Spirit if you completely and fully surrender and dedicate yourself with a clear understanding of this message and what it ought to do and what is doing within your heart and your life or receive it my friends receive the Word of God receive the word turn turn for why will you die turn to him now while he is yet calling may the Holy Spirit anoint every man woman and child every believer every church member every leader wherever you are whoever you are Oh may the Spirit of God apply this word of God to your heart and to your soul and bring about a life change that will never be able to turn itself away well did the Word of God bill I just says look I'm running up the shining way I'm running to jazz reels I can imagine a hat in his chariot right going down furiously and in a cloud of dust and then he sees another cloud of dust go by him like a road brother heading toward Jezreel it was the Prophet Elisha anointed by the Holy Spirit of Almighty God and let me tell you you can do supernatural things you can do in unimaginable things oh but the Spirit of God I'm going to you nothing is impossible with God nothing is impossible in your life nothing that you asked for that God cannot grant nothing that God cannot do for rigorous nothing impossible with the God that we serve I hear the sound of the abundance of rain I believe what they had on the day of Pentecost I believe that's coming again I believe on that anointing is coming again not this modern day Pentecost but I'm talking about the original what Paul had what Peter had what James had what these apostles had it's here again I hear the sound of the abundance of rain I can hear the former rain and the latter rain falling together combined together and they're falling together I can hear the the teaching rain and the harvest rain combined together and forming upon the believer which is a type of the double portion that came upon Elijah that followed the footsteps of Elijah the double portion anointing of the Holy Spirit of our mighty God is here it's here for you it's here for me it's here for all of us only believe receiver receive in your heart your your we are back kisum of the Holy Spirit receive your healing your deliverance if don't can't believe you can rise up out of that bed if you can't believe God you can be free from your cancer you believe God you can be free from your temples your trials your tribulations you test your temptations that were in your life all the habits can be broken right now by the land of the tribe of Judah who will break every chain if you believe the Word of God here to the today may the Holy Spirit Minister you to you right now blessed be his holy name my word the Bible says run it swiftly throughout beard Elisha ran swiftly and the Word of God run swiftly throughout the world or the world when it's anointed by the Holy Spirit yes sir this last day double portion is now falling its falling now to awaken God's seed jeans to wake up those elected souls that God sent upon this earth not the soul that's in it but God's soul gene that he sent here and placed in a heart he placed in the life of the believers blessed be his holy name yes sir I'm so happy that I'm a part of this work of God and while I'm talking to you all feel the quickening power I feel as and sense the presence of Almighty God moving within my heart and within my life it's so good to be a Christian it's so good to be a child of God it's so good to be a son or daughter of God being led by the Spirit of God and anointed by the Holy Ghost to perform God's will and the fulfill my purpose here upon the earth think of it the word means to accelerate quicken means to accelerate and Elijah surely accelerated pass a HAP's chariot we also see the start of the quickening power of God in Elijah's bones you will read that incident in 2nd Kings chapter 13 verses 20 to 21 weird the prophet Elijah had died and it came to pass as the Scriptures will say they buried him in a cave and while I was in Israel and passed many little caves on the side of the road and in those caves people were buried because that was the ancient way of burying folks so Elijah's cave was there at the site of the road and so ok the past there was a war and this young man was wounded and dying and no doubt his friends wanted to get him back his family tried to write quickly away from the enemy with this half dying man and a kid to pass he died he died and to save their own lives they're going to lessen the weight they're gonna lessen the Lord that they were carrying they threw him off of the horse and it just so happens he fell right on into the cave on top of Elijah's bones that were laying there now Elijah's bones is a type of the Word of God with the latent power of the Holy Spirit within it amen which my friends it's release just the think after this man is prophet and dying his bones were still vibrating with lights vibrating with resurrection power so that when a dead man came in contact with him as much as when a believers filled with the Holy Spirit and one who is dead and sins and trespasses comes in contact with them that Spirit of God is able to quicken the life of that person that was dead in sins and in trespasses and bring them to a supernatural life so this young man fell upon the bones of Elijah and soon the power of God struck him and the Bible says he punched out he came out of that cave and he was alive again and no doubt running up the road running up the road because the anointing struck him from off of that death prophet print bones that was there praise God hallelujah I know another prophet has gone on and I want to tell you if you think that his messages his words are all dead and it's gone and it's dying and everything else oh you just get around it you just form up on it you just let the Holy Spirit of God straight your soul but this word of God it will bring you to life or if that same spirit will quicken you to life again run a glory of praise of the Living God hallelujah I tell you friends no matter how they track these Deen deepen nations try to bury you in every possible way I'll tell you the Holy Spirit is here to quicken and raise you up hallelujah yo there's still resurrection power here there is still resurrection power in the Word of God it hasn't gone with the Apostles it hasn't gone with the old prophets I'll tell you my friends it's here today for is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the Living God making himself manifest by the Word of God hallelujah fires in the word to put you in the rapture you gotta have rapture and faith you must read bring yourself to to see the rapture revelation as the submit trying to make itself known to you so that you may recognize that you are a part of it o blessed be the name of our Living God hallelujah yes sir power to put you in the rapture I remember the quick link bar struck Samson one train he picked up an old broken jawbone of an ass tight for the word of God again and smoked with that thousand Philistines which is a type of the believer under the anointing picking up the Word of God and as the scripture says one shall chase a thousand and do shall chase ten thousand oh we are more than conquerors through him that loved us praise God for evermore God's Holy Spirit can also quicken you to have a quickened understanding Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and sharp it's sharper than a two-edged sword and can discern hallelujah the Holy Spirit can discern between your soul your spirit your body the Spirit of God is here to take that word and but surgical parents kill to deserve hallelujah your heart may the Spirit of God discern us here today that we may recognize what he is trying to say to us no job was quickened to understanding I believe we also need to be quickened in spiritual understanding job was a man filled with questions job was the richest man of his day that has nothing to do with it you can be rich you can be intellectual you can be knowledgeable in things of this world and totally and absolutely ignorant and blindfolded lightning in your mind and in your foxhole to the thing of the Living God you need the spirit of godly the teacher to come and open up your understanding to the Word of God when you ask him to do so would you ask him Lord open up the the gateway of my soul that I might recognize what you are saying to me from your word but I may not just be a reader of the word or a hearer of the word only but one who hears recognizes and acts upon the word and let the word come to life and manifestation through me job had a lot of questions in his life and job was asked can can a man by searching find out God then he asked who can bring a clean City out of an unclean thing then he asked how are the dead raised up these questions are still be amassed and he also asked if a man die shall he live again so he was filled with questions John chapter 19 verses 25 around there the Bible tells us this great incident of job asking the questions and then God turned around and begin to ask job do you know how I place the earth in a circle to hang on nothing do you know how the stars are staying in their places and don't move until I say so how waters the waters are out there and the water is even on the heavens like that God began to ask him some soul-searching questions may you ask yourself some soul-searching questions here today and while job was listening to God speaking the Holy Spirit struck his soul the thunder rolled a lightning flash Joby said I know that my Redeemer liveth and shall stand upon the earth in the time sees their job catches a revelation and that revelation openness understanding from that time when he was a life right to the coming of the Lord where he said I know he knew there was a redeemer coming I read my Redeemer liveth and will stand upon your rapture second coming hallelujah in the latter days God turned him from a nobody into his profit he recognized his position and here he turned from uncertainty he turned from a state of presumption he turned from a state of uncertainty to a place where he could say I know where he was now certain of God and recognized who he was and what he was to do with the rest of his life may God help you today Saints may God help your child of God may God help you sir may God help you man may God help you miss may God help you young people to recognize who you are and allow the Holy Spirit to give your life it's

quittin Elijah that same spirit quickened Jill button quicken him to receive understanding of who his Redeemer who was that same spirit of God came upon the apostles and quicken them by the power of God quicken them to be conductors of the Holy Spirit that when they laid their hands on the sick the sick shall recover to me conductors of the Holy Spirit that when they spoke the Word of God with power and with boldness oh there was deliverance there was healing there was people running to the altars of God crying men and brethren what shall we do to the same and and Peter gave them the right answer repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Oh God acts 4:12 I believe he says what there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved thanks Peter God may who hear the voice of God speaking to you and trying to use you as a conductor a conduit for his Holy Spirit praise God forever more that he will use you Oh every one of us should be praying and singing

science but God is above all when it goes into another of absolute pure miraculous miracles we serve a God of miracles that can create make and do things out of nothing and I believe his word and I believe he's doing it right now for if you now can't believe all things are possible to them that believe the Word of God the spirit of God so quick and those apostles that lost men like Philip could be one place and in another moment they're in another like Kelly transportation by the great power of the Holy Spirit within there were once here and then they're not here they're somewhere else he was in the desert speaking to any an Ethiopian and testifying of the grace of God the forgot so quickly those apostles that no prison house no but whole day they imprison them but the Bible says the
