[25:53] My sins [singing] are
[25:58] my soul. [music]
[26:06] Thanks be to the Lord.
[26:09] Uh I was thinking in my area there is an
[26:15] ice
[26:17] uh snow.
[26:19] So sorry for being late [music]
[26:22] a little bit because the time
[26:26] the the song leader and everyone of you
[26:29] I know you were waiting but tonight
[26:35] who is here you are going to be blessed
[26:38] because
[26:39] the Lord
[26:41] is open up his word to us.
[26:46] As good neighbor, we are blessed.
[26:50] We are so blessed. You don't realize it.
[26:53] But when you go out there even in the
[26:56] message church and you can see
[27:00] what the Lord has built on you, then you
[27:04] will know that you are blessed because
[27:06] your voice people will love to hear what
[27:10] you have been heard here by revelation
[27:14] that you didn't know. But God going to
[27:18] show it to you and say see I love you.
[27:21] You are my son. You are my daughter. I
[27:24] give you all that and his blessings
[27:29] will show to you that how much God love
[27:32] you. May the Lord bless each and every
[27:35] one of you. I won't take long. I will
[27:38] I'll just go straight on the scriptures
[27:42] and from the scriptures then
[27:47] I will start to uh
[27:51] share my testimony
[27:54] about what the Lord did.
[27:59] Uh Eugi, can you pray for us?
[28:33] Amen.
[28:35] Uh I will use the background
[28:39] Psalm 23.
[28:47] We're going to read from Psalm 23. Each
[28:50] and everyone know that simple scripture.
[28:54] Verse one going down says the Lord is my
[28:58] shepherd. I shall not want. He make me
[29:02] to lay down in green pasture. He leaded
[29:06] me beside the still waters. He restore
[29:10] my soul. He leaded me in the path of
[29:15] righteousness for his name's sake. Yay.
[29:18] Though I walk through the very of the
[29:22] shadow of death, I will fear no evil,
[29:26] for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy
[29:29] staff, they comfort me.
[29:33] Thou prepare a table before me in the
[29:37] presence of my enemies. Thou anointed my
[29:41] head with oil, my cup run over. Surely
[29:47] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[29:50] the days of my life. and I will dwell in
[29:56] the house of the Lord forever.
[30:00] Please be seated. May the Lord add his
[30:05] blessing.
[30:07] The reason why I use this scripture,
[30:11] I'm going to give the testimony
[30:15] about my living here and I went to
[30:20] Ghana. After I got back, the Lord raised
[30:24] me up from the dead
[30:28] and I went back home with my wife.
[30:33] uh which
[30:35] it was a very
[30:37] uh nice trip.
[30:39] I thank the Lord for that and it was a
[30:43] very blessing to believers
[30:47] whom the Lord led me testify to. I use
[30:51] the same scripture that I use while I
[30:56] testify here about what happened to me,
[31:00] what the Lord has done. And the
[31:04] congregation there knows about it
[31:07] because one of their ministers
[31:10] called
[31:12] one of the churches. The minister called
[31:15] he was calling me because it was time
[31:17] for me to go back to my country and
[31:20] minister in that local church. The
[31:23] pastor name is called pastor Anan.
[31:26] Pastor Samuel know him. Brother Deson
[31:29] know him. They have preached there. So
[31:31] we are not strangers over there. The
[31:34] same size like our church.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[31:38] &gt;&gt; So when they call
[31:41] my wife told them what has happened to
[31:44] me
[31:45] that I have
[31:48] passed away dead come back life and
[31:51] right now I'm in the hospital so they
[31:54] should go on their knees and begin to
[31:56] pray for me. So the whole church was
[32:00] praying for me
[32:03] over there. So is it with Pastor Daniel
[32:06] Church too? They were praying for me
[32:09] over there.
[32:11] [snorts] So
[32:13] so many people were praying for me
[32:17] across the sea which is my back home
[32:21] country.
[32:23] And
[32:25] when they heard that I was coming from
[32:30] here, they couldn't wait to see and hear
[32:34] what the Lord has done already. Brother
[32:37] Desmond has gone there, told them what
[32:41] has happened because Desmond saw some of
[32:44] it at the hospital. So they they
[32:47] couldn't wait to see me face to face
[32:51] and I left here which was Wednesday the
[32:55] date I forgot
[32:58] and I arrived with my wife Thursday
[33:02] in Ghana. When we arrived it was around
[33:06] 5:00.
[33:09] Pastor Daniel whom came here and
[33:12] minister with his precious wife. They
[33:15] were in England coming Saturday.
[33:18] So we were in their house. Every time I
[33:20] go I stay in the his house at Ara.
[33:25] So
[33:26] they left the house for me big huge
[33:29] house
[33:30] with my wife and one brother that was
[33:33] living there.
[33:35] Before we wake up the brother is gone to
[33:38] work. So the house and will be left with
[33:42] me alone.
[33:44] Then
[33:46] when I reach my phone
[33:49] what I will use I have all the contact
[33:52] to contact the pastor there to contact
[33:55] the people I wanted to see. Somehow the
[33:59] phone is brand new. I bought it from uh
[34:02] uh
[34:04] uh one of the stores here, big stores,
[34:07] uh Costco,
[34:09] and the phone was somehow
[34:12] I couldn't get it through. Things were
[34:15] not going right. Everything I was trying
[34:17] to do was like messing up. I tried to
[34:22] let them help me do it. It doesn't work.
[34:26] So all the contact I have is on the
[34:29] phone and it was nothing but the devil
[34:33] trying to hold the testimony cuz people
[34:37] were going to be blessed about it.
[34:40] So I went to my village with my wife
[34:46] Friday. We left Wednesday. Remember
[34:50] Thursday
[34:51] I went to the village Friday with my
[34:54] wife. Left my wife to her mother and
[34:59] family there.
[35:01] After I left my wife,
[35:05] I went there with her brother who is a
[35:08] minister in pastor Daniel church. He
[35:10] drive Uber. I pay him and he he took us.
[35:15] I came back to the city
[35:18] Friday because Saturday I have to travel
[35:22] again to go to the second city which is
[35:25] Ashanti city called Kumasi. It's a big
[35:27] city.
[35:30] And
[35:31] I came back to Accra. My wife stay with
[35:35] her parents,
[35:38] her mother and the brother and whatever.
[35:41] I left her there because the Kumasi
[35:44] people were waiting for me to hear the
[35:46] testimony and I couldn't stay in the
[35:50] family and keep the testimony to myself.
[35:53] My wife would tell them. then I will go
[35:55] there personally for them to see me. So
[35:59] I I took off Saturday morning by like
[36:02] here we will say green coach
[36:05] the same size and went into that series.
[36:12] While I was there because of my phone
[36:16] condition
[36:17] the hotel I supposed to rent down floor
[36:21] because of I was thinking my situation I
[36:25] wanted to live in the down floor but
[36:27] because of the phone situation the
[36:30] brother couldn't get the down floor he
[36:32] get a third floor
[36:34] so when I arrived and it was night
[36:39] what should I do should I go try. Would
[36:43] I be able to clamp up? No elevator. I
[36:46] have to take the steps
[36:48] or what should I do? I have no choice. I
[36:53] said, okay. I said in my head, Lord,
[36:55] since I'm I got sick and came back, I
[37:00] haven't gone to third floor, but Lord,
[37:03] I'm going to trust you.
[37:06] So I started cramping
[37:09] and I was able to do it. Even the
[37:13] brother that get the hotel, he said he
[37:15] had a hard time to get that room for me.
[37:20] But when he saw me, he knew the
[37:24] situation because he's part of the
[37:25] family where my wife's senior s sister.
[37:29] So he knew what I was already going
[37:32] through. He was calling here almost
[37:34] every day to hear the situation. So when
[37:38] he saw me clamp up third floor, my
[37:42] goodness was great miracle for him to
[37:46] see because he says this is nothing but
[37:50] what God has really done. Even though it
[37:54] wasn't easy for me to climb, I was
[37:57] sweating and h tired. But the Lord
[38:02] helped me. I did it. So he was so
[38:06] shocked in shock
[38:08] and he says Kovi this is what your God
[38:13] has done.
[38:14] And I says yeah my God does anything
[38:18] that is impossible to man.
[38:22] So I get the third floor live there.
[38:27] Then I called I was able to contact Paul
[38:32] wife. I told her I wanted to see her. We
[38:36] goes to church Sunday for me to go and
[38:39] give my testimony to the church.
[38:42] So he came Sunday morning
[38:46] and I took her I and her plus the same
[38:51] uh uh
[38:53] uh I would say my sis and my wife's
[38:57] sister husband we went to the church
[39:00] three of us and when they saw me already
[39:03] they were singing when people saw me
[39:05] there it was even inspired to them they
[39:11] they because what they heard and what
[39:14] they are seeing was like my goodness the
[39:21] Lord has done it. This is nothing but
[39:24] the Lord that did it. So there people
[39:28] were so happy already. Then the pastor
[39:32] says, "Brother Kofi, you going to take
[39:34] the pulpit?" So they put me into the
[39:37] their office with the pastor
[39:40] sitting down. They singing, they
[39:42] rejoicing. Then all of a sudden, my time
[39:46] reach. And I said, "Lord,
[39:50] watch. I'm going to give the testimony
[39:52] to glorify you."
[39:55] And I use the same scripture about
[39:59] Lazarus, how I testify here. And I the
[40:03] best that the Lord give it to me, I
[40:06] begin to pour out my heart and share it
[40:10] with them.
[40:11] And the people were so blessed
[40:16] even to a point they don't know what to
[40:20] do. Wow.
[40:22] This is nothing. I says what you are
[40:25] seeing. You looking at your brother when
[40:28] you read the Bible about Lazarus
[40:31] in the Bible that was the old days when
[40:34] Jesus did it. Naturally speaking you and
[40:36] I wasn't there. But today,
[40:40] &gt;&gt; today now in your presence, Jesus has
[40:44] done it.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; I am the example.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; So the Lord don't want the scriptures to
[40:50] stay in the Bible. I told them he want
[40:55] the scriptures not just we going to just
[40:57] quote it.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Not just read it,
[41:02] not just analyze it with big quotes. He
[41:06] want the letter to turn into you to make
[41:10] manifest
[41:12] &gt;&gt; because he show Lazarus
[41:16] that
[41:17] this is who I am. I am the resurrection
[41:21] and the life.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; And today the Lord want you
[41:26] &gt;&gt; to demonstrate
[41:28] &gt;&gt; his word. The Bible wanted to come out
[41:32] &gt;&gt; in you to be life.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. that the people can see.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my sister, my brother, the whole
[41:41] place was like fire. Somebody has spread
[41:44] fire on the people and they were
[41:47] rejoicing and thanking God.
[41:52] And I just testify because when I was
[41:54] going,
[41:56] me and Pastor Danny, we talk about it.
[41:59] He told me, he says, "Brother Kufi, you
[42:02] have the testimony. The Lord has given
[42:04] you testimony. Don't go and try to even
[42:07] preach or I said, "Pastor, let me tell
[42:10] you, I'm going to take your word." So,
[42:13] in my heart, I was going to just go
[42:16] testify what the Lord has done. And even
[42:21] I wanted to as a matter of fact stay
[42:24] away from the preaching
[42:27] so that I could go and eat natural food,
[42:30] natural h go here, relax on the tree
[42:35] having nice fun but not just because
[42:40] over there when I give myself they would
[42:43] take me and I won't have time for
[42:46] nothing. So I was trying to run away but
[42:49] not knowing the Lord have his plan.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; So when I testify like that the pastor
[42:57] rejoice. The pastor is taller like our
[43:00] pastor.
[43:02] So all of a sudden I came back to the
[43:05] hotel
[43:07] Monday morning my wife came from my
[43:12] village. Today there is about 4 hours.
[43:15] So I said, "Okay, we're going to stay
[43:18] here a little bit. We have some family
[43:20] too in Kumasi.
[43:23] Stay there little bit, relax, rejoice,
[43:27] try to walk the Ashanti, the king, he
[43:32] have his yard and there's a zoo around
[43:35] there. just go around and lash myself
[43:38] and and see what was out there for me
[43:43] and eat natural food,
[43:46] try myself clamping the hill and see how
[43:50] things will go.
[43:52] But all of a sudden my phone
[43:56] I give it to the family to try to do
[44:00] things so that everything will come. It
[44:04] doesn't work. No matter what they do,
[44:06] the phone is not working and I have all
[44:09] the people phone numbers. So the people
[44:12] I'm going to contact, it's like
[44:16] I don't have nobody but I says, "Hey
[44:19] Lord, whatever you want to do, let it
[44:22] happen." Anyway, I didn't come to preach
[44:25] or to get to know so many. I just come
[44:28] to relax myself. But that's not what the
[44:32] Lord want.
[44:35] Why
[44:37] my wife came? We were there. So I think
[44:40] Thursday that a week I said okay second
[44:44] week
[44:46] we're going to go visit Paul wife his
[44:50] mother the family and the people that
[44:53] came during the wedding Paul wedding
[44:57] there are so many people I have to
[44:59] thanks them say thank you
[45:03] people that came even I didn't know they
[45:06] came with their own cars, pain.
[45:11] So, and these people are important to me
[45:14] and I have to say thank you to them. So,
[45:17] that was on my heart to tell to go and
[45:21] see all those people. But while we were
[45:25] going to Paul Wife family in the car,
[45:31] all of a sudden my phone rang.
[45:35] When the phone ring, it was that pastor,
[45:40] pastor.
[45:43] He says, "Brother Kovi,
[45:46] I want to tell you, I want you to take
[45:48] Sunday service."
[45:51] I said, "Brother, I I I was sick. Since
[45:55] I was sick, I haven't preached.
[45:59] And I, as a matter of fact, I didn't
[46:02] come here to preach.
[46:05] I come here to relax myself,
[46:10] [laughter]
[46:10] enjoy myself with my wife
[46:15] and eat the natural food and go back.
[46:19] This is what I come here for. He says,
[46:23] "Brother, let me tell you,
[46:26] I want you to preach Sunday. My heart is
[46:29] telling me that you have to preach.
[46:34] I said,
[46:37] "Brother, this is hard." He says, "Get
[46:40] yourself ready. Sunday you taking the
[46:42] service."
[46:46] I said,
[46:48] "I don't know."
[46:52] He says, "Okay, you going to show up
[46:54] Sunday?" I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah,
[46:56] yeah." says, "Okay,
[46:59] prepare yourself."
[47:01] So why he spoke like that? The phone
[47:04] just cracked and my phone went dead
[47:07] again.
[47:09] I went with my wife. My wife says, "Who
[47:11] is who was calling you?" I says, "The
[47:14] pastor." He says,
[47:17] "All right, what does he want?" He says,
[47:19] "He want me to take the service Sunday."
[47:22] I said, "But I didn't come here to
[47:26] preach.
[47:28] My wife keep his mouth shut. So I I
[47:33] leave it alone."
[47:35] Then we went to Florence's house, eat
[47:38] nice natural food, talk,
[47:42] come back with my wife. Why we come
[47:44] back? And I open I pick up. I said,
[47:48] "Okay, I'm going to read the scripture."
[47:50] I pick up to Revelation. I think it was
[47:55] 22.
[47:58] When I pick up, all of a sudden my eye
[48:03] pop up to the scripture.
[48:07] Then it look like somebody
[48:11] God is great.
[48:14] All of a sudden, it look like somebody's
[48:16] dropping thoughts of the word of God
[48:20] into my head. It come like that. Boom,
[48:24] boom, boom, boom. Right away, I realize,
[48:27] hey,
[48:29] I can't say no. I have to take what the
[48:33] brother is saying.
[48:36] And I try to get away from there. open
[48:41] another
[48:43] another revelation and it goes with that
[48:46] scripture. Then the thought begin to
[48:49] form. Then tears begin to come on my
[48:53] eye. I says, "My God, what is going on?
[48:58] Lord, you want me to preach?
[49:02] If not, you know, I don't know nothing.
[49:04] Even revelation I haven't my life I have
[49:08] never ever even preach on revelation.
[49:12] Why my thought
[49:14] it goes that way?
[49:18] So
[49:20] I said okay I realize is the Lord
[49:24] dealing with me.
[49:26] So
[49:28] we try to I try to read the best I can.
[49:34] then get myself in shape so that even if
[49:38] I go and the the pastor says, "Okay,
[49:41] Kufi, if you won't preach, just stay
[49:43] away. I'm all right with it."
[49:46] So I go there,
[49:49] they were singing Sunday morning with my
[49:52] wife. As soon as I reach there, they
[49:55] take me to the pastor room.
[49:58] And pastor stay with me. He says,
[50:00] "Brother, you going to are you ready to
[50:02] take over?" I said, "Will you see what
[50:05] the Lord will do?" I said, "Brother, you
[50:07] know, I'm I'm since I I was sick and the
[50:11] Lord delivered me from dead. I having a
[50:15] stay on the Pope." He says, "Don't
[50:16] worry. God will take control. Don't
[50:20] worry about it. Everything the Lord will
[50:23] take control.
[50:25] and my brother, my sister.
[50:29] I get the son
[50:32] and I get into the pulpit.
[50:36] The Holy Spirit just took over me
[50:40] and I preached for 1 hour 30 minutes.
[50:50] My wife was even shocked
[50:55] when I spoke Finnish
[51:00] and all of a sudden I said who need
[51:04] prayer?
[51:08] The the the platform just about this
[51:12] size the frontier was filled with the
[51:15] whole congregation.
[51:20] And the pastor was rejoicing. The people
[51:24] were receiving the word. The word was
[51:28] coming like even I myself don't know. I
[51:31] I just stand there. He speak. I open my
[51:34] mouth and it it was like
[51:38] somebody putting words into my mouth.
[51:41] The thing coming from my heart then
[51:43] straight my mouth. So I wasn't worried.
[51:46] I just open the scripture, read the
[51:48] Bible. I don't know what I'm going to
[51:51] say, but I love the Lord and my heart
[51:54] was pure
[51:57] to him. I said, "Lord, I don't know if
[52:00] you don't come is a disaster."
[52:03] And trust me, he was right there. The
[52:07] Lord was right there. How did It says,
[52:10] "How did you know it? Even the people
[52:14] testify of it. They were rejoicing,
[52:19] thanking God,
[52:21] praising God
[52:23] and the happy it was overjoyed.
[52:27] Even my wife he says after the service
[52:30] he told me he says wow
[52:32] this is even I myself I'm impressed
[52:37] because this is husband the Lord because
[52:42] I know
[52:45] I wasn't expecting you to go stand there
[52:47] and preach for about 1 hour or even 45
[52:52] minutes or like one and a half hours if
[52:56] you could have told me you preach like
[52:58] that. I would say no. And it was the
[53:01] power of God, not just words. God was in
[53:06] control.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Was telling the people things
[53:12] like
[53:14] it says the spirit and the bride are
[53:17] one. The Lord was said saying to them,
[53:20] I'm here. I'm in you.
[53:24] It's not I'm just coming. I'm already in
[53:27] you. Do you recognize me? Do you see
[53:30] that I am in you? Because you looking
[53:34] for I am coming. I'm already in you. So
[53:38] recognize
[53:40] your day, your message, your hour, the
[53:42] time you are living in. Everything is
[53:45] ready. I am here with you. I am in you
[53:50] trying to tell you what you must do with
[53:54] my word. Amen.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, so many things the Lord spoke. Tell
[54:00] them the book of Revelation is now
[54:03] revealed. Everything is open. I've spoke
[54:06] about you. You are here. So recognize
[54:09] it. Is you that I spoke about the book
[54:12] of Revelation. You are the revelation
[54:15] reveal.
[54:18] Oh, the people begin to jump praising
[54:22] God. Even the pastor there. Oh my. He
[54:26] couldn't sleep. Thanking God. The worst
[54:29] were coming. The worst were coming. And
[54:32] let me tell you,
[54:34] pastor said something Sunday. It's true.
[54:39] This message or this Bible,
[54:44] you can never study it and know it.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; You can. Yes. With your education, you
[54:52] may know the letter.
[54:55] But until God himself
[55:00] &gt;&gt; reveal it,
[55:03] &gt;&gt; you won't know nothing.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says the letter
[55:07] kill it. Think about it. Go in the
[55:09] Bible. How does Peter and John were able
[55:14] to preach? The people didn't even go to
[55:16] day I think daycare in their life.
[55:20] No, they don't have no even daycare 1 +
[55:23] 1 0 plus 0. They don't know.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says the people took
[55:30] knowledge because they have walked with
[55:32] Jesus.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; All Jesus want is our heart. When we
[55:36] give him the heart, he do the job.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; I believe in that.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; So God, he spoke through a donkey,
[55:48] right?
[55:50] Think about it.
[55:53] If you tell people today, the Lord spoke
[55:56] to a donkey,
[56:00] it doesn't sound with this technology,
[56:03] it doesn't sound right in humanity, but
[56:06] he did.
[56:08] He is telling humanity,
[56:10] I don't need nothing from you. Your
[56:13] wisdom, your education,
[56:16] just surrender your heart to me. When I
[56:19] get the heart, I will do the job. I will
[56:23] do the job. Your education, what I
[56:25] needing, give it to me. The one I don't
[56:29] need, I'll throw it in garbage and then
[56:32] I will show you what I can do with you.
[56:36] This is what he did with Moses,
[56:39] right? Moses tried with the education.
[56:42] He killed Egyptian
[56:44] &gt;&gt; intellectual.
[56:47] But when he gave his heart to the Lord
[56:51] for 40 years, the Lord dealt with him,
[56:54] took the education out.
[56:57] Right? When he surrender it to the Lord,
[57:00] the Lord did the job for him. He stand
[57:03] there. The Lord says, "Go to Pharaoh.
[57:06] Say this, say that, say this, say that."
[57:08] It wasn't Moses. It was God.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; And this is what the Lord is doing with
[57:14] us, you and I. Same thing he did it to
[57:19] William Abraham
[57:21] right William Abraham there are
[57:24] scriptures he couldn't read it
[57:28] but the Lord did through him
[57:31] you think that Lord change it doesn't
[57:34] change he's the same I am not saying
[57:37] education is not good I believe in
[57:40] education otherwise I won't let my
[57:42] daughter go to university I have the
[57:45] last one you in university too. But let
[57:48] me tell you education
[57:52] sometime become hindrance to the people
[57:55] to the word of God because God want our
[57:59] heart when the heart is open. I know I
[58:03] have seen that when your heart is open
[58:06] my heart is open.
[58:08] Let me tell you God
[58:11] can do a great things with us. Yes.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; He did things while I was in Ghana. Even
[58:17] the pastor called me. He says, "Brother,
[58:19] let me tell you the things you spoke was
[58:23] on my heart. I haven't preached about it
[58:26] yet, but you came. You spoke so many
[58:31] things that was on my heart. The Lord
[58:34] has revealed it to me. You came, you
[58:37] spoke it. Bang bang." And you know what
[58:41] the beauty about it? I'm not holding a
[58:44] message book.
[58:46] I'm not,
[58:49] you know me, I'm not a type I hold the
[58:52] Bible and open. Oh, this scripture, that
[58:54] scripture, this scripture, that
[58:55] scripture. But let me tell you, when the
[58:58] spirit take over.
[59:02] That's how the Lord used me.
[59:05] I gave him the heart. I said, Lord, I
[59:07] don't know. And you know, I'm not saying
[59:09] by my lips. I don't know. He knows.
[59:14] [snorts]
[59:14] Right. I just listen to the prophet
[59:17] tape. I just come to the church. I just
[59:21] listen to my pastor. I believe since
[59:24] Pastor Simon to Pastor Danny, I believe
[59:28] everything they preach here. I believe
[59:30] it.
[59:32] I believe everything the prophet spoke.
[59:37] [snorts] So I I can't read it better. I
[59:39] gave him my heart and let me tell you
[59:42] the people were blessed to a point the
[59:46] pastor called me back. He says brother
[59:49] let me tell you you don't know is the
[59:53] Lord that is using you.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; The Lord is using you. One of the
[1:00:00] brothers after the service
[1:00:03] a girl was sick. He come front. We pray
[1:00:07] for the the girl
[1:00:11] because something has happened to her.
[1:00:16] He come we pray
[1:00:19] after prayers within few days that girl
[1:00:22] was healed.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; I don't listen I I I'm not here for
[1:00:26] sure.
[1:00:28] This gospel is not for sure.
[1:00:33] God is real to you or he's not.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; That's how this gospel is.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Either God is real to you
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; or he's not.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; But when he's real to you,
[1:00:50] let me tell you nothing is impossible
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters. Nothing as your
[1:00:59] brother Kofi me nothing is impossible to
[1:01:04] me because God is real to me. God is
[1:01:07] real to me as you are sitting down.
[1:01:10] That's how he is real to me and I have
[1:01:13] met him. He has met me. I have met him.
[1:01:18] I have fought with him and I know that
[1:01:22] he is real. All my questions, all my
[1:01:25] doubt is gone.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, oh my,
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus is real to me. That's how I know
[1:01:34] him. So miracles for me. Miracles. Let
[1:01:38] me tell you, I've seen miracles upon
[1:01:41] miracles that the Lord have done for me
[1:01:45] my this eye to see. And I'm not just
[1:01:48] boasting.
[1:01:50] If
[1:01:52] people that are believers
[1:01:55] know that this brother he doesn't
[1:01:59] I can't speak much on I know I'm a
[1:02:03] talkative but not in the word of God
[1:02:06] when it comes to the word of God I don't
[1:02:09] know but how he let me know he just pour
[1:02:12] it in my heart and all of a sudden
[1:02:15] sometime I'm showering then the the
[1:02:17] thought coming is coming then oh I'm
[1:02:21] walking then it's coming that's how I
[1:02:23] got to know God
[1:02:25] listen to the tape read the Bible
[1:02:28] talking to sisters brothers then I'm
[1:02:31] listening my my my ear listening then I
[1:02:36] can see him in reality that's how I
[1:02:39] worship God
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; because the prophet message when you
[1:02:45] listen it blesses your heart
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; it become You take it in, it will be
[1:02:51] sweeter in your mouth, but bitter in
[1:02:54] your belly. Very bitter. It's not a
[1:02:58] joke. It's so bitter. But be ready
[1:03:03] to die with this message. Be ready to go
[1:03:07] in the grave with this message. Let me
[1:03:10] tell you, when he takes you into grave,
[1:03:12] it will bring you out.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; It will bring you out. Like I was
[1:03:16] fellowshipping with pastor Simon. He
[1:03:19] says, "Brother Kofi, Sunday we coming
[1:03:21] here to drink ooro."
[1:03:24] I says to him, "Ooguro." You know
[1:03:26] whaturo means? Nigeria says, "Oog, it
[1:03:29] means the African h alcohol, the hot
[1:03:33] one." In Ghana, we said aetish. Aeti
[1:03:37] means hot, hot, hot, hot drink. One
[1:03:40] white man drank it. It's so raw, you
[1:03:43] drink it, he fall down and die right
[1:03:45] there. But some people drink that one.
[1:03:48] You know when people drink they are so
[1:03:52] friendly they are so happy because why
[1:03:56] it h is changes their mood naturally and
[1:04:02] we know is of the devil but we we drink
[1:04:05] the spiritual drink from Jesus Christ
[1:04:08] when we drink it is supposed to change
[1:04:11] us so that the gospel become reality in
[1:04:15] our heart that the people will know it.
[1:04:18] Amen.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; After the service, one brother called me
[1:04:22] says, "Brother H
[1:04:25] somewhere over there, they call me
[1:04:26] pastor, but I they don't know I'm not a
[1:04:30] pastor." The brother says, "Pastor
[1:04:33] Kofi." I said, "Okay, brother." He says,
[1:04:36] "I want to give you right."
[1:04:40] And I know there's sisters and brothers
[1:04:42] there. Why you want to give me right
[1:04:44] that he's taking?
[1:04:48] So I said, "Oh brother, take the sisters
[1:04:50] and the brothers."
[1:04:52] Says, "Oh no, I'll take them. They can
[1:04:55] go with me on the road." He showed them
[1:04:58] place they should wait. But he wanted to
[1:05:01] take me.
[1:05:03] And I said
[1:05:06] I was in my heart. I was thinking, "Oh
[1:05:08] no,
[1:05:10] I can I have money in my p pocket to
[1:05:13] take a taxi with Rollins and we go
[1:05:16] home." Why the brother want to take me?
[1:05:19] But he in he inist insist that he should
[1:05:24] take me. Why he took me? You know what
[1:05:28] he says? Brother, let me tell you
[1:05:32] you you came here last time. The last
[1:05:34] time you came here, I was here. Says
[1:05:38] your preaching changed my life.
[1:05:41] There is things that I was going
[1:05:44] through. Nobody know. You came here, you
[1:05:46] preach, you spoke everything
[1:05:49] on your lips
[1:05:52] and my life is changed
[1:05:56] on the word. But I want to tell you,
[1:06:00] I won't reveal myself to you and I won't
[1:06:02] tell you details. Next time you come,
[1:06:05] I'll tell you. But I want you to know
[1:06:08] God is using you more than what you
[1:06:10] think. I says, brother, thank you. But
[1:06:14] give glory and honor unto the Lord. The
[1:06:18] most important thing is when someone
[1:06:22] tell you that your life has touched him
[1:06:25] through the word of God, then you give
[1:06:27] thanks unto the Lord because you
[1:06:30] recognize
[1:06:32] the message that you are under, the
[1:06:34] pastor that you are under, the message
[1:06:37] that you've been hearing from since the
[1:06:40] Lord brought you out from the street
[1:06:42] into the message, right? Sister
[1:06:45] Rosemary, Sister
[1:06:48] H sister Louie, sister Natasha, Sister,
[1:06:53] I can go on and on and on and on that
[1:06:56] you that are here long, you know what
[1:07:00] God has done for us, not what somebody
[1:07:03] is saying, right? So I give thanks unto
[1:07:09] the Lord.
[1:07:11] Let us back our pastor. let us as you is
[1:07:16] tough. It's not easy. Like sometime snow
[1:07:20] is out there, it's cold, is uh rough.
[1:07:24] But if the church door is open, just
[1:07:28] come. Don't stay home because you all
[1:07:33] the Lord is doing is he's burdening you.
[1:07:37] One of the days you're going to stand a
[1:07:40] place you know not. And God going to use
[1:07:44] you.
[1:07:46] God will use you. Let me tell you two
[1:07:48] days ago I called one of the pastor
[1:07:52] Simmon knows that man. One of the
[1:07:55] richest man in my country. The man have
[1:07:58] hotels and houses 100.
[1:08:03] Okay. In the city, the capital. He have
[1:08:07] 100 hotels
[1:08:11] in houses and hotels in the city. This
[1:08:15] man used to move with the government.
[1:08:17] The former president he has moved with
[1:08:20] he like he travel with like 10 SUV.
[1:08:26] This like our pastor car big size almost
[1:08:29] like that Toyota SOA and name it. You
[1:08:32] have Rolls-Royce. He have all the cars
[1:08:36] but he's sick
[1:08:39] and he was thanking me.
[1:08:42] Says the Lord,
[1:08:46] you know why? Nobody in my country could
[1:08:49] go to him and says things that I spoke
[1:08:52] to him. I told him face to face if you
[1:08:56] don't take Jesus, a vulture that will
[1:08:59] die on garbage is important than him.
[1:09:03] This man people have pistols when he's
[1:09:07] sitting. His securityities have pistols
[1:09:10] on them. He have soldiers.
[1:09:14] I I I sit with him. So I know have
[1:09:18] pistol
[1:09:20] on them. He could have said shoot the
[1:09:23] guy. But when I spoke there were people
[1:09:28] there. He didn't said a word.
[1:09:32] Later on he got sick so sick kidney
[1:09:36] problem he went to India. Now
[1:09:40] when I call him in two days because
[1:09:41] pastor Sam even was telling me oh okay
[1:09:44] have you heard about this man I says
[1:09:46] brother long time when I went home I
[1:09:48] didn't hear of him but I anyway I have
[1:09:50] his number I'll contact him. I called
[1:09:53] two days ago he called me. He was on the
[1:09:56] way to hospital.
[1:09:58] We talked for about 15 to 20 minutes on
[1:10:01] the phone.
[1:10:03] He was thanking the Lord. He was
[1:10:06] thanking me for
[1:10:10] even hearing the word of God coming from
[1:10:12] my mouth.
[1:10:15] Okay? This man moved with precedence.
[1:10:20] Not one. You go into his office,
[1:10:23] you you don't have to speak
[1:10:27] the the the pictures on the wall and he
[1:10:30] himself would the pictures would tell
[1:10:32] you what kind of person he is.
[1:10:36] Okay? And kings, he knows them.
[1:10:41] Money is nothing to him.
[1:10:44] But
[1:10:47] listen, it takes this gospel
[1:10:52] to go to the people
[1:10:54] and warn them about Jesus Christ
[1:10:58] and their life even if they don't come
[1:11:01] in the message at least they will get if
[1:11:04] they are not the bride they can become a
[1:11:08] foolish virgin or BE SAVED BECAUSE OF
[1:11:11] YOU.
[1:11:13] So God is journeying you.
[1:11:16] You may not know it. One day you meet
[1:11:20] somebody, before you know it, your mouth
[1:11:22] is speaking the word of God. Boom.
[1:11:27] You just spoke it. You wouldn't even
[1:11:29] think about it because why? The Lord,
[1:11:32] you come in here, he's talking to you
[1:11:35] every day. Sunday,
[1:11:38] Wednesday, you listen to Bible study.
[1:11:43] uh prayer night uh which we call a Bible
[1:11:47] study prayer night, Sunday service. The
[1:11:50] Lord is speaking to you. What do you
[1:11:53] think he's doing?
[1:11:55] He going to speak to you like that and
[1:11:57] you you you everything going to go under
[1:12:00] the the pillow. No.
[1:12:04] On a well, let me tell you, he has plant
[1:12:07] his seed in you. The seed is already
[1:12:09] planted.
[1:12:11] And when he want it, whether you like it
[1:12:13] or not, it's like a woman when a man
[1:12:17] planted the seed. Whether that woman
[1:12:20] like it or not, he have to bring forth.
[1:12:24] God in you will do the job.
[1:12:29] He will do the job with you even on
[1:12:32] aware.
[1:12:34] Right? All of a sudden, I I went I was
[1:12:38] sitting in the rich man place and in my
[1:12:41] heart I wanted to talk to him about the
[1:12:43] word of God.
[1:12:45] And I spoke things nobody in this earth
[1:12:49] have ever spoke to him. And he says,
[1:12:54] he told me, "Thank you.
[1:12:58] You are a really sincere person. You
[1:13:01] speak the truth."
[1:13:03] I told him, I says, "I know you have
[1:13:05] money. I can sleep on the street." I
[1:13:07] says, "I didn't come to you for your
[1:13:09] money. You think it's your money, then
[1:13:11] you and your money perish."
[1:13:15] Take Jesus.
[1:13:18] You have what the world don't have. You
[1:13:20] and I have it. So, let us feel proud
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; in the Lord.
[1:13:26] Don't be discouraged. Be encouraged
[1:13:30] because the word of God is not here to
[1:13:33] put you down. Be encouraged in times of
[1:13:37] sorrow, in times of h
[1:13:40] happiness, EVERYTHING, GIVE THANKS unto
[1:13:44] the Lord. Even you going IN THE GRAVE,
[1:13:47] GIVE THANKS UNTO the Lord. You walking,
[1:13:50] give thanks unto the Lord. WHEN YOU ARE
[1:13:52] IN THE CHURCH, GIVE THANKS UNTO THE
[1:13:55] LORD. WHEN YOU ARE SITTING AT home with
[1:13:57] YOUR HUSBAND, GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD.
[1:14:00] WHEN YOU ARE WITH YOUR UH WIFE, GIVE
[1:14:03] THANKS UNTO THE LORD. WITH YOUR
[1:14:05] CHILDREN, GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD.
[1:14:08] With your pastor, IN FRONT OF YOUR
[1:14:11] PASTOR, GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD. WITH
[1:14:15] BELIEVER, GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD
[1:14:18] BECAUSE HE DESERVE YOUR PRAISES.
[1:14:21] THE LORD [screaming] DESERVE YOUR
[1:14:23] PRAISES. Not just in the church, but
[1:14:27] wherever you go.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; People may not know it, but God knows
[1:14:32] it.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; God knows it. When God listen, this is
[1:14:38] not a public show. Whether I preach, I
[1:14:41] don't preach, I don't care because all I
[1:14:44] care is does my King Jesus get the glory
[1:14:48] from me? what he brought me here for.
[1:14:52] Does he get it from me? Am I Am I
[1:14:56] serving my savior the way he sent me
[1:14:59] here for? Am I praising him the way he
[1:15:02] sent me here for? That's all I care
[1:15:05] about. So I went to Ghana by testifying.
[1:15:10] I came to Pastor Danny church. Pastor
[1:15:13] Danny, he came here with his wife. You
[1:15:15] some of you saw him the tall brother
[1:15:17] from Ghana that came here and preached
[1:15:19] one Wednesday
[1:15:21] he left his house for me the church for
[1:15:24] me to testify he has already told them
[1:15:27] over there I'm not a common I came back
[1:15:29] to Ara with my wife
[1:15:33] and there they were waiting for me
[1:15:35] already that time pastor Danny has come
[1:15:38] he told them already they knew it
[1:15:40] already oh when I got there testify oh
[1:15:44] People were rejoicing, giving thanks
[1:15:46] unto the Lord. They realized that, oh my
[1:15:49] God, this Bible, the letter in the Bible
[1:15:52] is not sleeping. Lazarus spirit is back
[1:15:55] again. Jesus has raised him up. That's a
[1:15:58] resurrection.
[1:16:00] Right? That's a type of resurrection.
[1:16:03] Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and
[1:16:06] the life." Right? So if we don't see
[1:16:10] that, this good neighbor have seen that.
[1:16:13] The Lord has raised me up.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; THE LORD has raised me up.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; I WAS DEAD AND HE BROUGHT ME ALIVE.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; So listen this church, don't let nobody
[1:16:28] fool you. What do you want to see out
[1:16:30] there? There's nothing out there. Don't
[1:16:32] even message me. Don't let nobody come
[1:16:35] and fool you. You will see the miracle
[1:16:37] RIGHT HERE.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; THE LORD HAVE USED YOUR BROTHER. HE
[1:16:41] RAISED ME UP. BROTHER PHILILLIP IS
[1:16:43] SITTING HERE.
[1:16:46] He know what I'm talking about. It's not
[1:16:49] me. And I didn't choose. It's not I'm
[1:16:52] going to brag. Oh, brother Kofi is a big
[1:16:54] spiritual mind. Oh, brother Kofi think
[1:16:57] he know everything this that. NO.
[1:17:00] GOD DID IT. The Lord Jesus did it.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; The Lord did it. HE KNOW WHEN HE does
[1:17:06] it, I'll give him praise for that.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; And he chose me to demonstrate the way I
[1:17:12] was sick. Sister Lim came there. Brother
[1:17:15] Mike came there. THEY SAW ME. I didn't
[1:17:18] see them.
[1:17:20] THEY KNOW GOD HAS DONE IT. IT'S a
[1:17:23] miracle
[1:17:24] that the Lord has done it. Don't let
[1:17:26] nobody come and fool you. You are seeing
[1:17:28] miracle. Good neighbor have seen the
[1:17:31] resurrection of Lazarus. God has used
[1:17:35] me. He has raised ME UP TO DEMONSTRATE
[1:17:39] his the way he raised Lazarus. You are
[1:17:41] seeing it. It's so real. IT'S NOT JOKE.
[1:17:46] EVEN I MYSELF, I don't know why it
[1:17:49] happened. But I give him the praise. I
[1:17:51] give him the glory because he's the only
[1:17:53] one that can do it. I can't do it.
[1:17:56] Nobody can do it. No priest, no pope, no
[1:17:59] king. This thing if the Oh my. Listen,
[1:18:03] some nurses WERE CRYING.
[1:18:07] THEY WERE CRYING. THEY SAW ME dead
[1:18:14] and I'm alive.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Who has done this? Sister Elizabeth when
[1:18:18] he came to the hospital prophesied said,
[1:18:21] "Brother Kofi will rise up and come back
[1:18:24] and preach the gospel again."
[1:18:27] Sister Elizabeth, our own sister, spoke
[1:18:30] that to my family.
[1:18:33] That time I didn't know it. But what
[1:18:37] what what what are you looking for? The
[1:18:40] prophecy that he spoke has become what I
[1:18:44] was telling her Sunday. I said, "Sister,
[1:18:46] your prophecy while I was in Ghana
[1:18:50] was fulfilling alive. It has fulfilled
[1:18:54] here alive. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT GOD
[1:18:57] GOING TO USE YOU. We looking for
[1:19:00] something somewhere. No, look for your
[1:19:04] brother and sister. God is hidden in in
[1:19:06] us.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; The Lord is hidden in us from the pastor
[1:19:10] to the people.
[1:19:13] Okay? So have confidence. Talk to the
[1:19:16] Lord. If you doing something that is not
[1:19:20] good, cleaning your life, ask him for
[1:19:24] blessing.
[1:19:25] There's nothing wrong. Don't oh me alone
[1:19:29] carry the cross. You you alone don't
[1:19:32] carry the cross. The Lord has already
[1:19:34] carried for you.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; He want you to believe his word
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; so that he you could walk on the water.
[1:19:43] Why you trusting in him? You could walk
[1:19:45] on the sea.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; You could walk on this world pure white
[1:19:49] as snow
[1:19:51] because he's in you. His blessing is
[1:19:54] upon you. Who can do it? Nobody. Only
[1:19:57] the Lord. ONLY THE LORD, KING OF KING
[1:20:01] can do it.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; AND HE HAS DONE IT for me. Listen, the
[1:20:05] rest of my life, I will worship him.
[1:20:08] Whether I listen, I don't care whether I
[1:20:12] don't preach, whether I sit down,
[1:20:15] whether I walk on the street, whether I
[1:20:18] [laughter] Everywhere I go, I'm going to
[1:20:21] tell it. I'm going to let people know.
[1:20:25] Last time I was telling one white mine
[1:20:28] in my area what the Lord has done. The
[1:20:30] man look at me and I told him how I was
[1:20:32] dead and they were ready to come and
[1:20:34] tell my wife to to prepare for funeral
[1:20:36] home. And I said, "You looking at me
[1:20:39] what the Lord has done. I'm still back
[1:20:41] here." He He GO, "WOW.
[1:20:44] WOW."
[1:20:46] I COULD SEE the man I just grow in front
[1:20:49] of me. I said, "If you don't believe me,
[1:20:52] let's go to the hospital right the town
[1:20:55] we live and we go and ask." I said,
[1:20:59] "When I reach there, I'll show you some
[1:21:01] nurses. They will testify unto you what
[1:21:05] has happened that even I wouldn't OPEN
[1:21:07] MY MOUTH. GOD, YOU DON'T know what God
[1:21:11] going to use you for. I didn't know that
[1:21:14] I will be like this to see what the Lord
[1:21:18] has done for us. Good neighbor, this is
[1:21:22] a testimony unto the Lord. Only the Lord
[1:21:25] DID IT. OUR GOD IS REAL. THE GOD BROTHER
[1:21:29] ABRAHAM SPOKE IS SO REAL TO ME.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; HE'S SO REAL. Is he REAL TO YOU? THEN
[1:21:36] REJOICE. GIVE HIM PRAISE. Give him
[1:21:38] thanks. GIVE HIM GLORY. GIVE HIM HONOR.
[1:21:41] LET ME tell you, he's so real to me. I
[1:21:45] can't deny. Listen, you put a gun into
[1:21:49] my head with this gospel. I cannot deny
[1:21:52] the Bible. Now I know why in Africa or
[1:21:58] maybe is some areas the Muslims when
[1:22:02] they are so zerous for their religion
[1:22:05] but when they get converted in
[1:22:07] Christianity I I didn't know I was going
[1:22:09] to speak today right some of them
[1:22:14] they are prince they they are top of
[1:22:18] their family but when Christ reveal
[1:22:22] himself to them and they want to chop
[1:22:24] off their head. They are not afraid.
[1:22:27] They wanted to give their head for this
[1:22:30] for the Bible. What the Bible Jesus has
[1:22:34] done for them.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; YOU AND I KNOW HIM IN REALITY OF HIS
[1:22:39] POWER AND of his resurrection.
[1:22:42] We know, we see what the Lord has done.
[1:22:45] Since Pastor Simon was preaching to us,
[1:22:48] what haven't we see? I have walked with
[1:22:51] him. I have slept with him. I've seen
[1:22:54] how the Lord move through that that e
[1:22:58] pastor to me. I'VE SEEN GOD USE HIM
[1:23:03] MIGHTILY. Thanksgiving church here we
[1:23:06] never seen.
[1:23:08] And I'm tell I'm just saying my heart
[1:23:11] like I'm going with a brother now. He's
[1:23:13] a preacher.
[1:23:15] That brother right there I'm going to
[1:23:17] leave you five minutes time. That
[1:23:20] brother right there, we were talking in
[1:23:21] my language. Pastor Son was sitting
[1:23:23] there
[1:23:25] in the front of the car. We were sitting
[1:23:28] at the back. All of a sudden, the
[1:23:31] brother asked me, "Your pastor speak
[1:23:36] Ghana language." I said, "No,
[1:23:39] we were talking in my language."
[1:23:42] Pastor Simmon just turned his head.
[1:23:46] He says you are saying this da da da da
[1:23:49] da da da da da.
[1:23:53] We speaking my language. My language. Me
[1:23:56] and the brother. Pastor Simon interpret
[1:24:00] every word to word.
[1:24:04] Then when he speak he turn his head
[1:24:08] front.
[1:24:09] Then the brother got shocked.
[1:24:13] Kovi, you said the man doesn't speak
[1:24:17] our your our language. How is he
[1:24:20] interpreting it? Pos says, "Do you
[1:24:23] believe God
[1:24:25] speak all the languages?"
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; You say you believe the Lord and this is
[1:24:32] what the people ARE LIKE
[1:24:35] WHEN IT COMES to court. This brother I'm
[1:24:37] talking, he can preach. He knows all the
[1:24:41] le
[1:24:43] in the Bible but he never seen reality
[1:24:46] like that. But when it shock him like
[1:24:50] that that you SEE BECAUSE THERE THAT one
[1:24:53] you can't take education and interpret
[1:24:56] it
[1:24:58] is coming put it this way I I put it in
[1:25:01] my way raw. No education to it. The word
[1:25:05] is coming.
[1:25:08] He says, "Do you believe God in can
[1:25:11] speak all languages? He's the one that
[1:25:13] make all languages."
[1:25:16] Then a song strike the brother heart.
[1:25:23] I He says, "Almighty God,
[1:25:28] you are the mighty God.
[1:25:31] There is no one like you." He started
[1:25:34] singing and crying. I was sitting with
[1:25:38] the brother I joined him started singing
[1:25:41] and crying
[1:25:43] right because why in reality like that
[1:25:49] it shook off
[1:25:51] the intellectuals away they don't want
[1:25:55] that
[1:25:57] but me kofi that's what I want
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; when you want to talk about god talk
[1:26:03] about god in reality what our pastor was
[1:26:05] showing
[1:26:07] talking with the pastor then the crowd
[1:26:09] come right you go in the Bible is there
[1:26:14] you look it's right there on him right
[1:26:19] what do you going to say the
[1:26:21] intellectual person what he going to say
[1:26:23] God is not real THE LORD IS REAL HE DOES
[1:26:28] THE SAME THING HE DID TO MOSES HE DOES
[1:26:31] THE SAME THING HE DID TO WILLIAM ABRAHAM
[1:26:34] HE'S DOING THE SAME THING WITH HIS WIFE.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; HE NEVER EVER EVER CHANGE.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Let us believe him.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; His present is here.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; How many believe the Lord is here?
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, our God is real.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; OUR GOD IS REAL. YOU AND I, God is real.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; I was dead. I am alive. But Son came
[1:27:03] there. He said, "Braovi is not dead.
[1:27:05] He's sleeping." BROTHERS, SISTERS, YOUR
[1:27:09] BROTHER WAS DEAD. OH,
[1:27:12] [laughter]
[1:27:15] I WAS DEAD. [screaming]
[1:27:16] COMPLETELY DEAD. EVEN WHEN I WAKE up the
[1:27:21] way I was, I said, "Lord, if the way I
[1:27:24] am, if this,
[1:27:26] if I die again and it will going to
[1:27:28] glorify you, let let me go. If not, then
[1:27:32] heal me." All of a sudden within one
[1:27:34] week, two week my body begin to bum bum
[1:27:37] bum bum b. I'm standing here today.
[1:27:40] Listen, I'm so happy in my heart. I
[1:27:43] DON'T HAVE NO BITTERNESS ONE BIT BECAUSE
[1:27:47] AND MY HEART IS AT PEACE. When you talk
[1:27:51] about peace, you see me even I MAY NOT
[1:27:55] TALK. BUT WHEN YOU TALK about peace,
[1:27:59] Jesus said, "My peace I give it ONTO
[1:28:02] YOU." NOT AS THE WORLD GAVE.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; We need that peace.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Don't we want that peace? As soon as you
[1:28:12] get that peace, it's not about money.
[1:28:15] Oh, it's not about popularity. It's not
[1:28:18] about education. It's not about how much
[1:28:22] people love you. people because we
[1:28:24] humanity we have sit in the message for
[1:28:27] so long. Some people can pretend they
[1:28:29] are so good.
[1:28:32] We humans we do that and underneath is
[1:28:36] nothing but a snake or cobra hiding
[1:28:40] there. The Lord knows the heart.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; And when the heart is right,
[1:28:48] then when it's time for him to strike
[1:28:51] the seed, for that seed to bring forth,
[1:28:56] YOUR SEED TO BRING FORTH, MY SEED to
[1:28:58] bring forth, the Lord bring it. And it
[1:29:02] is a perfume. Yes,
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; it Saudi Arabia they have I think Saudi
[1:29:09] Arabia or Egypt one of them they have
[1:29:12] the best perfume in the world when you
[1:29:15] when you use it when you are you pass
[1:29:18] here one week that smell will fill this
[1:29:20] womb because why the Lord perfume on you
[1:29:25] when it bring it alive people will
[1:29:28] rejoice people will seize it
[1:29:32] will shock you you yourself.
[1:29:35] He shock you and shake you.
[1:29:39] You know you haven't done nothing but
[1:29:41] you give glory to him. And he says,
[1:29:44] "Son, daughter,
[1:29:46] this is me. I the Lord be not afraid.
[1:29:51] If you need anything, ask me. Ask me.
[1:29:57] You need, you are short of things, ask
[1:29:59] me. I am a provider. Don't be lazy. If
[1:30:03] you are lazy, I won't give it to you.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; It's not your boss. It's not your work.
[1:30:12] It's ether
[1:30:14] on me and let me youal
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; then everything will be perfect.
[1:30:22] Sorry for my broken words. This is all I
[1:30:25] have for you.
[1:30:28] God bless you. God be with you. God be
[1:30:32] with our pastor. Whoever is watching
[1:30:35] this broken west, I didn't come tonight
[1:30:39] to preach. I come to share what the Lord
[1:30:44] did in my country.
[1:30:47] And I'm so blessed
[1:30:51] by God what he has done. The Lord bless
[1:30:55] you all.
[1:30:59] the the phone leader can come up.
[1:31:39] God bless you.
[1:31:41] As we dismiss, we're going to sing. What
[1:31:43] gift of grace?
