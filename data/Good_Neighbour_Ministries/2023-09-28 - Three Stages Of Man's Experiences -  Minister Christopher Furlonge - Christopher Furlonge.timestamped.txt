[28:28] he was a
[28:31] a rich man he doesn't have need of
[28:32] anything
[28:33] man
[28:35] but he was lacking one thing
[28:39] he wasn't satisfied with the life he was
[28:41] living
[28:43] and many of us
[28:45] that are here tonight
[28:47] we might acquire all these good things
[28:49] in life man like even the The Prodigal
[28:53] Son man he had it made for him
[28:57] because it came a point in time in his
[28:59] life
[29:00] he asks for like give me what you have
[29:02] for me
[29:04] I want to go and have some experience of
[29:06] any world
[29:08] men
[29:10] because he had
[29:12] something
[29:13] lacking in him
[29:15] and I would like to or maybe a little
[29:18] bit later on to give you a little bit
[29:20] about my testimony
[29:23] man
[29:24] it's good to testify about the Lord
[29:27] of your experience with him
[29:32] how did you get your candle lit
[29:34] man
[29:36] amen hallelujah because that you become
[29:40] an example to them that God can change
[29:43] lives
[29:46] you are going down a rocky dangerous
[29:49] road
[29:50] man I don't know
[29:53] how what were the Lord or what
[29:56] channel the Lord is going to take us
[29:58] here tonight but I just trusting in Him
[30:01] tonight
[30:02] amen because in myself I ain't got many
[30:05] much to say to you but when he speaks
[30:08] you know something is going to happen
[30:10] Hallelujah
[30:12] and I trusted in him tonight amen
[30:15] Hallelujah you see Nicodemus had
[30:17] questions
[30:19] amen
[30:20] amen he wanted to know amen
[30:24] Hallelujah
[30:25] praise God
[30:29] he said rabbi we know that thou art a
[30:34] teacher come from God
[30:37] and many people know that you are
[30:40] God-fearing person
[30:42] and there's something in your life
[30:46] that demonstrate that there is something
[30:48] more than what they have that they would
[30:51] want man
[30:53] and you need to share that with them
[30:56] and to be a witness to them how God
[31:00] changed your life amen hallelujah
[31:03] so Nicodemus wanted you know he said no
[31:06] this man they're called Jesus amen I
[31:09] know but an assurance
[31:12] with a surety that he came from God
[31:16] man Hallelujah
[31:20] and thou do as miracles
[31:23] and accept God be accept God be with him
[31:27] amen and the people know that God is
[31:30] with you
[31:32] Man by the life you demonstrate
[31:36] man Hallelujah
[31:38] so it is not only to be in church here
[31:41] to put on a religious act amen
[31:44] hallelujah but when you're out in the
[31:46] womb that is that you become a minister
[31:53] men and women children the children in
[31:57] his school amen the life you demonstrate
[31:59] to your fellow students they're gonna
[32:03] know there's a difference in you
[32:05] Hallelujah
[32:07] and Jesus said verily verily I say unto
[32:09] you except a man be born again
[32:15] so there is something there
[32:18] got to be born again

[32:24] mom and my dad and my mom gave birth to
[32:26] me I'm already here why should I be born
[32:29] again what kind of
[32:32] a a statement is that that you're going
[32:34] to be born again
[32:36] but
[32:37] from the understanding from
[32:41] our
[32:42] Prophet amen hallelujah
[32:45] the 20th century Prophet man
[32:49] Hallelujah you were born wrong to begin
[32:53] with
[32:54] and so you're going to have to get the
[32:57] right birth
[32:59] amen hallelujah I want to make this by
[33:02] God's help and Grace make this simple to
[33:06] you
[33:06] amen hallelujah

[33:11] child can understand it men because God
[33:15] is a god of simplicity
[33:18] amen Hallelujah
[33:21] to him be praised on on Glory tonight
[33:24] amen you see we were supposed to come by
[33:28] the spoken word
[33:32] and to be born again you need to be you
[33:35] need to come by the spoken word for your
[33:39] hour for your day
[33:42] amen hallelujah man
[33:45] glory be to God and that is just
[33:47] unfolding how God is showing his
[33:51] children these things
[33:53] amen hallelujah
[33:56] prayers be to his name
[33:58] thank you Lord
[34:00] Hallelujah
[34:02] you see the
[34:05] Rich Young Ruler
[34:08] amen he was rich he was wrong and he had
[34:12] position
[34:13] he was a high society person so really
[34:16] and truly he didn't lack anything
[34:19] Naturally Speaking but deep down inside
[34:23] of him he knew that there was something
[34:27] lacking
[34:29] he need to have a real experience
[34:33] amen hallelujah because he had all your
[34:36] experiences out there gaining money
[34:39] wealth popularity and everything else
[34:43] amen he had all that experience that the
[34:46] world could have offered to him
[34:48] but you see this to be born again that
[34:52] was a natural birth amen but to be
[34:56] spiritually born it could take spiritual
[34:58] things
[35:00] amen hallelujah it's only going to take
[35:03] God to do that for you
[35:06] amen hallelujah
[35:07] thank you Lord Jesus
[35:10] praise be to his name
[35:12] glory to God
[35:15] so when he could not
[35:17] accept
[35:21] the solution to his problem
[35:24] man
[35:25] he was very much disappointed
[35:28] and you know sometimes when we get this
[35:31] solution to our situation to our
[35:34] problems amen you know we sometimes we
[35:37] question it
[35:39] we question it sometimes we feel it's
[35:42] too hard
[35:44] or it may be too simple
[35:47] like the the lady the ruler who had when
[35:52] it is Philip I believe oh
[35:56] baptized in the Jordan River
[35:58] I believe it is right amen
[36:01] amen hallelujah that song Too simple
[36:04] for him but that was the answer to his
[36:07] problem
[36:08] amen hallelujah
[36:09] praise God
[36:12] praise God
[36:14] you see on the day of Pentecost
[36:20] and Pentecost as I always say as
[36:22] plenticost
[36:25] the Christian life is not easy it's not
[36:29] a better roses
[36:30] by now you should realize that
[36:33] man
[36:35] by all the opposition
[36:37] all the these things the the things that
[36:41] people say
[36:43] about you and to you
[36:46] amen why are you following that church
[36:48] why are you doing this why are you doing
[36:50] that you could have stayed you know home
[36:52] and do something else or
[36:55] you know something always the enemy
[36:59] always puts something to discourage you
[37:02] from serving God
[37:04] all the time or you're too tired tonight
[37:09] you know
[37:11] well last night I didn't sleep too well
[37:13] you know so I had to stay home and get
[37:15] some rest
[37:16] but you see these things this sacrifice
[37:20] that you make for God always pay big
[37:28] man
[37:29] you see God don't own no man
[37:35] you sacrifice your time your talent and
[37:39] everything to him God pays you big
[37:43] man you don't maybe understand it right
[37:46] now but you see later on it's down the
[37:48] road you're going to look back and see
[37:51] how God took you through and brought you
[37:54] out that situations
[37:56] men Hallelujah by simple a simple thing
[38:00] as attending church
[38:03] man making yourself present here
[38:07] man Hallelujah
[38:10] so if the Lord should come tonight amen
[38:12] and only for those who hear
[38:16] what's going to happen to the others man
[38:19] Hallelujah
[38:20] so live today like it's the last
[38:26] we gotta work yes we gotta do things yes
[38:29] amen but make your sacrifice unto him
[38:34] Hallelujah
[38:36] simple things to be reminded of
[38:39] glory be to God
[38:41] Hallelujah
[38:44] as we said
[38:45] Pentecost has plenty cause
[38:57] and the last time we touched on
[39:02] only the predestinated seed can be born
[39:07] again
[39:08] because there's something inside of them
[39:11] to be born again
[39:13] to be dominated to be to be brought
[39:16] alive amen and you have to come with
[39:19] that amen you can't buy yourself into it
[39:23] man you can't walk yourself into it
[39:26] you have to be you have to be in the
[39:29] mind of God before the foundations of
[39:32] the world to be expressed here now as a
[39:37] son and as a daughter of God
[39:39] amen hallelujah
[39:42] and to be born again as we touched last
[39:45] time is to have a need to change
[39:49] amen
[39:51] amen
[39:53] so if you know that your nature hasn't
[39:56] been changed go check back on the
[39:59] experience you had
[40:01] amen if it was a true Born Again
[40:03] experience
[40:05] man if you're continuing the things of
[40:08] the world and have that is desire and I
[40:12] learning a deep desire inside to just go
[40:15] out in the world and do the things that
[40:17] it was something wrong with your
[40:19] experience
[40:20] and don't let Satan come and lie to you
[40:23] now if you're a true Born Again
[40:25] experience and it kind of let it gets
[40:28] you know a little bit lukewarm go back
[40:30] to where you started off
[40:32] man Hallelujah
[40:35] praise God
[40:40] and we spoke a little bit about a woman
[40:42] from Canaan
[40:44] amen who had
[40:49] a deep
[40:51] a situation happening with her man
[40:55] and she had to press
[40:58] her away for her blessings
[41:02] and tonight
[41:04] press your way into the kingdom of God
[41:08] press your way for your blessing tonight
[41:12] you have a desire for whatever it may be
[41:16] the enemy don't give it to you easy
[41:20] you know something is going to happen
[41:22] and he will put every obstacle in the
[41:24] way to prevent you from getting it
[41:28] amen that job you're looking for

[42:13] you can't join a church
[42:16] amen
[42:17] you've got to be born into that church
[42:21] you got to have that Born Again
[42:23] experience into the living body and the
[42:28] spirit of the Living God Amen into that
[42:31] church
[42:32] amen if you're joined our natural
[42:34] churches just like joining our lodge
[42:36] amen hallelujah but when you're born
[42:39] into the kingdom of God you're born into
[42:42] the living
[42:43] Hallelujah the spirit of the Living God
[42:46] Amen Hallelujah and you have that real
[42:49] true experience that will anchor you
[42:52] amen you'll give your anchor post that
[42:55] you can look back at typos in your life
[42:57] so you know and that certain time you
[43:00] know God gave me this experience you
[43:02] open up my understanding to know that I
[43:05] am a son that I am a daughter of God
[43:09] men Hallelujah it's not that
[43:13] you just been made a son you were always
[43:17] a son but is Daniel recognize that I am
[43:22] a son and I am a daughter of God Amen
[43:26] Hallelujah
[43:28] praise God
[43:30] Hallelujah
[43:31] thank you Lord Jesus
[43:34] and tonight I just want to
[43:38] go into
[43:41] these three stages of a man's experience
[43:46] amen hallelujah
[43:49] Amino
[43:51] natural Iman is made of body
[43:54] soul and spirit amen
[43:58] amen
[44:00] just as we have the Christian walk
[44:03] we have justification
[44:06] sanctification and the baptism of the
[44:09] Holy Ghost amen praise God
[44:12] so in Natural Things man has three steps
[44:16] and also in spiritual things man has
[44:19] three stages them man mine has been up
[44:22] like a Triune being Hallelujah we
[44:26] communicate with the natural world by
[44:28] our five senses
[44:30] man and we communicate with his soul by
[44:34] affection Amen Hallelujah by memory by
[44:39] conscience by reason Amen Hallelujah by
[44:42] imagination amen and that is the the
[44:46] Avenue that the the soul has been you
[44:50] can connect to the soul amen hallelujah
[44:53] praise God
[44:57] now I'd like to just take a little type
[45:01] from
[45:02] the temple Solomon's Temple or the
[45:06] temple that was in the wilderness How It
[45:07] Was Made Up
[45:09] and give you a little reference of how
[45:13] you can have
[45:15] extreme experiences amen
[45:18] how man can have three experiences with
[45:22] God
[45:24] notice this manner
[45:29] is a very perfect type of the Holy Ghost
[45:34] remember Mana fell every night and they
[45:37] had to get a new Supply every day amen
[45:42] they had to get a supply every day
[45:46] man
[45:47] so that's so what you experience
[45:50] yes you say I have a born-again
[45:52] experience but you know from the
[45:55] children of the in Israel
[45:59] when they were hungry they had to go
[46:01] they were crying for food and God gave
[46:04] them manna from above
[46:06] for them amen hallelujah
[46:11] and they had to pick it up every day and
[46:14] they could not keep it for another day
[46:17] otherwise it will turn
[46:20] wiggle tails of worms man
[46:23] now so with your experience
[46:26] you need something a new
[46:30] a a new uh
[46:34] experience every day with the Lord
[46:37] man
[46:39] as always our pastor say you can't Sail
[46:41] on yesterday's Breeze
[46:44] are you can't
[46:46] you know survive on yesterday's
[46:49] experience
[46:51] now if we take a if if we take a note
[46:55] here
[46:56] you know there are a lot of people
[46:58] around the prophet
[47:00] they were experiencing only Miracles all
[47:04] the healings and everything
[47:07] they had an experience then
[47:10] and they still continuing you know
[47:14] speaking about experience that you've
[47:17] had with the prophet physically and
[47:20] without understanding the deeper things
[47:23] that he was bringing to them
[47:25] man
[47:30] so they continue with that and it's it's
[47:33] gonna fade out
[47:36] All I'm gonna talk about the healings
[47:38] the Miracles that this and that and yet
[47:40] but what about the food that he was
[47:43] storing up just as the Moses commanded
[47:48] Aaron to take some of that manner and
[47:52] put it into the holy of holies and it's
[47:54] going to remain fresh all the time
[47:59] and that what is what the prophet was
[48:02] doing stirring up Manna for us now to
[48:06] feed on not on healings and miracles
[48:09] alone
[48:11] man Hallelujah so they will continue
[48:13] talking about you know the prophet when
[48:15] they're hunting and he catch this and
[48:17] this and that and all our experience but
[48:20] what about the hidden manner that he
[48:22] stood up I have a feeling on that
[48:27] for now
[48:29] man
[48:30] amen hallelujah for now amen hallelujah
[48:34] blessed be his wonderful name amen you
[48:37] see that Manara came down amen
[48:41] Hallelujah
[48:42] a priest didn't give
[48:44] Big Data make that for them that was
[48:47] Heavenly Mana
[48:49] man Hallelujah
[48:51] and they couldn't buy it or or do
[48:53] something else no interference with that
[48:57] none whatsoever
[49:00] so that is what happened when the Seven
[49:03] Seas were broke man Mana came out
[49:09] amen revealed word for this hour came
[49:12] out
[49:14] amen Raptor in feet came out from that
[49:18] and you have to feed on that as your
[49:22] feet and your natural body as it changes
[49:24] along every day you have to feed on that
[49:27] spiritual manner to give you Rapture and
[49:29] Faith to change us to take us out of
[49:32] here
[49:34] Hallelujah
[49:37] so what is the experience are you
[49:40] feeding on that manner that is being
[49:43] present right now that is available for
[49:47] each and every one amen hallelujah but
[49:50] you know something if you eat Tamanna is
[49:54] it will be bitter in your belly
[49:56] it will give you a bitter experience
[49:59] man Hallelujah but you know what it's
[50:02] changing you
[50:03] it's changing from the inside out
[50:06] Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus
[50:09] amen hallelujah
[50:13] every day with Jesus is sweeter than the
[50:16] day before
[50:19] amen so you got to have a new experience
[50:22] every day and it's gonna draw you closer
[50:26] and closer to him it's going to give you
[50:29] bill you in this Tatia of a perfect man
[50:33] with more love more grace more humility
[50:36] and all those things that are going to
[50:38] make you mature amen a mature grain for
[50:43] his Harvest
[50:44] Hallelujah
[50:46] thank you Lord
[50:48] praise be to God hallelujah you see on
[50:51] the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost
[50:53] fell
[50:54] from Heaven amen they received their
[50:58] Manna for that day
[51:01] amen hallelujah
[51:03] and it's the same original Pentecost
[51:07] experience they had done with that
[51:10] manner that was filled that fell then
[51:12] you need to have it now too
[51:15] man Hallelujah
[51:17] yes David has spoken tongues
[51:20] but that was just an expression of the
[51:24] experience that they had
[51:27] amen
[51:29] explain it amen and you can explain
[51:33] actually you can explain the Born Again
[51:36] experience to somebody
[51:38] you can't give it to them they got to
[51:41] experience it for themselves
[51:43] Hallelujah
[51:47] thank you Lord
[51:48] thank you Father
[51:50] praise God
[51:52] and you see that experience as Peter was
[51:56] saying it's available
[51:59] it was available for it was available to
[52:03] them
[52:03] and it's available to us and to all
[52:07] those amen who are far off
[52:11] if not to this day amen hallelujah
[52:15] amen
[52:16] and there were three
[52:18] stages of everything back then and there
[52:22] are three stages of your experience
[52:25] no when we say we take a look at the the
[52:28] the the the temple
[52:30] we see the outer Court
[52:32] man
[52:34] and as I asked there are experiences out
[52:37] on the outer Court
[52:39] amen
[52:41] and don't let your experience and their
[52:44] outer Court determine your stand with
[52:47] the Lord
[52:50] amen
[52:51] because these natural Sun was shining in
[52:55] the outer Court
[52:56] rain could be fallen amen you have some
[53:00] rainy days
[53:01] man sad days amen
[53:04] so mopedes man some trials and testing
[53:09] this amen so don't let that determine
[53:12] your stand with the Lord that's just on
[53:15] the outer Court
[53:16] digest and experience on the outer court
[53:19] but God wants to take a man a little
[53:21] step further
[53:23] amen
[53:25] and a little step further
[53:27] he would take he was going to take him
[53:29] to the inner
[53:31] amen the force God
[53:33] where there was artificial life
[53:37] amen hallelujah
[53:40] the candles Scandal stick amen so if you
[53:44] run out of oil then
[53:46] amen if you ever run outside your
[53:49] experience if you're a run out of some
[53:51] uh
[53:52] some Holy Ghost experience
[53:56] amen
[53:57] you'll feel dong
[53:59] your iron low
[54:01] amen hallelujah so it's going to
[54:04] determine now
[54:05] and the physical environment that you're
[54:08] in amen go determine your mood and
[54:12] whatever you have around you
[54:14] so don't let that alone determine who
[54:18] you really are
[54:20] amen hallelujah
[54:22] you see the next man come into the first
[54:25] Court there were seven golden
[54:27] candlestick

[54:35] the lamps moved up
[54:37] he lived by an artificial light someday
[54:41] he was up someday he was down and
[54:44] someday he must be all to the ground
[54:48] amen
[54:49] right that's the way with the Christian
[54:52] experience
[54:54] if you're only living in a Justified
[54:57] State going to church and saying well I
[55:01] did the best I can

[55:17] going to wonder and whether Miracles are
[55:20] right or not you're going to wonder if

[55:26] the enemy comes around and tells you see
[55:28] what you just do that see
[55:32] you really ain't safe enough

[56:19] with the church again with that
[56:23] they're the seven candlesticks where the
[56:26] offering was only made and the sacrifice
[56:29] burned
[56:30] and you still have Smoky days and rainy
[56:33] days cloudy days days when the light was

[57:16] process

[57:21] to know why all the trials and testing
[57:24] and all the things that come in around

[1:09:53] Satan can't pull on that and send you to
[1:09:56] the bathroom to send you to the the
[1:09:58] nightclub and the dance party and

[1:10:52] born again but you've got to demonstrate
[1:10:55] by the way you live that the experience
[1:10:58] you have that you're truly born again
[1:11:02] amen
[1:11:03] Hallelujah
[1:11:06] many times we think that well if we are

[1:11:12] man we shouted we spoke with tongues or
[1:11:16] we money or manifested God in some way
[1:11:18] but Brethren you know that's not it
[1:11:24] we may see people jump shout dance cheat
[1:11:27] lie steal and everything else
[1:11:29] and we know that that isn't it
[1:11:34] born again that isn't it Hallelujah
[1:11:38] if you want
[1:11:40] praise God when Martin Luther said the
[1:11:44] just shall live by faith he said we got
[1:11:47] it and John we as he came along with
[1:11:50] something new and Luther was right
[1:11:54] so far as he said that Josh shall live
[1:11:58] by faith and he thought he had it but he
[1:12:00] found out that wasn't it there was a
[1:12:03] step higher than that man Hallelujah
[1:12:06] where's he came man yes shouted he said
[1:12:10] you got it amen and found out that they
[1:12:14] didn't have it Pentecost shouted
[1:12:17] speaking tongues
[1:12:19] shout dance and everything said they got
[1:12:22] it
[1:12:23] what did they really have it
[1:12:26] no they did
[1:12:27] Hallelujah
[1:12:29] and the fruit of the spirit is not
[1:12:32] shouting
[1:12:33] speaking in tongues
[1:12:35] that attributes of the Holy Spirit of
[1:12:38] course but it can be impersonated
[1:12:44] amen
[1:12:46] Hallelujah so if you want a true example
[1:12:51] amen
[1:12:53] listen
[1:12:55] or take your example or experience from
[1:12:59] Paul
[1:13:01] from characters in The Bible
[1:13:04] man Hallelujah
[1:13:07] if you want to match up your life match
[1:13:09] it up with Paul
[1:13:11] yes he was like that but look where God
[1:13:14] took him
[1:13:15] it took a true
[1:13:17] experience from God to knock him off his
[1:13:20] high horse
[1:13:21] for him to bite the dust amen Amen to
[1:13:25] turn his life around because when you
[1:13:28] you look at his life
[1:13:31] he was killing the very sad people that
[1:13:34] he was going to join up with
[1:13:36] man so when people see Paul coming or
[1:13:40] Saul as you may say no Paul's Saul do
[1:13:43] any questions or us all coming they were
[1:13:46] saying head's Gonna Roll boy they're
