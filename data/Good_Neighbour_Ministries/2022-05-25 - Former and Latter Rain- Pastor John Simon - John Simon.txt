god's grace but for now we will turn to joel chapter 2 verse 23 the 26th and we are speaking on this last lesson of the seven church ages it's been quite a run and quite a time but it's been a blessing all the way through by the way let me make you assured that even tonight i was called to let me know there are saints over there that are watching this right they're watching this and they have been listening this and more of them now are going to be watching this so just so that you might know praise the lord and be thankful of god for that hallelujah now in the book of joel chapter 2 reading from verse 23 be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he had given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former and the latter rain in the first month praise god and the floors shall be full of wheat thank god and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil praise his name and i will restore to you the years that the locusts had eaten the canker worm the caterpillar the primal worm my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat plenty thank god and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed thank god let us look to god father we thank you for this wonderful marvelous night of coming and being here with your people and lord as we look into the word of god and we have been announcing to the people over and over the church ages are over and now lord as we come to the ending of this teaching on the seven church ages this commentary by the spirit of god we pray that you will bless this last lesson and may burn its way into our hearts into our lives into our souls father that we may have the rapturing faith to step into the eighth day and to walk the way you want us to walk lord we committed to your hands in jesus name amen and amen please be seated now uh we ended last time by bringing your attention that the world council of churches is the image of the beast amen as the bride represents the image if you want to call it or of jesus christ and i'm saying that and then i'm reminded it's right behind me she is the stature of the perfect man who is jesus christ himself but what the world consular church's ecumenical council or the whole host of denominations represent is the image that satan or the picture or photograph of the beast amen you want to describe it another way or the shadow of this oncoming monster a spiritual uh cannibal that's on the way to the to to torment and destroy the the human race and you'll find the scriptures for that revelation 13 11 to 18. you read that when you have time we won't read that now but i want you to know that this is a picture of satan's bride you know we love to take pictures whenever we have a wedding but god has been uniting or has united with his bride but the devil is doing the same thing but he is doing it on the dark side uniting with his bride also amen and that bride is the organized system or the organized group right that he is uniting with but god has united and is uniting with a group that is free they're not only any bondage they're under no denomination they seem to be loose uh i don't mean in the negative sense but loosely gathered around the world wherever they are they're scattered everywhere and the only thing that binds them together is the revelation of the word of god hallelujah that's all right they're seeing the same word of god and that pulls them together glory to god hallelujah oh my and outside of that even when israel was brought out of egypt god didn't just loose them and let the pillar of fire alone guide them but they are guided by the pillar of fire the revealed word and the fivefold ministry that's on the ground the pillar of fire was supernatural leadership as you know that was leading god's people uh cloud by day fire by night but on the ground was visible leadership granted by god himself in the form of moses who later his spirit was put on seven men praise god jesus goes up to glory and sends back his spirit on the church and amongst them paul said god set in the church amen a five-fold ministry anointed by the same holy spirit placing them in the same position to lead the people of god here upon the earth praise god now we know my friends that this satan's brine was born in the planting and in the seeds of era but god's bride was born in the planting of the seed of truth who is none other than the lord jesus christ listen imperial rome that fell by the sword but she was healed from death from her death stroke when she joined to the nominal christian church of rome and incorporated paganism into christianity amen she incur incorporated paganism incorrupt into christianity so that when she comes into christianity she will be accepted or be acceptable these old babylonian pagan priests of astarte and venus and jupiter and all these various gods that they had god for reign god for harvest god for traveling god for this it still is here today under the name of saints what is the same thing that they have right now praise god hallelujah now we know that they became the holy roman empire it was no more the marshall empire of rome not one more the political empire of rome but now the religious empire of rome not under the leadership of a general or as such but under the leadership of a pope a religious leader that's leading them at this time hallelujah and we find that rome is slowly creeping her way back to total control and power and she is not doing it alone just as it was in the bible after jezebel took over israel then she married her daughter to another king from another country nearby and another one here so that she is slowly by marriage she's bringing all these countries that she control the whole place and they're doing the same thing by this denomination join with that one agree with the other one and that's one and they look like they're far apart but my friends that trinitarian lie that doctrine putting away the name of jesus christ hallelujah is draw wanna draw them all together and they're going to want to kill destroy and maim god's people because of their trinitarian doctrine why because when their trinitarian doctrine is absolutely totally proven false then their teaching their their their gates are nothing but a bottomless pit they don't have foundations whatsoever because the word of god does not support that amen but it does support one god the name of jesus christ baptism in the name of jesus christ hallelujah it only supports the fullness of the word of god so by her spiritually by her daughters that are right with her she will take over absolute authority through their world council of churches prophet is prophesying there it's happening we know we're in the midst of it it's happening it hasn't come to its full fruition but it now my friends this is what we're looking at oh praise god but i want you to know don't fear little sister there's a man here that can't turn on and he's turning on the light oh praise god and we thank god for the light that's being turned on hallelujah now right now the churches are already controlling politics and at the up opportune time at the right time when they can sense they can make their move they're gonna manifest exactly how great their control is over these kingdoms of the world right now they're not showing it they're loaning money here quietly in the background loaning money they're taking control here and the public doesn't know a thing about it a lot of these nations are already in debt right up to their necks and under the control of rome but she is not exercising or calling any of the debts as yet at the opportune time then that she's going to strike and when i just strike my friends they're going to have to give up hallelujah amen you see some of them are cooperating with rome many of them are enjoying their joining with rome because they have not yet envisioned that what happened during the years of inquisition could repeat again in this modern time they don't think it's possible anymore but thank god we have prophecy in the word of god thank god we have prophecy from the genuine god set prophet that has brought us the word of god and we recognize what is happening here oh glory to god amen yes sir yo my friends there it is revelation 17 3-6 write that down and study it again hallelujah oh my the bible states that mystery babylon is seated on the beast she is seated on this power that's below her what is this power it's the organized churches it's her daughter they look like there is no connection between them and rome because they're going to say oh i'm not roman catholic i'm baptist i'm not this i'm but they all are trinitarian amen it's the same doctrine that the mother put out that they're all having and holding to and when the time is right when their supper time is right they're all going to go right back to mother right back to mothers she's going to welcome them back and the prophet says here now notice she is controlling this last or fourth empire referring to daniel's vision the beast the the the that uh empire broken down from persia greece and so on right down to the toes uh like that that's what he referred to no amen church system under her rome will be controlling this image or orchard system see and they will be obedient to rome because rome controls all of the gold hallelujah in other words all of them need money to operate and the bigger the buildings is more money they need to operate and the more people they have is more money to cooperate yes the they're taking in a lot of money but they don't see they're falling into a trap they're falling into a trap and if you let me say this whole digital system we see that is now being spawned by satan is nothing but a web of lies and sin and traps to catch these evil bugs and flies that satan has scattered within this the whole world they're everywhere amen and they will be obedient to her thus all the people will have to belong to that church system or they will be put out and be at the mercy of the elements that means you know i don't have to expand or not out to your house out in church buildings out or whatever you're out of everything you'll be put out amen if you got a mortgage it's gone amen do you know that even when you pay off your mortgage and your so-called own your land do you know that the government can still come and put you off that land they can do it they got laws of expropriations laws of emergency they got several layers of laws that can put you off your own land brother bill all see and it's so evil but it's sitting there lying like a cat waiting ready to pounce because when the hour is ripe and they're ready to do it they'll act upon their their motivations listen now notice i want you to see this there will the people will be at the mercy of the elements for they will not be able they cannot buy nor sell without the mark of the beast in their hand or on their head amen they won't be able to do business no business they won't be able to buy nor sell no trading whatsoever whether buying selling you can't do it because of the mark of the beast you don't have any membership to her you don't have no connection to her uh whatever listen oh my yes my friends the mark in the head means that those that take that doctrine of the world church system which the main doctrine is trinitarianism amen that is the mark that will be put in the head hallelujah and some already got the mark because the mark is in the head all these things is because they have no revelation people are imagining some mysterious marks they're designing all kinds of 666 their design they say design that design yeah the prophet said it's already here and the mark is the trinitarianism that is the mark that they're back with in their head their mind their thinking is all controlled by trinitarianism you understand once you start from that point of view don't you see from there your thinking is going to be a certain way you're going to think certain ways the principles are different from the word of god and it's going to go off in many many ways contrary to this word and unconsciously without being told that you will be anti-christ with that mark in your head you're the antichrist make a just go to somebody that is in the trinitarian church try to tell him about one god and right away they're gonna say no that's a lie that's not true and they're gonna want to fight with you unless if that's an elected seed hiding under our god place them on the at jezebel's table for a season until he calls them out other than that my friends they already have the antichrist spirit on them in a strong form or in a mild form right it might be so mild they don't even know they got it you're branded and you don't know you got branded my goodness gracious have mercy continue listen now that is the mark in the head see that will be the doctrine you must take the doctrine of the world church system and that is trinitarianism hallelujah do you have that now straight the mark in the head is none of these mysterious things people are suggesting and drawing and and everything else it's simple the prophet points it out and the devil can't confuse us with all of his various things that he's throwing out there because the prophet clearly said the mark in the head or the mind or the thinking is trinitarianism now the mark in the hand see will mean you must do the will of that world church whatever works whatever you they want you to do you will have to do it that is the symbol he says here of the mark in the hand now with this great power amen hallelujah to control the mind by trinitarianism to control the works actions and everything else of that person hallelujah this this will be used this great power the church systems will then want to persecute the bride i ask you a simple question why why because she is in total or we say diametrically opposed to the trinitarianism with the faith in one god and his name is jesus christ there is no bending there is no bowing there is no burning there is no backing away she is not ashamed of him she is ready to bear the reproach for the word she stands on the word of god hallelujah and there is nothing about it she doesn't have any arguments or whatever she just stands there with the word of god there is one god his name is jesus christ there is none before him beside him behind them below him oh praise god there's only one and his name is jesus christ hallelujah amen and so they will persecute the bride hallelujah listen let me put it this way do you know if uh somebody brings a counterfeit coin or can defeat bill to you and you don't have an original to make a comparison whether with a magnifying glass or feeling with your hands or whatever do you know you'll never know the difference if i brought a counterfeit to you first so you don't know the real yet you're going to accept that counterfeit because you don't know the real so the person that is presenting that counterfeit if they know you have the original or true bill don't want you to bring that original new that original thing the real thing close to the other one so a comparison can be made you see that's why the pharisees and statues kill jesus because he didn't even have to hardly say anything because just the way he lived how he taught how he walked the comparison when he came to serve there came to rule when he came to do this they did something opposite he was showing them up he was revealing their true colors and so they couldn't stand that they had to get rid of him so the people could see them alone and so they will want to get rid of the true bride because of our revelation faith and pronouncements of the word of god that she's given forth and they don't want the people to know so they have no other choice if you want to put it that way before their time of darkness can fully come in but to persecute the bride hallelujah this image will persecute her by trying to keep her the bride from preaching from teaching amen they will you see have our ministers there will be forbidden to give any comfort and truth to the people who will need it hallelujah oh my oh praise god he says but before the antichrist now his spirit is here but before the antichrist comes in person and he has it in church book in person in other words in flesh walking amongst the people amen and takes over this complete world system of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with our lord god will catch his bride away and take her to the great marriage supper of the lamb can you praise god for that come he said thank you lord hallelujah amen yes sir oh praise god prophet said now let us trace the two churches as we have been doing and them two spirits from pentecost right now to the consummation of these ages hallelujah oh my now we know that the age started after the turn of the 20th century he's talking about the odyssey and church age now started at the turn of the 20th century it was to be an age in which the true church would return to being the bride that she was at pentecost hallelujah then if the bride is to be restored to your original condition oh hallelujah he didn't say it this way not only must she have a restoration of the word but he does say this she must also have a return to dynamic power is that right so because you know paul said he said i preach what paul preached and paul said we don't just preach word only but we preach the word with demonstrations of the spirit under the power of god hallelujah amen it may not be like hope pentecost has it but we certainly preach the word with the demonstration of the spirit of god and the power and the presence of the living god hallelujah and listen brother sister this is increasing right now the bride god has had her covered up or veiled so that she could grow into maturity right without being hindered by the systems right now we still allowed to preach we still allowed to teach some of us still have some ordination and registration and stuff like that and god is allowing it but the time will come we will not be able to do it we won't be able to marry we'll be able to do anything of that we won't be able to preach from a pulpit we we may have to hide to do it but the prophet is telling you this is coming but before that really happens it may start happening in a minor way but before it goes to the full persecution he says this bride is going right out of here thanks be to god now at pentecost the believers sense in their spirit this return of dynamic power and began crying to god for a new outpouring of the holy spirit hallelujah now what seemed to be the answer to their prayer came and caused many to begin to speak with towns hallelujah and to manifest gifts of the spirit it was then believed that that was the long-awaited restoration oh my it was not let me repeat that modern pentecost was not the restoration of the church going to be the bride similar to what was at pentecost in the apostolic times as powerful as it was as wonderful as it was it was not the return for how could it be for the latter rain can only come after the former rain the former rain is the spring rain or the teaching rain you know what the spring rain does the spring rain you know let me just let you know this it's the prophet's message that was and is the former rain the spring rain that when those rains fall it wakes up the seeds that were hidden under the ground during the dark times of winter right you typed that in your head on your heart concerning the church ages and all the seeds that were out there the prophet's message came to wake up the seeds hallelujah and bring them back to life see oh my the spring rain or also the teaching rain amen hallelujah now the latter rain is the harvest rain how could this be the real thing for the teaching reign had not come for the teaching reign the prophet messenger was the one sent to teach the people hallelujah and his message had not come and here we find he is calling that the former rain they're looking back and thinking that the pentecost that was back there in the book of acts that is the former rain and now down here they have an outpouring of the holy ghost this they called the latter rain but god doesn't have it that way no sir see god says the prophet's message is the former reign for this age that's the way it is and the latter rain is the harvest rain oh praise god let me give you some scriptures you can write this down joel chapter 2 verse 23 isaiah chapter 28 verses 7 to 21 acts chapter 3 verses 19 to 26 amen you see the prophet messengers had not yet turned the hearts of the children back to the pentecostal fathers that had not yet come oh my thus what was thought to be the restoration or the final quickening onto the rapture hallelujah had not come amen but we know now it has come hallelujah it has come now we're being quickly right now like he said there it's right there quickening for the rapture the final quickening for the rapture now comes praise god there's some things some more you must realize in just a little while yet but listen see the mix now there there that coming of the latter rain as they're speaking of he said in it came a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of the spiritual blessings and manifesting in the holy ghost also and we keep pointing it to you that in there they had devil power as men who were under control of devils and yet they didn't seem to realize it and to prove that it was not real these people after a second generation of the pair i had already organized and began to write scriptural doctrines and build fences our walls uh as every other group ahead of them did now what he's saying here let me let me say this what he is saying here we know that that was devil power or enticing a religious spirit operating and hiding in the religious realm to carry out satan's orders for if that was a true lottery it will draw the people to the world is that right he says but watch he said shortly after didn't take any time they immediately start to form denominations organizations write up all kinds of false doctrine you see the devil's job always to confuse the issue around the truth to make it harder for the people to see the truth because now when you had one truth now he throws he he has a dozen and billions of which one is really right he's and they're left wandering and they're left wondering what really is right see so we see that was the judas spirit return hallelujah did you get that simple as that oh my remember when jesus had come to earth and was upon the earth so was judas so when that anointing comes down for the former rain then down comes the spirit of judas also which is also a religious spirit just as much as cain and if you trace them all down they're all religious spirits but they come to fight against the spirit of jesus christ amen oh my but you see they both come down but each come from a different spirit one comes from the spirit of god and the other one comes from the spirit of satan on the earth hallelujah and the bible tells us after they both died you got to recognize that they both died same day people don't understand the obscure small little scriptures they just pass over they don't realize that the same day that jesus hung on the cross and died the bible says satan judas went and hung himself with remorse right remorse like jew like like esau sought repentance with tears but he couldn't get it right why because he had already uh grieved the holy spirit and there it was that the prophet said and they each went to their respective or predestinated places is that right oh my another place he said look at the two thieves on the cross the one said lord remember me jesus said today you will be with me in paradise hallelujah where is the destination paradise the presence of god he's going right hallelujah in the presence of god but he turns around and says the other one said you call yourself listen call him name he said well you know come off the cross and the other thief had to turn to him and say man don't you don't you understand here what's going on he said lord remember me amen he said and the other one went to his inheritance amen he went to his destination listen what the prophet says here he says they both died and each went to their own place hallelujah where are we going at if you were in the mind of god you're predestinated to go in the rapture and you have a place waiting you in heaven but that's what he's talking about hallelujah when it comes to heaven you'll find scripture where god talks and such and such but there was no place found for him in heaven but there's a place for him in hell amen all right praise god hallelujah now so then what happened jesus died went back to the heaven say uh judas died went to hell listen to the prophets with the wisdom of the of the spirit through the prophet god takes his man but the spirit remains he doesn't take the spirit so jesus died but the spirit that was in him is still there ready to fall on any or all who would have the same seeds of within their hearts hallelujah oh my so then when jesus the spirit of christ or the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost then we find that the spirit of judas came down also and fell on the false church he said but there was no false church formed yet no it wasn't formed in a a system as yet but it fell on people like uh ananias and the fire it fell on you can go through the book of acts and you find it already operating on liars is operating on different people oh my it was surely the spirit of jesus and judas back to the old conflict the same uh greatest battle ever fought as you know started in heaven dropped to earth ran all these ages right through it's god versus satan and right now that battle continues now with the contest is still on hallelujah amen yes sir oh my you see the book of revelation tells us already that's what was going to happen and the prophet refers to see now don't you know don't you understand that judah's spirit came back as the white horse rider the rider on the white horse see why it was white it was religious oh my and that white also means that it was close to the real right close to the real just as judah stuck so close to jesus so that everybody else will think oh he's a christian oh he's one of jesus disciples oh he's a real follower and then when jesus is not around then when he go and preach or teach those people something totally opposite they will accept it with their full heart because they believe he's teaching what jesus was teaching and so he stuck close to jesus like that amen prophet said now that spirit that same spirit is now with the leader of the nicolaitan system and it it became the triple crown pope who sat off god in his temple calling himself the viker of christ which means instead of christ or in place of christ or on behalf of god imagine that a pope calling himself the holy ghost in other words amen or actually that was the posing of the holy ghost see and acting for him see that was nothing but the jew the spirit in him doing that again see how he conquered see how he was going forth to conquer under lies and deceit that is how he's going forth to conquer christ did not do that the only ones that came to him were predestinated by him right he didn't have to deceive people to follow him but jesus as a servant went forth taking the word of the living god hallelujah amen oh praise god what about the true seed then while satan is doing that it will happen as god has said the people of god are now being made ready for the word of truth amen for the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to the word where they were at the beginning hallelujah praise god joel 2 you read it in there rejoice be glad your children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he had given you the former reign moderately and it will cost to come down upon you both former and latter rain in the first month do you know we are enjoying that right now is all right we are enjoying the prophet's message or the teaching reign we're still enjoying it even though he has gone but didn't he say after the former rain he said has to come the latter rain oh my think about it now remember the lutheran age did not restore the western age did not restore pentecostal age did not restore but god has to restore and not deny his word so this church that's coming up is not a resurrection of that church back there no it's not a resurrection but it's a restoration hallelujah of the same and i use these terms principles values uh revelations of the word will be the same hallelujah praise god hallelujah so that's the way it will be god will take the church right back amen it tells why we need restoration and we need it and he says it here because the locust the conquer worm the pillar caterpillar and the former worm have eaten everything out but the root and small bits of the stem so we have had these and i have my own note beside here saying the bugs eating at the church's foundation that is what satan has done you see the first wood ant and you don't pay no attention to it brother brother bill or you don't pay any attention you guys just one would end but then they're multiplying where they're multiplying you think they multiply under the open they go in the wood and then they start to multiply and eating out all the faith eating out all the broadly kindness eating out the godliness and then when you go now to lean on it crash the whole thing it's nothing but a crash because they've been eating away at all these things you see what i'm saying the all of these insects and he calls them insects are one and the same only that it's in different stages different stages of growth through the ages i'm not being poetic i'm just reading what he says the stages through the ages right oh my see they are the same antichrist spirit but now manifested in organization denomination manifested in false doctrine through the ages and that poor little root and stock god said no matter what they do that will be restored hallelujah amen god is going to plant a new church amen but it's going to bring the original planting back to its original seed amen back to its original seed and i was discussing with a preacher there and just saying to him and he was saying to me too that he's seen that that uh they're thinking uh you get justified sanctified you receive the baptism holy ghost hallelujah we're going in the bride no we're going in the rapture no no no we go read the restoration of the bright tree he said no justification only makes way for sanctification sanctification only makes way for the baptism the holy spirit but the baptism of the holy ghost has to make way for the holy ghost himself amen what's he talking about what is the prophet talking about that the church must go back to its original planting what seed was planted jesus said i am the corner freak when i go into the ground i'm the one that will come back up as a bride as a fight as a ministry of of people under the power of the holy spirit oh praise god hallelujah oh my so it will go back to the original grain or the it goes back to the statue of perfect man it goes back to the image of jesus christ it goes back to the original seed like it was hallelujah for the spoken word restores the whole thing back to the original seed as it was and the original seed is who christ amen oh my because he is the corner wheat that was planted in the ground oh praise god forevermore now notice he says that happens by the teaching of the former reign hallelujah that restoration happens by the teaching of that former rain and that it was what it has done for us he says but the next rain will come upon them that is the harvest rain that is the rapturing faith hallelujah reign for the rapture hallelujah you are in the midst of it now praise god hallelujah because he says you the scripture said it they will receive the former rain the teaching raid and the harvest rain at the same time in the same month hallelujah and we are still enjoying the teaching of the prophet that has brought us and restored us back to the word and the word itself hallelujah is having us ready to go in a rapture amen praise be to god hallelujah amen oh praise god now we see here lord of god look i have 15 minutes more i'm going to use every minute is that okay praise god now notice in so much as it were possible they shall deceive the very elect hallelujah now who is it shall attempt to deceive the very elect in that day jesus was speaking that that spirit will receive the very elect when what time is he talking about who what spirit what's he talking about prophet says here it's nothing but the spirit of the antichrist that has been coming down through the ages just as the spirit of christ was coming down through the ages amen and that spirit of the antichrist coming down but in the false anointed ones of this last day now these false ones have already come and they're lee claiming they come in jesus name you're a christian i'm a christian too we're all preaching about jesus we're all preaching repentance we're all talking about born again we're all talking about being baptized and all that we are good people aren't we well we live clean you know uh like that we're gonna be in the bride never mind they might even be bridesmaid but the fact is that uh they are not seeing the word listen they've already come in jesus name claiming that they are being anointed of god for the last day just as much you claim to be anointed moses you're anointed we are also anointed you know paul you say you're not we are going to do anything you say we we are going to do it we are going to count defeated we are going to copy it we are going to have it too but now they are nothing but the false messiahs amen claiming that they are prophets that they are one with the word hallelujah you know uh oh my there's a lot in there but i can't touch them they're claiming that they have a uniting with the with the bridegroom that they united with the bright groom uniting time with the word but the prophet is saying here then if they are that they never had that and now they're adding to the word and they're taking from the from it no one denies that the spirit of god is upon them manifesting gifts upon them but they act just like balaam it's nothing but their they have their programs and their appeals for money how many knows that and it's growing more and more you think it's going to grow less because they don't have nothing every all the truth and the light from the eclipse spiritual that's taking place is going to seep out of them it's slowly going away from them right when he that let it will let he that hinders will stop hindering gets out of the way amen then shall the son that lawless one be revealed man of sin and uh when he said the holy spirit when he gets out of the way what do you think it means when the rapture takes place and he's gone with you in you and in me praise god then it'll give that those devils their opportunity now to ravage the people amen and destroy the population that is there upon them hallelujah they exercise gifts but deny the word they bypass the world for fear that they might cause a controversy that will diminish their chances for greater money and greater gain because their ministry going to get smaller because people are going to stop supporting and everything else and pull back from it oh my think of it yet they preach the salvation they are also preaching deliverance through the power of god but they don't realize he said just they're doing it just like judas was doing it having a ministry that was truly imparted by christ have i not chosen you but want to use the devil so judas could claim god sent me i was chosen by jesus himself true but one is the devil think about it oh my yes sir oh my think here they are yet they preached salvation and the power of god and this judas ministry which was imparted by christ but you see because they are the wrong seed to begin with it don't matter what they do is that simple it doesn't matter what they do they have the wrong seed in them they're not in the elected bunch so it doesn't matter how glorious works and mighty things they do big tents and big followings and 20 000 people in the church and oh my god they make a star but you got the wrong seed you're not going in any rapture you're not in the bride you're not in that group that god ordained or elected from before the foundation of the world see and because they have wrong seed they have to manifest the wrong spirit motivated by a wrong spirit motivating them and religious oh my they are religious think of it they even will outshine the elect in their efforts oh oh lord have mercy and zeal but all of it is leodisian spirit and not of christ for it always looks for big crowds big programs and wanting to see startling signs amongst them hallelujah oh my friends when i read that right away you know what i thought about i remember thought about baal's prophets they they were shouting from the first church age and asking for vindication of what they're doing to prove to this false prophet elijah coming at the last they're going to prove to him that they are the real man and the bible said as the hours go down and the evenings start to go down towards three o'clock they start to get more desperate and as they got desperate the bible said they start jumping and dancing in the air and making all kinds of shrieks and noises and the bible said they got so far to start to cut themselves to show sincere they are and everything else and when they're doing that at the time of the evening sacrifice which you know that means three o'clock in the afternoon when the lamb was being offered in the temple then the bible says eli just stepped forth amen and the rest you know the history of it amen praise god hallelujah now see they preach the second of coming of christ but deny the advent of the prophet messenger hear how simple that sounds that even you might not catch it but look how simple it is the advent of the prophet messenger but what he's talking about is the seventh seal that was going to come and that was the coming of christ and revelation 1 the mighty angel was going to go in to revelation 10 7 which is the prophet of malachi 4 5. it'll be the same william branham that was operating on the first and second poll but when it come down to the third poll on creation who do you think that was well he preached the message who do you think this is why do you think he started suddenly preaching greater than solomon is here why do you think that he preached i have a greater witness than john oh my just go back search the message and you'll see these things in it don't stop reading the message don't get the uh called on the message study read the message and you'll see the revelation breaking forth like a bright and shining morning oh praise god hallelujah amen yes sir oh my think of it they deny the advent of the prophet messenger in other words they're denying the return of jesus christ when he come the first time brother branham said how did he manifest himself as a prophet he said how does he come when he comes again as a prophet right so what i'm saying to you yes i'm your brother i'm a brother i'm your brother i'm your brother yes we know you're you're moses you're you're you're mary son your mary son but they didn't realize who that really was so now he has come back because brother branham was not virgin born flesh jesus was virgin born flesh so right away he just came and start doing what he has to do but brother branham went through a first second poll and then the third put mighty angel comes down and he works and manifests himself true brother william branham the predestinated vessel for his manifestation in this hour that was the man that was predestinated in this hour just as mary was ma uh predestinating in that power to bring forth the birth of the world uh in flesh he was predestinated bring forth the word amen the word for this hour praise god and that word has grown and matured lord god hallelujah and so the spirit of christ second coming by the great manifestations on the mountain and uh a quote which i use yes uh briefly uh while away how that he says that cloud in the skies just like the wise men back there when they saw the stars up in the sky their new messiah had to be on the earth now a man he said that crowd is up in the heavens what do you think it was a sign praise god everybody ought to know that he is on earth now praise god hallelujah preparing his own bride for his own coming amen physical the one who you feel in your heart amen one day you'll see him praise god you'll see him for yourself glory to god hallelujah no man shall see god and live but yeah a part of god can see god and live amen glory to god hallelujah amen hallelujah amen i got five minutes and i'm going to wring it dry hallelujah you ever took a piece of cloth and ring it until everything comes out a bit that's what i'm doing here but we'll be finished very soon praise the lord hallelujah i don't want to run over any of this stuff now we got all kind of nuggets and gems and treasures and everything in the storehouse hallelujah and the thing is breaking more and more and more and more prophet said it too he said these seals he said they're like a like a roman candle they burst and they go this side they're bursting next one goes higher burst and gone higher worse than that's the way it is praise god every time when you think okay now the fireworks are over no it starts up again glory to god hallelujah now this false spirit in this last day is now so close to the reel the only way it's so deceiving that the only way that you can distinguish it is by their div its deviation from the word of god hallelujah that is you understand now why he said give them the word test give them the word test because you'll know them not by signs and wonders even if the guy was able to say oh with my back turn the time is on so with my back turn this woman that doesn't mean nothing to the true bride no more it was wonderful and it's good but you turn around and give that spirit the word test and see where that spirit is because that spirit has even come in the message it's hiding in the falls or the branches of the mustard tree jesus spoke about hallelujah oh praise god amen it falls back on one argument which we have already shown to be false well we get results don't we we get results so we have to be of god oh my but i want you to see that seed of wheat was being buried but thank god see the wheat christ the corn of wheat it sent up the shoots it came back through the tassel the true air and no wonder it's back the lutherans some will say the lutherans didn't have the holy spirit but that was the wheat seed coming back they had the holy spirit but in portion the next one have it in portion a little more next united in portion a little more right on up to pentecost now it's come back in its fullness upon the bride of jesus christ hallelujah amen praise god amen we are not talking when we speak about these uh denominations methodists this that we are not saying uh individuals or the people that they are evil but we're talking about the edge hallelujah oh my see they they have the holy spirit for their day but this is the age of full restoration amen hallelujah the outpouring like they had in the beginning oh praise god hallelujah amen and so while this is the age of of restoration and they're coming down to close now it is also the age of blackout the age of apostasy hallelujah the age this is the age of the finished cycle amen when it's all over what's he talking about he's talking about the cycle of the seed the seed goes through spring summer and come back in the fall and and then goes back to spring some but when the seed goes back to seed again hallelujah and and that repeats year after year which is a type of jesus the word that was buried and raised up and said because i live you going to live and you're going to live also because this seed gotta be reflected again in the last day the son of man has to be revealed and his being revealed praise peter god hallelujah oh my don't you see we conclude the seven church ages i repeat the seven churches are over he said we conclude the seven churches he's talking about what he's teaching but he's also speaking about the real church ages being concluded amen saying and i say to you what the spirit has said to every age he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches hallelujah amen i believe the spirit of god has been speaking to us and teaching us the truth of the ages he has been faithfully dealing with hearts let me turn to him that is the reason for all preaching and teaching for it is in the preaching and teaching of the word that is how the sheep will hear the voice of god and will follow is that right because the preaching of the word is like waving the way of sheep hallelujah or it's like waving a toy in front of a baby that's just born and can't barely see but the movements of those things catches their attention so he says the preaching and the teaching of the word hallelujah that is what caused the sheep to hear the voice of god and follow amen now he's concluding he said i want you to know i do not bring a message to the people for them to follow me how many agrees with that you see how it's coming clear now not to follow him or nobody else but to follow the word i uh there's another place where he said oh when let it come to that time when when even william branham is no more even thought about by the people don't even think about me he says but let jesus christ be glorified in other words see jesus only it's not disrespect to the prophet he's done his job and we recognize that but let's keep our eyes on jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh my i did not bring a message for people to go join or come and join my church or group or to start some fellowship or some organization i will never do that i have no interest in such things but i do have an interest in the things of god and the people of god and if i can accomplish just one thing i will be satisfied and that one thing is to see establish a true spiritual relationship between god and men whereby men become new creations in jesus christ can you say it i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man or woman hallelujah a man amen filled with the spirit and let them now live according to his word i would invite i would plead i will warn you hear his voice at this time and while he is saying hear his voice the people didn't know that they were listening to his voice speaking through a prophet for the spirit speaks through the prophet i would invite plead warn that you hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him and trust him amen as i trust him in my heart and i have given my all to him may god bless all of you and may his coming rejoice our hearts praise god that's how he concludes the seven church ages may his coming rejoice our hearts nothing else rejoices me more than to think that the rapture is at hand and soon we will be with the presence of the lord jesus christ there was work still to be done is that right but let's work till jesus comes let's work till he comes and comes for us and takes us out of here praise the lord god bless you all amen brother would you come with a closing hymn and a prayer and then we can just go out of here praise the lord hallelujah amen oh it wasn't brother ivanka that passed praise the lord it was his wife that passed oh my god bless her heart because i actually she cooked and everything else and spent time there had fellowship with him and her may god bless uh our brother ivan and may god rest her soul for she really was a gallant soldier of this message and one who lived it believed it and held to god's unchanging hand to the very end hallelujah thank you brother for making that clear because now we know that this is going everywhere may the lord bless the brother comfort him in this hour and surround him with the warmth of his divine presence and soon we trust god somehow we'll be able to meet again god bless all of you and i say it i'm happy to be back or i will give you a missionary report on this sunday by god's grace god bless you i'm a all man [Music] is [Music] the opportunity to come and listen to what you had to say to us continue to strengthen us lord as we go may your guidance be with us protect us and bring us back home safely here
