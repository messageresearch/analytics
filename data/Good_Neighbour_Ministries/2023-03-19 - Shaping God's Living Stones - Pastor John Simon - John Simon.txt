unto God to God be the glory amen God bless you please be seated just for a moment we thank God we we heard from Sister Merlin from New Zealand she is pressing on praise the name of the Lord 90 is it amen 90 and pressing on to the glory of God how much more should it be for us that we would keep pressing on the battle until the Lord calls us home but that great saint of God is there believe in the word with all our heart thank God for all the years that she's been coming and coming until now it's become hard for her to to travel but God is still God and he is able amen we're glad to see every one of you here today in the house of the Lord and to come in the spirit of Christ to engage ourselves together because Fellowship is a very difficult thing in this day a lot of selfishness and a lot of um you know we we all take care of our own Affairs and you just don't think about it but we're no more in real Fellowship right but the Holy Spirit wants to be in fellowshipped right praise God not only when I'm preaching the word and you come here to come in an assembly which we call coming to church but that we would be in Fellowship one with the other as Brothers and Sisters in Christ as the law of the word and as time allows and as we make time and deliberately have to do it because Satan tries to obstruct that as much as he can and discourage it as much as he can but God wants us to be in Fellowship because Fellowship breeds a lot of things in us and in our hearts very important element for the Christian life it's so good to be in God's house today and to be with you and to share God's holy word well today by his grace we'd like to start a topic here um I don't believe it will end today but we'll follow follow it up and we'll see what God will tell us at this time because the ministry uh while brother Branham was here praise the Lord was really to do what gather the bride together from out of all the lands all the nations all the people tribes and towns that were everywhere around the world to preach the gospel and to attract the bride's attention that her attention might look towards him the word to look away from the world and the things of the world and to begin to see Jesus Amen in his fullness we had a demon denominational perspective of Jesus Christ but then the prophet came with a magnification that widened our view we were able to recognize him that he's not dead but look he's operating through an endless Man He's Alive forevermore he's just the same as he was back then he's here today again and he's proving that he is alive and he's moving amongst his people in a wonderful way and that attraction upon to attract us to the top of the pyramid to attack practice to the Mountaintop of God's word caught the attention of the genuine bride that caught everybody's attention for that matter right and when it caught everybody's attention under the first and the second pull amen caught everybody's attention then when everyone's attention was caught then he began to preach the word and when he began to preach the word it wasn't instantly recognized but slowly it started to create a difference it started to create a separation God was taking the grain from amongst the tears or the tears from Amongst the Wheat by the preaching of the word at one level that word brought us out amen the prophet's message brought us out to denomination now we see the fivefold ministry with his ministry began to the angels began to separate the shaft from the wheat and some could only separate it to a certain level amen praise God but then the holy spirit in these last days has been honing in and focusing his attention in getting that bride ready that she might go into the presence of the Lord and the word the ministry for this hour is bringing her to a place where she must and will be without spot or without ring go because he the Holy Spirit the Living God is washing her by the water of his living word amen that she might be ready to go with him I'm preaching already let's go to the scripture let's read the scriptures and let's go to the word of God here praise the name of the Lord shall we all stand Matthew 16 17-18 and Jesus this is when he says who do men say that I am praise the Lord after he's doing all these Miracles who do men see I am and uh Simon Peter answered him and Jesus said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjuna for flesh and blood has not revealed this education didn't philosophies no nothing did it but Flesh and Blood nothing in Flesh and Blood give this to you Simon Peter but by my My Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail Hallelujah therefore first Peter 2 verses 1 2 5. wherefore laying aside all malice and guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be you have tested that the Lord is gracious amen hallelujah to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious Jesus of course was that living Stone amen chosen of God and precious you have also as Lively Stones living stones are built up to a spiritual house that is your purpose amen and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ nobody else has to it hasn't to be acceptable to anybody else no church no priests no Pope has to accept you but must be acceptable in the eyes of God in the hour God bless you father we have just read the written word well we know the written word is placed there as a representation for reference a starting point from which we can go into the Beyond and to rise into the other dimension under the lift of the Holy Spirit take Glory take honor take praise father father we bind every devil of unbelief we we rebuke every spirit that will hold the people from not wanting to praise you and glorify you in the spontaneity of the word of God and the life of the Holy Spirit take Glory father May a spirit of Freedom Liberty come upon your people take away culture take away education take away these conformities of man that you may be glorified by the word father in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it and believe it amen and amen praise God God bless you you may be seated praise God hallelujah you are conscious and you are aware that we are not here to feed on our precious brother William Branham we are not here to feed on him and we are not eating on brother William Branham amen but we are here to feed on the unfailing body word of our Lord Jesus Christ we are here that same word that formed itself in the shape of a man that was called Melchizedek while it was in a theophonic state as a theophany he came to melchized Abraham in the form of a man the word began to take the shape of the form of a man and we see in these last days The Same Spirit of almighty God is again taken shape by the unveiling of the word in the eyes of his beloved and they are beginning to recognize that we are receiving the same Melchizedek that was back there with Abraham that same the Cassidy is appearing once again by the opening of the word to the spiritual eyes of the believer that will trust him with every step they take hallelujah amen so I Take God that that word body is here again today and the son of man in this hour is again revealing himself praise the Lord and we give him glory amen hallelujah isn't it wonderful Abraham recognized who it was then and Abraham's Royal seed now are beginning to recognize who it is now in this hour and in this day that we are not just listening to words on the pages of the Bible blessed as they are but the words only represent the Unseen one Hallelujah that we are worshiping praising when we raise our hands and say glory to God praise God it's not just to the air there is a being there is a power there's one who is Alive forevermore the word of God has opened our understanding that they recognize that he's a living person he's a living being and we are meant to be his mouthpiece his word his hands his feet and to give Glory unto His Marvelous name is this your reality to you is this a reality to you or is there some fantasy or some imagination oh my something's struck my soul amen praise God at 14 years old and called me into the grace of God that he sent a prophet and a message took me to another dimension amen glory god and the Winds of God has been lifting higher and higher since then to this hour amen so we give him glory this morning praise the name of the Lord hallelujah say glory to God praise the Lord praise the Lord only people oh shout unto the Lord with the voice of Triumph amen for great is the name of our God hallelujah amen hallelujah Abraham's Royal seed is recognizing the God not in the physical form amen not like when he comes and takes the bride out of here but the recognizing him in his theophany form of the word that's now revealing itself amen and that's why if you can't recognize him now you won't be able to recognize him then amen you've got to see him in the word form praise the Lord and now that is what we are feeding on you come to church you come together because we want to feed on this unseen Force we want to feed on this living presence this being that engulfs our entire body our entire mind our entire existence engulfed by this living person who the Bible says in Revelation 1 when we begin to talk of him he steps right out of the bushes when we begin to talk of him the Bible says he's walking up and down among the candlesticks do you believe he's right here with us oh my do you believe he's walking up in them desires don't you believe he can touch you wherever you are you believe I have to come off with the puppet to lay hands on you no he is right here the great physician now is near the sympathizing Christ amen he is able to do the same he did yesterday he's able to do it today off only you will believe he'll break and Empower that tries to hold you he'll break every chain that tries to hold you he'll set you free from anything that tries to obstruct your path because he said he'll have a bride and the devil will do everything to Prevail against that but the Bible says he shall not Prevail because the word the lion of the tribe of Judah has already prevailed over him glory be to God hallelujah amen yes sir so we take God that while we are in a state now that we are literally expecting a body change just as Abraham and Sarah had a body change after meeting that theophany that change started amen from the day you come into a clear revelation of this word your change started amen I don't mean that your physical body May necessarily change but your soul on the inside began to change Paul talks about the renewing of the man on the inside you you become a new creation you're Changed by the power and the presence of almighty God you are no more your own you know you're bought with a price you're brought to him and you recognize him for who he is amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen I don't know about you but I already feel that Resurrection let me say rapturing power working within my being Hallelujah I feel the electrifying power and presence of almighty God hallelujah working through this word to bring glory to his mighty name amen hallelujah amen glory to God Amen you see the the thought let me give you this seat thought first so that you'll know what I'm talking about for the rest of the way is that um Peter he says and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail praise the Lord and what He is wanting us to know is that as you know Peter's name actually means Stone it means Little Rock but remember I just read from the first Peter how this is made us clear I am the original chosen rock it says that and you are just little rocks amen little rocks in other words you're a chip off of the old rock you you're just a piece of him piece of that Pillar of Fire got uh inside of you by the opening of the word remember we come from him if we are true Sons and Daughters of God Amen then we had no beginning we had no end there's no time when you were not and there will be no time where you will not be for you being a part of God is Not Just to be another human you are human because you have to be on the earth and people have to see you you have to have location visibility knowledge self knowledge stuff like that now it's not just to be here but for you to recognize who you really are amen that you are the original ETS I I know that sounds funny I'm not trying to be funny but it is I'm just getting you to understand what it is they're looking for alien beings coming down from flying saucers amen and and they don't understand that Paul said we are not from here we are Eternal beings Tractive brother Brown said but you're only trapped for a season in a body of time your body only have 70 years or whatever on the Earth but the being that's in there is a Timeless being amen you come from God and you're going back to God that's why when The Sinner dies he don't know where he's going but we know who we come from we know where we come from we know why we are here we know what purpose we are for we are here to serve his purpose we come from him and we go back to him by faith in this word of God absent from the body you're present with the Lord amen because that's where you come from Hallelujah so we come here in his wonderful presence to fulfill his purpose for his glory so when I say that you are Lively stones he's really talking about the unshakable gene that is in you you are little stones you are little rocks off of the great Rock of Ages and as that that part that is in you there is unshakable Unsinkable indestructible it can't be changed it was set here by God and that is what he said to Peter because Peter was the first one that kind of had some recognition and he says Thou Art Peter you got the rock in you you got the stone in you you got the seed you got the gene you got the sword you got the attribute it's in you you recognize that you're different amen you recognize that you are different from the day you're born you're recognized why am I like this something was in your speaking to your soul and you're recognized you are not just ordinary you are Sons and Daughters of the Living God Amen say I am a child of God see I'm a Child of God I'm a Child of God oh how wonderful the songwriter says we are the trials of children of God I wash my robes in the Crimson Fountain I am a child of God hallelujah we wash the robes in the word of God and here we are as Sons and Daughters of God expressed visibly and physically upon the face of the Earth for a season of time until we are called back into his presence praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen so thank God that God did uh represent or manifest himself to Abraham while he was not yet in solid flesh you understand and we are in court in the same time frame as uh as the elect lady or Abraham's Royal seed before he goes from being in this word form to go back to the fullness of his flesh form to come and pick her up and take her away we are allowed to recognize him by the word of God being preached to you amen hallelujah that's why you pray for me and I pray for you because what's manifesting here today is not John Simon alone standing over the spoken oh there's a power from the presence of almighty God there's a presence that no man can have of himself is the god of Heaven by the revealing of this word making themselves known amen is there where you see any signs and wonders and miracles we don't have to have that to have him here we have him here because he has the word and he is making himself known he has let you become conscious of his presence conscious that he is alive not dead but living among praise the name of the Lord God hallelujah thanks be to God yes sir so now he uh Abraham saw him back then now he's allowing the elect lady the bride to see him now in the form of his theophany which is a word body that has not yet gone back to being a flesh body amen praise the name of the Lord glory to God hallelujah now we are aware that uh let me give you a quotation first of all because some of you may not think I'm preaching the message if I don't quote from Brother Branham but they don't understand that the same inspiration that hit brother Branham he released it and it went out and he prophesied and said it will come on some of those young men I was a young man at the time when he was saying that it'll come on some of those young men and they'll take this word and they will break it down not because they know anything but at that time by inspiration of the Holy Spirit they will break it down so that you will understand hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and I believe that's what's happening listen but today it's members it's getting decisions it's bringing members into the church many members amen that's not it oh my yes sir I tell you I want to talk from my heart it's the truth all they look for is decisions join this church join that church join that other Church join this church and come join us over here join this over there all of them every one of them they are just thinking member members members members members I'm repeating what he's saying here decisions decisions decisions amen see that's what they're thinking hallelujah what I'm saying here is that when he came again now in word form not in this form that of just reading the Bible that they were looking for because they're expecting it as the written word form but now he's come back in this form of the uh theophany which is the same word but in a spirit form a spiritual form before it and morphs to the fullness of its state praise the Lord hallelujah and when he came in that form some even called him a devil oh my some doubted him some reject him my fact that Pentecostals rejected him they didn't want him they prefer his gifts but that didn't want him the word uh you know you have a lot of women like that in the world today type of the church they want all the offerings all the tidings all this they want all the gifts you know but they don't want him the word they just want him to have money bring money get money give them money or receive monies or whatever but they don't want the fullness of the word amen but he's calling us back to his original intention that you will love him and then everything else is made available to you praise the Lord hallelujah amen I'm not one for this modern calculation of uh women saying they're in love but they're only in love after they calculated that man he's going to do well he's going to have this job he's going to make lots of money he's going to become rich and therefore I'm going to be well off and then they fall in love right but not the real genuine love when a woman looks at a man I don't care what condition he's in I don't care how poor he is I don't care what he have with God's help amen but God's help we can I can't help him he can help me we can do it to the glory of God Amen real genuine God sent love amen but not this the last day uh love so-called calculating and scheming and everything else praise God if you want to see that go on the television you'll see a lot of that right all right like that amen oh my praise God but brother sister we are not here looking for members we are here looking for the character of Jesus Christ Hallelujah we are here looking for the little Stone inside of that person some a typos inside the person that's what we're looking for something that will hold them no matter how hard I preach the word or any other man preaches the word they'll hold to God's unchanging hand they'll hold to the promise of God for the hour they'll hold to his word because they got nothing else to hold to blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah amen glory to God we're searching now and what we're searching for is to find them last members of the Bride wherever they are we're looking for them listen in any case what good is Stones you gather them if you've got a Stones you haven't even got a stone Nation to shut them out amen got them Stones having coming with confessions right see but you see when Peter made his confession Jesus said Thou Art Peter meaning brother Braham speaking a little Stone see but what good even is that stone if there isn't a stone mess and there to shape it into a son or daughter of God then all you got in there is but a pile of a bunch of rocks what is saying is if that person even if they're genuine seed and recognizing it's the seed of God it still needs a stone Mason which is one of the fivefold ministry or a minister a real genuine man of God to take a sharp tool and to begin to ship that uh personality that character that's in there undeveloped like a newborn and to developed by the preaching of the word and as it feeds on that word it grows in the word its character and its personality begins to emerge by the word that they have been receiving Hallelujah that's why he said well if you've been feeding on the soup made from the shadow of a skinny chicken you're going to be anemic you want to come to accomplish nothing whatsoever but you've got to come to receive the real preaching from the body word of Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah so their desire to display gifts uh they didn't want to receive this word because the gifts is like you know something we can hold on to but the word what is this word what is this Revelation you can't hold it you can't there's nothing for you to hold on to you just got to believe it and receive it within your heart but they want to come and every night or every day they come to church oh there's a miracle there's a healing oh somebody shocked somebody shouted somebody over there we're gonna shout too we're gonna praise God too we're going to give God glory but it's what you're shouting about well said when your worship when you sing when you pray or you preach he said preach pray with the understanding amen don't be like some something brass and a tickling symbol you don't even know what you're shouting about amen but when the word of God strikes your heart and you recognize the fullness of the word and you say hallelujah that's not something on the tip of your lips but something coming from the depth of your soul because you recognize what is really going on Peter thou art a little Stone but what good is even that stone if there isn't a stone Mason there to ship it into a son a daughter of God it's just a piling of a bunch of rocks piled together amen oh praise God in that wonderful to know that brother sisters that is why uh God love me to see the importance of every true genuine God called god Set Apart minister of this message I don't say every minister of this message but I'm telling you God is going to let people begin to see that there are ministers and there are ministers and you'll recognize a great difference not because the man says so not the man tries to make himself something but the spirit of Christ will separate them you'll recognize there's a difference there that is you can't explain it but there is a difference there that God does it by his word praise the name of the Living God hallelujah amen what good is them Stones if you haven't got a true Stone Mason with a good sharp tool to shape him into and fit him into the place into the house of God that don't mean just a local church but he's talking about when Solomon built his original Temple the stones the Bible says some were given gifts the shape Stones Some to jewelry some for curtains tailoring just that and and they were used to shape the stones and in the shaping of the storms for Solomon's Temple not the sound of a hammer was not heard the sound of the fool or Nothing Was Heard and yet the ship that Temple by the power of God hallelujah let me tell you I went to Israel and some of those stones are as long as three quarter of this inside of this church there were just that long and there were about five feet thick one piece they're still wondering how they move them how they got them there and they know that the stones is not from the original limestones that were right there in Israel where did they bring them from oh my God that's the same thing why the prophet used to love to sing they come from the east and west they come from the lands afar to feasts with the King to dine as his guests how blessed this pilgrims are beholding his high Lord face in the word and glow with light divine blessed partake course of his words gems in this Crown do shine yes Jesus is coming soon oh praise God we come from the East and West just the miracle of us meeting here today just think of it we pass over it we don't realize it do you realize that if the Lord has not made known as word to us you would never have known me amen I would never have known you you would never meet this person you would never meet the other person on so many levels on because of certain levels in society we all could live a full life but yet we're passing each other because we're living on different planes of society and then when you think of mental abilities that's another level we might never have met when you think of the racial level black white yellow brown whatever we might never have met it's only the grace of God and the revealing of this word brother hallelujah we're looking at a living Miracle right here today praise the name of the Lord to him be all the glory and the praise and all the honor amen praise the name of the Lord amen these Pentecostals instead of them recognizing Melchizedek the word they prefer to be caught up with The Spoils of the five Kings counting the five Kings and all the money all the jewelry they brought back from capturing the five Kings all of it was to go to Abraham and Abraham turned around and said no I don't want to just take enough to give my servants and stuff he gave it to the kings of Sodom you you all can take it and attempt to that he turned around and say this goes to Melchizedek amen praise God hallelujah and we see the children of Abraham are seeing the same thing in this day and in this hour amen glory to God hallelujah praise God I'm I'm preaching but I'm also watching the time praise the Lord glory to God I'm also sensing your spirit when you get tired of me I'll know it too amen amen praise the Lord amen praise God forevermore listen so you've got to have that sharp tool amen you got to minister you might be even preaching the message but he doesn't have a sharp tool the tool is dull uh you know it's not sharp when you say sharp it doesn't mean sharp mind it don't mean anything like that doesn't mean intelligence or or the human wisdom of man but but they they let me say this slow down let me think of what this is they the Discerning power the penetration of the word by the Holy Spirit to be able to separate truth from error not just me telling you it but when you hear it you recognize you will even know that's not that's just that man you'll know it believe you me nobody can really explain that but somehow you are going to know it amen you you'll even know when I come out of the spirit and I come into myself and I go back and the Spirit come back to my you'll recognize it because it's right before you if you are spiritual if you are one of those stones or those genes come from God you are recognized what's happening glory be to God hallelujah this is the mystery of preaching Paul talked about praise the name of the Lord glory to God how important it is to know that see so I come this morning and to some of you what I am preaching is nothing but using a hammer and the Bible said that Mason must come with some of you know about masonry how many in here knows what I mean oh you got some idea they have special hammers for the Mason so that when they want to break a brick it doesn't bust up the brick it just breaks that precise peace they want to break off that hammer is made when strikes there is going to break off that bad peace that that person shouldn't have in their life anymore it just breaks it off when the hammer strikes it like that and then he he what's the other little Spade that he has that spreads the mortar what they call that a trowel oh you know it okay so when I use it no problem so he has a trowel that he spreads the water because the Brick by itself is not going to build anything it's got to have Fellowship it's got to be cemented in love together as one amen so that they cannot together they can accomplish something for the glory of God Hallelujah that's what it's for and then uh you know the man has to have a chisel a sharp tool you gotta have a chisel that he has to use sometimes they have to put the names or something in the Rock and so they'll use a chisel to do that praise the name of the Lord and the pastor the preacher maybe has to take the word and sometimes it's gonna cut you Hallelujah my don't be ashamed if you got to shout out ouch or me ah whatever shout praise God hallelujah amen but he has to use a sharp tool sometimes God would let him even use a sharper tool and that would be the word itself and do some spiritual surgery because you might be having some atrophy of the heart a hard-heartedness and coldness and he has got to do a surgical work where uh you wake up and you don't realize you were operated on the preacher preaches the word and the word takes out the excess carnality or flesh takes out the selfishness The Pride takes out all those things out of you resentment and spirits of revention Vengeance instead of letting those things go and put your life in the hands of God and let him shape you and make you into what you're supposed to be a stone a living Stone being shaped by the word a preached word of God ready to be placed into the New Jerusalem that you might find your place in the kingdom of God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord oh my you see the rest of them they only want decisions amen but as a stone Mason he is there to shed that and make them quickness quit that quit the other and make them over again by the preaching of the word hallelujah praise God by the way you'll find a lot of this I am making commentary on it but you'll find it in the end time evangelism you'll find that if you have time this week read the wonderful book The End Time evangelism right praise the name of the Lord yes oh my and make them over Square them up and and like that and make them like real Christians amen that sets in the house of the Living God don't you want to be that way or you stop you believe that you already been shaped oh we'll never stop being shaped by the hand of God until we leave this place and go in the presence of God Amen none too high and none too low for God to shape Us Praise the name of the Lord You're Building on house and you got bricks that are I have to be there as foundations and you have bricks that are there in the middle wall and you have bricks that want to be on the top to receive the roof when it comes down you you bricks are at every level amen God is just saying be content with wherever God bless you amen makes me a minister makes another one a deacon makes one a trustee makes you a member in the church a supporter in the church oh my praise God many years ago I preached a message yes you remember but what is your contribution what is your contribution what are you contributing to the kingdom of God yes not just talking about tithes and offerings that's good but that's one of them but but how are you contributing your time contributing whatever Talent so you want to hide it up and you won't let the brothers know well I'm into music I do this I do that so that you you it can be used utilized for the glory of God Amen praise God whatever we have we let's put it in the house of God put it among the turn of God hallelujah if all you know is the player five stringed instrument uh a ten string instrument all you do is is that right somebody asked me if I know to play the guitar I said no ask me if I know to play the sitar I said no I said the only instrument I can place the motor right that's what God's given right give him the glory and all the praise amen yes sir this he says yes what the end time evangelism is all about it's taking them stones and beginning to shape them for the glory of God hallelujah and that's what I have been trying to do is taking the little genes the seeds of the germs of God that's in the hearts of the True Believers and shaping them to fit into the Rapture that's right at hand that we will all find our place in the presence of God Amen that we might make sure we are in the New Jerusalem that we are in that house that God told Solomon that my house you really can't build it I'll build myself a house amen and then we hear the voice from Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is now with man for now I there will be my people I will be their God the habitation of God is now with man in man God's house is in you and me Paul said no you're not you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost God Lives in You by a truth amen praise the name of the Living God Amen repeat he says let me repeat what good what's that Stone the if you are just a pile with the rest of them and lay there with the rest of them pile them up together memberships memberships amen but a stone is no good without a stone Mason there's a lot of people let him say they don't need a pastor a lot of people that think that they can be their own pastor but you do not understand you maybe have the the same wisdom knowledge and intellectual ability um mentally you may have the same thing you maybe you'll have some better ideas than the pastor but you see a pastor is a predestinated tool that God set in the church that whenever he wants to speak whenever he wants to reveal whenever he wants to make known himself that he knows this is one vessel I can come to and he will use that vessel for that purpose they may not be good for anything else the man may not be good at books he may not be good at Medical he may not be good at that he may not yeah he may look as if he's upside manufacturer of somewhere here brother I've got a quote her brother Brian said they'll even think of him as a fanatic as a crank some all crank out of somewhere he says but that's the way God works is that right and God is able to now make himself manifest amen because God ordained that person to be his servant and to reveal himself through him praise the Lord for that glory amen yes sir oh my you see he has to have that stone Mason because Jesus doesn't count and I'm saying this he doesn't just count how many rocks or stones but Jesus looks and he counts the character that's there he counts the character not the members but those ones with the character praise the name of the Lord oh my see he repeats he comes character you see God always wants to get one man or woman in his hand and that's all he needs he'll do his work through many years through that see he could only find one righteous man in the time of know that he could work through in the time of Moses he only found one righteous man praise God hallelujah but friends here we are at the end time praise the Lord glory to God now I can even end now but I'll say some more praise God is that okay now a lot of people say brother Simon I already have that character I'm a man of dignity and and I'm a man of good habits and so on I'm a good man or good woman and that that's not what he's talking about person can be come to the Perfection of goodness and charitableness and be a good man a good woman but they don't have the seed they don't have the germ they don't have that chip of the Rock The Little Rock in them the stabilizing force in them they just don't have that amen another place Harry said if they don't have that they can be religious and everything else they want all they will ever be is another wonderful church member amen without that predestinated elected portion in them they'll end up being nothing but a beautiful wonderful church member but we want to have the life of God in us we want to know that we know that we know hallelujah praise God my goodness yes sir oh praise God hallelujah yes shaping you for the Rapture not members but men and women that God can work through the years how satisfying is that to a servant of God that even if God calls me away are you away that you know that Brethren are left here praise God that God can work through and God can continue his work and God can manifest himself and declare his generation for the glory of God hallelujah so oh my I I got the cartoon me even as Christians now and I'm going to preach a little on this and then leave to rest for next week praise the Lord and that's what's Nexus to come praise God I want you salivating so when you come back next week you received a word hallelujah but you see Peter sure thought he had that character because these men try to live the best they could right but listen what he says here now remember when they came for Jesus in Gethsemane Peter already believed see but Peter had a sword oh my and when they were trying to take Jesus the prophet said he pulled out that sword and was going to cut off the high priest's ears and things like that amen and he even did it amen and you know Jesus put it back but when it comes to real Christian Courage he had courage to do that but he did not have the real Christian Courage see he didn't have that because he surely didn't have it because right then he cut off the high priest's ears but backed up and backed away and denied the word right then you see the difference between those two types of Courage is that right you see he backed away from the word and it takes courage to embrace the word it takes courage to hold on to God's unchanging hand amen yes sir Oh my he cut off the high priest's ear with his sword because in this world he knew how to handle it my God I don't doubt we have a lot of good sword fences in here and sword fencing don't mean you have to know how to use a you know a sword like that but with words they can fence with the pastor and argue one you know and slip and slide and everything else they might even chop the pastor's ears off and whatever yeah yeah they may have that ability right there let me see my goodness because the prophet says here you cut off the high priest heirs with that sword yes because Peter knew how to that handle that sword well oh my yes sir but when it comes to the squeeze for them to stand up to the word then we'll see if they have that courage amen courage to stand up for the word then we're gonna see if they have that courage amen now that's where it is today he says they have a courage to build up great big buildings what Courage the great build great buildings you know he's talking about these are men they got courage and you got to give it to them that can walk up to a bank and say I need 40 million dollars and they got the courage to go into debt and the courage that somehow I'm gonna pay this off so they have courage but is the prophet said that's not the courage I'm talking about right you can build build big buildings with that kind of Courage yeah you can accomplish a lot of great things that way but that's not the courage that I'm talking about amen yeah the courage I'm talking about is to stay with this word because the squeeze is going to come down and you're going to have to make a choice uh Peter uh uh are you are you with them or uh well you weren't you the man in the garden there that I saw with Jesus not me I wasn't with that message uh that Branham thing I was I was I wasn't with it you see he had the courage to chop off the ears but not the cars to stand with the word the prophet said they got courage to build up them big buildings but even if they're in the message when the real squeeze comes down he says we'll see them how many is going to stand with God's word take the way with God's chosen through God's few and press their way into the kingdom of the Living God Amen yes sir hallelujah oh my think of it courage to go out there and to get them big buildings millions of dollars they got courage to trust God for pipe organs plush seats in their buildings everything else amen and everything else and to courage to press the light from one place to the other cross the world methodists turn them into Baptist Baptist turn them into something else but when it comes to the real Christian Courage to tell them we don't have any denomination we're not bringing you to our church government we're not bringing you into any system we're simply pointing you back to the word we are just Christians what do you mean you're just Christian you got to belong to something we belong to somebody uh you may belong to something but we belong to somebody and that person is Jesus Christ and we are Christians for belief the word of God I'm going to begin to wind this up now praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God you see they have all that courage amen but they don't have the courage to accept the word of God which is this message of the hour amen praise God hallelujah I'm still quoting all the time where I'm talking here again remember what good is the your stones without that stone missing amongst you amen you've got to have a pastor you've got to have one of the faithful Ministry ministering the word on the divine inspiration not just parenting collecting quotes and then put them together in uh logical ways and then bring them out to you no we are not here to be lawyers we are not here to be politicians we are not here to play membership against membership Rich against poor poor poor against Rich because we want to stay in good The Graces or the rich ones in the congregations no sir we are not politicians a real principle word of God and give you a punch from the word with their fists amen now you might know God's word hit your soul amen God's word is the one that's doing the job amen not for favoritism or anything of that matter Hallelujah glory be to God hallelujah I I know many can even say what I'm saying and still turn around and do the same thing they're talking against amen so though I'm telling you keep your spiritual hats on and recognize the devil in all this works he's cunning his Wicked he's smart he's sharp rather Brandon said in the church ages do you think with your little puny mind you're going to go against uh a being that's not an existence of 100 thousands of years and think you're gonna compete with him no that's why you need the presence of God in your life that's why you need Jesus Christ Hallelujah he is the one that has defeated him already defeated him and then he gets that power against that to you now if you believe this word and let me live through you then I can manifest myself through you and continue to manifest my great Victory and make a great parade of him or amen openly praise the Lord glory to God remember God is looking for character you must search yourself whether you are just you have that cartoon you and if you're not sure whether you have that character Lord make it plain to me make it plain to everybody else that that character is in me father because you're looking for character not membership amen Eleazar when he went to get the bride for Isaac he sweated it out until he was able to find someone with that character amen hallelujah remember see what was it that he had to do God wanted him to go out there and say hunt my bride and that's what this preacher the real sermon of God is supposed to do not just because any the church filled up amen and I repeat this again not because to make me look like somebody or something but at one time we had over 500 members and growing and the building we had at that time could not hold them and the parking began to become so clogged in the streets that the people began to complain to the municipality but then as the ministry changed and the word began to be preached and sharper edged sharper cutting shaping forming bringing it into something God wants it to be many fell away not because they're not good people but that little something that God is looking for just was not living there amen I've said it again not that some will not come up as servants as servers as guards or whatever but uh God is looking right now for the elect lady he's looking for his bride and there are few that be amen praise the Lord hallelujah see God bless your hearts we are not looking for members we're looking for the purine heart that will believe the word and I just make a note here God is looking through his ministers for people that can stand the preaching of the real word that can stand the preaching of the word and not move anyway no matter what happened to them they'll stand the word of God hallelujah well yes I looked amen and realize I can't do this by myself he asked for God's help to show him amen Rebecca that bride Elias of God in his knees God help me and when he referred to God God helped him so that the people he found that person he found was Rebecca a person that had character amen see praise God and thank God elieza I mean Rebecca was in love with Isaac before she even saw him is that right do you realize that's repeating again right now brother Branham said in another quotation the one whom you you don't see with your eyes but you feel Limited in your heart one day that person will become personalized before you he'll make himself manifest right before you but she loved him before she even saw him is that right oh we love him praise God before we even see him we see him in the word form but we don't see him in the flesh in front of us but we love him with all our hearts amen praise God and as jeans of the Living God my friends we want to Bow Down and Worship Him and to fulfill his Divine Purpose and we want to remain for the rest of our lives until he catches us home deeply in love with him praise the Lord don't get nervous when I say deeply in love I'm talking about him praise the name of the Lord you must know who you are deeply in love with but as far as I'm concerned I'm deeply in love with my wife I'm deeply in love with the word of God here and I live for that every day that I'm here praise the Lord glory to God thank you for putting up with me thank you Jesus I know because you know sometimes I'm preachers you you you appear like a person that's just come to hang out clothes every you're seeing spots and all these clothes and so you gotta use a piece of stick we call it a beater and beat The Living Daylights out of that sheet and make it white again praise the Lord so so sometimes that's the way you appear but you realize that if us Paul said as preachers we must speak the truth speak the truth in love and love is corrective it's comforting also but it's corrective and I thank God for that may God bless every one of you here today that's all we are trying to do as ministers regardless if whether I'm up here whether it's any of the other young ministers up here we're just trying to shape you to be ready for the rapture you would be in other words Rapture Ready by the change in your character and that change continues to go on Prophet said we will never come to the fullness of that until the Rapture comes and takes you out of here for the sticky nature will be with you amen all the way through until you get out of here the kind of scent that these churches are believing in is believing that they attains sainthood through Perfection of their physical being on the earth and God is saying no sainthood you don't have to physically die to be made a saint you're a saint when the Holy Spirit begins to clean you up from the inside out amen and you become a saint of God Washed by the blood cleansed and made holy while the musicians are coming can we just borrow heads and give praise honor and glory to God hallelujah next week we'll be back preaching the word of God and bringing life and light to you I have the life of God in Me I am the life of God in Me I have his love his nature and his ability I have the life of God in Me I have the life of
