[15:00] [Music]
[15:04] greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus
[15:06] Christ good to be with you here today so
[15:12] [Music]
[15:21] I bring the greetings from all the
[15:24] ministers I know up in Alberta and BC
[15:30] Saskatchewan and overseas from Africa
[15:43] her places we've been and Esther for God
[15:46] as people we're just happening with be
[15:50] with you thank you for the opportunity
[15:53] once again I think it's been three years
[15:55] since we've been here about three years
[15:58] so was getting to be a location wife was
[16:03] missing your family thank Tim also from
[16:07] the can sister Kelly hospitality putting
[16:13] up with us and putting us up working
[16:43] with a brother their pastors and the
[16:49] small work and things that are really
[16:52] starting to grow there and a real fight
[16:56] a man here when you're doing pioneering
[17:00] work
[17:02] I've learned he left he's a real soldier
[17:05] and a pioneer he's young man of yonkers
[17:09] of myself his wife they have no children
[17:12] after their believing for children and
[17:16] recently he his wife was diagnosed with
[17:21] cervical cancer and in part because they
[17:26] said they did some further tests on her
[17:33] in Kenya and said it's not cervical
[17:36] cancer
[17:37] it's tuberculosis now that's strange to
[17:41] me and when we heard it we thought well
[17:44] this is just a lot you know they don't
[17:47] know what it is we banded together we
[17:52] pray fast when we prayed with them and
[17:56] recently that shock of having that
[18:01] diagnosis sent her sister into a real
[18:05] depression and she began to lose her
[18:09] mind and she begin to act differently
[18:15] it's like her spirit had drifted because
[18:19] of that shock so they ended up putting
[18:21] Internet in a hospital and it was just
[18:31] not characteristic ever gone in in their
[18:33] home and I see how they live too sweet
[18:37] she was
[18:40] all the goodbyes open raised in the
[18:44] message different fates and all of
[18:46] sudden Richard month so he just got in
[18:49] front and prayed to believe that comma
[18:52] Hartman things got a little worse you
[18:55] know just before the devil gives up
[18:57] during it almost gets worse hunt and
[19:01] that spirit was just control of her so
[19:04] we kept hanging on we kept believing
[19:07] with him and supporting him and
[19:11] everybody could very expensive to go
[19:14] from Ethiopia to Kenya and hospitals all
[19:17] those things and finally just about two
[19:20] weeks ago she just come around
[19:25] [Applause]
[19:31] they're very happy now and they're
[19:34] spending some time together we can do
[19:35] before they could drink - is he under
[19:38] ministry there so you know he won't
[19:52] believe God's killing the moment he just
[19:54] been determined to get into life imagine
[19:58] and stop the work from going forth ten
[20:01] o'clock zeros there baptized of
[20:03] Pentecostal news for their brother at
[20:07] speaks five languages actually speaks
[20:10] Ethiopia and we're praying that God will
[20:13] give him a revelation of the message of
[20:16] the out of his people baptized him in a
[20:23] pool I think he wanted to try to do it
[20:28] secretly and we said well that's fine
[20:31] you know we could probably get a hotel
[20:33] we went to the hotel
[20:38] there's water what hinders us do you
[20:41] really believe this we went through the
[20:43] scripture again but he hesitated because
[20:45] of his church and his affiliation in
[20:48] their support so I have it off and then
[20:51] that day just everything seemed to come
[20:53] together we got in the pool and baptized
[20:57] the Lord Jesus Christ and I come up with
[21:01] him he looked it was a member of his
[21:03] congregation
[21:22] [Music]
[21:32] [Music]
[21:34] the other thing that's the Ethiopia is
[21:37] recently the government is cracked down
[21:39] one of the brothers should be Ghana that
[21:43] was also a mystery to us all the people
[21:46] he had to leave the country because the
[21:49] government which is mostly Orthodox the
[21:53] Orthodox Christianity there that's forty
[21:55] five percent and thirty three percent
[21:58] and then the problem is about ten
[22:00] percent but they're making inroads
[22:02] processes are many zeros so they want
[22:06] they want to surpass that you want to
[22:11] suppress that so it's a you have to be a
[22:13] doctor of theology you have to have a
[22:17] Theological Seminary
[22:19] certificate in order to be an
[22:23] established church so they're making it
[22:26] harder and the door is seemingly maybe
[22:29] closely but God willing the way others
[22:34] still just internment to depress on
[22:37] there even though the other brother have
[22:39] to go back now it will be
[22:44] and wonderful wonderful things God's
[22:48] doing there we the last time we were
[22:51] there about a young brother over Limpy
[22:53] the nannies and whatever camp of Mike
[22:56] Stewart from Edmonton miraculously young
[23:00] man feel free healing from cancer and
[23:03] that and he's totally free of that and
[23:05] he just has a wonderful testimony about
[23:09] that so he shared that with the Saints
[23:12] over there the Bobby Darin definitely
[23:15] sick and very very sick having that
[23:22] these he's a very slight band through a
[23:26] lot of things viruses and things before
[23:30] before that Trevor asked abscess on
[23:36] these teeth that has dutiful and just
[23:38] different things were were happening at
[23:41] very sick I have to really nurse it back
[23:43] to health and they couldn't go to the
[23:46] remote areas that we wanted to go so we
[23:50] had been up staying at this about the
[23:52] which is the Capitol and he because that
[23:57] happened we we set up meetings in this
[23:59] to the cattle and water than was ever
[24:02] possible with 46 graduating ministers
[24:08] Pentecostal bottles we came in to meet
[24:12] the head of the brother that takes care
[24:15] of it
[24:15] he's a doctor in divinity
[24:18] opportunity they called the doctor I
[24:20] thought he was a that's a lot of your
[24:24] doctor in theology all okay so so we got
[24:27] be said in love with any time to come in
[24:30] mister we've understood their little bit
[24:33] on the countdown and you know this age
[24:36] and what is expected for this ages it
[24:40] was just wonderful went to his home and
[24:42] it is home made the brain for a baby and
[24:46] they have heard that I pray for several
[24:48] other couples there and there's now
[24:52] three babies ever born
[24:56] [Applause]
[25:10] so anyway he heard of this beer in his
[25:13] coffee just treated us like kings and he
[25:19] said would you pray for my wife just be
[25:27] there beside a lot of them do our
[25:29] children and can't happen so I said I
[25:32] just said yes you know that would be
[25:33] fine I just would like that work with
[25:36] you and the Holy Spirit just said just
[25:38] move me to ask them because brother that
[25:43] had been witnessing to them I told them
[25:46] about the baptism in the name of the
[25:49] Lord Jesus Christ so I just felt to ask
[25:52] him straightly
[25:54] if God will give you a child I said will
[25:58] you be baptized in the name of the Lord
[26:00] Jesus Christ as opposed to the
[26:02] neighborhood father son which he's a
[26:05] doctor
[26:07] that was a real challenge and they both
[26:15] agreed and then I asked them what what
[26:19] do you want
[26:23] I just got a text 2 weeks ago
[26:30] [Applause]
[26:40] I'm looking forward to see them began to
[26:48] speak for them so people you'll be and
[26:52] your prayers and missionaries and that
[26:57] missionaries sometimes are forgotten and
[27:00] you don't see them and they're not here
[27:02] and you know about their labor pray for
[27:12] the missionaries reminded when you
[27:17] consider myself I complain too much
[27:25] I gotta have my air conditioning for the
[27:28] car stretching all the way up and then
[27:36] so I want to share that with you
[27:43] respiration there so people just get
[27:48] right to work a little more great I
[28:01] notice all the hair changes and the body
[28:06] state agency but we hopefully were
[28:11] disclosure to the Lord to change amen I
[28:22] hope that's your desire this morning I
[28:25] want you to just pull on the word this
[28:27] morning as we go to the Lord in prayer
[28:30] we're going to turn to 2nd Kings chapter
[28:32] 2 for a scriptural story and we'll up
[28:36] dispute the Lord in prayer and how many
[28:40] have
[29:07] we found your presence Lord Jesus or the
[29:10] songs of silence on me I will touch my
[29:14] heartstrings with brother John find that
[29:17] song Lord Jesus used please Lord don't
[29:21] refuse me surely there's a work that I
[29:24] can do even if it's humble lord up by
[29:28] Milton from Lord heaven to problem today

[29:52] Earth cleanse us by thy blood this point
[29:55] Jesus though our being the bleeding word
[29:58] watch us this morning mother finds us
[30:01] from all these things we know to do
[30:04] right puppy don't do the thought many
[30:07] times Lord we're like that we're a human
[30:10] thought only from dead father come this
[30:12] morning
[30:13] Lord
[30:14] [Music]
[30:15] pleading for your never father may we
[30:25] always find ourselves in the house of
[30:27] the laughs follow you all the days of
[30:30] our lives miss we connect the service to
[30:32] you we commit our vessels to use us
[30:35] father use the gift each one that way
[30:38] the gift in the Saints to receive the
[30:41] word let's read from second kings and I
[30:57] want to take a little thought here this
[30:58] morning on a live chat and Elijah a man
[31:02] whose bride price of the proctor to says
[31:08] that he came to pass when the Lord would
[31:10] take up to heaven by our little buddy
[31:13] that Elijah went with Elijah from yoga
[31:16] and I just said to Elijah remember how
[31:20] the price in the rough
[31:22] Christ think of yourself as a life Terry
[31:31] here at preethi for the Lord has sent me
[31:33] to Bethany
[31:34] what is Bethel the house of God he's
[31:38] sending a backhoe and a large incentive
[31:39] has a Lord liveth and as I so liveth I'm
[31:42] not easy so they went down to Bethel and
[31:45] the sons of the prophets that were at
[31:47] Bethel a fourth to Elisha and said on
[31:50] the another step that the Lord will take
[31:53] away
[31:55] and he said they were going to happen so
[32:27] they came here with us so here he is a
[33:30] holder bees and I just set up in verse
[33:34] six Terry I pray thee here for the Lord
[33:38] he said let's see let's see where we've
[34:39] closed and yes this person and their
[34:44] logic took the banjo I wrapped it
[34:46] together and small the waters and they
[34:48] were divided here as ever so that they
[34:51] too went over on dry ground and it came
[34:54] to pass and what they were gone over and
[34:56] Elias
[34:57] ass what I shall do for thee now look at
[35:02] this now is he says ass work I do not
[35:08] come alert but a light which is plus
[35:13] power which was my lack of spirit is not
[35:16] the spirit of the man when is the Spirit
[35:18] of Christ the light come today is Lord
[35:21] Jesus Christ big event so he he says
[35:25] that's where I shall do unto you he did
[35:27] say listen thus saith the Lord
[35:30] it was like Jesus himself said very nice
[35:38] now talk to us what we say so I shall do
[35:41] for thee before I be taken away from me
[35:48] [Music]
[36:13] [Music]
[36:28] if they are CP when I take it from me it
[36:34] shall be so unto thee but if it if not
[36:38] if you see me if you if you stay with
[36:45] the message on the subject before I
[37:18] share a little bit with you on this as
[37:21] the Lord inspires me and it came to pass
[37:23] as they still when often top that behold
[37:27] there appeared a chariot of fire and
[37:29] horses of fire and parts of both the
[37:31] suckers and I like to went up by a
[37:33] whirlwind attack oh if he would just
[37:40] swing down near his money and then that
[37:44] was in caught in a whirlwind of
[37:48] Revelation in a whirlwind of his
[37:50] presence and here I just saw I like that
[37:54] yes sir
[37:54] Elijah thought the bride season she
[37:59] understands and he cried my father my
[38:03] father to share to this room that
[38:04] horsemen there up and he saw him no more
[38:06] and he took off on his own
[38:09] two pieces and he took up also the
[38:11] mantle of Elijah and fell on him and
[38:13] went back and stood by the Bank of
[38:15] Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah
[38:17] that fell from him and smote the waters
[38:19] and said where is the Lord God of the
[38:23] night
[38:24] amen I like that statement and he also
[38:29] had spent when he also had spent the
[38:31] waters they party together and Elijah
[38:33] went over when the sons of the prophets
[38:36] which were to be with Jericho saw him
[38:39] they said the spirit of Abijah does rest
[38:42] on the life the Spirit of Christ that's
[38:49] our position and they came to meet him
[38:52] and bowed themselves to the ground
[38:53] before him and they said behold now
[38:56] there was fifty strong man let them go
[38:59] after thy master this question I like to
[40:31] send whatever you say no restrictions so
[40:41] you can only ask for that
[40:57] from the church
[40:59] [Music]
[41:05] [Music]
[41:16] [Music]
[41:33] [Music]
[42:10] [Music]
[42:26] sometimes and it's very hard to control
[42:31] but Albarn how many one refill
[42:52] I just up while I was praying for rain
[42:56] but he wanted to take the picture Bible
[43:16] said let the rain fall and there was
[43:18] such a refreshing amen God has that
[43:22] Congress is why I give a gift to my
[43:26] father but I just want to be sensitive
[43:29] for the Holy Spirit this morning and and
[43:33] talking about this now the line is
[43:36] questioned and then there was a response
[43:41] from Elijah and then have that response
[43:45] you know I like to say that's a hard
[43:48] thing for adults peer that unfortunately
[43:51] sphere that maybe never had happened
[43:53] before but there's nothing
[43:58] [Music]
[44:30] [Music]
[44:43] [Music]
[45:07] [Music]
[45:13] you know the problem we'll just watch
[45:19] the church so these are the it's really
[45:31] separated
[46:32] [Music]
[46:37] this message has been accepted
[46:40] beyond the for you for youth and our
[46:44] students of the passage this morning
[46:47] and the terminal but we know that the
[46:51] Bible says that the pure light will use
[46:53] five we use five times a map so there's
[46:59] there's a student that's great
[47:01] five is great it had to be the spirit of
[47:05] logic at the end time so we see now that
[47:09] this question of faith there's been many
[47:12] questions
[47:16] yes so when Elijah prayed ask that
[47:20] question feel free in the end it is
[47:24] subconscious faith he knew something was
[47:27] telling him
