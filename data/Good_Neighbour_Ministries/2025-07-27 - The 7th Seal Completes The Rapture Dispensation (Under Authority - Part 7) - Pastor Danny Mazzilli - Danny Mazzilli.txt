I know that um uh in speaking to brother Tong and I, his family was going to be arriving this week. I guess um they're uh settling in. Oh, there he is. Where are they, brother? two days. Praise God. All right, let's keep uh Brother Tonganai's family in prayer. His wife and children will be arriving in two days and he's counting every second, believe me. Amen. Praise God. And so, um uh we want to give God glory. Uh we want to thank God for Sister Sheila. Uh Elanga's surgery went extremely well. Um we were able to be with her. Amen. Praise God. She had a very serious brain uh surgery operation that was done last Monday. We were able to be there about an hour before she went into the surgery. Prayed with her, with her husband, with her father, her mother, and the spirit of God just came and um she went into that operating room rejoicing. Amen. Praise God. And so I'm going to leave the the testimony, the rest of the testimony for her. She's going to she's going to give testimony. She's going to sing for us. She's going to be back right here in the house of the Lord. Amen. So we want to give God praise for that. Amen. Glory to God. So um our upcoming meetings at the end of August, I've been in touch with brother Kry. Everything is on schedule. He will be here. Um, we've got confirmation from brethren that are coming from Quebec, some young people that are coming from local ministries. Brother Jimmy uh in in uh Scar Bro in Toronto, Brother Nelson, Brother Gerard. We've been in touch with all of them and they're all looking forward to the upcoming meetings. Well, um listen, invite your friends, family, young people, invite, um, you know, young people to be here. We are open to see what the Lord will do for them. Nobody is exempt. Everybody is a candidate for the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, we want to thank God for that. And then this weekend, we'll be going to the uh family camp. Uh brother Dale Langstaff is hosting a family camp this upcoming weekend. I don't know if there's any of you that might go there for a day or two. We're going to be there on the Friday night, the Saturday morning for the services and then we'll be back here on Sunday. Praise God. And so, we look forward to that. Amen. And now let us move into the service and let us uh allow the Holy Spirit to speak to our hearts. God bless you saints. Thank you for your uh the wonderful songs of Zion. Amen. To prepare our hearts to get us into heavenly places to receive the word of God. Amen. Praise God. I trust you're you're expecting this morning that you've come with an expectation in your heart that the Lord will give you something. You know, I'm not a deep preacher. I'm just a a you know, someone that the the Lord reveals and places things on my heart. I want I want to see from the youngest to the oldest to receive a portion of the word of God. Everybody needs their portion. If you've got faith, God will speak to you. God will God will give you what you have need of. whether you're a young child or whether you're seasoned in the word and you know the Lord's been uh uh you know ministering through your life and and you've uh you know you've really reached a level of maturity that's wonderful but God you know when God wants to open something up he just unlocks the revelation to your heart and all of a sudden it becomes glorious one revelation from the Lord can change your entire life from this moment on &gt;&gt; amen that's the God that we serve. Praise our God forever more. And so we're going to read our scripture. Um it's from the book of Revelations, chapter 8. We're going to continue um in the thoughts that we've been discussing over the last uh you know, five, this is our sixth week. I believe it'll probably end next week. I thought maybe it might end this week. I don't think so. But let's see what the Lord uh says and what the Lord does because every time I go to study I I see more and I I see the simplicity and how important it is to minister to every level of of uh sons and daughters of God and and and the people. Amen. They all need to hear the word of God for this day and this hour. So let's read the word. Revelations chapter 8 verse one. Very simple scripture. It says, "And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour." Let us pray. Father, we so appreciate, Lord, that we can read your word and we can even agree with your word. But there's more than that, Father. There's the part that we can receive your word. And Lord, it it is something that when we receive it, it changes our hearts. It changes our lives. It brings uh situations in our uh in our surroundings subject to your word because the word of God has an effect upon our lives. And Lord, today we're asking you to speak to the needs that are in our midst. Oh God, through these uh through this series, through these teachings, uh Lord, may you speak and and do great things in our lives that will draw us into a closer relationship. Bring us to the attention of how it pertains to us, personal in this day, not churchianity, but personal. Lord, this is what we're interested in. This is what we desire. that personal walk with you, Lord. Grant it. Walk with us, talk with us, inspire us, and hear through us. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. Praise God. God bless you, saints. You may be seated. Amen. Glory to God. So, we've been on a series of being under authority. And when we recognize that being under the authority of the word of God, it places us in a in into a a position of authority. Amen. And it allows us to to be carriers of the word for this day and for this hour. And as carriers of the word, we carry the word of life. And you know, we become written epistles read of all men. We become uh the voice of God in in these in these last days when we can recognize what it is to receive his word and to come under the leadership of his word. Amen. And so last week we read the scripture on in Ephesians where you know where it talks about in in verse 10 it says that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ. &gt;&gt; When we look at the word Christ it means anointed. &gt;&gt; It means the anointed one. It means where God's word is being anointed in this day and in this hour. And you know when Jesus Christ was on the earth, he was the anointed word being manifest to the people. &gt;&gt; And those that recognized him recognized the anointed word for their day. &gt;&gt; It brought them into the fellowship of the word. It brought them into being a part of the word. They walked with him. They talked with him. They fellowshipped with him. They were given power and authority to cast out demons to to to to pray for the sick. All of those things were because of the anointing of Christ that was upon them. And both which and it continues both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him. And so we've been talking about dimensions. We've been talking about the influence of dimensions. how important it is to understand that it gives us the ability to understand our existence, our purpose, our uh placing in the word of God in the day that we're living in. We're not just churchgoers. We're not just church members. We don't just belong to Good Neighbor Ministries on New Street. We belong to the mystical living body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We've come into a contact with the living God. Amen. Praise God. And so this understanding and this uh you know um revelation of your existence, it it it gives you uh uh uh perfect faith to know what to do with the word of God in your day to realize what it is that God requires of our lives. Amen. And this is, you know, and and when you don't have a revelation of what God is doing in your day, you you you're you're being tossed about by the influences of that fifth dimension, which is the dimension of the lost, the dimension of death and hell. It's it's a it's a place where where uh influence is all over the earth right now. It's never been as strong as it is right now, but never has there been a time where the influence of Christ himself has been so strong upon the church in this day and in this hour. Amen. And so all religions of the world, they're trying to figure out, you know, what happens after death. They're all trying to figure out where they're going to go after this dimension. And that's why there's so many teachings. But we thank God that God sent us a prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; That gave us an insight. Not only did he, you know, uh, read and talk about the scriptures and and expound on the scriptures, but he was the scripture being fulfilled in his day under the scriptures of Malachi 4:5, Revelations 10:1-7. He was given the ability to go interdimensional. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the people were all in confusion as to what would happen after death. There's confusion in all the different churches. Some are seeing a rapture where people are just going to float up into the air. They've got all kinds of teachings. Some say, "Oh, well, you were a dog in your previous life and in this one now you're a human. You've you've you know, you've you've risen into a higher form of consciousness." No, it's all teachings and theories of man. Amen. It took a God sent prophet with thus sayeth the Lord &gt;&gt; to come in the 20th century to restore the word of God back to the faith of the fathers. Amen. &gt;&gt; It took a a God sent prophet not vindicated by man, not because I'm telling you, but because God vindicated the ministry. God stood behind the pulpit. And when he when when he said, "Thus sayaeth the Lord, rise up, a man that was crippled from birth, a blinded man, somebody that would drop dead." And the Holy Spirit would say, "Pray over that and call it back to life." Over and over again, it happened. There was testimonies. What was God doing? Vindicating his word &gt;&gt; for that day so that the could draw the people to the attention of the word of God. It's always been the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Drawing the attention back to the word. Amen. Amen. Glory to God. And so we looked at how God was bringing an anointing through every age and all the all the church ages and how the the anointing is the Holy Ghost. To receive the Holy Ghost is to receive the the the word and the standard to overcome the age that you're in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that's why it's so important. You're never going to not hear it from this pulpit. Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? You could be a Christian. You could be going to a Baptist church, Presbyterian church, Catholic church. You could be going to a message church. Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? Because to receive the Holy Ghost, it's is to receive him &gt;&gt; in the power of his resurrection. That'll open the word of God to you like never before. that when you read the word, the spirit gives it life. &gt;&gt; It comes out of the book, comes out of the becomes a brand new book. That's why brother Brandham, you know, when he said it's become a brand new book is because he was moving through the dispensations. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And so we are today we're going to be looking at go to the next slide. We're going to be looking at the seventh seal and how it completes the rapture dispensation. Remember, the opening of that seventh seal was the opening of the mystery of God. We're going to be looking at it a little more in depth to see how it is that it's that that that it just continues to unveil itself and it's going to complete everything. &gt;&gt; It's going to bring everything to a completion. The part that we are in right now is called the rapture of the church. And so we're interested in how the seventh seal is going to unveil itself, which is him to us in order to bring us into our position to fulfill the rapture. Amen. Praise God. So let's let's move along here. Let's see what the Lord is going to give us. And you pray and believe. I believe God will give us something that will uh inspire us and and give us something to to to look, you know, to to keep pressing on, saints. This is this is what this message does. The Holy Spirit gives us faith to keep pressing on. Amen. And so it's so important for us to recognize the ministry that that William Branham had in the opening of the word and and especially in the dispens dispensational change that took place in 1963. Last week I was reading to you some quotes from uh having conferences with God where brother Brandham gives his account of going beyond the curtain of time. And there was a portion of it if you remember last week I couldn't find it because I had accidentally deleted it. And so I realized that you know what it was meant for today. So let's go to the next slide. And here now so this is a continuation now. Brother Brandham is caught up into that sixth dimension. He's crossed over beyond the curtain of time and he's he's seeing, you know, uh the the woman there that he led to Christ when she was 90 years old. And she was a young, beautiful woman in a perfect beautiful body of a young lady. Amen. But there was no connection. There was no sensation when they hugged and they came to him and oh God bless you, brother Brandham. The He said there was nothing but perfect love in that dimension. But look at what happens here. And he goes on, he says, "And I said,"Well, well, what what do you set me up here for?" Because they were taking him to set him up before the people. And they said, "You was a leader. You led us." And I said, "Oh, let me see Jesus if I've passed over." You see, he thought, "Well, praise God. I'm here. I've arrived, you know, and and and I want to see him." And that voice said, "You can't see him now." Said, "He will come, but first he will come to you." And said, "Judge you by the gospel you preached." &gt;&gt; You see, he was given a word for his day. &gt;&gt; He was given the revelation for that day and for that hour. And it led hundreds and millions of people, hundreds of thousands. He says he it was a sea of people. Amen. and said it'll and and I said brother Bram says and I said the gospel I preach they said yes and I said well with will St. Paul have to stand before his converts. They said absolutely he will too. &gt;&gt; And I said I never varied one word. He said I stayed just exactly the way the Bible said it. I don't care what anyone said or did not say. I stayed right with it like that. So if Paul's group is saved, mine is too. And a great scream came from looked like thousands and thousands and said, "We know that." &gt;&gt; Amen. See, they had they had received the word that that when they received their word in their day, it placed them into that sixth dimension, which is the the the the dimension of the redeemed. They realized that that was exactly the right word. And listen what brother Bram says. He said, "Praise God, I never was so happy that I stayed true to the word." &gt;&gt; Oh my. See, I was never so happy. He came to realize that the word that he had received was absolutely the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. It had produced exactly what the Lord said that it was going to produce. And I'm saying to you, Amen. you stay true to the word of God that God has given you in this day and in this hour. Stay loyal to that word. Don't vary from that word. Don't allow the the the the you know the complacency of what Christianity has become in this day and in this hour to draw you away from from this uh this beautiful unadulterated word of God that he's placed into your hearts that he's given you in this day and in this hour. Amen. Praise God forever more. Hallelujah. And so we can um we can realize now that that this dimension of the of the redeemed, it's a reality. We don't have to question it. We know that that that you know, brother Brandham's ministry was vindicated of God. There was not one time that he said, "Thus sayeth the Lord," that it wasn't 100% accurate, proven over and over again. And we can believe that. Then you can believe this. &gt;&gt; You can believe that if you if you if you die, if you're not one of those ones that are going to be translated in the rapture, that's you know, because some are going to leave before before the rapture. Remember that the the rapture is a process and everybody's got their time and their season. And that's why we don't worry whether I die now or I go in the rapture. It's all the same thing. I'm going to be with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to be in in that in that place of eternal life. Glory to God. And so, let's go on now. Let's move on. I just wanted to share that with you that you know that that this word that we've received. It's it's it's the only thing that we need. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't need to vary off or go off and look for anything else. This is the word that will produce the rapture of the body of Jesus Christ. Amen. And so, here we go. Now, we're looking at the at the seventh dimension. Last week, we finished off with the sixth. Now, we're looking into the seventh. And the seventh dimension, well, the seventh dimension, go to the next slide, is is uh is where God is. Amen. It it's where God dwells in the seventh dimension. He alone rules the universe by his power and majesty. Heaven is his throne and earth is his foottool. One day his kingdom will come down on earth. Amen. Praise God. Heaven and earth will embrace together. The power of God will fill the earth and everything will get back to eternity. All those with eternal life. How do you get eternal life? You need the Holy Ghost because it is eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Repent. Be baptized. You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Long as you're human, you're going to have to come God's provided way. Amen. Praise God. You're going to fulfill the word according to the word because you are the word. When you receive the word, amen. And so, the power of God will fill the earth and everything will get back to eternity. All those with eternal life in them will enjoy their existence in his presence. &gt;&gt; You see, this is what we need to realize right now. We're living in a human existence and we're torn between the reality of God and having to go to work tomorrow morning and having to deal with with heartache and sickness and broken relationships and and all kinds of situations that are in our lives. We're we're we're living in a in an existence where if we don't wake up, if we don't come out of our stuper, and our slumber, and our laziness, and come into a recognition of what God is doing in this hour, we live miserable. We live uh you know, underprivileged. We don't live at the capacity. We should be the freest people on the earth, the happiest people on the earth. Amen. because God has filled us with himself with his spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; But but we've only, you know, uh we we it's the Holy Ghost upon us right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. And which is the anointing which is what which which is what gives you the ability to recognize the word in your day. The to to recognize God sent a prophet to to recognize that the the seals have been opened. What the se what the opening of the seals were. why the mighty angel comes down. You know, the lamb in in in Revelations 4 has got up to takes the book and then in Revelations 5, there's nobody worthy to open the book. And then all of a sudden in Revelations chapter 10, here's the mighty angel coming down with an open book. What does that all mean? We you if you go out into the Christian world right now and you ask them about what's the book all about, they're going to say, "What book? The Bible. Oh, the Bible. Oh, yeah. I've read the Bible. No, no, we're talking about the open book. We're talking about a book that that that John had a revelation of in in the book of Revelations. Let's let's move along here. Let's let's see how the Holy Spirit is going to show us things here. And so here now, um I I was Let's read the next scripture. We're going to go to Revelations chapter 1. I'm just laying in a little bit of a foundation here because we need to understand and people need to understand. That's why I'm saying, you know, you we we could go straight into the half hour of silence and and talk about all the the the deep things of the opening of the word and the seven seals, but but we need to have an understanding of God. &gt;&gt; That's where the confusion is. You see, this whole plan of redemption and the opening of the seventh seal in particular is all about the mystery of God. God uniting with man. It was all about God being with man and man understanding God and God being their their their their absolute so that they could walk with him, talk with him. Everything surrounds knowing who God is. Amen. And to not know him, to think that he's Allah in the Muslim teachings, to think that he's a whatever, a bird or something in the in the Buddhism or, you know, all these different existences that that they that they've created, they have no idea. They make him a new age uh consciousness. They make them know. You need to understand dimensions. You need to understand that God was moving from the self-existent one from before the foundations of this world and had a desire to move and to condescend and to become one with man, &gt;&gt; you and me. And there's a way that he's doing it. He's not the author of confusion. Amen. People say, "Oh, well, all roads lead to Rome." You might find yourself on a on a on a road and thinking that you're going to Rome and you find yourself uh meeting up with some some Roman soldier that chops your head off because of some teaching or some tradition of man. Amen. We need to we need the Holy Spirit. If the same spirit that raised Christ, the anointed word for that day, raised him from the dead, if it dwell in you, it'll not only guide you into all truth, it'll quicken you into that dimension with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not there yet. Oh, we we we we get to, you know, uh rejoice when we come to church and we get into heavenly places. Listen, we're going to tell it just the way it is. Saints, don't tell me you're living, oh, hallelujah, every day and you're praising God and everything is perfect. I'm telling you, tomorrow morning you're going to deal with stuff. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to overcome things in this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. We are in heavenly places when we come into the church and we get all caught up and it's wonderful to hear the word of God, but then you got to go out there and live it. But if you know that greater is he that is in you &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world out there while you're in this dispensational time element where you are being translated into the existence with God while you're in this transition you can you can receive word instruction uh uh uh uh revelation on on situ situations that are in your life where the enemy is trying to defeat you and and to bring you down. Amen. Praise God. But let's let's let's be real. We need to live our lives. Amen. We need to understand that we are overcomers. That we've been given the Holy Ghost for the purpose to to overcome. &gt;&gt; So whenever you face a trial, don't let the enemy just knock you down. get back up again and say, "The Lord gives." Hallelujah. The Lord takes and he's taken this spirit of condemnation out of my life. He's taking this spirit of depression out of my life. He's taking this sickness that's been trying to hinder me all the days of my out of my life. Amen. And he's given me peace. He's given me the the the the the ability to walk as a victor, as a overcomer in this day and in an age where the people are falling left, right, and center and and and being pulled into all kinds of man's teachings and traditions and deceptions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But here in Revelations 1:10 to12, he says, "I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as a trumpet, saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last. And what thou seeest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia, unto Ephesus, unto Samia, unto Pergamus, unto Thitia, unto Sardis, unto Philadelphia, and unto Leodysia. And I turned to see the voice. He turns to see the voice which spake to to me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks. Now let's move to the next verse. And in the midst, next slide. And in the midst of the seven candlesticks, one like unto the son of man. &gt;&gt; Now, now you got to notice here. This is what what what what I want to draw out of this because I want you to see that we have always had a part in this whole plan of redemption. You're going to come to realize that the God that you've come into contact with is is as much God in you as you are in him. When Adam was in the Garden of Eden, she was from him and she was an exact expression of him in female form. And so here, now listen. So he sees one like unto the son of man. Not the son of man. When we talk about the son of man, we're talking about Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; but one like unto the son of man. Because remember, you know, John is now interdimensional. You got to understand that like brother Brandham when he was able to look into that dimension and see the individual that had been at the doctor the day before and talking to the doctor and listening exactly what the doctor said and was able to tell her where and what the doctor said where what the ailment was where she lived where she city she came from everything that was because he was interdimensional. He was able to move into that dimension where there is no time. &gt;&gt; And now you can see everything that happened here and there and there and back there. You can see in every direction. That's why he knows the end from the beginning. And so John being caught up in the spirit on the Lord's day is telling you that he was in heavenly places. He was not in this earthly dimension. He was seeing things that nobody else could see. And he was told to write those things. And look, and he says, "Clothed with a garment down to the foot and a girth about the paps with a golden girdle. His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were as a flame of fire, and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace, and his voice as the sound of many waters. Now, we we know that when we hear the voice was the sound of many waters, we know that that's people's, nations, tongues. Those are that represents the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen here to what brother Brandham says in this quote here from the seven church ages in 1954. Now that's the Bible. He says that's what the spirit says. See the candlesticks. All right. He's he's commenting on this verse that we just read. Now the 13th verse. And in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, one like the son of man. What? One like him. Who was this? his bride. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. You mean you mean she was always there? She was always a part of him. She was the voice of many waters that that that that that he was when when he said, "Tell these things to all the churches." You see, we are we are people of time and we are people that place things in the moment because of our earthly experience here in this dimension. But when you move into the mind of God and know that God is eternal. We've heard this over and over and over again. He had no beginning and he has no end. He sees the end from the beginning. The beginning from the He sees it all. He's omniscient. Amen. What he says his bride one like him. &gt;&gt; Watch how it was clothed with a garment down to the foot. The holiness of Jesus Christ covering her has washed us from our sins with his own blood. Oh, glory to God. All right. Gird about the paps. Not a man, a woman. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She is the body of Jesus Christ. She is the female part of God himself. Amen. She's been always a part of him. He could never do this. He could not fulfill the plan of redemption without you. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Without me, we're we're a we're a part of that with a golden girdle. The gospel that held the power and glory of God over the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; So now we see here that this it was it we we've all always been in his mind. We were always a part when when the listen when the Holy Ghost came to to those that were the the the attributes of God through those church ages. They were receiving the the the anointing of the Holy Spirit of the Holy Ghost upon their lives which would give them the ability to overcome the age that they were in because God was working towards this great mystery of he himself coming down again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To indwell not just in the in the seventh dimension. He wanted to come and take on the seventh dimension, the sixth dimension, the first dimension, and the second dimension right here in our bodies. When we go into what is the next stage of our ministry, &gt;&gt; we need to realize that there's a progression that's going to take us into that dimension. We're not there yet. &gt;&gt; We experience it. &gt;&gt; We experience the supernatural. You're going to see God do miracles. &gt;&gt; You're going to see God discern situations in your life. &gt;&gt; But as long as you're still in time, you're going to have to deal with this dimension. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a transition. And the seventh seal completes the rapture dispensation. &gt;&gt; But that's not the end of it all. It moves on. But we're but but we're concerned with what is going on right now. We want to know what God requires now. What the word is going to produce now. How I got to surrender to the word for my day so that it brings me into my position so that I can be what he wants me to be. Amen. Praise God. And so here we see and uh that that uh that that who the who the bride is and and and where she fits in. Now let's go to the next slide here in Revelations chapter 1 17 and 18. He goes on and he says, "And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, fear not. I am the first and the last. I am he that liveth and was dead and is alive. Behold, I am alive forever more. Amen. And have the keys of hell and death. Saints, he's the one that went to Calvary. He's the one that went to the cross. He's the one that took your sin. He was the He was Look, and he's making it very clear here. You don't have to be getting confused about Trinity. You don't have to be confused. He says, "I'm the first and the last." You don't have to get all confused about who Jesus is. Jesus, when he was in the form of Jesus, he was the son of God here on earth. But he was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was the anointed word in order to fulfill his own word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That said, if a man's sin, a man must die. And he says, "Don't worry. I'm gonna take that place &gt;&gt; because my redemption has to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; My plan of re of uniting myself holy with man must be fulfilled. My my my my my whole existence is based on myself with my with my bride with my my people with my own attributes. before we were even before he was even God. He was attribute form. He was the self-existent one. Before you were uh you know expressed here onto this earth as an attribute you were an attribute in God in female form. &gt;&gt; You were an attribute in female form within God. And God just expressed it. Amen. And so here he goes on. He says, "I am he that liveth and was dead. Behold, I am alive forever more. I've got the keys of death and hell. And And who needs the keys of death and hell in this hour? The bride. The bride. Because the pale horse rider, death and hell follows him. Everybody that that that that's that's under denominational teachings and the and the teachings of this world, Satan, that pale horse rider that's riding into all the churches, riding in right into this message, saints, the pale horse rider will never stop riding and death and hell is following him because they have not come into the understanding of the opening of the word and the importance of the mighty angel coming down to unite with the body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so here we see what is Jesus telling us? He's the first. He's the last. There's no other gods. He was with the true church right from the beginning. Amen. From Pentecost all the way right up until now, he's been there with the true church. He raised a standard by giving each age his anointing to overcome each age. And now he's he went to he went to hell when he when he when he died at the cross. He went to paradise to hell right into that fifth dimension and he took the keys of death and hell and now he holds it. He he no more Satan can have power over the sons and daughters of God to keep them into bondage. If you recognize that the one who holds the keys to death and hell is in you today, there's nothing that should be holding you back. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that should be keeping you in a defeated condition any longer. Amen. You should be victorious. You should be overcoming every day. It's not easy to overcome. I'm not saying it's a bed of roses, but understand he that is in you, he that is with you, he that has already overcome for you. Amen. Praise God. All that was in God, he poured into Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And all that was now, all that was poured into Christ, he's poured it into the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's move along here. We're we're we're we're we're we're get we're going somewhere, saints. And God said in Genesis 1 verse 26-28, "And God said, let us make man in our own image after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." I want you to understand that that when God made man in his image, when God was expressing himself, he had absolute supreme authority over everything. &gt;&gt; Everything. And so God created man in his own image. In the image of God created he him. Male and female created he them. You see, it was it's it's him expressed in male and female having full dominion, full authority, full uh he was he was the absolute supreme speh species on the earth that if he spoke nature would have to obey him that whatever he said it had to obey him. This is who we are. And God blessed them. And God said unto them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it." And what did he say? Have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. Amen. Praise God. And the next slide says in verse 31, "And God saw everything that he had made. And behold, it was very good. Everything was perfect. Everything was exactly the way he wanted it. The way that he had spoken it, the way that it's exactly the way and everything and the evening and the morning were the sixth day." And now notice in the next chapter, chapter 2, thus the heavens and the earth were finished. So God had created this existence of heaven and earth and he had placed man and and and you know we we know that you know when we talk when when he says replenish we know that there that there may have been previous uh you know existences and previous uh you know uh worlds whatever that that's irrelevant. We know that the word of God that the worlds were framed by the word of God. But this is the world that pertains to us and this is what we need to be focused on. Amen. And so the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made. And he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. Now, Brother Brandham said that if you don't see Jesus Christ from Genesis to Revelation, go back and read it again because he's he's showing himself in every type throughout every character throughout the whole entire Bible. That seventh seal, he even said, was expressed in the book of Genesis. This seventh day is a type of the seventh seal where God rests from all that he had done. Does God need to rest? God doesn't sleep. God doesn't sleep. God is God is eternal. He just is. But notice what he said. It was all very good what he had created. Adam and Eve were exactly perfect in the way that he wanted to express and he knew that he could place he had given them the authority over the over the earth and he wanted them now to express themselves and to do all that he had in his mind all that he had desired to do. God didn't rest. God was showing that there would be a seventh day, a seventh seal that would come on the scene in in our day where God would would would step back and allow his bride now in in in the form of the church, the body of Christ through the opening of the word to enter into his rest, which is to have and to do what he had always desired to do &gt;&gt; that seventh day when he rested and he stood back and said it's all good is because you were exactly the way God wanted you to be and he saw that everything was going to come forth until we see what happens in Genesis 3 where the serpent comes along and changes the program so that now he becomes a redeemer. Amen. So thus the heavens and the earth were finished all the host of them. God blessed the seventh day. Verse three and and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God had created and made. But now there's a work that's going on because this was just a type of what God was going to be doing in this day that we were going to because this plan that he had in his mind, he's going to fulfill it. And we are going to we are going to be the body of Christ that's going to fulfill this uh plan of redemption and fulfill the rapture dispensation. Amen. Praise God. Let's read the next quote. He says, "And so God knew that we would be here. But then he put us in flesh so we could be contacted. In order he could contact, he become one of us when he become Jesus Christ, the son of God himself, the fullness of the manifestation of God. Therefore, that was God's purpose to display his attributes in fellowship. When I was in my father, I knew nothing about it. But when I become his son and was born of him, I was an attribute, a part of my father. And you're a part of your father. And as children of God, we are a part of God's attribute that was in him, made flesh like he was made flesh. So we can have fellowship one with the the other as a family of God upon the earth. And that was God's purpose at the beginning. It was always his purpose and his desire at the beginning. Amen. Next slide. That's what God wanted at the beginning. He had everything under control and he turned man over into the Garden of Eden on free moral agency. Say, "Son, it's yours." What a beautiful place. God was so satisfied till he just went back and rested from all his works. Every tree never brought forth thorns and thistles. No berries ever come off of a thorn tree. Everything was perfect. &gt;&gt; All seeds were perfect. Everything was in perfect condition. Then when he went to take a little rest, his enemy slipped in with deceit and took it over by misrepresenting his program to his children. And saints, this is what has happened over the last 2,000 years. The enemy had slipped in and and perverted the word of God and deceived many through all the church ages. But those that recognized their day and their message, they were those that that that because when when he went to to hell, he that that sixth dimension became available to those that were redeemed. All of a sudden, there was a place for those that could receive God, that could receive his word, that that could recognize what God was doing in their day. And if they died under that dispensation, they went right to the place of the redeemed. You see, he made a way for them. The enemy had slipped in and deceived. And the enemy is still in the camp. &gt;&gt; He's still deceiving the people. He has he's he's come in and and and and now it's it's working in the midst of of the same spirit, the same pale horse rider, the same deceiving spirit, the same denominational teachings, uh the same uh uh lying spirits to try and get the people off the word of God. Amen. And get them to go into a into the wrong direction. Amen. Praise God. But God knew that in 1963, there would be a coming. There would be an opening of the seventh seal. There would be a messenger on the earth to receive. There would be a son of man meeting with the son of man, the mighty angel coming down. That same one that John saw clothed with a white cloud. That same one appeared in 1963. Now, we can say all day long, it was the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It was the coming of the Lord. But why is it that when we tell people about 1963 and about the cloud, that's why we wear the cloud? We don't wear this to say that we belong to some cult or some organization, some cloud organization. No, we recognize that this cloud was a significant event. It was a supernatural event that took place in 1963. It was the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something. There's a lot of people that the Lord hasn't come to yet. &gt;&gt; The coming of the Lord back in 1963 was wonderful, but he has to come to you personal. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not until the coming of the Lord becomes a personal experience with you on the opening of the word and and and recognizing the message for this hour that God sent a prophet that God opened those seals back in 63 and that there's now an open book that's in the hands of the of the of the actually it's now been given over to the church &gt;&gt; to take the book. Hallelujah. Praise God. And so I don't want to get ahead, but here now we need to understand how it's important that it's not just to say that we saw a cloud in a newspaper article back in Life magazine. We need to understand what that cloud represented. We need to know why the clouds showed up in 1963 and how there was an individual on the earth by the name of William Brham that was given visions and given uh instruction to go and and preach the opening of those seven seals. The opening of those seals unlocked a lot of the mysteries of what had already taken place throughout the seven church ages. The the the opening of the sixth seal that that opened up and there's many things that that were un unlocked through the mystery of the opening of that sixth seal. But it was a lot of it was history. Yes, the great tribulation is going to come, but it it opened up World War I, opened up World War II, opened up the the, you know, the dark ages and all the the the the wars and the rumors of wars and the and the and the pestilences and the and the and the earth, you know, uh having you know, shifting of the earth and floods and all these things and natural disasters on the earth. That's all under the sixth seal. It was all unveiled. All those mysteries were unveiled. But the seventh seal &gt;&gt; is the one that that unveils the mystery of God. &gt;&gt; The mystery of how God himself is going to come into a a a church body &gt;&gt; and and going to actually produce the rapture &gt;&gt; for the next stage and for the completion of the rapture dispensation. Amen. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal is the element that that's why when when you know if Okay, let's read our next scripture here and then we'll get to it. We're going to wind down here slowly. Colossians chapter 1 verse 25- 27. It says, "Whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God." Every minister that reads this scripture, when I read this scripture, I see myself as that minister. I see because because I've received the word and I recognize what the word is going to produce in this hour. And he says, I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God. And I'm in a rapture dispensation. The rapture is something that has always been of of of like intrigue in in in my life right from the very beginning when I came to this message. I couldn't get away from it because that's the portion of the word that I believe we fulfill. We're in that moment. We're in that time. And he says now, but he goes on. He says, "Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but is now made manifest to his saints." It's so now there's a word that's being revealed. There's a there's an unwritten part of the word of God because when the mighty angel came down, put his foot on the sea and on the land, he was suppressing some powers. He was suppressing some some powers that that that were controlling the churches and controlling the politics and and and and because he was now coming to say that time shall be no more and that there that seven thunders uttered their voices and even though John saw what was what was spoken because we know the thunders was the voice of God and even though John heard what was spoken he was told not to write it. So there was something that was spoken that was not for that particular time and we need to understand that that's where the dispensations come in. That's where the dispensational changes come in. That's where the dimensional connections come in where God who operates in the seventh dimension decides to come down clothed in a cloud takes on the sixth dimension of the angels. Brother Aram says that that that God made the angels his his way of becoming visible here into this dimension. And those and those angels they they represented God coming down to unveil and to open the word. It was God himself. God himself coming down to take possession of a people so that they could understand that that there'd be an age. Now it's made manifest to his saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of the mystery among the Gentiles. And look what he says. Which is Christ in you, &gt;&gt; your hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Let's read the next slide. God's provided place of worship. But he promised just before the coming of the end time, the world would get like it was in Sodom, where a man came down in human form, three of them, two angels, and God himself. &gt;&gt; Now, how many understands that we're in the days of Sodom? &gt;&gt; We're we're we're we're we're in a sodomite condition. Now, understand that we are talking now where brother Brandham now, here he is in 1965. the seals have been open. He knows that the seals are open. He knows what this that the book is now been open. He knows that the plan of redemption that the book is it's an open book. It's unveiling the mystery of God where God himself now is come down to take man and possess man and to become one with man. God and man becoming one. What he had in his mind from before the foundations of the world. Brother Brandham knew this was coming. He knew it was in progress. &gt;&gt; He understood the hour that he was living in. He saw the prophecy being fulfilled around him. And look what he goes on to say. He says, "And there was three of them, two angels and God himself." That was God. The Bible said it was. Now he came down and he manifested himself there by turning his back to the tent where Sarah was and told Abraham what Sarah was thinking in the tent. Listen, Abraham and Sarah is a perfect type of the bride and Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Sarah was a part of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. God had given Abraham a promise that she would bring forth a son. Amen. And it's just like the same promise that God's given you. We are God's Sarah in this hour. We're the one who says, "Be it unto me according to thy word." Amen. Because God went and visited Sarah. &gt;&gt; He went and actually visited Sarah and he told her and he came to her to to fulfill what he had promised he was going to do. &gt;&gt; Just like he's come to you and to me in this day and in this hour to recognize that he is telling us exactly what he's going to do in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, uh, here, brother Brandham in his day, he realized the scripture that was being fulfilled around him. He knew, he even told us who those two angels were. It was Oral Roberts and Billy Graham. They were the ones like in the days of Lot. But who was with Abraham? There was one there by the name of Melzdc who had no father, no mother, had no beginning and no end. Who was that? Amen. &gt;&gt; That was God in human flesh that had come down to meet with Abraham to break bread and to drink milk. Hallelujah. God was in human flesh proving that he can come interdimensional anytime he wants. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And that's what's promised to us. Amen. And so here he says Abraham what Sarah was thinking in the tent. That's right. Congregation says, Now Jesus himself said at that day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of Jesus Christ himself whenever he says son of man ministry it's Jesus Christ himself &gt;&gt; and he is now moving into another son of man ministry &gt;&gt; in bride form &gt;&gt; in the bride to fulfill the next stage of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so we need to recognize and understand. Let's move on. Next slide. The church will come through justification, through Luther, through sanctification, through Wesley, through the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the Pentecostals and go right on into perfection of the Son of Man. Hallelujah. That's when husband and wife will be the same selfpersons. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. God will be so manifested in his bride, his church, till they will both be the same. They are one. Now you see where we're at. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now you see. So, so you got to see that brother Brandham, he was the first fruits of the opening of that seventh seal &gt;&gt; where the mighty angel himself would come down. What do you think when brother Brandham was saying that that that Abraham where the where the the the the the the angel came turned his back to Sarah and told Abraham what Sarah what what the promise that would happen to Sarah told her why did Sarah laugh was discerning the thoughts and intents of his heart. Did not William Brham stand on stages night after night and fulfill this very prophecy? &gt;&gt; What was God doing? showing that he was now coming to fulfill the final stage of the word of God for our day. And he stood there and brother Brandham, it wasn't William Brandham that discerned those things. He could not he could not look into into their into their lives. It was the mighty angel himself. He says, "The angel is here right now. You know, I've been waiting on him." &gt;&gt; He'd say, "I can't do nothing without him." And then he'd look to the lady and he says, "Now you know he's here, don't you?" &gt;&gt; Because he knew the presence. And all of a sudden, boom, he'd break into that other dimension. And he'd see what happened yesterday. He could look through time. He could see everything. And he'd tell them exactly what was on their hearts. What was he doing? It was the last sign of the Messiah. That that he was showing that he was come to the earth, that he was now a greater than Solomon was here. Who do you say this is? &gt;&gt; A greater than Solomon is here present with the sons and daughters of God to fulfill his promised word for that day. And here we are now 70 years later over 70 years later. What do you think is promised to you? &gt;&gt; What do you think is happening in your life? What was what what what what is it that that's called you? It's because you are a part of him. It's &gt;&gt; because there's something in you now in this dispensation just like it was in William Brandham's day. &gt;&gt; There's a portion of the word now in you &gt;&gt; that needs to come to life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That needs to express himself in the appointed time and season. Amen. Praise God. Forever more. And so I'm going to stop. I'm going to invite the musicians to come because next week we're going to finish and we're going to we're going to look at Revelations 10:es 1 to4 and then verses 5-7 and we're going to look at how the mighty angel descends and has come into this age into this hour into a a a time and a season of translation for the bride to receive Receive perfect faith for the change of dimension. We are in transition, saints. Everything will end with the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Everything. We're going to read some quotes next week that tells us that everything completes upon that seventh seal because it is the mystery of God &gt;&gt; being revealed &gt;&gt; to the church &gt;&gt; and to the world &gt;&gt; and everything will will move on. Everything will continue. And our walk with God is only going to get greater and greater. There's going to be revelation that is going to come that is continuing to to move us line upon line, precept upon precept. We cannot stay the same. There's a word for us that that that God has prepared for us today that we need to manifest, that we need to receive, that we need to believe, that we need to make our existence. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. That's what we're looking for. We're looking for that great change. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Father, we thank you this morning once again, Lord, for the word of God. that Lord we we realize that it takes your anointing and your spirit Lord to make it real to individual hearts and and to open the word in such a way where the hearts of the people oh God will will burn within them Lord it's a personal experience now Father like when you rose back from Calvary Lord and you made yourself known it was no longer a public ministry. It was a personal ministry, Lord, where you went one by one. You walked up to them while they walked on the road to Emmas. You made yourself known, personal. You made it real to them. You broke bread with them, Lord. You opened the word in such a way, Lord, that they realized who they were and the part that they were. Father, we're asking you to come and continue to unveil your word to each and every heart personal. Lord, as we move into the week that lays before us, there's many things that we must face the challenges of this life. Lord, won't you just let the reality of what was said here today that the Holy Ghost was given to us for that very purpose so that we could overcome those things. Help us to acknowledge you, Father, in every aspect of our lives. Draw us closer to you, Father. And let us know, Lord, greater is he that is within us than he that is in this world. We love you. We appreciate you. And we will never fail but to give you the glory in Jesus name. Amen. I'm ready to move. Amen. Ready to move. Ready to move. Glory to God.
