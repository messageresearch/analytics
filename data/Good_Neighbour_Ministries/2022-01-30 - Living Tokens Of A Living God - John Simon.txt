here we are together again yes here we are praising jesus and giving glory to his wonderful and marvelous name may the lord bless us as we gather together to magnify and glorify his great name thanks be unto god before i advance i would like to indicate to you or let you know of the crossing over of our sister hammond sister nelly hammond and the crossing over of our sister carol ramdan may the lord bless them they have received their total deliverance they have entered into the joys of their lord and into the freedom that only jesus christ can give they're broken the bars of death and sin they have dropped off the chains of earth and now they revel in the glory of god and rejoice with the millions of saints who have welcomed them into the very throne room of god may god rest their souls amen hallelujah we celebrate their lives we give god glory to have known them on earth and we shall meet them again for christians never die but we part but we will meet again god bless their hearts and be with their souls for today we would speak on the subject called living tokens of a living god now our scripture is found in second corinthians chapter 4 verses 3 to 7 but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world had blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of jesus christ who is the image of god should shine upon them for we preach not ourselves but je christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake for god who had commanded the light to shine out of darkness had shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us oh let us pray our righteous heavenly father we thank you for this wonderful time in your presence your children around your throne your children feeding upon your word we thank you lord for this blessing that was given to us for as you sent a prophet and he stored up food and now we can feed upon that stored up food lord hidden manna oh lamb of god that no many how no matter how many years may roll on the mana they show bread that was hidden behind the veil now comes into view by the power of the holy spirit and by the great revelation of god may you receive all glory honor and praise for we ask it in jesus name amen now from the wictionary not dictionary but the wictionary the word token is an object or thing serving as an expression of something else for example it may be a sign it may be a seal it may be a symbol but it is used to represent some distinguished person or thing it's also shown or displayed as a symbol of guarantee displayed as a symbol also of authority also a symbol of authenticity and of quality and of power this token or the word token can be also said to be a tally okay our brother william marion branham the great prophet of god of this the last church age has spoken on this subject of the token and he has spoken on it several times whether he named it that at the time or not you will find scattered about are bits pieces gems scattered everywhere but principally he spoke on this subject in the great anointed message called the token and again he spoke up on this message seal of god he spoke about what was the holy ghost given for and many others now you see brother branham being the prophet he saw the overall picture but in this sermon the token he was only allowed to speak on it to a certain point of view a limited amount of what he had to say there and the rest were left in different parts in the storehouse waiting for the elected sons of god those of whom he spoke sang they will see when it is time for them to see and i believe that r has come and the spirit of god be a record of that this wonderful time now today i want to show you that the attribute this is what i want you to see that the attribute that is in you the gene of god the germ that is in you in those of the elect of god is a token of god himself in the individual hallelujah in other words the germ the gene in you is a portion or a town of fire you see for the holy spirit himself is the token not a token but the token the supreme the great token for in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily and on the day when he gave up the ghost then he broke himself into species to come and live in man that the scripture might be fulfilled the habitation of god is with men thanks be to god and so friends a token a portion a peace or a part of god indwells the elected and as that being in them they can rejoice oh praise god now to make this a little clearer from man's point of view when many of us may remember or know about the good housekeeping seal and the good housekeeping seal of course was a token that spoke of authenticity it spoke my friends of a guarantee that the object that you were purchasing was authentic and it had the quality that it is supposed to have once it had the seal it tells you that that is an authentic object and when the believer of course has god's seal it proves they are authentic never mind what man says about it but what god says about it when he gives that elected individual his seal of authenticity and his seal of approval look at it again from this point of view i remember going into crowded spaces you may even be going into a crowded space you're well aware of what i'm speaking about here you'll go into a crowded space whether it be a wedding whether it be a banquet and in the winter quotes have to be taken and given to someone that will oversee them and when you give that individual your coat they will give you a ticket called a token you'll receive that ticket and it'll have numbers on it and they'll give you the other half so that when you return the ticket that you have must match the one that they have the numbers on it and then they're aware of ownership right then they're aware of ownership you will be the owner praise god hallelujah amen yes sir now when let's look at this that's man's point of view but when we look at it from god's point of view you see god's point of view the guarantee of a promise like the rainbow that was a token and here's a token given to us genesis 9 12-17 the blood in egypt that was placed on the doorpost that was just a sign a symbol a tape it was a token right it was the token to israel hey token to israel it was to them the token but in reality it was a symbol to them at that time amen praise god now what did this token represent it represented god's protection it represented god's identification god identifying them as his own so they should not be touched they should not be any way uh destroyed because they were under the token of the blood hallelujah and so today are we who are real believers also under the talk and blood of christ hallelujah the reality the real blood the real life we are under the protection of the blood hallelujah we're under my friends the wonderful presence of god that also is your supernatural identification of who you are hallelujah for the holy spirit himself has condescended and come down to identify his own and to protect his own hallelujah in the shadow of his wings amen yes this gene that is in the elected believer o praise god is a peace or a portion of god that is in you as a deposit as an earnest this is an earnest of our inheritance it's just a portion a peace of god in a token of god a living token of a living god living within the individual praise god paul puts it this way for we have a treasure within these written vessels praise god what treasure the gene the germ of god the token or praise god that dwells within you the riches of his grace and mercy dwells within you because it's god token in you and it will instruct you for the bible tells us i believe it's james for we have a token we have a witness he says you have a witness that witness is whom the holy spirit the token of god that is in you we are born before the foundation of the world before you are even born helen we are amen a portion of god dwells in you and that portion will witness to every word spoken to you every act done towards you everything that's around you oh that john that gene is a witness hallelujah and so it will teach you all things it will instruct you hallelujah amen and show you the things of god things that are going to be now what a marvelous type when we see that jesus christ our lord is our token today not blood of bulls and goats not the blood of some animal but the blood of our blessed lord jesus is our talking today and of course the blood is a token his blood of his life of the holy spirit praise god and we have a part of that wit in us we have a portion within us hallelujah the blood on the door when that dead angel came true hallelujah was the proof that a lamb had died or praised god so the blood was a token of identification amen and we have that token in us today that the precious lamb of god died for our sins took our place and the life that was upon him has come to earth again in the form of the holy spirit to rest upon us identify us as his own to protect us as we he walks with us so we have been given a token which of course that was a type of this the antitype hallelujah and back there they had a natural token now we have a supernatural token within our lives amen hallelujah and all those talking back there was foreshadowing this great supreme token that we have the earnest of our inheritance we have the holy spirit the supreme token in our hearts and buried within our lives hallelujah for the holy ghost is our token amen the holy ghost is our identification the holy ghost is our seal the holy ghost is our sign upon our hearts and lives amen oh praise god he it displays to god and to the world that we have accepted the death of the lord jesus thou dying lamb thy precious blood will never lose its power till all the ransom church of god are saved to sin no more blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah amen you see not only was jesus living a human life but it was god manifested in the flesh walking upon the earth hallelujah and when he came back on us that brought back brought to us the adoption of sons glory to god and now we are the sons and daughters of the living god by this overshadowing of the holy ghost by this adoption of the holy spirit is our identification that we believe god and god has accepted us because we believe him the bleeding word of god has bled and we allowed the blood to sprinkle itself upon us to become god's speckled bird of the hour the holy spirit resting upon our lives glory to god now let me go to this make this a little clearer listen to god's servant and prophet speaking the word listen now you remember here in america years ago the chinese brother that would uh come to my house to my mind when i was talking to him you see when they came they could not speak english they and they run laundries and you would go up to the laundry to get your laundry done you know how it was and they would take your laundry and at that time because they could not read and write what they would do is tear a bill or a piece of paper into two pieces and they will give you a half and they will keep the other part and when you return the piece you had had to perfectly fit what they had or you would not be able to pick up your clothing now what this chinese the chinese laundry man was doing they knew about the practice of their culture of tokens and they knew what a token was and this was not a simple statement by brother branham he just mentioned it and passed over and went on made the point and went on but regard what he's talking about here the two portions oh my and this is what the the mistake of many even in the message thinking that the holy spirit just comes down upon the individual and then fills them and then they are filled with him but listen my friends the deep calls to the deep and the deep must respond there must be a part of that laundry tag there must be a portion a token of god in you so that you may receive the rest of the token what am i talking about i can't expand on all these parts but think of it here is the wife here is the husband here is the body here comes the hit ship it's coming together another uniting time another oneness when the great spirit of the living god from spirit with spirit will meet all glory to god the holy spirit comes to meet that part of himself that is buried within the elected seed of the of the living god amen leaving tokens of a living god and god comes to meet that part of himself like adam met that part of himself glory to god the weaker part of himself but he met her praise god and together there were one amen amen praise be to god hallelujah amen listen or praise god that chinese laundry man would take attack tear it in a certain way when you bring it back he take the other part match them together when you come to claim your belongings see and if that did not dovetail just exactly right amen and because he had one piece amen but if that did then you got what belongs to you when you possess the other part the other part of the con contract hallelujah so one part of the track the gene is in you here comes the blessed holy spirit amen and he comes to the gene that is in you and when your the gene in you and the spirit connects and they contact when the deep crawls to the deep and the shepherd calls to his sheep they come together as one they see eye to eye anything he says they say amen everything he says they see it they understand it they have a revelation about it because they were born mad that way praise god by the blessed holy spirit being in them glory to god now you understand still here when god why and when god tore his son into two parts at calvary and taking the body up as a sacrifice and then sent back down the holy spirit to us that once lived in a man jesus amen the same god was in a veil praise god but now those two pieces has come back to come together then if it comes to you you are a part of the contract oh glory to god hallelujah amen you see god did this so that he would know man better when he made himself man amen so he come back to living human beings he come back to living man he come back on the earth again to reveal himself and live true man this my friends we understand that is what he's talking about in a nice way is the revealing of the son of man hallelujah in a bright form living in his people and the holy spirit projecting and reflecting the very lights of god the brightness and effulgence of the holy spirit flowing through their lives thrown through their hearts effortlessly by the power of god amen hallelujah amen then he spoke about a certain king who loved his people and he loved them so much that he told his ministers look i'm going to leave this throne take off my robes and i'm going down to live amongst them like a plain man because i love them and i want to know what they are going through and we thank god that jesus was a king like that and he is a king like that who changed himself from the jehovah god amen changed his form amen and came down and dwelt among us emmanuel god with us a man in our midst walking and talking a god man for it was god in a man hallelujah that he might test death that he might taste all these things wash the feet of the lawley that he could be a friend my friends to those that are in the streets tonight the cold winter's night on being out there sleeping in a city street under some cardboard he came down that he might know you that he might know what folk are going through a man and lay decide his scar his purple robe oh praise god he slept in the woods he slept in the rocks amen and he became one of us that he may understand us and be a high priest that can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities oh praise god now i want to quote from the mighty god unveiled before us now god in the beginning was life the eternal one in him was attributes and those attributes became words and them words the word became flesh you see that is why the scripture says the fullness of the godhead was in him godlily praise god like all we all my father's children were in him praise god until they become manifested and expressed they were in him and the bible tells us that we were in him praise god but there were words and those words make up the word amen and the word became flesh praise god amen see and jesus was the redeemer of what and let me say this he was the redeemer for the rest of the words amen hallelujah amen and to redeem means to bring back glory to god and to bring it back it had to be somewhere else for you to bring it back to where it was to begin with hallelujah and i take god with the lifting of spiritual amnesia we can recognize that we come from god and we're going back to god hallelujah and so he came to redeem us back to god hallelujah as the scripture says that he redeemed us unto himself glory to god amen so all people will never see this because all people wasn't in the beginning in the thoughts of god amen page 11 the mighty god unveiled before us you see i caught again all people will never be able to see it because all people was not in the beginning in god's thoughts oh let me show he says look at the priest amen he showed his nature he showed where it was from and called jesus the word beelzebub call him other names you see he was proving where he come from who he was but look at the little prostitute when jesus came to her she first of all that seed that germ began to open up and it opened up until she said when messiah comes he will do these things and jesus said i that speak to thee am he glory to god watch them two tags come together watch them two tokens come together the supreme talking and the living token of from a living god inside of a prostitute and yet it was a daughter of god a child of the king hallelujah and the holy spirit exposed the priest and redeemed the prostitute back to god where she came from hallelujah i thank god for the blessed holy spirit and the unveiling of god in this hour not the unveiling of god back there but the unveiling of this bride the revealing of the son of man god making himself known in this day in this time and in this hour by the blessed holy spirit praise god amen oh praise god thank god he has rent the veil i've spoken few weeks ago on the subject of inside and outside if you're inside you're seeing everything inside if you're outside you can't see anything we spoke on the pulling back the veil and how he pulled the veil back there when he was crucified on calvary veil of the temple was renting twain or praise god god pulled back the veil just as he's told brother branham that you pull back the veil now oh praise god and the prophet pulled back the veil and now we can enter in we look at the word and we see the unveiling of the word the revealing of the word of the living god in this day and in this hour praise god oh praise god listen i quote now page 31 mighty god unveil before us think of it god the god of heaven unfolding himself making himself known the great king of glory let them fall down in the hearts of people that we might see this unveiled one the one who came down and rent the veil of the temple then went right behind right out of that veil and come right down into this veil into human veils again on the day of pentecost and it has ever been the same edge the edge changing from glory unto glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord friends so we see the deep calls to the deep and the deep must respond praise god the germ the gene calls our father and the holy spirit comes upon it amen and the two tags meet the two tokens meet hallelujah amen praise god of course we know the token is a seal it could be as the prophet said your boss talking your boss talking or it could be your plane ticket to ride in the skies or glory to god but we look at it now from the point of view that the token is the token in the believer is the believer's identification hallelujah it's the identification that you are under the king's protection because back in the old days the king would give a certain person a ring or give them a badge or give them some some little trinket and whenever anyone would see that they will dare not touch that person they were identified oh hallelujah they were protected amen and the death angel knew that and knows that that once you are under that seal that token of the living god amen you are not to be touched the devil knows it you are not to be touched you are protected because you're under the cover ring wings of the blood of jesus christ hallelujah amen hallelujah that blood the lamb's blood identifies you just as a natural life it identifies who really is your father glory to god hallelujah that little portion that tag in you it identifies your family origins of where you come from and where you are going going to also that's that token tells of your ownership who owns you amen thank god that the token shows your ownership and you are a living token of a living god hallelujah the god lives in you praise god and he's showing and identifying himself that he lives within you praise be to god amen that token also reveals the believers rank position in the world it reveals that you're of noble birth kings and priests to the living god in the olden days they would wear the token in various ways in some cultures it was a badge in other places it was a uh a sash that there wore across their body in some cultures it was a piece of the token was a piece of board or or or a metal or stone hanging on a string at their side and it told of their birth their their social status it told of their rank it spoke my friends of all these things praise god and certain uniforms and when you have on you the real token of god amen i tell you my friends there it identifies you every devil will know who you are without you having to say one word because you're a living token of the presence of the living god amen hallelujah amen of course as i've said before the token is a token of certification it's a token my friends that you're a certified son a certified seed son that you might my child my daughter in christ all my sons and daughters in christ to recognize that you are certified authenticated sons and daughters of god not by you saying it but because you already come you had nothing to do with it but in you was the deposit in you was the supreme treasure oh praise god hallelujah so when this r came then we find oh the great ego he's looking for his own where is that gene where is that attribute where is that germ he's searching for his children oh praise god and this is the hour when that is now going on it's now in progress seeking for you seeking for me yes he's seeking for me oh my out in the desert he's seeking out in the cities he's seeking he's searching to find his own wherever that germ that gene that seed is buried oh said he'll not leave one but every one he holds them in his hand o praise god hallelujah you're a sealed daughter of god sealed son of the living god amen or praise god when a message in those olden days was sent with a messenger by the king or was sent by a general or one of nobility in a very high possession the person bearing the message had to have a token and the king knew that when the person that was to receive the message when the messenger got there that that person would recognize that token hallelujah because the king would have shown it to them before so that when they see it again but now it's in the hands of a messenger they will recognize the token and that is what the elected seed of god have done we have recognized the messenger with the message from the king of glory speaking to our hearts to our souls amen we recognize it because the deep calls to the deep not for healing not for discernment but it's calling for the third pull the great magnet has come down and pulling and drawing his sons and daughters unto himself oh thank god for the living tokens of today living tokens sparks off the anvil pieces and portions of the holy spirit towns of fire hallelujah amen oh glory to god hallelujah amen oh praise god you have to have a talking to receive the message in certain situations when the king sent a messenger he would break a seal one of his seal he will break one of his seals and give a half the messenger and the other half would be given to that general that spy or that nobility that he wanted to receive that message so when the messenger got there to that person he would not deliver that message he'll just tell them i have a message i must deliver this message it is a supernatural message it's a wonderful message hallelujah but he really cannot give that message to that person because the very message that he has it's sealed he's only the bearer of the message but if the one to whom he brings that message has the other tag or the other piece of the king seal that the two of them will match it together and when they're fit he'll just hand over the message to that person's keeping oh praise god aren't you glad that god placed that gene in you knowing that he was going to send a messenger with this word for this hour and that when the word got here it will fit your gene your soul like a hand in a glove you'll recognize that it's thus saith the lord you'll recognize that it's the word of the living god hallelujah thank god that the prophet talking came to the elected tokens of god the believing elected living tokens of a living god and his message match oh praise god we can shout glory we can shout hallelujah oh my thank god forevermore amen you have to have a token before you can really receive this message anyone can pick it up read it hold it in their hands talk about it explain it expound it analyze it debate it turn it back and forth and everywhere the devil is always there to peep and mutter and sneak and try to find what's behind what's under the seals and everything else and all he will get my friends is the rima of the world all he'll get my friends is that part of it but the real logos that only comes to god's elected few and they must have that part of the gene within them so what when the holy spirit anoints the word from the prophet's lips glory to god the message opens up hallelujah it expounds and explains itself reveals itself and makes itself known to his beloved bride hallelujah yes amen a token hallelujah and then we find friends that god has given tokens of power to his elected tokens of power moses had won god said god down how were they going to know and god like a great heavenly king he gave him a token he says what is that in your hand and he said a rod you know the rest of the story that is why he could stand up there by the river banks hallelujah and raise that rod and watched the red sea rolled back away from him because the i am was in him oh praise god a portion of god was in him and that rod as a symbol of that token he stood there as a living token of a living god exercising the power of a living token amen hallelujah watch elijah and elijah's robe and he dropped it back to elijah it was a token of his power or the power that was in his life which was god himself and that power that was on elijah came to elijah and it had to fit him hallelujah he had to have something in him for that to fit praise god and all he picked it up and displayed the power and the presence and the message of the living god oh in the book of acts the bible tells us how that the shadow peter passing and his shadow fell on the people and they were healed what was it it's the power of the token that was in peter's life and it tells us how handkerchiefs came from the body of paul and when they went out there were tokens of power tokens of god's presence hallelujah the devil knew it that's why he got up and fled oh my for it was a token god lives in the individual god lives in the person oh praise god forevermore and so my friends all of the living tokens display the power and the glory of the supreme token the holy spirit amen hallelujah and all the living tokens genes of god down through all the seven church ages is what we see make up god's entire pyramid amen and now the king token the god token the holy ghost himself amen has come down to cap off their lies by sitting on the pyramid oh and it fits amen the prophet said it's not just a capstone it's a keystone because of the back bottom of the cap zone there is some kind of a key that must fit into this other part and when they come together hallelujah and settles together oh the union the invisible union oneness praise god the presence of almighty god i want to thank god that the holy spirit is here with us and that we are the living tokens of god for today and for the glory of god amen oh my thank god god gave give his token as kings gave their tokens for rapture for glorification amen for rescue for redemption for glorification often times a king if he found that he had lost a son amen and didn't know where he was then he would send servants out to go search and that person you'll find them they're wearing a chain with a disc on it and you'll describe it to them and the person doesn't know the value the worth or the importance or implication of what they're wearing but the messengers will go out and search and when they find that person oh it's a revelation to them that they're not really a commoner they're a king they're they're not a papa they're a prince with god they begin to find out things about themselves that they never knew just because of this token that they had oh and we find things about ourselves because of the token of god that is in us praise god hallelujah you remember the slave that was down in the deep south hallelujah oh his father far across the sea but you know what all of them knew that he was a son of a king amen and if that father could send his fleet ah they would come and discover him and take him back where he come from glory to god the great eagle flying over the barnyard looking for what her son her daughter her children and when she sees them and they scream something in in her and in them matches it fits together hallelujah the language is the same oh praise god and once that is done she knows them and she wants to take them home away amen redemption by recognition of the germ in you the gene that is in your soul hallelujah and he unveils you by coming to you and making himself known to you glorifying god and making god real as he ever was in your life before oh praise god hallelujah i believe my friends the great holy spirit is now not only asking if you have the token but are you applying the token are you manifesting and expressing the token so that you may be recognized by the world that you are one of the living tokens of a living god may god bless you and if you're wondering what are you talking about what is this go search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life go search what you have heard and let the spirit of god teach you for you have a witness you have a germa gene if you're a son or daughter of god and the spirit himself will comfort you guide you teach you and lead you and walk you right into eternal life and into the presence of god god watch between us god keep us preserve us pray for me as i pray for you that we will grow in his holy spirit growing wisdom and an understanding that the word of god will unfold itself day after day week after week to god be the glory may he be honored now and forevermore in jesus name amen god bless you my friends [Music] you
