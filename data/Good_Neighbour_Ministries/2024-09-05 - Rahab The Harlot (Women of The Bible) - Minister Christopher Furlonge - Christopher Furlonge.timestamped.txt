[33:03] them because she already has some faith
[33:07] and Revelation that is been building up
[33:10] inside of her amen just so when you

[38:52] Army imagine that so that must be
[38:55] bringing Terror on them people
[38:58] they thought that they were well
[39:00] fortified I believe I heard I think the
[39:03] the the walls of Jericho were like I
[39:05] think were 20 or 30 ft wide that
[39:08] chariots could have ride around and the
[39:10] walls were so high that nobody could
[39:12] just actually climb them or attack them
[39:15] just like that without they being
[39:17] destroyed they believed that they were
[39:20] well fortified amen and well protected
[39:24] by all the walls that they have amen but
[39:27] they fail to recognize and realize that
[39:30] there is a a a a a a a nation a people
[39:35] whose God is on their side and nothing
[39:38] is impossible with
[39:41] them Hallelujah nothing is impossible

[1:05:29] not with them that believe not when she
[1:05:34] had received the spies with peace she
[1:05:39] was counted with all the great and left
[1:05:44] as a
[1:05:46] legacy that we can look back and
[1:05:50] know it's it's no matter what your
[1:05:54] condition is right now now no matter

[1:06:30] scarlet cord amen amen hallelujah you
[1:06:34] see how they all was saved amen now
[1:06:38] remember all the walls of Jericho fell
[1:06:43] except her
[1:06:47] who you we talk about America every
[1:06:50] stone as the brother said over the
[1:06:52] weekend here every stone wrong fell and
[1:06:57] if you go to Jericho and a trip to
[1:06:59] Israel anytime you're going to see it
[1:07:03] man flattened they're still there the
[1:07:05] ruins are still there they never built
[1:07:08] it back man hallelujah praise
[1:07:13] God and she had to live somewhere else
[1:07:17] amen because if we go to I
[1:07:23] believe in Joshua chapter
[1:07:29] 7 22 oh 6 sorry
[1:07:34] 622
[1:07:40] man
[1:07:42] Hallelujah but Joshua had said unto the
[1:07:45] two men that had spied out the country
[1:07:50] go into the hot's house and bring out
[1:07:53] then the woman and all that she had as
[1:07:58] ye swear unto
[1:08:02] her man now just before that Joshua sent
[1:08:06] in his army and utterly destroyed man
[1:08:10] woman and beasts
[1:08:13] everything destroyed everything amen
[1:08:17] except
[1:08:18] her amen hallelujah and we goes to verse
[1:08:22] 23 and the young men that were spies
[1:08:25] went
[1:08:26] and brought out Rahab and her father and
[1:08:30] her mother and her Brethren and all that
[1:08:34] she had and they brought out all her
[1:08:37] Kindred and left them without the camp
[1:08:41] of Israel so here we see she went to
[1:08:45] Israel to live with the
[1:08:48] Israelites amen
[1:08:50] hallelujah but you know the story still
[1:08:52] end
[1:08:54] there man
[1:08:56] the stories still did not end there
[1:09:01] man now as we said all the the walls of
[1:09:03] Jericho fell and she needed somewhere to
[1:09:05] go live
[1:09:07] right and we see her when she was taken
[1:09:10] in as one of the Israelites she
[1:09:13] encountered a man from
[1:09:17] Israel and fell in love with this
[1:09:21] man my my my who was a captain
[1:09:25] of the prince of Judah he was the
[1:09:30] captain of the Israelite armies and his
[1:09:34] name was
[1:09:36] Salomon very similar in pronunciation to
[1:09:42] Solomon and when the estate was settled
[1:09:45] up for the Israelites she and her
[1:09:48] beloved husband lived in
[1:09:51] Bethlehem now we see a connection now
[1:09:54] here is where the Gentiles were
[1:09:58] introduced into
[1:10:00] Israel and by you know who by a
[1:10:04] harlot a
[1:10:06] prostitute my Hallelujah we all were
[1:10:10] Harlot and prostitute to the word of the
[1:10:12] Lord and thank God that he grafted Us in
[1:10:15] and brought us in thank you Lord
[1:10:17] hallelujah amen praise God and now when
[1:10:22] we go to Matthew 1:5 which a lot of us
[1:10:26] like to skip and read over that quick
[1:10:30] the generations you know as this one beg
[1:10:34] got this one beg got beg got beg beg got
[1:10:36] amen we like to pass that
[1:10:38] fast but when we go to verse five Amen
[1:10:43] in Matthew chapter 1 again we see her
[1:10:46] name is mentioned
[1:10:48] here
[1:10:51] amen and here is the generations leading
[1:10:54] up to
[1:10:56] Jesus they had a son boas but now
[1:11:00] remember this woman was a
[1:11:02] prostitute and she wore with many many
[1:11:06] men and there is no record that she had
[1:11:09] a child
[1:11:12] before so what we saying here God had to
[1:11:15] be
[1:11:16] protecting that
[1:11:19] seed that
[1:11:21] lineage my what a God we ser
[1:11:25] my my and here She is again they had a
[1:11:31] son
[1:11:33] Boaz which brought another Gentile
[1:11:37] inen Hallelujah and then Boaz became
[1:11:42] become Jesse and Jesse was born to David
[1:11:45] and David right on here as the same
[1:11:48] little bethleem was anointed by the
[1:11:51] prophet of God and through that Lan AG
[1:11:56] you mean the Lord Jesus Christ had to
[1:11:57] come through
[1:12:00] that just showing you how God my is rich
[1:12:07] in
[1:12:09] Mercy had to use amen a harot amen
[1:12:14] through the generations to come by amen
[1:12:18] hallelujah what else just think about it
[1:12:22] just think about that sh we shouldn't be
[1:12:26] no proud of
[1:12:27] nothing the great almighty God creator
[1:12:31] of Heaven and Earth came down through
[1:12:33] that
[1:12:34] lineage to show us listen listen no
[1:12:37] matter where you at there is hope for
[1:12:40] you there's Mercy for you there's grace
[1:12:44] extended towards you hallelujah
[1:12:49] amen praise God now and again it doesn't
[1:12:53] end there you we see again appearing in
[1:12:58] James chapter 2
[1:13:02] verse4 I believe
[1:13:04] amen 14 um verse
[1:13:10] 25 likewise
[1:13:12] also was not Rahab the Harlot and you
[1:13:17] know something every time we mention you
[1:13:20] see her name you you see the word Harlot
[1:13:22] attached to it there's a reason for that
[1:13:26] there is a reason for that God placed
[1:13:29] that in the
[1:13:30] scripture there that there is nobody is
[1:13:34] counted out no one no one is counted out
[1:13:38] so no matter if you sin be as

[1:14:02] justified by works when she had received
[1:14:06] the messenges and had sent them out
[1:14:08] another way you see you
[1:14:12] cannot do something for a son or
[1:14:15] daughter of God without being
[1:14:20] rewarded you say if you give a him a cup
[1:14:23] of water to one of these one you have a

[1:15:40] ahead but in the Bible it
[1:15:43] is representing
[1:15:47] Redemption it's a
[1:15:49] covering it's an
[1:15:52] atonement red means safe

[1:16:06] safety always safety on the
[1:16:10] red the blood is
