[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] dear friends
[0:17] once again i am so
[0:20] happy to be here with you
[0:24] to share the bread of life
[0:29] this word of god given to us
[0:32] we thank him for his grace and mercy
[0:39] this lesson from the seven church ages
[0:44] will be mainly introducing
[0:49] nimrod as mentioned
[0:53] in the bible and the reason why
[0:57] is because nimrod is
[1:00] closely associated with the origins
[1:05] or the beginnings of the
[1:09] trinitarian doctrine
[1:12] teaching of the trinity
[1:16] where it came from how
[1:19] how it originated and
[1:22] later we will touch on how it got here
[1:25] today
[1:27] but i will be brief
[1:30] tonight and next
[1:33] wednesday we will
[1:36] take up the life of nimrod
[1:40] of which we will speak
[1:44] now today is a topic
[1:47] i would like to entitle
[1:52] antiquity nimrod
[1:55] and the trinity
[1:59] our scripture reading is in genesis
[2:02] chapter
[2:02] 10 verses 8
[2:05] to 10. let us read our bibles
[2:13] genesis 10
[2:17] verses 8 to 10.
[2:21] this is a study of the word of god
[2:29] and cush begot
[2:32] nimrod
[2:35] and he began to be a mighty one
[2:41] in the earth
[2:44] he was a mighty hunter
[2:48] before the lord
[2:51] wherefore it is said even
[2:54] as nimrod the mighty hunter
[2:59] before the lord and the
[3:02] beginning of his kingdom
[3:07] was babel
[3:12] and eric and
[3:15] akad and kalne
[3:19] in the land of shinar
[3:24] god's blessing be upon his word
[3:29] and upon his people his word we know
[3:32] is already blessed but we ask for a
[3:36] refreshing of the holy spirit
[3:40] in teaching us the word of god
[3:43] this we thank you for father
[3:47] giving you all the glory honor and
[3:48] praise
[3:50] in jesus name amen
[3:56] now we ended our last
[4:00] talk speaking about how
[4:04] satan became the god of this
[4:08] world of course we know that
[4:11] satan has many names
[4:16] the god of this world god of this evil
[4:19] age
[4:21] the prince of darkness and so on
[4:25] so he has many names many descriptions
[4:31] and how that he buying his
[4:34] lies in heaven was kicked out
[4:39] upon the earth and then when he came to
[4:42] earth he continued
[4:45] his his uh lies rumors
[4:50] of deception duplicity
[4:54] and exacted created an
[4:57] atmosphere where he
[5:01] demanded worship or coerced
[5:04] or seduced people
[5:08] into worshipping him
[5:11] as god and there here
[5:15] we want to pick up this fact
[5:19] that polytheistic religion or religions
[5:23] that believe in many gods
[5:28] begin with the trinitarian
[5:32] doctrine the trinitarian doctrine
[5:37] is the basis for polytheistic
[5:40] religions within this this world
[5:44] today because
[5:47] way back in antiquity
[5:50] is where this belief
[5:54] and teaching of one god
[5:58] in three persons found
[6:01] itself being spread
[6:06] across the world and in the minds of
[6:09] those
[6:10] that were there at that time
[6:14] it's very strange that our modern
[6:18] day theologians
[6:21] who think of themselves as
[6:24] men of acute intelligence
[6:27] and mental dexterity have
[6:30] lost sight of this fact
[6:35] that the trinitarian doctrine
[6:39] way back in antiquity was the very
[6:43] foundation for polytheistic
[6:47] religion it seems as if just as satan
[6:52] duke the people way back in the
[6:55] antiquities
[6:56] in the ancient times
[7:00] it seems as he has duped our
[7:04] procession of uh
[7:07] theologians and wise men
[7:10] of this day until they have lost sight
[7:15] of the word of god that is so plain and
[7:19] simple to those who would believe
[7:25] just imagine intelligent people
[7:29] wise people believing the
[7:33] doctrine of three persons
[7:37] in the godhead
[7:41] and there's no scripture for it let me
[7:45] give you
[7:45] references to various parts of of
[7:48] of the especially of the new testament
[7:52] where they would allude uh or suggest
[7:57] that fact which has
[8:00] no standing anywhere in the word of god
[8:05] for god never changes his mind about his
[8:08] word
[8:10] and when he said to israel hero israel
[8:14] the lord thy god is
[8:17] one lord he never said the lord thy god
[8:21] is
[8:21] tree the lord thy god is for
[8:24] the lord i got no the lord thy
[8:28] god is one lord there's only one god he
[8:32] said and beside me
[8:34] there is no other not behind not before
[8:38] not beside
[8:40] just one god and he always proclaims
[8:44] himself
[8:45] that way and saying i the lord thy
[8:48] god i'm a jealous god
[8:51] hallelujah thanks be to god
[8:56] now it's very strange
[8:59] that the descendants of him
[9:04] went the way of satanic worship
[9:09] but the descendants of shem
[9:14] kept the belief and the faith
[9:18] from the time of adam and eve
[9:22] and abel who caught the revelation
[9:26] that the lord god of heaven is one lord
[9:32] and they have to this day
[9:36] the semitic peoples have maintained the
[9:40] fact
[9:41] in line with the word of god
[9:45] historically antiquity to modern times
[9:50] one lord one god of heaven and earth
[9:55] eternal on the present immutable
[9:59] o praise god we serve one great and
[10:03] eternal
[10:04] heavenly father and we give him praise
[10:07] and
[10:07] thanks for this fact hallelujah
[10:11] now remember the israelites as i've said
[10:16] have never wandered away from
[10:20] this belief of one god
[10:25] putting it through the ages they stumble
[10:27] this way that way but they're
[10:28] always on track for one
[10:32] god like you are i in our spiritual walk
[10:36] we're walking with god and we may
[10:38] stumble here we stumble there
[10:39] but the main uh the main trajectory of
[10:44] our walk
[10:45] is in line with the word
[10:48] of the living god they have never
[10:52] believed
[10:54] in three persons being
[10:57] in one god and abraham
[11:01] who came from the very plains of
[11:04] shinar came from the very
[11:08] area that nimrod rose up
[11:11] in which was like a center
[11:14] of false god carbs gods rock
[11:18] gods sculptured gods architecturally
[11:21] beautiful uh wonderful gods
[11:25] admirable to their eyes but we're
[11:28] talking about
[11:29] an eternal spirit being god
[11:32] that appeals and speaks to your heart
[11:36] to your life to your soul and you
[11:39] recognize it hallelujah thanks be to god
[11:43] amen in the bible genesis
[11:46] 18 abraham
[11:50] saw the lord coming up the road
[11:54] two angels with him
[11:57] and when abraham looked he did not say
[12:02] my lords plural
[12:06] he said my lord amen
[12:10] my lord hallelujah
[12:13] just as much as thomas would say my
[12:16] lord and my god in the new testament
[12:21] one god and his name is jesus christ
[12:26] abraham saw three
[12:29] persons coming towards him but he only
[12:33] recognized
[12:34] one god hallelujah
[12:38] now we know that the trinity
[12:43] in from the time of antiquity
[12:46] has been expressed in the form of an
[12:51] equatorial triangle
[12:54] a triangle with equal signs
[12:58] just as it is expressed in
[13:02] rome today we see that
[13:06] the hebrews or the semitic people have
[13:09] no such concept
[13:11] none whatsoever
[13:15] now who is right one god
[13:18] or three gods in one person
[13:22] who is right about it the hebrews
[13:26] or the babylonians who is actually right
[13:30] see now we know
[13:34] that in asia this polytheistic
[13:37] idea of three gods
[13:41] in one came out
[13:44] into the image of
[13:48] three heads on one body
[13:53] a god with three heads on one body
[13:56] now you can see later on from that came
[13:59] one body and then a whole bunch of heads
[14:03] or a whole bunch of arms or a whole
[14:06] bunch of feet
[14:07] coming out of that one body
[14:10] but it began with three
[14:14] heads on one
[14:17] body and was expressed
[14:21] as three intelligences
[14:25] to this one body
[14:29] later in india
[14:33] they found it in their hearts and in
[14:36] their teaching to express
[14:40] this god also in the form
[14:45] of a body with three
[14:49] heads and later on
[14:52] evoluted to three forms
[14:57] not only three heads but now three
[15:00] different forms see
[15:03] now we see that real good today we match
[15:05] it up with modern day
[15:07] so-called theology in japan there was
[15:13] a buddha with three
[15:16] heads on it like
[15:20] what we described earlier as we began
[15:24] speaking here and
[15:27] it all sets forth the trinitarian
[15:30] concept for it is not faith it is
[15:34] not the word it is not what we
[15:37] teach it is not in the bible
[15:40] it was never sent forth or
[15:44] revealed or made known by god
[15:47] these so-called uh claims of
[15:50] of saints and so-called claims of
[15:53] people having visions of that nature
[15:56] it's
[15:57] absolutely maybe they did have it
[16:00] but it's absolutely contrary to the
[16:03] word and voice of god for this day
[16:07] and for this hour
[16:11] now this trinitarian concept
[16:15] was first set forth as the head
[16:19] of an old man
[16:22] symbolizing the head of the father
[16:28] and around him
[16:31] or after him a great circle with a dot
[16:36] in the middle
[16:38] representing the seed or the sun
[16:42] from that father and then
[16:46] thirdly we see the
[16:49] wings and tails
[16:52] of a bird right
[16:56] and that was their doctrine
[16:59] of father son and
[17:03] holy ghost i hope you're taking some
[17:06] notes i hope you're writing down
[17:07] some things that you are hearing
[17:10] hopefully
[17:11] it will speak to you if not now
[17:14] but later on as you consider them
[17:19] and here was their doctrine
[17:23] a father son and holy ghost
[17:27] three persons in the godhead
[17:31] which they began to call
[17:34] the trinity
[17:37] now you can go to rome even today
[17:41] now and you will see
[17:44] some of the same things
[17:48] portrayed right before you
[17:52] it's strange how strange would it be
[17:57] that devil worshipers
[18:00] got the revelation of who god was
[18:04] before the patriarchs
[18:08] that they were teaching in babylon babel
[18:13] three persons in one god
[18:18] think of it before abraham
[18:21] the father of the faithful
[18:26] devil worshipers were propounding
[18:30] these teachings of three
[18:33] persons in the godhead
[18:38] but the moment god called abraham out of
[18:41] china
[18:42] out of that idolatrous background
[18:45] called him to himself all that abraham
[18:48] could see
[18:49] was one god
[18:54] now my friends
[18:57] it seems from what i've been saying
[19:01] uh it satan tried to pro uh uh
[19:04] propound the fact that the devil
[19:07] worshipers
[19:08] knew more about god than the real
[19:12] patriarchs and prophet did
[19:16] and so just like modern theologians
[19:19] today
[19:21] they propound and talk a lot about their
[19:25] trinitarian doctrine with such authority
[19:29] that you would think it is in the bible
[19:32] but it is
[19:32] not the bible they'll tell you about
[19:35] three
[19:36] lights tree grapes trees this three that
[19:40] they're trying to propound the twisted
[19:42] perverted every possible way
[19:44] but the bible remains the same
[19:48] hero israel the lord thy god is one lord
[19:51] true
[19:52] spiritual israel still believes hero
[19:55] israel the lord thy god is one lord
[19:59] there is no other but jesus christ
[20:03] jehovah of the old testament
[20:06] is now the same jesus of the
[20:09] new testament for the name jesus means
[20:13] jehovah has now become our savior
[20:18] jehovah is now our savior
[20:22] now we know from the scriptures
[20:25] that satan is the biggest liar there is
[20:31] but the bible calls him the father
[20:35] of all lies that's why the bible tells
[20:38] us
[20:38] the satan and all the liars
[20:42] and the lying will be placed into the
[20:45] pit of hell
[20:47] for lying is darkness
[20:50] truth is the light
[20:53] you see but satan takes his darkness
[20:56] and calls that light he'll tell you
[21:00] join this organization you'll get
[21:04] secret knowledge that will give you
[21:07] light it'll give you light
[21:10] but you see the light that he will give
[21:14] so-called light is really darkness
[21:19] because he's a murderer to begin with
[21:23] and his doctrine of the trinity what has
[21:25] it done
[21:27] destroyed multitudes
[21:30] millions warring in the name
[21:34] of christianity which is not real
[21:36] christianity
[21:38] but paganism hiding
[21:41] under the cloak of christianity
[21:44] perpetrating crimes until their lips
[21:49] and their hands are dripping with blood
[21:54] oh my friends look to the word of god
[21:58] look to the lamb of god who taketh away
[22:02] the sins of the world amen
[22:06] it didn't take very long
[22:10] that this concept of father son
[22:13] and holy ghost
[22:16] to expand because satan took it
[22:20] one step further and moved the people
[22:25] away from the truth
[22:29] and began to push the fact
[22:35] of there being one
[22:38] eternal father
[22:42] and the spirit of god
[22:45] now incarnate in a human
[22:49] mother now think of it brother sister
[22:56] and then a divine son
[23:00] the fruit of that incar carnation
[23:05] the woman's seed and then began to
[23:10] propound that or teach that
[23:14] as the proof or foundations
[23:18] for the doctrine of the trinity
[23:22] but the devil was not content right
[23:24] there
[23:25] you see he wanted to bring the worship
[23:28] to himself and so he began in an
[23:32] indirect way to pull the worship
[23:36] away from god and so
[23:40] he takes the people further and further
[23:44] away from the truth
[23:48] and through his so-called
[23:51] mysteries you'll find that they
[23:54] talk a lot about the their so-called
[23:57] mysteries
[23:58] so he began to reveal to them that god
[24:02] himself
[24:03] is a mystery and that he is an invisible
[24:08] father god he's a silent
[24:11] god who stays in the background
[24:14] and doesn't say anything to his people
[24:19] or get involved in the affairs of men
[24:23] and remains silent all the time
[24:28] actually that was his way
[24:32] of trying to get the people to now begin
[24:35] to ignore god
[24:38] to ignore the true and living god
[24:41] by claiming that god is silent
[24:45] yes and it saw then we see
[24:50] he began to propound
[24:53] these teachings of meditation
[24:58] and these religions
[25:02] that base themselves on meditations
[25:07] unknowingly to them it's really
[25:10] satan's trick
[25:14] to get them further away
[25:17] from the true and the living god
[25:20] now look just look at the word god god
[25:23] meaning object of worship
[25:25] everybody will say god even the devil
[25:29] believes there's a god only the fool
[25:32] doesn't believe there is a god but the
[25:35] devil
[25:36] so much believe it that he trembles so
[25:39] don't be tricked by the devil religious
[25:43] person some holy man
[25:46] some high and mighty elevated person
[25:49] in this modern world that constantly
[25:52] uses
[25:53] the word god i believe in god
[25:56] and god is good and god is great and
[25:59] which god are you talking about there is
[26:03] only
[26:04] one god now you begin to nail it down
[26:07] which god are you talking about
[26:09] that's why it tells you clearly the
[26:12] devils believe and tremble but they do
[26:16] not believe that jesus
[26:17] christ has come in the flesh
[26:22] again and here amongst this people
[26:26] god in flesh appearing
[26:29] in his people through his people
[26:34] the same yesterday today and forever
[26:38] glory to god hallelujah
[26:42] so since he
[26:45] began that lie that god is silent
[26:49] god is in the background god doesn't
[26:51] want to be bothered with you
[26:54] now he's encouraging the people to
[26:57] ignore god and to draw
[27:00] back from the living god so since you
[27:04] couldn't
[27:05] you shouldn't worship that silent god
[27:08] the next way he could take your
[27:11] attention
[27:12] is away from that to the
[27:15] mother with the sun
[27:19] in her so the worship
[27:23] of the woman began
[27:26] woman worship began
[27:31] drawing away the attention of the people
[27:34] from the mastery of the word
[27:37] from the father god
[27:41] to the mother god or mother
[27:44] of god i don't see how that's even
[27:48] um sensible
[27:51] it doesn't make any sense whatsoever
[27:54] god the being without beginning without
[27:58] ending and then he had a mother
[28:01] and if he has a mother then the mother
[28:03] was before him
[28:05] and that's what the devil is actually
[28:07] teaching the people
[28:08] and they're not realizing it it's not
[28:12] the
[28:12] mother is god or mother of god
[28:16] that's a lie for god has no
[28:20] mother god is god he stands alone
[28:24] hallelujah he just used
[28:27] mary's body to
[28:30] manifest the flesh into which he was
[28:34] going to step
[28:35] into and because he created that flesh
[28:39] he called it his son
[28:43] god was in christ reconciling the world
[28:46] to himself
[28:48] hallelujah listen to it again god
[28:52] was in christ reconciling the world to
[28:56] himself one god
[28:59] the eternal being manifest
[29:02] within the son no mother of god
[29:06] god has no mother amen he has
[29:10] no father no beginning nor ending
[29:13] he is all in all he is the
[29:16] i am not i was i'm going to be but the
[29:21] i am amen glory to god
[29:25] hallelujah now i'm trying to
[29:28] show you from these church ages
[29:34] exactly the prophet of god
[29:37] taught it clearly how the devil tried to
[29:41] seduce the people away
[29:44] from the belief and faith
[29:47] into one god and so
[29:51] the worship move to the mother
[29:54] and child where we get all these
[29:58] songs and so on mother and child
[30:01] reunions this that the other
[30:03] uh everything else they're praising the
[30:07] woman
[30:08] uh mary rather than praising god
[30:11] giving him the glory an honor to his
[30:14] name the devil switch
[30:16] completely until that's what the people
[30:20] are doing adoration
[30:22] of mary adoration of the woman
[30:26] rather than worship and adoration to god
[30:29] so
[30:30] we all we also do that yes my friends
[30:33] but we know that that's an aversion and
[30:36] that
[30:37] is absolutely a lie now in egypt
[30:42] this same mother and son combination
[30:46] belief was called
[30:49] isis and orsis
[30:52] let me repeat isis and horses
[30:56] in india it was called
[31:01] ishi and ishwara
[31:05] very close same thing justice spread
[31:09] acro across
[31:10] countries and cultures
[31:13] and in asia it was called
[31:18] sibil c y
[31:21] b e l e
[31:25] and d aussies there it is
[31:30] of course rome and greece
[31:34] followed suit they followed along with
[31:37] it
[31:39] now in china also
[31:43] the catholic missionaries
[31:47] were shocked when they went
[31:50] into china
[31:54] and there in china
[31:57] they found a mud runner and child
[32:04] with rays of light
[32:07] emitting from the head of the baby and
[32:10] no christian had ever gone to china
[32:14] but it was a madonna and child
[32:20] with the buddha and they were shocked
[32:24] about it
[32:25] now you can understand how certain
[32:27] religions can fit into
[32:28] almost any other religion because they
[32:31] basically at the
[32:33] back of it all they actually have one
[32:36] thing they believe in many gods
[32:40] whether it's three whether it's three
[32:41] million or or 30 million
[32:44] is still a belief a polyistic
[32:48] belief when we believe according to
[32:52] this bible and the scriptures that there
[32:55] is only
[32:56] one god amen
[32:59] yes must have been shocking to them they
[33:02] go with their beads and
[33:03] and they and the buddhists shaolin
[33:06] priests
[33:07] already have beats they go with their
[33:10] prayer beats the priests already had
[33:12] their
[33:12] prayer beats whatever they had those
[33:15] priests had it already
[33:17] because that belief was spread
[33:20] that satan made sure this belief in
[33:24] many gods was spread
[33:27] in various parts of the earth
[33:32] and if you go into the vatican you will
[33:35] see that concept repeated
[33:38] over and over again so what are you
[33:41] talking about
[33:42] i have been there several times
[33:46] and have toured the entire place
[33:50] i i can't say entire because the vatican
[33:54] and rome of course is a great city
[33:58] great to be hold beautiful for you to be
[34:01] able to
[34:02] go to italy and to see its glory
[34:06] its wealth its power its building its
[34:09] architecture
[34:11] gifts of the kings unimaginable
[34:16] but basically my friends you will see
[34:20] that concept of this trinitarian
[34:23] doctrine we're talking about
[34:26] of three persons being in the one
[34:29] godhead
[34:30] you will see it throughout
[34:34] and in continuity throughout
[34:37] your time there it will be displayed all
[34:40] around you
[34:43] in various forms
[34:46] of course when those catholic
[34:48] missionaries
[34:50] looked at the babe and the mother the
[34:52] only difference was the facial
[34:54] characteristics
[34:55] because every race or nation
[34:58] will draw their their belief of what
[35:01] they see
[35:02] with the characteristics of their people
[35:04] so when they saw it that's the way they
[35:07] saw it
[35:07] but the idea the thought was exactly and
[35:11] identically
[35:12] the same so then that suggests it didn't
[35:15] originate
[35:16] just from rome it did not originate era
[35:19] there
[35:20] it's originated where the bible says it
[35:22] came from
[35:23] out of beibel after the confusion of
[35:26] languages seems like they had a
[35:28] confusion of gods
[35:29] but also because out of there
[35:32] came this this madness
[35:36] this evil seduction of satan
[35:39] that threw the people away from one god
[35:44] before that time all the peoples of the
[35:47] earth
[35:47] believed in one god after babel
[35:52] after that time then this great
[35:57] migration away from the
[36:00] one god teaching and belief
[36:05] in the bible began to drift
[36:08] into darkness now
[36:13] the original mother and child
[36:17] because all these other concept came off
[36:20] of one
[36:21] original and that original
[36:24] came from in babylon
[36:28] now the name of the original modern
[36:31] child
[36:34] was semaramis
[36:39] and her son was called
[36:43] rhea semaramis
[36:47] and ria in the east
[36:52] and in her arms
[36:56] she held a babe
[36:59] who was described as tall
[37:02] strong handsome and captivating
[37:07] to women read in your bible
[37:11] ezekiel chapter 8
[37:15] verse 14.
[37:18] in ezekiel chapter 8 verse 14 the bible
[37:22] describes him or calls him or names him
[37:26] by the name tammuz
[37:30] tammuz t-a-n-m-u-z
[37:36] among classical writers he was called
[37:40] bacchus bacchus
[37:44] to the babylonians he was called
[37:49] nemos n-i-n-u-s
[37:53] which accounts for the fact
[37:56] ninus even to this day nino
[38:00] nina you know it's speaking
[38:04] of a child he's represented as a babe in
[38:07] arms
[38:09] and yet though he was a baby in arms
[38:13] he was described
[38:16] as a great and mighty man
[38:20] called the husband son
[38:24] one of his titles was that he was the
[38:27] child and yet he was the husband of the
[38:30] mother
[38:32] and in india where they are known as
[38:35] ishii and ishwara
[38:39] we know that it represented the husband
[38:43] at the breast of his own wife
[38:47] these things can be read from
[38:50] history just read it in antiquity
[38:55] and next week i will continue for then
[38:58] we now
[38:59] enter into the life and times
[39:04] of the biblical character described
[39:08] in genesis 10 verses 8 to 10
[39:12] called nimrod we will see
[39:17] that this same ninus spoken of
[39:21] in babylonian uh so-called
[39:24] writings semiramis tammuz
[39:28] all these things you will find it all
[39:31] leads right to
[39:33] nimrod spoken off in the bible
[39:36] and we will discuss him we will
[39:40] bring forth the truth of the word of god
[39:42] about him
[39:43] and open up your understanding of the
[39:46] origins of this trinitarian doctrine
[39:50] its attitude actions its characteristics
[39:53] of blood
[39:54] and lust for power and
[39:58] various other aspects
[40:01] i trust that this would have wetted your
[40:04] appetite
[40:07] and opened it up so that
[40:10] next week we can come believing
[40:14] receiving and go rejoicing
[40:18] in the name of the lord jesus christ may
[40:21] the lord jesus
[40:22] bless you and keep you in his wonderful
