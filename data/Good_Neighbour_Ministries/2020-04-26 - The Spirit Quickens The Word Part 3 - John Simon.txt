========================================
[Music] good Sunday morning friends bless you neighbors welcome to believers from around the world and locally let us come into his house with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise welcome to another broadcast sponsored by good neighbor ministries of Burlington Ontario I'm Pastor John Steinman let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father sincerely we pray from the bottom of our hearts for our prime minister for our premiere for the best of health and vigorous life we pray Lord for all frontline workers we pray for the safety of our neighbors and friends we pray for her loved ones and believers everywhere Oh God send forth thy light and truth from this broadcast may you shine your light of your word and your glorious gospel everywhere annoyed your servant as we preach the word and take all the glory honor and praise for we ask it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ well friends last week I spoke on this subject of the quickening spirit the spirit quickening the word to the age and now I'd like to read from our King James Version of the Bible I'm reading first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 45 and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit let us give glory to God that this marvelous quickening spirit of God is here with us this morning now before I begin to advance from where we left off last week I'd like to clarify the meaning of the word quicken what does this word quicken mean from Google it says to quicken means to make faster to speed up to accelerate something quicken for the means to stimulate us or to excite as in stimulating interest you know exciting interest to quicken means to restore life for example the body of Christ that laid in the tomb for three days was written by the Holy Spirit which means he was restored back to life now there's a ancient or arc-8 meaning to the word written but it has some application to what we are talking about and one of those meanings is to cause a fire to burn to quicken is to cause a fire to burn also to quicken means ah signs of life signs of life for example of signs of movement of a fetus and the mother can now become conscious that there is life life is coming for signs of life now with that understanding last Sunday in part two of this series on the spirit clintons the word I quoted from a poem written by K L Brown called the little plant and here it is in the heart of a seed buried deep so deep a tiny plant lay fast asleep wake said the sunshine and creep to the light wake said the voice of the rain drops bright the little plant herd and rose up to see what they wonderful outside world would be that's a plan from KL Brown now I talked about how we are offsprings of the almighty Acts chapter 17 verses 26 to 29 for Paul there in the accent says for you are his offspring you are his children in other words you are his attributes you are his seat genes and uh now we understand I spoke of how we were in him from before the foundation of the world and uh just as a man would have his children in him until he is able to see his generation that were in him well he can see his generation made manifest in front of him then he can talk to them and they can talk with him and they can have fellowship one with the other now if you're a true child of God then you really are an eternal being that has trapped in a body of time or a time body in one sense you're a soul imprisoned imprisoned here but thanks be to God the Word of God as it went down into the prison and set the prisoners free that same word of God is here in this last day this last age to sit every captive on every prisoner free by the opening of the world the opening of the prison doors and using the key of Revelation upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against them by the opening of the Gateway you are able to come out into the unfailing reality of the Living God to recognize who you are and that you are an eternal being and you know in a movie some years ago there was a character in there called et but that's just a movie you and I are the real et's eternal beings come from the presence of Almighty God trapped in a flesh body serving his purpose here on earth until our return back to glory yes et it's going home time I'm here to tell you ET it's rapture time it's time for us to turn our hearts towards heaven and home and towards our Heavenly Father with joy within our hearts knowing that we on our way back to the Godhead we are way back going back into the presence of the Almighty God now with the opening of the seven seals we have witnessed the coming of the Lord in the form of his resurrected restored and revealed word which is no preparing our hearts and prepared the way for his corporal coming the rapture is at hand the time is at hand the Lord's rapturing power is here amongst us to prepare us for the event already by His grace in the process of the rapture which leads up to the event of the rapture and I'm glad I'm ending this stream of time this stream of Revelation this stream of the Holy Spirit I'm thankful today that we are caught up and being carried away by the light of the word and the power of the Holy Spirit I hear the midnight cry behold the bridegroom cometh wake up seeds of God wherever you are wake up the chains of young on your mind and on your spirit are gone the chains of devil traitor put on your body they're gone if you can believe it all things are possible to them that believe the Word of God yes sir you must decide to walk out of your prison is

lines clean up our lines clean up our walk cleanup of ourselves from the cobwebs of the mind so that the Holy Spirit can change and transform us by God's power to transform the Amen know God is calling Jesus is calling he's calling out to his genes that are still buried in the ground of human bodies in the ground of earthly bodies calling them to rise up above sin rise up above worthiness raise up above your habits rise up above your past don't let your past keep you down leave the past behind and press to the mark of the high calling which is in the Lord Jesus Christ yes sir he's calling you now to rise up to another level of understanding he's calling you into another dimension of seeing him reveal in his own word yes sir he's doing that so you may be in a rupturing condition oh thanks be to God and I'm here to say if the life of God was planted in you before the foundation of the world then the preaching of the water of this world that you are hearing here today this water of this world will wake up or resurrect God's seed life that was buried in you word well wake it up it will catch your attention it will arrest you and bring you to attention of his word wake up

course who are acquainted with this message of the hour we know and you know what was sent by the seven churches messenger if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again Church ages page 172 if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again I believe he's raising it up again I believe seeds have come into life I believe genes are waking up I believe that attributes of God are recognizing their position in Christ I believe it's happening right now and it's happening around the world the spirit of the Living God it's harvest time it's harvest time the Savior is calling the Spirit of God is calling the here of Shepherds voice may God's Holy Spirit deep into your soul and call out to you yes yes the Spirit of God is here to quicken the word in you to a resurrection by revelation the angel of God is here to trouble the waters to stir up the word into your soul amen the angel of God is here to bring you to a place of decision back to the spool of Siloam and many he pleased himself and stopped that piece of the world whether your mom taught you one verse of the Bible when you were young may the Holy Spirit of God take ahold of that and grab a hold of your heart and lead you to himself by his glorious word did this day in this hour thanks be to God forevermore it was said in the token the Spirit of God identifies the Jean as his own and then raises it up I believe he's here today to identify his own but he came to seek and to save those that were lost and he is seeking he is seeking the lost is kindly entreating Oh turn turn for why will you die come to Christ come to the perfect word come into a perfect understanding and a perfect revelation of who he is and who you are Oh clearly God sent his rain chances rain on the just and upon the unjust yes sir and then that defines his scene yes by the Holy Spirit the rain of God oh the mighty cleansing rains of God searches and finds his home and brings them to a consciousness of God and the work that God is doing within their soul the Spirit is here to quicken the word and to make it live again he quickens the word because he wants us to be his witnesses now I realize I'm not speaking only that he's quitting our understanding today words written in the Bible or in the message but the Spirit of God is here to quicken you and I who are living revelations of that word for we were a part of that word from before the foundation of the world and preach through the predestinated mystery of his will please into human bodies that we were born into for a purpose that we might manifest him we have a name to declare we have a mission to to perform and we have a word from him that we must make manifest we have a character that we must declare that the people can see God in Christ Christ in the church and the kingdom coming less it be his holy and precious name yes sir now we realize that the spirit which was the word to make it live and the word is a conductor for the Holy Spirit well the Spirit follows the Word of God and causes the Word of God to live takes me to God the great holy spirit the white horse rider is here raining on the word into our hearts on the white horse of the revelation of the word Rivet revelation 19:11 260 and he came riding on the white horns and upon his time he was written king of kings lord of lords and his name was called a word of God that conquering all conquering word King is writing into art spirits are so today we have the opportunity for him to be the mighty Conqueror and to have the preeminence in our lives and that we can surrender all and live for him forgetting the past that is behind and pressed the words of glorious wonderful future of a genuine Christian life walking in the light of the world amen now of course we understand friends that though they the word is a conductor for the Holy Spirit but plastic cannot conduct the Holy Spirit or me a conductor for the Holy Spirit if you're just a plastic Christian if you're a one that is a dramatic Christian that lives by oh and Christian is supposed to act this way and you perfect your act your your Christian act until it becomes nothing but a Christian Rama life you're nothing but a plastic Christian you see God can't flow through that God can't use that as a conductor Oh God can't flow through rubber you know rubber is not a conductor is an insulator so here

tomorrow their max linen somewhere out there like that God doesn't look for rubber Christians maybe not the rubber we're supposed to be conductors for the glory of God then you have those Christians that are like a block of wood right there wooden in church they're just sit there and they'll grim and they'll stare at that preacher they'd feel embarrassed even to say Amen there I feel embarrassed to say glory to God they'll be ashamed to raise their hands to their Creator and to their makeup Oh think about those wooden men those wooden women wouldn't Christians just told when they're to rise thought when they're to sit told when they can say Amen or a certain uh you know canned phrase instead of fresh food from the presence of Almighty God oh we will not to be wooden Christians you can't be a conductor for the Holy Spirit you can't be a conductor for acts 1:8 acts took for the power of God to flow through your life and to anoint you and use you for his glory and honor we are to be as we all know in natural life copper is a marvelous conductor of electricity we want to be like a copper wire that's filled with the energy and power and Dunamis of the Holy Spirit of Almighty God by breaking and living through your entire being animating and causing you to be a life under the anointing of the Holy Spirit I'm not talking about just an emotion I'm talking about the genuine 100 proof baptism of the Holy Spirit filling your soul for the glory the vine Oh God take your Lord you'll save the best wine for last and here's the best wine for this hour may the ways of God in new wineskins baptize you on would you use you'll fill you with his presence which is being to live through you all thanks be to his wonderful name yes sir him so he's calling every one of us to be conductors of his word so that God's Word will flow through us learn his name and so the great Holy Spirit is here to rescue by his word and to cause you to become prisoners of Jesus Christ that you might be go out working hard for the Lord in other words to be on the Lord's chain-gang to be prisoners of Jesus Christ chained to him shackled to him by the Holy Ghost that you might only do his will for sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of Almighty God may the Spirit of God take the whole of you until we are all handcuffed by the Holy Ghost and walking in his Divine Will and his plan and his purpose Oh conductors of his word that we might be able to say flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me Oh God as I lift my hands to worship may the Spirit of Almighty God flow right through my soul to quicken us to empower us to flow through us that we might become conductors of his love conductors of his life conductors as Mary was in the days when she received the Word of God how did she receive it she received it by the word spoken word of an angel who stood before her and said you shall bear a son his name shall be called Jesus and thanks be to God that God sent a seventh angel church each messenger in this last day to stand before us and to speak his word into our soul that there might be comforta a new birth a new creation and new life glory to God forevermore and here we are to become conductors and carriers of the Word of God who are willing to bear the shame and reproach for this message and for his name to be reproach for his name oh yes they call you one God people they call you serpent seed people they call you all kinds of names amen holy rollers Pentecostal even people of this message don't recognize the difference by an anointed message child of God - uh a modern-day Pentecostal contrary to God's Word they can't even discern the Lord's body and if you knew you're an animated anointed and moving on the inspiration of northing and leadership the Holy Spirit and the gifts of God are rich and pure and holy and working within the body they can't even recognize God's Spirit god help us in this hour thanks be to God we are here the beard or approach for this word that we are carrying great even so he's calling you and I to become messengers of his grace and of his mercy to quicken to quicken we could also means to cause a fire to burn oh thank god the mechanics of the word has been restored and a lot of believers are happy with the mechanics of the word they are happy with all the quotations they're happy with knowing all the wonderful things said spoken by the great messenger that came they're very happy with that the word has been restored on part of his spiritual body also being restored because the written word and spoken word that was restored was there was just a representation of the believers or of the spiritual bodies of the elect for this age and for this owl and the Word of God is calling out in this day and in this hour as a spirit Gosport he crawls to his own o blessed be his name to quicken us and cause us for the fires of God tupperman in our soul yes sir she the bright body is ready she's ready for the fire to fall let the fire fall let me anointing come let the rapture come I'm ready you are ready let's get ready that's being ready let's be prepared what fire I'm talking about the fire of the Holy Ghost I'm talking about the far as it was on the day of Pentecost I'm talking about the dynamics coming up on the mechanics I'm talking about the pillar of fire they love ghosts of God coming upon the written word the Rhema of God the Lumos causes the written Rhema word to convey to shine out the McNown itself to reveal God's secrets yes sir - cause that word to live again written spoken and living word to live again and to produce another book of Acts another book of actions moved by the Holy Spirit anointed by God God living moving and having his entire being in his people and he making himself manifest as their God their creat creator their Redeemer their Savior they're coming King blessed be his name thank you Lord hallelujah yes sir God's Spirit is here with us today now we want to use the illustration as has already been utilized by God's prophet that you can have a perfectly brand-new car a beautiful Porsche a wonderful Cadillac whatever the car of your heart brand new but if that color has no gas in it you may keep polishing that car all day long all day long and marry it admiring the church admiring the admiring your life even that you're a good man you're a good woman here you know you live for you're a church man you're a church woman here you may even say you're a message believer I follow the word that's that's okay but all you have is a polished up car and a good exterior where your actions and your acts your dramatizations are so less that none can see your discern what lurks our lives behind that veil oh but if there is no gasoline in the car the car will not move you can turn the key as much as you want the car will move but then if you went to God's filling station for inspiration and the Holy Ghost stretches soul opens up the word and the word that you have been accumulating through the day the years like the Apostles did while they were with Jesus three and a half years they F with him they slept with him they fished with him and they knew him the word but they have no revelation of who he was who he really was they this F stinks but here it is brother sister the Word of God was a being stored up in your storehouse of your soul that word was dead back into you and you may have been following it for years and years following it but that still will not make your vehicle move for your vehicle to move you first have to be able to have a key electronic or a natural one that's placed in there and when that kids turned are pressed something happens you must have have to get in there already and when that key which is what I'm trying to determine by the Holy Spirit that key is turn then something happens within the combustion chamber of the power the combustion chamber of the human heart all of us a spark a revelation a supernatural inspiration from the presence of God strikes that soul and the spark in the combustion chamber off of that spot club strikes that gas in there and it just produces power it produces high-octane power takes you from the first and second pull and puts you under the inspiration of the mighty angel inspiration of the third pole to move in him and live in him and have your being in him so that you may be a conductor for the word of God and that his word may come to pass in and through your life oh then you'll become a nutball then you become strange to people then you may be called crazy you may be called a different you can't be explained why because it's the Word of God making the self known in you as an individual Oh blessed be the name of our Living God yes sir so God just quittance us and uses us as conductors that we might relay convey that we might conduct his word witnesses you shall become witnesses after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you when he dwells in you and he flows through you oh thanks be to God he lives in me I pray God he lives in you I pray God that all you have is not just a baptism of the Holy Ghost for the word baptized means back tips or comes from the word baptism which means to dip in and under and to be brought back out so a baptism means you went in and then you went under yes you went under but to come back out but we're not talking about just a baptism of the Holy Ghost just a vacation made wait for a second patience sanctification made way for the baptism of the holy spirit and now the holy the Baptist and Holy Spirit makes way for the Holy Ghost himself to end well the Emmanuel then again he may be God with us that he might become the son of man being revealed again in this church body the bright form making himself known to his people by living in them walking in them moving in them being their God in them the word that was made flesh back there now you flesh that has been redeemed is going back to becoming word from the presence of Almighty God so how does the spirit quicken the word so that we are so that the word can become the vehicle to to make known his truth to make known his presence and his perfect stature his character his children walking like him acting like him moving like him under because it's in their nature they're a part of him and they're moving in the holy spirit of the Living God hallelujah now he does it by revelation Paul the Apostle did say how that by revelation he made known to me the mystery Ephesians chapter 3 verse 3 by revelation all with all of his understanding Paul Peter turned to Paul and said Paul you're saying such deep things that even I have to think about them I I oh I have to really get to understand some of the things you're saying Paul but Paul said and that's not me he revealed to me the mystery he had to make it known and know with his own wisdom of understanding can stand before God's bright but God has to send his servants with his word for this hour and by revelation he made known to me the mystery or in other words he revealed to me his hidden secrets he revealed to me previously hidden things and made them plain yes sir Oh what is a mystery a mystery is a hidden secret something that was hidden now made plain but in which a supernatural element still remains I believe that supernatural element is the element of the Holy Spirit's ability to reveal the word and to propagate the word by revelation the fertilizer soul enter father make you with the presence of God and the power of the Holy Spirit that you might be saying be able to say I am my father are one I come from God and I'm going back to God thanks be to God for that kind of oneness that we are experiencing
