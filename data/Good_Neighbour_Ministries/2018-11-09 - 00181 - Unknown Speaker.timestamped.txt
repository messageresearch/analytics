[2:36] let's read some truly mine so let's read
[2:49] together
[2:49] truly my soul we did love of God from
[2:54] him my salvation he he is my eyes
[3:13] [Music]
[3:36] my soul wake up on God for my
[3:40] expectations is from him he only is my
[3:46] rock and my salvation he is just like a
[3:58] tree planted kind of living waters I
[4:01] shall not be with the Lord is of her
[4:03] drop amen
[4:05] the Lord is our roughly believe us
[4:08] praise the Lord
[4:09] these are from Chris talking about this
[4:12] little rock and particularly tonight we
[4:15] want to touch up a prophet from the
[4:17] Prophet to define as the rock for our
[4:22] day and of course the real word come to
[4:25] the grind in earth to her and the brain
[4:29] becomes that rock of the hour poor
[4:31] enough to work God that is in her to
[4:35] bless the entire world just as they
[4:37] don't know it and to catch the attention
[4:39] of the rest of the elect the story Bible
[4:43] you know so refined it's a word revival
[4:50] but anyway let's just look to the Word
[4:53] of God
[4:54] please be seated we and concluded on
[4:58] something by talking about the draw
[5:03] people may not practice today even in
[5:09] that's right every bridges trained to
[5:12] Yahoo the greatest crowd you can
[5:16] divestiture in the greatest congregation
[5:20] or most all words or part of a - tree of
[5:26] returns and good luck to me the death
[5:28] note speakers of the message before you
[5:32] collapse crowd if it's a no-name richer
[5:36] that were just made before brother so a
[5:41] lot easier to rest it but if they hear
[5:44] certain names all the sudden crowds want
[5:50] to turn up to hear that person because
[5:53] of their name well-known brothers right
[5:59] in the message that is there upon the
[6:04] people I am that they're missing the
[6:09] rock in other words they got felt highly
[6:13] in various fight over the street gifts
[6:16] the scattered out of this message
[6:19] that's not consumer to be in the
[6:21] mainstream deliberately because God said
[6:25] it clearly but this third Pole begins it

[41:42] no mr. Garfield if you say you have the
[41:51] understanding is not projected to do
[41:53] because you've got the wrong idea
[41:55] we need to go back and check the
[41:57] regulations so the seals were open and
[42:03] the Holy Spirit comes and he reveals
[42:05] them to the individual and after and if
[42:10] you claim is being revealed to you that
[42:12] the word gets in you and the word
[42:16] manifests itself through open revealed
[42:23] manifested the word in its truthful
[42:29] individual this was not that Jesus back
[42:32] way this is the bright here and the same
[42:36] Spirit of God manifesting itself through
[42:39] her amen and praise the name of the Lord
[42:42] the Spirit of God working and moving
[42:45] through her life praise the Lord
[42:49] Bluebird the God last night you're right
[42:53] lesson that we are given spiritual
[42:58] discernment to be able to separate
[43:01] between the Prophet man William Graham
[43:06] and on this same topic and God himself
[43:10] operating
[43:13] gotta love it to be that way because you
[43:16] wanted to confuse the enemies that a lot
[43:21] of the religious spirit by making
[43:28] identified they will be caught in the
[43:32] filter right they'll be caught the
[43:35] filter but the truth gentlemen break who
[43:38] has supernatural discernment to discern
[43:43] between the man William and God was in
[43:50] the man operating grace of Allah yes sir
[44:06] armored truck
[44:08] because a lot of them are now excused
[44:13] because sequence Ramsey watching over
[44:16] here the word in his message over there
[44:23] to message and then they see all three
[44:25] of those statements they try to put it
[44:27] together

[47:16] brethren he says a lot of things that I
[47:21] have said for deliberately settle down
[47:29] to confuse
