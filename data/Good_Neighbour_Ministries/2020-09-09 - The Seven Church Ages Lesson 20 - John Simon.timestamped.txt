[1:31] now out of the book of revelation
[1:34] chapter 2 reading verses
[1:38] 1. unto the angel
[1:42] of the church of ephesus right
[1:46] these things said he that hold it
[1:49] the seven stars in his right hand
[1:54] who walk it in the
[1:57] midst of the seven golden
[2:01] candlestick thanks be to god
[2:04] for the reading of his word
[2:07] this is who jesus is
[2:11] this is the same one this jesus
[2:15] that is both lord and christ
[2:18] thank god he is the one and
[2:22] only lord god almighty
[2:25] he is the same hebrews 13 8
[2:29] jesus christ the same yesterday
[2:33] today and forever
[2:37] he is our lord he is our master
[2:41] he is our savior he is our
[2:45] all in all and here we
[2:48] see jesus we see
[2:52] jesus walking in the midst of his
[2:55] churches
[2:57] throughout the seven church ages
[3:03] and what he was in the first day
[3:06] here we see him he is the same
[3:10] in the last day we see
[3:14] him the mighty god that what he was
[3:19] is also what he is
[3:23] and what he has done is what he will
[3:27] keep on doing for all time for he is our
[3:32] unchanging god
[3:35] who changes not praise
[3:38] god we serve a god like that
[3:41] a god who does not change who does not
[3:45] lie but a god who stands by his word
[3:51] and his word changes not for it's the
[3:54] same
[3:55] yesterday today and forever
[3:58] heaven and earth will pass away but
[4:01] my word will never ever
[4:05] pass away notice it's jesus
[4:09] and jesus alone as we look out
[4:13] friends we do not see jesus on anyone
[4:16] else
[4:18] but our eyes see jesus only
[4:23] and the bible tells us that he is seen
[4:27] walking up and down amongst
[4:30] these candlesticks he is
[4:33] walking alone in a middle
[4:37] and in the midst of his churches
[4:40] there is no one else with him
[4:44] neither in there indeed can there be
[4:47] anyone else within him
[4:50] for he alone did the work of salvation
[4:55] he did the entire work
[4:58] of redemption he is the one
[5:02] who purchased her the bride
[5:06] with his own precious broiled
[5:10] blood so he alone owns her
[5:14] and he is her lord and master
[5:19] not only did he save her but she was
[5:22] humble enough to surrender herself
[5:26] that he would be her lord
[5:30] and her master having the preeminence
[5:34] in her life and so
[5:37] with gratitude with grace within her
[5:40] heart
[5:41] she gives him all the glory
[5:44] all the honor and all the praise
[5:48] is worthy to give to this
[5:52] lamb that shed his blood
[5:55] as though it was slain and there
[5:58] she gives him the glory and the praise
[6:01] for he can share it
[6:02] with no other as we
[6:06] look out and we see jesus
[6:10] he is walking yes but we do not see
[6:14] any pope with him
[6:17] when we look out and we see jesus
[6:20] there is no princely
[6:24] archbishop with him
[6:27] we do not see any cardinal
[6:30] walking with him and furthermore
[6:34] we look out there there is no other
[6:38] intercessor any other mediator
[6:42] mediatrix there is no
[6:45] mary you remember mary
[6:48] who was the vessel or
[6:52] considered to be the mother of jesus
[6:55] or mother of the body that god
[6:58] wanted to create so that he could
[7:01] indwell it
[7:02] god in christ hallelujah thanks be to
[7:05] god and now
[7:06] in our day christ in you your hope of
[7:09] glory
[7:10] amen praise god so mary
[7:13] is not seen with him great as she was
[7:17] blessed as she was chosen as she was
[7:21] separated as she was used of god as she
[7:24] was
[7:25] and yet in this scene we see him
[7:29] in his total supremacy we see him
[7:32] in his lordship and he is seen
[7:36] alone to him be all the praise the honor
[7:39] and the glory
[7:40] for he alone is worthy of all the praise
[7:44] and the honor and the glory
[7:47] thanks be to god that when we see him
[7:52] as i see him as you see him
[7:56] when we see him we do not see
[7:59] him turning to another person beside him
[8:03] called his father making any remark
[8:07] to him we do not see him
[8:10] turn to his right and
[8:14] call of the holy spirit to do
[8:17] something that he would like to get
[8:20] done for this is inconceivable
[8:25] for he is the one true god
[8:28] father son and holy spirit
[8:31] he is the eternal spirit that allowed
[8:35] himself to
[8:36] indwell a body of time
[8:39] a time body a body of flesh
[8:44] god and man god in christ amen
[8:48] god walking among us emmanuel
[8:52] god with us hallelujah
[8:55] god above us israel god
[8:59] with us back there they amongst the
[9:02] jewish people
[9:03] now god in us walking and
[9:06] talking and living within us
[9:09] there is no one else with him
[9:13] for there is no life without him
[9:17] and without him there is no salvation
[9:21] for is there is no salvation in any
[9:23] other
[9:24] for there is no other name given under
[9:27] heaven
[9:27] whereby we must be saved but the name of
[9:31] our lord
[9:32] and savior jesus christ amen
[9:36] there was no there was no one with him
[9:40] when he was there in
[9:43] gethsemane oh lest i forget
[9:48] gethsemane lest i forget his love for me
[9:52] oh may the great holy spirit take our
[9:55] minds
[9:55] back to think of how the bible says he
[9:59] struggled he prayed until there was like
[10:03] sweats drops of blood upon his
[10:06] brow while he fought the great
[10:10] fight and struggled against the great
[10:13] hordes of
[10:14] satan and sin and fought against them
[10:18] and how that he was there all alone
[10:22] in gethsemane treading the fierceness
[10:25] of the winepress of the wrath of god
[10:29] alone making making in other words
[10:32] he was about to uh address
[10:35] or to best satisfy the the
[10:38] wrath of god against the sins
[10:41] of the entire human race and to pay the
[10:44] price
[10:45] of our redemption it was no other but
[10:48] jesus and jesus alone was none other
[10:52] but jesus that hung on the cross
[10:56] it was not a pope it was not mary it was
[10:59] not peter
[11:00] it was no other than jesus himself
[11:04] that hung upon the cross there alone
[11:08] for our sins for he is the author and
[11:11] the finisher
[11:12] of our faith he is the alpha he is the
[11:14] omega
[11:15] the beginning of the end wonderful
[11:17] counselor mighty
[11:19] god hallelujah everlasting father
[11:22] amen and we are married or
[11:25] espoused to him and to no other
[11:29] we are not married to any church so we
[11:32] do not have to take on any church
[11:34] name we are married to him christ
[11:38] therefore we are christians we walk in
[11:41] his name
[11:42] in his light in his life in his power
[11:45] therefore we are one with him hallelujah
[11:49] praise
[11:49] god hallelujah we belong to him
[11:53] and because we belong to him his words
[11:57] is our law there is no creed but christ
[12:01] there is no
[12:02] law but love there is no words but the
[12:06] words
[12:06] that he has spoken in this bible and we
[12:09] are resting upon
[12:11] that by faith in his precious
[12:14] word that he has given we do not trust
[12:17] in creeds
[12:19] we do not trust in the darkness of man
[12:23] we are not trusting any bylaws of man
[12:27] any constitutions drawn up by
[12:30] men they have no influence and no effect
[12:33] upon the true believer
[12:35] that believes only the word
[12:38] of our living god amen lord
[12:42] god hallelujah yes it is jesus
[12:46] oh it is jesus oh it is
[12:50] jesus in my soul amen
[12:54] oh praise god hallelujah he
[12:57] walks amongst us he walks among
[13:00] his churches he walks with his
[13:04] messengers it is god in the midst
[13:07] of the churches for jesus of the
[13:10] new testament is the same jehovah
[13:14] of the old testament now making himself
[13:18] visible in the form of a man whose
[13:21] body he shaped and formed in the
[13:25] womb of a woman called mary who was just
[13:28] used and blessed he was not from mary
[13:31] of mary but he only passed
[13:35] through mary to make himself
[13:38] visible to the world so it's not the
[13:40] that she
[13:41] is the special blessed woman person
[13:45] on the side but that he is the blessed
[13:48] one
[13:48] he is our hope he is our faith he is our
[13:51] salvation
[13:52] he is the one we should pray to he is
[13:55] the one we should call upon
[13:57] it's his name that should be glorified
[14:00] and magnified for he alone
[14:03] is worthy and our relationship
[14:06] should be with him him alone
[14:11] thank god that we have this relationship
[14:15] with god
[14:16] and our relationship with god is true
[14:20] jesus christ the visible appearance of
[14:23] god
[14:24] that a human being could have a visual
[14:27] to understand
[14:28] who god was how god acted and how god
[14:32] will always act
[14:33] for what god did the first time he will
[14:35] do every time
[14:37] for he is perfect in all of his
[14:41] ways he was alone
[14:44] when he went to golgotha
[14:48] when he climbed the goddess hill
[14:51] he was alone then nailed him to a cruel
[14:55] cross
[14:56] he was all alone when they
[15:00] pierced him in the side and they took
[15:03] him
[15:04] down from the cross and placed him
[15:08] into a roman tomb and then have the
[15:12] gall to put their name or their
[15:15] seal on it as if they're the original
[15:18] but here he was that he the word
[15:21] that they tried to bury under the very
[15:25] roman seal here he was
[15:28] working in the background fighting
[15:31] against satan and the
[15:34] hordes of hell fighting against them
[15:37] to free the captives of the old
[15:40] testament
[15:41] prophets patriots and believers of the
[15:43] old testament that were in paradise at
[15:46] that time
[15:47] and so satan had to give up those
[15:50] keys of dead hell of the grave he still
[15:53] claims that he asked them anyway
[15:55] that he owns all of those keys but in
[15:58] reality
[15:59] the keys are really in the hands of the
[16:02] lord jesus christ himself
[16:05] and those are nothing but fake theirs
[16:08] are nothing but just fake symbols
[16:11] that he carries around with him because
[16:14] he had to give up those keys
[16:17] so that jesus could open the prison
[16:19] doors
[16:20] of those souls that were imprisoned then
[16:23] and take captivity captive and
[16:27] take them back to heaven with him
[16:30] oh praise god he let their captivity
[16:34] captive
[16:34] and then he was able to pour out his
[16:36] spirit and
[16:38] send gifts unto men thank god
[16:41] it is jesus alone
[16:45] we see him yes
[16:48] with the seven stars in his right hand
[16:52] and of course we know that the right
[16:56] hand
[16:57] is the hand of power it speaks of this
[17:00] in the book of psalms chapter 44 verse
[17:04] 3 for they got not their land in
[17:07] possession
[17:08] by their own sword neither did their
[17:11] own arm save them but
[17:15] thy right hand and thine
[17:18] arm and the light of thy countenance
[17:22] because thou that's favor unto them
[17:27] so we see that in this right hand of
[17:30] power
[17:31] he holds these seven messengers
[17:34] within his right hand according to
[17:37] revelation
[17:38] chapter 1 verses 20.
[17:42] and these seven messengers
[17:45] which signify on the earth they
[17:48] signify the power the sign of the power
[17:53] and authority of the living god flowing
[17:56] through them
[17:57] and using them as god expresses himself
[18:02] for god is always behind
[18:05] his messengers whenever
[18:08] he sends them to a particular age
[18:12] and they go forth in the fire of god
[18:16] in the fire power of the holy spirit
[18:19] anointed and used by the living god
[18:23] to send forth and to manifest
[18:26] his word for that day and for that time
[18:30] and so these messengers these
[18:33] men that were backed up by the hand
[18:37] of god they went forth
[18:41] under that inspiration for there
[18:44] were the seven stars of the seven
[18:47] church ages through the
[18:51] season of time that god had in his
[18:55] supernatural economy
[18:58] their stars and we know that stars
[19:02] do not come out in the day but stars
[19:06] shine their light at night they reflect
[19:09] the
[19:10] light after that the sun
[19:13] is gone down and they're reflecting not
[19:16] a light of their own but
[19:18] his light his light is their life
[19:21] his light is their power his light
[19:25] my friend is their entire existence
[19:29] and inspiration for they have no light
[19:32] of their own
[19:35] they don't come on the earth to start
[19:37] their own ministry
[19:39] or to point to themselves but they
[19:42] are here to reflect his light and so
[19:45] with their entire life
[19:48] with their walk with their talk with
[19:50] everything they do
[19:52] oh it is jesus oh it is jesus and jesus
[19:56] alone
[19:56] is to bring glory and honor and praise
[20:00] to his great
[20:01] and mighty name and to draw the
[20:03] attention
[20:04] of the people of his bride to
[20:08] him all glory be to god
[20:11] that's what they're here for and so they
[20:14] want a man to walk in the light
[20:17] of his life amen
[20:21] so it's nighttime it's dark
[20:24] when the stars come out so if we know
[20:27] god has sent a messenger especially in
[20:30] this last day
[20:32] then we know it must be the law decent
[20:35] church age
[20:36] in which the bible tells us according to
[20:39] zechariah
[20:40] that there will be a day that's dark nor
[20:43] night but an evening
[20:44] time it shall be light and so thank god
[20:48] that when it became dark and the truth
[20:52] of god
[20:53] the word that was given to the church
[20:56] was
[20:56] displaced was misplaced misinformation
[21:00] was given
[21:01] dislocation had taken place from the
[21:04] original word of god
[21:06] then the great holy spirit anointed a
[21:10] messenger
[21:11] to bring the original seed the original
[21:14] word
[21:15] thus saith the lord not thus said the
[21:19] church that thus said the pope not
[21:20] thus said the cardinal judge bishop
[21:22] whoever it is
[21:23] but thus see it the lord himself
[21:27] so in the middle of this night of the
[21:30] blackness of
[21:31] sin in this period of lilithia
[21:35] out come the stars to shine
[21:39] and twinkle and bring their bright and
[21:42] shining lights to the glory of god
[21:45] to the world that the world may see
[21:48] another
[21:48] display of the person and
[21:51] life of jesus christ glory to
[21:54] god hallelujah thanks be to god
[21:57] hallelujah
[21:58] amen so these seven messengers
[22:02] are making known god to his people
[22:07] listen what the word says in john 13 20
[22:10] he
[22:10] that receiveth them receiveth
[22:14] him that sent them
[22:17] they speak with his authority
[22:20] he stands behind them he backs them
[22:23] up hallelujah all the powers of heaven
[22:27] and earth all the powers of the godhead
[22:30] are behind them that is why they can
[22:33] always say how can you deceive me
[22:37] you cannot lie to me now i
[22:41] know your thoughts i see what you are
[22:44] thinking
[22:45] i know what happened yesterday when you
[22:48] were young
[22:49] thus thus this lesson does took place
[22:52] when you were just a young man or a
[22:54] young woman and that
[22:55] messenger will tell you exactly because
[22:59] it was not just the words of a man
[23:01] god god was backing up a man that's why
[23:05] the man could say
[23:06] if there's anything that i have said
[23:09] in his name that is not right then you
[23:13] show me where it is in the word of god
[23:16] not what he as a man spoke of himself
[23:19] but as a messenger speaking in the name
[23:22] of the lord
[23:23] with thus saith the lord there is not
[23:26] one anywhere that can say anything
[23:29] against that
[23:30] for it is the word of our god
[23:33] hallelujah thanks be to god that in
[23:36] matthew 28
[23:37] verses 18 to 20 that he speaks the word
[23:41] of god clearly
[23:42] jesus came and spake unto them saying
[23:46] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[23:50] in earth
[23:52] go therefore and teach all nations
[23:56] baptizing them in the name of the father
[24:01] notice he do not does not say names
[24:04] and there is a conjunction between these
[24:08] in the name of the father one name
[24:11] and of the son one name end of the holy
[24:15] ghost
[24:16] one name for all three in the name of
[24:19] the father
[24:20] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[24:23] teaching
[24:23] them to observe all things whatsoever
[24:27] i have commanded you and
[24:31] lo and behold i
[24:34] am with you always
[24:37] even to the end of the age even to the
[24:40] consummation
[24:41] of the age even to the end of all of
[24:44] these church ages
[24:46] when time for the church ages will be no
[24:49] more
[24:50] time for the church ages will have run
[24:52] out
[24:53] and will be over praise be to god
[24:57] man full of the holy ghost and
[25:00] full of faith and fired up with the
[25:03] anointing and the fire of the holy
[25:05] spirit
[25:06] blazing shining brightly in their lives
[25:10] no other life no other ministry no other
[25:14] man woman upon the earth at that time
[25:18] whose life will ever be able to measure
[25:20] up to them
[25:21] because there were the specific
[25:24] messengers
[25:25] sent by the living god in the presence
[25:28] of almighty god and they're the ones
[25:33] holding forth the word of life
[25:36] for the entire age
[25:39] hallelujah and so no believer
[25:44] of any age or to say oh i wish i was
[25:47] back
[25:48] in the days i could see jesus oh i was i
[25:51] wish i was back in the days
[25:53] of the apostles you don't have to be
[25:55] back in those days
[25:57] he has come in our day in our time
[26:00] manifested himself through a human being
[26:04] an armed day and let us know
[26:07] his actions his activities his power
[26:11] his words his will his ways
[26:14] and his divine purpose within
[26:18] our lives praise be to god hallelujah
[26:22] amen for he is the same yesterday
[26:25] today and forever where two or three
[26:29] are gathered together in his name
[26:32] as as we are here now he is in the midst
[26:35] of us
[26:36] and he is in the midst to bless and to
[26:39] anoint
[26:40] with his presence hallelujah and he is
[26:42] not here
[26:43] and as a complacent onlooker he is not
[26:47] here
[26:47] just to be a spectator he is not here
[26:51] just to be an angelic recorder
[26:54] but he stands here anointed the
[26:58] anointing the word
[26:59] to express himself of who he truly
[27:03] truly is that he is the life giver
[27:06] he is the sustainer he is the giver
[27:10] of all good gifts to the church of god
[27:13] and we receive it all with
[27:16] thanksgiving in our hearts hallelujah i
[27:19] said hallelujah
[27:20] i said praise be to god and thank god
[27:24] for what he has done now not only does
[27:28] he have
[27:28] these marvelous wonderful messengers in
[27:31] his right arm but the bible says he
[27:35] walk it in the midst of the seven golden
[27:38] candlesticks
[27:40] how meaningful these words are
[27:43] when we view it in the light of
[27:45] scripture
[27:46] for as you know christ is our life
[27:50] and here's the life of the church and
[27:53] back then
[27:54] it's not kansas like now but the seven
[27:57] uh seven armed candle barns
[28:02] of of of the jewish people with one main
[28:06] stem
[28:07] that goes into the oil container
[28:11] on the bottom on all these
[28:14] candles sticks on the top receive
[28:17] their light their life and their
[28:21] strength their vitality it all
[28:24] flows from him and without
[28:27] him they could do nothing
[28:31] so he is our life he is the life of the
[28:35] church
[28:37] and she has no other life none of our
[28:39] own
[28:40] hallelujah without him
[28:43] friends we are nothing but a religious
[28:45] society
[28:47] without him we are just a religious
[28:50] gathering
[28:51] or just a club a meaningless gathering
[28:55] of people if his presence is not
[28:57] there we need his power and his presence
[29:01] for us to be the church the true church
[29:05] of the living god what we have today
[29:09] without his power his presence
[29:12] with no regard for him or his person
[29:16] what we have is a beautiful looking
[29:18] jeweled corpse
[29:20] calling itself the modern church
[29:24] of the living god uh and that
[29:27] church no matter all her beautiful
[29:31] wonderful programs no matter her
[29:33] beautiful
[29:34] makeup no matter how lovely she looks
[29:38] with all her
[29:39] orders with all her efforts
[29:43] with all the graces that she has all her
[29:46] achievements
[29:47] without the life of christ the animation
[29:51] the inspiration the anointing
[29:53] of the holy spirit in her midst she is
[29:56] nothing but a rotten sticking religious
[30:00] corpse in the presence of almighty god
[30:05] with him in her midst motivating
[30:08] and moving her she
[30:12] is the wonderment of all the ages
[30:16] for within her is
[30:19] his fullness of his spirit in dwelling
[30:22] her
[30:24] praise god and the in this very hour
[30:28] in which we speak his
[30:31] presence is here his power is here his
[30:36] anointing is here
[30:38] his very supernatural being
[30:41] is here to anoint the spoken word he the
[30:44] living word
[30:45] is anointing the spoken word to your
[30:48] heart
[30:49] he who is the living word the original
[30:52] seed of god going forth and anointing
[30:56] our hearts and lives here today praise
[30:59] be to god hallelujah amen so he who
[31:02] walked in the first
[31:04] age is here still today walking
[31:08] in this last stage as we bring glory to
[31:11] his name
[31:12] jesus christ the same yesterday jesus
[31:15] christ
[31:16] the same yesterday
[31:19] today and even forevermore
[31:23] thanks be to god hallelujah again
[31:26] our scriptures continues he
[31:29] walketh he walk it in the midst
[31:33] of the seven golden candlesticks in the
[31:36] book of exodus chapter 25 verse 31
[31:39] and thou shalt make a candlestick
[31:42] of pure gold of
[31:45] beaten work shall the candlestick be
[31:49] made
[31:51] his his shaft
[31:54] and his branches
[31:57] his bowls and his
[32:00] knots and his flowers
[32:04] shall be of the same so the true
[32:08] church of jesus christ the bride is
[32:11] lightened by god to pure gold
[32:14] of course gold expresses his person and
[32:17] character
[32:18] and so his righteousness becomes
[32:22] her righteousness his attributes
[32:26] becomes her attributes and
[32:30] her identification her identity
[32:34] she finds herself or her identification
[32:38] in him for sheep and him
[32:42] are really one that's why he says i am
[32:45] the vine
[32:46] you are the branches without me he
[32:49] can do nothing oh does the song well
[32:52] does the song say
[32:53] without him i can do nothing
[32:57] without him i'll surely fail
[33:02] without him i will be drifting
[33:06] like a ship without
[33:10] a sale o jesus
[33:14] or jesus would you know him today
[33:18] would you like to know him today in the
[33:21] power of his
[33:22] life and in the power of his
[33:24] resurrection may you
[33:25] come to know him in the power of his
[33:29] presence
[33:30] and of his life and of his resurrection
[33:34] now certainly friends we find out
[33:37] that she is summed up
[33:40] the church is a some total of his
[33:43] expression of his manifestation of his
[33:47] glory
[33:48] in the in her person he makes himself
[33:52] manifested for she is his handiwork
[33:56] she is his workmanship and she
[33:59] is his craftsmanship she is his
[34:01] masterpiece
[34:03] that he has seen through the ages and
[34:06] now he makes himself
[34:08] his eternal wisdom and his divine
[34:11] purpose from before the foundation of
[34:14] the world
[34:15] is now made manifest in and through her
[34:18] that the world will begin to understand
[34:22] the unveiling of the mighty god god in
[34:25] christ christ in the church the kingdom
[34:28] now being restored oh praise god how can
[34:32] we fully understand
[34:34] or comprehend this praise god we cannot
[34:37] but we can accept it by revelation faith
[34:40] for god himself has spoken this within
[34:44] the word
[34:45] thank god that he is not just a
[34:47] candlestick of gold
[34:50] but this candlestick is a beaten gold
[34:53] of course we understand beaten means
[34:56] like a craftsman
[34:58] shaping the candlestick he beats it and
[35:00] he shapes it
[35:02] it's memorable it's it's able to allow
[35:05] itself to be molded to be crafted
[35:09] to be shaped praise god hallelujah
[35:12] but if you were to take brass brass is
[35:15] resistant
[35:16] it's not like that and brass can be
[35:19] broken
[35:20] but thanks be to god this is like
[35:23] beaten gold that is willing to allow
[35:26] itself to be shaped to be shown to be
[35:29] whatever
[35:31] he wants it to be praise god hallelujah
[35:35] isn't that beautiful to think that the
[35:37] church is his
[35:38] masterpiece that the church is his
[35:41] handiwork that the church is crafted
[35:45] by him and that she is built by him
[35:49] according to his blueprint
[35:52] that he had and has in
[35:55] his mind for her concerning her
[35:59] of how she would look how she would act
[36:03] and what she will be for his glory
[36:07] and for his honor how beautiful to know
[36:11] all of this is not man made man
[36:14] thinking or the figment of man's
[36:17] thoughts or man's imagination but it is
[36:20] out of the very
[36:22] mind of god from before the foundation
[36:26] of the entire world the outside of jesus
[36:30] christ
[36:30] himself has there ever been a people
[36:32] beaten like this
[36:34] except for the true believers true
[36:36] christians
[36:37] everywhere in every age that they have
[36:40] lived in
[36:41] beaten and purged that she might
[36:44] manifest
[36:45] that she is truly the bride of jesus
[36:48] christ
[36:49] surely this church this group
[36:52] a body of believers are filling up
[36:56] the rest of his sufferings here upon
[36:59] the earth hallelujah she is the spoiled
[37:04] but yet she opens not her mouth
[37:08] she is left behind to carry on
[37:12] his work her life
[37:15] is always in jeopardy jeopardy
[37:19] but she stands with the word of god
[37:23] she has led to the guillotine
[37:26] she has led to the burning pillars
[37:31] as you latimer and ridley in england
[37:36] she is led to the coliseums of rome
[37:40] led to the slaughter to die
[37:44] on his behalf yay the bible says
[37:48] yes she is she is eaten up like
[37:51] bread and she has led to the slaughter
[37:54] all
[37:55] day long and yet she opened
[37:58] her mouth she suffers for him
[38:02] and yet she does not retaliate
[38:07] neither does she cause harm or suffering
[38:10] against those that bring pain and
[38:13] suffering
[38:14] to her or worthy
[38:18] of the gospel is this bride
[38:21] this true church of the lord jesus
[38:25] christ
[38:26] himself lord of god because he allowed
[38:30] herself
[38:32] to be handmade handcrafted shaped by him
[38:36] formed by him shaped by him to worship
[38:40] him
[38:40] formed by him to be faithful to him
[38:43] and to hold the his unchanging hand
[38:47] she is bowed but not broken she is
[38:50] knocked down but not knocked out she
[38:53] rises up
[38:54] and presses on in this way of life
[38:57] praise god
[38:58] she is a thing of beauty and a joy
[39:01] forever
[39:02] in the in the presence of this world
[39:05] they will behold her
[39:06] especially in these last days he will
[39:09] give
[39:10] forth through her a quick short work and
[39:13] display her
[39:14] in all her beauty to the entire world
[39:17] that she is his workmanship and he
[39:20] shaped her he formed her and he made her
[39:24] for himself his unfailing bride
[39:28] who holds to god's unchanging hand
[39:31] her lover or redeemer or savior
[39:34] or bridegroom or all in all may
[39:38] god bless you my beloved brethren
