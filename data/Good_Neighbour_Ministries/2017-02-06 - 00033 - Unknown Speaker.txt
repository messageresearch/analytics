TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to continue living their life the way that they were living it when true change comes when the spirit of God comes it changes the individual amen next slide Romans 5:12 he says wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that now because I've got the slide wrong I I'm I'm missing certain words here but anyways for for If by one man's offense verse 17 death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ he's the only way he's the only you know the Muslims today and all these different denominational teachings all we believe God you know I even talk to Muslims oh we believe Jesus we believe Jesus was a prophet oh he was a good man yeah but they don't believe him to be their Savior and that's why they're going into tribulation is that simple I can't change that's the word of God there's only one way there's only one name that man must be saved by and that is through the name of Jesus Hallelujah being born again we've been delivered from sin and trespasses in sin we were con deceived we were born in sin shaped in iniquity but the Holy Spirit once he comes and you receive the new birth it washes it all away amen it wipes out it it places you into the body of Jesus Christ and that is what is going to be quickened from this Dimension amen next slide in 1 Corinthians 15 verse 45 and so it is written the first man was made a living Soul the last adom was made a quickening spirit so if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken you amen it'll Quicken your mortal body it'll translate you from this Dimension amen that's why he said to Daniel he says seal up the book John seal up those things because the perfect word was now going to be revealed but not just yet there was going to be a season when Jesus Christ was going to reveal his word whereby you would receive the quickening power amen you would receive the rapturing faith that you need to go in a Rapture that's why a lot of people say why I got to go to your church to be in the Rapture no you don't have to go to my church you need to be born again and you need to be filled with the spirit you need to recognize Malachi 4 you need to recognize Revelations 10:7 we need to know that the mighty Angel is here right now in fivefold ministry that's translating perfecting and preparing a bride to go and meet with the bride grp boy that was a about full he's going to say wo where did you come from I came from Glory you want to come with me you're going to need to see what I'm seeing but I can't give it to you the Holy Spirit has to give it to you Hallelujah the Holy Spirit has to open your understanding glory to God he said seal up those things but in the days of the voice of that seventh angel let them know in part until that time comes that which is perfect has come because it's time it's time to go it's time to leave this place amen because let them know in part until that time comes and now the mighty Angel himself the chief Shepherd he's coming amen and I know my sheep and I'm going to call my sheep by their names and you wonder well how it is how is it that my name's being called is because you have the ability to say Amen to what I'm saying here this morning if you've got the ability to say Amen to the word of God and you're seeing this word you're knowing that the next slide says that you've had the new birth and you're being known as you are known amen that's right you're actually coming to a place knowing as I am know 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is what a new creation new creature old things are passed away behold all things have become new and all things are of God who ha reconciled us to himself remember he's redeeming he's redeeming we were always his he's just bringing us back he's redeeming us right back to where we came from amen glory to God you can't go there unless you came from there and have given us the ministry of what given us the ministry yeah you I wouldn't be standing here if I hadn't walked into brother Gabe shop there was a Ministry of reconciliation in him there's a Ministry of reconciliation in you and you've got to testify you got to tell the people you he listen he didn't get it hey you know God s a prophet Malachi 4:5 you got listen to this man you going to go to help you don't you got to stop smoking drinking cheating L I would have told him what I told everybody else because I had drivers I had people I had over 150 people working for me two 300 people over the years and a lot of them were trying to convert me Jehovah Witness and Jehovah this and voice of God or no God the Church of God and this and Baptist I told them all where even the last one he got me got on my nerves he was you know he standing at my truck I remember to this day and it wasn't long after that the Holy Spirit called me but you know he got he got me upset and I turn I said listen to me I said that's enough I don't want to hear it anymore if God wants me he'll come and call me himself understand Hallelujah it wasn't maybe a year later I was weeping and crying in the presence of the Lord I couldn't understand it why because it's his time Hallelujah we are called under the ministry of reconciliation God has given us that Ministry realize that our lives are an example The Way We Walk the way we talk because that which is perfect has come so what are you reflecting what is you what do you see in the mirror are you looking at something unperfect something you know confused what are you looking at what are you believing do you believe that God can do what he says he can do regardless of the circumstances in your life because this is the hour where the Supernatural is going to show this bride she's going to have a mystery oh yeah it's going to be Supernatural it's happening already but it's going to move into such a real just before we leave this place there's going to be a public display of some Supernatural word being spoken and things happening and people seeing things signs and wonders like they've never seen before Hallelujah so you got to either believe that it's possible believe that it's the season or you're just going to be miserable I'm telling you right now you continue in your arguments you'll continue in your disbelief you'll look at your brother your sister you'll look at their flesh you'll see their flaws and you'll get all upset and you'll get all you know you get all confused and angry and everything everything else just goes to show that you haven't died that's right am amen that's all when you got to have the last word and you got to be the one well I I said it this way I said that shut up be the last don't don't say a word when that person says something to you and you don't like it shut up amen say Lord help him Lord help him you intervene father you believe you can do that the reason he doesn't do it is because you always want to do it he looks at you say shut up why you got to why you got to say that why you got to why why you got to have the last word you got to die to yourself and then the supernatural comes over when when love projects in into that situation I don't care how ugly it gets sometimes you got to get down on your knees and you got to project love into that situation say oh God please help me this sinful flesh this carnal mind that that possesses my thoughts at times Lord oh this enemy that constantly wants to keep me in this bondage Lord let me be released from this unbelief and set my brother my sister free my mother my brother my wife my husband my son my daughter Lord let the grace of God come what I'm saying they're not hearing it Lord but if you speak when you said one word to me Lord it changed my world it changed everything explain how you did it it just happened Lord and you can do it I know you can do it you did it for me you can do it for them you believe that you got to get to that place you got to believe in that in that kind of way because God wants to deliver God wants you to have all that you desire and all that is yours according to the New Birth everything that God put into that attribute is yours whether you want it or not you just got to die out so you can receive it Hallelujah he goes he says all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation to Wi that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not in their trespasses Oh Glory to God he's not blessed is the man who God does not impute even iniquity oh yeah you make mistakes you know you're making a mistake and then you get down on your knees and God says what right I don't remember amen but I did it Lord I knew what I was doing I don't remember because you have accepted my you believe possible you believe that all are possible you're not placing something under there calling my word a lie he said all things all amen glory to God Amen bless the name of the Lord oh Jesus Hallelujah I'm saved and then you go along and you don't believe it you don't you don't you don't show up to church you don't know the age that you're living in you don't know the anointing that you should be under in the position that you should take after he reveals these things to you and you want to say no oh God that's not his desire you come in the assembly and you go back out into the world glory to God don't you realize God sent you here because he has a work for you he's got a purpose for us and you want to you want to you want to take your time and you want to you want to divide up your time and you want to just give God this little space shame on you a body he is preparing and you're either in that body or you're not you want to get involved if you're a Son of God a daughter of God you want to get involved that's right God's gifts always find their places that's right not sometimes they always find their place because God said so amen glory to God no matter what the pressure you want to be committed to the work you want to be dedicated in the service you want to be uh under the vision of the pastor because he's not just Gathering people into a church he's leading and guiding you to Eternity you got to have a revelation that you got to be under a pastor you got to have a revelation that the fivefold ministry is perfecting you right now you got to be submissive to that amen glory to God leading the flock into a promise for this hour Glory Hallelujah next slide but people want to do it by the law the law cannot make us perfect for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which offered year by year continually make the covers there unto perfect that which is perfect is come you need to receive that not you trying to make yourself perfect that's right amen get away from that stay away from trying to be a perfect try to be pleasing unto the world that's right that's what you want to do you want to be pleasing unto the Lord you so you want to look at your life the things that you do is not pleasing unto the Lord look into the mirror if you can look at yourself without looking up or looking sideways because you're not liking what you see then you need to change that's right amen amen therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law it is the knowledge of sin my goodness therefore we conclude that a man is justified by Revelation faith without it you can't please God don't try to please God without faith heyen without the Deeds of the law it's faith without the Deeds of the law amen glory to God in this day that which is perfect has come and we' got to allow that which is perfect to come and be revealed so that that which is in part can be completely done away with that's right amen yes Lord hallelujah do you know that God is going to do everything he can to make sure that you can't hallelujah oh yeah amen glory to God thank you Lord all the last ages they were Reformation ages amen we got to realize the time and the season that we're in we're in the Reformation ages but when this age came restoration going back to your origin that's what this Revelation gives you it doesn't give you just a history of the church ages it sends you back to before the foundations of the world oh glory to God Amen it gives you the original thought it places you back into the mind of God where Perfection he saw you from the foundations of the world he saw you perfect glory to God why because he's sing the perfect one himself to make you perfect to justify you to make you all that you need to be so that you can be translated that's right that's his promise brother Bram told us and and ministered the Mighty God is unveiled before us he was away she brother Brown that's why he you just go and study and and listen to him and you look at the messages that he preached and years that he preach them the Mighty God is unveiled before us yes Behold Him in plain

need in order to be translated glory to God the rising of the sun Christ the Risen One Shining on the church quickening the seed raising the people up amen and then brother bradle began to see himself in the word he began to see that hey hey I a minute here Charles just my Earthly father of this flesh I got a heavenly father I got to start to reflect him I don't got to once this happens once you realize that that that you've got a Heavenly Father you stop trying to lift yourself up that's right amen you you don't let Pride put you somewhere and make you something you want to reflect him

just rejoiced and he would preach the Super Side who do you say this is a greater than Solomon a greater than Jonah glory to God he was now reflecting the father what do you reflecting that's right and so it is with the sons and daughters this this hour Saints people are rising up in this hour they're beholding the word and taking it and saying yes the seals are open I've been enlightened by the word of God I can see now who I am I can see that the veil's been ripped and now it's it's a sin not to go behind that Veil it's a sin not to accept the fullness of the world it's a sin not to accept that which is perfect that has come into your life to change transform and make you what he wants you to be it' be a sin God will not stop revealing to you who you really are until all fear is God until all doubt is God until you see yourself the way God sees you Hallelujah glory to God I want him to see me I want I want I want to be able to see the way he sees me amen am that's what I want to see amen glory to God that's what the Holy Ghost is doing in this hour he's given us Faith he's making us know that we are attributes of God that we're connected to another uh uh Dimension that we're connected to another citizenship he's given us a revelation that this is not all that it is sometimes we get so caught up got to work on my retirement plan I make sure I can live for 20 years it's okay it's all right it's wise to plan financially and this and that sometimes I shake my head and I said 20 years this guy wants to talk about setting up a retirement plan for 20 years I can't even see two three years down the road this guy's talking 20 years I don't know but anyways you got to be wise and not foolish but don't get caught up Hallelujah cuz you're not fully connected to this world anymore and your Jehovah Gyra is still going to provide all your needs even if he terries amen so be wise but don't get too car bless the Lord cuz we're seeing things in part when we're in that kind of a dimensional thinking we're seeing things just you know in part everything's in part everything's in part everything is like a time everything you're a creature of Eternity you had no beginning you'll have no end so don't worry about it you'll be walking on gold you won't have to worry about gold here you'll be walking on goldah now I'm not saying that gold is a good not a good investment I think it is especially in times like this amen amen next slide and we're winding this down now ice cream or a precious Pearl brother BR talks about a boy story of a young boy that loved ice cream and boy he'd be at his house and you know you can hear you know that that sound even my wife get is that the ice cream track I can hear that sound my kids we all know when we were kids we can hear that ice cream no M well he was in that situation and one day he's up in the attic and he's going through a bunch of stuff and he finds this little stamp he's looking at this stamp and he says boy that's an OD looking step says I know so sold down at the shop down the street here he go St maybe I'll go down and talk to him and see what he'll get I want ice cream see he was thinking ice

[Music] $500 who turned around and he sold it for maybe a th brother br says in one of the quotes he says I think I heard something that made me around A4 million dollar for that stamp you see he was thinking like a child we think like children sometimes we don't think the way we should be thinking because when we were a child we spoke like a child we thought like a child we acted like a child but that which is perfect has come and now we are not children anymore more and we need to get zealous about something that God has given us that is greater than anything that this world could possibly offer I think about it sometimes Hallelujah sit there you know you you can sit there and you you can day dream and you think about man should buy a lottery ticket $50 million I could you know man and

God is for Paul said eyes have not seen ears have not heard we get so childish at times we get so childish in our ways we get so silly in our thinking we think like little children just like that little boy he has he had maybe A4 million dollars in his hand but he was a child he was thinking as a child he was looking at things like a child sometimes you look at things the wrong way you're not looking at things the right way you're looking in that mirror you're not seeing right next slide now what do you see in the mirror do you see yourself as a part of God's plan God's will God's God's
