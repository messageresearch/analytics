God bless you, saints. &gt;&gt; Welcome into the house of the Lord. I need some monitors. Amen. Praise God. It's good to be here this morning. We certainly uh love the uh wonderful weather that the Lord has been giving us here in the month of September. How many are enjoying that? like uh August, you know, we were getting burned up, but um by the grace of God, we are now um having probably one of the nicest uh falls that we've ever had that I can remember every day just being so uh beautiful and um comfortable by the grace of the Lord. I believe it's just a reflection of his perfection. Amen. Praise God. And so uh today we are happy that we are going to be able to dedicate um a young child today. Uh if you want to just come forward now let the um let the parents just come and sit here at the front. Amen. Praise God. We want to welcome everybody into the house of the Lord. Visitors, friends, family. Um we want to welcome those that are online. We certainly appreciate you uh tuning in to our services uh here every Sunday, every Wednesday night. Praise God. And um we just ask that if you're enjoying the services then subscribe to our channel and like the services. It's just a way of uh you know uh sharing this message uh because we are bringing uh a very uh present stage message of the ministry of Jesus Christ. And so we want this message to go um into the uttermost you know uh wherever the Lord wants to send it by the grace of God. And we know that um media um these days, social media is a very powerful instrument that's being used by many across the world. And so uh we want to use it for his glory. Amen. Praise God. So when you're on there and you're, you know, going through YouTube, stay away from the garbage. Just let your your spirit be fed on the things that that are of God so that you can receive what you have need of. Amen. Praise God. We want to also um just announce for those that don't know that uh brother Ed Biscll from uh Vancouver from Bible way has gone to be with the Lord. He's gone to receive his reward. Amen. A wonderful servant of God and um who was a good friend and witness of William Branham in the early days of his ministry. Uh brother Biscll was 90 years old when he passed. Um, but as a young man, he has quite a testimony of how the Lord moved in his life and used our prophet William Branham, the messenger for for our day, for for the day that um uh you know that he was certainly a young man at the time. And um if you get a chance, you'll want to go online and, you know, look up Ed Biscll and listen to his testimony. I am a witness. And um you'll really be blessed by it. I'm sure you'll you'll really be blessed. So, let's keep the family in prayer as they at this time, I'm sure, are missing him. And um but they also rejoice to know that he's back into that dimension. He's in the sixth dimension. He's looking at himself. He's saying, "Brother Brandom, it was the truth. Everything that we preached, it was the truth." He's seeing himself, you know, young and and full of vigor and full of the the glory and surrounded by the young sons and daughters of God, the uh uh in their theophony bodies, eternal bodies. Amen. So, we are certainly grateful for that. Praise God. And so, this morning, um we're we we're going to have a baby dedication, then we're going to have uh the word, and then we're going to have the Lord's supper. Amen. So, um, we're going to try to move as quickly as we can. We will, um, stop, uh, ministering at around 12:30 to move into the order of the service of the Lord's supper and the footwashing. And this will, um, give us an opportunity to be done at, you know, close to our regular time, maybe a few minutes after. Praise God. But just enjoy the presence of the Lord this morning. Just, uh, enter in. Come today with expectation. And I trust that you've come with expectation that the Lord will speak to your heart and give you something that will give you strength to keep pressing this tremendous gospel that God has placed upon each and every one of us for this day and for this hour. Amen. Praise God. And so, um, I love being a part of this faith community. Amen. We're a part of the mystical body of Jesus Christ. Amen. and uh you know, we're one great wonderful family of God. We can support one another. And today, we're going to have the dedication of a new child. There's a there's a new addition to one of the families within the family of God. Amen. And you know, there's a there's a an understanding that's been said that the first thousand days of a child's life are the most influential, the most powerful. It is it is a programming stage of their lives. Amen. The first thousand days and that that's from their conception when it actually becomes uh birthed in the womb of the mother. You know the mother you've seen it many times. They'll they'll caress their belly and they'll they'll feel the movement as the child is growing in their stomach and that child is already feeding off of the atmosphere and the love of the mother and the father. Amen. Praise God. And so, um, in that time frame, it's a very crucial window and it's a time that requires special nurturing and input into those children, &gt;&gt; into that baby. Amen. And so it's been known that um that there's there's like millions like there's literally a million neuron connections being made per second in the baby's brain while it's developing. It's the fastest growth and development of the bl of the brain that the child or any human being will go through is in that first thousand days of their life here in this dimension. Amen. And so it's very important, you know, that that we understand that and especially for us as a household of faith that believe God's word and know that training up our children in the way of the Lord places the token, the life of God, the the the faith that that we carry, it gets imparted unto the children. Doesn't make them sons and daughters of God. They'll have to come into their own relationship at that time and season in their lives. But by nurturing them and by by making them uh you know uh susceptible to that environment, you're creating a a a much uh a much better potential for that child. Let's just put it that way. Amen. Praise God. So today we've got Hosea and Hope that have brought their son Ryan. We've already baptized their daughter. What's her name? &gt;&gt; Leah. Yes. We've already baptized or not baptized. &gt;&gt; Dedicated. &gt;&gt; Dedicated. Amen. That brings up something, doesn't it? No, you don't want to get me preaching on that now, do you? That's just the old nature. You see, you know, you know, we we like I came out of Roman Catholicism. I went to a lot of baby baptisms. I was baby baptized. You know what I mean? But we know that there's no such thing in the scripture. Amen. We dedicate our children unto the Lord. And today, uh, Hosea and Hope, they're they're um they're they're they've decided that they want to dedicate their their Ryan unto the Lord. Amen. And you know, we as a church see that we have an important role in being supportive and creating the the kind of environment that the family along with Ryan are going to require in order to raise their children in the faith of Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise God. And so today is, you know, today is more about parents than it is children, believe it or not. Okay? You as parents have a special role in raising your children in a way that will bring glory to the Lord. Amen. And so um you know that the best decision that you could have ever made was to actually dedicate your your son and your daughter unto the Lord. Amen. There's no greater decision at this stage in their lives &gt;&gt; because what you're doing is you are placing that child into God's hands. You're placing the future, the health, the well-being, the protection. We believe in the power of the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; That that God God will honor his word that if we raise and we train up our children in his way, he will not depart from their life. He will meet them at some point and they will have to make their own decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so today, you know, Jose and Hope, you're making a public declaration that you by the grace of God and the help of his people, his family. Amen. That you'll raise Ryan in a way that'll give glory to God. Amen. And no other reason do we And now another reason that we do this in in public is because we know that it takes more than just a family. It takes a village to raise a child. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and God has given us this wonderful community of faith that we, you know, that we have certain um ability here, abilities within our our Sunday schools and and and teachers and deacons and and people that are that are there to to assist in the training of the family, guiding and directing them when there's hard times because it's not always easy. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; it's never always easy. Don't think that because you you you you dedicate this child unto the Lord that you know that things are going to get easy or that you're declaring that you're a Christian that that your life has to be a bed of ease. It's not going to be. One of the one of the most greatest challenges in this day is to actually bring children up in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a great challenge, but it also can provide great rewards. Amen. Praise God. And so today, Ryan can can know and Jose and Hope, you can both know that this community is here to support you. that when you come and support this ministry and you come and you you come with expectation to receive God's word, your purpose in coming to receive it is so that you can have the faith to train up Brian, to train up Leah, and to bring them up to know the Lord Jesus. It starts with you as the father and then with you as the mother to come under the headship and the leadership of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And so at this time, let me ask you a question. Come on, move forward and come on up here. Just going to ask you a couple of quick questions. Do you commit yourselves to nurture and care for Ryan &gt;&gt; as parents? because it's a great responsibility and you're making this declaration before us as witnesses here today. You're responsible to care for that child, Jose. You're responsible to provide for that child, for your wife, and for your children, Jose. God holds you as the head and the leader of the home to take the responsibility, to take the burden, to take the pressure of this life. Because like we said, one of the greatest challenges in this dimension right now is to serve God and to raise children to the Lord by faith. And so I'm asking you, do you commit yourselves to raise Ryan in the Christian faith and invest in his life and Leah's life spiritually? &gt;&gt; Amen. And do you commit yourselves to seeking help when times get tough and not just, you know, trying to handle everything on your own? That's what this community is for. you commit to to, you know, putting aside your your human pride when things get rough and tough and and are willing to come and, you know, call your deacon or call your pastor and say, "I need some support. I need some help." Are you committed to do that? &gt;&gt; Good. And let me ask the congregation here this morning, do you commit yourselves to creating a community of love and support around this family and their children? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. That's what the body of Christ does. That's the beauty and the the benefits of belonging to the body of Christ. You are surrounded by people of faith that believe that God can do great things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. This time I'd like to take Brian and offer him and dedicate him. Oh, how sweet. How fresh. I love the fragrance of a fresh new baby. Praise God. Let us pray. Our gracious Father, what an honor and what a privilege it is this morning, Lord, to hold this new life, Father. Lord, it's it's just a reflection of you, Lord, that you can make all things brand new, Lord. You can you can do things that are so miraculous, Father. And here we have Jose and Hope that have, Lord, that have made this decision, Father, that they want Ryan, Lord, dedicated to you. They're asking you, and we're asking you as a community of faith this morning, Lord, to join us here and to let your spirit and your anointing come upon this child. Lord, we dedicate it to you in the name of Jesus Christ. That your spirit will go before him, watch over him, that you will encamp him about with angels, oh God, protecting his every breath, his every move, his every step. Lord, may your anointing come upon Jose as a leader of the home, as the provider uh oh God, upon hope as the mother, Lord, the nurturing uh uh giver of of of this child, Lord God, may your spirit so anoint them, oh God, with your with your faith, Lord, give them a revelation, Lord, of this tremendous responsibility that you have placed within their hands, Father. Lord, let your spirit take control. And may this child one day, Lord, decide and and and make public declaration that that that I will serve the Lord. Lord God, may you go before him, watch over and direct and guide this entire family. Remember little Leah. Lord, continue to uh uh place your your spirit and hover over her life and protect and guide her. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord, we commit this entire family, this community, Lord, into your hands and we give you thanks for this new life in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Ryan, I dedicate you in the name of Jesus for his glory. Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love that. I I I really uh really appreciate the Lord. You know, anytime that um that uh there's a child to be dedicated, um I I rejoice. Amen. I rejoice. So I thank God for that. Let us continue to keep them in prayer and believe that the Lord will do a great work in their lives. Praise God. Let's change the order of the service at this time. Let's all stand. Brother Desmond, you can give this to uh the family. Amen. It's a dedication certificate. Let us pray. Father, as we now change the order of the service, Father, we're asking that your spirit now would just come. And Lord, place that anointing upon your servant to speak and upon your children to hear what exactly you would have for us today, Lord, simple as it might be, Father, but let it let it profoundly affect our hearts that we may search deeper, Lord, into that relationship with you, Father. Because truly, Lord, that is that is our desire, Lord, to walk with you and to and to have a closer walk with you. But Lord, we need your word. We need to hear what you have for us. And Lord, won't you speak to us now? Granted, Father, Lord, you're the only one that can speak to individual hearts and know every single person exactly where we're all at. Lord, I have a need. Your people have a need. Father, may you bless and prosper us now in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's go to our first scripture. Um today we're we're going to continue uh where we've started a few weeks ago. We've been looking at the purpose of God. Last week we looked at the purpose of the Holy Ghost. We're today the Lord just laid it on my heart, you know, to make it a question. What is the purpose of the Holy Ghost? We're going to be digging into it as much as we possibly can and just allow the Holy Spirit uh you know to reveal to us things that that that that we need to know. We need to hear. We need to understand in a greater way what the Holy Ghost is all about in our personal lives. Amen. Praise God. And so, let's read our scripture from Luke chapter 1 from verse 34. I know it says 35 up there, but it's actually from verse 34. It says, "Then Mary unto the angel said un then said Mary unto the angel, how shall this be seeing I know not a man?" And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age. And this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible. And Mary said, "Behold the handmade of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord add his blessings to the word of God. Amen. You know, the very first time that we hear the phrase and the words Holy Ghost are in the book of Matthew 1 verse 18. And it said it in this way. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise. When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. It's the very first time that we hear that phrase Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know um it's it's tremendous when we look at this because this is what we've you know that the Lord has led us to dive into. We want to understand why you know like like last week we talked about how you know the the hol that the spirit of God was mentioned in the Old Testament. Then the Holy Spirit was mentioned but never the Holy Ghost in the Old Testament. But yet it shows up in Matthew 1 verse 18 for the first time as the Holy Ghost being the father of the son, the child that was placed supernaturally in the womb of Mary. Amen. Praise God. Mary had no idea that there was a prophecy. Maybe she had heard maybe she had gone to church and maybe she had heard about this prophecy that you know that that a that a that you know in Isaiah I believe it was in Isaiah 7:14 where Isaiah cried out and he said therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign 700 years earlier. Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel. And what does Emmanuel mean? God with us. She had no idea that she was actually going to be the manifestation of that prophecy. Amen. There are people in this day and in this hour that don't realize that within them lays a prophecy of the Holy Ghost that's going to bring you into a manifestation as a son and as a daughter of God in this age. &gt;&gt; Mary was in that time. But what was God doing? This was a great time. This was a this was a dispensational change. We need to recognize what God was doing because we mentioned last week that the difference between Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost and the spirit of God was in that it was the same God. It's the self-existent one. It's it's the creator of all things but in different manifestations and in different dispensations. And so God here now was coming into the dispensation of the Holy Ghost where it was now going to be God in man. God was now coming to the earth to identify himself not above, not God above. Not God just with, but God in. &gt;&gt; And this is the hour. This is the dispensation that we are now continuing to to unveil the mighty God to continue to bring the word in the day that we're living in the manifestation of God in this hour. She had no idea that she would be the word made manifest in her day. But when she but but but something was in her. Something was in her. The Holy Ghost had come upon her. The scripture says &gt;&gt; it had come upon her. And when the Holy Ghost comes upon an individual, it begins a process within their life &gt;&gt; to actually identify with God. &gt;&gt; That God is actually a reality. &gt;&gt; It's one thing when the Holy Ghost comes upon an individual. It's another thing when God gives you a revelation &gt;&gt; of himself, not only with you, but in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. She had no idea that she would bring forth the Christ, the anointed Messiah, God, coming into the dispensation of God and man uniting here on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. She had no idea. The scripture in Isaiah 9:6 said, "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called wonderful." Pay attention, counselor, the mighty God. And and you know, you go out there and you ask people about the Holy Ghost and about the Holy Spirit, they'll say he's the third person in the Godhead. Three gods in one. I just read the scripture here from Isaiah and we can show you many scriptures that make it very clear there is only one God. &gt;&gt; But God changing his veil. God manifesting himself in different dispensations in different individuals. Amen. Praise God. Manifesting himself to the world. And whenever he did that and he come upon a prophet, they would get anointed with the word of God and they would say, "Thus sayaeth the Lord." &gt;&gt; They would have the word of the Lord flowing through them. Amen. And all the prophets of the Old Testament, they were all announcing the coming of the Messiah. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. And then here, a young, beautiful virgin is chosen to actually be a carrier of his coming. What a time, saints. She had no idea that she would have to bear the reproach. Let me finish that scripture. The counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father, the prince of peace. &gt;&gt; Is there anybody left out there? They just said that that son would be all of those things because God was going to come down and manifest himself in the form of a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. because he had to fulfill his word that if a man's sin, a man had to die. So he had to take on a man body in this dimension so that he could take that body to Calvary and make it the sacrifice for you and me to show that we would have a way back. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; This was his process. There was a great dispensation and a great change taking place on the earth. And a lot of people, they'll go to church every Sunday and they'll talk about, "Oh, Jesus is my savior." G. But until he's actually come in, you you can't even call him Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are told in this scripture that Elizabeth had conceived a son. God was Now look at this whole dispensation. Look at this this whole event what God was doing right at this very time when when his announcement was made to to to Mary. Not only did the angel bring the news about the coming of the Messiah, he also brought news that hey, by the way, your cousin Elizabeth, she's with child, too, and she was known to be barren. God's going to do things in such a way. Listen, when God does something, it's not going to be the way you think it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; And the world, the whole church world is believing that, oh, the coming of the Lord is at hand. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. They're always looking into the future. They're always looking to see what God is going to be doing. They're always looking back at what he did, but they failed to see what God is doing right now. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I can imagine in that day when Mary received this salutation, she she now would have to bear the reproach of the word of God. Amen. I hope you're seeing yourself somewhere in here this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; She had something in her that was able to respond back and say, "Be it unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid to accept this reproach, this reality of the Holy Ghost that's come upon me. I know what I've seen. I know I what I heard from the angel. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; She had no idea that she would have to bear this kind of reproach. But Mary was reassured when when the angel said, "Listen, your your cousin is also with child." And he and the angel was telling her, "So so don't don't think anything's impossible with God." In other words, God was raising her faith. God was placing in her a a prophecy that that she was going to actually be a part of because when she walked into the presence of her cousin Elizabeth, the the child leaped within Elizabeth's womb. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it it heard it it knew what God had said. and and and Mary at that moment, it must have just taken her her her faith to another level. Amen. God will will do things in your life that he's not going to leave you in a condition where where where you're in a condition of confusion. &gt;&gt; He will do things in your life. You just got to be open to it. You've got to be you've got to let him in. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to make a way. You got to let the Holy Spirit deal with the situations in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't be afraid of making mistakes. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're going to be looking at some things here today. Amen. Praise God. We need to know that with God, all things are possible. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that God can't do. And God was reassuring to Mary and letting her know, listen, you're going to see things like you've never seen before. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm doing I'm doing something here on earth that that that that is going to that is going to change everything. All the 4,000 years of history, everything that your fathers were teaching you, all the the all the the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the the great leaders, the religious leaders of that day, they couldn't recognize when the word was being made flesh right before their very eyes. &gt;&gt; They'd read the scripture, but they couldn't see it. They were blind. &gt;&gt; It's repeating itself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And so, you know, we looked at a lot of things last week. We said, you know, if you talk to about 80 or 90% of people and ask them about the Holy Ghost, you're going to get all kinds of different questions and they're actually going to question whether they even got it. Don't tell me that you don't question sometimes within your heart because you're you're you're in this great battle between the old nature and the new nature. You're you're you're you're you're in a world where you've come to know God and God gives you a baptism of his spirit and all of a sudden God lifts a lot of things off of your life and the very next day you're making mistakes again and you're wondering what is going on. Well, this is what we want to look into. This is what this is what we want to take a deep dive into so that we can get a better understanding of how the Holy Ghost is operating and what the purpose of the Holy Ghost is. Amen. Praise God. And so we've discovered many different things. You know, we can be anointed of the Holy Spirit. We can actually be be uh you know uh surrounded by the Holy Spirit. We can have, you know, um h the presence of God where we feel his presence and his love and yet you still are not saved. It doesn't save you. All you've done is you've come into a an anointing. You've come into a baptism. You It's like going into the water without a real experience having taken place on the inside of you to actually wash you. Because water is a representation of separation. It leaves your old life completely behind. And when true experience happens in an individual, your your entire life is flipped upside down. You're never the same. You're never the same person. Amen. Praise God. And so, we looked at all those things. But here, let's look No, here I'm just going to read this. This is a quote here that I I read last week, and and it's worth reading again. Here it says, you say, "Well, Brother Brandham, I believe." You say, "I believe." You say, "Pastor Danny, I believe, but I've never received the Holy Ghost." You know, that's a good thing if you're honest with yourself. I remember when I came to this church and I was listening to the word that was coming forth. I came to a place where I went to the pastor and I said, "Pastor Simon, I want the Holy Ghost because I did not believe that I had the Holy Ghost." And that's a good thing. If you come to a place where you don't know where, that's a good start because if you really want to go with God, you really want to walk with God, then you need to be honest with God. &gt;&gt; You need to be honest where you are right now. Now, if you don't know where you are right now, how you going to know where you're going? &gt;&gt; He says, listen, he goes on. He says, uh, he says, you no, you don't believe yet. This is what Brother Bram's saying to the to the person. No, you don't believe yet. You're right. That's good that you said that. You're just believing unto belief. &gt;&gt; You have hope. He says, you don't know nothing about it until you've received the Holy Ghost. You say, "I accept Jesus Christ as my personal savior." Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? That's the real question. He says, "If you don't, you can't even call him the Lord because he's not Lord." Lord means that he's ruling over your life. You have completely and totally surrendered unto him. &gt;&gt; He's now your Lord. Go back and study what Lord means. landlord when the when it was the landlord, he owned the land. He tell you to come on, he tell you to get off and you were completely at his mercy. Amen. Praise God. And so he says, he goes and he says he's a historical being that you have accepted. He says, he says, but when you come into but when but when he comes into you by the Holy Ghost, he is your Lord. No man can call Jesus Lord only by the Holy Ghost until you are born of the spirit of God. And the Holy Ghost is in you. Then if you are born into this kingdom and you're part of the church, the body of Christ. Amen. You're called out. You're a called out one. Then you see it. Amen. So there's something, you know, that we're being challenged by here. We're being challenged about what is the Holy Ghost and how, you know, how should it be affecting my life? Amen. Praise God. You know, you can go to the next slide. It says here, you know, in the in the message, and I just all I did was I put it into point form in the message, what is the Holy Ghost? Brother Brandham 1959. There was these these four questions, these three these three statements that he made. And number one was you cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost unless you know what it is. And then he says, "And you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you." You got to know that the that the word for this hour was meant for you &gt;&gt; because the moment that the message of the hour comes to you, it lights you up. &gt;&gt; Yes. It it immediately you you you see that everything that you've been taught when you start to compare it to the word, you can see it as clear as day that it's it's it's wrong. Like today, baby baptisms, there's no such thing as baby baptism. When you see the word for your day and it starts to shine light on the gospel, the light that's in you now, which is God's representation that he placed in you, not when you were born here into this earth. No, before you came to this earth, before the foundations of the world, there was representation that you could receive the light of this hour. And immediately you recognize that's for me. &gt;&gt; You need to come to that place. This word is for me. And then he goes on. He says, "And then you cannot know whether you got it or not unless you know what the results are that it's supposed to bring in your life. It's not supposed to just make you speak in tongues and shout and and praise God and hallelujah and sing like an angel." It's supposed to bring you back to the word. &gt;&gt; It's supposed to lead you and guide you into all truth. &gt;&gt; That's what's going to change your life. That's what's going to change your walk. It's the word. It's the word that changes your walk. Amen. It's not by you trying to, you know, go to as many camp meetings as you can and get the anointing of the spirit on you and get all excited about, you know, about God and about the minister because, oh, he can bring the word in such a way that, you know, it just really tickles my soul. He says, "Oh, your your sins are forgiven. They've been placed in the sea of my forgetfulness." Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. You need to dig deeper into that. Amen. Because when you come to the Lord and you first come into that that experience with God and you go to the waters of baptism and you get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you get buried in that water, you come out of that water as a as a as a sinless brand new baby. &gt;&gt; Your old sins are washed away. But then you go on, listen, I I I'm talking to everybody here uh this morning, okay? Everybody remembers when they got baptized and I I remembered as clear as day because God supernaturally took that drug addiction right out of my life. Boom. Gone. &gt;&gt; I was washed. my life. Whatever my past was, he made it so clear to me that that past is dead and buried. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He made that clear to me. &gt;&gt; When when you know, you know, we we think that just because God makes it clear to us that God is just going to forget. No, no. God doesn't. God is the almighty God. He knows the end from the beginning. &gt;&gt; You think God is just going to forget everything? He'll never bring it up again. I can tell you that because he stands behind his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he also knows that you're going to come up out of that water and you're going to go out back into the world and you're going to make all kinds of mistakes again. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. And you thought that you were, you know, you're you're you're life is going to be perfect from that day on. Let me tell you, World War III broke out in my life &gt;&gt; after that experience. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, God did wonderful supernatural things, but there was a mighty battle that started because the enemy does not want to let go of any of you. &gt;&gt; And don't think for one minute that you are, you know, that that, oh, I'm a Christian and I you can receive the Holy Ghost. You can actually receive the Holy Ghost and still go out there and make all kinds of mistakes. &gt;&gt; And you need to know that. You need to know that because a lot of people, they they they think that once, you know, they've they've come to church and they get baptized and they they receive the Holy Ghost that their life is going to be perfect. &gt;&gt; How many perfect people in here today? &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I had battles this week. &gt;&gt; I have to deal with mental battles. I have to deal with situations in my life. I got to deal with sin &gt;&gt; because sin people think, "Oh, I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't swear anymore." I get a bunch of you one time watch you under some pressure at work and see if that &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me you're perfect. Oh, I don't do any I I don't I don't think any sin. When I see a beautiful woman walking down the street, I just immediately turn my head. &gt;&gt; People want people want to put even within this message, they want to raise the children in such a way that they want to tell them, listen, you don't talk to any boys, you don't talk to any girls, you don't flirt with any boys, you don't flirt with any girls. And we've put so much boundaries, so much wall around these children that they don't under they don't even know how to react &gt;&gt; when they get into a real life situation because you can shelter them all you want in the house of the Lord. But I promise you for those two hours that you got them here on Sunday, you could watch them, but you're not going to be able to watch them the other seven days of the week, &gt;&gt; six days of the week. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. We're talking about a reality of serving God. Do you want to serve God? &gt;&gt; Do you want to know that the Holy Ghost has a purpose in your life? And if you can line up with that purpose, if you can come in tune with God's desire and and and will for your life that all of a sudden you can be empowered by his ability to do things in your life. But you need to be aware. You need to be conscious. You're not some clone or some, you know, some some uh you know, uh uh you know, I'm just going to I'm just going to activate this this uh app here. Activated. And now all of a sudden, you're like a robot. Comes to church. Comes in every Sunday, sits down. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God don't have robots. &gt;&gt; God has individuals with free moral agency. &gt;&gt; He wants you to serve him because you love him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you know, we could, you know, we could go on and on about the different manifestations of the Holy Spirit, but here now go to the next slide. Here's the definition of Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit. In the Bible, Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost means, and we mentioned this last week, but I just refined it down a little more, separated and set apart for the purpose of God. Now watch God's purpose in relation to, with, and in to with, and in man. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what we're interested in understanding. Because when when people say, "Oh, you need to be holy, man. What do you mean I need to be holy? You You want me to be something that I'm not? I be ye holy as God is holy." You know what makes God holy? The fact that he had a plan in his mind and a purpose that he was never going to alter. He says, "Heavens and earth are going to pass away, but my word will never pass away." &gt;&gt; Because God had a purpose in his word. God had a thought behind every thought, every individual, every person that he called. When he called Mary, he was calling you. He saw that you would see yourself in the word &gt;&gt; because you're a part of the word. &gt;&gt; You You're a part of his thoughts. So when God thinks a certain thought, that's why brother Brandham says if you don't see Jesus Christ from Genesis to Revelation, you need to go back and look it over again. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the thought of God from the beginning had you in there. &gt;&gt; And so how do you know that you've got the Holy Ghost? is when you connect with God and his thoughts by revelation. Revelation brings you into an experience where you actually start to walk with God. &gt;&gt; A lot of people go into that tank, come out of that tank, they go out and back and live in the world just the same way they were living before they went in. &gt;&gt; Why? because they have not received the revelation of God's identification and manifestation with them personally. &gt;&gt; Remember, it's God's purpose to in no uh to &gt;&gt; with and in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And until he comes in, you're just a work in process. There's a lot of us in this place that are still in process, including the guy you're looking at right here. You see, there's two natures that we're going to constantly have to deal with. Whether you like it or not, you're going to fight that nature. Just like Jacob and Esau, just like, you know, that that that the the one is going to is going to actually control the other. And at some point, you've got to come to a place where you yourself need to realize that the message of this hour, that what the Holy Spirit is doing right now in the present stage of his ministry is going to direct and guide and and and and lead those that came out even under William Branham 60 70 years ago. People are holding on to ideas of what the Holy Ghost is in this message, not realizing that they don't really have a clear understanding of the progression of the Holy Ghost. They might have it, but they need to be awakened to what he's doing now. They need to they need they need they need some revelation to bring them into the present stage of the ministry. Now let's I'm going a little bit ahead of myself. So here now when we look at this God's purpose in relation to with and in is the three-fold purpose of God. God above us God with us when Jesus Christ came and now the Holy Ghost God in us &gt;&gt; to manifest himself in the bride of this last age. Amen. Glory to God. And so we need to understand these differences. So now I want to we got 15 minutes. I'm going to take a quick sip and we're going to see how far we can get because then we'll finish this and we'll just continue. I don't know how many weeks we're going to go on this. I don't know. as I study it, there's just so much more as you go deeper into it. There's just it just keeps unveiling itself. So, I don't know how how how long, but I trust that you're going to receive what you have need of. Let's let's look here now at the Holy Spirit to Holy Ghost dispensation of what was happening back when Mary received this message that she was going to bring forth Emmanuel and that there was going to be a forerunner. That was John's prophecy being manifest right there and then too. Behold one that will be crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord. Amen. Praise God. Let's look at this dispensational change for the coming manifestation of God. Now, God was coming for the first time. God was going to manifest in man on earth and he was going to he was going to experience the whole process, the entire process. Thank you. But I got a napkin. I finally my wife says, "You need to bring a napkin up there." I said, "Yeah, I know. I keep forgetting, but thank you for reminding me to do that." And so here now, God was God was going to be for the first time, God was going to take on human flesh and he was going to come under obedience to that human flesh. We need to see this whole process that that Jesus himself, God himself was going to go through. Remember, he was a child. He was a baby. He was born a baby. He was born a He grew like a young man. He grew into a teenager. He had to he had to deal with all the same things. The Bible says that he came under obedience. obedience to the word that was within him, to the Holy Ghost, to the purpose of God that was in him. He was showing in the first fruits exactly what the word will do in your life when you receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Let's read our next scripture in John. He goes on here in in uh Matthew 3:es 9 to10. He says, "And think not to say within now you got to picture the picture the scene here now." Okay? Picture John. He's now, you know, around 30 years old because he was only 6 months older than Jesus. Okay? And here he is now and and he's got this anointing on his life that he was the one that would be crying in the wilderness. Picture he's now in the midst of all these religious organizations of the day. And as you're picturing him, I want you to picture William Branham when he came on the scene because everything runs in parallel here. And this is what this is what God has given us the ability to recognize because if we see him the same back there, we will see him the same right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And so here now he's rebuking these Pharisees and think not to say within yourselves, we have Abraham to our father. For I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise children unto Abraham. And now also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree which bringeth forth not fruit, not not not forth good fruit is heed down and cast into the fire. He's rebuking the people of that day. Why was he rebuking the people? They didn't invite him into the into the temple. They wouldn't invite a wild man like John. See, God was doing something so different, so irregular from the way that the people would have thought that God was going to come. But they failed to see the scripture that says he's going to be one a wild man that's going to be crying out in the wilderness, make ye way for the Lord. He's going to come. But they they thought he was a crazy man. A lot of people heard William Brandham. They heard his his teachings. They listen to the way he preached the word of God. They say, "This guy doesn't even know his own vocabulary properly. We got better vocabularies than he did. &gt;&gt; But he had the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's one thing that's going to catch the attention of the true sons and daughters of God. Not emotion, not atmosphere, not, "Oh, brother, that was a powerful message, man. Yeah, you because you're so charismatic, you get the people all wound up and you get them shouting and screaming." God wants you to recognize the word. &gt;&gt; That's what catches the attention of the sons and daughters of God. Amen. They failed to see the word. Amen. And now he goes on, go to the next slide. He says here in verse 11, I indeed, now he's telling them, I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear, he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And listen, here's the interpretation. whose fan is in his hand. And he will thoroughly purge his floor, and he'll gather his elect, his sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Those that have representation, those that have an attribute of God, the scripture says, those whose names were written in the Lamb's book of life from before the foundations of the world. &gt;&gt; God ain't some, you know, Mickey Mouse businessman. He's got his business all together. Amen. He knows exactly what he's doing. He knows exactly who you are. He knows when you were going to accept or reject him. You were going to do it by free moral agency. You weren't going to do it by by some robotic sensation. No, it's going to make sense to you. It's going to it's going to register in you. It's going to it's going to set off something inside of you. You don't know why, but you just believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, that's that's a true son or daughter of God. They'll tell you, "No, no, I believe God. I may not see it yet, but I believe it until I see it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I already know that with God, all things are possible. There's nothing impossible for God. &gt;&gt; Until you get to that place where the absolute is that God can do anything. Don't you put any restriction on God. The minute you do that, you've limited yourself to God's blessings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God can do absolutely anything. whatever he wants. And he says, "I'm going to gather in all the wheat into the garner, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire, and then come Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him." You think that God is going to bypass his own word? &gt;&gt; No, sir. And look what John goes on to say. I'm just going to read it. It's not up there, but I'm going to read it. But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? You see, he knew who he was. Amen. Jesus answering said unto him, suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all the word. All the word. If God is going to birth sons and daughters of God, he's going to do it the same way. He listen Jesus the purpose that he would come and become God in man was so that he could make a way for us to get back to where we were before we got caught here. &gt;&gt; We bypassed our theophes to come into this dimension. But this process that Jesus uh did 2,000 years ago was the antidote to restore us back to where we could receive our theophes right now in this age and in this dispensation. &gt;&gt; This is what we are in the process of. You having made contact by revelation to the word of God means you made contact with your eternal body. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's already hovering around you. Just like a mother just prepared to give birth to a child, the spirit is waiting for that child, the breath of God comes in, the life of God comes into that child when it takes that first breath and it becomes a living soul. Amen. Praise God. And here Jesus is saying that that when he and and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water. He went into the water. shows that he got baptized in water. People say, "I got baptized as a baby. It's good enough." It ain't good enough. You need to be rebaptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, fully immersed and buried so your old life can be left behind. &gt;&gt; And then you shall receive the gift, read it, Acts 2:38, the gift of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Praise God. A lot of people think that, oh, if I just get baptized, then I'm saved. No, that's just the beginning. Glory. And he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him. And lo, a voice from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased." So Jesus now was displaying that he was now going into his public ministry. And in order for him to go into the into the next stage of his ministry, he needed to receive the Holy Ghost. You think what? Yes. Did you hear what the voice said? This is the human vessel that I am going to put my spirit in, that I'm pleased to dwell in, to be in. Because in that Holy Ghost anointing and baptism that Jesus received right there in the water in order to fulfill the word would place him into the purpose of God to go to Calvary. It was that anointing that came on him which was the purpose of God now by the Holy Ghost by the person of God himself coming in to to to empower him to give him the power to give him the strength. Remember he was still a man but he was God and man united. &gt;&gt; He was listen when he went to Gethsemane he said oh God take away this cup. He came to the grips of having to go because he saw what he would have to face in that crucifixion. And you know that God, brother Bram said that God actually left him in Gethsemane because God could not go to the cross. The sin that was on you was taken upon him &gt;&gt; so that he could take it to the cross &gt;&gt; so that you now would have the blood, the formula, the Holy Ghost. He says, listen, there's a scripture that says that they that they that they were not empowered yet. Out of your belly shall flow rivers of living waters. It was talking about the Holy Ghost coming back on the people, but it had not yet been given up because the Holy Ghost had to come back on the people in order to start this process of bringing us back to our eternal destinations, &gt;&gt; our eternal bodies. Hallelujah. So here now, we got five minutes and then we're going to end it right here. Let's go to the next quote. Jesus brought God to human lives. This is what was taking place. God was made human. When Jesus was born, God became man that he might become fellowship with man in man to what? achieve one purpose and that is to bring to man what God is. Not what a church is but what God is. This is what's going to change and put us in the rapture. What God is. He says here Jesus came that he might present God to man and man didn't want it. Jesus came that he might and man didn't want it. The Holy Spirit comes today in like manner to present God to man which is by the Holy Ghost. But man wants to go to church wants to replace. He wants to just make a church experience the Holy Spirit in their lives. No. No. He says, watch it. It drowns his thinking. He cannot he cannot fathom it. And we must learn that God is not known by intellectual conception. God is known by the new birth, by the Holy Ghost, not by any other way. Jesus, the Bible has plainly quoted us that no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost. And if you've never received the Holy Ghost, you don't know that he is the Christ. For that's the only way &gt;&gt; that you will that he reveals himself. It's the only way that he reveals himself. Now, I want you to notice God was doing this and yet the people of that day could not recognize that he was what he was doing because John was baptizing unto repentance. Why was he bapti? Why was he offering baptism unto repentance? You ever think of that? What did they have to repent of? They see John knew that there was no way that they were going to receive God in the way that he was going to come. He knew by the way that they were treating him, by the way they had rejected him, by the way that they had rejected the word, by the way that that Herod had sent out a decree to kill all the firstborn when when the when even the the the the rumor was heard of a of a of a Messiah, he knew that the that the the the people could not receive. So they had to repent of the condition that they were in. They would never receive Christ. And those that heard John and recognized John, they received the baptism of John and they were at least now at least able to receive the Holy Ghost when it was to be made available. John knew the condition of the people just like William Branham when he came he knew the condition of the people. He saw that that the people the Holy Spirit had had revealed to him that the that that Luther had a portion of the word. Wesley had a portion of the word. Pentecost had a portion of the word. But they needed to receive the giver of the word &gt;&gt; because the baptism of the Holy Ghost only makes way for the Holy Ghost himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. They were bound by the tra their own traditions. They got bound by their own ways that they expected God to come on the scene and reveal himself and and give them the Holy Ghost. they wouldn't be able to recognize to accept John's message and being baptized opened the door for the for the new birth now to be recognized because every time there's a dispensational change, it requires a new birth. I'm going to stop right there. Next week, we're going to look I'm just going to read one quote to you and then we're going to close it off. And this is the quote. It's from spiritual amnesia. And this is what we're going to be looking at next week. A new birth is required in this hour. You need the Holy Ghost dispensation for the bride age to receive Christ in the present day. Listen what brother Bram says. He says, "You that wants the Holy Spirit, you wants the experience, not an emotional excitement. You want the Holy Ghost, the life, the germ of life inside you. and you want to get rid of that amnesia that's making you you can't identify yourself. You see, when the Holy Ghost comes into your life, it not only identifies who God is, it identifies your relationship to God. It gives you your identity. It places you in the day that you're living in to recognize the word that's being brought forth and what it is that you are actually supposed to manifest in this hour. And he says here, you can't identify yourself. You don't know where you stand. You don't know what you are. Let's get rid of it right now. There is a new birth here for you. A real genuine new birth. Praise God forever more. Let the musicians come. We're going to be looking a little deeper into this next week, saints. We're going to look at the manifestations of the Holy Ghost and the stages of our walk with God and how it is that you can actually come, you can repent, you can be sanctified and you think that you can sanctify yourself. You think that you can get sanctified. Do you know what the word sanctified means? It means God getting the things out of your life that are interfering with his purpose. That's what he wants to sanctify you from. You could be doing great things. You're in the house of the Lord every Sunday. You're there at your posted duty, but all week long you're living your old life. It's good you're in the house of the Lord every week. It's good that you're here and you're praying, but how is it affecting you in the way that you're going to go out there and draw other people to Christ? Bring that last one in. Anoint the atmospheres around your work. And and and you listen, this is this is coming to a to to a point, saints. We've we've got to get serious with the word. We can't we can't just go on the way that we are. If the Holy Ghost is just about coming to church and and you know doing a routine every week and coming up here and singing some songs and letting the preacher say a few good sermons and then we leave here and and nothing changes in our lives. No, no, no real transformation, no real change. Remember when the Holy Ghost comes in, the old nature comes under under a a a smashing. It starts to get broken. It starts to get shattered. All the things that you thought were the way that you should live and the way that you should act and and and your life, it starts to break up. It starts to it's you know, there's a work for you to do. There is a sanctification process and you're a part of that sanctification process. And when and that's why we need to assemble ourselves every Sunday, every Wednesday night because the only thing that's going to sanctify you is the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that's going to that's going to sanctify give you the power by the word. The scripture says in Ephesians, the washing by the washing of the waters by the word you get washed and you get cleansed and you get separated. Remember water is is a is a is a is is a a type of separation. Your old life, you got to leave that old life completely behind. That's the process of the Holy Ghost in your life. Not easy. But hey, he never said you're going to be perfect here. And brother Brandham said that this old nature is going to be sticky right to the very end. You're going to have to deal with this old nature. Amen. Praise God. Let me stop right there. Praise God. Let's go to the Lord's supper. Amen. Let's change the order of the service. Let the brothers prepare themselves. Amen. Let's just sing one song. Brother, are you washed by the blood? Glory to God. What key is that in? [Music] Are you washed in the blood? In the soul cleansing blood of the lamb. Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? Oh, have you been to Jesus for the cleansing? How are you washed in the blood of the lamb? Are you fully trusting in his grace? Divide. Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? Are you washed in the blood? In the soul cleansing blood of the lamb? Are your garments spotless? Are they white? As nor are you washed in the blood of the lamb. Are you walking daily by the Savior's side? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? Are you wash this moment in the crucified? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? For you are in the blood, in the soul cleansing blood of the lamb. Are your garments spotless are they white as snow are you washed in the blood of the lamb. [Music] Amen. Praise God. Let's just uh put up the um Lord's Supper presentation. Amen. Glory to God. I'm going to read here from Corinthians chap 10 16 and 17. The scripture says, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ, the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?" Paul is asking in question here. When we come into the communion, when we come into the Lord's supper, I trust we're coming in and it's about a communion within the body that the body, the bread representing the body, you should be including yourself now in this body. And the Lord's supper when we do it, we're doing it in communion by revelation that now the word is in us and that we are remembering what the Lord did. It was the it was it's what brought us together. It's what's given us communion. And that's why Paul is saying this is about communion around the revelation. The wine which represents the revelation of the word. It's bringing us together by revelation into a fellowship into a a a a supernatural uh connection and unity within the body of Christ that gives us a a a power to live and to manifest the word of God in this day and in this hour. The Lord's supper means so much more than just remembering Jesus, what he did at the cross. That's a finished work. It's finished, saints. He himself said, "It is finished." But he's now given us his word, the bread, and his spirit, the wine, so that we can now commune and live and manifest the body. and the purpose that God had in going to Calvary. And so for for we being many are one bread. See, he's he's saying now even though there's many of us here, we are the one body and one body. For we are all partakers of that one bread. We're all feeding now on the word. This is the Holy Ghost. This is his desire. This is his purpose. when we come together in the unity of the faith to take the Lord's supper. The next scripture says here in Corinthians chapter 11 verse 23-2, for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread. He understood. In other words, he Paul had a revelation of what Jesus was doing. Jesus was restoring us. He knew exactly why the bread had to be broken, why the body had to be broken, why his blood had to be spilled. Jesus, the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, imagine he was giving thanks because he knew that this was going to this was going to finish it all. It was going to finish the part that he had in order to bring us back into that fellowship with him. Amen. And he break it and he give thanks. And he break it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." Brother Desmond or Brother Phillip, would you please take the bread [Music] and give thanks unto the Lord? And let's all just bow our heads unto the Lord. [Music] [Music] [Music] Amen. After the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. Brother Desmond, would you give thanks for the wine? It's not the literal blood of Jesus Christ. It represents the Holy Ghost that's in you now. [Music] [Music] Oh Jesus. Hallelujah. [Music] Amen. Praise God. You can begin to give out the bread. Maybe another brother on each end will assist. But as this is taking place here, Paul tells us to examine ourselves to truly examine our hearts and and our lives. And you know, for this reason, you know, people living wrong, living hypocritical lives and then thinking that they can just come into the house of the Lord and eat the bread and drink the wine. Now, I'm saying that, but I'm also saying that if your heart cries out to God and truly repents and exam, that's why he says, "Examine yourself." Examine yourself and say, "Lord, I I made I made a lot of mistakes this week. I made a lot of mistakes. Lord, I need your spirit to come and cleanse me so that so that you can wipe these this sin out of my life. You can blot the sins out of my life. Blot it out of my own memory. Lord, take it away so that I can approach you in the right way. He is faithful. He is faithful to to to forgive you and to release you if you truly repent. That's what that's what the church is all about. People say, you know, I don't need to go to church. You know why you need to go to church is because you need to hear the word tell you that you are forgiven. That you it's it's where you can you it's where you can confess your faults one to another. It's where you can fellowship around the word and allow the Holy Spirit to deal with you and to cleanse you of the things of this world so that you can live a life under the purpose of God. That's a holy life. A life that's set aside for the Lord to use you in the way that he wants to use you in this day and in this hour. We're not called just to be church members. Say, "Lord, fill me with with that desire to to give testimony of what you're doing in this hour. Give me the boldness. Give me the courage to be a faithful witness of this word that you've placed in my heart. Lord, this is what the communion is about. Understanding that God wants you to know that he's in the body. He's in you. He's with you. He wants to He wants to stir you. He wants to bless you. He wants to prosper you. He wants to give you all that you have need of. But remember, it's got to line up with his purpose for your life. And that's where we need to surrender and say, "Lord, take away any of the things that are going to interfere with your purpose in my life." Examine yourself. Thank you, Lord. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh my god. [Music] [Music] Brea. [Music] [Music] At this time, let us all partake of the bread together in the unity of the spirit and Giving thanks. [Music] [Music] And now as we partake of this wine, we know that it is not transformed into the blood of the Lord Jesus, but it represents the Holy Spirit in our lives that we've accepted it, we believe it, we know what what it does, what it's to produce in our lives. We recognize it and we accept it with thanksgiving in our hearts. Blessed be the name of the Lord. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us just give thanks unto the Lord. Oh Jesus, thank you so much. Father, blessed be your wonderful name, oh God. We magnify thee, oh God. We give you the glory, Lord. We welcome you into our lives, Lord. We welcome a fresh start in our lives, Lord. Lord, a a refreshing from your presence, oh God. A fresh new start, a fresh new walk, Lord Jesus. We are so grateful, Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord God. Hallelujah. Amen. Let us let us read from St. John chapter 13. So after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again, he said unto them, "Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me master and lord, and ye say well, for so I am. And if I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example that you should do as I have done. And so at this time, we will be washing one another's feet. And as we do that, we pray for one another. We ask Lord wash away any place that they may have gone. Maybe their feet took them into some unbelief somewhere. Lord, wash it away. It represents humility when we pray one for the other. When we can take on one another's burdens and pray for one another, understanding one another, that we are human, that we make mistakes, that we can make mistakes. Don't be washing, you know, your brother's feet or your sister's feet with any kind of thought in your mind or any lying spirit that the that the enemy would try to put, oh, I know this and I know that. You don't know nothing. This is where God allows us to come and and repent and be and be washed and be cleansed of the old life and the things that we sometimes do in making mistakes as human beings. So, I'm going to have a closing prayer. I'm going to ask brother Philillip to come and close us in prayer now. And then the sisters will be able to leave and go and wash each other's feet. And the brothers will stay and we will wash each other's feet and then we will be dismissed. &gt;&gt; Oh, gracious God. We so grateful and thankful that by your grace we be partakers of this communion in remembrance of you. Lord, as we come into the second part of washing each another's feet, may you bless the saints as they wash feet. Bless everything that we do, Lord, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and take us to our various homes and bring us back the following week on Wednesday. God bless the Wednesday services and bless everything we do in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Thank you, brother Phillip. God bless you saints. Have a wonderful week. Go out and think about go back and listen to you know the messages brother Brandham ministered on what is the Holy Ghost and what was the Holy Ghost given for. go back and you're going to see and hear things that you never you just you thought, "Wow, praise God." You know, the prophet had revelation, but you know, when something comes out in its season, it's just sweet. It's just so sweet. Amen. Praise God. God bless you all.
