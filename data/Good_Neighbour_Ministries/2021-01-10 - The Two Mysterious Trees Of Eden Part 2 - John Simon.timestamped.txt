[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] glory be to god
[0:17] again we are gathered here
[0:21] on this beautiful sunday
[0:24] morning to give glory and honor to his
[0:28] great
[0:29] and mighty and wonderful name to him be
[0:32] glory honor and praise
[0:36] shall we read from the word of god
[0:40] genesis chapter 2 verses
[0:44] 8 to 9 and genesis
[0:47] chapter 3 we shall be reading
[0:51] also and the lord god
[0:55] planted a garden east
[0:59] in eden and there he put
[1:02] man whom he had formed
[1:06] and out of the ground
[1:09] made the lord to grow
[1:12] every tree that is pleasant to the sight
[1:17] and good for food
[1:21] the tree of life
[1:24] also in the midst of the garden
[1:28] and the tree of knowledge of good
[1:32] and evil genesis
[1:36] 3 now the serpent was
[1:41] more subtle than any
[1:44] beast of the field which the lord god
[1:48] had made
[1:51] and he said unto the woman
[1:54] yea had god said you shall not
[1:57] eat of every tree of the garden
[2:02] and the woman said unto the serpent
[2:06] we may eat of the fruit of the trees
[2:10] of the garden but of the fruit of the
[2:13] tree
[2:14] which is in the midst of the garden
[2:17] god hath said you shall not
[2:21] touch you shall not
[2:24] eat of it neither shall you touch it
[2:28] lest you die and the serpent
[2:33] said unto the woman you shall
[2:36] not surely die for god don't
[2:40] know that in the day that you
[2:43] eat thereof then your
[2:47] eyes shall be opened and
[2:50] you shall be as gods
[2:54] knowing good and evil
[2:58] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[3:00] good for food
[3:02] and that it was pleasant to the ice and
[3:05] a tree to be desired to make
[3:07] one wise she took off the fruit thereof
[3:13] and did eat and gave
[3:16] also unto her husband with
[3:19] her and he did eat
[3:23] and the eyes of them both
[3:27] were opened and they
[3:30] knew that they were naked
[3:34] and they sowed fig leaves together
[3:38] and made themselves a prince
[3:44] gracious father we thank thee
[3:47] for the reading of thy word
[3:50] we ask your blessing upon your servant
[3:54] and may your word go forth father
[3:58] and may it run swiftly throughout the
[4:01] earth
[4:02] to accomplish your divine purposes
[4:05] for your glory and honor in the name of
[4:08] our lord jesus christ
[4:10] amen praise god hallelujah
[4:15] my dear friends i'm so happy
[4:18] to be here once again with you
[4:22] to speak on this subject
[4:25] of the two mysterious trees
[4:30] that were spoken of in the bible
[4:33] that are in the garden were in the
[4:36] garden
[4:37] of eden last week of course we spoke on
[4:42] this very subject
[4:45] instead of this sunday's
[4:49] what we had planned to do we plan to
[4:52] have the lord's supper
[4:54] but i feel the urgency
[4:57] uh to continue with this flow
[5:01] of the two mysterious trees
[5:05] of the garden of eden
[5:09] so i believe it clearly that
[5:12] we ought to grasp the gravity
[5:16] of this confrontation
[5:20] between the evil
[5:23] venomous and sinister person
[5:27] this spirit being called satan
[5:32] and the
[5:36] elect of god
[5:39] in these last days
[5:43] in our study we discovered
[5:47] that the tree of life
[5:50] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[5:53] evil
[5:55] are really persons
[5:58] and not uh physical trees
[6:02] that are out uh they're growing
[6:05] from the ground but these
[6:09] two trees were actually
[6:12] persons the tree
[6:15] of life was jesus christ
[6:19] was there in the garden of eden
[6:24] the tree of knowledge
[6:27] science good and evil
[6:31] was also there in
[6:34] the garden of eden just as he was in
[6:38] heaven
[6:40] he was there lucifer
[6:44] was there jesus christ
[6:47] was there now we find
[6:50] after satan was cast out
[6:54] then we see the scene changing
[6:58] and here are both
[7:02] of these trees or individuals
[7:05] or persons in the midst of the garden
[7:10] of god we learned of course
[7:14] how by
[7:17] possessing and using the physical
[7:21] characteristics of the
[7:24] serpent this person
[7:27] called the serpent who of course at that
[7:31] time was not
[7:33] a snake slinking along
[7:36] the ground for the bible
[7:39] tells us that he was an upright being
[7:44] and that he was subtle or wise or
[7:47] smart or intelligent
[7:51] more than all of the other beasts
[7:54] of the field you see
[7:58] satan this serpent called the serpent
[8:01] at that time later after
[8:05] the great sin and fall of man
[8:09] god cursed him and said
[8:12] now from today upon thy
[8:16] belly shalt thou go now
[8:19] we find that he was and is
[8:22] the missing link between man
[8:26] and the animals
[8:31] of course the bible tells us you can
[8:34] look at that in your own bible genesis
[8:37] chapter 3
[8:39] and it will show you that
[8:42] this was a person
[8:46] looking like a man moving like a man
[8:50] even thinking but was the missing
[8:55] link between man and the beast
[8:58] was was so close to looking like a man
[9:03] that you you can be mistaken
[9:06] and so it is in the spirit world between
[9:10] a true believer
[9:13] and a make-believer
[9:16] there is such a thin line
[9:19] that one can be mistaken
[9:24] not realizing which is the true
[9:28] and which is the false but
[9:32] this serpent this missing link between
[9:37] man and the animal world
[9:41] could walk
[9:44] the bible tells us he could talk
[9:49] the bible also tells us he could
[9:52] reason
[9:55] and he had the physical characteristics
[9:59] whereby the bible said
[10:02] that he committed adultery
[10:05] with eve for she was deceived
[10:09] she was beguiled or defiled
[10:13] by this evil one
[10:16] working through the serpent
[10:20] to commit this act with eve
[10:24] adam's wife and
[10:27] the bible further tells us that she bore
[10:31] a son
[10:32] and his name was cain
[10:36] we know that eve of course did not
[10:40] really eat an
[10:41] apple that is just a myth
[10:45] that is just something that sounds
[10:48] uh much more decent and sounds a lot
[10:52] more
[10:53] acceptable and palatable to those who
[10:56] would like to
[10:57] hear it that way but
[11:00] it is the truth it is the word of god
[11:04] that eve really did not eat
[11:08] an apple but my friends
[11:12] she was a partaker of this
[11:15] tree of knowledge
[11:18] of good and evil
[11:22] you see she committed sexual
[11:25] sin with the tree of knowledge
[11:29] the serpent who
[11:32] of course is the originator of
[11:35] carnal knowledge which brought
[11:38] death to man through that
[11:42] particular sin now
[11:45] my aim is to show you
[11:50] that this dangerous confrontation
[11:54] that took place in the garden of eden
[11:58] this same dangerous deceiving
[12:02] confrontation is repeating
[12:06] again right now in
[12:09] our day our age while
[12:12] i'm speaking here now and beyond
[12:16] it has taken place in this day and time
[12:22] and now i also want to show
[12:25] how that the elect
[12:28] therefore must come
[12:31] in contact with satan
[12:35] in not the serpent back there
[12:39] but in religious persons
[12:44] that he can make a use of
[12:48] and speak through them
[12:52] and so the elect of this day
[12:56] must come into
[12:59] confrontation with the serpent
[13:03] in such persons
[13:06] face to face
[13:11] speaking and acting
[13:14] like religious people
[13:18] and uh they'll even claim
[13:21] to be christians and yet he will be
[13:25] working through that vessel to
[13:28] accomplish
[13:29] his goals and his aims
[13:33] yes my friends it's a dark hour
[13:38] it's a deceiving hour the most deceiving
[13:42] are the most deceiving day that we have
[13:45] ever seen
[13:47] for it's written by the prophet
[13:49] zechariah
[13:50] there shall be a day which shall not be
[13:54] dark nor light but at
[13:57] evening time it shall be light
[14:01] my friends i believe we are living in
[14:04] that dark day
[14:05] that dismal day that day as of a
[14:09] twilight time
[14:11] when darkness is now turning
[14:14] back to light when the sun
[14:17] my friends the sun is
[14:20] up for the elected of god
[14:24] the true children the sons and
[14:27] daughters of the living god who have
[14:30] committed themselves
[14:32] to live for him to love him to
[14:35] serve him all praise be to his
[14:38] marvelous and wonderful name
[14:43] now this day of religious deceit
[14:50] this religious receipt will be so close
[14:54] and so appealing to our human
[14:58] senses that we will
[15:02] humanly not be able to detect it
[15:06] for even jesus said that
[15:09] this will deceive the elect
[15:14] if it were possible it would deceive
[15:18] even the elect if it were possible
[15:23] you see my friends only
[15:27] hebrews 44 12
[15:32] is really going to help us
[15:35] the word of god is quick
[15:38] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[15:42] and is a discerner of the hearts and the
[15:45] thoughts and the intentions of man
[15:48] and the divider oh praise god hallelujah
[15:52] lord of the great holy spirit
[15:55] working through the believer is able to
[15:59] separate
[16:00] true from faults my friends
[16:03] oh praise his wonderful name
[16:06] and it's only by hebrews 4
[16:10] 4 12 in you that you will be able
[16:15] to discern that it's only having god's
[16:19] token or a peace
[16:22] a token of god dwelling within you
[16:27] by which you are able you
[16:31] by or by which you are enabled
[16:34] to discern between good and evil
[16:39] for if we live in a day when the
[16:42] deception
[16:43] is so great that some call
[16:47] evil good and good
[16:50] evil listen
[16:53] god of this evil age paragraph 27
[16:57] 38 oh
[17:01] the real eve my friends
[17:05] she will be tried by the word
[17:09] tried by the word just like
[17:13] eve in the garden of eden
[17:16] the serpent came and he quoted
[17:20] the word of god to her and it was the
[17:23] word
[17:24] did not god say and then he
[17:27] quoted what god said but
[17:31] quoting it and misplacing it
[17:34] misrepresenting it
[17:35] dislocating it oh my friends
[17:38] we cannot do that in this day
[17:42] we must not dislocate misrepresent we
[17:45] should not do it
[17:46] my friends the word of god
[17:49] must stay in its rightful place and be
[17:52] spoken in its precise position
[17:56] to accomplish what it was set here for
[17:59] glory to god hallelujah amen
[18:02] you see the serpent today just as he was
[18:06] back then
[18:07] is going to be quoting from the bible
[18:10] he'll be calling from the message
[18:12] just you a little twist here or a twist
[18:14] there
[18:15] and it it'll troll
[18:19] a lot of people off of the word of god
[18:23] but the elect can not be deceived more
[18:27] than god himself can be deceived
[18:31] for in them he has placed
[18:34] a typos for the soul he has placed
[18:38] the rock of ages
[18:42] in them for the foundation stone
[18:46] was laid in them from before the
[18:50] foundation of the world
[18:52] the foundation stone the keystone the
[18:55] capstone
[18:56] in actual fact it is the same stone
[19:00] of the living god just as it marched
[19:02] through
[19:03] time amen it was our foundation
[19:06] it's the key to the word and holds
[19:09] everything together
[19:10] and then it's the capstone the headstone
[19:14] the husband of the entire body
[19:17] of the lord jesus christ amen
[19:21] oh praise god hallelujah amen
[19:24] now that serpent true such
[19:28] persons will caught the word quote the
[19:32] cops of the message amen
[19:35] hallelujah but you see
[19:38] i know the difference you know the
[19:42] difference if you're a true seed of god
[19:45] between the written word
[19:48] and the revealed word of god
[19:52] hallelujah amen you see i might not even
[19:56] sometimes
[19:57] understand with my head
[20:00] what the written word is saying
[20:05] even though i'm well acquainted with
[20:08] the english language
[20:12] and the various tones
[20:16] and the various lights and levels of the
[20:19] language
[20:20] but in my head or brain i may not
[20:23] understand the written word hallelujah
[20:28] but by revelation i understand
[20:32] what the written word is saying
[20:35] what it is saying what it is making
[20:38] known
[20:39] in this day day and time hallelujah
[20:42] in other words i know by the revealed
[20:45] word
[20:46] what the reveal what the written word is
[20:49] saying
[20:49] let me repeat that i know
[20:53] by the revealed word what the
[20:57] written word is really saying hallelujah
[21:01] only the activity and
[21:04] action of the holy spirit
[21:07] can do that my friends oh
[21:10] that is what we all need to be filled
[21:14] with god's spirit our lamps
[21:17] filled and clear look up our redemption
[21:21] is near
[21:22] oh glory god hallelujah amen
[21:26] listen as adam's bride was tried
[21:30] by the word and adam's bride
[21:34] believed every bit of the word
[21:38] all but got confused on
[21:42] one word oh my hat not god said
[21:47] one promise and this is repeating again
[21:53] in our day in our time
[21:59] we are to experience this test
[22:03] this word test
[22:07] tested by the very word
[22:10] that we claim to believe hallelujah
[22:15] failed on one promise
[22:19] under the temptation of the
[22:22] enemy face to face i want to stress that
[22:27] this now being
[22:30] fair to eve that was back there
[22:33] the serpent as or in a person
[22:38] spoke to eve and tempted her
[22:42] and deceived her with a
[22:45] temptation doing it face to face
[22:51] and now that is being repeated again
[22:56] literally satan
[22:59] speaking out of the mouth
[23:02] mind and life of religious
[23:07] individuals claiming to be christians
[23:10] preachers claiming to be your brother
[23:13] like cain claiming that that they are
[23:16] judas
[23:18] like that they claim all these claims
[23:21] right by you
[23:23] using the same word for they know it
[23:26] just as much as you do
[23:29] to test you by the very
[23:32] word that you are supposed to believe
[23:36] amen listen
[23:40] we had to come in contact again
[23:44] by the same thing a serpent again
[23:48] but in a being or person
[23:52] hallelujah listen
[23:56] not just denominational truth
[24:01] we are not to be tested just by
[24:05] denominational truth
[24:08] for that would not deceive us
[24:14] or something like that but to be
[24:18] tested by every word of god
[24:23] you will be tested by the genuine
[24:25] message the genuine
[24:27] bible the genuine word of god
[24:31] amen in the beginning
[24:34] man was given the word to live by
[24:40] one word rep misrepresented
[24:44] by a man a person
[24:48] called satan in the person of an
[24:52] animal called the serpent
[24:57] satan in this person could
[25:00] talk to eve have a discussion
[25:04] with eve a conversation with her
[25:08] and in doing so he misinterpreted
[25:13] the god's word to her
[25:16] and she was lost and it
[25:19] is happening again my friends
[25:22] it is happening again
[25:26] be vigilant be watchful
[25:29] oh keep your eyes upon jesus
[25:33] oh praise his marvelous name
[25:37] for the blessed holy spirit in our lives
[25:40] in our hearts
[25:41] if you do not have the holy spirit
[25:45] if you are not sure whether he lives in
[25:48] your heart
[25:49] by faith then raise up your heart
[25:52] and hands to god and ask god
[25:56] o gracious heavenly father grant to me
[26:00] the fullness of your holy spirit
[26:04] that i may have the wisdom of solomon
[26:08] to know your will and your word
[26:12] and then all other things
[26:15] gifts virtues all other graces and gifts
[26:20] will be given on to me hallelujah
[26:24] if i seek you first you
[26:27] the word made manifest in this
[26:31] hour then all those other riches
[26:35] of the glories of god will be
[26:38] made known to me by the great holy
[26:41] spirit the teacher
[26:43] of john chapter 14. oh praise
[26:46] god hallelujah amen yes sir
[26:49] the same thing is happening again the
[26:52] serpent
[26:53] standing there in the person
[26:56] face to face with you
[27:00] and using the word of god claiming to
[27:04] have
[27:05] have fellowship having fellowship
[27:08] so called with you as he did with eve
[27:12] in the garden here he comes
[27:15] but this time he comes again under the
[27:18] guise of christianity
[27:21] under the guise of a seducing an
[27:23] enticing spirit
[27:25] he comes again under the enticement
[27:29] of using the word of god which causes
[27:33] many believers to let down or drop their
[27:36] guard
[27:37] for what they're hearing is the word of
[27:40] god
[27:42] and then he just puts a little twist of
[27:44] his
[27:45] tail upon it amen
[27:48] yes sir so these persons
[27:52] standing before me standing before you
[27:57] with satan in them literally
[28:03] speaking through them directly to you
[28:07] and you can only discern it by the word
[28:11] not outwardly looking on whether they
[28:14] are well dressed or
[28:15] or whether the guy is by the roadside or
[28:19] whether he is poor
[28:20] or or already is uneducated or whether
[28:24] he is highly educated
[28:25] oh that has nothing to do with it he may
[28:28] be a highly educated
[28:30] devil he may be a highly educated
[28:32] scholar
[28:34] and still filled with the holy spirit
[28:37] in the casting out of devils i've seen
[28:40] the great
[28:40] principles of great colleges
[28:44] and uh uh being prayed for
[28:47] and demons lo and behold was coming out
[28:51] of them
[28:52] with all the knowledge all the wisdom so
[28:55] we can't discern it
[28:56] outwardly just by looking at those
[28:59] things
[29:00] we are tested by the word and we in turn
[29:04] test him by the word of god
[29:07] for he said to jesus
[29:10] i can give you the entire world and all
[29:14] of its glories and riches
[29:16] but jesus said but it is written amen
[29:19] oh my but he's it's written also but
[29:22] jesus
[29:22] but it is also written so it's the
[29:25] greatest battle ever thought
[29:28] it's god versus satan
[29:31] it's christ versus satan in this last
[29:34] day
[29:35] christ in the believer battling
[29:38] against satan working through the spirit
[29:42] of the world
[29:43] and persons who he can reflect himself
[29:47] through now of course we know
[29:52] such a person is not really going to
[29:56] deny god
[29:57] uh satan the bible tells us
[30:00] satan believes that there's a god and he
[30:03] trembles because he knows at the end of
[30:05] the age
[30:06] he's headed for the pits and so
[30:10] it's foolish when a man or a woman says
[30:13] there is no god for even the devil knows
[30:16] that there is a god and he's going to
[30:18] answer for his crimes he's going to
[30:20] answer
[30:21] for the wrong that he has done he's
[30:24] going to answer for
[30:26] it so he's not he's not going to deny
[30:29] god and he does not deny there is a god
[30:34] and he's not going to deny that there's
[30:36] a prophet
[30:37] and that this man william branham is a
[30:40] prophet
[30:42] uh and he may even
[30:45] uh my friends be more uh
[30:48] fluent than you are more knowledgeable
[30:53] than you are
[30:54] in the bible in the scriptures
[30:58] and he can quote them to you
[31:02] and you are going to stand there and you
[31:04] are going to quote
[31:05] revelation to him and he is going to
[31:07] quote
[31:08] scripture to you he's going to quote
[31:11] written word to you
[31:12] while you are quoting and speaking
[31:14] revelation
[31:16] to him amen and so
[31:21] the battle goes on like that
[31:24] amen listen praise god and the reason
[31:28] why that this is also deceptive
[31:32] because you're both quoting from the
[31:35] word
[31:36] one by revelation and one
[31:40] by just the written word
[31:43] using it for the spiritual deception
[31:48] and it's so close because you are
[31:51] speaking
[31:52] using the same word by revelation and he
[31:56] is using that word as is holding on to
[31:59] his
[32:00] substitute for that
[32:04] substitute was given
[32:08] until the real comes on the scene
[32:12] or the fullness of the word
[32:15] comes on the scene or the logos
[32:19] comes on the scene but his
[32:22] safety his safety
[32:26] is holding on to the rima
[32:29] or the written word physically
[32:32] written he can hold on to that
[32:35] uh he cannot go out launch out
[32:39] into the deep he cannot launch out
[32:43] unless god takes him out there my friend
[32:46] and so he holds his substitutes but the
[32:50] real believer
[32:51] stands by the re present
[32:56] revealed word of god for the hour
[32:59] and its action through their hearts and
[33:02] through
[33:03] their lives amen praise god hallelujah
[33:07] oh my he stands by thy written word
[33:10] not knowing that the written word is
[33:13] just for the seven
[33:14] church ages the written word
[33:18] is there for the seven church ages
[33:22] but the written word my friends
[33:25] does not bind does not uh hold the man
[33:30] or the woman that is being set free
[33:34] upon the eagle's wings by
[33:37] revelation for they are now in the
[33:40] eighth day
[33:42] they are in a different age
[33:45] rich in the stature of a perfect man
[33:47] brother branham called
[33:49] the eternal church age they have come
[33:52] out of those ages and they are
[33:55] in the s eternal
[33:59] church age said oh i'm waiting for that
[34:02] hour
[34:03] when that man that woman that will
[34:07] enter into that eternal church age at
[34:10] the
[34:10] ending of the seals oh glory be to god
[34:13] hallelujah
[34:15] amen yes sir thank god my friends
[34:19] think about it hallelujah
[34:23] the word of god is true and real
[34:27] and that is why some are still
[34:31] caught unconsciously
[34:34] not accepting or taking
[34:37] what the prophet of this day the 20th
[34:41] century prophets has said
[34:44] they don't understand that a a prophet
[34:47] is a divine
[34:48] interpreter of the word of god
[34:52] amen oh and we cannot rise
[34:56] above the the prophet of the
[34:59] hour of the age or today
[35:02] much less to think that you are going to
[35:04] challenge him
[35:06] and you are going to this all the
[35:07] knowledge you're going to display
[35:09] is human knowledge human wisdom human
[35:12] geology
[35:13] human apologetics yeah you're gonna
[35:16] display those things
[35:17] marvelously and wonderfully yes sir
[35:20] but listen a prophet is an interpreter
[35:25] of the word of god and he is the
[35:28] personification
[35:29] of the interpretation of the word
[35:33] of god hallelujah well you might say
[35:36] oh it's written in the word of god it's
[35:39] written in the message and right away
[35:42] those kinds of spirits will say
[35:44] show me where it is show me in the bible
[35:49] show me where the prophet said that give
[35:52] me the chapter
[35:53] or the verse and if you cannot give them
[35:56] they said where did you get that from uh
[35:59] that's maybe your own thoughts
[36:01] your own ideas oh my friends they'll
[36:05] walk away
[36:06] from you shaking their heads and not
[36:09] realizing
[36:11] what they have done thinking that you
[36:13] are wrong
[36:15] not knowing that unconsciously they took
[36:18] away
[36:19] from the word of god oh glory to
[36:23] god hallelujah you were tested
[36:28] by reason tested
[36:31] by reasoning through the very word of
[36:35] god you're supposed to believe
[36:38] and that is happening right now
[36:42] it's taking place or praise
[36:45] god and god is allowing it
[36:49] to test you and prove you in the
[36:52] wilderness
[36:54] that he will see if you will stay
[36:58] with this revealed word of the hour
[37:02] as much as job was tested to see if he
[37:05] would stay
[37:07] with the word for the hour
[37:10] even if everything else was taken from
[37:13] him
[37:14] would he stand with god's
[37:18] god's few would he stand with god's word
[37:21] will you
[37:22] stand with the promise of the day would
[37:24] you stand with a god set
[37:26] prophet with a message for this age
[37:29] generation
[37:30] for you this message was said oh glory
[37:33] to his marvelous
[37:34] wonderful name oh praise god saints of

[37:48] season don't be deceived and don't miss

[37:58] earth

[38:02] be willing to hear be willing to repent
[38:05] hallelujah and repent of any
[38:08] lukewarmness

[38:13] wisdom
[38:14] and he will certainly grant it to you
[38:18] amen for this bride has one
[38:21] interest is to know that she has that
[38:24] birthright

[38:29] manifesting in and through her for his
[38:33] glory
[38:33] and honor amen praise god i'm just
[38:37] preaching the word
[38:42] simple messy rough
[38:45] it may seem in my style my way of
[38:48] speaking for this is the way i was built
[38:51] oh my but friends one thing i know
[38:56] is when the word of god is preached
[38:59] the holy spirit rides on the word
[39:03] or follows the word to perform
[39:06] whatever that word says amen
[39:10] long after i've left this uh platform
[39:15] the holy spirit will be following
[39:19] my words god's words
[39:23] spoken through me will follow the word
[39:28] and it will hound you and
[39:32] follow you and take the word
[39:36] into the heart of the elected
[39:40] wherever they are in this
[39:43] world this wide world that we are living
[39:46] in
[39:46] he'll find his children for his
[39:49] sheep my sheep hear my voice
[39:53] and a stranger they will not
[39:57] follow oh glory to god hallelujah oh
[40:00] friends
[40:01] let's stay with god's word in every way
[40:04] hallelujah let's run quickly up the
[40:07] mountain
[40:08] let's find ourselves in the capstone
[40:12] for this day and the hour hallelujah
[40:15] and let's have this confidence that the
[40:18] father has promised
[40:19] he will reveal this to his
[40:22] bride wherever she may be
[40:25] whether she is by herself in the woods
[40:28] up on the mountaintop down in a valley
[40:30] in some far-off country
[40:32] on the sea god promised when you hear it
[40:35] it will ring a bell within your soul
[40:39] it'll make contact you may not
[40:41] understand what up here
[40:43] but something in here is going to tell
[40:45] you that's right
[40:46] that's the truth that's the word of god
[40:50] and you'll know that it's not just uh
[40:53] brother john simon standing here and
[40:56] speaking or bringing the word of god to
[40:58] you
[40:59] but the holy ghost has to take that word
[41:03] and confirm it within your soul
[41:06] all my friends i commit you to him
[41:09] for there are many out there
[41:12] they watch the people that are elected
[41:16] or are of that bride
[41:20] i want to walk like her talk like her
[41:22] act like her
[41:24] amen oh my but i tell you friends
[41:30] it's different once you have
[41:34] caught the genuine revelation
[41:37] of the spirit of god
[41:41] you have entered into another dimension
[41:48] and then you begin to walk in a world
[41:52] alone with god
[41:55] you and god alone walking of course
[41:58] there are others
[42:00] that you will meet walking the same road
[42:03] but when you have caught this revelation
[42:07] you are walking in a dimension
[42:10] with god alone
[42:15] and then you find that you're not
[42:17] impersonating
[42:20] you're not impersonating you are
[42:23] just following the leading of the holy
[42:26] spirit
[42:27] for you don't have to impersonate you
[42:29] don't have to presume
[42:31] uh whatsoever or may i say it along the
[42:35] classical lines or the lines of literary
[42:38] classic
[42:39] we are not trying to
[42:43] imitate the life of christ
[42:47] or to produce an imitation
[42:51] of the life of christ
[42:54] for this is the real thing him
[42:58] in you are i
[43:01] and he is living his own true life
[43:04] through us and bringing glory
[43:08] to his own marvelous name
[43:12] now these two trees
[43:17] in eden won the tree of life
[43:20] jesus christ the other the tree of
[43:24] knowledge
[43:26] and we know my friends
[43:29] that we cannot depend
[43:32] on human knowledge
[43:36] we don't even have to try to figure out
[43:39] what god
[43:40] says we are just asked to believe
[43:47] to trees knowledge
[43:51] and revelation or faith
[43:55] and you don't get revelation by study
[44:00] though study is good but you don't get
[44:04] revelation
[44:05] genuine revelation just by comparison
[44:10] text on text on text uh quote unquote on
[44:14] gold
[44:14] yeah that's wonderful keep it up but
[44:18] it's not by that it's by the genuine
[44:21] supernatural revelation of the holy
[44:24] spirit you don't get it by studying
[44:26] books
[44:27] you know you find god
[44:30] on your knees you don't get god
[44:34] by genealogy you get god
[44:38] by neology and that's the way
[44:42] think of it two trees in the garden
[44:46] let me be just a little bit uh clearer
[44:49] on this
[44:51] one of them coating
[44:54] my friends i want to coat and i want you
[44:57] to be able to
[44:58] follow here when their eyes were opened
[45:03] branham speaking remember them two trees
[45:07] in the garden of eden
[45:09] how many knows that one of them
[45:13] was the tree of knowledge the tree of
[45:16] science
[45:19] see the other was the tree
[45:22] of faith as long as man
[45:26] eat from the tree of faith he lived
[45:30] but the first bite he took
[45:34] from the tree of science
[45:38] science knowledge
[45:42] he immediately separated
[45:46] himself from god and
[45:49] destroyed himself and
[45:52] every time man
[45:55] bites eats from the tree of science
[46:00] he destroys himself
[46:03] now do you understand now why science
[46:07] which is really good
[46:10] and evil
[46:13] it's good for science is producing
[46:16] wonderful medicines wonderful helps
[46:20] wonderful uh things but on the other
[46:23] hand
[46:25] it's evil a tree of good
[46:30] and of evil
[46:33] notice man destroys himself
[46:40] he bit off gunpowder from that tree
[46:44] and he kills his friends his comrades
[46:50] man bit off knowledge
[46:53] of automobile
[46:58] from that tree of science and
[47:01] with it automobiles he kills more
[47:05] people than all the wars put together
[47:09] oh think of it science destroys
[47:13] what faith builds i have
[47:17] nothing against the tree of science
[47:21] or knowledge it has done
[47:24] wonders yes
[47:27] but you cannot depend on that tree
[47:33] we must depend on our faith
[47:37] for faith is everlasting
[47:40] believe on god
[47:44] believe he is raised from the dead
[47:48] he says life forevermore hallelujah
[47:52] oh don't go back to that
[47:55] scientific way of
[47:58] high breeding splitting here and mixing
[48:01] there and splitting and mixing
[48:04] and everything else get away he says
[48:07] from the scientific way of hybridin
[48:10] what a mess man has got himself into
[48:14] trying to take science now to split an
[48:18] autumn look what mess he is in
[48:21] right now god just lets him
[48:24] destroy himself oh come away from that
[48:28] hybrid tree
[48:29] get over here to the original fruit
[48:33] that's got life in it and eat
[48:37] of him eat of him
[48:40] praise god oh hallelujah brothers
[48:43] and sisters that is what we are supposed
[48:45] to do
[48:46] is to eat by faith of him
[48:50] and then we'll be saved will be healed
[48:54] we'll be having peace of mind happiness
[48:58] joy and the blessing of almighty god
[49:02] oh my one tree defiled
[49:06] and the other one that came from heaven
[49:09] that tree of life
[49:11] he said your fathers at manna in the
[49:14] wilderness
[49:15] and they are dead but this tree if you
[49:19] eat of it you will live forever amen
[49:22] hallelujah amen praise god brother
[49:26] sister
[49:27] i tell you god's word is real and true
[49:31] one tree
[49:35] gives us access to the new birth
[49:39] the other one brings death
[49:42] think of it the tree
[49:45] of life gives us access
[49:49] to the new birth which was the original
[49:53] birth by which we were supposed to be
[49:55] born
[49:56] by the spoken word
[50:00] as it was at the birth of jesus christ
[50:05] or choose the tree of knowledge
[50:09] where there's another kind of birth
[50:12] contrary to god's original plan
[50:16] but allowed by him since it is in the
[50:19] world
[50:20] oh friends i tell you friends
[50:26] if we eat from that tree of life
[50:29] your pre you're gonna eat from it if
[50:31] you're predestinated
[50:33] to eat from it hallelujah
[50:36] or praise god and then
[50:39] they'll try to all the bugs and
[50:41] everything else
[50:42] restoration of the bright tree will seek
[50:45] to eat and chew
[50:47] and smash and criticize and
[50:50] see everything against that tree but
[50:53] that tree my friends is not gonna die
[50:56] hallelujah because the inside of
[50:59] of them they're holding their the
[51:02] the predestinated word of god
[51:06] the sword seed of god is in them
[51:10] and they'll bring forth or be mad
[51:12] manifest
[51:13] in his season praise
[51:16] god and i'm close let me close with this
[51:19] thought
[51:21] when you get as high as you can get
[51:25] on knowledge now
[51:28] that tree of knowledge is all right
[51:32] i want you all to understand i'm
[51:34] speaking on the topic
[51:35] so that you may have a balanced clear
[51:38] full understanding
[51:40] brother branham myself i'm not speaking
[51:44] against
[51:45] knowledge or speaking against science it
[51:48] has its place
[51:49] it has its use for it is a tree of
[51:52] good and evil it's a tree
[51:56] where they will hit the truth the right
[52:00] but then they'll miss over here but with
[52:03] this tree of life
[52:06] it's always right it's always truth
[52:09] it's always revelation so
[52:12] when you get as high as you can on
[52:15] knowledge
[52:17] now as long as you can get there
[52:22] after that believe
[52:25] that's what you have to do after you
[52:28] can't figure it out
[52:30] any longer and don't know
[52:34] then only believe
[52:37] that's the time you must believe
[52:41] when you can't figure it out then open
[52:44] your heart
[52:45] i will come by faith
[52:48] hallelujah only
[52:52] believe only
[52:56] believe all things are
[53:00] possible only
[53:03] believe only
[53:08] believe only
[53:12] believe all things
[53:15] are possible only
[53:21] believe only believe my friends
[53:25] take in all the knowledge you can get
[53:28] take all the education that you can get
[53:32] but when you come to the end of your
[53:34] thoughts on
[53:35] anything don't
[53:38] fuss fret and fume about it
[53:42] go into the realm of faith and believe
[53:45] god and god will reveal it
[53:48] make it known show it to you bring it to
[53:51] pass
[53:52] and glorify his great name do you
[53:54] understand what i'm trying
[53:56] to say here hallelujah oh praise
[53:59] god hallelujah amen to those of you who
[54:02] are
[54:03] in school or at school remember paul had
[54:06] all of that but what paul was saying is
[54:10] not that he threw away his education
[54:13] but he said i i set it aside i counted
[54:16] down and ash that i might win christ
[54:20] revealed in his own word that might know
[54:24] him in the power of his resurrection
[54:28] and in the fellowship of his suffering
[54:30] may god forgive
[54:31] give us of our sins may
