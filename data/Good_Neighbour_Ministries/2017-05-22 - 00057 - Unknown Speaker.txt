TRANSCRIPT
========================================
6 11 praise the Lord I'm glad I'm a Chris I'm serving the lord I'm reading my Bible believe in God it's wonderful despite all the trials test all the mockings and scoffings I'm glad I'm a Christian I'd rather be a Christian than to be back out there in the world Amen 1 Corinthians 2 6-1 and let's read and shall we read with our understanding before we read I'm just going to have a brief word of prayer as we break the bread of life a gracious Heavenly Father once again we are represented here we are in your house and father uh we come with our weary bodies but our Spirits are awake and alert for the truth of God's word we pray that you will anoint the written word send the fire of God upon it and cause it to live and open our open eyes that we may recognize who we are where we come from from where we are going the Journey of life we commit ourselves to thee now father bless each one father and strengthen Us in this hour what a great day to be aligned in when the race is almost done and the Sun is setting in the M thank you Lord take praise honor and glory in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of God Amen and amen God bless you praise God forever more Hallelujah let's read how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world not theology nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in the mystery even the hidden wisdom which is which God ordained before the world World unto our Glory this hidden wisdom was left there for us to glorify us amen praise the Lord amen which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have ever entered into the heart of man the things which God had prepared for them that love him praise God Hallelujah for God hath revealed them unto but God has revealed them unto us the princes of this world didn't know it the theologians didn't know it nobody knew it but God has revealed it to us amen what a day don't take the seals lightly don't take the message lightly that God has chosen you one out of a million to reveal his word for this power to you thank you Lord people just go n l through the message oh I believe the message and is a sing song and I go to church and come home go to church come home and it becomes more of a habit and a tradition more than a revelation that's right but when you begin to recognize but wait a minute you know he he loved me amen D he saved me rising in Justified barely cared my S far away here I am now and the god of Heaven has opened the eyes of my heart that I might recognize in the word what nobody else could do he gave us the ability amen and made us to be seers of the word knowers of the word amen praise God and when he knocks on your heart you recognize him the word praise the Lord word to God Amen so eyes have not seen nor Nor Ear heard neither have it entered into the heart of man the things which God had prepared for them that love him for God but God had revealed them unto us by his Spirit not theology you're just reading your Bible and a wor of Life all of a sudden the scripture you read suddenly opens up amen doesn't look like much that's Revelation brother B said that's the most powerful thing Satan hates it you know why if you are reading a theology book or you reading one of the Bible studies that they normally give on TV or or whatever the devil can read he's reading the same thing you read you I'm saying but when God brother BR said comes and reveals something to a man it's in his heart devil doesn't know that he said he only knows when you act on or if you went and talked about it before you acted on it he said and I know better to talk about it before I act on it he says revealed to me I act on it before Satan has a chance to do anything and then you'll see the miracles of god right amen praise the Lord hallelujah so Revelation is our strength that's right that's why he said don't think about what you're going to say oh I study the message longer than you I that doesn't mean nothing like that amen because it's all by Revelation that's why a child could could step up here and God could speak for a child amen God just needs a body he doesn't need your knowledge your wisdom God bless you praise God for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God know no man but the spirit of God God bless you please be seated so it's wonderful to know that God has revealed this unto us and that he uh prepared this and reserved it and now is the season when he's revealing to us but what i' like to uh really get at here is as last Sunday I was speaking about the seed and how Jesus said that he was the corn of beat and it was necessary for him to die and to fall into the ground and if he didn't die and fall into the ground then uh he would abide alone and and like that now Paul is saying if the princes of this world knew they would not crucified the Lord Of Glory in other words God we we serve a god with a plan do you believe that our God is not a random God he just does things wild and like that even when the appears like on the day of Pentecost it appears like it was fin theism but it was not because it was with a plan is that right it was an orderly chaos if I might say that the contradictory terms of course but it's trueth orderly chaos that's brother R said rain doesn't come just like that out of the sky it's got to be ragged Jagged black and booming and then the rain come he said it always looks like confusion going on but in the middle of that God comes on the scene amen so in the same way Jesus in the unveiling of God brother Ben said that Jesus spoke in Parables and the reason why he spoke in Parables was to hide it from the devil and his children but to reveal it to his his own his God God's children that's why he said unto you is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom to the disciples but onto the Pharisees and sades it is not given it's a par to them it's a mystery to them what's the Revelation to us is that right praise the Lord and here it is he spoke everything in Parables to Blind the devil so he couldn't understand what God's plan was but God's plan was like anything a man's seed or children are in him amen Eve was in Adam the entire human race was back there in Adam you know if you have heard the parable that you may be able to count the seeds of an apple that are in an apple but you can't count how many apples will come out of that one seed right right it's the same thing Jesus was speaking that in a parable that it's necessary for me the corn and wheat The Original Seed to go into the ground so that I can multiply myself but he spoke in the par so the devil they didn't understand and the prince of this world if he knew better he would not that's the worst thing he did was to crucify the Lord Of Glory and to bury a seed you know what you're doing you're not killing it you're already killing the seed when you burier you're actually given a chance to germinate and to live amen and that's exactly what the devil uh tried himself in other words the snake is so vicious that he bit his own tail and and and Christ himself de killed death amen praise God and so here it was that uh if he said we speak the wisdom of God in the mystery uh which God ordained before the world unto our Glory yes that's which none of the princes of this world knew for had they know that they would not have crucify the Lord Of Glory you understand we would have been still locked in him that's right right praise God we would have been locked in him if the devil had not crucified the Lord so when he Cru SP the Lord out of him came the blood the Holy Ghost Amen brother B said the red part fell on the ground and the the spirit part of it you know went off and came back down the de phost Acts chapter 2 came back down upon us but praise the Living God that in another place he says but that blood he said the blood the church is the blood of Christ by the holy spirit being in heart am is that right you recognize when the Bible tells us that life is where in the blood is that right so each one of us is similar to a blood costle of God with the life of God in you dilating and manifesting God's life in you so the life is in the blood of the church is the blood of Christ by the Holy Ghost that's why symbolically when he shed his blood the red part that you could see that part fell on the ground amen r fell on the ground that's where it fell praise God when we are here we are part of this Earth and we are now redeemed Earth Redeemed by the blood of Christ amen redeemed Earth Redeemed by the Precious Blood of the Lord hallelujah I also spoke to you on and then I mentioned how that Jesus himself uh was the Great Seal the Seal of the father for God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself in other words God or the Holy Ghost was locked in Jesus all the fullness was in him so uh it wasn't available to go and for everybody at that time because he had to die first that's the reason why all the prophets all the Patriarchs under the dispensation of Innocence human government law you know Grace right on down to this hour they all had to wait until he was crucified and then when preach of the spirits that were in prison waiting they were waiting by faith according to Hebrews 11 they had to wait by faith before he died they actually believed the Redemption so when he died they he can go into the prison and say San you have no rights over them because they believe unto this blood they believe unto this resurrection and took them out praise God and he took captivity captive and sent back gets onto men amen praise the Lord hallelujah they were captives of the word amen captives of Satan and he made them captives of the word and then he led them back into Glory you'll find that back in the Book of Psalms when he was taking them back and the angel said who he says open up your Everlasting Gates that the Lord Of Glory may come in the angel said who is this Lord Of Glory he says the Lord strong in battle the Lord mighty to save and the gates were open and he led all of those saints that he had taken up right in David was speaking the prophecy of course LED them and took them back so Abraham Isaac all of those prophets of Patriarchs that were there before our time are already in the presence of God and they are waiting on us right is that right but now because he was building up a body through the uh through all these ages amen and the body was is not going to be completed until the head comes back on the body just like in when he was building the physical body of Adam the Bible said Adam was the body was laying on the ground right and and and then when it was complete then God bring with the bread of life right so it's the same way through the ages he was building his body back but not with dirt with Earth men of earth we are the dirt to that God us Amen to build back his body predes you predestinated piece of dirt [Music] brother but that's what we are amen amen uh you see when that blood dropped on the off the cross uh I would no it's farfetched but put it way that's almost like dropping on a predestinated piece of it was predestinated Dr their Calvary couldn't drop anywhere else brother BR said that was the hill Adam di on that was the hill Abraham went and asked him to bury him this what those prophets by Revelation they all almost got Buri in the same place that's right because by Revelation amen they always said take me back take me back don't leave my bones here they want to go back amen the same way praise God so we see that we were all in him and we were locked into him there amen amen so until that seal was broken we could not be made manifest right because we were all in him praise God look it's the same way we were in God's mind because he T about us before the foundations of the world do you believe that praise God you are in the mind of God and when I say mind of God not like a man mind similar but not the same because if you're in God's mind God knows everything about you beginning end every single thing he knows about you right so he knew you as you are before the foundation of the world we were in this mind and like you you think about something after a while you know you going to speak it is that right so we were in this mind then we ended up being in his mouth to be spoken out is that right uh and we spoken out there and in word form uh our representation our theophany release are and so on uh by the spoken word of God Amen just the same way brother said you know when he said let there be light back there he said it's the same light shining now so we don't have a different son the effects of his word is is just gone and it's accomplishing its work and it's going right on through until it goes back to Eternity amen it's the same thing with us so we come out with God's mind uh we were in um his mouth and then we were made revealed praise the Lord with a with natural Adam we were in his loins amen and then we got expressed by the instrumentality of our mothers and we were made manifest here on the earth praise the Lord now actually the word comes into the heart of a minister comes into the heart of a Believer and when comes into the heart of that believer of the heart of that believer becomes pregnated by the invisible Union of the word of God and your soul that believe that word or receive that word then the word produces what a new birth amen it produces a birth amen that invisible Union produces the birth and you were born again again you become what a new creation in Christ amen praise the Lord now your soul changed but your physical body being born in sin he had he just had to redeem do some Redemption Jesus was born in by virgin birth so he didn't need Redemption praise God he didn't sin so he didn't need Redemption but because we were born in sin shap he come to the world speaking Lies We Needed Redemption you believe that praise God hallelujah praise God so we needed Redemption and so what happened see if we had remained in the loins of Christ in the Lord Jesus Christ spiritually his mind his heart if we had remained there we would not have been expressed it's like a man having an idea and he never has the opportunity to to actually create the thing or make it or do what he has in his mind but here it is if the princes of this world knew God's Plan of Redemption they would not have crucified the Lord's of glory amen because instead of having one Messiah he ends up with a whole bunch of Messiah X he ends up with a lot of little all not Jesus's but Christ in one amen anointed by the Holy Spirit to carry out the will and word of God Amen and we are all representation of that word Amen brother Brandon knew his representation was on Malachi 4:5 Revelation 10:7 do you know you're a part of this word am that's right the Holy Spirit has to reveal to you and you alone will know which part of the word you f MH amen that's that is the reason why he hid our names where under the seals because human beings have a habit that no matter where they are Darkest Night Brightest Day when you're in a crowd or you're in Al loone about to come and you heard a voice calling your name Mary or John or James it causes you to turn around that's right is that right you repent from whatever you were doing cuz that's what repent mean repent to means turn around and going the opposite direction from how you were living so your name gets called so you had to hide your names under the seals because we were his children and he didn't want Satan to get at us he didn't want Satan to be able to get at us like that so he hid our name cuz we are especially us here in this last name because we had to wait until the last stage and if he knew who we were before this time you kill your [Music] grandfather you destroy your mother if he knew beforehand whose names were under those seals and that's what I'm talking about briefly tonight the brid names were hidden under the seals amen that's right am if he knew all of that beforeand so true he would have killed your ancestors so that in your path of Life traveling down from Adam through all those thousands of years mysteriously through each one of your ancestors until that germ got here and then you were made manifested he would have cut them off so that you wouldn't get here the devil devil doesn't care about killing millions of people look what he's do in Syria look what he did in Vietnam look what he did to the Jews during the Holocaust he doesn't care about killing millions of people it's trying to cut off the seed of God that's right trying to kill off the effects of the testimony of Jesus Christ that's right and the power of God that dwells within us amen amen praise God because we are predestinated for a purpose that's right amen and he knows the difference we are not serpent seen amen we are we we are the brother said you are not really creatures of time you said you come from God you're going back to God you come from eternity you're going back to Eternity because Eternal being to how can this world hold you this world can't hold you amen praise the Lord do you know you're bigger than your body you're spirit so your body is just a representation so I can oh Glenn is over there but if Glenn had no body I would know Glenn is over there right see praise God I'm using you tonight for Myra brother praise God to God Amen see so so your body only gives you location geographical location so I can know oh Glenn attended church tonight not that Glenn stayed home and said pastor I was there in spirit if the entire congregation that what we have you see but you come and you come in your body praise the Lord so uh I'm so happy tonight I'm so happy that I can say our names were honests here and the devil's trick and trap was to try to destroy our ancestors that's the reason why some of you sit there brother brand went through the same thing the devil tried to kill you you know what even when you were young how many you can think back I know of times now I know why I almost died from drowning why I almost died when I been up on my um family's um shop Machining shop and grabbed a whole of electric wi about this size you're supposed to be dead but instead I felt my hand B like this miracle and then I looked around to see there was nobody there but I wasn't going to tell anybody because I would get uh my parents oh Lord have mercy I'm going to tell them about climbing up there to do that wow no so I never told anybody amen but after the message came then you started say I was there I was there I stood in the corner like I said look look I'm so short now just imagine when I was uh 9 or 10 years old and I have a bigger kite than my my size and the wind blew on the kite and I'm falling already in a car is already there there's no way you can turn back you're already on this then all of a sudden I felt like a wind blow and I'm back at my feet like this and your child you're wondering what was that but then you forgot about you R off with your you gone with your friend but now when the Holy Spirit comes and you get saved and you think oh you realize that was the hand of God Amen praise the Lord see brother climbed up uh when he when you know when he was up on the uh he was a what call him linesman where they fix the the the wires for the electric company and he was up there fixing it and the devil on him and his you know his wife died this happened and he wants to yeah I'm going to commit suicide and he puts his hand out to go like that to hold the virus and just thought said look down when you look down his shadow is in the image of the Cross he has his hands up stretched to hold the wires and there he is on post so it looked like a cross he said I cried like a baby he said I don't even know how I got on the ground amen predestinated for a purpose God have your name hit the seals for his purpose amen listen to the to the word for seal the members of the Bride their names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundations of the world so you're older than than this Earth and your soul your soul is older than this Earth your names were put on the book of life before excuse me the foundation of the world and if you were in God and you Eternal as God's ET turn you're older than this earth right right praise the Lord amen but it was it was sealed up see God sealed up their names not now it's being revealed whose names were in there am all about it what a great thing is happening now for he's saying that that that's where your names were your names were hidden under the seals but of course in another part of the seals he said I don't mean your name James Susie but your name God's the name that God gave you before the foundations of the world Amen see Jesus his name was what Jehovah Elohim but brother said when he came to the Earth as the word made flesh God allowed uh Joseph and Mary to give him an Earthly name and that Earthly name was Jesus your Earthly name is whatever it is but then you're going to get back your name you going to recognize your by then you will call it a new name praise God you you will recognize who you are and your new name is a part of the word and when uh a preacher preaches that part of the word that your name is represented by or is on even you're not hearing us we use the word name you're thinking of a natural name but one the person speaks that part of the word that fits your character because name nature character and so on I'm not teaching on that but the fact is the preacher is preaching he's preaching on the word and he might not even know what where what's happening but your name is under certain scripture it hits your heart certain Revelation is under that word it hits your soul the Deep calls to the Deep amen and then the Deep has to respond am why because you a part of the word and when that part of the word it fits your soul like a hand in a GL am amen that's not a man amen that's God doing that praise God God does that so our names were hid beneath the seals amen now we know that the people whose names were not under those seals that wouldn't catch the revelation of it truly they will be deceived they will be deceived because they have no Anor your name is written in the last book of life and you're anchored in the kingdom of God Amen you have Blessed Assurance that's right see I'm pulling you away from the Pentecost believe it you have bless the chance because you believe you know I believe in Jesus I'm believing but you have Blessed Assurance because we have an anchor that keeps our soul what is that anchor the foundation stone the word in in Daniel 7th week he says is been laid in you before the foundations of the world that's right predestination amen the foundation stone so your anchor Ru is Christ amen the ancher is your ho is the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost keeping yes sir Grace greater than all our sins that's right amen his grace is what keeps usen not by our strength not by our own wisdom not by any length of time we' been in the message no man could boast amen we are kept by the power of God through faith reah amen that's what we're kept by the part of God true Faith amen praise the Lord so listen what he says here in uh the first seene page 172 and the Bible says that the he the devil deceived all he said a l l upon the face of the Earth whose names were not written under themselves amen from the foundation of the world now if the Bible said he did he did it he hid them names under those seals praise the Lord glory to God hallelujah oh my aren't you glad that the seals are broken he was the Seal of the father and that had to be broken so the Holy Spirit could be made manifest and we could be made manifest amen glory to God and the last day these seals are broken to make what the word of God made manifest but it's not just a written word you are the word you are the unveiling of the mighty today it's God in flesh again not in Jesus but in his bride and you are the flesh is living in for this hour that's why we live holy that's why we live consecrated that's why we live according to the word of the hour not because the not just because the Bible is telling us it but because it's now in our heart and we want to do it amen we want to do it because we love him amen you know what that means it's putting you back on free moral agency where the Prophet said they can s when Adam and Eve were on free moreal agency they were Sons son and daughter of God Amen and they could sin or not sin praise God because they were already on free moral agency and just as that Eve had to be tested by The Serpent and that one fell he said this last day one will be tested also San this verion finding that will be tested also by Satan face to face speaking through man that's many the theologians false teachers you know even preachers of the message that will misdirect you uh you will by Revelation and by discernment will recognize that amen praise God not by comparing scripture with scripture that that's not enough just by compare comparing scripture with scripture that that just means that somebody has a sharper mind than the other one or one can quote the Scripture A little better that don't mean nothing he said one re genuine Revelations of that old wased woman will take her home glory to God Amen because the veil is ripped now and she's entered Beyond the Veil and will walk into the presence of almighty God hallelujah amen praise God no yes so some people are going to be deceived but the devil is going to at least make try to deceive the elected M but the Bible tells us impossible Hallelujah words not the elected can only be temporarily thr off of course right the devil can divert you into a Catholic Church divert you into the Methodist divert you into the Baptist Church but that's only for a while because there's a hunger that's going to be there that thirst that he cannot fulfill only the word of God can fulfill I mean the revealed word not just the Bible but to reveal word is the only thing that can fulfill because you have a thirst for God himself praise the Lord and you going be seek and search him amen hallelujah praise God oh my like all prophets of all they watered in sheep skins and goat skins from place to place he said searching for a city where a city of rest a place where they can rest in the same way you might have been Church to church been here you've been there what you searching for your soul was actually searching for the revealed word of God that it can find a resting place the Bible says that th SPS have made the the alar they rest upon thy altar the res in place upon thy altar oh God hallelujah amen let me stand upon the promises of Christ let me let me say like the Saints in heaven when the brother BR said but but I preach what all priest they said we are resting on that amen praise God on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground the S sand amen oh Hallelujah when all around my soul gives way he then is all my strength and St all Christ is stand all on the ground is sinking s hall hallelujah amen praise God Hallelujah the seals are open he said and he says now the spirit is calling out the names of the elect in the church H book he says he's the great Shepherd is now calling his Sheep amen calling them even though are changing their ARS of their body even though they have not fallen asleep glory to God Hallelujah can you hear your brother calling at supper time come home come home it's time for the wedd supper of the lamb praise God hallelujah oh I remember when I I go back it's so wonderful when I was a boy in childhood and and and supper would be ready we' be playing we be doing this and and your mother would just give a let me use the Common Place word a holler out of the kitchen window you you you drop whatever you're doing and rush and try to wash up and get in there so that you can dive into those homemade chops or meat or whatever fish or whatever she prepare it was just wonderful praise God hallelujah and it's so funny it tasted sweeter than now I can afford to buy any meat any fish I want but the fish that she cooked back then tast sweeter I like your mother's cooking and baking is that right it's so different that's the way God made us praise God and it's the same thing there's a difference between the Theologian preaching and and God's cooking God's word God's meals God's food is that right and one day we're going to have that great chef is going to serve us up a seven course meal amen praise God is that right I think he's serving it already that's right amen seven course meal praise God prepared by the hand of God himself because this was all prepared before the foundation of the world and prepared for you praise God just I'm going to use the last quot and then I'm going to start wiing this up or else we're going to go off into a major uh preaching message here now now he says I am thinking of that awful hour that is approaching and there is no more way to stop it it is predicted that if would come but of course I know that you have said that they wouldn't so they would but there is something that have there are some people that have got their names already written on the land's Book of Life and when them seals are thrown open there they'll begin to see their names there praise God are you starting to see your name in there amen oh praise God see means understand that's what it means it don't means you're going with your eyes but you begin to understand praise God if said see see I means see what see what I mean see because he want the person to understand so that's what the scripture is telling you here they will see or understand that their names were him under those SS praise God I'm going to preach for more from another angle on this because the breaking of the seals identifies you and give you certainty of who you are because if you were not part of the Bride then you wouldn't have a clear Revelation right of seeing the word made flesh or revealed to you like that so the word identifies you you identify the word and the word identifies remember John the Baptist in Jesus amen Jesus was coming down to wanted to be baptized Behold the Lamb of God that take away the sins of the world what did he do he identified the word of the hour because he was what he was the predestinated prophet that had to be there to identify that word is that right what a prophet a predestinated body that God works through praise the Lord hallelujah but at the same time the Bible that prophesied um uh that one crying in the wilderness preparing the way of the Lord hallelujah so when he said Behold the Lamb of God that taken away the sins of the world he identified the word but the word that was written also identified him amen amen right so when you receive the word of the hour by Revelation Hallelujah you identifying it that that's the truth I believe it praise God that's the word that's the L will take away my this is the message without spot or wrinkle I receive it in the name of Jesus when you do that it also identifies your bride that's right Hallelujah is that right amen it identifies you as bride because you then become the body just like John was the body predestinated to be there to recognize the word when it came on the scene Hallelujah you was predestinated to be in this age to identify the word for your hour to recognize your day and the word for your day Hallelujah and say recognize it th say the Lord I believe all my heart glory to hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah amen when them seals are thrown open there they begin to see their names there and the Holy Spirit speaks to them then and they come you just can't keep them away anymore no one can and he repeats again no one can once they see it no one can praise God because they recognize who they are brother BR himself said that when when the seals broke to him and you understood it he said I recognized that I was not really the son of Charles and ELR it was just his Earthly parents but my Father in Heaven oh Jehovah God I am your son I'm coming home to thee glory to God hallelujah you recognize that your heavenly father you are a spirit being and your father in Heaven is the god of Heaven the god of the universe amen hallelujah oh my no one can keep them way they are coming anyhow and they are coming because you are the one that's leading them second seal page 224 God LED you here tonight amen is that right brother do you really think you just walked into this service like that he says no he said this Holy Spirit Led your here tonight the same spirit that s to the Christ is the one that L you here toight glory to God God hallelujah amen you see me oh my praise God Elijah and all them Apostles was Men of like passions as we are they were flesh they were not supernatural beings or Space men they were just regular people like you amen they you know they went in the temple sometime they were tired when they have to go worship and serve God just like you right nobody wants to say Amen admit that maybe you came to church a little tired after work but it's truth it's the truth we just flesh and we just here to worship and serve the Lord I am trusting oh God that I am one of them that's going to find my name here tonight behind this seal that was put in there from the foundation of the world and something strikes my heart and I'm standing here Lord is it me Lord are you using this calling me I want you to reveal to me that my name is over there praise God hallelujah amen fill me and seal me into yourselves Lord by the holy ghost that my name is over there second seal page 227 I'll Lear a lesson here one old song just came to my mind is my name written there in the book bright and fair in the book of thy kingdom is my name written there amen now I can sing that and say yes my name is written there in the book right and fair in the book of thy kingdom I know that my name is written there because the prophet said you are certain of God it's revealed to you you're not guessing anymore I know that I know amen that I amen and I'm standing on those promises praise the Lord Jesus isn't it wonderful that our names who are under the seals or the devil would have destroyed every one of us amen you just have to think about it that you know the devil threaten you some of you from birth some of you before you even born amen that's right devil tried to either kill your mother or your father or something else like that but you're here by the grace of God you're here because he allowed you to be here explain that he says you realize that
