[24:01] mind the Bible say fear not little flog
[24:13] Hallelujah this
[24:15] is the
[24:18] building that our pastor God pleased in
[24:22] our pastor heart that is helping in
[24:27] Ghana be before I started to talk about
[24:30] this building some years ago as you all
[24:34] know we talk about it several times on
[24:36] the
[24:37] pulpit God laid in our heart me brother
[24:40] Kofi brother
[24:43] F we went to Ghana purposely for
[24:48] Ministry and God did a tremendous
[24:52] work that
[24:54] [Music]
[24:55] maybe maybe some of you here never see
[24:59] what God did before over there maybe
[25:02] some of you see some
[25:04] before we went
[25:06] there and we had a
[25:08] crusade in one night in my Village not
[25:13] only one Village we went about two
[25:16] Villages and then God came
[25:20] down mightly and perform
[25:24] miracle for my brother who has two
[25:26] strokes as I told told you before he
[25:29] couldn't walk and we pray for him and
[25:33] the Lord came down and healed him
[25:37] completely and he get up and walk the
[25:40] people over there never see such a thing
[25:44] in their life but there all there's all
[25:48] Christians there's Church there they go
[25:50] to church as we used to go to church by
[25:52] a normal church that's why I say
[25:54] sometime people never see this thing
[25:56] before but this is happening right now
[26:00] Hallelujah the Bible said the only the
[26:03] children of God will see it but you have
[26:05] to believe it
[26:08] Hallelujah and then when that thing
[26:12] happened the following day we baptize
[26:15] about 25 to 30
[26:18] people and when we baptize them the
[26:21] cover came came and dismantle dismantled
[26:26] them because we said have a place where
[26:30] they have to worship and stuff like that
[26:32] and when Co came they cannot group
[26:35] anymore so all of them
[26:38] scattered then when I went just last uh
[26:43] after I went second time one day H in
[26:47] the
[26:48] Sunday I begin to I went out to find
[26:52] them
[26:53] to to have a fellowship I couldn't find
[26:56] no one so I was standing in the middle
[26:57] of the street
[27:00] and then I saw
[27:01] one and I said where is the arest I
[27:04] would like to speak to you you you
[27:06] brotherr here said some of them gone out
[27:08] some of them good they can't find them
[27:10] and he said we have a small group here
[27:14] so we want you to come and Minister
[27:16] Minister unto us so I went there and
[27:19] ministered to them and God came
[27:22] down and do a mighty work and it was
[27:26] fantastic
[27:28] so they took me to a place where they
[27:31] have started a church
[27:35] building that they did a foundation but
[27:38] there's not they don't have no strength
[27:40] it's about maybe eight or four seven
[27:43] people over there they have no place of
[27:46] wor they worship in a in a a a house
[27:50] where somebody have started and there
[27:53] was
[27:53] no nobody lived there so they just
[27:57] managed to get there and just put a
[28:01] couple chairs and sat down and worship
[28:03] so I went there and I I ministered to
[28:06] them and I they took me to this place
[28:09] and the Lord L when I came back here I
[28:13] spoke to Pastor Dany and uh we talk
[28:17] about it and he said we're going to help
[28:19] them so that they can have you
[28:23] roof on your head to worship you know
[28:28] brother Abraham said not God doesn't
[28:32] save anybody in One Church not a
[28:36] group God saved people by Jesus
[28:41] Christ
[28:42] hallelujah it's not a church that God is
[28:45] saving is saving you the people who are
[28:48] the church the people are the church
[28:50] amen hallelujah it's not a
[28:54] building so whatever you can do for for
[28:58] somebody it doesn't matter whatever
[29:01] whatever it is God plac in your heart to
[29:04] do don't differentiate oh this is not a
[29:06] message believer oh he doesn't go to my
[29:08] church so
[29:10] no God do something for God God knows
[29:15] who is going to be saved hallelujah
[29:17] hallelujah it doesn't
[29:19] matter did Peter know that he's going to
[29:22] be
[29:23] safe nobody don't know Peter going to be
[29:26] safe only the Lord Jesus Christ know
[29:29] Peter going to be his disciple he
[29:32] preached the word to them and they
[29:34] believe it and then they took off
[29:38] Hallelujah so everything that you do do
[29:42] it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:44] amen not the church in the name of the
[29:47] Lord Jesus Christ because God save us
[29:50] through Jesus Christ hallelujah it's not
[29:54] a church it's not a building so the
[29:56] pastor started
[29:59] and then we send them fans and while I'm
[30:03] going you can change the thing there so
[30:06] I came down I showed the picture and the
[30:08] Pastor said gave us a money and we we
[30:10] bought a a
[30:12] trip a two trips of uh death I think I
[30:17] show you this picture can you change the
[30:18] the next picture yes uh no not this one
[30:24] there's a different picture over there
[30:27] after
[30:30] yeah yeah this is the this is the okay
[30:34] this is the the iron rust that they
[30:39] use to build the pillars and then the
[30:43] lentil yeah when you finish the building
[30:46] back home we build a house with with the
[30:50] with the
[30:52] blocks so when you put the blocks over
[30:54] there you need a cement and then iron
[30:58] Rod to make the pillars in between so
[31:01] that you put the blocks in between so
[31:04] the pastor give us a money and then we
[31:06] buy the iron iron Ross and then they
[31:09] start taking the the Brocks can you have
[31:13] another picture
[31:19] there let's go another one this is the
[31:22] the
[31:23] okay and then he gave a that's the same
[31:27] time he gave us a money and they bought
[31:29] the cement and they they they made this
[31:33] blocks this is the blocks that is going
[31:35] to go in between the post of the pillage
[31:41] so we said the Pastor gave him the money
[31:44] and we sent them and they bought the
[31:48] cement and the sand that we we
[31:51] saw with they mix with the cement and
[31:55] then they make that blocks so after they
[31:58] make this blocks what they do then they
[32:01] going to put the blocks in between can
[32:03] you go to another picture there let's
[32:05] see exactly have you seen that you see
[32:09] the iron rods that's why it is so after
[32:12] that they put
[32:15] this they when they put the iron rcks
[32:18] with the pillars and they begin to put
[32:21] the the blocks in between them and this
[32:24] is what is going on now this is how far
[32:29] they've been going on now so with a with
[32:33] a a little money that the F that the
[32:37] pastor gave us I know I believe that
[32:41] through you without you the pastor don't
[32:45] have money to do this it's you
[32:48] congregation that put your offering and
[32:52] and everything your TI and everything
[32:54] and the Lord Place in the pastor heart
[32:57] to use it for the kingdom of God when
[33:00] you giving your money or your TI and
[33:02] offering don't think that you giving to
[33:05] a man your pastor God instructs him what
[33:09] to do with the money that you gave it to
[33:12] him so whatever you give is going to
[33:15] where the kingdom of God every little
[33:19] thing count every little thing count and

[40:17] man we went to his house to pray for his
[40:20] daughter his daughter and when we went
[40:24] there there was his brother in-law in

[41:24] brother went there
[41:27] if you go over there you're going to go
[41:28] like this but we are not thinking about
[41:32] that we were thinking about the soul of

[41:36] man we we believe God sent us there
[41:40] purposely for that
[41:43] boy that boy gets sick instantly nobody
[41:46] don't know what kind of sickness they
[41:48] went to the doctors and everything they

[42:34] went back and another man was in the
[42:37] same
[42:38] situation he couldn't then they call us
[42:41] to that's why was in Kumasi we went
[42:43] there and we pray for him a couple days
[42:45] time he went through they couldn't
[42:49] die but I believe God wanted them to
[42:52] hear the voice of God before they go
[42:56] home
[42:59] Hallelujah at the same time
[43:02] too my friend that I work with him over
