TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the lord friends it's good to be back and with you as we study the word of god may god richly bless us together today as has become in his wonderful wonderful presence our study continues on the present day evil of nicolaitanism and may god bless us and enrich us here today we take it from the seed of nicolasianism in ephesians which we are studying and applies it applying it to the present day evil of nucleationism in its present form making itself manifested in the church of the living god let us read our scripture and have a word of prayer and begin our study from the book of revelation chapter 2 verse 6. but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nickelodeons which i also hate our righteous and gracious and loving heavenly father thank you for your great love mercy and grace thank you for the gift that thou hast place and deposited in us to be made manifested in this hour take all the glory take the preeminence take your lordship be glorified we pray this day in jesus name amen and amen now the present day evil of nicolasianism nico meaning to conquer and leoptionism the laity conquering the laity now the present-day evil of this nickelodeonism can be seen in the upsurge in the desires in the hearts of men human beings men and women today especially in the religious realm wanting and desiring and lusting to be heads uh over boards committees uh churches uh human beings desiring to become ministers pastors leaders superintendents uh rulers uh princes of the church teachers and the desire to be certified not so much by god but to be certified by men in this day and to hold some form of certification of human ordination human diplomatics or the diplomas a human membership and some kind of fraternity organization whether it be religious or otherwise that from which they will glean or gain their uh authority and ability to maintain and sustain this kind of human rulership nickelodeonism which uh they may not know it by that name but that is what it is and so many today with no calling no calling of god no gifting of the holy spirit no anointing of the great holy spirit of the living god but in them is a desire to become preacher pastor teacher missionary leader superintendent just the lost and desire to be over men to be over groups of men and of course my friends we understand that god is in the heavens and god by his spirit rules his church true anointed men but let us come back to our teaching for today now we understand friends what was happening back there and how that after a while that the very thing that the ephesian church hated and had tested and tried and found them to be liars now we are reading that amongst them they have this nickelodeonism which means that there was a drifting away from the original word of falling away from their first love and as it was happening back there we find that the false vine was taking a hold it was teaching about and trying to establish the rulership of men and that that rulership was right it was also teaching that the church had to be governed and governed by men and they believe that that also was right they taught that those men that ruled over the church these so-called princes of the church not shepherds not uh beggars or poor men that were hiding in caves with camel skin and goat skins and smelly and everything else like that but perfumed handkerchiefs and wonderful satin robes and golden crosses and everything else elevating themselves and now we find according to the word of god that it was taught to the people that these so-called men were to have control over the people and instead of course of them doing it god's way they simply took human authority and vested by their vestments and by their teaching and vested all supernat all spiritual power into their own hands and out of that fire of desire for their vested interest came the golden calf of a holy priesthood standing between god and man standing between god and the people and by this knowingly or annoyingly they had reverted or turned themselves back to the old ironic system of priesthood and by going back in time and out of their age and their season they actually became antichrist now we know according to scripture and history that the ironic priesthood ended with eli and his sons let me give you the scriptures you can check this out yourselves 1st samuel chapter 2 verses 22 and in 1st samuel chapter 4. verses 15 to 18. now here we find this so-called unscriptural ungodly antichrist priesthood placing itself between god and man they will be the confessors they will be the mediators when in our bible it teaches there is only one let me repeat there is only one mediator between god and man and his name as the man christ jesus now they became antichrist for they disposed of the original word and of his jesus christ mediatorship and imposed their own multiplicity of ships and of course god hated that because they were accepting the anointing and order of a passage and trying to lead the people by rotten manna by what was allowed in a former age now become unscriptural and disposed of by the living god but reinstituted by satan that all copycat and saying yes it was god that instituted it yes at a certain time but then he disposed of it but now he satan is making use of it through his unscriptural ungodly and sinful so-called priesthood god hated nicolasianism then in its past form and he hates it now the present day evil of nicolasianism now we find that the ephesian church hated that and any true believer filled with the first love of god in their hearts will hit the leadership of evil man not ordained by god let me emphasize god has set in the church man as predestinated vessels through whom he himself will interpret his word he himself will lead his church not the man but god leading his church through this uh ephesians 4 that he himself has instituted we will get to that amen god hates man ruling over his word absolutely praise god amen yes sir so we are not here to try to wash up on the that all ironic uh system that was there that was outlawed outlawed and ended by god himself certainly not praise god hallelujah now right now it's worst of all and the organization organizing themselves they have separated the people from the true word of god god's people are supposed to be one but they have brought in enemy nationalism by one spirit we are supposed to be baptized into one body and every part of his or that body ought to be moved upon and used by the holy ghost himself and everyone is to participate in the worship of god under the anointing and inspiration of the blessed holy spirit but man men wanting the preeminence man wanting the control so they could have and take control made themselves bishops well of course we know in the modern world they've got the word bishop to mean an imminent elevated person in the bible a bishop is simply a pastor the bible some time ago uh a diplomat a diplomat asked me uh uh brother simon are you are you a bishop now i knew in their heart and in their mind they were thinking of the modern day uh uh interpretation of what or who a bishop is supposed to be and appear to be and knowing that that was in their mind i said no sir i i am not a bishop i meant a no sir i'm not that kind of a bishop but i answered no sir i am not a bishop amen and left it at that because you see in the minds of men they have implanted this suggestion this thought that a bishop is a an elevated royalty of religion and that he the bishop is above pastors but the word bishop means pastor and every pastor is a bishop in his own local church and there is no bishop above bishops for we are if we are all preachers and we are all bishops or preachers or pastors in our own local church but they've developed a system of bishops and archbishops and cardinals and popes and so on that is the way that they have established this system that is unscriptural ungodly sinful and satanic and totally and absolutely in rebellion of god and his word they're brought upon themselves imposing titles by which they have to glean credibility and authority their bypass the word of the living god are not teaching and have taught their own doctrines that are not even found in the bible in the word of god they have by suctility and deceit have caused the people and brought them to a place of nickelodeonism man's domination into having them kissing different parts of their body and uh have those people to obey them and worship in the way that does not in any way resemble biblical worship pentecostal worship acts 2 4 worship it doesn't resemble that anyway no mumbling no murmuring no monotonic monosyllabic ah carrying on none of that whatsoever and it does not come from just the apostles or from the priesthood but all the people were worshiping praising and thanking god in the house of god but now it's come down to the to priestly worship it's come down to that where the word of god is reduced to nothing but a creed and the bible which tells us salvation is by blood and repentance to jesus christ but no their teaching is that salvation is by being a member of the church church membership gives you salvation and if you're excommunicated or you're outside of the church then you are outside of the grace of god the mercy of god and only a man can restore you or give that back to you contrary to the word of god and thus they have this antichrist evil nicoletian spirit predominating and ruling over god's church now remember in the book of acts let us read the scripture my friends if we were to read it today uh praise god hey hallelujah let's read the scripture and this is the way they may read it and now when the day of pentecost was fully calm there came a priest with a wafer and said stick out your tongue and he laid the wafer upon their town and then he himself drank the wine and said now you have received the holy ghost incredible and indeed is incredible for that is not what the word of god says go read the book of acts chapter 2 verse 4 and hear what it says amen what they are saying in my friends never mind what the word of god says never mind what you think it says we are here to interpret the the word of god to you we are here to tell you what it says and furthermore may we inform you this is the nickelodeon spirit that is out there with its present evil saying to you that the bible my friends is not finished and as it changes with the times which the bible does not say for god says i am the lord thy god i change not the word of god does not change and he says it will stand forever heavens and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away and furthermore let my word be true and the words of every man be a liar who should we believe the words of elevated man or by the glorious king of glory this mighty god the everlasting father jesus christ hallelujah amen they are telling us that the bible changes and must change with the times and god says no it does not happen the word of god does not change for god does not change his mind about his word amen praise the lord our friends whenever there's a conflict between truth and error heavens and heart will pass away but my word shall not pass away and let god be true and let every man be a liar so people today allowing themselves to be led by people presumptuous people in other words people who presume on the word of god they're presumed to be something or somebody that they are not in other words they are actors and they're presumptuous to insert themselves within the word of the living god claiming that they are so-called vikers of christ are or that they are instead of christ the vicarious billy idea but what they are is antichrist for it is not found in this bible in the word of god you are believing something that they have told you but is not found in our bible it's another sad story when we think of water baptism in the jesus day the immersed people who went down into the water and came up out of the water to walk in newness of life but now we found educated man creating beautiful surroundings like cain's altar with flowers with brass with gold with silver and a little chip bowl with water which is claimed to be holy and they will pour a bit of that upon you or sprinkle some one of that upon you and tell you you have been baptized when the bible speaks contrary to that even jesus himself showing the example the bible said and when john took him to baptize him he went down into the water and coming up out of the water the holy spirit comes down upon him all blessed be the name of the lord as it was with the lord so let it be today with every person that comes to be one of baptized in the name of the lord we are not here to pour water upon you my friends we are not here to pour lies upon you but we are here to pour out the holy spirit upon you we are here to pour out the revealed word upon you praise god hallelujah amen and not only though they pour out the water but they baptize the people wrongly on scripturally baptizing them in the titles of father son and holy spirit as if those titles were real names suddenly comingly and evilly they are literally trying to do away with one and suggesting to the people that there are tree gods instead of one my friends you stay in that organization and try to teach or preach the truth of one god and baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and they'll surely kick you out throw you out and get you out of there and i'm saying to you if you claim to be truly spirit led by the holy spirit you will not be able to stand there it will be impossible for you to stay within there now we know paul was a prophet and we know that paul taught by the holy ghost and paul himself he said he baptized in no other name but in the name of the lord jesus christ and said if anyone did anything different or baptized in any different way than he did and was doing let them be cursed let them be accursed according to the bible then it's time for us to wake up and see where we're standing it's time for us to see the evil of the colonialism in its present form it is time for us to read out of the book of acts chapter 20 verses 27 to 30. amen and how we can see that the church is no longer controlled by the holy ghost but controlled by nickelodeon spirits reading from what paul said acts 20 27 to 30 for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god take heed therefore unto yourself and to all the flock of god which the holy ghost had made you overseers to feed the church of god which he has purchased with his own blood for i know this that after my departing shall gravious woes enter in amongst you not sparing the flock also of your own cells in the church paul is saying among you from your own selves shall menorize speaking perverse things perverting the truth and to draw away disciples after them now paul saw this all coming and he warned about this subtle intelligent cunning priesthood that would come and by fertility and deceit take over with its false doctrines and begin to control not only the church but we know according to scripture after a while they'll control the entire world and they are right on the cusp of it right now he knew paul that there would implement a way of worship that excluded the people in any part of holy spirit ministry and knowing this they're so cunning so subtle they quickly went and brought in some people and inserted them among themselves uh which they call charismatics uh speaking in towns and worshiping and playing guitars and and say oh we have that too yes you have that in a sense small sense amongst you but it's not general in the entire church where the people have a charismatic pentecostal way of worship but my friends amongst you you have this deeds of the nicolaitans in this day amen praise god hallelujah not much freedom at all and the best we can see is a few inspired preachers while the flock sits down there and tries to absorb it this is far crying from what paul said when we all came to come together and all have the leading of the spirit of god and all of us spiritually participating in spiritual worship now the church the corporate church has never learned this last lesson because of course the church has now become corporations instead of being in cooperation with god they have become their own religious body not his body but their own religious corporate body and every time god gives a visitation of the holy spirit and get people free after a while they bind themselves back to the very same thing they came out of i believe that's going on right now even with the people of the message in this hour binding themselves back the old spider the old snakes the old crabs and all these various creatures of of the dark deep are slowly creeping and crawling them their ways back to where they come from and finding their appropriate places luther lutheranism which came out of catholicism how many knows that i know that lutheranism came out of catholicism when he nailed his feces at the gate but when luther died the people or luther's people simply organized themselves around what they thought they believed and began to set up their own creeds their own ideas and their own darkness and began to repudiate or be against anyone else that was saying opposite to what they said my friends isn't that so much like those who have come out of this message of a genuine bible prophet and now they're putting themselves under brandonism and now they're allowing themselves to keep their eyes on the man the messenger instead of his message and not realizing they're slowly drifting away from the original truth that this messenger that god sent has brought to us oh friends there shall be the bible says a great falling away in doing so they're on their journey back to catholicism taking it on in a different form and already we find today many denominations lutheranism included are already on their way back home to their religious mother roman ism that they came out of from the very beginning oh yes revelation chapter 12 the bible calls her on old and her daughters and those daughters were exactly acting like their mother and teaching what their mother is teaching and has taught and setting the word of god aside denying the working and moving of the holy spirit and with this grievous wolf-like spirit to subjugate like nimrod the people of the living god and make it impossible for them to worship and bring glory to god unless they come through them and through their pattern in other words they are setting aside the leadership of their husband god the word and so they've lost their sweetness they've lost their anointing of the blessed holy spirit and have become domineering dominating and controlling church or woman over the word and people of the living god here we see in the scripture friends that they want the people to be subjugated to their pattern which is nothing but satan's pattern and satan's uh blueprint for unbelief we are working and speaking and uh operating on the god's blueprint they're operating on the satan's blueprint for deceit deception and degradation oh my friends where are we spiritually here today where is the promised land how far as kids in a car but their parents will say how far more do we have to go how far more yes how far is the promised land how far are we from it my friends oh we are in a wilderness of darkness at this particular time and how far have we wandered away from the first church of acts chapter two when we look at the image the shape of the modern church and compare it to god's blueprint and pattern of pentecost we are far away from god's original view and his word can not be found in her things what we find today is teachings and things like apostolic succession absolutely unscriptural antichrist sinful and against the word of the living god yet it abounds in the minds and hearts of millions but it is not found in the word of god it's a device of man it trying to supersede illegally the truth of the word of god and is a man-made device amen god not man but god has set in the church do you believe that ephesians chapter 4 god has set in the church apostles preachers pastors teachers elders administrators and so on but the emphasis here is not man not some human leadership anointing and giving out posts positions and like that but god himself has set in the church the bible tells us set his own leaders spirit-filled anointed leaders in the church oh praise god hallelujah lies like peter was in rome not even historically peter was not in rome yet the lions say that he was in rome they make movies about him being in rome to to implant it in the minds and hearts of men this is an unscriptural picture on scriptural position it's totally unscriptural with what they are propounding that peter was not ever even in rome and they are lying now there are people who read history my friends and shrugged their shoulders when they see that truth and they'll go right back to their church believing that kind of a lie even though they can see it and know it according to history that peter was never ever in rome where can you find a term a thought a vikar of christ it is not in your bible all the new testament it's nowhere to be found it is not there it is a man-made post and position but not given by god think of it my friends no one can take the place of jesus christ there is only one jesus christ and no one else has the power of a dead hell and the grave but jesus and jesus alone blessed be his holy and precious name and he has not given up his powers he has not renounced his spires and he has not placed it in the hands of any man here on earth who has no right to call themselves viker of jesus christ yet it has been done and yet people accept it where can we find such a thing as added revelation to the word of god we cannot add or take away from the word the bible itself is telling you that in its closing words be careful do not add nor take away from the word of god lest your part be taken out of the book of life oh think about it my friends where do we find such a thing as purgatory there is no such thing in the bible where do we find something like math there is no such a thing found in the word of god like mass we cannot find it where do you find people having to pay jesus the apostles or anyone in the bible to pay or buy their way out of hell it is not in your bible these are the grievous wolves that paul is speaking about that will come after him claiming the name of christ but yet antichrist here it is in the word of god where do you find it's not in the word but men put it in their own religious books and claiming that it is the word of god that took over the people's minds and they're ruling the people by fear and threats of fear and excommunication where do you find in your bible that man has the power to forgive us of our sins as though that man or those men were god unscriptural it is not in your bible grievous woes is a term that is uh it's not even strong enough to describe them to describe the evil of nickelodeonism and it's a present evil past evil present evil and it will grow to its fruition or harvest in the years that are ahead the spirit of organization of placing man over man instead of god ruling over his church my friends all of their teachings questionable doctrinal foundations they're building their doctrinal foundation on the shifting sinking signs of time which will pass away my friends but the word of our god will stand forever let us get back to god and repent before it is too late i see the hand writing on the wall as in the days of belshazz's feast we see the hand writing upon the wall and the hand is writing judgment judgment man and manner taking your first sin the glory is departed your kingdom is taken from your hand oh my god what a day and are the sacred vessels of the living god being desecrated and now brings down the wrath of god the sacred word of god now being desecrated and the spirit of god being grieved judgment is now right now here even at the very doors oh church of the living god repent go back to pentecost back to the leadership of the holy spirit back to the word of god and the preeminence of the holy spirit of the living god now remember how nebuchadnezzar took away the sacred vessels of god the devil is doing the same thing in the form of the word of god his sacred vessels for his transmission of truth and his living word his bright church his people at the end time predestinated for this hour when the word of god will flow through them he is taking away that and taking them down into babylon thanks be to god for these spirit anointed men like paul that god gave amen the bible tells us revelation 2 7 he that hated heir let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches let him that overcome it i will give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god oh friends millions thousands will hear these words as they go out on the internet but let me say how many are going to pay heed how many are going to come out from amongst them my people and be not partakers of our sins we don't know but we know that god has his own people that will lend his him lend their ears to him and want to know the words of truth as found in the bible and in the word of god keep your heart on your ear and the spirit of god will make this word of god real to you that is his work that is what he is here for i can teach you the truth ma any man can bring to you the truth my friends but if you don't open your ears to hear it man your heart be open to receive it you won't be able to get the revelation now we notice the spirit of god is saying hear what the spirit is saying to the churches then we know that this warning this rebuke this revelation this promise and blessing is was not meant only for the ephesian jews church but my friends it's meant for the churches of all ages hallelujah thus we know this first church age the church in the beginning just as in genesis a seed book a beginning book a beginning topic where everything finds its seed form and begins which will later come to its harvest so if this book of acts 2 4 ephesian church began as the first seed church of the living god amen and will remain in the book of acts as god's blueprint for all ages until the church ages close out and the ledecian church age which is closing up right now watch it carefully my friends and let every other age other than that ephesian church age begin to take heed of what is going on what is happening and that the church of good and evil which was splendid is going to grow and it is growing and has been growing through the ages and thus then is a message for every christian every believer through every age until jesus comes again let us pay heed to god's word for it is jesus speaking by his word now listen fathers i'm closing for i have not shunned to declare unto you the whole council of god the whole council that blessed man that blessed apostle may god rest this gallant soul or praise god that one who wore a martyr's crown upon his head amen i believe my friends when i get there when i get there i'll shout i'll praise god when i see paul or praise god listen see paul that great apostle with his robes made bright and fair and i am sure there'll be a lot of shouting when we all get over there may god bless you my friends and there we all get over there and may there be a whole lot of shouting when we see the lord jesus with his robes all bright and fair god bless you until next wednesday night in the house and presence of god may the lord bless you real good and may god deliver you and bring you out from the grip of the present day evil of nicolaitanism god be with you until we meet again amen [Music] you
