in the house of the lord together may the lord richly bless you please be seated amen [Music] praise god i want to thank the lord for his marvelous work and his grace i want to thank god for every one of you especially those of you who have followed this ministry from the time the lord sent me into the niagara area some of you have followed this word of god for 20 years 25 years walking in the light of the word and as i preach the word at first it seems as if what i was trying to get through to the people not just jesus [Music] you you come and repent and get saved but something deeper than that that you would recognize what he is really doing in our hearts in our lives and in the world today and it it took many years and a long time um as you know any carpenter doesn't hit a nail once and then the nail sticks no he keeps banging the nail so that it goes home and so we kept with the message and finally it seems uh broken through when like paul you can now say this is my gospel amen because you've caught the revelation of the word from from the word of god in your own hearts and i rejoice and thank the lord for that amen it's almost as if i can say like paul or any one of the other apostles or prophets even if your servant departs i can depart in peace knowing that the word has come true now mind you i'm not going anywhere so don't start a lot of you spiritual people your mind god i'm not prophesying nothing i'm just having a talk with you that's all right i'm just letting you see the satisfaction that comes when you know uh even if you're in a conversation you finally okay you got your point over they've caught what you have been trained to say and the beauty of it everybody else is saying the same thing but somehow god gives you an understanding of the very words out of the same bible and it puts something inside of you that gives you such a inspiration that it it makes a big difference you can't even explain it in words you can't give it to somebody else because it's given to you and i just want to thank god for that that as a child at 12 years old i saw a man and at 14 years old not yet not being a member of a church but reading the bible at home the pulsation to preach the gospel struck the soul i've said it before i just say it again 14 years old with a friend of mine we hit the streets began to preach a revival broke out and i repeat again there's still a church there with over 2 500 members because the holy spirit struck the city and just busted the whole thing wide open prostitute gamblers fishermen all kinds of people changed and transformed by the power of god later on i saw it was in the americas magazines in england i don't know if it was in the us but that's what caused a a big preacher in new york hearing about this young boy just just send for me he never saw me in my his life i didn't know him just sent for me to come up to the united states and that's what caused me to come up preached in different places in the u.s and in canada and then i went back and decided to come on my own i'm here today by the grace of god i won't give you my whole story and my old testimony but i am here by the grace of god and you are here by the grace of god and i'm saying this because you're not here by chance right because just like jesus those that are mine god send them to me whether they come from the east west north south black white chinese listen all kinds of people come out of this ministry jews chinese whites blacks people of great power people of great wealth people of poverty all kinds have come out and i'm saying it's also so it goes on record too that i the lord has enabled me to raise churches up from two people and speaking to crowds of two and also to football stadium filled with people of thousands 25 000 and over and until some of those countries the president send out the secret service to find out what is going on if something is destabilizing but it wasn't destabilizing when they find out that it was actually bringing the country and the people together praise the lord i'm just saying that so you see me god bring me here and i'm preaching the god spell and that's how god does things just let it be simple ordinary you don't even recognize what's happening and yes i allow his word his power and his glory to go forth so it's a privilege for me to speak to you as a part of the bride of jesus christ the elect church of god it's a real blessing and a privilege and you are fitted to hear me and i'm fitted to speak the word to you i know some of you would like for me to speak with a texas accent or arkansas i'm sorry i'm starting to break into things here but but i have an accent but it's not from texas or arkansas or somewhere in the south it's from down in guyana south america but you see such things as silly god don't even look at that it's human beings that cause those things to come the vision of nations and people and this and that and all this foolishness and you can't help it because you're in the world so you're going to meet it it's all there you can't help it but we as christians we recognize that we are offspring of the almighty praise the lord and i'm thankful that i could be here to speak the word of god to you now this may sung to you as a simple topic but um i pray the lord jesus christ will take the word and bring it to your attention amen praise the lord hallelujah um also i want you to know that sometimes i speak scattered i just talk and things bounce around like that but the same revival and move of god caused the the assemblies of god denomination at that time gave me a scholarship to their bible college where it's been three years but the thing about it is that's wonderful marvelous but later on when the holy spirit had me praying before i knew anything about any elijah or anything of god i began to pray lord reveal to me what is beyond pentecost because this can't be it pentecost can't be it and tongues can't be the infallible evidence it is on evidence but not the infallible evidence and so that's when god began to unfold the word and expand the word into my heart mind and life and i just want to share with you the unveiling of god hallelujah i'm my scripture is found in john chapter 12 verses 20 to 23 and my topic is the glorified jesus the glory find jesus or you could say jesus glorified but i prefer to say the glorifying jesus shall we read our scripture together i want to acknowledge brother hutchinson here with us today may god bless his heart and maybe when i'm finished um he'll maybe say a few words to you as he feels inspired okay praise the lord but for now i want to go straight to the word of god and i trust it will bless you remember these things come not just to you but they go out on the airwaves and many are listening and hearing it across the world right so it's a blessing to you so if you think you heard this before and all of that then that's okay but there's other people never heard it on this fashion right and it's a real blessing up for them praise the lord jesus the mate bless us all where it has blessed me and praise the lord and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefore to philip which was of bethsaida of galilee and desired him saying sir we would see jesus philip cometh and tell it andrew and andrew and philip tell jesus ours come because the people want to see jesus so he has to be glorified to be seen praise the lord hallelujah gracious father we thank you for the reading of the word we pray and ask for help from our teacher the great holy spirit who will come father and as you moved over the waters in genesis may the great holy spirit move upon the waters of the word stir the gospel trumpet lord walk on the water once more and bid us come to thee and may the spirit of god take these thoughts of mind and give them focus and point us to back to your presence unto your word in jesus name amen and amen praise the lord of course pointing you to the word is really trying to get you to sense or see his supernatural presence among us right so when you're reading on the bible the the written word is only a representation for you to recognize that there's another being in this building this is not a person here and that person is not you or me what is the almighty supernatural eternal spirit of the living god and it's the same yesterday today and forever and he doesn't change praise the lord and we thank god god is glorified in the universe how many knows that you just look at the the universe and you see god glorified in in the universe that's out there the moon the heavens declare the glory of god amen praise the lord god glorified in his great creation you look around and you see all his creative acts and you just are left speechless with amazement at the great artistry and the great might of this one this being that has made all these wonderful things amen you come to the human body amen last night i was just showing a brother an old book that uh from um 1916 um that speaks of god's masterpiece that's the name of the book uh god's masterpiece but you see these last things were just thrown around and hidden up they're all based everywhere in the world but praise god i tell you man is another evidence of the glory of god you just look a human being we look ordinary but let me tell you when a scientist or a doctor start looking at these teeny-weeny nerves and looking at all these teeny things that they're all functioning to keep you alive they are left with astonishment it's so amazing that one of them have to just study hands alone and become a so-called specialist and there's one person that made all everything amen praise god so we thank god that he is glory be to his great name we also have seen some great ministries on this planet for you i've seen many and the last great ministry that we know of is brother william marion branham he's even marveled by all the various preachers out there and i've i've seen them and i've seen the holy spirit manifest through them many some of them not their names are not written down anywhere but i've seen them oh my in mighty power man i've seen the tail off the ending point of old fash old-time pentecost when it was dying out seeing those men stand there and preach the word and while they are preaching demons will start to scream out and people would be falling on the ground and they're not shouting they're just talking just talking right they're just talking and things would be happening praise god like that and i give god the glory i i've been in it there as a young man where some of those old men in prayer and they come out and say well you know on sunday there's a brother that's coming and he's going to be dressed this way and he is going to preach for us on sunday and so let's pray and believe god and expect the brother and so we come to church and we're singing and we're praising god and we're praying and you know people are waiting and everything else and the next thing you know the door pushes we have there's a pastor there but he he heard the word and uh and there you know the brother comes in with his bible and he sits down thinking that nobody knows him and then they just call him and the whole thing he ends up coming and preaching the word of god but over and over i i've seen it where where where the brother they're having a lord supper and somebody comes to take the cup he says no you touch that cup and they'll pack you out of here right so i i seen it so when i hear somebody else say the same thing in the same way that's real brother that's not a joke we're not guessing but it's real you see it's gotten to the point now where people think we're just telling a lot of religious myths and stories just to get people into a religious atmosphere where we can sing and shout and dance and everything else and be caught up in some kind of a religious fantasy or fantastic but it's not that it's real but because time has passed it's waved in the wind in the mind of the people amen hallelujah you see what i want to show you today is that you may know jesus real well you may know your bible real well you may know the scriptures real well you might have walked as a christian as a believer 20 30 years serving god reading your bible and everything else like that but my brother's sister you still did not recognize the fullness of who he is who he was who he is even though walking with him and as many a believer knows their bible and they know it inside and out they then they can quote it so accurately that you can't say anything to them because they know their bible and the structure of it and many knows the message of this hour which we have heard and every quote every line every sermon they they heard it they know it that's wonderful that you know it but you still don't have a revelation of it and that is a totally different matter amen you know when you look to the word of god you'll find out that many of his disciples knew him in his natural life then you jesus uh as a natural boy then who is mother then you where he come from in nazareth uh that's why when he said um that the son of man is going back into heaven or um i come down from heaven what are you talking about you see that's another realm they're looking at this one at his natural existence where he is their noise from nazareth they know he was mary's uh boy child uh they played with him no doubt in the streets and now he's telling you yeah you know this part of me but the other part of me come from somewhere else the other part this point here this part here they can kill but this other part here amen they can't kill it's eternal it's the lord of glory amen they can't do nothing about that praise god hallelujah you kill this body i raise it up again oh my praise god so he's showing you the difference a little bit of the difference and when people hear to believe the word they just think it's just believing the bible because that's just believing like i uh yeah i believe him because i know he was born in nazareth you can see this you can feel this you can touch this you can read this you can analyze this debate this study it and know it from cover to cover all the background all the greek all that that doesn't mean a thing you don't know him yet i'm talking about the being the spirit being the anointed being that is behind this book that you might know him in the power of his resurrection oh praise god you can't know him until nobody really knew him until after he was resurrected amen praise god you know how they crucified him and how he was raised from the dead and how when he rose that morning mary magdalene went to the tomb how many knows that story and when she went there we've been crying and everything else i'll just bring it to the point where she see um sees a man in their graveyard and the bible says thinking he was a gardener is that right she had her own thoughts of who he was but it was the very jesus christ that she had walked with that she had eaten with that she knew familiar with and you may be familiar with the bible but then all you see is seeing him as a gardener or something else but you don't have a clear recognition of who he is oh praise god the spirit of god rides on the white horse of the word of god and it's him the white horse rider that you need to know you don't need to know just the horse that is using the medium the means you need to know him in the power of his resurrection and as he reveals himself to you and you can't get that by studying a bible school because he says eye open and no man shut and when i shut no man opens god has to give you that grace god has to give you that revelation that inspiration hallelujah did not i ordain you when before the foundation of the world before your mother had you in her belly i knew you and i ordained you to be a prophet he said to jeremiah and to every believer every christian god is saying i knew you i knew you i elected you are your day lord for you and i place you here in this age this time to represent me by the opening of the word hallelujah praise be to god amen she thought he was a gardener imagine that she claimed she was familiar with the word but yet the word seemed to be a stranger to her when the word got resurrected the resurrected word seemed like a stranger to her it's all right if i talk like this i'm just taking my time praise the name of the lord to talk to you so that you might understand here that the difference between just the word and the resurrected word is that right for the word as you know was entombed for centuries within these denominational gates of the romish church and the enthuse of the word down through history but then god began a resurrection of the word through luther wesley same three days but spiritually now right back up to pentecost up to our day and time the word of god has been resurrected and raised up again and we have been given that word now being revealed to us now not an angel at the tomb there telling you he's not here he's not here he's risen uh he he's written up from the dead but but god sent an anointed messenger in this last day to tell us that that he is not there he's risen praise the lord hallelujah he's raised up and he's alive forevermore he's gone from just being in a natural body back to the spirit body son of man son of god son of david you see god changing his office moving by his holy spirit glory to god so she did not know him but she thought he was a gardener she only recognized him when he called her name praise god and when god calls your name by the opening or the unsealing of the word of the book then you'll recognize your name being called as an individual hallelujah oh praise god i might as well speak spanish or greek or something if god hasn't given you a revelation but if god gives you a revelation it's cure and it's clear but my goodness god called her name he knows your name how many of you know that he knows your name praise god and i'm not talking about my name john or james or jim but your real name that he knew you by before the foundation of the world when he tell them disciples i had joy with you before the foundation of the world amen i had joys with you before the foundations hallelujah he knows your name praise god you see just like how when he came down call his name when he gets down here call his name jesus but that's that's his earthly name that's the name we know him by when he comes to earth right but it's the same way when you come here your mother and your father gave you a name but that's not the name god knows you by that's just a name for you to be recognized here on this earth but god knows you by your real name out there and when the word of god is preached hallelujah your name is in this word so when a preacher really preaches the word and he hits your name you might know what your name is because of your spiritual amnesia condition but when that name is called and spoken it makes something move in your heart i don't care if your back is turned and somebody called your name you turn around because you want to know if it's you amen and when the word of god is preached no matter how steep you are in sin unbelief or doubt and the word of god is speech it strikes a chord within your soul amen your tympanic membrane of your ears begin to resonate because you recognize that you heard something praise god something struck your soul amen the deep crawls to the deep and the deep must respond amen hallelujah praise be to god hallelujah i want you to know it's the very truth amen glory to god hallelujah amen listen one day after jesus had was crucified dead buried and raised again the disciples didn't recognize he was raised and they were walking going back to ms with a sad heart because they feel the lord was now gone and while they were walking the bible tells us how out of the bushes their step the man and the man began to speak to them and say why are you so sad why are you troubled what's going on and what was their answer to him if you will look in your bible luke 24 18 don't do it now but just so it's there they asked him are you a stranger here are you a stranger here that you would ask us what happened and they begin to tell him how jesus of nazareth was crucified and everything else and there were his believers and followers and and and now he's gone the lord is gone right oh my brother sister you see what i'm saying these men had walked with him they had eaten with him yet that slept on the trees and in caves with him they went fishing with him and yet when he rose with his resurrected body they did not recognize him the same word but now in a resurrected form they did not recognize him and that is what i'm trying to tell you that sometimes when i preach like this people don't recognize what you're talking about you sound like you're out of space or you're missing a screw somewhere right but they don't realize what is going on from ms they walked all day long talking with him amen praise god and then the bible says when they said art that was strange i hear the scripture will tell you for their eyes were holden in other words their eyes weren't open they were still spiritually blind they knew the word in person they walked with the word for three and a half years they're at the bible they slept with the bible they studied it from cover to cover they walk with it in every way and yet when it comes back now in a in a revelation form they say art thou a stranger here for their eyes were holden amen then the bible continues on then the bible says he explained to them the scriptures from moses and the prophets he began to explain and show to them that it was christ all the way amen it was christ in the substitute cripes in all the shadows christ in the types christ in the high priest christ in every tradition that they had the tradition was only a shadow on the wall of time pointing to his coming amen praise god and if you have a hand here and a shadow hits the wall you got to have the reality somewhere else the reality has got to be there but you keep following the shadow this is not the day of shadows at evening time it shall be light light again for this hour that we are living in praise peter god hallelujah amen that didn't realize that it was jesus that they were talking to they didn't recognize it they didn't realize it was him praise god and that didn't recognize it until he got them into a little house when he said master come in and have a meal with us don't go praise god until you come and sick with us and when he got them into the little house then he says peace be unto you and he broke the bread hallelujah and the way he broke it is the way he used to break it when he was there with them physically and when they saw that they recognized and the bible said it is the lord all glory to god hallelujah may you recognize it is the lord god in his resurrected body the word in a revealed body not just the word but the revealed word you see people wants to argue on the body they want to like they dispute over moses body they want to argue over the world they debate the word but truth is stated truth once you have arrived at the foundational truth of god's word no nothing can move you shift your left back frontway because you've seen the truth it can't be changed it's one truth the devil tried to tell you there's many truths your truth my truth his truth her truth even make up songs about these truths but there's only one truth and god said let me be true and every other man's be alive amen praise the name of the lord glory to god hallelujah amen got you inside the house and that's where he likes to get every one of us he likes to get you in the little room all by yourself and sometimes it takes for god to get you in the little room of your own heart where that quiet voice just begins to speak with you that's why when you pray it's not always praying and just keeping a lot of loud noise or praising god all the time sometimes you gotta shut down everything and just get quiet in the presence of the lord and be still and then you'll start to know that i am god because he starts speaking to you in this little room of your heart like no man can talk to you and when he speaks to you you'll know he's talking to you because god will respect us god will tell you anything whether you get mad sad glad or whatever he'll speak to you and let you know what he has to say to you in the little room of your heart praise god and i thank god that that's a place that i can escape to any time and whenever i want i can escape to that little room in the presence of the living god hallelujah amen yes my brother sister you find that do you believe that a person or even you may be spiritually blind sitting here today listening to the word you're looking at me and you see me and you're saying how can you tell me i'm blind because i'm seeing you how can you tell me i'm blind i'm seeing this i'm reading it just like you i believe the bible just like you i go to church just like you i'm seeing it how can you tell me that but how could you be spiritually blind right i'm blind to the things around you of course you're blind to electronic waves passing through you're blind to the tv pictures are going through the room right now you're blind to all these things taking place you can't see that because you're not of that dimension is that right it takes the quickening power the holy spirit to put you there before you can recognize that but praise god hallelujah amen because look at them at the emails when he came surely they loved the lord jesus they loved him just as much as you loved him and we love him and they think that he was dead hallelujah you come out on a sunday morning like this and i'm preaching the gospel and many other preachers preaching the gospel and you think that this is just uh fairy tales or a story tall from 1900 years ago that has now become a tradition and turned into a religion and now we have churches built on this religion and on this fate and and we just keep it and we just go like that i want to tell you that's not so we are serving one who is alive a living god he is alive forevermore he lives and reigns forevermore praise god our foundations is not on fiction but upon this rock i'll build my church upon revelation of the word of build my church on his resurrection will build the church amen praise god hallelujah let me quote here out of the seven compound names of jehovah are you a stranger here think of it thinking of him just as a stranger he had walked with them act with them slept with them for three and a half uh years and and walking by his side and they didn't know him just imagine they were in jesus's church he was their pastor they heard every sermon that jesus preached and yet when he came with his resurrected body stood right in front of them they were spiritually blind they did not recognize him they didn't recognize who was talking to them you see oh my see that was stranger here and he said oh you fools and slowing heart to believe and to know really what the prophet had said to you i am i'm less saying what what's here amen and he went back in the scriptures and hearing him teach them for three and a half years six months they would have recognized that teaching that they had received for three and a half years six months directly from jesus the word out to the word itself but still there was something holding that they could not see beyond the written word amen amen they did not know that he was risen he's just a story and people just all they think that they have to do is make sure that they stay close to jesus and know how to pack his body they pack his body away oh my i tell you but they don't realize that he is not here he's risen he's alive he's a resurrective this is just a representation this is just a starting point i'm preaching here but this is just like a a springboard for for the swimming pool right you come off of this so that you can enter into the next round and bring the word of god the food of the and the bread of life the spirit of god back to his people amen praise the name of the living god amen praise god oh my praise god hallelujah you could walk with him and you don't even know it do you know that walk with him and don't even know it hallelujah get out of a sick bed when you come out of your sick bed you turn around how many of you turn around you thank the doctor thank the doctor for bringing you out of the sick bed but really you should have thanked the doctor and then thank you doctor and i appreciate what you did but back of all that really it was jesus christ that did that hallelujah it was jesus christ that did that because the doctor can do cut and sow and do whatever he has to do but god still has to do the healing god has to do the deliverance he can give you the medicine but god still has to deliver you they say oh i'm going to give you this medicine i'm going to give this i'm going to do that and then i'll let nature take its course what nature it's god it's jesus christ you've got to recognize him amen many times the unrecognized presence of god in our lives and we don't recognize that he is the one that has done it is doing it and will do it for you as you believe him in the word who kept you from an accident you see oh no but you he kept you from the accident uh you know you turn around you thank the the driver of the hair vehicle and tell him how smart he was and how quick your reaction and your mind was and your intellect is very sharp and everything else and you swiftly you knew exactly which way to swing the wheel and all of that sort of stuff but amen but behind it all it was christ it was jesus christ that did that my brother sister hallelujah amen we're not just looking at the natural things but back of it all is god himself working in the shadows watching over his own and bringing us back to himself for his glory amen praise the name of the lord maybe you were in a state of depression and you're worrying where your next meal is coming from where your rent money is coming from how are you going to make your car payments and maybe some kind-hearted neighbor come and help you out or gave you some food to eat and you thanked that person that woman that man but really behind all of that it was christ working through that man or that woman to glorify himself amen it's christ not the one dead back and put in a grave back there but the resurrected one the glorifying jesus that's fulfilling his word to give him glory and honor praise the name of the lord i want you to see here brother sister that one also around this resurrection time how that peter you know like a lot of people today well you know they say jesus is risen you know but jesus is dead and the prophet is gone so many years and uh i'm tired of that i go fishing amen they're fishing around to find some new thing fishing around to believe something and while they were out fishing the bible said they were fishing all night and while they were in that denomination throwing out the net to win a few souls a fishing all night and when they came closer they saw a man standing on the shore and stranger on the shore who is this stranger on the shores of tiberias and right now one can visualize how it is because i've been there to the lake tiberias you've been there too lag time beers where they catch the the fish even now they still catch those fish they're in lake tiberias and my brother's sister a stranger standing on the shore and uh children have you any meat and one of them said wait a minute that is the lord uh the voice the the tone of voice that's not to be the lord hallelujah there's a certain sound to the genuine gospel brother sister there's a certain sound to it that you'll recognize that that's the voice of god speaking to your soul and right away the bible says peter was dressed like a fisherman of course he didn't have on those shirts you know just there with his shorts on and everything else rough and ready and the bible said when you see he they say it is the lord and he looked and he realizes the lord the bible said that peter jumped out to that denominational boat and jumped right into the world he jumped in the water he jumped and began to swim in it and came right to the shore right to the lord jesus christ hallelujah glory to god and when they got there the bible said jesus already had fish and bread already cooked and ready for them to eat oh praise god let me tell you god has a store god has a storehouse god has something for you in his storehouse there's fish there's bread hallelujah it's already there oh praise god i'm glad that i have partaken of the seven course meal by the lord the greatest chef the world has ever known jesus christ served the seventh seal mystery of the word of god to us and i thank god i've eaten every course of it glory to god and i'm just filled with him and i thank god for the word i thank god for his presence and his person amen glory to god hallelujah amen glory to god stranger on the shore amen oh praise god hallelujah brother sister i tell you maybe you can take some of these thoughts and turn them in the messages are now a stranger here can you imagine having a bible college and he's a stranger in there they want to discourse apologetics and hermeneutics and eschatology and all of these lofty marvelous subjects and how to preach topically and expositionally and so on and so on so on and this and that and it got him to the side he's off to the side ah that was stranger here are you a stranger in the court the stranger in the white house you're a stranger in the school put him out here put him out of there put him out there and he got to be outside his church knocking on the door to come into his own church in the last day they won't let him in because they have a concept of how they think the word of god should be preached and declared they got their own prefigured ideas of how it should be and they wouldn't let him be free to say whatever he wants to say for his glory and for his honor amen is he a stranger in this age that we are living in think about it what you are hearing for the glory of god amen stranger on the shore i'm showing you he was a stranger to them on the road to emmaus and again here he's a stranger to them standing on the shore the same one they walk with for three and a half years can you imagine hearing every sermon that he prays and still not recognizing who he was being a christian following this bible and following this message following all your years and still not recognize who he is praise god hallelujah amen what are you talking about i'm talking about the living god i'm talking about standing there and watching the clouds of glory move through a church over the congregation and go like this and back out the walls being inside of the church you know that right here in stoney creek and the word being preached and they take the photographs there is a pillar of fire see in this very same thing matter of fact look it's there still there but back then it was in the wall of the old church they take the picture i have a picture somewhere listen we're not serving some imagination the devil trying to get the people to come down that to bring it down to the front we just we're worshiping and having church we're not just having church brother sister we come to commune with a being that's in here that we can't see with our eyes but i don't know about you but i got goosebumps all over me i can sense his divine presence and his power that he's really a praise god he's the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change he doesn't lie he's the same god as there ever was amen 20 years 20 22 years old watch that great ball of fire come out of the bushes and move like that and watch my relatives to make sure that i wasn't just under some illusion or something like that am i seeing right or whatever and watch it go like that slowly and they came up what's that what's going on bro why what is that and all of a sudden when he recognized that he was recognized right up into the heavens and disappeared what is that you're telling me another story here now just to know you believe that you don't believe it is up to you but when he wants to he will appear when he wants to he'll disappear when he wants to he'll come on the scene god proving his word listen we're not i'm not standing here presuming i'm telling you what i see and know but from the word of god from experience in the word of god amen from personal experience what i recognize in the word of god oh praise god and the demons also know that i know and i they believe it and they tremble and they come out by the grace of god amen because they know it's the truth hallelujah amen wow the great i am the mighty god hallelujah the unrecognized presence of the living god one day on a hot day you know they looked and saw a great crowd coming up because you know jerusalem is on hills amen mountains they call it but you know and here it is that they saw the crowd coming and in the front of it is jesus sitting on a on a white donkey amen and he is coming up there in a people throwing the branches hosanna for him that cometh in the name of the lord and oh praise god and the shouting hallelujah and the firefighters come out lord can't you tell your people to quiet them all these hallelujahs and praise god and shouting and throwing that how could that be proper church behavior proper church behavior you know how to behave yourself in church hold your emotions you should be able to control yourselves and none of this wave in you oh glory to god hallelujah no you should be able to like queen elizabeth praise the lord god bless her heart but but we're not here for that we're here to give god glory we're here to praise god we are the given of glory and praise and honor that's due to his glorious name heavens and earth are praising you honor glory power belong it unto the lord lord of god revelation 1 here he stands in the midst of the seven churches in the sevenfold glory of the resurrected christ the shining power of god's power to transform moving across his entire being and there he is walking up and down among the churches amen we know the last church edge here but you think he's still walking you think he's still moving you still think he's here he is here thank god he is here he's still with us he is still walking the line with the word of god hallelujah amen and he's coming up the mountain amen we're on the donkey and coming in and you know what the question was brother branham preached on this and many other preachers who is this a stranger again they don't even know the word they don't even recognize the word that was sent to their day because the word was in the form of a man and the man's name happened to be jesus christ now he's come back in the word form and they still don't recognize him because they're looking for the man that was back there they're tied into that history and looking back to that man here so when he changes his form or as the greek says and morphe and he comes back now but in word form they don't recognize him in the word form they don't see him that's the same god moving amen we come through the son of god ages amen moving in the prophets moving in the patriarchs amen then we come to the son of man age when he comes in the form of the son of man manifested manifesting the fullness of the word of god and then he says you know i've got to go away so that the comforter can come so he changes the form again from son of man and goes back to being son of god and then here the son of god holy ghost ages come upon the people in the baptism the holy ghost the power of god and the spirit of the living god but it's changing again back to son of man again because he promised it in the word of god that as it was in the days of noah as it was in the days of lot so shall it be when the son of man is being revealed amen son of god son of man son of god son of man then he goes back to being son of david why because that's the word going back to the jews but son of man because that's the word coming to the greeks and the gentiles who say sirs we would see jesus the same word but he just keeps changing just like his father's son holy ghost but not three gods one god amen hallelujah just god moving god making himself known by his uh manifestation of his great titles of his person and his entire being amen hallelujah glory be to god hallelujah amen unrecognized presence of god working and moving in his word hallelujah i thank god he's the same yesterday today and forever you know in the bible jesus one day said hallelujah amen one day you'll see the son of man ascending up from where he come from and they said what's he talking about we know he come from nazareth so what's he talking about going back where he come from amen and the bible says and that was a hard saying john chapter 6 and they walked away and walked no more with him think about it they said we can't see this now he's carrying things a little too far eat my flesh and drink my blood and the bible said but they did not understand that he was speaking not of his actual bodies not encouraging them to become cannibals but he was speaking about you know the bread the wine you know the word the spirit that we are partaking of in this day and this time and they walked away and he didn't even bother to explain oh if jesus really loved them he would explain to them no he didn't explain because the whole thing is by election amen it's by election not not persuasion amen it's not begging you to love him or begging you to love the word no sir oh my i tell you so here it is listen i quote here today we have a lot of hot dead plants called christians somebody you have to spray them constantly baby them humor them and will you give me fellowship will you come over and do this will you cooperate with this will you do this or that or you bunch of hot dead plants we need some genuine christians born of the spirit of god that will take no cooperation don't need no nothing else nobody else nothing else they don't want nothing they just love him and want to serve him amen jesus turned to his disciples the ones that remained with him and i'm quoting and says will you also go do you want to go to and he said i chose 12 for you and one of you is a devil you see judas was chosen but i won't talk about that now judas was also chosen but uh one is a devil right you say oh i seen the word i seen the word look i was casting out devils i was given miracles i was having signs and wonders that's no proof and nothing judas had all of that amen the bible said they all come 70 of them with him with them they come back rejoicing he said don't rejoice at that that the devils are made are subject to you but rejoice if your names are written in heaven in other words you've done all that and if your name is not on that book what's the use what's the use of it all amen but my friends we no longer have to sing the old thank you him is my name written there on the page white and fair no we don't have to sing it like that we're not wondering if our names are written there we are certain of god we recognize that our name is on the book hallelujah and it was not now put on the book yesterday when i repented the altar but my name was on the book before the foundation of the world i only now recognize it but it was already there because god is eternal and you don't now get eternal life is that right that's what got that professor so mad at me so how can you call say the person now get eternal life eternal means and you taught me right without beginning and without ending so how are you going to get eternal life on this certain day that you are whoa no the person had to have it but maybe they weren't conscious of having it until they woke up to recognize they had it amen which is why we use the term revelation they woke up to recognize that they have it amen and now they know they are born again why because you were born somewhere else already so now you are born again praise god by the grace of god hallelujah born not to the will of man not of the persuasions of man not the blood of man but by the will of god the word of god the revelation of the holy spirit making himself known glory to god hallelujah amen wow what a day and a time amen think of it one is a devil and that's when peter made those words lord where shall we go where are we going to go now what's the fountain of eternal life amen you are the identified fountain of life amen you see judas had walked the same time with them and he walked right with him but he couldn't see it he couldn't see it but the real ordained of god the real genes of god the real soul of god that was in god before the foundation of the world that is in you that's really got the spirit of god in you tonight you were here in christ before he was even the fullness of the word you were in him he was the fullness of the godhead bodily a prophet here a patriarch there another prophet here another patriarch there oh my but when he came what was he you me every one of us that's a part of god he was the fullness of the godhead expressed bodily oh praise god and you were a part of that amen reconciling the world to himself is that right praise god it's not jesus just bringing the people to god but he was reconciling the world to himself but he was because he was god in another manifestation of himself or office of himself amen a gene you were a word of god an attribute of god from before the foundation of the world then you walk with him here on the earth and you talk with him there on the earth you suffered with him died with him at calvary rose with him and in him and now you're sitting in heavenly places in christ hallelujah how do you see it in heavenly places because with the revelation you have come to our rest is that right you sat down you seated because you caught the fullness of the word of god making itself plain and clear and known to you glory to god hallelujah i'm so glad that he is my lord and he is the same yesterday today forever let me give you a couple of scriptures here in the very luke 24 45 in emmaus amen after he now in his resurrected form began to explain and open the scriptures to them the bible says then opened he their understanding that they may understand the scriptures so they were walking with him with their white eyes wide open all those years seeing him and yet the bible says here then only then did he open up their understanding that they may begin to understand the scriptures so my aim and point that i've made and i'm making today is that you could have followed this word for that doesn't matter as we say in uh caribbean parlance you could have followed this word for donkey years and still not understand understand it in your head understand it by intellect not that you don't have reasoning but by revelation the resurrected christ making himself known to his own oh praise god hallelujah aren't you glad that jesus has a table for spread where the saints of god are fed can the worship leader song leader come right now glory be to god hallelujah of course there's more i can continue to say but i believe that you uh we are in the middle of the manifestation of the resurrection to the people of this day let me repeat manifestation of the resurrection to the people of this day by revelation is that right praise the lord may the great holy spirit grant to you that we may continue to walk in to this marvelous season and time as we go into the season of christmas i will continue of course to preach the word of god and when we get to uh close to that time then i will touch on a christmas message and speak on that and trust that the lord will speak to your heart and my heart also at the end of the year we will have our usually usual watch night service amen then we shall have the lord's supper we haven't had it for quite a while but we shall have the lord's supper in that watch night service praise the lord so come believing go rejoicing of praise the lord we know what's going on up there in the world we'll keep every possible protocol that we can but we must have the lord's supper and the washing of the saints feet as a memorial and as an in obedience to what the lord jesus has told us according to his word amen so i want you to be prepared for that that god may speak to our hearts and lift us up constantly in the opening of the word you see you know i was thinking about it people are going to say brother simon every time you get them to preach you're talking about the revelation of the word opening off the word manifestation of the word what are you talking about that is just to tell you that there's something going on supernatural that i don't have words to explain to you that uh broke into something that not broke into something broke into jesus christ broke into the revelation of him that i i can't give you in words you have got to experience it yourself and you've got to have the word open itself to you yourself amen and i can't help it because it has got a hold of me i don't know half the holy ghost the holy ghost got me and i've become a prisoner and a love slave to jesus christ and i trust you are too uh to that way where god can move you and the sons and daughters of god they go where he lists him you know for the wind blows feather in the wind in other words the spirit of god moving in the soul of the believer and i thank god is the same yesterday today and forever brother would you come just lead in a song or so and then i'm going to ask brother uh hutchinson um is it in your heart did you want to say something i know because if you try to preach a whole message i'm not that kind of preacher i'll have to tell you to step down but praise god i know you're a man of discipline and you you're a man that knows but what what is it that they used to teach us stand up speak up and then shut up right that's that's exactly how we solomon said you got to know when to put a knife to your

season where we have been reminded amen of him coming into the world as the pastor says amen not another god amen and not as a son although he was said to be the son of god amen but has god himself

but it's good to get a call amen just to say we love you and we are praying for you amen we have not you know sometimes you don't see someone come to church for a long time it would seem like you forgot them or they think you forget them amen we don't want to do that we want to just call and says god bless you amen i always want to leave this star to go with the message be not conformed amen but stays transformed stay transformed amen the lord has bought us from that state and bring us over here let's stay that way amen in this season lots of people is conforming you know and i already

40 days of prayer amen amen [Applause] and we don't just want it to be 40 days and then you stop praying right that's just a program or a plan but when it gets a hold of you and it's your purpose it's in your heart every christian reads their bible and they pray every day amen not as a routine not as just a prayer habit but because it's in their heart their love for god causes them to pray and then they pray unceasingly and they pray all the time because it just comes out of them they're talking to god whether they're working whether they're home washing playing school whatever it's within their heart something happens quickly they ask god lord help me with this problem lord amen lord help that person i've actually had a joy praying for people passing by help them lord i can see that man has
