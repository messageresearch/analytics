this [Music] morning brother Char come and open us with a word of prayer and U just used to be a a deacon here the head Deacon here one of the foundation stones of uh this congregation they both worked on this building put everything they had into it it's funny thing I was thinking about a foundation stone this morning you would think that if something is a foundation own and you moved it away that the place would Shake not so not With God all he does is move his foundation stone and make him a foundation stone somewhere else praise the Lord and that's the way it is with the believer what God does for us is awesome isn't it hands up at one more time for that prayer request brother Tom going to come and bless us and may give us a word after he pray praise the Lord amen let's bow our hearts and our heads show we subject that we honor the Lord father we thank you so much lord it's such a blessing father to fellowship with Saints of light precious Faith Lord to come back to the roots Lord Jesus I just pray for the needs for the worship Lord you're faithful father you're always faithful Lord to meet the needs of your congregation Lord we just commit the service into your

months she's precise I'm not but uh it's such a blessing to see the numbers being added to the fellowship and as uh brother M says a foundation stone I don't I don't feel that I just feel I was doing what God put in my heart to do and just so much a part of this ministry and you know when God sends you somewhere um the greatest pleasure and I've said this before is that you can be released from your other obligations and I thank this congregation and Pastor Simon for letting us go not questioning and letting us do what God has us to do the doors were open and things are moving down there and send our greetings from the fellowship there in uh yville Connecticut from Pastor Elijah and the Saints there for Ruth and Josh and little Lilia and emilyn two little Jewels uh were just uh blessed to have grandchildren that we can uh reinforce the word of God in their hearts and you know little Lilia Sharon was uh she was sick and Sharon was putting her to bed and Sharon says to her Lilia do you want Grandma to pray for you she says oh no Grandma Rebecca prayed for me she has a puppet named Rebecca and she had Rebecca pray for her she's only 2 years old so I know we have the opportunity to place these things in our heart in a young age and just keep pressing the battle and put the Lord first you know prayer is the power of the church um we felt led to uh bring a video up here for my mom and my dad the Lord's been moving on their hearts and it's called the war room it's made by the same people that created the movie Fireproof and those other ones what a marvelous video if you get a chance to watch it the war they sat through it and uh I know they're blessed so Saints uh pray for us we'll pray for you don't leave the war room we're in a battle God bless you praise God anybody
