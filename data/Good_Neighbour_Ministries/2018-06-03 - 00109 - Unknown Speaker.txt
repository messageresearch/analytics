like me my teachers we have two Sabathia and my voice goes up when I get excited and our fibula car is by in nature but your words are just the spark to strike whether I said Satan are useless take me there's no difference right but Holy Spirit isn't sometimes I don't speak it out in my mind I talk these are wrong and you tried to do some talk to him right so first off especially our praise to God for evermore Alleluia amen yes sir in the so here now that we were entering into a new world after this crucifixion and this great resurrection so we're not living in church legalistic rules fear that we take it the word revelation that is building the people thing is pretty sturdy living in the yes sir and now we're happy that we're living in a in a world where grace happens every day grace will be in a state of bridge that's happening to us every single day praise God because I can just stick around I can forgive me Lord grace I can just react to the wrong way Oh grace we're living in that area that wonderful state of gods Greece amen hallelujah and a plan that is happily with a regular basis the whole watch of men and women who see the word clearly and believe the Word of God for this great power even raced up a middle path of fighting this up we have to remember that sin that safe at that same table when he said remember Jesus that he said the one who hands that the betray me is at the same thing as price so we have to be living so carefully amen that we don't be part of the spirit of truth that would betray the Lord amen a remember this betrayal is one of the things that is mentioned in all four Gospels usually one will have something for the other one may not have it the next one happened to the other may not have it you know but in this case this betrayals mentioned it all and so from that time he said to remember he has be personally but remember how easy it is to be thinking that he really was gonna lose Jesus or Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] bird garbage in there which was a symbolism which needs help right a pleasure fight my goodness it's so easy for any one of us to the Train the Lord so you stand there by description always as you walk every day moment by moment remember Jesus let's pray communion meditation will remain within your hearts our gracious God every father we thank you for these thoughts we shared the believersí of the day we pray in the name of Jesus the somewhere even plot from what life one part of it was staying in the minds and hearts of each believer as they need some part of the spiritual food it will sustain them in the day of trouble from protect and keep them in this hour we asked in the name of Jesus the musicians come in this we prepare ourselves to take the Lord's Supper amen how now a lot of these denomination things remember Jesus remember the Lord in remembrance of me letting up for the Lord suffered important I think if you didn't have to remember the details in the science and the crucifixion even true surely be remember that but they're emphasizing that but we are about two people and that our revelation is rapture in faith or rupturing revelation for this hour so they were looking to the crucifixion but we are looking to the rapture yet now to here so let me come together for the bark supper yes we know he died for us we're watching for the great resurrection and rapture that is to come remember the Lord is coming back again and we got one walk through this ludus and night forever amen hallelujah the night Manila amen but what did the soccer state what joy is covered in the morning praise the Lord hallelujah yeah I know it when is frightening crucifixion day but sunday is coming sunrise come let me you love me dying is a rising very justified risings again [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh picture his bottom I suppose would you ask the Lord to wash just sensibly and say that you was a year apart might whether it were thought are indeed ask the Lord to bless you according to the scriptures 1st Corinthians 11:28 but lift a man or woman examine him for herself so let them eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for they eat and drink are hardly eaten drink damnation to themselves not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep but if we judge ourselves we will not be just but when you want judged we are chastened of the Lord and we should not be compared with the world therefore my brethren with something
