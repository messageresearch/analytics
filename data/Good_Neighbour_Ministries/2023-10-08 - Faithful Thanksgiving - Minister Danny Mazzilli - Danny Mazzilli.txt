thank you worship team praise God it's good to be in the house of the Lord and it's good to be here especially on a special uh occasion a special time a special season amen praise God Thanksgiving is a special season praise God it's always been a little extra special in my home because uh right around Thanksgiving is when my wife has her birthday praise God so we get a double blessing we get extra

we certainly uh appreciate you very much you are a tremendous blessing in this ministry in all that you do I know that you do it with a pure heart and we appreciate it God bless you amen praise God so this morning um we're in Thanksgiving season and I know that um you know it's a time where a lot of people get together and you know the thing that you know when you when you say Thanksgiving what do you think of turkey right turkey you know everybody thinks of turkey I don't know what it is you know I was in the food business for so many years and my God as soon as it started to come around the end of September everybody started hey I need to order my turkey I need to order my turkey you know and so people get all excited about turkey but um you know we get all excited about the word amen because we're very thankful for the word of God Amen and that's what we're going to be speaking on this morning we have a simple thought this morning on faithful Thanksgiving that's the title faithful Thanksgiving and you know uh you can draw from that many different contexts are you being faithful and being thankful and are you a faithful uh revelated son or daughter of God having a true understanding of the Thanksgiving and the gratitude that we have for what God has given us in this day and in this hour amen praise God we should be praise God let us pray before we go to the word this morning Father we truly are grateful this morning Lord and we enter your courts with Thanksgiving in our hearts this morning we come with one desire Lord and that is to just have that time of fellowship with you Lord where you will will take control Lord that um Lord the the mystery of preaching is uh something that never ceases to amaze us Lord but we we realize that it's it's your gift it's your gifts to this world Lord where you have the opportunity to speak to the needs of your people and Lord the if the people recognize that the gift is something that they operate it makes it even uh greater Lord because now you can answer so many needs all at one time Lord that's what makes you so great so this morning as we assemble Lord we ask your anointing upon the word of God upon the speaker and upon the hearers oh God let your anointing your spirit just take absolute control May the spirit of Revelation move through the word of God this morning simple thoughts but when you put your spirit into that word it becomes life Grant it we pray father father bless each and everyone remember all those that are on the air that are on the YouTube Lord that could not be here may you bless them may your presence go and be with them and overshadow them and may they Lord receive the portion that you would have for them today Grant it we pray in Jesus name amen praise God God bless you Saints let's go to our scripture um let's put up this first slide amen praise God you know I saw you know I did some research um over the last few days came across a few different things that that you know that I just felt blessed when I saw them and this was one of them you know I see these young people and and and uh Lord is raising up many young people right here in our midst that are giving thanks and knowing that he is good amen praise God we had some tremendous meetings here with brother um dig uh in September and many young people were blessed um you know I had the opportunity to even talk to some of those young people that were here that were not a part of this ministry and they were saying that testimonies are still ringing out testimonies are still being spoken young people that's uh that that their lives were were uh God interceded at at at an appointed time in their lives and we're just so grateful because God is doing something in our young people and so we give thanks for them and uh we ask that God continue to bless and prosper their way let's go to the next slide our scripture this morning says I will offer to thee the sacrifice of Thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord amen you may be seated next slide our thought today is faithful Thanksgiving amen glory to God next slide 1 Thessalonians chap 5: 18 a very familiar scripture says in everything not some things not just when things go well and you know when things are going really good and you know I get a raise at work oh oh you know and or or or you know uh uh I get a a a new relationship and no in everything give thanks for this listen this is the will of God God in Christ Jesus concerning you concerning you God wants you to give thanks it's his will for you to recognize that this giving of thanks it all fits together in bringing you into a perfect understanding and revelation of who you are in the body of Christ amen praise God it's very important for us to have lips of Thanksgiving constantly giving thanks unto the Lord for all of his goodness amen amen praise God I remember you know I I remember when this message came to me I could not believe that God had actually allowed me to recognize his word in in in this day the living word for our day for this hour I could not express the Gratitude I was so grateful every time that we would assemble and come in into the house of the Lord I couldn't wait to see that man get behind the pulpit you know uh just just full of the the anointing of the Holy Spirit and hear God speak lip to ear to me because I believe that the Holy Spirit was speaking lip to ear I was re I it I knew it was the Holy Spirit speaking lip to ear because he was Discerning my life he was telling me where I came from he was telling me why this was the appointed time and season for you to receive re this word I looked at every single one of you in that small Little White Church on Winona and by the way you know it's funny like I I I go bike riding that's how I try to stay in shape and the other day I did a bike ride and I I I ended up all the way on Winona all the way into Grimsby there and I was riding with a friend and I said hey this is where my my my Supernatural experience with God started right here here on this road I said we 50 Road must be close by he goes yeah we just passed it back there it's the first time we'd ever gone that far on a on a bike ride and and it was amazing because it just brought me back down memory lane and I I remember every single one of you that were there I loved every one of you I said oh my God these are my brothers and sisters these are my real brothers and sisters you know you know that you know that experience that that that you maybe we need to go back back to that experience maybe we need to reminisce and and it'll it'll give us back that that that that Spirit of gratitude I used to I couldn't wait to assemble with you I couldn't wait to to to get into Fellowship because the minute we would get into Fellowship I would notice the anointing of God and the spirit of God would come into our fellowship and would speak between us and with us and tell us about ourselves tell us about uh you know where we came from and where we're going oh what a spirit of gratitude was on our hearts those those those early days amen let me tell you something that never should stop you should be having the best experience of your Christian walk with the Lord right now this should be the greatest time for you because he's still the same God he he never left he never uh would he never will will leave you nor forsake you you can be thankful to know that he will always be with you amen praise God we couldn't wait to get together we couldn't wait to Fellowship together we couldn't wait for those special services we knew that when a special service came that God was going to speak to us on that particular season Hallelujah well I believe today God wants to speak to our needs amen am God wants to speak and and let us know that we need need to start looking at our attitude and we need to have an attitude of gratitude amen praise God we need to look at the way that we're walking with God and how we're we're we're we're we're interacting with one another and are we still appreciating one another like we did back then you know time goes by and you know we start to get to know each other a little better and you know we start to see each other's strengths and each other's weaknesses you know and all of a sudden maybe you know know we're not so thankful for one another sometimes but that that God wants to God wants to blow that out of the water this morning God wants to bring us back into a an attitude of gratitude where we can appreciate one another we can appreciate each other's gifts and each other's blessings and and strengths and and and not look at the weaknesses understand that those weaknesses is what makes God strong amen amen you know what the the opposite of gratitude is pride pride when you're not thankful and you're you don't have a spirit of gratitude you start thinking that the things that are happening in your life is because you did it because you make it happen that's not that's not the spirit of God hallelujah the spirit of God is complete opposite he's he he can't wait to fellowship with you he can't wait to get that sweetness out of you that that joy out of you that that that part of you that sweet and loving and nourishing and edifying to the body of Christ amen praise God in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you you know that a thankful heart is a powerful weapon when we have a revelation on the attitude of gratitude being grateful for the things that are disrupting and bringing stress and Chaos into our lives when when when we take the power of the oppressor and we take that power of the enemy that oppression and we place it into the hands of God because you're thankful for all things working together for good you know what it does it puts the power of the oppressor into the hands of the Living God and now the power of Christ through a gratitude through a thankful heart starts to take over the situation amen praise God go to the next slide we're going to look at how the sacrifice of Thanksgiving leads to gratitude you need to practice Thanksgiving amen you need to have an attitude of Thanksgiving yes sir I believe that if you know like uh look at people that are always thankful they're happier people we're going to look at some things here go to the next slide gratitude is a constant mindset of thankfulness I think we need to become conscious and we need to start looking at everything in our lives and we need to have an attitude of gratitude we need to have have an attitude of thankfulness and we need to make it constant on a regular basis let me let me say this next slide gratitude now these are proven facts gratitude improves your brain and physical health because when you are grateful you are positive amen when somebody is negative their posture gets affected they start to lean over and cancer start come over and cancer starts to take over yes sir because negativity is not of God God is positive God already knows the end from the beginning and we've seen the end for us it's good it's real good amen it's an eternal Bliss it's eyes have not seen ears have not heard nor has it even entered into the heart of man what God has in store for each and every one of you that believes this word it improves your brain you know gratitude improves your brain functions it keeps you in a positive endorphin atmosphere you ever notice that when you're you know when when when you start to Fellowship you know my wife testifies of it all the time you know when she gets into Fellowship she says she starts to feel an atmosphere of of of Liberty and and and you know the the atmosphere becomes electrified she knows that that it's that it's real Fellowship it's it's something that you know what is that that's that's your endorphins that's your that's the presence of God it stimulates your brain amen praise God the next slide says gratitude creates happiness amen praise God when somebody Hey brother I'm happy to see you you're looking good these days boy you lost weight thank right away everybody gets happy oh thank you I really appreciate that you know because because gratitude creates happiness happiness when you appreciate your your friends when you appreciate your family when you appreciate your loved ones your brothers and your sisters it creates an atmosphere of Happiness amen gratitude next slide helps you sleep better yes sir it's true these are these are actual facts you know if you go and see a psychologist he he's going to tell you listen you know what all you've been doing here you've been sitting here for half an hour and all you've been telling me about is all the negative things in your life boy you must not sleep too well you must stay up all night thinking about all the negative things that are happening in your life because you can't possibly sleep well when all you're thinking about is the negative consequences the negative circumstances oh I'm getting old oh I'm feeling pain oh I'm I'm this oh I got to make the bill payment next month oh I you know like that will take away your sleep and do you know that when you don't get proper sleep it weakens you it makes you miserable amen it makes you grumpy it's true it's the truth that's why it's important to have a thankful attitude Amen to be grateful for all things regardless of what it is amen if you're grateful for the trial it takes the trial out of Satan's hand and puts it into God's hand amen Hallelujah and then all of a sudden you can overcome that thing because you know that God brought it into your life because it's going to work for good next slide gratitude is the anti antidote to toxic emotions you got to watch those emotions you got to watch when the enemy you know the greatest battle ever fought is still going on and it is the enemy attacking your mind and putting thoughts negative thought negative energy oh they looked at me this way they didn't greet me that way they did this they did that oh the boss never looked at me and said good morning to me this morning but he said it good morning to the other one there and all of a sudden you start to get miserable and your co-workers are looking at you and wondering what the heck's wrong with you today it's because you don't have a spirit of gratitude for the job that God gave you amen your boss God can deal with your boss don't worry about your boss God knows to deal with bosses amen praise God but God's working on your attitude God's working because your attitude in in a workpl and I learned this from a young age brother Chris I tell my wife all the time I brag on one boss that I started with back in in in early uh 1979 1980 this man he was a walking positive Revelation he would just speak positive about everything but he would still correct me hard and I couldn't quite understand it but but but all I wanted to do was model his ways of communicating with people and exalting and and praising them and lifting them up when they did right and it was genuine it was real and because of that positive atmosphere it changed my outlook it put me into a positive uh understanding of you know that you know that you can speak positive and what you speak and what you think about all day long is what you'll usually become and it's still true the thoughts that you dwell on and that you allow the enemy to to to put into your heart and cause you to be negative that will never produce a thankful heart that will never produce a right attitude and so I learned from a young age that my attitude would have an effect on my altitude yes in that job yes and from his influence on my life and the grace of God within three years of working in that company I had been promoted to sit at the right hand of the president of the company ordering raw materials for the company at an age of 22 or 21 years old making lots of money my father would say how much it was almost double what he was making and then he thought I was absolutely cuckoo when I left the job two years later to go on my own and lose my shirt that's why she stood beside me all those years she saw that that that entrepreneurial Spirit but she says but you just don't never give up no because I believe that that there is something that if we can hold to it if we can believe because I got into you know positive mental attitude and I I you know I started going to seminars and I said no I'm going to create a life I'm going to be rich I'm going to be a multi-millionaire I had all these Desires in my heart I said I don't care there's a power out there that can create and and you know all those things and it's all true but I didn't have a revelation of who he was I had no Revelation that he had a different plan for my life you had no revelation that God had a plan for your life to be right here fulfilling his word in 2023 amen but God had a plan amen and so your attitude will also have an effect on your altitude your attitude will affect how how how well you do in your business and how you your relationships with your friends and and the people that you are surrounded by gratitude improves relationships there you go it improves relationships next one gratitude opens the door to people and opportunities people like positive people people like to be around positive people because they're happy their atmosphere is Happy their their their way of doing things are more in a positive way when things go wrong they say okay we've we've we've we've made 20 mistakes that's 20 less than we've got to worry about let's keep going here because we're gonna hit number 21 or 22 and it's going to work you see that's the right kind of attitude not when you haveen an experience you know a lot of people I'll tell you something you need to let go of this one thing you need to let go of a past failure and trying to identify that past failure as something that will have an effect on your current status amen that's a demon from the pits of hell Jes you cannot hold on to those past bad experiences negative circumstance so somebody treated you a certain way and you didn't trust that person doesn't mean you don't trust anybody come on Saints you know we got to come out of that kind of stinking thinking amen past experiences bad you know we want to hold on to the good ones but sometimes we want to hold on to the bad ones even more and we stunt our growth we stunt our experience we stunt God what God wants to do in our lives because we're basing our you know oh well I've made that investment before and there's just no way I'm going near that I I bought stocks one time and I lost my shirt I'll never buy another stock in my life well I bought one last month that went up 10 times really yeah no I didn't but it's happened and it's going to happen again but but anyway you cannot have the kind of thinking that that because Satan deceived you in the past that that's going to control your future no sir amen not from from this day forward you're you're to leave those things in the past and you're to leave those hurts in the past you're you know if you've got some you oh he said this to me she said that to me I'll never forget it you're the one that's being hurt from it because you're not letting go you're not forgiving you're not leaving it in the past and you're carrying that weight with you and guess what that weight you're going to have to drag it unless you cut it away unless you you forgive and forget you're going to carry that weight and you're going to have you're not going to be able to have a grateful heart because your emotions are going to be controlled by your past experiences no longer amen we're not going to let that happen because many opportunities next slide gratitude is the evidence of maturity when you come to a place of true gratitude you start to look at everything you start to realize that everything is the grace of God coming into your life am amen next slide it says in Colossians chapter 2 verse 7 rooted and build it up in him and established in the Faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving you're growing in the faith you're being strengthened and matured by the word of God in this hour it's bringing you to a place of maturity and when you enter into that place of maturity everything you start to realize that everything is is something to be grateful for especially in this word of God amen God has called you to a message that that that you should be rejoicing night and day glory to God it's the grace of God we we need to be grateful for those things next slide and so just a quick review gratitude improves your brain and physical health gratitude creates happiness gratitude helps you sleep better gratitude is the antidote to toxic emotions gratitude improves relationships gratitude opens the door to people and opportunities gratitude is the evidence of maturity and see what it says there gratitude pleases God and brings his blessings praise God forever more look at the next slide Psalms 139 I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul know right well you need to be thankful that God created you that God placed you in his mind as an attribute of God you need to be thankful that that God has awakened you to the revelation of who you are this is what this scripture is telling me it says I was wonderfully made I'm I'm I'm a part of God I'm an attribute of God when you start to look at what the benefits are as an attribute of God you are going to Rejoice night and day you're going to take away all the power of the enemy when you recognize that as an attribute of God you can't even disbelieve God's wordes Satan wants to tell you that oh you did this you did that you know you did this before you did that before he likes to bring up all the things of the past but you can turn around because of the Revelation that you were wonderfully and marvelously made at as an attribute of God that you've got no power over me Satan because I never did it in the first place I'm Justified I'm Sanctified and I'm going to be and I am in the midst of being glorified by the word of God amen glory to God because this is the hour Psalms 13:5 next he says but I have trusted in thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation God has called you God has redeemed you you need to be thankful for that you need to be grateful for that because he's he's called you out of this world he's called you out of the chaos do you see what's going on out there listen this is not a coincidence that Israel is being attacked right here 50 years later after the young Kapur War back in 1973 these are these are things God said through his prophet he said watch Israel Israel is God's time piece look at the things that are happening look at the timing of these things look at the reality of what the condition of the world is amen you've been called out of that you've been called out of that situation you're not going to be going to war Hallelujah glory to God you're going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye you're going to receive the faith for a body change and you're going to be translated out of this Dimension by the grace of God not because of something you did not because of anything that you deserve it's God's grace it's God's plan it's God's Plan of Redemption amen praise God we Rejoice next next Psalm says 118 he says oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good because his mercy endureth forever you know that was David you know you know David you know like you know like look you can look back and you can look at at you know levels of gratitude you know when Moses was on the scene Moses brought the Ten Commandments and he would tell the people of Israel he would say listen God will provide all of your needs if you do this and if you do that and if you do this then God will bless you God will fill your barns God will do this and so the people what they were doing everything that they were doing they were doing because God was doing for them so they would give and they would get yes and that's one level of gratitude you know and you're living at that level of gratitude but you need to move on David he had a different Revelation on gratitude he says your mercy endureth forever because I make a lot of mistakes and I'm so thankful that Lord you're still there for me I'm grateful that you're there for me even when I blow up and even when I make mistakes and when I do things that I committed adultery and oh God your mercy endured forever and ever Lord I appreciate that I full of gratitude because of your mercy it endureth forever next slide I will praise thee for thou Hast heard me and art become my salvation in the midst of the battle in the midst of the trial you reach out and said Lord I'm grateful for this because I know it's going to it's going to change my life I know it's going to make me the better person that you want me to be Hallelujah next slide I Will Bless The Lord who hath given me counsel my Reigns also instruct me in the night season God will give you Revelation for every situation I don't care what comes into your life you are ordained of God as an attribute of God to be the word made flesh in this day and in this hour you are going to manifest God's purpose purp God's will all things work together for good to them that are called according to what his purpose his purpose and what his purpose is is to bring you into a full manifestation of a Son of God a daughter of God recognizing that you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you are the elected lady you are the church that God is going to translate out of this dimension in this hour and he will give you faith for whatever situation enters into your life I don't care what it is God is obligated because his word cannot fail Hallelujah do you think that that he did not know what Eve did back in the Garden of Eden listen Eve came out from the side of Adam she was a part of Adam she was the female aspect and attribute of Adam but Adam and Eve their name was what Adam she was him he was her Oh Glory to God hallelujah she was him she she could not be lost there's no way she could be lost because she was him he knew exactly what was coming down the road he knew exactly what needed to be done and Jesus knows exactly what you have need of God knows how he's going to call you what he's going to do to bring you out of your situation and your condition there's nothing that can keep you from the Rapture brother Hallelujah the Rapture is written all over you because it's a revelation of who you are glory to God amenu next oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness for his wonderful Works to the children of men aren't you grateful next slide let's move on here how the sacrifice of Thanksgiving leads leads to gratitude develop an attitude of gratitude next slide these are simple things these are really simple things you know I picked them up you know uh Rick Warren um couple of other ministers out there you know some really interesting thoughts and ways of approaching the word of God I appreciate them I filter them by the revelation of this hour and it becomes a blessing so don't be afraid don't be oh I only listen to the tapes you only listen to the tapes if you don't listen to the tapes there you know Saints what an hour what an hour where the people out there are so deceived they God did I I hear statements God didn't put a five-fold it was the prophet and God there's no Prophet than five-fold Ministry and then God no it's just the prophet and God everything that the prophet said that's all you need that's you don't need anything else do you know what they're saying they're saying that Jesus Christ is not the same yesterday today and forever in the midst of the people that the mighty Angel did not come down in 1963 so that the prophet could go off the scene we know the prophet and his message and every word that he said lined up with the word of God we're not afraid to say that we've got a revelation that it it's it perfectly lines up but if you're taking Christ and the five-fold ministry which is Christ in the five-fold ministry perfecting you and me in this day and in this hour if you take that out of the equation you're saying that Jesus Christ Ministry has finished and is only operating in the tapes I I can't see it it just doesn't even fit in any way shape or form do I believe the prophet absolutely I could not have come to this Revelation without it hallelujah it's progressive revelation it's what turned the hearts of the fathers back to the children the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers Revelations 10:7 the mighty Angel the introduction of the mighty Angel brother Brenham was the Earthly Angel he's not the Mighty Angel Hallelujah he was the one who God used his voice that's why they're called voice of God Amen Hallelujah glory to God we're not we're not saying we don't believe the prophet or we don't we don't listen we listen I listen to those tapes every day amen every single day and I get blessed and it it vindicates and it confirms the word and God speaks through it absolutely but don't tell me that there isn't a five-fold Ministry that can discern the thoughts and the intents of your heart because that's what called me it wasn't God's Prophet that called me it was Christ himself speaking under the inspiration of my pastor calling me re revela me by the word of God giving me the inspiration but but but it was the spirit of God writing the word it's always God it's always been Christ amen it's never not been Christ it's always been Christ so how can you put him in into into just lock them up into tapes you can't do it you can't do it Hallelujah three habits let's look at this amen not going to keep you long today three habits to develop an attitude of gratitude first habit singing unto the Lord amen thank you Jesus you know that that's an attribute of an attitude of gratitude amen Sing Sing unto the Lord look at the next verse the Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will Joy over thee with singing God rejoices around you God rejoices when you sing when you when you're singing you're praising God you're you're you're giving back to him the Praises you're it's the Deep call to the deep there's a revelation on your experience with God that when you're singing those songs it's God fulfilling his will his purpose his plan in your life and it pleases him amen praise God Psalms 147 next slide says Sing unto the Lord with Thanksgiving sing praise unto the upon the harp unto our God Amen praise God don't be afraid to get your guitar get your sing unto the Lord sing unto the Lord when you're when you're you're in your car and you're driving sing unto the Lord it brings his atmosphere that's why we sing in preparation for the word of God because he loves it when we praise Him Hallelujah let us come next slide let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving and make what a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms psalms of praise and glory and oh it's so good when we praise the Lord sister Marsha Hallelujah amen praise God let the word of Christ Colossians 3:16 let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms in hymns in spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord hallelujah next slide second habit of gratitude is giving back to the Lord giving back to the Lord you know that that is a that that if you've got a true revelation of gratitude and thankfulness in your heart you will give you will give you'll be a giver you'll every opportunity that comes up to you even if it's a quarter you can give get into the habit of being a giver don't be afraid to give give it's it's a powerful powerful Revelation and God loves a cheerful Giver amen I will freely sacrifice next I will freely sacrifice unto thee I will praise thy name oh lord for it is good I will freely sacrifice I will give you know listen it's easy to give you know when when God blesses you with $1,00 or $10,000 it's not as easy to give that ,000 it's a bit of a sacrifice but not if you've got Revelation not if you know that hey wait a minute he give me 10 he can give me a hundred he could give me a million it's not the money it's not the amount it's a sacrifice to give when somebody only has $2 and they put a dollar into that that was what Jesus was saying she gave more than all because she did it out of a sacrifice and a revelation of who she was she was worshiping who she was giving thanks to who her provider was who is your provider well you can trust God with your salvation oh I'm saved hallelujah praise God do you tithe nope so you don't trust God with your Finance you trust him with your salvation but you don't trust him with your Finance so do you really trust him is my question listen to Deuteronomy 16:10 and 11 and thou shalt keep the Feast of Weeks we're in that Feast right now unto the Lord thy God with a tribute of a free will offering of thine hand which Thou shalt give unto the Lord thy God according as the Lord thy God hath bless thee you see he was letting them know that hey God is going to bless you God is going to bless you financially God is going to bless your sheep God is going to bless your flocks he was telling them clearly God is going to bless you with all these things but he said You shall give unto the Lord thy God according as the Lord thy God hath blessed thee and thou shal Rejoice before the Lord thy God thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy thy man's servant and thy maid servant and the levite that is within thy Gates and the stranger and the fatherless and the Widow that are among you in the place which the Lord thy God hath chosen to place his name where has he placed his name in the body of Christ who are you a member of the body of Christ who are you a part of the household of the body of Christ does the body of Christ have a house does it have a place of worship does it have expenses yes it does all those things are part of the body of Christ and we need to have an understanding and a revelation of giving back to God what he has given to us it's a part of our Thanksgiving praise unto the Lord Psalms 116 177 says I will offer to thee the sacrifice of Thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord amen it's a sacrifice if it's not a sacrifice if it's not something as a human being it's not easy to let go of things it's just you know like people are hoarders people don't want to let go of things that's why their basements their garages everything gets packed full of stuff it's stuff here stuff there they don't want to let it go they go to get rid of it and all of a sudden a thought comes to them well maybe this one might be able to use it and they'll put it back and then they'll go grab something no you need listen you need to go and clean out your closets you need to go and give away all those clothes that you haven't worn in the last two years you're probably not going to wear them start to give start to give let let go of those things God will replace them with new things all of a sudden you're going to notice a blessing coming here a blessing come there that's how God works that's just the way we we that's the revelation we have as Sons and Daughters of God that we cannot exhaust God's blessings amen amen hallelujah Psalms or Proverbs 3:9-10 honor the Lord with thy substance God wants to give you he wants you to give something you need to oh I'm just going to go to church every Sunday and praise the Lord but I'm not going to give my offerings no that's not it he says bring a substance bring something unto the Lord he says with the first fruits of all thine increase show so shall th th barns be filled with plenty and thy pressence shall burst forth out with new revelation Hallelujah glory to God Amen you wantan to you want to grow in Christ you need to do the ABCs if you really want to grow Hallelujah you need to you need to get all those things back into order and be and be thankful in the right way and approach the Lord with Thanksgiving in your heart and be someone that's willing to give back the listen to Jesus here in Luke 6:38 give and it shall be given unto you good measure press down shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom God says I will get men to give into your bosom God can control your Finance amen God can bless your Finance don't fear be be willing to to be open to God's blessings in that area he says for with the same measure that ye meet with all it shall be measured to you again and other words if you've got a revelation to give and to give lots get ready for lots of blessings if you only want to give a little you want to be a little miser and you wanna you you don't want to give you know oh but no then just expect a little it's the law as you s you're going to re God wants you to grow in revelation God wants you to mature as a Son of God God wants you to raise the standard in your own life so that you can you can move out of that that that that that poverty mentality of just enough and move into a level of more than enough Lord I've been saying that for years I've been telling my wife for years because for many many years it was just just enough ju ah tired of this just enough you know oh I got to make that payment just enough I said I want more than enough I believe God can provide more than enough and so what we got to do we got to give more than we can we got to give more we got to do more we got to just sacrifice ourselves God's just not looking at your Finance God's also looking at your at your dedication in the house of the Lord oh yeah you can't be like the Catholics and just give I give my nickels and my dimes and I'm good I give my dollars I don't have to do anything else if you're called to this Revelation in this church in the body of Jesus Christ God has a purpose for you God wants to use you God wants to bless you God wants to use you to edify the body of Christ and you need to get into that position as a son or a daughter of God so that you can you can fulfill your part in the word of God so we can get out of here we need to fulfill the part of the word that we are amen praise God so you want to learn to give more you want to learn to give more of your time give more of your sacrifice your your your time sacrifice your efforts you know if things need to be done around the church Don't Be Afraid don't worry God will bless you I'm telling you God will bless you for your efforts Hallelujah next slide Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed that the field bringeth forth year by year God is just saying Hey listen a tenth a tenth of all that you earn whatever it is Bring It unto the Lord show me that you have a revelation of that amen praise God and then you'll see what he does for you in Malachi 3:10 he says bring ye all the tithes unto the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith sayeth the Lord of hosts if I will not open you the window open who open you open you the windows of heaven and pour you you you you you you a blessing pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough what not enough room to receive it listen last time I checked Royal Bank doesn't care how many zeros is after that number so Lord whatever it is let it come in Jesus name hallelujah praise God forever more thank you Jesus let's move on on here number three gratitude of communion with god oh this is important a lot of people they just want to come to church they just want to maybe sometime just pay their tithes and their offerings but they don't want to fellowship with the Lord they don't want that personal walk with God you know Communion next slide it says in 1 Corinthians 10:16 it says the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ now we're not talking about the literal blood here we're talking about communion in his Spirit communing in his anointed Spirit under the revelation of this hour feeding on the word of God and allowing the spirit of God to revelate you into your position as a son or a daughter of God Amen the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body which is the word of God Fellowship around the word getting into the word feeding on the word getting into into the house of the Lord every Wednesday night getting into those prayer meetings getting into the services on Sundays fellowshipping and feasting and pulling on God you know that that that that that it's it's it's a supernatural act when you come into the house of God when you truly have an understanding let's move on the next slide it says now my title was faithful Thanksgiving that's the title the lord gave me and and I I was saying Lord okay but what he was telling me was that you need to be full of Faith you need to have a revelation of Thanksgiving you need to you need to move into my thoughts and my mind and my my spirit because the spirit gives life to the word of God and when you come under this kind of revelation of true Thanksgiving of true gratitude it's Faith it's something that God gives you listen go to the next slide here he says Hebrews 11:6 says but without faith it is is impossible to please him so we could do all the things that we've been saying here we can get into a habit of having a a positive attitude and and and developing an attitude of gratitude and being thankful and and saying oh brother I appreciate you I thank you and this and that but without faith without knowing this message without knowing why God called you why God called you into this church into this message of the hour why are we different from the other churches why are we different and we are non- denominational what is it it's because God is a living God all those other churches out there we're not saying the people it's the systems they've taken the word of God and they've they've they've organized it they've put their own interpretations on the word of God when you do that you are pushing God out of the church when man starts to say no this is how it's got to be this is how we worship we believe in a trinity the father up there the son over here the Holy Ghost over there all three persons in one you don't have a revelation of who you're giving thanks to now you think you're giving thanks to the Living God but you're you're deceived you're under you know that the scripture says that all would be deceived that's right all in the last days all would be deceived except those whose name were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundations of the world that the whole world would go into a total deception you know that that's the that's the hour we are in right now right now this world is in total deception having the mark of the beast and not even knowing it because theyve they've made God a trinity 95 or 98% of the Christian churches out there believe in the Trinity where God says I am the Lord I am one there's none beside me there's none behind me there's none before me there's none after me I am the Lord thy God I am one when Jesus was on Earth he the word had to become flesh he was made flesh and Phillip looked at him and said Lord show us the Father and Jesus looked at him he said come on Phillip have I not been with you so long if you see me you're looking at the father amen remember remember the scripture the word was made flesh in the beginning was the word by the way you're the word and the Word was with God which means that you were with God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and you are now being made flesh through the manifested word of Jesus Christ operating and moving through your life and manifesting this messag amen that's why this message message will stand as the testimony this message and those that are in the body of Jesus Christ are the ones that are going to be translated in the Rapture and the rest of the world is going to see that that was the the Vindication and the identification of what God was talking about when he was speaking through you to your friends to your family to your loved ones because you didn't do anything to deserve it but if the spirit of God dwells in you it's going to Quicken you yes it's going to translate you you didn't do something to deserve it God came to you listen to this let's go here he for he cometh for he he that cometh to God must believe that he is God not some Trinity not some teaching of man not the Mighty God the almighty God and this teaching and that teaching no Buddha and Muhammad and no no you got to know that he's God and you got to know who God is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him that you you when when God Gave You revelation of who he was and who you were you couldn't wait to feed on the word you can't wait to receive more because it's telling you who you are where you came from where you're going why you were called why you're placed here why this is happening in your life why this is only a circumstance God is going to deliver you from that look at the next scripture Ephesians chapter 2:8 it says here for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is what what you mean faith is a gift that God gives you next slide brother brandham speaking here proving his word he says you can only have faith as God gives you Faith amen Oh Glory Hallelujah praise God that's why Saints you don't have to try and prove anything you you don't need to prove what what you believe because what you believe was given to you to believe amen you didn't work it up you didn't oh I attended a 100 seminars I went to this church 50 times that's why I believe it no you've been brainwashed God gives you Faith it's the gift of God God gives you the gift of faith he says faith is a gift of God even out don't ever how religious you may be yet it must take you must have a revelation and your Revelation can only rest if you're a Christian upon the proven word of God in other words prove this message prove if God didn't send a prophet in this hour you do your own research and find out if God didn't send us a 20th century Prophet you prove yourself you you search the scriptures for in them you think you got eternal life but you need to check for yourself and make make sure that what you believe is what's right and what God wants you to believe listen next he says I'm going to say something look faith is unconscious I can't tell you what happened to me back in 1994 when I went into that little white church and I'm sitting there next to brother Gabriel and I was thinking what in the world am I doing here and this man comes out and he's preaching on the woman at the well and he's talking about her life and her her life of adultery and her life of prostitution and and I'm sitting there and everything just shut out and all of a sudden something is speaking to me like I've never heard it before and something just bang bang banging in my heart I couldn't quite figure it out I I I was not conscious I did not understand you can look back at your own experience you know what God revealed to you you know if this is a reality or not it's an unconscious Faith it's something that you got and you don't even God you don't even you're not even conscious of it sometimes because it just happens in your life you know that healing sometimes just takes place I've experienced it when I came to the Lord for for a good 10 years playing that bass guitar I had pain in this left hip for 10 years straight the pain was so bad sometimes but I would just keep going and I every time that the pastor would speak claim your healing right now you can receive it I claimed it I believed it I said Lord maybe not this week but it's got to come it's got to come lord it's got to come it's got to come and let me tell you I didn't even know when it left it was gone all of a sudden I said I said to my wife I said my God I don't even remember when it left I feel good I got look at me I I'm able to walk I'm able to do I went listen I went to see a chiropractor and he put me into an x-ray and he looked at that X-ray and he says how do you even walk he says your your your your bones in there are like you you need help he says you're going to need to come very regular you're going to need to he says this is going to be an issue going this is this is 10 15 years ago I said the Lord God that made this body can heal this body amen that's all I know that settles it I'm finished I'm I'm I'm convinced of it nobody can can convince me out of it I don't care care what comes into the house cancer comes into the house so what there's no between Cancer and a common cold to God hallelujah you claim you claim God's spirit and his anointing on that situation and you walk and you talk and you believe and you let God do his thing don't worry he knows what he's doing Hallelujah glory to God he says look faith is unconscious amen you believe it I've learned that in the years of travel around the world and meeting peoples all of of all different walks but faith is unconscious you got faith and don't even know it he says that's right Hallelujah next slide he says here if you're using it now now he's talking about the gift now he's talking about how your faith operates it can operate today he's the same God he's still the same God he's still the same yesterday today and forever listen what he says here he says it's it's it's you using it your you're you're if a thought comes into your heart and you just have to think that thought and you've got a situation I don't know what that situation is right now I don't know but you can give thanks for it right now and you can believe God for a Deliverance in that situation right now because the gift operates in that way listen to what he says he says he says it just flows through because it's just a gift to relax yourself take it out of the human gear that God can gear himself with you you with it and say things now your own faith you don't realize that you're doing that yourself your own Faith is doing that your desire your whatever's burning on your heart for your loved ones for your children for your Finance for your health for whatever it is God he wants you to operate that Faith he wants you to believe it with Thanksgiving in your heart that he can do it that he can deliver you that he can set you free from that thing and from today you can walk free you can walk free amen glory to God hallelujah listen to him here super sign 1962 he says now then you sat there and you claim to be a Christian with faith then your own faith goes to the throne of God and touches the high priest and he turns back through a gift and answers right back to show that he's the same God that was that's in me and in you you he's the same God hallelujah glory to God Amen

not just with God but with you here we can have fellowship with you we can we can even on the phone even by text uh or even meeting in a coffee shop uh fellowship with a brother or sister around the world talking about a message talking about what the prophet said talking about what we heard what a blessing that is to know that we can have Fellowship one with the other I also believe that we ought to be very thankful my friends that Jesus is coming again no matter what happens no matter what chaos is out here in the world we we we heard the announcements of of a war breaking out in Israel we know that all this leads to the tribulation period we know that the Gentile period is winding up we know that the sunrise is going back to Israel we know God is going going to be with them in the midst of it all and everything that takes place is taking place for his glory and honor and when we place these things in his hands we know he takes charge of it so let us rest in this wonderful privilege and joy that we have that there is a Rapture coming and we are to be thankful if for nothing else we are thankful to God we don't have to stay in this chaos we don't have to stay in this madness we don't have to stay in all the confusion but there is a Rapture out of here and we're going out of here we're not going to remain here but we're going right out of here so let us maintain
