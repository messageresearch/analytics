[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] good evening everyone
[0:17] i'm here tonight by the grace of god
[0:21] and by his wonderful love that he has
[0:24] shown for us
[0:26] with a message
[0:28] called
[0:29] message to leo this year
[0:32] may the holy spirit bless us together
[0:35] as we delve into the word of god for
[0:40] this hour
[0:41] amen
[0:42] let us read out of the book of
[0:44] revelation
[0:46] chapter 3 verses 15
[0:49] and 16.
[0:52] i know thy works
[0:55] that thou art neither cold nor hot
[0:59] i would the word cold or hot
[1:03] so then
[1:05] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[1:09] cold nor hot
[1:11] i will spew thee out of my mouth
[1:15] praise god that is the message of this
[1:18] word today
[1:19] gracious father
[1:21] we have read out of the holy bible thy
[1:25] book
[1:26] may the holy spirit
[1:29] draw near
[1:31] oh god
[1:33] hover
[1:34] above us around us
[1:37] move through us declare thyself in this
[1:41] hour
[1:42] and may you the great holy spirit be
[1:45] magnified
[1:47] and recognize lord
[1:49] in the going forth of the word of god
[1:53] we rest our faith in him in you lord
[1:57] we rest our everything in you
[2:00] and we come in the middle of the week
[2:02] father
[2:03] for refreshing to our hearts our lives
[2:07] and our walk in jesus christ
[2:10] to thee be the glory amen
[2:18] the message to lord this year is this
[2:22] nothing good
[2:25] has been spoken by the holy spirit
[2:29] in the word of god
[2:31] concerning
[2:33] this age
[2:34] of leodisia
[2:37] matter of fact
[2:40] we see god bringing two indictments
[2:44] and one pronouncement
[2:46] against this age
[2:48] of laodicea
[2:50] listen
[2:52] i know thy works
[2:55] thou art neither cold nor hot
[3:00] i would that thou art cold or hot
[3:05] so then
[3:07] because the word look warm
[3:10] and neither cold nor hot
[3:13] i will spew thee
[3:15] out of my mouth
[3:19] god's word tells us plainly
[3:23] the legion church age
[3:26] is a lukewarm church age
[3:29] that is neither cold nor hot
[3:33] and this lukewarmness
[3:36] god is saying
[3:38] demands
[3:40] ledicia
[3:42] to pay a penalty
[3:45] for this wrong
[3:48] this evil that she has done
[3:52] certainly refrained
[3:54] the penalty
[3:56] god pronounces
[3:58] is that i will spit you i'll spew you
[4:01] out of my mouth
[4:05] many think because god says i'll spew
[4:07] thee out of my mouth
[4:09] they tried to apply that scripture
[4:12] to an individual
[4:15] but this scripture does not apply
[4:18] to an individual person
[4:21] uh to get the feeling that god never
[4:24] wants you
[4:25] god will never take you back god will
[4:28] never forgive you
[4:30] god will never cleanse you if you
[4:32] backslide you can't be restored no
[4:36] it doesn't say that when god says i will
[4:39] spew thee out of my mouth he is really
[4:43] speaking to the church
[4:45] as a whole
[4:48] that because the church
[4:50] has been lukewarm
[4:53] because the church has not paid
[4:56] attention to his word
[4:58] he s pronounces his judgment
[5:01] i will spew thee out of my
[5:06] mouth so here he is
[5:09] and we know according to
[5:11] the bible
[5:13] that
[5:14] we are nowhere like in the mouth of god
[5:18] certainly we know in god's mouth is his
[5:22] word and there my friends
[5:26] we as individual
[5:29] parts of him
[5:32] we are considered by the word
[5:35] amen
[5:36] that we are in the palms of his hands
[5:40] the bible tells us clearly
[5:42] i've got you in the palms of my hands
[5:45] and father i've not lost one that you
[5:48] have placed in my hand thank god for
[5:51] this eternal
[5:52] blessed assurance and security that we
[5:56] have in the lord jesus christ aren't you
[5:58] happy that you have this kind of blessed
[6:01] assurance in jesus christ amen
[6:05] the scriptures say also
[6:08] we are under the shelter of his wings
[6:12] oh the great eagle
[6:14] has spread the old and the new testament
[6:18] the great eagle has revealed or opened
[6:21] up the word
[6:23] and the word is spread above us
[6:26] protecting us guiding us guarding us and
[6:29] we are under the shadow of his wings oh
[6:33] thanks be to god who gave us the
[6:36] revelation of jesus christ hallelujah
[6:40] that we are under the his glorious
[6:43] marvelous wings of protection the bible
[6:47] again says we are in the bosom of god a
[6:52] man like a mother will hug her child
[6:56] close to herself like a father will put
[7:00] his arm over his boy's shoulder as they
[7:03] walk towards the creek to do
[7:06] some fishing or to talk uh just to be
[7:10] together god is saying
[7:13] oh i have you in my bosom i i have you
[7:18] close to my heart i i love you i care
[7:21] for you i am watching over you praise
[7:25] god hallelujah the bible further tells
[7:28] us
[7:29] that we are his sheep and we are in his
[7:32] sheepfold
[7:35] i'm so glad
[7:36] i'm in the sheepfold of the lord
[7:40] safe from all harm
[7:42] safe from the wild beasts
[7:45] safe from the the the walls that are out
[7:49] there
[7:50] safe in the tender care of this gentle
[7:54] shepherd i am so glad that the great
[7:58] shepherd stands across the doorway
[8:02] protecting his own and he says fear not
[8:06] you are in my sheepfold hallelujah he
[8:10] will protect us through this dark night
[8:14] that we are passing through
[8:16] but all my friends
[8:18] oh i tell you
[8:20] the night
[8:21] uh i tell you friends that that joy is
[8:24] coming in the morning weeping man door
[8:27] for the night
[8:28] troubles trials all kinds of lack and
[8:31] all kinds of
[8:33] ups and downs may come but weeping will
[8:37] only endure for the night
[8:40] but joy is coming in the morning oh
[8:44] hallelujah thanks be to god amen the
[8:48] bible tells us
[8:50] also
[8:52] we are in his mind
[8:56] for long before time began
[9:01] we were in his mind and we were a part
[9:04] of his plan
[9:06] oh praise god let no man let no person
[9:11] deny this or think otherwise
[9:14] but that we were in his eternal purpose
[9:17] and plans
[9:19] before time even began
[9:22] oh and we are the expression of what was
[9:25] in his heart and in his mind the bible
[9:29] tells us further we are in his posture
[9:33] he has placed us in a position where we
[9:36] can feed upon him the word safely
[9:40] and protected for we are not in some
[9:44] stranger's pasture we are not in some
[9:48] outsider pasture we are in his pasture
[9:53] and he watches over his own he watches
[9:57] over his sheep aren't you glad you're in
[10:00] the master's pasture in his sheepfold in
[10:05] his bosom in his mind oh thank god
[10:09] forevermore we are secure in christ
[10:13] hallelujah amen matthew 4 tells us
[10:18] clearly men shall not live by bread
[10:21] alone
[10:22] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[10:26] the mouth of god so
[10:29] the word is supposed to be in our mouth
[10:35] aren't you glad
[10:37] that the word is supposed to be in our
[10:40] mouth oh praise god hallelujah now we
[10:45] know that the church is his body glory
[10:48] to god and
[10:50] what will then be in the mouth of that
[10:53] body nothing less than the word itself
[10:58] amen hallelujah first peter
[11:01] chapter 4
[11:03] verse
[11:04] 11
[11:05] if any man speak
[11:08] let him speak
[11:10] as the oracles or word of god
[11:15] ii peter
[11:17] chapter 1
[11:18] verse 21
[11:20] for prophecy came not in old time by the
[11:25] will of man
[11:27] but holy men of god spay
[11:32] as they were
[11:33] moved
[11:35] by the holy ghost hallelujah oh praise
[11:39] god so we can see in that light
[11:43] what's wrong with laodicea
[11:46] what's wrong with the laodicean church
[11:49] age
[11:50] what is wrong with the people today
[11:54] what is wrong with the church today
[11:57] the church has moved away from the word
[12:00] of god
[12:02] and she is speaking her own word
[12:06] she's not saying what her husband tells
[12:08] her to say or advises her to say
[12:12] but she is making up her own series
[12:15] theologizing analyzing debating and uh
[12:19] bringing all kinds of ideas of what she
[12:22] thinks
[12:24] from the word of god amen just gotten
[12:28] away from the word
[12:30] and they're no longer
[12:32] passionate about it but praise god the
[12:36] true seed of god is passionate fervent
[12:39] and on fire with the word of god
[12:41] hallelujah amen the baptist have their
[12:45] creeds in their darkness
[12:48] the methodists
[12:50] are have their creeds and their dogmas
[12:54] no water baptism
[12:56] only sprinkling sprinkling is good
[13:00] when the very bible tells us
[13:03] that when john baptized jesus our
[13:06] example
[13:07] he went down into the water
[13:10] and after john had baptized him in the
[13:13] water the bible says he came up out of
[13:17] the water oh praise god hallelujah
[13:20] may every one of us have the true
[13:23] baptism in water in the name of jesus
[13:26] christ according to the word of god
[13:28] the pentecostals also claim they have
[13:31] the word of god
[13:34] but give them the word test and see
[13:36] where they're really going to stand with
[13:37] that
[13:39] they'll sell you out in a minute
[13:42] they'll sell you out in seconds
[13:45] they'll sell you out for sensations
[13:49] rather than to hear the word of god
[13:52] being unveiled to their ears
[13:56] they prefer to have a sensation
[13:59] they enjoy having manifestations
[14:03] they enjoy having tongues
[14:06] they enjoy having signs and wonders
[14:09] oh
[14:10] they'll rejoice over that
[14:13] my friends i'm telling you what are we
[14:17] here the word of god has been
[14:20] effectively placed aside and not given
[14:24] the place of not only not prominence but
[14:28] preeminence over the church over the
[14:31] lives of the individuals that god may be
[14:35] glorified and the spirit of god might be
[14:38] lifted up and jesus might be seen this
[14:42] mighty one hallelujah
[14:44] and so they have sold out and put aside
[14:47] the word of god so god is saying you've
[14:50] put me aside i'll put you aside i i'll
[14:53] spew you out of my mouth i'll i'll
[14:56] separate i'll pull back my presence i'll
[14:59] take back my spirit from you and leave
[15:02] you in your delusions your fictions your
[15:05] fantasies and your cl that you're taking
[15:08] up with the charms of of this slick
[15:12] devil and you're caught up in his the
[15:15] coils of his lies oh my friends search
[15:18] yourself search your heart may the
[15:22] church of god in this last day receive
[15:25] the message to leodysia and turn back
[15:28] from once you are going and may the holy
[15:31] spirit of god appeal to the deep which
[15:34] crawls to the deep and the deep in you
[15:37] may respond back to the word of the
[15:40] living god hallelujah for seven
[15:45] of the seven church ages
[15:48] man has been found
[15:52] putting their word above the word of god
[15:56] we have one bible
[15:59] but they have written
[16:00] thousands and thousands of thousands of
[16:04] volumes
[16:06] yes sir thousands of them claiming that
[16:10] they are all the word of god
[16:14] when we know there is only one word of
[16:17] god
[16:19] amen hero israel
[16:21] the lord thy god is one lord amen
[16:27] yes
[16:28] but with all that he is still in the
[16:30] midst of his church
[16:32] calling and crying out
[16:35] to those that will
[16:37] hear his voice
[16:38] all praise the lord jesus christ
[16:42] hallelujah god promised in this last day
[16:46] this seventh church age
[16:49] this dark lodesian
[16:52] night filled with stifling darkness
[16:56] god promised
[16:57] that he would reveal himself
[17:00] by untrue
[17:01] a prophet
[17:03] of this last day
[17:04] oh praise god hallelujah
[17:07] oh revelation 10 7 says
[17:11] but in the days of the voice
[17:15] of the seventh messenger
[17:18] when he shall begin to sound
[17:21] the mystery
[17:23] of god
[17:25] the puzzles the hard sayings
[17:28] the
[17:29] things that were misunderstood
[17:31] the clouds of darkness that were above
[17:34] the earth now above the word
[17:36] the sun rising of the sun will drive
[17:40] away the gloom will move back the
[17:42] darkness so that your eyes can behold
[17:46] the wonders of our king and the glory
[17:50] of our god hallelujah i want to thank
[17:54] god
[17:55] that after thousands of years god
[17:59] is and has
[18:01] vindicated himself
[18:04] by the sending of a 20th century prophet
[18:09] like the world has never seen
[18:12] before
[18:15] sent a man
[18:17] whom i believed to be william marian
[18:20] branham
[18:22] that preached the word of god
[18:24] without fear or favor
[18:27] one man
[18:30] like moses was against all egypt
[18:33] one man
[18:35] standing against all
[18:37] organizational
[18:39] systems
[18:41] all manner of
[18:43] religious
[18:44] so-called intellectuals
[18:47] yes sir
[18:48] or praise god and a world of religion
[18:52] just as they did to john the baptist of
[18:55] old elijah of old they have done the
[18:59] same thing to him
[19:01] all blackened his name
[19:03] they
[19:04] this tried to destroy his reputation
[19:09] try to mess with his message
[19:11] but you can't do it
[19:13] because it wasn't his message it is his
[19:17] message
[19:18] he may be gone
[19:19] but his message lives on
[19:21] that is spirit of his message has been
[19:24] transferred
[19:26] let the spirit of god transferred from
[19:28] jesus to the apostles that same spirit
[19:32] has transferred in this last day into a
[19:35] people of god for this age that there
[19:38] might be his vindication that he might
[19:41] be the one to be his reflection
[19:44] and that there may be
[19:46] evening lights shining like shining
[19:48] stars of the evening or praise god as a
[19:53] testimony that they are only parts of
[19:56] the word but they are here to reflect
[19:59] the glory of the risen christ amen
[20:02] hallelujah yes my brother i thank god
[20:07] that he sent a message hallelujah and he
[20:10] sent it by a god sent god vindicated
[20:15] prophet who was and
[20:18] you it was god's mouth peace amen and
[20:22] god used him hallelujah to be his mouth
[20:26] peace as declared by malachi 4 5 and 6.
[20:32] how he would turn
[20:34] the hearts
[20:36] of the children back to the fathers
[20:39] hallelujah he will bring back the elect
[20:43] bring back the elect
[20:45] of the last day amen and they
[20:50] no matter what others say
[20:52] they will listen
[20:54] and they will hear
[20:56] the voice
[20:57] of that vindicated prophet
[21:00] right many times brother branham said
[21:03] you heard me speak but that wasn't me
[21:06] that wasn't my voice that was him and it
[21:09] was he was exactly right for now that
[21:13] voice is testifying
[21:16] for himself
[21:18] for the glory of his word and of his
[21:21] person
[21:22] oh praise god that vindicated prophet
[21:27] prophesied and ordained by god
[21:30] to bring the elected back to the world
[21:34] and to set them in a position that they
[21:37] would have the the fullness of what paul
[21:41] had what the apostles had that would
[21:44] come to them again and repeat itself in
[21:49] its brilliance to them unsullied
[21:54] untarnished
[21:56] by the
[21:57] theological filth
[21:59] and the rotten uh ideas of man
[22:04] that has tried to infect and infiltrate
[22:07] the word of god but god said i will spew
[22:12] thee out of my mouth amen thank god you
[22:16] spewed all those things out of my mind i
[22:18] trust you spewed it all out of your mind
[22:20] out of your heart out of your life and
[22:23] that you can say actually i can see
[22:25] clearly now because the clouds the rain
[22:28] and the smoke is all gone and i can see
[22:31] jesus high and lifted up amen
[22:34] let us momentarily
[22:38] consider church history
[22:40] for god has manifested himself through
[22:43] his body
[22:45] so that his body could be his voice
[22:48] and could perform his will
[22:51] and fulfill his divine purpose
[22:55] thanks be to god hallelujah
[22:57] my friends
[22:59] consider
[23:00] how true the dark ages
[23:04] the word
[23:06] was almost lost
[23:09] during that period of time
[23:13] but god had already promised
[23:17] that he would send a prophet
[23:19] that would restore the word
[23:22] and so
[23:24] the holy spirit
[23:26] came to luta
[23:29] one of the most dedicated
[23:32] consecrated priests
[23:35] in the catholic church
[23:37] and raise him up
[23:39] as a
[23:40] a seed bed as a sprout
[23:43] of the word of god
[23:45] coming to life
[23:47] and breaking through
[23:49] the dirt
[23:50] that was all around him
[23:52] he broke through the dirt
[23:55] amen
[23:56] and lived what a life what a message
[23:59] what a gospel that just shall live by
[24:03] faith
[24:04] amen not indulgences
[24:07] not
[24:08] all manner of stations on the cross not
[24:11] by the burning of candles not by such uh
[24:14] traditions of man but just shall live by
[24:18] faith amen
[24:20] and after he did his work and spoke that
[24:24] part of the word then god sent luther
[24:28] who also was used of god
[24:31] to speak his part of the word not only
[24:34] are we to be saved but we must live a
[24:37] clean sanctified life so he preached
[24:40] holiness unto the lord without which no
[24:44] man woman child shall see the lord all
[24:49] certainly and god used him for a season
[24:52] and he was the word of god for his
[24:56] day and for his generation hallelujah
[25:00] and the people that took that revelation
[25:03] from him
[25:05] became the living epistles
[25:08] to be read
[25:10] and known of all men
[25:12] in their time
[25:14] and when those methodists failed in
[25:18] their duty
[25:19] and began to die spiritually
[25:23] my friends just look around the national
[25:26] the deen denominational landscape
[25:29] you will see
[25:31] the tombs the cemeteries the wreckage
[25:34] the the the empty
[25:37] buildings the torn down buildings
[25:39] buildings turned into bingo halls bar
[25:43] rooms gambling houses houses of
[25:46] prostitution
[25:47] because they hid not the voice of god
[25:51] but let me tell you god had and hands a
[25:56] message to judicial not from the mouth
[25:59] of the prophet back there but from the
[26:01] mouth of his bride in this hour and in
[26:04] this day in which we are living in oh
[26:07] thanks be to god so
[26:10] the nominal church
[26:13] is no longer
[26:15] the mouthpiece of god
[26:18] it has become its own mouthpiece
[26:22] each denomination speaking for itself
[26:26] and believing
[26:28] they
[26:29] have
[26:30] a great
[26:32] hand
[26:33] cough or they have a great hold
[26:36] of the truth of god's word
[26:39] but god has turned away from her
[26:42] and he is turning on her now
[26:45] amen and as he will confound her
[26:49] through the sermons through the messages
[26:52] through the truths that comes out to the
[26:54] mouth of his prophet contrary to what
[26:57] they were taking are believing it
[26:59] confounds them
[27:00] he will conf further confound them
[27:03] through the voice of his bride his voice
[27:06] coming through his bride
[27:08] will confound them

[29:30] more electronic
[29:32] means of distributing the gospel
[29:35] you have millions more
[29:37] of bibles everywhere
[29:40] but the real word you don't have
[29:44] you're missing that
[29:46] oh my brothers and my sisters
[29:49] all you're interested in
[29:52] is
[29:53] passing the word dividing the word
[29:56] debating the word having conferences
[29:59] about analyzing parts of the word and
[30:02] discussing these things instead of
[30:06] getting to know him the word or let him
[30:11] the word reveal or make known himself to
[30:15] you praise god forevermore oh they don't
[30:19] want it
[30:20] you're not interesting in that
[30:23] they don't they're not interesting and
[30:25] living the word
[30:26] but they will debate the word
[30:30] oh my
[30:32] god is saying yes
[30:34] you claim you love the word you love the
[30:37] bible you love jesus
[30:39] but
[30:40] you're neither cold
[30:43] nor hot
[30:45] you know it's the truth
[30:47] but you won't go out there and live it
[30:51] if you lived it god is saying i would
[30:54] praise you for that
[30:57] but when you simply take the word of the
[30:59] living god and you don't honor it you
[31:02] don't give it preeminence
[31:05] amen you don't
[31:07] give me glory and honor then that
[31:11] nauseates me that kind of worship
[31:15] nauseates him for you know not
[31:18] what or who you worship
[31:20] amen you're worshiping without our
[31:23] understanding
[31:25] without a revelation how can you worship
[31:30] like that blindly thinking that you can
[31:33] see when you cannot see and you do not
[31:35] know luke warm water is the worst thing
[31:39] that one can take hold of
[31:41] and try to drink it will just make you
[31:45] sick
[31:46] to the stomach amen and god has declared
[31:50] because you are neither
[31:54] cold
[31:55] nor hot
[31:57] i will spew you out of my mouth do you
[32:01] hear that nominal church
[32:03] do you hear that nominal church member
[32:07] do you hear that you who think oh i'm a
[32:10] good man i'm a good woman i'm a good
[32:12] person i did this i gave charity i do
[32:16] god said i'll spew you out of my mouth
[32:20] amen that tells me
[32:23] what how god must have felt
[32:26] just before noah's floods
[32:30] how he must have felt
[32:32] just before lot had to run for the
[32:35] mountains
[32:37] oh my friends back to the word
[32:40] oh god wants a church
[32:43] hear this message to lodesia god wants a
[32:46] church
[32:47] that is hot
[32:49] passionate about his word loves him
[32:53] not for his gifts
[32:55] not for his manifestations
[32:57] not for his pearls or his diamonds that
[33:00] he can give you but if god wants you to
[33:02] love him for himself amen and so
[33:07] he has passed sentence upon her
[33:10] she is no longer my mouthpiece to the
[33:14] world
[33:15] she will continue to maintain that she
[33:17] is
[33:18] but she is not
[33:21] for he has been spewed
[33:23] out of his mouth
[33:26] but thank god
[33:28] he still has a voice on the earth
[33:31] and among his people
[33:33] in this world
[33:35] what the bible tells us he has given his
[33:37] voice
[33:40] to his bride
[33:42] for the voice is in the bride
[33:46] even as we
[33:48] have been told according to the word of
[33:50] god
[33:51] hallelujah
[33:53] and friends
[33:54] as these
[33:56] wonderful
[33:57] lessons

[34:06] voice of god
[34:08] that is now speaking in and through the
[34:11] bride
[34:12] for his glory
[34:14] and for his honor god bless us all
[34:17] tonight
[34:19] and may this massive lodesia
[34:22] rest upon our hearts
[34:25] may we meditate upon these things
[34:28] and may god's power to transform
[34:31] work within the inward parts of our
[34:34] being and change us from glory onto
[34:37] glory so that we will meet again
[34:41] in the presence of his eternal glory god
