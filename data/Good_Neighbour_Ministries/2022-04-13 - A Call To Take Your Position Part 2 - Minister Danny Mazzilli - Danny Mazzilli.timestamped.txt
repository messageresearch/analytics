[17:46] speaker and hear father in jesus name
[17:49] amen
[17:51] praise god
[17:52] uh
[17:54] we're going to continue our thought on
[17:55] sunday was that um
[17:57] that god
[18:00] has called us
[18:01] and is calling us to our position amen
[18:04] it's important to understand
[18:06] that you know if he's calling you if
[18:08] he's called your name if you've if
[18:10] you've recognized the word for this day
[18:13] and for this hours because god placed
[18:15] within you an attribute of himself a
[18:19] part of himself
[18:20] there's no way that you would have been
[18:22] able to
[18:23] recognize this
[18:25] this miraculous word that we are feeding
[18:28] on it's different from everything else
[18:31] that we hear out there christianity uh
[18:34] you know that we've known
[18:36] many of us understand that um it's like
[18:38] it's like a different language
[18:40] altogether and why is that because god
[18:43] speaks by revelation
[18:45] he reveals his mind and his thoughts
[18:48] directly divinely to each and every
[18:51] attribute of god amen praise god let's
[18:54] read um so this this um particular slide
[18:58] is talking about how you
[19:00] are foreknown amen
[19:02] god knew you before
[19:04] we came here before he did anything he
[19:07] already knew exactly
[19:10] who each and every one of us were
[19:12] that we had a certain name that that
[19:15] that he said my sheep will hear my voice
[19:18] and they will recognize they will be
[19:20] given um
[19:21] special ears to hear
[19:24] amen special eyes to see amen praise god
[19:28] he says here for whom he did for no
[19:31] he also did predestinate
[19:34] to be conformed to the image of his son
[19:38] that he might be the firstborn among
[19:41] many brethren
[19:42] moreover
[19:44] whom he did predestinate
[19:46] them he also called
[19:49] he's called you and whom he called
[19:54] them he also justified and whom he
[19:56] justified them he also glorified
[20:01] may the lord add his blessings tonight
[20:03] you may be seated
[20:05] what a wonderful scripture
[20:07] you know he foreknew you
[20:09] not only did he foreknew you for know
[20:12] you he actually
[20:14] predestinated you because he knew
[20:17] that when the word was going to come to
[20:19] you you would say amen to the word
[20:22] you would have that
[20:23] special ability to recognize
[20:26] that
[20:26] he was speaking to you in your day in
[20:29] the time the dispensation here we are in
[20:32] the 21st century
[20:34] the word has been progressing all the
[20:36] way along you see god was
[20:39] god from the beginning when adam and eve
[20:42] fell in the garden of eden there was a
[20:45] curse that came upon the earth what did
[20:47] that curse do
[20:49] separate us from god amen then god all
[20:52] down through the old testament through
[20:55] each and every
[20:56] patriarch from abraham all the way down
[21:00] to malachi all the patriarchs in between
[21:03] what was he doing he was revealing
[21:05] himself in tight form the word being
[21:09] expressed always in tight form he was
[21:13] god he was he was god of the old the
[21:16] lord of the old testament jehovah of the
[21:18] old testament is jesus of the new
[21:20] testament it's the same person
[21:23] it's always been jesus christ it's
[21:26] always been the lord one god not three
[21:29] in the offices there are three in one
[21:32] you know father son and holy ghost
[21:34] that's all that's all confusion that's
[21:37] paganism
[21:38] amen
[21:40] when when you've come to a revelation of
[21:42] who god is you'll realize that there's
[21:43] only one god
[21:45] and it's been the same god right from
[21:47] the very beginning and he's expressing
[21:50] himself amen praise god and all down
[21:53] through those you know prophets coming
[21:56] down it was always
[21:57] christ in them showing vindicating
[22:00] joseph showing
[22:02] in type form all the way down every
[22:05] single time it was god
[22:07] in human flesh
[22:09] through prophets revealing himself in
[22:11] son of man ministries now we come into
[22:15] his ministry where he comes to the earth
[22:18] where he is he now expresses himself not
[22:21] as son of god but as son of man
[22:24] amen because
[22:26] son of man is where god himself
[22:29] comes into mortal flesh takes on human
[22:32] flesh
[22:33] and becomes flesh the word was made
[22:36] flesh and dwelt among us so he was
[22:39] expressing himself now in a human form
[22:42] then he gave up the ghost right he gave
[22:45] up himself at calvary and then he sent
[22:48] back the holy spirit then the holy
[22:50] spirit comes down then he's he's
[22:52] speaking to all the churches revealing
[22:55] himself there he was back in in the
[22:57] office of son of god
[22:59] not in son of man it wasn't until
[23:02] brother branham came on the scene that
[23:04] he became son of man again now it was
[23:07] god in human flesh again amen god
[23:11] showing that he was going to come back
[23:13] and restore all things
[23:15] why because everything that took place
[23:17] back in the garden of eden had to be
[23:20] restored into the fullness right at the
[23:23] end it's where adam and eve
[23:26] get fully re restored the first adam
[23:28] fell the second adam
[23:30] spirit
[23:32] of resurrection comes back
[23:34] restores everything now here we are
[23:37] being restored eve being back placed
[23:40] positionally back into our position but
[23:43] here he is he's still here in son of man
[23:47] ministry where in you and me
[23:51] you see this is all part of god's great
[23:55] plan of redemption amen but
[23:58] it's so important for us to recognize
[24:00] that because when you can see that you
[24:03] can see your
[24:05] your position
[24:06] your placing in the word how important
[24:09] it is for you now to recognize your part
[24:13] because you're saying well he's calling
[24:14] me to to a position what position what
[24:18] is it that i'm supposed to do
[24:20] you are
[24:22] christ now being revealed you are eve
[24:26] the female part of jesus christ now
[24:30] being revealed in human flesh
[24:33] amen praise god you've got a ministry
[24:37] this is our ministry that's why you know
[24:39] like if if you did receive brother
[24:42] branham because he was the first fruits
[24:44] of that ministry so brother branham had
[24:47] to come and reveal he he he he was he
[24:50] was expressing everything that that
[24:52] abraham did you know as it was in the
[24:55] days of sodom so shall it be when the
[24:57] son of man luke 17 30 is being revealed
[25:02] right you know doing all the things that
[25:05] abraham that god did with abraham now
[25:08] god is doing it with you and me amen
[25:10] praise god abraham and his wife christ
[25:14] and his bride it's all type forms
[25:17] everything all the way down through it

[34:55] his blood we shall be saved
[34:57] from wrath through him
[35:01] everything is through christ everything
[35:03] is through the word

[35:50] we're not preaching a big message and
[35:53] you know we're trying to you know preach
[35:54] the mysteries of god and everything else
[35:56] these are things that we need to be
[35:58] reminded of
[36:00] because god has called us to a position
[36:02] so we need to have confidence
[36:04] in that position amen and the only way
[36:07] you're going to have confidence is if
[36:08] you take the word and you believe the
[36:10] word you accept the word
[36:13] you apply the word amen praise god
[36:15] colossians 1 20-23 and having made peace
[36:20] through the blood of his cross
[36:22] by him to reconcile all things unto
[36:25] himself
[36:26] and you that were sometimes alienated
[36:29] and enemies in your mind by wicked works
[36:32] yet now hath he reconciled in the body
[36:36] of his flesh through death
[36:38] to present you holy
[36:41] unblameable
[36:43] unreprovable
[36:44] in his sight
[36:46] how can that possibly be
[36:50] how can that possibly be
[36:53] born in sin shaped an iniquity speaking
[36:56] lies
[36:57] you know but here now he's made a way
[37:00] that
[37:01] that that he's going to present us
[37:02] completely
[37:04] washed
[37:05] through the blood
[37:07] amen hallelujah if you continue in the
[37:10] faith
[37:11] grounded and settled and be not moved
[37:14] away from the hope of the gospel which
[37:16] you have heard
[37:18] you see you know like you can you can
[37:19] get away from the word you can move away
[37:22] from the word
[37:23] you can you can get lazy
[37:26] you can get lazy because the word is not
[37:28] going to stop moving on
[37:31] the word will continue to progress it'll
[37:34] it's not going to it's not gonna wait
[37:36] for anything
[37:37] the word will progress and as you
[37:40] receive the word you apply the word you
[37:42] you you
[37:44] come into the you you come into the the
[37:47] season of the word
[37:49] because the word is is progressing
[37:51] and so it's important that you're
[37:53] catching the revelation of christ in the
[37:56] day that you're living in
[37:58] that's why this message now with christ
[38:01] in the five-fold ministry remember he's
[38:04] he's under the son of man ministry now
[38:06] in human flesh
[38:08] he came down
[38:09] 1963 the whole body was being built up
[38:13] all through the seven church ages
[38:16] but then when the seven church ages came
[38:18] to an end
[38:20] which they did
[38:21] they came to an end
[38:23] under the son of god ministry because
[38:25] god was dealing with the churches and
[38:28] what were they doing they were putting
[38:29] them out of the church what happened in
[38:31] the laodicean church age he's outside of
[38:34] the church knocking
[38:36] why because they put them out because of
[38:38] their doctrines because of their own
[38:40] teachings you know just go back and read
[38:43] the seven church ages that was god
[38:45] dealing with the church
[38:47] amen but now he's dealing with you and
[38:51] me as individuals
[38:54] he's come to call us individually now
[38:57] personally because in 1963 when the head
[39:00] came down
[39:02] you know the cloud in the shape of the
[39:03] head that that was not just a
[39:05] coincidence that was christ now because
[39:08] when the body is fully built up
[39:11] everything was being built up
[39:14] the eyes you can go back and you can see
[39:16] all kinds of quotes where brother brahms
[39:17] was talking about the legs the arms the
[39:20] mouth was the time you know where they
[39:22] were
[39:22] where it was all the preaching going on
[39:24] and and then the eyes the scene age you
[39:27] know the prophet comes on the scene now
[39:29] and what happens what's next the
[39:31] intelligence the head
[39:33] the thoughts
[39:35] what are the thoughts the thoughts of
[39:37] god what are the thoughts of god why did
[39:40] he have to come down in 1963 now the
[39:43] intelligence coming down to the body
[39:45] that's already been built and finished
[39:47] now it needs intelligence
[39:50] what is the intelligence
[39:52] the thoughts what are the thoughts
[39:54] the attributes who are the attributes
[39:57] you and me
[39:58] hallelujah
[40:00] god calling you by your name because you
[40:04] are one of his thoughts you are one of
[40:06] his attributes because the body's got to
[40:08] be complete eve's got to be fully
[40:11] restored she's got to be put back into a
[40:14] condition where she will not fall
[40:18] hallelujah this is the bride age this is
[40:21] the age where the bride takes her
[40:24] position she she moves into her position
[40:27] she's going to get tested she's going to
[40:29] get tried she's going to be tested by
[40:31] that same devil
[40:33] hallelujah
[40:35] but this time
[40:37] she doesn't fall
[40:41] hallelujah
[40:43] she can't fall why because the
[40:45] intelligence has now come and taken
[40:48] possession of her
[40:50] he says take the book revelations 10
[40:54] 8-11 he says take the book eat the book
[40:57] feed on the book hallelujah because
[41:00] you've got another ministry you've got
[41:02] something that's got to be fulfilled now
[41:04] this bride has a ministry she must
[41:07] prophesy again
[41:10] what is what do you mean prophesy again
[41:12] what just repeat everything that's
[41:13] already been said no
[41:16] there are sons and daughters of god that
[41:19] need to be called into their position
[41:22] and the holy spirit now needs a body
[41:26] on earth in human flesh to speak and to
[41:29] call
[41:30] every son and daughter of god into their
[41:33] position
[41:34] that's why we've heard him call our name
[41:36] but why is he calling our name to place
[41:39] us
[41:40] to position us
[41:42] so that he can take this body to the
[41:44] next stage which is what
[41:46] the rapture
[41:48] let me have a drink
[41:54] hallelujah
[41:56] what a word
[41:58] what a time what a season
[42:00] glory to god listen to brother branham
[42:02] here
[42:05] next slide
[42:13] okay actually 23 yeah you're right we
[42:15] are more than conquerors
[42:17] amen
[42:19] praise god
[42:20] more than conquers romans 8 37 nay in
[42:23] all faith all these things we are
[42:26] more
[42:27] uh more than conquerors through him that
[42:29] loved us
[42:31] for i am persuaded that neither death
[42:33] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[42:36] nor powers nor things present nor things
[42:40] to come
[42:42] nor height nor depth nor any other
[42:45] creature shall be able to separate us
[42:48] from the love of god which is in christ
[42:50] jesus our lord there is nothing that can
[42:53] separate an attribute of god because it
[42:57] is god
[42:58] you need to recognize i'm not saying oh
[43:01] you are god you are god i'm not saying
[43:03] that
[43:04] you are attributes of god you are
[43:06] portions of god you are the thoughts of
[43:09] god but you're now being expressed and
[43:12] manifested here on this earth
[43:15] and you're doing that for a purpose god
[43:18] has a purpose in doing that listen to
[43:20] brother branham
[43:22] uh next slide the church has god's power
[43:25] the church has god's word
[43:28] that's what we have
[43:30] it's not that you've got power because
[43:32] you know god sent a prophet
[43:35] there's a lot of people talking about
[43:37] god sent a prophet god sent a prophet
[43:39] all they want to do is give tracts don't
[43:41] you know god sent a prophet if you don't
[43:43] believe that god sent a prophet you're
[43:44] not going to be
[43:45] you're not going to go to heaven
[43:48] no sir
[43:50] that's not going to be
[43:51] that's not the message of the hour
[43:55] god sent a prophet for a purpose
[43:58] you need to know what that purpose is
[44:01] you need to know that it was to restore
[44:02] the word to restore all things remember
[44:05] the curse
[44:06] in the in the beginning of the garden
[44:08] separated us from god the restoration of
[44:11] the word
[44:13] reunites us back with the word
[44:16] amen and so you need to recognize why
[44:19] god sent a prophet
[44:21] you need to know what his ministry was
[44:23] and that without that ministry we
[44:26] couldn't have this one
[44:29] it's as simple as that a lot of people
[44:30] oh you follow a man you follow a man
[44:33] well what do you what what did
[44:35] when moses took the children of israel
[44:37] out of egypt
[44:39] what was it
[44:40] what was it was it a man that they were
[44:42] following
[44:45] or was it a god sent prophet with thus
[44:48] saith the lord
[44:51] to give them the word to recognize what
[44:54] it was that god was going to do in that
[44:56] day
[44:57] had they not listened to moses that had
[44:59] never gone through the red sea
[45:02] those that disbelieved what happened to
[45:04] them
[45:05] they perished
[45:08] it's that simple
[45:10] god's always operated in that way but
[45:12] you need to understand
[45:15] how god is operating and what god has
[45:17] done recognize the dispensations and the
[45:20] times and the seasons for the word of
[45:22] god
[45:23] and without brother branham coming to
[45:25] restore the word to be that first wave
[45:29] chief of the son of man ministry
[45:32] stood before people discerning their
[45:35] hearts and their lives and their
[45:36] conditions just like abraham when he was
[45:38] with with uh with sarah and and
[45:41] melchizedek came and visited with him
[45:44] and was telling him all about what was
[45:46] what was going to come what was going to
[45:47] happen
[45:49] and discerned everything and showed
[45:51] exactly what he was going to do in the
[45:54] last days because it was as it was in
[45:56] the days of sodom he was going to do it
[45:58] all over again
[46:00] but it was for a purpose to restore
[46:03] eve to restore the church amen praise
[46:06] god so brother braham says well i'm
[46:09] afraid that the church doesn't know
[46:11] their authority
[46:13] amen i'm afraid that
[46:15] that holy ghost born men doesn't realize
[46:18] their authority that god has permitted
[46:21] to his church
[46:23] amen praise god we need to recognize our
[46:26] position and the authority that god has
[46:29] given to us as sons and daughters of god

[51:09] that's the first thing that happens when
[51:10] somebody receives a call from god you
[51:13] know like sometimes you hear that altar
[51:15] call and people come to the altar you
[51:17] know that's that's great it's wonderful
[51:20] it's how everything starts but what
[51:22] happens in that individual
[51:24] they repent they realize that they're
[51:26] sinners they realize that they've been
[51:28] living a life of unbelief
[51:31] and it causes them to repent and when
[51:34] they repent then they need to take a dip
[51:37] into the water as a type the water
[51:41] doesn't
[51:42] do anything you you could go down a a a
[51:45] wet center and come up or go down a dry
[51:48] center and come up a wet sinner it's not
[51:50] the water that does anything to you
[51:53] the water and the baptism is showing
[51:56] that something took place inside
[51:59] something has something has caused you
[52:02] to recognize that god is a reality that
[52:05] all things are possible with god and
[52:07] then the word says be baptized what is
[52:09] it it's it's being buried in the water
[52:12] is a symbol of being baptized is that
[52:15] your old life gets buried in the water
[52:18] you come out fresh and new and you're
[52:21] washed by the blood not by the water
[52:24] but by the life of jesus christ
[52:27] and now all things are possible for you
[52:30] all things are new it says you shall
[52:33] receive the gift of the holy ghost and
[52:36] the gift of the holy ghost is everything
[52:39] it's everything to a son or daughter of
[52:41] god because it's the quickening power

[1:07:32] and you know that there's nothing more
[1:07:34] that you can do because you've done what

[1:10:15] word of god now in this day
[1:10:17] and brother branham was the wave sheep
[1:10:19] he was the one that was there fulfilling
[1:10:23] his portion of the word
[1:10:25] and he had to bear a reproach
[1:10:28] but he was the word being manifested
[1:10:31] right there before the people
[1:10:33] and here he's talking he says now i want
[1:10:35] you to know this this is sure this is
[1:10:38] from the anointed ones at the end time
[1:10:39] and you that listen to this tape
[1:10:42] you might have thought today that i was
[1:10:44] trying to say that about myself being
[1:10:47] that i was packing this message
[1:10:49] like in other words like he's talking
[1:10:51] about how you know that that he was that
[1:10:55] he was the the word that was come down
[1:10:58] you know the anointed word for this day
[1:11:00] and for this hour
[1:11:01] and you know that you know he was he was
[1:11:04] the prophet of malachi 4 5. he was
[1:11:06] fulfilling revelations 10 7. but here
[1:11:09] you know
[1:11:10] he was trying to tell the people hey
[1:11:12] don't think i was talking about myself
[1:11:14] you need to recognize the word
[1:11:16] so when we're talking about fulfilling
[1:11:18] our ministry and you know you you tell
[1:11:21] people about that you know that the word
[1:11:23] is now being fulfilled in our lives you
[1:11:26] you should you should you know
[1:11:28] understand that this is truth this is
[1:11:30] what's actually happening you are
[1:11:32] manifesting you are fulfilling you are
[1:11:35] are revealing christ in this day
[1:11:39] in a many membered body this time
[1:11:42] and he says i have no more to do with it
[1:11:44] than nothing no more than just a voice
[1:11:48] you see they wanted to make him god
[1:11:50] because you know the perversion is that
[1:11:52] well he is god you know brother branham
[1:11:55] was god we need to baptize in the name
[1:11:57] of brother branham you see you see all
[1:11:58] the the the perversions of the enemy
[1:12:02] but here now we need to realize what was
[1:12:04] really taking place
[1:12:06] and my voice even against my better
[1:12:08] judgment i wanted to be a trapper but
[1:12:11] it's the will of my father that i
[1:12:13] declare to you and to determine to you i
[1:12:17] wasn't the one that appeared down on the
[1:12:19] river i was only standing there when he
[1:12:22] appeared
[1:12:26] i'm not the one that performs these
[1:12:28] things and foretells these things that
[1:12:30] happen as perfect they are i'm only one
[1:12:34] that's near when he does it
[1:12:37] see he was showing the son of man
[1:12:40] ministry in his day
[1:12:42] he was showing that it was christ doing
[1:12:45] it all that's why you are not god but
[1:12:48] you are an attribute of god
[1:12:50] and you are fulfilling the word in your
[1:12:53] day
[1:12:54] and it's not something to be ashamed of
[1:12:56] it's a reality i was only a voice that
[1:12:59] he used to say it
[1:13:01] it wasn't what i knew it wasn't
[1:13:04] it's what i just surrendered myself to
[1:13:07] do
[1:13:08] that he spoke through
[1:13:11] you see all we can do is surrender and
[1:13:13] allow the holy spirit to work through
[1:13:14] our lives amen
[1:13:17] it wasn't
[1:13:18] it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel
[1:13:21] oh no it was
[1:13:23] it was through it isn't me it wasn't the
[1:13:26] seventh angel oh no it was the
[1:13:28] manifestation
[1:13:29] of the son of man you see he was
[1:13:32] revealing the stage the present stage of
[1:13:36] of christ's ministry that was being
[1:13:39] introduced to the earth at that time
[1:13:43] and this is just months before he went
[1:13:45] off the scene
[1:13:46] but he was showing that he was
[1:13:48] manifesting now in a son of man ministry
[1:13:51] and that it was christ himself now come
[1:13:54] down
[1:13:55] and it's christ in you it's christ in
[1:13:58] the bride it's christ in the five-fold
[1:14:00] ministry that's revealing and and

[1:14:19] oh no
[1:14:20] it's not a man it's god the angel was
[1:14:24] not the son of man he was the messenger
[1:14:27] from
[1:14:28] the son of man the son of man is christ
[1:14:32] he is the one that you're feeding on
[1:14:35] you're not feeding on a man a man his
[1:14:38] words will fail but you're feeding on
[1:14:41] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:14:44] man
[1:14:45] amen that's what we're feeding on right
[1:14:47] now glory to god if you haven't fed
