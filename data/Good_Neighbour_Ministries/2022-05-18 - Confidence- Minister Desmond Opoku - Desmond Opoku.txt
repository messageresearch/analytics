tonight praise god there is no place to be down in the house of the lord you know god is good hallelujah without wasting time we're gonna go to our scripture tonight we're gonna read saint john

to be here tonight and i believe you father with me i have no words or what i know is you the lord jesus christ father we thank you we give you praise give us inspiration in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and amen saint john chapter 5 21 verse 15 to 17. so when they had dined that's the lord jesus christ eat dining with the disciples nine jesus said unto simon peter simon son of jonas lovest thou me more than this he said unto him yea lord thy knowest that i loved ye he said unto him feed my lambs he said unto him again the second time simon son of jonah lovers doubt me he said unto him yea lord thy knowest that i loved him he said unto him feed my sheep he said unto him third time simon son of jonas lovers down me peter said grieved because he said unto him the third time love without me and he said unto him lord thy knowest all things that know words that i loved he just said unto him feed my sheep may the lord add his blessing you may be sealed now my subject tonight is confidence you know peter know that the lord jesus christ know him that he loves him he know that he lost him but he was asking him a special question not the love that peter was thinking about he was asking him special love because he has a special work for peter to do he wants peter to have confidence he want to know if he has confidence because confidence the word confidence is firm belief trust someone that you can rely on sisterly nice to see you praise the lord someone that you can rely on can god rely upon you right now as you are in his presence it's a question to every one of us the lord is asking do you really love him more than anything in this world hallelujah there is a different love a love between your brother and your sister and at the same time your wife and your husband but god is not asking that kind of love he has a special work for peter so he was strengthening him because you know at that time the holy ghost was not given so peter was relying upon how he walked with the lord jesus christ daily but peter did he understand so what happened he was getting mad grieve he didn't like it but god wants peter to rely upon him because he has a special work for him so do you brethren sitting here tonight can god rely upon you can god has confidence on you because each and every one he calls for a purpose he didn't call us to come and sit on the pew every day day in day out you have to find your purpose where god can use you badly there is a work for each and everyone to do hallelujah could we imagine peter work with the lord for so long time but the lord still asks him do you really love me but peter couldn't understand why he was asking him but later hallelujah let me tell you if you're a believer sometimes people lost confidence especially sometime in their in their in their pastor if you love if you lost confidence in your pastor when he can see you when he does everything if you do a day day in day out he works so hard to feed you and you do something else and he tells you and you take that in his heart fresh heart because he wants to be you want to he is a shepherd god order him to be a pastor to you it doesn't matter whoever stands right on the pulpit here for god chose that person to lead you god already ordained him to lead you through brother abraham said even if you lost confidence in your pastor pray for him and if you think he has he has swept away but abram said your faith and your confidence to the word of god will turn him right back to the word of god to lead you brethren is going home time there is no time to fool around it doesn't matter where you are you know where we standing running in this world here now it's about it's a time to go home you have to find the place where you can fit and stay right there and do your part perfectly if you stay where you are and i'm staying where i am perfectly the word of god will move smoothly because i will not look at what you are doing because that's not my position to look what you're doing i have to do i have to stand firm for what god has entrusted in my hands to do so that your work and my work when we get together the holy ghost will move smoothly and the word of god will manifest the same exactly where he wants to be manifest each and everyone is important in the eyes of god in his place nobody is not important it doesn't matter who you are if you think you are not important i'm telling you you are deceiving yourself you are important in the eyes of god that's why he brought you here thank you lord god call his children because he know he has a work for them to do thank you lord amen as i said if you lost even if you lost confidence in your pastor you don't have to come to that his presence because god ordained him you cannot get nothing from him hallelujah the same thing the pharisees did because one day we're gonna say oh he's a man he's not god let me tell you you cannot bypass him to god to go to god no matter what you do you cannot bypass that pastor that is leading you and go to god god will never listen to you because you're there him to lead you through respect and obey obey him and you'll be blessed hallelujah thank you lord you're gonna say oh yes he's a man yes he's a man but you cannot bypass him to to to god he is your spiritual father on this earth here hallelujah why pharisees failed to see the lord jesus christ why because why they recognized him as he considers him as a man thank you lord but let me tell you he was more than a man when he took five loaves of bread and maybe three fishes or five fishes and feed and fed five thousand people he was more than a man when lazarus was dead for three days and he stood that tomb there and says lazarus comfort he was he was more than a man hallelujah god has a work for us to do hallelujah thank you jesus when he called moses moses was a man he put an anointed mercies the same way he anointed your pastor or the man of god whom god ordained to stand on this puppeteer to speak to you when you come inside the house in the presence of the heart of the lord look past who the man who is speaking to you don't look that man look beyond that man inside that man behind that man there's god there hallelujah the man who is sit standing in the on the pulpit preaching he is going to answer every word that he spoke to you it's not easy for god man to stand on the pulpit and preach to the sins of god because they are god people those people brethren are sitting on the pill they are god children so while you coming to speak to them you tremble there's a butterfly going through your belly your mind your soul because everywhere that you speak to them that word is the one who's leading them guiding them to the presence of god so if you don't

you you are more than people stand sitting on the pill you are angels god angels every christian a genuine christian is god's angel god's children they renewed them before they came to this earth yet

other brother they went there when that battle was going on when moses slept in sun like this here they were winning when his hand got tired they were losing so what happened so the congregation two brothers went there and lifted his hand up we don't have to leave our pastor or anybody who stand on these people's hands up so that we all that means we are all together in one accord the bible said when we are in one accord there's nothing that can stand before us hallelujah probably it's not just church it's reality you're more than what you think hallelujah thank you jesus amen how did moses lead the children of his life god made him the my peace of god he was a god through that day to the children of israel because everywhere that he spoke later befries the fries come only god can create

have confidence that dwelling in you how can you operate it you can't if you lack anything get on your knees it's time now can't you see around you what is going on even now you sitting on your own car they come with a gun in your head that gave me the key what is coming the head is already here you are the one who can stop him you walking around and you see somebody say satan leave that woman

everything that is going on here your life god can god will never bypass someone to me and to any one of us to correct somebody here he revealed to him and tell him what to do he said brother this one i see this goal i said you can deal with that situation because god has revealed to me hallelujah let me tell you i tell you 200 times now anybody god called to stand here to lead this church here everybody has to look past him and see the lord jesus christ because god is the one who anoints that person right here why do you think someone said pray perhaps someone knew that he's a man he cannot choose so he put to you to pray so that god can anoint somebody that will lead his people glory to god we are not here for favors nobody is here for favors let me tell you if you want to find a favor find a favor in christ hallelujah because i cannot help you maybe you're going to need 100 maybe not i need to give it to my wife i will give you unless god tells me gave it to him word of god physical friends you and my wife asked she said brother mike has money and i'm going to ask you bro give me 100 and he said mike oh i have to buy groceries you think am i going to give me that money no he will give his wife because he's going to buy grocery and put the food on the table so that all of them the children can eat say brother i have what are going to eat with me and my children as a woman and then the word of god said bake me a cake fresh otherwise if it's not a word of god the woman gonna eat with his with with her children he said son you understand so that's what it is don't look to man look this church here was not founded by brother simon he's founded by the holy ghost through him hallelujah i've been here for a long time i see i saw how many people has come here and they couldn't wait because the summer heart is journeying here so if you do something he gonna tear you straight because why he want to take you through the promised land so you don't want no contamination hallelujah thank you he doesn't want no diseases he chastises you you don't go you know the old time when moses was coming with the children of israel all those people who are rebelling against him muslims give him a space of time they couldn't repent and god said step out every time they do something mercy step in and say lord if you're gonna kill them kill me first the lord said enough is enough my word has to go on he cannot stand one place he has to go once he's got outside the earth open troop they all perish determined to lead his flock through the promised land so there's nothing that can stand his way hallelujah no human being no favors the holy ghost this church was built with the holy ghost if it's not a holy ghost i cannot stand here hallelujah the holy ghost upon this rock i'll be my church the revelation god has given to the pastor he stood on it he would never go nowhere i was listening to the message but abraham south africa the testimony he went there with his brothers from the united states and they try god told him what to do and and then the brothers brother password and all of them god said this place here i have children here you have to stay here a minister and the and the and then the brethren said no we have to go here but brother abraham would talk talk talk stop the car you stop the car then hallelujah thank you lord he stopped the car well why did they stop the car he said i'm not going no matter what brother raphael said the same people that they sit beside me behind me in my back everything they are the one that the devil is working against him again against me he said god i cannot do and he even gave the scripture he said don't go about this this is about babylon don't go and catch them this that they would not believe him then he went to the room and prayed he said god said you go but you're gonna pay for it you're gonna pay for it what are you gonna do way down in south africa he doesn't know nobody and all the ministers that wonder they all are one except only but god has given him a vision but he do not understand so they went brad braham said you're gonna face a lot of trouble he went and after that then the consequence that lord we're gonna get he gets sick so bad there's no healing he thought he was gonna die then he said he pray pray pray pray pray pray my brother the gospel that we have don't be rebellious this gospel is real don't joke about god does not joke about his word when god speaks he speaks and god speaks once he cannot change his mind but if you force him he's gonna say okay the same thing i just did balaam oh you say okay go what's already spoken you are the one that is going to make up your mind make up your mind after you fail the consequence then he prayed pray pray and one day god came down and said and and told him what to do and he took that sickness away from him but god told him this thing that you have done you're gonna pay for it so don't make mistake hallelujah thank you lord jesus oh god hallelujah remember jacob and esau jacob anderson brothers two brothers but one that's needed for the birthright god the birthright is the one who is going to get inheritance of everything the good stuff and jacob god revealed to jacob so he managed to get birthright and he saw what what uh what uh he whipped so much but he couldn't help no matter how much he went it could not happen so don't be like that god has given you this opportunity this is one in a million you think how many people will come and sit down here tonight to hear me standing here with all this broken english no grammar nothing but god does things for purpose amen that's what i said look beyond the pulpit god is standing there here anybody who stands here don't look to that person it doesn't matter god ordered him to be standing here before the foundations of the world god has orchestrated everything so don't fool yourself tonight god knew that maybe one word that will hate in your soul will take you so much far oh what i'm saying come closer to the lord jesus christ and don't deceive yourself we've been sitting this under this ministry so long it doesn't matter not so many people have this opportunity to be on this you know how many messages churches in this world but god reaching mercy he has given you anointed pastor to lead you listen to the pastor whatever he say who holy ghost i wanted to stand here let us all pray pray and god will know that person so that we all will lift that person's hand and get behind him let our uncle hold the sorry rock the rock that this church was built on let us stand firm hallelujah have confidence in god that the bride is here he's leading them to himself and if god is leading him to himself he can bring you so far for somebody to shade you god ordained to happen the pastor said pray pray pray pray let everybody pray so that the holy ghost who are not that person who say have confidence in god and have confidence in your prayer hallelujah they saw a web song to receive blessing joseph just jacob fought his way to receive the best right which one you want the best right or just the blessing
