[34:03] [Music]
[34:06] welcome to bring one of you here into
[34:09] the house of the Lord
[34:11] and it is our prayer that the great Holy
[34:15] Spirit of almighty God
[34:17] bless each one
[34:19] we know we are living in chaotic time
[34:23] the entire world is undergoing an
[34:27] upheaval of change and transformation
[34:32] and uh where God is preparing everything
[34:36] because we have to our dispensations our
[34:40] times are all changing and we know if we
[34:44] keep our eyes on Israel as God's time
[34:47] clock that things are swinging from the
[34:51] Gentiles back to the Jews and so he's
[34:54] preparing the groundwork and we don't
[34:58] have a Graphic picture of everything
[35:01] that God is doing or will do but we are
[35:05] certainly obedient in following him
[35:09] uh in his word and by the leadership of
[35:12] the great Holy Spirit
[35:14] now I'm standing here now because I will
[35:17] not speak this morning but uh my
[35:20] assistant here brother Danny mozilli how
[35:24] many knows who brother Danny was really
[35:25] is
[35:26] [Applause]
[35:29] brother Danny mozilli will be speaking
[35:32] uh bringing the word of God to you and I
[35:35] know it will be a blessing to you
[35:38] now it's not something I put him up to I
[35:41] don't know what he's going to be
[35:42] speaking on and the spirit gives him
[35:46] whatever he's going to speak on so we
[35:49] are trusting God we have no littonese
[35:51] here we have no
[35:53] um book of yearly sermons to preach that
[35:57] are already made out and dare anybody to
[36:01] divert from that we have no such systems
[36:04] here
[36:05] but we do have the word of God and we
[36:09] have the Holy Spirit here
[36:12] [Applause]
[36:13] [Music]
[36:15] foreign
[36:17] [Music]
[36:19] comes on
[36:21] um uh may I say this group or this uh
[36:26] local church is not aligned with any
[36:31] group
[36:33] of note in this message
[36:36] we do not seek
[36:39] anybody's endorsement
[36:42] for credibility
[36:44] or for the propagation of the word
[36:47] we are not engaged
[36:50] in marketing
[36:53] we are not engaged
[36:55] in networking
[36:59] it's good
[37:00] for business it's good for all the
[37:04] natural
[37:06] things that man has to do and if God
[37:09] wants to use it he will use it but we
[37:12] are not purposely consciously putting
[37:15] ourselves in the way
[37:17] we are known by this big brother
[37:21] influential in the message or this one
[37:24] over here that can give you an
[37:27] endorsement
[37:28] no such a thing
[37:31] right we stand with the word of God
[37:34] hallelujah
[37:40] and when I say that within the confines
[37:43] of what we call the message
[37:47] and even outside of those confines
[37:51] we stand with the word of God Amen God
[37:55] wants to associate us with anybody God
[37:58] wants us to know anybody learn anything
[38:00] from anybody but that's wonderful but we
[38:03] are not making any conscious efforts
[38:06] of marketing self-promotion
[38:08] self-production propagation any of those
[38:12] who
[38:14] those who marvelous
[38:18] append directly on the spirit of
[38:22] almighty God Amen and may God bless us
[38:25] all together because we are not here
[38:28] just for church as we call it Church
[38:31] but when we come into this building
[38:34] we come into the presence of a supreme
[38:38] this Supreme Being
[38:42] this is not a joke
[38:45] we come in here and he brother Branham
[38:48] said he gets here before you do
[38:51] and he is waiting for you
[38:53] to walk in these doors or in your prayer
[38:56] closet wherever you meet him he's
[38:59] already there right so uh when we come
[39:04] here the mystery of Fellowship is
[39:07] something Supernatural amen once you
[39:10] take it ordinary you know it's not this
[39:12] Sunday morning you run to church go with
[39:13] your Bible get the message or whatever
[39:16] then you're you're coming out of the
[39:19] supernatural element of it and I want to
[39:23] keep you as this church under that
[39:27] influence of the supernatural element of
[39:32] the power and presence of God Amen just
[39:35] like the apostles have it amen and when
[39:38] we are like that anything can happen at
[39:40] any time
[39:42] [Applause]
[39:48] at any time we don't know it it could be
[39:51] a child could suddenly God could use it
[39:54] could be a woman it could be a man we
[39:56] don't know we are surrendered to the
[39:59] will and the purpose of God amen amen I
[40:03] want you to know that for sure so that
[40:06] there's no guesswork going on here no
[40:09] questioning uh no doubting nothing that
[40:13] you have to wonder about we are united
[40:16] as one in Christ amen may the Lord bless
[40:19] your real good we're going to invite uh

[41:00] just need to plug in
[41:04] oh there's one on the pulpit
[41:07] oh yes good thanks brother Mike
[41:11] it's been a while
[41:15] and um
[41:17] you may notice it today that it's been a
[41:19] while
[41:22] but by the grace of God we're here and
[41:25] we're very very grateful for
[41:29] the words of our pastor there that just
[41:32] came forth because I am a big fan of the
[41:36] supernatural
[41:38] and the presence of the Lord and that um
[41:42] we are we are led by the spirit we
[41:44] operate by the Holy Spirit we are a
[41:47] supernatural Church
[41:49] it's the one thing that um
[41:52] I can testify
[41:54] all day long that that's that's why I'm
[41:57] here
[41:58] that's why a lot of you are here too is
[42:00] because of the supernatural intervention
[42:03] of the Lord at a particular time in your
[42:05] life
[42:06] and here you are some of us just a few
[42:09] years some of us a quarter Century
[42:11] already right but we're still here and
[42:16] we still believe the same we're just as
[42:19] excited about the word of God as we were
[42:21] when when we first heard it because he's
[42:24] a living God Amen he's a present God you
[42:27] know one of the greatest scriptures that
[42:29] that became life to me when I first came
[42:32] to the Lord was uh they that thirst
[42:34] after the Living God
[42:37] and and it was it was something that
[42:39] burned within my heart I needed to see
[42:41] God I needed to know that it was real I
[42:44] had been through too many faults
[42:46] uh situations and and trying to find
[42:50] that you know that that that element
[42:52] where you know that it's real and but it
[42:55] would always end up being some sort of a
[42:57] scam or something behind it or some you
[43:01] know uh coming to know the Lord then you
[43:03] find out that it was just it was it was
[43:05] witchcraft there was a lot of things
[43:07] that were going on that were just taking
[43:09] us further away from God but this
[43:11] message
[43:12] is God Amen is God Amen praise God
[43:18] so um this morning uh you know it's been
[43:21] about a year and a half since I've been
[43:23] up here so please bear with me I may be
[43:26] a little bit Rusty but by the grace of
[43:28] God I want to get completely out of the
[43:30] way and I want to let the Holy Spirit
[43:32] speak to our lives to our hearts to our
[43:35] needs you know one of the things that
[43:37] was Heavy upon my heart over the last
[43:39] few months and I knew that this was
[43:41] coming
[43:42] like I knew this was coming I just
[43:44] didn't know when but I know when the
[43:46] Lord starts to do certain things and
[43:48] reveal certain things and inspiration
[43:50] starts falling then something is going
[43:53] on and and by the grace of God then all
[43:55] we can do is just bring what he gives us
[43:57] amen praise God so before we do that uh
[44:01] let's pray let's pray father
[44:05] it is truly a privilege Lord and we
[44:08] don't in any way shape or form count

[47:46] though the world is falling apart in
[47:50] many ways many situations that are
[47:53] taking place around us
[47:55] yet we as the sons and the daughters of
[47:59] God the children of God I'm going to
[48:00] need water
[48:02] are walking with God in this pandemic
[48:06] we're not walking alone
[48:09] we're not to to get too caught up with
[48:13] this pandemic and and turn it into
[48:15] something more than what it is and
[48:18] forget about what God did in your life
[48:20] what God did in calling you in preparing
[48:24] you and bringing you into this
[48:26] Revelation that that you are now walking
[48:29] with God
[48:30] amen praise God next slide
[48:35] this Coronavirus
[48:38] is a plague
[48:40] it is it is a disease that's come upon
[48:44] the Earth how would God hear my God
[48:47] there's so many different controversies
[48:49] it was started here it was it was
[48:52] deliberately done I can tell you it was
[48:54] deliberately done by Satan himself
[48:58] too many people are getting caught up
[49:00] into these controversies and thinking
[49:02] that oh you know these people and and it
[49:05] was this this group and this that listen
[49:07] Satan is the God of this evil age
[49:11] we're living in the last days we're
[49:14] living in a time where we're going to
[49:16] see what's the difference between
[49:17] between coronavirus and cancer
[49:21] they both kill
[49:22] what's the difference between all those
[49:25] different diseases
[49:26] they're all diseases but the Lord has
[49:29] not changed he's still the Lord God that
[49:32] healeth all all every one of our
[49:35] diseases amen
[49:37] praise God forevermore so it's not
[49:40] coronavirus it's not cancer it's not
[49:44] Bell's palsy it's not uh diabetes it's
[49:48] not heart failure it's the devil
[49:52] [Applause]
[49:53] and there is a God that said I am the
[49:57] Lord
[49:58] I heal I give I take oh if you get that
[50:03] vaccination you're going to die I said
[50:05] is that right
[50:09] I got the vaccination I'm still here
[50:13] I'm living well
[50:14] I had a little sore arm big deal
[50:19] it didn't matter to me what they were
[50:22] injecting I said listen if they force me
[50:25] to go into a room tie me up and inject
[50:29] me with the most venomous snake Venoms
[50:31] on Earth
[50:33] and I had no choice
[50:36] they'd see a smile on my face
[50:43] they would not see fear
[50:47] because the lord giveth the lord taketh
[50:51] blessed be the name of the Lord
[50:55] we have read about too many testimonies
[50:59] of how God can stop death
[51:02] how God can reverse death how God can
[51:06] heal the sick raise the dead there's too
[51:08] many testimony listen nobody can
[51:10] convince me that that God is changing
[51:13] that all of a sudden we're in 2021 in
[51:15] the middle of a pandemic and we're all
[51:17] going to die
[51:18] it ain't going to happen not to Sons and
[51:20] Daughters of God not to those that live
[51:23] by faith
[51:25] we are not to be governed by fear we are
[51:28] to be governed by the word of God
[51:31] it is God's word listen it to Brother
[51:33] Brian he says here in in accepting this
[51:37] message I want you to take note it says
[51:39] accepting God's provided way at the end
[51:43] time that's the title of the message
[51:44] 1963.
[51:46] accepting
[51:48] he says now some of them said well now
[51:50] if the plague Falls we'll just go in the
[51:54] hospital
[51:55] if the plague if the plague happens to
[51:57] fall you know what we'll do we'll go get
[52:00] Dr Jones
[52:02] he'll know how to take care of it
[52:04] it didn't work
[52:07] yet they were smart
[52:09] oh they've got smart
[52:12] vaccinations now
[52:14] they've got things that can go into your
[52:17] body that can you know create any bodies
[52:20] to attack certain foreign this and that
[52:22] they're smart they're they're so
[52:24] intelligent the scientific world is
[52:26] reaching Heights and and areas where
[52:29] they're they're tapping into things that
[52:31] it almost looks Supernatural what
[52:32] they're doing
[52:35] there was a prophet that said there's
[52:36] nothing new Under the Sun
[52:39] there's nothing new Under the Sun
[52:42] everything that is happening is for the
[52:44] purpose of the Fulfillment of Prophecy
[52:46] God has prophecy for the end time we
[52:50] happen to be a part of that prophecy you
[52:53] need to recognize what part of the
[52:54] prophecy you are
[52:56] so that you can recognize where you are
[52:59] going to fit and once you see the part
[53:01] that God has called you to to fulfill
[53:04] you're not going to be you're not going
[53:06] to be worried and and governed by fear
[53:09] anymore because God has revealed to you
[53:11] that you are a son of God
[53:13] that you're an overcomer that no plague
[53:16] shall harm thee
[53:18] no no no no poisonous thing shall hurt
[53:21] thee so you don't have to worry if
[53:23] you're if you're gonna go get the
[53:25] vaccination go get it you're a son or
[53:27] daughter God what are you worried about
[53:29] you're worried that it's going to kill
[53:31] you you worry that it's gonna Mark you
[53:32] you're worried that it's the mark of the
[53:34] beast you I don't know what what kind of
[53:36] scam that is
[53:37] get back to the word and read what the
[53:39] word says go back and see what the
[53:42] prophet said he said here he said he'll
[53:45] know how to take care of it it didn't
[53:47] work yet they were smart well if the
[53:49] plague Falls we'll just go down beneath
[53:52] the ground in a cave and shut the door
[53:54] down that won't do it one bit of good he
[53:58] says
[54:00] we'll stay in the house and put a mask
[54:03] over our face and put some disinfectant
[54:06] on it didn't do a bit of good God made a
[54:10] provided way
[54:13] yes and it was what the blood
[54:16] Hallelujah
[54:18] I'm so glad that he allowed the blood to
[54:22] be poured upon my life and that I could
[54:24] take it I could I could apply it to my
[54:27] home
[54:27] I could apply it over my door I could
[54:30] apply it to my children I can apply it
[54:33] to my job I could apply it to my life to
[54:36] my health to my wealth to everything it
[54:39] was God's provided way in the end time
[54:42] but you've got to accept it
[54:49] too many people getting caught up
[54:52] not realizing that they're rejecting the
[54:54] word when they start to speak fear they
[54:58] start to speak oh this is going to
[54:59] happen that's going to happen if we
[55:01] don't do this this is going to happen
[55:03] we're not to be fanatical and go out
[55:05] there and say I'm a Son of God I'm I'm
[55:07] protected nothing can hurt me I don't
[55:10] care what you say you guys this what is
[55:13] that that's that's fanaticism the other
[55:15] way
[55:16] you see Walking with God
[55:19] is simple
[55:21] it's in the middle of a pandemic here we
[55:24] are and yet we can still walk with god
[55:27] without fear
[55:29] Hallelujah next slide
[55:32] the problem is right now
[55:35] there's too many distractions
[55:37] it's constant listen you got to be
[55:39] careful
[55:40] about tuning into the news every minute
[55:43] of the day
[55:46] too many people are caught up in that
[55:48] you got to be careful
[55:50] you start listening so much to that news
[55:53] and all it's doing is putting fear on
[55:56] the people fear you don't do this this
[55:58] is going to happen you do that this is
[56:00] going to happen you don't you got you
[56:03] cannot get caught into that
[56:06] as Sons and Daughters of God if you
[56:10] listen the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[56:13] against revelation
[56:15] that means whatever Satan whatever he
[56:18] lies whatever he tells you whatever
[56:19] they're saying out there if you've got
[56:22] to realize here this is a supernatural
[56:24] element this is the supernatural this is
[56:27] what a lot of Christians Listen a lot of
[56:29] Christian churches out there okay but
[56:32] this remember what we said at the
[56:33] beginning we came in contact with the
[56:36] Living God
[56:38] when Jesus was on Earth he was the
[56:40] Living God
[56:41] things happened around him that didn't
[56:44] happen anywhere else
[56:46] all the churches that were there at the
[56:49] time they were all kinds of different
[56:51] interpretations but wherever Jesus was
[56:56] there was life
[56:58] there was healing
[57:00] there was raised from the dead there was
[57:04] Supernatural taking place and where is
[57:06] he today
[57:08] where are you putting him today if
[57:11] you're not putting him into your present
[57:13] day life right now right now in the
[57:16] midst of a pandemic then you're going to
[57:18] get caught up into these lies and into
[57:20] these deceptions and you're going to be
[57:22] in in this state of fear
[57:25] when you should be in a state of victory
[57:28] Hallelujah too many voices too many
[57:31] distractions amen research you know what
[57:34] research is showing and this is probably
[57:36] a little old 53 percent of adults are
[57:40] reporting that mental health is
[57:42] declining people are going cuckoo
[57:47] because they're listening to too many
[57:49] voices
[57:50] Satan's purpose and and he's the author
[57:54] of confusion
[57:56] so what does he want to do he wants to
[57:57] get you all confused he wants you one
[58:00] one day I'm getting the vaccine I'm not
[58:02] getting it
[58:03] I'm gonna get it
[58:04] if I get it I'm gonna die
[58:07] my God it's it's unbelievable
[58:11] I'm just using that as an example you
[58:14] can apply that to whatever situation in
[58:16] your life that you're dealing with right
[58:17] now whether it's health wealth uh for
[58:20] relationships whatever it is you've got
[58:22] to put God in the middle of it
[58:25] and you've got to say Lord this is your
[58:27] promise
[58:28] you are the Lord God that that healeth
[58:30] you're the Lord God that gives peace
[58:33] there's there's there's havoc in my home
[58:35] right now I want peace Lord according to
[58:38] your word let the peace of God fall
[58:42] whatever it is
[58:44] take your position as a Son of God
[58:46] marriages relationships they're being
[58:49] significantly and permanently damaged
[58:53] because of this pandemic it is
[58:56] separating people left right and Center
[58:59] don't tell me that you didn't get you
[59:02] you didn't see that separation coming in
[59:04] around your life
[59:05] where all of a sudden you know your
[59:07] family is starting to look at you funny
[59:09] you're you're you know like what you
[59:10] believe and and and then and then it's
[59:13] constant it's constant uh you know
[59:15] pressure now well you know my sister
[59:17] says that I shouldn't go visit my
[59:19] parents because you know we haven't got
[59:21] our vaccination yet and you know we
[59:22] don't want to kill them and
[59:24] like it's it's it's constant and then
[59:27] all of a sudden you know you're arguing
[59:29] with your siblings
[59:30] I want to go see no you shouldn't go
[59:34] you're this you're that no this is real
[59:36] this is what's going on
[59:38] this is the kind of stuff that happens
[59:40] when you walk with God in the middle of
[59:42] a pandemic
[59:46] that's right
[59:49] right you see that's separating the
[59:52] people
[59:54] it's breaking Fellowship it's it's even
[59:57] moved into the Realms of this message
[1:00:00] saying oh if you get coronavirus you're
[1:00:02] serpent seed
[1:00:07] so what does it mean when you get a cold
[1:00:15] what happens if somebody gets diabetes
[1:00:18] what's the difference coronavirus cancer
[1:00:22] common cold what is it
[1:00:26] you see how you see we got to wake up we
[1:00:29] got to just come out of this we got to
[1:00:31] wake up and we got to stand where we are
[1:00:33] supposed to stand in our positions as
[1:00:37] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:00:39] Hallelujah
[1:00:43] we've got the most powerful weapon which
[1:00:45] is prayer
[1:00:47] I thank God for our prayer group for our
[1:00:50] Prayer Ministry it has been such a
[1:00:53] blessing I can tell you right now uh I'm
[1:00:56] gonna Advocate that it never goes back
[1:00:58] to in the church services for prayer
[1:01:01] meetings because we've never had such
[1:01:03] great attendance and such powerful
[1:01:05] results people you know because listen
[1:01:08] we're living in a world where time is so
[1:01:09] valuable people you know that extra day
[1:01:12] during the week to drive an hour and a
[1:01:13] half to come to a prayer meeting some of
[1:01:15] us live distance away and everything
[1:01:17] else and the power that God is blessing
[1:01:20] it God is blessing it thank you
[1:01:23] what's wrong with that
[1:01:25] there's God is is not okay we do need to
[1:01:28] assemble and we will assemble here
[1:01:30] whenever we can on Sundays on Wednesday
[1:01:33] nights as the Lord Wills by the grace of
[1:01:35] God but I'm seeing something in the
[1:01:38] prayer meetings that I know a lot of you
[1:01:39] have seen and a lot of you have
[1:01:40] testified back saying that that it's
[1:01:42] just been a tremendous blessing and so
[1:01:45] this powerful prayer that God has given
[1:01:48] us that we should constantly be fueling
[1:01:51] that
[1:01:52] if there's anything you want to improve
[1:01:55] and do more of in the midst of this
[1:01:57] pandemic is prayer we don't do it enough
[1:02:01] there's too many distractions the you
[1:02:04] know it says a life full of prayer will
[1:02:06] lead to a life that is full
[1:02:09] God answers prayer
[1:02:11] God can't God God can't make a promise
[1:02:14] and then not keep it do you understand
[1:02:16] so you can count on it amen praise God
[1:02:19] you know and then you got to wait like
[1:02:21] it says in Isaiah sometimes we pray and
[1:02:23] we don't get the answer right away
[1:02:25] it takes time things you you got to give
[1:02:28] things time they that wait upon the Lord
[1:02:31] shall renew their strength I know for a
[1:02:34] fact that when situations are really
[1:02:37] tough we all have them saints we we all
[1:02:40] have them I've had some recently come on
[1:02:42] everybody's Adam you're facing something
[1:02:45] in your life all I know is that when
[1:02:47] when I take it to prayer and and and
[1:02:51] their sincerity and then there's a group
[1:02:53] that that's even behind it
[1:02:56] strength comes back
[1:02:58] cannot explain it
[1:03:00] all the situation doesn't change it may
[1:03:03] not be completely answered the way we
[1:03:05] want it but yet strength comes back
[1:03:09] and you're and all of a sudden you're
[1:03:11] back on the field you're you're ready to
[1:03:13] go again you're ready to overcome you're

[1:03:32] with God Amen you know a simple walk
[1:03:35] next slide who would have thought that
[1:03:38] that you know a simple walk would have
[1:03:40] become so you know so much of a luxury
[1:03:43] you know while the pandemic was on
[1:03:45] people were looking forward to that walk
[1:03:49] every day they you know because they
[1:03:51] were stuck at home their jobs their
[1:03:52] businesses were shut down and they were
[1:03:54] taking a walk and they were walking
[1:03:56] because they needed to do something they
[1:03:58] needed to do some exercise and it was a
[1:04:01] luxury it was something that they
[1:04:02] enjoyed you know even us we would go out

[1:05:12] even in your walk you can have a closer
[1:05:14] walk with God while you're here on Earth
[1:05:16] it all what you sow what you sow you're
[1:05:19] going to reap what you put into your
[1:05:22] relationships you're going to reap you
[1:05:24] see it's all about sowing and reaping in
[1:05:27] this Dimension and that will never
[1:05:29] change that will never change so you can
[1:05:31] benefit from all of those things
[1:05:34] but here now
[1:05:36] I'm talking about a simple walk
[1:05:38] so let's go to the next
[1:05:41] and we'll look at Genesis 5 21-24
[1:05:45] we've we've heard of Enoch you know I
[1:05:48] believe that we are a perfect type of
[1:05:51] Enoch
[1:05:52] you that have done your studies and
[1:05:54] looked through the scriptures and looked
[1:05:56] at the life of Enoch you'll know that he
[1:05:58] parallels the Bride of Jesus Christ the
[1:06:01] church the current Ministry of Jesus
[1:06:04] Christ here on the earth because Enoch
[1:06:07] like it says here lived 65 years and
[1:06:10] begot Methuselah after he begot
[1:06:13] Methuselah Enoch walked with God
[1:06:17] he walked with God you know that those
[1:06:19] if you go back and look at those times
[1:06:21] and those days when were in the days of
[1:06:24] Enoch in the days when all those things
[1:06:26] there was a lot of things going on and
[1:06:28] civilization was probably even more
[1:06:31] advanced than it is now
[1:06:34] he built a pyramid that to this day
[1:06:38] they cannot even possibly fathom how he
[1:06:42] did it mathematically equipment wise how
[1:06:45] those those stones fit so perfect how
[1:06:48] they were measured so perfect how it was
[1:06:50] placed directly in the center of the
[1:06:54] earth latitude longitude all the
[1:06:57] aptitudes and everything else and how
[1:06:59] this this pyramid is so perfect what is
[1:07:01] it it's God
[1:07:03] it was God in Enoch God was in Enoch and
[1:07:08] Enoch was walking with God
[1:07:10] and God is in you as a son or a daughter
[1:07:13] of God and you're walking with God and
[1:07:16] there's benefits to walking 300 years he
[1:07:19] had sons and daughters so all the days
[1:07:21] of Enoch were 365 years
[1:07:25] and Enoch walked with God and he was not
[1:07:31] for God took him
[1:07:34] well praise God you know when you look
[1:07:38] at Enoch and you look at even even the
[1:07:41] word like his name Enoch it signifies to
[1:07:45] instruct to initiate to dedicate he was
[1:07:49] dedicated disciplined from his conduct
[1:07:52] we can see that he was early instructed
[1:07:56] in the things of God
[1:07:58] you know you're blessed you young people
[1:08:00] that you've been early instructed in the
[1:08:03] things of God because those are the
[1:08:05] things that will last those are the
[1:08:07] things that will make a difference in
[1:08:10] your life down the road those are the
[1:08:12] things that will change circumstances in
[1:08:15] your life because you were early taught
[1:08:17] the things of God and instructed in the
[1:08:20] things of God initiated into the worship
[1:08:23] of his maker and dedicated to his
[1:08:25] service it is but little that is
[1:08:28] recorded concerning him but this little
[1:08:32] is enough to make his name great greater
[1:08:36] than the name of the other Enoch who had
[1:08:39] a city called by his name because there
[1:08:42] was another Enoch amen I'm going to need
[1:08:46] some kleenex the box is empty here
[1:08:48] there was another Enoch that was the son
[1:08:51] of Cain
[1:08:52] that was a different Enoch this one came
[1:08:55] through the lineage of God
[1:08:57] through Seth because Adam had Abel Abel
[1:09:02] was killed Seth was the replacement for
[1:09:05] Adam because of the lineage of God
[1:09:07] because God's lineage was not going to
[1:09:09] run through Cain who was whose whose
[1:09:12] father was the serpent it was going to
[1:09:14] run through Adam Eve Adam and Eve and
[1:09:17] then Seth was the replacement for Abel
[1:09:20] and then from Seth down to the seventh
[1:09:23] came Enoch he will find him in the
[1:09:26] lineage of the original
[1:09:29] Adam from The Garden of Eden amen praise
[1:09:32] God and that's that's who you are from
[1:09:34] we are the Seed of Abraham it all comes
[1:09:37] down next slide
[1:09:41] so Enoch walked with God
[1:09:44] amen the world condition must have
[1:09:47] gotten so bad it was unfitting to leave
[1:09:50] him here any longer so God took him
[1:09:54] praise God
[1:09:55] God took him because the world's
[1:09:58] condition got so bad things got so bad
[1:10:01] that he couldn't leave Enoch on the
[1:10:03] earth anymore Enoch was so filled with
[1:10:05] the Holy Ghost
[1:10:07] so filled with the instruction of the
[1:10:09] Lord so inspired that he built the the
[1:10:12] Great Pyramid he wrote everything that
[1:10:16] was going to happen in that pyramid you
[1:10:18] know we're not going to get into that if
[1:10:19] you ever get a chance you want to go and
[1:10:21] study the Great Pyramid of Giza you will
[1:10:24] find out uh the the just how remarkable
[1:10:30] how remarkable
[1:10:32] that pyramid was in the way that Enoch
[1:10:34] built it
[1:10:36] but the key principles that we want to
[1:10:38] look at here is that Enoch walked with
[1:10:41] God
[1:10:42] he didn't walk with the with the with
[1:10:44] the scientists of the day
[1:10:47] he didn't walk with the podcasts every
[1:10:49] day oh new podcast coming up
[1:10:52] ready to listen in to hear what the next
[1:10:54] Scandal is in the Earth
[1:10:56] you know he didn't live with those with
[1:10:58] with the newscasters
[1:11:01] the naysayers
[1:11:03] he lived and walked with God
[1:11:07] and he was he was at work he was doing
[1:11:09] whatever he was doing and because he was
[1:11:11] walking with God he was constantly being
[1:11:13] inspired amen
[1:11:15] it was constant inspiration that was
[1:11:18] coming to him constantly about what was
[1:11:20] happening what was to come what was
[1:11:23] going on around him he was given the
[1:11:25] spirit of Prophecy he had the spirit of
[1:11:28] Prophecy upon him because he walked with
[1:11:29] God every single day
[1:11:32] now walking with God as a Christian
[1:11:34] doesn't mean that you're constantly with
[1:11:36] the Bible in your hand you go to work
[1:11:38] the first thing you do to break you sit
[1:11:40] down at break time you open your Bible
[1:11:41] you look at everybody else at the table
[1:11:43] why aren't you reading the word
[1:11:45] you know you're going to go to hell if
[1:11:47] you don't read the word
[1:11:48] that's not walking with God
[1:11:51] that's not the kind of walk Walking with
[1:11:54] God is simple
[1:11:56] god listen just go back and look at when
[1:11:58] Jesus was on the Earth
[1:12:00] he didn't go in right up into the
[1:12:02] priests and says I am the Lord come down
[1:12:05] from I am the Messiah I come here and I
[1:12:08] want the pulpit
[1:12:09] move aside everybody
[1:12:12] are you kidding
[1:12:14] he was so humble he was so simple he
[1:12:18] would walk with the public and he would
[1:12:19] just walk with the with the tax
[1:12:21] collectors he would even a prostitute
[1:12:23] joined his group and he says come come
[1:12:25] no problem he said he says I didn't come
[1:12:28] for the for those that had no need of a
[1:12:30] physician I come for those that need a
[1:12:32] physician
[1:12:33] I come for those that need healing I
[1:12:35] come for those that are that are seeking
[1:12:37] because if they seek they're going to
[1:12:40] find
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:42] Hallelujah glory to God that's the kind
[1:12:45] of walk with God that's simple it's not
[1:12:47] it's you don't have to make it anymore
[1:12:49] that you just got to do what you do
[1:12:50] every day but do it with God
[1:12:53] start the day and say Lord Lead Me Guide
[1:12:56] Me direct me inspire me let me Lord let
[1:13:00] me see the traps that may be laid before
[1:13:02] me in my home and my family whatever it
[1:13:05] is you want to walk with God you've got
[1:13:08] a huge Advantage Walking with God yeah
[1:13:13] next slide
[1:13:15] it's hard
[1:13:17] to please God as a human
[1:13:20] it's hard
[1:13:22] you are going to make mistakes
[1:13:25] you are going to get tired
[1:13:27] grumpy
[1:13:29] your wife is going to get on your nerves
[1:13:31] your husband's gonna get on your nerves
[1:13:33] your children are going to get on your
[1:13:35] nerves your boss is going to get on your
[1:13:37] nerves you're going to have situations
[1:13:39] that are going to get on your nerves
[1:13:41] and you're gonna you're gonna do things
[1:13:43] that are not pleasing you're gonna say
[1:13:45] things that are not pleasing sometimes
[1:13:47] thank God for the blood of Christ
[1:13:50] because it's the blood that keeps us
[1:13:53] it's the blood that that saves us on a
[1:13:55] daily basis from from from this human
[1:13:58] realm that we fight with every single
[1:14:00] day
[1:14:01] but we we got to recognize that pleasing
[1:14:04] God is not being perfect
[1:14:07] pleasing God sometimes is repenting
[1:14:11] is getting on your knees is is is is
[1:14:13] forgiving others
[1:14:16] is doing unto others as you would want
[1:14:19] done to yourself
[1:14:21] pleasing God is receiving revelation
[1:14:25] and living it
[1:14:28] you can't please the Bible says in
[1:14:30] Hebrews it is impossible
[1:14:33] to please God
[1:14:35] without faith
[1:14:37] without faith in other words God reveals
[1:14:40] to you
[1:14:41] why
[1:14:42] you love to serve him
[1:14:46] he reveals to you
[1:14:48] and blesses you in so so many ways that
[1:14:52] you just you can't you can't you can't
[1:14:54] love him enough
[1:14:55] you can't love him enough not because he
[1:14:58] did something for you it's because you
[1:15:00] know that he's always going to be there
[1:15:03] he's always going to meet your need
[1:15:05] regardless
[1:15:07] regardless of the circumstances
[1:15:09] situation God will always be there for
[1:15:12] you
[1:15:16] we want to try and please God by putting
[1:15:19] on works we want to we want to work this
[1:15:22] up and work that up that does not please
[1:15:24] God it's impossible to do it without
[1:15:26] faith and so many people try and and and
[1:15:30] do works and and and and and claim works
[1:15:33] and project works and and oh while we do
[1:15:36] this and we do that so we deserve this
[1:15:38] and we deserve that
[1:15:40] that's not the way you please God
[1:15:43] there's only one way that you please God
[1:15:45] and that's when you've received faith in
[1:15:48] your heart as a son or a daughter of God
[1:15:51] and in the midst of a pandemic in the
[1:15:54] midst of people falling from the left to
[1:15:56] the right and everything else you were
[1:15:58] there and you are serving him you are
[1:16:01] believing him you are you are trusting
[1:16:03] him regardless of the circumstances that
[1:16:07] pleases God
[1:16:09] when he sees you fall on your face
[1:16:12] weeping and crying in the midst of
[1:16:15] Despair and you are you've you know that
[1:16:18] you're at your weakest point he says
[1:16:19] that's when I'm the strongest in your
[1:16:21] life
[1:16:22] that pleases God
[1:16:24] because that's his word
[1:16:27] Hallelujah
[1:16:29] next slide says
[1:16:32] Enoch was a witness for God
[1:16:35] but it was because of Revelation
[1:16:38] that's what separates us
[1:16:42] Enoch walked with God
[1:16:45] and he was not for God took him now the
[1:16:47] Holy Spirit instead of saying Enoch
[1:16:49] lived says Enoch walked
[1:16:53] with God
[1:16:55] for it is the life of a good man to walk
[1:16:58] with God this was one the business of
[1:17:02] Enoch's life
[1:17:04] his constant care and work while others
[1:17:07] live to themselves in the world he lived
[1:17:10] to God
[1:17:13] you see he he did it for God
[1:17:16] the boss comes and says you do this you
[1:17:18] do that you do this or you're going to
[1:17:20] get fired
[1:17:21] but Enoch he went and did this did that
[1:17:24] do this for God Amen
[1:17:28] and two weeks later his boss got fired
[1:17:32] you understand it's not
[1:17:35] what we think
[1:17:37] it's what we believe
[1:17:40] it's what we it's what we know by
[1:17:43] Revelation that God is in control
[1:17:45] God
[1:17:47] operates the church
[1:17:49] God leads and directs the leadership in
[1:17:53] the church to do certain things and to
[1:17:56] act in certain ways
[1:17:58] God has a purpose behind it all
[1:18:01] we need to recognize and not be too
[1:18:04] overwhelmed by by by
[1:18:07] personalities by by uh positions by
[1:18:11] titles we need to sit back and pray not
[1:18:15] gossip not say this and say that we need
[1:18:19] to believe God we need to pray we need
[1:18:21] to know that God is in control because
[1:18:24] we have a revelation of God lived for
[1:18:27] themselves he lived for God since he did
[1:18:29] not live like the rest so he did not die
[1:18:32] like the rest
[1:18:34] Hallelujah
[1:18:37] no plague is going to take you
[1:18:41] and let me just say that if by chance
[1:18:43] you know a lot of people oh this brother
[1:18:45] died from the Coronavirus
[1:18:49] oh yes he had a heart condition and he
[1:18:51] had this and he had that but they say
[1:18:53] died from the from the corona no
[1:18:56] he died because it was his time amen
[1:19:00] he died because it was his time God can
[1:19:03] use anything what when somebody dies of
[1:19:05] cancer all of a sudden what's the
[1:19:07] difference like I I try to keep things
[1:19:10] simple in my mind so I don't want to get
[1:19:12] confused here
[1:19:14] so and I don't want you to be confused I
[1:19:16] want you to understand that that the
[1:19:19] Lord gives and the Lord takes he does
[1:19:21] not change God will do what he has
[1:19:25] planned from before the foundations of
[1:19:27] the world you're here for a purpose
[1:19:30] you're here to fulfill that purpose you
[1:19:32] want to line up in your mind with that
[1:19:35] purpose you because that's where you're
[1:19:37] that's where faith is by the way perfect
[1:19:39] faith is only found when you're in your
[1:19:41] position that's why those listen don't
[1:19:44] be running from the church don't be
[1:19:46] running from the body of Christ don't be
[1:19:49] leaving this body you need to get into
[1:19:51] the body you need to get into your
[1:19:52] position because when you're in your
[1:19:54] position the blood flows right through
[1:19:57] your veins
[1:20:00] you ever take an organ out of a body put
[1:20:03] it on a table it'll beat you take a
[1:20:05] heart out of somebody's chest put it on
[1:20:07] the table leave it there for seven
[1:20:09] minutes it stops it's dead it's done
[1:20:13] it's finished okay no more nourishment
[1:20:16] no more drying from the from the body
[1:20:18] the the edification that comes from the
[1:20:21] body no more uh you know strength that
[1:20:23] that you that you that you you don't you
[1:20:25] don't understand you know you you leave
[1:20:27] the body and then all of a sudden you
[1:20:28] think you're still going to be strong
[1:20:30] no not if God puts you here and if God
[1:20:33] needs you as a son or a daughter of God
[1:20:35] and takes you from this local body you
[1:20:37] better be connected to some other body
[1:20:39] because if not there's something wrong
[1:20:43] let's keep it straight here
[1:20:45] there's there's a local Body of Christ
[1:20:47] there's sons and daughters that have
[1:20:49] been called for a purpose into each body
[1:20:52] that God has set up from before the
[1:20:54] foundations of the world with a pastor a
[1:20:56] leader guidance leadership and all those
[1:20:59] things
[1:21:00] and when you're in that body and you're
[1:21:02] operating in that body and you're
[1:21:04] standing in your position even in the
[1:21:07] middle of a pandemic
[1:21:09] a lot of people got a big break because
[1:21:12] of the pandemic they didn't have to do
[1:21:14] anything they forgot about church
[1:21:17] they barely tune in once a week
[1:21:20] if it was convenient I'll watch it later
[1:21:23] it's recorded anyway
[1:21:25] not realizing there's nourishment
[1:21:29] that the Holy Spirit he's a supernatural
[1:21:31] God he's still feeding the body
[1:21:34] this is where he feeds the body this is
[1:21:36] how he feeds the body
[1:21:39] this is how he nourishes edifies
[1:21:41] instructs gives confidence puts Faith
[1:21:44] gives gives leadership gives Vision
[1:21:46] gives you know without Vision you perish
[1:21:49] that's what the scripture says
[1:21:51] you need leadership you need guidance
[1:21:53] you need Vision to be in in you know in
[1:21:57] in you know placed on You by the word of
[1:21:59] God
[1:22:00] Faith cometh by hearing by hearing the
[1:22:03] word hallelujah
[1:22:06] glory to God Amen
[1:22:09] next slide Hebrews 11 it says by faith
[1:22:15] Enoch that's how it starts by faith
[1:22:18] Enoch
[1:22:20] not
[1:22:21] John walked with God Philip work walked
[1:22:24] with God
[1:22:25] Jennifer walked with God Abraham walk
[1:22:28] with God
[1:22:29] it's one thing anybody can say I'm
[1:22:32] walking with God
[1:22:33] but it's different when it's by faith
[1:22:36] by faith
[1:22:38] he knew that God was real
[1:22:41] that God was present
[1:22:43] God was in his life even in the midst of
[1:22:45] a pandemic God is right there
[1:22:48] walking talking revealing he was taken
[1:22:52] up so that he did not see death and was
[1:22:55] not found because God had taken him for
[1:22:58] before he had taken he had this
[1:23:01] testimony that he pleased God
[1:23:06] we're going into Rapture you know that
[1:23:08] the message of this hour
[1:23:10] is preaching the body change
[1:23:13] that the that the five-fold ministry
[1:23:15] right now what God is doing through the
[1:23:19] five-fold ministry
[1:23:21] is actually speaking revelation of the
[1:23:24] rapture
[1:23:25] in many different ways
[1:23:28] because remember it's the Revelation
[1:23:30] that rides the word that's what has an
[1:23:33] effect on you not the actual words that
[1:23:36] you see
[1:23:37] but it's the actual spirit of God
[1:23:39] writing into Julie's heart
[1:23:42] speaking into our sister's heart here
[1:23:45] speaking personally telling them exactly
[1:23:49] what he has what what what's happening
[1:23:51] in their lives what's being changed
[1:23:53] around them why these circumstances are
[1:23:55] happening why the children are such a
[1:23:57] burden in so many areas why this that
[1:24:00] because God is testing you God is
[1:24:03] causing you to overcome God is
[1:24:04] delivering you from your unbelief
[1:24:08] because unbelief is when you when you
[1:24:10] start speaking things oh God gave me
[1:24:13] Serpent seed
[1:24:17] you know you know you get you get so
[1:24:19] upset you start looking at your children

[1:28:31] him today
[1:28:32] won't you seek the Lord today
[1:28:35] Hallelujah
[1:28:36] listen to The Prophet here next slide he
[1:28:39] says
[1:28:40] as I've often made this remark and said
[1:28:43] God made three Bibles the first one he
[1:28:46] put in the sky the Zodiac did you ever
[1:28:49] see the zodiac what is the first figure
[1:28:52] in the Zodiac the Virgin what is the
[1:28:55] last figure in the zodiac Leo the Lion
[1:28:57] he come the first time through the
[1:29:00] Virgin he comes the second time as the
[1:29:02] lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:29:05] he made the next one in the pyramid back
[1:29:08] in the days of Enoch when they made that
[1:29:11] pyramid and they measured them I don't
[1:29:14] understand it but to the wars where
[1:29:16] there they stoop and go on their knees
[1:29:20] for so long and can measure the distance
[1:29:23] of the wars you know where they measure
[1:29:25] to now Plum across the king's chamber
[1:29:28] and as this pyramid went up he could not
[1:29:31] build he could not build it with
[1:29:33] everything that we got today we couldn't
[1:29:36] build it why because it was God Enoch's
[1:29:40] life
[1:29:41] and this is all a type of your life it
[1:29:44] cannot be replicated it cannot be
[1:29:47] explained don't try to explain your
[1:29:50] peculiar life the way God designed you
[1:29:53] God designed you for a purpose and God
[1:29:56] designed Enoch to be the Fulfillment of
[1:29:59] Prophecy even into the last days amen
[1:30:02] praise God the next slide
[1:30:05] the word pyramid when translated from
[1:30:07] Hebrew to English actually means
[1:30:09] Revelations measured that pyramid was in
[1:30:13] such Perfection that even to the very
[1:30:16] inches to the very to each and every
[1:30:19] chamber everything was so perfectly
[1:30:22] written in there what is it saying that
[1:30:24] your life is perfectly written before
[1:30:26] God
[1:30:28] your whole walk
[1:30:30] is a progressive walk with God and it's
[1:30:33] a progression it's a progression of
[1:30:35] Revelation upon Revelation line upon
[1:30:38] line precept upon precept you will
[1:30:41] overcome
[1:30:42] you will you will prevail you will
[1:30:45] overcome this pandemic this thing will
[1:30:48] go at some point either it will go or we
[1:30:51] will go
[1:30:52] but it will not have any effect on your
[1:30:55] life unless you allow it to have an
[1:30:58] effect on your life
[1:31:02] you need to decide today you need to
[1:31:06] make that decision today whether you are
[1:31:08] going to allow these these these
[1:31:10] circumstances all these elements that
[1:31:13] are constantly bombarding you to to
[1:31:15] affect you to bring you down to get you
[1:31:18] uh depressed mental oppression is at
[1:31:21] levels that I have never seen I'm
[1:31:24] actually watching the way I talk to
[1:31:25] people nowadays thinking my God you know
[1:31:27] because I can be a little bit bold and
[1:31:29] you know the way I talk sometimes and I
[1:31:31] gotta really pull back I got to say wow
[1:31:33] you know like I got to be careful
[1:31:35] because people just boom they fly off
[1:31:38] the handle just like that
[1:31:40] you know and and it's because of the
[1:31:42] pressure you know it's the pressure that
[1:31:44] that's out there it's the constant
[1:31:45] pressure you know of of everything
[1:31:47] around them because they don't know
[1:31:49] what's going to happen they hear one
[1:31:51] thing one day the next day it's
[1:31:53] different then it's different then it's
[1:31:54] they're so confused they're becoming so
[1:31:56] oppressed people are just committing
[1:31:58] suicide
[1:32:00] because it's just too much they figure
[1:32:01] and and remember Satan will try and use
[1:32:05] this to get you to just don't care be
[1:32:08] careful of that don't care spirit I
[1:32:11] don't care I don't care
[1:32:14] if you don't care make sure you just
[1:32:16] don't care about the lies of the devil
[1:32:18] but care for others
[1:32:21] show them you care
[1:32:22] love them
[1:32:24] project the love of God
[1:32:26] that's who we are that's that's that's
[1:32:28] what we're made of Jesus when he walked
[1:32:30] on the earth they they couldn't see
[1:32:33] anything but love coming off of him you
[1:32:36] listen to the prophet of God that God
[1:32:38] sent us William Branham you listen to
[1:32:40] him just you know like when you get a
[1:32:42] chance go back and listen to that
[1:32:44] message accepting God's provided way for
[1:32:48] the end time 1963. I've got a lot of
[1:32:51] inspiration from there and you'll be
[1:32:53] really blessed if you listen to it now
[1:32:55] after hearing this message because
[1:32:57] there's nuggets in there that God says I
[1:33:00] have a provided way for you Anthony
[1:33:02] I have it for you brother I have it for
[1:33:05] you brother Gabriel I have a brother
[1:33:07] Bill I've got it for you Michael I've
[1:33:09] got a provided way he says accept it you
[1:33:11] got to accept it be careful don't get so
[1:33:14] distracted by the things in this world
[1:33:16] and everything else I've got to provide
[1:33:18] a way for you that that you will get
[1:33:20] through this end time
[1:33:22] God provided one for each and every one
[1:33:25] of those Patriarchs that when Moses
[1:33:27] faced the Red Sea God had a provided way
[1:33:30] when Joshua had to cross over God didn't
[1:33:33] give him a bridge God just gave him
[1:33:34] power in the name of Jesus Christ God
[1:33:38] gave Joshua what he had need of he had
[1:33:40] the he said I need light sun stands
[1:33:43] still in the name of Jesus it had to
[1:33:45] stay still because God has a provided
[1:33:48] way and when you tap into that provided
[1:33:50] way you tap into your position as a son
[1:33:53] or daughter of God you can overcome
[1:33:55] anything
[1:33:57] mental oppression go back to Hell from
[1:34:00] where you came from depression go back
[1:34:02] to Hell from where you came from
[1:34:04] Financial Financial uh burdens go to
[1:34:07] hell from where you came from the Lord
[1:34:09] is my God he wants to prosper me he has
[1:34:12] plans for me he's got great plans for
[1:34:15] you Hallelujah
[1:34:17] he's going to prosper you through this
[1:34:20] pandemic
[1:34:22] receive it in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:34:25] [Music]
[1:34:28] we are God's Bible today
[1:34:30] we are God's voice
[1:34:33] today and we are prophesying and calling
[1:34:37] the resurrection of the sons and the
[1:34:39] daughters of the Living God through this
[1:34:41] anointed word because the mighty Angel
[1:34:43] has come down he has possessed this
[1:34:46] five-fold ministry he is calling sons
[1:34:49] and daughters get into your position
[1:34:51] get into your office get back to the
[1:34:54] word of God where God can bless you
[1:34:56] strengthen you and take you from this
[1:34:59] dimension
[1:35:00] Hallelujah and closing here let's read
[1:35:03] two more quotes and then we close now we
[1:35:06] find out that Enoch come into God's
[1:35:08] provided way
[1:35:10] with his word and walked 500 years and
[1:35:14] pleased no not 500 but he walked for
[1:35:17] 365 years and pleased him and we find
[1:35:21] out that the mechanics was so perfect in
[1:35:23] him that when the Dynamics got to
[1:35:26] working in the engine it just took him
[1:35:29] off the Earth it took the first airplane
[1:35:32] flight to Heaven working on God's
[1:35:35] mechanics and Dynamics coming together
[1:35:38] he was not because God took him out of
[1:35:42] the earth without death Hallelujah
[1:35:45] that's exactly right he was walking in
[1:35:48] God's provided way amen glory to God
[1:35:51] Amen he was walking with god listen
[1:35:54] there's a dynamical power that's in you
[1:35:57] and when the mechanics start to come
[1:36:00] together with the Dynamics you start to
[1:36:03] place that word you start to put
[1:36:04] yourself where you're supposed to be
[1:36:06] that's the mechanics
[1:36:08] if you're out of the body right now
[1:36:10] you're not feeding on the body you're
[1:36:12] not receiving you're not you're
[1:36:13] rejecting whatever it is you're the
[1:36:15] mechanics are all off Dynamics can't
[1:36:18] come can't hit you right there in your
[1:36:20] position and fuel you with the word of
[1:36:22] God fuel you with inspiration to fulfill
[1:36:25] your part in the word of God the
[1:36:27] Dynamics and the mechanics must come
[1:36:29] together
[1:36:30] next quote in conclusion he says let's
[1:36:33] take another man with that quickening
[1:36:35] power there was a man Way Long Ago by
[1:36:38] the name of Enoch when a new thing come
[1:36:41] along when something come along and said
[1:36:43] well now we have to go back to the old
[1:36:46] school or this that or the other Enoch
[1:36:50] said I'm walking with God
[1:36:54] you're going to be taken into prisons
[1:36:57] you're going to be put into
[1:36:58] concentration camps you're going to be
[1:37:00] told that you know that this whole
[1:37:02] pandemic is is you know is all designed
[1:37:05] in a way you know to bring control in
[1:37:06] the world this and that it's all Satan's
[1:37:08] Eden
[1:37:10] it's got nothing to do with you
[1:37:13] heard the same things you know what he
[1:37:15] said I'm walking with God
[1:37:18] he said I'll walk with God
[1:37:20] and whatever God said do Enoch never
[1:37:24] missed one word
[1:37:27] he walked with God
[1:37:29] what was he he was a son of God he was
[1:37:33] an eagle that had been called to that
[1:37:36] day and you are called to this day
[1:37:40] this is your day he was full of that
[1:37:44] quickening power and when it come time
[1:37:46] for the old man to die God just sent
[1:37:49] down the ladder and he walked on up home
[1:37:52] he quickened him and took his mortal
[1:37:55] body up in a rapture
[1:37:58] amen
[1:38:00] that's that quickening power let's all
[1:38:03] stand
