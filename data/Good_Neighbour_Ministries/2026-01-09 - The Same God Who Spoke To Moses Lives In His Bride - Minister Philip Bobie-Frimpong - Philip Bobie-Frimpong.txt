TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey. Heat. Hey, Heat. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Welcome into the house of the Lord. Amen. Let's sing this song here. If words could fall like rain from this lips of mine. If I had a thousand years, I'd still run out of time. If you listen to our hearts, every beat would say, "Lord, I thank you for the truth. I thank you for the life. I thank you for it." Amen. If words can fall like rain from this lips of mine. And if I had a thousand years, I'll still run out of time if you listen to our hearts. But every beat would say, "Lord, I thank you for the truth. I thank you for the life. I thank you for the way. Listen to our hearts.

Oh, cast me none away from thy presence, oh Lord, and take not thy holy spirit from me. Oh, restore all to me the joy of my salvation and renew my spirit within me. Amen. Praise God. What a song to start the year because you don't want to have any condemnation in your heart. So that's very important that the restoration of the joy of our salvation. Amen. Because little things you do kind of bring you down. But David cried to God to restore the joy of his salvation. And that's what the bride of Christ need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, you can sit down. So as we entering the year those things are very very important. Amen. That because God will not hear you if there is iniquity in you. &gt;&gt; And it als say that blessed is the man whom I will not impute sin &gt;&gt; and whose iniquity is forgiven. So no matter what just make things right with God. &gt;&gt; Repent and move forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what you're supposed to do. Praise God. Hallelujah. Okay, Pastor Dan, if you're here, just lead us in prayer, then I'll start putting the finish here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray. Father, what a privilege and what an honor it is this evening, Lord, to be in your presence once again, Lord, on a Wednesday night, Lord, where we dig deep into your word and we allow your spirit to come and minister to our hearts and to our needs. Lord, I pray that you will take our precious brother Philillip this evening, Lord, and use him for your glory. Let your spirit come, Lord, and discern the needs of your people once again. And we will leave here rejoicing, knowing that it was good to be in the house of the Lord. Have your way now. We give you all the glory in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Okay, I have a couple of scriptures. So uh I'll be reading them. I'll be reading some of them whilst the service is going on. So um I have three scriptures now. Just short short scriptures. 3r John chapter 3:2. Deuteronomy 28:1213 and Hebrews 138. Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prosper. And in Deuteronomy 28:12, the Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heavens to give thee the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of thine hand, and thou shall lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow. Verse 13. And the Lord shall make thee the head and not the tail. &gt;&gt; And thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be bed, if thou thou hecken unto the commandment of the Lord thy God, which I commanded thee this day to observe and to do them. And then Hebrews 138, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. If I will title it is the same God who spoke to Moses lives in his bride. Heavenly Father, may you please bless the reading of your word. Bless your children. Please close my mouth from saying anything you don't want me to say. Help me Lord to speak the right word to help your children in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Please be seated. So if I this thing has just been burned on my heart from prayer meeting and I spoke a little bit on it on the 31st and I feel led to just still talk about it that the same God who spoke to Moses lives in your heart and he lives in my heart. But before um I go much into that, I'm just going to encourage everyone of us that as we entered like a new year, the first Wednesday, let's we don't know what lies ahead in 2026, but our confidence is in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we believe that God will see us through. And um as the children of Israel when they were um they were before they crossed the Jordan the ark of the covenant went before them and the priest high priest were behind that ark. So we have to behind that word let the word go forth and he promised that as he told Joshua you have not passed this way before but I'll be with you even in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. and he promised that I'll preserve your going out and your coming in. &gt;&gt; So I just a little of encouragement that as you entering we've entered the new year let's have that assurance &gt;&gt; that God will go before us. &gt;&gt; The word of God not only the written word but the revelation the revelated word &gt;&gt; will go ahead of us and &gt;&gt; fight our battles and do everything for us. So the same God who spoke to Moses lives in his bride. And just a little recap that um I know everybody know about it but I'm just going to bring it down there because when the fall happened all the purpose of God is to live in his bride live in human being. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But because the fall it kind of um break their relationship. So for God to bring us back um when that thing happened Adam and Eve they form a thick leaf to cover their nakedness that is a lot of people hide behind religion to do so wicked things but God told him that that fig leaf that religion would not work. &gt;&gt; It has to be a blood sacrifice. So he killed that first uh lamp and they used to cover themselves. From then on the children of Israel anytime anybody does anything wrong after the year they have to sacrifice animals to for their sins. But because that the spirit of the animals is lower than that of human beings when they go and commit make that sacrifice in less than a year that desire is still there. &gt;&gt; So in need a perfect sacrifice to take away that desire from our heart. &gt;&gt; And when the cry went out no one was worthy of heaven or on earth. There was no one who was able to die for us to take the mind their sins away. So God himself, the lamb of God, he took that book and open it. He came and shed his blood for you and me so that he can have that privilege to live in you and me. &gt;&gt; That was all his purpose to live in a man. So after he after he was after the Calvary when that sacrifice took place the the what went out was a spirit. So it became available for him to live in a man that's when after that he said that you have become the temple of God &gt;&gt; and he who that defiled that temple I will destroy. Amen. So now you and me are the temple that God dwells in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so from that time that same God, Amen, that came and died and did all the mighty works, he changed his office. He changed his mask. And then he became to live in man. And on the day of Pentecost, he multiply himself from 120 to 3,000 as many as the Lord our God shall call. And is God still God calling? Yes. So he still multiply himself. So Satan has a problem. He was dealing with one man Jesus. But now when he died, he multiply himself. So he has so many of us to deal with. Amen. Praise God. So our God is awesome God. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. So all I encourage you that the same God, he lives in you and he lives in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So what am I trying to say? Um a lot of people are trying to put God in the future. But he's a present help in times of trouble. &gt;&gt; He's God of today. &gt;&gt; Don't let people put him in future. If you allow them to put him in future, they're going to live under your privileges. Because as brother Daniel Mar used to say all the time, God doesn't want good intentions. &gt;&gt; He wants you to put things in action. &gt;&gt; You might have so much good intentions and you can never be able to put into practice. But when he comes into your heart, he will manifest every promise because people are putting that promise so far that they are not able to manifest it. But God is calling us don't live under your privilege. redemption in three part. Don't be satisfied with only your um your born again. Claim every promise in that book is yours. &gt;&gt; So believe God for all the promises in the Bible because it is all for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what I'm trying to say that don't let people put the third pool in future &gt;&gt; because as Kofi said one time immediately that that mighty angel came down in 1963 to open the seals. Everything that we have need of was revealed. &gt;&gt; It was open. &gt;&gt; Amen. From that time the temple became available. &gt;&gt; Amen. And demonstrate it in so many aspect to us. But the the thing of it is when it's needed for you to use it, God will come and speak it into existence and not something that you are going to h manufacture it or anything. &gt;&gt; When you are in need of it, he will let it come to pass. &gt;&gt; So don't let nobody put that in future for you. is a present help in times of trouble. And the same mighty God that spoke Abraham's need into existence &gt;&gt; when he wanted to he need a to sacrifice his only son &gt;&gt; God spoke a lamp into existence &gt;&gt; and he's the same mighty God he hasn't changed &gt;&gt; and that same God when his prophet brother Abraham needed a squirrel &gt;&gt; and he was need of squirrel that God spoke the squirrel into existence amen and that same God is here tonight &gt;&gt; to speak your needs into existence &gt;&gt; if thou can believe. All things are possible to them that believe because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. The same God that spoke to Moses. The same God that his mighty words is so much to even to wonder. The same God that parted the mighty Red Sea for them to pass through. That same God lives in you and in me. is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Our God hasn't changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So don't let no one put those promises, divine healing, prosperity, don't let them put in the future. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a present help in times of trouble. Let me read this quote again. Amen. I said, um, let me see this quote is I see and somebody said something about divine healing. Um just one time Lord and they claim it was in another day. See pointing off to what was maybe it will be over in the millennium. What do you need divine healing in the millennium for when you are immortal? Today is the day. This is the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then perseverance. He said perseverant paragraph 127. He said perseverance 207. Yeah. He said, "But I was heading my father's sheep and God helped me to take a kid out of a lion's mouth and a bear and so forth." And he said, "The God that will take give me deliverance from that lion's pow and that bear's pow, how much more will he give me the victory over the uncircumcised Philistine who is divine saying the days of miracles is passed. that big denominational creed that tries to place God miracles way back in here and divine healing over in the millennium when he will be immortal. God is the same yesterday, today and forever. If there ever was a God, he's still God. &gt;&gt; Sure, there he was. And you know what happened in the story? So what he's trying to tell you is that you won't need cars in the millennium. Aircraft and all the airplane, you got you not need them in the millennium. Now you need them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you need your healing. &gt;&gt; Because there over there you are immortal. &gt;&gt; You don't need healing back then. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you have any sickness or any infirmities now, you have the right to claim your healing &gt;&gt; because healing is by your faith &gt;&gt; because it's done already 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; It's you that have to accept it. By his stripes, we were healed &gt;&gt; way back then. If even the Lord Jesus Christ was to be here, brother, he cannot heal you because that thing is done finished. You have to accept it. You have to have faith for your salvation. You have to have faith for your healing. You have to have faith for every promise in the book. &gt;&gt; Don't let them tell you you don't need money in the millennium. Now you need money to help your children, to help the work of God, to take care of your family, to help others, to be a blessing. Why you can also be a blessing to others. Amen. As we read from the Deuteronomy, the Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to give rain unto thine land in season, and to bless all the works of thy hand, and thou shall lend unto many nations, and thou shall not borrow. And the Lord shall make thee the head and not the tail. &gt;&gt; And thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath, if thou hecken unto the commandments of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day to observe and to do them. &gt;&gt; So what I'm trying to say, you are not a tail, you are ahead. Don't allow nobody to push you down. &gt;&gt; And the the highest sin is there. The saints are going to judge the world. &gt;&gt; And if you are going to judge the world, you are the highest on the face of this earth. &gt;&gt; Don't look down upon yourself, &gt;&gt; not with a bright pride, but realizing that you are a son of God &gt;&gt; and God lives in your heart. on the that first night I was just chatting with pastor Simon back there and I believe that he said a profound statement when I was talking to him and he was saying that Phil you see what happened when we were children none of us worry about the food that we going to eat you never worry about the clothes that you're going to eat because we have confidence that your parents will provide those things and I don't think there's any child that will sleep and get up tomorrow and worry about how he's going to be fed or how it's going to be clothed. Multiply that by billion times our heavenly father who created heaven and earth. So if it become read to you and is revealed to you that lord Jesus Christ is your father as realized that he's no more a son of Ella and um Charles Brham that Bible became a new Bible. So when that revelation really strike you and you get out from your amnesia and realize that our heavenly father who owns all the earth the gold the minerals everything is your father you are a child of that king man your attitude will be different &gt;&gt; you will walk differently &gt;&gt; you're not going to be worry about tomorrow because you know that you Oh, he going to make a way. &gt;&gt; How he's going to provide, I can't I can't explain it. &gt;&gt; But if he can feed the animals, can feed the spirals and all those things, can't he take care of you? You of little faith, God take care of all those things. And if you are to be a child of your natural parent and you are a little baby, you don't worry about how you going to live. So why are we now tossed about worry about this, worry about that, worry about that. Just be still and know that God is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hide. Go behind the ark. &gt;&gt; Let the revelation of the word, let the ark of God go in front of you as a high priest. Because when they did that, they cross over Jordan. So in any j that you are facing when you put that word of God first that word of God will cross for you. The revelation of the word will make a way where there seems to be no way. Amen. Is the same yesterday, today and forever. The same mighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Silas and Paul when they were in prison, they began to pray. They began to shout. Amen. What happened? The earthquake took place, brother. The whole uh prison doors everything was all the chains were loose. Amen. That what do you call the centarian was so scared for his life. He wanted to take his life out but he said calm down. Don't do any harm to yourself. Amen. Why that centurion being a son of God? God has to let Paul go through all that. All the other prisons they were free because he was a son of God and he has to hear the word of God. Amen. So the people that were around him they all have a liberty and that same God is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the children of Israel when they were going to um Jericho. Amen. That Jericho had a lot of wars everywhere. &gt;&gt; They think that the wall was too big so nobody can come there. You see sometime when people think they are fortified they do all kind of stuff like Nebuchad time they think that they have that garden and that thing so nobody can come over there and so sin was what in abundance so when like even recently that happened I'm not supporting whatever happened but Maduro he thought that he has that they call it um what room is safe safe room so he's comforted that anything happen once he get in that safe room nobody can get him but it was too late so what I'm trying to say that don't the people shouldn't feel um in their comfort zone you got to move away from there &gt;&gt; and let God have his own way so when that wall was so big &gt;&gt; they thought that they cannot pass True. But they begin to sing. They begin to shout. They begin to march. March around that thing. March seven times, seven church ages. And when the first under the after the seven, they said that you have to begin to what? Shout and praise God. And they begin to shout. They begin to praise God. And that Jericho wall came crumbled. Amen. The enemy was defeated. So what am I trying to say is that when you are in prison in your mind when you are things are not going well rise up and sing and praise God all the Jericho around you will crumble all your problems will be crumbled. Shout and praise God. &gt;&gt; Sing and praise God because the singers go forth before the word of God comes. Amen. They pave the way for the word to come true. So when you are feeling everything just rise up. Don't let the enemy put pull you down. &gt;&gt; Remember who you are. &gt;&gt; You are a son of God. &gt;&gt; And hold the God, the same God who when Peter and John when they met that the lame man, he said that silver and gold have I done. &gt;&gt; But I came to you in the name of he said rise up and walk. &gt;&gt; I I believe that man began to shake himself. He began to walk. Why? That same God is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what do you have need of tonight? Because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; He will never leave you nor forsake thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. So as I read the quotation about David, David has an experience. God gave me an experience with the bear. He gave me an experience also with a lion. So when it came the time to meet that big giant, the Philistine, he didn't care. His faith was in the God &gt;&gt; that gave him those victories. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what I'm trying to say is that God in his infinite mind knows that there is going to be a time they're going to close our church doors, this will happen. And I believe this is the hour. We don't have much time to spend. The man of sin is here. Every promise that God spoke through our prophet has fulfilled to the doubt. The Lord Jesus Christ on the day that he was crucified about 300 prophecies it all happened bum bum bum bum bum bum. So don't let nobody put anything in future because Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever. So he is giving you an experience, a victory over here, a victory over here, prisoner upon prison, here upon there, there. So that when the final stage come, you have confidence and realize that what God has done to you, he will do it again. So you not you're not going to be scared of any situation because if God could speak something to existence in your life when you see that happen and then you are in a situation there's no way to go like Abraham's situation he has confidence in God so much that he said that I receive this child as one is impotent as old man. And if God could give him to me at that time, even if I kill him, he can also raise him up. &gt;&gt; So is you and me, you can HAVE CONFIDENCE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; GOD that brought you from the world. &gt;&gt; God that delivered you from cancer. &gt;&gt; GOD THAT DELIVERED you from worldliness. &gt;&gt; God that delivered me from drinking that brought all kind of life. When there is a need for anything to happen, that same God &gt;&gt; will speak it into existence. Amen. &gt;&gt; You just have to wait and see the SALVATION OF GOD. THAT'S what Moses told the people because they were encamp. Amen. They were facing the Red Sea and this Egyptian army, they were coming in numbers and the people had began to melt. But I believe that David, oh sorry, Moses had confidence in God. He realized God that appeared to him in that burning bush experience and he realized oh when I met this guy I told him I cannot even speak I gave him so much of my weakness I cannot do this I can't do this I can't do that but he said that I've ordained you are the one that going to do it &gt;&gt; AMEN HE SAW HOW God spoke through him with all the the the plagues and everything &gt;&gt; in the Egypt and how God brought them out and it came to a place that the Egyptians were even tired of them. So they gave them great substance to live from that country. Amen. If you they left great substances, we are living with another great substance. Amen. Because the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; So when Moses reached there, inspiration strike him. He said, "This Egyptian you see, you cannot see. You're not going to see them no more." Amen. He spoke that and later he cried and God said, "What do you have in your hand? &gt;&gt; Just speak and go forth. &gt;&gt; What do you have in your hand today? Speak and go forth. That same God is here." &gt;&gt; Amen. To speak your needs into existence. While the word is going on, whatever you have NEED OF, TRUST AND HAVE CONFIDENCE, THAT SAME GOD is here, he will speak that need to existence. &gt;&gt; Amen. If your motive is right and your objective IS RIGHT, THAT SAME GOD will be speak your needs into existence. &gt;&gt; So don't worry, everything going to be all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So those Egyptians were nowhere to be found. Amen. And I believe that David one time also got the same situation when Saul was after him. The Philistines were after him. He was caught in the middle, but God delivered him. And some people, two people that really trust David. They knew he was going to be the king. Amen. It doesn't matter how they have I believe that revelation in the word of God. So you know what faith doesn't look look beyond earth. So they looked at man this our king this one we know is going to be the king but Saul is after him the Philistines after him but their confidence was still in the word of God and they stood by David. So when they heard the least desire of him they risk their life and go and get water for him to drink. Amen. That's how much confidence they have in David. And God delivered him from Saul and from everything. And it even came to a point that God gave him an opportunity to get rid of Saul, but he didn't do. He said, "I will not touch God's anointing." So what am I trying to say? Not every time that God gives you an opportunity for your enemy that you have to go after them. Sometime let grace takes over &gt;&gt; because remember Israel was wrong as wrong can be and normal people some people would have said oh if God told them I'm going to get rid of all the people Moses I'm going to start a new generation through you but with the spirit of Christ in Moses he said no &gt;&gt; he interceded for the children of Israel &gt;&gt; and the same God is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't look at what Israel has done. He interceded for them. And in Braban ministry, whilst he was preaching, a young man and his girlfriend were doing an act that was very wrong. And he said that they were trying to tempt me. And God said, "I gave them to you. Say whatever you want." He didn't say, "Let pill of fire come and strike them." But he said, "I gave them their salvation and they repented that time and have grace." So let's project grace, grace, grace, grace. Because sometimes we could have been there as John Wesley said, "There was I but what the grace of God." &gt;&gt; So let's project grace in every situation. And when grace projects, love takes over. Amen. So he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Our God hasn't changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I'm coming back to my point. I haven't left that point yet. When you have need, God will speak that need into existence. Amen. because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. The same God that was in Abraham ministry, that same God is here with us. Because remember there, he said that as he told Joshua, as I was with what? Moses. Amen. So I'll be what? With you. It's a Joshua ministry. So the same God that was with the prophet is with you and me. He hasn't changed. He'll do exact same thing he did in his ministry through maybe not to that high point but because a many members body going to do it um through us not only one person. So our God is awesome God. And as I was saying that don't let no one put that tle in the future because said that it will pass through the nose of a lot of people. Why is it going to pass through their nose? Because they were always putting in the future this will happen. So when the thing is happening they don't even see it. But that same God is moving. It's a mighty work. When God spoke bra to existence, I believe the same God when one time a former pastor was he said North Carolina or something and the lady came with a need and he said I gave you your husband. when he said that he said later I said my ministry but because it wasn't him a voice spoke through him that voice was God's voice &gt;&gt; and it has to come to pass &gt;&gt; it attract that man to walk all over so many miles to come and make things right the with the wife that same God is here with us &gt;&gt; he hasn't changed he's the same yesterday today and forever &gt;&gt; even Even as I always say that one time I went to go to work and the supervisor was not expecting me because the job for a Jewish guy. I spoke over here and over but then I have I was there like 6:30 in the morning. I drove like an hour and I didn't have nowhere to go. So I told the guy I'm not give me a little space to work. When those guys comes I will leave and I pack and I go home. And I believe that something came to me. I didn't think about it. When God is doing something, you don't even think about it. The thing just come through you. &gt;&gt; And I told the guy, "Those guys are not coming boldly." And he said, "How can you prove it? These guys, I've worked with them for 10 years. They are always on time. They are never late." I said, "They are not coming." And then something said once you spoke it so loud boldly if they come what's going to happen and a voice rose up in me said God said let there be light and light came and he believed and light came and I believe and I stand by that word of God within like 3 four hours the guy came to me asked me Phil will those people come said I don't know later I said you are more powerful than who what you think you I'm not powerful. The God in me is a mighty God. And those guys never show up until I finish the job. He told me they were going to come the following day. He gave me a lot of trouble. I said they are not coming the following day in my heart. And they never show up. They never show up until I finish and I left. And Braov, what do you think? What took place when God told Brahic to come and tell you that that sickness is not unto death. IT'S THE SAME GOD. SO GOD I have to give a floor. Every one of you have a testimony how God has done a mighty work through you. So you are a little David. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when there is a need for anything to happen, God will speak into existence when it's needed. So don't let people put the third pool in future. The third pool is here. The seventh or the seventh is everything is here. Everything that you have not available now, God is in you. You are greater than what you think you are. Everything you have need of today is inside of you. &gt;&gt; You have to activate it. &gt;&gt; You have to bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't look to anybody left or right. &gt;&gt; Look to Jesus because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need of is inside of you already. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when you take a glass of water from sea, that glass has the same ingredients &gt;&gt; as the whole sea. It might not be that big sea, but it has the same. And he said um he said that the father the I in the father, the father in me, and I in you. Amen. In other words, all that was in God, he poured into Christ. And all that was in Christ, he has poured into his bride. &gt;&gt; So everything is in you. That same God &gt;&gt; is in you and in me. &gt;&gt; He lives in you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't want as we entering the year, we have to have that confidence. &gt;&gt; Moving forward that God lives in us. The same God &gt;&gt; who created heaven and earth &gt;&gt; whose mighty word who spoke to the woman and the world. The same mighty God that spoke THROUGH JOSHUA AND SAID son stood still and son obey him. The same God when he was here and the wind was blowing. Is there any wind in your life? He said storm calm down. He came down when was in Colorado. Amen. hunting. The voice said, "Speak." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that wind &gt;&gt; all the snow everything was clear. &gt;&gt; Who was doing that? It's not him is God. The same God is here. He decoke &gt;&gt; and first time he said am I hearing right? And he ignore he thought that it wasn't God but he came back but two times they say oh then he took his heart and he says stom yeah this that and everything obey him. Amen. Who was that? It was God in the prophet. It was God doing through that. And that same God &gt;&gt; is here tonight. &gt;&gt; He's in you and in me. So as we enter the 2020, &gt;&gt; let's have that confidence &gt;&gt; and believe that same God is in you and me. Don't let nobody lie to you &gt;&gt; that you're going to get your car in millennium. You're going to get healing millennium. Now you need your healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. That Peter asked him, we have left mother, father, brother, sister, everything and follow you. What are we going to get? He said there's none that has left mother, father and left or forsake everything and follow me that will not be blessed in the present and the world to come. &gt;&gt; That same God is here. Amen. Don't let no one put in the future. Now is your salvation getting near and nearer. Now redemption is nearer than before. Amen. Let's walk in the spirit as he in the spirit. sons and daughters BUT ARE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF THE LIVING GOD. &gt;&gt; LET THAT spirit lead you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't lead yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Give yourself away to Jesus &gt;&gt; and let him lead you and direct you every step of the way. Amen. And oh man, he will do a mighty work through you. I mean God want to move this morning. &gt;&gt; He want to do a mighty work through rest. Going for that mighty west. Are you ready tonight for the mighty God to use you mightly because he's willing to use? &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's going to use us more than we can even imagine. And the and the beauty of this, Pastor Danny, when it happens, you know that we have nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; It's him that did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the glory belongs to the Lord Jesus Christ. Let's give him an applause. Amen. Because now you know what the the bride is resting on they resting on God on the word of God on God's ability. Not the bride's ability but the ability of God to do mighty work through us. Amen. Said the works that I do shall you also do. Amen. And greater than this. Amen. Because he's the same God in you doing it. Amen. God hasn't changed. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll do mighty works. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our God is awesome. &gt;&gt; He's wonderful God. &gt;&gt; Let's give him an applause. Let's love him. Let's live for him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I believe that what we need as we entering the year is more of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; is more of him a closer walk with him. &gt;&gt; That's excuse me that's what the bride need nothing else so that he himself will lead his life through. Amen. When temptation rise, when anything happened, he is there to lead his life through us. He hasn't changed. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He promised he's never going to leave you nor forsake you. Amen. Because he's going to live his perfect life through you and me. Amen. Hallelujah. He hasn't changed. So as we seek more of him, the other thing too that um you have some people that comes to church and sometimes they think, "Oh, nobody talk to me. Nobody invites me. I'm not invited for this. I'm not invited for that." and they whining and they crying and they complaining and they doing this and they doing that. But you don't have to do that. Look at example that God gave to us. The prophet of God, he was raised up in a family that they were very despised. He said when I was young when he even go say sometime they tell that he's a trash nobody has to talk to him but the point I'm trying to make is that when God came into him when God called him and God used him and do that mighty work through him he was even hiding from friends. So what is it? What it is that Christians has to do? Have that relationship with God. Let your relationship with God be this. Hi. And when you are in love with him, he will draw his children to you. You become as brother that say you are become a nectar whatever li you attract everything just like um Esther. That spirit on her was so sweet that he attracted the king to her. So you just fall in love with God &gt;&gt; and let God have the preeminence and who he wants to bring to your life, he's going to draw them to you. &gt;&gt; Whom he want to kick out, he going to kick them out. You don't have to worry about friends. What a friend we have in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a fault it is to take everything to him in prayer. &gt;&gt; He's our best friend. &gt;&gt; He's the one that has to be your friend. &gt;&gt; And when he's your friend, he's a friend indeed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everyone will fail you. &gt;&gt; But he will never fail you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He will never leave you, nor forsake you. Amen. So why do you worry about earthly friends? Know why the psalm said when earthly friends forsaken hold on to God's unchanging hands? Because remember even Job who was the richest man in his in his time &gt;&gt; when he was in trouble &gt;&gt; when everything was gone away from him all the friends deserted him &gt;&gt; and they began to even what blame him. Secret. &gt;&gt; Secret sin. &gt;&gt; And look at your natural friends. When things are going on good, you got a lot of friends. They come to you, they char this. When things go wrong, you think they come to you, they're going to whisper. This guy, even when he get the money, he didn't use the money right. They're going to bring all your faults and let everybody knows your downfall. But a friend indeed is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So let's put our faith in him. &gt;&gt; And Job confidence was in God. when that trial becomes so hard on him and even his life. You know the marriage couple, the greatest thing to your heart is your wife. And maybe Job was thinking that if everybody has forsake me, my wife will stand by me. When the trials get hot, this wife will never leave me. He going to she going to stand by me. And then I believe maybe Joe was surprised when the wife came one time she said why don't you curse God and die and be free. He said thou speaking like a foolish woman. Jo confidence was in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wasn't worshiping his wife. &gt;&gt; That wife was not his God. &gt;&gt; His money and the mansion. Everything he had wasn't his God. &gt;&gt; God was first to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He have that revelation that the Lord taketh. The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We is the God of the mountains. He's the God on the valley. In the valley, when things go wrong, he will make them right. The same God is here. Amen. So when everything was gone and God showed him a vision and he said that I know that my redeemer liveth even the skin worm destroyed this body yet in my flesh I will see God. &gt;&gt; He saw the rapture. He saw everything. Amen. And he came out victorious. &gt;&gt; Why? Because his confidence is in God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, all other things will be added onto it. When God bless you with material things, don't let that take you away from him. &gt;&gt; That should be a secondary. &gt;&gt; He blesses your wife and children. Don't let that be a a a hindrance to you. &gt;&gt; Put God first. &gt;&gt; Our family, we love them, but God first. Amen. &gt;&gt; I love my wife. I love my children. But God first. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the priority of everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that Job have that revelation. So as we entering, we've entered the year and you are head the head not the tail when the riches increase remember God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let that riches become your God. Like the worldly people, they put that ahead and sometimes even believers, we get to a place that we sometimes let things that we need become so like life and death that some people will rather choose not to come to service but to chase that dollar. I'm not saying that you don't have to work on Sundays. The Bible said that when the off the date, you have to pick it up. But it doesn't have to be a habit. You have to make way because forsake not the assembly of yourselves even as the time what approaches. So in your heart, you have to have that desire to serve God. you have to have that desire to put him first. I remember when I first became a Christian and then I was just new in the country and uh I started going to church about 2 3 months and then I was not working then I got a call Sunday when I finished taking my shower about to take my clothes to go to church phone call hey we have a job for you can you come and do it right now agency I didn't even have a revelation of nothing said job church job said No, I'm not coming. Then I went to church. The following day, I got a better job more than the agency and I did for like 2 3 years until I left that place. Why? Because I praise God first &gt;&gt; and he answered it. And I even remember when I used to work in 8 years, I used to do two jobs and then it came to me so much that I need to take only one so that I can be in the house of service. And then in my life to be honest with you, there's never a time that I I have a struggle to sleep. I always sleep like a baby every time. I don't have private I can sleep at any time. But the one time in my life that I never slept when that thing was weighing on my head, I didn't know what to do, how to like switch between the two jobs I was doing because one of them was a daytime and I didn't like that day job so much. But the one I like was in the afternoon. So I was thinking if I leave this afternoon job, I don't like this day job. But if I leave the day job, I won't be able to work in the afternoon. I won't be able to come to church if I take the afternoon job. So in the I was thinking about it like that and then all of a sudden a thought came to me go and talk to Ganet and he give you that job in the day where you like in the daytime and I went I said Ganet I want a day job over here. He said, "Phil, it's available." And once God opened that door for me, within two months, I rose to be a supervisor because the manager there was so in love with me. Show me everything he was doing. And if it's not, I could manage that business around that time by 15, 20 people around me because I put God first. &gt;&gt; So let's put him first in everything. &gt;&gt; Don't let nothing comes before you, between you and the love of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; As we entering the year, let that love of God flow through you so much that it will even let you love your enemies. Because remember one thing Paul talk about Abraham, he treat everybody exact same. Let's treat everybody the same regardless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let's love one another. Let's pray for one another. Let's commit everyone into God's hand. That's what I have for tonight. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And before I go, Grace, can you put on the same God for me? The Lar I call the musicians. Put that song on for me. I look back on history, see the mighty God unveiled, proving over and over that his word can never fail. But I can't keep on dwelling on some past me. Cuz now that same God is living in me. Oh, the same God who spoke to the woman at the well. The same God whose wonders too many to tell. The sing God who parted the raging resting. He is the same God who's living in me. The same God who created all the heavens and all the earth. He came back living in Jesus. And there was power in his word. But now in these last days, I'm beginning to see that it's that same God who's living in me. The same God who spoke to the woman at the well. The same God whose wonders too many to tell. Sing God who pardoned the raging red sea. He's the same God who's living in me. Oh, he's the same God who's living in me. Amen. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. If the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwelt in you, dwells in you. Oh, if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you, oh dwells in you. It will quicken your mortal body if that same spirit does. It will your mortify. If the same spirit dwells in you. Oh, if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you, dwells in you. If the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you. dwells in you. It is quickening my mortal body. For the spirit dwells in me, it is quickening my mortal body in the same spirit dwells in you. How many had a wonderful time in his presence tonight? Amen. The same God that was in Moses and in his bride. Amen. We certainly appreciate brother Phillip tonight healing himself to speaking the Lord speak through him tonight. Amen. Hallelujah. Sing one more song and then we can we can go. Um give me the key of E flat. Every promise in the book is mine. Every promise in the book is mine. Every chapter, every verse, every line. I am trusting in his love divine. Oh, every promise in you is mine. And knowing not, knowing not the art of death, knowing not, knowing not, ye are temple. Knowing not, knowing not, you are the temple. You are the temple of the holy. Full of praise. Full of power. Full of glory. Full of praise. Full of power. Full of glory. Full of praise. Full of power. Full of glory. You are the temple of every promise. Every promise you wrote is mine. Every chapter of every I have trusted in his word. Every promise in the world. Amen. Go out there and take what is yours. Amen. You are dismissed. Amen. May the Lord guide you and protect you. Let us have a prayer. Let's just have a quick prayer before we leave. Lord, we are so grateful for your loving kindness towards us, your faithfulness tonight, Lord Jesus. As we leave, not from your presence, but take us home safely, oh God. Bring us home to our home safely, oh God. And we look forward to come back into your presence on Friday and then on Sunday. We give you thanks and praise in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me and is. Oh s is thundering to seeking newly made life so many souls have made us pray for some we are what God has promised us today we Praise. No one's ger that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. I greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me.
