[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] good wednesday evening to you all may
[0:17] the lord bless us all together
[0:21] praise his marvelous and wonderful name
[0:26] on sunday
[0:28] last sunday we had such a wonderful time
[0:32] speaking
[0:33] on that marvelous
[0:36] topic
[0:38] amen
[0:39] and my brothers
[0:42] it was just so marvelous how the holy
[0:45] spirit
[0:46] moved in a
[0:48] wonderful and precious
[0:50] way
[0:51] amen and how many
[0:55] many
[0:56] millions
[0:57] around the world not only in north
[0:59] america
[1:01] but around the world many are dying on
[1:04] the doctor's doorstep
[1:07] they're right close to it
[1:10] but
[1:11] refuse
[1:13] to
[1:14] keep pace
[1:15] refuse to take
[1:18] what god offers to them through the
[1:22] doctors
[1:23] and men of science may god bless us all
[1:27] as we look into the word
[1:30] today on a an absolutely different topic
[1:35] for we are speaking
[1:38] uh
[1:39] indirectly
[1:40] on the book of life
[1:43] but we will be touching on
[1:46] the life of judas
[1:49] in the bible
[1:50] was jesus
[1:52] uh saved
[1:55] and later when he sinned
[1:58] was he lost
[2:00] so that is our topic for tonight
[2:04] was judas saved
[2:06] or lost
[2:09] our scripture
[2:11] is found in revelation chapter 3
[2:15] verse 5.
[2:19] he that overcometh
[2:21] same
[2:23] shall be clothed in white raiment
[2:27] and i will not blot out his name
[2:33] out of the book of life
[2:36] but i will confess his name
[2:41] before my father
[2:44] and before his angels
[2:47] thank god for his for this marvelous
[2:50] bread of life the word of god
[2:54] which if a man eat in faith
[2:58] he will live forever
[3:00] let us pray
[3:02] our gracious father
[3:05] we thank you for this thy word
[3:09] and as we
[3:12] enter into the spirit of the word
[3:15] we pray in the name of jesus christ are
[3:19] risen
[3:21] lord
[3:22] that you will
[3:24] gather us together
[3:26] in oneness
[3:28] no matter how physically far apart we
[3:32] may be
[3:33] when may we be gathered together
[3:37] by the pull of the holy spirit
[3:40] and under the anointing of the word
[3:45] that you may use this opportunity
[3:48] as we sit beneath the tree of life
[3:52] that your voice will come speaking to us
[3:55] through the leaves may you receive all
[3:59] praise all glory all worship we bow down
[4:04] before you
[4:05] we
[4:07] worship you we adore you and magnify you
[4:10] be thou glorified we pray
[4:13] in jesus name
[4:15] amen
[4:18] praise god hallelujah
[4:23] now in the
[4:24] book of john
[4:28] 6
[4:30] i would like to read a scripture here
[4:35] amen
[4:37] and in this we read
[4:40] all that the father had give given me
[4:43] shall come to me
[4:45] and him that cometh to me
[4:48] i will in no wise cast out
[4:52] for i came down from heaven
[4:56] not to do mine own will
[4:59] but the will of him
[5:02] that sent me
[5:04] and this is the father's will
[5:08] which had sent me
[5:10] that of all which he had given me
[5:14] i should lose nothing
[5:17] but should raise it up again
[5:21] at the last
[5:22] day and this is the will of him that
[5:26] sent me
[5:27] that every one which seat the son and
[5:30] believe it on him had everlasting life
[5:33] and i will raise him up
[5:37] at the last day
[5:39] amen
[5:40] praise god for this marvelous uh reading
[5:45] of his holy word amen praise god
[5:49] hallelujah
[5:51] now
[5:53] in revelation 3 of which we read
[5:56] verse 5
[5:59] the bible tells us clearly
[6:03] that he that overcome it
[6:07] and i'm reading it right now
[6:09] the same shall be clothed with white
[6:11] raiment
[6:13] and i will not blot out his name
[6:17] out of the book of life
[6:21] i will not blot out his name
[6:25] one who overcomes
[6:28] their name will not be
[6:31] removed
[6:32] from the book of life
[6:36] or lamb's book of life
[6:39] they're one and the same
[6:42] the book of course uh is a book with
[6:46] sections but
[6:48] it's the same book
[6:51] the book of life the lamb's
[6:54] book of life
[6:55] is the very same book
[6:58] now
[6:59] because of prevailing thinking
[7:03] which i have heard and you would have
[7:06] heard also
[7:09] of how that there is this teaching
[7:12] and this embedded belief
[7:16] that has been placed into the minds
[7:19] and into the hearts of the people
[7:22] many people
[7:24] that
[7:25] god places the names
[7:28] of those who are born again
[7:32] within
[7:33] the lamb's
[7:35] book of life
[7:37] and it's written down earth's place
[7:40] there
[7:41] at the time
[7:43] of their born-again experience
[7:46] amen
[7:48] and they believe that the name is
[7:50] written at that particular time
[7:54] now of course
[7:56] we recognize
[8:00] that that
[8:01] is not so
[8:05] as we begin or continue this study here
[8:10] there is not one record anywhere in the
[8:14] bible in the word of god that will tell
[8:17] you that god is presently
[8:21] recording names
[8:24] within
[8:25] any book
[8:27] and the reason why
[8:29] that is not found like that
[8:32] is because the names
[8:35] were already placed
[8:38] within that book
[8:40] before the foundation of the world
[8:44] hallelujah
[8:46] for god doesn't have to wait to know
[8:49] your act your intention
[8:51] no matter how century many centuries or
[8:55] millennials their passes
[8:58] god is the great i am he's ever present
[9:02] so he knows all he sees all he's aware
[9:06] of all he knows what we would do before
[9:10] we do it he knows what decisions actions
[9:15] we will take before we take them so he
[9:18] doesn't have to wait for your age your
[9:21] time your day that moment to come
[9:25] for you to actually do say or act on
[9:29] something before he
[9:32] he actually like just like a man says oh
[9:36] i've seen him done it so now i'm going
[9:39] to write his name within the book no
[9:42] we're talking about the almighty god who
[9:46] knows all who sees all and your
[9:50] name was already
[9:53] written
[9:54] in the book
[9:56] of life before the foundations of the
[10:00] world amen
[10:02] now
[10:03] when
[10:04] we go down the road
[10:08] of thinking
[10:09] along
[10:10] the old song i always uh refer to my own
[10:15] congregation
[10:17] there's a new name written down in glory
[10:21] and it's mine oh yes it's mine
[10:24] oh
[10:26] that is one of the songs
[10:30] that we sang and maybe is still being
[10:34] sung
[10:35] by many
[10:36] in the various organizations and
[10:40] churches out there that they were a new
[10:42] name
[10:44] now being written in god's book
[10:49] but when you do that
[10:51] you automatically uh magically are
[10:55] introducing the thought
[10:58] that there are two groups of people
[11:01] one group whose name they're written in
[11:04] the book
[11:05] and another group whose names have been
[11:08] refused
[11:10] and not and their names are not placed
[11:14] within the book whatsoever so
[11:18] we we find that the scriptures
[11:22] we will find from the scriptures
[11:25] that such a thing is not true
[11:29] for there are many multitudes
[11:33] that will
[11:34] come into god's kingdom
[11:37] and receive eternal life
[11:42] that never
[11:44] were born again on earth
[11:47] or did any repenting whatsoever on earth
[11:51] but yet will be introduced
[11:55] into eternal life
[11:57] by the hand of god
[12:00] secondly
[12:03] there is a
[12:05] group of people another group of people
[12:09] whose names were on the lamb's book of
[12:12] life
[12:14] before
[12:15] the foundations
[12:17] of the world
[12:19] and such a ones
[12:21] whom the bible calls god's elect
[12:25] under no circumstances
[12:28] can their names be removed from off of
[12:32] the lamb's book of life
[12:35] amen
[12:36] hallelujah oh
[12:39] there's another group
[12:41] whose names
[12:43] were on
[12:44] that
[12:45] great
[12:46] divine record
[12:49] before the foundation of the world
[12:53] but their names
[12:55] will be removed
[12:57] from off
[12:58] of the lamb's book of life
[13:03] now
[13:04] to reemphasize
[13:07] there is no basis for any claim
[13:11] to think
[13:12] that the
[13:13] book of life
[13:14] and the lamb's book of life are
[13:17] different books
[13:18] it's the same book
[13:21] book of life
[13:23] the lamb's book of life
[13:26] it also may be called
[13:28] in the scripture
[13:30] christ's book
[13:32] it might be called my friends
[13:35] the book of the living
[13:37] it might even be called the book
[13:40] but
[13:41] it's all the same book
[13:45] within that book there may be sections
[13:48] or different groups of people coming in
[13:52] but they are all they're recorded in
[13:55] that book
[13:56] oh yes
[13:58] and some as we have just stated that are
[14:02] elected by god before the foundation of
[14:06] the world
[14:07] under
[14:08] no
[14:09] circumstances whatsoever can their names
[14:14] be removed from off of god's holy record
[14:19] uh that he has uh take given or written
[14:23] or recorded
[14:25] now my friends
[14:27] we see it here as we read from
[14:30] revelation chapter 3 13 verse 8
[14:35] and all that dwell upon the earth
[14:38] shall worship him the beast
[14:41] whose names are not written
[14:47] in the book
[14:48] of life of the lamb
[14:51] slain from the foundation
[14:54] of the world
[14:56] amen yes sir so their names not written
[15:01] in
[15:02] the lamb's
[15:04] book of life
[15:05] slain from the foundation of the world
[15:08] revelation 17 8
[15:11] the beast that thou sawest and is not
[15:15] and shall ascend out of the bottomless
[15:18] pit and go into perdition
[15:22] and they that dwell on the earth shall
[15:25] wonder
[15:26] whose names
[15:28] were not written
[15:31] in the book of life
[15:33] from the foundation
[15:35] of the world
[15:37] when the beast saw
[15:39] when they behold the beast that was an
[15:42] is not and yet is
[15:44] and again another reading revelation 20
[15:48] 12-15
[15:50] and i saw the dead
[15:53] small
[15:54] and great stand before god
[15:58] and the books were opened
[16:01] and another book was opened
[16:04] which is the book of life
[16:06] and the dead
[16:08] were judged out of all those things
[16:12] which were written in the books
[16:16] according to their works
[16:19] and the sea gave up the dead which were
[16:23] in them
[16:24] and they were judged every man according
[16:28] to their works
[16:30] and death and a hell were cast into the
[16:34] lake of fire this is the second death
[16:39] and whosoever
[16:41] was not written found written
[16:44] in the book of life
[16:46] was cast into the lake of fire
[16:51] you can see my friends
[16:53] that the
[16:55] other books are mentioned
[16:57] this one book
[16:59] the book of life or the lamb's book of
[17:02] life
[17:03] is mentioned here
[17:05] as the record
[17:08] that god has
[17:10] amen
[17:11] praise god now you say well brother
[17:14] simon um
[17:16] where is that book located
[17:19] is it in some monastery somewhere
[17:22] is it a secret record kept by an
[17:25] illustrious person upon the earth
[17:28] uh is it kept
[17:30] uh some ins by some secret order with
[17:34] the names on it
[17:36] absolutely not
[17:39] for the bible tells us
[17:42] from luke 10
[17:44] 17-24
[17:46] and the 70
[17:48] returned again with joy
[17:51] saying lord even the devils are subject
[17:55] to us through thy name
[17:58] and he said unto them i be held satan
[18:02] fall from heaven light lightning
[18:05] behold i give unto you power to tread on
[18:09] serpents
[18:10] and scorpions and over all the power of
[18:14] the enemy and nothing
[18:17] shall by any means hurt you
[18:20] not with standing in this
[18:23] rejoice not that the spirits are subject
[18:26] unto you but rejoice rather
[18:30] because
[18:32] your names
[18:34] are written in heaven
[18:37] so the book is located
[18:40] in heaven hallelujah and in that hour
[18:44] jesus rejoiced in spirit and said
[18:48] i thank thee o father lord of heaven and
[18:52] of earth
[18:53] that thou hast hid these things from the
[18:56] wise and prudent
[18:59] and has revealed them unto babes
[19:03] even so father
[19:05] for it seemed good in thy sight
[19:08] all things are delivered me of my father
[19:11] no man know it who is the son
[19:14] the son is but the father and who the
[19:17] father is
[19:19] but the son
[19:20] and
[19:21] he to whom the son would reveal him
[19:26] so the book of life is definitely
[19:30] located
[19:31] in heaven
[19:33] and
[19:34] it will
[19:36] appear at the white throne judgment
[19:41] where the earth will be judged
[19:45] all sinners will be judged
[19:48] as the bible tells us
[19:50] judged every man judged according to his
[19:55] works
[19:57] what are your works
[19:59] what does your actions say
[20:02] what does your lifestyle
[20:04] say the bible tells us you will be
[20:08] judged by your works
[20:10] therefore
[20:11] let us search ourselves search our
[20:14] actions
[20:16] watch how we act what we do and how we
[20:19] live
[20:21] so that when the where we're referred
[20:24] back into the book
[20:26] he will know you by your works
[20:30] let us look my friends and see what god
[20:33] has for us
[20:35] amen
[20:36] in this verse that we just read
[20:39] jesus told them
[20:42] jesus told them
[20:44] your names were written in heaven
[20:47] hallelujah
[20:49] they were written in the book of life
[20:54] hallelujah because that's where
[20:57] the names are placed
[21:01] amen that's where it was verse 17
[21:06] of john 6
[21:08] jesus speaking to the 70.
[21:11] amen
[21:12] and also in verse 23 he spoke to his 12
[21:16] disciples
[21:19] they had been rejoicing come back from a
[21:21] revival meeting and they were casting
[21:24] out devils and healing the sick and
[21:27] having great success and great blessing
[21:31] you know rejoicing like that i believe a
[21:35] lot of churches would rejoice in that a
[21:38] lot of groups and organizations will
[21:40] rejoice in that and
[21:42] yes we should rejoice in that but jesus
[21:46] is saying uh the the thing you really
[21:49] should rejoice in
[21:52] not that you the sick are healed or
[21:55] devils are cast out
[21:57] but rejoice that your names are written
[22:01] in heaven
[22:03] but in other words that is your blessed
[22:05] assurance your name is already written
[22:09] there on the page bright and fair in the
[22:13] book of his kingdom your name is already
[22:17] written there and now my friends what a
[22:21] great blessed assurance that to know
[22:25] that our names are written in the lamb's
[22:28] book of life before the foundation of
[22:33] the world glory to god hallelujah amen
[22:38] you will notice
[22:42] that when jesus spoke to the 70
[22:47] and when he said your names rejoice that
[22:50] your name
[22:53] your names
[22:54] are written or recorded
[22:58] in the heavens
[22:59] that judas was amongst them
[23:04] was jesus
[23:06] saved or was he lost
[23:10] many assumed that judas was saved
[23:13] because he was a part of jesus's church
[23:18] or congregation or group
[23:21] and he believed and went along with
[23:25] everything that jesus did
[23:28] later on we read in the holy scriptures
[23:32] how that judas was the guide to them
[23:36] that came to capture jesus
[23:39] he had sold him
[23:42] for 30 pieces of silva
[23:45] like many of you are doing to our lord
[23:48] today
[23:50] selling him out
[23:52] for not just 30 pieces of silver
[23:56] but now it's 30 000.
[23:58] now it's 30 million
[24:01] but the same
[24:03] principle action and attitude
[24:07] selling out our lord for for drink or
[24:11] money or woman or for fame or for
[24:14] fortune or position or popularity
[24:18] they're selling out the word
[24:21] selling out the lord selling out their
[24:24] faith
[24:25] selling out their belief
[24:27] and laying it down
[24:29] just like that judas
[24:33] was amongst them
[24:36] they were casting out devils and he was
[24:38] casting out devils
[24:41] they were praying for the sick he was
[24:43] praying for the sick also
[24:46] amen
[24:47] in john chapter 6 verses 70 to 71
[24:52] jesus said
[24:54] have not i chosen you twelve listen have
[24:58] not i chosen
[25:01] you twelve
[25:03] and one of you
[25:06] that he just said i chose
[25:09] you twelve
[25:11] but one of you is a devil
[25:17] amen
[25:19] yes sir
[25:20] he spake of judas iscariot
[25:24] the son of simon
[25:26] for he it was that would betray him
[25:29] being one of the twelve
[25:32] john
[25:33] 17
[25:35] 12
[25:36] while i was with them in the world
[25:41] i kept them in thy name
[25:45] thou
[25:47] those that thou gave us me i have kept
[25:49] and none of them is lost
[25:51] but this son of perdition that son of
[25:55] the devil
[25:57] son of perdition son of hell
[26:00] yes that the scriptures might be
[26:04] fulfilled
[26:05] and again in john chapter 13
[26:09] verses 10
[26:10] to 11 and verse 18.
[26:14] jesus said to him
[26:16] he
[26:17] he
[26:18] that is washed needed not safe to wash
[26:22] his feet but is clean
[26:24] every wit
[26:26] and you are clean
[26:28] but not
[26:30] all
[26:32] i speak
[26:34] not of you all
[26:37] for but and i know whom i have chosen
[26:42] but that the scripture might be
[26:44] fulfilled
[26:46] he that eat that bread with me had
[26:49] lifted up
[26:51] his heel
[26:52] against me
[26:53] yes my friends
[26:56] judas
[26:58] was chosen by jesus
[27:00] we all should admit that for it's
[27:03] written in your bible in the scriptures
[27:07] he was
[27:08] given to jesus
[27:11] by the father
[27:15] chosen by jesus
[27:17] himself
[27:20] and jesus testified
[27:24] that his name
[27:26] was recorded in heaven
[27:29] judas's name was recorded in heaven
[27:34] does that mean he was saved
[27:36] no it does not
[27:37] but here it says his name was
[27:41] recorded in heaven
[27:43] now let me uh pause here for a moment
[27:49] if you will write this scripture down go
[27:51] read it sometime
[27:53] first kings
[27:55] chapter 22
[27:58] verses 20
[28:00] to 23.
[28:02] in these verses
[28:04] within this chapter
[28:06] you will find the
[28:08] story
[28:10] or the
[28:12] record
[28:13] of how
[28:15] god sitting on his throne
[28:18] the prophet
[28:19] uh
[28:20] michaela speaking of how god sitting on
[28:23] his throne
[28:24] and in a vision
[28:26] he saw a lying spirit
[28:30] come up before the lord
[28:33] and
[28:34] ask god
[28:36] choose me
[28:38] give me permission
[28:40] to go down
[28:43] to be a lying spirit in the mouth
[28:46] of ahab's prophets and i will entice
[28:49] them
[28:50] and i will lie
[28:52] in their through their mouths
[28:55] and the bible tells us that god
[28:59] permitted him or chose him to go for
[29:04] that job there upon the earth and that
[29:08] lying spirit came down to the earth went
[29:12] into the 400 prophets of uh baal which
[29:18] were prophets of ahab
[29:20] and
[29:21] used their lips their mouths their
[29:23] thoughts to tell religious lies
[29:28] i believe that's repeating again
[29:31] that those same lying spirits have
[29:33] returned to earth again
[29:36] and they're
[29:37] they're dropping an anointing and using
[29:40] a lot of preachers
[29:44] to tell religious lies
[29:48] enticing spirits
[29:50] operating
[29:52] in the religious realm
[29:54] on the religious covering
[29:58] hiding behind the veil of christianity
[30:02] to lie and cheat and steal commit
[30:05] adultery fornications to to commit all
[30:09] manner unspeakable crimes
[30:12] in the name of christ they use his name
[30:16] in vain and do these things that are
[30:20] unspeakable that are not to be even
[30:24] talked about but it is there for
[30:27] everyone to hear
[30:29] and know about
[30:31] yes my friends
[30:33] judas was chosen but he was not saved
[30:38] he was not born again
[30:42] his name was written or recorded in the
[30:46] heavens
[30:48] but yet he was not part of god's elect
[30:54] certainly
[30:56] his name being
[30:59] on the book of life
[31:01] for he is a living creature a living
[31:03] being
[31:04] living person
[31:06] so he's in that book of life
[31:08] within the lamb's book of life
[31:13] as we have read
[31:15] he was a son of perdition
[31:18] but the bible tells us
[31:20] he was given by the father chosen by
[31:23] jesus name recorded in the heavens and
[31:27] yet he was lost
[31:30] yet he was he was a son of the devil
[31:34] he was a hell-bound creature
[31:38] posing
[31:40] acting
[31:42] and speaking and doing
[31:45] while in jesus's congregation
[31:48] while in jesus's church
[31:51] while claiming christian christ
[31:54] he was operating under that guise
[31:58] but it was nothing but a chosen
[32:02] and permitted
[32:03] devil
[32:04] that had to come to the earth
[32:07] to
[32:09] be the accuser to be the one that will
[32:11] sell out the word oh my friends
[32:15] jesus the scripture says that the
[32:18] scriptures might be fulfilled hallelujah
[32:22] amen
[32:24] so there are such ones
[32:27] upon the earth at this time
[32:29] who knows if i have any within my church
[32:33] or group maybe i do maybe i don't i
[32:36] don't know that's for god to say
[32:39] but here we find my friends
[32:42] judas was in jesus's church
[32:45] so why would my church or my little
[32:48] group
[32:49] uh
[32:50] be
[32:52] you know so special that it would have
[32:54] none i don't know of that but i must
[32:58] look to the word the word is showing us
[33:01] and telling us what god is saying here
[33:04] within his word amen
[33:08] now
[33:09] very similar
[33:12] to pharaoh
[33:14] from the book of exodus
[33:17] the bible tells us clearly
[33:20] that
[33:21] pharaoh was chosen
[33:24] he was chosen but his name
[33:28] was not
[33:30] in
[33:31] the book
[33:32] of life
[33:35] let me repeat
[33:37] pharaoh
[33:38] was also chosen by god
[33:42] but his name
[33:44] was not recorded
[33:46] in
[33:47] the book of life
[33:50] now
[33:50] i want you to see here my friends
[33:55] that the choosing doesn't mean like the
[33:58] election of the bride of christ or the
[34:03] believer it's similar to the lying
[34:06] spirit
[34:09] that went up before god
[34:12] and had the job to come and lie on the
[34:15] earth
[34:16] and god
[34:17] permitted him
[34:19] to come on the earth as a liar
[34:22] to come on the earth as an enticer a
[34:25] tempter an accuser
[34:28] god permitted that spirit that anointed
[34:31] judas
[34:33] to come up on the earth get in him
[34:36] and to steal
[34:38] and to lie and to cheat and to sell out
[34:43] jesus
[34:44] but at the same time he was performing
[34:47] miracles
[34:50] you read many stories of such situation
[34:53] men claiming to be men of god
[34:56] committing all matter of whoredoms
[34:59] all manner of drunkenness rivalry
[35:02] all manner of uh bigamy all of every
[35:06] unspeakable crime and evil that you
[35:09] could think about
[35:11] oh my friends
[35:14] the spirit of judas
[35:16] is still prevalent
[35:18] in the world today
[35:20] it's only that that is not here in the
[35:23] person of judas the man walking around
[35:27] and jesus is not here in the person of
[35:30] christ as the man jesus walking around
[35:34] but jesus is here in the form of the
[35:37] word of god
[35:39] being revealed to you
[35:41] and judah's spirit is here as a
[35:44] supplanter of the word of god yes
[35:50] judas was also chosen
[35:53] and his name
[35:56] was recorded in heaven
[36:00] but the bible tells us his name was
[36:03] blotted out
[36:05] or removed
[36:07] from heaven he was never saved to begin
[36:11] with
[36:13] he was always lost to begin with
[36:17] it's just that for that job
[36:20] his name was recorded and he had to come
[36:23] to earth and do the job that he did
[36:28] separately and differently
[36:31] his experience and his walk
[36:35] is far removed from that of the elect
[36:38] bride of jesus christ
[36:43] for if
[36:44] one is a part of that bride
[36:47] it means you were also chosen by god
[36:52] but you were chosen with a different uh
[36:56] purpose
[36:58] for in every house there are various
[37:00] vessels
[37:02] some to honor some to dishonor
[37:05] amen and here uh this group of people
[37:10] elected before the foundation of the
[37:13] world
[37:14] their names recorded in the lamb's book
[37:16] of life before the foundation of the
[37:20] world to do what
[37:22] to love him
[37:24] to serve him
[37:26] that there will be on the people on the
[37:28] earth to worship him to never deny him
[37:33] to never walk away from him
[37:36] never to sell him out but to stand by
[37:40] the word of god all the time amen and
[37:44] hold to his unchanging hand and as we
[37:48] were elected and i believe
[37:50] that i am part of that i believe it in
[37:54] the depths of my heart elected to carry
[37:57] out god's plan and god's eternal
[38:00] purposes here on the earth and thank god
[38:05] we were chosen
[38:07] but we were chosen in him
[38:11] before the foundation of the world
[38:14] hallelujah in other words when
[38:17] jesus
[38:20] the word came forth we were already in
[38:23] him
[38:24] so we were part of the word
[38:27] that judas was going to plot against
[38:30] that judas was going to sell out
[38:33] even you will be sold out
[38:36] yes
[38:37] plotted against sold out evil spoken of
[38:41] oh a false witness is born against him
[38:45] but yet
[38:46] oh
[38:48] jesus was god expressed on the earth and
[38:52] now we were in him from before the
[38:56] foundation of the world as paul said
[38:59] ephesians in the book of ephesians we
[39:02] were
[39:02] chosen in him praise god and our names
[39:08] in that lamb's book of life
[39:11] as the prophet of this 20th century said
[39:15] who their names under no circumstances
[39:20] can their names be removed from out of
[39:25] that book oh praise god hallelujah what
[39:29] a blessing to know
[39:32] that our names are in the book
[39:35] and that our names can never
[39:38] be removed from that book amen
[39:42] hallelujah
[39:44] think of it
[39:45] what
[39:46] kind of destructive
[39:48] religious influence
[39:50] was upon judas
[39:53] that he would be the way even though he
[39:55] would heal the sick cast out devils
[39:58] religious go to church
[40:00] hear every sermon that jesus preached
[40:04] and never rep
[40:07] repent of his sins
[40:09] never was able to give his life to
[40:12] christ because the seed in him
[40:15] amen
[40:17] was not of god to begin with that seed
[40:21] in him
[40:22] was sent down here for a for a different
[40:26] purpose
[40:27] it was a vessel of dishonor my friend oh
[40:32] and so
[40:33] as the scripture says
[40:35] uh the apostle said he was numbered with
[40:40] us
[40:42] and obtained a part of this ministry
[40:46] in other words
[40:48] when judas was in
[40:50] jesus church
[40:52] he had a genuine
[40:55] walk
[40:56] he had a part of the genuine ministry
[41:00] anointing upon him
[41:02] and he was numbered with them hallelujah
[41:08] oh my
[41:09] and the part that he had was not
[41:12] inferior to the others it's just what he
[41:15] did with it it is motive of what he did
[41:19] with it
[41:20] amen acts 1 25
[41:25] that he may take part of this ministry
[41:32] and the apostleship
[41:34] oh
[41:35] being called an apostle or a being a
[41:39] preacher does not make one immune
[41:43] because those devils are looking in
[41:46] every way to influence
[41:49] any
[41:50] man
[41:52] that claims the name of christ
[41:55] amen
[41:57] that he may take part of this ministry
[41:59] an apostleship from which judas
[42:03] by transgression
[42:05] fell
[42:07] fell from heaven fell to earth fell to
[42:09] the earth and fell from the earth into
[42:12] hell but the bible tells us by
[42:16] transgression fell
[42:18] that he might go to his own place
[42:23] amen
[42:25] whoa
[42:26] he went to his own place
[42:29] because in the body of christ there was
[42:32] no place found for him
[42:34] he could not fit in any part of that
[42:37] body
[42:38] and so he had to go to his own place
[42:43] judas
[42:45] was a devil
[42:47] and he was lost
[42:49] he was never born again
[42:52] never a son of god
[42:55] but a son of perdition
[42:58] yes
[42:59] he had a real god-given
[43:03] anointed ministry upon him like many
[43:06] ministers today
[43:08] amen
[43:09] we will speak on that uh at another time
[43:13] of how the rain falls on the weeds as
[43:16] well as on the the good grain of wheat
[43:20] so
[43:21] the rainfall doesn't change the nature
[43:25] of the of the weed
[43:27] it remains a weed and so there are many
[43:31] preachers out there many with the
[43:33] anointing of the holy ghost gifts of the
[43:36] spirit and yet a devil and lost and held
[43:41] bound and my friends and have their own
[43:45] place reserved for them yes sir you know
[43:50] judas killed himself
[43:53] he
[43:54] committed suicide
[43:57] and went to his own place
[44:00] and his name
[44:02] was even
[44:05] in the book of life
[44:08] his name was even in the book of life
[44:12] but the scriptures record but his name
[44:16] was blotted out
[44:19] here ends our study for tonight
[44:22] may the lord take these few words
[44:26] of truth
[44:27] and plant them place them within your
[44:31] heart
[44:32] and raise a flag of victory and
[44:34] salvation that you will commit your life
[44:38] to christ
[44:39] that your works
[44:41] may be seen
[44:42] recorded
[44:44] in heaven
[44:46] and that god
[44:47] will recognize you
[44:51] that you were chosen in him
[44:54] come to him now
[44:56] speak to him from the depths of your
[44:59] heart
[45:00] ask god to forgive you cleanse you wash
[45:02] you in his precious cleansing blood
[45:07] and seek out
[45:08] one that will baptize you correctly
[45:12] in the name of jesus christ
[45:15] not in not in vague titles
[45:19] such as father son and holy ghost for
[45:22] their titles
[45:23] it's in the bible in one name the name
[45:28] of the father and of the son and of the
[45:30] holy ghost one name and so here we go my
[45:34] friends that that name peter said in
[45:36] acts 2 38 is the name of jesus christ
[45:40] which is correct scriptural christian
[45:44] baptism may god bless you
[45:47] may god save you baptize you
[45:50] and may we be able to welcome you
[45:53] into the kingdom of almighty god but
[45:57] without
[45:58] our dogs hormones
[46:01] witchcraft workers
[46:03] liars
[46:04] and blasphemers coffers mockers
[46:08] and those who my friends will make fun
[46:12] of the people of god and the things of
[46:14] god while we stand looking for his re
[46:18] return and holding to his unchanging
[46:21] hand may god bless those of you who are
[46:24] who believe
[46:26] and whose names are written in the
[46:31] heavens
[46:32] chosen in him
[46:34] may god bless you and keep you will come
[46:37] again on sunday again pray for me that
[46:41] god will send to us another message that
[46:46] will speak to our hearts
[46:48] and change us
[46:50] and get us pressurized and ready for our
[46:53] trip into glory god bless you
[46:56] amen
[46:58] [Music]
[47:31] you
