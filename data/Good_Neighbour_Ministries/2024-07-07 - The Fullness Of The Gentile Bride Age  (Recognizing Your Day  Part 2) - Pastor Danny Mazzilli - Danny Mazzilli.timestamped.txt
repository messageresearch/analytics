[7:48] ago this lady was not easy to work with
[7:51] she's one you know people have all kinds
[7:53] of issues and stuff she had all kinds of
[7:55] issues somehow I got into her good books
[7:58] a little bit and and uh and she started
[8:00] to she liked me and that's maybe that's
[8:03] not easy to do for some people right
[8:05] especially me but uh anyway so she
[8:07] started telling me about her family
[8:09] situation and she said she said uh you
[8:12] know she she's my husb my husband she
[8:15] has two daughters from a previous
[8:17] relationship she says but I have I've
[8:19] never been able to have a
[8:20] child and now she was 39 years old 40
[8:24] years old and she says I'm never going
[8:25] to be able to have a child and I'd say
[8:27] Angela I said wait a minute
[8:29] Naturally Speaking she tried everything
[8:33] I said that might be right but I said
[8:36] there is a God who can give you a child
[8:39] amen right and it's the god of the Bible
[8:41] make no mistake about it it's not the
[8:42] god of Hindu or it's the Lord Jesus he
[8:45] can give it to you we had this
[8:47] conversation two or three times and I
[8:49] kept on saying
[8:50] Angela the Lord Jesus Christ of the
[8:53] Bible can give you a child and as a
[8:55] matter of fact I said I'm going to ask
[8:58] him I said one day I'm going to ask him
[9:01] if he if he'll do that for you she okay

[24:22] little bit late but if uh if if God will
[24:26] just give us patience this morning

[24:29] many want to have a good time in the

[24:35] long
[24:36] time let's enjoy it amen God bless you
[24:38] Sister after this we'll take up the
[24:40] offering thank you my precious brother
[24:43] God bless you Fain and funny that he
[24:45] should say that um that we're not here
[24:48] for a long time because uh that is
[24:50] partly what has prompted the inspiration
[24:52] for the special because um for those of
[24:56] you who don't know we know a lot of
[24:57] visitors we have a lot of new Believers
[24:59] so I'll share a little bit not too long
[25:02] but I'll share a little bit that it was
[25:04] exactly nine years ago today that the
[25:07] Lord Jesus called my late husband and
[25:09] the father of our dear children brother
[25:11] Daniel Omari to Glory he came into his
[25:14] natural Perfection right and he was
[25:17] changed his robes right and he was
[25:21] graduated and so so much of what I
[25:24] wanted to share before singing the song
[25:27] the Lord has already ministered it so I
[25:28] won't reiterate but I'll refer to it
[25:31] just briefly by saying even in that song
[25:33] Right changeing ropes and how the Lord's
[25:35] ministering our needs and you know
[25:38] brother Chris when he talked about the
[25:40] storm and that 90 95% is destroyed it
[25:44] caused me that's what I was going to
[25:46] share that in that moment if you've ever
[25:47] lost a spouse or any close family member
[25:50] immediately your life changes overnight
[25:52] and you literally feel like a storm has
[25:54] passed through and you're hanging on by
[25:56] that 5% that's remaining and that you
[25:59] know if the Lord Jesus who is underneath
[26:01] that other our Rock and our foundation
[26:03] and and then he mentioned how much the
[26:05] Lord cares for all of our needs and
[26:07] that's exactly what the song is about
[26:09] and so you know especially when we come
[26:11] to this time of year our children and I
[26:13] are always in reflection and not only in
[26:15] commemoration and in honor of his life
[26:17] and his legacy and everything that he
[26:18] meant to us and how much we love and
[26:20] still myth him you know even though the
[26:22] Lord has blessed me to be remarried but
[26:24] you know you still you never forget the
[26:26] day when you've lost that person who
[26:28] you're significant to you and so
[26:31] yesterday I was just worshiping Mee in
[26:32] the garden and working and this song
[26:35] about the thinging I've loved it I've
[26:36] known it for so many years I've always
[26:37] loved it and I was just crying out to
[26:39] the Lord and singing on to the Lord and
[26:41] then he dropped it into my spirit to
[26:42] share it with you today so I pray that

[45:14] has Faith to get out of the way and to
[45:17] know that you're you're the you're the
[45:19] one that comes that's the that's the
[45:21] supernatural um element about preaching
[45:24] that makes it so so wonderful Lord is is
[45:27] that you can come and you can step in at
[45:29] any time and speak to the needs of your
[45:31] people and so that excites us this
[45:34] morning Lord people that are assembled

[46:02] father in the name of Jesus Christ and
[46:05] may you take your people and take us
[46:07] into Heavenly places in Jesus name amen
[46:11] praise God let's read our scripture this
[46:14] morning acts 13:
[46:17] 46-49 then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold
[46:21] and said it was necessary that the word
[46:24] of God should first have been spoken to
[46:27] you now they were they were ministering
[46:29] to the Jews it was the Jews that that
[46:32] you know that that the word was to come
[46:34] to but remember they didn't receive it
[46:38] and to this very day they still haven't
[46:40] recognized that Jesus was the Messiah
[46:43] but they will should first have been
[46:46] spoken to you but seeing you put it from
[46:49] you and judge yourselves Unworthy of
[46:53] everlasting life Lo we turn to the
[46:57] Gentiles for so hath the Lord commanded
[47:00] us saying I have set thee to be a light
[47:05] of the Gentiles that thou should us be
[47:08] for salvation unto the ends of the Earth
[47:12] and when the Gentiles heard this they
[47:14] were glad and glorified the word of the
[47:18] Lord and as many as were ordained to
[47:22] eternal life
[47:24] believed I'm going to read that again
[47:26] and as as many as were ordained to
[47:30] eternal life they
[47:32] believed because they were ordained to
[47:36] it it wasn't something that that they
[47:39] chaned upon you didn't chance upon this
[47:42] message you didn't chance upon the word
[47:45] for your day you didn't chance upon what
[47:48] God is what the Lord Jesus Christ is
[47:50] doing in
[47:52] 2024 it's because you're ordained to
[47:55] ites and you will hear it and you will
[47:58] receive it and they were ordained to
[48:00] eternal life believed and the word of
[48:03] the Lord was published throughout all
[48:06] the
[48:06] region may the Lord add His blessings to
[48:09] the word of God you may be
[48:12] seated what a wonderful thing that you
[48:16] know I mean it's it's almost a paradox
[48:18] Saints to know that you know the world
[48:21] is in such turmoil right now and you
[48:24] know it the the whole Focus you turn on
[48:27] the news and you look you know and
[48:29] you're going to see something there
[48:31] about what's going on in the Middle East
[48:34] it all surrounds Israel and it's
[48:37] bringing in all the nations all the
[48:40] nations are being brought into the whole
[48:43] picture here and yet here we are today
[48:46] you know knowing the history behind it
[48:50] that there's a that there's a history
[48:52] behind it all and that God has a purpose
[48:55] behind the whole whole plan of Israel
[48:58] and yet here we just read that you know
[49:01] that that when Jesus Christ the Messiah
[49:03] came to the Earth they were
[49:06] blinded so
[49:08] that Gentiles
[49:11] pagans you and me could receive the word
[49:16] of God could be grafted in to the plan
[49:21] of God and you know that blindness is
[49:25] still in place today
[49:27] and because of that blindness they're in
[49:29] the condition that they're in and we're
[49:32] in the condition that we're in Christ
[49:35] has a church that is now being prepared
[49:40] and the Gentile age is coming to a
[49:44] completion and when this Gentile age
[49:47] comes into a completion it's because
[49:49] there's a church that has come into full
[49:54] maturity she comes to the full fullness
[49:57] of the Gentiles and that there's going
[49:59] to be a full Revelation to the Gentile
[50:03] bride in this age and so the Gentile
[50:09] church for this hour must come into a
[50:11] mature revelation of where she fits in
[50:16] the prophecy of God's
[50:19] word everything that we look
[50:22] at is
[50:24] prophecy there's nothing new Under the
[50:27] son Solomon said right there he said
[50:30] there's vanity of vanities man can try
[50:33] and become great he can make himself try
[50:36] to make himself a king or try to make
[50:39] himself one of the richest men on
[50:42] Earth and think that he's achieved it
[50:45] but there's nothing new Under the
[50:48] Sun listen Solomon Abraham David these
[50:52] were some of the richest there's nobody
[50:54] that even still to this day comes close
[50:58] to the wealth that God gave to them he
[51:02] told Abraham wherever you you you're
[51:04] your foot trods wherever your foot makes
[51:07] a footprint that property I give it unto
[51:11] you not only to you but I give it unto
[51:13] your children it's a promise that he
[51:16] made and here here we are in our day not
[51:21] realizing that that promise is to you
[51:24] it's to us for us to recognize that that
[51:28] we have been given this promise amen and
[51:32] where we fit into the prophecy of this
[51:35] day and so um we are at a time where
[51:41] where Christ is coming into the fullness
[51:44] of
[51:46] his ministry for this
[51:50] day now when we look at Israel you know
[51:53] I was reading some articles this morning
[51:56] you know Hezbollah the the the attacks
[51:59] that are taking place right now they're
[52:01] saying that things are really heating up
[52:04] it's it's you know like they're trying
[52:05] to they're trying to have a ceasefire
[52:08] they're trying to work it out the US is
[52:11] supporting a ceasefire you know
[52:13] Hezbollah and Hamas they want to cease
[52:16] fire but then if you if you look deeper
[52:19] into it all you start to see that they
[52:21] that both sides have conditions that are
[52:25] impossible
[52:27] and this is why they keep coming to the
[52:30] same place and the war just continues to
[52:33] go on and go on and go on is because
[52:36] God's prophecy was written before their
[52:42] ceasefires and so in order for anybody
[52:45] to really understand you know what's
[52:49] going on you need to recognize what the
[52:53] word of God says about Israel and about
[52:58] this war and how it's going to actually
[53:01] end it's not going to be the way people
[53:06] think it's going to be there have been
[53:08] other ceasefires in the past have they
[53:12] lasted no why because the prophecy says
[53:17] that it will end with a massive
[53:22] Armageddon there's going to be a World
[53:24] War II I'm not here to bring the bad
[53:27] news okay I'm here to bring the good
[53:30] news amen but you see salvation has a
[53:34] purpose a lot of people say well you
[53:37] know you're just speaking about doomsday
[53:38] and you're talking about hell and fire
[53:41] no we're not we're telling you that
[53:43] those things are going to happen
[53:45] according to the word of God but we're
[53:47] here to announce and proclaim the good
[53:49] news amen that salvation is for you that
[53:53] if you accept Jesus Christ as your son
[53:56] Savior and your Redeemer then you will
[54:00] not have to face what the world is
[54:03] inevitably going to face you can't
[54:06] change it I can't change it it's
[54:09] biblical prophecy it must come to pass
[54:15] and so there's not so all we can do is
[54:18] try and discover and find out where do
[54:21] we fit in and how do we bypass this
[54:25] Armageddon this World War II that is
[54:28] going to strike the Earth with or
[54:31] without your consent that's right you
[54:34] know a lot of uh Nations United Nations
[54:38] and and you know leaders they're coming
[54:40] together and they're trying to use their
[54:42] own wisdom and their own understanding
[54:44] of how they're going to work everything
[54:46] out and how they're going to bring about
[54:48] a ceasefire and how they're going to
[54:49] bring about peace in the world yes there
[54:52] is going to come another peace peace and
[54:56] things are going to look like
[54:57] everything's going to be fine but
[54:59] scripturally it says that that piece is
[55:01] not going to last very long could that
[55:05] happen after the November elections when
[55:08] the new you know president comes into
[55:10] the United States that's another thing
[55:13] remember Bible prophecy the United
[55:16] States is in Bible prophecy they're a
[55:19] part of the whole picture and everything
[55:22] that you see now that's taking place it
[55:25] just goes to show show you that we're at
[55:27] the end because you've got governments
[55:30] you've got Democrat Republican you've
[55:33] got liberal you've got conservative and
[55:35] they're all in a state of confusion and
[55:38] the people are literally not it's no
[55:41] longer something where they come in and
[55:43] they they debate and they and they
[55:46] discuss and they come to a reasoning of
[55:48] you know what is best for the nation
[55:51] what we should do that's better no now
[55:54] it's like they're firing at one another
[55:56] they're they're they're uh they're you
[55:58] know uh being bold and rude and and and
[56:02] saying things it's it's like Words of
[56:06] War within the
[56:09] nation so the Bible says how can how can
[56:14] two walk together lest they agree there
[56:17] is Absol it's like night and day
[56:19] Republican and Democrat how is that all
[56:23] all of a sudden going to fix itself it's
[56:25] not it goes to show you that we are in
[56:28] the last days of even
[56:32] government Jesus said there will be a
[56:35] government upon my shoulders and there
[56:38] will be peace on Earth for 1,000 years
[56:42] that is going to be the next major event
[56:46] after the Rapture of the
[56:49] church okay remember it's only what like
[56:53] here here's the scripture 2
[56:55] Thessalonians 2:7 for the mystery of
[56:58] iniquity doth already work only he who
[57:02] now lth will let until he be taken out
[57:07] of the way to let
[57:10] means
[57:11] God is still here Christ and his church
[57:17] are still here on the earth and because
[57:21] we are still here prior to the Rapture
[57:25] it's keep keeping things at
[57:28] Bay okay it's keeping everything in its
[57:31] in its kind of like a like a
[57:34] controlled uh uh you know uh confusion
[57:38] controlled confusion all right because
[57:41] you've got Russia you've got Ukraine
[57:44] you've got uh GA Gaza you've got
[57:47] Hezbollah you've got things going on in
[57:49] Lebanon you've got Iran you all this war
[57:53] and anger and hatred and people wanting
[57:57] to destroy one another you know wanting
[58:00] to see people die and and get killed
[58:04] it's evil and if that gets fully loosed
[58:08] it's going to turn into Armageddon and
[58:10] that's what it eventually but you're
[58:12] still here right Christ is still here he
[58:15] is still here on the Earth but when the
[58:17] Holy Spirit leaves the Earth in the
[58:21] Rapture of the church and it and those
[58:24] which are alive and remain get caught up
[58:27] together to meet the Lord in the air for
[58:30] that three and a half year
[58:33] honeymoon this world goes into three and
[58:36] a half years of total tribulation that's
[58:42] right wow what a time in Daniel go to
[58:46] the next scripture in Daniel
[58:50] 12 verse one it says and there shall be
[58:53] a time of trouble such as never was
[58:56] since there was a nation even to that
[59:00] same time and at that time thy people
[59:05] shall be delivered
[59:07] everyone that shall be found written in
[59:12] the
[59:13] book aren't you glad that your name was
[59:17] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[59:20] Hallelujah you know because the
[59:23] world we're in a time of trouble
[59:26] and it's a time of trouble like never
[59:28] before sure we've had world wars World
[59:31] War I World War II and we saw just a
[59:34] touch of what nuclear power can do in
[59:37] World War II and it was total
[59:40] devastation now we've got Nations that
[59:44] are loaded with nuclear
[59:47] nukes and and a lot of them that are
[59:50] that are radar and and have GPS's
[59:54] pointing to every major city in North
[59:58] America and every major city in Russia
[1:00:02] and Europe and and all over the place
[1:00:04] can you imagine if a few of those get
[1:00:07] released it's not going to be fun here
[1:00:09] on the earth this is a time like never
[1:00:13] before they're putting nukes into the
[1:00:16] sky now they're saying that Russia is
[1:00:19] putting them into space so that they can
[1:00:21] be uh released right from space and sent
[1:00:25] wherever they want to send
[1:00:27] them if they've created the technology
[1:00:30] it's because they want to use the
[1:00:32] technology that's right it's just a
[1:00:34] matter of time when he that lets he
[1:00:38] that's he that's preventing CU right now
[1:00:42] letting means to
[1:00:44] prevent that's what scripturally it
[1:00:47] means he's preventing this whole thing
[1:00:49] to fall into total chaos and allow the
[1:00:52] Earth to go into total tribulation and
[1:00:54] and World War III
[1:00:56] but he's holding it back why for
[1:01:07] you this is going to be a very
[1:01:09] Troublesome
[1:01:11] time in the tribulation time God will
[1:01:14] turn to the
[1:01:17] Jews the Lord is already starting to
[1:01:22] focus and at any time in the very near
[1:01:26] future Moses and Elijah Moses and Elijah
[1:01:31] they were the two main prophets to the
[1:01:35] children of
[1:01:36] Israel and scripturally prophesied that
[1:01:40] they will rise
[1:01:41] again and they will be the ones that
[1:01:44] will go and bring this message this very
[1:01:48] message that that that we've been
[1:01:50] preaching here for for so many years
[1:01:52] because God sent us an Elijah to the
[1:01:55] Gentile bride Lord to turn us back to
[1:01:59] the word of God and we've been blessed
[1:02:02] by that by that Gentile Prophet William
[1:02:05] Branham and the ministry that God
[1:02:07] ordained for this 20th century to
[1:02:10] receive the word of God you know we talk
[1:02:13] of William Branham and I want you to
[1:02:15] know that we talk to him as a as a
[1:02:18] reformer not just as a reformer but as
[1:02:21] an actual Prophet because he had thus
[1:02:24] sayeth the Lord he had a prophetic word
[1:02:27] for the Gentile
[1:02:29] dispensation Martin Luther was also a
[1:02:32] reformer many talk about him John Wesley
[1:02:35] was also a reformer the Pentecostal
[1:02:38] movement was was a restoration of the
[1:02:41] gifts where the spirit of God came into
[1:02:43] isua Street to restore the gifts but yet
[1:02:47] God himself wanted to bring a prophetic
[1:02:51] word to the Gentile churches that were
[1:02:53] in a state of confusion because you got
[1:02:56] Christianity and you've got thousands of
[1:02:58] different denominations how do you know
[1:03:00] what to believe how do you know which
[1:03:03] Christian Church is the right
[1:03:05] Church well if if time prevails at some
[1:03:09] point they're going to realize that
[1:03:10] William brandham was sent from God he
[1:03:13] was a reformer just like Luther that
[1:03:15] caught the Revelation that the just
[1:03:17] shall live by faith and broke away from
[1:03:19] the Catholic church and started the
[1:03:22] Protestant churches it was a part of the
[1:03:24] restoration of the TRU true church it
[1:03:27] had to come away from organized religion
[1:03:30] you can't organize God you can't
[1:03:33] organize the Holy Ghost he's a living
[1:03:35] mystical body and he he's he's alive and
[1:03:38] well and he wants you to know it he
[1:03:41] wants you to know that you're in the
[1:03:43] body of Christ and
[1:03:46] so Israel is going to receive their two
[1:03:51] prophets now let's go to the next slide
[1:03:54] Romans
[1:03:57] chapter 11: 25 and this is just a real
[1:03:59] quick recap for I would not Brethren
[1:04:01] that you should be ignorant of this
[1:04:03] mystery lest you should be wise in your
[1:04:06] own conceits that blindness in part is
[1:04:10] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[1:04:14] the Gentiles become in and this is what
[1:04:18] we're talking about today we're we're
[1:04:20] coming into the
[1:04:22] fullness if there was ever a time where
[1:04:24] the word of God was coming coming into
[1:04:26] its fullness and there would be a church
[1:04:29] that would be mature and ready to to to
[1:04:33] be translated in this hour it's now it's
[1:04:36] right now this Gentile dispensation is
[1:04:39] coming to an end an end means it's it's
[1:04:42] coming to its fullness all right and
[1:04:45] listen to brother brandham here he says
[1:04:48] here um you can go to the next slide he
[1:04:50] says recognizing your day and its
[1:04:52] message he says you know the Jews were
[1:04:55] blinded for the very purpose that we
[1:04:59] could have
[1:05:00] sight they were torn apart scattered as
[1:05:04] a nation and rejected their Messiah that
[1:05:08] we might receive the Messiah that there
[1:05:11] might be a people called out of the
[1:05:14] Gentiles for his name's sake look now
[1:05:19] the man comes forth and the woman takes
[1:05:22] his
[1:05:23] name these blinded gentiles who can't
[1:05:26] see that name the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:05:31] baptism it's just too bad you see like
[1:05:35] like just how simple that is that that
[1:05:37] you know you talk to somebody about the
[1:05:39] word of God and you talk to them about
[1:05:42] salvation and acts 238 said repent and
[1:05:45] be
[1:05:46] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:49] Christ it's a perfect type of a man and
[1:05:52] a woman when a man and a woman get
[1:05:55] married the woman takes his name that's
[1:05:59] just known and here you know when when
[1:06:05] Christ comes into your life you take his
[1:06:08] name in baptism you you bury the old
[1:06:11] life in water baptism and you are raised
[1:06:14] up in the newness of life and now you've
[1:06:18] taken the name of your husband which is
[1:06:21] Christ okay the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:06:25] baptism is just too bad but it has to be
[1:06:29] that
[1:06:30] way the Jews they had they had to not
[1:06:35] see
[1:06:36] that there is only one can see it that's
[1:06:39] the one who is predestinated to see it
[1:06:43] remember we said at the beginning you've
[1:06:44] got to be ordained to this
[1:06:47] message it's not for everybody so don't
[1:06:50] try to don't try to convert
[1:06:53] people you know it's God is the one who
[1:06:58] births them gives them a new birth
[1:07:01] that's the true conversion it's it's the
[1:07:05] Born Again experience not being somebody
[1:07:08] that's religious we are not religious
[1:07:11] people say oh you're so religious no
[1:07:13] we're not
[1:07:14] religious we are
[1:07:16] Christians we've received the spirit of
[1:07:19] Christ and when the spirit of Christ
[1:07:22] comes in you it reads the the word it
[1:07:26] understands the word and he said he said
[1:07:30] that repent be baptized this is unto you
[1:07:34] and to your children and to as many as
[1:07:36] the Lord Our God calls amen you got to
[1:07:41] read all the
[1:07:43] scripture my sheep he didn't say all
[1:07:47] sheep he says the Sheep No he said my
[1:07:51] sheep you see we've got to take the word
[1:07:54] for what it says says my sheep hear my
[1:07:58] voice and another they will not follow
[1:08:01] so it's ordained for you because in you
[1:08:05] is a part of God from before the
[1:08:09] foundations of this
[1:08:10] world like job says where were you when
[1:08:13] the sons of God rejoiced together around
[1:08:17] the Throne of
[1:08:18] God where were you if you were there and
[1:08:22] you're now here having come through a
[1:08:25] spiritual Amnesia into a human body when
[1:08:29] that word is flashed before you in this
[1:08:33] way and somebody says you need to be
[1:08:36] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:38] Christ and you look at the word and you
[1:08:41] say yep that's exactly how 3,000 were
[1:08:43] baptized on the day of
[1:08:46] Pentecost and oh there's Phillip he
[1:08:49] baptized the unic and oh he baptized
[1:08:51] them in the name of Jesus Christ oh and
[1:08:54] there's Paul in Acts 19 and there he is
[1:08:57] and he comes across a bunch of disciples
[1:08:59] you know other Christians in his day
[1:09:02] remember we are an extension of the book
[1:09:03] of Acts if people ask you what do you
[1:09:06] you know what's your church all about
[1:09:08] just tell them read the book of Acts
[1:09:10] what you see in the book of Acts you
[1:09:12] will see in our church you see baptism
[1:09:14] in jesus' name that's how we baptize you
[1:09:17] see uh you know foot washing you see the
[1:09:21] Lord's Supper that's how we do it it's
[1:09:24] it's just the word
[1:09:25] being displayed and Paul he comes across
[1:09:29] a bunch of disciples that were
[1:09:30] Christians and they were rejoicing and
[1:09:32] Paul comes to them he says whoa whoa
[1:09:34] whoa whoa he says unto what were you
[1:09:38] baptized I can see that you're excited
[1:09:42] you can talk to a lot of people you can
[1:09:43] go to listen there's there's Christian
[1:09:46] camps going on right now there's Revival
[1:09:48] meetings going on right now and you can
[1:09:51] go in there and you can pull somebody
[1:09:53] aside and they're rejoicing and it's
[1:09:55] good that they're rejoicing about the
[1:09:56] word of God but if the spirit of the
[1:09:59] Holy Ghost is inside of them if Christ
[1:10:02] is in them there's no way it'll reject
[1:10:04] the word it can't deny the word okay
[1:10:08] it's just doesn't make sense and so if
[1:10:11] if you say to them like Paul did in Acts
[1:10:14] 19 he says how were you baptized unto
[1:10:18] what and they turn around and says well
[1:10:20] we got baptized by John the
[1:10:22] Baptist oh so your disciples of John the
[1:10:26] Baptist just like today you know you
[1:10:28] talk to people and you say what do you
[1:10:32] believe we believe the message of
[1:10:34] William
[1:10:35] brandham I so okay that's good but how
[1:10:38] were you
[1:10:41] baptized
[1:10:43] oh we were baptized you know there's
[1:10:46] people that baptize in the name of
[1:10:47] William brandham that's nonsense that's
[1:10:50] absolute nonsense because they don't
[1:10:52] have a
[1:10:53] revelation that the relationship is with
[1:10:56] Jesus Christ it's not with a man it was
[1:10:59] never a relationship with Moses Moses's
[1:11:02] arms were held up so that the people
[1:11:05] could look unto the
[1:11:07] Lord his countenance was shining with
[1:11:10] the countenance of the Lord the word
[1:11:12] that he brought was not thus saith Moses
[1:11:15] Pharaoh set my people free he said thus
[1:11:19] sayeth the Lord set my people free and
[1:11:24] so people need to recognize just like in
[1:11:26] Acts 19 how unto what were you
[1:11:30] baptized and they'll turn around and say
[1:11:32] well I was baptized uh you know unto
[1:11:34] John the Baptist he says you need to be
[1:11:37] re-baptized you need the baptism of
[1:11:40] Jesus Christ you need to receive him not
[1:11:45] William brandom you once you've got him
[1:11:50] you'll recognize where William brandom
[1:11:52] fits into the scripture and that he was
[1:11:53] the prophet of Malachi 45
[1:11:55] he was the angel of Revelations 10 1-7
[1:11:59] the messenger of that you'll see all of
[1:12:01] that you'll see the ministry being
[1:12:03] fulfilled
[1:12:05] clearly but you will still look to the
[1:12:08] word and you will recognize that it's
[1:12:11] Christ in the present stage of his
[1:12:14] ministry and that is what you will
[1:12:17] follow that is what is going to Quicken
[1:12:20] you for the body
[1:12:23] change and so
[1:12:25] so there's only one can see it that's
[1:12:29] the one who is predestinated to see it
[1:12:31] otherwise you'll never see it the Jews
[1:12:35] could not see that being their Messiah
[1:12:38] and yet they were Scholars theologians
[1:12:41] men of great renowned scholarship read
[1:12:45] the same Bible that you read now after
[1:12:48] it's been made known to us we can see it
[1:12:51] plain that was
[1:12:53] Messiah but they couldn't see it neither
[1:12:56] can they see it today there is a
[1:13:01] blindness that's coming now upon the
[1:13:05] Gentiles and not just now it's been on
[1:13:09] them for a long time but it's going to
[1:13:12] come to its
[1:13:14] fullness they're going to come into a
[1:13:16] full blindness and the Gentile
[1:13:20] dispensation and the age will be over if
[1:13:23] it's not already
[1:13:27] I'm not making any statements here I'm
[1:13:30] just telling you that God is is his own
[1:13:33] interpreter is God still calling yes he
[1:13:36] is God is still calling God is still
[1:13:39] perfecting but if your name was written
[1:13:42] in the Lamb's Book of Life from before
[1:13:44] the foundations of the world you're not
[1:13:48] new you're just coming into a
[1:13:51] realization of who you really are you
[1:13:54] always were a Son of God you don't come
[1:13:56] to an altar call and go back and say I
[1:13:59] just became a Christian if you are a
[1:14:02] Christian you always were a Christian
[1:14:05] but you didn't know you were a real
[1:14:08] Christian you didn't know that in you
[1:14:10] was an attribute a gene uh like a like a
[1:14:14] like a a a gene that that would
[1:14:17] connect perfectly with the word of God
[1:14:20] that it would that it would not deny the
[1:14:22] word of God that it would not that when
[1:14:24] when it would look at the word of God it
[1:14:26] it can't see three
[1:14:27] Gods it doesn't see three Gods it sees
[1:14:30] Jesus Christ the same yesterday the Lord
[1:14:33] today Jesus Christ and forever the
[1:14:37] kingdom of
[1:14:38] God it's always been the Lord one God
[1:14:43] you see everything becomes clear and so
[1:14:47] here he says but they couldn't see it
[1:14:49] neither can they see it today they are
[1:14:51] prophesied to be blinded
[1:14:55] two the church this day is prophesied to
[1:14:59] be blinded to reject the evening time
[1:15:03] message what is evening time it's the
[1:15:06] time where things kind of finish up
[1:15:10] right you know at the end of the day
[1:15:11] that's when you start to relax and you
[1:15:14] start to get ready to go to sleep so
[1:15:17] that you can start a brand new day well
[1:15:20] it's evening time now for the word of
[1:15:22] God to come into its fullness amen
[1:15:25] praise God and so as we continue here
[1:15:29] now we realize that uh Romans 11 you
[1:15:32] know was was for the purpose of showing
[1:15:35] when we read you know verses 25 and 26
[1:15:38] just as a recap it's it's God showing
[1:15:41] his sovereignty it's God showing that he
[1:15:43] knows about this blindness and he wants
[1:15:46] you to know about this blindness he
[1:15:49] wants you to know that it's not because
[1:15:51] of any good that you did don't puff
[1:15:53] yourself up oh God is with us you know
[1:15:56] God blinded them so that he could be
[1:15:58] with us because he wanted to be no this
[1:16:00] is all part of his sovereignty it's all
[1:16:02] part of his Plan of Redemption Israel is
[1:16:05] in the state that it's in because of
[1:16:07] God's
[1:16:08] word God's Sovereign word that's what
[1:16:11] put them into a a state of hardness
[1:16:15] against the word of God Amen okay
[1:16:18] they've they've come into that that you
[1:16:20] know to where they cannot recognize
[1:16:23] Messiah but it's because because God was
[1:16:25] coming to you the Gentiles to open your
[1:16:29] understanding their hardened to the
[1:16:31] understanding you've been awakened to
[1:16:33] the understanding and during your
[1:16:35] Awakening now the Gentile church is
[1:16:39] hardening and they are coming into the
[1:16:41] fullness of their point to where they
[1:16:44] just will not accept Jesus Christ
[1:16:47] they'll think they've accepted him
[1:16:49] they'll continue going to church
[1:16:51] believing in a trinity that's why on
[1:16:54] that day many are going to come to Jesus
[1:16:56] like the scripture says and said Lord
[1:16:58] have I not cast out devils in your name
[1:17:00] have I not prophesied in your name and
[1:17:02] he's going to look at them and said I
[1:17:04] never knew you well if you go back into
[1:17:07] the scriptures you'll see when when when
[1:17:09] when the scripture talks about knew you
[1:17:13] just like Adam knew his wife Adam was
[1:17:16] planting seed in the individual in the
[1:17:20] bride and in if you're the church then
[1:17:23] there's seed in you of Jesus Christ and
[1:17:26] that seed just like Mary when when when
[1:17:29] the angel Gabriel came to Mary and said
[1:17:32] you're going to bring forth a son and
[1:17:35] his name Shall be Called Jesus Christ
[1:17:37] she immediately said be it unto me
[1:17:41] according to your word and the moment
[1:17:43] she did that the word took an effect and
[1:17:47] when the word comes to you in your day
[1:17:50] like this message and you hear oh you
[1:17:53] know what's what's good neighbor laor
[1:17:55] Ministries preaching what's what's this
[1:17:57] message that they're preaching and when
[1:17:59] they take enough time to listen we're
[1:18:01] not preaching any kind of a cult or any
[1:18:04] kind of a you know uh our own
[1:18:07] interpretation on the word of God we're
[1:18:09] just preaching right from the word of
[1:18:10] God I'm reading scripture here and then
[1:18:13] I'm quoting a reformer that you can
[1:18:15] search yourself and check his ministry
[1:18:17] William brandom's Ministry was a
[1:18:20] worldwide
[1:18:22] Ministry it went across the world seven
[1:18:25] times there was testimony after
[1:18:28] testimony of what God did through that
[1:18:31] Ministry I don't have to get into it all
[1:18:34] it's all on Google you can research it
[1:18:37] yourself and then because there's a
[1:18:40] representation of the seed of God in you
[1:18:43] when you see it when you read it and
[1:18:46] then you line it with the word you see
[1:18:48] what he says you see what the word says
[1:18:51] and then you're you're either going to
[1:18:53] say
[1:18:55] no way I'm not accepting this or what
[1:18:59] this is just clear and simple I can see
[1:19:01] it
[1:19:02] clear and that's because you have
[1:19:05] representation thank you Jesus that's
[1:19:07] because you always were ordained to this
[1:19:12] time and this season and and this so
[1:19:15] happens to be the season of The Rapture
[1:19:18] so not only are you going to receive the
[1:19:20] message of this hour but you're going to
[1:19:23] receive super
[1:19:25] Supernatural word that is going to
[1:19:28] change your body it's literally going to
[1:19:30] change your body you know they're
[1:19:32] they're they're trying to tap into it
[1:19:34] now with science they're trying to you
[1:19:36] know artificial intelligence and and the
[1:19:39] power of this and dimensional uh you
[1:19:41] know they're they're already seeing that
[1:19:43] there's more than this Dimension they're
[1:19:45] breaking into that other dimension well
[1:19:48] that other dimension is just the other
[1:19:51] dimension that when we are changed in a
[1:19:53] moment in the twinkling of and I we are
[1:19:56] going to be instantly in that other
[1:19:58] dimension but when you pass through that
[1:20:01] curtain the difference is going to be
[1:20:03] that you pass through that curtain and
[1:20:06] you're going to have a brand new
[1:20:09] body this Mortal shall put on
[1:20:14] immortality if this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:20:17] be
[1:20:18] dissolved I have another one
[1:20:21] waiting it's called the theophany
[1:20:25] body brother William William Mary and
[1:20:28] brandham was given an opportunity to go
[1:20:31] beyond that curtain of time and there's
[1:20:34] been other people even on YouTube that
[1:20:36] have had that opportunity and have seen
[1:20:39] those young bodies have seen themselves
[1:20:42] young
[1:20:43] again in a body that doesn't age
[1:20:46] remember death in the Garden of Eden is
[1:20:50] what brought
[1:20:51] aging if it wasn't for death our bodies
[1:20:54] would never
[1:20:56] age time was introduced When Death was
[1:21:02] introduced because death brings time or
[1:21:06] time brings death you live so many years
[1:21:09] you die so that that change that we're
[1:21:12] looking forward to that we are that that
[1:21:15] that by the word of God and by the grace
[1:21:17] of God you didn't deserve it I didn't
[1:21:19] deserve it 30 years ago when this
[1:21:22] message crossed my path it wasn't just
[1:21:25] this you know I didn't know who William
[1:21:26] Brandon was I I didn't I didn't care I
[1:21:30] came into a a a personal relationship
[1:21:33] with with a a supernatural God that
[1:21:36] delivered me from a cocaine addiction
[1:21:38] that I thought was going to take my life
[1:21:40] and when that happened to me I was ready
[1:21:42] to give my life I I realized my God I'll
[1:21:45] do anything for this
[1:21:47] God because he's my savior amen I was
[1:21:52] ready to give up everything just like
[1:21:54] blind barus he was blind but man when
[1:21:58] Jesus come along and opened his eyes let
[1:22:00] me tell you he says listen the you know
[1:22:03] the priest came to him and talked to
[1:22:05] barus what are you what are you talking
[1:22:07] about how's how is it that you can see
[1:22:09] he says listen I don't know I've been
[1:22:12] going to your
[1:22:15] church years for I don't know how many
[1:22:18] years I've been going to this church
[1:22:20] that church I I've been trying self-help
[1:22:23] I've been trying everything possible but
[1:22:27] this
[1:22:29] Jesus he spoke one
[1:22:32] word and I'm
[1:22:34] delivered and all I know is that he is
[1:22:37] the Living
[1:22:39] God and once you meet this God you'll
[1:22:42] never be the same you can never ever be
[1:22:46] the same and don't worry no family
[1:22:48] member is going to convince you nobody's
[1:22:51] going to tell you oh listen you you know
[1:22:53] you know you know my wife would tell me
[1:22:55] that you know when I first came to the
[1:22:56] Lord I was so zealous my family was like
[1:22:59] like he he's lost it you know like he he
[1:23:02] he's he's lost it like like you know
[1:23:04] what he's going where he's going to go
[1:23:06] there and and they would call my wife
[1:23:07] and they would say listen you don't need
[1:23:09] to go to that church you don't need to
[1:23:12] be doing that just take it easy you just
[1:23:14] relax you let him go through the phase
[1:23:16] he's going through you know Danny he
[1:23:17] gets excited about stuff you know he
[1:23:20] goes he goes through things you know
[1:23:21] like one minute he's trying to sell you
[1:23:23] you know AC n and the next minute he's
[1:23:25] trying to sell you you know uh uh some
[1:23:28] some some good vitamins and then you
[1:23:30] know he gets excited about
[1:23:32] things but then five years later they
[1:23:35] what he's
[1:23:37] preaching thank you Jesus what preaching
[1:23:39] what Jesus
[1:23:42] Christ why because he changed
[1:23:46] him he's he can never be the same he's
[1:23:50] received a message that that blows every
[1:23:53] Church to denominational teaching New
[1:23:56] Age movement because it wasn't a
[1:24:00] teaching it was an
[1:24:02] experience it was a personal revelation
[1:24:06] of who God is and who you are who I am
[1:24:10] now I realize why I was the way that I
[1:24:13] was could never be satisfied so I had to
[1:24:15] go to the drugs to try to get a higher
[1:24:17] high it was constant it was because in
[1:24:21] in you there is something that you need
[1:24:23] to work worship you're going to worship
[1:24:26] something I'll tell you right now you're
[1:24:28] going to worship your golf game you're
[1:24:30] going to worship your sports team you're
[1:24:32] going to worship drugs you're going to
[1:24:34] worship alcohol you're going to worship
[1:24:37] idolatry you're going to worship
[1:24:39] adultery you're GNA something is going
[1:24:41] to get a hold of you that you're going
[1:24:42] to need to worship
[1:24:44] something but when Jesus Christ comes
[1:24:47] just like he came to the woman at the
[1:24:49] well she was a prostitute that right to
[1:24:52] that moment amen she was with a man
[1:24:55] right minutes before that she went to
[1:24:58] the well to get some water she had no
[1:25:01] idea that she was going to be meeting
[1:25:03] Jesus I had no idea after meeting
[1:25:05] brother Gabriel that I'd be meeting
[1:25:08] Jesus I had no idea when he picked me up
[1:25:10] in that van and there was a truck Lo a
[1:25:13] van full of people from the United
[1:25:15] Nations I had no idea where I was going
[1:25:18] and I thought oh my goodness I said what
[1:25:21] did I get into and my goodness let me
[1:25:25] tell you that woman at the well that
[1:25:28] night I was the woman at the well I was
[1:25:31] the one that he was talking to I was the
[1:25:34] one who was living a life of
[1:25:35] prostitution living a life that was
[1:25:38] absolutely worthy of
[1:25:40] hell but he had mercy amen he showed
[1:25:46] mercy and he's got Mercy for you this
[1:25:49] morning he's got Mercy for anybody out
[1:25:52] there that's listening in he will show
[1:25:55] you Mercy in the same way and I
[1:25:58] challenge you not not go to church I
[1:26:02] challenge you to go to your
[1:26:04] knees and and and say if you're listen
[1:26:07] that God that that that Danny there is
[1:26:10] talking about I I want to I want to know
[1:26:12] if he's a reality I want to I want to
[1:26:15] see if this God is is the is the Living
[1:26:17] God that he's talking about there's only
[1:26:20] one way that you can be convinced I can
[1:26:22] never convince you don't that's why say
[1:26:24] don't try to convince and push people to
[1:26:27] come to this or you got to believe that
[1:26:30] no when the spirit of God in his time
[1:26:34] Jesus said all that the father meaning
[1:26:37] all that I had originally planned when
[1:26:39] he's talking about the father he's
[1:26:41] talking about himself all that everyone
[1:26:45] that's in my
[1:26:46] hand he says I'll not lose one of them
[1:26:50] every one of them's got to come amen and
[1:26:53] when they come it's because I draw them
[1:26:57] I draw them by the word of God I draw
[1:27:00] them by by an understanding of the word
[1:27:03] that that they can't even understand why
[1:27:06] they're recognizing what they're hearing
[1:27:08] It's Supernatural it's called divine
[1:27:11] revelation Jesus said I'm going to build
[1:27:14] my church on that amen praise God and so
[1:27:20] Israel was hardened they were for that
[1:27:22] purpose now the Gentiles are going to in
[1:27:24] in direct relation as we come into our
[1:27:27] fullness the Gentile dispensation goes
[1:27:31] into total blindness that's why we had
[1:27:33] the signs in the in the moon and in the
[1:27:35] in the Sun that the world went into
[1:27:38] total darkness again just recently
[1:27:40] because that's not coincidence Saints
[1:27:44] God always shows his signs in the
[1:27:46] heavens and then declares it on the
[1:27:47] earth amen and so we know that this is
[1:27:51] all to come about for the purpose that
[1:27:53] he might glorify himself he might
[1:27:56] glorify his Integrity that he says
[1:27:59] listen this blindness is only temporary
[1:28:02] on on Israel I'm going to awaken them
[1:28:05] and they are going to come to know that
[1:28:07] I am their Messiah they're going to come
[1:28:08] into their fullness into their atonement
[1:28:11] into their day of Awakening where
[1:28:13] they're going to know it's going to be
[1:28:15] because I'm going to send them the the
[1:28:17] the two prophets Moses and Elijah we
[1:28:20] will not be here for that okay but they
[1:28:23] are going to have have a Great Awakening
[1:28:25] so that he can show his grace and his
[1:28:28] mercy and that it was extended to all
[1:28:32] who would
[1:28:35] accept
[1:28:37] Hallelujah listen here in the message
[1:28:40] Shalom you're not of the world Little
[1:28:44] Children You are of Heaven this is not
[1:28:48] your home why should I Look To Us older
[1:28:51] people try to look back and get Young
[1:28:54] again you know so many people are so
[1:28:55] worried about age if you're a
[1:28:58] Christian age is irrelevant to you
[1:29:02] really come on now death has no sting on
[1:29:06] a true Christian are you feeling the
[1:29:09] aches and pains yes I feel them every
[1:29:12] morning sometimes I need to take
[1:29:14] Tylenol just to settle the pains and the
[1:29:17] aches especially after playing golf the
[1:29:19] other day for the first
[1:29:21] time it's it's life in a human vessel
[1:29:26] okay age is a part of this human
[1:29:29] Dimension but don't be trying to change
[1:29:32] it don't be trying to get miserable
[1:29:34] about oh I gotta you know this I gotta
[1:29:36] eat you know do those things that are
[1:29:38] right but be
[1:29:39] joyful because if you're a joyful
[1:29:42] Christian you'll be a strong Christian
[1:29:44] amen because Joy is your strength like
[1:29:46] we were saying here on Wednesday night
[1:29:47] and we're looking for that hour pressing
[1:29:50] for it so many good sincere people today
[1:29:53] are are caught away in these Creeds
[1:29:56] these churches and organizations having
[1:29:59] a form of godliness but denying the
[1:30:01] power
[1:30:02] thereof as second Timothy the 3 chapter
[1:30:06] says gross Darkness blinding of Israel
[1:30:11] was for the lightning of the Gentiles
[1:30:14] not the blinding of the Gentiles is the
[1:30:17] lightning of
[1:30:20] Israel sorry now the blinding of the
[1:30:24] Gentiles is the lightning of Israel
[1:30:27] that's why when the Gentile bride that's
[1:30:30] fully
[1:30:32] awake is
[1:30:34] raptured they've come into their
[1:30:36] rapturing faith condition and they're
[1:30:39] taken the Gentile churches that are left
[1:30:42] on Earth here will go into total
[1:30:46] blindness and that will awaken
[1:30:49] Israel that's now the Gentile blindness
[1:30:53] to awaken Israel
[1:30:54] that's where we're at that's how close
[1:30:57] we are that's why when you you try to
[1:30:59] tell somebody about the word you just
[1:31:02] just believe the word look at the word
[1:31:05] Jesus was the word he was made flesh and
[1:31:07] he he walked amongst the people and only
[1:31:09] a dozen actually recognize he was the
[1:31:12] word the rest of them said crucify him
[1:31:14] get get rid of this guy he's a heretic
[1:31:17] he's causing trouble in the in in the in
[1:31:19] the
[1:31:20] churches you know they they'll say the
[1:31:22] same thing about us oh you're disturbing
[1:31:24] everybody you know you're disturbing the
[1:31:26] churches and you know you're telling
[1:31:27] them that they're wrong no we don't want
[1:31:29] to tell them that they're wrong we want
[1:31:30] to show them what the word says so that
[1:31:33] they can get right so that they can
[1:31:36] receive the word and receive this
[1:31:37] salvation that that he's making
[1:31:39] available in this hour and so just like
[1:31:44] now he says uh the blinding of the
[1:31:47] Gentiles is the lightning of Israel it's
[1:31:49] just like the day and night one side has
[1:31:53] got dark the other side has got light
[1:31:56] and then the light comes over on the
[1:31:58] other side like you know how the sun
[1:32:00] rises in the East Falls in the
[1:32:02] west well it's light in the morning over
[1:32:05] here but by the time it falls over here
[1:32:07] it's total darkness over here you see so
[1:32:10] the light is moving and it's going to be
[1:32:12] moving to Israel and there's going to be
[1:32:14] total darkness in the Gentile Church
[1:32:17] world Amen so the moon passing the way
[1:32:21] it did look it's right here in the quote
[1:32:23] he said says here he says it's uh so
[1:32:26] just like the day and night one side has
[1:32:29] got Darkness the other side has got
[1:32:31] light and then the light comes over on
[1:32:33] the other side so the moon passing the
[1:32:36] way it did and the reflection of the
[1:32:38] darkness of the world blinding out its
[1:32:42] light is a reflection to us that the
[1:32:45] Gentile Church age is finished that's
[1:32:49] what he says here this was back in 1964
[1:32:52] in the message shalom
[1:32:55] so remember you cannot add to the church
[1:32:59] God adds to the church okay and and all
[1:33:03] that those whose names were written in
[1:33:05] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:33:07] foundations of the world you can't add
[1:33:10] names to that
[1:33:11] book it's already written so so it's not
[1:33:16] oh my name was added to the book tonight
[1:33:19] because I went to the altar no it
[1:33:21] wasn't if your name was on the book it
[1:33:24] always
[1:33:26] was and you've come to a realization
[1:33:29] that you are a son or a daughter of God
[1:33:33] that's to receive this
[1:33:35] message and so that Darkness he says the
[1:33:39] Gentile Church age is finished the
[1:33:41] church is making herself ready being
[1:33:45] making herself ready for a time it's
[1:33:48] time for the
[1:33:50] Rapture for darkness is fading upon the
[1:33:54] Gentiles and Dawn will soon break upon
[1:33:58] the Jews the sun has faded the sorry the
[1:34:04] sun has traveled from east to west and
[1:34:07] we're on the west coast brother Brandon
[1:34:10] was talking about how you know there the
[1:34:12] you know the message came to to America
[1:34:15] and you can only go so far on the west
[1:34:18] coast to California and when you cross
[1:34:20] the ocean you're back in the East again
[1:34:22] and so he says here here he says we're
[1:34:24] on the west coast the light can only do
[1:34:27] one thing go back east and what's East
[1:34:31] Israel back to the Middle East on the
[1:34:35] other side you understand do you the
[1:34:38] light can only go back East again to
[1:34:40] where it began Israel got
[1:34:44] blinded them for a while but the
[1:34:46] darkness now is pressed upon the Gentile
[1:34:49] world that's covered the whole thing the
[1:34:53] G Gentiles will trod down Jerusalem
[1:34:56] until the Gentile dispensation will be
[1:34:59] finished Jesus said so and now it's
[1:35:02] finished gross Darkness upon the people
[1:35:06] God reflecting it in the skies as he has
[1:35:10] shown on Earth before it all happens he
[1:35:15] says we're in it Saints I'm telling you
[1:35:19] we're in it we're in that time of total
[1:35:24] blindness coming into the
[1:35:27] churches but rise and
[1:35:29] shine thy light has come the revelation
[1:35:33] of this word and this message has come
[1:35:37] to you Amen brother he says here in mark
[1:35:40] of the beast brother don't worry Gentile
[1:35:43] your days is just about over let me warn
[1:35:46] you in the name of the Lord the Gentile
[1:35:48] door is closing just as certain as I'm
[1:35:52] standing here Jesus Jesus said the
[1:35:55] muhammadans there would they there would
[1:35:58] tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem until
[1:36:00] the Gentile dispensation be finished and
[1:36:04] fulfilled there she is Israel in her
[1:36:07] Homeland a nation with her own Army her
[1:36:10] own money amen she's a full Nation now
[1:36:13] the fig trees putting forth its buds and
[1:36:17] already buted
[1:36:18] out Israel is in her Homeland and the
[1:36:22] muhammadans the the the the
[1:36:25] the all those Nations the the
[1:36:29] the they're surrounding
[1:36:32] Israel they're all the Muslim nations
[1:36:35] all the children of Ishmael all those
[1:36:38] that are claiming that Abraham was their
[1:36:40] father Yes Abraham was uh was was
[1:36:44] ishmael's father but Ishmael was not the
[1:36:47] promised son Isaac was the promised son
[1:36:50] you need to read your
[1:36:52] Bible you can never tell a Jew that that
[1:36:56] that the Muslims that they were given
[1:36:59] the promised land they were not given
[1:37:01] the promised land according to the word
[1:37:03] of God anybody can show me that in the
[1:37:06] word of God I'll believe you but it's
[1:37:08] not there it was given to the children
[1:37:11] of Israel and that's why Bible prophecy
[1:37:15] will override whatever anybody else is
[1:37:19] saying out there you can't override
[1:37:22] God's word he said heavens and Earth
[1:37:23] will pass away but not my word my word
[1:37:27] will come to pass and the promise was
[1:37:30] given that land was was given to Israel
[1:37:34] it was never promised to be split up I
[1:37:38] know they want to try and do that they
[1:37:40] have they have good
[1:37:41] intentions but they're going against
[1:37:44] Bible prophecy God's word you can't
[1:37:47] change that and that's why you know
[1:37:50] we're not here to to to to bash any
[1:37:53] anybody we feel for those Palestinians
[1:37:56] those children and those those women and
[1:37:59] and men that are being killed and that
[1:38:01] are being bombed and and anybody that's
[1:38:03] being hurt it's not right but how can
[1:38:07] you change War always brings pain it
[1:38:11] always brings
[1:38:13] death and it's an unfortunate thing amen
[1:38:16] praise God but you see Christ came and
[1:38:20] preached and prophesied just exactly
[1:38:22] three and a half half years and the
[1:38:25] daily sacrifice was taken away we're
[1:38:27] winding down here everything just as
[1:38:29] perfect as it could be and the mosque of
[1:38:32] Omar was built on the same grounds and
[1:38:35] stands there to this day and they will
[1:38:38] tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem until
[1:38:42] the Gentile dispensation would be
[1:38:45] finished the church is taken up the
[1:38:48] elect the bride out of there and the two
[1:38:53] Prophets Elijah Elijah and Moses turns
[1:38:56] to Israel for them for three and a half
[1:39:00] years it's the most beautiful thing when
[1:39:03] you see it brought out when you see it
[1:39:06] through the word of God so here you see
[1:39:08] what he's saying he the Gentile
[1:39:11] dispensation would be finished so all of
[1:39:15] this that is the next stage of Prophecy
[1:39:19] that is to take place in Israel is
[1:39:22] waiting on you and me to come into our
[1:39:26] fullness to come into the Gentile
[1:39:29] fullness of the Bride age where we
[1:39:32] recognize who we are in fullness and God
[1:39:36] raptures us out of this Dimension into
[1:39:39] that other
[1:39:40] dimension do you see how close we are
[1:39:44] we're at the fullness of the Gentile
[1:39:48] bride age
[1:39:51] amen I got so many other uh you know um
[1:39:57] here 70 weeks of Daniel brother you know
[1:39:59] William Bram speaks he says but now in
[1:40:02] this seven Church ages that we have went
[1:40:04] through in in the Gentile time it was
[1:40:07] all all the seven Church ages everything
[1:40:09] that happened from from when Christ rose
[1:40:12] from the dead until now was all to the
[1:40:15] Gentile
[1:40:17] Church Israel was in total blindness
[1:40:20] they were just going on as they were
[1:40:23] from from the crucifixion of Christ
[1:40:25] until the end of the church ages now
[1:40:28] we've been through it all down now we're
[1:40:30] getting to a place where we can go into
[1:40:34] the Seven Seals the seven vials the
[1:40:37] seven trumpets and all that it pictures
[1:40:40] together all dealing with the Jews and
[1:40:44] God's judgment to the people upon the
[1:40:46] earth and the remnant you see everything
[1:40:50] now is coming into fulfillment of the
[1:40:53] prophecy of what's going to take place
[1:40:57] with the nation of Israel okay and so
[1:41:01] remember in this great time of
[1:41:03] persecution there's millions of Gentiles
[1:41:06] that will die in that time because the
[1:41:10] world's going to go into World War III
[1:41:14] and there's going to be Gentiles
[1:41:15] worldwide that are going to be saying
[1:41:17] hey wait a minute this wasn't supposed
[1:41:19] to happen to us we weren't supposed to
[1:41:21] be stuck here going into into this uh
[1:41:24] you know tribulation I thought Jesus was
[1:41:27] coming I thought he was going to come in
[1:41:29] the clouds and he was going to he was
[1:41:31] going to just bring us up and we would
[1:41:33] just float up into the air you see it's
[1:41:36] all based on teachings of man but here
[1:41:39] we've got a word that is a supernatural
[1:41:42] word which brings you into a personal
[1:41:45] relationship where now you are being
[1:41:47] quickened by the word of God personally
[1:41:50] you have a personal testimony you you
[1:41:53] you you you you belong to the church
[1:41:55] because you have a personal revelation
[1:41:57] of who you are as a part of of the body
[1:42:00] of Christ and you're going to be
[1:42:02] raptured as a result of that personal
[1:42:05] relationship not as a result of this
[1:42:08] General teaching oh I'm just a Christian
[1:42:11] I'm gonna I'm GNA float up into the air
[1:42:13] one day and the world's going to go into
[1:42:14] chaos I'm sorry to say it but you know
[1:42:18] he's already
[1:42:20] come he's already here amen he's
[1:42:23] finishing up the work amen I know the
[1:42:26] YouTube channels are are blasting away
[1:42:29] and hundreds of thousands of views and
[1:42:31] millions of views of oh the next Bible
[1:42:34] prophecy and what is next to happen and
[1:42:37] what is going to happen here and people
[1:42:38] are just eating all of that stuff up all
[1:42:42] you need to do is come to church and
[1:42:45] receive the word for your day and meet
[1:42:47] Jesus Christ in the personal form where
[1:42:51] he comes into your life where you become
[1:42:53] naked before God and all your traditions
[1:42:55] and all your teachings and all your
[1:42:57] ideas get thrown away and you come into
[1:43:00] that relationship with Christ Millions
[1:43:03] will die they reject that rejected bride
[1:43:06] he says she was a rejected Church she
[1:43:10] thought that she had it but Jesus like
[1:43:13] he said I never knew you I never knew
[1:43:16] you there but wait a minute we did this
[1:43:17] in your name we did that I never knew
[1:43:20] you when my word came to you when I was
[1:43:23] trying to give you my word which is a
[1:43:25] seed and I came to you and I said hey
[1:43:28] you need to repent and be baptized in
[1:43:30] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:43:32] the remission of your unbelief you need
[1:43:34] to let go of all your teachings your
[1:43:36] Traditions you told me I was baptized as
[1:43:39] a baby that's good enough I was baptized
[1:43:43] into the titles of Father Son and Holy
[1:43:46] Ghost that's good enough that's what you
[1:43:49] told me so I I realized right there and
[1:43:53] then when my word came to you and you
[1:43:55] rejected it it's because I never knew
[1:43:58] you you never knew me you see it's hard
[1:44:03] to say
[1:44:04] but how else can I say it you know if if
[1:44:07] we don't preach the truth Jesus said the
[1:44:10] truth it'll set you free I'm bringing
[1:44:13] you the truth about his word and so the
[1:44:17] the reject that that remnant of the
[1:44:19] woman's Siege sleeping virgin remember
[1:44:22] you know Matthew 24 talks about the
[1:44:25] sleeping and the wise the wise and the
[1:44:27] foolish virgins well it's talking about
[1:44:29] the churches remember anytime you you
[1:44:32] you hear women in the New Testament in
[1:44:35] the Bible he's talking about the church
[1:44:38] Christ and the church right it's all
[1:44:41] about the virgins and there was wise
[1:44:44] virgins and there were foolish virgins
[1:44:47] the foolish virgins are going to be the
[1:44:50] ones that didn't receive the oil
[1:44:52] remember read read the scripture that
[1:44:54] they wanted the oil the oil is the Holy
[1:44:57] Ghost you can't give oil to somebody no
[1:45:01] you can't give them the Holy Ghost
[1:45:03] Christ gives them the Holy Ghost when
[1:45:05] they accept him when they when they say
[1:45:09] I I just like Mary be it unto me
[1:45:12] according to Thy word not my traditions
[1:45:15] not what the priest told me not what
[1:45:17] this one's teaching I want the word and
[1:45:19] when that happens you receive him and
[1:45:23] now the spirit of God in you can never
[1:45:26] deny the word and now you're showing
[1:45:28] that you weren't a foolish virgin you
[1:45:31] were
[1:45:31] wise you had oil you accepted you took
[1:45:35] it you you you trimmed your lamps
[1:45:38] meaning that you stayed you stayed in
[1:45:41] the Holy Ghost you stayed you know when
[1:45:43] you trim a lamp it's because you're
[1:45:44] you're trimming off all the the things
[1:45:46] that you got to get rid of in your life
[1:45:48] to keep the oil burning in your life to
[1:45:50] keep your experience going with Christ
[1:45:53] and you're and you're and you're
[1:45:55] constantly feeding on the word of God
[1:45:57] and you're you're you're attending the
[1:45:59] services and you're reading the word and
[1:46:01] you're praying with a genuine heart not
[1:46:04] praying only when things go wrong oh
[1:46:07] God and blaming God when things go
[1:46:10] wrong why did this happen you have to
[1:46:14] have a relationship and build that
[1:46:16] relationship up so that you can be in a
[1:46:21] condition that when those things happen
[1:46:23] he's there you're already fortified by
[1:46:26] the word of God and he brings you
[1:46:27] through it she goes right through that
[1:46:31] it's just as clear as this 70 of weeks
[1:46:34] just as clear and they will go through
[1:46:36] it so if you haven't got the Holy Spirit
[1:46:39] you'd better get it as quick as you can
[1:46:43] we're at the end time notice he says 7
[1:46:46] Church ages now I won't have to go
[1:46:49] through them because we've got them on
[1:46:52] tape and they're being put on books and
[1:46:54] everything that was that was the the
[1:46:57] that was the time that God never said
[1:47:00] there'd be so many days so many hours or
[1:47:03] so many years he never said anything he
[1:47:06] said until the Gentile dispensation be
[1:47:11] finished until the walls will be trod
[1:47:15] down until God quit dealing with the
[1:47:20] Gentiles let the musicians come
[1:47:24] what a Time
[1:47:26] Saints we're at the
[1:47:30] end we're at the maturity of the Gentile
[1:47:36] bride she's coming into her
[1:47:39] fullness she didn't do anything to
[1:47:42] deserve it you didn't do anything to
[1:47:45] deserve it it's God's mercy and Grace
[1:47:49] that's given you the ability to
[1:47:51] recognize
[1:47:53] we've just we're just blessed by God's
[1:47:57] grace amen praise God
[1:48:01] hallelujah thank you Jesus listen
[1:48:05] here just a couple of more quotes and
[1:48:08] we're going to end
[1:48:09] it and we are not living in Luther's age
[1:48:13] Wesley's age or the Pentecostal age that
[1:48:17] Pentecostal age was only a restoration
[1:48:19] of the gifts coming to the church but
[1:48:21] we're now living in the end time we're
[1:48:24] living in a time of the calling out of
[1:48:28] the Bride we're in the bride
[1:48:31] age we need to recognize how close we
[1:48:35] are to that fullness of the Gentile
[1:48:39] dispensation this is not the day of
[1:48:41] Pentecost the Pentecostal age is passed
[1:48:43] Pentecost is gone this is Harvest Time
[1:48:47] the invisible union he says the word
[1:48:50] that fell on the day of Pentecost will
[1:48:51] not work today day no sir he says that
[1:48:55] was for
[1:48:56] Pentecost this is for the
[1:48:59] bride going home of the Bride we we got
[1:49:02] something different the Pentecostals
[1:49:05] represented that again we're in the
[1:49:08] bride
[1:49:09] age Feast of the trumpets he says and
[1:49:12] the seventh Angel's message under that
[1:49:14] same trumpet same everything exactly the
[1:49:17] same seal is to what call the people the
[1:49:21] bride out of the Pentecostal and World
[1:49:25] tradition to the genuine atonement the
[1:49:29] word Christ impersonated in his word
[1:49:33] here made flesh Among
[1:49:37] Us I've heard but now I see and then he
[1:49:41] promised in the hour of the seventh
[1:49:43] Angel's message the Seven Seals would be
[1:49:45] revealed and the mysteries of God would
[1:49:48] be declared Revelation 10 when the
[1:49:50] seventh angel begins to sound his
[1:49:53] message not the healing service the
[1:49:56] message that follows the healing service
[1:50:00] you see this is not about you coming to
[1:50:03] church and getting healed God can heal
[1:50:06] you here God can God can transform you
[1:50:09] God can get you out of your financial
[1:50:11] difficulties God can restore your
[1:50:13] relationships but are you hearing the
[1:50:16] message that's coming because God's
[1:50:19] gifts God's signs and wonders they
[1:50:22] follow they follow them that
[1:50:26] believe you got to be a believer of the
[1:50:29] word first and everything is added to
[1:50:32] you you know here it is the last quote
[1:50:35] Christ is the mystery of God revealed he
[1:50:37] says God's great mystery of how it's a
[1:50:40] secret he kept it a secret nobody know
[1:50:43] nothing about it even the angels didn't
[1:50:46] understand it see he didn't reveal it
[1:50:48] that's the reason under our seventh
[1:50:51] mystery when the seventh seal was opened
[1:50:54] there was silence in heaven Jesus when
[1:50:57] he was on Earth they wanted to know when
[1:51:00] he would come he said it's not even the
[1:51:03] son himself doesn't know when it's going
[1:51:05] to happen see God has this all to
[1:51:09] himself it's a secret and that's the
[1:51:12] reason there was silence in heaven for
[1:51:15] the space of half an hour and seven
[1:51:17] Thunders uttered their voices and John
[1:51:20] was even forbidden to write it see the
[1:51:23] coming of the Lord that's why all this
[1:51:27] that's happening right now it's all
[1:51:29] happening because he's here he's present
[1:51:34] he's possessing his sons and daughters
[1:51:37] of God to recognize the hour that we're
[1:51:40] in he says and when he had opened the
[1:51:43] seventh seal there was silence in heaven
[1:51:45] Revelations 108 all for the purpose that
[1:51:49] he might
[1:51:51] restore the faith of the children back
[1:51:54] to the faith of the fathers so that he
[1:51:57] might call our names under the mystery
[1:52:00] of the seventh
[1:52:01] seal all these things that you know that
[1:52:05] you need to go and study you need to
[1:52:07] read the Seven Seals you need to
[1:52:09] recognize what uh was fulfilled under
[1:52:13] Malachi 4:5 what was fulfilled under
[1:52:15] Revelations 10:7 it was all to bring us
[1:52:18] to this time now this season now the
[1:52:23] fullness of the Gentile dispensation now
[1:52:28] where we come into the fullness of the
[1:52:31] word for this day and for this hour God
[1:52:36] God bless you
[1:52:37] Saints as we continue to bring present
[1:52:43] truth this ministry is about getting
[1:52:48] people to recognize their day amen and
[1:52:52] the message that God has provided for
[1:52:55] this day we believe that that's the
[1:52:58] message that will bring the
