you know we thank the Lord that our pastor is back his wife and let me tell you if you wasn't here Sunday go back and the word that came Sunday go back and listen to it sister God bless you God bless you everyone of you please sit down for a little while all what I would say go back and read and let the holy spirit that spoke Sunday speak to you get your portion on Sunday message amen because it was God that came down and spoke to US Direct amen uh I'm not saying that our pastor is not preaching every time he preach and I told him already I can see Christ in him but Sunday God came down to speak direct to us sometime he he will just keep the pastor aside and bring the former pastor and just bless us with his Blessing so I was so blessed on Sunday and I was saying what can I I was telling philli I says what can I bring even today but God knows because he have his children to be fed it's not because brother Kofi is holy or brother Kofi is righteous or brother kofy is so powerful it's all about Jesus only him when you came here tonight to see brother Kofi you won't get nothing but if you came here to see Jesus Christ he have something for you so let us all pull together tonight and rejoice in the Lord because our God is up to something big we can see the Fulfillment of scriptures we see even the pope is getting ready to go there I was watching watching him in the TV I saw they they tried to do his ceremony about his burier brother the man hasn't gone but they are propelling his H parade for his burier and things just imagine our God is not like that he's a living God that every day is alive and if you believe him you will be always alive that's why he says absent from this body be present with the Lord anyway let us stand up and glorify our King because National in time when we sing National in time we stand up so when we must we come together to read the word we must stand up for the word not for brother koffy or for the pastor or for anybody but for the word of God so my scripture I'll take it from Philippians 2:5 that's where I'm going to use today Philippians chapter 2 verse 5 it's just a short scripture let us bow our head and pray gracious Eternal Father father Lord Jesus once again father Lord God Almighty we give thee thanks we give thee praise father Jesus forgive us of our sins Lord God Almighty Lord you know I'm the least in the kingdom of God father I don't even sometime understand myself why you chose me because father you know that I myself know that I don't know nothing and if you don't come it will be a disaster but father I'm not trusting myself I'm trusting in you that you will come and take my lips and speak true because Lord you promise us that you will never leave us nor forsake us let the word be a blessing to each and everyone of us here tonight those that are listening online that they will also be blessed each and everyone will get their portion it's not because of brother Kofi but it's all about Jesus father draw nigh in Jesus name we pray amen amen okay Philippians chapter 2:5 let this man be in you which was also in Christ Jesus please s sit down you know we live in the day when the enemy if you are not watching you are bright the devil know we are all bright those that were chosen before the foundations of this world but what he will do to you is once you are on the a here he want your mind he don't want you to manifest Christ he want you to manifest him so the only way you can do is always concentrate yourself towards Christ because if you concentrate your mind towards Christ word you'll be able to accomplish what Christ want you to accomplish other otherwise you'll be bombardment because let me tell you even sometime when sickness hit you or poverty hits you or your children are so far away from serving God and you look you may say why am I a Christian believing God but but why this tries coming to me why am I so have I done something wrong have I misinterpret God no brothers and sisters it's nothing but the devil trying to take your mind because recognize 24 hours God is in you if you recognize like that no matter how the enemy comes right he will not able to take your mind to fulfill his way but you will fulfill the master word that he has sent you here to do because remember everything that you need is already provided amen Jesus has already provided everything that you need even if you are sick and Jesus is standing here physically and you goes to him and say Lord Heal me he cannot do it he can't why because he will tell you I've already done it I've already healed you already so it is up to you to claim your healing it is up to you to claim your children it is up to you to claim your Prosperity it is up to you to say Lord I am your son I am your daughter by Your Word nothing shall harm me amen by your word I can defeat the enemy Hallelujah by your word I am not afraid of anything that comes to me by your word the devil can do nothing yes sir because it's Jesus when he was here he defeated Satan by the word and how do you think you can defeat Satan today my brother just said it by the word the same way Jesus defeated him you it is your turn God is a finished work salvation is a finished work listen not because we came to this message that's why and even God baptized that's why we we we seeing God if you are God son or god daughter since you born because the Bible says gifts and calling are without what repentance God was revealing things to you here and there here and there here and there before a time will come then you will recognize no there's I'm different I'm different like as our former Pastor was saying even one he was young he used to see himself he will be in a crowd and he'll feel like he's lonely why he's he recognized that no I'm different don't you know God was even showing him I'm using him as example that he was different let me tell you brother Braham says every check there's three class of people if you are the bride of Christ the pastor don't have to tell you the Deacon don't have to tell you anybody don't have to tell you within you yourself between you and the Mighty God you know that you are a child of the king you know how do you know it God him will testify himself in you amen not just you come to church what did the Bible the scripture says it says to Jeremiah before even you were in your mother womb I knew you I ordain you right orain or even getting saved it just come by today you were chosen before the foundations of this world you are part of the pill of fire put into a body in the flesh now is your time that you are manifesting as a woman being this is just like you are in a put it this way a share but the main spirit that is in you came from God if you are bright so God is telling you recognize that recognize it and take authority you have power more than Satan amen don't you know when Satan was create created you were there you saw everything about him but he can never see everything about you do you know that because you are eternal if you are a bride you are Eternal so when you were there you were Eternal so Satan don't know you he knows only this but he don't know who really live in you come on because the one that live in you is eternal it's portion of the pill of fire and the only how can he defeat you God is they recognize who you are and if you are portion of God let me tell you you can run even in the body you try to run but you cannot hide the Holy Spirit the Deep call to the deep and the Deep must respond as the word been preached it's not brother Kofi or brother Simon or brother ch or Pastor dannyel or brother Tim or Phillip or whoever comes here it's all about Jesus Christ and if it is Jesus Christ he know how to take the preacher Tong without the preacher knowing it and let the word come and search your heart and if there is a pill of fire there inside you amen that word will go through like a like a surgeon doing operation and that word will go through that your heart to call that seed that is hidden in you and you can run you go home sleeping he will that voice will speak to you you'll be crying you go to work that voice will be speaking to you you are walking that voice will be speaking to you that voice won't leave you until you come to the water and repent and surrender to Jesus Christ in Acts 2:38 but if you are not part the preacher May preach preach preach preach preach nothing will come out but if you are part of God myship hear my voice yes sir a stranger they will never follow stranger doesn't follow the voice of God who are those strangers that's the devil children because when your father call you you you know your father voice you know your mama voice right you don't know a stranger voice Jesus when he was here he says I know my sheep my sheep know my voice voice you are part of him that's why you have come to hear the word of God Amen that's why you believe the prophet William Braham take William Braham message to the world how many people are responding but look our pastor he was going to buy furniture he wasn't going to say I'm going to church or I'm going to look for H Christ right but God set the path that he wasn't going to buy furniture spiritually inside him the Deep was calling to the Deep God has ambushed him like as he ambushed Moses in the burning bush yes sir so when that word was spoken are you a Christian right there he is that's example right brother desmon I used to live with him when brother Michael one day he told he has told me has told this about the gospel we used to laugh at this gospel we thought oh the brother is crazy gone what kind of a man is this cry too much he cry he pray he cry he pray pray cry that time I used to go Pary brother used to be H love Ry Ry music he's not paying attention to no Christianity me par every Friday all I think is work Saturday I'm going to Club almost every Club in Toronto I used to go from east scoro to St CLA all Toronto clubs downtown all the corners I used to go there that's one will tell you those days party guy talking about Christianity no way preachers their Crooks they want to take my money yes sir I straightforward cook I don't deal with Crooks I want to even stay away from them but inside here there was something inside here that no matter how I try to run since brother Michael spoke one word to me don't you know that a man should cut his hair down when I was a child my father has spoke that word to me nobody have spoke that word to me till the day brother Michael spoke to me and he told me oh God has sent a prophet and I he showed me the pill of fire I remember we used to smoke marijana to I used to smoke marijana with him so outside of the back Cory then he showed the brother Brown picture with a crowd on him right that didn't crink me because I didn't know about prophet and this and that I heard about Moses and Elijah people talking I wasn't brought up as a Christian but listen I try to run to make everything short there am I now here I am desmon tried to run if he came to the church here his car got accident a little bit he has said it he says me this my brand new Grandam is not coming back to this church again never would I come here come here to do what church I bought my Grandam that time White Collar all his plate sharp with his Jerry care young right brother on and you want me to come to church and this uh Stony Creek Church and get accident with my car I'm not coming but hey God knows how to get him one day he wake up brother Michael has gone to work early he couldn't fight brother Michael brother Michael told him about the Rapture so his heart was going boom boom boom brother Michael is he is he the Rapture come yet right and there he is each and every single one of us we are example of what God has done we everyone have his own testimony I have mine you have yours listen God been speaking to me since even I was a child he was speaking to me not just today even since I'm a child around 7 years old God spoke to me sitting in my grandmother doorstep I didn't know was God I hear the voice I came to Canada here I said me I'm going to go to school and become engineer pilotin plane Jane and Finch traffic light on the BS stop a voice the same voice that used to speak to me came to me says no way you don't even try I will never let you be educated I thought that voice was a devil So I says I I'll kill myself but in my heart I know suicide is not good I cannot do it so what am I supposed to do to do quench myself inside not knowing God God was trying to get my attention calling me say son you are brought you here for a purpose even can't you see yourself a man born completely literate but I have taken you to countries upon countries without nobody helping you sometime I speak to you I literally speak you hear the voice and you obey the voice you don't know what it is but it was I the Lord helping you and I've lead you here and I'm calling you there was a time in my life I wasn't even a Christian sleeping every Sunday morning I hear the voice come to me why don't you wake up and go to church My Heart Will Go Boom brothers and sisters this thing is real God is real why am I saying this I'm saying to you and I challenge you by the the power of God what brother Brown preached is the truth but the the message is carrying on is writing on the prophet has turned the Bon to us you and me so let us believe what the prophet spoke that has brought Christ on the earth Christ is now in you he's trying to tell you surrender to me like suay he was saying I don't need nobody God don't need nobody education God don't need nobody's smarted mind you understand sometime he want you to be like you you look into the people like a dummy do you know that God will let you look like a a a dummy in front of the people like you don't know nothing that's what I'm trying to say okay and the people take Glory ah this brother don't know nothing this sister don't know nothing and God will get the glory I remember sometime when I came to the message first I go at work people ask me questions you said you are Christian this that that and I tried to answer them and all of a sudden I I can't my mind block and I went to washroom and I'm sitting down there say oh God forgive me I don't know what to say and I thought the questions they are asking will just drop on my mind and I just watch myself come to them and tell them the answer that they were the question they were asking me that they themselves know that I don't know God will give me the right answer and and they shock my friend they used to be shock how did you know that that's the way that it is because why when you surrender to the one that live in you now now you know who live in you he will overcome Satan for you he will Ambush him for you he will do the work for you because Jesus when he was here he know who he is he know his purpose that's why he came here for so you now the message has come to you and always recognize who you are God want you to know that if you recognize who you are no matter what happen to you Satan cannot defeat you amen no no matter what because take Jesus as your example if you take Christ as your example did Satan conquer him Satan couldn't conquer him and he has promised you he said I will never leave you nor forsake you I will be with you in you to the end of the world he didn't said I'll be with you half of the world he didn't said I'll be with you cut out of the world so as long as you are in this world and the Rapture hasn't taken place no matter how you think recognize that God live in you and once God live in you Jesus live in you you'll be able to conquer the devil let me tell you me I'm not scared of nothing nothing I am not scared of nothing no more through Christ I can do all things through Christ I can overcome every Temptation the devil will bring upon me and so is you so recognize that your father has finished the work for you if your natural father or mother you came to this world some of us they buy you a house and the house worth let's say 2 million 10 million 5 million whatever and you are you the young ones and you see that oh my father have this assets for me my mom have this asset for for me are you going to doubt them that in case they gone the Lord told them you w have no money in your pocket right right brother are you going to doubt that even your natural father and mother you recognize they have something for you for future and it will make you feel proud you w't even you won't speak it but inside your mind back of your mind as woman being you feel proud that your father and mother has accomplished something for you take it spiritually your heavenly father amen the King of Kings the Lord of Lord the mighty conqueror the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who has conquered de for you who has conquered all grave for you who has oh my my my my my my he has conquered grave for you he has conquered poverty for you he has conquered sickness for you he has conquered any disease that will come upon you he has conquered it for you then why do and is he has conquered it he has demonstrated and leave it for you and said believe me if you don't believe the word even believe the word that I I say believe me trust me give me all your mind your heart so that the word will accomplish in you the word will never fail you once you put the word first it will never fail in your life it will accomplish what God want to accomplish in you we are the last baton we are the one that God so many time we think we are waiting for God God is waiting for us and God is saying don't be afraid of the people faces tell them them what I have done for you tell them the word of God if you meet the people tell them Jesus is Alive tell them like as our pastor former Pastor was saying God has sent a prophet never mind they says oh this message is a cult yes some will deny it but elect if he's elect if he deny it he may say oh no I don't I I don't know I don't believe but it was started inside the heart here the SE there will be started thinking about it he can't have a rest until he obey until he obey check yourself we all should to check ourself if your mother if you were not born in the message somebody have to tell you and some of us at the beginning it wasn't easy right it wasn't easy you struggle with is it true Prophet Has Come This Modern days these days when everything is so ming the churches are Ming the priest with their nice colar with their nice ropes they nice educated the churches look so nice and God will send a prophet no now it is they have so many Prophet you tell the person yes it's not a man man man manual Prophet you are talking about AIA in the Old Testament they used to call the true Prophet like Elijah AIA Moses like AIA in this last days 20th century God has sent the Gentiles AIA his name was William Braham amen he has come and demonstrate the power of God God has used him to raise Christ wherever the denominations used to put his name in the whom God let him brought him out from the grave because for the people to know that Jesus is Alive ever more if they don't believe you tell them to go what deep call to the Deep the Deep call to the deep is on YouTube it's on uh h on the uh what do you call YouTube yeah if they watch it they will see it fors can a man do that why he's telling people oh you live in such and such an address your name is so and so do say the Lord you are here can a man do that no it was God that has come down it was God that was demonstrating himself and now now the word is calling us that time God was calling the people out from denomination they should come out now the message has called us out from denomination you may say I wasn't in the church whether you are in the world the world is still a denomination Egypt the world is still in Egypt you came from Egypt but the Mighty hand of God the power of God has brought you out from Egypt all denomination and now you are feasting with MK and honey because it's not a man feeding you no man can feed you no sir we are not living in the day of intellectual yes it's not quote unquote will take us to Heaven it's not not how we think we know the te based on Christ Christ the Lord he has done it for us right he have his way like as our pastor was saying every preacher that God has ordained he have a certain ways they talk they do you may not like it you may not think they know too they don't know nothing it doesn't matter how much they know it's whether Christ is in him or Christ is not in him because he ordained them for certain way right sometime I'm sitting down there and I I says to myself Lord why do you even call me to pophead I can't even speak you know how I struggle to read the Bible if you only know to read the Bible is a big like I can't even explain it right one time the Lord told me he says scovi I can let you read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation it just opened my mind boom and I can see I was reading so easy and all of a sudden it Clos it BL do my then he left some part for me and sometime I pick it I see here I know it turned like a preaching for me I says what is this I don't know when I was in school I was no good it's not that my family are literate or something no but I I can't I couldn't understand it but now I know I'm so happy I'm so thankful unto the Lord I'm so trusted in him oh you can call me whatever you want I don't care I don't truly because I see the light like Moses when the Lord spoke to him in the burning bush you think Moses care about what you think about him you think Moses will be afraid of going to pharaoh to take Egypt no because he has made a king all my doubt all my problems has solv let me tell you that's why if not so like the way I was sick I supposed to go in the grave they told me some doctors I says listen I don't care whoever they all the machines me I've gone through I'm not saying with my lips all the machines in the hospital they take this test me test me go here go there you you name it I I don't know the names I go through all of it but I said in my heart I am not going to grave yet unless the Lord said so unless Jesus said so but someone was talking about cancer going days going do you know last time I testify about they they checked me put me into a machine inject me let me go home come back 2:00 and they check me and I went to the doctor and he says there was no cancer in your bones again I testify of that few weeks ago not too long I went to hospital again the French doctor in willing I go to him he were sitting and he were talking he looked at me he says Kofi I can't find trace of cancer in your body the same doctor told me I have lot of cancer I'm going to drink medicine the rest of my life is he says once he says that his wife is a Muslim so he's a Muslim but his French Canadian doctor I says before I know it when he says that says praise the Lord Brother it just come out from like that and he look at my face like something like that he was sitting on the hospital bed and I was sitting on the chair and he repeat again and I the thing just come out from me praise the Lord listen our God is real our God is real you want to know the test morning is not that just the brothers are preaching from Pastor Simon to me and the lease here we are not just talking we are not just talking W this good neighbor Ministry is not a man build it it's God who has he taking a man heart Liv in the man heart and says I'm going to build my church and name it as good neighbor Ministry I'm going to take my preachers and put them there whether they they educated they uneducated let me tell you you better shut up don't talk about the preachers that stand here whatever they speak you may not like it quiet you God knows why he chose them God God know you better be quiet even if they make mistake you don't like it quiet because they don't sleep they don't rest God don't let them rest until until everything is made right until they do things that he want otherwise he will deal with them from the pastor to the least because God eye is on you God is so jealous of you each and every one of you God is so jealous okay if you don't know if you know how much God Is Watching Over You 24 hours whether you are at work whether you are at home whether you are sleeping whether you sitting in the church he come here he speak to you the words that are coming from the pulpit here it's like you sitting in the burning bush we talk about burning bush the Lord spoke to Moses right now you are sitting in the burning bush and the fire is coming but where is the fire the fire hiding in the body and he's speaking to you he's speaking God is speaking to you the brother don't know listen me I I don't have my mind to say anything to H nobody no that's not my mission I I tell you the truth I'm not here to criticize no no no no no no no no no I won't I won't do that to anybody because I love you all I've seen what God has done for me I'm so pleas with God and I want everybody that is here will obey the pastor it's not easy to be a pastor he has been Pastor Simon I saw him when he came I know he has gone through a lot God has buil him up chose him I saw even when he was trying to run away God is calling him and he's trying to run away I could see it nobody have to tell me you think I don't know I saw all that but God has brought him to the point where he can't run again now he has it's like he has put the H the the thing on his on in him the Bing on in him so all our troubles all our pain everything we need is in him God want us to follow him he will lead us to him if we are not doing that have confidence in him because God word is in him you may think he don't know he know is not a man listen I God sometime tell me I said Lord I don't know he says what do you think you think I think like a man I am God I don't make mistakes when I choose I choose I didn't choose you because you come here to go to school or to to be a rich man or to be in a big family or because you can't read very good no I chose you when the Bible wasn't even written I chose you when you each and every one of you I chose you when the Bible wasn't even written in the form of a paper I chose you after already positionally placed you when the Bible wasn't written okay I chose you when the Bible wasn't written in the paper I chose you and I positionally place you when the Bible wasn't even written in the paper you are sitting in your positions so recognize who you are and fulfill what I want you to do for me if you recognize that then you can accomplish for me yes you know Satan tells us because we are in this flesh oh this brother is so he can talk so big he can read so good his sentence are right don't you know if Judas is standing here our brother is saying Judas was very educated he know all the letters better than Peter and John and all those SCH but it didn't the Lord knows their heart he has already ordained Peter Peter was even running away from the gospel but before even the Bible was written in paper Peter was part of God that was what God was looking and Peter was has been ordained already to preach the gospel amen that's why naturally the Lord told him when you get converted strengthen your brothers and sisters the Lord was looking Way Beyond okay and you who are sitting here let me tell you you are bigger than what you think what is in you is bigger than what you yourself think is so real to me I'm seeing God the pillar of fire sitting in the benches ping ping ping ping sitting in the benches hiding in the body yeah that's what I'm saying I'm not joking God is real to me God what can't you do for us what do you want let me tell you you may think this is Brother Kofi West brother Kofi don't have West let me tell you if we are serious and give us his mind nothing nothing right here nothing that will be a hindrance nothing will be a hindrance amen God will do signs and wonders than God brother Braham God sometime the message people they think oh it's just a message another church this is not a church this is God's Own people that he love he came here to die to demonstrate because you have people that are part of him that because the serpent sodu Eve we are trapped in a body so he have to come here to pay the price to redeem us so that put it in the paper book form so that when we come here he know the world will be so scientific that we have to some we have to read it but the more they read it then and and take it by Revelation B by bit it revealed to them who they are and we who can read as Pastor Simon Pastor Danny who has ERS and all the other brothers as they preach and I'm sitting in the bench for so long what does he do it bring my my position it bring God to me he reveal Christ to me then I begin to see myself all right when Jesus preached to Peter that was spoken word slowly slowly Jesus telling him he revealed to himself oh so I'm not just a Fisher mind I'm not just going to sit in the bench and warm the bench I am not a bench warmer but I am one who will carry the the Bible and and speak God word and preach the gospel I didn't ask for it never I don't even ask as for that it just come to me God just give it to me let me tell you that's why you you see people rushing to the pulpit God hasn't called them a true preacher doesn't Rush as a matter of fact they stay be away from the popit but if you are one that God is calling no matter what what you're going to come if you are one that God is calling you to be saved you can run but you cannot hide you're going to come because not one hoof of God's children is going to be lost because you know what sometime some people like you visit this church and even go but the word that is preached you may not recognize it God has already spoken to your heart the doctor has already do the surgery in your heart and you try to run when you run the surgery that he did the word is already there you can go wherever you want it going to bring you because why we are prophecy in this world do you know you are a prophecy do you recognize yourself that you sitting here you are a prophecy by God's spoken word in Prophecy form come in flesh sitting where God want you to sit in his presence so recognize who you are if you recognize that no matter what happened to you Satan can defeat you you'll be always rejoicing you'll be always giving God thanks you'll be always lifting him up amen you'll be always say all is well amen joy peace Hallelujah will always come to you Prosperity will come to you let tell you brother Gabriel knows me when we used to come to church I told him some things and brother call I told him something even yesterday he called me and he says brother you have said this you have says that I say yeah he says brother I believe once you have spoken it I believe what you have told me one hasn't come to pass but I believe it will come to pass I said brother Cy thank you but let me tell you you looking at me a man who God has chosen that the spoken word is in him whatever I spoken I believe my God that live in my soul the Lord Jesus Christ he will bring it to pass no matter what he will bring it to pass in his time my eye will see it can you believe the like that doesn't matter how you get sick how much poor you are what condition you are how long your children carry how much you you you you everything has look like condemn on your you still believe God and still speak the word and says my God is able to do it his unable God he will bring it to pass and stand on the word these days people are shaking why is it that like the church supposed to always fill up like God's bride I'm not talking the world like I'm I'm talking about the bride of Christ but even them because so many of them they are like they don't really even recognize themselves yet like one time I used to testify to a man on 2765 this guy used to a drug dealer test y to him testify to him then one day he called me said he called me my brother come my mommy is here his mother was sitting in the car and brother I go to the Mom all I said momam I'm just trying to get your son to to come to me to serve Christ the woman look at me says oh God and he says today I was just telling my son about he should give his life to Christ and why he says like that says oh my God he says listen you even you you haven't recognized who you are yet fully yet you are a real Christian but you haven't even recognized who you are yet and he says oh I have hid from all since I was a kid I've been hiding from uh preachers but you I cannot hide he started telling me his life story things that he seen things while he was married to his husband his husband will tell him I'm going out here but he will see him with another woman in the womb making love he will see the the womb the house everything and the husband come you will tell him the husband tell her he's a witch he says I used to have friends the friends I have we were three friends I told one I says get yourself ready you're going to leave this head soon the other one the two told her he's a witch he say sister mon it come to pass he says right now me and my husband my husband doesn't change his life we separate that was the boy father he says I I don't live ungodly no he says I don't I live ungodly I have a boyfriend he says even why I'm sitting in front of you here I'm naked I never say anything he says I'm sitting in front of you I'm naked but I'm telling you the truth if you are not a real Christian I will Sease it I will Sease it you are a real Christian but you don't know yourself yet re yet and it's you know what later on I knew because I know it's a gift and calling of that repentance on her that doesn't make her a Christian he's born with a gift because my uncle used to have those gifts I know and he used to worship an idol so I know about those things but what I'm trying to tell you is like a lot of believers they are God's bride but they haven't recognized the word them themselves fully yet when you haven't recognized the word fully yet yet today you come to service tomorrow you don't come next week you come to service two weeks you don't come one month you come to service next month you don't come you understand they are God's bride but they haven't recognized themselves yet I'm not talking about you working and the condition you have to we all know how life is so tough but let's be realistics and speak the truth with God love you understand if you really recognize it this morning sitting here sometime we come from work the you close 4:00 you don't even eat you know service starts 7:30 look at brother Des as he sitting asking he just crosss from work straight to work uh to church to service why does he come why because he know how God fed him through the service he recognized the important of the service Philip the same thing some of you the same thing they recognize sometime brother Bill look at his age he just close from work with his sons and he's here he know how important the service is to him because why when you come to the service you are telling the Lord I appreciate you my heavenly father Hallelujah I appreciate you hallelujah what you have done for me I am so appreciated and God will love you you don't know like that the scripture says forsake not the Assemblies of the the house of the Lord I'm sorry some do it's not good if you are hearing me from the the you two you should know it's time for you to change because the train is about to move we are about to move to meet the Lord in the air there's no time to waste too long those that will play fool to be too long too long God will take his bride do you want him to take your B down you are on your bed when people are on the
