Actually, just just stay for a just stay for a minute. Just the uh musicians, you singers can sit. Praise God. Amen. Praise God. Uh we're happy to be here this morning. Um please be seated. I want to welcome everybody into the house of the Lord this morning. Praise God. We have some visitors with us this morning. Um, Brother Ian and his lovely wife, Brother Daniel, and sister Sarah's father and mother-in-law. Amen. Welcome into the house of the Lord. I see a lot of family members there from the Kuska family. Amen. Welcome into the house of the Lord this morning. Uh, Brother Franko and his son there, Adrian. Amen. It's good to see you in the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. Praise God. Oh, I see. Praise God, Sister Kim. and his uh lovely mother there, brother uh Alvin's mother. Praise the Lord. It's good to have you all in the house of the Lord this morning. I know it's Christmas time and it's a great time to to get out and um you know, be together with family and friends. Um we certainly appreciate you being here with us this morning because uh we love the Lord and we love his word and we love to share his word. And I trust that today you'll receive something from the Lord that will encourage your hearts and allow you to say it was good to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. Praise God. But also today we have a a wonderful I love baby dedications. Today we are going to have the dedication. You want to put up the slide? We're going to have the the dedication of uh little Annayiah. Amen. Annayia uh Kaska Costka. Amen. Praise God. And um and so uh I want the family to come ahead now and uh bring our dear little uh Annayiah. Amen. And um sit here at the front. Are they here? Praise God. Amen. So um how uh let the godly father and the godly mother Amen. Also, uh, Craig and, uh, Sarah, come to the front, um, along with mom and dad. Amen. We are going to have a baby dedication. Um, praise God. So, what we'll do is we'll we'll just get started with the dedication and then when they're ready, they can just come to the front and and sit here with us. Amen. I want to welcome everybody here. We have um of course brother Christopher and sister Farita, grandma and grandpa. And um and also Rodney Mohan, that's Candace's grandfather. Amen. Uh Rose Fernandez, Calvin's grandmother. Amen. Welcome into the house of the Lord this morning. Um Ann Nia's aunts, uncles, great aunts, great uncles. Wow. Praise God. We've got uh the whole family here to support um the family in the dedication of their beautiful little girl. Amen. Let's read the scripture from Matthew. Let's all stand for a moment. Uh we're going to be um brief, but we want to just, you know, bring some thoughts here as we uh dedicate this child. I believe that um you know the Lord uh is mindful of every uh desire of a mother and father especially uh when they bring their children before God. In Matthew chapter 19 13 to 14 it said then were there brought unto him Jesus little children that he should put his hands on them and pray and the and and notice here the disciples rebuke them. You know uh you know the the people you know it just goes to show you they they they always thinking that that children are going to be trouble. You know oh here they come they want to cause trouble. No, no. The Lord knew his children. Amen. God knows the future of every one of his children. Amen. That's why he was God. But Jesus said, "Suffer the little children and forbid them not to come unto me because he's making it very clear here. For such is the kingdom of heaven." If you can't be simple and and humble and be willing to uh you know make yourself as little children before God, then are you really part of the kingdom of God? Amen. Praise God. And so, um we're very happy today that uh you know, dedication is something that brings new life. God bless you. God bless you, brother. Amen. Welcome, Calvin. Candace. Amen. Mom, mom and dad, sister Anita, brother Brian. Amen. Sister Farita. All right. So, dedication is something that bring You may be seated. Thank you. Everybody just have your seats. We'll just be a few minutes. We want to share some thoughts. It's something that brings new life into the family. Every time there's a child that comes into the house of the Lord, it's new life. Amen. And it's also an opportunity for mom and dad to, you know, examine their own lives and to rededicate their lives because in order to really bring your children before God, you know, mom and dad, you need to have a relationship with God. Amen. And this is of utmost importance. Praise God. In Psalms 127:3, it says, "Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord." In other words, they're part of his heritage. Amen. God wanted a family. God desired to have a family to to have fellowship with his sons and his daughters. Amen. And the fruit of the womb is his reward. So what's the scripture telling us? That a child is a gift from God. The kind of gift you cannot give back to God in the way that people return material gifts. Amen. We're giving we're dedicating the child unto the Lord. You know, there's an illustration. Someone asked a lady one time, "Have you given your children to the Lord?" And she said, "I'd like to give them back, but I thought God had a no return policy on kids." Now, that's not the kind of dedication or the give back that we're talking about here this morning. Amen. We're talking about dedicating them unto the Lord. Amen. And if truth be known, it's not always going to be a child that smiles back at you and is so perfect and so pretty and so beautiful. They start to grow up. They start to get thoughts of their own. They start to express their own ideas. And guess what? It brings challenges to your life. A amen. They grow up. But thank God that we can dedicate them from this time in their lives because there's a promise that comes that if we dedicate our children unto the Lord and train them up in the way of the Lord, he says, "I'll be with them. I'll watch over them." Amen. Praise God. And so, uh, I'd like to just emphasize three points here as we go to this dedication of Anna. First, it's a co it's a confirmation of your love for God. Candace Calvin, you bringing Annayiah here today is a confirmation that you trust the Lord and that you love the Lord. Amen. And the first thing you're saying is when you give your child back to the Lord, it's simply this, that you love God even more than you love that child. because you're placing that child into God's hands. &gt;&gt; So, you better love him and trust him with all of your heart. Amen. Praise God. And your child is the most prized possession, but don't allow them to take place over God. That's why the the word says first the kingdom of God. Amen. We need to place him first and everything else follows. Jesus said in Matthew 10:37-38, "He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. &gt;&gt; And he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me." &gt;&gt; So this is the first thing that we want to understand. Dedicating your child to God is a way of confirming that God is the first in your affections. &gt;&gt; Amen. Dad and mom, the most important thing you can do for your child is to be an example of parents that love the Lord. Amen. As your highest priority in your life, you will always place the Lord. Amen. Glory to God. And second, we're giving our children to God. When we give our children to God, it's a clarification of ownership. We're giving them back to God because we're we're saying, "Lord, this is your child." &gt;&gt; He's the giver of all life. And we're acknowledging that this is your child. And so we are saying, Lord, thank you for this reward, but we are offering her life back to you as a as something that you can use for your glory. Amen. Praise God. When you give your child to God, you're openly declaring that your child is a gift from God. That your child does not really belong to you. That he or she belongs to God first. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you are given the responsibility to handle God's children. Amen. Glory to God. Psalms 127:3 puts it in this way. Children are a heritage and a gift. They are the fruit of the womb and it's his reward. Imagine this beautiful Anniah is a gift from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a miracle every time that God gives us. Now, if our children belong to God, then we're merely stewards of them. Amen. We'd better be careful how we treat them and care for God's property. When parents abuse their children physically or verbally, they're abusing what belongs to God, and God will judge them for that. That's one of the problems in this world today. Too many people don't understand the reward of a child coming into their lives and they don't properly care for their children. Children are God's heritage, not ours. So we have great responsibilities to love them, care for them, nurture them, teach them the way of the Lord. Protect them, discipline them, and tell them about the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. and prepare them for a life of service for God and for others. And finally, third, it is a commitment to raise them up God's way. When we're dedicating our children, we're also saying we will raise them according to your word, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The underlying concept of nurture is structuring. This would mean discipline when it's needed. When uh it also covers the whole training experience whereby a parent structures a child's life instead of simply letting them do whatever they want, they place a level of discipline around their lives because we know that that provides protection for them. &gt;&gt; Amen. So basically Paul says to bring your children up with structure and discipline on one hand and plenty of verbal exhortation, positive affirmation and uh you know uh instruction on the other. Amen. Counseling them as they grow up. So if we train up a child in the way of the Lord, Proverbs 22:6 says that uh in the way that he should go and when he is old, he will not depart from it. You train him up according to the word of God. Show him the path of the Lord, that child will eventually find their way back if they should stray. Amen. That's a promise of the Lord. Amen. So, at this time, I'd like to have you come to the front. I don't know if she's going to let me hold her, &gt;&gt; but I love holding little children. Hello. Hello, beautiful girl. Hello, Annayia. Praise God. You're beautiful. You're absolutely beautiful. Praise God. Let us pray. Amen. Father, what a privilege this morning, Lord, that we can stand before this audience, Lord, as witnesses of the desire of our precious brother Calvin and Sister Candace, Lord, to bring Anniah before you and to dedicate her unto you, oh God. Lord, it takes a village to raise a child. And Lord, we vow to stand as support and to be there whenever they would need us, Lord. Whether it be in prayer or in any way, Father, we stand as witnesses and we stand as uh Lord, security for our dear brother and sister and for this beautiful child. And Lord, as we lay hands upon them, oh God, we as Jesus laid his hands upon the children, Lord, we bless them and we ask your protection, your guidance, your wisdom, your direction. Lord, may angels encamp this little angel Anniah. Oh God, may you protect her every step of the way, Lord, as she begins to walk, as she begins to talk. Lord, may your anointing and may your spirit so protect and guide mom and dad. Watch over them, Lord. keep this family safe and Lord healthy and wealthy and Lord may your anointing just continue with them and may the spirit of revelation continue to direct and guide the father of the home to lead that home and to be a protector and a guide. Father, oh God, may the gentleness of a mother's love, Lord, so be expressed upon this child that she will she will display love &gt;&gt; in all of her ways and in the and even in her smiles, Father. Lord, we we just appreciate what you're doing for this family, Lord. Bless them, all of their family, Lord. Their mothers, their fathers, their grandmas, their aunts and uncles. Father, may you just pour out a blessing upon each one. Father, grant that we pray in the name of Jesus Christ. I dedicate Anniah unto you right now for your glory in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Congratulations. &gt;&gt; Congratulations. Let's give them a round of applause. Amen. Praise God. All right. Well, let's sing that song. Bring them in. We've brought them in. Let's sing that song now as they go and sit down. Let's sing it. Amen. Give me a key. Bring them in. Oh, bring them in. Bring them in from the fields of sin. Bring him in. Bring them in. Bring the wondering hearts to J. One more time. Oh, thank you. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in from the fields of sin. Bring them in. Bring bring the wandering hearts to Jesus. Amen. Praise God. How many are looking forward to the dinner after the service today? Amen. We're going to have a our Christmas our family Christmas get together and dinner. Amen. And so we're looking forward to that. It starts uh the doors will be opening over there just after 3:00. Dinner will be served sometime around 4. Amen. And so we're looking forward to that. God bless you musicians. Thank you very much. Glory to God. And so, um, you know, we've got lots of time today. Uh, is anybody in a rush? Good. Good. Amen. Because we we'd like to just, you know, um bring what the Lord has laid upon our hearts. And I trust that somehow you will receive something that will uh allow you to leave here just a little stronger than when you came in. Uh maybe recognizing a little more that uh who you are and and Oh, praise God. Sister Sheila, God bless you. And and your sister's here with you. God bless you, sister. Welcome. Amen. Amen. Praise God. Welcome. Welcome. Praise God. And so, let's um let's let's change the order of the service. Let's just have a word of prayer. How many's got a need this morning? Say, "Lord, remember this that's on my heart. I know there's many. Let's Let's remember brother John Simon and Sister Desire. Uh they've got a bit of a flu. They're getting better. I was talking to him yesterday. He is feeling better, but not quite enough that that they could be with us today. So, we certainly want to remember them in prayer. We want to uh continue to remember our sister Deborah Beers in prayer as the Lord uh finalizes a complete and total healing and deliverance and completion to this uh situation that she's been dealing with. We trust God. We believe God. Amen. We want to continue to pray for our sister Sheila. She's a wonderful testimony of what God is doing. Um we're so grateful for what God is doing. Amen. Let's pray. Father, how blessed that we can raise our hands unto a living God that knows every desire, every heart. Lord, sometimes these requests are just hard to speak, Father. They're just in the inner depths of our heart, Lord, because we've been dealing with them so long. But Lord, we know that uh you have a purpose in everything. And your ways are so much higher than our ways and beyond uh Lord, how we would think, Father. So Lord, you see every uplifted hand, you see every heart, Lord. May you just meet every need, Lord. And do it according to your time, your season when you can make it beautiful where we can look back and say, "Thank you, Lord. I knew that you had to wait until now." That's why, you know, Lord, you just have a way of doing things that just makes you uh so marvelous in our sight. So Lord, take control of each and every heart. Lord, as we go to this uh part of the service now, Lord, I'm just a man. Lord, I'm asking for your divine help. I I know that I've studied and and uh many things that you've placed in my heart, Lord. Help me to deliver it, Father. And help the people to receive it, Father. Lord, this is our desire, Lord. This is this is why we come into the house of the Lord, Father. This is why we come into your presence because we want to we want to lay it all at the altar. We want to say, Lord, have your way and speak to every one of our needs, Lord, from speaker to hear. Father, may you grant it now in the name of Jesus Christ. And Lord, remember those that are sick amongst us. Raise them up in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. Praise God. Glory to God. Let's um let's go to the word. Um we've been on an adoption series for quite a while. for the last uh three months or so. Um I believe that it'll probably end this year. You know, this year's only got a couple weeks left. So, um I'm just going to just keep going as the Lord just keeps inspiring and, you know, keeping the atmosphere around this word. Um I believe that uh you know, he has he has a word for each age and uh he has a word for you. That's a word in season. Right where you are today, right now, right, uh today, I believe that if you if you can enter into that element, um recognizing that Jesus Christ is he's present. He's a present God. Amen. Then that will change the way that you you receive the word. Amen. Praise God. And so uh God's desire has always been you know from the very beginning to to uh you know to be with sons and daughters to have a family to be expressed in a family to have fellowship with his children. Amen. That's what true Christianity is really all about. Amen. So let's uh let's go to our scripture. We're going to continue on our title of calling the sons of God. I believe that we're in an hour where the word is calling. The word is calling. We we we don't call, but the word calls. Amen. The faith cometh by hearing. And when you hear your name being called, it's because you're a son or a daughter of God. Amen. And so, let's go to scripture. Job chapter 38. Um, we read this last week, but we're going to read it again. We're going to just continue from where we were. Uh, so he goes on to say, he says, he's speaking to Job. He says, "Where was ye? Where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou has understanding, who hath laid the measures thereof? If thou knowest. He's asking Job what. So, you know, because Job was in a real real pickle, you know, he was in a real situation and he was kind of getting into a situation where he was, you know, uh, fighting up a little bit and, you know, he was being he was being attacked by by those, you know, by his friends. you know, they were they were medical doctors and whatever, you know, and and you know, and they they were telling Job, "Oh, why don't you just curse God?" And Job in in his, you know, responses, he got a little bit, you know, lifted up in in his ways and kind of was questioning, you know, even God, questioning God, but he never doubted God. But but but hey, you you get yourself into a situation sometime. Amen. You get down into a hard situation sometime and and any one of us and every one of us has said, "Lord, why? Why, Lord?" &gt;&gt; But he says, "Where were you when I laid the foundations? Who hath laid the measures thereof? If thou if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? How is the earth and everything, you know, everything is in in perfect uh, you know, balance and harmony, you know, with the universe? I did all of that. Or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy. Amen. Praise God. You know, we can we can question a lot of things while we're here on this earth, but I want you to know that God has an answer for every single question that's in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. God knows every one of you where you're at right now, the situations that you're dealing with. He says, "I laid the foundations of the world. I had everything." And then he goes on and he says, "And and and and where were you when the when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy?" &gt;&gt; Because you know like you know let's let's read the quote here from brother Brandham. We read this last week but in uh in um the hand of the Lord upon him came upon him. He says why I said about God spoke to Job one day and he said Job where was you when I laid the foundations of the world tell me what they're they're fashioned unto said when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy now listen he says a hundred million years before the world was ever formed they had shouting religion in other words God took Joel right back into the into the back part of his mind before he was even God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And was and was laying the whole earth and the whole foundation and the whole plan that he had in the back part of his mind. Amen. And and he says that this that God had a shouting religion. Then talk about something new. He says why it's the oldest there is and the only kind there really is. Yeah. It's oldfashioned, heartfelt, sky blue, sinkilling religion, brother. It don't whitewash you. It washes you white from the inside out. Amen. Yes. It make you do things you didn't you you didn't think you ever would do. Amen. Praise God. This is Listen, this word of God is not something that's new. It might be new to you in the revelation, in the season, in the time that God is bringing a word to you, but it's not something new to him. He had you in the back part of his mind that that that he would know that when his word would come forth in this dispensation, in this particular age that you're in, regardless of the condition that you were in, &gt;&gt; regard look, Job was having a tough time. Amen. You know that he was he'd lost absolutely everything. &gt;&gt; So don't try to you want to compare to something compare to Job. Are you in that kind of condition this morning where you're full of boils and you've got you know pain everywhere. Yeah we wake up in the morning we got aches. We got pains but not like that. You could still be in the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. So regardless of your circumstance, regardless of your condition, regardless of where you are, God knows what you need. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. He knows exactly the word that he needed to send you in the age that you were in. Amen. Praise God. So they were shouting. Now, now we talked about it last week where we said, you know, the the the morning stars, we made it clear that the morning stars were the angels. Amen. Those were the angels that God had created &gt;&gt; in the very beginning because God created the angels first. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you know sons of God were expressed you know when you go back to you know Genesis 1:26 where God created Adam in his image. That was the first son of God that was actually being expressed in the image of God in the likeness of God. He was spirit man. He was eternal. He was not in a fallen condition as yet. Amen. Praise God. So, we you know, we don't want to get too far ahead here, but but we need to recognize that um that, you know, that there's that this faith that God has given us in this hour is the faith that is going to deliver us. He knew what we would need in the age that we were in so that we could overcome the age that we were in. Amen. So God knows that, you know, like listen, there's, you know, I'm just going to tell it straight as it is, okay? 99% of the churches out there are preaching an historical Jesus, &gt;&gt; they're always praising him for what he's done in the past. They're praising him for what he's going to do in the future, but they fail to recognize the light of the day, &gt;&gt; the light of the hour, what God is doing right now, what he's trying to accomplish. It's always been that way. Look at when Jesus himself came to the earth. How many actually recognize him? &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter what Listen what what God is looking at. He's not looking at your your your background, your upbringing. You could have been Buddha. You could have been Muslim. You could have been uh Jehovah Witness. You could have been a Baptist. You could have Listen, we're not talking about uh um uh titles here. We're not talking about denomin denominational teachings of man and doctrines of man. God is looking at the attribute of himself in you. &gt;&gt; The the the thought that he had of you before he ca before you came here. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's important for us to recognize that the Jesus that we preach from this gospel is the living Jesus. The one who who knows you today, knows where you're at right now, &gt;&gt; regardless of your condition, &gt;&gt; he's he's sending a word in season for you. Amen. And that word in season is is available today. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Glory to God. Listen, to recognize him, we listen, we we don't want a historical Jesus. We want the one that's now. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, when Jesus was walking on the earth, there was a woman one day that had a blood issue &gt;&gt; and that woman touched the hem of his garment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus turned around and says, "Who touched me?" Now, how many women or how many people had to touch him? He was in a crowd &gt;&gt; and people were touching him left, right, and center. But yet when she touched him, he turned around and he looked at the girl and he said, "Daughter, &gt;&gt; daughter, &gt;&gt; okay, thy faith has made thee whole." &gt;&gt; Something in her recognized &gt;&gt; Jesus in the present stage of his ministry that it was not just Jesus. It was actually Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is the element that we have to recognize. Amen. That when Jesus looked at her and said, "Daughter, thy faith has made thee whole." What was he saying? I knew you from before the foundations of the world and you recognized me in the present stage &gt;&gt; of of my word, my ministry, that you you you had heard that Messiah was coming. And now you've recognized that Messiah is here. &gt;&gt; And you've touched me and and and I want you to know that you're MY DAUGHTER. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE MY SON. &gt;&gt; When you can recognize the light in your day, that's because you are a son or a daughter of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he says, your faith. Faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; What is a revelation? A revelation is something that God reveals to you. when when he when he knew that he had been touched by the faith of a daughter, by the discernment, he recognized, "Oh, here's an attribute." &gt;&gt; And he turned. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Your faith, your revelation, your understanding, your recognition of me &gt;&gt; has made you whole." &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care what condition you're in today. YOU MIGHT BE SICK. YOU MIGHT BE DOWN and out. You might be depressed. But listen, if you can RECOGNIZE JESUS IN THE PRESENT stage of his ministry, you can be changed RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WHY he came. &gt;&gt; That's what we have. We are carriers of the word. THAT'S WHY HE SAID TO TO the disciples, "Whatever you bind on earth, you're going to bind in heaven. Whatever you loose on what do you mean by that?" He said, "Greater things you will do than than even what I do &gt;&gt; because I'm going back to the father." reason because when I go back, I'm coming on you &gt;&gt; and then you are going to be my mouthpiece. You're going to be my voice. YOU'RE GOING TO be the mercy seat. You're going to be the one with the word in your day. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Let's read our scripture just to just to strengthen this thought here in uh 1 John verse 1 uh 1:es 5-7. He says, "Now listen carefully. John's speaking here. This then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light. &gt;&gt; What is light? &gt;&gt; Light. When when when light comes open, you can see things. &gt;&gt; You can recognize that there's something there. &gt;&gt; And God is light. And in him is no darkness at all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if we say that we have fellowship with him, &gt;&gt; oh, there's a listen, a lot of churches. &gt;&gt; Oh, they're praising Jesus. Hallelujah. Glory to God. They're saying, but but listen, if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, &gt;&gt; we lie. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's you you you don't you don't know it. You you may not be aware of it, but you're actually lying. And do not the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if we walk in the light, now pay attention. If we walk in the light as he is in the light, &gt;&gt; in other words, if you're walking in the in the in the present truth where he is, &gt;&gt; as he is in the light, not just, you know, man-made light, oh, praise God. Come into the church. You, you know, just put your name on the membership and you can be a member of God's economy. You might be a member of some economy, but you're not a part of the body of Christ if you deny his word. Amen. Praise God. And there's a there's many. But listen, he says, "We have fellowship one with another. And the blood now, he is he is in the light. We have fellowship one with another. And the blood of Jesus Christ, his son, cleanses us from all sin." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, just think about what I said about the woman that touched the hem of his garment. There's fellowship. True fellowship comes when we walk in the light as he is in the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the word for your day, &gt;&gt; recognizing what Christ is doing now. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as a result of all that, you can be washed of your sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can be healed of your sickness. &gt;&gt; You, you know, people wonder why this thing just, you know, this sickness in my life. Listen, there's some sort of an unbelief. It could be just a an understanding, just a thought process that that we hold on to, some sort of a tradition that we hang on to. We're not willing to let go of that of that tradition that we were, you know, maybe brought up under, you know, well, my father was this and, you know, my father WAS A CATHOLIC, MY MOTHER WAS A CATHOLIC, MY GRANDFATHER was a Catholic, I'm I was born into the Catholic church, I'm a Catholic. What about if God comes and opens your understanding &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden this window of light opens up and you start to see the word? &gt;&gt; You say, "Wait a minute here. Why Why am I understanding and seeing this as clear as a bell?" Why? What? All of a sudden now, you know, the trinity doesn't make sense anymore. &gt;&gt; Because all of a sudden now you realize when God Jesus said, "I and the father are one. The word was made flesh. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word what &gt;&gt; was God. &gt;&gt; Wasn't a second part of God. Wasn't the was God. And the word was made flesh &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us. He came to his own and his own received him not. They couldn't recognize. They were blinded. Amen. But God has a people in the land in the last days who will not be deceived by a teaching of man, by a doctrine of man. They will go back to the word. They will let the Holy Ghost who Jesus himself said, "I will send you the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost." He's telling them straight, which is me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to come in you &gt;&gt; and I'm going to lead you into all truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're going to see and walk in the light. And now all of a sudden, we got fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, we only have fellowship in this hour. &gt;&gt; True fellowship &gt;&gt; is in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Because he is the word. &gt;&gt; And so to deny and say, "Oh, I got baptized when I was a baby." That ain't that don't mean nothing. &gt;&gt; Show me anywhere in the Bible where anybody was ever baptized as a baby. Jesus. We just showed what Jesus did. He says &gt;&gt; he laid hands on them and he blessed them. &gt;&gt; That's what he did. &gt;&gt; But he also said, "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." &gt;&gt; And so, you got to believe and know that God is God before you can even be baptized. &gt;&gt; Because baptism is an outward expression of something that's taken place on the inside. a revelation that oh my God, I got to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ where there's 8,000 baptisms in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Somebody can show me anywhere where anybody was ever baptized in the titles titles &gt;&gt; of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; I'll believe you. It ain't in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Nowhere. &gt;&gt; Jesus was right there. He had risen right there in in Matthew. I know they'll use that that that that scripture Matthew 28:19 where Jesus says, "Go ye into all the world." But listen, read it. &gt;&gt; He said just before he said that, he said, "All power has been given unto me &gt;&gt; in heaven and on earth." &gt;&gt; Is there any other power? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Is No. No. Is there any? He said all power. Didn't he say that? &gt;&gt; In heaven and on earth. Now go ye into all the world, baptizing them in the name. &gt;&gt; He didn't say names. He saidn name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. And Peter was right there when he when he told the disciples that. And on the day of Pentecost, what Peter just walks out and plainly decides to be rebellious and say, "Repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." Why didn't he say the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost? because he had a revelation that Jesus Christ was God &gt;&gt; and that his name is Jesus and that there's no other name whereby man must be saved. &gt;&gt; Isaiah says it. He says there's no other there's no other savior &gt;&gt; beside me &gt;&gt; before me, after me. I am the Lord God. I am one. &gt;&gt; He wanted to make it clear so that the people could know. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's walking in the light. our fellowship in Christ as he walks in the light. Amen. That's how we have fellowship. True real fellowship in the word of God. Amen. Listen, I can have fellowship with you when you know we go out and we have dinner together and we can talk and you know, but but but fellowship is around the revealed word for your day. &gt;&gt; It's where Jesus Christ is in the midst of your fellowship. He's the focus of your fellowship. He's he's he's all of your fellowship because you've recognized the word for your day. Amen. And so we need to understand that sons of God are from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're genes of God. &gt;&gt; They will understand each other. Listen, when listen, a deep call to the deep, if you've got Listen, if God brings forth children, they got to be gods. &gt;&gt; Amen. So a son of God is actually a God is a part of God is part of the the the the reality of God has the mind of God the spirit of God and they have the unity &gt;&gt; that comes with knowing one another as God. &gt;&gt; That's why he says on that day you shall know that I am in the father ye in me and I in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. One. Praise God. Hallelujah. Let's read our quote here from Satan's Eden. He says here now that's the way God was in the beginning. Every son of God and every daughter of God was in God at the beginning. You don't remember it now, but you were there. He know it &gt;&gt; and he wanted you to become. He wanted you to manifest. That's what he's saying there. He wanted you to manifest so that so that he could contact you. &gt;&gt; How's he going to contact you? By the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; How you going to know that it's him? By the word. &gt;&gt; You're not going to listen to a tradition of man. You're going to listen to the word &gt;&gt; because he is the word. That's the only way he contacts children of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And look, he goes on to speak with you, to love you, and to shake your hands. You know that when we have true fellowship in the Holy Ghost and we've welcomed him into the midst of our fellowship that you as a son of God, me as a son of God, you as a daughter of God, we shake hands. &gt;&gt; We're shaking hands with God. &gt;&gt; Listen, you're going to have to come to that understanding one way or the other &gt;&gt; because that's his desire. His desire was not to come here and say, "I'm going to take you to heaven and you're all going to go there and you're all going to have a a nice wonderful time." No, no, no, no. That's not what the plan was. The plan from the very beginning was that he wanted to have a family of God men and women on earth. &gt;&gt; This is why we're going to the millennium. Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why the 7,000th year is all about ruling here on earth for another thousand years with Christ. &gt;&gt; The saints shall rule and reign with Christ here on earth as God men and God women. &gt;&gt; That was his true desire. Not to take you into a a paradise or a heaven somewhere where everything is is is all rosy and everything is fun. No, read the scriptures. Look to see what he's actually saying. What what what is is uh uh you know been been given to us by the word for our day. This whole series on adoption is about God calling and placing sons and daughters of God positionally &gt;&gt; into the age that they're in &gt;&gt; so that they can produce the word that was ordained for this age. We're not looking to to reproduce Luther's age. We're not looking to produce Wesley's age. We're not looking to produce Pentecost. &gt;&gt; We're not look we're not interested in speaking in tongues. Does it happen? Sure, it happens. But when it does happen, it happens in the proper order. It happens where somebody speaks and and it's not some language that you can't understand. You may not understand it, but somebody understands that language because then it gets perfectly ined. Yes, &gt;&gt; that's proper speaking in tongues and interpretation. So, we're not interested in in in, you know, in the emotions. We're interested in the word for our day. &gt;&gt; What the word is supposed to produce in our day. Amen. Go to the next quote. He says, "Now, now to be a true Christian," Amen. He says, "You have to be the same." In other words, he's saying if you got a Christian is Christlike. Yes, &gt;&gt; that's what the word Christian means. So, you got to be like Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to be a son in his image. &gt;&gt; Now, we don't want to forget that all that he was, I'm identified with him. I'm identified with him. He says, notice he is in me and I in him. Notice then every Christian that's a real genuine Christian was with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy before there was a foundation of the world. We were identified in the immortal realms of God with God. &gt;&gt; Look 10 million years before the world was ever formed. This is Christianity. This is the gospel. &gt;&gt; You go and tell somebody that listen, you you're NOT YOU WERE IN AN ACCIDENT. &gt;&gt; Your life might have been a problem. You might have been born under the wrong parents. You could have had all kinds of situations. You could have BEEN A DRUG ADDICT. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN WHATEVER. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN A PROSTITUTE. OH, GLORY TO GOD. LISTEN, GOD, when Jesus was here on earth, he says, "I'm not going to th those that are righteous." those that were righteous, they were standing right in front of him and saying, "We are the sons of Abraham. We are the children of Abraham." Jesus looked at them and says, "You're the you're the children of the devil." Rebuke them. &gt;&gt; He told them straight, "By your traditions, &gt;&gt; your teachings, &gt;&gt; your ways of teaching the people and and interpreting my word, you've made it of none effect to the people." Amen. &gt;&gt; You go to somebody these days and you say, "Hey, have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?" &gt;&gt; They don't even understand what what do you mean Holy Ghost? Just like Paul when he came to those disciples, they were they were all praising Jesus. They were in church. &gt;&gt; But he says, "Wait a minute here. I know you guys are praising the Lord." He says, "But I see something uh you know, have you received the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; since you believed? &gt;&gt; You mean you could be a believer? You could you could claim Christianity. You could be, but you ain't got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They said, "Yeah, we were baptized, you know, according to John, you know, no, no, John baptized unto repentance &gt;&gt; to receive him &gt;&gt; that would come after, which is Christ who will baptize you with the fire of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. And right there and then, they recognize, my God, I haven't even been properly baptized. And they were baptized in the Read it. Acts 19. In the name of the Lord Jesus, and the Holy Ghost came upon them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God honors his word, doesn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. It doesn't matter what your condition was. When he comes, he comes to his seed. &gt;&gt; He says, "My sheep hear my voice." &gt;&gt; Amen. No other will they follow. They'll recognize the word for their day. They'll realize that I'm here now. They're looking for the coming of the Lord. Oh, he's coming. He's coming. Guess what? &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; He's present. &gt;&gt; He's under the five-fold ministry preaching the word of God to the sons and daughters of God, placing them positionally in the place where they're supposed to rightfully be placed. &gt;&gt; You could be in the wrong CHURCH THIS MORNING. YOU COULD BE IN THE WRONG uh family this morning. You you THOUGHT, "OH, I I'M A SON OF OF OH, I can't I can't cause a disturbance in my home. Oh, boy. If I come home, listen, I remember the disturbance that I caused when when the Holy Ghost came into my life. There was wildfire ALL AROUND ME. MY FAMILY THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT. SOMETHING HAD COME INTO MY HEART. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A REALITY of the word. There was nobody that could tell me that what I was READING WAS RIGHT THERE, CLEAR." I said, "No, but can't you see this?" &gt;&gt; But look, &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Blessed are your eyes. &gt;&gt; Unto you it has been given to know the mystery." &gt;&gt; The mysteries, &gt;&gt; the mystery of him. &gt;&gt; That's the great mystery. &gt;&gt; The great mystery is is like, you know, we we could talk about Paul. We we preached it here in the last few services where Paul says that you might know what is the fellowship of the mystery &gt;&gt; that is in Christ where unto you were predestinated unto this &gt;&gt; from before the foundation. See God could see down the road that when this word would come in its dispensation in its season and it would come to you &gt;&gt; would take it and you would say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I re I receive that and I reject THE TRADITION. I REJECT the teachings of man. I am going to make God's word my absolute from this day on. &gt;&gt; You try that one time and you see if God doesn't honor and back his word. &gt;&gt; God will always heaven and earth will pass away. But my word, you take it, you can stand on it. Amen. Glory to God. Listen, he goes on here. He says, he says, 10 million years before the world was ever formed, I was back there with him. And if I got eternal life, I was there with him. I was identified with him. When the morning stars sang together and the sons shouted for joy, &gt;&gt; I was there because you take eternal. &gt;&gt; No beginning, no end. &gt;&gt; For you to have eternal life means that you always had it. &gt;&gt; No beginning, no end. &gt;&gt; That's what eternal is. &gt;&gt; We need to understand that. And that revelation, once you catch that revelation, you realize, whoa, wait a minute here. You mean I was already &gt;&gt; justified &gt;&gt; in my age, &gt;&gt; but I just needed to hear the word. &gt;&gt; I just needed to hear what the word said about me &gt;&gt; in my time and in my age. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's all it was. Amen. Glory to God. And when you come to a place like that where you have recognized you, you know you because faith is not something you can put your finger on. &gt;&gt; Faith is something that's revealed to you. &gt;&gt; It's looking to the unseen. You you know faith is a substance. But yet when it comes into your heart the gate Jesus said look at just look at what he said to to to to Peter when he came down. He was on earth. Jesus just finished praying, comes amongst his disciples. Just the same question that he would ask today. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Who do the churches and the people and all these different uh denominations say that I am? &gt;&gt; Oh, some of them said that you're, you know, John the Baptist. Some say you're Jeremiah. Some say you're you're a you're a prophet. Some say, and he looks to Peter. He says, "Peter, who do you say that I am?" He says, "Thou art the Christ. Thou art the anointed word. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that's what Christ means. &gt;&gt; Christ means anointed word. The word that was supposed to come in our day and we've recognized it. &gt;&gt; You're that one. You're that Messiah. You you you're you're you're the you you know, you're the you're the Messiah. Look what Jesus turned around and says, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you. No teacher, no seminary, NO CHURCH, NO PASTOR, no priest until you come into a personal revelation of Jesus Christ, who he is, you and him. &gt;&gt; That's what he's talking about. And look what he says. He says, "But my father, my spirit, &gt;&gt; my anointing, my the Holy Ghost." Whenever he says father, he's talking about that other office &gt;&gt; that he is because his whole mystery was to condescend from God down into man to where he could have fellowship with his own attributes. &gt;&gt; He says that's who revealed it to you. &gt;&gt; And watch what he says. And I'm going to build my church that way. &gt;&gt; That's how this church is built. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This church is built upon the spiritual revelation of God. revealing his thoughts directly to the individual. &gt;&gt; Not the whole church. &gt;&gt; In every church, there's three kinds of believers. &gt;&gt; Everyone. &gt;&gt; You got the the makeel believer, you got the unbeliever, and you got the true believer. &gt;&gt; The true believer, she's walking by revelation on the word of God because it's been revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll build my church. And look what he says. And the gates of hell will not prevail against that revelation when I give it to you. No devil in hell is going to pull it out of you. &gt;&gt; No way. He says it's all yours. It's because you've looked to the unseen and you've recognized. Now here, let's look at this next quote here. Looking to the unseen. He says here, "How much can you walk around?" Listen. He says here, sorry. He says, "Look at Joshua. Look at Joshua." Now, how many believes we're in the Joshua commission? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joshua was a type of the Holy Ghost taking the children into the promised land. &gt;&gt; That's the hour that we're in. Joshua, under the five-fold ministry, Joshua is all about placing. Go back and read it. The whole book of Joshua, it's all about placing the sons and daughters of God into their portions of land. Amen. He says, "Now watch. Before one rock ever come out of the building of the walls of Jericho, Joshua walked around the walls shouting the victory. Oh, glory to God. Amen. He he he could shout the victory just like the sons of God when they were shouting. He says, "FOR BY FAITH HE SAW THE VICTORY." &gt;&gt; He knowed the walls was coming down. &gt;&gt; I don't care what's around your life right now. I don't care what situation you might have to face &gt;&gt; after you leave this place. Listen, the word of God has been laid into your heart and faith takes an anchor. You're going to know victory is yours. He knowed the walls was coming down and he armed his men and walked around and around and around Jericho for seven days in full armor. Hallelujah. Aren't you glad? We've come through seven church ages &gt;&gt; and now we've got the full armor of God &gt;&gt; to recognize what the fullness of the word is to produce in this day and in this hour. Amen. He says, "What doing?" Because he was looking at the unseen, it was a promise God made to him. &gt;&gt; He knew that whatever situation &gt;&gt; and you can rest upon that. You can take the word of God this morning. You can place it in front of the enemy and say, "You you tell me what this says." &gt;&gt; And if you can tell me that this is wrong, I'll believe you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the gates of hell will never prevail against God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Being revealed in your heart. Amen. Look, he goes on here. Next slide. He says, "How much can you walk around a wheelchair?" Now, he's talking about situations in your life. &gt;&gt; Just type it, saints. How much can you walk around cancer? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. He says, "How much can you walk around sin?" SHOUTING THE VICTORY THAT GOD GIVE THE PROMISE. AMEN. When you can see how who is invisible when that pulsation comes into your heart and begins to pulsate I'm it says I'm the Lord who heals all thy diseases. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says when you can see that everything else weakens away. &gt;&gt; Joshua looked at the unseen and he walked around the walls believing that it would happen. All it depends on is what you're looking at, brother, sister. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What are you looking at this morning? &gt;&gt; If you're looking at the word, you're going to see your name in the in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; If you're looking at a tradition or a teaching of man, you're going to be in confusion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to look to Jesus. You need to look to the unseen. You need to have that same shout in you that Joshua had in him. the same shout. You where do YOU THINK THAT SHOUT came in Joshua when they listen when God told them to go around the wall seven times? He says on the seventh day, he says everybody shout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because the walls are coming down. &gt;&gt; The victory is yours. We are going to receive the promise of the body change. Amen. We are going to receive our body change. We're going to receive our our paradise. We're going to receive our promised word &gt;&gt; which is the promised land. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. Next slide. He says here, "Dear God, the great and mighty God, who formed all things by the power of his spirit and has brought Jesus Christ, his only begotten son, who freely died for we sinners, the just for the unjust, to reconcile us back into this marvelous fellowship that we have again with God." Amen. That's what the word has reconciled us back to, saints, back to God himself. Amen. as we are taught in the blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundations of the world when the morning stars sang together. Amen. Glory to God. And the sons of God shouted for joy way back before the foundations of the world. How do we know that that wasn't at the same time? Now pay attention that the lamb was slain. Think about that. Now when I seen that, I said, "Hallelujah." THAT WHEN GOD in his great thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing in our salvation through Jesus, how do we know that that wasn't when the lamb was slain? When was the lamb slain? &gt;&gt; Before the foundations of the world. When were the sons of God shouting? &gt;&gt; Before the foundations of the world. What do you think they were shouting about? Any idea maybe what they were shouting about? &gt;&gt; Was it because they saw the plan of redemption? &gt;&gt; Because this is what this is all about, saints. &gt;&gt; This is not about anybody can just be saved. Yes, those who receive Jesus Christ as their savior shall be saved. God promises it according to his word. But not all are going to have are going to be the ones whose names were written in the lamb's book. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now remember, &gt;&gt; the lamb that was slain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were rejoicing before the foundation of the world because the lamb that was slain had a book. &gt;&gt; John was was was was overwhelmed one day. You can go back and read it in chapter 4. In chapter 5 of Revelation, he said there was no man on earth, below the earth, on the earth, above the earth, no man. &gt;&gt; Man. That's why Jesus had to come and become man. The word was made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that there could be a reverse to bring back the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; This is about the plan of redemption. The lamb had a book in his hand and in that book there was names written in that lamb's book. Listen, go back and study the scriptures. The Bible talks about the book of life. &gt;&gt; And then the Bible talks about a part in the book of life which is the lamb's book of life. Those are the attributes sons and daughters of God that were ordained before the foundations of the world to receive this word to bring it to this dispensation. Every age had a portion of word all through the seist listen when Christ when Christ died when he came and became man he took on human flesh because man had to there had to be a man die. Yes. &gt;&gt; So what he did was when he went to Gethsemane because remember he was not born the same way you and I were born. &gt;&gt; That's why you must be born again. &gt;&gt; You must have the same experience as Mary. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. And so when he was born, he was born God man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He was God man. &gt;&gt; Jesus. That's why he could do the things that he did. That's why the winds WOULD OBEY HIM. THAT'S why he could speak to the to the dead and they would rise up. What was that when he went to the tomb of Lazarus after four days dead in the tomb? &gt;&gt; It'd already been rotten in there. He called his name Lazarus. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Listen, I don't care what condition you're in. &gt;&gt; When God calls your name, I don't care how long you think you're you're you you've been far you've been you've been, you know, you're so far away from God. You're not far enough away from God that he can't call you back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you hear your name, he'll bring you in. Amen. Glory to God. It's because your name was in the lamb's book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, I believe there was a shout because they saw something that had been revealed that the lamb could take the book. Oh, glory to God. We're going to be looking at that more next week. We're going to we're going to dig deeper into this ministry that God has given us in this day and in this hour. Amen. Glory to God. So here now, we need to recognize that God in his thinking, his great thinking, seen us shouting and rejoicing in our salvation through Jesus. And I believe it was because we saw the plan. &gt;&gt; But now we've got to fulfill the plan. Now, we've got to take our position in the plan. &gt;&gt; We've got to allow the word for our day to place us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. And that's why now we want to look at why God had to send a prophet. &gt;&gt; Why the word could only come to a prophet. That's right. &gt;&gt; And if you go back and you study the seven church ages, you will see clearly that God sent a messenger to each of those seven church ages. Paul was the first messenger. &gt;&gt; All the way down to where William Branham in 1933, he's he's on the earth. He's he's baptizing people at the Ohio River. And out of nowhere, this pillar of fire comes in and a voice speaks out and says, "As John the Baptist was the first runner of Jesus Christ for his first coming, your ministry, your message, &gt;&gt; your ministry will be the front runner for the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; There was witnesses. There's there's newspaper articles on this. I'm not talking about something, you know, you know, fanatical here. You can go back and do the research yourself. Yeah, you'll go back there and you'll see how the enemy has tried to mar God's prophet, but you show me where where they didn't mar John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; They got so upset with him, they took his head off. &gt;&gt; So don't try to tell me, oh, you know, he's a false prophet, this and that. No, no, no. You search the scriptures for yourself &gt;&gt; and you see if Malachi 4:5 doesn't tell you that I'll send you Elijah the prophet before that great and dreadful day of the Lord to turn us back to the word. &gt;&gt; That was the purpose of Malachi 4:5. And then and then Revelations 10 1-7 where the word where the mystery of God was going to be unveiled &gt;&gt; to where this message today this is this is our message by the way. &gt;&gt; We're not listen we're a Christian church because we're like Christ. But we are in a new dispensation. &gt;&gt; We are not in the Leodysian church age any longer. &gt;&gt; Not this church. not the body of Christ. She's now in what's called the bride age. &gt;&gt; The age where Christ and the church become one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Remember there was there was 10 virgins, right? And the bridegroom's call said, "Hey, the the bridegroom cometh." But there was five virgin. Listen, they were all virgins. In other words, they were all, you know, clean living. They were all praising God. They were all believing Jesus Christ. But five of them had no oil. What is oily ghost? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. They didn't have the Holy Ghost for their day. &gt;&gt; Maybe they were under another dispensation. Maybe they were somewhere else. But they didn't recognize the word for their day. Because the ones that had the Holy Ghost, they had the oil. They recognized, "Hey, I got to get to church on Sunday because there's oil pouring down. Hallelujah. I'm going TO FILL UP. FILL my cup, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want the word for my day." That's the oil. That's the revelation of the hour. What is the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost is the spirit of God in you fulfilling his purpose in your life. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost does. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost just doesn't cause you to speak in tongues. No, it takes your life. &gt;&gt; It looks at your old life. It says, "Anything that's in there that's no good to me, I'm going to drop it off." &gt;&gt; You're going to have a hard time. Every birth is a mess. &gt;&gt; Okay? There's no way around it. But when the Holy Ghost comes, now his purpose starts to take over. Listen. Romans 8 28. All things work together for good to them that are called according to his purpose. So if you're wondering why certain things are not working out in your life, you need to look to see if they are lining up with his purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You can't be going off and saying, "Oh, young people, I'm going to be a movie star. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go to Hollywood and I'm going to be a movie star." How does that line up with the purpose of God in this day or this hour? or I'm going to be a fashion designer for for uh Pierre Laurentin or whatever their names are, Pierre Cardan or whatever. You know, how does that line up with with God's purpose in your life? If you are sincere and you want the Holy Ghost, when you get the Holy Ghost, it'll change your desire for the things of the world. &gt;&gt; It'll change your purpose for this life. &gt;&gt; Your purpose will become the word. &gt;&gt; You'll want to fellowship on the word. You'll want to read the prophet's messages. You'll want to hear what he said because God sent a prophet for that very purpose. Now, let's go on here. Now, uh let's let's move on here. He says, "Now, in um Srian church age, allelujah, listen carefully." Now, now it's not up here, okay? He says, 'Now according to the word, this is from the Samriian church age, the bride will be chosen before the foundations of the world. &gt;&gt; This choosing of the bride was purposed in himself. God chooses his own church. You listen, you don't choose God. &gt;&gt; Oh, I went to the altar and I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus. No, no. He was searching you out. &gt;&gt; You finally surrendered &gt;&gt; and you came to the present truth &gt;&gt; of the word of God. It's God choosing you because he knew you would receive the word because you were the word for this day. &gt;&gt; That's why word meets word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so he says in Ephesians 1:9 and in Romans 9:11 it says that the purpose of God according to election might stand. He says you can't read it any other way. the heart, the purpose, the eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world. Watch carefully. He says now and see this before there was even a speck of stardust before God was God. Imagine before God was even God which God is an object of worship and adoration and no one uh and and no one was there to worship him. So he was at that time only potentially God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Think about it in the beginning. Amen. And he known only as eternal spirit but the bride was already in his mind. You were already in his thoughts &gt;&gt; because he wanted to express this thought of being a family, being a father. How do you how do you become a father? You need a son. I didn't become a father until my first child was born. Amen. And God didn't become father until Adam was expressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So here now he says uh um he says yes. And the bride was already in his mind. Yes, she was. She was existing in his thoughts. And what about those thoughts of God? They are eternal. Are they not the eternal thoughts of God? Let me ask you, are the thoughts of God eternal? &gt;&gt; Yes, they are. If you can see this, you can see many things. Yes, &gt;&gt; you'll see you if you can just get your mind out of out of uh you know having a beginning and an end and that you know this sickness that there's no end to it, you know, because you you look at things from beginning to end. That's the human mind, the way it works. &gt;&gt; Put your mind into the thoughts of the eternal God, you'll see a lot more. You'll see so much more. God is unchangeable in both essence and behavior. We have studied that and proven that already. God is infinite in his abilities. So therefore, he as God must be omniscient. And if he's omniscient, then he he is not now learning, nor is he taking counsel even within himself, nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge. Do we have an understanding of God here? &gt;&gt; God doesn't have new thoughts. &gt;&gt; God doesn't decide, I'm going to save you today and lose you tomorrow. &gt;&gt; No. God doesn't run his business that way. Amen. Praise God. He's omniscient. He doesn't have a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning. The because he is God. Thus the thoughts of God are eternal. They are real. They are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and a part of God. &gt;&gt; And that's what you are as an attribute son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now let's bring it into we want to we want to get to to to where we we need to recognize the prophet. Amen. Now, this is what the prophet did for us. That's why all these quotes that I'm reading, they they come from from William Branham because as a prophet, he was able to go into the back part of God's mind to know exactly who we are, where we come from, where we are, and where we're going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why, you know, the people that don't understand that God said, "Look at John. Look, look at Luther, okay? Martin Luther. There's Lutheran churches all over the world. Why? Because God sent a Martin Luther to receive revelation on the just shall live by faith. And it produced a movement. And today, you got thousands of churches all over the world, but they're not calling him a cult because he's all part of the reformation. You see, but when the word any time that the word came in the present stage of its ministry, go back and check it yourself. The people, the majority always rejected it. &gt;&gt; Go back. &gt;&gt; I'm not telling you something that isn't true. They always rejected the truth for their day, the majority of the people. But it wasn't meant for the majority. It was meant for the sons and daughters of God &gt;&gt; that were in that particular age or dispensation. &gt;&gt; They would receive the word for their day. They would manifest the word for their day. They received an anointing to manifest the word for their day. And God God moved on. That's why in the dark ages, all those heretics they called Christian heretics, they fed them to the lions. They put them into the gladiators. They chopped them into pieces. They had an anointing on them to fulfill the portion of the word that they were for that day. And they went in there praising God &gt;&gt; because they had a revelation of God for their day. &gt;&gt; You understand? You see the importance of recognizing your messenger, the messenger that God sends to to your age in particular because he and especially in this age where now the fullness of the word was going to be made known where God was now going to you know that you know the lamb that was slain from before the foundations of the world. He took a book out of the one that sat in the throne. He took that book. What was that book? It was the book that Adam lost back in the Garden of Eden, which was the book of inheritance. That's why we're adopted sons of God. We're being positionally placed because our names were in the book. &gt;&gt; And the reason why you come out of denominational churches and you come out of man-made teaching, you come out of new age movement is because God is calling you. &gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about. son, the calling of the sons of God, wherever they are, they got to come out of that denominational church organized religion because Jesus was never ever in it. Never. &gt;&gt; He rebuked it. &gt;&gt; He told them, "Because of your traditions, you've made my word no effect to the people." &gt;&gt; But he went on, "My sheep hear my voice." &gt;&gt; He's still He's still speaking to us today. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. And so now he goes on here. He says, "Now then here we are coming to a conclusion. As the eternal logos, God was manifest in the Son and Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." Now what does the scripture say? All that was in God, God poured into Christ. and all that was in Christ, God is pouring into the church. It's all God. That's why Jesus could say, "You'll know on that day that the father is in me, I in him, you in me, and I in you." &gt;&gt; Because we're going to become one. &gt;&gt; The whole plan of the family coming together. &gt;&gt; This is what we're This is the message of the hour, saints. Amen. And so here now he goes on he says and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and there thereby gained the title of son. So in other words when the spirit of god was in Adam in the beginning he was in the image of god he was god man in spirit form but he didn't have a body yet. That's why he he took of the dust of the earth so that Adam could till the soil. In other words, so that he could have five five senses and then he created the the the flesh man. Adam, okay? But he was flesh and bone. That's why Jesus said flesh and bone when he was here on earth and he had been resurrected. He didn't say flesh and blood because the blood is the Holy Ghost. The the blood is the life. It's eternal. It's It doesn't have an ending or a beginning. The bodies that we're going to have here on earth are going to be theophony bodies combined with glorified bodies so that we can dwell on this earth. Theophony bodies is what Jesus was in the beginning when he was expressed let us. Who was us when when God was speaking and said let us? It was him in in the word him in the logos. him and his thoughts. People people don't understand that because he was the self-existent one. &gt;&gt; And so when he said, "Let us make man in our image." He wanted to make man to express it on the earth. Because he had created the earth for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So that his family could dwell on it. &gt;&gt; This is the plan of redemption. This is the mystery of God. This is what has baffled the people all the way up until this day. If you tell the people this is Christianity and they've got some representation in them and they have that awareness, they're going to say, "What you mean I've been caught up into all of this Christian culture and religious?" We are not even religious. People say, "Oh, you're so religious." I said, "I'm not religious. I I might be spiritual in that I've recognized almighty God, okay? And I understand the plan of redemption. I understand that I was I I was with him before this whole thing here. &gt;&gt; And now I'm being redeemed back to who I originally was, &gt;&gt; a son of God. I'm being called back to my original position, &gt;&gt; what God had in his thoughts before. And so here he goes eternal in his thoughts in our turn. Now he goes now even so we okay let me start back. Let me go. And that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and there thereby gained the title of son. Even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are sons of God. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; Even as we are socalled that's why we're calling sons of God. We're coming to our We're coming out of our amnesia &gt;&gt; to who we really are in this day and in this hour. Amen. So, let's move on here. You're going to give me some time, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. We got time between now and the and the dinner. So, let let me finish what I've got here. Amen. Let's go to the next scripture in Thessalonians. Now, we kind of got into this last week, right? And we and this is where we're now continuing from. But the Lord added, you know, some some inspiration there, you know, for for this morning. So here now he says, "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall re shall be shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. Now, this is the scripture that that describes the the rapture of the church, okay? That we which are alive and remain, okay, there's going to be a shout. Now, that shout, I'm going to say it straight out. That shout started for this age in 1963 when the mighty angel met William Branham on Mount Sunset in 1963. This is the message of the hour. This is what's bringing us the faith for this fulfillment here because he comes down with the voice of the archangel. Now, if you go back and read Revelations 10, that that in the days of the voice, well, first it starts out and it talks about that there was a there was one that stood on the on the land and on the sea and it was the mighty angel. Okay? And he had a cloud, a rainbow over his head. Amen. And he had a book in his hand and the book was open. Amen. And he said, "Time shall be no more." And and then it goes on and it said that when you go down to to chap to verse 10, it says, "And in the days verse seven, in the days of the voice of the the the angel, okay, the mystery of God would be finished." So now we need to understand that the mighty angel that came down in 1963 with the book, remember who had the book? The lamb. Who was worthy to open the book? the lamb. And so now here comes the mighty angel himself, which is Christ. &gt;&gt; That was the second coming of Christ. That's why you see us wear these cloud pins because that cloud showed itself in 1963 over Sunset Mountain. And to this day, science cannot explain it. But it was the mighty God himself in the form of seven angels come down to open the seven seals of of the book that had been sealed. Now the mighty angel was God himself come down to meet an earthly angel. &gt;&gt; William Brham was in a prophetic ministry. He was the prophet of Malachi 4:5. And the word of the Lord always comes to the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the son of man, which was Christ, was coming to a son of man, which was the prophet on the earth. Because the the mighty angel was now the the lamb was now going to open those seven seals that were containing the mystery of God, &gt;&gt; which had been hidden from the foundations of the world, which was God's plan to have a family here on earth with all the names of those that were in that book. &gt;&gt; Right? But there had to be a prophet because the word of the Lord always comes to the prophets. And he received now the opening over the next week in in March. Okay. After this visitation in March, he set up to have these meetings to open the seven seals. Okay? And during each of those nights, an angel would meet with William Brham in his office. Yeah, you're hearing it right. &gt;&gt; An angel. &gt;&gt; Because he didn't know what was written under those seven seals. &gt;&gt; He had an idea. But he said, "Boy, thank God that the mighty angel came down and sent those seven angels to come and open each one of those seals to me &gt;&gt; so that I could understand what was written under those seals." If you want to know and you want to look into it deeper, go back and read the revelation of the seven seals. You will be able to see what was all the mysteries that were written within there. &gt;&gt; But the mystery that we are feasting on now is the mystery of Christ which was under the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Okay, that is something that that it needs to be revealed personal to each and every one of us. I don't mean to be confusing, but there's only so much that I can say. All right. You're going to because the the the opening even even what I'm saying right now and everything that I'm speaking on, if it's not by revelation revealed to you, it's it's going to be confusing to you. &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. But remember, Jesus promised that he would that he would build his church on divine revelation. He would reveal it to you personal. &gt;&gt; So when that when you read the word, it'll make sense to you. It'll it'll it'll speak right back to you. Just understand what I you know I can only speak to you what I'm what what I'm experiencing. And those that are sons and daughters of God, they know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; The word speaks right clearly back into your heart. The revelation of the word becomes a reality. Amen. And so in that 7-day period, God un God revealed all the mysteries from from serpent seed to Godhead to all kinds of mysteries that that were that were kind of known but the people were confused on. Okay. But in that seventh seal contained, because if you go back to Revelations 10, you'll hear that there was seven thunders that uttered their voices when the mighty angel came down. And John was told not to write what was under those thunders because it was not yet time &gt;&gt; for it to be revealed, but it is now. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to understand what was in those written what was what was under those se what was under that seventh seal and what was uttered in those thunders &gt;&gt; because the voice of God thunders. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's and and there's there's a there's a revelation behind it &gt;&gt; and it's something that has to be revealed personally. It's not something that you can just give to somebody. Amen. And so let's go to the next quote here. So, three things happen. A voice, a shout, a voice, a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears. We're talking about the rapture. &gt;&gt; Now, a shout, Jesus does all three of them when he's descending. &gt;&gt; He descended in 1963. &gt;&gt; The shout is still now the shout. Listen what he says is the shout. He says Jesus, now he's descending a shout. What is a shout? It is the message going forth. &gt;&gt; This is the shout that we're talking about right here, right now. &gt;&gt; You hear me shouting. Maybe last week you heard brother Mike shouting. You heard him, you know, get all excited because there was a shout inside of him that needed to be released because something was revealed in his heart that caused him to shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is what's happening to the sons and daughters of God. They've received a word for their day that causes them to shout. And the shout is this message. &gt;&gt; This is the this is the the the the shout that's in us. Amen. I can only express it to the best of my ability. Amen. It's the message going forth first. The living bread of life bringing forth the bride. Did you hear what that said? &gt;&gt; So this shout is actually a shout to the sons of God to bring them into their positions. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's to bring forth the bride, &gt;&gt; those that will recognize the word for their day. This is the only thing that excites true Christians in this hour. &gt;&gt; There is no message outside of this message &gt;&gt; because this is the message that produces rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; This is the only message that's going to give you a body change. You can talk about the rapture all day long, but if you don't have a revelation on the rapture and how God is going to quicken you that by the same listen Jesus said if Paul said if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you, it will speed up your molecules. &gt;&gt; It'll speed up your molecules to a point where you will have a dimensional change &gt;&gt; in the moment. In the twinkling of an eye, you're going to put on immortality. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to understand this is a reality. &gt;&gt; They go to church, they talk about the rapture, but they have NO IDEA &gt;&gt; THAT GOD SENT A PROPHET THAT WOULD INTRODUCE THE MIGHTY ANGEL HIMSELF, &gt;&gt; THE SPIRIT OF God himself so that it could be transposed down unto the bride, &gt;&gt; so that the word could be given to the bride. Amen. He was just the wave sheath. William Brandham was the first son to come into manifestation. My God, we can sit here and talk about the supernatural that happened around his life. &gt;&gt; Let's let's go on here. I'm going to keep you another 15 20 minutes. Okay, &gt;&gt; that's it. Amen. He says, "Now God has a way of doing things and he's never changed his policy. He never changes. He's the unchanging God." You believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you can trust him. &gt;&gt; Amen. We had a son of man ministry. The cloud showing the presence of God which started the shel ministry in 1963. Amen. The descending of the mighty angel was Christ coming into William Brham, a son of man, &gt;&gt; a prophet to reveal the seven seals. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when William Brham got behind that pulpit and preaching on those seals, there was a supernatural element that was in William Brandham that was preaching the word. &gt;&gt; It was the five-fold ministry. Amen. It was the starting of the shout of the message of the hour which would awaken the bride. &gt;&gt; You were not born yet. That's why, listen, when when when John saw those th those those uh thunders, he he was ready to write. &gt;&gt; He saw. He heard because he was a prophet. God showed him everything because he had written everything else. &gt;&gt; That's what the book of Revelation is all about. &gt;&gt; And he told John to write everything. But when that part came up, he said, "Don't write that." &gt;&gt; He says, you know why? Because you weren't here yet. &gt;&gt; You had to be born. the rest of the body, the the earth is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; There's there's sons of God that need to come. All that the father hath given me will come. &gt;&gt; Every last one of them, wherever they are, the last minute workers, they're going to come in. They're going to hear the word. They're going to come in. You had to be born. So that's why this faith that's being released now in this day is what's calling the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's what's bringing them out of their their their their their traditions. It's it's pulling them away from their their their their thinking, all their amnesia. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Remember the book that John was talking about? He said, "No man was found worthy to open that book. The lamb took the book and loose the seals thereof." So Christ descended into the prophet and then from there he must descend into the bride. &gt;&gt; That's it. He must come into you and me now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's the plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; That's the work of redemption. &gt;&gt; That was his plan from the beginning. &gt;&gt; That was the mystery of God that was hidden from the very beginning. &gt;&gt; Now the thunders are uttering their voice in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now you become the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen. Listen. He told John not to write, BUT GUESS WHAT HE told William Brandham? He said, "Pick up the pen." He says, "Right." &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, this is what I've been trying to tell you from the very beginning. Every seed will bring forth of its own kind." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're a son of God, you must come forth &gt;&gt; because you were in him before you came here. &gt;&gt; You go back and read that. You read about what what he wrote there and pick up your pen and write. You're going to see that it was the very mystery of God being revealed in you and me. He says you become the final voice. &gt;&gt; You become that voice in the Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. That's why the sons of God have to manifest. &gt;&gt; Amen. They have the shout in them. And when you recognize the importance of the opening of those seals and in particular the seventh seal which was the opening of the book, the mysteries unleashing the thoughts of God of who we actually were. That seventh seal, that's why when William Brandham went to preach those seals, he says, "I got to stop right here." Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm not I can't I'm not going to be the one to interpret this." &gt;&gt; Do you know that William Brandham never went beyond Revelations 10:7? &gt;&gt; He never read Revelations 10 8-11. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; You'll know. &gt;&gt; We'll look at that a little closer next week. &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to recognize the importance of the seventh seal being revealed. It's because it reveals who you really are. You are bound by circumstances of denominational teachings. &gt;&gt; You're bound by the traditions of man. But then God sends his word &gt;&gt; to speak through the five-fold ministry. What is Ephesians chapter 4? For the perfecting of the church, for the perfecting of the saints. to bring them out of their delusion, out of their amnesia, to bring them into the present stage of the word for their day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Traditions of Catholic teachings. You were trapped in drugs. You were trapped in addictions. You were you were one of the sons of God that Christ was going to to to descend into, but you didn't know it until you heard this message, Brother Phillip. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to understand the seventh seal and what it truly means to you as a son of God. &gt;&gt; I can't teach you that. &gt;&gt; I can only tell you what what what God has revealed in my heart, WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S become reality in my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. But once you experience it for yourself, you'll know exactly. And guess what? We'll both walk in the light together and we will have fellowship together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's where the true fellowship is. &gt;&gt; Amen. the message. Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's read the next quote here. He says in the rapture, Amos 3:7, he said he would do nothing on earth until first he revealed it it to his servants, the prophets. Amen. And just as certain as he promised it, he'll do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we've come through the church ages, but we're promised in the last days, according to Malachi 4, that there would be a return again, a prophet in the land. That's right. Notice his nature, what he would be like. Amen. Listen, William Brandham didn't go around bragging, I'm the prophet of Malachi 4. You'll never see him do that. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that the only time that Jesus revealed himself &gt;&gt; and said, "I am he," was to the woman at the well. &gt;&gt; You ever wonder about that? Oh, glory to God. I don't want to get ahead of myself. Hallelujah. But here now we are told that he's not going to do anything unless he reveals it through his servants, the prophets. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Next quote, he goes here in the token. He says, "God in every age, as I spoke last evening, he told the end from the beginning. He told what would be in each generation also God in the beginning. He told he says he says in sundried times he sent forth the prophets. When each time come for those things to happen for that age he sent forth prophets. And the word of the Lord always comes to his prophets. Amen. The prophet for that age. And each time the only thing that prophet did was to manifest exactly the promise for that age. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you want to know what is to take place in the age, then you have to see what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's as simple as that. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now watch. He goes on here and identified Christ of all ages. Every one of the prophets displayed God's characteristics because it picked up the word for that age and identified it. God interpreted his word of that age through the man. &gt;&gt; So whatever God wants to reveal, he's going to reveal it through a prophet &gt;&gt; in that particular age. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's it's he was the son of he was a son of man ministry. Praise God. Now go on next quote. Notice through the ages, the same way by his prophets, he has revealed himself. Them wasn't exactly prophets. They were gods. They were gods. He said so. For what they spoke was God's word. &gt;&gt; When a prophet said, "Thus sayaeth the Lord," that wasn't a man speaking. &gt;&gt; That was God speaking through a man. William Brandham anytime he said thus sayeth the Lord you go back you do your own research you check back doctor's affidavits dead brought back to life again truckloads of crutches and stretchers taken out of meetings because people came in in stretchers that were crippled from birth walking out of those meetings &gt;&gt; more supernatural took place under that ministry than than any other ministry on earth up until that time. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Go back and and and check the history. Amen. So he says here that wasn't exactly prophets. They were gods. He said so. For what they spoke was God's word. They were the flesh that God was veiled in. &gt;&gt; They were gods. Jesus said himself. Say, "How can you condemn me when I say I am the son of God?" and you owe and you and your own law says that them who the word of of the Lord came to was God's. But yet they condemned and they crucified Christ because because they knew that when he said, you know, this day this scripture is fulfilled, he was indirectly telling them that he was God. And Jesus said, why do you condemn me? He said be and they said we we we don't condemn you for the miracles that you're doing but we're condemning you for you are saying that you are God. &gt;&gt; You see they couldn't take that &gt;&gt; and that's what happens in every age when God comes in the form of his word they reject him. &gt;&gt; They can't receive him. And so next quote he says now so it was God formed in a man called a prophet. See and the word of the Lord came to this man. So it wasn't the prophet the prophet was the veil but the word was God. &gt;&gt; The man's word won't act like that. See what I mean? It cannot act in that manner. But potentially it was God. See, he was the word of God in the form of a man called a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice he never changed his nature. Only his form. God has never changed his nature. That's how we know that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He honors his word. Amen. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. So now the reason why I laid in all these quotes about God sending a prophet, now we want to just look closely here and see how it was that God vindicated this man. We need to see what God was trying to display through William Branham. Amen. So here now when you start to think look at go back I can't bring all the quotes but I can tell you he was one day squirrel hunting now God is God is showing us here what was produced in William Branham was now going to produce itself in us. &gt;&gt; We need to see that. Okay. And so William Branham had one day going squirrel hunting and the Holy Spirit comes that voice the angel that had met him so many times tells him where do you want the squirrels? He says speak them. &gt;&gt; And he was a man. &gt;&gt; But yet he was displaying something in the form of a God man. &gt;&gt; He was a man when he was there preaching the gospel. But when he spoke and said, "The squirrel is going to come up out of that tree and it's going to sit on that on that uh on that limb there." And and and he shot it. And there it came. Boom. Came right up. He shot it. Went and took it. It was actual squirrel. &gt;&gt; Spoken word into existence. &gt;&gt; That was God in a man. &gt;&gt; That was God vindicating his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was God when when when God showed him they'd gone fishing and a fish had died and the intrs of the fish, the hook had pulled out the intros of that fish and he was with a Jehovah Witness friend of his. And God showed him that he was going to that something was going to come back to life again. And he didn't quite understand what it was. And then the Holy Spirit came into the boat and said, "Speak to that fish and give that fish back its life." And he said that same voice he in his mind that same voice that had spoken to him and told him to speak to squirrels that was the same voice. So he looked at he says little fishy I GIVE YOU BACK your life in the name of Jesus Christ. That fish jumped, turned and dove right into the water &gt;&gt; dead for an hour. Why am I saying this? I'm not saying this to, you know, play supernatural and and and witchcraft and everything else. No, I'm I'm showing you through the word of God that God sent a prophet whom the word of the Lord came to to vindicate in this 20th century what he was going to do in this race of people. &gt;&gt; Amen. in this dispensation, in the people that would receive the word for their day when he was on that Colorado mountain and they were stuck up there hunting for 4 days and a storm decides to come in and that storm came in with with a vengeance. It covered them within minutes and brother Brandham was stuck there in the storm and the brothers were all back at the camp. And then the Holy Spirit, that same God, the angel of the Lord came and said to him, he says, "What would you want? You you the way you say it, you speak to that storm, the way you say it, that's the way it's going to be." And he said, "Clouds go back. I rebuke you." He said, "Son, come forth and shine for the next four days because we are hunting here." And within minutes, everything just the clouds just took within seconds. Everything just moved. Boom. The sun came up. When brother Brandham went back to the camp, those brothers said, "You were out there, weren't you?" &gt;&gt; We seen something happen over there that we can't explain. But that was God showing that there was a son of God on the earth &gt;&gt; that would be displaying the attribute of God &gt;&gt; that would show that God was desiring to to show that there would be sons of God that would live on the earth &gt;&gt; with God and manifest the word like God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what that was said for. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why when we look at the prophet, we we see the supernatural. We But we're looking at the God that was in the prophet. &gt;&gt; That's what we're that's what we're we hear. That's the revelation that we're receiving as the church in this hour. We're not here just to play the tapes. Are you going to hear this playing the tapes where you we're we're where we bring it to our day to the hour that we're living in to where you're in a situation you need supernatural deliverance. You need God to move in your life. You need things to change in your heart. You need God to become a reality in your life. You're just living like anybody else. You're just a another, you know, just another uh oh, I'm a Christian. I'm a Christian. Well, what does it mean to be a Christian? &gt;&gt; There should be a supernatural element around your life at all times. Amen. &gt;&gt; A recognition of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So, what was God showing? What he was going to do in us? And look, next quote here. And we're winding down here. Just a couple more quotes. And I know this is a little chopped up, but God help us to just catch the the essence of what God is trying to tell us here. Amen. He says in the rising of a sun, he says in the rising of the sun, as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth, although typed in many places, he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride, coming of Christ, coming out of the church. There'll have to be a sheath waved again in the last days. Oh my. Waving of the sheath. What was the sheath? The first one that come to maturity. the first one that proved that it was a wheat that proved that it was a sheath. Hallelujah. I'm sure you see what I'm talking about. It was waved over the people. That's what William Brham was. He was he was a wave sheath of a son of God that would manifest and receive the the the power of God in his life &gt;&gt; to show us that that is what we will become. &gt;&gt; When they would take the wave sheath of the first mature, they would wave it before the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; And a prophet has been waved to this 20th gen 20th century. A prophet is being waved before the people. And now God is waving his bride before the people so that they can recognize that he's alive. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And that he's going to BRING SONS OF GOD into maturity, into the manifestation of sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Next quote. He says, "And the first time there will come forth for the bride age, for a resurrection, out of dark denominationalism." Hear it now. What was the cry of the prophet? Come out of her, my people. &gt;&gt; God is not in denomination. You will not find him there. You will never find him there. Anytime they denominated the word of God, he just moved on out. They know not what they worship. They have a form of godliness. &gt;&gt; But they deny the power of God. &gt;&gt; He says, "But for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message." This message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power. There was never a time where this message that we're preaching right now, this revelation that we are feasting on, &gt;&gt; it was never available until now. &gt;&gt; For you, it's now. &gt;&gt; That's why for a lot of people, the coming of the Lord, yeah, I tell you, he came down with the shout in 1963, but it wasn't until 1991 that that shout had an effect on that attribute that was in me &gt;&gt; or 1994, sorry. It was then that the attribute woke up and something started to take place. What was it? It was the coming of the Lord to me. &gt;&gt; And when the coming of the Lord is to you, it'll be because the word unveils itself to you. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden now you see that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Nobody can tell me that there was more signs and wonders than what was in that prophet's ministry. And today, the bride is displaying the same revelation &gt;&gt; that was in the prophet. &gt;&gt; The bride will come into a change. &gt;&gt; She's now being positioned by the word of God. &gt;&gt; And she has a ministry. The ministry did not end with William Branham. &gt;&gt; We listen to the tapes. WE FEED ON THE TAPES. We recognize I just finished. WE DON'T HAVE a message without William Brandon. We don't have a message. &gt;&gt; But the message is now in you. &gt;&gt; It's now your turn. &gt;&gt; It's now your part. &gt;&gt; NOW YOU'VE GOT THUS SAYETH the Lord IN YOU. NOT JUST TO COME OUT AND SPEAK IT WHEN YOU WANT. &gt;&gt; No sir. It'll be when GOD WANTS TO SHOUT THE WORD OF GOD to bring forth sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE'S THE FINAL VOICE in this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He says, "Now listen, when the prophet was sent, it was God sending his word, not a man. It was God." &gt;&gt; The word always comes to the prophets. And a son of man displaying the son of man. Amen. To die. Today it's the son of man in bride form &gt;&gt; because there's an invisible union that's taking place &gt;&gt; there's a marriage that's taking place. Remember in the beginning, Adam when he was when he was made in the image of God, male and female created he them and called their name called their name. &gt;&gt; Called their name Adam, &gt;&gt; not Eve, &gt;&gt; Adam. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't until he took Eve from his side that there that that actually brought forth the fall. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; THE DECEPTION. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY the church is in deception. &gt;&gt; But not THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE HAS COME OUT OF THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE DOES. IT CALLS THE BRIDE OUT OF THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; If you're in a church and you're in a denomination and you're under a teaching of man, you need to come out of that church to be in the mystical body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's the body that's going to be raptured. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So, so in conclusion here, like we could just go on, saints, but I want to be done here by 1:30. Let the musicians come. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; The final quote here, because I live, ye live also. This message is alive &gt;&gt; in the bride. &gt;&gt; It's because he lives in you that you can live. &gt;&gt; Amen. Speaking to his wife, because I live, ye live also. What a resurrection that was. And what a resurrection this is. Amen. &gt;&gt; To be quickened from the dead, to be made alive in Jesus Christ by God's quickening power. He was he was waved to them. The word which he was was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost. The word made manifest. Now, as I say, it's to be waved again in the last days. Amen. And until the prophet's message which which he brought forth said that this that there would be a bride that would be raptured that that that there would be a change that would come over the people until that word is fulfilled until uh Thessalonians until Corinthians that says that this body shall put on immortality. Until that is fulfilled, we will have a ministry here on the earth. And we will be the voice of God here on the earth in the last days. If it's going to be a voice, it's not going to be just the prophet's voice, but we are going to say what the prophet said. Amen. And we're going to recognize how it pertains to us and how we are the word in our day. Amen. Praise God forever more. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; What a shout. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that song. Shout to the Lord. &gt;&gt; I think there's a shout in the bride. I believe there's a shout in our hearts. It's this very message that we're feasting on in this day and in this hour. It's a shout that that we we can't contain it. We've got to speak it. We've got to tell the people. The people need to know what true Christianity is all about. They need to recognize what God is doing in our day. It's important for us to take this message and allow the voice of God to be in us to speak the word and to let the people know what the word is for this day to let them know what God has done in this day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Shout &gt;&gt; the Lord all the earth. Let us sing. Power and majesty, praise to the king will roar at the sound of the voice forever. I love you forever. I stand. Nothing compares to the proise in you. My Jesus, my savior. Father, there is none like you. All of my names I want to praise for wonders of your mighty love. My comfort, my shu strength.
