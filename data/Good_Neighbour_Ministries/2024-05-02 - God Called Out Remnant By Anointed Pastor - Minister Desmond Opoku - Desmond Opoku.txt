2424 Jeremiah chapter 23 1 to8 you got it praise the Lord War be unto the pastors that destroy and Scatter the Sheep of my pasture said the Lord therefore thus said the Lord God of Israel against the pastors that Feed My People ye have scattered my flock and driven driven them away and have not visited them behold I will visit upon you the evil of your doings said the Lord and I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whether I have driven them and will bring them again to their folds and they shall be fruit and increase and I will set up Shepherds over them who shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be lacking said the Lord behold the days cometh said the Lord that I will raise unto David A righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and Justice in the earth in his days Judah shall be Sav and Israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the Lord our righteousness therefore behold the days cometh said the Lord that they shall no no more say the Lord liveth which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt but the Lord liveth which brought up the which brought up and said and which brought up and which led the seed of the House of Israel out of the North country and from all countries whether I have driven them and they shall dwell in their own land we are in our own land right now Hallelujah blessed be the name of Lord and the Lord said those pastors Lord is Raging war against those pastors who drove and Scattered the children of God around the world but thank God he said you will give us a Shepherd Hallelujah glory to God oh my God my God is real our God is real and he love us more than hallah as Peter said he asked Peter said Peter thou lest me and Peter said yes Lord tonight I ask you do you really love the Lord and then Peter said again three times and he said yes Lord you know that I love you and I know the Lord know you loveed him praise God hallelujah Matthew 24 24 for there shall arise false Christ and false prophet and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect may the Lord add his Blessing to his word it's not possible that they sh they they can deceive us you may be say that Hallelujah is there any way I can take this this is giving me a shadow yeah thank you my brother Hallelujah I am happy to be the Son of God there's nothing on this Earth here that you can achieve better than that because you are seal till the day of your the Redemption and the Bible said when we read the word of God he talks about the false prophet false pastor but thank God he has given us a Shepherd a p Pastor who is Anointed by the Living God the great Holy Spirit he said I will not leave you nor forsake you till the end of this world and we are going home he's preparing us Jeremiah Was A a great prophet a true anointed Prophet why God saying that because in the olden days God had prophets and they have false prophet since from the beginning and they never never quit who was that that's Satan but let let me tell you they were all anointed by the word of God too don't think that somebody is fult but he's not anointed he's anointed but he cannot live by the word of God the only way you can see the false prophet because he cannot live by what he preached he cannot live by the word of God hallelujah God is Raging war against the false pastors and anointed anointed Ministries who are destroying and Scatter the children of God around the word It Started from the beginning beginning and is still here now so when God give you a pastor who is Anointed by the Holy Ghost preaching the word of God you have to be thank God because it's not easy for the job God has placed in their heart to be a pastor or a prophet is not a just a job it's God they are God representative call yes it's a calling as a brother said they are God representative you don't take them lightly and he said no matter where the people or God people has scattered the pastors has scattered them because of why the false teaching they can't leave by the word of God because what they are not filed with the Holy Ghost because they themselves are not of God it's like bam you know the BAM was anointed he was a true Prophet from the Israel but what happened at the end he spoke with what donkey could you imagine that a prophet of God speaking with donkey why that shows you how serious God is about his word God does no joke about his word his word is absolute God created this word here by the spoken word let there be light and there was light and let me tell you the first day God spoke the word of God it does not change it's still the same thing yesterday today and forever remember when the apostles started this gospel whatever they taught whatever they preach is the same thing today they spoke the word of God with anointing to the people and the word penetrate down to their heart and the Bible said those word one day 3,000 Souls do you think is just a mind word the word that is in you the word that is in your mouth is the same thing that was in Peter's mouth the same thing that was in Paul's mouth the same thing that was in Matthew the same thing that was in our our Prophet William Braham it never changed and God said he will give a Shepherd the anointed Shepherd and he at the same time he said there is false teachers false prophet as I said how can you identify them sometime you go you witness to people they same they ask you a question how do you think your church only is the the good church in this world no my church is not a good church the church itself is not a the Holy Ghost is important the Holy Ghost is important without the Holy Ghost the people will perish without the Holy Ghost the church will not function the way supposed to be functioned because the Holy Ghost started the church the Bible said they were all anointed in the day of Pentecost in the upper room right and they came out spoke one language because God is one and when he speak he speak his word is one word he doesn't go back and change that word that word remained the same yesterday today and forever so God said the people have scattered all over the world and he will send the shepherd to bring them in he will call them and they will not what lack no wisdom nothing you will not lack no wisdom tonight I encourage you do not underestimate yourself God is with you it doesn't matter how much somebody look at you you speak the word of God I see I think all the ministers y year and you saw too the testimony that comes to that chch this The church here this church is not small but what makes it great God makes great because God is here CU God always want his people to stay with his word do you think we come here just to see one another for Fellowship we come here to meet God himself do you believe God is here if God could open one of us eye to see the where the pillar of fire is hanging right here oh glory to God the pill of fire is hanging here I believe in my heart because God said he doesn't break his word wherever two or three people are gathered together in his name he is in their mid so there's no one time we ever ourself here without God because our heart God has cleansed our heart and bur our hearts together with his word and God always back up his word the TR the the false Pastor he can preach the word of God he can say anything but he cannot stay with the word of God he cannot stay with the word of God he going to tell the people go and baptize in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost that's contrary he can say so many things you got you got to tell oh the Bible said a woman shouldn't preach he said oh nowaday things change there's more education Women are Smarter than the men so the woman can preach the Bible said no no matter how much he she smart he said thou shall not teach if you have anything teach your children at home respect your husband obey your husband live with happily that's yours that's your job praise God it's simple because why he said the woman was sin the man man didn't do that so everyone the woman has his curse and the man has his own curse too so there's difference between man and woman and God has said if he stay with the word of God with his duties at home childbearing taking care even Bible said I don't know why it is coming even the Bible said Abraham Sarah loved Abraham and call him Lord this is what the people Abraham message they were fighting with him the denomination was fighting with him about why you always talking about woman he not talking about woman he is talking about what the word of God said brother Simon always said when you speak about the word of God you will always stay with the word of God don't move there don't move stay right there hit there and he said he was set up a Shepherd over Earth to call out I thank God this little church here we have ministers here how can we call out those who are he said all countries eh not only here said all countries the whole world and thank God God has reserved the elect at this age through the message of Willam maram Braham this message is so powerful that if you do all the people are watching online if you do not understand the message of William Mar Braham please don't say nothing about it pray and ask God he will tell you what to do read your word I said Lord show me listen when we all came to the message I was running I didn't want to come I didn't come because somebody told me and I just came to visit the church and right there Satan hit me back bang and I said no more this church here from Toronto to ston Creek three times a week my brand new car not such a thing no not such a thing I came to Canada here nice clean nice hair no B hair young man handsome man I work hard I make money I can do whatever I want I do everything but one thing God help me he saved me from drinking and smoking I did not do that all what I was it doesn't mean that I was cing TV I can sit on TV about 3 or four the sitting down there all my my addiction was TV grey music everything it doesn't mean that if you don't drink you don't smoke so you're clean a Sin is Sin it doesn't matter what you do but God always has reserved you you are the people who were in those Church there the false pastors there when they were preaching you smoking drinking is not good but they will not tell you the Bible said don't defy your body your body is the temple of God but those Church there one time I brought a a guy to the church here he learned a little bit Spanish guy big tall huge guy he was a Roman Catholic he learned something because I told him I I I teach him a little bit he went there to the church and after the church the the pastor sneak to the back he went there he was standing there and he was smoking and the guy pull his smoke and he goes to the the the pastor he ask the father if he has a what what how do you call it a lighter and he took this he go there and then he both of them spoken and he said but I thought they say the the pastor doesn't smoke and then he was shocked and then and he asked so many about drinking and stuff like that and why the guy was the pastor start shaken he was shaken the little to that he know my brother anything that he do wrong your conscious you know that is not good God will tell you it's not good before you can do it you have to ignore that thought that the warning that behind your back that God is telling you that is real we all go through that we are we are adult why the things sometime you want to you're doing something wrong and you know that is wrong right there your body start shaking you're doing something wrong your body is shaking because it's wrong the only way you can continue do it you have to ignore that thought behind your back God loves you God Saves you God want to use you we scattered around the world but he's bringing us back through the message of Willam maram Braham this mes is real it's absolute if you do not understand please do not talk against the message of William Braham session up you go to the website you can get information about that other than that you just have to go to your cret and pray God will reveal to you God did to me if God did for me he will do for anybody one time brother marel I was leaving with him and he came to me I came to the church and I left cuz I I I it was too far for me cuz that one was Tony Creek and the same time when I came somebody stole something from my car that pissed me off I said I cannot come here no more and then I just I left not knowing thank God for your prayers everybody where you are sitting here you're a Son of God your child of God when you go your need pray for somebody you may not understand is part of the evangelism God will give you strength to talk about to somebody because he said they have scattered the pastor gave you the word the anointed Pastor will give you the word and with that anointed word there you use that anointed word and pray and talk to somebody if you can't remember God will give you something just your own testimony little testimony and God will back that testimony up and do something miraculous something great to that person because those who are scattered scattered around the world with those false prophets you and me are going to hand them and bring them back to the house of the Lord hallelujah my thought is God called out the remnant by anointed pastors God called out the remnant by God anointed past and Bon always used to say if you don't go send somebody every little every little dime that you gave to the missions the only way we can have to the this church here is a Missionary church this church is been known are around all over because why we have anointed pastors who are seeking for The Lost Ones the scattered ones around those countries so because if you go and you Minister over there and somebody catch it the same person will go to another place and do what calling them out and the only way the missionary can go is when we give little by little the church doesn't plead for money but they preach the word of God somebody can say oh this church they always talk about money actually the money is not ours anyway who gave you life to go to work every day yeah who gave you strength Health to go to work every day Hallelujah you don't control yourself it's God that is controlling you and God knows your heart anything that you do every sent everything that you give to the church God knows and he said if you bring it you open the windows of heaven I'm press you what he said you will not lack nothing nothing you will not lack nothing if you don't have nothing you know what somebody who can take just a little seed and put on the ground and that that one pepper it can come all so much 10er you can say the pepper I I love hot pepper you can sell to me and make some money Hallelujah there's work for everybody to do brother Kofi here brother Phil here brother Christopher here brother brother Tim here our pastor is here we are all God called anointed Shepherd that is trained with this Ministry not to go just to go but with signs and wonders foll me to vindicate the message that he are sending out that's why you can see the H the true Shepherd because when you because by their fruit you shall know them yes if you put Apple it will not bear orange it will not bear banana so if you are God called Pastor or Shepherd God would vindicate you through his word hallelujah oh the word of God is so sweet there's so many people out there that God is waiting for us as brother Simon said you can't go send somebody this church here you don't know how many people we have passed through them through this church why they can't stay why because they don't look to the word of God cuz now the churches they have made it social churches oh if you do something here all the church will come down there and they bring all what you need the money and everything and put you together to Pap you but this church here will bring forth the word of God and let God himself you know the God himself that you worshiping that is your provider every need that you need he going to provide for you yes he you because he said that here he said you will not lack nothing you are not like nothing unless go what what God Said sometime we we people don't understand what they do in their life he said ask and I will do it I will give it to you this word that we speaking is not just a word coming out from mouth this is life this is real Hallelujah this is not just a preaching this is life because we witness we witness the manifestation of the word of God in our life right here it's not just we speak the word of God just like that there's a light behind this word that we preach Hallelujah do make the word effective Hallelujah God always vindicate his word last week a a pastor called me from Ghana he said I have a testimony for you I said say what said one of the girls that you you you you baptized last time he came and gave testimony he said he has a dream and somebody was giving him a gift he didn't know what gift said something that is WRA on somebody's giv to him giv to her and when he when he he took that gift right away you stand in front of him in front of her and he rejoicing because why God has given her a gift of Salvation he came and baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and God was vindicating that the gift that he received was salvation Hallelujah he came and received the gift of of Salvation and he came God revealed to her and testify what God has done for her this is the manifestation of the word of God with a true Pastor the true Prophet God will vindicate the word of God when Jeremiah said this was real God he said that said the Lord Jeremiah said that it wasn't the words of just Hallelujah there are so many out there under the false prophet Pentecost Baptist Catholic angri everywhere they all baptize in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost so they are not the um and the umbrella of the Holy Ghost they have nothing whatsoever somebody asked me this week and I said no you you are not baptized you doomed if anything happened right now you are not a part of the Lord Jesus Christ Kingdom before you don't know but now you know that's the problem the Lord Jesus chist told them the Pharisees before you don't know but now you know you have a sin you don't do it before you don't know no problem but as soon as he reveal God revealed to you he become what the same you have to partake it otherwise because King God told him your brother has done go and take the same thing and do it I will receive it he said no as soon as he said no what happened out because why he was not of God but the children of God when you hear the word of God the Bible say their heart pricked amen the heart prick something Supernatural take place brother Mar spoke to me that night about the Rapture I didn't know nothing about Rapture when he spoke about Rapture to me I was so quiet listening listening and that night God did something Supernatural I wake up in the morning where is brother Michael he's not there God is so good he know how to call his children it doesn't matter wherever you are God is calling you if you are watching God is calling you when he did that I went to in the morning I I wake up in the morning brother Michel was not there then those words that he was speaking to me about the word of God it start hitting my heart in my mind like something ringing in my ear Lord then I begin to ask myself Lord am I too late to give myself to the I know the Rapture was gone I couldn't find brother Michael till in the evening and I asked him my brother where did you go because every morning I woke I woke up early before you and I go to work before you said that day he got a new job so he had to wake up early to go to work I called all his friends in the city nobody don't know where the brother was that's that that was a killing to me and the following Sunday I pack all my shorts and everything in my that time the Grandam that I I was thinking I was not going to bring it to the church I forget about the car the car is nothing now I'm seeking for salvation Hallelujah that's my endless hope in this e year without a Salvation you are doomed it doesn't matter who you are what where you are your money your riches your gold your properties your perish Hallelujah he cannot save you my grandfathers and all of them they used to have lots of money in Africa my grandfather 1950s he bought in Africa Ghana he bought his casket from England that's how much he was Rich his own casket I saw that when we were young he bring the casket and put in the middle of the house and sometime he lay inside there he was old was about 106 sometime he lay inside and relaxing we talk about gold my grandfather he when he sat down on the on his throne he was a king in the village there when he sat down go all over here go all over here go over the the legs he has a a a a matchet like this long all gold people used to come to her to him to rent that thing when the king some King on the other City die they came and ran from my grandfather I saw everything and used to to decorate as a barrier all pure gold lots of gold where is the gold he died he left everything behind so those things is good but don't put your eye on it seek for salvation no matter what you do you going to go if the r is we're going to go so let's work let's work and pursue and hand for those our brothers and sisters those who are out there Hallelujah let's focus on them and search for them is your job if you bring him here or you talk to them and they don't take you are finished your job you don't have to push him push him because

shepherd He will let his congregation know nobody can fool great Holy Spirit no before that thought comes to your mind God knows that's why bra preached the message the greatest battle ever thought is

Braham said and this message that I'm going to read for you here is the anointed one at the end time anointed ones at the end time paragraph 55 down if you can put it on that will be fine they can see

need to cross that line that's what he's thinking of so Hallelujah you you want me to read or you going to pray the and he had a citrus farm and he had a tree there which was an orange tree that was bearing grapefruits and lemon tangerin tangelos and I forget how many different fruits there was on that one tree and I said to the the the man I said how is it what kind of a tree is that he said the tree itself is an orange tree I said what has it got grapefruits on it why has it got lemons on it he said they're grafted into it I said I see well now I said now next year when that tree comes forth with another crop of fruit which he all right about the same time I said then it will bring forth allog together oranges if it's a naval orange tree it'll bring forth the naval oranges won't it sir he said no there every grafted Branch will bring forth of its kind I said you mean that lemon Vine will bring forth the lemon out of that orange tree he said yes sir will the great fruit bring forth a grapefruit out of that orange tree said yes sir that's the nature of the branches grafted into it I said praise be to God he said what do you mean I said one more question now will that orange tree ever bring forth oranges again he said when it puts forth another Branch when it puts forth another Branch not when one's grassed into it but they're all citrus fruit and they live off of the Citrus life that's in the citrus tree I said there you are the Methodist will bring forth Methodist every time the Baptist will bring forth Baptist every time the Catholic will bring forth Catholic every time but the Church of the Living God will produce Christ from the root the word every time if it ever puts forth another Vine of its own now you can craft it in there you see every grapefruit lemon tangelo Tangerine whatever the citrus fruits they are every one of them can live in that tree but bearing false witness of the tree living by the tree yes Lord you see it they are living and thriving on the genuine life that's in that tree now there's Matthew 24 24 living by the same life but they wasn't right at the beginning they're bearing false witness of that tree it's an orange tree yet it's a citrus tree and they say this church this denomination is bearing record of Christ and got a false baptism false witness of the word trying to say that the power of God was only for the disciples Jesus himself said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel that every Branch that'll every tree ever bring forth every branch that will be in the tree and these signs shall follow the genuine branches where as long as it's a tree as long as is putting forth branches to the end of the world in my name they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues take up serpents drink deadly things lay hands on the sick and they shall recover see the hour We're living see what Jesus said remember this is at the end time not back under westle back there now at the end time this was to take place now watch the scriptures let them testify Jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think or believe that you have eternal life and they are the ones that testify of me Amen in other words if this tree ever brings forth a branch I am the the vine the tree ye are the branches he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also St John 14:12 now he that abideth in me he that him that was in my root at the beginning that's the reason Jesus was both the root and offspring of David he was before David in David and after David both root and offspring of David a Morning Star the rose of Sharon the valley Alpha and Omega Father Son and Holy Ghost in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily both root and offspring of David he that is the elected life the predestinated life that's in me and he is the word from the beginning when he comes forth he'll bear my fruit St John 14:12 but others will live by the same thing call themselves Christians and Believers not all the say Lord Lord now this is the take place and be manifested in the last days when the mysteries of God should be finished as we'll get to a little later these trees thank you you head by yourself the True Vine say we are the branches so we are the one bear the fruits so let us go and bear fruits to the Lord Jesus Christ as I said from the beginning if you can't go give whatever you can give so the God will designate the the the the brothers whom he has raised here to go and bear the fruit wherever he need to Bear the fruit May the L May the Lord God bless you I have this testimony last two weeks I went
