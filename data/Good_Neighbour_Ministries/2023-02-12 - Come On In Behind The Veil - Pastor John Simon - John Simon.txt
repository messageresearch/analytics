wonderful Sunny Sunday and God bless you uh first of all I we will bring the word of God because we must feed on the word of God and we may live spiritually after this we will announce to you the nominations of as have been balloted by you the congregation and to God be the glory and the praise and thanks I believe and Justin turning a little bit brother Hutchinson is that really you as long as it's not your theophany or but we're glad that we welcome you here in the name of the Lord glad to have you please be seated amen just to let you know uh we announce again for your awareness for your uh notation on your calendars uh if there is not a flyer in the back then it will be put up uh to announce to you and let you know and you may know already of the passing of our brother John Brennan as you know for many years he has been a part of us with his entire family worshiping and praising God but people grow times change and we have to evolve and so our precious brother moved on began to worship closer to his home amen and served as a youth leader and in many other parts of the congregation and I can tell you he was a tremendous blessing and we're happy that we were blessed to lay the foundation stones may the Lord bless him may the Lord Comfort strengthen his wife and family may the Lord help his daughter with uh horror trials that she bears and bring her through safely and wonderfully well praise the lord we all have our ups and downs and families we all have it and and so we have to pray one for another fervently that we may be healed praise the Lord God bless you good to be here and to get once again in the presence of the Lord we go to a scripture in the Old Testament and that will be Exodus chapter uh 35 reading from verse 4 to 10. praise the Lord let's get your thoughts and your hearts into the word right amen praise the Lord don't don't think about anything else at this particular time right just keep your mind on the word of God because that's what we're here for if we don't have him or if we Gather in here right we can work ourselves up into emotion that's not the Holy Spirit work yourself into a sensation that's not the Holy Spirit uh if we can be here by the thousands but if he is not here we are just like a lodge just a gathering of people that doesn't mean a thing in the sight of God what he he we want is his presence yes we want the greater than Solomon to walk among the lilies and have the aroma the smell of the lives that were produced by the blood of Christ that's what we are here for I pray that he will draw near and anoint the word of God Amen praise God let's go to the word amen uh Exodus 35 it's before you and Moses gathered all the congregation that's from verse one let me get to verse four and Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel saying this is the thing which the Lord commanded saying take ye from among you and offering unto the Lord whosoever is of a willing heart right let him bring it an offering of the Lord gold silver and brass and blue and purple and Scarlet and fine linen and goats here and Ram's skin dyed red and Badger skins and him wood and oil for the light spices for anointing oil and for this sweet incense and oink stones and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate and every wise-hearted among you shall come and make all that the Lord had commanded amen praise the Lord God bless his word Our Father we thank you for this the reading of the word we pray for every heart here and father we bind Satan and his activity we we arrest his uh evil suggestive thoughts the Lord that he tries to inspire we bind every movement of his uh oh God let the Holy Spirit take control now to thy glory and for thy honor amen God bless you please be seated God is saying that if you're coming with an offering come with your willing heart uh you have got to give it willingly right uh because it's not just the size of the offering or whatever that you're bringing or or whether it's a penny like the widow or or thousands of dollars like the Pharisee and the sad you see but it is the motive and it is the what's in the heart is what he is looking at right I think there's a saying a common thing it's not really the gift but it's it's what's in the person's Hearts that's giving me the gift well it's the same way with God it's not really the gift right but it's what God can see in the heart of the individual that is giving the gift that that's why it ends by saying so let them that are wise-hearted let them come and let them give this offering unto the Lord so God asks us to offer uh to him The Ultimate Gift which is the gift of our own hearts The Ultimate Gift of ourselves to give that to him that he might use that for his glory and for his honor praise the Lord last week we spoke about the unveiling of God God being unveiled and we touched on it in the this way first of all not the unveiling of the head of the body but the unveiling of the body itself right for Jesus we know is the head of the church the head of the body the bride or the wife is actually the church itself and that that as Eve was in Adam until God took her out we were in Christ is that right we were in Christ until he we were separated not to preacher touch on that again but just to bring you aware that I was talking about the lifting of the veil from off of the Bride God's Masterpiece God's great work of art that was covered up with a with a veil upon it the hour has come for God the Holy Spirit to lift the veil off and bring her are into public view that all might begin to recognize that there's something about this woman that's different amen the way she is different there's something in our heart makes her different amen so God lifted the veil as it was in the East that when there was a wedding the bride would have the veil on I believe it's the same in China I believe it's the same in India and some of the Asian countries they're covered with a veil and then the lifting of The Veil The bridegroom lifts that Veil and her face and features everything comes into Plain View God has and is doing the very same thing in this hour lifting the veil from off of various individuals elected of course by him that's wonderful and we praise him for that and we want to talk along those lines not on the same approach but we won't want to talk about the veil of the temple the old temple veil and that old temple veil as the scripture tells us he was telling them make that veil of of ram skins dyed red type of Christ and the suffering that he was to follow and then he says and along with the ramskin use Badgers skins and with the badger skins and the ram skin make that Veil oh praise God I'm so thankful that we have a veil like that mentioned here in the Bible listen out of the wonderful this wonderful message and I'm speaking about because it's an invitation here today as an invitation to every person in the building here today calling you to come in behind the veil to come in to his presence that the Holy Spirit of almighty God may take his own word that you might have heard for years and make the word live make the world real to you until you can see him in his fullness of his glory the resurrected Christ now living forevermore in our midst to God be the glory listen here God speaking in the Old Testament there were Badger skins and the badger Skins are the veil in God because you know how the temple was the outer Court the inner Court the holy of holies and how that the holy of holies had a veil that was there amen and no one could go Beyond the Veil except they priests amen could go behind that Veil and the high priest could only go behind there when the purifier God wanted to speak amen yes so the veil had a great importance because behind that veil was the pillar of Fire and you cannot go into the presence of the pillar of fire without a Divine invitation everybody wants the Holy Ghost everybody wants the power of God everybody wants the presence of God but you cannot come into that atmosphere and presence of the Living God without his personal Divine invitation you don't walk in the presence of a king or even an Earthly royalty without invitation you are invited to come behind the veil in the presence of God to have a conference with God where God can speak to you his word and then he interprets his own word he tells you about himself he makes the world clear to you amen you may understand it but now the author of the book is speaking to you himself and he is making the book clear that you might recognize what you saw what you heard what you heard quoted repeated or whatever to you now you begin to see now you begin to recognize the word of God for this day and for this hour amen yes sir see there it was so the pillar of fire was hid behind the veil and this is the invitation you are receiving not to stay outside the veil see the the glow of Pentecost the Afterglow you know you can put up a a veil but if there is a flame or a light behind the veil the light will just you'll see parts of it on the outside but the center and the power and the presence of that great light you will not see and this is what happens to a lot of people they are seeing the the glow but they're on the glare but they haven't caught the fullness of the presence of almighty God in his word and in his people amen now notice that Mo the word was in Moses and he was a prophet you see but he met the pillar of Fire it was God come down now to identify Moses by bringing him into that Pillar of Fire amen praise God and then veiling him praise God forevermore see God wants to bring us into the pillar of fire oh praise God and then you Avail to praise God oh praise His name no one else could go in not any person could now try to impersonate that at that time amen they could not do it and if they tried to do it they'll die with the rest Amen in other words you'll die just like the unbelievers you'll die like those who died in the other Church ages that that at the at the manner and drunk the water and then their bones were left in the wilderness not because they were not so-called Christians or Jews but because they did not recognize the fullness of what God was doing in their day and in their hour amen yes sir oh my now think of it one man went in behind there praise God because he's a type of the elected seed of God you believe that praise God oh my went in behind there right into that Pillar of Fire he walked right into the glory of God and into that Shekinah Glory and when he came out with the word for that age he was now shining with the glory of God till he had to Veil his face oh my and remember that was only the natural veil in other words what will happen to the spiritually left in this day in this hour when they walk into the presence of God like that praise the Lord oh praise God I want to tell you that I believe somehow some way I have walked into that realm I believe I have walked into the presence of God and into the purifier I believe somehow he has enabled me not just me but his unable some of you who have seen and believed that you have walked into though we were not conscious of it but that's what we've done walk into the presence of the great Pillar of Fire praise the Living God hallelujah amen and now see when a man or a woman breaks through through that Veil into this Shekinah Glory of God then the world on the outside becomes to call them fanatics yes they call them Fanatics they can't see what is wrong then people can't see what is wrong oh my behind there is no beauty of him that they could see so oh my that man or woman may not pronounce their words right oh and he or she might not even dress right see he he or she may not dress in that way see some may not dress with clergy close on she might not dress the way they think she ought to dress it may be you see that way but inside now listen to this of that Badger skin that's gonna bother you it's gonna budget bother you it's going to Badger your conscience you know when somebody say you're badgering me it means you're constantly picking you nagging you're pulling your you're constantly amen and uh you go read about the honey badger and stuff like that how they love honey and they go after where honey is in a rock and all that sort of stuff but these are badgers and Badgers are known to be uh perseverant and they they don't give up when they're going after that honey they just go after it with all they got amen so I I want to take we are like those honey badgers amen and when you see inside of there behind that Badge of skin now which is now behind human skin and there now is the Shekinah glory amen what's your kind of Glory they said clean the glory of the revelation of the word of God the evening lights shining out through the Sons and Daughters of the Living God light on the word light on the word understanding on the word not human understanding by Theological Seminary study but the inspiration the anointing of the Holy Spirit upon the word of God for this hour reflecting itself out to the age in which they live oh praise God bringing light to the darkness all around them that men may recognize that God is alive amen yes sir and there is the word of God Living Praise the Lord in there is this shoe bread thank God for the shoe bread Hallelujah because you know as I've said that many times before the shoe bread is when you eat the bread and the bread which is the word begins to show in your life on the outside oh praise God now you have a bread that is showing itself manifesting itself and making itself real to the believer real to the individual that they could recognize him oh praise God forevermore amen there is the shoebox bread there is the Shekinah glory amen which is the light that ripens the fruit for the age amen why since you caught the Revelation what does it do it starts maturing your faith it starts making the wine inside to become like a wine that never tasted in their life amen this is not some or or some wine of the past but this is the new wine that the Lord Jesus Christ places within the vessel for his glory amen praise God Amen will you let me preach a little this morning amen praise God now listen the word that we preach amen God hiding in Simplicity God hiding behind a humble little by your skin praise the Lord badge your skin and I thank God it's happened again and it's happening again amen oh well God just wants to get behind the veil and he wants you to get behind the veil of his word that he can use you for his glory amen praise the name of the Living God God hiding Simplicity God now hiding behind the skin of man humans hiding behind the skin of man o praise God God manifested to the world Glory his name he was hiding behind a veil back then and this behind the skin of a man that was called Jesus he was veiled hiding behind the skin of that man back there Called Moses and now he's hiding behind the skin of ordinary men and women here today that trust in him believing him and then lay their faith in him amen you can vote for whoever you've walked to but I my vote is casted for Jesus Christ the same yesterday to the end forever Hallelujah and so there it is brother we stand for him and he said if you stand for me I'll stand for you I'll Stand before the father I'll call your name I'll tell him what you're done I'll raise you up hallelujah praise God forevermore that's why we are here this morning we're not just here as Paul said making noise like a tinkling symbol or something of brass but we're praising God he said with the understanding we're giving glory to God with the wisdom we're giving God the with Revelation because we recognize that God longer serve amen yes sir hiding behind the skin of man and them them man like that were God he says now I don't mean just that God and Harry has Capital but one God Amen it's only the great one God changing his mask all the time amen changing his mask once it was Moses Elijah this one that one but it was God using them as instruments to reflect himself from behind there glory to God Amen doing the same thing bringing his own bringing through them his own word see God made it that way because he knows human has got to see something they've got to see something and that is in every one of us that was born into this world Amen they want to see something praise the Lord so that's important to know now that's wonderful and I can talk about it but until you come in behind this Badger skin until you let God take you out from your old skin that you are in how many of you want to come out from your old skin I said how many was to come out from their old skin that you are in he says come out to your old thoughts of them Kings you used to think about the way you look at the word and how you used to think about it come out to them all thoughts amen come out to the worldly thoughts and the things that are out there in the world come out to your old Creeds and your systems you had out there let's leave them things come into the prayer essence of almighty God hallelujah then the word will become a reality within you then when that happens you're awakened to the Shekinah Glory of the Living God then the Bible now becomes a new book together to you amen hallelujah the Bible becomes a new book because you are seeing what though you're reading between the lines you recognize what God is trying to tell you amen everybody can read the Bible anybody can read a letter I write to my wife but when she reads that she gonna read the parts that I can't write down because she is going to say oh my I can see him now while you're right in that thing he must be sitting in this desk by that chair and writing this thing and Bible open on one side and right in there and maybe you have a smile on his face those things are not like written down on the paper and that is what I'm trying to tell you God is now speaking to his beloved elected bride amen and he is talking to her and talking between these lines that you got written here it's important we read this we understand it but this is good but this is not the fullness of it he is letting you now come into His Thoughts of what he's thinking while he was writing this amen he wants you to bring you into his so that we can say we have the mind of Christ because we have entered in behind the veil where the glow Glory never fails we are sitting in the presence of the Lamb amen hallelujah oh my then you see you realize that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday same today but not in Jesus in you he is the same today praise God and will be so forever praise the Lord because what we are all priests and we can go into his presence royal priesthood is that right the Bible tells us that we are prison Kings to God we are of the royal priesthood we are priests after the order of Melchizedek praise the Lord because we are undergoing the same change from TF from from this body to glory amen Melchizedek came from glory to a human body now we are reversing changing back the other way we come from God we're going back to God we have been changed back by the glory of the power of the pillar of fire back into your keaphonic state where we can radiate the presence of the Living God from all your life that that's why those Apostles could just passed the SEC and some of them get healed because it was not them it was the presence of the Living God that was in them making themselves manifest not human effort oh I prayed for 21 days I fasted and I prayed and that's why the sick are getting healed no no no no no no no no that's good if you do that you're just making yourself Sanctified and prepared to be used as a vessel but any natural doctor will tell you are any good one I can't heal I can only cut and sow and give you the medicine and then I said let's nature take its course God has to do the healing God has to do the deliverance and so the real True Believer comes to a place of rest where they realize I can do nothing I can do nothing it reminds me all Bill Anderson wrote that song I only held a pencil but he wrote the song I can do nothing alone you can do nothing alone we can do nothing alone without him we are nothing we come from nothing and we're going back to nothing you come from the dirt and you're going back to the church oh praise God forevermore but thank God Satan will not keep the youth the real elect of God down in the dust and the dirt of some grave where we try to bury you because he is resurrecting his body wherever it is he resurrected that one and this one has going to have a sure Resurrection because I live you will live you've got to live if you identified in him you can't miss it praise God glory to God glory to his wonderful name oh A peculiar holy people giving what spiritual sacrifices to God hallelujah amen oh but for that you must really come in here you must get behind this Veil to see the unveiling of God hallelujah to see God right before you amen you must see him and that unveiled God unveiled that is his word now made manifest to you amen the word making itself manifest or the word unveiled to you amen praise God hallelujah yes sir remember old Solomon how many remembers who Solomon is how many remembers who Solomon is everybody knows him because he was the claimed to be the richest man of the world at that time so of course we know the richest man really was Adam because God gave the whole world to him and Eve and um yes for natural man's sake um they say Solomon but really Adam God says all of it is yours all the gold all the diamonds everything is yours whatever you say that's what's going to be that's the real riches praise the Lord but you see Solomon when he dedicated the Temple of the Lord these Badger skins were hanging there the veil amen oh my and then he came in behind that Veil as a pillar of Fire and as of a cloud praise God you see there's sermons right in there because the word becomes cloudy they're looking at the real thing but it's cloudy they they can't see anything it's like smoke they can't see anything but to to the elected of God it becomes a pillar of fire that makes everything clear amen hallelujah now see it went down behind there and it veiled he veiled himself back there from the outside world Hallelujah but by fact the believing of Israel knew that he was back there that in other words you don't have to see him with your eyes because you know who he is and he's revealed himself to you you recognize them and you know who is back there and now you see the Discerning of the Lord's body where you can recognize you know who is back there you talk with individual walk with individual and in fact five minutes he says you'll recognize oh my what's back of that Veil what's behind that batch of skin what's hiding behind there never mind the religious works the religious formality uh the religious acts that we may put on because there's a tactical kind of Christianity where people live by religious drama the Bible say I have to wear my dress long so I I obeying the Bible I'm walking in obedience that's not walking in obedience you're just doing that because you read it because it wasn't revealed to you amen that's a different standard reveal to you by God himself the word amen but we don't go off on that area praise the Lord hallelujah so he veiled himself from the outside world now you can be talking and believing in God in the spirit and Revelation and the word coming forth and you are the very Veil and the Holy Spirit the pillar fire veiled in you and they can recognize it say something strange about that guy that woman something is funny right they know something is going on but they don't know how to describe it or how to recognize what is really happening and all it is is God behind the veil and you don't care regardless of how many Hidden Worlds what they have to say now I'm friend he is hid from the unbeliever but the Believer by faith knows that he is back there praise God do you believe her by faith we know who is back there praise God hallelujah yes sir they know it because they already have mercy do you have mercy do you have mercy have you met with the God who is rich in Mercy oh praise God if you met the god of Heaven who is rich in Mercy then you have mercy amen and that's why they can be back there and know that the mercy seat that was back there in that that Temple is now here in the Earthly temples God sitting between the wings of the cherubim all the New Testament God reflected himself by the power of his word and inspiration of the Holy Spirit hallelujah oh my and back you see even then it was a great Secret and still it's a mystery it's a great secret even now hallelujah oh how wonderful this is that back in the Old Testament for anybody to attempt to go behind that veil was death there was instantly be struck down then the law behind that Veil that is why the high priest the priests or the high priests they always have to have bells around their ankles so that they can know their life when they're behind that Veil right they're still alive when it goes quiet and then I hear no movement they also had a cord a scarlet cord tied on their leg one of their feet so that when it gets completely quiet they're not hearing any noise they know well you must you know he's dead God struck him down for something or the other and then they will pull that cord they ain't going in nobody's going in there with stretcher and what not to try to bring them out they pull the cord in the sand until his body comes out before they could handle him oh you see that's the way it was where is God so anybody that went in there it was dead Amen to enter into that Glory was death if they were to do that hallelujah amen yes sir but what happened now to stay away from going into that glory is death amen it's changed he said this it's all changed the cycle just went around and now not to go in there comes death back then to stay away from it was was to go in there was death now my friends I tell you we are I want to bring your attention back to the world my mind is running uh like this so let me slow down praise the Lord God now we see of course think of the renting of the veil of badger skins at at uh in the temple when Jesus died that is what it was when they pierced his side and they tore him he was the human Badger skin that was the covering for God to hide and to manifest through through it so it was symbolized by the temple veil so when he got pierced when he got nailed right there the lightning of the angels from God come with a sword and tore the veil from top to bottom the height of the veil I believe was 21 feet amen so an ordinary man couldn't rip that Veil and it was about six inches thick so you can take your hand and like like we haven't tear the veil so it had to be the angel of God ripped the veil from top to bottom Hallelujah this body ripped out there and this one ripped that the symbolism was ripped and then the type the reality of it on the scene on the outside made known to the people amen and see oh praise God that was the veil was read the old Veil now to stay out of his presence for the veil is now rent and open then you must enter into his presence or death amen see it changes back and forth like that praise God and so you must watch the scripture to see the day that we are now living in when in other words recognize your day and your hour your hour might be outside of that and and you're fussing and fighting with that when you shoot your efforts should be within the veil where the glories never fail where your life you're living in the presence of the Lamb you praise God hallelujah think of it many years they were taking blood year after year sanctification for the cleansing of the sanctuary see there was sprinkling blood around the seat amen asking for forgiveness and running to altars and all of that oh my but now we find god with a mighty stroke of lightning struck that Veil and split the oil that that revealed from top to bottom and The Mercy Seat came into Plain View amen praise God hallelujah you may listen to the world like this and in a moment while I'm yet speaking the Holy Spirit comes with the sword of the word of God Hebrews 4 12 and smites that Veil Let's cross your mind hallelujah amen you see you're being invited to come to the inner Veil come into the inner Veil inside the veil where the glories never fail and to live in the presence of the Living God hallelujah amen yes sir the real genuine lamb is now come into Plain View not just the written words of the Bible but the real Lamb of God has now come into plain view to the elected Believers of the Living God because God had paid the price he was now the real Mercy Seat he had not come down and become one of us do you believe that the Bible says he come down that he might be tempted tested and tried with every Temptation coming to man and not fail in one single one to show you that by his grace you can do it too and even if you fail if you make mistakes if you stumble by the way he says my blood already paid the sacrifice paid the price for you amen oh praise God if you sin you have an advocate with the father his name is Jesus Christ the righteous amen yet you're without sin without any condemnation oh you're more than conquerors in him because your sins have been abducted into the bleach blood of Christ I don't care how much your life get messed up I don't care how that dress that that pants that shirt that cap or whatever got so messed up with filled with the dirt of the world if you get some good bleach and you put that thing in the bleach blood of Jesus Christ your Bible said it will cleanse your white or snow Hallelujah make you clean in the presence of the Living God Amen yes sir that's what we are here for not you cleaning yourselves but the blood of Jesus cleanses us and there's still Power in the Blood I said there's still Power in the Blood the power of the blood will cleanse you and make you completely clean where you are what justify by the grace of God hallelujah just as if you're never even sinned or made a mistake in the first place isn't that wonderful you know you go to a court and the judge say your pardoned it means yes he was guilty but I'm going to let you go off but this is not the case God is saying when I clean you you are Justified you as if you never made a mistake or sin in your life because I'm the one doing the cleansing now not only are you forgiven that you're Justified you've been clean completely praise in this presence I'm so glad see I'm Justified raise your hands say I'm Justified see I'm Justified I'm Justified oh praise God forever Oh What a Feeling oh what a reality that you are justified by the grace of the Living God hallelujah yes sir o praise God it's wonderful to know that this real genuine lamb paid the price on The Mercy Seat come into Plain View on the day of atonement something else you can touch on right there because the word atonement means coming back into act one minute right at one minute we come back to where we can come one back with God and say I and my father are one amen who praise God Amen but you see the people are blinded by Church Traditions back there and they may preach about the Jews and the Sadducees The Libertines and the Epicurean stoics and so on how they were blinded by Traditions back there not realizing they are blinded by Church modern Church Creeds dogmas systems of man made from the uh the minds of men smart men but that's not the word the will the way of God that he has in his plan amen so God is calling us back to the word to your original word not just to the written word but the unwritten word of God hallelujah amen what am I talking about there before a word is spoken the word is in your thoughts well it's in your thoughts it's not written yet and if you want to really go back to the original word you don't go back to the one that's already typed out and written here we had meetings last week and then we had uh presented on my desk there her precious sister was so gracious to take notes and we have that there but that's wonderful it's that's different from your actually being in the meeting hearing the words The Voice the emotions the inflections and so on that goes along with it and that's what God is saying you're you're blessed you're wonderful you have this it's good you need to continue to do this until you break into that but you must recognize I want you to go beyond and come into His divine presence praise the name of the Lord Glory Days wonderful name to think of it that God has brought them to this place amen so the Bible tells us that to this day for the Jews a veil is still upon their hearts that's one of the that's the veil you have to think about that that Veil over your heart could be a tradition it could be you were the member of a certain church and my father was a member of this church I was a this I was a lot I was a Pentecostal I was Baptist I was this and that becomes your Veil yeah it's veiling you from the rest of the truth the rest of the word because you're now living your life within those confines of that so-called Faith uh circumcised or ascribed by man they draw a circle and tell you this is this is so and so Circle this is a Baptist Circle you need to move him this is the Sun so circling me to move him and God says no I draw a circle above around all of them and you don't have to be in any of that you just walk where I tell you to walk amen oh Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of almighty God who leads them and guides them you say oh that's going to bring confusion no because they are walking according to the word of God they're walking according to the directions of the heavenly father and that's God has a plan in everything the Pentecost it looked like confusion but it wasn't amen because it was God doing it you say oh you want rain well rain don't just fall like that rain comes out of a ragged Jagged booming lightning flashing wind blowing then the rain comes Hallelujah looks like confusion but that's the way God wants to do it amen not when we want it oh there's God the Bible says I am the Lord command ye me so I'm going to command God and they go around with this foolishness not understanding that if he is God how are you going to command him right and he says there's nobody beside me behind me before me nobody God has no competitor Satan set himself up to be a competitor but he he started a losing race because your creation to begin with he's not a Creator but a creation amen and he sees what God makes or what God does and he copies off of that and I say oh you see I made that no that's the way he does but we are following the Living God they veiled they are veiled with the same Veil over their hearts Hallelujah but when the genuine Mercy Seat come into Plain View this old hymn says lo Behold Him in plain view for he is the mighty conqueror since he rent The Veil into there he stands the mighty conqueror since he rent The Veil into veiled and blinded by Traditions amen I'm going to begin to wind this up uh veil by augmenter of systems veiled by the theologies of man veiled by the peer pressure of popular opinions amen sometimes even we Christians get caught with that well the whole world is bearing this style of dress so so I have to at least wear one like that right I might change it a little but I gotta look like everybody else the Bible doesn't tell you that you you different you're a different peculiar people for the glory of God hallelujah and this I just pass over it quickly but this what I'm talking about blinded by peer pressure of the popular opinions of man Mrs Jones brother Smith Brother this or that do it this way do it that way oh that's good way so you do it but you're not doing it because your heavenly father gave you a revelation of how to do it when to do it amen praise God and we are loved ourselves be blinded by these things we allow God to have his glory amen so they this great old Badger skins begins to hide the glory of God behind that skin aren't you glad that no matter what race no matter what color no matter what you call yourself the reality is it's God come down by his word to go hide behind your skin is that right this is not what the Revelation the mystery of God hiding in skin God and skin walking around God in the skin named Jesus walking around amen they couldn't even believe it and now he's in a many-membered body walking around oh I know him I know her yeah because God made it that way his plan that they'd be ordinary that is one that would not have the appearance of a Grecian God no but he walked in Simplicity and in humility and walking around like that but he was God because the spirit and power presence of God was flowing through him for the glory of God Amen yes sir praise God yes sir he said think of it inside of them all Badger skins now know this no Beauty to be desired of it but you see he made it flesh to dwell Among Us it was still no Beauty when it was in that state that anyone should desire anything of it and now it's the same thing today happening amen there's nothing in a man or any woman that can be desired no sir it's what's behind there that you see well you say I know them what you're saying about I know he used to be a drunkard I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand and to say I was an alcoholic man I drank myself and I tell you boy I have a time on Christmas morning I drink the rum and a true weather bottles because they're MD yeah no sir I know him and maybe they don't know you amen but that's not what God is talking about oh I know him he used to do this she used to do that yeah this way or that way I don't care what they used to do amen what is what's hidden behind that skin now what is behind there that is what comes in this hour of people blinded can't see what's back there they say I remember that woman she used to do this she used to do that she used to do this but what about now praise God hallelujah they don't realize the justifying cleansing power of the blood there is still Power in the Blood of Jesus that cleanses every one of us hallelujah amen them skins that was once on the badger now it's hiding the glory of God and the glory of God has come down and housing itself behind them skins today Lord of God I'm so glad God has made you this house that is housing himself Tabernacle himself tabernacling deity praise God hiding behind you for the glory of God hallelujah but I'd say that it sounds good sounds nice oh I hope you're a honey badger because honey is sweet Amen in a honey sweet praise God you never anyway tasted bitter honey honey is always sweet but praise God before you know what I was studying this he said well how did God get those Badger skins to to make that Veil how did them priests be able to get those Badger for God to have with us well you know he had to First kill the badger to be able to get the skin is that right and if God got to get your skin You Gotta Die to Christ die to the world die to your old ways die do your old things that are out there that he might be able to come and get your skin and after he shocked you or spare use a spare or a ball then he got to skin you and that's where preachers come in because some of the god used them to preach that word that'll skin you alive oh my their skin you unrip that skin from offer you pull that carnality off of you and bring you out that God might use that skin to tabernacular holds himself behind us amen oh praise God I believe God there's a Skilling time going on right now I believe God wants to skin anybody that have anything that is unlike him upon there upon them and he thought that is not like him he wants to skin it out to you amen but you dare that you might be a part of him that he might house behind your skin he says because that skin that was once there covering the covering for an animal he is now using it as a housing for the glory of God hallelujah do you believe it say Amen do you believe it amen I believe it praise God hallelujah oh and I tell you many of us live like animals they have like animals oh my fierce competitive in this world aggressive fearless and unscrupulous but God come to live behind our skin that we might have a Godly life a life of balance a life of Mercy a life of justification a life of Holiness a life of Revelation not by works of righteousness which we have done but by his grace and mercy that he has wonderfully called us amen praise God you take the word in your heart and you walk into the Shekinah Glory of God Amen and when you walk into that she kind of Glory that brings forth the shoe bread in you praise God when that light of God comes into you it brings in the true bread praise God the bread begins to show manifest you don't have to work or do nothing but God working through your life you see and then that shoe bread comes and you now begin to receive hidden manner amen and that is only given to a separated people amen praise the Lord God starts feeding you with manner that was stored up food and hidden up there for his glory amen only them that are in there can eat that because only them that are in there that are permitted to eat that just the people that are there are permitted and knows it what it is they can eat that Paul said changing from Glory onto Glory finally it will take you back to its original Glory you believe that amen you come from God's thoughts down and go through the entire cycle of life and the time comes when he he brings you out of your Amnesia to recognize who you are and say now I'm taking you back to where you really come from you are not from this world is not your home you're just passing through your Treasures are LED up Way Beyond the blue amen praise God forevermore changing from glory to glory and bringing you bring it back to its original Glory because it's the seed of the Morning Glory oh praise God you believe that I said we are seeds of the Morning Glory Hallelujah yes sir the seed of the Morning Glory coming back to its original oh that's exactly what the church has done come down through Luther Western all them things right through coming back to the original grain then that original Grand going back to its original Glory back to glory amen oh praise God that it had at the beginning oh the same sun shining down upon the lives of the elect bringing and producing the hidden manner once again praise God hallelujah they don't have to think about it Supernatural Manner manifesting and working through their lives and thank God in closing it's now it's right to bring him back now that it is right to bring him back like he was at the beginning oh my the same Holy Ghost and that same one that came down on the death Pentecost that same one is the one that is manifesting himself here today from Glory unto Glory unto glory and back to the original seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost same kind of people in this day acting the same way with the same power in them they may have the same Sensations but it's from Glory unto glory and then the next stage change from this Glory that they have into a glory of body like his own glorious body and then we shall see him as he is like Abraham saw him he's referring to that the so you're seeing so much that you don't realize it but you are already experiencing and going through your body change in preparation for the great Rapture that is at hand no no astronaut just takes off and jumps in a rocket ship but he has to be prepared to go in and pressurize with trials and troubles and tribulations press your eyes to go into that rocket ship I'm glad we are pressurized for this journey let them let the musicians come at this hour praise the name of the Lord hallelujah thanks be to God Amen you brothers and preachers can take it from here because I didn't I wouldn't didn't even get to uh you know the badger skin and the dyed ramskin that was tied with red blood the colors of blue and purple and so on on the robe on the veil is a symbol also of Joseph's Coats of Many Colors and those colors are the type of symbolic of this uh seven Church ages amen praise God God hid himself behind those ages covered by the Technicolor Dreamcoat Joseph's technical Dream Coat and praise God we are living in that day now when we see all those colors merging and flashing and changing but we understand what God is doing in this hour but it's the same thing happening in our day and in our time and we are so glad that we can be a part of it and we willingly starting text let those that are wise-hearted come to me and bring an offering and and the

has now changed for this meeting to be a an official meeting again we would love to open this or start this meeting of the results of the nominations with one person now moving the nomination for the opening of this meeting and a second one giving a second to it maybe we have that now who okay speak loud enough whoever you are Wherever You Are very good brother coffee and we move motion for the meeting to go into progress who seconds up brother Corey Cohen seconds the motion that this meeting goes into progress we thank God the meeting is now open praise the lord we want to thank God for his grace God bless you we are God bless you all so the meeting is now opened we had a wonderful uh meeting for the balloting of these nominations and you know myself and my precious wife sister Desiree or sister Pam as many of you know her and may be aware of her we went through that we went through it together say oh well uh how could two of you go through that do you trust them well you see the thing about it this church was founded and started by the grace of God through me uh are true us so therefore you don't have to even think anything like that if it comes down to that and we want to take that other side and that road we could name whoever we wanted did you hear me don't just stay silent I want you to know make sure that you understand it that I could do that and I have the right to do that and the power to do that but that's not what God wanted right so so so then so that you might clearly understand that nothing has to be done behind the scenes no nothing has to be done behind the scenes so praise the Lord I just left it in God's hand and we prayed that God would move in by his holy spirit and we prayed over the nomination box and the ballots that were there and then the opening of The Box the counting of it and the recording of it of which we will give the final accounting and keep it I don't mean I'll announce that but we'll we'll keep that as part of the history of the church it'll be there but now to let you know but this hour that there were eight nominations eight persons were nominated from the eight persons nominated uh about six of those individuals withdrew of their own accord an actual fact some of those individuals not some all of them have actually sent me written some emails some in handwriting attesting to their own withdrawal right so nobody asked them to withdraw or tell them to withdraw or influence them to withdraw they withdrew of their own accord different reasons some feel they were not really ready and so on and that's it but six persons withdrew and that leaves us with only two nominations and those nominations happen to be first of all our brother Tim beers would you stand brother Tim praise the name of the Lord praise the Lord ah Hallelujah God is God praise the Lord and we have the shortest brother in the church brother Danny mozilli praise the Lord God bless you praise the Lord God bless you I cause them to stand up that you if you don't know them you'll recognize them become more familiar with them and in the uh weeks ahead from now until July you will be able to because most of you already know them is that right is that right I I'm saying that and I want to have your Ascent to what I'm saying because later on you can turn around and say well I I didn't really know him you see I'm really doing so now I'm bringing this to you for you to acknowledge I don't know them but now when you knew them that might not have been on your thoughts but now they are nominated you will be thinking more in your thoughts of pastoral duties and responsibilities and things like that and that is what I want you to focus in on what God can do true individuals how we can use the badger skins to reflect himself for his glory because it's not my church it's God's Church I was only blessed and allowed to be the shepherd of this church but the real leadership of the church is Jesus Christ pastoral Ministry the the elders in the church right on down to the last person that does anything around here that's how the leadership goes right down by the Holy Spirit unto him be the glory so friends that's the way it is we have to to repeat we have two nominees and by the way let you to let you know all those who withdrew have I I have written uh records of that that will also be kept that you're not just listening to me making this announcement hearing my voice and hearing me say this uh and not having the backing for it right because I repeat because when this is all over this has got to be accounted for because the government has a part of this behind the scenes they have to know who will emerge from this and who will be the one that they can look to for the responsibilities right of the entire church it's not really it looks like usually it seems and looks like a very nice position but that's just the uh popular opinion and that's just the visible outward appearance but behind the scenes the real Pastor is a burden Bearer of the four beasts that were around the Throne of God they had the eagle the man there was one The Oxen that was a symbol of the minister who constantly Bears the burdens of the people constantly and so that is what it's all about along with just being the visible leader that receives acclimations and this stuff sort of thing then also there is a part where he Bears the responsibilities and so it's a serious and sacred thing and a sacred hour but I am blessed and I praise God that this is not a minister or ministers coming from somewhere outside uh that are being imported in but these are people who have come up right from amongst us from since they were young men right just married just starting their families coming right up and have grown right through those times right to this hour where the fruits of God beginning to show in their lives so God bless you both brother Danny God bless you God bless you brother Tim and may the Holy Spirit speak to the hearts of God's people now book of Acts it says and when they had prayed and fasted then they began to choose from among themselves and that's what I want you to do in these coming weeks ahead you begin to seek God praying your own heart maybe the person you nominated was not the one that stands here as a nominee uh maybe the person who you were thinking could take this position are not the ones that are here today but this is the way God wants to do it right as the brother Brandon said it clearly he says just he says many times I wanted this but the majority goes this way and I can see that it was God so I just went with the majority right so let the Holy Spirit have his way and I thank God the fruits of the ministry are right in front of you right from the fruits of the ministry you're not going to have something that was like a cloven foot that was hidden up or some kind of a clause or something but men that were raised up under this this ministry with a clear understanding of the word and growing in Jesus Christ and emerging and may God bless them both praise the Lord let's bar heads and pray for them briefly our gracious Heavenly Father we bring these two ministering spirits to stand before your throne and With Your Eyes Upon them with all the Angels surrounding them around the throne watching them Lord Jesus let the Holy Spirit have his way let him make his own choosing and then for your glory and praise may you be honored and worshiped and may the church grow and move on each one in his own time may you be glorified shall God be the glory great things he has done so lovely the world that he gave us his son now father we ask you to give us your pastor after your own heart for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and let everybody if you agree with me say aloud amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so let it be amen means so let it be and that is what we say so let it be God bless you now would someone move the uh closing of this meeting move emotion and let it be seconded praise the Lord amen God bless you brother Corey most at this meeting comes to an end let's go Amen brother Desmond seconds the motion praise the Lord God bless you this meeting now comes to an end and we can now disperse musicians you might come song leader may want to come back for a brief moment while the people find their way out from where they are back to their vehicles into the foyer giving praise we welcome you and be happy for every one of you that are here today we pray that God will go with you the holy spirit will continue to speak into your heart long after you've left this meeting that the calls of Fire you know in the old days you would light a fire and you think you put it out but below there something is still burning and I pray that that will happen the service comes to an end what may the coals of fire keep burning within your heart and the wind will blow once again and we see Flames coming forth to the glory of God God bless you brother just take it and sing a few songs [Music] I just wanna die stays for I know [Music] I know he will guide me foreign [Music] full week he never failed me [Music] this one day [Music] oh Jesus [Music] [Applause] wherever Jesus Christ [Music] this one thing everywhere [Music] Jesus [Music] yes [Music] I threw his blood with him [Music] and he took my place so that I through his love
