[17:09] I'll ask Pastor Danny just to pray for
[17:11] us.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, [music] Lord.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; We just so appreciate the opportunity
[17:26] this evening, Lord, to be in your
[17:28] presence.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; Once again, Lord, we appreciate the
[17:32] Bible study Wednesday nights where we
[17:35] can gather in uh such an atmosphere, oh
[17:39] God, where you can teach and reveal
[17:42] things from your word, Lord, that uh
[17:44] would give us strength
[17:46] &gt;&gt; for the journey, Father.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; And so we ask that you would take
[17:49] control over the service tonight. Bless
[17:51] our our dear brotheres Emmanuel. Oh God,
[17:54] [music] may your spirit just come and
[17:56] direct his thoughts.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; And place them exactly where they need
[18:00] to be in our hearts, oh God.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; And let it all be done for your glory.
[18:04] [music]
[18:05] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[18:09] Amen. Amen. God bless you, saints of
[18:12] God. It's good to [clears throat] be in
[18:13] the house of the Lord.
[18:15] Um, you know, it's rough weather
[18:19] outside, but it's always a sacrifice.
[18:22] Well, God blesses your sacrifice
[18:24] whenever you come here. So, we are
[18:26] grateful and thank you musicians. God
[18:28] bless you. So without wasting too much
[18:31] time, uh we're just going to be very
[18:34] brief tonight and u just go through a
[18:37] very simple message and I trust that uh
[18:40] the Lord will speak to your hearts and
[18:43] uh just give you something that you can
[18:46] use to keep fighting this battle.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So while we are standing, we're
[18:52] going to turn to our scriptures and read
[18:54] from St. John chapter 13.
[18:57] St. John chapter 13. Tonight I just want
[19:00] to speak on a simple subject. When love
[19:05] projects.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. When love projects.
[19:10] All right. So St. John chapter 13 verse
[19:13] uh 34 and 35. [clears throat]
[19:18] Praise God. It says, "A new commandment
[19:21] I give unto you,
[19:24] that ye love one another, as I have
[19:29] loved you, that ye also love one
[19:32] another.
[19:34] By this
[19:38] shall all men know that ye are my
[19:43] disciples,
[19:45] if ye love one another.
[19:49] Praise God. You may have your seats.
[19:52] [clears throat]
[19:53] So tonight I just want to uh speak on
[19:57] this subject when love projects
[20:00] and um
[20:02] we all know as human beings we are we
[20:06] all have that fundamental desire to be
[20:10] loved.
[20:12] And this is a need that God placed in
[20:15] every one of us and it needs to be
[20:18] satisfied I believe both in man and in
[20:22] God as well.
[20:25] You know the Bible tells us that we
[20:27] should love the Lord our God with all of
[20:30] our hearts with all of our strength. So
[20:32] you can see that even God himself he has
[20:36] a desire in him to be loved. Amen. And I
[20:41] don't think there's anyone here tonight
[20:44] who
[20:48] enjoys the experience of hatred.
[20:53] Amen.
[20:55] We like to be loved. We like to be
[20:57] appreciated.
[20:59] And so this is just going back to the
[21:01] one of the fundamental principles that
[21:04] Christ talks about when he said in the
[21:07] scripture that we read that by this
[21:10] shall all men know that you are my
[21:15] disciples.
[21:17] Amen.
[21:18] So I believe that love is the the
[21:22] greatest or one of the greatest uh marks
[21:25] of true disciplehip because that's what
[21:28] Jesus said that when you can express
[21:31] love to one another then this is how men
[21:34] will identify you as being one of my
[21:38] disciples.
[21:39] Praise God. And so since the inception
[21:43] of the message which we know that uh
[21:46] this message has been around for well
[21:48] over 60 years and for those who've been
[21:51] around the message circles
[21:54] uh you know we've witnessed a lot of
[21:57] things that have happened
[21:59] uh you know time has proven that you
[22:02] know without love
[22:05] at the center of every doctrine or
[22:10] the great personalities that have come
[22:12] and gone.
[22:14] It all comes to nothing when there is an
[22:18] absence of godly love.
[22:20] We've seen all these things happen.
[22:23] Doctrines have come,
[22:26] personalities have risen, but you see,
[22:28] without love being at the center of it
[22:31] all, it all comes down to nothing.
[22:34] And I believe this testifies to what
[22:36] Paul uh was speaking about in 1
[22:39] Corinthians chapter 13 when he said
[22:42] these words. He says, "Though I speak
[22:45] with the tongues of men and of angels
[22:49] and have not charity,
[22:52] I I am become as sounding brass or a
[22:56] tinkling symbol."
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Verse two.
[23:02] And though I have the gift of prophecy
[23:06] and understand all mysteries
[23:11] and all knowledge,
[23:15] and though I have all faith,
[23:18] so that I could remove mountains and
[23:22] have not charity,
[23:25] I am nothing.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I think that establishes the
[23:32] foundation of real true Christianity
[23:35] that no matter what we claim to be or
[23:38] have without love we are nothing.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I want to read this quote
[23:46] where uh in this message God projecting
[23:49] his love the prophet says this. He says,
[23:52] "And I think if one thing is needed in
[23:55] the great universal church of God
[23:58] tonight is love,
[24:01] we do not need other things as much as
[24:05] we think."
[24:08] And all these other things, our emotions
[24:13] and our gifts,
[24:16] they are wonderful.
[24:18] And to God we give praise. But
[24:22] if those gifts are not governed by love,
[24:27] then they are not effective.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Can we all say amen to that?
[24:34] &gt;&gt; He says love should govern the home.
[24:39] Love is the greatest force that was ever
[24:42] put into the power of men.
[24:46] A home thus not disciplined by love is
[24:51] not much of a home.
[24:54] If the husband
[24:57] and wife does not solemnly love one
[25:01] another, they cannot trust
[25:04] each other. Praise God. Then he says,
[25:07] "That's why I think that instead of
[25:10] resting our faith upon some emotion
[25:14] which is all right or some gift which is
[25:19] all right like shouting, speaking with
[25:22] tongues or with other things that we
[25:25] take for saying that we have the Holy
[25:28] Spirit when we do these things." In
[25:31] other words, evidences
[25:35] those things are all right. But if we
[25:38] would come back to the principle
[25:42] love first and then those things I those
[25:47] things I think our church would progress
[25:50] a lot faster if we would get God first
[25:55] &gt;&gt; and God is love.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:59] Now, I want to talk about
[26:03] wounded Christians
[26:06] because I think that
[26:12] you know in this message or in this
[26:14] Christian walk at least I can talk about
[26:17] my own experience.
[26:20] you find that there are a lot of hurting
[26:22] people who are still trying to serve God
[26:25] but with deep scars, complexes and
[26:28] things that have not really been dealt
[26:30] with.
[26:32] And you know,
[26:36] I believe that no matter how much
[26:40] a situation exists in a person's life,
[26:44] until it's dealt with, you really cannot
[26:47] progress.
[26:49] And so the idea of brushing things under
[26:52] the carpet and pretending like it
[26:53] doesn't exist. Well, we as human beings,
[26:57] we might do that, but God does not want
[27:00] us to operate like that.
[27:03] Praise God.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus said that he whom the son has set
[27:08] free is free indeed. And I believe that
[27:12] God wants all of his children to be
[27:16] happy, to be free, to enjoy life, to
[27:20] enjoy their Christian walk, just to be
[27:23] happy Christians.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no need for us to carry
[27:28] bondages and and weights of things of
[27:31] the past. God wants us to be free. Amen.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; So
[27:38] whenever you open your heart to express
[27:40] love to people,
[27:42] I want you to understand that you are
[27:44] actually potentially
[27:47] opening up yourself to be scarred.
[27:52] And I'll back up that statement.
[27:56] You enter into a position of being
[27:58] vulnerable
[28:01] and which sometimes can lead to inward
[28:03] pain.
[28:04] and scars in our spirits.
[28:09] And you've noticed this for people who
[28:11] are very loving. You find that people
[28:14] who tend to love
[28:16] the most are the ones who easily get
[28:19] hurt.
[28:21] Is that right?
[28:24] You've heard this saying that
[28:28] um or you find that people who are
[28:31] considered nice people
[28:33] often times the world looks at that
[28:35] today as a sign of weakness. And many
[28:39] times people will try to exploit those
[28:41] individuals because they think that
[28:44] being nice or loving is weakness. And so
[28:48] when people open their hearts, basically
[28:51] what you're doing is that you are
[28:52] placing yourself in a position of being
[28:55] vulnerable to being hurt.
[28:58] But it does not mean that you should
[29:01] shut yourself up. We are still required
[29:04] to love one another, to open our hearts
[29:07] for each other.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[29:11] So you look at the example of the lily
[29:15] of the valley.
[29:17] This is a a a plant or the flower which
[29:22] of course the prophet talked about A LOT
[29:24] IS ALWAYS GIVING.
[29:29] It's always vulnerable.
[29:32] It's selfless,
[29:34] kind, and expecting nothing in return.
[29:39] Amen.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:42] And so this reinforces the the idea that
[29:46] when it comes to loving one another, we
[29:49] should not really expect anything in
[29:50] return.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul was talking about.
[29:59] He defines what love is. I I won't go
[30:02] back to that because of time.
[30:05] So it's a paradox just like the lily of
[30:07] the valley or the the flower the lily
[30:10] flower
[30:12] it has to be crushed
[30:15] in order to produce what perfume
[30:19] AND SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR US
[30:22] Christians
[30:25] if we are expected to be the
[30:29] expressions of love
[30:32] the ones who actually the prophet says
[30:34] says that actually true love will only
[30:36] be found in the bride.
[30:39] So if this attribute of love is to be
[30:43] expressed through the bride, that means
[30:46] that there will be moments in our lives
[30:48] where we are going to be crushed.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; You must expect those moments to come.
[30:55] And so I want to encourage you tonight
[30:57] that when those things happen, don't
[31:00] allow those moments to put you in a
[31:04] place where you develop a complex
[31:06] because it's so easy
[31:08] &gt;&gt; to get into a complex.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; And people who get into that state
[31:14] eventually they shut themselves up
[31:16] &gt;&gt; because they are wounded.
[31:19] And a wounded animal is very very
[31:23] defensive.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; So
[31:30] I want to look at the characteristics
[31:33] that were displayed in our Lord Jesus
[31:40] because I think he was the greatest
[31:41] example
[31:43] of how we should be like. So going to
[31:47] Isaiah 53, a very familiar scripture. I
[31:51] want to read it and just break it down.
[31:53] It says this in verse two.
[31:56] For he shall grow up before him as a
[31:59] tender plant,
[32:02] and as a root out of a dry ground. He
[32:07] hath no form nor clumliness. And when we
[32:10] shall see him, there is no beauty that
[32:13] we should desire him. Just picture this
[32:16] now as we read this. The image that is
[32:19] being painted of what kind of a
[32:21] personality our Lord would be.
[32:24] Okay? He is present tense despised
[32:31] and rejected of men,
[32:34] a man of sorrows and acquainted with
[32:38] grief.
[32:41] And we hid as it were our faces from
[32:44] him. Then watch this. He was despised.
[32:52] That to me is the fulfillment of Hebrews
[32:56] 13:8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[32:59] today, and forever. Because if he is
[33:02] despised now, in what form is he being
[33:04] despised?
[33:06] He's not here physically, but he's in
[33:08] you, in every one of us.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[33:13] So he was despised and we esteemed him
[33:17] not not. So I want you to notice the
[33:20] consistency of the scripture. Verse
[33:22] four. Surely he hath borne our griefs
[33:26] and carried our sorrows. This was the
[33:30] kind of a man that our Lord was.
[33:33] Yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten of
[33:36] God, and afflicted.
[33:38] But he was wounded for our
[33:40] transgressions. So these were now the
[33:42] attributes that came out of him. A
[33:44] healer.
[33:46] He was bruised for our iniquities. The
[33:50] chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[33:53] And by his stripes we are healed.
[34:01] A byproduct of being crushed.
[34:05] A man acquainted with sorrow,
[34:08] acquainted with grief, despised,
[34:12] rejected,
[34:13] not being esteemed. And yet from this
[34:16] came our healing, our salvation.
[34:20] So what about us?
[34:23] What should we be as Christians,
[34:27] followers of Christ?
[34:30] Do we
[34:32] do we give up so quickly just because
[34:35] some minor thing happens?
[34:38] Maybe some misunderstanding and we are
[34:40] ready to call it quits.
[34:43] Look at our Lord the things he went
[34:45] through rejected of men. We esteemed him
[34:48] not. And yet from that after God crushed
[34:52] him today we are beneficiaries because
[34:55] we get our healing from what came out of
[34:57] this. Praise God. And so under the
[35:00] weight of rejection and persecution,
[35:03] Jesus stood the test. Why? Because he
[35:07] was built to stand this test. Amen.
[35:12] Now, every mortal being
[35:15] has buckled under the pressure of
[35:17] rejection
[35:19] and persecution.
[35:21] I'll be the first to admit that I'm
[35:24] guilty.
[35:26] Every one of us, I'm sure at some point
[35:28] in our lives, we have come to that place
[35:30] where we feel like giving up.
[35:36] Look at brother Brham and let's study
[35:42] this story that he talks about of the
[35:46] complex that he developed
[35:49] as a result of being rejected.
[35:54] Amen.
[35:56] Are we familiar with this message
[35:58] standing in the gap? And I'm going to
[36:00] read portions of this because there's
[36:02] something I want to bring out here which
[36:04] I think is very relevant
[36:07] to show me and you that
[36:11] even brother Brham as gifted as he was
[36:15] as much as God used him he buckled under
[36:20] the pressure.
[36:24] He says this, "Moses lost the feeling."
[36:29] I want to emphasize on that word, the
[36:31] feeling
[36:33] of his people because they won't listen
[36:36] to him. And brother Roy, you see your
[36:39] dream. I'll just skip. Now I I now I
[36:41] want I cannot go now. He says, "Now I
[36:44] cannot go with a ministry like that
[36:47] until I feel different in my heart about
[36:51] it. no matter if God did tell me. I'll
[36:56] read that again
[36:59] until I feel different in my heart about
[37:02] it.
[37:04] No matter if God did tell me, but that
[37:09] is that change that brother Roy
[37:13] uh saw coming.
[37:15] Something has got to change me
[37:20] because in my heart if I go out there
[37:24] feeling the way I do now
[37:27] I still feel that they ought to have
[37:30] heard the message.
[37:33] So, brother Brham is expressing telling
[37:36] us that something has to change in his
[37:40] heart and that is a feeling
[37:43] because he had developed a complex and
[37:46] this complex had changed the way he felt
[37:49] towards his brethren.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS AND I DON'T HAVE the feeling
[37:59] for the PEOPLE THAT I SHOULD HAVE. I
[38:03] LIKE his honesty.
[38:05] Until I can get that feeling,
[38:10] there is no need in me going because I'd
[38:13] be a hypocrite.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God for an honest man.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; And all these years I've tried to serve
[38:22] him with a true heart. And I won't go
[38:24] out being a hyp being a hypocrite.
[38:28] Listen to this again. I got to feel
[38:32] that. There's a reason why I'm
[38:34] emphasizing on that word feel because
[38:36] sometimes
[38:38] we become so desensitized and we you
[38:41] heard people say, "Well, what does
[38:43] feelings have to do with it?" Well,
[38:44] we're going to see. We're going to see.
[38:47] He says that it isn't Ricky and Ricetta
[38:51] and it isn't this bunch. It's God's
[38:54] children that's in bondage that I must
[38:57] go to. Until I can feel that way, I'll
[39:02] just have to loaf around, preach some
[39:04] conventions and things. But wait,
[39:09] praise God.
[39:13] Now,
[39:15] we've all been misunderstood in our
[39:18] lives at some point or another. Every
[39:21] one of us has been misunderstood.
[39:28] And sometimes it doesn't matter how good
[39:31] our intentions might be, we will be
[39:34] misunderstood.
[39:37] You will be misjudged even with good
[39:40] intentions.
[39:42] I believe it's just part of life.
[39:47] Sometimes people will resent you.
[39:50] It could be at work. It could even
[39:53] sometimes be at home or even ministers
[39:57] preaching behind the pullpit. Sometimes
[40:00] it's in fact some of the worst places
[40:02] you can feel a spirit of resentment
[40:04] moving.
[40:07] Oh yeah, it can be felt
[40:11] right from the pulpit.
[40:15] Now just imagine brother Abraham how he
[40:17] felt with the gift that he had to be
[40:20] able to discern and look and see what
[40:22] was going on in the hearts of the people
[40:24] and he knew for example let's just use
[40:26] brother Kofi for example that he's
[40:28] resenting everything that I'm saying
[40:30] criticizing everything that I'm saying
[40:32] and yet
[40:35] behave like nothing is going on and
[40:38] still be able to treat him like a
[40:39] brother and mean
[40:48] These things happen in life.
[40:51] And I believe God is bringing us to a
[40:54] place where he is now coming to the
[40:58] part where the rubber meets the road
[41:02] because this gospel that we have the
[41:05] message
[41:07] I don't believe is meant to just remain
[41:09] here but it should come here.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. whereby
[41:14] it's no longer what we just say
[41:18] with our mouths, but it's what our lives
[41:22] speak
[41:24] without necessarily saying it with our
[41:26] mouth.
[41:28] For by this shall men know that you are
[41:30] my disciples
[41:32] when they can see Christ on display.
[41:38] It [snorts] doesn't matter how much I
[41:39] can talk and how revelated I sound, even
[41:42] how much I can preach, that means
[41:43] nothing. At the end of the day, it's
[41:47] when I walk out or we all walk out of
[41:49] these doors and we go to our homes, our
[41:51] jobs and whatnot and the people at work
[41:54] see the way we live, the way we treat
[41:56] one another, our husbands, our wives,
[41:58] our kids, that is where it really
[42:01] matters.
[42:03] Amen.
[42:05] So
[42:06] God expects every one of us to be
[42:09] responsible and sensitive with how we
[42:12] treat one another.
[42:15] Why? Because humans, I'm coming back to
[42:18] this word, have feelings.
[42:23] Brother Danny is not made out of bricks.
[42:26] He's not made out of wood or stone. any
[42:30] e every one of us we are human beings
[42:33] who have feelings.
[42:36] We are made out of flesh and blood with
[42:40] five senses
[42:43] both in our flesh and in our spirit.
[42:47] So in the flesh we have see, taste,
[42:50] smell, touch, hear. And the prophet says
[42:53] in our spirit we also have imagination,
[42:56] reasoning, conscience, re uh memory and
[42:59] affection.
[43:02] Amen. And those aspects of our humanity
[43:07] get affected.
[43:09] And so sometimes, like I said earlier
[43:11] on, we cannot just say, well, it doesn't
[43:13] really matter how you feel.
[43:20] Because in Hebrews chapter 4:E1 15 it
[43:23] says this.
[43:25] For we have an high priest
[43:28] which cannot be touched
[43:31] with the feeling
[43:34] of our infirmities
[43:36] but WAS IN ALL POINTS TEMPTED like we
[43:40] are yet without sin.
[43:42] I want to read the amplified version
[43:44] because I think it will express it
[43:46] better.
[43:48] For we do not have a high priest who is
[43:53] unable to sympathize
[43:56] and understand our weakness and
[44:01] temptations.
[44:03] But one who has been tempted knowing
[44:06] exactly how it feels to be human in
[44:10] every aspect as we are yet without
[44:14] committing any sin.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[44:17] So when you are sick and laying in bed
[44:20] in pain,
[44:24] you know, Jesus has to be able to
[44:27] understand what it feels like.
[44:30] When you are rejected, persecuted, the
[44:34] Bible says that he understands how you
[44:37] feel. So in order for him to be the
[44:40] right kind of a high priest,
[44:43] he must be able to have to understand
[44:46] how we feel
[44:50] because the Bible says he's touched with
[44:52] the feeling
[44:54] of our infirmities.
[45:00] I want to use one example
[45:03] of Apostle Peter, Peter the Apostle.
[45:07] Now we all know uh Peter was one of the
[45:10] most outspoken men among the disciples
[45:13] of Jesus.
[45:15] He was um
[45:18] well
[45:20] at times in trouble with his mouth
[45:22] saying things rebuking the Lord and
[45:24] whatnot.
[45:26] But you know I like Peter because he was
[45:28] just who he was.
[45:30] There was nothing to hide about him.
[45:33] What you saw is what you got. Amen.
[45:37] And you remember that when Jesus was
[45:40] going to Calvary,
[45:44] Peter feeling that he had so much zeal
[45:49] and he felt that it he he had what it
[45:52] took
[45:54] to stand that moment when
[45:59] men were going to forsake Jesus.
[46:02] You remember what Peter said that
[46:05] as for me I will not deny you Lord.
[46:10] And Jesus turned around and says you
[46:12] know what Peter before the Crows
[46:17] you will deny me three times.
[46:23] Well, it looked like Peter with his
[46:24] boldness,
[46:27] you know, he would he would have
[46:28] actually been successful in carrying out
[46:32] the way he felt.
[46:35] But you know, God is not a liar.
[46:38] He knew exactly what was going to
[46:39] happen. Amen.
[46:42] And we know the story.
[46:45] Peter eventually denied him three times.
[46:48] Exactly like what Jesus said.
[46:51] Now, I want to bring this out just to
[46:54] show you that
[46:57] because I believe Peter meant well and
[46:59] sometimes even in our best efforts to do
[47:02] what's right, we do the wrong things.
[47:07] And you could just imagine how Peter
[47:09] felt
[47:10] when he heard that crow and the
[47:14] words of Jesus now coming to his memory
[47:18] knowing that he had denied the prince of
[47:20] life. Put yourself in his shoe and
[47:23] imagine what he felt like.
[47:30] And just to show you that God is mindful
[47:33] of what we go through, I want to read
[47:36] this passage of scripture found in Mark
[47:38] chapter 16.
[47:41] And we will see what happens here.
[47:44] This is now after the resurrection of
[47:47] our Lord. And when the Sabbath was
[47:50] passed, Mary Magdalene, the mother of
[47:52] James Salom, had bought sweet spices
[47:56] that they might come and anoint him. And
[47:59] very early in the morning, the first day
[48:01] of the week, they came unto the sepiler
[48:04] at the rising of the sun, and said among
[48:06] themselves, who shall roll away the
[48:08] stone from the door of the sepilchar?
[48:11] And when they looked, they saw that the
[48:13] stone was rolled away.
[48:16] And entering into the sepiler, they saw
[48:19] a young man, this was now an angel,
[48:21] sitting on the right side, clothed in a
[48:24] long white garment. And they were
[48:27] afrighted.
[48:29] And he said unto them, "Be not afraid.
[48:32] Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was
[48:35] crucified. He is risen. He is not here."
[48:38] Now watch this in verse 7. But go your
[48:42] way.
[48:44] Tell his disciples
[48:47] and Peter that he goeth before you into
[48:51] Galilee.
[48:53] I believe that God was trying to make it
[48:57] very personal that Peter, I am mindful
[49:00] of you
[49:01] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to address you very
[49:06] specifically just TO YOU PETER.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; TELL MY disciples and Peter,
[49:13] HALLELUJAH, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT GOD
[49:16] KNEW the condition that Peter was in
[49:19] &gt;&gt; and so he needed comfort. He needed
[49:22] encouragement. He needed to know that
[49:24] Peter, even though you messed up, it's
[49:26] not finished.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; So God is mindful of how you feel.
[49:36] I believe God is very personal
[49:39] and sometimes you know we try to present
[49:42] a God who is so mysterious but I don't
[49:44] believe God is so mysterious.
[49:47] And you know the prophet talked about uh
[49:49] he told that story of that boy you know
[49:51] who was um you know there was a
[49:53] thunderstorm and he ran to his mom and
[49:55] said you know you know I I want to I
[49:58] want a god with skin on. And sometimes I
[50:01] think we just want to experience God
[50:04] with skin on. A brother that you can go
[50:07] to a sister and feel that God is in my
[50:12] brother is in my sister.
[50:15] Amen.
[50:16] That's what I believe this gospel is
[50:18] about. God with skin on. And it's not
[50:22] always what we say to people that leaves
[50:25] an impact, but it's always how you make
[50:29] others feel
[50:31] in your presence.
[50:38] Talk is cheap,
[50:41] but our actions speak louder than
[50:44] anything that we could ever say.
[50:49] You see, like tonight,
[50:52] maybe after a week, after a month or
[50:54] three months from now, you may forget
[50:56] everything that I've said in this sermon
[50:58] tonight or any other minister, every
[51:00] true servant of God.
[51:04] You might forget everything,
[51:06] but you will never forget how I treat
[51:10] you once I walk out of those doors.
[51:13] How I make you feel. How I interact with
[51:16] you. my attitude and whatn not that will
[51:20] leave an impact
[51:22] not so much my sermon as good as it
[51:25] might be or any minister but it's the
[51:27] way we treat one another
[51:30] and the prophet says this and did you
[51:32] know you are a little creator yourself
[51:37] you know that certainly
[51:39] you've seen people that you just love to
[51:42] be around you don't know why
[51:46] just that loving type of person. Have
[51:48] you seen that?
[51:51] Just kind. You like to be around them.
[51:56] They create that atmosphere
[52:00] by the life they live, the way they
[52:03] talk, their conversation.
[52:08] Then you've seen those that every time
[52:10] you shun them,
[52:13] you know what I'm talking about.
[52:16] all the time they want to talk about
[52:18] something evil and talk about somebody
[52:21] else
[52:24] say, "Oh, there they come. They're going
[52:26] to criticize somebody there. Here he is
[52:29] now. He's going to talk about this man.
[52:34] You just hate to get around them." See,
[52:38] because they create and then he says
[52:41] this, seemingly pretty nice people, but
[52:46] they create that atmosphere.
[52:51] Seemingly nice people, but they create
[52:53] an atmosphere.
[52:56] You know, if we feed on gossip
[53:01] and talking about other people,
[53:04] even though
[53:06] you might not be heard, but it creates
[53:10] an atmosphere
[53:12] whereby
[53:14] if you're sensitive enough to the spirit
[53:16] of God, you will just feel that distance
[53:18] towards that person.
[53:20] seemingly nice people
[53:23] and the prophecies but you just shun
[53:25] them just feel no I'm not comfortable
[53:28] around this person because we create
[53:30] atmospheres
[53:34] so it's important what we feed on the
[53:36] things that we talk about even the
[53:39] meditations of our hearts like David
[53:41] said let the words of my mouth and the
[53:45] meditations of my heart be acceptable in
[53:48] thy sight oh Lord because those things
[53:51] create atmospheres.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; So,
[53:55] do feelings matter to God? I believe
[53:57] they do.
[53:59] And I'm going to wind down with this.
[54:02] I just want to come back to what I began
[54:05] with
[54:06] and speak on offenses and forgiveness
[54:10] because I believe that it's very
[54:12] important.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Offenses and forgiveness.
[54:18] You know, in my Christian walk, I've
[54:21] come across a lot of believers
[54:26] and in trying to serve God, you find
[54:29] that like I said earlier on, they are
[54:31] wounded people.
[54:35] In other words, there are many people
[54:37] who are just merely coping.
[54:40] Even though on the surface everything
[54:41] looks fine, but they're just really just
[54:44] coping.
[54:46] And you find that when you fellowship
[54:50] with such people, such individuals,
[54:53] really what they need in their lives is
[54:55] some form of closure.
[55:00] They need some form of closure
[55:02] to really get rid of those deep scars
[55:06] that they're carrying.
[55:08] And you know, I find that it's so easy
[55:10] to tell people, especially those who've
[55:12] been hurt, that, "Oh, you know what?
[55:15] Just forgive and forget.
[55:18] Just forgive and forget.
[55:21] Yes, it's scriptural that we must
[55:24] forgive. Every Christian must forgive.
[55:26] It's true. But that's only half of the
[55:29] coin.
[55:31] Because the the Bible tells us in
[55:33] Proverbs chapter 18, he says, "A brother
[55:36] offended
[55:38] is harder to be worn than a strong
[55:42] city." and their contentions are like
[55:45] the bars of a castle.
[55:49] So even though God stills still expects
[55:52] us to display unconditional love to our
[55:55] enemies,
[55:57] it does not give us the license to
[56:00] offend others. Sorry. However, this is
[56:03] not a license for those who offend to
[56:06] escape accountability.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:11] Romans 5:8 says this, "But God commended
[56:15] his love towards us in that while we
[56:18] were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
[56:22] While we were yet sinners, Christ died
[56:24] for us.
[56:26] But God is still waiting for every one
[56:29] of us at the door of Acts 2:38 whereby
[56:32] he says, "Repent."
[56:35] SO WHEN WE COME TO GOD, GOD STILL
[56:37] REQUIRES WHAT? REPENTANCE.
[56:42] That's the first thing he says. Repent
[56:45] and be baptized. I'm just using that as
[56:47] a concept to show you that
[56:51] offending people
[56:54] and expecting just to
[56:56] walk free. Meanwhile, somebody is
[56:59] drowning with scars. You are still
[57:03] responsible to make that thing right.
[57:07] Especially if I know I've hurt my
[57:09] brother or done wrong to him, I owe it
[57:12] to God. I owe it to my brother to put
[57:14] that thing right. Praise God.
[57:18] And so sometimes
[57:21] we forget these things
[57:23] and you find that
[57:27] people start to look at Christianity
[57:31] as some hypocritical
[57:33] religion.
[57:35] And that's exactly what the devil wants
[57:37] to paint this gospel as. Because
[57:41] if he can get people to believe that
[57:44] Christianity is just hypoc, that's
[57:47] exactly what he wants. And yet we know
[57:50] that
[57:52] well the gospel of Christ is the truth.
[57:57] So Joseph in the Bible, we're familiar
[57:59] with this story. I'm just going to use
[58:01] this to wind down.
[58:03] Before Joseph could reveal himself to
[58:05] his brethren in Egypt,
[58:08] I believe that there was one attribute
[58:10] that he was looking for
[58:13] before he made himself known to his
[58:15] brethren.
[58:17] And so why did Joseph demand? You
[58:20] remember when when his brethren came, he
[58:23] demanded that Benjamin, the youngest
[58:25] one, be kept back as his servant.
[58:29] After the silver cup was placed in one
[58:31] of the sacks and was found in his in
[58:34] Benjamin sacks, Joseph said, "As for
[58:37] Benjamin, keep him behind here. The rest
[58:40] you can go."
[58:42] I believe that Joseph was using Benjamin
[58:45] as the litmos test because he wanted to
[58:48] see one thing in his brethren.
[58:51] Those same brothers who had at some
[58:53] point displayed such hatred,
[58:58] animosity that they were willing to kill
[59:01] him or even sell him off. He wanted to
[59:04] see if those same brothers had now
[59:07] changed and that brotherly kindness had
[59:10] now taken a hold.
[59:15] Because remember, Joseph understood who
[59:17] his brethren were. He understood
[59:19] everything they were saying, but to them
[59:22] they didn't know who he was.
[59:25] And so he gives them this test by using
[59:28] Benjamin. And if you go and read when
[59:31] you have time, go and read Genesis 44
[59:34] and you will see that now here is Judah
[59:39] bargaining with Joseph and unknowingly
[59:43] he is revealing everything. All the
[59:46] words that he spoke was literally the
[59:49] conversation that had taken place at
[59:52] home with his father Jacob. and he told
[59:56] the whole story of Joseph's past
[1:00:00] experiences.
[1:00:04] And when Joseph saw that,
[1:00:08] that's the thing that broke him. He
[1:00:11] realized that yes, something has now
[1:00:14] taken place. And it was at that moment
[1:00:17] that Joseph broke down and eventually
[1:00:20] revealed himself to his brethren. What
[1:00:22] did he see? brotherly kindness.
[1:00:28] So saints of God,
[1:00:31] if we have offended somebody, if you
[1:00:34] have offended somebody, I urge you in
[1:00:36] the name of the Lord, go put that thing
[1:00:38] right because we know as we've been
[1:00:41] hearing the teachings that the rapture
[1:00:45] is at hand
[1:00:47] and we must make sure that everything in
[1:00:51] our lives is put right.
[1:00:54] If you have offended somebody, done
[1:00:56] something wrong, and you know that
[1:00:59] somebody is hurt because of your
[1:01:00] actions, I urge you in the name of the
[1:01:02] Lord, put that thing right. It's for
[1:01:05] your own good. And so,
[1:01:09] because you see, wounds
[1:01:12] bring memories.
[1:01:15] And you notice this as I close
[1:01:20] in Zechariah when um
[1:01:25] this is now when uh uh Benjamin is um of
[1:01:29] course who's a type of the 144,000 Jews.
[1:01:33] We know that they will be saved in the 3
[1:01:36] and 1/2 years. Okay. And Zechariah 12:10
[1:01:41] and 13 speaks about how there will come
[1:01:44] a moment when they will recognize the
[1:01:48] atonement and they will ask one specific
[1:01:50] question.
[1:01:52] Where did you get those wounds
[1:01:55] and
[1:01:57] Jesus we know it will be Christ will
[1:02:00] tell them in the house of my friends.
[1:02:06] I'm just going to say this because it's
[1:02:08] a principle I want to apply.
[1:02:11] Wounds
[1:02:13] bring back memories.
[1:02:16] And when they saw those wounds,
[1:02:21] they questioned and said, "Where did you
[1:02:22] get those wounds?" And when he revealed
[1:02:25] himself and he told them that in the
[1:02:27] house of my friends, these were actually
[1:02:29] the Jews. The same people crucified him.
[1:02:33] And so there came a recognition that
[1:02:36] yes, WE ARE THE ONES who crucified the
[1:02:40] Messiah. We are guilty
[1:02:42] of causing those wounds, those scars in
[1:02:45] his hands. And the Bible says they all
[1:02:48] went to their homes and wept and whatnot
[1:02:51] because they recognized they recognized
[1:02:55] that they were responsible for those
[1:02:58] scars in his hands,
[1:03:00] the wounds on his side.
[1:03:02] So what am I saying?
[1:03:05] A wounded person
[1:03:08] needs closure
[1:03:11] because wounds
[1:03:14] carry memories.
[1:03:19] And
[1:03:21] to make it easier
[1:03:23] for anyone that we've offended,
[1:03:27] it's actually very simple. It's just two
[1:03:30] simple words.
[1:03:32] I'm sorry.
[1:03:34] That's all.
[1:03:37] I'm sorry.
[1:03:39] You know, by saying I'm sorry, it
[1:03:43] relieves you, the one who was offended,
[1:03:46] and it also frees the one who's been
[1:03:48] offended.
[1:03:50] It gives a chance
[1:03:53] for reconciliation to take place.
[1:03:57] Saying I'm sorry, does not make you less
[1:04:00] of a Christian.
[1:04:02] It actually simply means that you are
[1:04:04] interested in the well-being
[1:04:07] of another person.
[1:04:13] As Jesus said in Luke 17, as I close, he
[1:04:15] said, "Then he said unto his disciples
[1:04:18] that it is impossible,
[1:04:22] but that offenses will come,
[1:04:27] but woe unto him through whom they
[1:04:31] come."
[1:04:33] God help me that I am not the one who is
[1:04:37] guilty
[1:04:39] of causing an offense to a child or a
[1:04:43] daughter, a son or a daughter of God.
[1:04:48] I make it also your desire that you will
[1:04:52] not be one who's responsible for being a
[1:04:55] stumbling block to somebody else.
[1:04:59] Because as we know
[1:05:08] people,
[1:05:12] a lot of people are hurting even in this
[1:05:14] message by bad experiences,
[1:05:19] the way they've been treated. On Sunday,
[1:05:21] our pastor spoke about those things, the
[1:05:24] way they've been handled. And you know
[1:05:26] it's so quick to judge people and say
[1:05:28] well like for example those who left the
[1:05:30] message. It's so easy to judge a lot of
[1:05:32] those people and say well they they left
[1:05:34] us because they are not among us. But if
[1:05:37] you listen to some of the stories of
[1:05:39] things they went through the way they
[1:05:42] were handled in the message. You almost
[1:05:45] can't blame them for turning against the
[1:05:48] message.
[1:05:50] So we are responsible how we handle one
[1:05:52] another.
[1:05:54] So saying sorry
[1:05:59] it's it's not going to make you anything
[1:06:01] less
[1:06:02] but if anything is going to make you
[1:06:04] more of a Christian and this story
[1:06:06] touched me as I close just to show you
[1:06:10] that
[1:06:12] humility can really go a long ways.
[1:06:16] Brother Brham was
[1:06:19] confronted with the killer bull
[1:06:21] and he tells this story in a way that
[1:06:24] when I read
[1:06:27] this story I realized that
[1:06:31] I have a long ways to go and I believe
[1:06:34] every one of us still has a long ways to
[1:06:36] go.
[1:06:38] The prophet was crossing a field to go
[1:06:41] and pray for his brother and he
[1:06:43] encounters this killer bull and this is
[1:06:46] what he says. He says, "Poor creature,
[1:06:51] I am on your territory. This is an
[1:06:55] animal.
[1:06:57] You are an animal. You don't know any
[1:07:00] different.
[1:07:02] That's the only thing you know is to
[1:07:04] protect your rights.
[1:07:08] And I said to this bull in these words,
[1:07:11] "Oh creature of God, I am a servant of
[1:07:16] God
[1:07:19] and I am on my way to pray
[1:07:23] for my sick brother." Now listen to
[1:07:26] this. I'm sorry I disturbed you,
[1:07:31] but in Jesus name, go lay down.
[1:07:38] How many of us would have thought of
[1:07:39] speaking the word
[1:07:42] and speaking it out of existence?
[1:07:45] This is just one example. You remember
[1:07:47] the story too of the killer, I mean of
[1:07:49] the u the hornets.
[1:07:52] Same thing.
[1:07:54] The prophet approaches, these are
[1:07:57] creatures don't that don't have a soul,
[1:08:00] no mental capacity to think.
[1:08:04] And yet
[1:08:06] this is how he approached animals. I'm
[1:08:09] sorry for disturbing him.
[1:08:17] In closing, the prophet says this.
[1:08:20] Now he's talking now to humans. This is
[1:08:22] human to human. We've just left the
[1:08:24] animals. He says, "I want you to shake
[1:08:27] hands." Musicians, you can come. Brother
[1:08:29] Anthony, he says, "I want to shake hands
[1:08:32] with somebody standing by you.
[1:08:36] If there's anybody
[1:08:40] that you've done harm to,
[1:08:44] make your way to them and shake their
[1:08:46] hand and say, "God bless you."
[1:08:51] That's right. Say, "Forgive me, brother.
[1:08:55] If I've harmed you,
[1:08:58] I love you. I appreciate you. You're my
[1:09:03] brother. I need you. I must have you. We
[1:09:08] are brothers together.
[1:09:10] We want to see God move."
[1:09:14] Praise God.
[1:09:17] This is my message to you tonight.
[1:09:20] Thank you.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; And it's my my desire and my prayer that
[1:09:25] these things will become a manifestation
[1:09:27] in my life and in your life
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; because by this shall men know that you
[1:09:35] are my disciples.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Brother Anthony, if you
[1:09:39] could sing this song, fill my way every
[1:09:41] day with love as we stand up.
[1:09:46] Praise God.
[1:09:48] Fill my way [singing]
[1:09:50] every day with [music] love.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, with love. As I walk with a lead.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, let me go [music]
[1:10:03] all the while with a song and smile.
[1:10:08] Fill my [music] way every day with love.
[1:10:13] Let me [music] walk and let me walk.
[1:10:16] Blessed Lord [singing]
[1:10:18] in the way thou has gone leading
[1:10:22] straight to the land above.
[1:10:27] Oh giving share everywhere [music]
[1:10:31] to
[1:10:33] the Lord. Fill my way every day with
[1:10:38] [music] love.
[1:10:40] So fill my way every day [music] with
[1:10:45] love.
[1:10:47] As I walk with the heavenly
[1:10:51] God,
[1:10:53] [music]
[1:10:54] let me go on the wild with a song and a
[1:11:00] smile. Fill my way every day [music]
[1:11:04] with love.
[1:11:07] We shall just pray and then we'll
[1:11:09] continue with the song. Heavenly Father,
[1:11:12] we thank you, Lord, for the simple
[1:11:15] thoughts that you've given to us
[1:11:16] tonight. Lord, I thank you for your
[1:11:19] people. May the sacrifice to be here
[1:11:22] tonight. Bless your children, Lord, I
[1:11:25] pray. Put love in our hearts for each
[1:11:27] other, Lord. And just unite us in love.
[1:11:31] Let it be, oh God. If there's anything
[1:11:33] in our lives, in our [music] hearts,
[1:11:34] Lord, any odds we we hold towards each
[1:11:38] other, forgive us and help us, Lord, to
[1:11:41] lay those things [music] aside, oh God,
[1:11:44] the weight of sin that so easily besets
[1:11:46] us, Lord. And I pray, God, that your
[1:11:49] blessings will rest upon them as we go.
[1:11:52] Keep them safely on the roads. Oh God,
[1:11:54] bless our pastor. Bless the ministers in
[1:11:56] this house, your children, everyone. Oh
[1:11:59] God, let your grace and blessings rest
[1:12:01] upon them. In Jesus Christ's name we
[1:12:03] pray. Amen. Amen.
[1:12:09] Oh, let me go all the
[1:12:12] [music and singing] while with a song
[1:12:15] and a smile. Fill my [music and singing]
[1:12:17] way every day with love.
[1:12:22] Oh, fill [music] my way every day with
[1:12:27] love.
[1:12:30] As I walk [music]
[1:12:32] where I heaven,
[1:12:36] let me go on the wild
[1:12:40] song and smile. Fill my way [music]
[1:12:45] every day with love.
[1:12:49] So [music] think about his love.
[1:12:53] Think about his goodness.
[1:12:57] Think about his way
[1:13:01] has brought us through
[1:13:03] [music]
[1:13:05] for as high as the heaven above.
[1:13:09] Great is the [music] measure of my
[1:13:12] finest love.
[1:13:16] Great is [music] the measure of finest
[1:13:20] love. One more time. Oh, think about his
[1:13:24] love. [music]
[1:13:27] Think about his goodness.
[1:13:30] Think about [music] his grace
[1:13:34] that brought us through.
[1:13:38] For as [music] high as the heavens
[1:13:40] above,
[1:13:42] great is the measure of father's [music]
[1:13:46] love.
[1:13:50] Great is the measure of my finest love.
[1:13:55] Hallelujah.
[1:13:56] How many had a wonderful time in his
[1:13:58] presence tonight? Amen. You are
[1:14:00] dismissed.
[1:14:06] I want to live
[1:14:09] the way
[1:14:12] he wants me
[1:14:15] to live.
[1:14:17] I want to give
[1:14:20] until there's just [music] no more.
[1:14:27] I want to love
[1:14:31] love till there's just [music] no more
[1:14:35] love.
[1:14:37] I can never
[1:14:39] ever love the [music] Lord.
[1:14:46] Oh, I want to live
[1:14:50] away. [music]
[1:14:52] He wants me to go. I want to [music]
[1:14:57] give
[1:15:00] until there
[1:15:02] no [music] more.
[1:15:06] I want to love
[1:15:10] love until there's [music] just no
[1:15:16] I can never
[1:15:19] [music]
