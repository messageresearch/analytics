[40:48] Desmond amen it's good to be here this
[40:51] morning amen hallelujah let us turn to
[40:54] the word this morning I was think
[40:56] thinking we're entering into the
[40:57] Christmas season Hallelujah and I've
[41:00] been given a Sunday in this season here
[41:02] and I was thinking I want to continue on
[41:05] my uh series that I feel on my heart uh
[41:08] manifestation and the last time we
[41:10] preached on uh manifesting the life
[41:14] abundantly so I was thinking to myself
[41:16] you know what I I I'm just moving in
[41:18] this direction I don't have nothing I
[41:20] said Lord it'd be nice to have something
[41:22] that would uh you know relate to
[41:24] Christmas a little bit so I just Let It
[41:26] Go and I was just uh studying and and
[41:29] doing my thing there and then you know
[41:31] what he gave me the title Hallelujah he
[41:34] gave me the title it just came to me
[41:36] because I had no title so my title this
[41:39] morning is Oh Come
[41:42] Emmanuel and manifest your word
[41:45] hallelujah oh come Emmanuel not only god
[41:49] with us but God in us Jesus said I'll be
[41:52] with you and in you and you'll know in
[41:55] that day
[41:57] you will know that's the greatest
[41:58] Revelation that the bride is catching in
[42:01] this hour is that you will know in this
[42:04] day amen Isaiah
[42:07] 558 glory to
[42:09] God familiar scriptures you know big
[42:13] part of preaching is preaching 80% of
[42:15] already what's been spoken you know why
[42:18] because we don't get it the first time
[42:20] sometimes the second or third time and
[42:22] God has to keep repeating it over and
[42:24] over again just like when brother Bram
[42:27] said you know when they asked him
[42:28] brother Bram you got anything else to
[42:29] preach besides
[42:31] repentance you know one time two time
[42:33] three times say oh yeah I got a lot to
[42:35] preach but repent first and then we'll
[42:38] move on so that's the way God is God
[42:41] wants to drive it home he wants to make
[42:44] this word a substance and make it real
[42:47] in our lives and sometimes he has to
[42:49] drive it home over and over and over
[42:52] until the light bulb turns on as we say
[42:55] Amen Hallelujah the Lord is speaking
[42:58] here Isaiah 558
[43:02] to12
[43:04] Hallelujah he's speaking for my thoughts
[43:07] are not your
[43:09] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[43:13] sayeth the
[43:14] Lord for as the heavens are higher than
[43:17] the earth so are my ways higher than
[43:20] your ways and my thoughts than your
[43:25] thoughts so God is making it very clear
[43:28] here there's a difference between our
[43:32] thoughts our ways and his thoughts and
[43:34] his
[43:35] ways it's very important to understand
[43:38] this
[43:39] amen for as the rain cometh down and the
[43:42] snow from heaven and return it not
[43:45] hither but WTH the Earth and make it
[43:49] bring forth and Bud that it may give
[43:52] seed to the soar and bread to the eater
[43:57] now he's saying here so shall my word be
[44:02] that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[44:06] shall not return unto me void but it
[44:11] shall accomplish that which I please and
[44:14] it shall prosper in the thing whet I
[44:18] sent
[44:22] it if we can see in
[44:24] nature what he said there and we can see
[44:29] that it manifests in nature God is
[44:33] saying so shall my word
[44:36] be and that's what we want to see this
[44:39] morning that what word has been spoken
[44:43] in this hour what word has gone forth to
[44:46] us in this hour what did God
[44:51] say for ye shall go out with
[44:54] joy not sadness not sorrow but joy and
[45:00] be led forth with peace the mountains
[45:04] and the hills shall Break Forth oh yes
[45:07] when Revelation is striking and the Sons
[45:10] and Daughters of God are getting
[45:11] anointed by the Holy Spirit and moving
[45:14] in the power and the demonstration of
[45:16] the
[45:16] word hallelujah Break Forth before you
[45:20] into singing and all the trees of the
[45:23] field shall clap their hands glory to
[45:26] God let us pray father we thank you Lord
[45:28] for your love grace and mercy this
[45:30] morning Father we pray oh God that Lord
[45:35] you have spoken it you have sent forth
[45:38] your word in this hour and in this day
[45:41] father through a prophet of Malachi 4:5
[45:45] the word has been spoken Lord and I
[45:48] believe the word has been received
[45:50] father Lord Jesus the word was made
[45:53] flesh then but I believe is becoming
[45:55] flesh again father and Lord that's why
[45:58] we're gathered here this morning Lord to
[46:01] hear from you it's not by might it's not
[46:04] by power but by your spirit sayeth the
[46:07] Lord father speak this morning Lord
[46:10] speak the word of God into the people's
[46:13] hearts oh God may they recognize it's
[46:15] not a man but may they recognize the
[46:18] voice of God coming in these last days
[46:22] through the Bride of Jesus Christ once
[46:24] again father Grant these things I pray
[46:27] in Jesus name amen you may be
[46:30] seated glory to God and that's what it
[46:32] is hallelujah the voice of God through
[46:35] the Bride of Jesus Christ in these last
[46:37] days and we're going to see by the end
[46:39] of the service that the Prophet The Very
[46:43] message of the hour that we're claiming
[46:45] to believe has spoken these things to be
[46:47] so that the voice is in the bride
[46:50] Hallelujah nowhere's else but in the
[46:53] Bride of Jesus Christ glory to God that
[46:55] is the word for the hour Isaiah
[46:59] 7:14 God is speaking here and God has
[47:03] always done the same thing down Through
[47:04] the Ages he's saying behold the Virgin
[47:07] shall conceive through the prophet
[47:10] Isaiah and we can see that it took 800
[47:13] years before that prophecy that was
[47:17] spoken there was an 800 year frame of
[47:20] time what we call time but God doesn't
[47:23] deal with time Hallelujah we deal with
[47:26] time and then a virgin conceived and BR
[47:31] forth what God has spoken that is the
[47:34] very evidence God is showing us in the
[47:37] word amen what he did then he's going to
[47:40] do today and that is what we should be
[47:44] looking for in this hour we have the
[47:48] ability the prophet said the bride has
[47:50] the ability to see this word made flesh
[47:54] and manif
[47:56] before her very
[47:58] eyes God has gifted her amen by the
[48:02] attribute inside of her to see that word
[48:04] made flesh in this hour that's what
[48:07] we're looking for we're not looking to
[48:09] go to church or join a church or be
[48:11] religious but we're looking for that
[48:14] word to come in flesh again in this
[48:17] hour as
[48:20] individuals
[48:22] Hallelujah John 1:1 says in the
[48:25] beginning was the word the word was with
[48:28] God and the Word was God Amen and the
[48:32] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[48:36] that has always been God's process of
[48:39] bringing his word evolution in his word
[48:42] down into flesh it's no different in
[48:45] this
[48:47] day no
[48:49] different his main objective his main
[48:52] purpose in this hour is to bring that
[48:56] word in flesh
[48:58] again Hallelujah he don't care now what
[49:03] I'm saying get me what I'm saying he
[49:05] don't care about your good works he
[49:08] don't care about all all your good
[49:10] behaviors and all the fruits of the
[49:12] spirit they're all good they're all
[49:14] respected as a good person but God is
[49:18] determined because what God has spoken
[49:21] is not those things God has spoken that
[49:24] my word won't return void but it will
[49:27] accomplish and my word will become flesh
[49:31] in a people in these last days that's
[49:34] what's been spoken through a
[49:36] prophet a bride must come
[49:39] forth
[49:41] Hallelujah manifesting is
[49:44] not is not about attracting what you
[49:48] want manifesting is an awareness and an
[49:52] understanding that you attract Who You
[49:55] Are
[49:56] are the meaning of mystery something
[50:00] that is difficult or impossible to
[50:02] understand or
[50:04] explain oh you talk about mystery the
[50:08] Mysteries unfolding the Mysteries being
[50:11] revealed in these last days hallelujah
[50:15] and they are they are but they are still
[50:18] hidden they're being
[50:20] revealed they've been
[50:22] unfolded Hallelujah but there still
[50:26] hidden because the control has always
[50:30] been in the father's hands Jesus said
[50:33] flesh and blood has not revealed it to
[50:34] you but my father has revealed it to you
[50:38] Hallelujah so it's always revealed in
[50:41] the control of the father's hands even
[50:44] what has been done and what has been
[50:46] spoken in this hour through a prophet
[50:49] it's still in the father's hands it's
[50:51] still in his control to reveal it to
[50:54] whoever he Wills to his own his own
[50:58] children he knows his
[51:00] own my sheep know my voice and a
[51:04] stranger they will not follow my sheep
[51:07] know me and I know them glory to God
[51:13] hallelujah very important to understand
[51:15] my brothers and sisters hallelujah
[51:18] hallelujah that's where we get all the
[51:20] conception all the mixup all the false
[51:23] things that are moving around interpret
[51:25] patience of the word but God is his own
[51:28] interpreter he will make it plain do we
[51:32] understand when he said that I am my own
[51:34] interpreter I will make it plain I don't
[51:36] need nobody else to interpret this
[51:43] word brother Brand's speaking
[51:46] here you don't mind if I do some
[51:52] quoting because I'm going to be doing
[51:54] some because because a little bit more
[51:56] than normal because I want to
[51:58] prove by the
[52:01] message where the bride is and who she
[52:04] is and who the prophet said she is
[52:09] hallelujah brother Brandon speaking here
[52:11] in Shalom
[52:13] 1964 and so it is today that gross
[52:17] darkness is coming upon the
[52:19] people and here we
[52:23] are God has allotted his word to be
[52:26] manifested this
[52:28] day and it is the only light we
[52:31] have and God is going to let
[52:35] somebody manifest that
[52:38] word you hear
[52:40] that God is going to let
[52:43] somebody manifest that
[52:46] word somebody's going to do it he
[52:50] promised it and he works just exactly
[52:55] like he always
[52:57] did he has never changed his pattern of
[53:00] work he
[53:02] prophesies what will happen then he
[53:05] sends somebody down to vindicate that
[53:08] which we have it
[53:09] already amen he's already spoken it he's
[53:13] already sent the prophet to vindicate it
[53:16] now what is the next
[53:20] step that's where people stop they stop
[53:24] right there with the prophet
[53:27] the word has not stopped with the
[53:29] prophet my brothers and
[53:31] sisters as people that don't recognize
[53:34] and see by faith what was spoken by the
[53:41] prophet and it goes over the heads of
[53:47] millions because Darkness covers the
[53:49] earth at that
[53:51] time this
[53:53] time I'm not talking about back there
[53:56] amen everything I talk everything I
[53:59] speak the quotes that I bring and all
[54:02] these men of God we bring it for
[54:04] now this is present day truth amen this
[54:09] is what God is doing now when I always
[54:13] got together at the beginning with
[54:14] brother Dany and we got into Fellowship
[54:17] that's the first thing that he would say
[54:20] before we start fellowshipping brother
[54:22] Tim where is God now
[54:25] what is he doing
[54:28] now and that's what we want we want God
[54:31] now
[54:32] today these things have to be for us
[54:36] today I thank God for what he did back
[54:39] there Hallelujah he knows that I Rejoice
[54:44] I'm blessed over that but that ain't
[54:46] going to do nothing for me if I don't
[54:48] see what God is doing in my life now
[54:51] today I want to see the manifestation of
[54:54] the holy ghost in my life without it
[54:57] don't mean
[55:01] nothing I don't want to be
[55:04] religious I don't want to just join a
[55:07] church and go to a church and do good
[55:08] works no way I rather hey Paul said if
[55:12] this ain't the truth we might as well be
[55:16] out there partying being married and
[55:18] giving him doing all these things and
[55:20] that's what I'm telling you right now if
[55:23] this God this world is not real in my
[55:26] life then I don't want to play religion
[55:30] either it's God or nothing bottom line
[55:34] either I need to see the Living God or
[55:37] it's nothing and that takes that takes
[55:40] desperation in my life that takes me
[55:43] seeking like he said seek and you shall
[55:46] find knock and it shall be open to
[55:49] you that's not lightly that's with my
[55:53] whole heart mind body and
[55:57] soul you have to give
[56:01] this over the heads of millions because
[56:03] Darkness covers the earth at that time
[56:05] and people love
[56:11] Darkness not in here right not in any
[56:14] message churches
[56:17] right okay I got something better for
[56:20] you here people love Darkness better
[56:25] than they do the
[56:26] light cuz
[56:28] Darkness has a lot you listening oh
[56:33] Darkness has a lot of pleasure oh yeah
[56:37] in
[56:38] it well that changes a little bit eh
[56:42] pleasure I thought Darkness was evil I
[56:44] thought Darkness was you know
[56:46] blaspheming Darkness was this Darkness
[56:49] was that no Darkness has a lot of
[56:53] pleasure in it
[56:55] oh Satan likes to use the pleasures of
[56:58] this life to take you away from the word
[57:01] of God to take you away listen seek the
[57:05] kingdom first like we talked about the
[57:07] last service seek the kingdom of God
[57:09] first give your heart to the kingdom
[57:12] first and then God will freely add
[57:14] everything that you have need of all the
[57:17] blessings he wants to give you it'll
[57:19] just fall into place
[57:22] freely we don't seek after pleasure
[57:25] we don't seek after riches the things of
[57:28] this
[57:29] world we seek after God Amen
[57:34] Hallelujah and that's exactly what's
[57:36] coming to pass now is just before day
[57:40] the morning star has come out to hail
[57:42] the day coming and the Holy Spirit is
[57:45] showing its light it's coming a time
[57:49] when the light and darkness will have to
[57:52] be separated oh it's separating right
[57:54] now now my brothers and sisters this two
[57:56] seeds are coming to their full maturity
[57:59] now listen what he says here one from
[58:02] the
[58:02] other now listen the church and its
[58:08] order will take the order of the
[58:14] day and
[58:16] Christ and his light word promise will
[58:19] go into a
[58:21] Rapture so automatically your property
[58:24] thinking the church will take the new
[58:27] world order out there they're taking the
[58:29] the the order out there and then the
[58:31] bride will take the light of the word
[58:33] and it is true and go into Rapture but
[58:36] let me tell you the
[58:39] message the mess
[58:42] age god brother Bram said God is calling
[58:46] the bride out of the church he didn't
[58:50] difference that he didn't come at that
[58:52] time and say well there's going to be a
[58:55] message group and message churches that
[58:58] are going to be here on the earth he
[59:01] didn't difference that he didn't say
[59:04] anything about that he actually says
[59:06] listen be born again serve God in
[59:09] whatever church that is available to you
[59:12] at the time we have created messes
[59:16] churches where we gather together and we
[59:19] can see the mess in the message oh we
[59:22] can see it my brothers and sisters why
[59:24] is there so many different doctrines
[59:27] different teachings out
[59:29] there why we got the same
[59:33] message we believe the same
[59:36] thing why is there because that's what
[59:40] he was talking about the church the
[59:43] message will take the order of the
[59:45] Church of the message culture but the
[59:49] bride will take the light in this hour
[59:51] and she will be called out of that
[59:53] message
[1:00:04] that's the only thing that's left for
[1:00:06] them to do it's the dawning of a new day
[1:00:09] for many who are looking for his coming
[1:00:12] so many good sincere people today that's
[1:00:15] what burns their hearts so many good
[1:00:18] sincere people like Mary and
[1:00:21] Joseph Hallelujah brother Brown is
[1:00:24] speaking
[1:00:27] here we're nailing points home this
[1:00:31] morning we're going to nail it
[1:00:34] down be patient with
[1:00:36] me he speaking here and recognizing your
[1:00:39] day in his
[1:00:41] message they want a Great
[1:00:45] Awakening they're crying and believing
[1:00:47] that there will be a an
[1:00:50] Awakening they're good
[1:00:53] people I'm not saying people are
[1:00:57] bad why is
[1:01:01] it what have they
[1:01:03] done what have message people done
[1:01:07] they're
[1:01:08] sincere they believe they're
[1:01:11] right they believe what they're
[1:01:13] following is the truth all these
[1:01:15] different movements out there all these
[1:01:17] false doctrines they believe it what
[1:01:21] have they done they're good they're
[1:01:24] sincere dear
[1:01:28] people listen what he
[1:01:30] says they have not recognize the
[1:01:34] Awakening of the
[1:01:37] Bride remember what is
[1:01:41] sin
[1:01:45] unbelief see by being a
[1:01:49] Christian they feel the pull of the
[1:01:53] hour but they haven't recognized what's
[1:01:57] been
[1:01:59] done that's what's making them feel that

[1:12:14] testimony when I was delivered from
[1:12:16] certain pills that I was on for a year
[1:12:18] and a half two years I didn't have the
[1:12:22] faith to get rid of them I tried to stop
[1:12:24] them twice I couldn't get rid of them

[1:12:28] deliver me from

[1:12:43] so I keep seeking the Lord and every
[1:12:45] time with more
[1:12:48] desperation and one night I was
[1:12:49] listening to this message greatest
[1:12:51] battle ever fought because that message
[1:12:53] was sent to the
[1:12:54] church and the Lord spoke to me and said
[1:12:57] it's
[1:12:58] finished it's
[1:13:01] over and when that perfect Faith came to
[1:13:04] me it was
[1:13:07] done I went through hell withdraws and
[1:13:10] everything in my body chemical
[1:13:12] imbalances everything I went through
[1:13:14] hell I thought I was going to
[1:13:17] die but God gave me a word he said
[1:13:21] listen what came in my heart if if I die
[1:13:24] I'll die believing God's word amen
[1:13:29] that's the thing when we die to believe
[1:13:33] the word of God that's being spoke to us
[1:13:35] will we allow our faith to get to that
[1:13:38] place that real in our lives I said I'll
[1:13:43] die but I will not because Satan came
[1:13:47] with fear with unbelief oh just go back
[1:13:51] go do this we can't go back back when
[1:13:54] God has spoken for us to go
[1:13:56] forward we
[1:13:59] can't God has no pleasure in the soul
[1:14:02] that draws
[1:14:04] back we got to keep going forward when
[1:14:07] he speaks no matter what it
[1:14:10] does I live I live to the Lord if I die
[1:14:13] I die in the Lord
[1:14:17] amen when you get to that place to
[1:14:19] surrender to
[1:14:20] God oh my then God is going to do
[1:14:24] something great in your life oh
[1:14:27] yeah oh
[1:14:29] yeah
[1:14:31] amen glory to
[1:14:37] God God promised the
[1:14:39] Abraham that he was going to have a
[1:14:43] son when it was impossible for Sarah to
[1:14:46] conceive God revealed to Abraham by
[1:14:50] faith then God had the to change Sarah
[1:14:55] and Abraham back to young man and woman
[1:14:58] to fulfill that
[1:15:00] promise the same promise is given to the
[1:15:03] bride
[1:15:04] today we are Abraham's
[1:15:08] seed in this hour Abraham's Faith
[1:15:14] seed look what Abraham had to go
[1:15:18] through look what he had his journey his
[1:15:21] life look how his Faith was tested along
[1:15:24] the
[1:15:26] way same way with us my brothers and
[1:15:29] sisters but you see even though Abraham
[1:15:35] took
[1:15:38] Hagar even though he listened to his
[1:15:42] wife God still wrote In the book of
[1:15:45] Hebrews that Abraham staggered not at
[1:15:49] the promises of God through
[1:15:52] unbelief
[1:15:53] so we can see the mistakes of
[1:15:56] Abraham in the flesh because remember
[1:16:00] there was a space of time of 25
[1:16:02] years
[1:16:04] right that that that went by and listen
[1:16:09] my brothers and sisters we're all human
[1:16:13] and we're all Sons and Daughters of God
[1:16:16] but we're all human in this flesh in
[1:16:18] this Dimension and sometimes when God
[1:16:20] promises something or we're waiting for
[1:16:22] something the Manifest there's a period
[1:16:24] of time and in that time there's
[1:16:28] testing oh testing
[1:16:31] patience God brings us through the
[1:16:33] ringer sometimes to see if we believe
[1:16:36] his word he loves to test his children
[1:16:39] to believe see if they believe his word
[1:16:42] it's not a matter uh when time goes by
[1:16:45] it's not a matter if God is able to
[1:16:48] fulfill his word or he's willing to
[1:16:50] fulfill his word it's not a matter about
[1:16:53] that he has proven over and over that
[1:16:57] he's fulfilled his word and my brothers
[1:17:00] and sisters we are standing here today
[1:17:04] 2023 and God has
[1:17:07] proven his
[1:17:09] word God has made his Word Flesh
[1:17:16] again not only in a
[1:17:18] prophet
[1:17:20] Hallelujah I'm not looking just for the
[1:17:22] future
[1:17:23] future I'm not looking to the past let
[1:17:26] the profit and the future God's going to
[1:17:28] do it but I'm looking present now I
[1:17:31] believe with all my heart that this word
[1:17:35] has become flesh again and a People amen
[1:17:39] a predestinated people in this hour amen

[1:18:19] Bride Abraham a type of the prophet
[1:18:23] and God visited Sarah and the third poll
[1:18:28] came to Sarah which is the revealing of
[1:18:30] the word and that's where she got the
[1:18:33] faith to conceive the child to go back
[1:18:36] in her body became a new body to receive
[1:18:40] the
[1:18:44] child can
[1:18:48] God not fulfill his
[1:18:51] word
[1:19:00] Hallelujah I don't know what I'm

[1:19:38] preach most of you even know me
[1:19:40] Hallelujah I'm passionate what I preach
[1:19:42] and what I what I believe that's the way
[1:19:44] I am
[1:19:46] Hallelujah When Faith is revealed
[1:19:49] Hallelujah there's always a space of
[1:19:51] time look at Enoch the third pull in
[1:19:55] Enoch's walk Enoch walked with God by
[1:19:58] walking with the
[1:20:00] word now listen he walked with the word
[1:20:03] what are we doing we're walking with the
[1:20:06] word there's a transition there's a a
[1:20:09] transformation there's a change taking
[1:20:12] place here while you're walking with the
[1:20:14] word it's not that the word of God is
[1:20:18] taken un effect it's taken effect my
[1:20:21] brothers and sisters and that's what God
[1:20:23] is saying here Enoch walked with the
[1:20:26] word and by walking with the word he was
[1:20:29] walking with God and God was walking
[1:20:32] inside of
[1:20:33] him and the change took
[1:20:36] place Hallelujah God said to Enoch Enoch
[1:20:41] I've revealed so much to you you don't
[1:20:44] need to know any more in this flesh in
[1:20:47] this Dimension come home and be with me

[1:21:02] home like I said my brothers and sisters
[1:21:04] at the beginning are we playing Church
[1:21:07] Message Church being
[1:21:10] religious or are
[1:21:13] we walking like
[1:21:16] this do we believe that when we hear the
[1:21:20] word of God speaking into our our hearts
[1:21:23] that is actually the transformation
[1:21:26] taking place the change taking place
[1:21:29] within
[1:21:31] us I know nobody's going to say no
[1:21:34] everybody's GNA say Amen but this is
[1:21:37] real this is real amen if you really
[1:21:41] believe
[1:21:42] it
[1:21:44] hallelujah
[1:21:46] amen see Enoch was feeding on that word
[1:21:50] that is the mystery and miracle
[1:21:53] that that is unexplainable of the third
[1:21:56] poll what is it my brothers and sisters
[1:21:59] it's the creation of
[1:22:02] God it's not just preaching words to
[1:22:06] tickle your
[1:22:07] ears it's the creation of God that's
[1:22:11] going
[1:22:12] forth It's not brother Tim or any other
[1:22:16] minister it's the voice behind the voice
[1:22:19] it's the spirit that is being released
[1:22:22] behind the word of God Jesus said my my
[1:22:25] words are spirit and they are life it's
[1:22:29] the creation of God that's going
[1:22:32] forth every time the word is being spoke
[1:22:36] God is creating in
[1:22:38] me that's why we say created me a new
[1:22:41] heart created me renew my mind renew my
[1:22:46] heart this morning renew me Lord created
[1:22:51] me oh
[1:22:55] Lord is the creation of God himself
[1:22:58] listen creating in us the change that we
[1:23:01] need to live for
[1:23:03] eternity Jesus said be perfect as your
[1:23:06] heavenly father is perfect walking in
[1:23:08] perfect harmony with the spirit of
[1:23:11] Revelation upon us is the
[1:23:14] Perfection because he is the
[1:23:18] Perfection
[1:23:21] Hallelujah
[1:23:24] now Jesus say speaking
[1:23:30] here there's always the same process can
[1:23:33] can you
[1:23:35] change the law of sewing and
[1:23:38] reaping can you can you change the fact
[1:23:41] I know they're trying to do it out there
[1:23:43] but can you change the fact that you
[1:23:45] take a
[1:23:46] seed you have to put it into the ground
[1:23:49] moist ground good
[1:23:51] ground toil the ground put it into the
[1:23:56] ground let the sun shine upon it let
[1:23:58] water it and then let it come forth so
[1:24:01] every seed can you can't change that
[1:24:04] process and God has a process where his
[1:24:09] word enters into us and becomes one with
[1:24:14] us and flesh with
[1:24:16] us and that entry
[1:24:20] point I don't think maybe I'm wrong and
[1:24:23] I hope I'm
[1:24:25] wrong maybe I'm just making an
[1:24:27] assumption or assuming here but I don't
[1:24:30] think it's as important to
[1:24:33] us that entry point and as critical to
[1:24:37] us in our
[1:24:39] lives I don't know why but God keeps
[1:24:42] bringing me back to
[1:24:44] this this entry point of the
[1:24:48] Mind in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:24:51] that was through directly spoken by the
[1:24:54] prophet that God gave me this to send to
[1:24:57] the
[1:25:00] church now let us
[1:25:05] hear when Jesus said the Gates of Hell
[1:25:08] will not
[1:25:10] Prevail we all hear
[1:25:12] that what are the gates of hell my
[1:25:15] brothers and
[1:25:17] sisters you see the gates are always now
[1:25:21] listen
[1:25:23] are always on the
[1:25:26] outside of the
[1:25:30] property what does it do it keeps things
[1:25:33] from going out and it keeps things from
[1:25:37] coming
[1:25:38] in that's the gates of hell that Jesus
[1:25:41] was saying that will not Prevail against
[1:25:44] the
[1:25:47] Revelation the gates are our
[1:25:50] minds that's where the Great greatest b
[1:25:52] battle ever fought
[1:25:55] is Jesus said You shall know the truth
[1:26:00] and the truth shall set you
[1:26:03] free you see you will know the truth and
[1:26:08] this last day you will know the truth
[1:26:11] all truth and it will set you
[1:26:17] free faith is the key and
[1:26:21] Truth and is what opens the gates of our
[1:26:24] minds to believe the truth that sets us
[1:26:28] free it opens up the door and sets us
[1:26:31] free from all lies doubts
[1:26:34] fears all the bondage of Satan of
[1:26:39] poverty that Satan has made us to
[1:26:41] believe in our
[1:26:44] lives God doesn't you
[1:26:48] know the lies that we have taken and
[1:26:51] brought over
[1:26:53] you know
[1:26:55] Moses he went into Egypt he met the
[1:26:58] pillar of fire but it wasn't over there
[1:27:01] yet it took 40 years to get Egypt out of
[1:27:06] Moses so God can use
[1:27:09] Moses oh my brothers and
[1:27:13] sisters it's been more than 40 years
[1:27:15] since the prophet has
[1:27:19] gone but I believe we're coming to the
[1:27:22] end
[1:27:25] here whoever takes his word and believes
[1:27:28] it God will bring it to pass that's what
[1:27:31] breaks the Gates of Hell in your life
[1:27:36] Faith in the truth that sets you
[1:27:39] free we can be
[1:27:42] blessed Satan doesn't have any power to
[1:27:46] stop your blessings of manifestation he
[1:27:49] cannot stop this word
[1:27:53] to you but he has the power to mentally
[1:27:57] block you from believing in your
[1:28:00] blessing and robbing you and bringing
[1:28:03] you in doubt and
[1:28:06] fear and that's what we have to fight
[1:28:10] that's what we're battling today because
[1:28:13] we know that the word will fulfill the
[1:28:17] word will accomplish God has the victory
[1:28:20] in the end God is the
[1:28:24] war those who I've Justified I've
[1:28:28] Sanctified those who I Sanctified I've
[1:28:31] already
[1:28:32] glorified he already got the victory in
[1:28:35] his bride in the word bride at this hour
[1:28:40] but he needs her to take the word it's
[1:28:43] when you say to this mountain when you
[1:28:46] say to this gate when you say to these
[1:28:49] things in your life it's you doing it
[1:28:52] he wants you to take the word he already
[1:28:55] proved it he already proved on Calvary
[1:28:59] The Garden of Gethsemane he already
[1:29:01] defeated the devil for us now he wants
[1:29:04] you to take the word of God and defeat
[1:29:07] the
[1:29:09] Devil oh

[1:30:55] us what they're thinking about us that's
[1:30:59] why insecurity anxiety all these things

[1:31:07] another listen I want to be like that
[1:31:11] person that was playing the
[1:31:13] violin when he was playing the violin
[1:31:15] and he ended his tune there whether the
[1:31:19] people stood up and clapped or not
[1:31:22] they stood up and gave him stand in
[1:31:23] Ovation but he didn't care about that he
[1:31:26] looked to the balcony where the master
[1:31:30] was
[1:31:31] sitting and he was waiting for the
[1:31:33] Master's
[1:31:34] approval I tell you if we live our lives
[1:31:38] looking for the Master's approval in our
[1:31:40] lives we live a lot different life a lot
[1:31:44] Freer
[1:31:46] life a lot Freer of condemnation and
[1:31:50] guilt don't you realize that's the devil
[1:31:54] moving through flesh and
[1:31:56] carnality comparing one with
[1:32:04] another

[1:33:03] under the
[1:33:04] authority his
[1:33:06] authority you will be in
[1:33:09] authority authority is always an
[1:33:12] alignment issue aligning ourselves with
[1:33:16] God's word and God's will not man's will
[1:33:21] or man's word or man's opinions or man's
[1:33:24] interpretations but God's word and God's
[1:33:28] will for our

[1:33:53] you understand the power of your
[1:33:55] presence you just won't go
[1:33:59] anywhere what am I saying here once you
[1:34:01] understand what does that mean once you
[1:34:03] understand once you realize that the god
[1:34:07] that you serve is inside of
[1:34:10] you he's in Authority he's in control
[1:34:14] he's possessing the
[1:34:16] house he has full pramis in your
[1:34:19] life Hallelujah you won't take Jesus
[1:34:24] where you know he doesn't want to
[1:34:26] go where in your mind you won't take the
[1:34:30] word Jesus remember we're getting the
[1:34:33] mind of Christ now we won't take the
[1:34:35] word Jesus where he doesn't want to go
[1:34:38] where he's not in your mind you won't
[1:34:41] take him in your heart where he's
[1:34:44] not you won't take them in in in outside
[1:34:48] in the world into places into atmospher
[1:34:52] where he's
[1:34:53] not where he does not
[1:34:58] go when God can get a man or woman in
[1:35:01] his hands so possessed in that way then
[1:35:06] you become a hot potato to the devil
[1:35:14] Hallelujah the word in the bride has the
[1:35:20] power to
[1:35:22] speak her world then brother Bram say
[1:35:26] that you go speak your
[1:35:28] world speak the condition around your
[1:35:31] life and then go live on it I wonder
[1:35:35] what kind of world we have around us
[1:35:38] what kind of atmosphere we carry brother
[1:35:41] Brandon made that example he says I
[1:35:42] can't be around these are people in the
[1:35:44] church I can't be around certain people
[1:35:47] because of the atmosphere that they
[1:35:50] carry it's because the way they live
[1:35:52] their lives it's the way that they think
[1:35:55] in their minds it's the things that they
[1:35:58] speak whether people hear them or not
[1:36:01] it's the things that they place in their
[1:36:03] hearts the things that they see with
[1:36:05] their eyes the things that they allow to
[1:36:07] hear with their ears all these things
[1:36:10] creates an atmosphere around
[1:36:12] you then he says some people I just love
[1:36:15] to be
[1:36:17] around they have such a sweet atmosphere
[1:36:21] oh my brothers and
[1:36:24] sisters we want that
[1:36:26] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:36:29] Lives we want that
[1:36:33] atmosphere we got to a place in this
[1:36:37] hour we've seen what the world is
[1:36:42] doing we have walked long enough we have
[1:36:46] played messes Church long
[1:36:48] enough now it's time and I believe it's
[1:36:51] time happening I believe individuals are
[1:36:53] rising up cuz now it's time in this hour
[1:36:57] to put on this word and such a place
[1:37:00] that God will fulfill what he has spoken
[1:37:03] he's going to
[1:37:06] fulfill God is going to
[1:37:08] live it's not going to be just spoken
[1:37:11] over the pulpit it's not going to be
[1:37:13] just preached as a sermon but it's going
[1:37:16] to be lived as a sermon now that is the
[1:37:19] word made flesh again to today that's
[1:37:22] what the people are
[1:37:25] craving they're not craving church
[1:37:28] anymore the buildings that we see and
[1:37:30] all that stuff they're craving Sons and
[1:37:33] Daughters of God they want to see God in
[1:37:36] flesh again
[1:37:38] today they were in so much desperation
[1:37:41] before Jesus
[1:37:42] came Israel was in so much bondage they
[1:37:46] were crying for the Messiah and when he
[1:37:49] came on the scene he started
[1:37:52] manifesting God and flesh to the people
[1:37:56] and look at what it created my brothers
[1:37:58] and sisters and look in this hour when
[1:38:00] God became flesh again and a
[1:38:03] prophet look what the look at the
[1:38:05] attraction look at the hunger and The
[1:38:08] Thirst that the people had what what was
[1:38:10] it for a Kentucky man
[1:38:12] no it was God and a
[1:38:16] man it's God in a
[1:38:19] man are we putting it off to the Future
[1:38:22] that God's going to do it in the
[1:38:24] future and being lazy

[1:39:16] I'm here it can't be man doing it but
[1:39:19] God is here accomplish in
[1:39:25] it three kinds of people in the world
[1:39:29] today number
[1:39:31] one those who
[1:39:33] learn from their own
[1:39:36] experiences that was
[1:39:39] Solomon number
[1:39:41] two those people who learn from other
[1:39:43] people's
[1:39:45] experiences they are happy
[1:39:48] people but then number three
[1:39:51] those who don't learn from their
[1:39:53] experiences or other people's
[1:39:56] experiences they are
[1:40:00] fools they are
[1:40:03] fools Hallelujah Jesus
[1:40:08] said the thief comes to
[1:40:14] destroy and
[1:40:16] steal and kill but I have come I have
[1:40:22] come I'm not
[1:40:24] coming I have come I'm here to give you
[1:40:28] life and more
[1:40:30] abundantly
[1:40:33] Hallelujah I'm going to be finishing up
[1:40:40] soon just pray for
[1:40:44] me I I was wrestling and fighting all
[1:40:48] night two times this weekend I could
[1:40:51] have end up in the
[1:40:53] hospital but God had to manifest his
[1:40:55] word to me that he's real and he
[1:40:58] delivered me
[1:41:00] twice
[1:41:08] supernaturally
[1:41:10] hallelujah it's not about me it's about
[1:41:16] him because I have to believe this word
[1:41:18] that I'm
[1:41:19] speaking
[1:41:23] hallelujah amen let's run through this I
[1:41:26] got a couple pages left and break this
[1:41:28] bring this right home your mindset is
[1:41:31] the set of beliefs that shape you how
[1:41:34] how it makes sense it makes sense of the
[1:41:36] world that and yourself it influences
[1:41:39] how you think how you behave in any
[1:41:42] given situation it means that whatever
[1:41:44] you believe about yourself impacts the
[1:41:47] success or
[1:41:48] failures do you feel your life is within
[1:41:52] your control or your destiny to be a
[1:41:55] certain way do you believe in personal
[1:41:58] growth do you believe in transformation
[1:42:01] change or are you content to stay in
[1:42:03] your comfort
[1:42:05] zone things that we need to think
[1:42:10] about our attitude
[1:42:13] adopts adoption of our attitudes a
[1:42:16] progression press on is our attitude
[1:42:20] move forward is our attitude we're not
[1:42:24] looking to
[1:42:25] Perfection but we're looking to press on
[1:42:28] and move forward because perfection in
[1:42:31] this flesh and in this life does not
[1:42:34] exist but we can move forward and we can
[1:42:37] press on with this word
[1:42:40] hallelujah we have to be careful not to
[1:42:43] identify with our struggles with our
[1:42:47] weaknesses be very
[1:42:49] careful because they are not
[1:42:53] you when you recognize who you are you
[1:42:56] recognize you are not your struggles or
[1:42:59] your weaknesses or your failures or your
[1:43:03] sins you are not them but there's a
[1:43:08] blood Jesus Christ's blood that cleanses
[1:43:12] us so we have an atonement made for us
[1:43:16] that we can keep pressing forward and
[1:43:19] moving on with this
[1:43:21] word because that what I'm talking about
[1:43:24] this morning what the devil uses so much
[1:43:26] to stop us to condemn us from moving
[1:43:29] forward is our
[1:43:31] flesh give him the
[1:43:35] blood show him the
[1:43:37] blood show him
[1:43:41] Calvary show him the victory that Jesus
[1:43:44] gave to us and press forward with this
[1:43:48] word in your life
[1:43:52] if the enemy can control your mind he
[1:43:55] can control your thought pattern when
[1:43:57] you agree with those thoughts you
[1:43:59] believe them then they lead you into
[1:44:02] your actions your actions go according
[1:44:05] to what you think when you are watching
[1:44:09] the territory of your mind you won't let
[1:44:12] any thought come in there that is not of
[1:44:15] God now brother bran speaking
[1:44:18] here in greatest battle of
[1:44:23] F you got your
[1:44:25] senses see taste feel smell and hear
[1:44:29] they're all right but don't trust them
[1:44:32] unless they agree with the word of God
[1:44:35] don't listen to
[1:44:36] them now you got imagination conscious
[1:44:39] memory reasoning and
[1:44:42] affections they're all right if they
[1:44:44] agree with the word of God but if your
[1:44:46] affections doesn't agree with the word
[1:44:48] of God get rid of it
[1:44:54] if your reason disagrees with that word
[1:44:57] get rid of it right
[1:45:00] away if memory if your imagination if
[1:45:04] your conscience disagrees with that
[1:45:06] which which is on the inside get rid of
[1:45:09] it when God can get a man in his hands
[1:45:12] till he can get senses conscious
[1:45:14] everything cleaned out until he stands
[1:45:17] with God behind it in the spirit there
[1:45:20] there's not a devil in the world that
[1:45:24] can poke a doubt in
[1:45:27] there you want to know brother brother
[1:45:29] Tim how do I get to that place when you
[1:45:31] know there's not a devil that can poke a
[1:45:34] doubt in
[1:45:39] there you see your mind is a gate to
[1:45:41] your
[1:45:43] spirit your mind opens up and accepts
[1:45:45] the spirit or rejects the spirit you can
[1:45:48] have little conscience and little
[1:45:49] feelings and little Sensations
[1:45:51] and all these things we talked about all
[1:45:54] this
[1:45:55] stuff that has nothing to do with it but
[1:45:59] when it comes down to
[1:46:01] reality your mind opens it up your mind
[1:46:05] either accepts it or rejects it my
[1:46:09] friends
[1:46:11] Hallelujah now listen brother
[1:46:15] brandom notice the Harmony in the father
[1:46:18] and the son Jesus Jesus never did
[1:46:21] anything until it first shown to him by
[1:46:25] the Father John
[1:46:26] 5:19 so we just read this
[1:46:29] quote brother brand I'm talking about
[1:46:31] the mind and not accepting everything
[1:46:34] that's not of the word of God now he's
[1:46:38] speaking here the harmony between the
[1:46:40] father and the son now he's getting into
[1:46:42] the
[1:46:45] relationship that he had with the
[1:46:48] father this harmony
[1:46:51] now not tomorrow not in the future
[1:46:54] Brother Brad saying now exists between
[1:46:58] the groom and his
[1:47:00] bride the same
[1:47:02] Harmony why because she's got her mind
[1:47:06] under the control of the word of
[1:47:09] God that's
[1:47:12] why now listen he shows her his Word of
[1:47:17] Life she receives it not anything else
[1:47:22] not our emotions not our feelings not
[1:47:24] anything the word God don't come to you
[1:47:27] by feeling or
[1:47:30] emotion when he comes he's the word he
[1:47:33] shows you his word personally to you in
[1:47:36] your life he places that word because
[1:47:38] it's a part of you it's your part to
[1:47:42] fulfill now listen she receives it she
[1:47:46] never dealt
[1:47:48] it why can she never dealt doubt it my
[1:47:50] brothers and
[1:47:53] sisters because she has cleaning out her
[1:47:57] mind she's taken all reasoning all doubt
[1:48:01] everything that's against the word of
[1:48:02] God she's cast it out of her
[1:48:05] mind she's gone through the
[1:48:10] process that's why she's in this place
[1:48:14] now where she's in harmony with the
[1:48:17] father with the groom they becoming one
[1:48:21] and the
[1:48:26] same she never doubts it therefore
[1:48:28] nothing can harm her not even death

[1:51:18] Ministry and he did didn't complet it in
[1:51:20] this day back just with the prophet was

[1:51:33] bride she knows that for
[1:51:36] it was not yet time for him to do
[1:51:39] certain things that he must do but he
[1:51:43] will now fulfill through the bride are
[1:51:45] we
[1:51:46] listening that work which he left for
[1:51:50] this specific time seven Church ages
[1:51:53] pergamus Church
[1:51:55] age yes sir there's no longer
[1:52:00] the yes sir the
[1:52:03] church is no longer the mouthpiece of
[1:52:07] God it's its own
[1:52:12] mouthpiece oh
[1:52:14] okay you know what we had a man of God
[1:52:18] and we still have a man of God
[1:52:21] in my life for 30 something years
[1:52:22] preaching over this pulpit and this man
[1:52:25] of
[1:52:26] God because of him I have
[1:52:30] boldness to speak the word of God
[1:52:33] because I I've seen this man of God
[1:52:35] which is our pastor
[1:52:37] Simon speak
[1:52:40] things that other people weren't
[1:52:42] speaking at certain times and it showed
[1:52:46] me and gave me the faith that when God
[1:52:50] wanted to come to me as an individual
[1:52:53] and say speak this I ain't Bound By Any
[1:52:58] tradition in this message or any person
[1:53:01] or personality in this
[1:53:05] message the church is no longer the
[1:53:07] mouthpiece of God it's his own
[1:53:09] mouthpiece let me tell
[1:53:12] you and I'm going to speak what I
[1:53:16] believe in my heart this message is no
[1:53:19] longer
[1:53:20] the mouthpiece of God oh that's tough
[1:53:25] what do you mean brother
[1:53:26] Tim the mess age the message is in
[1:53:31] confusion now I'm not talking about the
[1:53:34] word I'm not talking about Christ I'm
[1:53:37] not talking about the
[1:53:43] bride
[1:53:46] no so God is turning to her who's her
[1:53:51] this is out of the prophet's own mouth
[1:53:54] God has turned into
[1:53:56] her he will confront her through the
[1:53:58] prophet and the bride for the voice of
[1:54:01] God will be in her yes
[1:54:06] sir yeah that's what he said yes sir it
[1:54:10] is for it says in the last chapter of
[1:54:14] the Book of
[1:54:16] Revelations musicians
[1:54:18] come Revelation
[1:54:23] 17 the spirit and the bride say come
[1:54:27] once more the world will hear directly
[1:54:28] from God as in
[1:54:32] Pentecost that word bride will be the
[1:54:35] same as the
[1:54:37] first my brothers I want to finish this
[1:54:39] but
[1:54:40] I'm I'm just got no energy
[1:54:46] left I am
[1:54:48] drained
[1:55:04] yes listen to the prophet of God who
[1:55:06] appears in the last age what he says
[1:55:09] from God the bride will
[1:55:11] say the spirit and the prophet and the
[1:55:14] bride will say the same
[1:55:16] thing what they will say we will have
[1:55:19] have already been said in the
[1:55:21] word they are saying it now come out
[1:55:24] from amongst her and be
[1:55:26] separated the cry has gone
[1:55:29] out is going out
[1:55:31] now God still has a
[1:55:34] voice for the
[1:55:36] people in the world and he has given a
[1:55:39] voice to the bride that voice is in the
[1:55:45] bride

[1:58:12] we uh we just Rejoice to see you
[1:58:15] together amen God bless you real good um
[1:58:19] just a commentary in the sense that um
[1:58:23] uh I believe it's in the present stage
[1:58:26] of my Ministry 1962 brother brandham
[1:58:30] said oh at last the separating time has
[1:58:34] come the separating time has
[1:58:38] come and as I listened to brother Tim uh
[1:58:43] this morning and thinking of the other
[1:58:46] brothers and their Ministry of the word
[1:58:50] then I began to think of Ruth how she
[1:58:54] was stresing in the field which is to
[1:58:58] say the the Harvesters had already
[1:59:03] passed and now the bride uh Ruth was now
[1:59:08] picking up the last grains that happened
[1:59:11] to be still laying around somewhere
[1:59:14] searching for them so I'm applying that
[1:59:18] to the fact that
[1:59:19] we are in that level now where these
[1:59:24] brothers are preaching and we are
[1:59:27] actually searching we are seeking just
[1:59:31] to find that last one
[1:59:34] somewhere covered up by a layer of dirt
[1:59:38] covered up by layers of problems covered
[1:59:42] up in every way with every possible uh
[1:59:46] disguise Satan could put on them
[1:59:49] yeah Satan will just put mud on the son
[1:59:52] of a king or turn him to look like a
[1:59:55] beggar and look like something else when
[1:59:58] he is nothing of the kind but thanks be
[2:00:02] to God the separating time has come the
[2:00:06] Holy Spirit the real Holy Spirit uh you
[2:00:10] know I was thinking about it when the
[2:00:12] message came to myself and another
[2:00:17] brother we are still still in touch we
[2:00:20] still talk and the message came I was in
[2:00:24] the heights of Pentecost uh we were in
[2:00:27] the heights of
[2:00:28] Pentecost and then I can see that all
[2:00:33] these Miracle signs and wonders that
[2:00:36] were happening in me uh in Pentecost God
[2:00:39] was using us and you were having Revival
[2:00:42] and that sort of thing but then I could
[2:00:46] see that it was moving from that back to
[2:00:49] the word I hadn't heard about brother
[2:00:52] brandham yet so when his message came
[2:00:56] and I read that first book uh in the
[2:01:00] heart here and knew this was it it was
[2:01:03] the word is to come to the fullness of
[2:01:06] the
[2:01:08] word and where we are now is what
[2:01:12] brother Tim was doing trashing trashing
[2:01:16] trying to find the last seed
[2:01:19] the last ones that may be out here and
[2:01:24] so I pass by I see the churches the
[2:01:28] parking lots filled thousands of
[2:01:32] people and we know we have the
[2:01:36] truth and
[2:01:38] yet we just have a certain amount maybe
[2:01:41] a few hundred
[2:01:43] people and sometimes the human part you
[2:01:47] wonder why but no know the holy spirit
[2:01:50] said this is what I said it'll be a
[2:01:52] narrow way and few there be that will
[2:01:57] find it amen we have the highway and
[2:02:00] then we have Lanes in the highway right
[2:02:03] uh some struggle to even find the right
[2:02:06] Highway uh and then uh to they find the
[2:02:09] highway but they can't keep in their
[2:02:10] Lane but we thank God that the holy
[2:02:13] spirit is using these brothers to keep
[2:02:16] us in the lane now remember they all
[2:02:19] different they they can't be me and they
[2:02:21] are not me and I am not them we are part
[2:02:25] of the five-fold
[2:02:27] ministry and and I'm so thankful to uh
[2:02:31] brother uh our brother Tim using the
[2:02:34] reference of how the faith the perfect
[2:02:38] faith is not in the tapes it's not going
[2:02:42] to lay in the tapes the perfect faith is
[2:02:46] going to come into the hearts of God's
[2:02:50] people and that's where the perfect
[2:02:52] Faith becomes effective uh because faith
[2:02:55] without works is dead and it has to work
[2:02:58] through somebody amen and God always
[2:03:03] hides in Simplicity brother's last
[2:03:06] thought was on the hiding God hiding
[2:03:08] himself and he always hides himself to
[2:03:11] look so simple and looks like nothing it
[2:03:14] doesn't appear to be anything and he
[2:03:16] says if you're not watching that
[2:03:17] thing'll pass right by you and you
[2:03:20] would't even recognize what is going on
[2:03:23] I believe we are living in this time
[2:03:25] right now and I believe that that
[2:03:28] message that we heard for those who have
[2:03:30] ears to hears they will hear it and it
[2:03:33] will be a real blessing to them now in
[2:03:35] the weeks ahead we have our
[2:03:38] Christmas um uh dinner coming up is that
[2:03:43] right next week next Sunday okay next
[2:03:46] Sunday will be our Christmas Christmas
[2:03:49] dinner I hope all of you can be there
[2:03:51] there's no excuse for not being there
[2:03:54] you say brother Simon I can't afford it
[2:03:56] brother Simon I don't have money uh well
[2:03:59] God bless you because God has anointed
[2:04:02] and blessed some Believers enough to be
[2:04:05] able to say no I'll not only pay for
[2:04:07] myself I'm I'm going to leave enough for
[2:04:10] about 10 others or or so to be able to
[2:04:13] come if they don't have the funds okay
[2:04:17] now now it's right there so you don't
[2:04:21] have an excuse that of why you're not
[2:04:24] there because you couldn't afford it
[2:04:26] because just like he did the Believers
[2:04:29] now do it uh God has already made the
[2:04:32] way for you so so don't be afraid don't
[2:04:36] feel embarrassed or in any way but just
[2:04:39] walk right in and rejoice like everybody
[2:04:42] else when that time comes praise the
[2:04:45] Lord amen and God bless you in all the
[2:04:49] weeks ahead to the end of the year I
[2:04:51] believe it's 50 days left um uh uh
[2:04:54] towards the Handover or the turnover of
[2:04:58] this ministry to the hands of brother
[2:05:01] Danny and sister Jennifer misil and the
[2:05:06] word of God remember the faces may
[2:05:09] change is that
[2:05:11] right the color of the person may
[2:05:15] change the the they built of the
[2:05:20] person I'm sorry just my I'm just being
[2:05:23] natural that's all
[2:05:25] is uh may change but the word continues
[2:05:30] amen listen at the voice praise the Lord
[2:05:34] listen to The Voice and I know what I'm
[2:05:37] saying don't be influenced praise the
[2:05:40] Lord you know when I was very young and
[2:05:43] I began to preach the word the church
[2:05:46] filled up with a whole lot of young
[2:05:47] ladies
[2:05:50] no that's I'm telling you the truth it
[2:05:52] filled up with a lot of young ladies and
[2:05:56] um they were always talking to me nicely
[2:05:58] oh brother Simon over brother Simon and
[2:06:01] of course their mothers will invite me
[2:06:03] to their home and when I go they'll have
[2:06:06] their daughter serving and bringing out
[2:06:09] nice Delicacies and stuff like that and
[2:06:13] that I was so focused on the holy spirit
[2:06:18] that it it annoyed me uh and so I spoke
[2:06:22] to the elderly brother that was the one
[2:06:25] that um led us to Pentecost and said
[2:06:28] brother brother Alexander what's going
[2:06:31] on what's Happening why why where are
[2:06:34] they doing this and all he could do was
[2:06:37] just
[2:06:38] chuckle he just bowed his head and he
[2:06:41] had a big chuckle then he says Oh
[2:06:43] Brother these things happen because God
[2:06:47] could allow all of that happen but from
[2:06:49] amongst them the holy spirit will call
[2:06:51] out those that are really his okay he
[2:06:55] says other than that that attraction is
[2:06:59] caused by the Holy Spirit again right to
[2:07:02] bring them really to himself not to you
[2:07:05] so that you don't make a mistake and
[2:07:08] think that it's just attraction by you
[2:07:12] but this is to point back to the word
[2:07:14] amen praise the Lord I want you to know
[2:07:18] that we are not to be influenced by
[2:07:20] outward
[2:07:22] appearance let us be influenced only by
[2:07:26] the
[2:07:27] word I'll speak rank raw whether a black
[2:07:31] man is preaching it whether a white man
[2:07:35] is preaching it whether a Chinese is
[2:07:38] preaching it whether a Japanese is
[2:07:41] preaching it doesn't matter who is
[2:07:43] preaching it listen to The Voice hear
[2:07:47] the word of God amen and I can speak
[2:07:50] like that because um I went to school
[2:07:54] with every race and Jews white black
[2:07:57] everything else and um when my Ministry
[2:08:02] started it started that way I the church
[2:08:05] would
[2:08:06] start and there were only 6,000 whites
[2:08:09] in the country and maybe a few thousand
[2:08:12] Jews uh Portuguese a few but before I
[2:08:15] knew it my church was always filled with
[2:08:18] mixed it never was one set of people it
[2:08:22] was always mixed not by my choice not by
[2:08:26] my searching for anybody it just happens
[2:08:28] that way and I believe that happens
[2:08:31] because if your spirit is pure and clear
[2:08:35] God completely does that on his own and
[2:08:39] people know it you you just can't hide
[2:08:41] stuff like that it's right in you and as
[2:08:43] a brother preached you create an
[2:08:45] atmosphere around you and that
[2:08:47] atmosphere with you so I want you to
[2:08:50] know right now praise God let the Holy
[2:08:55] Spirit be the center of your influence
[2:08:58] amen is that right amen let him be the
[2:09:01] one that will charge and recharge and
[2:09:03] Quicken your life and keep you solidly
[2:09:06] in line with the word of God Amen praise
[2:09:11] God I I say these things because I know
[2:09:14] many times the um senior pastor or
[2:09:18] experienced Pastor older Pastor leaves
[2:09:22] and then a few people just want to uh
[2:09:26] leave and slide away this way or that
[2:09:28] way or the other way but don't let it be
[2:09:31] that way because who who who is your
[2:09:34] eyes on you're to look away to Jesus
[2:09:37] amen right praise the Lord I'll be
[2:09:40] around but you're not looking to me
[2:09:42] you're look into him and if you have
[2:09:45] really caught the revelation of this
[2:09:47] last prophet's message your eyes will be
[2:09:50] on him alone am is that right praise the
[2:09:54] name of the Lord God bless you I've sat
[2:09:57] under I've sat under women preachers
[2:10:00] I've sat under East Indian pastors I've
[2:10:04] sought under white pastors I've sought
[2:10:07] under black pastors I've sought under
[2:10:10] every kind and brother sister I always
[2:10:14] listen for the word amen and not when
[2:10:17] I'm in the message be even from before
[2:10:20] that's the reason why they threw me out
[2:10:22] of Pentecost because I always listen for
[2:10:24] the word and the word is the main thing
[2:10:28] we are to listen for now I'm not going
[2:10:30] to hold you any longer I think I said
[2:10:32] enough I just throw out a few things
[2:10:34] there um it's just for you to start
[2:10:37] thinking preparing your hearts preparing
[2:10:40] your minds because uh in the words of
[2:10:43] the Prophet two of us can't be on the
[2:10:46] scene at the same time
[2:10:49] right the spirit of God came down Jesus
[2:10:52] came down he said now I have to go now I
[2:10:56] don't have to go like he went I mean
[2:10:58] he's gone he's gone home but I I have to
[2:11:03] move off of the scene so that our
[2:11:06] brother's Ministry can begin to bloom
[2:11:09] and Blossom that it can grow that it can
[2:11:13] manifest itself in its individual way I
[2:11:16] know that our brother thinks it's
[2:11:19] happening now but really it's not
[2:11:21] happening now it's only after I step
[2:11:24] away then the spirit of God can transfer
[2:11:28] himself right as it did from Moses on
[2:11:31] down so the spirit of God moves like
[2:11:34] that God has a way of doing things it
[2:11:36] doesn't look like if it's oh there's no
[2:11:39] order there was you know there's no
[2:11:42] regimentation but God has his way of
[2:11:44] doing things amen and everything works
[2:11:47] out for his honor and for his glory so
[2:11:50] so I will be stepping away um as uh as
[2:11:54] of January first uh brother Danny and
[2:11:59] sister Jennifer here will be in charge
[2:12:03] of the church and the flock of God that
[2:12:06] is among you will follow the leadership
[2:12:09] of the holy spirit that will be
[2:12:11] projecting itself through them for God's
[2:12:14] glory and for God's honor are you
[2:12:16] willing to do that amen
