[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good evening friends it's good to be
[0:17] here with you to share with you the
[0:22] wonderful words of life may God bless
[0:26] each and every one maybe you read from
[0:30] the scriptures John chapter 14 verses 25
[0:39] to 26 in another lesson on the seven
[0:44] church ages these things have I spoken
[0:49] unto you being yet present with you but
[0:54] the comforter which is the Holy Ghost
[0:57] whom the father will send in my name he
[1:02] shall teach you all things and bring all
[1:08] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[1:13] have said unto you our gracious Heavenly
[1:19] Father we ask your divine blessing upon
[1:22] this bread of life as we receive it with
[1:26] thankful hearts in Jesus name Amen and
[1:31] amen
[1:33] well friends no man
[1:39] no matter how wise how learn it he is
[1:44] how intelligent how smart he is how
[1:49] intellectually wonderful he is no man
[1:55] knows the things of God save the Spirit
[2:01] of God for known only to him are the
[2:05] great hidden secrets and again who by
[2:10] searching can find out God only he to
[2:17] whom the Spirit
[2:20] well revealed it took we need to call in
[2:25] God therefore not depend on the great
[2:30] academia of men upon the tea ologies of
[2:36] men their variants various presumptions
[2:42] of man or propounded principles of men
[2:46] though they may be good but let every
[2:50] man's work be a lie God says and my word
[2:55] must be the truth the very anchor of
[2:59] your soul they rock of your salvation so
[3:05] we have accepted the Bible and we have
[3:08] accepted the great truths of the Bible
[3:12] but it is still not real too many people
[3:17] who are confused and this is because of
[3:21] the lack of revelation the revelation by
[3:26] the Holy Spirit is not there and the
[3:32] word in them has not been quickened for
[3:37] his name if the seed be planted the
[3:41] water will raise it up again the rain of
[3:45] the Holy Spirit will germinated and
[3:49] bring the seeds of God to God's Word
[3:53] into life now friends almost all Bible
[3:59] students believe that our New Testament
[4:04] was written originally in the Greek
[4:08] language also all Bible students agree
[4:13] that God gave us three great nations the
[4:20] Greeks who gave us a universal language
[4:27] the Jews
[4:29] who gave us true religion and true
[4:34] knowledge of one God through our Savior
[4:40] the Lord Jesus Christ the Romans who
[4:47] gave us unified Empire government law
[4:54] and a system of unparalleled highways
[4:59] and thus from the contributions to to
[5:06] our faith and to Christianity these
[5:09] three great nations have helped us to
[5:17] grasp the Word of God now we find
[5:21] friends the Romans gave us a unified
[5:25] Empire as we have said and the roads
[5:33] with which to spread the gospel
[5:36] everywhere
[5:38] the Greeks gave us a universal language
[5:42] by which the Word of God could be
[5:46] communicated and so the Jews they gave
[5:53] us the greatest of all true religion and
[5:58] true knowledge and understanding wisdom
[6:02] of one God which I believe came through
[6:08] Jesus Christ our Savior now historically
[6:15] that seems to be about right that seems
[6:19] to be about correct and today's our
[6:24] Greek scholars say that the Greek
[6:28] language of the Bible days was so
[6:32] perfect an exact that if a student of
[6:38] Greek is refined and
[6:42] curate very knowledgeable and if he
[6:46] isn't accurate romera he can truly know
[6:52] what the scripture especially of the New
[6:56] Testament in the word is teaching now
[7:03] that's wonderful to hear that but is
[7:07] that really true
[7:11] we know that when two Bible eminent by
[7:16] the scholars of two different
[7:19] denominations get together let's say for
[7:22] a debate over any minor thing in the
[7:26] Word of God or major thing in the Word
[7:29] of God you cannot get them to agree
[7:32] that's the reason why there 2 or 3 or
[7:35] 3,000 various denominations all because
[7:41] of this fact they're words based on the
[7:47] exact and identical words of the Greek
[7:51] language and grammar and they still
[7:56] disagree and that's just the way that it
[8:02] is I tell you friends I'm sure that we
[8:09] can see that there is some kind of a
[8:12] conflict there now prior to the Nicean
[8:16] council of 325 AD there were two great
[8:21] students of the word of god one by the
[8:26] name of areas and the other one as a
[8:29] nation and they became locked in
[8:34] doctrinal battle doctrinal combat over a
[8:41] greek word okay of course the argument
[8:46] really at that time was over one God
[8:50] versus trinitarianism we will not get
[8:55] into
[8:55] at this time but the fact is to great
[8:59] evidence scholars were in debate over
[9:06] greek of one understanding one word in
[9:10] greek and that caused a split and a
[9:16] division over the entire world
[9:20] now if greek is or what's so perfect and
[9:25] so ordained of God why was there such a
[9:32] dispute for God hates division I'm sure
[9:40] my friends God did never did not and
[9:45] never has intended for all of us to know
[9:48] Greek so that we can know the Bible or
[9:52] perfectly understand what the Bible is
[9:56] really saying or even to know Latin from
[10:00] the Romans or all of us to know Hebrew
[10:05] so that we can all understand the Bible
[10:09] on the day of Pentecost when the Holy
[10:11] Spirit fell every nation under the Sun
[10:15] regardless of what language they spoke
[10:18] they all heard the voice of God and when
[10:23] the voice of God speaks through the Holy
[10:25] Spirit it's universal it has nothing to
[10:29] do with languages nothing of the sort
[10:33] it has to do with revelation and
[10:35] understanding wisdom given by the holy
[10:40] spirit alone parts not my mental might
[10:43] of human beings amen nor by the great
[10:49] acumen or power but by the Spirit of the
[10:54] Living God is the Word of God revealed
[10:57] thanks be to God now my friends let us
[11:02] step just a little further today we have
[11:06] students who claim
[11:09] it really wasn't Greek because Jesus in
[11:14] his day spoke the language of the of the
[11:18] street people of the ordinary people
[11:21] just the regular language spoken on the
[11:26] street about foxes and about a fig tree
[11:30] or or some commonplace thing and they
[11:35] are saying that it was a great ring it
[11:39] was our make so so so it was just the
[11:44] language that was spoken by the regular
[11:47] person and we have many students like
[11:50] that and our historians even at the
[11:53] present times are divided over that fact
[11:58] now we know that there one was one
[12:03] called dr. Lanza and he was very
[12:08] convinced that the New Testament was
[12:12] written in ink in Aramaic he was backed
[12:18] up by T on me that this was written in
[12:24] Aramaic and not Greek all my friends
[12:30] don't you see right there this division
[12:34] again not Greek it was written in our
[12:38] mate and then they contend then later in
[12:43] Greek my friends Bible scholars
[12:51] splitting hairs over words and grammar
[12:55] and to this very present day we as the
[13:00] Church of the Living God in the last
[13:02] days are divided
[13:06] another group of these scholars as I've
[13:11] for said believes that it was written in
[13:15] the Aramaic language of the common
[13:18] people and so we find theologian
[13:23] seminarians we find all of these great
[13:27] the translators and scholars are
[13:31] fighting and debating each other over
[13:34] which is the purest language to convey
[13:39] or in which the Word of God or the
[13:43] understanding of the Word of God was
[13:46] relieved was it Greek was it Latin was
[13:50] it Aramaic
[13:51] what was it I believe that language was
[13:56] the universal language of the voice of
[13:59] God in these last days that whenever God
[14:04] speaks his words are universal and never
[14:08] mind a language that tongues the
[14:11] translations the voice of the Spirit
[14:14] goes to the heart to the crutches and
[14:18] inside the innate seed life of that man
[14:22] that gene life of that man or that woman
[14:25] will understand for my sheep hear my
[14:30] voice and a stranger they will not
[14:34] follow but they will recognize the voice
[14:37] of their Savior God Shepherd lead to
[14:42] leading them calling out to them guiding
[14:46] them by his blessed Holy Spirit praise
[14:50] God so we can see we cannot base our
[14:54] understanding and interpretation of the
[14:58] word of God and base it upon the
[15:01] profound knowledge of great students of
[15:06] the language of the Bible of what it was
[15:10] written in know absolutely you see
[15:13] because you can read the Bible you can
[15:16] know Greek know all this language but
[15:19] once you are veiled in your mind you
[15:23] will not recognize God speaking through
[15:27] the word and the God you seek and that
[15:32] God you try to serve
[15:34] we'll be miss understood and he will be
[15:38] unrecognized and he's the one that must
[15:42] be reveal himself in and through his own
[15:47] words now think about it let us go back
[15:52] in time go back to the times of Jesus
[15:56] when there were candles in the street
[15:59] donkeys industry goats and sheep and
[16:03] travelers in their Eastern garments
[16:07] shrugging through the streets that that
[16:10] the call cry at the bazaars that were
[16:14] nearby and Jesus lived in such an
[16:18] environment the Pharisees were there the
[16:21] Sadducees Epicureans the Stoics others
[16:24] The Libertines they were all there at
[16:27] that particular time and that age of
[16:31] which we are speaking but amongst them
[16:34] it is understood that the Jewish
[16:38] Pharisees and Sadducees were the most
[16:43] eminent scholars and knowledgeable of
[16:48] the Word of God no we must we must grasp
[16:53] this my friends if anyone was to
[16:57] understand what language it was written
[17:00] in it was they it was the Pharisees and
[17:04] the Sadducees they would have known
[17:07] because that was their time that was the
[17:11] language or languages that they
[17:14] understood clearly for the award of most
[17:18] eminent for their day and for their time
[17:22] so they knew in 33 AD the exact meaning
[17:28] of the words the exact grammars that
[17:33] were supposed to be used every song that
[17:37] would be there there would be familiar
[17:40] ways better than anyone in our day and
[17:44] yet they miss August
[17:48] the Word of God for their day the Word
[17:51] made flesh we see clearly here they
[17:56] missed the revelation of God's Word made
[17:59] manifested in the flesh because there he
[18:04] was open the world was open for them to
[18:08] see and yet they were blinded to the
[18:12] very presence of the Word of God which
[18:16] was in the beginning and which was God
[18:19] and our word was made flesh and they did
[18:24] not recognize who he was just as much
[18:28] that it changed from flesh form first
[18:31] from spirit form in the flesh warm and
[18:35] now in the word form and what I am
[18:39] seeing is that just as much as they did
[18:43] not recognize the very word that was in
[18:48] flesh form they did not recognize the
[18:51] very God that they worship the very
[18:54] Bible the very Psalms they were reading
[18:57] from my God my God why hast thou
[19:00] forsaken me oh you see my bones how
[19:04] they're showing true and and various
[19:07] other parts of the various scriptures
[19:10] that did not recognize that it was
[19:13] speaking of him the word that did not
[19:16] recognize the word for their day
[19:18] now that word replete tell tells us
[19:22] clearly that he was going back to God
[19:25] went back to spirit form but I wouldn't
[19:28] leave you I'll come back to you which we
[19:30] understand to be in the form of the Holy
[19:33] Spirit same God and he is here with us
[19:37] in the form of Holy Spirit amen to
[19:41] quicken his word for the people are
[19:45] looking at the Bible and scrapping
[19:49] around like hands in the chicken yard
[19:53] trying to peck a little here and back a
[19:56] little there
[19:58] they're human miniscule wisdom of 40 50
[20:04] 70 80 even a hundred years against a God
[20:08] an eternal God and his unfathomable mind
[20:13] oh my god
[20:16] don't you see clearly no man no woman
[20:19] get by searching can find out God and
[20:23] only to wound the Holy Spirit of God
[20:26] will reveal it knowledge wisdom reading
[20:31] learning is is wonderful and it's great
[20:36] and we should have it but our dependency
[20:39] is not upon these things amen
[20:42] but upon the great Holy Spirit to open
[20:46] up and to reveal the Word of God to us
[20:49] so not by man's profound knowledge but
[20:53] by the revelation of the Holy Spirit
[20:56] making himself known now we know that
[21:02] God through the centuries through the
[21:07] eons of trained God has been trained to
[21:12] reveal himself to man and he tried to
[21:15] make himself known to them that he was
[21:20] this coming the scientists coming Savior
[21:22] this seed of the woman that he was going
[21:25] to come into flesh pass through a woman
[21:27] and be here upon the earth and from
[21:32] Genesis to Malachi through signs through
[21:36] pipes through symbols shadows he tried
[21:40] to make himself known and many whole
[21:45] chapters in our Bible especially in the
[21:50] Old Testament pointed clearly to him and
[21:58] the Pharisees who were students of the
[22:02] Bible so clear-headed so wonderful
[22:08] marvelous and to this day their
[22:10] generations are the top scholars in
[22:13] wisdom and knowledge in the world it was
[22:19] said of these Jewish Pharisees that they
[22:23] could take a pin or something sharp and
[22:28] stick it through the Torah and from the
[22:32] verse that they were reading on the top
[22:34] page they could tell you every other
[22:37] verse right to the bottom of that pin of
[22:43] what was said within those scriptures
[22:46] they were that eminent intellectual and
[22:50] sharp in their knowledge and yet they
[22:57] knew or I regardless of our position or
[23:01] Papa you know any of our achievements
[23:06] accomplishments to dare to think we can
[23:09] pit our minds against the mind of the
[23:12] Most High who by searching the
[23:15] scriptures who by searching the things
[23:18] of man can't find out God none but the
[23:23] Spirit of God and to whom he will reveal
[23:28] it clearly friends let us come to a
[23:31] conclusion of this matter because back
[23:37] in those days with the Pharisees and
[23:40] Sadducees only a few had a revelation
[23:44] and the knowledge of who he was and God
[23:48] promised that he would reveal his word
[23:52] just to his faithful few for broad is
[23:56] the way my friends broad that's the way
[24:01] but he asked us to walk in the narrow
[24:03] way and how fear not little flock it is
[24:10] your father's good pleasure to give you
[24:12] the kingdom just a little luck it's been
[24:16] the so in the days of Noah just a few
[24:19] made it in the ark in the days of
[24:22] Moses coming through the wilderness they
[24:25] left two million of them or friends but
[24:29] only two from that original group with a
[24:33] lot of youngsters made it into the
[24:36] Promised Land
[24:38] in the days of Jesus he called out from
[24:44] amongst that generation only about 500
[24:49] disciples and then John chapter 6 verse
[24:54] 6 to 6 when he told them eat my flesh
[24:57] drink my blood they did not depend on
[25:00] the Holy Spirit of God to fully
[25:02] understand what he was saying and they
[25:05] totally misunderstood him thinking he
[25:07] was asking them to become a cannibal to
[25:10] eat his flesh and drink his blood my
[25:13] friends I tell you and the Bible says
[25:17] they walked no more with him and we know
[25:21] it had to be true about 380 of those 500
[25:26] disciples because under their Pentecost
[25:28] there was only a hundred and twenty in
[25:31] that Upper Room so me Fred few there be
[25:35] that find it and only a few in the Nate
[25:39] days of Jesus really caught who it was
[25:43] my friends the Shepherd's unto you in
[25:48] the City of David is born a savior which
[25:51] is Christ the Lord
[25:54] of course it was Joseph a very simple
[25:57] humble people that received the
[26:01] revelation and knew who this was BC
[26:07] Zacharias and Elizabeth also had the
[26:12] revelation of who this was and lastly a
[26:17] blind old blind woman and a so-called
[26:21] crackpot old preacher that lived in the
[26:25] temple in the presence of Almighty God
[26:28] and just pushed off to the side saying
[26:31] oh I think this
[26:33] man is saying this the things this woman
[26:37] is saying is it's just off of the norm
[26:40] it's off of the normal things but he
[26:43] knew what he was talking about only
[26:47] those Simeon and Anna Mary and Joseph
[26:54] Zacharias and Elizabeth and the
[26:57] shepherds and later on others began to
[27:02] break into this knowledge of this truth
[27:05] and of this revelation but friends let
[27:11] me say of course we believe in trying to
[27:14] find all this and the best manuscripts
[27:18] to get the best record of the word of
[27:21] God as possible but even if we found
[27:25] that we will never arrive at the real
[27:30] meaning and the true meaning of it by
[27:36] human wisdom knowledge learning
[27:39] understanding we will not get it that
[27:43] way we will not get it by human study we
[27:50] will never get it by Bible studies
[27:54] that's just made up of comparing
[27:57] scriptures with Scripture that is just
[28:02] something of the human mind
[28:05] we need the fertilizing an empowering
[28:10] presence of the Holy Spirit upon our
[28:14] minds and upon the in our hearts friends
[28:16] to refresh the scriptures for us I've
[28:20] said before if the seed be planted the
[28:24] water will germinate and waken up again
[28:27] praise be to God hallelujah it men yes
[28:31] sir so it will take a revelation from
[28:35] God to bring up what exactly the
[28:42] scripture is saying let me read from
[28:45] Paul listen to the
[28:46] upon which things we also speak not in
[28:52] the words which man's wisdom teacheth
[28:58] man's geology man's knowledge he's
[29:01] saying we don't get it that way it's
[29:03] right in your Bible read it for yourself
[29:06] not in the words which man's wisdom
[29:10] teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[29:15] teacheth 1st Corinthians chapter 2 verse
[29:21] 50 in our text Jesus made it clear that
[29:27] presently you can't understand but this
[29:29] comforter when he comes he will take the
[29:32] things I have spoken and he will be the
[29:35] teacher he will teach you he will reveal
[29:38] himself to you just miss Lissa this kind
[29:44] of a situation where men and women feel
[29:48] comfortable they feel comfortable in a
[29:54] structured environment to be taught of
[29:58] other men about the God of heaven not
[30:02] realizing that man can't convey to you
[30:07] the depths of God but the deep was
[30:10] called to the deep then the deep will
[30:13] respond
[30:14] it is whom he chooses to draw nigh and
[30:18] approach him and to whom the Holy Spirit
[30:21] of God read revealed himself to the true
[30:25] revelation of course is God interpreting
[30:28] his own word to you by my friends
[30:33] fulfilling and vindicating that which he
[30:39] has promised
[30:40] so the fulfillment of the word is the
[30:42] interpretation of the word oh praise God
[30:45] if this room was dark and I were to say
[30:51] let there be light and all of a sudden
[30:55] something bright comes on and you were
[30:58] never
[30:59] never seen light you never heard of it
[31:01] you don't know what it was yet when it
[31:03] came on and those lights came on you
[31:07] would immediately recognize that that
[31:09] was the interpretation or the
[31:12] vindication of what I just said and that
[31:15] is what is God convey that is what God
[31:18] is conveying to us that when his word is
[31:22] fulfilled it makes itself clear it makes
[31:26] itself crystal clear to any person a
[31:31] simple wayfaring person will understand
[31:36] and will not miss their way whatsoever
[31:39] what we feel our safety in great groups
[31:44] of people studying together we feel
[31:48] comfort in knowing dr. so-and-so and dr.
[31:51] so-and-so said this before and we rely
[31:55] upon that rather than relearning with we
[32:00] have some kind of a complex where we
[32:02] can't rely on God himself revealing and
[32:05] making himself known to us back to the
[32:07] word back to the Bible back to her
[32:10] original faith my friends rest upon the
[32:13] rock revelation upon which he said upon
[32:16] this rock heaven my father in heaven has
[32:21] revealed this on to you amen
[32:24] and upon this rock I will build my
[32:26] church and the gates of Hell will not
[32:30] prevail against it praise God
[32:34] don't be misled I believe this Bible is
[32:38] accurate because Jesus completely
[32:44] authenticated this Bible as I Boston and
[32:47] said how that the Lord Jesus
[32:50] authenticated it place the stamp upon it
[32:54] his approval upon it by consistently and
[32:58] constantly saying well did Isaiah say
[33:02] this this is well did Jeremiah
[33:06] say such and such
[33:08] such or as it was in the days of Noah as
[33:12] it was in the days of lot your father
[33:16] Abraham you see he consistently and
[33:19] constantly vindicated the Scriptures as
[33:24] being his word and as being accurate I
[33:28] believe it was compiled and I believe
[33:31] the New Testament was compiled by a holy
[33:34] men of God anointed moved by the Holy
[33:38] Spirit and is accurate make no mistake

[33:51] understanding of that infallible Word
[33:53] the wisdom the knowledge being opened up
[33:57] to us that my friends no man
[34:00] dear add or take away from the Word of
[34:05] God but we need the same Holy Spirit
[34:09] that gave us the word by inspiration to
[34:15] teach us the word by inspiration now if
[34:20] you have a record or a tape or anything
[34:24] digital the very same software by which
[34:28] the thing works or the same speed it has
[34:32] to be quickened by the same speed so
[34:35] that it can produce the voice produce
[34:38] the information whatever it is so men
[34:41] inspired men anointed by the Holy Ghost
[34:44] wrote the word under the guidance from
[34:47] the author who used them ascribes now
[34:50] that same spirit of God must also come
[34:54] again anointing men and women and
[34:57] birthday to reflect and to interpret and
[35:01] place his word for God is his own
[35:04] interpreter and interprets his word true
[35:06] anointed men and women here today all my
[35:10] friends how we need the revelation of
[35:14] the Holy Spirit we really do not need in
[35:19] your translation
[35:21] we have already have dozens and dozens
[35:24] of various translations and there's
[35:27] still a million miles away from cleaner
[35:30] and perfect understanding on the Word of
[35:33] God I'm not against them I use them
[35:36] they're wonderful marvelous indeed my
[35:40] friends some of them even have verses
[35:42] left out some pieces here and there
[35:46] that are left out and so they're good
[35:50] but let's not rely on those things and
[35:53] run after this translation that
[35:55] translation run after this dr. so-and-so
[35:58] run after his knowledge of sin so
[36:00] they're all contributing are
[36:04] contributors indeed my friends but our
[36:07] reliance must be upon the Holy Spirit to
[36:11] interpret what any man even myself
[36:14] included what I am saying what he is
[36:17] saying she is saying or anyone is saying
[36:19] that man's weren't being lying but God's
[36:23] Word must be truth if it in our hearts
[36:27] and within our lives my friends I tell
[36:29] you we need the revelation of the Holy
[36:32] Spirit

[36:37] we need if we ask God for knowledge and
[36:40] wisdom he has promised in his word he
[36:43] was not denying my friends wisdom is
[36:46] crying in the streets for the lack of
[36:49] those who want her in their lives
[36:51] revelation is crying for in the streets
[36:54] for the lack of desire for people to
[36:58] receive him or receive it within their
[37:01] heart may God continue by his Spirit to
[37:04] give us continuous life-giving
[37:07] life-giving and life-changing revelation
[37:11] for when revelation true revelation
[37:14] straights your heart it's life-changing
[37:16] and it prevails over every other talk
[37:21] that you might have had any precept you
[37:24] might have learned no matter what man
[37:26] placed upon you the Word of God banishes
[37:31] it away
