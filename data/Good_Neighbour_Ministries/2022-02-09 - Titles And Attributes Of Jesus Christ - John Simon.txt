TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] all my precious ones in christ it is indeed a wonderful wednesday and i'm happy to be here i trust that you are too uh rejoicing within yourself as you come into the presence of god [Music] here tonight we want to study concerning the the titles and attributes of jesus christ our lord in relation to this last and seventh church age and why and how he presented himself in such a manner uh to bring out certain truths to us that will straighten us and give us the foundations as we face the fury of satan in these last days may god bless us together as we go into this wonderful study of the titles and attributes of our lord jesus christ our scripture is found in revelation chapter 3 verse 14 and on to the angel of the church of ledicia of the ledecians right these things said the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god hallelujah loving heavenly father who is watching over us in tender care feed life luck we pray forgive me for any human weaknesses faults or failures in any way were in word thought or deed and let me not stand in your way lord but may your spirit help me and enable me to be able to step away from self and step into christ that you may be glorified this we ask in the name of our blessed lord jesus amen and amen praise god these things said the amen the and the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god what a wonderful description of the attributes of our lovely lord jesus christ when we uh say and read those things it wants to make me shout uh and jump and magnify the name of our blessed lord hallelujah so what do we see here in the word we discover that this is jesus christ himself giving a description of himself in relationship to this last leodison church age and let us remember that the days of grace are winding up much or many persons have been behaving acting in such a way as if to say grace will never come to an end it will always go on the door will be always open for us but nay my friends that is not so the days of grace came to an end in in the times of gnaw when the door was shut amen the days of grace came to an end in the time of lot when the angel said flee quickly run to the mountains amen oh my friends we are here again as it was in the days of noah as it was in the days of lot so is it in these days of the coming of the son of man on the face of the earth here we are living in prophecy living and walking in the midst of supernatural events that are now being made clear to us by the vindication fulfillment of prophecy in our day and in our time glory to god hallelujah so he reveals his characteristics to us in this last church age remember he has done this through every age because the evils committed by every age he had to project one part of his personality one part of his office into that that age to rebuke to correct that spirit of satan that was active in that age so that is how he raised up a standard against the works of satan in his day and time in ephesus he made himself known as he is the one who holds the seven stars within his hands and smyrna he made the people know that he was the one that liveth and was dead making them no no man has been dead and then come back living but now he's projecting himself presenting himself that i am the one i'm the only one that was dead and now living oh praise god in the age of pergamos he presented himself as he that hat the sharp sword the sword of god's word hallelujah sayatira he that hat eyes like a flame of fire he sees everything he knows everything for he is our great eternal god in sardis the god of the seven spirits now not seven stars but the seven spirits praise god hallelujah same seven spirits of god around the throne of god same seven spirits now he is showing that he is the one he is the one that was and is sitting on the throne who has sovereign control over the seven spirits of god in the age of philadelphia he presents and has presented and is presenting himself i am he that holds the key of david amen that just doesn't mean the key to natural david's treasure house but he holds the key to all revelation of the riches of the grace the mercies the pearl of great price the mysteries of god the revelation of himself hallelujah amen praise god and now in the age of leodisia now in this age where we come to the consummation of the ages when the world is dying amen truth it seems to be dying everything coming to its end but now he presents himself in this distinct oh praise god presentation of himself saying i am the amen i am the amen hallelujah now we're giving a final look at our glorious lord hallelujah and seeing him in his glorious and gracious supreme deity to all of these seven ages amen he is the in other words he is the capstone revelation amen passion revelation done through the ages right on down come to the seventh church age gr more revelation but still partial but we now walk into the perfect day we walk into the dawning of the great day star hallelujah rising upon us shining his glorious light upon us and our eyes being opened are beginning to see the things of god making themselves clear and manifest thus saith the amen jesus christ the amen of the living god he is the law so let it be of the living god for the word amen and they that uh title of amen means i am the finality this is the final revelation of himself it stands for approval just as if your boss came and said amen in other words that's a good job it's a perfect job it's final amen hallelujah it stands for prevailing promise and it stands for his unchanging promise and it stands for the seal of god upon it amen hallelujah in other words god stamps it puts his seal upon it and says he approves of the manifestation of jesus christ upon the earth every step every word fulfill the promise of god and god sets his seal upon it perfection of all perfection hallelujah oh how sweet how beautiful to see this hallelujah and so this is the end time revelation of himself for the day of grace is closing hallelujah the door may still be open hallelujah but the spirit of noah in the bride stands in the gap stands in the doorway she's still declaring the word of god for the hour still giving an opportunity still giving a space to repent but now we find that spirit of repentance is nowhere upon the people except for the faithful individual few that may still be here on the face of the earth that are waiting on the coming of the living god in the form of the rapture and resurrection before we go into tribulation oh thanks be to god for this marvelous hour and day in which we are living in indeed he is the jehovah of the old testament the god of the amen he is jesus of the new testament and he is telling you i am that same jehovah i am the amen hallelujah hero israel the lord thy god is one god there it is the jehovah of the old testament is the same jesus of the new testament hallelujah one and the same you see the new testament is not jesus here revealing another god but he is the further revelation of that god that was in the old testament making himself a further unveiling of himself a further revelation of himself casting light upon his person amen and the unfolding revelation of himself glory to glory to glory then back to the glory but now he is making himself known to us as the mighty children amen of god hallelujah amen rep the further revelation not of two gods but of one and the same god hallelujah because jesus christ christ did not come down here to just make himself known he always pointed to the father so he came to make us know the father not just to know him the flesh but to know the spirit that lived in him the father that indwelt him for it's the father that living in me that doeth the works and he wanted us to know the father by the witness of his life that he was bearing to the father or praise god forevermore hallelujah amen yes sir he never talked about no two gods he only spoke of one god hallelujah amen and now in these last days he is re-emphasizing that to us for many most have traveled away from that original revelation of god who he is and are believing the tales the lies all the f fanciful makeups of satan that's here on the face of the earth but he has returned to make himself known himself known by the opening of the word of god hallelujah so we have come right back to the capstone revelation hallelujah and the most important revelation of who is the godhead not three persons in the godhead but one person of that godhead and that one person carries many offices but he chose to emphasize three father son and holy spirit same god hallelujah just characteristics manifestations that he had to perform to fulfill his purpose and will upon the face of the earth hallelujah did not jesus say i and my father are one one and the same person one somebody says uh they're one in unity they're one in cooperation and john taught the same thing and he said lord show us the father listen to the answer have i not been long with you philip thus does not know me for it he was the father and the father was living in the son which is the body named jesus the father jehovah was living in the sun hallelujah who was given an earthly name called jesus but it was the same god one not two not three not four not many amen there's only one god and his name is the lord jesus christ amen we know in our day which we will just pass that over we we are surrounded by many false gods they're even making women into gods elevating them and talking about ascensions and all these things contrary to the word of god not even found within the economy of the living god hallelujah and to put down what i am saying they will first try to dismiss a person like me or many others like me uh either by oh he doesn't have degrees he he never went to the seminary he never uh or she or whoever it is they will try to destroy your credibility not realizing you're not worried about things like that you're just here to tell the truth then god will establish it whether it be the truth or expose it if it's not the truth i am only here as many others like myself is to speak god's truth regardless of whatever effects it may have hallelujah we care not for the things of this world whether we eat have to eat dry bread whether we are put on an island all by ourselves oh praise god even there on the isle of pacques we'll write another story of jesus christ our lord who came from glory and gave his life for us and place his spirit in us that we might testify that there is only one god and his name is jesus christ hallelujah he is the god of the amen he is the god that never changes whatever he does never changes whatever he says never changes ever amen so let it be he is the amen i'm so glad i serve a god like that who never changes never lies is a always true to his word praise god hallelujah amen amen hallelujah amen he is saying i am the amen because we live in a changing world people change their words break their contracts change their promises amen change their doctrines that change medical science varying sciences they're improving all the time and they're changing their books their thoughts their teachings but this one he is saying i am the amen i am the sovereign god i do not change i do not lie my heavens and earth will pass away but my words and promises will never pass away hallelujah he is saying all you have read in the bible all i have said to you will never change regardless of what lies satan tells you or suggests in your thoughts in your mind or in your teachings or doctrines telling you this or that i am the god that change at not he is saying i am the amen hallelujah and again he is saying on the other side concerning the condemnations the convictions the pronunciations about satan about the false vine trail of the serpent the sins in the garden of eden all of these things his trail his end in the burning lake of fire all these things i am god are chains not i am the amen what he says he is saying the evil that i've revealed to you started way back in heaven down in the garden of eden and traveled down through the ages that evil is still with us and working its way but it will come to an end at the lake of fire and death and hell are cast into the lake of fire but they what i'm saying about the evil of the two vines the two the twins in the beginning twins in the end two vines with their branches intertwined in genesis religion and carnality true faith and false faith god versus satan lie versus the truth branch is intertwined oh but here we come to an ending where it must come to a finality and he says i am the amen i'll put an end to it but what i've told you about this invasion of demonic spirits seducing spirits religious spirits doctrines of devils and demons seated in the very branches of the tree of religion unclean spirits spirit of devils the spirit of the evil torb spirits frog-like spirits looking backwards trying to go forwards all of it is that just saith the lord for i am the amen hallelujah praise god saying whatever is said to you in the first church age it stands true forever through all ages amen praise god hallelujah finishing up in revelation i am the great amen now you can see why satan hates the book of genesis and the book of revelation because he can run but he can't hide he can run from the eyes and minds of mortals but the amen shines the brightness of the light of his effulgent glory upon the face of the earth and upon satan and his actions and activities that he is still active on this earth moving deceiving lying cheating charming doing everything that he can to distract this destroy deny people away from the truth of god and his word and his redemptive power amen hallelujah so he hates this book of revelation this book of genesis then he hates revelation in the lives of this book for this hour the living epistles of god making known the word of god for the hour under the great anointing of the comforter the holy spirit of the living god amen yes sir he knows satan knows he's a creature and he's going to come to his end like a mass murderer who is condemned and no he can't escape condemnation before he is finally imprisoned and put to electrocuted or put to death he wants to steal kill and destroy as many as he can and that is what he is doing he know that he shall not prevail for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto us but the father which is in heaven has revealed this unto us and upon this rock of revelation that the church is built on the gates of hell the doors of hell hallelujah no denomination no lie no truth no error will prevail against the living revelations of the word of the living god hallelujah and we know it that's why we can go forth with boldness we can go forth with confidence as overcomers because it's already prophesied spoken by the amen in the word of god that we are overcomers overcome the world things of the world and we know we are on the winning side hallelujah we are on the winning team even if we look like we lose a skirmish here or a little skirmish there we know when we come to the end game we are on the winning sides and we will be the winner for it's already foretold in the very word of god or believer don't go by your feelings how you feel now or what you think now you may appear to be a loser you may you may even think of yourself as a loser what the word of god says you're a winner you're an overcomer you are one of his own praise god hallelujah amen listen to god's servant and prophet uh i we are overcomers i mean the believers of his word and only them are on the airmen's side hallelujah they elected are the only ones everyone whose ever will will hear the voice will hear the word but only the elected hallelujah are caught into the upper room the king's chamber only they with that revelation bathing down their soul hallelujah or in the amen side in other words he is trying to reassure us you're on the winning side no matter how dark it looks around you no matter how evil it seems around you no matter how many distractions around you remember you're on the winning side and i am the quarterback or the general of the entire team and there's none is going to win a battle against me who purpose all of this myself i who am the five-star general j-e-s-u-s and he's on the charge he's on the move he's about to wind up this battle hallelujah all the little scrimmages where some of us may be cut we may have been shot we may have been damaged in some way your credibility your person your life oh he is saying bear it all we're coming to the end of it and soon will be caught away into his everlasting eternal presence by the power of the living god hallelujah this thing said he not only the amen but these things said amen he that is faithful and true amen remember he's not only the unchanging god we have spoken of but i want you to understand friends that don't let satan blind you distract you or slow you down he's trying to give the suggestion or the impression that god was active in the days of the apostles and some of them back there but now we're coming to the end of the way the god who create the universe who saved your soul is starting to become impersonal he's starting to become unconcerned because after all it's coming to an end now so he's not paying attention to his great creation amen but god is not unconcerned god is not impersonal amen and the god we serve is not disinterested because he promised i will not leave you comfortless but i'll be with you i'll be even in you to the very end i'll be with you so you are never alone hallelujah and this god of the bible is not imprisoned in the bible pages and have to be freed or let out of the cage of the bible by theologians he is the word none can cage him none can keep him in a box of theology or teaching oh my the human mind so miniscule to the eternal god hallelujah who can hold him who can restrain him he said i have purpose who will withstand he will bring to pass every word that he has spoken and he never changes and he never never lies hallelujah friends we serve this great eternal spirit being this great jehovah god hallelujah we have never seen him with arise hallelujah but as much as our limited senses can get to know him from time to time we feel him we sense him his power his presence rests upon us and we recognize he is here with us every step of the way oh god standing in the shadows is always watching over his own praise god hallelujah as brother billy paul said that when the great angel of god came down and stepped into that hotel room and brother branham said billy uh just stay where you are don't move i'll ask him if he will allow you to see him and he went over spoke to the angel and the angel of god says yes amen and billy paul branham himself will testify that when he looked all he saw was a man standing there by the drapes that were in the room all blessed be the name of the living god whom we serve god is concerned over us he may be standing near the drapes he may be standing in the shadows but remember there's a great eye always watching over us and seeing everything that is taking place for he remains the eternal god hallelujah one day we will see him face to face and tell the story saved by grace we'll see him in the flesh making himself known to us that is for this age this seventh age of the edition that we are coming to an end of and it has ended and we know at the end of this age he makes himself known hallelujah in the brightness of his unfolding word and we know him and then he comes personally on the scenes oh then partial revelation this way to perfect realization glory to god complete realization amen hallelujah then we begin to understand that we have been looking through the glass of the word darkly amen seeing things but not seeing them clearly through seven church ages of presuming of wondering about this or that but now as we come to the closing of the doors of grace amen he is making himself clear to his beloved his one bride his people his children his many member body he is making himself clear and plain to her amen i'm so glad that we stand here in the glory of his word but we will see him in his great eternal wondrous glory and we shall be like him when we begin to see as he is this wonderful jesus our savior divine the mighty everlasting one that lives and reigns supreme and have some preeminence over his own house for he lives in us and he is he's the great son over his own house making himself manifest for the glory of god and we are complete in him and one day he will change the atoms of our bodies hallelujah amen and we will change or be transformed from mortal to immortality praise his name and be swallowed up in his life by his life followed up by the very revelation you have been being you have been believing hallelujah oh my then shall we as paul said then shall we know as we are known in other words you'll enter into perfect realization perfection of perfection of perfection hallelujah he is the faithful but listen the emphasis and true witness for all the things he has witnessed to us are true you know the word witness and the word martyr are just about the same where it speaks of stephen and antipas because there were true witnesses that were martyrs hallelujah everyone now by various groups around the world are calling this person a martyr that person a martyr they don't know who or what a true martyr is but this true martyr jesus christ he bore witness in his walk he bore witness by laying down his life and the very life he lived is the witness and proof of the truth and the fact that the holy spirit has returned upon the face of the earth is the very proof that his his the lamb of god jesus christ that sacrifice of the lamb was acceptable to god that is the reason why his life could come back on the sinner that's on the face of the earth come his life can come back in the form of the holy spirit on the sinner that's on the face of the earth hallelujah lord of god oh my listen let me give you some scriptures which you can read yourself john chapter 16 verses 7 to 11 amen or if i go not away the comforter will not come but if i depart i will send him unto you and when he is come hallelujah amen he will reprove the world of sin and righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of their unbelief they will be reproved of because they believe not on him unrighteousness and of judgment john 14 18 i will not leave you comfortless i will not leave you comfortless i will come unto you jesus and the holy spirit is the same person he was just telling them he'll change from being in the flesh going back to being in the spirit and come back to them hallelujah oh my hallelujah i will come to you amen praise god hallelujah he is the comforter he is the mighty one he came back in spirit upon his church in this last day and i'm so glad for the holy spirit his presence this supreme deity this sovereign god oh hallelujah this invisible one that walks with us talks with us with us in our midst wherever we are in your home right where you are he is there oh my when we gather together as an assembly he is there oh we don't see him with our eyes but we feel the pulsation the vibrations of the power of god within our hearts and we know he lives he lives forevermore praise god forevermore
