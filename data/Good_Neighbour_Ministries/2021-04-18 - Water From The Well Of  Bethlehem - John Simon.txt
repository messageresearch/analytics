========================================
[Music] praise the lord saints of the most high god it is indeed with joy we come to draw water from the well of salvation may the great holy spirit of almighty god refresh us to as we come today in the name of the lord to feed upon the word of god may god richly bless us together uh here we are together again in his presence thank god we give god the glory and the honor and the praise our our topic for today or the thought god would uh wants me to express is water from the well of bethlehem i repeat water from the well of bethlehem our scripture is found in ii samuel chapter 23 verses 13 to 17 shall we read you may open your bibles and we can read together i will read now from 2nd samuel chapter 23 reading from verse 13 to 17 and three of them mighty of the 30 uh chief went down and came to david in the harvest time unto the cave of adullam and the troop of the philistines pitched in the valley of rifahim and david was then in and hold and the garrison of the philistines was then in bethlehem and david longed and said oh that one would give me a drink of water of the will of bethlehem which is by the gate and the three mighty men break through the hosts of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the lord and he said be it far from me o lord that i should do this is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things that these three mighty men praise be to our god let us pray sweep by our head spirit of who we are whether in our homes whether in the a house of god whether in a field whether under a large tree in africa whether in a great uh uh high-rise building in singapore or somewhere among the brethren in hong kong wherever the believers are gathered africa india china nepal burma oh south america colombia oh blessed be the name of our god all the islands of the west indies from australia to new zealand and all down into fiji oh praise god may the great holy spirit spread out his great power of his divine self and manifest the word and declare himself among the nations that he might be glorified and crowned king of kings and lord of lords father this day may thy name be glorified may you receive all our praise all or the honor and all the glory as we commit ourselves into your hand for service in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen praise god water from the well of bethlehem now in the bible there are many mentions of wells several wells are mentioned four in particular i mentioned tonight today so that you may be familiar with them there is first of all the outstanding will of abraham then that is the well of course that was stopped up uh by the philistines and isaac had to uh dig out the rubbish and let the waters flow again oh then there is the well of nehor that is the well by which eliezer met rebecca and spoke to her about isaac then there of course is the well of bethlehem of which we shall speak of then there is jacob's will by which jesus met the woman of samaria it's very significant to me how that god would meet and deal with lots of believers in the bible by a well and so i believe that a well has great significance in the eyes and in the mind of god of course my brothers we are speaking about the will of bethlehem in connection with this story of david now david as you know was elected by god to be king of all israel saul was then popular among the people great in size his shoulders his reach his organ his organization or his body was was really big large powerful and of course being a king he was uh very wealthy and had lots of financial support he had lots of membership lots of soldiers that were there to carry out his will and here we find while he was apparently yet in power god had already anointed his replacement god had already anointed or elected david and then sent samuel to his father's house and his father called him so he was elected and he was called and while there samuel was able to identify and anoint david as king never mind his brothers were more handsome or they were taller or bigger in stature or even admired more by the people yet god chose david as simple and as humble a shepherd that he was but here we see david a fugitive in his own land because of the jealousy of saul the fear of this king and that's usually what happens to denominations whenever a real god set heaven set revival breaks out they become fearful they become jealous because they don't know what the holy spirit will do and they may lose soldiers or members they may lose people who will then recognize the evil of this man-made organization placed on the earth calling itself the church of god and so they get very angry and worked up assault was the bible said it was an evil spirit that entered into saul that caused him to act that way and i don't i don't think there's been a change i think it's the same thing it may be a religious one but it's still an angry evil spirit that gets upon the organization and causes the people to act that way so here was david a tape of christ who is the word of god and yet when he should be accepted in the house of god when the true word of god should be accepted in the kingdom of god we find that the word of god is rejected by the people and by especially the leaders think of it the word david the king jesus the messiah a fugitive among his own people came into his own and there received him not all but as many as received him that them gave he the power to become the sons and daughters of the living god amen so here was david my friends i believe it was a really hot day and david in the cave of adolem no doubt the sweat was pouring down from his body from his face he was thirsty and hot and there he was protected by three mighty men many others but the bible in particular mentions these three mighty men three mighty men in other words he had these three bodyguards or we may say three armor bearers around him and i believe every pastor needs to have mighty men around him trusted men around him loyal men around him oh yes god would have that had david protected by these mighty men oh praise god hallelujah amen and those men protected them physically and i believe god unless brother branham said a pastor his deacons his mighty men should be protecting him even naturally physically then that should protect him spiritually his reputation the things that are said about him were done around him there to protect him every in every possible way there was david sun shining down in the hot heat of the middle east there in the hills of judea as the bright shade sunshine came down with its blistering heat david was thirsty thirsty for water oh he needed to have a fresh drink of water and i believe every true seed of god will thirst for the moisture that comes from the spirit of god every true seed of god will thirst for the refreshing reigns of the holy spirit that only comes from the presence of almighty god only he can bring no bands no groups no amount of shouting singing running the floors that's good for your emotions that good for the release of your stress and your pressure but that will not refresh the soul of a true believer oh praise god amen brother sister the great holy spirit of almighty god in this day and in this hour wants his seed his children to thirst after him because every seed will have that thirst because in them and you know naturally for a seed to grow we you would place some water on it place it in the soil place some water on it and the water and the soil around it will cause it to germinate and sprout and begin to show the life that was in that seed that appeared dead your life your past you may have appeared dead even in a church yet you may appeared as if there was nothing much in you oh but you once let this water of la everlasting life the living waters of the holy spirit of almighty god strike your soul and the holy ghost amen will move within you wake up the seed that god planted in you the great sore went forth to sow and planted seeds upon the earth not the dirt but in you and me who is the earth of this hour and the spirit of god now waters it and causes it to come to life and to spring up into genuine everlasting life not church life not just religious life but the life of christ in you projecting itself making itself known that others may see him and come to know him in the power of his resurrection hallelujah and while david was in that cave with the sweat and the heat the itching is scratching upon him and he was thinking about that well down there in bethlehem and speaking to himself as we would say the english would say is in a solidify which means to say he's unconsciously speaking oh i i oh i wish i could have a drink of that fresh cool water down from the uh the well there at the gate of bethlehem hallelujah and while david was speaking to himself solely quizing not realizing that he could be heard overheard and it just came to pass that these mighty men overheard david's desire david did not command them david did not tell them david did not ask them but they overheard him he overheard the desire that he had in his heart to be able to drink fresh water from the well of bethlehem that is just similar to us praying or sitting or reading our scriptures and then all of a sudden we catch a revelation from the mind of god god doesn't didn't command you god didn't beg you god didn't do anything but the revelation strikes your soul you know what you must do it strikes your heart you know how you should obey praise the lord god amen oh it's those mighty men are types of believers who are walking in relationship with the word of god the word of god which is our king word our word which is god king god hallelujah and we walk in a relationship with him glory to god hallelujah amen yes sir praise god these were not just ordinary men claiming they're christian or claiming their believers these were men who mightily believed the word and held on to the word loyal to the word o faithful man praise god and these men were of such that they are named in the bible first of all there was a dino the s knight this man slew 800 men with his spear within his hand what a warrior a mighty man of god that would win souls to christ that would win hundreds thousands amen to jesus christ here it was he slew 800 philistines with his spear there was eliezer son of dodo he slew the philistines until his hands were so weary that he gripped the sword and fought with the philistines and when the fight was over he couldn't he could not open his hand to get the sword out because his hand had a grip upon that sword of course the sword is a type of the word of god when the true believer gets a grip of that word of god and the word of god is held in their hand of faith revelation they're using the word by revelation or by faith dear you're understanding the word by faith they're cutting the devil left right center disease sickness pain depression blood pressure just you're destroying the devil's kingdom oh praise god and he was able to defeat those philistines praise god hallelujah then there was shama son of aggie who slew a whole troop of philistines imagine an army troop of philistines came out and they were gonna rob the israelites of a field of lentils beans that they had planted and they began to run away when they saw the philistines and shama stood there and dared them to come and they came down and the bible tells us he destroyed the entire troop of philistines with the spear that which was within his hands we give god the glory hallelujah so there was david filled with frustration walking back and forth within that cave oh what a hot day sweat pouring down his brow and saul may even come this way along with the philistines not only do i have the sinners against me not do i only have the unbeliever philistines against me but there is you know saul type of the denominational religious believer who should really be for me who should really say i don't understand what you're doing but brother sister will support you will will will stand by no he david was afraid of being attacked at the same time by saul on one hand and by the philistines on the other hand and that's where the true believer find themselves in this hour but we are not afraid but we hold the sword of the word of god and hold to god's unchanging hand and chop the head of the devils off right left center this way that way we hold to god's eternal word and press the battle air the night will veil the growing skies amen hallelujah amen praise god oh he said i want to get some of that fresh water from the gates of bethlehem's well there's no water like that water david did not just want any water but he wanted the specific water cool refreshing water that comes from the well of bethlehem well you know bethlehem was the center the water where they can get water it was also the bread center which we will touch on that later on for bethlehem means god's house of bread house of bread it was a provincial center of water and of wheat and other grains but in palestine there's known to be some bad water not all the word of god you hear preached is good for you some may be using that word for their own purposes but in palestine there is some bad water evil waters within that place if you drink it you may end up have a black water fever and you start to groan and you start to jump and move because you got some kind of a black water fever got a hold of you all kinds of stuff in that kind of water and a lot of that water can even kill you if you drink too much of it it may want to tend to kill you david in the mouth of that cave looking down in the valley and let me say i've actually been there and seen from where those three mighty men had to fight their way over the mountains and go down on the other side to bethlehem draw the water and fight their way and come all the way back to where david was and it is said that the distance was 18 miles they chopped their way they used the spear they used the sword in every possible way and fought their way back to back hallelujah through those demons through the philistines and they chopped their way for 80 miles into the city of bethlehem to go and get some fresh water from the well of bethlehem to bring it for david hallelujah go brothers and sisters think of it think of what kind of a battle and remember this the philistines knew they were coming and when they were coming back the philistines had time to prepare for them to attack them when they were coming back but they went got the water and came back with it without spilling it and they destroyed all of those philistines that stand in their way let me tell you this word of god is true one will chase a thousand two will change ten thousand if people are united if the sons and daughters of the living god are united as one we can tear down the walls of jericho we can break chase out those devils out of our homes out of our houses out of our places of worship out of our hearts praise god we have the authority we have the power amen we have this word that's been revealed to us in this day and in this hour blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah amen praise god and while david was within the front of the cave he was just thinking of those mornings when he would take his sheep and take them to the well of bethlehem and it was a great place for water where he could take his sheep to get fresh water and i believe my brothers and sisters that's exactly where god is taking us and where god wants us to be is to come and drink fresh word fresh water in this hour in god's bethlehem or house of bread of today that we might feed upon him feast upon him and drink in drinking life within you drinking the refreshing waters of the word of the living god hallelujah glory to god oh i wonder if we have some warriors listening to me here today i'm wondering if god has warriors in this modern age that are willing to pick up the sword and chop the head of the devil off chop off your sickness chop your pain stab the works of the devil cast him out from every scene glory to god hallelujah i wonder if god has some wonderful warriors male or female whoever they are oh praise god do you remember that that sister particular name was deborah that took a nail and killed a general with it lord of god hallelujah amen we know even in history there were some warrior queens that god used them for his glory and honor not to go out and take the place of preaching the word as such but testifying telling the goodness of jesus telling of their deliverance talking to god telling the people how good god is how mighty he is telling what a glorious thing to have the lord within your life moving in a special way hallelujah amen amen amen praise god i tell you i wonder if we've got warriors or we got a whole bunch of warriors amen instead of we having people that are praying we have people looking for their pillows oh praise god we're looking god wants real preachers of the world god wants real prophets of the word the word prophet really means preacher oh my praise god listen people god wants those wants men like that but instead what do we have today we have profiteers oh my god god didn't ask us to be profiteers he called us to preach the word of god without fear without favor without partiality but speak the truth in love amen praise god hallelujah you can say anything to anyone but it's how you say it and the heart with which you're saying it they will recognize unconsciously that you are speaking from a heart full of the love and the grace of god hallelujah amen i wonder if there's warriors in africa i wonder if they're warriors in india china if they're warriors in the islands of the sea in europe warriors amen some of them i'm thinking of them i know some by name real warriors of god that the devil would quake in his boots to meet with them face to face because they're standing upon the word of god for this day for this hour oh hallelujah they are going through they're going through they don't care what others do they're holding to the word of god and pressing the battle for the for his name oh praise god amen they are willing these men were willing to make david's desire their command one revelation from god becomes your command becomes the thing that moves your heart and moves your soul that don't mean nothing to the real believer because the now absent from the body present with the lord hallelujah they're not looking for popularity they don't need popularity they don't just need the approval of their lord and master they just need the smile of their king from his throne they don't need the popularity and even all the so-called prosperity of man even though god will give you that as you walk with him and trust him don't mean anything hallelujah god wants warriors that will stand by his side or will stand by the word amen right alongside it no matter what names they call you let them call you brandon knight let them call you count let them call you this or that whatever names they want to call you oh let them call you crazy let them call you yo you're out of your mind let them tell you oh you're crossed up no i'm not a beaten to the cross oh you're a fanatic oh that's right i am a fanatic because i've been to the upper room the attic and i got a hold of the old time holy spirit and the devil won't go near it that's the reason people fear it and that's good enough for me blessed be the name of the lord jesus hallelujah the scandal lies your name they say all kinds of things about you amen they even walk up to you someone a spit in your face or spit on you or eve even kick you amen hallelujah i've had them point at me and say there was the serpent seed man oh my oh yes brother sister oh but i'm still standing i'm here praise god i'm sure you heard about it the last man standing i'm sure i'm not the last but i'm still here and many of those have gone by the side of the way hallelujah oh it doesn't matter but my desire his desire is my command and that is a real soldier of the lord jesus christ hallelujah now notice israel when they left egypt they were receiving not stale bread not stale water but they were receiving fresh bread every night was coming down from heaven for their journey thank god that god gives us journey cakes for our journey to the promised land and christ is our bread of life he is our journey cake for this journey from art to glory hallelujah with his leading every day we're receiving fresh word fresh anointing fresh chilled mango fresh killed food from the presence of almighty god the holy spirit coming down upon us every day in our prayer life in our private times with god the blessed holy spirit rested upon our lives in this day and in this hour in the church we come together to praise god hallelujah we didn't come to play church when we come to pray in the church and to let the glory come down that we might lift up holy hands without wrath and without doubting and give glory and honor and praise to his high and holy name o blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah praise god yes friends we need fresh revelation every day fresh experience with god every day many people want to live off of their yesterday experience oh i i got saved in 1940 1951 i remember the day november the so and so in 19 so and so i got saved well the true believer now knows that that was pentecostal teaching though that was sincere that is not the word for you don't get eternal life on a certain day for eternal means without the beginning and without an end which means that if you're a child a real elected seed child of god now you had always had eternal life in the mind of god but it is only now being revealed to you that you might recognize it this is why jesus said peter flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father in heaven has revealed this unto you and upon this rock of revelation amen i will build my church amen and the gates of hell will not prevail against the true revelated church of the living god that lives and moves and breeds the holy spirit in everything that they do for the glory of god hallelujah i tell you genomic national experience won't do yesterday's experience won't do and that's the matter with all these denominations they're living off the experience of their founders oh we we come from john wesley you see he was this and he was that that's good that's wonderful oh we are we're from luta he was even greater he had this and he had that and then we from dwight moody and we we had this looking backwards like a frog you know frogs jump forward while looking backwards but i'm telling you i'd advise you to look where you're going amen praise god let me tell you finney sankey knox calvin great man of god but that was their experience and now in this hour brother branham came on the scene left us a message and instead of making that message live fresh anointed word a fresh spirit of god flowing full and free rivers of the holy ghost amen oh they're looking back just on the ministry of brother branham not that it's bad for us to know the things that happened in his life not that it is bad to know of his experiences miracles signs wonders and the supernatural but god wants you to walk into the holy spirit and to experience him for yourself amen as i use the statement that i have said many a time you cannot sell your ship on yesterday's breeze that will be in your mind you got to have fresh winds bright fresh wind of the holy spirit blowing through the building blowing through your life going through your home blowing through your heart hallelujah fresh journey cake fresh journey water oh praise god hallelujah drink and live amen hallelujah oh my god living on the extreme experience of some great giant of the past that's fine god bless them and god will reward them but it's your time this is your time now is your time this is your day this is your hour god is calling upon you to fulfill his word and you are the ones that are here you are the people this is the moment praise god and we have received the word to meet the challenge of the hour may the great holy spirit make what i'm saying beyond what i'm saying reveal to you make known to you what he is trying to convey into your heart and into your life hallelujah remember some of those israelites when the fresh miraculous bread fell amen you know like a souza street that was miraculous bread that was supernatural refreshing rain water from the presence of god coming down in the original in the early pentecost that was fresh bread and fresh water coming down upon his people but you know what god says don't keep it overnight you got to have fresh every day every day every day oh but you know what some of them got the bread and trying to keep that bread over for the next day the next age the next time they tried to keep some of that fresh water from the ever-present water that came from the rock that followed them in the wilderness because they started oh suppose the rocks stop gushing out more revelation suppose the rocks stop sending water suppose the bread stop coming from heaven come on boys let's let's collect some bread and let's lock it up here let's get some of that water put it in a cistern over here and let's keep that water and preserve it and defend the fate as far as we know we must keep it and then when they put it in the cistern they put a brand on it when they put it in their bread basket they put a name on it this is this is baptist bread this is this is pilgrim holiness bread this is church of god bread this is a church of god in christ no no you guys call yourself that but we are new testament church of god in christ and so on and we are we are of the sabbath and mother said oh we are jehovah's witnesses everybody is trying to brand their franchises and to give them a little bit out of that bread that they try to store up and the water that they're trying to store up there but you know that's the same problem we have today they tried to store up portions of the word of god store up some of the living waters of the word of god and their cisterns start to get contaminated and when you try to live on bread that you kept too long starts to get moldy start to oh friend contaminated with all kinds of things amen but i want you to tell you my brothers and sisters what a thing for us to know and i will speak about this and touch on it next week the difference between a well and a cistern of how god doesn't use cisterns but god likes to use wells for his glory and that's why abraham he showed him where to dig a well and that is why eliezer tell him go sit by the well you're going to meet rebecca there he tells the other one amen praise god david desiring go down to the well of bethlehem jesus sat by the world waiting on the woman of samaria as he is waiting on you as he is waiting to hear your answer to his call and to his cry that he same holy spirit the same living god and i say living god because god isn't dead god is not somewhere in the past amen that same god is right here that's able to move in the house of god move in the hearts of the people of god move in the lines of his children to show that he is not dead but he is alive amen the winds of god can still move the mulberry bushes hallelujah the wind of god can still make the bushes burn in the fire in the bush and still the bush is not burned down glory to god the holy spirit can take a hold of your life and work within it and yet you remain may remain a healthy happy human being walking in the light of this day and of this hour hallelujah praise god we must receive something fresh from the presence of our god we must receive fresh word not the word for yesterday but the word for today for this day and for this hour hallelujah and christ is our freshness he is the bread from heaven whichever man or a woman eat a man they'll live forever praise god he is the he is our bethlehem so we must come to him to receive a drink if you want a fresh drink of this old-fashioned goth spell this holy spirit gospel out of the word of god if you really desire it wanting it hallelujah then you must come to christ if you're a believer talk to him in it in your heart oh lord refresh me revive my soul again anoint me lord invigorate me give me the vitality and the power to lead flee live your word father god hallelujah he is our bethlehem he is god's house of eternal bread to every one of us praise god he is the bread of eternal life glory to god amen natural bread we call that the staff of life recall that my friends the staff of life and we know jesus is god's staff of our life glory to god hallelujah he is our cake for the journey water praise god hallelujah here's our water for the journey water gushing from the smitten rock smitten in the wilderness type of christ who would be smart later on and the blood and water flowing from his side all glory to god hallelujah so he is bred for the journey he is walked for the journey hallelujah bread from heaven water from the smitten rock oh my praise god you're walking in the power of the holy spirit you're walking in the in an anointing of the blessed one praise god hallelujah it will sustain your life in this journey from art to glory none else can keep you for there is no real safety zone whether from bombs from cobalt bombs or from kovid there is no real safety zone except in jesus christ that is not to say that you just go out there and say oh i'm a believer i'm not gonna take any uh i'm not gonna take any kind of injection nonsense because god told one of the prophets go there make a poultice and put it on that boil you know he told one prophet not to pray use the medicine use the medicine and so he told the prophet to place the medicine and the king was healed lord of god all healing is of god spiritual healing and natural healing praise the lord so if you need to take it i've got my vaccination already i'm waiting for the second dose but if you can get it get it as soon as you can that's natural protection then above that you got supernatural protection hallelujah where the holy ghost the spirit of god says if you drink any deadly thing or any deadly thing is put in your body it shall not hurt you that's the word of god if you're a believer may hurt the sinner over there is that but a real believer it will not hurt you so take it as soon as you can for the glory of god don't know how i got on that but maybe god wanted me to say that so i'm saying it amen praise god hallelujah amen praise god friends we bypass on creeds as believers we walk past all these church dogmas creeds and fundamentals and so on because we don't want to be drinking stagnated water from the past uh i may put it in a way that may it kind of you know causes you to think differently we are not here to drink dead man's water or let me put it a little better dead water we are not here to do that we are here to drink fresh cool nice water from the well of bethlehem lord of god what we need today to get that kind of a fresh water is an uh an opening of the word so that the spirit of god can gush out flew out upon the lives of his people oh praise god oh glory to god there i was david said in the book of psalms amen hungry and thirsty my soul fainted within me there i was in a dry and thirsty land where no water where no water was oh but i longed to see thy power and thy glory that i might praise you and glorify you in the midst of the sanctuary oh glory to god hallelujah amen brother sister let me tell you he cannot fail for his god he cannot fail he keeps his word he cannot fail for he is god he cannot fail he keeps his word he cannot fail to see you through he cannot fail he'll end you hallelujah they can call the brother branham telepathy hypnotism they can call it all kind of spiritualist they can call the holy ghost call it a devil call him all kinds of names or praise god but as long as the word is flowing and
