[3:13] GL to God hallelujah you talk about a
[3:16] masterpiece amen praise be to God that
[3:19] great wonderful work of art was nothing
[3:22] but a mystery that was covered up until
[3:25] we got the unveiling of the Mighty God
[3:29] the rec
[3:30] that I am identifyed with Christ and I
[3:33] am a part of him now being
[3:37] revealed glory to God hallelujah thanks
[3:40] be to God what a wonderful invitation in
[3:44] Ephesians 2 verse S amen that in the
[3:47] ages to come he might show the exceeding
[3:51] Riches of his grace in his kindness
[3:54] towards us amen through Jesus Christ
[3:59] hallelujah oh my in the ages to come
[4:04] that he will show us off as examples of
[4:09] trophies of His Marvelous Grace amen
[4:13] praise God now you say brother Simon
[4:15] what is
[4:16] Grace Grace is God's unmerited favor yes
[4:21] in other words there is nothing that you
[4:24] did to marry
[4:26] nothing it's just as if you were at home
[4:30] and Bill Gates or Warren
[4:33] Buffett uh you know maybe they're
[4:35] reading the newspaper or or or something
[4:38] and something struck them about your
[4:40] name or about you you say you know
[4:43] what I I want to do something for that
[4:46] guy or that
[4:47] woman and the next thing you
[4:49] know somebody knocks on your
[4:52] door and there you are so here's a I've
[4:56] been sent by Mr Warren Buffett and
[4:58] here's the check he said sent you a
[5:00] check for $10 million which is like
[5:02] pocket change for
[5:07] him1
[5:10] million praise the
[5:12] Lord that should be the reaction that
[5:15] you receive it but that is not for you
[5:17] to say oh it's too it's too good to be
[5:20] true I can't take it it's too much I
[5:23] don't believe
[5:25] it this is like a brother that we knew
[5:31] became a preacher in the United States
[5:33] but back then in the Old Country he was
[5:35] very very poor preaching one God and
[5:38] baptism in Jesus
[5:40] name and there was no milk in the house
[5:43] and he has these wife have these babies
[5:46] they're squalling they're hungry no
[5:48] money and that night we prayed and asked
[5:51] God father if you could just send us
[5:54] some milk you know even if even if we
[5:58] don't get bread already else just send
[6:00] us some milk just I need just one can of
[6:03] milk or whatever the next morning around
[6:06] about 5:30 Bang Bang Bang on his
[6:10] door he opens the door there's an old
[6:12] sister she says brother I was you know I
[6:15] was W woken up this morning early by the
[6:17] Holy Spirit and told me to get uh this
[6:20] milk here to you by this time and that's
[6:23] the reason why I'm here amen and he says
[6:26] oh praise God hallelujah he says and
[6:30] when he looks he sees she have he said
[6:32] take it back sister take it back I only
[6:33] asked for
[6:36] one because she had a whole
[6:39] box it's too much it's too good to be
[6:43] true it's too wonderful to believe and
[6:46] that's the grace of God that God so
[6:48] loved the world that he gave his only
[6:51] begotten son that whosoever believeing
[6:54] in him should not perish but should have
[6:56] everlasting
[6:58] life glory to
[7:03] God and there are people in this world
[7:05] that thinks it's too good to be true it
[7:08] couldn't happen it's just a story and
[7:11] they don't want to believe it amen think
[7:14] about God giving himself to for us to
[7:18] extend his grace to us and make us his
[7:21] child and now he's trying to call us
[7:25] he's trying to bring us into his
[7:27] wonderful love and Grace at this
[7:30] particular time amen listen I'm jumping
[7:33] over stuff here because time is going
[7:35] away and now the next one is say this
[7:37] after me I am Priceless I am say it
[7:42] again I am
[7:46] Priceless hallelujah praise the Lord

[7:52] there now for by grace are you save
[7:55] through
[7:57] faith and that not of yourselves it is
[8:00] the gift of God not works lest any man
[8:05] should boast salvation is what a free
[8:09] gift not from water bucket but from
[8:12] God I said it's a free gift from God
[8:17] glory to his wonderful name and you
[8:19] could not possibly purchase it you
[8:22] couldn't buy it because why it is
[8:26] priceless the Bible says Peter said we
[8:29] were not redeemed with silver and with
[8:32] gold but with the Precious Blood of the
[8:37] Lord Jesus Christ oh love to sing the

[9:21] lot of things we have a heart that
