[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] once again
[0:15] good evening friends it's good to be
[0:18] here with you again
[0:21] i would like to
[0:24] touch on this lesson
[0:27] and using for this part of this church
[0:31] age
[0:32] the topic of your
[0:35] heavenly father knows
[0:38] your heavenly father knows
[0:42] and i would like to touch
[0:45] on that but before we do
[0:49] shall we read out of the scriptures
[0:53] revelation chapter 2
[0:57] verse 9 i know
[1:00] thy works and tribulation and
[1:03] poverty but the word rich
[1:07] and i know the blasphemy
[1:10] of them which say they are
[1:14] jews and are not
[1:17] but are of the synagogue
[1:20] of satan let us pray
[1:24] our gracious heavenly father we
[1:27] thank thee for the reading of the word
[1:31] we thank you for all these gathered
[1:34] around waiting to
[1:38] receive the anointed word of god for the
[1:42] hour
[1:44] may the great holy spirit
[1:47] take these words and place them
[1:51] in the hearts of your own
[1:55] deposit these truths oh god
[1:59] take glory and honor and my
[2:02] may your name be magnified and glorified
[2:07] for we ask it in the name of jesus
[2:10] christ our lord
[2:12] amen yes friends
[2:16] the scripture clearly says
[2:19] i know thy works
[2:23] and thy tribulation and
[2:26] poverty but thou art
[2:29] rich truly there is
[2:33] a a thinking a form of
[2:36] thinking of many people
[2:40] that if they are when they become
[2:43] a christian their troubles
[2:47] and their great joys begin
[2:51] but i'm here to tell you that friends
[2:55] when you are born again
[2:58] or really received the holy ghost
[3:02] that is when another form of
[3:05] troubles begin your spiritual
[3:08] troubles begin and that
[3:11] comes into your natural life also
[3:16] where troubles trials
[3:20] tribulations temptations
[3:23] they increase because now
[3:27] that you recognize that you are a
[3:30] child of the king of god
[3:34] satan then places you
[3:37] as a target you were not maybe a
[3:41] direct target before but now
[3:45] you have become one of his targets
[3:49] now we are speaking on the church age of
[3:52] smyrna
[3:53] continuing and the key to this
[3:57] age is
[4:00] tribulation to recognize
[4:04] that all christians will
[4:07] suffer some form of tribulation
[4:12] for if there was tribulation in the
[4:14] first age
[4:16] it intensifies in the second age
[4:20] and tribulation continues on true
[4:24] and its application is to
[4:27] every christian every
[4:30] church age and every believer
[4:34] that puts their trust in god
[4:37] and identifies themselves
[4:41] with christ they will bear the
[4:44] same persecutions as he
[4:48] himself bore listen hebrews
[4:51] chapter 10 verses 32 to 38.
[4:56] we have these words from paul
[5:00] that applies to us the mass of
[5:03] christians
[5:04] believers through all the ages but
[5:07] call to remembrance the
[5:10] former days in which
[5:14] listen after that you were
[5:18] illuminated after that you had received
[5:22] revelation after that your eyes
[5:25] were opened after that your ears
[5:29] began to recognize the voice of the
[5:32] spirit of god
[5:34] speaking to you and opening up the book
[5:37] of life
[5:38] uh to you you endured
[5:43] a great fight of afflictions
[5:48] paul is saying after the word is
[5:50] revealed to you
[5:52] you're going to have to fight these
[5:56] trials and these tribulations
[5:58] these testings and provings that
[6:01] satan is going to bring against you
[6:06] partly which also you are made a
[6:10] gazing stock uh both
[6:13] by reproaches and afflictions you see
[6:17] you become a real true genuine
[6:20] believer that recognizes
[6:24] who you are recognizes your position
[6:28] and when satan knows that you
[6:32] really do know who you are
[6:35] who your father is where you come from
[6:39] oh and where you're going back to
[6:42] your rightful position then
[6:45] satan opens up and
[6:48] throws all of his guns
[6:52] against you and makes you into a
[6:55] target and makes you into a mocking
[6:59] stock
[7:01] laughing stock maybe of your own family
[7:04] your own friends
[7:05] that once just loved you adored you
[7:09] and uh you know uh appreciated you
[7:12] and now you have become a mocking stock
[7:16] you have become a laughing stuck in
[7:18] their eyes
[7:20] and when you are not around you are
[7:23] just a butt of jokes they make
[7:27] fun of you and everything else
[7:30] but it's not really must recognize this
[7:33] to ease the pain
[7:35] on you recognize that it's not
[7:38] really you as a person but it's the same
[7:42] old devil that's coming against the
[7:46] christ that is in you
[7:49] for jesus christ lives in you and
[7:52] satan still goes against him
[7:55] and it's really him in you
[7:58] that satan is criticizing him
[8:02] in every possible way
[8:06] praise god but we are encouraged by the
[8:09] lord
[8:10] for many become discouraged year after
[8:13] year
[8:13] month after month week after week a
[8:16] constant dripping and drabbing
[8:18] of of tribulation and trial upon their
[8:22] lives
[8:23] and then they may not take it any longer
[8:26] like some of the israelites they became
[8:29] come
[8:30] weary of the journey and then they began
[8:33] to faint
[8:35] uh or fade away by the sight of the way
[8:38] no but god encourages us
[8:42] and says to us all child of mine
[8:46] cast not away therefore your
[8:49] confidence which has great
[8:53] recompense of reward don't cast away
[8:56] your
[8:57] confidence don't cast away your lifeline
[9:01] don't cast away your hopes because
[9:05] listen great rewards await you
[9:08] there is great recompense for
[9:11] what you are passing through now and
[9:15] many of
[9:15] us may be going through some trials
[9:19] right now while i'm yet speaking
[9:22] trials going through bitter problems
[9:26] bitter uh temptations bitter trials
[9:30] that you are passing through right now
[9:33] at this very time listen
[9:36] for you have need of patience
[9:41] that after you have done the will of god
[9:44] you might receive the promise
[9:48] for yet a little while and he
[9:51] that shall come will come
[9:54] and will not tarry now that
[9:58] just shall lift the just shall live
[10:01] by faith that just shall live
[10:04] by revelation but if any man
[10:08] draw back my soul shall
[10:11] not have pleasure in him
[10:14] oh my god looks and looks at the
[10:17] backslider
[10:19] god looks at the one that walks away
[10:23] from the word of god and says my
[10:26] soul shall have no pleasure in him
[10:29] o praise god hallelujah let us
[10:33] also remember all those that will
[10:35] associate with
[10:36] us because my friends
[10:40] just to associate with us just to show
[10:43] us kindness
[10:44] many of those will suffer also
[10:48] trial and tribulation and and
[10:51] this is why we must be sympathetic and
[10:54] understand
[10:55] why some will stay away from us
[10:59] keep away from us because they can
[11:02] sense and see some of the trials
[11:05] tribulations that you're going through
[11:08] seems to come off on them and and they
[11:11] don't want it or they don't have the
[11:14] backbone and spine
[11:16] they don't have the anchor of the word
[11:19] of god in them to hold them
[11:22] and so they get away from it to free
[11:25] themselves
[11:26] from that kind of a trials
[11:29] it is the lord god almighty who is
[11:32] speaking
[11:34] he is the great spirit of life who is
[11:37] speaking
[11:39] he says i know
[11:43] the almighty the all-knowing one
[11:47] the omnipotent the all-seeing one
[11:50] he says i know
[11:54] here he is walking up and down
[11:58] in the midst of the seven golden
[12:00] candlesticks
[12:01] type of the seven church ages
[12:05] here he is the great shepherd
[12:08] of the sheepfold walking
[12:11] up and down oh praise god
[12:15] looking in love and in care for his
[12:19] people
[12:20] and the question is asked
[12:24] why does he not hold back the
[12:26] tribulation and persecution
[12:30] why does he not stop our trials
[12:34] and troubles that we go true
[12:38] my friends but the fact is no he does
[12:41] not
[12:43] he simply says i know your
[12:46] tribulation the true believer
[12:50] listening that and hearing
[12:53] recognizing the tones of the voice of
[12:56] the spirit
[12:58] in that kid recognizes love
[13:01] and his watchful care
[13:05] he is saying i am not unmindful
[13:08] of your suffering now you know
[13:12] many will ask the question
[13:15] with this sickness with this affliction
[13:18] with this need with this trial
[13:22] with this kind of poverty and pressure
[13:26] that i am going through why doesn't god
[13:31] do something or if a loved one passes on
[13:36] a loved one my friend succumbs uh
[13:39] to the spirit of death
[13:42] why did god take my brother why did god
[13:45] take my father why did god do this why
[13:49] did god
[13:49] do that and the question is always
[13:53] asked why did god amen
[13:57] and this my friends is a great stumbling
[14:00] block to very many people
[14:03] who claim to be believers and christians
[14:07] for the first thing that comes to their
[14:09] mind
[14:10] is why did god do this
[14:13] not with not why did satan test me why
[14:16] did satan try me
[14:18] why did satan tempt me but their their
[14:20] thought goes to
[14:22] why did god every tragedy in the world
[14:26] every hurricane every earthquake
[14:30] mankind is quickly to ask and say oh it
[14:33] was an act of god
[14:35] they don't stop to think which god
[14:38] the god almighty or the god of this evil
[14:41] age
[14:43] satan who sends these things and
[14:46] works behind them upon the face
[14:49] of the earth now recognize clearly
[14:55] that god in the shadows
[14:58] looks upon you and i and he watches
[15:02] over his own you say he watches
[15:05] but i'm going through pressure i'm going
[15:07] through trial
[15:08] i'm going tribulation i'm getting all
[15:11] these chests
[15:12] and yet god stands in the shadows
[15:16] and he watches over his own
[15:21] malachi 1 1-3
[15:24] the burden of the word of the lord to
[15:26] israel
[15:28] by malachi i have loved you
[15:32] saith the lord yet you
[15:35] ask you say wherein hast thou
[15:39] loved us was not esau
[15:42] jacob's brother said the lord
[15:46] yet i loved jacob
[15:49] and hated esau
[15:52] and laid his mountains and his heritage
[15:56] waste for the dragons of the wilderness
[16:00] you see we as human beings can't
[16:04] figure out god's love for here is one
[16:07] brother
[16:08] looking like a caring loving uh
[16:11] gentleman a hard worker and here is the
[16:14] other brothers
[16:15] apparently looks like a renegade a
[16:17] trickster
[16:18] uh you know a mother's boy a poor boy
[16:23] and yet god says i love that renegade i
[16:26] love that unruly one
[16:29] and this one that looks like a polished
[16:33] up christian looks like a a real
[16:37] gentleman looks so filial looks so
[16:40] uh you know fatherly and loves his
[16:43] father and
[16:44] cared for his father he says i hit that
[16:47] one
[16:48] and you see we cannot figure out god's
[16:51] love
[16:53] you see because we human beings
[16:57] thinks that love means no suffering
[17:00] love means no denial no
[17:03] trial not troubles and constant
[17:07] deliverance
[17:08] and constant miracles all the time
[17:11] this is what we have been brought to
[17:14] believe
[17:15] not recognizing that god's love
[17:19] is a different love my friends
[17:22] amen for we know that god's love
[17:26] is an elective love his
[17:29] love is shown to you not by the things
[17:33] he gives you
[17:35] but that the fact that he elected you
[17:39] to be in the beloved to be amongst the
[17:42] little flock
[17:44] to be part of that few
[17:49] to whom he is coming back to and
[17:52] for to take away with him
[17:55] to his father's house so god's
[17:58] love is an elective love
[18:03] the proof of his love to you is that he
[18:07] has elected you
[18:10] to eternal life
[18:13] life eternal endless life
[18:17] forever and ever and ever and ever
[18:21] into all the aeons
[18:24] all the ages and ages that endlessly
[18:28] roll on my friends
[18:33] will we not suffer
[18:36] one moment to have an eternity
[18:40] of endless life this is the love of god
[18:44] made manifest so no matter what happens
[18:48] to us
[18:49] in this life no matter what trials we go
[18:53] through
[18:53] in this life what is a hundred years to
[18:56] endless eternal life what is
[19:00] what is our short brief a time upon the
[19:03] earth
[19:04] uh in relation to having
[19:07] life eternal and to eat from that great
[19:11] tree of life
[19:12] and drink from the river of life and
[19:16] eat the fruits from the tree and give
[19:19] glory and praise to god
[19:21] knowing that he has called us and
[19:24] elected
[19:24] us to this love and gifted us
[19:28] with the gift of eternal life through
[19:31] jesus christ our lord
[19:33] chosen
[19:36] predestinated unto salvation
[19:41] because god has chosen us
[19:45] to salvation and sanctification
[19:48] of the holy spirit by the believing
[19:52] of the truth thank god praise god
[19:57] and within that
[20:01] that kind of view
[20:04] and vision if you can recognize it
[20:07] then he is sovereign he is our lord
[20:12] and he can commit us and command us
[20:16] to walk right into the fires of death
[20:20] he can anoint us to walk
[20:24] right in to the roman
[20:27] forums walk into
[20:31] the very mouth of the lion's mouth
[20:36] or into a fiery furnace
[20:39] he can lead us that way by his holy
[20:43] spirit
[20:44] and the true believer oh yes
[20:48] they know within their hearts that even
[20:51] though
[20:52] they are passing through they may go
[20:54] through these things
[20:56] that this is god showing his confidence
[21:00] in us
[21:01] this is god expressing his love to us
[21:05] that he trusts us that no matter
[21:08] what we go through like job we
[21:12] will not curse him we will not
[21:15] walk away from the truth we will not
[21:18] deny his word
[21:19] we will not do these things but we will
[21:23] bear the reproach for the world and
[21:26] never be ashamed of him
[21:28] and stand upon the promises until the
[21:32] crown
[21:32] regain hallelujah amen
[21:36] he might commit us to death like paul
[21:40] he may commit us to suffer
[21:43] like job and friends all these
[21:47] things for is for him to use
[21:51] fine people that he can trust
[21:54] and that he can use to show to the
[21:57] entire world
[21:59] here there is a son a daughter
[22:03] of god here is a child of god
[22:07] amen and you become the testimony
[22:11] of jesus christ while these ones are
[22:14] looking on
[22:15] you are singing you are singing
[22:19] songs in the night as the psalmist says
[22:23] he giveth me songs in the night yes
[22:27] you may be going through night time you
[22:30] may have to pass through
[22:31] leo this year but while you're going
[22:34] through the darkness of night
[22:36] you give it you songs in the night
[22:39] for the things he reveals to you and
[22:42] makes known to you
[22:44] causes you to sing as you're going along
[22:47] god wants this world to recognize
[22:51] they are without excuse for
[22:54] here are a few selected elected
[22:59] that can still live godly
[23:02] in the midst of sodomite conditions
[23:05] in the midst of babylon they can live
[23:09] godly o praise god forevermore
[23:12] he is showing forth his might he is
[23:15] showing forth his
[23:17] power he is showing forth his life
[23:20] he is showing forth their power to
[23:23] overcome
[23:24] in the midst of the most uh worst
[23:28] tribulation trial circumstances
[23:31] that the devil can throw against you and
[23:34] yet you can say i am an
[23:38] overcomer yet you can say
[23:42] i am a child of the king
[23:45] yet you can say i am more than a
[23:48] conqueror
[23:50] through him that love me praise
[23:53] god forevermore we can say
[23:56] when we appear weak in the midst of
[23:58] trial
[23:59] then we are strong with the strength
[24:02] and the grace of the living god oh
[24:05] hallelujah
[24:06] praise god amen friends it is god's
[24:10] right and sovereign as the sovereign one
[24:15] to permit us or allow us
[24:19] to pass through various situations
[24:24] because it's all to fulfill
[24:27] his redemptive purposes amen
[24:32] or praise god or god is not an
[24:35] author of frustration frustration and
[24:38] chaos
[24:40] amen but he's a god of peace
[24:44] his purpose is that after we have
[24:47] suffered a while instead of the fire
[24:51] bending us
[24:53] instead of the burdens breaking us
[24:57] he uses the fires the trials
[25:00] the temptations the tribulations and
[25:03] these burdens
[25:04] my friends to shape us
[25:07] and refine us in the refining
[25:11] fires as job has said when he
[25:14] saw himself being tried and suffering he
[25:17] says
[25:18] after that i he has tried me i
[25:22] i will come forth as gold in other words
[25:25] he would be refined
[25:26] he would come to his divine holy ghost
[25:30] perfection and god allows us
[25:34] to go through these things to try us to
[25:37] prove us
[25:38] that we may come into a state
[25:41] of perfection and endless
[25:44] grace god uses this
[25:48] to establish us upon his word
[25:52] because as you know when the wild winds
[25:55] blow
[25:57] the winds of the stormy winds blow
[25:59] against the oak tree
[26:01] it'll bend but not break
[26:05] the christian trials may come against
[26:08] him
[26:09] they may bend they'll be being knocked
[26:12] down to their knees
[26:14] but they'll stand and rise and try again
[26:18] they'll bend but not break oh
[26:22] praise god they will not bow they will
[26:25] not
[26:25] bend or praise god they'll stand
[26:29] upon the word of god and the promises
[26:32] until the crown they gain for his glory
[26:36] amen and amen so
[26:38] trails come to establish you like the
[26:41] oak tree
[26:42] the storms come and it bends it sways
[26:46] but then it lets its roots go deeper
[26:50] deeper deeper when the next storm comes
[26:54] the roots are deep enough and it rocks
[26:57] it it shakes its
[26:58] loosen the soils around the roots goes
[27:01] down deeper
[27:02] so god allows these things
[27:05] to strengthen us and establish us
[27:09] in his word amen so that as a
[27:12] song that the scripture says so that you
[27:15] after a while you may be
[27:16] settled we are settled upon the
[27:20] rock of ages where we are we
[27:23] become immovable like god is immovable
[27:27] our beliefs our moors
[27:30] the things we see the principles the
[27:33] guidelines
[27:34] the instructions out of the word of god
[27:37] and the things he has revealed to us
[27:40] just
[27:40] causes us to settle down upon the word
[27:44] and we anchored there and said i've
[27:47] anchored
[27:48] in jesus the storms of life i'll brave
[27:51] i've anchored in jesus for he has the
[27:55] power to save oh
[27:56] thanks be to god hallelujah that we
[27:59] have that settlement that soundness
[28:03] and we are firmly entrenched and
[28:06] firmly anchored in and upon
[28:09] the rock of ages job said
[28:14] he puts strength in us job chapter 23
[28:18] verse
[28:19] 6. you see he strings
[28:22] us and he knows and why does he know
[28:27] because he has experienced suffering
[28:30] he has suffered more than anyone else
[28:34] ever did
[28:34] in the entire world he has suffered for
[28:38] us and out of his ex his experiential
[28:42] position says to us i know
[28:46] why because he passed through that and
[28:49] more
[28:50] he says i know and he learned
[28:53] obedience by the things that he
[28:56] suffered and was actually made
[28:59] perfect by the things he suffered
[29:03] hebrews chapter 5 verses 8-9 though he
[29:07] were a son yet learned he
[29:10] obedience by the things which he
[29:13] suffered
[29:14] and being made perfect he became the
[29:17] author
[29:18] of salvation unto all them
[29:21] that obey him hallelujah oh praise
[29:25] god in other words the scripture is
[29:28] saying
[29:28] the very character of christ was
[29:32] perfected
[29:33] by suffering suffering
[29:36] was the hammer suffering was the
[29:40] was a hammer that placed him on the
[29:43] anvil
[29:43] and continued to hammer away at him
[29:46] until he became a perfect shining
[29:50] gold piece for his for god's honor
[29:54] amen and so will we praise
[29:57] god hallelujah and so god has ordained
[30:01] the
[30:01] measure of suffering for his church
[30:05] praise god and so that by their
[30:09] faith in his word they will come to a
[30:12] place
[30:14] of perfect faith perfect
[30:17] revelation perfect realization
[30:22] true perfect revelation
[30:26] amen and amen hallelujah
[30:29] amen now why did god do this why did he
[30:33] allow this job
[30:34] james chapter 1 verses 2 to 4 tells us
[30:38] clearly in the word
[30:39] my brethren count it all
[30:42] joy when you fall
[30:46] into diverse temptations oh my god think
[30:50] upon that
[30:50] i would spend time on that but think on
[30:53] the word telling you
[30:54] count it all joy when you fall
[30:58] into different forms and kinds of
[31:01] temptations
[31:03] this that the trying of your
[31:07] faith the stretching of your faith
[31:10] the the the trying of your faith the
[31:12] stretching of
[31:13] it amen hallelujah all my
[31:17] work and patience but
[31:20] let patience have its perfect work
[31:24] that you may be perfect
[31:27] and entire or complete
[31:30] one wanting nothing praise god
[31:34] like satan the bible tells us in the
[31:37] gospels
[31:38] that satan came to jesus
[31:41] and tried him and found nothing
[31:45] there was nothing therefore he was a
[31:47] lamb without
[31:48] spot and without blemish even when he
[31:52] was on the cross
[31:53] he said father forgive them for they
[31:57] know not what they do the love of god
[32:00] flowing out from him and through him the
[32:03] virtues and life of the light of the
[32:06] living god flowing from him
[32:09] he was perfection of perfection for he
[32:12] was the perfect one
[32:14] the lily of the valley the bright and
[32:17] morning star
[32:18] the lamb of god that taketh away
[32:21] the sins of the world oh glory to god
[32:25] hallelujah amen but why does god stand
[32:29] by
[32:31] why does he stand by in the shadows
[32:35] some of us may think he's not there
[32:39] it seems as if god is not on the scene
[32:43] but yes he is for he said i'll never
[32:46] leave you
[32:47] i'll never forsake you but i'll be with
[32:50] you
[32:51] to the very end of the age the answer is
[32:54] found in romans 8
[32:57] 17 and 18 and if
[33:01] or let me use the word but if your
[33:04] children
[33:06] then heirs heirs of god
[33:10] and joint heirs with christ
[33:14] if so be that we
[33:17] suffer with him
[33:21] that you may also be glorified
[33:25] together for i reckon that the
[33:29] sufferings of this
[33:30] present time are not worthy to be
[33:33] compared
[33:34] with the glory that shall be revealed
[33:39] in us hallelujah so friends
[33:44] we don't run the race we can win no
[33:46] prize
[33:48] if you don't suffer how are you going to
[33:50] reign
[33:52] oh praise god so the reason
[33:55] for this is to develop and grow
[33:58] and perfecting us character
[34:03] for character is never made
[34:06] formed or shaped without
[34:10] suffering amen for character
[34:14] is a victory it is not a gift
[34:20] but it's a victory to have
[34:23] genuine true character
[34:27] a man or woman or a young person
[34:32] without character cannot
[34:35] reign cannot overcome
[34:38] cannot have the victory cannot reign
[34:42] over the kingdom
[34:44] of darkness and in
[34:47] the kingdom of light
[34:50] because power the uses of power
[34:55] without having appropriate character to
[34:58] it
[34:59] is absolutely demonic it is satanic
[35:05] and evil when power is
[35:08] in the hands of someone
[35:11] who does not have the character
[35:14] to be able to control the uses
[35:18] of and flow of that power through
[35:21] their lives power then
[35:26] power in a person with
[35:29] character is fit to rule
[35:32] god uses one who
[35:36] can use and control that power
[35:40] by the character that is within them
[35:44] then they are fit to rule
[35:47] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[35:50] hallelujah
[35:52] since god wants us to share his throne
[35:56] with him we must be tested
[35:59] to see how we will administrate
[36:03] that kind of a position that we
[36:07] will be sitting in hallelujah
[36:11] amen he overcame and is set
[36:15] down in the father's throne and so
[36:18] must we overcome and
[36:22] set down in his throne
[36:25] hallelujah oh praise god friends
[36:29] the little temporary suffering is
[36:32] nothing in part with what the glory of
[36:35] god that shall be
[36:37] shining and revealed in us
[36:40] when he comes for us and we come to the
[36:43] end of the way
[36:45] the great holy spirit of the living god
[36:48] flowing through your life oh my god
[36:51] friends nothing is to be compared with
[36:54] it
[36:54] let us surrender ourselves let us
[36:57] reconsecrate ourselves
[36:59] let us bow down before him and worship
[37:03] him
[37:03] and present ourselves living sacrifices
[37:07] for his glory and for his honor
[37:10] praise be to god hallelujah amen
[37:14] yes sir oh praise god amen
[37:17] there is treasures waiting us my friends
[37:20] as we say
[37:21] beyond the blue after this tribulation
[37:25] we are going to enjoy the great
[37:27] treasures
[37:28] of the living god within our heart and
[37:31] within our lives
[37:32] think it not strange concerning the
[37:35] fiery trials
[37:37] that they are to try you amen
[37:41] oh praise god god tries us
[37:45] and develops christ-like character
[37:48] through us and by suffering
[37:51] or praise god if we are true children of
[37:54] god
[37:55] we will be tried and chastened for a
[37:59] father that
[37:59] loves his children will chasten them
[38:03] despite what dr spock says
[38:06] despite what the world says a true
[38:09] mother or father that loves their
[38:12] children
[38:13] will put stops guidelines and
[38:16] chasten them as it wills as they will
[38:19] according to the word of god not abuse
[38:22] them
[38:23] but chasten them and try them hallelujah
[38:27] here it is friends that church at church
[38:30] that is not suffering
[38:32] and has not really been tried is
[38:35] not truly of god for hebrews 12
[38:39] 6 for whom the lord love it he chastened
[38:41] it
[38:42] and scored yet every son
[38:46] daughter whom you receive it for if you
[38:49] will be without chastisement
[38:51] whereof are you partakers
[38:55] then are you bastards and not
[38:58] sons of the living god oh
[39:01] my we don't want to claim we are born
[39:03] again but instead we are
[39:05] bastard born to the real true revealed
[39:08] word
[39:09] of the living god hallelujah amen my
[39:12] friends
[39:13] there's no age free from this
[39:16] what was in the age of smorn smyrna
[39:20] may be applied to every other age
[39:24] praise god this is of god
[39:27] this is from god this is the will of god
[39:31] and it is needful within our hearts and
[39:33] lives
[39:34] we need the lord to teach us and guide
[39:37] us
[39:37] into this truth that we are to suffer
[39:40] and be like christ or be christ-like
[39:44] for love suffereth long
[39:47] and is still kind hallelujah
[39:50] matthew 5 11-12 blessed are you when men
[39:54] shall revile you and persecute you
[39:57] and shall see all manner of evil against
[40:00] you falsely for
[40:02] my sake o rejoice
[40:05] and be exceeding glad for great is your
[40:08] reward in heaven
[40:10] for so persecuted they the prophets
[40:14] which were before you and they
[40:17] persecuted him
[40:18] and if they persecuted me he said will
[40:21] they not persecute you
[40:23] if they mistreated him will they not
[40:25] mistreat you
[40:26] but stand firm to the word of the living
[40:29] god
[40:30] yes friends cloudy skies
[40:34] and the storms of life are no signs of
[40:37] god's
[40:38] lack of love or god's disapproval
[40:42] upon us neither are bright skies and
[40:46] still waters signs of his love
[40:50] and approval hallelujah
[40:54] his approval is his election of you
[40:58] to be in the beloved
[41:01] his beloved his bride that
[41:04] is the love of god all the other things
[41:07] come to pass but that is unless eternal
[41:11] life

[41:14] love
[41:16] from before the foundation of the world
[41:20] does he love us yes he does
[41:23] how do we know we know it because he
[41:26] says so amen we know it because he has
[41:31] manifested
[41:32] his love to us by bringing
[41:35] us unto himself oh praise god think upon
[41:40] that
[41:41] oh hallelujah and he has given us his
[41:44] spirit

[41:54] side
[41:54] oh glory to god hallelujah amen
[41:58] how shall i prove my love to him
[42:02] how shall we prove our love to him by
[42:05] believing his word
[42:07] by believing what he has said to us
[42:10] and accept the promises that he has
[42:14] given to us
[42:15] and by conducting ourselves with joy
[42:19] amidst the trials for we are not looking
[42:22] at today
[42:24] we are looking way into tomorrow
[42:27] hallelujah and his wisdom
[42:30] his grace his faith allows us to bear
[42:34] the brunt of satan's death
[42:36] trials and all the tribulation he brings
[42:39] against us
[42:40] for god will bring us right through and
[42:43] bring us to pass
[42:45] yes i know thy poverty
[42:49] but thou art rich as he walks up and
[42:52] down and misses
[42:53] church like a father like the head of a
[42:57] household
[42:58] like a provider a protector he looks on
[43:02] us
[43:02] and our needs and our property oh
[43:06] they they they're untutored untaught
[43:10] doesn't understand the believer young
[43:13] doesn't believe understand they stumble
[43:16] at this truth why did god do this why
[43:18] did god do that
[43:19] not recognizes recognizing that the
[43:22] fullness of god's love
[43:24] is revealed to us in his election
[43:27] of us into that part of his
[43:31] masterpiece bride for this last day
[43:34] oh glory to god hallelujah oh my yes sir
[43:38] we believe in the love of god in the
[43:41] goodness of god
[43:42] and in the wisdom of god and we take no
[43:45] thought for tomorrow hallelujah of what
[43:48] we shall lead to what we shall drink
[43:50] or what we shall put on for we know our
[43:53] heavenly father
[43:54] is watching over us and our father
[43:57] knows our heavenly father knows that we
[44:01] have need of all these things hallelujah
[44:05] and he will take care of us the people
[44:07] of god
[44:08] the are not materially minded
[44:13] but they are christ-minded they don't do
[44:17] not seek the treasures of this world it
[44:20] may come their way
[44:21] they may be blessed in that way but they
[44:24] do
[44:25] not make it their life's ambition their
[44:28] life's pulsation
[44:30] oh praise god they are not materially
[44:34] minded hallelujah they seek the things
[44:38] above
[44:39] it is absolutely true that most
[44:42] christians are not wealthy
[44:46] a mainly poor as it was
[44:50] in the days of the lord jesus
[44:54] and so it wasn't paul's day even paul
[44:57] himself
[44:58] the apostle had one quote
[45:02] and it's even true today
[45:05] we see peter and john at the beautiful
[45:08] gate
[45:08] they were not rich they were poor they
[45:11] were not uh
[45:12] rich as rome is rich as as as these
[45:16] different headquarters are rich and
[45:19] or increase with goods but peter said to
[45:22] the beggar of the beautiful gate
[45:24] he said silver and gold we have none in
[45:27] other words we have poor penniless
[45:28] preachers
[45:29] but such as we have we give to you rise
[45:32] take up your bed and walk
[45:34] in the name of jesus christ they have
[45:36] the coins of god's kingdom the power of
[45:39] the holy spirit
[45:40] flowing through their lives and that's
[45:43] what they gave to him
[45:44] rise take up thy bed and walk hallelujah
[45:48] or praise god oh my oh friends but in
[45:51] this live decien
[45:53] age in which we live we find this one a
[45:57] vast wealth
[45:59] where often their
[46:02] criteria for true spirituality
[46:07] is how much money you have how much
[46:10] wealth you can display how much you
[46:13] earn what position of power influence
[46:17] that you have in this way in this world
[46:21] and there's much preaching about the
[46:23] prosperity gospel
[46:26] that is in the world today
[46:29] the abundance of earthly goods that we
[46:31] have
[46:32] seems to give people credibility and
[46:35] gives them status
[46:38] in the present day society but not
[46:41] in the eyes and mind of god
[46:44] god says to the true believer you may
[46:47] appear poor
[46:48] but really you are rich why they are
[46:52] rich in the
[46:52] things of god and their reward comes
[46:56] beyond the veil hallelujah oh praise
[46:59] god my friends the kingdom of god is not
[47:04] meat and drink
[47:05] amen hallelujah it is not really
[47:08] material
[47:10] it is within us a rich man is rich in
[47:14] god
[47:15] not in worldly things or praise
[47:18] god hallelujah so the spirit is crying
[47:21] out to the people
[47:23] hold on hold on because i'm seeing and i
[47:26] know your poverty i see your needs
[47:30] you haven't very much if anything to
[47:32] post off
[47:33] what the what the little you have has
[47:36] been even
[47:37] taken away from you and you even gladly
[47:40] give up your possessions
[47:42] in exchange for the eternal ones
[47:46] you are laughed at your scorn your mock
[47:48] you are made
[47:49] fun of in every way you don't have the
[47:53] material resources to fall back
[47:56] on but you are rich in spite
[47:59] of all that you are rich in spite of all
[48:03] that
[48:03] for you your security your eternal
[48:06] security
[48:07] lies in him praise
[48:10] god our security is in christ
[48:14] amen hallelujah he is our shield he is
[48:17] our fortress
[48:19] he has a rock of ages oh praise get god
[48:22] his kingdom our kingdom is yet to come
[48:26] and to be revealed to them and it
[48:29] will come and it will be an everlasting
[48:32] and eternal kingdom
[48:34] of the living god so he says i'm mindful
[48:36] of your trials
[48:37] i am mindful of your woes i know
[48:41] how hard it is for you to get on with
[48:43] your life
[48:44] oh my hallelujah and i will remember
[48:49] all of this when i
[48:52] come to claim my own
[48:56] and then i will remar
[48:59] reward you now what i'm preaching here
[49:02] as i'm about to conclude
[49:04] this is not against rich people or those
[49:07] who are rich
[49:09] for god may make some rich allow some to
[49:12] be rich
[49:13] for he says i give the power to get
[49:15] wealth you may be smart and think you
[49:17] got it yourself
[49:18] but as god had to enable you and empower
[49:21] you to be able to get it
[49:22] now what are you going to use it for
[49:24] what are you going to do with it
[49:26] he empowers some because he knows what
[49:28] he wants to use them to do with
[49:30] it not only to benefit themselves but to
[49:33] benefit bless extend expand
[49:36] his kingdom for his glory and for his
[49:39] honor some of god's people are rich
[49:43] amen but they've got to watch both sides
[49:46] of it
[49:46] money can become a snare it can make one
[49:50] arrogant make one proud make one feel
[49:53] self-sufficient
[49:55] and they lose their dependency on god
[49:57] and begin to
[49:59] depend upon their treasures instead of
[50:02] depending
[50:03] upon their lord his protection his
[50:05] guidance his blessing
[50:06] and everything upon them hallelujah oh
[50:09] praise
[50:10] god hallelujah and then there are some
[50:12] that are poor
[50:13] and and meaner and more
[50:17] despicable than those that are wealthy
[50:21] hallelujah way back in the first
[50:25] church age james cried out
[50:28] that we are not to put stock in wealthy
[50:30] people
[50:31] i see people who are believers and they
[50:35] uh you have to be a rich minister before
[50:37] you have credibility
[50:39] you have to be a rich preacher with a
[50:41] big huge church
[50:42] and large congregation before you have
[50:45] people's confidence
[50:46] oh brother soon sorry he made a lot of
[50:49] money when he wasn't even a believer so
[50:51] i'm going to believe him
[50:52] oh brother sunset built a church that
[50:54] can seat so many so i'm going to trust
[50:57] confidence and he must know what he's
[50:59] doing it's not
[51:00] based on those things it's based on the
[51:03] word of god and the revelation of the
[51:06] word of god
[51:06] god bless those brothers by the way
[51:08] unless you you you think
[51:10] my thinking is in a wrong area it is not
[51:13] god
[51:14] bless all those who are in that position
[51:17] they must know their position in christ
[51:20] and i must recognize mine in christ
[51:23] god places trees on every state some on
[51:27] the top of the mountain some midway
[51:29] some down some further down some down in
[51:31] the valley
[51:32] and we must recognize way and bloom
[51:35] where we are planted
[51:36] and be used of god where god wants to
[51:39] use you
[51:40] and be satisfied with that and let god
[51:43] use you
[51:43] wherever you are hallelujah
[51:46] amen let us not have respect of persons
[51:51] and elevating raising people up to
[51:55] uh positions of power
[51:59] and dignity and credibility just because
[52:01] of their earthly
[52:03] and worldly success and
[52:06] become believers
[52:10] trying to butter up to other ones
[52:13] that may be well off and wealthy giving
[52:16] them your
[52:17] allegiance based on their position
[52:21] oh god help every one of us here today
[52:26] you bother up to them because you want
[52:27] some help
[52:29] you want them to use their influence on
[52:31] your behalf
[52:33] for some thing like that rather than
[52:35] trusting
[52:36] in the living god amen i know a lot of
[52:40] brothers have become annoyed with me
[52:42] because
[52:43] i'm just a plain talker and i'll say no
[52:45] brother i i don't need that or
[52:47] i don't need to depend on this i don't
[52:49] need you or anything of that nature
[52:52] nothing against their brother sister or
[52:55] whoever they are
[52:56] but i'm making sure i make it clear my
[52:59] dependency is upon
[53:01] god and god alone whether i'm rich or
[53:04] whether i'm in rags
[53:06] my faith rests upon him and his
[53:09] word and his word alone amen
[53:12] oh my friends jobs james says don't do
[53:16] it
[53:16] for money isn't everything money isn't
[53:19] the answer
[53:20] christ is the answer to all our longings
[53:23] christ is the answer
[53:24] to all our needs amen so friends
[53:28] in this age we have more wealth than we
[53:30] ever had
[53:31] and yet less is being accomplished
[53:36] for the kingdom of god spiritually

[54:01] god's spirit in a church in a life
[54:04] comes by surrendering it all

[54:14] to the word of god alone

[54:41] holy spirit

[54:46] that we may eat and be filled and never
[54:49] hunger
