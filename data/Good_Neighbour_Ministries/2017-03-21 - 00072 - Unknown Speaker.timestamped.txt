[42:38] here for. But I would not have you to be
[42:44] ignorant, brethren, concerning them
[42:47] which are sleep that you sorrow or not,
[42:50] even as others which have no hope.
[42:54] For if we believe
[42:57] that Jesus died and rose again,
[43:01] even so them
[43:03] also which sleep in Jesus will God bring
[43:06] with him. For this we say unto you, by
[43:10] thus sayaeth the Lord,
[43:13] that we which are alive and remain
[43:18] unto the coming of the Lord shall not
[43:21] prevent them return asleep.
[43:24] For the Lord himself
[43:27] will descend from heaven
[43:30] with a shout,
[43:32] with the voice of the archangel, and
[43:35] with the trump of God. And the dead in
[43:38] Christ shall rise first. And we which
[43:41] are alive, we are alive,
[43:44] will be caught up and remain will be
[43:47] caught up together with them in the
[43:50] clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And
[43:54] so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[43:57] Wherefore comfort one another with these
[44:00] words. Amen.
