TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good wednesday evening good to be here with you again in the name of the lord jesus christ may the lord bless us all together as we studied tonight on the subject of balaam's trick balaam's trick and our scripture reading is found in revelation chapter 2 reading verse 14. but i have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication amen thanks be to god our righteous lord and heavenly father thy blessings we accept and believe and receive today for we gather in no other name but in the illustrious glorious wonderful and marvelous name of our lord and savior jesus christ may to him be all the praise honor and glory amen and amen well thanks be to god i'm so happy that the lord has no regard or respect for the educational systems and informations of men they may be important for our existence uh uh here on the earth but in the eyes of god uh you know god has no respect for this these nickelodeon um you know awards and phds and ddds and bas and lld's whatever god has no respect for that there is respect for that here on the earth because it's needed for people to live uh you know and to go through the system be able to work to make an earning to provide for their families their own welfare and therefore they need it so you must understand i'm not saying i'm saying to you education is needed and necessary for our earthly walk and existence but in the eyes of god he has no regard and respect for that because he himself said all the wisdom of all the kings and all the princes of the earth are nothing but a drop in a bucket to me so the wisdom of man is nothing in the eyes of god and the wisdom of natural man will never understand the wisdom of god which appears to them to be too simple it appears to them as if it's nothing but that's the way god loves it to appear in that manner god has no regard to man-made organizations well they love their organizations from the time of nimrod nimrod started organizing armies and battalions platoons and so on uh having it that way and that has morphed and moved itself and propagated itself until this day in the form of refined and distilled organizations uh with their abilities and capacities to literally conquer the earth organizationally and so god has no respect for them but in the midst of it all the god of heaven having respect for israel uh because israel had respect for him and his word amen and god vindicated israel in the midst of all that was happening or occurring god vindicated them of course israel did not look like a really polished people or a polished nation they came out of egypt running for their lives crossing the red sea going into the desert and having to constantly flee from the presence of any ever present danger but thank god in the midst of it all there are a blessed people hallelujah we also had to come out from denomination denominations we came away from the the denominational slavery we came away from the old task masters and we had to run spiritually for our lives we are here to tonight to give praise honor and glory to god because like israel we might just spend lifetime in a certain denomination a certain church doing preaching or doing sunday school teaching or in the ladies fellowship or association whatever we could do to help what we sought at that time was the work of god tending spirit sheep and slaving away in the fields oh my and yet we were under death of uh uh excommunication or or anything of that matter but thanks be to god we are now free for whom the son of man sets free is free indeed you are free in jesus christ enjoy your freedom come forth into the glorious liberty of the sons and daughters of god and enjoy the freedom that is in christ freedom i say not folly not the foolishness of sin amen liberty but not the lawlessness that comes that one thinks they can walk anyway live anyhow and still be acceptable to god no that is not what i am talking about i'm talking about complete total surrender to him in gratitude for what he has done for us we surrender our hearts and our lives into his glorious marvelous keeping knowing that he will keep us to the very end amen oh praise god here was israel oh a people that were looked down upon even as the believers of this message looked down upon by all the nations round about denominations round about and the more bites and the ammonites oh my they were relatives of israel through lot and having incest with his two daughters producing those two nations of the moabites and the ammonites and so they knew the the scripture as much as as anyone else because they knew about uh abraham and what abraham's faith was one god revelation of the holy spirit they were conscious of this and so they believed it that way amen oh my friends even in that way as moab and ammon looked down upon israel organizations looked down upon the true church of the living god because she appears like a little flock she appears as a disorganized bunch of people from everywhere as the old song said they come from the east and west they come from the lands afar [Applause] to feast with the king to dine as his guests how blessed these pale brains are beholding his hallowed face ago with light divine bless partakers of his grace as gems in his crowns to shine yes jesus is coming soon oh praise god jesus is coming soon rapture time is here let us get our lamps trimmed on burning and be ready for the master praise god hallelujah amen hallelujah so organizations naturally or oh and i may say but abnormally love to look down upon god's true church the little flock the little speckled bird they look down upon her amen that little ugly duckling so-called and they say all manner of evil against her and they will try finally to get her to join with them and when they can't get you to join with them their their last step their final if i may say solution is to destroy such a people who gather not in a church name but gather in no other name but the name of the lord and savior jesus christ amen hallelujah friends the bible says that balaam seduced god's people into committing fornication and i want to say that today people are being seduced by denominational teachers of great natural knowledge wealth of knowledge and they seduce the people or persuade or convince the people to come with them join their denomination and thereby committing spiritual fornication against god amen they commit spiritual fornication by accepting false seed or false doctrine instead of the fullness of the word of god well you say well brother simon what is your thought here my objective is that i want to do all i can here to get you to escape from that trap that was set for you amen oh praise god now everything written in the scriptures we know is for our admonition our advice and our guidance so that we can learn from it in the book of numbers chapter 23 verse 9 from the top of the rocks i see him from the hills i behold him lo the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations oh praise god god is looking down seeing israel and realize that israel is dwelling on the rocks oh praise god what a place to the children of god to be to be standing on the rock revelation of the word of god but to the people of the world they believe you're on the rocks you you you you got serious problems serious trouble i can't live like that i can't be like that but you see if you're a real christian and you have the revelation you're rejoicing night and day as you walk the narrow way for the hand of god upon your life you see oh my glory god so i'm glad that i'm on the rocks oh take god never mind they're gonna come to judgment and the rock will be on them but the bible tells us the rocks of god how the mills of god grinds slowly oh my but they're grind sure and it's one thing for you to be on the rock it's another thing for the rock to fall on you for the scriptures that it will grind you to powder amen hallelujah oh god looks down upon israel and he's seeing all their faults all their mistakes and he's seeing all their good that they do just as he looks upon us we are still in our earthly journey living in this flesh and we are still apt to make mistakes not deliberate or purposeful mistakes but if you sin we have advocate with the father we have the cleansing of the blood we have the forgiveness of our sins from our heavenly father not an earthly one but thank god we have that so god knows everything about us but from his great fullness of his love and his mercy he forgives his children oh thank god the bible says israel dwelt alone we're not even organized amen you see people up don't understand there's a difference between organization and order you can be disorganized in other words you're not of the systems you don't take any of the tried proven systems that they have in the world but you are still walking or walking with god in a order a supernatural order of god hallelujah for oh praise god hallelujah amen now we find out israel not being an organized system or nation they had no king amen but thank god they had a prophet glory to god and that prophet's message that prophet's word was what they lived by and walked by amen hallelujah and the prophet had god in him and the spirit would speak through the prophet thus saith the lord god will use that man speak through him and be a voice to his people hallelujah praise god thank god hallelujah israel did not belong to the united nations of that day and as a group as a people that follows the message of william marian branham the 20th century prophet the messenger of the bible revelation 10 7 hallelujah we belong not to any united nations neither do we belong to any world council of churches we don't belong to any individual denomination any other group we do not belong and we don't need to belong to any such things because in our hearts we belong to god we belong to him hallelujah glory to god and we don't need their counsel we don't need their advice or their admonition all we need is to listen to the voice of god among us thus saith the lord hallelujah amen praise god amen now let's talk a bit about balaam balaam had the proper approach to god and he was so anointed that from time to time he would actually get genuine revelation from the presence of god but he still used his anointing and his gift to join himself the moab a type of a denomination and there because he wanted the position of being a chief bishop a man that is renowned recognized and well paid well taken care of so he positioned himself in that wise now what did he do for this great favor to be luck now balaam formulated a plan and it was a very cunning uh plan that balaam had and i'm going to show you and tell you this plan for this is balaam's trick that he used in trying to trick seduce and entrap the children of israel you see he had a plan to be able to entrap israel into sin thereby forcing god trying to force god to bring down judgment upon israel because israel if they sin then god said he will judge the sinner and so if he can get israel to sin then he would literally stand back and force the hands of god to enforce his own law and to judge the people of israel of course they made no i had no understanding of god's love mercy and grace in the midst of mistakes sinning falling whatever uh wherever it's in the same way satan in the garden use the very same trick see balaam used the same trick so it's satan again but satan knew that if he could beguile or defile eve then my brother sister if he could get her to fall into fleshly sin in any way then god would have to pass his sentence of death and judgment upon her so that was the trick that he wanted to use and still uses to this day but he failed to recognize god's plan the plan of redemption god in mercy and in judgment excuse me hear my friends that he planned it so that if he could get israel to come and join him in sin then it would force the hand of god to bring judgment upon them so he sent out invitations to the nations round about and he sent out an invitation to israel to come and join them at the feast of baal pior now there it is oh it's just like the denominations today will say oh come over and worship with us we all relatives we all christian just like moab was with israel oh my come over and worship with us we are all brethren we are all brothers we all christians but listen friends well it's different kinds of christians and you know you want to know who you are and why god raised you up in the midst of all of this oh israel no doubt had seen egyptian feasts and so they did not think much much about it just as some believers today will say uh oh i don't see nothing much about going to this banquet or this uh denomination i don't see anything with the party that they have over there or the outing that they have over there the retreat or the campground that they have i see nothing whatsoever that is wrong with that amen and i believe we ought to love them we ought to love them and win them to christ win them over to the message and being friendly and nice never hurt anybody whatsoever oh maybe that's the way they thought but when they got into that feast of bael pior and the music started the party started and those moabite women dressed up in all mineral short sex exposure clothing with their legs exposed the behind pushed out and everything else exposed before them just a matter of a fleshly display dancing around whirling around undressing striptease right in the feast you were stripping off dancing like salome dancing the seven veils dropping off a veil every time a church age was passing oh my until before the end of it all they were strict naked before them oh my and so here they were and israel was caught up into that and some of the israelite men fleshly were were tempted and fell into adultery and god in his wrath slew 40 000 of them that very day oh my friends just as much i tell you we've got to watch ourselves because i'm telling you they'll come with all those manner of temptations invite you to this great big meeting revival meeting and we all won and you don't know what's wrapped up in there oh my think of it now we know not only that balaam use satan's trick from the garden of eden but constantine after that used the same trick at the council of nicaea and his successes did they invited all the people they invited the true church along with the false church to a convention to this council that they would get together and so when they got together and the church sat down to eat and rose up to play and i used the term as the bible uses it rose up to play meaning uh that they rose up to partake to partake also like everyone and what did what happened there they began partaking of church forms they had to go along with them because they were present and they were partaking of the church ceremonies that partook of those pagan feasts that they were having at that time which was really pagan babylonian feasts with christian names on them trying to make it sound christian and making the people feel religious as if they were christian but they were against the word of god israel or the true church was thereby trapped and she had committed spiritual fornication and many times when a woman creates a natural fornication adultery just like that man would leave the house i want to tell you god walked out on israel he walked out of that house walked out of that place and there she was found in her filth found in her sin oh my when any man any woman turns away from the word of god nothing left but death and judgment as the book of proverbs says there's a way that seemeth right unto a man or to a woman but the ways thereof are the ways of death amen moment you join yourself you join yourself to a denomination the holy spirit takes his departure and that person dies spiritually don't join not denomination don't go out there and become the member of any of those systems whatsoever don't get taken up with their creeds or with their traditions or anything that that you want to place in place of the word and of the spirit because if you do you're dead in sins and in trespasses it's over for you and you become eternally separated from god away from him and that has happened every age since that time god delivers his people brings them out by the blood sanctifies them by his word let them walk through the waters of baptism get them under the pillar of fire filled with the spirit of god but after a while as god's people walk their first passion for him their first love for him the fire of zeal and desire begins to cool off from their lives and then somebody gets a good idea why don't we organize ourselves properly so that we can preserve our faith and make a name and be recognized by all these other denominations so that we can be recognized by by them you see and then they organize and they go right back backwards against god's word because they are no longer of the spirit of god or led by the spirit of god they're just now under a certain form of worship because the spirit has left that worship and now they are dead because they hybridize themselves with creeds and form and there is no life in them so what am i saying balaam got israel to commit fornication and do you know that the spirit lustful spirit of physical fornication is the same spirit that is on denominational organizational fornication desire for all those kinds of things it's right there in organized religion yes so the spirit of fornication is the spirit of religious organization and all fornicators will find themselves in the lake affair as the bible says because organizations denominations are of the devil it is not a form of god i do not speak of the people but i speak of the system of denomination genuine wonderful people are in there but they're trapped in a prison they're in a system that is contrary to the word of the living god that is why god will cast the old harlot and her daughters into the lake of fire amen he praise god it's a totally wrong spirit that separates god's people into this this group the denomination but baptist methodist they're divided in over 000 or 4 000 various groups all around the world various denominations around the world divided them from one church in the beginning into thousands all over each claiming truth right and that's the devil using them to create confusion instead of staying with your original faith they've moved away from it and create a spirit of discrepancy amen separate themselves from god now notice constantine gave special feasts onto the people and those religious feasts that he gave a spontaneous were the same old babylonian pagan feasts with new names from the christian faith that he took and put on those babylonian feasts and then has it mixed into the church of god i'm showing you how christianity got mixed in with paganism hybridized producing nothing but hybridized membership sons and daughters who believe they have the truth but they are high bred contrary to the word of god yes taking christian names putting them on old babylonian feasts and in some cases christian rights were taken and abused with pagan ceremonies he took the worship of the s-u-n the s-u-n for there were sun-worshippers and he took that and instead of celebrating the worship of the s-u-n god on december 21st which is the beginning of the winter solisties when the sun resurrects or returns begin to return again because that's when they used to celebrate the birthday of the sun god s-u-n god and so they put it on december 25th and to make it become christian they call it christ mass christ mass meanings worship so a mass is a worship so christ's mass or worship of christ was put on the 25th of december in order to recognize the birthday of the s-u-n god now most of the christians were slaves most of them were under persecution and when that feast day or we would say today holiday was given the christian slaves would come together and under the cover of them one side worshiping the s-u-n-god they would hide in their little uh underground places and caves and homes and they would give praise to god for the birth of the s o n of god so you see how the devil tricked the church by playing on the wash and to this day they would have a sun worst right in the churches right in the cathedrals while they are worshiping the s-u-n god we are here to give glory to the o n of god and to magnify and glorify his great name again hallelujah of course you know that the lord jesus christ was not born in december that's what that changed back there that he was really born in april in the spring when new life comes on the scene and when lambs are born born in april yes my friends but they took another feast and there the feast of astarte feast of the false goddess astarte and they change that and put a christian name on it and call it easter and there it is and started these religious traditions of men that are not of god now i'm showing you the difference that we worship and give glory to a genuine christ christmas worshiping the s o n of god while they are after the s-u-n god they may claim they are worshiping the son the son of god like you do but in actual fact back hidden in their so-called mysteries they are worshipping their sun god and now on the easter with all its bunnies with all its uh rabbits all its easter eggs they're really worshipping under a pagan babylonian feast they're worshiping astate and they call that easter which is supposed to celebrate the death burial and resurrection of the lord and actually that was a pagan feast of i started they began to place altars in the church are you with me here they began to put images right in the very church of god now exodus chapter 20 verses 1 to 6 where god speaks expressly that you are to worship no other god for i the lord thy god he is the only god and he says the idols images of man you thou shalt not bow down to them nor serve them amen why for i the lord thy god i'm a jealous god hallelujah amen praise god and god promise in his word we should not do that and they still go ahead having idols images no matter how artistically beautiful they are god says thou shalt not bow down to them thou shalt not serve them and so they continue to do it to this day they've included also the apostles creed which is not found in your bible you can read it from cover to copper and you will never find any such thing as an apostles creed that is something they agreed upon and put together of themselves and change the entire uh god's economy that changed it upended it and placed these things in it they began to teach the people communion of saints the worshipping of their ancestors and they their teaching on communion of saints and by that they have made that church the most spiritualistic church in the entire world where the bible tells us clearly we are not to pray to the dead that is called necromancy and you are not supposed to pray to the dead they'll say oh well why do you pray to jesus he is not dead he is alive forevermore he himself said that and by his presence his spirit his vindication he proves that he's not dead but he's alive forevermore i want you to recognize that clearly here today my friends they brought images they brought in apostles creed amen they brought in ancestor worship which is nothing but witchcraft right into what they call the church of god amen and so they become the most spiritistic spirit uh witchcraft working church so-called under the name and guise of christianity working it that way where the bible tells you how every foul bird of protestantism and all their organization come in and find a roosting place within that babylonian system my friends altars high altars high so-called holy altars go read your bible where god says tear down those holy altars now my friends we don't do that today but we preached the word of god so you could recognize what where we are at and what this is all about they introduce incense in the house of god not there for us to do old testament yes not in the new testament images and idols oh my friends all these things were placed in the house of god contrary to the work of the holy spirit that began to establish shrines so-called holy places when the when jesus appeared in the monk transfiguration peter so-called pope wanted to establish a shrine a holy place there and jesus said no don't you do it don't establish nothing for moses nor elijah nor me don't put nothing here for the true worshipers will not worship god in mount jerusalem they will not worship god over here or over there but the true worshiper will worship god in spirit and in truth amen and i believe that according to the word of our god amen hallelujah so friends here they are introduce the confession of your sins to a sinful man called a priest a sinful man like yourself claiming that you confess to him and then he will forgive your sins on the leadership and under guidance contrary to god's word no such a thing in your bible that has uh uh a black hand dirty hands are gonna wash a dirty cattle and both are suddenly going to become clean it's not even logical it's not sensible it's not scriptural and it is not in the word of god the bible tells us god said i hate those who eats things sacrifice unto idols of course he's not speaking about just naturally he's speaking about spiritually partaking of their false teachings and of their false doctrines in that way they're taking it in amen now recognize here that god is speaking of all of this in a spiritual sense bowing down before images don't you partake of it lighting of candles don't you take part of it no sir using all minor pagan holidays and putting the name of christ on it do not partake of it amen confessing your sins to men like yourselves instead of going and confessing to god within the altar and the cathedral of your heart amen all those things belong to the devil's religion i repeat such things belongs to the devil's religion amen partakers of those evil things and you're an idolatry whether you admit it or not and look listen as in my childhood i went to saint aloysius uh by school i went to the church i did everything on ash wednesday and so on so i know what i'm talking about not only by experience experience but from study of the word and of certain histories which we will get to after a while and here we see friends whether you admit it or not you're caught up in idolatry innocently you don't know it but you were seduced persuaded by tradition and led to it by these so-called man contrary to the word of god amen they can say oh i'm really confessing to god but i'm just going to confess to the priest that's just the way of them collecting information on every member of their congregation and moving all that information back to their so-called headquarters or head people but anyway here it is friends well they they say the priest can forgive you of your sins the priest himself needs god's forgiveness for his sins no man can forgive sins but jesus christ himself amen hallelujah they can say what they want but they are actually practicing and partaking of that old babylonian satanic religion that originates way back in antiquity way back in bible days and it has winded its way like a snake amen leaving a trail of the serpent through time and bringing that foul evil slimy religion right down to this day and joining getting people to join themselves the idols partake of these ungodly feasts and committing spiritual fornication which will lead them to nothing else but spiritual death amen but thank god the true church the true church of god will marry or join herself to none other but jesus christ himself who is the word for in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god john 1 amen hallelujah amen so here that babylonian church married to the state while the true church married itself to god the word that's true the false church joined with idols and we the true church married to the holy spirit and his great revelation of himself in the word and with the power of the state behind them they feel as if they are all powerful in this world but on on the other hand with the power of the holy spirit behind us and in us we feel empowered and endued with the power of the great holy spirit to accomplish what god wants us to accomplish amen praise god thank god we do not reign no man really reigns on the earth no man can take the place of god or or or place himself that he is acting in the place of christ no sir there is only one lord jesus christ and we don't accept any head of any false church amen praise god we only accept one headship one husband one leadership and that is of jesus christ listen friends revelation 2 16 repent or else i will come unto thee quickly and fight against me with the sword of my mouth of course that is the word of god amen the two-edged sword hold on new testament caught you coming and caught you going amen behold god said it clearly in this word god can't overlook the sin of those who have done such things and so god says repent confess your wrong amen come to me for forgiveness and let me cleanse you and wash you amen praise god hallelujah this is god's command and for us to disobey it is nothing but death amen i will make war upon you with the sword of my mouth amen you remember how the mystery babylon beast make war with the saints now god is saying you're not in war with my people but i'll make war with you with the word of god with the revelation of the holy spirit we're gonna cut you to pieces with the revelation of the word of the living god amen and one day those who are now fighting this message this word amen will find the very word they claim to believe begins fighting against them because god will enable us to take the very word which they claim to believe and show them where they have gone off the path they are far away from the truth and they fail to recognize who they are amen hallelujah amen repent how sweet are the thoughts of a true believer when they hear words of repentance that we can come to god and say lord nothing in my hands i bring i have no graven idols i have no no cross with a big chain on my neck to say that is my holiness i have no incense my my real incense is my prayers rising up before you oh my god nothing in my hands i bring but simply to the cross i cling o god just a sorrow for my sin lord i repent i am o god what i am and the things that i may have done all wasted years lord wasted years oh how foolish as i marched on in darkness and fear now lord i want to turn around i want to turn around for i hear your voice calling it's calling me from my life of wasted years and so i come now and commit myself to you i accept you i believe what i have heard what i receive and i can say i've seen the light lord i seen the bright shining light of understanding revelation i have now caught an epiphany from the presence of almighty god my life has changed my walk has changed my talk has changed oh god take me as i am i ask it in the name of jesus christ may the lord bless you my brothers and sisters may the lord overshadow you with his great presence and bring out of your life the great marks of the real christian that you may walk in the light as he is in the light jesus christ being with you every step of the way god bless you everyone father i pray for these who have heard the word may many come to a conclusion come to their valley of decision where they have chosen jesus christ to be their lord and master and to walk with him now and forevermore i ask for this christian healing of the soul the repentance and the clinging and coming to jesus christ by confessing their sins by coming to him to be baptized water in water in his name and thereafter
