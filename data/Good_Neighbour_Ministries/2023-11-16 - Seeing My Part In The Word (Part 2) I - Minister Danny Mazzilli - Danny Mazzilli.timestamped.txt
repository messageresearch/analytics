[22:08] [Music]
[22:33] is an opportunity for us to um study the
[22:38] word of God and to find exactly what the
[22:41] Lord has for us could I get some more
[22:43] monitor here on this
[22:47] side amen praise the Lord
[22:51] Jesus glory to
[22:54] God so tonight we're going to
[22:56] continue
[22:59] in the series that we've been um looking
[23:01] at and looking at the word of God and
[23:04] seeing our part in the word we've been
[23:07] looking at um uh you
[23:10] know seeing ourselves in the word and
[23:14] then once we see ourselves in the word
[23:16] then we've got to hone in on exactly
[23:18] what it is that God has called us to do
[23:22] and to recognize our part in the word of
[23:24] God Amen because um that's the
[23:27] difference between between really being
[23:30] called as a Christian and to the
[23:33] ministry of Jesus Christ is that if God
[23:36] is calling you he's calling you for a
[23:38] purpose he has a a purpose and a plan I
[23:41] need more monitor on this right here so
[23:44] I can hear this monitor here better
[23:47] please um praise God and so tonight we
[23:51] will start um by reading the word before
[23:54] we do that we'll go to the Lord in
[23:56] prayer and ask him to to come and anoint
[23:59] his word father we're so grateful this

[24:48] available through yielded vessels so
[24:51] won't you take control now and give us

[25:21] capacity that you have uh anointed them
[25:24] Lord to be a blessing there and to touch
[25:27] the hearts and the lives there of your
[25:30] children in Africa we pray Lord we
[25:32] commit them into your hands we ask that
[25:34] you would bring them safely in Jesus
[25:37] name amen praise God God bless you
[25:39] Saints so our scripture tonight from 1
[25:42] Corinthians
[25:43] 12
[25:45] 27-31 it says now ye are the body of
[25:49] Christ and members in
[25:53] particular and God hath set some in the
[25:56] church first apostles OST Les
[25:59] secondarily prophets thirdly teachers
[26:02] after that Miracles then Gifts of
[26:05] healing helps governments diversities of
[26:09] tongues and all are all Apostles are all
[26:15] prophets are all teachers are all
[26:18] workers of Miracles have all the gifts
[26:21] of healing do all speak with tongues do
[26:25] all
[26:26] interpret but it earnestly the best
[26:29] gifts and yet show I unto you a more
[26:34] excellent way the Lord add His blessings
[26:37] to the word you may be
[26:39] seated amen praise
[26:42] God and so in looking at this scripture
[26:45] we see here that um that the Lord is
[26:47] telling us that we're all members and I
[26:50] want you to take note in particular in
[26:53] particular means that that uh each and
[26:56] every one of of you have something
[26:59] peculiar and something that you have
[27:02] been gifted with in order to edify and
[27:06] to build and to make up the fullness of
[27:09] the body of Christ amen praise God go to
[27:12] the next slide just in a review here
[27:14] from part one we were looking at these
[27:18] five-fold Ministry gifts and that they
[27:20] are for one the perfecting equipping
[27:24] giving you what you have need of okay
[27:28] for the
[27:29] ministry for the work of the ministry so
[27:32] that number two you can be an
[27:35] edification and you can be edified and
[27:39] you can receive what you have need of in
[27:41] order to bring your your your your gift
[27:45] into operation for the holy spirit so
[27:47] that so that we can grow in the unity of
[27:53] the faith in other words the body has to
[27:55] come into Perfect Harmony and perfect
[27:58] unity and you know it says all so that
[28:02] we can all come into the unity and so
[28:06] you know a lot of people will will have
[28:08] already come into certain levels of
[28:10] maturity nobody will have reached
[28:13] perfect maturity until all have come
[28:17] together in the unity because I want you
[28:20] to notice what it says here it says the
[28:22] unity of the faith in in other words the
[28:25] revelation of the body of Christ Christ
[28:28] of your position and of what the body is
[28:32] performing and fulfilling in this day
[28:35] because there's something that you are
[28:37] going to fulfill the portion of the word
[28:40] that you are going to fulfill when we
[28:41] look back from Genesis all the way to
[28:45] Revelation there's always been groups of
[28:47] individuals that are fulfilling the
[28:49] portion of the word in their particular
[28:53] day and then once that is fulfilled then
[28:56] things move move on to the next stage of
[29:00] the coming of the lord it's all based on
[29:03] and and you know if if you get a chance
[29:06] go back like I said go back and read
[29:08] Christ The Mystery of God revealed or
[29:10] listen to it or both I'll tell you
[29:13] there's a difference in listening and a
[29:16] difference in reading and then a nice
[29:19] blessing in doing both all right and
[29:22] you'll and you'll just know by your own
[29:24] experience I can't tell you but I just
[29:26] know that that you know the word just
[29:29] opens up in in so many ways when we read
[29:33] it and when we hear it all right and so
[29:37] um there's there's a portion that you
[29:39] need to fulfill and there's a portion
[29:41] and it's all bringing everything back to
[29:44] the purpose of God which is you know
[29:46] that God was going to manifest himself
[29:48] through Christ that he would have the
[29:50] preeminence in the church and this is
[29:52] what he's doing right now he is trying
[29:56] to have the preeminence Min in the
[29:58] church and by having the preeminence in
[30:00] the church he's bringing every single
[30:04] individual the faith that they need in
[30:07] order to come under subjection to the
[30:09] word of God so that they can get into
[30:11] their position for what so that we can
[30:14] increase in the knowledge of Jesus
[30:16] Christ in the revelation of his word to
[30:18] know what his purpose and his Plan of
[30:20] Redemption is all about so that we come
[30:23] into the full
[30:25] maturity of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[30:28] and that full maturity is the fullness
[30:32] of Christ it is Jesus Christ in his
[30:36] fullness in Bride form in this day and
[30:40] in this hour praise God and so the next
[30:43] slide says here brother brandham
[30:46] speaking he says putting on the whole
[30:48] armor of God now
[30:50] God fortified his army what with himself
[30:56] remember this is all all about Christ
[30:58] having the preeminence in your life so
[31:02] that you can be what he wants you to be
[31:06] and he says himself in the form of
[31:10] prophets Apostles teachers pastors what
[31:14] did he do what was God doing listen did
[31:18] you ever think what that offices of the
[31:21] church is it's God's dress remember the
[31:25] bride is making herself ready there's a
[31:29] paradox in that statement she's making
[31:32] herself ready how can she make herself
[31:35] ready when the scripture says that he's
[31:37] the one that's making you ready is
[31:40] because you're coming into a perfect
[31:42] realization by Perfect faith that you
[31:45] are the word for your day and that you
[31:48] have a part that you're going to
[31:50] manifest and by you manifesting your
[31:53] part by Revelation you're actually
[31:56] dressing
[31:58] yourself we're dressing one another in
[32:01] the body this is what we're looking at
[32:04] here so if it's God's dress inside dress
[32:09] an apostle a prophet a
[32:12] Seer for see before Satan ever gets to
[32:16] it done told it what it is see God's got
[32:20] prophets within the ministry Discerning
[32:23] the Lord's body Discerning the the the
[32:26] the things that are going to come to
[32:29] pass there's still prophets in this hour
[32:31] not major prophet like brother brandham
[32:34] but there's still the the gift of
[32:36] Prophecy and the and the prophetic
[32:39] Ministry of Jesus Christ because
[32:40] remember this whole Ministry is being
[32:43] operated by The Same Spirit it's always
[32:47] Jesus Christ amen God dressed up in his
[32:51] church these offices is God's dress wear
[32:55] when you see those offices pastors
[32:57] teachers evangelists what is that that's
[33:01] God's dresswear God's presence God's
[33:04] spirit
[33:05] and working through man praise God
[33:10] forever more and so here I want to read
[33:14] the Amplified version of the scripture
[33:16] that we read our our uh scripture for
[33:19] this
[33:20] evening and um when we look at it from
[33:25] verse
[33:25] 27
[33:27] I want you to listen closely here now
[33:30] you
[33:32] collectively are Christ's body and
[33:36] individually you are members of it each
[33:41] part severally and
[33:44] distinct each with his own place and
[33:48] function that's important now listen so
[33:52] God has appointed some in the church for
[33:55] his own use first apostles special
[34:01] Messengers second prophets inspired
[34:05] preachers and expounders of the word of
[34:08] God third
[34:11] teachers then wonderful workers Wonder
[34:16] workers it's described as here than
[34:19] those with ability to heal the sick
[34:24] helpers
[34:25] administrators
[34:28] speakers in different unknown
[34:31] tongues are all prophets special
[34:35] Messengers question mark are all
[34:38] prophets are all Apostle special
[34:40] Messengers question mark are all
[34:42] prophets inspired interpreters of the
[34:45] will and purpose of God are all teachers
[34:50] do all have the power of Performing
[34:54] miracles do all possess extraordinary
[34:58] powers of
[34:59] healing do all speak with tongues do all
[35:03] interpret these are all questions Paul
[35:06] is you know you got to understand here
[35:07] Paul was speaking to the to the Church
[35:09] of the Corinthians and and the
[35:12] Corinthians Church they had all kinds of
[35:15] things going on and they were in need of
[35:18] some serious correction and that's the
[35:21] thing today you know there's so many
[35:23] churches out there and they're all
[35:25] confused about God's gifts you got those
[35:28] in the churches there that are that are
[35:30] saying oh we need to appoint prophets we
[35:33] need to appoint Apostles we need to
[35:35] appoint evangelists we need to appoint
[35:38] healers you can't appoint those gifts
[35:43] those are gifts we read it in Ephesians
[35:45] God gives God gave God Anointed God has
[35:51] inspired and given these gifts so it's
[35:53] not something that we appoint by man or
[35:56] that we we can do ourselves this is
[35:58] something that he does so he says do all
[36:01] possess extraordinary powers of healing
[36:04] do all speak with tongues do all
[36:06] interpret but he says but earnestly
[36:08] desire and zealously
[36:11] cultivate you know when you're when
[36:14] you're cultivating something you're
[36:16] planting seed well God is cultivating in
[36:21] you and me God is cultivating God is
[36:24] bringing out in you and in each and
[36:27] every one of us the gifts that he's
[36:30] placed in our lives because these are
[36:33] things that he still operates and it's
[36:36] he's The Giver of the gift and he's the
[36:38] operator of the gift in other words the
[36:42] plant is growing organically it grows
[36:45] and feeds off of the the natural
[36:48] nutrients that are around it so that it
[36:51] can grow while the church is organic
[36:54] also in that the holy spirit is the life
[36:56] of the church and his life is what
[36:59] operates and moves through each and
[37:01] every gift specifically and in
[37:05] particular because you all have
[37:07] distinctive abilities and each and we're
[37:10] going to look at each and every one of
[37:12] you has a
[37:17] gift cultivate the greatest and the best
[37:20] gifts and
[37:22] Graces it describes it here the higher
[37:25] gifts and the choice voest Graces what's
[37:30] Grace
[37:32] Grace unmerited favor you didn't do
[37:36] anything you don't do anything to to to
[37:40] deserve God's gifts you don't do
[37:42] anything to be a gift in the Church of
[37:46] God you didn't deserve it you didn't uh
[37:49] oh I you know I I was brought up to be
[37:52] you know a a a prophet I was brought up
[37:55] to be an evang evangelist because I love
[37:57] to travel I love to travel so I must be
[38:00] an
[38:03] evangelist you know a lot of people love
[38:05] to travel and because they love to
[38:07] travel and they belong to a church they
[38:10] want to be the Evangelist in the church
[38:12] because the church will kind of support
[38:15] that Ministry but it's only if God has
[38:18] called the individual it's not him
[38:21] calling himself to the ministry it's not
[38:23] saying I'm going to be the Evangelist
[38:25] you know because I have the ability I
[38:28] have the financial capacity to travel so
[38:31] it just kind of means that I should be
[38:33] the one doing it that's not the way it
[38:37] works this is a supernatural church
[38:41] that's the difference between the church
[38:45] organizations that are that are that are
[38:47] being developed and that that that's why
[38:49] there's thousands and thousands of
[38:52] different uh you know denominations of
[38:54] churches out there and there's some that
[38:56] are filthy rich that are that that have
[38:59] more money and can do so many great
[39:02] things but guess what they're not
[39:04] operating by faith they're not operating
[39:07] under the
[39:09] true uh anointing of the spirit of God
[39:12] because it is the spirit of God that
[39:14] operates and controls and uses and
[39:19] perfects all the gifts within the body
[39:22] amen praise
[39:24] God and then Paul says you know you know
[39:27] you know uh desire to have all these
[39:29] gifts but then he goes on and he says
[39:32] and yet I will show you a still more
[39:35] excellent way one that is better by far
[39:40] and the highest of them
[39:44] all
[39:46] love praise God what he is saying here
[39:51] is that even though you
[39:55] can
[39:57] desire to have all these gifts and it's
[39:59] good it's good to desire and to and to
[40:02] be used of God because that's what it is
[40:05] you want to be used of God but what do
[40:08] you want to be used of God to do what
[40:11] part is it that that that God wants me
[40:14] to be and and to and to so that I can
[40:17] edify and nourish and and build up the
[40:21] body of Jesus
[40:22] Christ it's not something that you
[40:28] want to make yourself it's a desire to
[40:32] serve God and what Paul is saying here
[40:35] he's say he's saying I want to show you
[40:37] something that's more excellent and that
[40:39] if you can just fall in love with him if
[40:43] you can just fall in love with the word
[40:46] if you can love one
[40:49] another and and appreciate one
[40:52] another in true agape love not felio
[40:58] love not oh you know I love you because
[41:01] you love me I'm going to do this for you
[41:04] because you do this for me that's not
[41:07] the kind of love that you will find in
[41:10] the body of Christ although we do
[41:14] appreciate one another we should
[41:17] naturally appreciate when we do things
[41:21] for one another because a lot of people
[41:24] they're too spiritually minded
[41:27] and they're no earthly
[41:30] beneficial in in the way that they that
[41:33] they oh well you know um that's just you
[41:37] know you have to do that for me because
[41:40] you're a Christian and if you're a
[41:43] Christian you should be nice you should
[41:45] be good you know a lot of people want to
[41:47] put on Christianity they want to they
[41:50] want to put a false front oh I do good
[41:53] you know you talk to people and they say
[41:55] oh you know like uh uh you talk about
[41:58] the Lord and you talk about salvation
[41:59] and the first thing that you know that
[42:01] they want to say to you is that oh I I I
[42:03] do good things you know I give you know
[42:05] I I've never killed anybody you know you
[42:08] you hear this coming out I never killed
[42:10] anybody you know no you never killed
[42:12] anybody physically but you use this
[42:14] tongue over there and the Bible says
[42:17] that you say something against somebody
[42:19] it's just as much as killing them you
[42:22] see God is looking at all the aspects
[42:25] and God is looking at the real love of
[42:29] God the real purpose and the motive
[42:31] within your heart for doing what it is
[42:33] that you do in the body of Christ and we
[42:36] want to grow in such a way that we can
[42:39] come to really truly appreciate one
[42:42] another and that means to humanly
[42:45] appreciate and say thank
[42:47] you I appreciate it when somebody says
[42:50] thank you if I do something for them if
[42:54] I go out of my way to do something
[42:56] uh you know and and I'm doing it it's
[42:59] not that I'm expecting it but when they
[43:01] say it it just edifies me and I know
[43:06] that it does the same for you because
[43:08] you're human you like to be you know
[43:11] acknowledged you like to be appreciated
[43:14] you that's part of you know being part
[43:17] human and a son of God because that's
[43:20] the Paradox remember we talked about it
[43:22] last week it's a paradox to be a Son of
[43:25] God and also to be a human being because
[43:27] you still got to deal with the with the
[43:29] with the Realms of this flesh and
[43:31] everything that we've got to deal with
[43:33] in dealing with one another and one
[43:36] another's characters and and shaping and
[43:39] rubbing and you know as iron sharpeneth
[43:43] you know these things like this is all
[43:46] part of the body coming into that
[43:48] perfect Unity of the love of God because
[43:51] we need to we need to shave off some of
[43:54] the things that you know that that are
[43:56] that are raw that are that are not the
[43:58] kind of things that are going to
[43:59] strengthen and edify the body of Christ
[44:02] so we need to be spiritually and
[44:05] physically balanced in our thinking so
[44:09] that we can operate as a church in human
[44:13] bodies and as sons of God in the
[44:17] Supernatural elements of the gifts that
[44:20] God has placed within our
[44:22] lives amen praise God and so let's let's
[44:26] go to the next
[44:30] slide so tonight what we're looking at
[44:33] is the
[44:34] diversities of gifts but understanding
[44:38] that it's the same spirit it's always
[44:41] the Holy Spirit that's operating and
[44:43] moving and and uh uh doing what it is
[44:47] that he does in each and every one of
[44:48] our Lives let's go to the next slide
[44:50] let's read First
[44:51] Corinthians um because what we're doing
[44:54] is we're actually looking at the the the
[44:57] book of Corinthians chapter 12 because
[45:00] it's in there that we receive a lot of
[45:03] instruction uh Paul you know speaking to
[45:05] the church so let's read the scripture
[45:07] he says here now concerning spiritual
[45:09] gifts Brethren I would not have you
[45:14] ignorant so he's he's he's he's rebuking
[45:18] the people as what he's doing you got to
[45:20] understand that opening statement it's
[45:22] like a rebuke to the people because the
[45:24] Corinthian Church they needed to be
[45:26] corrected they needed to be you know um
[45:29] uh brought back into a a level you know
[45:34] spirit and a level mind and a level way
[45:37] of dealing with the supernatural
[45:40] anointing that's that that's come down
[45:42] upon them because Paul knew that the
[45:44] spirit of God was moving there was no
[45:46] question that the spirit of God was
[45:47] moving and that people were actually
[45:50] displaying gifts and you know when you
[45:52] read through it you'll you'll see how
[45:53] Paul's you know you know correcting them
[45:55] and rebuking them about tongues and this
[45:57] and that but let's just look at it he
[45:58] says I don't want you to be ignorant you
[46:01] know that ye were Gentiles he this is
[46:04] all
[46:05] rebuking and we can look at this and we
[46:08] can see how it relates to us you you all
[46:11] were Gentiles carried away unto these
[46:14] dumb Idols you know like he's just
[46:16] speaking plain here he says you had a
[46:18] bunch of dumb Idols you you had them
[46:21] hanging in your cars and you got you
[46:23] know all these statues that you pray to
[46:25] and you know you've got all these Pagan
[46:28] you know uh teachings and upbringings
[46:30] that that you that you used to operate
[46:32] with because they were the Greeks and
[46:33] they had all kinds of different you know
[46:36] idols and they like to kiss idols and
[46:39] you know kiss statues and this and that
[46:41] he says he says you were Gentiles and
[46:43] you were carried away with these Idols
[46:45] even as you were LED wherefore I give to
[46:48] you to understand that no man speaking
[46:51] by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a
[46:54] cursed in other words he was telling
[46:56] them that you think you got the Holy
[46:58] Ghost just like a lot of the churches
[47:01] that are out there they call themselves
[47:02] Christian churches and yet they want to
[47:05] tell you that Jesus Christ is one in
[47:08] three Gods he's in a
[47:11] trinity and you if you've got the spirit
[47:14] of the Holy Ghost there is no way the
[47:17] spirit of the Holy Ghost is going to
[47:18] tell you to go and pray and say 10 hell
[47:22] mares it's just nowhere in the
[47:24] scripture because if you've got the Holy
[47:27] Spirit and the Holy Spirit is directing
[47:30] and guiding and leading that church it
[47:32] cannot curse the word of God and to say
[47:36] anything and to tell people to go and do
[47:39] things that are contrary to the word of
[47:41] God have no Foundation of who Jesus
[47:43] Christ actually is they're actually
[47:46] cursing the word and they don't know it
[47:51] they're speaking Blasphemous things
[47:53] against the word of God and they don't
[47:55] know know it why because of their
[47:57] teachings because of their traditions
[48:01] because of their Pagan understanding on
[48:03] the word of God they were brought up to
[48:06] to to to worship idols and to worship
[48:08] people instead of worshiping
[48:12] Christ people will take a man's word
[48:16] over the word of
[48:18] God and that is exactly contrary that
[48:21] that speaking by the spirit of God
[48:23] calleth Jesus Cur and that no man can
[48:26] say that Jesus Christ is the
[48:29] Lord but by the Holy Ghost so he was
[48:32] rebuking them and saying guess what a
[48:35] lot of you don't even got the Holy Ghost
[48:38] because you don't even know who the Lord
[48:40] Jesus Christ actually is if you had the
[48:44] spirit of God and you had the Holy Ghost
[48:46] you would know that the spirit of God is
[48:49] God that Jesus Christ is God that the
[48:53] father is God that the there's only hear
[48:56] ye oh Israel the Lord thy God is one not
[49:01] two or three if you're going to be
[49:04] baptized you need to be baptized in the
[49:06] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[49:09] remission of your sins we don't baptize
[49:11] babies how does a baby believe how does
[49:14] a baby repent because it says repent and
[49:18] be
[49:19] baptized he that Jesus said he that
[49:23] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[49:28] so how do you take a baby put him into
[49:30] the water or how you how do you just
[49:32] take anybody that comes to the altar
[49:35] while you're preaching the trinity in
[49:37] the name of the father and of the son
[49:38] and of the Holy Spirit they don't even
[49:40] have a revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[49:44] if you're gonna if you're the bride if
[49:46] you're the if you're the church and
[49:48] you're the bride when a bride goes to
[49:50] the altar the bride takes her husband's
[49:53] name she doesn't take his
[49:57] title like if I'm if I like I am the CEO
[50:01] of a company but if somebody you know if
[50:05] I'm GNA marry my wife and she comes to
[50:07] the altar uh you know uh do you Jennifer
[50:11] take the CEO of this company to be your
[50:15] husband that's a title you're going to
[50:19] take the name I am a human being I'm a
[50:22] son I got a father and a mother but
[50:25] those are not my name those are my
[50:29] titles those are those are uh uh what I
[50:33] represent I represent a father I
[50:36] represent a son I represent a husband
[50:40] but my name is Danny and Jesus the Bible
[50:44] says there is no other name that man
[50:47] must be saved by but by the name of
[50:51] Jesus Christ you see this is all simple
[50:56] abcs on the word of God but how are you
[50:59] going to the reason why Paul is rebuking
[51:02] them is how are you going to actually be
[51:05] effective in the body of Christ as a
[51:09] True
[51:10] Believer without the holy spirit because
[51:13] it's the holy spirit that operates the
[51:16] gifts so we see here now there are and
[51:20] then he goes and he says but the H but
[51:22] by the Holy Ghost you cannot no man
[51:25] calleth Jesus a cursed and no man can
[51:27] say that Jesus is the Lord but by the
[51:30] Holy Ghost and then he says now there
[51:32] are diversities of gifts but the same
[51:37] spirit all in one paragraph he rebukes
[51:41] them tells them that you don't even know
[51:43] that you got the Holy Ghost and what
[51:45] even the Holy Ghost is and then he goes
[51:48] and he and he ends it by saying and by
[51:50] the way all those gifts that are
[51:52] manifesting amongst
[51:54] you there their diversity there's all
[51:57] kinds of gifts but they operate by one
[52:00] Spirit but in this
[52:03] church you guys are being controlled by
[52:06] Devils a lot of you are operating under
[52:09] under different Spirits because it's not
[52:12] the spirit of God that can go against
[52:14] the word of God and say I am the Lord
[52:19] and yet reject the baptism in jesus'
[52:22] name reject the godhead
[52:26] reject all all the the the the
[52:28] foundational teachings of the word of
[52:31] God and claim that they're operating the
[52:35] gifts just doesn't work that way so in
[52:39] in um let's go to the next
[52:41] slide so so what we're looking at here
[52:44] is we're looking at a study of the of
[52:45] the book of First Corinthians chapter 12
[52:48] and then go to the next slide and and
[52:50] one thing that um you know in passing
[52:53] here Paul in his opening statement he
[52:56] said um that he does not want Christians
[52:59] to be
[53:00] ignorant and when you look into the
[53:02] scriptures there's three times where it
[53:04] talks about don't be ignorant and and
[53:08] just this is just in passing this was
[53:09] something that I thought I would bring
[53:11] and it says don't be ignorant of God's
[53:13] plan for Israel if you read Romans 11:
[53:18] 25 be not ignorant regarding Israel
[53:22] Israel is God's time piece Israel
[53:26] has been in the scriptures right from
[53:29] the book of Genesis and right to the
[53:31] very end the Book of Revelations when he
[53:34] calls the
[53:36] 144,000 everything that that that
[53:39] happened throughout the 6,000 years that
[53:42] we've been on this Earth has been
[53:44] surrounding the nation of Israel God
[53:48] used it as a focal point in order to
[53:52] bring his mind and revelation on his
[53:56] Plan of
[53:57] Redemption remember everything is based
[54:00] on God's
[54:02] interpretation God is his own
[54:04] interpreter why God chose Israel that's
[54:07] God's choice that's God's word God has
[54:11] the preeminence in the body of Christ
[54:13] that's his plan that's the way he did it
[54:16] from the beginning that's the way he's
[54:18] going to do it right into the end who
[54:19] are we to rebel and to tell god well why
[54:22] did you choose Israel to to give the
[54:25] land to and why didn't you choose the
[54:28] Germans or why didn't you choose the
[54:30] Italians or why didn't you no God has a
[54:33] plan God has a purpose and we need to
[54:36] not be ignorant of
[54:39] that so in other words don't let the
[54:43] things that are happening in the world
[54:45] bypass you but look through the
[54:48] scriptures and see how it fulfills and
[54:52] lines up with the word of God the next
[54:54] part he says be not ignorant about
[54:57] spiritual gifts okay because and this is
[54:59] what we're going to be looking at and
[55:01] then he says thirdly don't be ignorant
[55:03] about the second coming of Jesus Christ
[55:06] and the Eternal state in from first
[55:09] Thessalonians that we need to recognize
[55:12] and not be ignorant that Christ has
[55:15] already
[55:16] come he's here now a lot of people
[55:20] unfortunately many Christians are
[55:22] ignorant on these three examp exact
[55:25] points they don't want to acknowledge
[55:27] Israel they don't want to acknowledge
[55:30] that God has a part in Israel and is
[55:32] using them as a type and as a Time piece
[55:36] on what he's going to do because he used
[55:38] years and times and Seasons around the
[55:41] nation of Israel watch when the Fig Tree
[55:44] puts forth its figs watch when Israel
[55:46] goes back into its Homeland all these
[55:49] things all these things happened
[55:51] supernaturally after 2,000 over 2500
[55:54] years Israel finds itself
[55:57] back in its
[55:59] Homeland that wasn't just a coincidence
[56:02] that was God's plan it was prophesied
[56:04] thousands of years ago that it was going
[56:07] to happen and God did it supernaturally
[56:09] a lot of people think all you know World
[56:12] War II is what forced Israel into their
[56:14] Homeland no no God's plan allowed World
[56:18] War to to bring Israel back into their
[56:22] Homeland okay God's plan plan overrides
[56:26] everything remember God is his own
[56:28] interpreter he will make it plain amen
[56:31] praise God but a lot of people are
[56:33] ignorant of these things and and
[56:36] especially these three areas is you know
[56:39] is what surrounds the whole church
[56:41] because everybody's waiting on the
[56:42] coming of the
[56:44] Lord everybody's waiting on the second
[56:46] coming of the Lord wait till the second
[56:48] coming of the Lord meanwhile he's
[56:50] already come and he's here and he's in a
[56:52] body and he's trying to have the
[56:54] preeminence in his church because every
[56:57] time that he would come to the church
[57:00] through the Dark Ages and then through
[57:02] the Reformation he would get kicked out
[57:04] of the church because man would start to
[57:08] introduce their own ideas their own
[57:11] doctrines you
[57:13] know their own ways of interpreting the
[57:16] word of God they they made him a trinity
[57:18] they the the Jova witness they make him
[57:21] Mighty God almighty God they you know
[57:25] there's all kinds of interpretations and
[57:28] whenever you
[57:30] put
[57:33] anything to interpret the word of God
[57:36] beyond what the word says you are
[57:41] committing spiritual idolatry against
[57:44] the word of
[57:45] God it's as simple as that it's as
[57:49] simple as when a woman takes another man
[57:52] while her husband still lives
[57:55] she's she's actually taking and going
[57:59] into idolatry scripturally it's all
[58:02] types and shadows and when somebody
[58:06] takes a man's interpretation on the word
[58:09] of God instead of God's word they are
[58:12] going against the word of God and that
[58:14] is a form of idolatry they're taking
[58:16] another man's seed another man see Jesus
[58:20] is the word and his word is what he is
[58:24] given to us and his word is his seed and
[58:28] that's why you know we can read in the
[58:30] scriptures on that day many shall come
[58:32] to him and say Lord Lord have I not done
[58:35] this in in your name have I not cast out
[58:37] devils and he's going to look at them
[58:39] and say I never knew you when you go
[58:42] back to Genesis and you read about where
[58:46] Adam knew his wife that was when a man
[58:51] comes together with a woman and places
[58:54] his seat seed in that woman that is he's
[58:58] impregnating her with his seed to bring
[59:01] forth another life well Christ pregnat
[59:05] us with his word which is his seed and
[59:10] it brings forth Jesus Christ it brings
[59:14] forth another son or daughter of God
[59:17] because it comes from God but when you
[59:20] impregnate it with a doctrine of another
[59:23] man and you take take on the teaching of
[59:25] another man you're going to bring forth
[59:29] the teachings and the seed of that other
[59:33] Doctrine and that's why it'll bring the
[59:36] birth of denominational churches other
[59:39] churches the Bible talks about it in the
[59:41] Book of Revelation as
[59:45] harlots harlots the mother church and
[59:49] its harlots in other words they're
[59:53] churches that have been birthed
[59:55] by man's teachings man's interpretations
[59:58] which are contrary to the word of God
[1:00:02] you see the Simplicity of that you see
[1:00:05] how it is that they've gone off the word
[1:00:07] by taking another Doctrine or teaching
[1:00:11] or they wna they want to they want to
[1:00:13] have saints here on the earth and they
[1:00:15] want to worship man and they want to
[1:00:18] worship Bishops they want to worship
[1:00:20] popes you got to worship the word of God
[1:00:24] let the word be your absolute there is
[1:00:27] no other absolute but the word of God
[1:00:31] Amen praise God H Allelujah and so he
[1:00:34] wanted them to not be ignorant of these
[1:00:38] things and uh so that that just you know
[1:00:41] in in uh in passing there but um if when
[1:00:45] we're looking at um at the at the at the
[1:00:47] word okay we're looking at 1 Corinthians
[1:00:50] chapter 12 we want to look at the
[1:00:53] understanding
[1:00:56] um and that we must have a revelation so
[1:00:59] the first thing is that we must have a
[1:01:01] revelation of Christ the word in our day
[1:01:05] okay and that's you know we we've
[1:01:07] covered that that part here in in what
[1:01:10] um in the comments that I've made amen
[1:01:13] but now I want to look at the
[1:01:14] diversities of gifts and understand that
[1:01:18] it's all the same Spirit there are
[1:01:20] differences of Ministries but the same
[1:01:23] Lord amen and there are diversities and
[1:01:27] activities but it's all the same God who
[1:01:30] works all in all amen praise God
[1:01:35] hallelujah and so when we're looking at
[1:01:37] these diversities of gifts Paul he goes
[1:01:40] on and he's going to go on and you know
[1:01:42] when we get into this chapter here we're
[1:01:44] going to see that there's nine different
[1:01:47] spiritual gifts that are mentioned here
[1:01:49] but there are still many other gifts
[1:01:52] outside of those nine spiritual gifts
[1:01:56] because we need to understand that the
[1:01:58] body of Christ when it's when it's the
[1:02:01] supernatural body there are so many
[1:02:03] parts in the body of CH we don't just
[1:02:05] have nine you know nine elements to our
[1:02:09] body there's there's thousands of
[1:02:11] elements to our body there's a lot of
[1:02:14] elements that we see and a lot of
[1:02:15] elements that we don't see and we need
[1:02:18] to realize that they all have an
[1:02:19] important part and if you can recognize
[1:02:23] that then then you'll you'll realize
[1:02:25] that you know you won't be left in a in
[1:02:28] a condition where you don't know if
[1:02:31] you're a part of the body of Christ
[1:02:34] there's going to be certain natural
[1:02:36] things that are within your life where
[1:02:38] you will know that you are naturally
[1:02:41] gifted and you will you will organically
[1:02:44] move into those positions amen praise
[1:02:47] God so diversity of gifts but the Same
[1:02:50] Spirit the gifts are diverse the
[1:02:52] Ministries are different and the
[1:02:54] activities are also different so you
[1:02:58] know you might have a gift of of um of
[1:03:02] cleaning and that gift of cleaning you
[1:03:05] know as a deacon might be to clean
[1:03:09] Spirits out of the
[1:03:10] church you see the gifts operate
[1:03:13] organically they operate by the spirit
[1:03:15] of God and so it's it's not just the way
[1:03:19] that we want to interpret the gifts we
[1:03:23] do have these m your gifts of Prophet
[1:03:26] evangelist those things will
[1:03:28] predominantly show themselves pastors
[1:03:31] teachers they will they will be clear
[1:03:33] those are things that that that actually
[1:03:36] supernaturally feed control and govern
[1:03:40] the body of Jesus Christ but then there
[1:03:42] are things that are within the body that
[1:03:45] just naturally and organically operate
[1:03:48] and move and do things that edify and
[1:03:52] nourish and strengthen the body of
[1:03:55] Christ now when we look at at different
[1:03:59] activities when we look at
[1:04:00] activity the the word
[1:04:03] activity is comes from the word
[1:04:07] ener
[1:04:08] jamata
[1:04:11] enata okay in the
[1:04:13] Greek now when we look at that word it
[1:04:17] means it's where we derive the words
[1:04:20] energy energetic energize from so it is
[1:04:24] the the word of active miraculous power
[1:04:28] so when somebody is you know oh man you
[1:04:30] you you got a lot of energy you know God
[1:04:33] is going to place individuals within the
[1:04:35] body of Christ that are going to be
[1:04:37] energized they're going to be people
[1:04:39] that that start things people that are
[1:04:42] that are good at at getting things
[1:04:44] started because you know like in in
[1:04:46] every body there's you know there's
[1:04:49] individuals that just like to sit back
[1:04:51] and they like to be led because they're
[1:04:54] just more the kind of people that need
[1:04:58] instruction they need to be led and
[1:05:00] that's okay and when you're in that kind
[1:05:04] of a position where you're okay to be
[1:05:06] led and you allow the spirit of God to
[1:05:09] use the governments within the church to
[1:05:11] lead you then you can you can be a great
[1:05:15] benefit to the body of Christ but when
[1:05:19] you're a lazy person and then somebody
[1:05:22] comes and asks you to do something
[1:05:24] and you Rebel and you don't want to do
[1:05:27] it then how is it that you're fitting
[1:05:30] into the body of Christ you see
[1:05:35] um this interprets
[1:05:38] itself this this action within the body
[1:05:42] of Christ and all the gifts and all the
[1:05:45] the aspects of the body they're not
[1:05:47] something that we have to constantly um
[1:05:50] you know push and shove if we can all
[1:05:54] all come into the unity of the faith in
[1:05:56] this area and we can all come into the
[1:05:59] understanding that the body has parts
[1:06:03] that that that work and operate in
[1:06:05] certain ways and understand it in love
[1:06:09] and we and we we project love into every
[1:06:13] situation then everything works so much
[1:06:17] better and so much more
[1:06:20] Supernatural amen it does require for us
[1:06:23] to be polite in the way that we you
[1:06:26] don't go to somebody and say Hey you
[1:06:27] lazy bum why aren't you at church
[1:06:30] cleaning on Saturdays that's not the way
[1:06:33] you do
[1:06:37] it there's a way of communicating and
[1:06:39] there's a way of of of appreciating and
[1:06:43] building up and
[1:06:45] edifying and encouraging the body of
[1:06:49] Christ this is about encouraging you
[1:06:52] might have you you might have the spirit
[1:06:55] of discernment on your life there are
[1:06:57] things listen as a deacon God placed me
[1:07:01] as a deacon within the ministry God
[1:07:04] supernaturally allows me to see things I
[1:07:08] I'm just I don't I can't explain to you
[1:07:10] how I discern the things that I discern
[1:07:13] you can't you can't you know Philip
[1:07:15] could not explain to you how it how it
[1:07:17] works how the gifts operate and how it
[1:07:19] is that the Holy Spirit but it's just
[1:07:22] things that supernaturally are revealed
[1:07:25] and it's part of the gift it's part of
[1:07:27] the calling it's part of the position in
[1:07:29] the body of Christ and when you know as
[1:07:33] a deacon and as you know part of the
[1:07:35] leadership and part of the governance of
[1:07:37] the body it's my position to direct and
[1:07:41] to guide and to correct the spirits that
[1:07:44] are within the church and sometimes the
[1:07:47] Lord will show that's why we ask you to
[1:07:50] go to your Deacon we want to allow the
[1:07:53] body to off operate organically the way
[1:07:56] it's supposed to operate and when we
[1:07:59] allow it to operate in that way
[1:08:01] everybody gets
[1:08:03] edified there's no schisms there's no oh
[1:08:07] well he talked to me that way and you
[1:08:09] know he came in and he spoke to me that
[1:08:11] way and he shouldn't be using that tone
[1:08:13] with me and this and that no listen
[1:08:15] sometimes the you got to remember
[1:08:18] everybody's got their National
[1:08:20] upbringings and you know some people
[1:08:22] have you know ways of communicating the
[1:08:24] way they the way they speak things uh
[1:08:27] you know that that seem to be you know
[1:08:30] maybe not the way you like to receive it
[1:08:32] but understand that if you stay humble
[1:08:35] and you don't Rebel and you just allow
[1:08:38] the spirit of God to deal with it God
[1:08:41] will correct even the highest office in
[1:08:44] the church that's why it's not your
[1:08:48] position to go and correct a higher
[1:08:51] position that's not the way it works
[1:08:55] it doesn't work that way under the
[1:08:57] authority of the Holy Spirit it says be
[1:08:59] subject one to another it talks about
[1:09:01] being respectful unto the Elders of the
[1:09:04] church and understanding the authorities
[1:09:07] and the positions that God has placed
[1:09:09] each and everyone in and when we
[1:09:11] recognize that then we approach it in a
[1:09:14] different way and we allow the
[1:09:16] supernatural to take control in the
[1:09:19] whole situation and so if the person was
[1:09:22] not right in the way that they dealt
[1:09:24] with the situation don't worry God will
[1:09:28] correct it God will deal with it through
[1:09:30] the
[1:09:32] offices that are within the body of
[1:09:34] Christ in the right way and when it's
[1:09:37] done that way everybody
[1:09:41] profits Hallelujah so here we're looking
[1:09:44] at the word
[1:09:45] enera okay it's the energy it's the
[1:09:49] supernatural power of the holy ghost
[1:09:51] that comes in to those different gifts
[1:09:54] that are within the ministry to bring
[1:09:56] them into their proper position to give
[1:09:58] them the energy and the and the faith
[1:10:01] and the and the uh understanding and the
[1:10:04] knowledge on how to operate in that
[1:10:07] position amen it's a so we've got a
[1:10:10] supernatural energy that that God moves
[1:10:14] through the church it's all the Holy
[1:10:15] Ghost but it's in the diversities it's
[1:10:18] in the ways it's the don't put your own
[1:10:20] interpretation on how the holy spirit is
[1:10:23] going to move and deal with whatever it
[1:10:26] is that he needs to deal with within the
[1:10:28] church this is Bible study tonight
[1:10:32] right amen praise God these are things
[1:10:35] that we need to understand these are
[1:10:37] these are things that you know like I'm
[1:10:39] being blessed by these by these
[1:10:41] reminders in the scripture and by
[1:10:43] allowing the Holy Spirit to to give us
[1:10:46] the interpretation by his spirit amen
[1:10:49] praise God and so there's these gifts
[1:10:53] there there's these Ministries there's
[1:10:54] these different diversities amen and we
[1:10:57] need to understand how the manifestation
[1:11:00] of the spirit operates and moves it has
[1:11:04] a way of Performing and operating in
[1:11:08] these offices within the church amen and
[1:11:11] and God will will call individuals and
[1:11:15] and give to them the supernatural
[1:11:18] ability to operate those gifts when he
[1:11:23] wants to do
[1:11:25] it it's when he wants to do
[1:11:29] it praise God
[1:11:32] hallelujah
[1:11:35] amen so there's there's you know
[1:11:38] different
[1:11:40] varieties and and uh we need to
[1:11:43] understand that God has made up the body
[1:11:45] with different varieties of individuals
[1:11:48] we're not all clones we're not all the
[1:11:51] same there's people here from from
[1:11:54] different cultures Africa
[1:11:57] Trinidad
[1:11:58] Jamaica you know uh England we've got
[1:12:02] Italian we've got we've got all kinds of
[1:12:05] different backgrounds and each each
[1:12:08] nationality has its own National Spirit
[1:12:11] you know some cultures are very
[1:12:14] hospitable they're always thinking about
[1:12:16] the other person you know if you ever
[1:12:18] come you know well now you know my
[1:12:20] parents are in a in a home now they're
[1:12:22] in a community but even when I go there
[1:12:24] my mother the first thing she says to me
[1:12:26] you want something to eat that's the
[1:12:28] first thing she always says come on
[1:12:29] let's go and get something to eat I said
[1:12:32] Ma I just ate we're going to eat in a
[1:12:33] couple hours let's sit down and let's
[1:12:35] talk for a little while okay all right
[1:12:37] 10 minutes later did you want something
[1:12:39] to
[1:12:40] eat it's it's the culture okay some
[1:12:45] places you'll go there and you want
[1:12:47] something to eat and they'll never
[1:12:48] mention a word about
[1:12:52] eating but we we need to understand that
[1:12:55] this is what we're dealing with within
[1:12:57] the body of Christ that we're not all
[1:13:00] going to be because everybody is called
[1:13:03] to the church and comes into the church
[1:13:06] not everybody's going to operate in the
[1:13:08] same way there's going to be diversities
[1:13:12] of how those particular gifts so two
[1:13:15] people can have the same
[1:13:18] gift of of of tongues for example okay
[1:13:23] okay but yet one has the gift of
[1:13:27] speaking in
[1:13:28] tongues and interpreting the
[1:13:32] tongues and one has only the gift of
[1:13:35] interpreting the tongues but it's all
[1:13:37] around the gift of tongues you see but
[1:13:40] we need to understand that those are the
[1:13:43] way these gifts operate and how God has
[1:13:47] designed and and made up each and every
[1:13:50] one of us in such a peculiar way that's
[1:13:53] why the scripture said in particular
[1:13:56] members of the body and he added in
[1:14:01] particular Allelujah so when we look at
[1:14:04] these different
[1:14:06] manifestations there's there's you know
[1:14:08] where um there's there's the gift for
[1:14:13] example the gift of uh
[1:14:18] prophecy
[1:14:20] okay that's a gift that God gives
[1:14:24] in order to bring
[1:14:26] Clarity future events bring Clarity on
[1:14:29] the direction of the church how it's how
[1:14:32] it's going to fit into the uh the the
[1:14:35] the the the prophecy that's now taking
[1:14:38] place it you know that that Spirit of
[1:14:41] Prophecy can come upon the pastor can
[1:14:43] come upon the minister that's that
[1:14:46] that's ministering can come upon the
[1:14:48] Evangelist it's God's spirit at any time
[1:14:51] he can prophesy and and bring H you know
[1:14:55] his interpretation and and Direction on
[1:14:59] Guiding and leading the church in a
[1:15:01] supernatural way it's it's understanding
[1:15:04] that these gifts are not just isolated
[1:15:07] to one individual it's organic it's God
[1:15:10] in his body it's God in his church
[1:15:13] anytime he wants to move we don't put
[1:15:16] any restraints on the Holy Ghost if the
[1:15:19] holy spirit all of a sudden wanted to
[1:15:21] speak and and and you know use this
[1:15:24] brother gersam here all of a sudden he
[1:15:26] gets anointed to stand up and to speak
[1:15:28] in tongues and interpret the word of God
[1:15:31] if it lines up with the word of God and
[1:15:33] then it's tested through the ministry by
[1:15:35] a by by the witness of three or two or
[1:15:38] three within the church then that gift
[1:15:41] has to be recognized and has to be um uh
[1:15:46] acknowledged as being the spirit of God
[1:15:48] because what he says comes to pass it's
[1:15:51] not what he says it's what the SP spirit
[1:15:53] is saying and so we need to keep things
[1:15:56] in their proper order and that's why
[1:15:58] when somebody speaks in
[1:16:00] tongues you could have a gift of
[1:16:02] speaking in tongues but if there's no
[1:16:04] interpretation Paul says you better keep
[1:16:06] silent because you're going to confuse
[1:16:08] the people because the people are
[1:16:10] looking to hear what the interpretation
[1:16:12] is and and for for some reason they're
[1:16:15] not getting any interpretation and so
[1:16:18] it's more where you got to know if
[1:16:20] you've got the gift then you've got to
[1:16:22] allow the Holy Spirit to truly operate
[1:16:25] the gift not just to speak in tongues I
[1:16:28] speak in tongues when I pray sometimes
[1:16:31] but it doesn't mean that there's an
[1:16:32] interpretation there no that's that's
[1:16:34] because there's such a commun
[1:16:36] communication going on in prayer at that
[1:16:39] moment that the that the language
[1:16:41] becomes unknown and it's and it's
[1:16:44] something that God is drawing and
[1:16:46] pulling out of you as an individual in a
[1:16:49] in a in a supernatural way in
[1:16:52] communicating
[1:16:53] and there's a there's there's a Euphoria
[1:16:56] and there's a revelation that will
[1:16:58] usually manifest after it happens and
[1:17:02] you will know as an individual you will
[1:17:05] not be left in confusion amen praise
[1:17:08] God and so we need to understand that
[1:17:11] these gifts that God has placed within
[1:17:14] the church they're not just for you
[1:17:18] because you have the gift it's to profit
[1:17:22] all that are within the church the gift
[1:17:26] needs to profit and is for the purpose
[1:17:30] of profiting
[1:17:32] all and God has given you a specific
[1:17:36] ability to operate in that gift God has
[1:17:40] designed you and made you in such a way
[1:17:42] that nobody else can take your
[1:17:46] place as the attribute of
[1:17:49] God that's why your diversity the way
[1:17:53] that God uses you will be
[1:17:55] unique in that he uses you in that
[1:17:59] particular way let's look at the next
[1:18:01] slide
[1:18:02] here so we're looking at diversities of
[1:18:05] gifts and now we want to look at um
[1:18:07] nobody can take your place and let's go
[1:18:09] to the next slide here there's a quote
[1:18:11] here from Brother brandham when God has
[1:18:13] called a person for a job to do there is
[1:18:17] no one can take its place nobody can
[1:18:22] take your place
[1:18:23] remember you are a member of the body in
[1:18:27] particular okay you are unique you are
[1:18:31] gifted you are here for a purpose and
[1:18:35] the Holy Spirit by the preaching of the
[1:18:37] word is going to place you positionally
[1:18:40] into that gift that's what that's what
[1:18:41] this whole series is all about I've got
[1:18:45] so much I've got so many notes and so
[1:18:47] many areas that the holy spirit's been
[1:18:49] leading me into but I'm realizing that
[1:18:52] that it's got to be done in a proper
[1:18:53] order and I just got to allow the spirit
[1:18:55] of God to to you know lay in these
[1:18:58] foundations I know these are things
[1:19:00] we've read but but through it God is is
[1:19:03] speaking and dealing with individuals
[1:19:06] not just people that are here but
[1:19:07] there's people that are online that are
[1:19:09] listening in that may may not understand
[1:19:12] what it is to truly be in the body of
[1:19:14] Jesus Christ and to be used of God and
[1:19:17] to be placed there with a gift for the
[1:19:20] use of the Holy Spirit he says here
[1:19:23] there is no one can take its place there
[1:19:25] is no one can take your place your
[1:19:32] peculiarity there it is okay how often I
[1:19:37] have wondered how I would like to take
[1:19:39] oral Robert's Place how I would like to
[1:19:42] take Billy Graham's place somebody like
[1:19:45] that like Billy Graham go speak to an
[1:19:48] audience of people call Sinners to the
[1:19:50] altar forget it and go home
[1:19:53] and have and not have to stand there and
[1:19:55] wrestle
[1:19:58] again I cannot be Billy Graham but
[1:20:01] neither can Billy Graham be me see
[1:20:05] nobody no nobody could be brother
[1:20:07] brandham brother brandham was the 20th
[1:20:09] century Prophet you know at his when he
[1:20:13] was here on Earth there was two other
[1:20:15] Messengers and here it is again these
[1:20:18] are all the types and shadows that are
[1:20:20] within the scriptures we're not going to
[1:20:22] we're not going to get into all of that
[1:20:23] but just briefly brother Bram he was he
[1:20:26] was the messenger of Malachi 4:5 the the
[1:20:29] one that the that would come under the
[1:20:31] spirit of Elijah to turn the hearts of
[1:20:34] the children back to the faith of the
[1:20:35] fathers but Billy Graham and all Roberts
[1:20:39] they were to the the the nominal
[1:20:41] churches one was out to the Pentecostals
[1:20:43] the other one was all to the Protestant
[1:20:44] churches worldwide and that's why Billy
[1:20:47] Graham had such a worldwide Ministry
[1:20:49] that's why Oral Roberts had a huge
[1:20:51] Ministry in the Pentecostal Realms they
[1:20:53] had special Ministries and each had
[1:20:56] their calling brother bram's calling was
[1:20:59] for the for the the original church back
[1:21:03] to the original
[1:21:05] word and that's why those other
[1:21:08] denominations that that came out of Oral
[1:21:10] Roberts teachings and Billy Graham's
[1:21:13] they you go and you go into studying all
[1:21:15] of their their teachings and everything
[1:21:17] else and it's all full of oness Tess
[1:21:23] itarian they've got all kinds of
[1:21:25] different teachings on the word of God
[1:21:28] they've made man you know special
[1:21:31] evangelists and they they've you know
[1:21:33] put titles on man and everything else
[1:21:36] when the Holy Ghost he's the only one
[1:21:39] that vindicates his word and confirms
[1:21:41] his word and that's why brother brandham
[1:21:43] here was talking about you know that he
[1:21:45] could not take their places just like
[1:21:47] they could not take his place he was the
[1:21:50] one called to fulfill Malachi 4 5
[1:21:53] Revelations 10:7 he says but neither can
[1:21:56] Billy Graham be me we are both I cannot
[1:21:59] be Oral Roberts or Roberts cannot be me
[1:22:02] you're each one set in God's economy
[1:22:06] just for its place one fasts all the
[1:22:10] time and communes with God while another
[1:22:13] one casts out Devils because this one is
[1:22:15] fasting but it's the whole body of
[1:22:18] Christ working together the unity you
[1:22:23] see it's all about the unity of the body
[1:22:27] not Unity of becoming clannish and you
[1:22:30] know you know just hanging around with
[1:22:32] certain people and you know uh being
[1:22:34] clannish brother brah says don't do that
[1:22:37] don't be clannish don't be you know
[1:22:39] separating yourselves and making
[1:22:41] yourselves you know well I I got more
[1:22:43] Revelation than them so I'm going to
[1:22:45] hang around with the people that got
[1:22:46] more Revelation and I'm not going to
[1:22:48] hang around with the people that you
[1:22:49] know that are that are you know oh they
[1:22:51] they just you know they they don't have
[1:22:53] as much re no that's that's
[1:22:56] arrogance that's not in the body of
[1:22:58] Christ there's Fellowship in the word of
[1:23:01] God and when we truly come to a place
[1:23:05] every single one of us every now and
[1:23:07] then we need to come down from our high
[1:23:09] horse sometimes God gives us so much
[1:23:11] Revelation that we're that we're moving
[1:23:13] in the Realms of faith that we get to
[1:23:15] where we we feel we don't need anybody
[1:23:17] else we don't need to fellowship with
[1:23:18] anybody else I don't need anybody to
[1:23:20] teach me about the word of God I got got
[1:23:22] the spirit of God inside of me and I and
[1:23:24] everything I need God is just going to
[1:23:26] give it to me
[1:23:27] supernaturally yes that's the way God
[1:23:29] works supernaturally but the moment that
[1:23:31] you make yourself an island you're going
[1:23:34] to be surrounded by
[1:23:35] sharks and you're going to find yourself
[1:23:38] in a situation where you're going to
[1:23:40] feel alone you're going to feel like you
[1:23:42] you don't have the God can lift the
[1:23:44] anointing at any time that he wants to
[1:23:46] on your life did you know
[1:23:49] that at any moment God can fill you and
[1:23:52] and and and re-baptize you with his
[1:23:54] spirit in his presence and and put upon
[1:23:57] you the spirit of
[1:23:58] wisdom and all of a sudden you can speak
[1:24:01] to situations and wisdom comes into you
[1:24:04] that's another gift that you know one of
[1:24:06] the spiritual gifts but wisdom is not
[1:24:09] looking at somebody and saying oh that
[1:24:10] person has a lot of wisdom I'm going to
[1:24:12] be the person that they come to for
[1:24:14] wisdom because I've been in business for
[1:24:16] so long i' I've got so much experience
[1:24:19] so they need to come to me that's not
[1:24:21] the way God God operates in the body God
[1:24:24] will use the the the experiences and the
[1:24:28] and and the ability of the individual if
[1:24:31] the individual is humble but if there's
[1:24:34] a spirit of Pride I know this and I know
[1:24:37] more guess what God ain't going to use
[1:24:40] you you might be the only one that that
[1:24:43] that thinks that you're you're you're
[1:24:45] you've got all this understanding and
[1:24:47] all this knowledge and all this wisdom
[1:24:50] but God's not going to use you God's not
[1:24:52] going to allow that Spirit of arrogance
[1:24:54] or that Spirit of Pride to be mixed with
[1:24:57] his wisdom that's why when the spirit of
[1:25:00] God is operating in a gift there's
[1:25:03] humility there's there's there's a
[1:25:05] humbleness there's a understanding and a
[1:25:08] respect for one another regardless of
[1:25:11] the position we are all Sons and
[1:25:14] Daughters of God and nobody is higher
[1:25:17] than the other when it comes to being a
[1:25:21] son or a daughter of God God I need to
[1:25:24] respect every single one of you
[1:25:27] regardless of who you are regardless of
[1:25:30] where you are at we need to respect and
[1:25:33] love and appreciate everyone for where
[1:25:37] we are that's the only way that the
[1:25:41] Supernatural is going to move in each
[1:25:43] and every one of these offices and these
[1:25:46] gifts it's when we get ourselves and we
[1:25:49] project ourselves into the gift then God
[1:25:54] can't use it God will just not allow it
[1:25:56] to have an effect and he will turn he'll
[1:25:59] actually turn the people away from
[1:26:02] you you'll wonder why they don't want to
[1:26:04] fellowship with you you'll wonder why
[1:26:06] they don't want to be around you it's
[1:26:08] because there's a spirit there that's
[1:26:10] that that's that's projecting something
[1:26:12] like I'm better than you we're not
[1:26:14] better than anybody nobody is better
[1:26:16] than anybody else in the body of Christ
[1:26:19] we are all joints that need to supply by
[1:26:22] one
[1:26:23] another and we need to recognize that in
[1:26:26] order to really truly Be an Effective
[1:26:28] church that can be effective even in the
[1:26:31] community and be effective to anybody
[1:26:34] because we're no better than anybody
[1:26:36] else it's just the grace of God that you
[1:26:38] can see what you're seeing it's God's
[1:26:40] grace that he's given you his Spirit to
[1:26:42] recognize what the word is actually
[1:26:44] saying to somebody else they read the
[1:26:47] word and it just like it just goes right
[1:26:49] over their head and no matter what you
[1:26:50] do you can't give give it to them
[1:26:52] because God gives Revelation not man man
[1:26:56] doesn't give Revelation and so you need
[1:26:58] to wait on the spirit of God to give
[1:27:01] each their portion of faith in their
[1:27:04] time and in their season amen praise God
[1:27:08] and
[1:27:09] so uh you know when you
[1:27:12] are you
[1:27:14] know given this gift and this ability
[1:27:19] remember it's not something that you
[1:27:20] gave to yourself or you earned but it's
[1:27:23] something that God gave you and at the
[1:27:25] same time the gift in you sometimes you
[1:27:29] got to remember we've got an
[1:27:31] enemy we're going to wind it right down
[1:27:34] now we've got an enemy that is
[1:27:37] constantly going to try and stop you
[1:27:39] from operating in that
[1:27:41] gift okay and so you're G to have to
[1:27:45] deal with that and you're going to have
[1:27:46] to deal with the reproach that comes
[1:27:50] with being in the body Body of Christ
[1:27:53] being a true called Christian in this
[1:27:57] day and in this hour you're going to
[1:27:59] have to bear the reproach of being a
[1:28:02] real Christian people are not going to
[1:28:04] like it that you're different that
[1:28:06] you're gifted in order to have the you
[1:28:08] know the gift of faith you know that
[1:28:10] faith is a gift God gives you the
[1:28:13] ability to receive Revelation by his
[1:28:16] spirit and that's a gift and when you're
[1:28:19] talking to somebody that can't receive
[1:28:21] Revelation and cannot see the word the
[1:28:23] way that you're seeing it they're going
[1:28:25] to reject you and you got to realize
[1:28:28] that's all part of being a part of the
[1:28:32] body of Jesus
[1:28:36] Christ next slide here brother bradam
[1:28:39] speaking here he says the reproach for
[1:28:41] the cause of the word 1962 he says you
[1:28:44] always have to stand this report
[1:28:47] reproach in order to give your testing
[1:28:50] to see every man that comes to Christ
[1:28:53] must first be child trained for the
[1:28:56] purpose that God has ordained you for
[1:28:59] and remember if you can just keep quiet
[1:29:02] remember if he has called you for this
[1:29:06] there is nothing that can keep it from
[1:29:09] happening if God has called you to the
[1:29:11] body of Christ God has called you to
[1:29:13] your position let the musicians come God
[1:29:16] has called you to this place there's
[1:29:18] nothing that can stop you there's not
[1:29:20] enough devils in torment what God's will
[1:29:23] will be made manifest you're born for a
[1:29:26] purpose and nobody can take your place
[1:29:30] you might have impersonators and
[1:29:32] everything else but they'll never take
[1:29:34] your place right God's word will
[1:29:38] Triumph the attribute that God has
[1:29:41] placed in you will triumph over whatever
[1:29:45] circumstance and whatever it is that you
[1:29:47] have to deal with in order to get to the
[1:29:50] place where God can can can perfect you
[1:29:52] for the use within the body of Christ he
[1:29:56] says God's word will Triumph it cannot
[1:29:58] fail there is where every Christian
[1:30:01] ought to stand knowing that and trials
[1:30:05] will come up and seem every way to you
[1:30:09] but remember God has a purpose and it'll
[1:30:13] all will work right amen I'm going to
