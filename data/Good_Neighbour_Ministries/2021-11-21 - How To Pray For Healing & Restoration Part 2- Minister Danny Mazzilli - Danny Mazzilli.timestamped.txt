[36:55] finding your lives you know just
[36:56] building some momentum
[36:58] feeling that anointing around your life
[37:01] you know you cannot walk with somebody
[37:04] um every single day you know and be in
[37:08] constant communication with that person
[37:10] and not feel them around you and not
[37:12] sense them you know especially the lord
[37:15] right you know you're catching their
[37:16] thoughts their minds you know you just
[37:18] think about it when you're at work you
[37:19] know your work with the same people all
[37:21] the time you're constantly communicating
[37:24] they're telling you more and more about
[37:25] their lives you're getting to know
[37:26] they're getting to know you more and
[37:27] more well that's what your relationship
[37:29] with the lord is all about and and you
[37:32] know over the years i know you think
[37:33] well you know brother i've been walking
[37:35] with the lord for 25 years or 30 years
[37:38] or whatever i don't care how long you've
[37:39] been walking with the lord
[37:41] i know for a fact that you are still in
[37:44] this world
[37:46] and you will get distracted and you will
[37:49] get sideswiped and you will get hurt
[37:52] and you will have heartache and you will
[37:55] find yourself in tribulation and
[37:57] situations that you never thought that
[37:59] you would find yourself in even after
[38:01] walking with the lord for so many years
[38:04] and the only thing that you've got
[38:07] is your
[38:08] contact
[38:10] and relationship with the lord he is the
[38:13] only one that can fix
[38:16] any problem that you might have amen
[38:18] praise god forevermore and that's you
[38:21] know today we're going to be looking at
[38:22] how to pray for healing and restoration
[38:25] uh let's just have a word of prayer
[38:27] before we do that we'll read the
[38:29] scripture father we are so thankful this
[38:31] morning
[38:32] lord that we can be here father and that
[38:34] we can know that you are present
[38:37] lord you said where two or more would
[38:39] gather lord here there's probably 70 80
[38:42] people father under expectation
[38:45] in need of healing in need of
[38:47] restoration in need of you father to
[38:50] come lord
[38:52] even tomorrow we
[38:54] we we need intervention father lord but
[38:57] we are trusting and believing in that
[38:59] relationship
[39:00] that you started
[39:02] you called
[39:03] you authored and now you said i will
[39:06] finish
[39:07] and all we've got to do is surrender
[39:09] ourselves yield ourselves and do what we
[39:11] know we can do father grant it now lord
[39:14] remember all the needs in our midst
[39:16] father remember to continue to
[39:18] strengthen our pastor as he rests at
[39:20] this time lord his home is family father
[39:23] may you just just take control now bless
[39:26] speaker bless hearer we welcome you
[39:29] great jehovah god
[39:30] who is jehovah jireh our provider
[39:34] granted we pray in jesus name amen
[39:36] praise god
[39:38] and so um
[39:40] we'll look at our scripture
[39:43] first slide you're going to need to
[39:45] follow me here on the slides because
[39:46] we're going to be going through a lot of
[39:47] slides okay
[39:49] and the first slide says
[39:51] if my people
[39:53] who are called by my name
[39:55] will humble themselves and pray and seek
[39:58] my face and turn from their wicked ways
[40:01] then i will hear from heaven and i will
[40:04] forgive their sins and i will heal
[40:08] their land god bless you you may be
[40:10] seated
[40:12] i want to do a quick review of um part
[40:15] one
[40:15] um a few weeks ago we were looking at uh
[40:18] the different things
[40:20] and the first thing is next slide it's
[40:22] that we have to admit that we are not in
[40:25] control
[40:28] as much listen this relationship is with
[40:30] with the almighty god the creator of
[40:33] heaven and earth
[40:34] and he has given us his ability to to to
[40:38] communicate and to receive his thoughts
[40:42] so we are like a channel here on this
[40:44] earth we've been given that ability so
[40:46] whatever happens
[40:48] in us and through us it's god working
[40:51] through us
[40:53] god in us your hope of glory amen so so
[40:57] next slide
[40:58] it says if my people will humble
[41:00] themselves and we looked at humility and
[41:04] so next slide we looked at some of the
[41:06] thoughts look at this uh you know here
[41:08] brother brown speaking look at the
[41:10] seraphim woman
[41:11] when when she was told by jesus it's not
[41:14] right for me to take the children's
[41:16] bread and feed you dogs what would you
[41:20] have said if he had called you a dog
[41:24] you'd have said i'll join the next
[41:26] church
[41:27] but not her she knew who she was talking
[41:30] to
[41:31] she said lord that's right you're so
[41:33] right in that but the dogs is willing to
[41:36] eat the scraps under the master's table
[41:39] that got him
[41:40] that was it
[41:42] that's what he's waiting for you to do
[41:45] humble yourself
[41:47] into such a place no matter how god
[41:49] sends it to you if you're healed
[41:52] instantly if you're healed by degrees if
[41:55] if you're put off for like abraham was
[41:58] for 25 years
[42:02] oh glory to god amen
[42:04] hallelujah waiting for the promise
[42:07] but instead of getting weak he got
[42:09] stronger all the time
[42:11] giving praise to god just so that you
[42:13] know that god promised it and you accept
[42:16] it for yourself to not
[42:19] it's not to come to pass just remember
[42:22] now as i go on record in these tapes i
[42:26] say this with all my heart that if any
[42:28] persons will take the right mental
[42:31] attitude towards any divine promise that
[42:35] god has made it will come to pass
[42:39] amen praise god you see it's it's
[42:42] humbling yourself before the lord
[42:44] it's recognizing that that you're that
[42:47] you're dealing with an awesome god
[42:50] amen we don't approach him like you know
[42:52] like some you know hey
[42:54] father like you know you gotta do this
[42:57] for me today
[42:58] we don't approach him with pride
[43:01] oh i did this and i did that and i did
[43:03] this lord and i went to church 74 times
[43:06] this year
[43:08] that's pride
[43:10] that's not going to catch his attention
[43:12] let's look at a few of the things that
[43:14] we looked at just briefly
[43:16] next slide confess your sin the moment
[43:18] you realize it this is this is
[43:20] attributes of humility
[43:22] you know
[43:23] humility is forgiving quickly
[43:26] you don't hold on to things
[43:28] if god has forgiven you like you just
[43:30] got to look back on your own life and
[43:32] see what god did for you
[43:34] and he forgave you for things that you
[43:35] don't even want to talk about anymore
[43:38] but yet you want to hold something on
[43:40] somebody
[43:42] you don't want to let go and believe
[43:43] that god can heal the whole situation
[43:46] and restore
[43:47] that's what we're looking at today we
[43:49] want to see what god can do to restore

[44:05] unfairly be quiet patient and don't
[44:09] retaliate
[44:11] when you look for ways to serve others
[44:14] and not yourself all the time
[44:16] humility is being respectful to the
[44:19] authorities
[44:20] in your life
[44:21] good or bad
[44:24] good or bad
[44:26] humility is picking up the trash
[44:28] whenever you see it
[44:30] if you're walking downstairs or you're
[44:32] walking through this church and there's
[44:34] something on the floor in front of you
[44:36] you
[44:37] pick it up
[44:39] it just shows that you care about the
[44:41] house of the lord that you know that
[44:42] this is his house and that you show
[44:45] respect that's all it is amen praise god
[44:49] humility is admitting your weaknesses
[44:51] and sin to a few safe people that you
[44:54] trust
[44:55] so that you can pray together
[44:58] amen praise god humility is always
[45:00] speaking well
[45:02] of others always
[45:05] always
[45:06] no matter what no matter how many things
[45:08] you might see nine things that are wrong
[45:10] with that person
[45:12] encourage them with the one that's good
[45:14] amen
[45:18] it's for your good yes
[45:20] humility is praying for your enemies
[45:23] humility is not thinking less of
[45:26] yourself well i'm no good you know oh

[45:33] really deserve this you know this

[45:40] what are you trying to do
[45:42] you're trying to put on humility you
[45:44] can't do that with god
[45:46] humility is something that you
[45:48] that you just are
[45:50] you just decided that i'm not gonna
[45:53] think about myself
[45:54] humility is not thinking less of
[45:56] yourself but thinking of yourself less
[46:00] and putting others first
[46:03] and looking to do what's best
[46:05] next slide
[46:07] and so if i'm humble

[46:11] god leads the humble in the right way
[46:14] and teaches them his will so in other
[46:17] words if you're humble
[46:18] god will guide you god will show you
[46:21] what you need god will show you what to
[46:23] do amen he will guide you psalms 25 9
[46:26] next slide if i'm humble god will bless
[46:29] me
[46:30] next slide it says i will bless those
[46:34] who have humble and contrite hearts
[46:36] isaiah 66 2.
[46:40] next slide if i am humble god will give
[46:43] me the power to change
[46:46] his grace is what changes us
[46:49] that's the power of god
[46:51] that's when god intervenes in your life
[46:54] when you don't deserve it
[46:56] but because you're humble because you're

[47:00] patiently waiting on your brothers and
[47:02] your sisters you're you're you're you

[47:14] next slide
[47:15] god opposes the proud but gives grace to
[47:19] the humble
[47:20] james 4 6
[47:22] so if i am humble next slide god

[47:47] wait i don't care your word said this i
[47:50] believe it that settles it
[47:52] when you come to that place where you
[47:54] can believe god in that way and know
[47:56] that he's in control and he will do it
[47:58] in his time and in his season stress
[48:01] leaves you amen
[48:04] worry is unbelief
[48:07] you know that's worry is unbelief but
[48:09] you know what the things you need to
[48:11] pray most about are the things that you
[48:13] worry about the most
[48:17] next slide

[48:23] and learn from me for i am gentle and
[48:25] humble and i will restore deep rest
[48:30] into your soul
[48:31] how many need some deep rest
[48:34] how many knows that these last two years
[48:36] have been just oh

[48:39] it has it has taken people's rest
[48:42] it has taken people's minds that i've
[48:45] never seen such oppression like i've
[48:48] seen it in the people over these last
[48:50] two years and the effects of people and
[48:53] depression and oppression like never
[48:56] before saints
[48:58] but god says
[48:59] i i can take that from you
[49:02] i can remove that from you i will
[49:04] restore
[49:05] deep rest next slide
[49:09] and so now we want to move on to the
[49:11] next stage of this
[49:15] how to pray for healing and restoration
[49:17] part two
[49:18] and we want to continue
[49:20] and we want to look at the next step
[49:23] and if we look at the next slide it says
[49:25] ask
[49:26] god
[49:28] for help
[49:31] you know a lot of people
[49:33] they don't ask
[49:35] they try and work things out on their
[49:38] own they think that i can do this
[49:41] i can do this
[49:42] no you need to ask god next slide it
[49:45] says i tell you the truth my father will
[49:48] give you anything
[49:50] you asked for in my name
[49:53] until now you have not asked for
[49:55] anything in my name
[49:57] ask and you will receive so that your
[49:59] joy will be the fullest possible joy
[50:05] now i want you to
[50:06] notice something here the lord did not
[50:09] say
[50:10] everything
[50:12] you know there's a difference between
[50:13] everything and anything
[50:16] he says you can ask anything you want
[50:21] you can absolutely and he says ask
[50:23] ask anything anything then let him
[50:27] decide
[50:29] when
[50:30] he wants to and if he wants to give you
[50:34] one of your any requests
[50:36] because he knows when is the right time
[50:39] and the best time and he knows if you're
[50:42] ready for it he knows if you deserve it
[50:45] he knows if you if you've done
[50:47] your part he knows you know like you
[50:49] know a lot of people just like you know
[50:51] it's like a child right you know when
[50:53] you're going through the store a child
[50:54] says daddy i want this i want that i
[50:56] want this i want that and a father knows
[50:59] you know he's pointing at a rifle
[51:04] a father knows that you know he's not
[51:06] going to give him the rifle
[51:08] a father knows what his sons and
[51:10] daughters need
[51:12] but he says ask
[51:14] ask and continue to ask let's look at
[51:17] the next slide
[51:19] remember jesus
[51:20] wants me to ask he why does he want you
[51:23] to constantly ask well look at a child
[51:25] when a child goes to the mummy and the
[51:27] daddy and says mommy i i want this you
[51:30] know mommy i got a boo-boo i need a i
[51:32] need a band-aid and mommy goes and puts
[51:34] that band-aid on there and rubs it and
[51:36] kisses it the the child says oh thank
[51:39] you mommy it starts to build trust
[51:42] it knows that when you respond
[51:45] to that child over and over again it
[51:47] starts to trust you and that's why a
[51:50] child their mummy and their daddy is
[51:52] everything to them
[51:54] well god is the same for us
[51:57] he wants us to ask
[52:00] because he wants us to trust him he
[52:04] wants us to trust him in the situations
[52:06] knowing that that his answer is perfect
[52:10] he will give us the right answer at the
[52:12] right time and he knows what's
[52:15] absolutely best for us but he doesn't
[52:17] but because he hasn't responded because
[52:20] he hasn't given you the answer exactly
[52:23] when you wanted it next slide
[52:28] we got to continue to pray
[52:31] for our needs and never give up
[52:36] look when you give up you stop praying
[52:41] it's that simple
[52:43] when you stop praying it's because you
[52:44] gave up
[52:47] the two cannot work at the same time
[52:50] the two got to work together
[52:53] amen they can't be one against the other
[52:56] amen so you can't do one without the
[52:58] other when god has not answered you yet
[53:01] it's because he is
[53:04] testing you
[53:05] or because he is testing your priorities
[53:09] or because he's testing your motives
[53:13] or he's testing your maturity
[53:15] because when a child does start to grow
[53:17] the parent starts to give them certain
[53:20] responsibility and test them on whether
[53:23] they are going to be responsible enough
[53:26] to handle what they are asking for these
[53:29] are simple things aren't they
[53:30] but i'm telling you they're profound
[53:33] because like over these last three weeks
[53:36] in in doing this research and and and
[53:40] these studies
[53:41] i've come to realize a lot of things
[53:43] about myself
[53:45] and i'm sure you have too
[53:47] a lot of areas in your life where you
[53:49] were just taking certain things for
[53:51] granted you were you were careless in in
[53:53] many ways
[53:54] you know god really really uh you know
[53:57] just checking my heart through all of
[53:59] this and boy am i ever being tested
[54:02] i'm telling you i'm being tested saints
[54:05] you might think oh well brother danny
[54:07] you know you're you're you don't seem
[54:09] like you know you always seem positive
[54:11] and this and that i'm positive
[54:13] i'm positive about
[54:15] him
[54:16] i'm positive that he's going to work
[54:18] everything out and it's going to work
[54:20] for my good regardless of whatever the
[54:23] circumstances might be now however i
[54:26] might look at them right now whatever
[54:28] i'm looking at is regardless because i'm
[54:31] trusting in the promises of god amen
[54:33] praise god next slide he says here and i
[54:36] will put this
[54:38] third into the fire this is zechariah
[54:41] and refine them as one refines silver
[54:46] and test them as gold is tested
[54:50] they will call upon my name and i want
[54:52] to i want to just
[54:54] tell you what that means they will pray
[55:00] and i will answer them
[55:04] and they will say the lord is my god
[55:09] he is my god hallelujah because he came
[55:13] through amen he made you know he brought
[55:15] it to pass at the right time he just
[55:17] knew exactly when i was going to need
[55:20] what i needed amen praise god but he
[55:23] knew that i needed to be tested he knew
[55:25] that my attitude needed to be tested he
[55:28] knew that my patients needed to be
[55:29] tested he knew that my my my uh you know
[55:34] all these attitudes that that that we
[55:37] build up as we grow and and as we mature
[55:40] you know as whatever area of your life
[55:43] whatever if you're a businessman or
[55:44] you're a teacher or you're you're a
[55:47] worker he just knows exactly where he
[55:50] needs to refine you because saints of
[55:53] god
[55:54] this is all about perfect faith
[55:57] this is all about knowing who you are in
[56:00] the lord
[56:02] he wants you to see who you really are
[56:05] he wants you to recognize that you're
[56:07] not under this human control
[56:10] you're not to be controlled by human
[56:13] teaching by human ability you are a son
[56:17] or a daughter of god that's led by the
[56:19] spirit of god
[56:21] you will not be controlled
[56:23] by anything but the lord himself amen
[56:26] praise god hallelujah
[56:29] yes sir next slide
[56:31] and so
[56:32] what we need to do now in moving forward
[56:35] in building our relationship with the
[56:38] lord is building our relationship with
[56:40] others
[56:42] and get other people
[56:44] to pray with you
[56:46] we need one another
[56:49] don't be trying to be a lone ranger when
[56:51] you get into situations that you think
[56:54] you know like boy i'm i'm really i'm
[56:56] really in a bad spot right now
[56:58] you know a lot of people as soon as they
[56:59] get hurt they they run
[57:02] they go looking for you know for for a
[57:03] hiding place
[57:05] they immediately start looking
[57:06] everywhere else but god is saying no
[57:09] closer together clean yourself find
[57:12] yourself in prayer with one you know
[57:15] somebody that you can trust
[57:16] somebody that you can spend time with in
[57:19] prayer that they can pray for you you
[57:21] can pray for them
[57:22] you can come to the cir you can come to
[57:24] the elders of the church
[57:26] next slide it says i tell you that if
[57:28] just two of you on earth agree together
[57:32] about anything
[57:35] two
[57:37] you don't need to be a 500 people
[57:40] you don't need to have everybody you
[57:42] know in the whole church
[57:43] praying about that situation
[57:46] it's up to you
[57:48] certain things you will
[57:50] you know certain things are personal
[57:52] certain things you need to just get out
[57:54] there
[57:55] you know the difference but if just two
[57:58] two can agree
[58:00] on anything it will be done for you by
[58:03] my father in heaven matthew that's jesus
[58:06] speaking
[58:09] next slide is any of you in trouble
[58:12] he should pray
[58:14] is anyone happy
[58:15] let him sing songs of praise is any one
[58:18] of you sick
[58:20] he should call the elders of the church
[58:22] to pray over him and anoint him with oil
[58:25] in the name of the lord
[58:29] these are all things that are available
[58:32] to us
[58:33] amen next slide
[58:34] and the prayer offered in faith will
[58:37] make the sick person well
[58:39] the lord will raise him up
[58:42] if he has sinned he will be forgiven
[58:47] you see now now now you say but wait a
[58:50] minute here you mean i can be forgiven
[58:52] for anything absolutely anything there
[58:55] is nothing
[58:57] god didn't sin is just unbelief in the
[59:00] word of god
[59:02] and so whatever it is and a lot of
[59:04] people they want to hide their sin
[59:06] because they're ashamed and they're not
[59:08] willing to go to the elder of the church
[59:10] or their deacon and say brother or
[59:12] sister you know brother you know can you
[59:15] please pray for me
[59:16] can you anoint me with oil
[59:18] because now it's because not because you
[59:21] think well if i just do that i'll be
[59:22] fine you walk out and go sin again
[59:26] no no there's a difference
[59:27] there's a reality and a sincerity in
[59:30] your heart amen that you are going
[59:33] because you are truly sorry you are
[59:36] truly repented amen praise god next

[1:01:53] by my name so first of all my people not
[1:01:56] just anybody
[1:01:58] you've got to be identified in the word
[1:02:01] of god you've got to be identified as a
[1:02:03] christian
[1:02:04] my people who are called by my name in
[1:02:08] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:02:11] if you're the wife and bride of jesus
[1:02:12] christ you've taken his name in baptism
[1:02:16] in all that you do
[1:02:17] everything is in the name of the lord
[1:02:19] jesus christ
[1:02:21] called by my name shall humble
[1:02:23] themselves
[1:02:24] and pray and seek my face
[1:02:29] seek my face and turn from their wicked
[1:02:31] ways they will hear from heaven and will
[1:02:34] and and will forgive their sin and will
[1:02:38] heal their land
[1:02:41] next slide
[1:02:44] brother branham says here whatever you
[1:02:45] do don't you forget my words
[1:02:50] don't you let this anchor
[1:02:53] god take an iron pen and engrave it in

[1:03:32] remember we're at the end time from a
[1:03:36] true sign that's overlooked
[1:03:38] next slide
[1:03:40] i love those who love me and those who
[1:03:43] seek me
[1:03:44] to find me
[1:03:45] and when you seek god you get everything
[1:03:48] else
[1:03:49] you see everybody's always praying lord
[1:03:52] give me this lord give me that lord i
[1:03:54] need this lord i need that god is not
[1:03:56] some atm
[1:04:01] that you just go there and you just

[1:04:09] seek god with a walk with him seek him
[1:04:12] in in the power of his resurrection seek
[1:04:15] him that you want to have that
[1:04:17] relationship that you know you're naked
[1:04:19] before god
[1:04:20] and that it's you and god and when and
[1:04:23] that now that relationship is something
[1:04:25] that god is just enjoying with you
[1:04:28] there's too many that don't really seek
[1:04:30] him
[1:04:31] next slide god rewards those who
[1:04:34] earnestly seek him
[1:04:36] next slide
[1:04:38] the lord looks down from heaven on the
[1:04:40] entire human race he looks to see if
[1:04:43] there's even one with real understanding
[1:04:46] who seeks
[1:04:47] for god can you imagine
[1:04:51] why because they've made him
[1:04:53] an object of worship
[1:04:56] the whole world has turned god and just
[1:04:59] into an object of worship that's why
[1:05:01] there's so many different gods out there
[1:05:04] but if they ever seek him
[1:05:07] and seek his face
[1:05:09] his reality
[1:05:11] his presence in their lives he'll he'll
[1:05:15] burn all the sin out of their lives
[1:05:18] he'll he'll expose all the things that
[1:05:20] we need to let go of
[1:05:22] he'll deal with you that to where you
[1:05:25] will repent
[1:05:27] and repentance is is something beautiful
[1:05:29] it's not something bad
[1:05:31] repentance is you know it's from the
[1:05:33] word metanoia from the scriptures is to
[1:05:36] turn
[1:05:37] it's to turn and change our minds
[1:05:40] from looking at things in a certain way
[1:05:42] and then seeing them in the right way
[1:05:45] that's what god is asking you to do is
[1:05:47] to take you know certain attitudes in
[1:05:50] certain ways that you look at things and
[1:05:53] you interpret things and and he's saying
[1:05:56] repent turn away from those ways of
[1:05:59] thinking and look at your life that you
[1:06:02] know that you know once you've confessed
[1:06:04] your sin
[1:06:05] your sin gets left behind you've
[1:06:08] repented of it and now you're brand new
[1:06:10] again
[1:06:12] so repentance is a beautiful thing
[1:06:15] it's not something that we should be
[1:06:16] afraid of it's something that sets us
[1:06:19] free
[1:06:20] it liberates us from the power of
[1:06:22] darkness
[1:06:24] it moves us from darkness into light
[1:06:27] because you were believing a certain way
[1:06:29] and now you're believing the right way
[1:06:33] hallelujah
[1:06:34] next slide
[1:06:36] you know
[1:06:37] i i really like the way he said this
[1:06:41] he said if you're stuck in a cycle and
[1:06:44] year after year after year you feel like
[1:06:47] i'm not getting any better
[1:06:49] i'm just kind of stuck
[1:06:52] i'm in neutral

[1:06:59] next year
[1:07:00] same situation relationships still stink
[1:07:05] my habits still are not where i want
[1:07:07] them to be you're stuck in that cycle
[1:07:10] it's because you're not
[1:07:12] seriously seeking god
[1:07:16] you're not seriously seeking god
[1:07:20] and and uh um you've got to seek him
[1:07:23] with all your heart you know what
[1:07:26] if you'll do that it's kind of like
[1:07:28] humility god loves the humble but god
[1:07:31] goes overboard for people who seek him
[1:07:34] he will bless your socks off i started
[1:07:37] laughing when i read that
[1:07:40] hallelujah the lord can bless you so
[1:07:43] much my god you'll jump right out of
[1:07:45] your socks yes hallelujah brother praise
[1:07:48] god

[1:07:51] of your heart seek him knowing that he's
[1:07:53] real
[1:07:54] he's not some denominational teaching
[1:07:56] he's not in some because he's in this
[1:07:58] church because of this preacher or
[1:08:00] because of that preacher it's got
[1:08:02] nothing to do with the preacher it's got
[1:08:04] to do with him
[1:08:06] hallelujah it's got to do with his word
[1:08:08] and how his word is being revealed to
[1:08:10] you
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:15] glory to god amen
[1:08:17] next slide if you seek the lord your god
[1:08:19] you will find him
[1:08:21] if you look for him and with all your
[1:08:24] heart and with all your soul
[1:08:27] when you are in distress and all these
[1:08:30] things have happened to you
[1:08:32] you will return to the lord
[1:08:35] your god and obey him for he is merciful
[1:08:40] god
[1:08:41] hallelujah he will not abandon or
[1:08:45] destroy you aren't you thankful for that
[1:08:48] amen he'd never destroy or abandon you
[1:08:51] but sometimes you need to get into
[1:08:53] desperation
[1:08:54] you got to come to a place where you
[1:08:56] become desperate with your situation and
[1:08:58] you and you just got to say that's
[1:09:00] enough enough is enough
[1:09:01] i'm not dealing with this anymore i'm
[1:09:04] not going to stay the same way i don't
[1:09:06] want 2022 to be a repeat of 2021 in my

[1:09:28] god you got to make that decision you
[1:09:29] got to decide and so the only way you
[1:09:32] can do that is you need to seek the lord
[1:09:35] with all of your heart
[1:09:37] next slide listen to brother brown he
[1:09:39] says now we're going to talk on
[1:09:41] desperations for a few minutes now
[1:09:43] usually it takes a state of emergency
[1:09:46] you know everybody oh they go running to
[1:09:48] god the moment there's an emergency what
[1:09:50] about having that relationship so that
[1:09:52] when you come to that emergency he's
[1:09:54] already there waiting
[1:09:59] that's the kind of relationship that we
[1:10:01] should have especially after
[1:10:03] so many years walking with the lord
[1:10:06] and for those that are young and walking
[1:10:07] with the lord you can trust him in that
[1:10:09] way he will be there at every emergency
[1:10:14] and he'll do it even when you haven't
[1:10:17] prayed
[1:10:19] if you're a son or a daughter of god my
[1:10:21] god how many of you can look back on
[1:10:23] life and know that god was right there
[1:10:25] when you didn't deserve it but yet he
[1:10:27] was there keeping you
[1:10:29] he was there when you didn't deserve it
[1:10:31] oh come on saints you should you should
[1:10:33] judge something you should jump up and
[1:10:35] run around this place i feel like doing
[1:10:37] that right now come on saints you know
[1:10:40] that god has taken you out of situations
[1:10:43] circumstances you didn't deserve it you
[1:10:45] didn't even know him while we were yet
[1:10:48] sinners he loved us
[1:10:51] what amazing love
[1:10:53] what amazing grace
[1:10:56] it takes a state of emergency to throw
[1:10:58] us into desperation see it's too bad it
[1:11:01] has to do that but human beings are so
[1:11:04] slothful in their mind
[1:11:06] that it takes an emergency
[1:11:09] something arises and when they do then
[1:11:11] then it throws them into that
[1:11:13] desperation and really
[1:11:15] in doing that in desperation it brings
[1:11:18] out that real thing that you are
[1:11:23] oh we could talk about this all day long
[1:11:27] because some people
[1:11:29] they just run for their lives
[1:11:32] they run from the church
[1:11:35] they leave the church
[1:11:37] they'd say well god didn't do it for me
[1:11:39] there so i guess i'm going to have to
[1:11:41] move on
[1:11:44] you see it
[1:11:45] it brings out what's really there when
[1:11:48] you get tested
[1:11:52] you know
[1:11:54] that the church
[1:11:56] is a mystical
[1:11:58] body of jesus christ
[1:12:01] it's not a place
[1:12:04] it's not
[1:12:05] at 5270 new street or
[1:12:08] whatever address this church is whatever
[1:12:10] that
[1:12:11] that's not the church
[1:12:13] that's a building
[1:12:16] then there is a body
[1:12:18] of believers
[1:12:20] that within that body are sons and
[1:12:22] daughters of god that believe god
[1:12:26] they either believe it or they don't
[1:12:29] it's just that simple
[1:12:32] and they do not run when they get under
[1:12:35] the pressure
[1:12:37] when the pressure comes they draw closer
[1:12:41] they look for help look at look look
[1:12:44] when when there's sheep in trouble they
[1:12:46] draw closer together
[1:12:49] they protect one another
[1:12:51] amen they don't look they you don't you
[1:12:54] don't be running away and going off on
[1:12:56] your own because i'll tell you the enemy
[1:12:58] is like a wolf he's waiting for one of
[1:13:01] those sheep to go run off on their own
[1:13:03] so that he can devour them and and take
[1:13:06] control of their lives and take them
[1:13:08] further away from god
[1:13:11] no sir
[1:13:12] the real thing it shows what you're made
[1:13:15] out of in the time of desperation and it
[1:13:18] usually pulls out all the good things
[1:13:21] that are in you
[1:13:24] hallelujah
[1:13:26] you know how you know that you're a son
[1:13:28] or a daughter of god
[1:13:30] is when you get tested
[1:13:33] and you get tried like a fire
[1:13:37] you get everything gets taken from you
[1:13:40] regardless
[1:13:43] but you know god you know what's real
[1:13:46] you know the reality of god in your life
[1:13:49] you know what he he has done for you
[1:13:53] you have that experience and you can
[1:13:55] always go back on that experience and
[1:13:57] know that he's real amen praise god
[1:14:01] number four next
[1:14:03] turn my attention from the world
[1:14:06] to the word
[1:14:09] we're looking at how to pray for healing
[1:14:11] and restoration and this is number four
[1:14:14] we turn from the world we don't look to
[1:14:17] you know like so many people are you
[1:14:19] know oh i gotta go see a psychiatrist
[1:14:23] it's sad
[1:14:24] it's very sad
[1:14:27] a lot of those psychiatrists need
[1:14:29] psychiatrists themselves because they've
[1:14:31] been dealing with so many
[1:14:33] unbelievable situations that their own
[1:14:35] minds are starting to lose it
[1:14:38] you think it's easy for these
[1:14:40] look up some of them a lot of them are
[1:14:42] in trouble
[1:14:44] they don't realize
[1:14:46] there's only one real you know like i'm
[1:14:48] not saying that counseling is bad no
[1:14:51] counseling is good
[1:14:53] there's nothing wrong with counseling
[1:14:55] but when you've made it your absolute
[1:14:58] outside of god
[1:15:00] good luck
[1:15:03] because if you're working with the lord
[1:15:05] and the lord leads you into a proper
[1:15:08] counseling to somebody that's going to
[1:15:10] guide you and lead you in the right way
[1:15:12] and your faith is in the lord still
[1:15:15] always in the lord not in the world
[1:15:18] not in the world's ability to fix your
[1:15:20] situation not in the world's ability to
[1:15:23] you know the the the the economy is
[1:15:25] going to fix my financial issues no not
[1:15:28] the economy
[1:15:30] jehovah jireh provided all of my needs
[1:15:35] my finances got nothing to do with the
[1:15:37] world
[1:15:40] if god has designed you in a certain way
[1:15:43] you know look you know something that
[1:15:44] really you know struck my heart you know
[1:15:47] in studying and all of this
[1:15:49] god has designed you in a certain way
[1:15:52] for the body of jesus christ
[1:15:55] and if there's some of you that the lord
[1:15:57] is going to bless financially
[1:15:59] then those are the things that you are
[1:16:01] going to be concerned about most of the
[1:16:04] time that's just the way you're built
[1:16:06] you've got to understand the way god
[1:16:08] designed you and and built you
[1:16:11] and so you'll find yourself in certain
[1:16:14] situations where you are your your your
[1:16:18] concern is about finance i'm just using
[1:16:21] that as an example i realize that that
[1:16:23] that's you know the way god built me a
[1:16:26] lot of people think oh you're money
[1:16:27] hungry money
[1:16:29] i don't need money
[1:16:30] other than what we need for this earth
[1:16:33] and what we need to to do what we need
[1:16:35] to do the part that we need to do the
[1:16:37] part that we need to support how we need
[1:16:39] to support it it's listen when when the
[1:16:42] rapture happens
[1:16:44] money ain't going to be on my mind
[1:16:49] but you know what money is on my mind
[1:16:52] because god designed me in a certain way
[1:16:54] god designed you in a certain way and
[1:16:56] the things that are on your mind are
[1:16:59] usually the things that you know that
[1:17:00] you should be working on praying about
[1:17:03] finding support uh you know looking for
[1:17:06] support in those areas but knowing that
[1:17:07] it's god that put that in you
[1:17:10] and so if it's god that put that in you
[1:17:13] and it's god that that's designed you
[1:17:16] that way then god will provide what you
[1:17:19] need in order to fulfill your part
[1:17:23] [Applause]
[1:17:25] so why should you be fearful
[1:17:27] of losing anything you can't lose
[1:17:30] nothing
[1:17:30] [Applause]
[1:17:32] everything that god has given you is
[1:17:34] already it's predestinated from before
[1:17:37] the foundations of the world
[1:17:40] he designed you in that way
[1:17:44] and so he's expecting you to live by
[1:17:46] faith in that area and so we need to
[1:17:49] recognize each other's strengths
[1:17:52] and weaknesses
[1:17:54] and recognize that the body we we need
[1:17:57] one another we need each other
[1:18:00] god needs us in this ministry here this
[1:18:03] local ministry there's a part that each
[1:18:05] and every one of us has and we need to
[1:18:08] find it and get into it
[1:18:11] next scripture
[1:18:15] you know turn from their wicked ways
[1:18:17] when you think of the word wickedness
[1:18:19] you know a lot of people
[1:18:21] think of the word wickedness and right
[1:18:23] away they'll start thinking about you
[1:18:25] know murder and and and
[1:18:27] you know uh
[1:18:29] all kinds of you know things that we can
[1:18:31] look out into the world as being wick
[1:18:33] wicked but you know what wickedness
[1:18:36] when you when you really look it up to
[1:18:38] see what it actually means scripturally
[1:18:40] forgetting god
[1:18:47] god was speaking saying if my people who
[1:18:49] are called by my name
[1:18:52] and if they shall seek my face and they
[1:18:54] shall turn from their wicked ways
[1:18:58] i will hear them i will heal them i will
[1:19:00] hear the land
[1:19:02] he's he's saying
[1:19:04] don't look anywhere else
[1:19:07] for me
[1:19:09] you're looking anywhere else for me as
[1:19:11] wicked
[1:19:13] you're actually putting god
[1:19:16] in second place
[1:19:18] because you're you're you're putting all
[1:19:20] your faith in the wrong things
[1:19:24] we want to communicate we want to have
[1:19:26] that right relationship so that we can
[1:19:28] receive our healing and our restoration
[1:19:31] and i know we all need it
[1:19:34] amen
[1:19:35] turn
[1:19:36] from it
[1:19:38] next scripture isaiah 17
[1:19:41] says you have forgotten the god who
[1:19:43] saves you
[1:19:46] and you have not remembered that god is
[1:19:48] your place of safety
[1:19:52] and so people will choose wicked ways
[1:19:55] other ways
[1:19:57] outside of the word of god use anything
[1:20:00] else but god
[1:20:02] to try and solve their problem try to do
[1:20:04] it themselves
[1:20:06] god says turn away from that
[1:20:08] look back to me he says
[1:20:11] seek my face
[1:20:14] next
[1:20:15] repent
[1:20:16] and turn to god
[1:20:18] so that your sins may be wiped out
[1:20:22] so that your times of refreshing may
[1:20:25] come
[1:20:26] from the lord
[1:20:29] we need
[1:20:30] times of refreshing how many how many
[1:20:32] needs sometimes a refresher
[1:20:34] amen praise god saints
[1:20:36] i don't know about you but
[1:20:38] you know what these last couple of years
[1:20:41] they've been they've been crazy years
[1:20:43] and we need some times of refreshing
[1:20:45] from the lord amen
[1:20:47] we need we need him to just come and
[1:20:48] scour out and so the only way we're
[1:20:51] going to do that is we need to get into
[1:20:53] a habit of prayer
[1:20:55] we need to seek his face we need to
[1:20:57] continually approach him amen next slide
[1:21:01] if you hide your sins you will not
[1:21:04] succeed
[1:21:06] we need to we need to come
[1:21:10] we need to we need to come
[1:21:12] and confess
[1:21:14] we need to we need to say hey i need
[1:21:16] help here
[1:21:18] i need i need i need restoration i need
[1:21:20] restoration in my finance i need
[1:21:22] restoration in my health i need
[1:21:24] restoration in my home with my children
[1:21:26] with my wife with my husband i need
[1:21:28] restoration
[1:21:30] you've got to humble yourself you got to
[1:21:31] come to a place and you got to let that
[1:21:33] unbelief that's holding you back because
[1:21:35] it's only unbelief when you think that
[1:21:38] something is impossible nothing is
[1:21:40] impossible for god
[1:21:43] god can make a way through
[1:21:46] the way or the situation that can that
[1:21:49] can satisfy everybody
[1:21:52] god knows how to do that it's not always
[1:21:55] a one-way street
[1:21:57] you can't be all one way you listen
[1:22:00] anybody listen anybody that is just no
[1:22:03] my way or the highway you need to get
[1:22:05] back on your knees
[1:22:08] because it's not my way or the highway
[1:22:11] you better discover god's way
[1:22:14] because that'll be the best way
[1:22:16] but if you hide your sins you'll not
[1:22:18] succeed but if you confess and reject
[1:22:21] them you will receive mercy
[1:22:24] why would you why would he say you'll
[1:22:26] receive mercy because you probably don't
[1:22:28] deserve it
[1:22:31] because you've been so stubborn and
[1:22:33] you've been so much in your own ways and
[1:22:36] you want to do it your way and that's it
[1:22:38] in my way or no way and but god says if
[1:22:41] you just repent and try me
[1:22:44] if you just humble yourself
[1:22:46] allow yourself to just come to a place
[1:22:49] where you know you need help
[1:22:53] god will make a way because he'll show
[1:22:55] mercy
[1:22:56] amen praise god
[1:22:58] how we need mercy and grace
[1:23:01] therefore
[1:23:03] and we're winding this down saints
[1:23:07] because what i want to do
[1:23:09] is i want to give everybody an
[1:23:10] opportunity today
[1:23:13] to be healed
[1:23:15] and to be restored
[1:23:18] the lord showed me last night in the
[1:23:20] middle of the night woke me up
[1:23:22] and showed me that
[1:23:24] there's healing and restoration needed
[1:23:27] in this house
[1:23:30] and he says
[1:23:32] let them come now we're not going to
[1:23:34] have a big
[1:23:36] altar call
[1:23:38] that's not what we're going to do
[1:23:40] but we're just going to allow you one at
[1:23:42] a time whoever wants to come through and
[1:23:44] wants to come up here and i will anoint
[1:23:46] you with oil
[1:23:48] and then i want everybody in the house
[1:23:50] to be praying
[1:23:52] for that individual we don't need to
[1:23:55] know what it is
[1:23:57] but your action in coming forth
[1:24:00] your decision
[1:24:01] in deciding that that you know what i
[1:24:04] need healing i need restoration
[1:24:06] it takes action sometimes
[1:24:09] that's it it really does saints we have
[1:24:11] to do we need to show that we really
[1:24:14] want it and so sometimes we need to
[1:24:17] confess
[1:24:18] and we need to go forward and we need
[1:24:21] prayer
[1:24:22] therefore next slide
[1:24:24] confess your sins
[1:24:26] no go back
[1:24:28] to each other and pray for each other so
[1:24:31] that you may be healed
[1:24:34] now you decide if you you know like like
[1:24:36] we were saying here like if you decide
[1:24:38] you want to confess something you know
[1:24:40] with somebody that you know that you
[1:24:42] trust and you don't have to get into all
[1:24:45] the details but you want to you want
[1:24:47] change you want to be set free
[1:24:50] the first thing you got to do is you got
[1:24:51] to let go of that thing you can't let it
[1:24:53] stay in your closet
[1:24:55] because it's going to haunt you
[1:24:57] it's going to continually come back you
[1:24:59] don't want to stay the same way you want
[1:25:02] change you want to allow god to come
[1:25:04] into that situation whatever it is and
[1:25:07] bring healing and bring restoration to
[1:25:09] that situation
[1:25:13] hallelujah
[1:25:22] god says here through our prophet next
[1:25:24] slide
[1:25:27] i will restore
[1:25:29] saith the lord
[1:25:31] all the years
[1:25:33] all send back
[1:25:35] i'll send back another church in the
[1:25:37] last days i will restore that original
[1:25:39] power again
[1:25:42] how's god gonna do that
[1:25:44] if you're not willing
[1:25:45] to go all the way
[1:25:48] if you're not willing to yield yourself
[1:25:50] surrender yourself that's the only thing
[1:25:53] jesus asked us to do was only believe
[1:25:57] all things are possible to them that
[1:25:59] believe
[1:26:01] we don't want to stay in the condition
[1:26:03] that we're in
[1:26:05] if we're in a certain condition that
[1:26:07] we're not happy with
[1:26:08] then we need to we we need to take a
[1:26:11] step
[1:26:12] to change
[1:26:14] and allow god to come and change that
[1:26:16] situation
[1:26:19] i will restore
[1:26:23] that original power again in the evening
[1:26:25] time it shall be light
[1:26:27] down in the heart of that tree no matter
[1:26:29] how many branches is pruned there will
[1:26:32] come forth the royal seed of abraham
[1:26:35] hallelujah god promised it
[1:26:38] god will do it he said he would do it i
[1:26:41] will restore all the years that the
[1:26:43] denominations eat away
[1:26:46] i will restore all the years i've proved
[1:26:49] i've pruned the thing off but yet there
[1:26:52] will come a vine out of the heart of it
[1:26:55] he'll be like a tree that's planted in
[1:26:57] the rivers of water a man that meditates
[1:27:01] in the word of god
[1:27:04] day and night
[1:27:06] not to a creed or a denomination
[1:27:09] but meditates
[1:27:11] in the word
[1:27:13] day and night
[1:27:15] he'll be like a tree that's planted by
[1:27:17] the river of water
[1:27:19] branches
[1:27:21] shall not wither
[1:27:23] he'll bring forth
[1:27:25] his fruit
[1:27:28] in
[1:27:29] the season
[1:27:31] god promised it
[1:27:33] god has a plan for each and every one of
[1:27:35] our lives
[1:27:37] we want him to have his way in each and
[1:27:40] every one of our lives
[1:27:43] let us bow our heads and let the
[1:27:44] musicians come
[1:27:54] you talk to god
[1:27:57] you search your heart
[1:28:01] you search the things that you know you
[1:28:04] don't want anymore
[1:28:06] you need healing in that area
[1:28:08] healing is not just something physical
[1:28:11] in your body healing can be
[1:28:13] an emotional scar a memory
[1:28:17] something somebody did to you
[1:28:20] years and years and years ago and you're
[1:28:22] still
[1:28:23] allowing that thing to come up and
[1:28:24] control you and and bind you and put you
[1:28:28] under certain fear and doubt
[1:28:34] and then god can restore
[1:28:36] the joy of your salvation
[1:28:41] maybe you find yourself a little bit
[1:28:42] miserable
[1:28:44] at times and find yourself depressed
[1:28:47] more than you're you're you're happy you
[1:28:49] should be you know a son or a daughter
[1:28:51] of god should be the happiest person on
[1:28:52] earth
[1:28:54] but we're human and i understand that
[1:28:56] and we all know that
[1:28:59] but if we're miserable and we're
[1:29:01] depressed
[1:29:02] more than we are
[1:29:04] joyful and and and at rest
[1:29:07] is because
[1:29:12] we're not trusting the lord we're not
[1:29:14] praying enough
[1:29:16] we're not believing him enough
