Um, pastor Danny couldn't make it today and he sent his greetings and uh, how many enjoy the word for Sunday? &gt;&gt; Yeah, we thank God for sending the brother in our way. Um, okay. So, can you please stand up again and let's pray and read the Bible? Sorry. Oh our heavenly most gracious eternal God and our strength comes from thee during the week people working and everything and we come here Lord only you that strengthen us and give us faith won't you come once more and speak to your children Lord we're not here to see a man we are here to hear your voice take me aside side and help me get myself out of the way. Lord, if I've done anything wrong, please forgive me, Lord. I'm I'm nothing but you are God that controls everything. Close my mouth from saying it in contra. Help me, Lord. And help your children, Lord, that they won't leave you the same, Father. anything unlike the father we come against it during the day whatever that has gone through Lord um as we may made mistakes here and there but we here Lord that the blood of Christ cleanses us from all unbelief please come and visit us and come against anything like Christ in Jesus name amen I have two scriptures Um first one will be taken from Joshua 1 verse 1-9 and then the second one is from Matthew that's where my topic is okay in Joshua chapter one you see from the Bible here it's all over the place now that's fine sometime like to read from the Bible We're going to have it print out, but I like to read it from the Bible in Joshua 1 verse 1-9. Now, after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua, the son of Nan, Moses, my servant, is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all these people on the land which I give to them, even to the children of Israel. Every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon, that have I give it unto you, as I said unto Moses, from the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Ephra, all the land of Hetes, and unto the great sea, toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast. Amen. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. And you given us a promise. As I was with Moses, in other words, as I was with Abraham, &gt;&gt; I will be with thee. &gt;&gt; I will not fail thee. &gt;&gt; Not forsake thee. &gt;&gt; That's the promise they bride. &gt;&gt; Be strong and of a good courage. This is speaking to you, not anybody else. For unto these people that shalt thou deise for an inheritance of the land which I swear unto the fathers to give them. Holy be thou strong and very, he added, very courageous, that thou may observe to the to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee to turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou may what? Prosper whatsoever thou goest. As far as that you are courageous and you observe according to the law which Moses has done, you God is going to prosper you whatsoever things you do. This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but shall meditate therein day and night, &gt;&gt; that thou may observe to do according to all that is written therein. For then thou shall make thy way prosperous. It's emphas here. And then thou shall have good success. Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage. Be not afraid. It's fear that is more among the people now. But God is encouraging us. Be not afraid. Neither be thou dismayed. And I said, "Not worry, for the Lord thy God is with thee, whatsoever thou goest." Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people say, "Okay." um the next scripture that I'm going to dwell my subject on is Matthew 9:15 to 17. And Jesus said unto them, "Can the children of the bride chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them. Then they shall fast." If you read uh verse 14 before that, it was the disciples of the John the Baptist came to ask him why his his disciples are not fasting. Okay, that's my grease. Put it on still. Then came to the of John the B. Okay, saying, "Why do we and Pharisees fast off, but thy disciples fast not?" Okay. Verse 16. No man putth a piece of new cloth onto an old garment. For that which is put in to fill it up, taketh room for the garment, and the rent is made waste. Neither do men put new wine into old bottles. Else the bottles break, and the wine runeth out, and the bottles perish, but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved. Heavenly Father, may you please bless the region of the world and bless your children in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Please be seated. Okay, if I will title it, I I will say you cannot mix uh law with grace or In other words, the past age, you cannot mix the past age with the present age. So, grace and law cannot exist together. And um Abraham elaborated here very well in parados verse paragraph 62-64. Now we find Joshua representing grace or some propiation that it could not exist in the same time that the law was existence. Neither does any message that forwards the people on ever coincide with past message. It will not do it. That's where we have trouble today. Jesus said, "Does any person take a new piece of garment and put it into an old or put the new wine into an old bottles? They perish. It burst them open. They can't stand it." And Joshua could not all become into his ministry until after Moses was gone. So you see the very first verse here, Moses, my servant is dead. Now arise and take this book to the promised land. Moses representing the law has served his time. The law has served its time. Amen. So in other words, as we read, you cannot h put a piece of garment into an old one or you cannot put a wine into an old bottles. A best. Amen. You cannot miss the ages of sword together. So um I'm just going to touch a little bit of natural point then I bring it back to the spiritual application. And the other time I was talking to my wife and I was telling her that in life the way our parents raises up we cannot apply this application how our parents raise us up to our children because it's a new age. It's a different atmosphere, different spirit, different everything. You try to bring that your the way your parents raise you up to apply for this age, you're going to crush the children and you can even what even lose them because we are in a generation that the people are weak and soft but increase in what wise in knowledge. So the way that the old time they raise the people and sometimes with the cane and all those kind of laws and it worked back then. But you take that same principle to apply it to our natural life, you're going to make a big big mess. You're going to get yourself in big trouble. And You cannot also solve today's problem basing it on the past problem. Like for instance, Abraham talk about countdown how that um first the gospel went with the innovations. How in the beginning they were using horse and boggy that time was Methodist. um yeah that was I think Hen Bogy was um was Luther then it goes on they move into cars Wesley and then automobile that's became more advanced then they came to airplane and now they go into the space &gt;&gt; so what the car or the if now you have to go and use a horse and buggy to drive on the high. People say you are crazy because it worked back then in the horse and boggy age. It was perfect. But you cannot transport it to present stage. &gt;&gt; That's why you have to know what God is doing in your time. The present stage of his ministry will meet present conditions. So you cannot carry that even the warfare. Remember that the the machines or the ammunitions that they used in the first and second world war you cannot take them and apply it here. It is a different age. You need a different condition. And I think that's why initially Russia was losing the war because they were using the the second world war armored car and everything. It was good for back then but here it's not good. Here this time they have a more precision weapons direct. It will come to your house with your name on it and take your head off. It's very precise. They have precise ammunition. They have drones. They have everything. So you cannot go and use that AK-47 and that thing to come and fight. Even if you look at the guy who unfortunately assassinated um Charlie K. He was so precise that that thing can go right and hit to kill him. So is the sons and daughters of God. Our sword has to be sharp. &gt;&gt; We have to short sharpen our sword which is the word of God to meet present conditions. The conditions that we did in the past it might not work this time. So it has to be more sharpened. Amen. No wonder that the scripture said that I wish a man pray always. before if you check those um Daniel and the rest they have a prayer time 3 91 12 whatever but you come to the New Testament Paul is saying that I wish a Christian pray always lifting up holy hands praising God not that you're going to be like always going to confine a place in other words he's trying to say that prayers is not confined find in a place. &gt;&gt; Before it was good. Those times before even the Holy Ghost were given they can be confined this that. But now we are in a new age. We are in a different times. The thing is different. So we have to be sharp and trust God for everything. So what is happening that you cannot bring past message to present tense &gt;&gt; is not going to work. There has to be a change. That's why the Bible took his time and said that Joshua Moses my servant is dead. It means that he's sleeping. Let my servant Moses have rest and sleep. He has done his part. But now the baton is in our hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. As I was with Moses, so I shall be with you. &gt;&gt; He's the same God that was in the prophet. Amen. Doing all those mighty works. But he's finished with the prophet. It's now the time of the bride. Remember the John the Baptist disciples they went to the Lord Jesus Christ and told him that why your disciples are not fasting. In other words, they were trying to take their doctrines the way John the Baptist was doing things and trying to push it to Jesus Christ to give it to his disciples. They said why we and the Pharisees we are fasting but your people are not fasting. He said that as far as the bridegroom with the chamber they don't do not fast but when he's taken out they will fast. In other words he was trying to tell them it wasn't time for that. And him being the Lord, he knows when the time comes. And those disciples are going to fast. They are going to fast with a revelation, with understanding. They won't just go and fast, fast, fast, fast like the Pentecost does. You have to fast with a revelation. God has to tell you to do it. And when he tells you and you are doing it, it's not going to be a hustle like some people like talk about they going to like um slamming cause they fast fast fast fast. But if you check in the Bible the scripture says that after the 40 years then Jesus what? Hunger. In other words, during all those 40 days, sorry, after 40 days, not 40 years, forgive me. After 40 days, he hungered. So that means that be between the first day to 40 days, he wasn't hungry. A true fast, you are feasting with God. Maybe might be a little bit hungry here and there, but it shouldn't be something that is going to be too much like the Pentecostals does. And if you find yourself that you fasting and you feeling too hungry, then it's time for you to cut it off. Maybe God want you to cut it off. Amen. So anything that re without revelation is sin. &gt;&gt; And you cannot mix law with grace. And it's grace is what? Grace is unmmerited favor. So God has given us grace. You cannot bring the law to mess up with the grace. And that's what most people are doing. And they making the people's life miserable because they have put because somewhere here it says that the law make you a prison. Let me see if I can find it. Yeah. I said the law brings us to recognize we are wrong. But it's grace that forgive us. The law has no hope of redemption because to complete it, it has no grace in it because the law only points that you are a sinner. But grace tells you how to get out of it. Law is the policeman that puts you in jail. But redemption is the one who came paid your fine and out of and into the grace. So in other words, law will put you into what? Prison. So the people are not free. They are obeying the law in prison. In other words, they are not free. They think they serving God by obeying those laws. without obeying the Lord. They don't feel confidence. They think that something is wrong. But the hour has come that the true worshippers will worship God in truth and in spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. That means that by revelation of the word of God. No wonder Abraham said that even if I tell you not to wear pants and you just go and stop wearing pants because I have told you it will not do you no good because you have to understand why you are not wearing those pants. You have to have a revelation why you are not doing that. You can't go to a place say why you not wearing pants. My church say you don't wear pants. That means don't know what you are doing. You yourself have to understand why you are not wearing that earring. You have to have a revelation. It brings me back when myself and braofi about maybe 10 years back a friend of mine that I witnessed to in England. um his uncle saw that there's been a change in that person's life and then his uncle lives in New York, he lives in England. His uncle lives in Virginia, he lives in England and then his uncle said that Ben, how come you changed like that? You were not like that before. And he said that a friend of mine in Canada has told me about the Lord Jesus Christ. I have been baptized in his name and God is taking care of my life. And then he said I want that portion. So he spoke to me and then I said I don't have to talk to him on phone because Virginia is not far from here. It's very close. So we can just go ourselves. to our told Kofi and myself and Kofi, we rented our car, we rented hotel, everything off to Virginia. When we went the man, his wife worked in pharmaceutical and a pharmacy, but the kind of pharmacy job she does, she is a research in pharmaceutical companies. So she goes to China all over the place and she could even be a senate be a senate in US. So she was big up there. We didn't know nothing about it. So we began to tell them by the word of God. I started I spoke and Kofu also came and began to speak. Whilst he was speaking, he told the lady that we are not telling you not to wear an earring, but the Bible said you don't have to wear it. But not but I'm just letting you know because in the old times when somebody is a slave and after 50 years he chose to be a slave they put things in his year and then she become a slave to his master for the rest of her of his life. So it signified that and then in the paris it was sign of homosexual when they were in the ship. So we told her that and the lady said, "Oh man, I believe everything you guys have told me from the beginning. Everything is perfect, but this word you telling me is not true. I'll never believe it. It's wrong. You guys are trying to push them on me." And you said, "Sister, we are not here to challenge you. And we are not here to tell you not wear an earring because even if you take it, it's not going to do no good. You are a standard to begin with and even if come to church you are we will expect you to wear it until God speak to your heart. So we cut off the conversation and then they made a coffee for us like on this table like that. We were about 12:00 we were about to go back to our hotel. So they make that h coffee and tea for us. Whilst we were drinking the tea like me and Kofi was here on the table the lady was sitting something like that all that we hear he scream with a loud voice and take that thing not and she said now that I'm free why because she challenged the word of God and God has to come down and prove to her that what we are saying was truth if she doesn't take it all year was like a fire in in a year ring she just take it out. So but what we are trying to say is that anything without revelation is sin. &gt;&gt; And you explained to the lady and later she said that man whatever you guys have told me is the absolute truth and the prophet that we talking about people said they are prophet but she stayed there all night and she said that she came with his gate. He was born with a prophet. That's why he from her own mouth. He said we brother Abraham is born with that gift. Not just a normal prophet that is saying out over there. This a true prophet of God. Why God demonstrated to her that he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Because he's a God that if you challenge him, he will show up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not serving a God on the wall. &gt;&gt; We are serving a living God. &gt;&gt; And he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; He never lose a battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. God loves all challenges. He will show up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is God that never change. &gt;&gt; He's the physician that never lost um lost a patient. And he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; So our God is an awesome God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So what am I trying to say? It is a different age. Luther, Methodist, Pentecost, and then now the age is changed. We living in that age is eternal church age which is the eighth day. Amen. We are no more in the seventh age again. Yes, physically we are in the licia but our soul has been transported to the eighth day the eternal church age. Amen. That's where we are now. Hallelujah. Now he said we approaching the seven se. You have just put the start of the perfect man. You have just finished the seven church ages and this a message on teaching that ties the man in that is going to be redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and is going to be in that church age that eternal church age at the end of the seals. Amen. So we have moved physically we are in the seventh church Jerusalem Lucia but we have moved to the eighth day. Amen. The e day also have a messenger that is the Lord Jesus Christ. So God is telling us now that he's in control. &gt;&gt; So we have to rest on his word. This is no time of working for your own or trying to base it on law or west. It's a resting time. &gt;&gt; He wants us to rest and then he takes control. That's why the Bible said that come unto me all ye that is heavy laden and I will give what? Rest unto your soul. Amen. The time that the bride of Christ is resting on that said the Lord. He's resting on the word of God. Because listen, the Satan's attack has increased. Is that right? So, we all know that the prophet said that there are over 2 million demons, 200 millions were demons re um released in the river Eupher. So you cannot approach this year, no this age that we are living in with a past age anointing. It will not work. You need God himself &gt;&gt; to tabernacle in your heart &gt;&gt; to fight your battles because he said that you are the temple of God &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God dwells in you and in me. He said, "I have it. The most high does not dwell in a house made of hands. Heaven is my throne and earth is my foottool. What house will you build me?" You are the house of God. It's now that you are sons and daughters of God. Now you are going to be you are. So he's giving you the assurance, giving you the power. He's given the authority. Everything that you have need of to make up the journey is in you right now. &gt;&gt; It's you have to activate it. &gt;&gt; It's not anybody. I I nobody can give to nobody. That thing is in you. You got to recognize who you are. &gt;&gt; That you are a son of God. &gt;&gt; That God who created the whole universe, he dwells in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are the tabernacle &gt;&gt; that God dwells in now. &gt;&gt; Amen. And listen, what the world is looking for is not just words. They want a reality. &gt;&gt; They want to see people who come with the reality of the word of God. &gt;&gt; That they have been with Jesus. &gt;&gt; That they want to see reflection of Christ in our lives &gt;&gt; because they are fed up with the words. The west alone cannot do it. It has to take the revelation of the word. It has to take the manifestation of the word of God in our lives. Is the life behind the name that demons fear and tremble. &gt;&gt; Amen. So whatever that you said that you have, it has to put on display &gt;&gt; because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. If you say you have met him, then your life has to prove it. People wants to see the hands of God in your life. And when they see God in your life like that, then they will cry for that God that you have. &gt;&gt; That's what the world needs &gt;&gt; to see the manifestation of the Holy Ghost in our lives. And then they will recognize as they told Peter and John that these people are ignorant unlearned but they have been with what? Jesus. &gt;&gt; That makes the deal. &gt;&gt; That's what it has to show. There's a time if all that we have need of is in us then is the time we have to take up that sword and cut off the Amalachi's head &gt;&gt; with the word of God. Don't be shining as pastor someone preached long time. Don't be shining on the sword and keep it up and always shine it. No, you got to take that sword and cut Amalachi's head off. Yes, sometimes going to get bruised. you're going to get hurt. But remember, greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Abraham gave an example, one of the kings in um Rome, I forgot the name, I think Caesar or something. He said one time he wanted to in greatest battle ever fought, he wanted to honor his soldiers and most of them came with their shining sword and dressed up nice and battalion. They walk like that. They matching and they have everything. He saw one of them right at the corner there bruised with a hurt all over him. And he said, "Hey, where did you get this wound from?" He said, "I got on the battle." He said, "This is the man that I want." He took him and ride with that man because he has been a battlefield. Amen. So God wants people who are in battlefield who are fighting on the word stand on the word of God and doing damage to Satan's kingdom. We cannot come and listen the word go home listen go home listen go home and be fed so much as Peter said that we are so much overfed. Amen. And we become like that. We have to exercise the word of God. Exercise that work of God that God has given to us. Put it into practice. &gt;&gt; Don't just only come and eat and eat and eat and become like that and then you don't exercise, you don't do nothing. Use it to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you are the son and daughter of God. The whole heaven is waiting on earth. &gt;&gt; You are the best. I was talking to a brother yesterday that God reserved the best for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. You look into it. All the great prophet Isaiah, Jeremiah, Jacob, Peter, John and even our men our prophet of God they are all resting and they are what? Waiting on us. &gt;&gt; It means that we don't look ourselves that we are something. We are nobody but somebody is in us and that somebody who is the Lord Jesus Christ have made us somebody. Amen. the whole of them they are waiting on us. &gt;&gt; It's time we have to pick up the salt. It's time we have to witness. It's time we have to do the best that we can to bring the last one in so that we can go because I'm fed up in this world. &gt;&gt; This world is not my home. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just a pilgrim. I'm just passing through. If heaven is not my home, then Lord, what should I do? Amen. No wonder Abraham and the rest they seek a city to come. Amen. There's a corrupt the sin. Everything is so corrupt. Amen. That sometimes you can't even stand it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But if you can't stand it and I'm not saying that we are um trying to escape from this world that we are miserable people. No, God has blessed us abundantly, both natural, spiritual, everything. But still, we are fed up with this world and the things going on here. It's time to go home to a heavenly king, a heavenly kingdom where there's no pain, where there's no kiss, where there's no gray hair. Somebody was saying that when you know you for a long time, you have a nice black hair. All this, why is it black hair? Gray hair all over the place. You are here today, you gone tomorrow. By the time you wake up, you just check the timings going just like that. 40 hit you 30 50 that you going. Amen. And then you take the place of your parents, they become an opera. Amen. And you look at my goodness, I can remember everything. So what I'm trying to say that once we have an opportunity, &gt;&gt; once we have our health, once we have everything, let's give our all to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let's surrender all to him. &gt;&gt; So that he when he needs to use us, we are be ready to be used. &gt;&gt; Amen. All that the scripture is, we have to be ready. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you are ready, when the Lord needs to use you, he's going to use you at the right time. It doesn't become a competition because it's him doing it and he knows that you are ready for the battle. So he will come and anoint you to do what he has to do. Amen. So it's time we take our sword. It's time we do all that we can for the kingdom of God. Because listen, without you and me, the last one is not coming. If you know you cannot go, send somebody. Send money to v missions. Amen. Or when they when we go on the D side, it will be your sweat of your money that bring the person in. You pray for those on the mission side because listen, the bra ministry all the time they have a prayer meeting. People always praying for the service. You say brother Phillip I cannot witness. I cannot do that. At least you can pray. &gt;&gt; You can pray every time for the service. &gt;&gt; If you want to see God, if you want God to manifest and take the gifts that he has given us aside and use them and move mighty, we have to also do our part. Amen. &gt;&gt; By praying for the service. Amen. Remember in the time of Solomon, they prayed and the presence of God was so much that the place became smokey that they could not even what minister anymore. And God is more than able to repeat those things again &gt;&gt; because it's the same yesterday, today, and forever. It's up to us what do you want? If you desire him, he going to come. He'll show himself once your heart is clean and your motive is right. It's not for something that you want to achieve to be puffed up or to lift yourself up. But the more that God use you, the more you even humble yourself because you realize that you have nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; It's him that doing it. &gt;&gt; It's him in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It bring you rest. It doesn't bring competition. &gt;&gt; It bring you rest because you know it's God doing it. Amen. It's not by power or by might but by my spirit says the Lord. Amen. It's God's spirit. We are feeding on unfailing reality of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our God is good. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Let's give God an applause. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Our God is good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And one other thing that um one other thing you see when we read in Joshua it says that every place that you put your feet that place is given to you. &gt;&gt; So it means that footstep means possession. You got to make a move. You have to what? Put your foot forward and do something because an idle hands God will not use it. He said the hands that does not work that hands should not even eat. But we talking of he said Phillip you talking about grace grace grace grace grace. So if the grace of God what do we have to do? You have something to do. You have a part to do too. Grace, can you please put on this paragraph 73 to 75 for me in the um in the paradox? Yeah. He said, "And they if they are ready, I can't get h I can't get enough of this. I really I know I came across it and I fall in love with it and they if they would have continued on the promise wasn't given to them under the law. The promise was given before the law without any condition to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because remember when he came to Abraham it's not what you have done. God said I there was no condition. He told Adam if you do this if you do not do that. But Abraham God did not give me any condition. So when it come to Abraham the seed of Abraham it gave them without any conditions to it. I have given you this land go on over onto it. But before they got to the promise, they decided there was something they must do themselves. That's the problem. Every time we want to put our hands to touch it to make sure that we're doing something. Verse 74. And that we still find that among human beings we prone to be that way. There is something we got to do. We feel that we got to have something into it also. Yes, you do have something into it. That is your surrender of your own will. That's the part we have to do. Your own ideas to the will and idea of almighty God and is finished. That's all there is. Just like he is promised. Don't think of nothing else. walk by it and God does the rest. So we have a part to do. &gt;&gt; Our part is to surrender our will to his will. No one said my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts as heaven is higher than so. My thoughts and my ways are higher than your ways. So we have to get to that place that we surrender our own will to the will of God. And what is the will of God is a re is the word of God is a revelation part of the word of God. Even the Lord says by when he was here in the Gethsemane, the Bible said that he prayed earnestly that even his sweat became blood and in the end he said, "Lord, not my will, let thy will be done." How many of us are willing tonight to die to our own ideas and ask God that his perfect will be done in everything that we do because we don't want our own ways. We want God ways to be our way. Even though the road may be rough and steep, but when he leads you, that is enough. Amen. So I want God's way to be my way is his way is perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. But so many times we try to add our own thoughts, our own ideas, mess it up with the word of God and come with traditions and cultures, missing all of them in the word of God. God want to get rid of all those cultures and traditions and everything and have that pure word of God in our heart and relax on that so that his perfect will will be done in our lives because so many times we are full of it our own race our own thing David one time try to just that's why the Bible said that Let her kill it. But the spirit that giveth life because in those times when David got the um anointing to bring the ark, yes, it was the word of God. Yes, it was the word of God that the ark has to come back to Israel. But he failed to contact what the high priest, the those areas. He just contact his generals and he did it and two people died of it. That wasn't God's perfect will. &gt;&gt; And as a Christians, we don't want God's permissive role because he gave his permissive role to Balam. &gt;&gt; And Bam was so full of it that when even his donkey was talking to him, he didn't even see that it was God speaking through that donkey. Amen. So we don't want to get to a place that we get so much um I don't know what word to use but we get so much um sidetrack or what consumed with our own ideas that we broke everything out. Let us be open and let us see what God will have us to do with it. What is perfect will for us? Because without God's perfect willful, we're gonna make break mistake. We have made mistakes in the past, we still going to make mistakes. But it's time as sons and daughters of God to sit down and make sure that in all our decisions, we include God in it &gt;&gt; and look for his perfect will. Because sometimes uh even myself made me say we prone to listen to man so much sometimes. It doesn't matter how high the person in checking with the word. Check your heart what God is telling you what your heart feels what God is revealing to you about the situation and check it in the word of God and let God's perfect will be done. If David would have consulted the high priest, those two people would not have lost their life. So in everything, check it back. Even in the church when you got a revelation, God has given us a pastor. Check it back and see if it's line up with his vision. Because if somewhere said that you cannot go higher than your pastor. So you have a revelation something to do with the church don't just run it off with your friends or your brothers and act on it. Always run it through him through your deacons everything and check it up. Then God will confirm because he has given those officers to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you respect them and you obey them and you believe that God is hiding there, God can use those offices to help you. &gt;&gt; But if you think that you know more than that, just like um brother Des said last week, what's his name? um uh in Moses time um in Moses Korea in Dayton they think they know more than Moses because why one time Moses father-in-law visited him and he saw that there was so much load on Moses he said I take your anointing and let it go on the 70 elders and God gave them that spirit on them and when God began to deal with them, they forgot that it was through Moses that God gave them the anointing. So he think that they are powerful. They more than they know more than Moses. And what happened? God has to open the door and swallow all of them. &gt;&gt; So if you are a member of the church, don't think you know more than your pastor. If you know more than him, God will have made you that pastor. So let's just rally behind him and do not cause any confusion. Rally your revelation in line with his thought so that we all going to be in harmony and have things going on because there is no time to waste. All the scriptures, everything that has to fulfill &gt;&gt; for us to go home has all been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; There's nothing left by the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are going to take up the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are in the process leading to an event. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything points to that. The whole world were framed by the word of God and that is holding the whole world. But now the whole world, the third world, all those things are not happening because you and me are here. Amen. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And back to when the Lord Jesus, the Bible said that he prayed earnestly. And if he prayed earnestly, what about you and me? We need to pray sincerely. We need to pray earnestly. We need to be serious with our prayer life. Amen. No wonder the Bible said that Elijah was a man subject to like passion like you and me. and he prayed earnestly that it should not rain for three and a half years and it never rain. So in other words, God is trying to tell us if we have the same faith and believe and we pray sincerely, there's nothing that God is going to withhold us. Somewhere it said that there's no good thing that God would withhold from those that walk what? Righteously before him, he will never withhold any good thing from you. &gt;&gt; Just cheer up and relax. All is well. &gt;&gt; All is well. &gt;&gt; All is well. &gt;&gt; Amen. The woman his daughter was even dead. She never considered that. Amen. The prophet asked him her, "Is anything everything well with ye?" "Yes." "With your son?" "Yes." "All is well." That's the faith that we have to have. No matter what condition we go through, no matter what happens, have confidence that all is well. &gt;&gt; As we rest, said that I will never forsake thee, nor leave thee. I'll be with you even in you. Amen. And the Bible said that all that was in Christ, all that was in God, he poured into what? Christ. And all that was in Christ, he poured into what? his church that is you and me his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all the heaven everything is inside of you. It's you have to activate that gift. It's you that have to bring it to pass. It's your part &gt;&gt; to bring it to pass. Pray, seek God, do all your part. Don't be scared. And one time in Brabraham ministry, he was saying that um a missionary was going somewhere and they told him that oh that place you go in there this I forgot the exact word they used. In other words, there was like mosquitoes or some bad animals that going to harm the man. And the man said that if God is sending me then that place is the best place for me to be. Amen. So what am I saying? If God is leading you to where it doesn't matter what the situation is the best place for you. I believe that because God was for Daniel. Lion's den was the best place for them to be at that time. The lion could not do nothing to because God was behind Daniel. &gt;&gt; Amen. The E Hebrew children, they were in the fiery furnace &gt;&gt; because that was the best place for them to be at that time. &gt;&gt; Even the people who were trying to put them in that fire, they killed some of them. Amen. But God, the son of man, the false man was in the fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if God is with you wherever you are, you don't have to be afraid. No matter if they said cover I remember when the co came. Sorry when the cover came in it in its fierest time when people were scared to go anywhere the Lord put in brother desper myself to go to Jamaica. We were not scared about the co because that was the best place for us to be at that time and people were even shocked. Why are you guys going there? Because God sent us there. Amen. He was with us. Even though everybody was scared, but because God sent us to that place, it was the best place for us to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. So wherever God is sending you, no matter what the circumstances, no matter what the obstacles, no matter how it seems bad the situation is is the best place for you to be there because God will be there at that time to help you. Musicians, can you prepare to come? Amen. He's on time. God, &gt;&gt; Amen. He will not be there. He'll be there right on time. He may not come when you want him to, but he'll be there right on time. He's the same yesterday to them forever. Ah, God is awesome. Amen. Hallelujah. No matter what. Amen. I want God's way to be by way. Hallelujah. Um, can you please the paragraph 145 for me? race in the paradox paragraph 145 in concluding did you find it the last one? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So um in concluding you guys can you can read this with me and then I pray then we go. God let me be let me so be blended. Let me be so dead to myself and anything around me but be conscious of the word of God living among us today. Let us pray. Oh our gracious eternal God and we are so grateful and thankful for everything you've done. Help us to be there to our own thoughts, our own ideas. Oh God, that we'll be able our thoughts will always line up with yours and your perfect will be done our lives. Father, we surrender our whole being into you tonight. Oh God, you told us the part that you have to do is to surrender our will, our thoughts, our ideas, everything to you so that your perfect will be done their lives. May you bless everyone here tonight, oh God. And if they have any that they have need of, may you grant their heart desire because you promise in your word that you give us the desires of our heart. Oh father, we live in a time and age that we have come to that place that oh God, we need you more than ever been before. Oh, we thank you and we love you and we appreciate you. May you go before us and bless our day and night. Lord, please bring us back on the Friday in the prayer meeting. Oh God, praying for the Sunday service and bless the Sunday service. We thank you and you love you. Bless our precious pastor Simon and his wife and his family and continue to bless our pastor Danny and his family Lord and bless the deacons the tris and officers and the lady Lord even our children Lord that you bless every one of us in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
