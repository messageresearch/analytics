of lord this morning i believe we got something great every time we come into the presence of the lord every time because in his presence there's fullness of joy aaron's wrought butt there's life so get into his presence amen we're going to read from proverbs um 4. from five to eight then i'm gonna read a a quote a little different this morning i just feel inspired amen get wisdom get understanding forget it not we know that brother braham said wisdom is revelation [Music] neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee now he's not talking about a woman here talking about revelation wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy get in get understanding exalt her and she shall promote thee she shall bring thee to honor when thou do embrace her the revelation brother branham speaking here [Music] now the greek word for revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of the sculpture unveiling his work exposing it to the unlooker it is the uncovering revealing what has previously been hidden now on the uncovering is not only revelation of the person of christ but it is the revelation of his future works in the upcoming seven church ages the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be over emphasized revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now i'm not talking about the book of revelations and you i'm talking about all revelation it is tremendously important to the church do you remember in matthew 16 when jesus asked the disciples this question who do men say that i is the son of man m they said some say that thou are john the baptist some elias some jeremiah and and one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that i am and peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed are simon bardurna flesh and blood had not revealed it unto you but my father which is in heaven has revealed it unto thee it was revelation read it the way it's written flesh and blood has not revealed it but my father had revealed it and upon this revelation i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it don't tell me what he said tell me what he meant and this morning we're under such a great ministry amen a revealing ministry we have the opportunity if we seek the lord amen to receive what he meant and when we get what he meant the revelation that's what brings the changes it means more to us this morning to seek for that than anything else believers amen hallelujah god bless you [Music] i [Music] i'll go [Music] i'll [Music] the churches [Music] [Music] me [Music] i'll go [Music] hallelujah sometimes that way it's not the most popular way with the world people who might know you but take up your cross this morning and follow him [Music] as a dare planted [Music] [Applause] in your [Applause] [Music] you alone [Music] [Music] my spirit [Music] these eyes [Music] [Music] even though [Music] much more [Music] [Music] she [Music] you are [Music] i want you more [Music] is [Music] i [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah giving praise this morning [Applause] hallelujah i heard solomon said yesterday in the scriptures and kings he says heavens of heavens can't even contain you but you choose to live in our heart amen what a powerful thing this morning to have him in our hearts this morning and welcome into the house of god to worship him to give him praise the gift of honor and to give him glory you happy to be in this house this morning [Applause] greater than all my sin is the grace that still pardons he still pardons this morning pray that i know my sin is [Applause] [Music] [Music] i know i know [Music] [Music] it's the blood it's the grace [Music] [Applause] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] i [Music] [Music] is is [Applause] say hallelujah this morning hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] i want to do a little song this morning it's a song that i was inspired by reading this scripture and i have to read it because it's it was been on my heart all week so it's it's it's matthew 22 where jesus was talking about the parable of a king who drew a wedding feast for his son so he says here go ye therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find bid to the marriage so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests [Music] and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not away in a garment and he said unto him friend how can thou hater have another wedding garment and he was speechless then said the king bind him hand on foot and take him away and cast him into the outer darkness there you shall be weeping of teeth for many a called fewer chosen but abraham said that where the garment was the holy ghost amen so this song [Music] how many [Music] [Music] will [Music] oh what you gonna do when the church is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] people all around me they'll still say i just don't believe that what you're gonna do [Music] be sure [Music] there's no more [Applause] [Applause] [Music] what you gonna [Music] [Applause] is [Music] sing with me this morning [Music] [Music] [Applause] your life around you better get in when there's still time what you're gonna do [Music] what you gonna do one more time [Applause] one more time what you gonna do [Music] [Music] she [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i had somebody told me the other day that what if you're wrong they invited me to go to colorado celebrations and told me i was self-righteous [Music] what you is [Music] eternal father lord jesus this morning father we come to your presence and we approach thy jones by your grace his grace alone not by our righteousness lord nothing could that we have done to deserve salvation it is your grace that lead us to you father this morning we approach your truth by faith as our father abraham approached thy truth by phrase so father we are abraham seed the royal seed of abraham we believe your word lord we have gathered in your presence lord may your spirit draw nigh unto us oh jesus once again washes with all your blood that father we may enter in each and every single one of your bride will enter as your seventh lord comes take him aside oh jesus this morning lord speak through him to our hearts that o god

clap this morning amen [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Applause] are you washed in the blood is [Applause] is [Applause] [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] in [Applause] oh [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] of the lord heavenly father lord jesus what a wonderful day what a wonderful time to be living lord god and lord jesus all the blessings that you give to us lord and now it's time lord for us to give back to you lord let our offering today be like abel's was and and and when it was given to melchizedek lord let it be lord a blessing to you we pray in jesus name amen amen good morning everybody it's good to be in the house of god giving him all the praise the honor and the glory once again as the song says we are together again amen just praising the lord giving praise and honor and glory unto him praise god hallelujah i want to make you aware if you're not that brother emmanuel you know brother emmanuel who is usually here with his family they take up maybe one or two pews and um lively fellow and he has taken his flight and gone to be with the lord i went home to africa i believe he told me was to visit his homeland namibia south africa zambia zimbabwe and congo or whatever else but he got such a terrible attack that he passed on and took his flight to be with the lord so we want to extend our sympathy uh words of comfort and actions that show our love to touch the life of that family as we know young jack will be the one that is now in charge of that family his mother is not here she's over there and she's so emotionally distraught that he has to handle everything uh from here so let's pray for him in particular and also let us remember the entire family that needs our blanket of support as a church of god now um they have no father not that they're kids but they're young people but they still need to have a strong male figure there so any one of us that are anointed with the spirit of god can fill that role from time to time and i do believe they after this is over they'll certainly appreciate fellowship uh and they'll certainly appreciate visits and calls but right now and things would be so caught up you know how it is phone calls dress paperwork all kinds of things but just so you know that you're aware of this and our hearts can go out to them of course um brother philip as the deacon was over there and spent until late in the night talking comforting praying encouraging them on praise the lord of course i spoke with them more than once and we trust that god will bring them through this and that they will not come out as bruised reeds but they'll come out stronger than they were before looking ahead and not looking back and forgetting those things which are behind the lord bless you real good now let's go to the word of god um because we are here uh to have church not to have uh we have no programs to attract attention uh we have no great advertisements or stuff of that nature the only thing we have is the anointed and revealed word of god and we're trusting that the god who anointed the prophet with healing and miracles will in the same manner anoint the word of god so that none of us will get to the place like israel got to and complain oh this plain bread and i realized it was angels food they were eating was heavily bred they were eating but it's so simple it appears so simple and so humble that unless you're really watching uh you won't recognize what is really taking place but you'll see because god himself will break forth he will break forth of himself we don't have to bring him down or call him up or drum him down or sing him down or sing him in or dance him down or whatever the word will do all of that if we put our faith and the confidence in the word of god god bless you praise the name of the lord our scriptures are found in psalms chapter 1 verses 1 to 3. then we will follow reading that with revelation chapter 22 verses 1 to 7 and our thought or topic will be fruits on the tree of life fruits on the tree of life you can say from the tree of life but i'd rather say fruits that are now like hanging on that tree of life praise the lord amen let's read the scripture blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly stand it in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law do he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he do it shall prosper amen now we'll read from revelation chapter 22 verse 1 verses 1 to 7 praise the lord let us read and he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb and in the midst of it on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bear twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads and there shall be no night there and they need no candle near the light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and they shall reign forever and ever and he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and the lord god of the holy prophets sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass will be done behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book praise the lord father thank you so much for your word that you have sent forth and provided for us all down through the ages until the present time and we give you praise honor and glory father in jesus name amen and amen please be seated it's wonderful i believe brother tim read the scripture about the importance the supreme importance of revelation coming forth for uh god's people believers and because god has been giving forth his word casting light on our pathway so that we can see how to walk and we can avoid the dangers because of the word being the light onto our feet and the lamp to our path uh and i believe friends that we ought to be so thankful uh when we recognize and realize what god has been doing through the years giving the word to the prophet and then the prophet saying after i leave here you're going to play tapes after i leave here you are just going to listen to my tapes alone because i have been made pastor oh my i'm letting you know that the prophet is dead we have the message and before he left here he started putting the importance of even in the seal books he said it i must decrease that he might increase when that mighty angel came down on uh mount sunset he he said two of us can't be on the earth at the same time one of us has to go and you know many coats are there he's i see my end you know he knew he was going and he had to leave because another person was coming on the scene and this was not another human being because he plainly said all the other angels were man of the earth but that one in the front with the swept back wings he said that was the lord from heaven so it was the lord that was the second coming of the lord amen to the bride appearing to her first by the opening of the word and then taking out her out of here hallelujah he's helping her to prepare for his own uh coming so that white when he comes they leave and go together and we ought to be so thankful that god has opened the eyes of our heart to see the word and to appreciate the word of god amen and uh that we have the ability uh to recognize the word because not everybody can recognize the word they can read the word they can hear the wording and listen to preaching but to recognize what you are hearing that's another matter because only the elect the bride will fully recognize what god is actually saying and what he is doing in the present time amen this day is this scripture fulfilled amen praise the lord so we must recognize it and when you fully recognize it you almost can't help it you you want to give your whole life to it you want to give your own life your whole life to him and for him to rule over your life you see well uh brother simon i want to do that but i make so many mistakes i i got problems even in my uh thinking yeah i get problems in my walk in my talk in my whatever area but i thank god no matter what comes my way your way there is there is a still a fountain filled with blood opened in the house of david that cleanses god's people amen that blood when you confess and repent of your sins the blood will erase everything amen why you're dropped it in the bleached blood of christ hallelujah and that blood cleanses you and brings you to a place where you can say i'm justified hallelujah you never done it in the first place amen you didn't do it because the spirit of god not only cleanse you from it but you're justified i haven't really started into the message yet but the holy spirit's got me commenting like this because you see uh when uh if you uh went to the courts and and they pardon you or you went to the courts and the judge uh you know dismissed the case and put put it off or something like that what i'm trying to say is is that you did commit the crime that's the reason why you had to be pardoned but what the prophet is saying we we we are justified you never done it in the first place and the reason why is because this satan used this man out here that he has influence over to do all the sinning and to do all the evil and to enjoy the pleasures of this world and everything else and then when he done it then he turns wrong and he accused your soul he accuses your gene your spirit but god is trying to tell you get the understanding and the revelation of who you are that is why james said this seed of god do not commit sin it can't commit sin because that seed is a part of god himself it's a portion of him it's a little messiah of him praise god just a little portion signified by the little licks of flame that came down when the apostles dear pentecost acts 2 4 but that's what it is so the man inside can't see him but when you sin on the outside this man outside doing and saying and thinking all those things that's not the real you doing that because the real you that's on the inside cannot do that because you were elected and placed here as a part of god amen now it's a difference uh i still can't get off of this to get to what i want to say here the fact is that there's a difference between a sinner and one who sins because you know that a sinner is one who just sins by nature the other one he he he just he just make a mistake the other woman she just that's not her nature that's not his nature he feels bad after that happens whenever that happens he feels bad the other one it happens they don't bother them they go and do it again they'll do it again they'll do it again you know a sinner by by habit by nature amen praise and by choice but on this other hand uh this one is making mistakes they slip they fall they they do things they do that praise god and the difference again there is one is a sinner and the other one is a son or daughter oh praise god yes jesus said your servant you can fire them you can kick them out of your house forever amen but your son your daughter there's nothing you can do about it amen you can't do anything about it because your blood is in them there's nothing you can do about it he's already a son she's already a daughter what are you gonna do about it all you can do is speak to them tell them how to do it better forgive them and walk on praise god and that's what god does with us praise the lord and we must be very careful don't let the devil trick us amen hallelujah like brother george smith when he was preaching here said how that the devil encourages you to go and do something then when you do it then he's the first one to call the police force on you to to to arrest you amen see he's the one that does that but it's a different thing when you realize your position and that you are not ruled by your present condition because the condition doesn't change your sonship your daughterhood or your position in christ one is your position the other one is your condition you might be under the most horrific condition just like the other guy but you have sonship back of you you've got a gene you got a seed you got a life you got an election of god ruling over your life so your conditions outside maybe changes stormy smoky whatever this that but your position does not change it remains the same for jesus said for a son abideth in the house forever but the servant yes you can you can fire him get rid of him or her but the son there's nothing much you can do about that amen thanks be the god we ought to thank god for that and praise him that he takes our sins away into the sea of his forgetfulness i just want to stop and again here's it here it goes now i want you to know only really god can forget about what people are talking about that oh oh forget about that forget about this this person you see the the believer doesn't walk a wrong remembering past hurts and past pains this and that there are few things might bother you but the fact is um you don't walk around that way but you will it will always be there somewhere in the vaults of your memory as long as you're here on earth until you're gone then those things will be gone away but only god can really forget because everything we do say think here it's like on a tape is that right and that tape is going to be played back it's going to be replayed so you can't go erasing those things now it's not going to happen only god alone can do that amen and that's the beauty of forgiveness that you may even remember past hurts but because you forgive there is nothing there nothing there holding you praise the lord hallelujah praise the name of god i believe i can go ahead now praise the lord now i want you to realize that um when jesus died on calvary and gave up the ghost that life that was in the lamb of god came upon his bride came up on his church his people that life is the one i'm talking about that is here with us here today by the grace of god and that is as real to me as uh anything else thank god for that thank god so the the word the the life that was in that lamb when he gave up the ghost the holy ghost that life come came back on the church of god and began to work through god's people right on down to this age until the word is on and in the bride of jesus christ for this hour amen praise god hallelujah that's wonderful because with that life in us as you know we've preached a week or so ago on the life that pleases god and we found out that the only life that can really please god is the life of jesus christ so uh him in you gives you a life that pleases god or the life that pleases god amen hallelujah amen and when we come in contact with the life that is in the word then we find out it grants gives to us a burning love and desire within our hearts amen we want to please god we we want to praise god we want to worship god we want to come into god's house we we don't need uh special treats and all kinds of encouragements you know the message has passed the hour when the pastor or any shepherd should be out there chasing sheep sheep are supposed to follow the pastor those days are over in the first second pull of this message now it's individual revelation and if individual revelation does not keep you cemented as your stone or part in the cap in this pyramid in the solomon's temple for this hour then like your children going to school you can't watch them 24 hours the pastor can't watch you 24 hours the pastor wasn't here to accept to spy on you and watch every move what you dress what you wear what you eat what you drink what you do this do that there is something god has sent a life that will keep you regardless of who is there you're kept by the power of god truth faith through revelation of this word you are kept by faith amen praise god so just settle in your hearts and believe god don't think about hell don't think about backsliding and all these kinds of things we know it exists but it exists for those who has to be weeded out is that right hallelujah the the out of the blessed subtractions out of the church of the living god so that it will come down uh i'm talking about the winnowing of the wheat seeds when you know in the old days you throw them up in the air and the wind will blow praise god and and the carried away with the wind while the the weight of the seed will still be in the basket amen that's what i'm talking about now you are kept by not the pastor you you kept not by this or that but now you kept completely by the word your recognition of the word your love of the world the very power of the world that's working in your life keeps you by the grace of almighty god hallelujah i'm so thankful for that amen and that we must realize that we as i've uh spoken before we are eternal beings i'm going to read the future home of the heavenly bright and bright groom where the prophet said you are not if you are elected you are a believer you are not creatures of time amen he says you come from eternity you're going back to eternity amen hallelujah praise god forevermore amen yes sir so god really sent us down here as jeans uh to live in flesh amen that we might be upon this earth so he can be a father some of us can maybe be sick so he can be a healer some of us will have these conditions he can be a savior some can be without money to pay their rent and he can be a provider he can show all of his attributes the very prism of this personality bursting with life the power of almighty god strikes the soul hallelujah and the word unfalls before us amen hallelujah yes sir praise god amen so we did not come down here on this earth seeking or searching for eternal life because we were always having eternal life but we didn't know that we had eternal life we had to be brought out of our spiritual amnesia to recognize who we really are we thought we were beggars when we realize that we are kings and priests we thought we were slaves and servants then we recognize we are sons and daughters are the living god it changes the whole picture everything changes hallelujah amen praise god so when you walked in to the services whether here or somewhere else and all the call was given we of course didn't know this so we went up to the altar or we responded to the call thinking that we are seeking eternal life i got to get eternal life i got to get it uh oh praise god if i don't get it i i may be going to hell if i don't get it i mean mr rapture hallelujah those were the things that we were thinking at that particular time amen hallelujah not knowing that eternal life was in us that he was there as the song says all the time waiting patiently for you to come to a place of recognition of who you are and what was happening within your life hallelujah praise god so let me come now as i slowly go to this now we were not really seeking eternal life because you were eternal life you are having eternal life what we felt the desire for but didn't know it was redemption hallelujah because you were sold into sin by eve you were caught in the devil's pawn shop of this world and you had no way out unless the owner your owner bought you back and brought you out of the pawn shop and that is what rally jesus came to do all that are his all that the mind will come to me all the father has given me will come to me praise god you see he said i'm not come comfortable for the i only come to for the uh sheep uh uh the lost sheep amen that's what he came for praise god but whosoever will may come but this is what i really come for whosoever will can come to church who has whosoever will can uh join something somewhere or the other but i'm really coming back for my elect i'm coming back for a bride i'm coming back for those that were blinded and lost during these seven ages of the church and i'm going to bring them back buy them back and bring them back to their original condition into the house of the living god amen hallelujah oh thank god that we have been redeemed can you say that we've been redeemed by the blood of jesus christ not with silver or gold but with the precious blood of the lord jesus christ hallelujah amen i'm glad that we're living in this day when the mighty eagle is flying over the lands wherever god's people are hallelujah in the densest part of africa in the hottest parts of india in the most spontaneous parts of china wherever it is up in the north over in europe thus great eagle is flying over hallelujah and he knows all them that are his hallelujah amen and what he's doing now he's come to he's calling out to his own amen they feel the spirit's call they know the pull amen praise god that little eagle in the barnyard he never heard an eagle before but the moment he heard that eagle screamed he recognized the voice hallelujah he recognized amen that that was a voice speaking calling hallelujah he never heard an eagle's language before but yet when he heard that language something fits his soul like that praise god forevermore i'm so glad brother sister that this word fit my soul completely amen oh my my my praise god there's nothing else for me to do but to press on until he calls us out of here amen lord of god amen thank god forevermore i'm so glad that i'm one of his own praise god but you laid there dormant amen from the time you were born that gene lay in you there dormant you did not know why you couldn't do like other men and women were doing we all did our part of sinning so there's nothing for us to play holier than zou than anybody else we did our parts of sinning but the fact is even while you were sinning you just don't feel right you just can't be like this other person i can remember even when i was way back in school just a young kid and other boys would get angry with one another and they would look for broken glass or something else to harm the other person i couldn't do that i couldn't do simple things and then i wonder why am i so like this i can't do that i can't do this i can't do and it's not because somebody's telling you you can't do it you just don't feel inside of you something is holding you that you can't do it there's a line that you're not you cannot cross because you will you see gifts and columns are without repentance you were kept by god even long before you were even saved prophet said you think you're just wandering here like that and stumbling no he says you're here because the spirit let you hear amen praise god glory to god the great holy spirit has brought us to this hour hallelujah and that gene lay in you and lay in me amen until it could manifest the life that it was praise god amen hallelujah i thank god that when i heard the word read the word and the holy spirit hit that gene that was hidden up inside that thing burst into life the seed life broke open and it began to grow in the grace of almighty god hallelujah amen and i thank god for it amen glory to his marvelous wonderful name amen glory to god hallelujah listen to i'm reading from the rapture book here amen if you are in christ there's not a word written in here that you will not believe i don't care what anybody else says when god makes that thing manifested amen what i mean is cause when he pours that spirit on that word that gene word gene amen what happens then when the spirit is poured on it just like putting water on any other seed it will then live and bring forth what is supposed to bring forth after its kind hallelujah praise god so god wanted children after his kind is that right so a god kind or or a god men god women children of god what else is god going to bring forth goats bring forth goats donkeys donkeys horses horses and god gonna bring forth what nothing but a part of himself is that right it sounds unbelievable sometimes but it's true amen praise god hallelujah amen it'll bring forth after its kind oh then some of you say i got the baptism of the holy ghost that don't mean that you're even saved is that right my that doesn't mean you're saved because you see what is it's gonna be so crystal clear to you that the gene is already in you the baptism of the holy spirit is just the former latter rain that comes to claim those seeds and wake them up that they might break forth into life amen praise god oh my but let's not talk about that we'll touch it a little later see oh my so you got the baptism the holy ghost and there's been a lot of hullaboo about that in the message and stuff like that everybody got to have the holy ghost got to have the token don't know what the token really is and all that they don't realize that token part of it was already in you that's what i'm talking about all the time amen and the chinese abstract had to come down and connect with that to make it the full token hallelujah and to break forth into life make itself manifested a son and a daughter of the living god forgive me if i get excited because i'm seeing it so clear oh my listen my friends anytime any day now i'm preaching and you i just disappeared and just give it i'm gone in the rapture praise the lord i believe it this is not a joke it's true anything could happen yeah i mean he knocked walk with god and he was not he was and he wasn't he was there and he wasn't there you know he was there and he wasn't there philip was there and soon he wasn't there praise god brother ernie fandler told me he was one and brother he was in one of brother brandon's meetings and brother branham uh spoke to him and said sir uh he says they told you that uh you are not anointed by the holy ghost but i'm telling you now you're anointed by the holy ghost amen he says just about that time when he said it i don't know what happened i can't explain to you all i know is that i was in this 3000 large crowd and i was on this side of the crowd and when i come to myself i'm on that side of the crowd and nobody saw me move i didn't feel anything except that when i come to myself i feel like my head is on a feather pillow or something i was there and then i wasn't there i was over there he said oh my so he got a foretaste like of the rapture is that right praise god and i believe friends it's just like that amen we won't even feel or know anything except that we are in the presence of the lord hallelujah praise be to god hallelujah amen now remember you see we are made triune being with that little fellow inside a soul a spirit a body amen but remember caiphus that too soul spirit and body and having all that he went and he prophesied he says look even balaam had it too was a prophet and he prophesied but that don't have nothing to do with that man on the inside do you have a gene a seed life of god dwelling in your heart you can't put it there you can't go pray for and ask god to give you one now that is what he's talking that the devil is caught in his own uh wickedness because god had this plan before the foundational world is the picture's already been taken and you're in it or you're out of it is that right that's not by me that's by him i don't know who he's in and who's out but he knows who he's in and who's out and the point is in us he places the gene the seed the attribute which is the same thing in us as your blessed assurance that you come down from him and you have this in you that's going to take you back to him you're not going to be left here but it's going to take you right back to him because all that knows is the word that man inside knows is the word hallelujah see unless that was god's seed in there amen his gene from the beginning they are predestinated from him then you are finished amen see it's just you in that word that's christ bring it in there and watch that make itself known just as it opened up like any other seed and declared itself then this has to open up and declare itself for the age that it's living in hallelujah in other words you're not going to declare luther's age that age because that gene was predestinated for this age not to manifest justification back there and so on so on on gifts but that seed is here for its own purpose for god's own purpose amen see because you see you must understand that luther could only bring forth nothing but sprigs i use the word sprouts that's what he's saying that's not that's all luther could do because that's god's plan that the the life will come back up first as a sprout so the the saints in luther's age even though they had the same holy spirit that's in you the life that is in you they were not permitted to produce anything else their purpose on the earth was to manifest the spring or or of growth of the tree bright tree coming back to life again and all they could bear is that spig amen hallelujah that's the way it was hallelujah amen and so when the holy ghost falls in this age it's not for you to go out and be a lutheran to be bringing forth sprouts it's not to anoint you to go and bring forth for some other age but the spirit of god anoints you in this hour because it come from jesus who was the what the wheat seed the corner wheat that fall in the ground it must go through its cycle hallelujah and come back to what seed again the spoken word coming back now in the believers with god's power to transform goes back to being sons and daughters of god seed amen from seed to seed back again hallelujah praise be to god hallelujah so the principle here is you can only manifest that portion of the word you are supposed to display i should put it more generally the people of this age can only manifest that part of the world they are supposed to display but we happen to be the ones that have come out of the last church age is that right and the last church age has already gone through its stages and it's gone right back to the very person of jesus christ and the only other person then jesus himself the male manifesting his own life the only other person that can do this other last part is his wife who has the other part of his life working in her life amen to manifest him to this generation praise god because what the bride or what we have here now is like the sum total of all the other ages all that luther had all that wesley had all this support all together come right down until we have this full cup full and running over in this day and in this hour by the word of god we know and have received things that prophets long to know but the devil is so cunning he makes people think they're they're just so ordinary just hear the message every day there's nothing to it it's just the word it's just the bible relax yourself you don't have to bother with that he they don't realize what is going on he don't want you to know that you got you got the real acts 238 amen and he's scared of that because when you wake up that you i realize you really got an axe in your hand and 2 38 to blast him out of of existence then he gets scared when you recognize what is really happening but if you just read the scripture acts 2 38 amen it's just acts 2 38 but when you realize no no no i've been given 2 38 and given a big axe to take off his head praise god hallelujah but thank god even though though luther was an early stage worker i repeat what i've said before he gets the same salvation like you and i will get in this last part of the day is that right we come in the last part of the day and we are working for the lord now and he did that early part and he gets the same page just like you're going to be getting we're not going to have no bigger salvation than anybody else we all have the same salvation doesn't matter you say oh paul oh elijah those guys they really have salvation we all got it and we all got it there's no part of it is less than the other one we all got salvation it's when we come to the judgment seat of christ for rewards then will be the difference where god begins to reward those that work and you know did things for him and for his kingdom for the glory of god hallelujah amen praise god so i'm glad that luther had complete eternal life now i go to christ is revealed in his own word listen to this and i'm deliberately slow and when i feel like stopping i'll stop and if i have to continue it another time i will but for now let's deal with it now this is paragraph i believe 76 here for jesus himself you know is the interpretation of the entire bible do you believe that and he is manifest manifesting himself and is made manifest in the age of whatever part of his body is being made manifest in other words like i said before if it is a foot age it can't go manifest in their eyes if it's a fingerage or a mouth age it can't manifest something else right that's why the prophet's talking about don't get your lines tangled in these kinds of times you can't get tangled up and recognize not recognizing what age you're supposed to be in and what's supposed to be made manifest in and through your life praise god hallelujah now see if it's a hand age then it must manifest beyond see it cannot go and try to be a head age if it's a voice age well then it can't decide to go back there and be a foot age if it's uh see see now now we know now that's why he was here we are now living in the i age are you following me and now the next after that i is is he himself to come on the scene that's what i'm telling you that he is here his appearing among us now is only preparing us for his coming that is why we are receiving rapture in faith rapture revelation for faith is a revelation amen praise god now remember see now prophet said here i'm that is prophetic see because we are now in the i age but the next is to be he himself he says prophetic amen that means after he's gone hallelujah he puts you in the hand of the spiritual joshua for this hour which is jesus christ himself amen to take you across the river to the better land to buell tubular land if you want to call it amen but presently he brings you over into the new found land of this revealed word hallelujah praise god forevermore now see down through the edge we started off from the foundations he's trying to get this truth in from the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete seed went into the ground then it comes up back through the feet luther come up then through wesley then into them pentecostal which is the tones now of that body then the lipsy now i'm saying again it's now in the eyes that was his ministry right the word manifesting that is in the eyes prophetic of malachi 4 and so forth now there's nothing else left for it to come but he himself has got to come and step into that what his body for this hour the son of man now being revealed not in the form of the headship but in a bright form or in the form of a bride so the devil is his mind is blood because he's looking for jesus that jesus that was back there to come back and while he's looking for jesus to come back there here is a many member body running around glorifying god praising god fulfilling the word making jesus christ known amen and they know they and their father are one they're one same ingredients same portion a temple full of water from the ocean is same as if the whole ocean it has the same chemical values it ain't going to be different it's the same thing it's just the portion that is it might be smaller but it's the same thing i and my father are one you and your father are really one one the man inside amen because you are him being revealed praise god hallelujah oh my so then the last thing there it is he has got to come himself and step into that praise god the next then when that's here the next thing will be is the intelligence starts coming that's what's coming right here now supernatural spiritual intelligence amen not man-made intelligence not me going and saying oh brother simon must have studied the message for 40 years maybe he prayed under some trees maybe he was up all till midnight and this and that yes i did a lot of that stuff in the early part of the message praise god but i i come to discover god is making it known no that is good but that's not what you need to depend on hallelujah all you have to do is relax let go and let me start to give you uh insight into my mind of what i'm seeing and what i want done and then speak that then it's not you it's me from the lord hallelujah making himself known that you recognize jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever lord of god hallelujah amen you see then we recognize we have no intelligence then of our own when this start to happen you start to realize you don't have no intelligence of your own doesn't matter what school you went to i don't care what you know all the man's knowledge is pittance to god imagine that you have a chance to break into god's wisdom god's knowledge god's intelligence of course you don't walk in there when you feel like you want to walk in but you are invited in what is necessary for you to go in there uh a man and walk and go allowed to go behind the veil praise god so oh my we have no sight of our own no intelligence no man could foresee those things he cannot do it prophet said i want to tell you it's god himself doing all of that praise god it's be coming to a place that he's governed the body all the way through then now the complete body of christ is revealed now in the form of a bride that was taken out of his sight like adam was back then at the beginning but now hallelujah she comes from his side where does she come from and his side his adam back there was flesh but he back here is what the word and she comes as a part of him out of the word she becomes a word bride which is a part of himself amen we're not conscious of it the prophet said you're not really conscious of it but as you walk and that spirit begins to reveal and make known you begin to recognize little by little just like a baby's eyes being opened up first it's foggy and smoky but then after a while you you the path of the just shall be a shining light as men as they approach that perfect day praise god i tell you friends the ours come when the power and presence and revelation of the living god is striking the bride of jesus christ amen hallelujah now see if you are in christ there is not a word in there that you will not believe you will believe every single word of the living god hallelujah amen praise god and as i said before if the holy spirit the rain the the rain of the spirit falls on the genuine gene life seed oh praise god oh if you could ever be able to recognize this it would be a real blessing you know you can have a church full of people and i repeat i've preached to thousands 50 000 at one time and i've gone into little villages and towns and started churches with two so numbers is not the thing that impresses me i'm looking for god and whether he's behind hiding behind two or ten or fifty or ten thousand amen that's what i'm looking for praise the name of the lord jesus praise god so you you see you've got a real nice friends that's uh the holy spirit falls on that gene that is in you and i and then begins to water that gene amen you begin to the water of the world isn't that what he said in the church book if the seed be planted the water will rise it up again the water will raise it up again praise god forevermore i'm glad it has raised it up inside of me amen and bring it to a manifestation praise the lord amen so he was there all the time just waiting for for when the holy spirit of god would come amen praise god so you you realize then that we come eternal we're baptized to the holy ghost i'm trying to i'm doing several things here or he is trying to accomplish several things here he's trying to bring you out of your denominational way of thinking you say i'm in a message i don't think that anymore but you have a lot of backwash that you're not conscious of that's laying in you and he wants a pure spotless bride so he wants to get that out of us you didn't come here to get really saved and to get eternal life you come to be redeemed to be brought back and brought back where you come from you come here to the lord and you come and give your heart to him praise god because the seven years of the church ages are over and you're entering into the bride's jubilee to go back to your the things that you own you go back to your land go back to what god had for you you're going right back to it again hallelujah because you you fulfill the word you come through all the stages of the world and it's becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness or the rest of the world that's left to be fulfilled it it's becoming unto us to be able to do that glory to god hallelujah amen so when you come to the altar it didn't make you eternal because then eternal would have a beginning right but it just made you recognize that you have eternal life in you all the time as i illustrated some time ago how that when the the baby is born and the baby comes forth i don't know if the doctors do that today you know but the doc used to pick the babies up and then take his one hand and pow slap it on the bomb and if that's not a stillborn child that child is going to scream ah oh this one is a life glory to god hallelujah amen what is that the child didn't just get life when the doctor slapped it the child just manifested that it already had life in it and that is what i'm trying to tell you that we are thinking has to be changed the holy ghost is just washing us cleansing us and changing the way we think people are run up to the altar and say oh i got saved on this date you're eternal there's no date you got saved on you were saved before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world god already knew who was saved and who wasn't and and and we just are playing out the great drama the story of redemption now making itself manifested amen how could they know that he the lamb was slain except he come down going across and go through the entire drama so that the senses of a human could recognize that he did die for the sins of the world and so the same thing with us as believers we have got to follow in his stead and his footsteps to fulfill the rest of the story fulfill the word of the living god amen praise god so the doctor didn't put life in the child the child already had life in it uh let's come a little closer uh rising of the sun i wouldn't go through the coat i just talked off the top of my head where the prophet was talking about the car and he talks about the car can sit there with every mechanic everything could be right the church could be set up perfectly the singing the this everything perfect right and they can even have the word they're preaching the word it's the message of the hour he says but you see really the power is already in the gas the power is already in the world that you may be even preaching right it's there in the gas but the power that's in the gas will not be released until a spark hits it amen oh lord send the power just now send the holy spirit to quicken the word of god to bring that word to life amen amen oh my that's my prayer that god will quicken the word and make the word live or his words live for he has promised no word will return to me void it will accomplish what i sent it down here to accomplish and it will go back to come back amen and fulfill its purpose here upon the earth earth amen hallelujah amen i thank god that i already got power in my tank i got power gas within my thank tank glory to god hallelujah oh my what can what can you say uh how can i say this that we just sit here and we sit quietly and we just hear in the word of god and you're not seeing miracles breaking out you're not seeing uh fire or blood or smoke or something like that you see god it's what rebecca did if you read the story of rebecca when eliezer came and gave her all kinds of jewels all kinds of precious stones the bible said that she was more interested in hearing about isaac they're coming the brethren are coming her nephews are coming and they're bothering her when eliezer is trying to talk to her so she just took the whole stuff of jewels all them gifts that she got from him and she give it to them you can go off with the gifts you can run off with all of that but i want the word i want isaac i want to see this man i want to see jesus i only one look amen if i can only get a look a glimpse at him amen praise be to god forevermore so this my friends is the power that we are living in the power to be released and saying that anytime while we talking just like this that can happen very simple right it's happened before it can happen again it can happen again praise the lord amen yes i'm so careful because the devil will twist these things meaning you're talking about yourself but just like uh um down in south carolina speaking and while speaking just like this all of a sudden a lady a sister screams and runs up and throws herself in the front and and said oh i i i want to i want my husband to come back my husband you know is gone and to come back and that's years and said well we'll pray for you we prayed for her and what happened four o'clock the next morning they're banging on the door there's a storm in the city but something made that man walk through the storm he didn't even wait on a taxi and went right back home and that man turned to god and that man became a came a deacon in the church i went back and preached there and he they lived together and he was there as an officer in the church for a long time another one came up there ran up next time somewhere else and said oh you know i want i i want a child i want this i want that and before i could think that boy said i give it to you amen and that's the way it came to pass fulfill the word of god but just so you understand it's nothing that you can plan you can this you can that see because god stopped these things from pointing to a man so you're going to say this is a miracle man and that is a that brother has a healing that man has this that man has that no praise god god wants to bring all the glory to himself and even when sometimes those things happen he doesn't even want it to be advertised for anybody to know is that right naturally speaking of the wisest things to to advertise and people know my goodness this is a powerful church my god miracles have taken place there my no but god doesn't want that he wants you to walk with a hidden life hiding in thee hiding in thee thou bless rock villages i'm hiding in thee all right let's go on to to psalms 1 1-3 if you can put that scripture back up it'll be great and i think i'll deal with this and then i may just um begin to wind this up now but i sure want to show you this in the words psalms 1 1-3 and we can read it together while i'm reading blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor stand it in the way of sinners nor sit in the seat of the scornful but his delight when you see that his delight i'm bringing your attention to something this is speaking not only of a man who will live righteously but it's actually speaking about jesus christ himself right his delight is in the law or word of the lord and in his law dot he meditate day and night you know jesus said i came to do thy will oh god hallelujah amen and he shall be like a tree praise god you recognize brother branham made it clear he says the tree of life was jesus christ he was in the garden he was the tree of life and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters and brick that bringeth forth his fruit in his season thank god spiritual food comes in due season whether it's whichever church age there's different seasons in the year and different seasons in that seven day week that we are supposed to receive life and he brings forth whatever fruit he wants in that season as we've been talking about these different stages of the bodies and how it's going to develop they're true and each part must manifest its self in its divine position that god placed it amen praise god so it's wonderful to know that praise god and he shall bring forth fruit in his season and his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever you do it shall prosper aren't you glad that for that amen of course the leaves is speaking about believers right because you're going to read the rest of sam lift up your hands all you people let the leaves let the trees clap their hands he's really talking about people he's talking about believers his leaves can't wither they can't die they eternal right because that's what he is now let's go over into uh revelation 22 and read verses one to seven just a few things i'd like to bring out here amen and he showed me a pure river of water of life clearest crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb it's nice if you could paint a picture like that but the fact is that's talking about the pure word of god that flows right from his divine presence and coming forth to the true believers that will receive it that's what that's talking about uh river crystal clear but right away you imagine uh you're standing on a riverside like that but this river crystal clear hallelujah and there the tree of life on either side of the river was there the tree of life how can one tree be on both sides of the river at the same time how could that happen but you see it's not an ordinary tree it's the tree of life it's a supernatural tree and he's speaking to us of the old testament and the new testament and it's real life being there in the old testament and how it comes back in the new testament back there it was in the form of the male and on this side it's the female on the other side of the river but it's the same tree amen and that tree of life which bear 12 manner of fruits praise god not going to break everything down and and yielded our fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for what the healing of the nations that's what we here for hallelujah we are here uh to be many redeemers many saviors many messiahs however you want to describe it that's what we are here for to make his word manifested and uh i want you to know friends that the word of god come down through the ages hallelujah and begin to be brought back to us and we start being brought back to him praise god now we are not supposed to be the arms on the shoulders here because the body was made from the bottom coming up the feet and it comes up now to sanctification wesley cleansing of the whole system and stuff like that then it goes right up to the tongues the mouth or pentecost the towns and speaking and manifesting then it went to the sea age of the prophet of the he's talking about the building of a spiritual body and the prophet being the eyes of that body made manifest but after he said after i'm gone it's gonna be he himself for there are no more moving parts it will just be what the intelligence hallelujah and that intelligence i'm thankful to god now that is giving it to his beloved wife he is bringing his love secrets in her ears that she might recognize him that she might know him whom to know is life eternal praise be the god hallelujah amen now if you had come up in the pentecostal age then god will be requiring you to manifest gifts but you didn't come up in the pentecostal age you see lots of people don't realize that brother branham was actually the messenger for that age and he himself said many places the seven church ages are now over time shall be no more hallelujah time for the church ages doesn't mean time for the earth amen it's over and now brothers and sisters that time is over and it's come to the place now where it's no more arms and legs than this but the not fit to operate limbs and speaking tongues but fit to operate the word operate the revelation of the word i'll use another word to make it a little clearer to manifest the word of god so the people can recognize what god is doing in this hour hallelujah they can see god in his wife in his bride hallelujah recognizing him in her meekness in her long-suffering inner patience in the power that's in her life amen every aspect of him every family trait god's family traits will be recognizable in her and there'll no other truth these are christians they've been with jesus they've been not with brother branham even though we love him we recognize him and we know who he is we know his position his place and how god used him amen but they are acting like the word the they got certain attitudes actions like the word amen like jesus praise god i'm so glad you can say i'm one of them praise god hallelujah amen so i want you to know the seed has come through its cycle and we come back now and you are fruits of that word in the end time hanging on the branches of the tree of life the bright tree hanging on the branches ripening and sweetening under the hot sun of august under the sign of leo praise god the virgins pass now the time of the lion of lord praise god the warm hot reigns of the sun shining upon the fruits of god bringing it into a sweetness ready and prepared for his coming glory blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah may the lord bless every one of you here today amen god bless you pray for me and i pray for you amen where he leads me i will follow amen i can't say anymore i don't know where all of this is leading because i know where it's leading we're going to like that when the prophet looked in the vision he saw all those young men and young women marching marching marching he says and one set marched right to the lip of the hill and went down the precipice and the other set marched and they kept marching up into the skies praise god i believe we are on that trajectory right now by the holy spirit doing the works not any will of ours not any works of ours but his divine plan and purpose being fulfilled praise the lord hallelujah where he leads me i will follow we're just going to wash it a little to god be the glory amen the word is now as we sing it at christmastime the word and flesh appearing the word is starting to appear in the flesh of his people praise the lord hallelujah hallelujah [Music] but it's partly a prayer [Music] partly a dedication i'll go with him [Music] with him all the way where he me i will follow yes i will where he lives follow [Music] where he leads me i will follow [Music] do you

heart that's made of [Music] [Music] we're gonna dance [Music] we'll have one grand home coming week lead first ten [Music] i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them

cross and follow jesus god bless you [Applause] thank you
