[7:06] than teaching so uh so they're doing
[7:10] great and we thank God for that Li

[8:13] for them and pray that the Lord will
[8:15] Comfort them and strengthen them in this
[8:17] hour we know they're
[8:19] Believers but it's the physical parting
[8:23] from your loved ones until you meet
[8:25] again is still
[8:28] difficult amen
[8:30] right both for the children and also for
[8:33] the dad but there's no way that you're
[8:37] going to have somebody in your life for
[8:39] 20 30 40 50 years and then all of a
[8:43] sudden you disappear and you don't feel
[8:46] it right uh anybody will feel it and God
[8:50] says we need to grieve but don't grieve
[8:53] with excessive grief left you lest you
[8:57] make the Sinners say uh why are they
[8:59] grieving so much it looks like they
[9:01] don't believe they'll meet their loved
[9:02] ones again right so we have to grieve
[9:05] but with a balance in that grief so we
[9:08] thank the Lord for that and thank you
[9:10] for allowing me to take the time to
[9:11] express this because even though they
[9:14] are not here if they were to listen to
[9:17] this cing today they'll hear the
[9:20] Expressions uh that we made and trusting
[9:24] that it will strengthen and comfort them
[9:26] and more so we will take our presence
[9:28] and go there
[9:29] God bless you now let's turn our
[9:32] attention to the word of God
[9:37] Amen Hebrews 10
[9:43] 11-2 and the topic today is why do we
[9:47] take the Lord
[9:54] [Music]
[10:03] before we read the scripture let us pray
[10:05] and ask God's blessing you find it
[10:08] Hebrews 10 11
[10:11] to2 let us pray our dear God our
[10:15] gracious Heavenly Father we are so
[10:18] blessed thank you for the offices in the
[10:21] church every member we thank you for the
[10:24] service the soft worship service and the
[10:27] blessing we receive from it as we sung
[10:30] hymns of Praise praising our great
[10:32] Redeemer for Redemption by Blood thank
[10:36] you Father we give you praise bless the
[10:38] word now and bless for gathering
[10:41] together for this time of a love Feast
[10:45] this time of a memorial that we are to
[10:49] take and we pray that you bless our
[10:52] coming together in the name of Jesus
[10:55] Christ amen and amen God bless you all
[11:00] and every priest stand up daily
[11:05] ministering and
[11:07] offering often times the same
[11:12] sacrifices which can never take away
[11:15] sins but this man after he had offered
[11:20] one sacrifice for sins
[11:24] forever sat down on the right hand of of
[11:30] God hallelujah God bless you please be
[11:39] seated on the Old Testament dispensation
[11:43] or in the Old Testament you will find
[11:46] that no sacrifice that was ever offered
[11:49] by any
[11:51] priest was of
[11:54] sufficient
[11:56] value to pay the sin
[12:00] the depth of sin that the human race
[12:04] ow it could not suffice and it could not
[12:09] take also it was not
[12:13] logical that the blood of one animal or
[12:18] 10 million
[12:20] animals could accr to the value of one
[12:27] Soul much less the that
[12:30] for the sins of the world it was not
[12:34] possible and so the priest found himself
[12:38] with a
[12:39] dilemma where they had to come offering
[12:43] sacrifices and
[12:45] offerings that would call their sins but
[12:49] not wash away their sins it could not
[12:52] take away the stain and the guilt of sin
[12:58] so over and
[13:00] over the priest had to come offering the
[13:04] same
[13:05] sacrifice over and over again and at the
[13:09] same time while it covered their sins it
[13:12] shows that it was not efficacious it was
[13:15] not effective enough and that's the
[13:18] reason why he had to come again and
[13:20] again and again bringing the same
[13:24] sacrifices because as we would say today
[13:26] it wasn't working yes amen it just
[13:30] wasn't
[13:31] working but it worked just enough where
[13:35] God accepted it as a
[13:38] substitute God accepted it as a covering
[13:42] until the real lamb the real do came on
[13:47] the seed and we know that to be the Lord
[13:50] and Savior Jesus Christ for in him dwelt
[13:54] the fullness of the godhead bily amen so
[13:59] the priests were Faithful Men we're not
[14:01] putting them down they were faithful
[14:03] amen but what they did never put away
[14:08] sin it never did it but their position
[14:13] was a symbol of the great high priest
[14:16] who would come and offer the Eternal
[14:20] sacrifice that would take away sin so
[14:24] they had to play their part in the drama
[14:27] of redemption
[14:29] as types as shadows as symbols of what
[14:34] was to come amen you see the Old
[14:38] Testament uh is casting Shadow it's like
[14:43] a shadow being cast so that you know
[14:46] what's
[14:47] coming right that's what it is what was
[14:50] in the Old Testament
[14:53] concealed in tes and
[14:55] general is now in the New Testament
[14:59] revealed am you see it was concealed but
[15:03] now it's revealed amen it was hidden
[15:06] then but now it's made know that said it
[15:10] was a mystery now it's a
[15:12] revelation and we are the recipients in
[15:15] the beneficiaries of the rising of the
[15:18] Sun the light of the word that has been
[15:20] brought to us amen praise the Lord
[15:25] so they came to God in faith and because
[15:28] they came in faith God honored that
[15:30] faith God honored it and waited for the
[15:35] real sacrifice to come so when they
[15:38] confess their sins it does not cancel
[15:41] their sins it only cover their sin it
[15:46] didn't cleanse the sin it just uh
[15:49] scooted over and covered the sin that
[15:53] they had praise the Lord let me put it
[15:56] this way it's just as much like if
[15:59] someone owed a a note you owed a debt
[16:05] just a minute give me a chance to move
[16:08] this I can hear
[16:10] it uh giving
[16:12] some funny
[16:15] sounds and I'd like to corage
[16:20] that okay I think it will work better
[16:23] there all right
[16:25] so this man PA a certain sum of money
[16:30] just as much as we owe the debt we
[16:32] couldn't pay he ow the sum of
[16:37] money and what happen is when you b a
[16:40] son ofone a sum of money right away you
[16:43] bought it from someone right you go and
[16:46] borrow the devil's stuff you going to
[16:47] have to pay and the thing about it is
[16:51] that they're going to make you sign a
[16:53] note you have to sign some note sign
[16:57] your name to it that you commit yourself
[17:00] to pay that
[17:02] debt and then you pay the debt and it
[17:05] might be for 6 months and maybe for a
[17:07] year or whatever uh but when the time
[17:12] comes and you end up not having the
[17:16] money to pay the debt then what do you
[17:19] have to do you have to
[17:22] renegotiate and renew the debt at the
[17:26] higher interest rates rate and and sign
[17:29] the that
[17:30] again so in a nice way I'm trying to
[17:33] tell you that's what the sinner was
[17:35] doing in the Old Testament he was
[17:38] signing a note to pay but yet not
[17:41] knowing how he could pay right keep
[17:44] signing a note and every time he resigns
[17:46] the not the Deb is getting higher praise
[17:49] the Lord of course not some of you have
[17:51] never been in debt so you don't really
[17:52] know about
[17:54] it but those who have been in death uh
[17:58] uh are fully aware of
[18:00] it and you have to pay it so sometimes
[18:05] when a man has the death and it's
[18:07] mounting up it's getting to a
[18:09] uncontrollable level and the bleeding is
[18:11] not
[18:12] stopping and all you trying to bail out
[18:15] the water getting in your boat of Life
[18:18] the water is coming in faster than you
[18:19] can bail it out are you listening to me
[18:22] now it's it's coming in faster than you
[18:25] can bail it out and so you're hoping
[18:28] that you somehow something will happen a
[18:32] miracle will take place I wouldn't say
[18:34] that you're going to win the Bingo or
[18:36] the lottery or something like that but
[18:38] you're hoping something will happen and
[18:41] the bills are ping up and you left Hess
[18:45] you left miserable
[18:48] helpless you can't sleep in the night I
[18:51] know what I'm talking about I've been
[18:53] there praise the Lord don't look at me
[18:56] like you haven't been there you've been
[18:58] there the sweaty Pals and waking up at
[19:00] the night with you know cold sweat on
[19:02] you because they want their money and
[19:04] you got to pay and you don't know where
[19:06] it's coming from everything else but you
[19:09] know if you happen to have a wealthy
[19:14] friend and that friend happened to know
[19:18] that you were in that kind of a
[19:20] position and that friend of his own
[19:24] choice decided to help you
[19:26] out bail you out
[19:29] take you out of that
[19:31] situation that friend will come with you
[19:34] when you're going back to sign that Lord
[19:38] and that friend will do what come to
[19:41] sign and say look yes he going to have
[19:45] to pay you his de by confessing his sin
[19:48] but I come to sign him to say I am
[19:51] taking full responsibility for this
[19:54] day thank you right amen all he's got to
[19:57] do is confess
[19:59] it but I'm taking the
[20:01] responsibility to P off this entire
[20:05] death amen amen
[20:08] hallelujah and by endorsing that not the
[20:12] friend is actually telling his friend
[20:14] and know Jesus is the Friend of
[20:17] Sinners if you not able to pay it when
[20:21] the Lord comes through I pledge myself
[20:25] myself to pay that debt for you we
[20:32] certainly we take the Lord's
[20:35] Supper because it's telling us by taking
[20:38] the Lord's Supper we giving out the sign
[20:42] that the the work of the Lord that the
[20:44] Lord Jesus Christ did it is finished
[20:48] amen it's finished the Battle Is Over
[20:52] amen the stress is over the misery is
[20:55] over the problems that you have it's
[20:59] than whatever WIS the devil was putting
[21:02] upon you seizing this and taking that
[21:05] and going away with this and carrying
[21:07] you away captive back in the old days
[21:09] they would throw you in jail and stuff
[21:11] like that that's over why because he
[21:15] went to Cal his cross on our behalf and
[21:18] said look don't do worry now it's
[21:21] finished I pay the de
[21:25] to you are the de to could but I P it
[21:29] off it's finished amen time finished
[21:32] it's finished time finished it's
[21:34] finished if my life it's finished my
[21:37] life is
[21:39] finished we the Lord serer also because
[21:43] the S question is
[21:45] settled amen my doubts are settled the S
[21:50] question is settled by the Lord Jesus
[21:53] Christ hallelujah amen oh praise God
[21:57] when the scripture say say here in the
[22:00] word of God Jesus said lo I come in the
[22:05] volume of the book it is written of me
[22:08] to do thy will oh God in Galatians 44
[22:15] to5 but when the fullness of time was
[22:18] come God sent forth his son made of a
[22:22] woman made under the law to redeem them
[22:26] that were under the law that we might
[22:29] receive the adoption of sons Hallelujah
[22:34] in he said I'm going to come and take
[22:37] the that and in the course of time he
[22:41] came born of a woman made under the law
[22:47] and went to Calvary and there gathered
[22:51] up all the notes of all the saints of
[22:55] the past amen and pay those notes and
[23:00] took responsibility for every believer
[23:04] till the very end of D amen hallelujah
[23:08] not just the past notes but the notes
[23:12] till the end of time glory to God
[23:16] hallelujah amen yes sir so by doing that
[23:20] he settled the question of what man is
[23:23] going to do about Sin and he sett it to
[23:27] God satisfice
[23:30] yes amen because God's requirement was
[23:35] judgment all have sin and have come
[23:38] short of the glory of God and all came
[23:40] under the Judgment of God but by him
[23:43] settling the question oh the battle was
[23:47] over and if he sett it to God's
[23:51] satisfaction until God says sit at my
[23:54] right hand that don't mean an old man
[23:57] sitting on the throne in and a young man
[23:59] come and sit beside him but the right
[24:02] hand of God means coming to a place of
[24:04] power place of authority and control
[24:07] that's why said all power is given unto
[24:10] me both in heaven and in Earth amen
[24:13] praise the Lord for he was God himself
[24:16] there praise the Lord John
[24:19] 19:30 when Jesus therefore had received
[24:23] the vinegar he said it is finished and
[24:26] he bowed his head and he gave gave up
[24:29] the ghost Colossians 2:14 says blotting
[24:33] out the
[24:34] handwriting of ordinances that was
[24:37] against us which was contrary to us and
[24:42] took it out of the way nailing it to his
[24:45] cross hallelujah praise God blocking out
[24:49] every
[24:50] note he crossed over every note hey heay
[24:55] heay hey Hallelujah glory to God just
[24:59] took the red streak of his blood and
[25:02] blooded mark it off all the debts are
[25:05] paid your not are settled and are free
[25:08] for whom the son of man set free is free
[25:12] indeed glory to God hallelujah so indeed
[25:16] we are free by the grace of God
[25:19] hallelujah now we know that this
[25:22] sacrifice of the Lord Jesus
[25:25] Christ it always has a backward look and
[25:31] a forward
[25:32] look because the cross is in the
[25:36] center but what happened these Saints
[25:41] before the cross they believe unto M
[25:47] salvation unto Redemption they believe
[25:51] in the types and shadows of lambs and
[25:55] Bulls and substitute offerings and S
[25:58] sacrifices until the true Lamb of God
[26:02] came that's why you look at the cross
[26:05] and it's like this because it's pointing
[26:07] backwards and it's also pointing
[26:08] forwards and he is in the center of it
[26:11] is that right amen they were believing
[26:14] onto but now we are looking back they
[26:18] were looking forward to his coming we
[26:20] are looking back because he's already B
[26:23] the price is already paid he already
[26:26] died for our sins on the cross there I
[26:28] first saw the light and the burden of my
[26:32] heart rose away it was there by faith I
[26:35] receive my sight and now I'm happy all
[26:38] the
[26:39] day praise the Lord do you know that it
[26:43] was the
[26:44] blood we love that little song We tap

[28:41] a tradition in the old days people wor
[28:43] black hats black clothes everything was
[28:45] black black black because we were black
[28:48] and sin and so they were just doing that
[28:52] to commemorate Jesus death and if rain
[28:55] fell on that Easter day it was God the
[28:58] heaven are crying for
[29:00] Jesus all the whole Heaven are crying
[29:04] and the rains in the FL the heaven
[29:06] angels are all crying because Jesus died
[29:09] but let me tell you he died but he rose
[29:12] again
[29:16] and thank you Lord he's risen from the
[29:19] dead amen and he's alive forever more
[29:22] praise God hallelujah amen he he seated
[29:26] that God's right
[29:29] we take the Lord's Supper because it
[29:31] also signifies that he's coming
[29:34] again every time we drink the wine and
[29:37] we eat the bread it symbolizes he's
[29:40] coming again hallelujah amen now uh a
[29:44] certain Minister visited a certain
[29:47] church and when he was there he was
[29:49] invited to speak and when he was there
[29:51] he spoke on the second coming of the
[29:54] Lord hallelujah how many knows brother
[29:56] brand spoke on that second come the Lord
[29:59] he spoke on that under many titles
[30:03] because that was his message Jesus here
[30:07] Jesus come amen praise the Lord he's
[30:10] appearing Among Us right now preparing
[30:14] his coming he's appearing by the opening
[30:16] of the word among us to prepare us for
[30:19] his
[30:20] com amen so here we are brothers and
[30:23] sisters and this Minister after he was
[30:26] finished the pastor took him and said
[30:29] brother I I'm just so sorry that I have
[30:32] to tell you that uh why did you touch on
[30:35] that subject uh about the second coming
[30:38] of the Lord because we here in this
[30:42] church we do not believe in the second
[30:45] coming with the Lord so the preacher was
[30:47] taken back he said oh you don't he says
[30:50] no he said then uh what is that uh table
[30:54] that you have in front of the pit
[30:58] there about what kind of a table is that
[31:01] P of course is the Lord's
[31:03] table so he said and what do you do with
[31:06] it uh what do you do with that table
[31:09] Pastor can't figure out what why the
[31:11] brothers asking that he said well uh we
[31:14] take the Lord's Supper he said well what
[31:18] do you take the Lord's Supper for amen
[31:21] he said because the word of God tells us
[31:24] that we must take the Lord's Supper how
[31:27] many milli are doing that today taking
[31:30] the Lord's Supper taking the soal Holy
[31:34] Eucharist H taking all these various
[31:37] things by tradition and they really have
[31:40] no Revelation no understanding of what
[31:43] it is but we are doing it because the
[31:46] word of God tells us
[31:49] legal you just doing it because you read
[31:51] it in the law you read it in the book so
[31:53] you're just doing it but you have more
[31:55] Revelation so here it is uh and and the
[31:58] brother said well I can't say anything
[32:00] about that the word says it and you're
[32:02] doing it but I want to know how long are
[32:04] you going to keep doing takeing
[32:06] it and the Pastor said well as long as
[32:09] we are here on Earth I
[32:13] suppose so the preacher said what does
[32:15] the Bible say about it preacher said
[32:18] well I don't know what you mean he says
[32:20] let's go get the scripture and read
[32:22] it as often as you eat this
[32:26] bread and drink this cup you do show the
[32:31] Lord's death till he
[32:35] come that is how long we've got to take
[32:38] it because it signifies that he's coming
[32:42] again and if you don't believe that he's
[32:45] coming again you better stop taking it
[32:49] is that right because if we take the
[32:51] Lord supper because we are symbolizing
[32:54] and signifying that we believe he's
[32:56] coming again amen do you believe that
[32:59] yes sir praise God forever more
[33:02] Hallelujah a husband a soldier a s they
[33:06] go out on the sea one goes to Bo
[33:09] wherever they went and before they left
[33:12] they tell their wife uh you know just
[33:15] keep a lamp in a light in the window so
[33:18] that when I'm coming home I can see the
[33:20] light in the window and it will just
[33:22] make me be real anxious and want to
[33:24] hurry to get back home is that right but
[33:26] you put the light in the window what a
[33:28] simple thing put a light in the window
[33:30] or or or the Sailor will say uh you know
[33:33] hang a a ribbon or something you know
[33:37] I'm a rib him by the gate so that I can
[33:39] see it when I'm coming up the road it'll
[33:42] make his footsteps get faster he'll get
[33:44] more anxious about it is that right
[33:46] praise the Lord hallelujah so it's the
[33:49] same way the Lord Jesus is telling us as
[33:52] a husband to a wife do this in
[33:55] remembrance of me so while I'm aware I
[33:59] know I'm on your mind is that right
[34:01] while I'm not in your presence I know
[34:03] you're thinking about me amen is that
[34:06] right and when I start to come back and
[34:09] I look I see that you're doing what I
[34:12] tell you to do by putting a light in the
[34:14] window by putting this certain ribbon
[34:17] right by the front gate and it will make
[34:20] me walk to hurry home and get back to
[34:24] you brothers that's how we bring back
[34:26] the king amen amen amen that's how we
[34:29] bring him back by our faith in the word
[34:33] and by obeying what he says in
[34:35] Simplicity that's why we take the Lord's
[34:37] Supper because we are signifi now we
[34:40] believe him and we believe that he's
[34:42] coming again to take us out of here amen
[34:46] hallelujah oh my so taking the Lord's
[34:49] Supper is a winess yes to all the
[34:53] neighboring

[34:59] husband is coming
[35:02] home my husband is coming back and I'm
[35:07] rejoicing and I'm anxious praise the
[35:10] Lord amen you know reading somebody old
[35:13] history they said Peter and them
[35:16] Apostles they had a habit uh you know of
[35:20] if there's if they're sitting talking to
[35:23] somebody and a stranger starts coming up
[35:25] the road all of a sudden they get
[35:26] distracted and they're taking a key look
[35:29] at that stranger to see who it is you
[35:32] know why because he appeared he walked
[35:35] with them and the root their M and he
[35:37] appeared to them in the room they didn't
[35:38] know who it was until he said Peace be
[35:39] up to
[35:41] you and they don't want that to happen
[35:43] yet so they're watching for his coming
[35:46] and whatever form he come scrutinizing
[35:49] every stranger that's coming up the road
[35:51] and you know it's the same thing that
[35:53] would happen to a wife that truly loves
[35:55] her husband and watching for his
[35:58] my God every time there's a s from the
[36:00] street she
[36:01] pull is that right every time there look
[36:03] somethings like footsteps it might be
[36:05] the post man but she wants to know if
[36:07] it's him is that right that's the state
[36:10] we ought to be here because this is R
[36:13] time this is going home time amen this
[36:17] is the time when the Lord promise he's
[36:19] coming again and he's coming for you
[36:21] amen I said the boss's son said get
[36:25] ready I'm coming for you amen amen glory
[36:28] to God hallelujah amen why you w from
[36:33] our com do this in remembrance of me
[36:38] amen praise the name of the Lord
[36:39] hallelujah this is the little locket it
[36:42] has my picture in it now again open it
[36:46] do this in remembrance of me my picture
[36:49] is right there close to your heart every
[36:51] time you open it you look at it
[36:53] remembrance of me that's why we are here
[36:56] today brother and sister it's not just
[36:58] to eat bread and drink wine but what
[37:00] it's represents by the revelation of the
[37:04] word hallelujah wherefore
[37:08] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[37:12] this cup of the Lord
[37:14] unworthy now you got a better
[37:16] understanding what that means that don't
[37:19] mean that the person oh this believer
[37:21] went out and
[37:22] smoke or that person did that or they
[37:26] commit fornication the LI of
[37:29] the the prophet
[37:31] says casting out sin casting out devil
[37:37] unbelief and when he's talking about
[37:39] unworthy is somebody taking it without
[37:44] Revelation without genuine salvation and
[37:47] without Revelation they're taking it not
[37:49] knowing the full significance of it only
[37:52] with a surface understanding and without
[37:54] a clear revelation of why we have taken
[37:58] the Lord's Supper Hallelujah now you
[38:01] know how Saul brother Paul formerly
[38:04] known as Saul what kind of a person he
[38:07] was he was he he he had a sword out for
[38:11] every Christian and he was chopping
[38:13] heads off amen praise the Lord chopping
[38:16] heads off I was in the little prison
[38:18] where they kept him in r a c damp dark
[38:22] little room that that he was in but
[38:25] anyway he was there
[38:28] and we know that God gave him a special
[38:33] Revelation and even though John and the
[38:36] other disciples never broke down the
[38:40] Lord's Supper Paul was never in the
[38:44] room he was not at the Last
[38:47] Supper but yet if you go read First
[38:51] Corinthians 11 he said as was delivered
[38:54] unto me by the Lord himself amen that
[38:58] means the Lord Jesus came to Paul
[39:01] personally appeared to him and told him
[39:03] what
[39:04] happened that the same night that he was
[39:11] betrayed he took bread and when he had
[39:15] given thanks he break it and said take
[39:18] eat this is my body which is broken for
[39:21] you this do in remembrance of me after
[39:26] the same manner also he took the cup
[39:29] when he had s saying this cup is the New
[39:32] Testament in my blood this do ye as us
[39:35] as you drink it in remembrance of me for
[39:39] as often as you eat this
[39:43] bread and drink this
[39:45] cup you do show the Lord's
[39:48] death until he come again I don't have
[39:54] this in my notes but I'm remembering
[39:58] of a missionary going into
[40:00] India and when he was in India he went
[40:04] to a remote village where um you know he
[40:08] wasn't aware of anybody preaching there
[40:11] when he got there he started preaching
[40:14] about Jesus and an old Hindu gentleman
[40:17] invited him into the
[40:20] home and so he went into the
[40:23] home and the gentleman placed the food
[40:26] on the table and just before he broke
[40:29] the
[40:30] bread he started praying and saying
[40:34] thank you Lord Jesus for this you know
[40:37] uh bread para uh let you provideed and
[40:42] so on like that and then when he got to
[40:45] the drink the tea that they're supposed
[40:48] to drink again he took the tea and he
[40:50] says we thank you for this uh tea that
[40:54] you have provided and made uh uh give
[40:57] strength to our bodies and so like that
[41:00] and every time they would pick up
[41:01] something to eat that's how this
[41:04] gentleman would pray so the missionary
[41:06] said why are you praying like this he
[41:10] said
[41:11] because um many years ago about 20 years
[41:16] somebody uh passed through here and left
[41:20] a book and I got a hold of that book and
[41:23] I've read that book over and over from
[41:25] cover to cover and said what the book he
[41:27] brought the book out and it was just the
[41:30] book of The Gospel of Matthew and it was
[41:34] read so many times until the pages were
[41:36] all torn and some of them even getting
[41:40] unreadable but he had read about how
[41:43] Jesus broke the bread and give
[41:46] thanks and took the cup and give
[41:49] thanks and then says take the and eat
[41:53] the all of it so he the missionary says
[41:56] oh that's wonderful you read that so how
[41:59] long have you been doing this he said
[42:02] for 20 years every meal that he
[42:07] at he was giving thanks for that
[42:12] bread every meal for anything that you
[42:16] drank and he was doing it for 20
[42:19] years Jesus said do this as often as you
[42:25] drink this cup and eat this bread I'm
[42:28] not telling you to take it every time
[42:30] like that but just to show you that
[42:33] there are people so
[42:36] committed that they will do that by the
[42:39] grace of God of course the missionary
[42:41] explained to him that he doesn't have to
[42:44] do it every time but do it as
[42:47] often as the Lord places on your heart
[42:50] so that you will keep him on your mind
[42:53] and in your heart at all
[42:56] times parents the thought for today I
[42:59] trust that it will be a blessing to your
[43:01] soul and the Simplicity of it will Anor
[43:05] you and strengthen you in this hour as
[43:08] we turn our attention now I'm going to
[43:10] ask the musicians to come up towards uh
[43:12] taking of the Lord's supper and we will
[43:15] have the washing of the Saints feet
[43:17] praise the Lord and um we we want to do
[43:21] all of this so that we can be out of
[43:23] here uh and those of you
[43:27] act on the
[43:30] invitation and we have the time to do
[43:32] that meanwhile let's focus on having the
[43:35] Lord's
[43:37] Supper praise the Lord amen
[43:57] s
