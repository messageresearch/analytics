[33:11] can have it that way there's many ways
[33:13] that lead to God that's what they say
[33:17] but then Jesus
[33:19] himself who walked on this Earth Emanuel
[33:22] God himself said I am the way the truth
[33:27] and the life
[33:28] no man comes to the father but by me
[33:31] amen praise God and so we got to declare
[33:34] the truth in this hour because it's only
[33:37] the truth that's going to set the people
[33:40] free amen welcome everybody into the
[33:43] house of the Lord this morning we are
[33:45] excited to be in the house of God we're
[33:48] excited about the word of God we're
[33:50] excited because we know that we're
[33:52] living in the in the end time amen the
[33:54] end of the End Amen and um uh these are
[33:58] these are times that where where the the
[34:00] true church she's just excited not
[34:04] because there's Great Tribulation that's
[34:06] going to come down upon the Earth of
[34:08] course that's not exciting for the Earth
[34:11] but that's Bible prophecy and if the
[34:14] people were willing to listen to Bible
[34:16] prophecy then they would be here with us
[34:19] they'd be getting into the churches
[34:20] where they know the word of God where
[34:23] Jesus Christ is preaching present truth
[34:26] that's where you'd want to be imagine
[34:28] Jesus walked on the earth and yet only a
[34:31] dozen people followed him and yet he was
[34:34] the Messiah he was the word made flesh
[34:37] for that day and all they could say was
[34:40] crucify him he's causing a
[34:43] disturbance oh my what a time we're
[34:46] living in Saints praise God hallelujah

[35:21] Thanksgiving how many knows that it was
[35:23] the American
[35:24] Thanksgiving amen you know it was just
[35:26] over 400 years ago that um many pilgrims
[35:31] came from England they wanted to um come
[35:34] to America where they felt that they
[35:36] could start a fresh new life there were
[35:38] many great um men that were amongst them
[35:41] Christian men that believed that uh you
[35:44] know that that that they could start a
[35:46] new life that they could that they could
[35:48] stand for the word of God in the way
[35:50] that they they believe the word of God
[35:52] and they landed on Plymouth Rock they
[35:54] came in on the Mayfield they came in on
[35:56] another boat and there was this one
[35:57] gentleman by the name of John withrop
[36:00] who was a who was a a a Christian
[36:03] minister and a and a leader amongst them
[36:06] and you know he uh one day was was uh
[36:09] Gathering the people together after he
[36:11] had landed there in Plymouth Rock and
[36:14] and he gathered the people and he said
[36:16] listen I want to I want to talk to you
[36:19] people I want you to know something that
[36:21] God has promised us and he said you know
[36:25] he said to them he he took scripture
[36:27] they said that he was he was like Moses
[36:29] he was like a comparable to Moses he
[36:32] took scripture right from Deuteronomy
[36:34] chapter 28 and he talked about and and
[36:37] you know here here's one scripture that
[36:39] he said and these are promises that the
[36:42] Lord was speaking to them because that's
[36:45] where America was just being established
[36:47] it was around 1630 and we know that they
[36:50] became a nation in 16 or 7 I don't know6
[36:54] 1776 but those pilgrims were the start
[36:57] of the United States of America and they
[37:00] said and it shall come to pass if Thou
[37:03] shalt hearken this is from Deuteronomy
[37:05] uh 28 verse1 if Thou shalt hearken
[37:09] diligently unto the voice of the Lord
[37:11] thy God to observe and to do all his
[37:14] Commandments which I have commanded thee
[37:17] this day that the Lord thy God will set
[37:20] thee on high above all nations of the
[37:23] earth now we know that was Moses talking
[37:26] to Israel
[37:28] but here he took that very scripture and
[37:30] here we are 400 just over 400 years
[37:32] later and this thing you know America if
[37:36] they could only see the condition that
[37:37] they're in
[37:38] today and all these blessings verse two
[37:41] shall come on thee and overtake thee if
[37:45] Thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the
[37:48] Lord thy God blessed shalt thou be in
[37:51] the city and blessed shalt thou be in
[37:53] the field imagine all these blessings
[37:57] and you know what America became the
[37:59] greatest nation on planet
[38:03] Earth they reached Heights above every
[38:06] nation more financially powerful than
[38:08] every nation on Earth at to a point
[38:11] where you know where where God had
[38:12] blessed them but
[38:15] then it was in the
[38:17] 1960s where God had sent a prophet to

[38:35] our Nations we thank God for what he has
[38:38] done but God is

[38:48] unfortunate thing
[38:50] Saints but thank God he has a
[38:54] church a people that have recognized and
[38:58] hearkened unto his voice in this day and

[45:14] amen glory to God let's go to the
[45:23] word Ephesians chapter 1 we've been
[45:27] taking this scripture we want to expand
[45:30] on it we want to let the Holy Spirit
[45:32] speak to our needs through it and
[45:34] through the the the following scriptures
[45:36] that we'll be looking at here but we're
[45:38] talking about the open book the book has
[45:41] been open it's no longer a closed book
[45:45] it's open but that book is open and it's
[45:49] somewhere not somewhere but in someone
[45:53] in a body amen she's recognized that the
[45:57] book is open she realizes that the word
[46:00] has been unveiled amen it's not
[46:03] something that's coming it's something
[46:05] that is in progress right now amen
[46:09] having made known unto us the mystery of
[46:11] his will according to his good pleasure
[46:15] which he hath purposed in himself that
[46:18] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[46:20] times which is now he might gather
[46:24] together in one all things in Christ
[46:28] both which are in heaven and which are
[46:31] on earth even in him so so is there
[46:34] going to be any other Gathering Place
[46:36] that this is going to all
[46:39] culminate it's all in him he's got now
[46:43] he's talking about those that are called
[46:45] according to his purpose amen he might
[46:48] gather together and so in whom also we
[46:52] have obtained an inheritance being
[46:55] predestinated a according to the purpose
[46:59] of him who worketh all things after the
[47:02] counsel of his own will may the Lord add
[47:06] His blessings you may be
[47:07] seated amen glory to God it's like the
[47:11] the the the book is like his last will
[47:14] in Testament amen it's unveiling things
[47:18] that that that you know that that only
[47:21] uh uh you know the prophets of old they
[47:23] they looked into those things they
[47:25] peered into those things but yet they
[47:26] couldn't fully comprehend it because
[47:29] there would be an appointed time and
[47:31] season it would be at a at the
[47:33] dispensation of the fullness of time
[47:36] amen and that's why we we we title this
[47:38] to ready to be revealed in the last time
[47:42] amen it's it's in the last time that
[47:44] he's unveiling this word and making it
[47:47] real to you as
[47:49] individuals this is not about a big you
[47:52] know Gathering of people and you know
[47:54] we're going to we're going to rent a
[47:56] stadium and everybody's going to go
[47:57] there and one morning we're all going to
[47:59] go in the Rapture together no sir it'll
[48:01] be one here one there the Rapture is
[48:04] already in progress you've been raptured
[48:06] already your friends your family are
[48:08] wondering why they can't associate with
[48:11] you in the way that they used to you're
[48:13] different you know all you talk about is
[48:15] the word you love the Lord you you you
[48:18] look at everything and all you can see
[48:20] is prophecy being fulfilled in your life
[48:22] amen and in the world because you've
[48:24] been given the spirit of Prophecy upon
[48:26] on your life amen but God is God is
[48:30] declaring his great mystery let's go to
[48:32] the next slide he says here we read this
[48:34] last week Christ in the is the mystery
[48:35] of God revealed God's great mystery of
[48:38] how it's a
[48:40] secret he kept it a
[48:43] secret but not
[48:46] anymore no sir he's making it known
[48:50] Hallelujah nobody know nothing about it
[48:53] even the angels didn't understand it see
[48:56] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[48:58] under our seventh mystery when the
[49:01] seventh seal was opened there was
[49:04] silence glory to God you know why
[49:07] there's silence because the opening of
[49:09] the seventh seal was the coming of the
[49:11] Lord a lot of people are looking for him
[49:14] to come in the clouds they're wondering
[49:16] oh he's coming he's coming they're all
[49:18] in a they're in a million churches this
[49:20] morning and they're saying he's coming
[49:21] he's coming I'm here to tell you he's
[49:24] already
[49:25] come he's already working on his people
[49:29] he's already snatched them just like he
[49:31] did when he walked into the when he
[49:33] walked over to the Sea there and he said
[49:37] Peter put your nets back out again oh
[49:41] they were fishing they were looking for
[49:43] fish they were wondering my god let's
[49:45] fill the church we can fill the church
[49:48] with people we can we can go out there
[49:50] and catch them but there's a famine in
[49:53] the land for the word of God it seems
[49:55] like nobody really wants to hear the
[49:57] pure word of God Amen he said no Peter
[50:00] let's go out again let's go and drop the
[50:02] net again because because now there was
[50:05] somebody else stepping in the boat amen
[50:08] and when God stepped into your boat it
[50:10] changed your entire life amen glory to
[50:13] God hallelujah and there was something
[50:15] in you that you didn't know but it was
[50:17] sealed up God had sealed something in
[50:21] you from before the foundations of the
[50:23] world and there'd be a time when the
[50:25] word would have to come to life in you
[50:28] amen so that seven seal there was
[50:31] silence Jesus when he was on Earth they
[50:33] wanted to know when he would come he
[50:35] said it's not even the son himself don't
[50:39] know imagine because Jesus was the son
[50:44] of God but yet God was expressing him in
[50:51] the son of
[50:52] man time and season and that's why Jesus
[50:56] Jesus himself did not even know while he
[51:00] was bottled up in this human flesh he
[51:04] knew something he all he knew is I come
[51:06] to do the will of my father I do nothing
[51:09] L he shows it in other words God will
[51:12] showing him things as he was walking
[51:16] with the word amen he was the word made
[51:19] flesh and he was walking with the word
[51:21] but it wasn't until he had resurrected
[51:23] he had given up that body and moved into
[51:26] that into that that word body that
[51:28] theophany body where everything was made
[51:31] plain again amen praise God and he came
[51:33] to realize what this was all about he
[51:36] had to learn obedience the scripture
[51:38] said so don't think that he was all
[51:40] knowing when he was in there it was only
[51:43] what God would show him right that's why
[51:46] when he went to the Garden of Gethsemane
[51:48] he had to pray and he said oh God that
[51:52] human side of him he had to God had to
[51:55] separate from that Humanity
[51:57] to allow it to go to Calvary and fulfill
[51:59] the word of God Amen praise God he says
[52:03] he didn't even know he didn't know what
[52:05] when it was going to happen see God has
[52:07] this all to himself it's a secret and
[52:11] that's the reason there was silence in
[52:13] heaven for the space of half an hour and
[52:15] seven Thunders uttered their voices and
[52:17] John was forbidden to write it oh we're
[52:21] going to be looking at some things here
[52:23] I don't know if we're going to be able
[52:24] to get to it today but there's there's a
[52:26] lot right there oh boy glory to God Amen
[52:31] where's those seven Thunders why did he
[52:33] not get allowed to write it why oh
[52:35] Saints we've got some things here that
[52:37] the Lord is going to bless us with amen
[52:40] John was forbidden to write it see
[52:42] coming of the Lord that's one thing he
[52:45] hasn't revealed yet of how he will come
[52:48] and when he will come it's a good thing
[52:51] he
[52:52] doesn't he doesn't know he has has
[52:56] showed or revealed it in every type
[52:59] that's in the Bible and that's why we've
[53:03] been looking at all the different types
[53:05] and that's why if you look from Genesis
[53:07] to Revelation and you look at every
[53:09] character that that fulfilled a portion
[53:12] of the word of God you should be able to
[53:14] see Jesus Christ in there it should be
[53:18] as clear as a bell that's the one thing
[53:20] a lot of people don't realize as
[53:22] Christians if you've been given the Holy
[53:24] Ghost you've been given the spirit of
[53:26] Revelation that when you read the word
[53:29] it's not going to kill
[53:31] you the Bible says the letter
[53:34] kth but the spirit gives it life so it's
[53:38] going to give life to some it's going to
[53:40] kill others because some look in there
[53:42] and they see Trinity you look in there
[53:45] and you see Jesus Christ the same
[53:47] yesterday today and forever do you see
[53:50] the difference and so this is what we
[53:52] need to realize amen praise God and so
[53:56] uh you know um as we look at
[53:59] this uh we realize that that God was was
[54:03] unveiling a supernatural plan that
[54:07] started from before the foundations of
[54:09] the world and today we want to look at
[54:12] more you know as every time I go to
[54:15] study and every time I go to continue
[54:17] and I and I start to review my notes all
[54:20] of a sudden the Lord starts dropping all
[54:22] kinds of inspiration and I say oh okay
[54:25] oh I see that yes Lord and I start to
[54:28] put it in into the notes and so I don't
[54:30] know how long this is going to go but
[54:32] let's just see what the Lord's going to
[54:34] reveal to us cuz I'm just as much under
[54:36] expectation as you are I hope you've
[54:39] come with expectation cuz if you have
[54:41] God will discern your need God will
[54:43] speak to your very heart amen praise God
[54:46] and so we're looking today at the open
[54:49] book let's go to the next
[54:51] scripture he says here in Ephesians
[54:57] computer wants to act up right now amen
[54:59] unto me Ephesians 3: 8 and9 unto me who
[55:03] am less than the least of all the saints
[55:06] is this Grace
[55:08] given every Minister and every son and
[55:10] daughter of God should have should you
[55:13] should identify with that because we are
[55:16] less than the least of all the saints
[55:20] when you think about all that they went
[55:22] through and all that they had to go
[55:23] through but yet this grace is given that
[55:26] we should be able to preach among the
[55:28] Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of
[55:31] Christ this is unbelievable what God has
[55:35] made known to us in this day and in this
[55:38] hour we take it for granted sometimes we
[55:41] don't realize the the the value of the
[55:44] word that's been placed in our lives and
[55:47] how how we are so privileged by the
[55:50] grace of God that we can believe it
[55:53] because that's the that's the miracle
[55:57] listen listen I I could invite people to
[56:00] come here into the house of the Lord
[56:03] with cancer with a death sentence for
[56:05] six months they come in they get prayed
[56:08] for they get anointed with oil they
[56:10] leave they come back maybe one more time
[56:13] and they never see we never see them
[56:15] again and they're living their lives and
[56:16] everything's just fine oh they'll tell
[56:18] and say oh I went to this church and yes
[56:20] God delivered me you know and God healed
[56:22] me you know uh you know but yet that's
[56:26] not a miracle it's a miracle but the
[56:29] real Miracle is when they can receive
[56:31] the word not only is their body healed
[56:35] now but their soul has been translated
[56:38] by a new birth into the kingdom of God
[56:42] into a reality that God is their savior
[56:44] God is their Lord God is their healer
[56:47] God is their provider now he's not just
[56:49] concerned about your health he's
[56:50] concerned about every aspect of your
[56:53] life that's the relationship that we
[56:56] want that's what we're looking for and
[56:59] that's what a real person out there
[57:02] that's sincere in their hearts they
[57:03] should be looking to to identify with
[57:06] the word the word of God and let their
[57:09] lives be a reflection of the word not a
[57:12] reflection of their Church their
[57:14] teachings their doctrines well my my
[57:16] priest says this my pastor says that
[57:19] what is the word say if it lines up with
[57:22] the word what your pastor is saying amen
[57:25] glory to God amen but if it doesn't line
[57:28] up with the word like Jesus when he
[57:30] stood there in front of those Pharisees
[57:32] and he said you by your doctrines have
[57:36] made the word of God of none effect to
[57:39] the people they'll tell you to go and
[57:41] say 10 Hill mares and 12 our fathers and
[57:44] you're good to go for another
[57:46] week that's not the god that we serve no
[57:50] sir God wants to see a broken and
[57:54] contrite spirit one that's that's really
[57:57] come to God and said oh god I've I've
[58:01] I've made lots of mistakes and my life
[58:03] has been a mess without you and I need
[58:06] you now I need you more than ever
[58:08] hallelujah amen glory to God praise God
[58:12] and so here he says and to make all men
[58:15] see what is the Fellowship of the
[58:17] mystery which from the beginning of the
[58:19] world hath been hidden God who created
[58:22] All Things by Jesus Christ so something
[58:26] was in God before the foundations of the
[58:29] world Amen and God wants to express it
[58:32] and so we want to look now let's go to
[58:34] the next slide we're going to be looking
[58:37] at the book we're going to
[58:38] be you know digging deeper into the book
[58:42] seeing what the Lord unveils for us amen
[58:45] and how we can identify with the word
[58:47] let's go to the next scripture
[58:48] Revelations 5 verses 1 to
[58:52] 4 amen praise God it says and I saw in
[58:56] the right hand of
[58:58] him that sat on the throne a
[59:01] book written within and on the backside
[59:06] sealed with Seven
[59:09] Seals and I saw a strong angel
[59:12] proclaiming with a loud
[59:17] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[59:20] to loose the seals
[59:22] thereof now first of all I want to I
[59:25] want I want you to uh draw your
[59:27] attention to
[59:28] this I saw in the right hand of
[59:35] him how many was on the
[59:37] throne it didn't say them right it said
[59:40] him you see until we get to a place
[59:43] where we can identify who God
[59:45] is you are talking to the unknown
[59:50] God you might as well go to any
[59:53] church because you're going to need to
[59:55] know him
[59:56] in a in a personal understanding and by
[59:59] the Revelation that he's not in three
[1:00:01] different
[1:00:03] places no it's God one Elohim from the
[1:00:08] beginning one that sat on the throne him
[1:00:11] that sat on the throne amen praise God
[1:00:14] and here now he's saying and no man in
[1:00:19] Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the
[1:00:23] Earth was able to open the book neither
[1:00:26] to look there on he said no
[1:00:30] man man no man so God is looking for a
[1:00:36] man really you mean that it's going to
[1:00:39] be some man that's going to actually
[1:00:42] take that book and open that book and
[1:00:46] unveil what's in the
[1:00:48] book God is saying here there was no man
[1:00:52] in heaven or on Earth praise God but
[1:00:56] listen here and look at he wept John he
[1:00:59] wept much because no man was found
[1:01:01] worthy to open and to read the book
[1:01:04] neither to look thereon why would he be
[1:01:07] weeping about a
[1:01:10] book why would he be so upset that no
[1:01:13] one could actually take the book and
[1:01:15] open the book like what's going on here
[1:01:20] you know that if you go back into the
[1:01:21] Old Testament there's very little said
[1:01:24] about any books
[1:01:26] but all of a sudden in the Book of
[1:01:27] Revelation here we have some event
[1:01:31] that's taking place because John was in
[1:01:34] the spirit first of all the Book of
[1:01:38] Revelation there's a lot of people say
[1:01:41] John must have been having some coochie
[1:01:44] when he
[1:01:45] was you
[1:01:47] know bringing all these Visions because
[1:01:50] there's all kinds of symbols and all
[1:01:52] kinds of riters and and dragons and and
[1:01:55] and uh you know a wh that s you know all
[1:01:59] these things like what is this all about
[1:02:02] well John you got to understand John was
[1:02:04] in the spirit and unless you are in the
[1:02:07] spirit unless you got the Holy Ghost on
[1:02:10] your life The Book of Revelation because
[1:02:13] Revelation means apocalypse not
[1:02:16] apocalypse apocalypse
[1:02:19] unveiling it's a book of revealing it's
[1:02:21] a book of Revelation God didn't hide
[1:02:24] everything into the book
[1:02:26] no no he placed everything into the book
[1:02:29] so that he could unveil it to whom he
[1:02:31] chose to unveil it and that's where
[1:02:34] that's where the people have to come to
[1:02:35] realize that they got to come God's
[1:02:37] provided way they want they want to they
[1:02:39] want to read the book they want to put
[1:02:41] their own interpretation on the book
[1:02:43] without the Holy
[1:02:45] Ghost because if you don't come God's
[1:02:47] provided way God's not obligated to show
[1:02:49] you
[1:02:51] anything God has a an order to his word
[1:02:55] amen and so the Book of
[1:02:58] Revelation it's it's it's symbols it's
[1:03:02] all kinds of things that are that are
[1:03:04] HID within that book and it's not in a
[1:03:07] in a chronological order either because
[1:03:09] people think oh well if I go to
[1:03:11] Revelations 1 and two you stop at number
[1:03:14] two you've already done 2,000 years of
[1:03:16] the church
[1:03:17] ages that's where the the the the seven
[1:03:20] Church a brother Brandon preached from
[1:03:22] those first two chapters in The Book of
[1:03:24] Revelation so we know it's not Christ
[1:03:26] ological but we also know that God was
[1:03:29] going to unveil the book in a certain
[1:03:33] time and season because we can go on and
[1:03:36] we can see now listen here go to the
[1:03:38] next slide in the fourth seal he says
[1:03:41] now then no one in heaven or in Earth or
[1:03:45] beneath the Earth was worthy to open it
[1:03:48] or even look upon
[1:03:51] it this is a great event that's
[1:03:55] happening right now and we need to
[1:03:58] understand why there was such a a a you
[1:04:00] know a a a time of desperation that John
[1:04:03] wept much he says oh my God he's saying
[1:04:07] you know was worthy to open it to look
[1:04:09] upon it and John wept because he could
[1:04:11] find no man because if that book was not
[1:04:13] taken out of the hand of the original
[1:04:15] owner where it had been
[1:04:18] lost you mean the book was in Adam's
[1:04:21] hand from before before all the fall and
[1:04:25] everything took place place yes yes sir
[1:04:27] that book was in Adam's hand and Eve's
[1:04:30] hand and went back after they forfeited
[1:04:33] their rights of the word the promises
[1:04:36] their
[1:04:37] inheritance they remember they
[1:04:40] controlled the Earth he he was an
[1:04:42] amateur God Adam was in the image of God
[1:04:48] hallelujah Adam was an expression of God
[1:04:51] you know let's read on he he's a he's an
[1:04:55] amateure God he was a Son of God and a
[1:04:59] son of God is an amateur God Amen and
[1:05:04] what are we Sons and Daughters of God
[1:05:07] and when we come into our inheritance
[1:05:09] and our adoption what do we
[1:05:12] become Sons and Daughters of God a
[1:05:15] portion of God and so we need to realize
[1:05:19] what this whole reason why John was was
[1:05:23] was under this desperation that that man
[1:05:26] needed to be found that somebody had to
[1:05:28] open this book amen and a son of God is
[1:05:32] an amateur God now that ain't contrary
[1:05:34] to the scriptures I know that sounds
[1:05:37] strange amen glory to God and so we need
[1:05:42] to understand something here we need to
[1:05:44] go back to the beginning in order to
[1:05:48] identify
[1:05:49] why
[1:05:52] Jesus was the actual sacrificial
[1:05:57] lamb that would in type
[1:06:01] Express
[1:06:03] Adam going to sleep so that God could
[1:06:07] produce a
[1:06:09] bride amen a wife Hallelujah and so
[1:06:13] let's go to the next slide we're going
[1:06:14] to read from Genesis 1 126 now we're
[1:06:18] going to read this because you know
[1:06:20] while I was you know studying and you
[1:06:23] know just feeding on the word and
[1:06:24] feeding on on on messages because I go
[1:06:27] and I feed I got to feed just like you
[1:06:30] feed if I don't feed I'm going to come
[1:06:32] here like a skinny man with soup and you
[1:06:36] guys are going to be leaving here with
[1:06:38] nothing you go come on man we're still
[1:06:40] hungry so so you know I'm looking for
[1:06:44] things that God is going to feed our
[1:06:46] souls amen praise God and so here I you
[1:06:49] know I I went back and and I looked and
[1:06:53] you look at conduct in order
[1:06:57] okay and you go back and you see that
[1:07:03] here brother brandham now
[1:07:06] okay after so I'm going to read I'm
[1:07:09] going to read something now after this
[1:07:11] quote here but Jesus said if you call
[1:07:14] them who the word of God came to and
[1:07:17] what does the word of God come to
[1:07:20] congregation says prophets amen the word
[1:07:24] of God comes to a prophet and we know
[1:07:27] that God is not going to break the cycle
[1:07:30] God is not going to break the way he
[1:07:32] does things and so all of a sudden now
[1:07:35] we've got to recognize that when Jesus
[1:07:37] said Elias has come but Elias shall
[1:07:42] surely come and one had already come so
[1:07:45] there was another coming of Elias there
[1:07:47] was another Prophet that was going to
[1:07:49] come that was going to introduce Jesus
[1:07:52] Christ for the second coming
[1:07:55] the first one was John the Baptist
[1:07:58] prepare ye way for the Lord but the
[1:08:00] second one is Malachi 4 Elijah who shall
[1:08:04] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:08:06] the word we're now we're searching the
[1:08:09] word we're searching the
[1:08:10] scriptures and so if you call them who
[1:08:14] the word of God come to Gods how can you
[1:08:17] condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God
[1:08:22] and now they were gods and man if you
[1:08:26] become born in the family of your family
[1:08:29] name you are a son a part of your father
[1:08:33] and then When sin come When sin came in
[1:08:37] we found out that man crossed the chasm
[1:08:42] and the blood of bulls and goats covered
[1:08:45] but did not remit
[1:08:47] until the real bleach came that bleach
[1:08:52] amen that could take the stain and sin
[1:08:55] and break it completely to pieces and
[1:08:58] send it back upon the original perverter
[1:09:01] that was Satan amen and so we need to
[1:09:05] understand this Plan of Redemption and
[1:09:08] how Jesus Christ and why you know the
[1:09:11] they're they're they're they're they're
[1:09:13] they're they're talking about the Lord
[1:09:14] Jesus but they need to see the true
[1:09:16] context of why Jesus went to the cross a
[1:09:19] lot of people just look at it and oh he
[1:09:21] went to the cross and he died for my
[1:09:23] sins but they have no
[1:09:26] Revelation that God had a plan in his
[1:09:28] mind that when he took Adam and he
[1:09:31] expressed Adam in his own image Adam was
[1:09:35] in the image of God in spirit
[1:09:38] form okay let's move on here so the
[1:09:41] quote here uh so it was a closed
[1:09:46] book the Bible is the Book of Life okay
[1:09:51] and there are thousands of Christian
[1:09:52] ministers and millions of people that
[1:09:54] are reading that Bible yet it's closed
[1:09:57] to
[1:09:58] them okay they're they're they're seeing
[1:10:01] Jesus Christ they're seeing that he came
[1:10:02] they're seeing that he went to the Cross
[1:10:04] but yet they're not reading the element
[1:10:07] of how they fit in to that sacrificial
[1:10:10] lamb and that how he went to the cross
[1:10:12] and they were in him when he went there
[1:10:16] when he rose you Rose and you're just
[1:10:20] identifying with the word for your day
[1:10:22] right now and it's showing that the
[1:10:24] resurrection's is actually in you that
[1:10:27] there's a part of God in you amen amen
[1:10:31] hallelujah
[1:10:33] so I got to move on here to to these
[1:10:35] notes okay so we're going to read
[1:10:38] Genesis 1:26 to 28 because we want to go
[1:10:41] back to the beginning and we want to see
[1:10:44] what God was doing go to the next slide
[1:10:46] and God yeah this is the one and God
[1:10:48] said let us make man in our image after
[1:10:52] our likeness and let them have dominion
[1:10:55] over the fish of the sea and over the
[1:10:58] fowl of the air and over the cattle and
[1:11:00] over all the Earth and over every living
[1:11:04] thing that creepeth upon the Earth so
[1:11:06] God created man in his own image that
[1:11:09] was the first creation of God when he
[1:11:13] created not the first creation but the
[1:11:16] actual first expression of
[1:11:18] himself in spirit man amen and so so God
[1:11:23] created man in his own image in the
[1:11:25] image of God created he him male and
[1:11:28] female created he them so Adam was male
[1:11:34] and
[1:11:35] female so that tells us if Adam is in
[1:11:39] the express image of God then God is
[1:11:41] male and female that's right amen and
[1:11:45] God has this plan in the back of his
[1:11:47] mind about a wife and a Redemptive plan
[1:11:52] and the only way that he can do that
[1:11:54] he's got a he's got to let the logos his
[1:11:57] thoughts Express and become
[1:12:00] material and so he expressed Adam as a
[1:12:04] male and a female I'm I'm going
[1:12:05] somewhere with this so follow me okay
[1:12:08] and God blessed them and said unto them
[1:12:11] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[1:12:14] the
[1:12:15] Earth you wonder why Adam and Eve did
[1:12:18] math every
[1:12:20] day is because God
[1:12:23] said replenish the the Earth and
[1:12:28] multiply Hallelujah we heard that last
[1:12:31] night it was it was it was nice to hear
[1:12:33] a clean joke and God blessed them and
[1:12:37] God said unto them be fruitful and
[1:12:39] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[1:12:40] subdue it and have dominion over the
[1:12:43] fish of the sea over the fowl of the air
[1:12:45] over the every living thing that moveth
[1:12:48] upon the Earth Adam was God in this
[1:12:52] Spirit form he was God in the fullness
[1:12:57] of of an expression
[1:12:59] because we are humans we use words we
[1:13:02] use books even the book that we're
[1:13:05] talking about I don't want you to be
[1:13:07] visualizing this this literal book you
[1:13:09] know when when we're talking about a
[1:13:11] book we're talking the Bible says that
[1:13:13] that that that that God is in the
[1:13:15] fullness of the volume he's in he's in
[1:13:17] the he's in the scripture he's in the
[1:13:19] volumes he's he's all he's he's in all
[1:13:22] and through all amen so when we talk
[1:13:24] about God we need to put him in his
[1:13:26] rightful place amen he's not somebody
[1:13:29] that's just written on letters he's not
[1:13:32] somebody that that that needs to use
[1:13:34] words because actually it's not words
[1:13:37] that you are catching here while I'm
[1:13:39] speaking and preaching the word of God
[1:13:41] it's faith that you are catching it's
[1:13:44] the logus the mind of God the spirit of
[1:13:46] God and we need to understand that this
[1:13:49] whole aspect of God and this whole
[1:13:52] mystery that God wants to unveil to us
[1:13:55] in these last days there's there's more
[1:13:57] to it that that's going to give us faith
[1:13:59] for a body change we're not going to get
[1:14:02] Faith for a body change unless God gives
[1:14:04] it to us there's more that God wants to
[1:14:07] unveil to us we're not going to just
[1:14:10] Rejoice oh the seventh seal is open the
[1:14:12] seventh seal is open why is it open what
[1:14:15] is it doing now what is how is it
[1:14:18] affecting me now how do I identify with
[1:14:22] that seal amen praise God hallelujah and
[1:14:24] so we need to see what God was doing
[1:14:27] here now here Adam is in spirit form
[1:14:32] Spirit man he's not separated
[1:14:36] yet let us make man in our image he said
[1:14:41] let
[1:14:43] them
[1:14:44] them God had this plan in his mind he
[1:14:48] didn't say
[1:14:49] Let
[1:14:51] Jesus he said let them because we're a
[1:14:55] part of the
[1:14:57] plan you're going to see how we are so
[1:15:00] important to the word of God how God
[1:15:03] needs us to recognize who we are why why
[1:15:06] you think brother Braham says when this
[1:15:08] Bride Comes to recognize this church
[1:15:10] comes to really recognize she's not just
[1:15:13] a churchgoing people that go to church
[1:15:15] every Sunday she's a people that's been
[1:15:17] anointed by the word of God by the
[1:15:20] spirit of God he walks with you he talks
[1:15:23] with you he lives around you he he
[1:15:26] changes
[1:15:28] circumstances you should have been
[1:15:29] killed in that accident but he said no
[1:15:32] not this time he he he dealt with your
[1:15:34] life in so many different ways because
[1:15:36] he had an appointed time for
[1:15:39] [Music]
[1:15:40] you Hallelujah so now the next scripture
[1:15:43] when we go to here Genesis 2: 4-7 these
[1:15:46] are the generations of the heavens and
[1:15:48] of the earth when they were created in
[1:15:50] the day that the Lord God made the earth
[1:15:53] and the heavens and every plant of the
[1:15:56] field before it was in the earth and
[1:15:58] every herb of the field before it grew
[1:16:01] for the Lord God had not caused it to
[1:16:03] rain upon the Earth he had not allowed
[1:16:08] his Spirit his word to to to yet now
[1:16:12] come and and and start to manifest The
[1:16:14] Plan of Redemption all the seed was
[1:16:17] planted everything was in his mind was
[1:16:20] all planted in order but God has a time
[1:16:23] and a season for his plan because he
[1:16:26] knew before we before Adam fell with Eve
[1:16:32] he knew that there would be
[1:16:34] time he knew there would be season he
[1:16:37] said let the sun and the moon and the
[1:16:40] days and the nights be for times and for
[1:16:42] Seasons God knew that we would be
[1:16:44] entering into this he knew that there
[1:16:46] would be a time for all of this and here
[1:16:49] now he goes for the Lord God had not
[1:16:51] caused that that and and he says uh to
[1:16:54] re upon on the earth and there was not a
[1:16:58] man
[1:17:00] Adam was in the image of
[1:17:04] God but I want you to notice what he
[1:17:06] says here there was not a man to till
[1:17:09] the ground but there went up a mist from
[1:17:11] the earth and watered the whole face of
[1:17:14] the ground and the Lord God formed man
[1:17:17] of the Dust of the earth so now God is
[1:17:20] creating a body for Adam who was in His
[1:17:24] image yeah to be placed into a glorified
[1:17:29] flesh
[1:17:30] body flesh and Bone
[1:17:34] body the life was the spirit of
[1:17:37] God there was it was eternal life that
[1:17:39] was in him at this point and now he fors
[1:17:43] and he breathes into his nostrils the
[1:17:45] Breath of Life all of a sudden now man
[1:17:49] has to breathe takes that first Breath
[1:17:52] of Life smells the air
[1:17:55] recognizes that wow this is a dimension
[1:17:58] this is something that the Lord now has
[1:17:59] created and that's why when we talk
[1:18:02] about the worlds were formed by the word
[1:18:04] of God we don't know how many worlds
[1:18:06] there were but we know that this is the
[1:18:08] world that God is dealing with right now
[1:18:11] and that's what we should be concerned
[1:18:13] about not about all the previous worlds
[1:18:16] amen but here Adam was experiencing a
[1:18:19] new reality God was expressing himself
[1:18:23] in a human form and within in him was
[1:18:26] the woman Eve now let's read on and he
[1:18:29] and he breathed the breath of life and
[1:18:31] Man became a living Soul now look verse
[1:18:34] 15 to 20 next slide and the Lord God
[1:18:36] took the man and put him into the Garden
[1:18:39] of Eden to dress it to keep it and the
[1:18:42] Lord God commanded the man saying of
[1:18:45] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[1:18:48] freely eat but of the tree of the
[1:18:50] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[1:18:53] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[1:18:56] eatest thereof Thou shalt surely enter
[1:19:00] into
[1:19:01] time which is
[1:19:03] death death can only be identified to us
[1:19:07] because of time if there was no such
[1:19:09] thing as time there'd be no death and so
[1:19:13] at that God had already set up the
[1:19:15] garden that tree of Good and Evil that
[1:19:18] was Satan himself that was the
[1:19:20] serpent by their fruits you shall know
[1:19:22] them God God identifies TR trees in the
[1:19:25] Bible he talks about by their fruits you
[1:19:28] shall know
[1:19:29] them you know there's so many scriptures
[1:19:31] that identifies trees as
[1:19:35] people and the serpent was was very
[1:19:38] smart and God placed him there knowing
[1:19:41] exactly what the plan was going this is
[1:19:43] the Paradox you're going to need to
[1:19:45] follow me on this because it does lead
[1:19:48] to a place where we come to realize that
[1:19:51] God has a purpose remember this is all
[1:19:53] according to his purpose purpose and his
[1:19:55] will so don't be thinking that God is
[1:19:58] just playing games here God placed you
[1:20:01] on free moral agency you have the right
[1:20:03] to reject leave the church never come
[1:20:06] back or you have the right to submit
[1:20:09] yourself to the word amen and allow the
[1:20:11] word to transform you little by little
[1:20:14] faith cometh by hearing by the hearing
[1:20:17] of the word of God Amen God uses words
[1:20:20] to allow his Spirit to ride in
[1:20:24] glory to God Amen and so here now he
[1:20:28] says but of the tree of knowledge of
[1:20:30] Good and Evil Thou shalt not y yeld die
[1:20:32] and the Lord God said it is not good
[1:20:35] that man should be
[1:20:38] alone so here now
[1:20:41] Adam created in the image of God Spirit
[1:20:45] man within Adam is Eve male and female
[1:20:50] called their name Adam read the
[1:20:52] scripture yes yes she wasn't even
[1:20:55] expressed yet but God knew who she was
[1:21:00] just like God knows who you are God knew
[1:21:03] you before the foundations of the world
[1:21:05] amen glory to God and so now he says
[1:21:08] it's not good that man should be alone I
[1:21:10] will make him a help meat for him and
[1:21:13] out of the ground the Lord God formed
[1:21:16] every beast of the field and every fowl
[1:21:19] of the air and brought them unto Adam to
[1:21:22] see what he would call them yes so look
[1:21:25] at the order of creation Now look how
[1:21:28] God is God is creating all of these
[1:21:30] things God has a purpose for putting
[1:21:33] every sentence where it is in the word
[1:21:35] amen it is perfect because God is
[1:21:37] perfect amen God is showing that that
[1:21:40] that he created all these beasts and
[1:21:42] Adam had a perfect knowledge of all of
[1:21:45] these animals all of these beasts he
[1:21:46] understood every single one of them he
[1:21:49] understood every foul of the air and he
[1:21:51] brought them onto Adam to see what he
[1:21:53] would call them and whatsoever Adam
[1:21:55] called every living creature that was
[1:21:58] the name thereof he was giving Adam
[1:22:01] showing that Adam had the ability to
[1:22:04] speak the
[1:22:06] word to call whatever whatever he said
[1:22:09] that's what it was going to be Adam was
[1:22:12] was anointed to to know exactly who he
[1:22:15] was what he was doing and then look at
[1:22:18] the next sentence and then look at the
[1:22:20] very next sentence and Adam gave names
[1:22:22] to all the cattle the foul of the the
[1:22:24] air and to every beast of the field but
[1:22:26] for Adam there was not found an help
[1:22:29] meat for
[1:22:30] him he was waiting on God's time Glory
[1:22:36] he knew that there would have to be a
[1:22:37] certain time he was expressing something
[1:22:40] here let's go to the next verse 21 and
[1:22:43] the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall
[1:22:46] upon Adam you know what brother Bram
[1:22:47] said that deep sleep was he died Adam
[1:22:52] died put him into a deep sleep to show
[1:22:56] that there would be a second Adam that
[1:22:58] would have to come and die so that her
[1:23:01] so that his Eve could be expressed in a
[1:23:04] certain time and season God knew
[1:23:06] everything he saw it all in his back in
[1:23:09] the back part of his mind but look at
[1:23:10] watch what Adam does now and then and
[1:23:13] then so he put him into a sleep and he
[1:23:15] took one of his ribs and he closed up
[1:23:17] the flesh
[1:23:19] flesh instead thereof and the rib which
[1:23:23] the Lord God had taken AK from man made
[1:23:26] he a woman and brought her unto man why
[1:23:30] do you think she's called woman because
[1:23:33] she came from the womb of the
[1:23:36] man Jesus Christ's Church comes from his
[1:23:41] side she went to Calvary when he went to
[1:23:45] Calvary he came and died for her why do
[1:23:48] you think Abel why do you think he had a
[1:23:51] a revelation that it had to be a a
[1:23:54] bloody lamb to bring to God as a
[1:23:57] sacrifice he was he was one of the
[1:23:59] children that were born from Adam and
[1:24:01] Eve he had a revelation that it would be
[1:24:03] a lamb that would take away the sins of
[1:24:05] the world not flowers not not the fruits
[1:24:07] of the field but an actual lamb that
[1:24:10] would have to die a horrible
[1:24:14] death God revealing God showing remember
[1:24:17] we said he showing everything in type
[1:24:19] form through the scripture and so here
[1:24:22] now this is now now watch Adam he says
[1:24:26] he uh that that made he a woman and
[1:24:29] brought her unto the man and Adam said
[1:24:31] this is now bone of my bone and Flesh of
[1:24:34] My Flesh she shall be called woman
[1:24:37] because she was taken out of man
[1:24:39] therefore shall a man leave his father
[1:24:42] and mother and shall cleave unto his
[1:24:44] wife and they shall be one
[1:24:47] what in 2 in Genesis 2:26 God was
[1:24:51] showing in Adam that he knew that there
[1:24:54] would be
[1:24:55] families that there was going to be time
[1:24:58] that there was going to be a fall you
[1:25:00] you mean Adam knew exactly what Eve
[1:25:03] represented that she was the part of him
[1:25:06] that was actually going to fall and
[1:25:10] cause what we call today the
[1:25:14] time warp where man has to go into time
[1:25:17] man has to die every sickness every
[1:25:21] death every health issue every broken
[1:25:24] relationship because of what took place
[1:25:27] in that Garden Adam knew his wife he
[1:25:30] named her immediately as she came out
[1:25:32] right when he saw her he knew who she
[1:25:34] was because Christ knows who we are he
[1:25:39] knows the time and the season that we're
[1:25:40] going to come to his word that we're
[1:25:42] going to recognize who he really is are
[1:25:45] you seeing a lot more here you know you
[1:25:47] may have read Genesis many times but we
[1:25:49] need to allow the spirit of God to show
[1:25:51] us what it is and why why this
[1:25:54] relationship is so important for you as
[1:25:56] the church because remember He restored
[1:26:01] Jesus Remember in the Garden of Eden it
[1:26:03] was Adam and Eve and the Beautiful
[1:26:05] Garden everything was was perfect before
[1:26:10] the
[1:26:11] fall because you know it goes on and and
[1:26:14] then and then they were in the garden
[1:26:16] and Adam you know he you know he he was
[1:26:19] saying that she's the most beautiful
[1:26:21] woman that he'd ever seen you know that
[1:26:24] that you know brother brandham described
[1:26:25] it you know described Eve and how
[1:26:28] perfect she was until that serpent went
[1:26:30] up to her because remember God had a
[1:26:34] plan God wanted to redeem God wanted to
[1:26:37] bring forth his children God you were
[1:26:40] when he said let us make men in our who
[1:26:42] do you think the US were it was us we
[1:26:46] were in the mind of God before this
[1:26:48] whole plan and he was he was bringing
[1:26:51] this whole plan together and we're
[1:26:52] sitting back there going wow oh wow and
[1:26:55] he's he's talking and and and and and
[1:26:57] we're seeing all of this unfold because
[1:27:00] God is eternal God is omniscience
[1:27:03] there's not a time when he began there's
[1:27:05] not a time where he ends you need to
[1:27:07] place God in his rightful place so God
[1:27:10] could see everything that was happening
[1:27:12] and if we were there rejoicing with him
[1:27:14] before the foundations of the world
[1:27:16] until he said but hey guys I got to send
[1:27:18] you down to the Earth what do you mean
[1:27:22] you're going to go down there you're
[1:27:23] going to take on the human bodies
[1:27:25] because of the Fall because Eve is going
[1:27:27] to listen to that serpent who wants to
[1:27:30] bring forth of his own kind wants to be
[1:27:34] like God to be able to create Sons and
[1:27:37] Daughters for himself and that's why
[1:27:40] we've got a world that's full of Sons
[1:27:42] and Daughters of God and a lot of devils
[1:27:44] and they'll turn and they'll tell you
[1:27:46] there is no God I curse God I this God
[1:27:49] there ain't no God why do God allow this
[1:27:51] to it's because there's no attribute
[1:27:54] there's no
[1:27:56] representation they weren't in Adam they
[1:27:59] were created they came as a as a as a
[1:28:02] result of God's word which said let
[1:28:04] every seed bring forth of its own kind
[1:28:08] and when the serpent beguiled Eve and
[1:28:10] made love to her she brought forth two
[1:28:13] sons one that came
[1:28:15] from that serpent the wicked one and one
[1:28:19] that came from Adam because Adam knew
[1:28:21] that he'd have to give his life for Eve
[1:28:24] he saw the whole plan amen praise God
[1:28:27] let's move on and so now that we have
[1:28:30] this background that we've laid in here
[1:28:32] so that we can understand who we really
[1:28:35] are why it's so important to recognize
[1:28:38] and understand how we fit in to Christ
[1:28:42] and how it is that this whole plan that
[1:28:44] that that the Lord had from before the
[1:28:46] foundations of the world which is Christ
[1:28:48] The Mystery of God just listen to that
[1:28:52] Christ the Myster of God revealed so
[1:28:57] he's he's unveiling a whole plan and
[1:29:00] we're a part of it but we need to see
[1:29:02] our part because our part is very
[1:29:05] important we're going to come to realize
[1:29:07] how important it is praise God Amen so
[1:29:11] let's go now and and let's uh let's read
[1:29:14] on brother brandham
[1:29:17] here he now he he makes comments on on
[1:29:22] uh C regarding these scriptures now
[1:29:24] listen what he says here he's he's now
[1:29:27] bringing a clear understanding now he he
[1:29:29] gets a question now this is question one
[1:29:32] in COD book volume one you can go back
[1:29:36] and read it it I loved reading it
[1:29:39] especially under the context of what
[1:29:40] we're feeding on
[1:29:42] here and the question God created male
[1:29:44] and female created male uh man male and
[1:29:48] female now that's I think the first
[1:29:50] point brother Braham says now this is
[1:29:52] the question okay now now in Genesis 2:7
[1:29:56] it says he formed underscored but first
[1:29:59] he created he's got then he's got that
[1:30:03] underscored and he formed Man Out of the
[1:30:07] Dust and breathed into his nostrils and
[1:30:09] so forth now what is the difference or
[1:30:12] where is the connection in the above
[1:30:14] scriptures the difference between uh
[1:30:17] Genesis 126 and Genesis 2 remember the
[1:30:20] spirit man
[1:30:22] Adam the glorified body of Flesh Adam
[1:30:26] where Eve comes forth so brother bradam
[1:30:29] speaking here he goes and he says
[1:30:32] now I need to reference now this brother
[1:30:34] brmp says I need to reference St John 4
[1:30:38] verses 23 to 24 now this is the story of
[1:30:42] the woman at the
[1:30:43] well and you're wondering well wait a
[1:30:45] minute here where's where's brother
[1:30:47] Brenham going here all of a sudden he's
[1:30:49] going to to the woman at the well he's
[1:30:51] but listen he says now he says ye
[1:30:54] worship that ye worship and you know not
[1:30:58] what you're
[1:31:00] worshiping and that's the big problem
[1:31:04] and the big question of today the people
[1:31:07] don't know who they really truly worship
[1:31:09] you go to the Catholic Church they'll
[1:31:11] tell you we worship the Virgin Mary oh
[1:31:14] Jesus is important but we go through
[1:31:16] Mary because Mary's the mother and the
[1:31:19] mother of God will stand there for us
[1:31:21] and tell us hey this person gave a lot
[1:31:24] of
[1:31:25] money you got to let him in or this
[1:31:27] person prays a lot you got to let him in
[1:31:30] this person comes to church every day
[1:31:32] 8:00
[1:31:36] 4:00 who are they
[1:31:38] worshiping do you see what I'm saying
[1:31:40] they know not who they worship and here
[1:31:43] now he says we know what we worship for
[1:31:46] salvation is in in is of the Jews and
[1:31:50] that's right see this is what she said
[1:31:52] but the hour cometh but the hour cometh
[1:31:54] and now is that the true worshippers Jew
[1:31:58] or Gentile shall worship the father in
[1:32:02] spirit and in
[1:32:04] truth so here now Jesus is bringing a
[1:32:07] Clarity of why it's so important for for
[1:32:11] anybody that's truly going to worship
[1:32:13] God they got to have a
[1:32:15] revelation of what was in the mind of
[1:32:18] God right back at the very beginning
[1:32:20] when he created Adam in spirit form
[1:32:24] there was a purpose in all of that and
[1:32:27] this is where we're headed and so here I
[1:32:30] want you to keep that in the back part
[1:32:31] of your mind amen so so he's saying here
[1:32:35] for the father seeketh him to worship
[1:32:37] him now the the next verse is where I
[1:32:39] want God is a
[1:32:42] spirit God is a spirit he's making it
[1:32:45] clear and they that worship Him must
[1:32:47] worship Him in spirit and in truth now
[1:32:51] if God created man in his own image
[1:32:54] and in his own likeness what kind of a
[1:32:56] man did he
[1:32:58] create a spirit man now if you'll notice
[1:33:02] after he had made all the creation and
[1:33:04] the created a spirit man uh to the the
[1:33:08] the Clos reading of this now pay
[1:33:09] attention the one that asked the
[1:33:11] question we'll find this that God give
[1:33:14] dominion of the cattle of the fishes and
[1:33:16] everything to the man but in his making
[1:33:20] up there he made man in his own image to
[1:33:23] leave lead the cattle lead the Beast of
[1:33:27] the field just like the Holy Spirit
[1:33:29] leads the True Believer of today and
[1:33:32] that's why it's so important when we say
[1:33:34] repent be baptized in the name of the
[1:33:37] Lord Jesus you shall receive the spirit
[1:33:40] of God and the spirit of God Jesus said
[1:33:43] I will send you the comforter which is
[1:33:46] the Holy Ghost and he will guide you
[1:33:48] into all
[1:33:50] truth amen so we're seeing something
[1:33:53] here he was in other words Adam the
[1:33:55] first man in the lower creations of
[1:33:59] God the first creation was God
[1:34:03] himself Adam when he was when he said
[1:34:06] let us make man in our image and Adam
[1:34:09] was expressed that was
[1:34:13] God pure
[1:34:15] God but he was in spirit form in an
[1:34:18] image he was expressing himself he's
[1:34:22] going back to that
[1:34:24] we're going back to that unless we go
[1:34:27] back to that there is no eternal life
[1:34:29] amen that's what's written in the book
[1:34:32] these are the things that we need to
[1:34:34] look deeply into to see why John wept
[1:34:37] why it was so important but here now
[1:34:40] he's saying that that that Adam the
[1:34:42] first man he says then out of God came
[1:34:45] the logos which was the son of God then
[1:34:49] out of the logos which was the word in
[1:34:52] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:34:54] was with God and the Word was God and
[1:34:57] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:35:00] us out of the logos came forth the man
[1:35:05] Hallelujah so when Elohim expressed the
[1:35:08] logos it was his thought going forth
[1:35:12] before it was even a
[1:35:15] word it was it was being expressed in in
[1:35:18] spirit form and that's why Revelation on
[1:35:22] the word of God is not something that
[1:35:23] you can you can
[1:35:25] learn Revelation is not learned you can
[1:35:29] memorize scriptures you can memorize
[1:35:32] quotes you can you can do all of those
[1:35:33] things but Revelation is given it's
[1:35:37] revealed that's why it's called
[1:35:39] Revelation that's why the Book of
[1:35:41] Revelation in the in the last book of
[1:35:44] the Bible it's it's a book that reveals
[1:35:46] the end time but God has to reveal it to
[1:35:51] you Hallelujah so man can't figure out
[1:35:54] God all man knows about God is that he's
[1:35:57] an object of worship when you talk about
[1:35:59] God they you ask a person what is God
[1:36:02] they'll tell you well it's it's some
[1:36:04] invisible force out there some some call
[1:36:06] it the universe some call it uh you know
[1:36:09] Source of Life some call it you know
[1:36:12] high levels of consciousness you know
[1:36:15] Darwin says it was the big blast you
[1:36:17] know all these interpretations on God
[1:36:19] but God sends us a prophet that goes
[1:36:22] right into the mind of God and is able
[1:36:24] to tell us that he he says I was looking
[1:36:27] out over the banister and the logos
[1:36:29] which was the light which was the word
[1:36:31] of God which was his thoughts went forth
[1:36:34] like a like a light and it was dancing
[1:36:36] in the universe and it was creating all
[1:36:38] the galaxies and it was creating all
[1:36:40] these different worlds and it was
[1:36:42] creating all these different planets and
[1:36:44] and then and then he saw that you know
[1:36:46] it created this Earth and and God had a
[1:36:48] plan for for planet Earth God allowed
[1:36:51] the prophet to see those things because
[1:36:53] he brought him into his mind and God by
[1:36:57] Revelation has given us the ability to
[1:36:59] see those things so that we can
[1:37:01] recognize how we fit
[1:37:03] in where we come into the whole plan
[1:37:07] Hallelujah glory to God listen it's just
[1:37:10] some object of worship to the people
[1:37:12] some people worship things they worship
[1:37:14] animals they worship movie stars they oh
[1:37:19] they they'll worship uh sports
[1:37:22] stars Oh They'll go there and and
[1:37:24] they'll they'll they'll sing with the
[1:37:26] singers and you'll see 10 100,000 people
[1:37:30] I could just imagine when when uh when
[1:37:32] that girl there was in Toronto the noise
[1:37:34] that was coming out of the uh the the
[1:37:36] Air Canada Center there praise God you
[1:37:40] know and the people were just mesmerized
[1:37:42] they're just caught right up into that
[1:37:44] Spirit not realizing there's a spirit
[1:37:47] there that is capturing the minds of our
[1:37:49] young people and sending them right into
[1:37:53] uh love lives of adultery and drug abuse
[1:37:55] and and and I know the words all sound
[1:37:58] really good but she's up there
[1:38:01] naked pretty much naked what kind of an
[1:38:05] example is that going to set for our
[1:38:07] kids if the movie stars can do it and
[1:38:10] they're my she's my favorite singer
[1:38:12] she's my favorite this that and all of a
[1:38:15] sudden they want to dress like them and
[1:38:16] all of a sudden you're 12-year-old
[1:38:18] daughter going to school all dressed in
[1:38:20] such a way that you're just my God what
[1:38:23] is is that that's a spirit that's trying
[1:38:26] to take our children possess their lives
[1:38:29] and destroy them amen but not in this
[1:38:34] body of
[1:38:36] Christ God has other
[1:38:39] plans he said you and your household
[1:38:42] shall be
[1:38:43] saved that's his promise they might not
[1:38:46] look saved right now but God gave them
[1:38:48] to you they're going to have to fight
[1:38:51] hell they're going to have to fight
[1:38:54] everything they're going to have to
[1:38:55] fight their way to hell and God's still
[1:38:57] going to snatch them out because while
[1:38:59] we were yet sinners he loved us oh the
[1:39:03] grace of God Saints let me tell you but
[1:39:06] God's grace amen glory to God so he goes
[1:39:10] on here and he says but of course we get
[1:39:13] off this question but I don't want to
[1:39:15] get too many you know because he says I
[1:39:18] don't want my mind he says I want you to
[1:39:19] see here where he made his first man was
[1:39:23] in his own image and then God before
[1:39:25] there even was a star knew that this
[1:39:28] world would be God knows everything do
[1:39:32] you think that God didn't know
[1:39:35] exactly you'd be sitting here this
[1:39:37] morning the Bible says he knows the
[1:39:40] number of hairs if you got any on your
[1:39:43] head I got a lot of hair you just don't
[1:39:46] see
[1:39:47] it but you will you may not recognize me
[1:39:51] over there but you'll recognize my voice
[1:39:54] hallelujah praise God but you see God
[1:39:56] knows you God knows you from before any
[1:40:00] Star anything was ever made because we
[1:40:03] are in him we are part of him we are in
[1:40:07] the Elohim we are the the the the the
[1:40:10] thoughts and expressions of God that's I
[1:40:13] can only describe these by words but
[1:40:15] they're only words you still have to go
[1:40:17] into the mind of God to really see how
[1:40:20] he loves you and how he adores you and
[1:40:22] how you are so much a part of him that
[1:40:25] he would have to die for you he would
[1:40:27] not allow you to go he says I don't care
[1:40:30] how much sin you got mixed up in I don't
[1:40:33] care how messy your life looks even
[1:40:35] right now I don't care anybody listening
[1:40:37] to my voice you could be an absolute
[1:40:39] total mess he said I will place your
[1:40:43] sins into the sea of my forgetfulness
[1:40:46] never to remember them no
[1:40:49] more that's what he said that's his
[1:40:51] promise we remember them we come under
[1:40:54] condemnation oh I did this oh I did that
[1:40:57] and God's looking at you and saying wait
[1:40:58] a minute here what are you talking about
[1:41:01] God's not an Indian giver God don't
[1:41:03] forgive and then and then and then
[1:41:04] remember it again we do as humans we got
[1:41:08] problems letting go of things that
[1:41:10] happen in the past somebody hurts you
[1:41:13] just one little bit never trust them
[1:41:15] again no sir that's your flesh talking
[1:41:19] if you could see the way God sees you he
[1:41:22] sees you through the the blood you're
[1:41:24] perfect you never done it in the first
[1:41:26] place I don't care what you did if you
[1:41:29] come to Christ and you really surrender
[1:41:32] and repent to this word he'll wash you
[1:41:35] and cleanse you you will you will walk
[1:41:37] free that's why Jesus said he that's
[1:41:39] heavy laden let him come unto me amen Oh
[1:41:42] Glory to God you got to see what
[1:41:44] happened back in the Garden of Eden you
[1:41:46] got to see what he was thinking before
[1:41:47] the foundations of the world otherwise
[1:41:49] you're going to look at man you're going
[1:41:52] to look at you're going to look at oh my
[1:41:53] mistakes you're going to look at the law
[1:41:56] you're going to look at all those things
[1:41:57] and you're not going to live by Grace
[1:42:00] because it's Grace that saves
[1:42:03] you glory to God he says he says and
[1:42:07] then God before there even was a star
[1:42:09] knew that this would this world would be
[1:42:12] he knew that I'd be William brandham
[1:42:14] preaching the gospel Hallelujah Dan
[1:42:17] misilli preaching the gospel he knew
[1:42:20] that from the pulpit and you would be J
[1:42:23] do sitting there listening to it before
[1:42:26] the world ever began Hallelujah now
[1:42:28] that's where people sometimes in the in
[1:42:30] the legalists and the Calvinists they
[1:42:32] get all mixed
[1:42:34] up you see they say why was some orain
[1:42:39] to be
[1:42:41] lost God's not willing that any should
[1:42:44] perish he didn't want no one to perish
[1:42:47] but yet God being God he knows there's
[1:42:50] some that won't accept it that's why you
[1:42:53] go to talk to somebody about the word of
[1:42:55] God you'll tell them about the proper
[1:42:57] baptism you'll tell them about you know
[1:42:59] Salvation in Christ and and how you know
[1:43:01] he he took your place and everything
[1:43:03] else they'll say nah I like Buddha I
[1:43:06] like Muhammad's teaching I like this new
[1:43:09] age stuff I like the fact that I can
[1:43:12] live this life I can party and I'm going
[1:43:15] to come back again and I'll get to do it
[1:43:17] all over
[1:43:18] again that's that's the kind of stuff
[1:43:20] that they're believing they have no
[1:43:22] Revel ation of God in spirit and in
[1:43:29] truth the legalist they say why why is
[1:43:32] so God not willing he don't want no one
[1:43:35] to perish but yet being God he knows
[1:43:37] that there's some that won't accept it
[1:43:39] see he's God he had to know the end from
[1:43:42] the beginning in order to be God he's
[1:43:46] God I'm just using the word God but you
[1:43:48] can't even put a word on him no there's
[1:43:51] no word that can describe him
[1:43:54] everybody in the Old Testament the rose
[1:43:55] of Sharon the the lily of the valley you
[1:43:58] know that David would get so caught up
[1:43:59] dancing in the spirit like there was no
[1:44:03] name that that that you could possibly
[1:44:05] put on him because of his love and his
[1:44:08] grace and his ability to come back and
[1:44:10] say things like he did to David he says
[1:44:13] blessed is the man whom I do not impute
[1:44:16] iniquity David was in a place where his
[1:44:18] life was a mess and God's mercy and
[1:44:21] Grace comes and says I wash your
[1:44:24] iniquities away I don't even remember
[1:44:25] them no more you know what iniquity is
[1:44:27] when you do things you know you're doing
[1:44:29] it it's wrong you continue to do it but
[1:44:31] God turns around because you repent and
[1:44:33] you come to him and you know that you're
[1:44:35] naked before God you've come to realize
[1:44:37] that he is God and then he wipes your
[1:44:40] sin
[1:44:42] away see he had to know the end from the
[1:44:45] beginning in order to be God he did he
[1:44:48] knew he was going to have some women so
[1:44:51] he just made their Spirit right there
[1:44:55] the Bible said he did in Genesis 1: 126
[1:44:58] he created he him man and the prefigured
[1:45:01] male and female amen see in a prefigure
[1:45:06] he made the woman and the man before
[1:45:09] they was ever formed Out of the Dust of
[1:45:11] the earth glory to God why is that so
[1:45:21] important and then God made the man not
[1:45:25] in his own
[1:45:26] image this body is not in the image of
[1:45:29] God this body is in the image of
[1:45:33] beasts listen what he says here now
[1:45:36] notice man God knew in the beginning
[1:45:39] that he was going to have men and women
[1:45:42] and he knew that the Savior would be
[1:45:44] there would be here and he'd have to
[1:45:46] bring Jesus and he'd be the the he'd be
[1:45:50] crucified and Jesus told the disciples
[1:45:52] when was here on Earth that he knew them
[1:45:56] even before the foundations of the
[1:45:58] world he knew exactly what he was doing
[1:46:02] when he came here because God had showed
[1:46:05] him that he came for his
[1:46:08] own he came for his own when he came for
[1:46:11] for for for Israel they rejected him for
[1:46:14] the purpose that he could take a gentile
[1:46:17] bride remember everything's in type form
[1:46:19] so if you go back into Genesis you'll
[1:46:21] read all about Joseph and how Joseph was
[1:46:24] a was a a Jew and yet Joseph you know he
[1:46:27] was sold for you know for silver from
[1:46:29] his brothers for 25 30 piece of silver
[1:46:32] Jesus was sold for silver you know by
[1:46:35] his own amen by by uh you know and
[1:46:38] showing that that that Joseph had to go
[1:46:40] to prison just like Jesus had to go to
[1:46:43] the Cross but then Joseph was was risen
[1:46:46] out of the prison just like Jesus came
[1:46:48] out of hell after he rose from the dead
[1:46:51] and he was seated at the right hand of
[1:46:52] the father and Joseph was seated at the
[1:46:54] right hand of the Pharaoh which was God
[1:46:57] on Earth at the time you see all the
[1:46:58] types and did you know that Joseph had a
[1:47:01] wife and his wife was
[1:47:04] Gentile and when he revealed himself to
[1:47:07] his brothers just where we are at right
[1:47:10] now where God is going to reveal himself
[1:47:12] to Israel like Joseph revealing himself
[1:47:15] to the 12 tribes of Israel the
[1:47:19] 144,000 where was his wife she was in
[1:47:22] the palace
[1:47:23] Hallelujah she was a gentile bride and
[1:47:26] she was gone in the Rapture glory to God
[1:47:29] just before this whole earth goes into a
[1:47:31] a a big mess and God has to go reveal
[1:47:35] himself to Israel God takes his Gentile
[1:47:37] bride and puts her into a three and a
[1:47:39] half year
[1:47:40] honeymoon glory to God Amen Hallelujah
[1:47:45] and God also said Paul speaking in
[1:47:48] Galatians said he ordained us and called
[1:47:50] us in him before the world was was ever
[1:47:53] formed think of that that God anybody
[1:47:56] would like to hear what the scripture
[1:47:58] says about that raise your hand it goes
[1:48:00] right along with the question get with
[1:48:03] me in Galatians no he says it's no he
[1:48:05] says I don't mean Galatians I mean
[1:48:07] Ephesians listen here closely now what
[1:48:10] God Said in Ephesians 1 Paul an apostle
[1:48:13] of Jesus Christ by the will of God to
[1:48:16] the Saints which are at Ephesus to the
[1:48:19] faithful in Jesus Christ be grace be
[1:48:23] unto you and peace from God the father
[1:48:25] and from the Lord Jesus Christ now when
[1:48:29] you hear that peace be unto you from God
[1:48:32] the father and the Lord Jesus Christ not
[1:48:34] talking about two people no he is God
[1:48:37] the father and he is the Lord Jesus
[1:48:39] Christ that's why Lord is the lord of
[1:48:43] the Old Testament Jesus God the word
[1:48:45] made flesh God With Us God above us in
[1:48:49] the Old Testament God With Us in the New
[1:48:52] Testament God God now in US amen for
[1:48:55] this New Covenant of calling the bride

[1:49:12] blessings in Heavenly places now here

[1:49:32] that he's a member a a a member of the
[1:49:35] church and God knew he was going to have
[1:49:37] that church and he said Paul speaking in
[1:49:39] the Church of Ephesus said he has chosen
[1:49:42] Us in him he's chosen Us in him where
[1:49:47] was Eve in Adam what was Eve she was
[1:49:52] every

[1:50:05] that says that the church the bride of
[1:50:08] Christ is bone of his bone and flesh of
[1:50:10] his flesh because we are being restored

[1:50:17] and Daughters of God Amen that's not he
[1:50:20] says he says he chose why he a member of

[1:54:10] and you know that this is real this is
[1:54:12] not some Fable this is not uh Mr uh

[1:54:41] to to to loose the seven and behold and
[1:54:43] lo in the midst of the Throne of the
[1:54:46] four beasts and in the midst of the
[1:54:49] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[1:54:53] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:54:56] are which are the seven spirits of God
[1:54:59] sent forth into all the
[1:55:03] Earth and he came and took the book out
[1:55:07] of the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:55:10] throne and you would look at that and

[1:55:34] lamb and walks up and just takes the
[1:55:36] book out of the hand of him that sat on
[1:55:39] the
[1:55:40] throne no that was God expressing just
[1:55:46] like he did when he started in in in the
[1:55:49] before the foundations of the world and
[1:55:51] he expressed himself self and he he he
[1:55:54] made himself an image of himself and he

[1:56:07] who was that who can possibly be a
[1:56:10] person that has no beginning and no end
[1:56:12] and yet he shows himself to Abraham that
[1:56:15] was God he was manifesting himself in
[1:56:18] that office so all God was showing here
[1:56:21] when the lamb was what that had been
[1:56:24] slain had paid the sacrificial price he
[1:56:27] was now going from
[1:56:29] lamb to King to where he would take the
[1:56:33] book and now take that book because he's
[1:56:36] got a job to do he's got the other part
[1:56:39] of him that he needs to go and find that
[1:56:42] he needs to go and redeem that he needs
[1:56:44] to positionally place back into her
[1:56:46] rightful position so that they can rule
