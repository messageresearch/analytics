[19:15] Ephesians Ephesians 4
[19:33] Ephesians 4:7
[19:38] to1 but unto every one of us is given
[19:42] Grace according to the measure of the
[19:45] gift of Christ
[19:47] wherefore he
[19:49] said when he ascended up on high he led
[19:54] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[19:57] men
[19:59] now at now that he ascended what is
[20:03] eight but that he also descended first
[20:08] unto the lower part of the earth he that
[20:12] descended is the
[20:14] same
[20:17] also that ascended up for above far
[20:20] above of
[20:22] Heavens that he might fill all things
[20:26] and he has he shall and he gave some
[20:30] Apostles and some prophets and some
[20:35] evangelist and some pastors and teachers
[20:39] may the Lord add his Blessing unto his
[20:42] word
[20:44] amen glory to God I think last
[20:49] time I I I wanted to finish this message
[20:52] today if the Lord
[20:54] willing let's see what the Lord have in
[20:56] store for us last time we talk about
[20:58] about the false prophet we talk about
[21:02] uh
[21:07] uh we talk about
[21:13] the
[21:15] Ahab and His
[21:18] prophets that were lying prophesied you
[21:23] know that the we talk about Ahab how he
[21:26] trained his own prophets to prophesy for
[21:30] him so when the time come when they
[21:34] wanted to get the the their land that
[21:37] God gave to them he tried to pursue uh
[21:41] jaset and Je is there any because there
[21:46] was
[21:47] something
[21:49] that Jeet found
[21:53] out was funny so all 400 prophets all
[21:58] all of them were one because why he has
[22:03] trained them for
[22:05] himself it's not this is the man that's
[22:09] why God doesn't want this denomination
[22:13] with with their mind set when they go to
[22:16] school you you can go to school to
[22:19] study and do everything but you cannot
[22:22] study God in the school the man who is
[22:26] teaching you in the school there he
[22:28] doesn't know God he know by the letter
[22:31] and the letter you cannot understand God
[22:33] by the
[22:35] letter you have to understand God by
[22:39] Revelation Hallelujah God has to reveal
[22:42] himself to you before you can as you as
[22:46] we are all sitting here we know each
[22:50] other but the deep inside of us nobody
[22:53] don't know unless you have I have or you
[22:57] have fellowship with me and I introduce
[23:00] I reveal myself to you before you can
[23:04] really understand me see that's why God
[23:07] said this denomination is not of God cuz
[23:11] all their man is
[23:13] one you remember when they met B
[23:17] Abraham in
[23:20] Chicago they all W and they send
[23:24] somebody to me brother Braham brother
[23:27] Braham never went to school
[23:30] but he has God God was with him and when
[23:34] they send somebody to him what happened
[23:38] by the time the man get there God has
[23:40] revealed all their desires all their
[23:44] crooked ways how they going to encounter
[23:47] him oh glory to God we have
[23:51] God I said we have God who knows all
[23:56] things everything that you speaking your
[23:59] secret chamber God knows everything
[24:03] Hallelujah this is the god that we serve
[24:06] he never
[24:08] change that's why you have to worship
[24:12] God in truth and in spirit we cannot
[24:18] deceive God no man can deceive God the
[24:23] people in this world the preachers and
[24:26] all those to who are fult are deceiving
[24:32] themselves they cannot deceive you
[24:34] because God said he has you on the palm
[24:38] of of his hand so nobody can take you
[24:41] away from his hand Hallelujah this is
[24:45] the god that we
[24:46] serve so when the the the Elijah call
[24:50] there's one Prophet here he said
[24:53] any any Prophet here that we can uh
[25:01] inquiring he
[25:04] said there is a why here but that one
[25:09] day he doesn't favor
[25:12] me he he every time he come he against
[25:16] me I hate him say said let the king say
[25:20] so you hate you know hat come from what
[25:25] the
[25:26] devil so right there he show his
[25:30] character so when they went there to get
[25:34] Mah you know what he said where as the
[25:36] Lord leaded whenever whenever God tells
[25:40] me is what I'm going to
[25:43] speak so when he came you told they
[25:46] asked him all this one of they sent one
[25:51] of the Prophet go went there and
[25:54] then he said we are all one man
[25:59] let not your mouth say another thing all
[26:03] of us are
[26:04] one that's why the churches he said we
[26:07] are all
[26:08] one they are all one denomination they
[26:11] say all in one Father the Son the Holy
[26:15] Ghost we're going to speak in tongues
[26:18] we're going to do this we're going to do
[26:21] this but it's not one God word is one
[26:28] that's what we have to believe any man
[26:32] were to be a liar let God we to be the
[26:36] truth amen so when he
[26:40] came and the man they ask him said go up
[26:44] you see I told you I told you he not
[26:48] going to prophesy anything good for me
[26:50] when brah spoke to them spoke to them
[26:53] what did they
[26:56] say they all all MTH was
[27:01] one they don't want to
[27:03] repent and come to the real word of God
[27:07] that is the one that is taking them to
[27:10] heaven let me tell you I always
[27:13] said you cannot come to this message and
[27:17] believe this message and leave this
[27:19] message and be a very foolish virgin no
[27:23] it does not
[27:25] work if he comes to know the truth and
[27:28] rejected
[27:30] it you God is not taking you down there
[27:35] you have to finish the work Hallelujah
[27:38] you have to cross the
[27:42] line we going to we going to we're going
[27:44] to read about that
[27:48] Hallelujah and then when he spoke the
[27:52] word of God I see the Israelite go
[27:56] without a shepherd and then what
[27:59] happened they burn him and they smack
[28:02] him and they tell them he told them if
[28:06] you come
[28:07] back I'm I'm I put a sign on me I'm a
[28:10] false
[28:12] prophet see the lying Prophet always
[28:16] what do
[28:18] violence they always try to persuade to
[28:22] shake you to believe but believing is
[28:24] not for shaking believing is from the
[28:27] heart
[28:29] because you are the seed when God calls
[28:31] your name you
[28:32] respond
[28:34] hallelujah
[28:37] amen
[28:40] so they they show their colors because
[28:43] the Bible said by their fruit you shall
[28:47] know them and you know when Jeremiah
[28:50] spoke about that there was another
[28:53] another false prophet in uh in the
[28:56] Jeremiah I think 20 8 let me see if I
[29:00] can read a little bit over there for you
[29:02] to see
[29:04] there Jeremiah
[29:08] 28 let me see Jeremiah Jeremiah 28
[29:31] uh
[29:35] okay and it came to pass the same year
[29:38] in the beginning of the reign of
[29:39] zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth
[29:42] year in the fifth month and
[29:47] hanania
[29:49] hanania was another Prophet that's a
[29:52] lying
[29:55] Prophet the son of zua the prophet which
[30:00] was gibon speak unto me in the house of
[30:03] the
[30:04] Lord and
[30:07] before before Jeremiah has prophesied
[30:11] that they are going
[30:13] to they are going for slavery for 70
[30:17] years so this man going to prophesy
[30:21] against
[30:25] Jeremiah in the presence of the priest
[30:27] and and all the people saying thus
[30:30] speaketh the Lord of host the god of
[30:33] Israel saying I have broken the Yoke of
[30:35] the king of Babylon within two full
[30:38] years will I bring again into this place
[30:42] all the vessels of the Lord the Lord's
[30:46] house then that Nebuchadnezzar King of
[30:50] Babylon took away you see every
[30:55] time you do God speak and you speak
[30:59] against him sometime you shorten your
[31:02] life very very very do
[31:06] not
[31:08] pray with the word of God because the
[31:11] word of God is absolute God does not
[31:15] joke about his word
[31:18] hallelujah if we are believers let us be
[31:24] Believers Hallelujah
[31:28] king of nebuchad the king of B took away
[31:32] this place and carried them to Babylon
[31:34] and I will bring again to this
[31:37] place jeona the son of jeim the king of
[31:41] Judah with all captivity of Judah that
[31:45] went to Babylon said the Lord for I will

[1:04:41] Notice come up to the borderline and
[1:04:47] quit Notice come up Notice come up to
[1:04:51] the borderline and
[1:04:53] quit look here he he said in Hebrews the
[1:04:57] chapter 6 the sixth chapter
[1:05:01] now we was reading a while ago I told
[1:05:05] you refer back to it and we
[1:05:10] will for the next couple minutes he said
[1:05:14] but THS and TS which is n unto
[1:05:20] rejection whose end is to be burned
[1:05:24] borderline
[1:05:26] brother borderline believer he's talking
[1:05:29] about brother line believer
[1:05:34] okay yeah who have tasted the Heavenly
[1:05:39] gift tasted other words you seen it you
[1:05:44] can't brother
[1:05:46] Braham smack his lips
[1:05:52] together I just just taste it with your
[1:05:56] mouth but you see it and you knew it was
[1:06:02] the
[1:06:03] truth you know it was the truth tasted
[1:06:07] the Heavenly gift and made partakers of
[1:06:11] the Holy Spirit as it fell upon
[1:06:16] you tasted of the good word of God
[1:06:20] tested you seen it was
[1:06:23] right and the Holy G fall upon
[1:06:27] you the weed in the field and then turn
[1:06:34] away
[1:06:36] dying denying the very Christ that
[1:06:39] sanctify you and call you and
[1:06:44] put that anointing upon
[1:06:48] you there remained No sacrifice for sin
[1:06:52] for that
[1:06:56] there remain not no said there remain No
[1:07:00] sacrifice for sin for that it is
[1:07:05] unpardonable it is impossible for them
[1:07:09] to ever come to the knowledge of the
[1:07:17] truth for it is impossible for those who
[1:07:20] have made partakers of the Holy
[1:07:23] Spirit fell upon fell upon the whe sea
[1:07:28] Started With
[1:07:30] Jesus and Lord I am going through but
[1:07:34] when you hit the word you turn back made
[1:07:39] partakers of the Holy Spirit and even
[1:07:41] tasted or seeing the word is
[1:07:45] manifested and then turn away from it it
[1:07:49] is totally impossible for them to ever
[1:07:52] see it or come to it
[1:07:58] that's that said the scripture now
[1:08:01] Heaven and Earth will pass away but it
[1:08:05] won't you see it totally impossible that
[1:08:09] Bible says so the spelled Bears record
[1:08:13] of it notice let me give you a little
[1:08:16] example look at those people who
[1:08:19] came out
[1:08:21] of out of under Moses prophecy
[1:08:26] came out of the organization and come
[1:08:29] out of everything under the prophecy saw
[1:08:33] the great works and wonders and things
[1:08:36] like that and came up to the borderline
[1:08:40] of going
[1:08:42] in see there is no borderline you come
[1:08:46] down there you g you go back that's
[1:08:49] it now Lee there comes your name in the
