[34:53] place around us and you know people are
[34:55] looking for signs and people want to see
[34:57] signs and they're all bewildered by the
[35:00] signs but there's a voice that is
[35:03] speaking out of every sign that God
[35:07] gives amen amen praise God let's go to
[35:10] our first
[35:11] scripture the heavens declare the glory
[35:14] of God and the firmament showeth his
[35:18] handiwork day unto Day utth speech and
[35:23] night unto night showeth
[35:25] knowledge there is no speech nor
[35:28] language where their voice is not heard
[35:32] their line is gone out through all the
[35:35] Earth and their words to the end of the
[35:38] world in them hath he set a tabernacle
[35:42] for the sun which is as a bridegroom
[35:46] coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth
[35:50] as a strong man to run a race amen
[35:54] praise God let us pray
[35:56] father Lord Lord this scripture
[36:00] alone just blessed us tremendously Lord
[36:04] just uh you know we could just go home
[36:06] and rejoice right now but father we know
[36:09] that there's just so much more that you
[36:13] have for us and so we're asking that
[36:14] your anointing will come and Lord just
[36:17] take control over every atmosphere
[36:21] around every one of these that are in
[36:24] the house of the Lord here today Father
[36:27] may your presence go and move through
[36:30] the pews and through the hearts and
[36:32] through the lives and Lord may they may
[36:35] they hear something Lord between the
[36:37] lines Lord I know that I can bring
[36:39] you've placed all these things on my
[36:41] heart all these scriptures and all these
[36:43] quotes but Lord it takes your anointing
[36:45] and your spirit to bring it to life
[36:48] that's the voice that's the voice that
[36:51] we're interested in this morning Lord
[36:53] speak to us through these words through
[36:55] this uh Ministry this morning Lord take
[36:57] this vessel I give it to you I Surrender
[37:00] it completely Lord because I know I
[37:02] can't do it but I'm trusting you and may
[37:06] you take control now and bless your
[37:07] people in Jesus name amen God bless you
[37:10] Saints you may be
[37:12] seated praise God we look at that
[37:15] scripture there and there is just so
[37:17] much that we can draw from there the
[37:19] heavens declare the glory of God and the
[37:21] firmament showeth his handiwork day unto
[37:24] Day utth speech in other words God is in
[37:29] the heavens God is in the firmament God
[37:32] is in the Sun God is in the moon God is
[37:34] in every Star God is in every
[37:38] constellation everything that we look at
[37:41] even when we look at nature we see God
[37:44] we see death burial and Resurrection
[37:47] when we look right now we're entering
[37:49] into the spring you can see all the
[37:51] trees out there they look dead but
[37:54] there's life inside of those trees
[37:56] there's life starting to climb up into
[37:58] those trees and pretty soon they're
[38:00] going to Bud forth and the evidence is
[38:03] going to be the buds and the flowers and
[38:05] the leaves and it goes to show that
[38:07] Jesus Christ is alive the same yesterday
[38:10] today and forever if you can't see God
[38:14] in everything then you need to look
[38:16] again you need to open your heart and
[38:18] your understanding because in a day like
[38:21] this we should be rejoicing because God
[38:25] is is real he's he everywhere we can
[38:28] look into the Stars you know he told
[38:30] Abraham he said Abraham look up he says
[38:34] can you Number the
[38:35] Stars he was showing Abraham he says
[38:38] that's as many as I those are those are
[38:40] all mine he was talking about you and me
[38:44] he was talking about every single one
[38:46] that was in his heart in his mind from
[38:49] before the foundations of the world he
[38:51] had a plan that he was going to fulfill
[38:53] and that you and I would be a part of
[38:56] that plan and as dispensations move
[38:59] forward there is no speech nor language
[39:02] where their voices is not heard all
[39:05] those stars all those planets all those
[39:08] constellations all the signs and wonders
[39:11] every time that God would raise up a
[39:13] prophet there would be a voice in the
[39:16] sign amen the prophet would come out one
[39:19] Prophet would come out and and show his
[39:21] backside why would he do that because
[39:23] God was going to send a sign to the
[39:25] people but you had to recognize
[39:27] the sign and the voice that was coming
[39:30] from the sign amen praise God glory to
[39:34] God their language and and where their
[39:37] voice is not heard their line is gone
[39:39] out throughout all the Earth and their
[39:41] words to the end of the world he's
[39:43] talking about every
[39:45] constellation every Star every attribute
[39:49] everything that he had in his mind he's
[39:51] placed it in the heavens how many times
[39:54] have we seen the signs we've seen it
[39:56] through the world word when they saw the
[39:58] star of David when they saw when the
[40:01] when the Magi they would study the stars
[40:03] they knew that Messiah was on the earth
[40:06] when they could recognize that North
[40:08] Star that was shining bright they
[40:11] followed it until they came to the word
[40:13] of God Amen and every sign must lead you
[40:17] to the word of God Amen praise God glory
[40:21] to God let's go to the next
[40:24] scripture amen thank you Jesus
[40:28] in Genesis
[40:31] 1: 14 to 18 and God said let there be
[40:35] lights in the firmament of the heaven to
[40:38] divide the day from the night praise God
[40:41] aren't you glad that God sent his word
[40:44] to separate the darkness out of your
[40:46] life do you know that the light is the
[40:48] word for this hour that that his word is
[40:52] the light and without light you walk in
[40:56] darkness boy oh boy are we going to have
[40:59] an
[41:00] eclipse glory to God let them be for
[41:04] signs and for seasons and for days and
[41:08] years and let them be for lights in the
[41:11] firmament of Heaven to give light upon
[41:14] the Earth and it was so and God made two
[41:18] great lights notice they're both great
[41:21] lights one to rule the day and one to
[41:25] rule the night Hallelujah praise God
[41:28] forever more the greater light to Rule
[41:31] the Day the Lesser light to rule the
[41:33] night he made the Stars also and God s
[41:37] them set them in the firmament of Heaven
[41:39] to give light upon the Earth and to rule
[41:41] over the day and over the night and to
[41:44] divide the light from the darkness and
[41:47] God saw that it was good hallelujah
[41:51] praise God every one of those Stars when
[41:54] you look up I used to wonder why I was
[41:56] so am Amazed by the Stars everybody
[42:01] aren't you amazed have you ever gone up
[42:02] north you know and just laid down on the
[42:06] on the sand in the in in in the very
[42:09] peak of the you know the the darkness of
[42:11] night and look up into the Stars you
[42:13] will see God's God's Bible speaking
[42:17] constantly it's glittering over here all
[42:19] of a sudden a star falls over here oh
[42:21] somebody fell somebody's Fallen away
[42:23] from from the Lord somebody's left
[42:26] somebody's uh something's going on
[42:28] because the star falls and it vanishes
[42:32] you see everything is written in the
[42:34] heavens every life there's a there's a
[42:38] book of life and there's the Lamb's Book
[42:40] of Life let me tell you if your name is
[42:42] written in the Lamb's Book of Life your
[42:46] star is there it'll be steady it'll
[42:50] never move it'll never be taken it'll
[42:53] never backslide it'll never deny the
[42:56] word of God it'll stand firm it'll sit
[42:59] in the firmament and God will bring it
[43:01] into its position when the time comes
[43:04] when the sun you know you know the
[43:06] constellations the way they work is that
[43:08] that the sun moves through the
[43:10] constellations and as the sun moves
[43:12] through the constellations they they
[43:14] they they shine they begin to shine and
[43:17] they show themselves more and you have
[43:19] what's called planetary alignments based
[43:22] on the movement of the sun the sun is is
[43:25] a type of God nothing can can survive
[43:29] nothing can live nothing can can can
[43:31] exist without the sun here on this Earth
[43:35] amen any botney life anything that that
[43:38] that that that that lives and breathes
[43:40] upon the Earth it relies upon the sun
[43:43] did you know that even the animals rely
[43:45] upon the Sun how are they going to eat
[43:48] what they eat if the things that that
[43:50] that are eating are not going to grow so
[43:52] that they can eat them and so forth and
[43:54] everything else because it's plant life
[43:56] that God gave for
[43:59] food so everything evolves and revolves
[44:03] and requires the sun glory to God
[44:06] without it you're in total darkness
[44:09] Hallelujah glory to God so we're looking
[44:13] today we're looking at at the signs in
[44:15] the
[44:15] sky signs in the heaven the significance
[44:19] of these signs what is the real purpose
[44:22] of them in this day you see
[44:28] God placed them for
[44:32] signs
[44:34] Seasons days and years and so those
[44:38] three have to be acknowledged he's
[44:42] placed them there for signs he's placed
[44:44] them there in a certain
[44:46] season and they're for days and for
[44:49] years because there's going to be a day
[44:52] that certain things happen there's going
[44:53] to be years that certain things when
[44:55] we're talking about time here on Earth
[44:57] we're here on Earth everybody come to
[45:00] Earth okay but get your spiritual
[45:03] thinking cap on okay because everything
[45:06] we're talking about is a type okay but
[45:09] here on Earth we have to recognize that
[45:13] that we deal with time we deal with days
[45:16] we deal with years and God said in his
[45:18] scripture in ecclesiastics to everything
[45:21] there is a time and there is a season
[45:24] amen so there's a sense of mystery and
[45:27] wonder and also a lot of fear you know
[45:31] that there's people that are that are
[45:32] you know wondering boy is this going to
[45:34] be the end of the world when this
[45:35] eclipse takes place next or tomorrow
[45:38] people are want there's people that are
[45:40] calling for doomsday there's people that
[45:41] are calling for this some are saying
[45:43] Jesus is going to come tomorrow some are
[45:46] saying the Rapture is going to happen
[45:47] tomorrow some are saying that it's that
[45:49] it's going to be total chaos and and and
[45:52] Wars are going to break out
[45:54] tomorrow I'm telling you I don't know
[45:57] what's going to happen
[45:58] tomorrow I'm just listening for the
[46:01] voice that is coming from the
[46:04] sign because the spirit of God is
[46:07] speaking to us as individuals giving us
[46:12] Revelation and understanding of his word
[46:16] all I can tell you is this one thing for
[46:19] sure that every sign and every Star and
[46:23] every
[46:24] constellation and everything that that's
[46:27] written in the heavens is the same as
[46:30] it's written in the word of God and it's
[46:32] talking about one thing the Plan of
[46:36] Redemption amen the plan of Jesus Christ
[46:40] it started with Virgo it ends with Leo
[46:43] the Lion he came the first time he's
[46:45] coming the second time this whole thing
[46:48] whatever you look at the sun the moon
[46:50] the eclipses all these events that are
[46:53] happening in the world they lead and
[46:55] should point you as Sons and Daughters
[46:58] of God to one voice and one word and
[47:02] that is the voice and the word of our
[47:04] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to the rest
[47:07] of the world there's all kinds of chaos
[47:10] we're going to be looking at stuff like
[47:12] that we can see the mystery and the
[47:15] Wonder in these signs and we can know
[47:18] that these signs are you know have a
[47:21] significance in the world just look at
[47:24] Friday New York experienced an
[47:26] earthquake for the first time I think it
[47:28] was in 200 years that they've had that
[47:31] type of uh seismic event those are
[47:35] unusual things that are taking place you
[47:38] look at the condition uh you know you
[47:40] look at Taiwan they just had a terrible
[47:41] earthquake you look at um you know uh
[47:45] Wars that are taking place right now in
[47:47] in Ukraine in Israel in in uh Haiti and
[47:52] all these different like there's total
[47:54] chaos and we knew that the scripture
[47:56] told us that there would be Wars rumors
[47:59] of wars the sun would would turn to
[48:02] blood or the moon would turn to blood
[48:04] and there would be signs and wonders in
[48:06] the heaven all of these things we know
[48:08] from the word of God that they were
[48:11] already told to us we know that this is
[48:15] all scriptural but to the rest of the
[48:17] world that do not believe in the light
[48:22] will walk in
[48:23] darkness and so the Signs Now become
[48:27] fearful they become devastating to
[48:29] certain people they're they're afraid of
[48:31] what's going to happen tomorrow there's
[48:32] people that are that are not sending
[48:34] their kids to school there's people that
[48:36] are loading up on groceries and water
[48:38] and all kinds of you know fear that's
[48:41] been set into the hearts of the people
[48:43] but there's a
[48:44] reason for every single sign when we
[48:50] recognize that it comes from the Lord
[48:53] and Savior Jesus Christ
[48:57] glory to God Amen listen next
[49:02] slide William brandham says here now
[49:05] that's what God gives a sign
[49:09] for is to attract the attention of the
[49:12] people that's what a sign is for is to
[49:15] attract attention and we go down through
[49:17] the scripture here as we teach it now
[49:20] for a few minutes and find out if that
[49:23] isn't so that he gives these signs to
[49:26] attract attention and then when he gets
[49:28] the attention of the people then the
[49:31] voice of the sign begins to
[49:34] speak you see God's God's trying to get
[49:38] your
[49:40] attention we know that listen we know
[49:42] that he's he's he's got the attention of
[49:44] the people out there but their attention
[49:46] is not on him they're not looking to him
[49:50] for deliverance instruction leadership
[49:53] what to do how to understand to know
[49:56] that God has an escape plan for
[49:58] you God has something in store for those
[50:02] that know him those that have been
[50:04] called and have recognized him behind
[50:07] the sign that it's him it's his voice
[50:09] that's in the sign so so so the voice of
[50:13] the sign begins to speak Jesus healed
[50:16] the sick to attract their attention see
[50:20] then when he begin to preach see they
[50:23] always it attracts attention the burning
[50:26] bush was given to Moses to attract The
[50:29] Runaway prophet's attention a lot of
[50:31] people are going to and fro they don't
[50:34] know what church to go to they don't
[50:36] know what to believe they don't know if
[50:38] there's a trinity they don't know if
[50:39] there's a one God they don't know if
[50:41] there's a mighty God and then an an
[50:43] almighty God they don't know if God is
[50:44] in Buddha they don't know if God is in
[50:46] Muhammad they don't know if God is in in
[50:48] the in the the the punjabis because
[50:51] they've got all kinds of different gods
[50:53] like where is
[50:55] God
[50:57] so he's got to grab their
[51:00] attention but
[51:02] remember he can never
[51:05] change and it's his voice that will that
[51:08] will bring you out of the chaos or the
[51:11] condition that you might be in here this
[51:13] morning whatever the circumstances are I
[51:16] don't know I'm bringing a message here
[51:19] about the voice of the sign and I want
[51:23] you to recognize that there's a lot of
[51:25] signs that are going on around us but
[51:27] can you recognize the sign for this
[51:29] morning because that's what I'm
[51:31] interested in that's what stirred my
[51:33] heart God God was speaking to my heart
[51:36] through this through this I I was you
[51:38] know I was reading and then I would
[51:40] study and then I would get a part of the
[51:42] message and I couldn't quite you know
[51:44] and I was saying Lord I just you just
[51:46] know like as a minister you're you're
[51:48] waiting on that anointing to just strike
[51:51] the word and you know when it happens
[51:54] and I was moving through the house all
[51:56] week and I would go here go there and I
[51:59] was you know and it was it was on Friday
[52:01] night I was up right up until 11:00
[52:04] still working I probably spent 30 hours
[52:06] on this and I was still not there I was
[52:10] just Lord you know and then I walked
[52:13] into my bedroom to get ready to go to
[52:15] sleep and my wife plays a tape she puts
[52:18] a tape on every night you know and I
[52:20] walked into the room and
[52:24] boom the spirit of God just just stopped
[52:27] me right in my and and I'm and the
[52:29] prophet was speaking on the voice of the
[52:33] sign and I said there it is that's where
[52:37] go that's where you're talking now now
[52:40] all of a sudden the anointing started to
[52:42] come around and he started to say what
[52:43] did you recognize what is it that called
[52:46] you what is it that that that pulled you
[52:49] when you went into that church when you
[52:51] went into when you met with those
[52:52] Brothers when you went into brother
[52:54] Gabriel's uh uh you know uh place there
[52:57] to buy furniture something attracted
[52:59] your attention and it wasn't the the the
[53:03] the fact that you were looking for signs
[53:05] and wonders but a voice a voice
[53:09] interceded and came in and and started
[53:12] to deal with you personal started to
[53:15] deliver you personally started to deal
[53:17] with situations with you personally and
[53:20] I said oh I see Lord in every sign in
[53:24] everything that's why that's scripture
[53:27] that we read from from from The Book of
[53:29] Psalms at the beginning there it was it
[53:31] just became so real that he utters he
[53:34] speaks he's constantly speaking to us
[53:37] revealing himself to us and we need to
[53:39] recognize what he's saying so he you
[53:42] know he said you know Moses was a
[53:44] runaway prophet and he needed to catch
[53:46] his attention and he turned aside to see
[53:48] what it was then the sign gave a
[53:52] voice hallelujah praise God you might be
[53:55] hearing me read scripture this morning
[53:57] you might hear me read a a quote you
[54:00] might see a picture that we put up here
[54:02] this morning and you might hear a
[54:04] comment on it or some kind of a fact
[54:06] surrounding it and God s just in in
[54:10] instantly just comes right in rides that
[54:13] word directly pierces your heart and
[54:15] shows you exactly what he is saying to
[54:19] you thank you that's what you need to be
[54:22] interested in here this morning when you
[54:24] come into Good Neighbor Ministries
[54:26] I want you to know you're coming into a
[54:28] place where God has absolute preeminence
[54:32] thank the ministers that stand here
[54:35] we've been trained by a pastor that
[54:37] showed us how to get out of the way
[54:40] that's something that's very important
[54:42] to be a minister of this hour where God
[54:45] wants to have total preeminence he
[54:47] doesn't need our thoughts he doesn't
[54:49] need our ideas he just needs us to
[54:52] surrender he will speak to every single
[54:55] need that's in the house here this
[54:56] morning not one of you can leave here
[54:59] the same way if you're paying attention
[55:02] if you fall
[55:03] asleep sweet
[55:06] dreams thank you Jesus but you might
[55:08] wake up to a
[55:09] nightmare because things are not going
[55:11] to get better here on Earth and we need
[55:14] to know what the word says about us and
[55:17] what we need to do glory to God so now
[55:21] these voices and signs are to alert the
[55:25] people of God's word word it's to alert
[55:28] us back to the word not to the sign the
[55:32] sign is speaking and it's telling us go
[55:35] back to the word that's me in the word
[55:37] that's me in the sun when you look at
[55:39] the sun you can see that I give life and
[55:41] light to everything so if you if if
[55:43] you're going to recognize my word you're
[55:45] going to need my spirit and you're going
[55:48] to need to know how to receive my spirit
[55:50] so that when you read the word it
[55:52] becomes life it becomes clear it gives
[55:55] you easy easy instruction on how to live
[55:58] how to please God what's required in
[56:01] order to receive his anointing in your
[56:03] life and his Deliverance in your life
[56:06] praise God it's just about ready to be
[56:08] Vindicated amen always a sign is to
[56:12] attract the attention of the people
[56:15] let's go to the next slide and so here
[56:20] now when we look you know when we look
[56:23] at
[56:25] um sign for example you know signs are
[56:28] are are something that that that just
[56:31] attracts the attention of the people but
[56:33] there's a lot more in the sign amen
[56:36] praise God it's to attract us to the
[56:39] word of God glory to God here you know
[56:42] uh he says
[56:44] here
[56:46] um the seed shall not be air with the
[56:49] Shu Jesus said no man cometh to me
[56:51] except my father has drawn him and all
[56:55] that my father has ha given me they will
[56:58] come my sheep my doves hear my voice a
[57:03] stranger they will not follow and what
[57:06] is the voice of God it's the word of God
[57:11] what's any man's voice but his word it's
[57:14] the word of God they'll hear the word of
[57:18] God and so when we look at signs we look
[57:21] at signs in the heavens signs in the
[57:24] skies are you know they recur over and
[57:26] over and over again particularly in
[57:29] prophetic timelines when we look at
[57:32] prophecy okay they often they're they're
[57:35] used to signify important
[57:38] events there's a lot of important events
[57:41] that are taking place right now within
[57:43] the body of Jesus Christ and we want to
[57:46] we want to know all about it we want to
[57:48] let the Holy Spirit come and have his
[57:50] his way through this ministry and
[57:53] through our lives so that he can fulfill
[57:55] the part that we are a part of so that
[57:59] he can move through our lives these
[58:01] signs are not just random occurrences or
[58:03] natural phenomena but they are divinely
[58:06] orchestrated by
[58:08] God Amen they serve as a Divine
[58:12] communication tool a way for God to
[58:15] speak to his people and to the world
[58:19] because at the same time that he's
[58:21] speaking light and instruction and
[58:24] giving you inspiration and Revelation on
[58:26] the word of God the word is being spoken
[58:29] to those that are souls that are in
[58:31] prison people that can never receive the
[58:34] light because they choose to walk in the
[58:39] darkness you talk to somebody that that
[58:42] is a Buddhist and their their mind is in
[58:44] this world of Buddhism and that they're
[58:47] all part of the universe and they've got
[58:49] so many truths but they're leaving out
[58:52] the very link that connects them to
[58:56] Elohim the self-existent one the
[58:59] universe the one who created all things
[59:03] they don't want to allow his light to
[59:05] come in to Enlighten them to the plan
[59:08] that he has for their life and the plan
[59:10] that he has for
[59:12] Humanity because at the same time that
[59:14] he's speaking through this these signs
[59:16] to the people of the world and like we
[59:18] said there people are being put into
[59:20] fear put into doubt put into all kinds
[59:23] of chaos and everything else but to the
[59:25] bride
[59:27] it's
[59:28] shalom thy light has
[59:31] come thy Victory is is here I am your
[59:35] Victory I am your light I am the way the
[59:38] truth and the life amen so there a way
[59:41] of God communicating the sun and the
[59:43] moon are significant in that uh they are
[59:46] signs and to understand the signs we
[59:49] need to recognize what the word says
[59:52] about those signs the sun is a Ty type
[59:56] of Christ and the Moon is a type of the
[1:00:00] church the Bride of Jesus Christ and it
[1:00:03] also types Israel remember Israel is a
[1:00:07] type of the bride and all the events
[1:00:10] that are now taking place that's why
[1:00:14] simultaneously there are events and here
[1:00:17] let's just move on here and then you're
[1:00:19] going to see as I come into the seasons
[1:00:21] but when you hear the word and you hear
[1:00:23] the word being spoken as a gentile
[1:00:26] remember God is speaking to the Gentiles
[1:00:29] God is speaking through the sun he's
[1:00:31] speaking to the Gentiles and those that
[1:00:34] are that that recognize the light they
[1:00:36] come into the word they come into the
[1:00:39] body of Christ the rest that reject the
[1:00:41] light they stay in darkness there's no
[1:00:45] light in them and therefore they walk in
[1:00:48] darkness amen praise God but seeing the
[1:00:51] signs is not enough it's like reading
[1:00:53] the Bible the letter s but the spirit
[1:00:57] gives it life and when you receive the
[1:01:01] light of God's word you receive the Holy
[1:01:03] Spirit you you obey God's how do I get
[1:01:05] the Holy Spirit you need to be baptized
[1:01:08] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:10] I've said it over and over again I
[1:01:12] remember listen I didn't understand
[1:01:15] anything but when I got the Revelation
[1:01:18] that my life needed to be washed of an
[1:01:22] old life and needed to be buried and and
[1:01:25] and and left behind there was there was
[1:01:28] one thing that I was looking for the
[1:01:30] tank I said I want to be baptized I want
[1:01:33] to I want to I want to express something
[1:01:36] that's taking place within me and so
[1:01:38] that's why I had to run to the water
[1:01:40] amen and if you haven't been to the
[1:01:42] water yet it's not going to
[1:01:45] supernaturally change you but I will see
[1:01:49] and others will see that a supernatural
[1:01:52] change has taken place in
[1:01:54] you
[1:01:56] Hallelujah because it's God that does
[1:01:58] the work it's God that delivers it's God
[1:02:01] that that that sets the people free amen
[1:02:03] praise God and so it's not enough just
[1:02:06] to to to watch the signs to read about
[1:02:09] the signs you can go on Google and you
[1:02:11] can type in uh uh you know April 6th um
[1:02:15] uh eclipse and you can find all kinds of
[1:02:19] interpretations you can go on YouTube
[1:02:21] you can get 50 different interpretations
[1:02:24] on what's going to happen
[1:02:26] it's going to do you no good if you
[1:02:28] don't have the spirit of God to discern
[1:02:32] what you're watching what you're hearing
[1:02:34] amen and that only happens by the word
[1:02:37] of God Jesus says I will give you the
[1:02:40] comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he
[1:02:44] will guide you into all truth he didn't
[1:02:48] say some truth all truth that's the
[1:02:51] beauty when when when when when the Lord
[1:02:53] enlightened my mind he started to answer
[1:02:55] answer every question that I had it was
[1:02:59] like sitting with Solomon you know
[1:03:02] because he he he could answer every
[1:03:04] question he had the wisdom uh you know
[1:03:06] to to because he was the greater than
[1:03:09] Solomon he was the greater than Solomon
[1:03:12] praise God he was the one that could
[1:03:14] answer every question he could he says I
[1:03:16] knew you before you even came to the
[1:03:18] Earth you know he would tell us things
[1:03:20] like that do you hear him telling you
[1:03:21] those things I knew you before you came
[1:03:23] here you might be sitting at Good
[1:03:25] Neighbor Ministries here on April the
[1:03:27] 7th you know 19 uh 2024 but let me tell
[1:03:31] you God knew you before there was even a
[1:03:35] number you were a star in the heavens
[1:03:40] praise God hallelujah and now you walk
[1:03:43] in the light and have come out of the
[1:03:45] darkness seasons in scripture Seasons
[1:03:48] interpreted the Hebrew word
[1:03:51] moed it's from it's it's translated to
[1:03:55] English as Seasons but in fact derives
[1:03:58] from the Hebrew word ad which means
[1:04:02] eternity that's what it means that that
[1:04:05] that we are
[1:04:07] Eternal and that we are being expressed
[1:04:11] in a certain
[1:04:12] season and Israel at at the same time
[1:04:16] it's a common word used uh in the word
[1:04:18] of Hebrew for for holidays for festivals
[1:04:22] because they always took place at the
[1:04:23] same time of the year that's why
[1:04:26] these signs in the moon and in the stars
[1:04:28] and in the sun you notice that they
[1:04:30] always take place right around Hebrew
[1:04:36] holidays there's a reason for that God
[1:04:40] is in every single sign and everything
[1:04:45] that we if if you start to study and
[1:04:47] look into all of this you will see that
[1:04:50] God is dealing with a chosen
[1:04:53] people and I'm not just talking about
[1:04:55] Israel
[1:04:57] Israel is the
[1:04:59] type of the real of the reality God's
[1:05:04] Sons and Daughters God's stars that were
[1:05:07] placed there from before the foundations
[1:05:09] of the world those that came from God
[1:05:12] that are God attributes of God that are
[1:05:16] God all we're doing is we're playing it
[1:05:19] out as humans we're here in a human
[1:05:23] Dimension and everything is playing it
[1:05:25] self out in a human way but if we pay
[1:05:29] attention we'll see that everything is
[1:05:32] really scripturally it is that we are
[1:05:34] Supernatural attributes of God that are
[1:05:37] being called back to Eternity we are not
[1:05:41] creatures of time we're we're in time
[1:05:45] but our true identity is eternal with
[1:05:49] God and so these things that they happen
[1:05:53] in Seasons meaning the great lights the
[1:05:55] Moon the sun will be used as signs for
[1:05:58] upcoming events and the second meaning
[1:06:00] that can be understood from the original
[1:06:02] Hebrew is that the sun and the moon will
[1:06:04] be used for determining the time of the
[1:06:07] holidays as we can still see in the
[1:06:09] Hebrew calendar even today in which the
[1:06:12] moon and the sun play a significant role
[1:06:14] in determining when will be the exact
[1:06:17] date of biblical
[1:06:18] holidays amen praise God we're in the
[1:06:22] time of the Passover right now and we're
[1:06:24] having what's called a total solar
[1:06:27] eclipse here in the in the time of of
[1:06:31] the Hebrew uh Passover where it's it's
[1:06:36] Easter to them it's the Passover to us
[1:06:38] it's Easter to us it's about the
[1:06:41] resurrection of Jesus Christ to them it
[1:06:44] was that God passed over them and did
[1:06:46] not destroy them the death angel did not
[1:06:48] destroy them so to them all these all
[1:06:52] these holidays and all these um Jewish
[1:06:55] Hol holidays that they that they observe
[1:06:57] they all tie in Back to the word of God
[1:07:00] for a time in a season there's even a
[1:07:03] time of the of the Rapture there's a
[1:07:05] time for for them to gather together
[1:07:08] there's a time for everything to take
[1:07:11] place there's a holy convocation that's
[1:07:13] now moving into place where where you
[1:07:16] know where where the the whole world is
[1:07:19] going to witness things and and chaos is
[1:07:21] going to come into the land and we're
[1:07:23] going to go into a Great Tribulation and
[1:07:25] Israel is going to be awakened from
[1:07:28] their sleep to recognize that Jesus
[1:07:30] Christ is actually the
[1:07:34] Messiah praise God and the Lord so we
[1:07:37] know that these Seasons they they are
[1:07:40] significant in that they are uh uh all
[1:07:43] tied to describing God's time for his
[1:07:47] people here on this earth and the season
[1:07:50] that they're going to enter into we are
[1:07:53] now in the season of the Rapture amen we
[1:07:57] are now in the season to be translated
[1:08:00] out of this
[1:08:01] Dimension then the Lord has days and
[1:08:04] years well that's simple the Lord has
[1:08:05] appointed particular days and years for
[1:08:07] things to happen here on this Earth and
[1:08:10] we don't know the day or the hour but
[1:08:13] rest assured that the Lord knows the
[1:08:15] exact time for everything because in
[1:08:18] ecclesiastics 31 to everything there is
[1:08:21] a
[1:08:22] season and a time to every
[1:08:27] purpose
[1:08:28] under the
[1:08:30] heavens you see it always goes back to
[1:08:33] the God's first Bible amen praise God
[1:08:36] let's go to the
[1:08:37] next listen to brother brandham here
[1:08:39] he's speaking he says God's first Bible
[1:08:42] was in the skies the Zodiac it starts
[1:08:45] off and runs every Age The First
[1:08:47] beginning with the zodiac is a virgin
[1:08:49] that's how he come first the last figure
[1:08:53] in the zodiac is Leo the Lion the second
[1:08:55] coming just before there is a cross
[1:08:58] fishes which is the cancer age that
[1:09:00] we're living in now praise God right
[1:09:04] from the future home he was talking
[1:09:06] about dispensations and time and things
[1:09:10] and he was God was giving him a
[1:09:12] revelation on the future home God was
[1:09:15] showing him that that for for the Bride
[1:09:17] of Jesus Christ there's going to be a
[1:09:19] time where she's going to be restored
[1:09:21] back to to to that Perfection again amen
[1:09:24] I don't want to get into all of that
[1:09:26] that's just another message all in
[1:09:27] itself praise God but
[1:09:30] here the Zodiac has been perverted
[1:09:34] today we know about the Virgin we know
[1:09:37] about Leo the Lion and we know all about
[1:09:40] the different signs that are in the
[1:09:42] Zodiac but yet you know there's a lot of
[1:09:44] perversion that's going on and people
[1:09:47] have taken the Zodiac to distract the
[1:09:49] people from the word of God and people
[1:09:53] even you are getting caught up into
[1:09:56] these things you'll go and you'll start
[1:09:58] reading the horror
[1:10:03] scope listen to the word itself horror
[1:10:07] scope it's a scope of of horror that's
[1:10:10] that that you know if you believe in
[1:10:11] those things and you think that the
[1:10:13] horoscope you're going to go into you
[1:10:15] know the Toronto Star I see people all
[1:10:17] they do you know I was it's funny I was
[1:10:19] with some you know family and one of
[1:10:21] them you know came and visited and he
[1:10:23] saw the Toronto son my dad reads the you
[1:10:25] know reads the newspapers and we were
[1:10:27] there with our family and the first
[1:10:28] thing he went right to the newspaper
[1:10:30] didn't even really pay attention to
[1:10:31] thing he went straight to the
[1:10:34] horoscope I looked at him I go what are
[1:10:36] you doing I read the horoscope I said oh
[1:10:40] okay yeah people live their lives based
[1:10:44] on what the horoscope tells them that
[1:10:48] day and they think that whatever it says
[1:10:51] there oh boy I'm having a bad day today
[1:10:54] it says that the Moon is over here and
[1:10:56] if the moon is over there then I'm going
[1:10:58] to be schizophrenic today so I guess I'm
[1:11:01] going to have to be schizophrenic today
[1:11:04] you see these things do affect
[1:11:08] people the moon the stars they do affect
[1:11:12] people okay but you as a son or a
[1:11:15] daughter of God that's filled with the
[1:11:18] Holy Ghost that's been sealed by the
[1:11:20] Holy Ghost until the day of your
[1:11:23] Redemption okay that's been washed and
[1:11:26] cleansed of all of that because that's
[1:11:28] all sin that's all unbelief remember
[1:11:31] anything anybody that's a psychic
[1:11:33] that'll tell you that you know this is
[1:11:36] going to happen to you that's going to
[1:11:38] happen to you this is going to go wrong
[1:11:40] this is going to go great listen if they
[1:11:43] aren't connected to the word of God and
[1:11:46] everything that they say isn't 100% I
[1:11:50] don't care if 90% of it is
[1:11:53] true it could be 99 % true but if it
[1:11:57] ain't 100 it ain't God because God is
[1:12:00] perfect I remember going to a psychic
[1:12:03] you know but God protects his children I
[1:12:06] didn't know God at the time but I was
[1:12:08] told by a very wealthy individual you go
[1:12:11] see this lady she's in Hamilton she's
[1:12:14] going to tell you things you want to
[1:12:16] know about your business you want to
[1:12:17] know about this and that person that
[1:12:20] told me to go today they are a company
[1:12:23] that's worth over 7 $700
[1:12:26] million that company okay I'm not going
[1:12:29] to get into the names but they were
[1:12:31] personal friends of mine and they told
[1:12:33] me go there and I remember I was just
[1:12:35] young I just opened up fantasy over here
[1:12:37] in Oakville I thought okay I'm going to
[1:12:39] go I'm going to listen to him he's got
[1:12:41] four stores already you know I went
[1:12:44] there I knocked on the door I'm waiting
[1:12:46] there the lady opens the door she
[1:12:49] goes
[1:12:51] oh she says you know you have a very
[1:12:54] strong aura
[1:12:55] I said '
[1:12:57] really okay she says come on in I went
[1:13:00] inside I sat down sat at the T at the
[1:13:04] desk I remember clearly she was sitting
[1:13:06] on that side of the desk I was sitting
[1:13:08] here I'm looking she goes give me your
[1:13:09] watch took my watch off I gave it to her
[1:13:13] she's holding the watch she goes like
[1:13:20] this are you looking for
[1:13:23] Jesus I said no
[1:13:26] thank she
[1:13:27] says I see the face of
[1:13:30] Jesus I said really I I said this lady's
[1:13:35] like religious or something
[1:13:38] right she goes
[1:13:41] back she
[1:13:43] comes all I can see is Jesus I see the
[1:13:46] face of Jesus she says but your father
[1:13:51] he has a hearing problem I said ow you
[1:13:53] got my attention
[1:13:56] because he does and she says you your
[1:14:00] your your lineage is is is from a priest
[1:14:03] Hood you come from a a a priest
[1:14:07] background of some sort he says you have
[1:14:10] priests in your family I said no he says
[1:14:14] oh okay well Jesus somehow I can't get
[1:14:18] anything more that's all I can really
[1:14:20] say and I left that place and I forgot
[1:14:24] all about it
[1:14:26] and I didn't think anything else of it
[1:14:28] and it wasn't for another seven years
[1:14:31] after that that was in 1987 in 1994 is
[1:14:34] when I came to the Lord and I recognized
[1:14:39] that Jesus was a big part of my past and
[1:14:44] my
[1:14:45] [Applause]
[1:14:48] future now what am I saying I'm not
[1:14:51] giving glory to the psychic because even
[1:14:54] the one that came and met brother
[1:14:56] brandham on the on the bus and said hey
[1:14:58] buddy did you know that you've got a
[1:15:00] star over you that you've got a you've
[1:15:02] got a sign over you and that he says get
[1:15:04] away from me but she knew because she
[1:15:07] was able to recognize she had a gift to
[1:15:11] see certain things but only what God
[1:15:13] allows them to see amen amen praise God
[1:15:18] but look let's read the the next slide
[1:15:20] here Jeremiah 10: 1-3 he says hear ye
[1:15:24] the word which the Lord speaketh unto
[1:15:26] you oh House of Israel and when he's
[1:15:28] talking about the house of Israel I want
[1:15:30] you to know he's talking to you he's
[1:15:32] talking to the Bride of Jesus Christ he
[1:15:34] says oh House of Israel thus sayeth the
[1:15:36] Lord learn not the way of the Heathen
[1:15:40] and be not dismayed at signs of Heaven

[1:15:49] Zodiac
[1:15:51] horoscopes there's a real zodiac that's
[1:15:55] God's Bible but you need that
[1:15:57] interpreted by the spirit of God himself
[1:15:59] and remember God is his own interpreter
[1:16:02] he will make it plain you will not need
[1:16:05] to figure anything out he will he will
[1:16:08] uh interpret it right into your own life
[1:16:10] just like he did with me when I went to
[1:16:12] see that psychic I had no idea that
[1:16:15] Jesus was going to be my whole life but
[1:16:18] today he's all he's everything he means
[1:16:22] everything to me because because there
[1:16:24] is no no future but Jesus Christ the
[1:16:27] coming of the Lord he says don't you
[1:16:31] believe those Heathen and be not dis
[1:16:33] dismayed at the signs of Heaven for the
[1:16:35] Heathen are dismayed at them everybody
[1:16:39] oh boy I got to go see my psychic people
[1:16:41] I I got friends and family they visit
[1:16:44] psychics and I've seen some of them that
[1:16:46] have gone to see psychics and their
[1:16:48] lives went completely backwards not
[1:16:53] forwards when I tell him listen you want
[1:16:55] you want the real psychic you need to
[1:16:57] come to Jesus Christ he's the only one
[1:17:00] that can discern your life tell you

[1:17:05] going he can tell you everything about
[1:17:07] yourself he can tell you the part that
[1:17:09] you're going to play in his economy he's
[1:17:12] got a place for you he loves you he's
[1:17:15] he's got something beyond what you could
[1:17:17] possibly even imagine that's who you
[1:17:20] want to meet is Dr Jesus you want to
[1:17:23] meet him he'll tell you all about it for
[1:17:26] the customs of the people are what
[1:17:28] they're vain it's in vain they they want
[1:17:31] to go there and they want to hear good
[1:17:33] they want you know all these psychics
[1:17:34] now do you know that it's a big it's
[1:17:36] huge it's a huge business you can go

[1:17:55] happening in your life what God what
[1:17:58] what the Stars they never mention Jesus
[1:18:00] Christ they mention the Stars what the
[1:18:03] stars have for you what the
[1:18:05] constellations are going to say about
[1:18:07] you it's not the word of God you know
[1:18:10] what it is it's a distraction it's a
[1:18:12] business to distract the people from the
[1:18:15] word of God we need to recognize the
[1:18:17] voice of the sign and we need to know
[1:18:19] that there's only one voice and the
[1:18:21] voice is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:18:24] today and forever amen praise God let's
[1:18:27] look at the
[1:18:30] next Deuteronomy here he says if there
[1:18:34] be found among you within any of thy
[1:18:36] Gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee
[1:18:40] man or woman that hath wrought
[1:18:42] wickedness in the sight of the Lord thy
[1:18:45] God in transgressing his Covenant and
[1:18:48] hath gone and served other gods and
[1:18:51] worshiped them either the Sun or the
[1:18:54] Moon or any host of Heaven which I have
[1:18:57] not
[1:18:59] commanded God don't want you worshiping
[1:19:02] the son there's people that worship the
[1:19:04] son and there's people that are called
[1:19:07] Christians that they you know like like
[1:19:09] like look at the Roman Catholic Church
[1:19:11] they've got the son you know they've got
[1:19:13] the son at every one of their uh you
[1:19:15] know churches a lot of them will have a
[1:19:16] big son there you know because they they
[1:19:20] indirectly they don't realize but but
[1:19:22] it's Pagan teaching it's pagan rituals
[1:19:26] to worship the Sun or worship the moon
[1:19:28] or worship the Stars that's not about
[1:19:31] worshiping the Stars the moon the sun
[1:19:34] it's about worshiping Jesus Christ who
[1:19:36] is in the stars the moon and the sun he
[1:19:40] speaketh through them by Revelation to
[1:19:43] the Sons and Daughters of God Amen those
[1:19:46] that will accept him receive his light
[1:19:49] amen praise God next slide look in
[1:19:52] Daniel Daniel answered in the presence
[1:19:55] of the king because the King was looking
[1:19:56] for an interpretation and a lot of
[1:19:58] people you know they get they get you
[1:20:00] know desperate you know sometimes just
[1:20:02] things aren't going right you know I
[1:20:04] just need to hear something I'm going to
[1:20:05] need to talk to somebody you know they
[1:20:08] want to go talk to a psychic or they
[1:20:10] want to go talk to a psychologist they
[1:20:12] want to you know I need a psychologist I
[1:20:15] hear people you know people talking you
[1:20:16] know I need to go see a psychologist
[1:20:18] people that call themselves Christians
[1:20:20] talk to a psychologist you need to talk
[1:20:23] to God In Prayer on your hand and your
[1:20:25] knees until God answers you because you
[1:20:28] either believe God or you don't believe
[1:20:30] God because that's the way of the
[1:20:32] Heathen that's the way of putting your
[1:20:34] your your trust now if you need somebody
[1:20:36] to talk to that's good there's nothing
[1:20:39] wrong with having somebody to talk to
[1:20:41] but thinking that they're going to give
[1:20:43] you the answer unless it's another
[1:20:46] brother or sister that's anointed by the
[1:20:48] Holy Ghost that's why we
[1:20:50] Fellowship that's why we come together
[1:20:52] in fellowship and when we come together
[1:20:54] with pure hearts and and our and our
[1:20:57] Spirits are clean and and there's
[1:20:58] nothing between us you know there's
[1:21:01] there's no unbelief between us and you I
[1:21:04] I love that kind of Fellowship you get
[1:21:06] into that kind of Fellowship it takes a
[1:21:07] while to get you know moving into that
[1:21:09] realm but once the love of God just
[1:21:12] overtakes you and you're you're in
[1:21:14] Fellowship around his word he starts to
[1:21:16] speak left right and Center he starts to
[1:21:19] unveil himself pride gets out of the way
[1:21:22] all those things at the end of that
[1:21:23] Fellowship all you want to do is you
[1:21:25] want to hug them you want to I love you
[1:21:27] brother praise God I so appreci why
[1:21:30] because the spirit and the anointing of
[1:21:32] God came into the midst of that that's
[1:21:35] that's real uh you know therapy you want
[1:21:39] good therapy you need to get into
[1:21:40] Fellowship around the word of God you
[1:21:43] need to love one another you need to
[1:21:45] spend time together people are people
[1:21:48] are getting caught up with this too much
[1:21:50] I see it all over the place I see it in
[1:21:53] listen we're human being means we can't
[1:21:55] help it we get tired we get miserable
[1:21:57] sometimes but listen you need to you
[1:21:59] need to pay attention you need to pay
[1:22:02] attention to your attitude and your and
[1:22:04] your expressions and the way you carry
[1:22:06] yourself and the way you greet one
[1:22:09] another you know that you can give
[1:22:11] somebody a look oh yeah oh yeah man I
[1:22:14] can tell you that guy he can give a look
[1:22:16] to somebody and spoil their whole day I
[1:22:18] know a lot of people that can do that
[1:22:21] right in this
[1:22:23] message they look at you in a certain
[1:22:25] way and you got it right you know that
[1:22:27] that don't come near me don't even look
[1:22:30] at me I don't want nothing to do with
[1:22:32] you what is that it's not God that's not
[1:22:36] God they're they're anointed and they're
[1:22:38] being controlled by an A different kind
[1:22:41] of a spirit because the spirit of God
[1:22:44] will humble you will will keep you
[1:22:46] humble will allow you to to to to see
[1:22:49] the the the reality is God real to you
[1:22:52] or not if God is a reality to you then
[1:22:55] then the the love of God should be
[1:22:57] pouring out of your heart you want to
[1:22:59] see situations change in people's lives
[1:23:01] and people's attitudes project the love
[1:23:04] of God into those
[1:23:06] situations project the love of God greet
[1:23:09] them love them show them that you
[1:23:11] appreciate them show them by by by
[1:23:14] shaking their hands and saying Hey
[1:23:15] Brother Hey sister I appreciate you I
[1:23:18] appreciate what you're doing thank you
[1:23:19] for this thank you for
[1:23:21] that it's important amen
[1:23:24] it's a part of the body of Christ moving
[1:23:27] and and and having the supernatural work
[1:23:30] within it you want to send the holy
[1:23:32] ghost out of the church you just get one
[1:23:35] person that starts to put an evil eye
[1:23:38] here and there and and starts to you
[1:23:39] know show attitude towards situations
[1:23:42] and everything else it'll grieve the
[1:23:44] Holy Ghost right out of the
[1:23:46] fellowship yet one person that's got a
[1:23:48] spirit of gossip on them starts talking
[1:23:50] about this brother or that sister or
[1:23:52] this or that God knows knows all about
[1:23:55] those things God is very very very aware
[1:23:59] of those kinds of situations and he
[1:24:01] hates it because it brings disc scord
[1:24:03] into the body of Christ and it's and it
[1:24:06] just puts his Spirit on the sideline so
[1:24:08] he's either going to take that Spirit
[1:24:11] out of you or he's going to take you out
[1:24:12] one or the other it's as simple as that
[1:24:15] we're not going to tolerate that in this
[1:24:17] house we want the spirit of God to move
[1:24:20] and to deliver and to set free and
[1:24:23] people to die out to their own ideas and
[1:24:25] their own attitudes and their own
[1:24:27] interpretations oh no God showed me this
[1:24:30] this is my interpretation of it this is
[1:24:33] the way it should have been this is how
[1:24:34] it should have been that shouldn't have
[1:24:35] gone that way pardon me what happened to
[1:24:40] the leadership of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:24:42] church that's what put the Holy Spirit
[1:24:44] out of every church denominations and
[1:24:46] everything else because they didn't want
[1:24:48] the word of God to have the preeminence
[1:24:51] and and just have his way have his way
[1:24:55] praise God Daniel answered in the
[1:24:57] presence of the king and said the secret
[1:25:00] which the king hath demanded cannot the
[1:25:02] wise men the astrologers The Magicians
[1:25:06] the soothsayers show unto the king but
[1:25:08] there is a God oh Hallelujah in heaven
[1:25:13] glory to God that revealeth
[1:25:16] Secrets oh let me tell you God can God
[1:25:19] can uh uh you know he can scour out the
[1:25:22] things that that he needs to get out of
[1:25:23] your life he can he can reveal and pull
[1:25:26] out those those things that he doesn't
[1:25:28] want you to be a part of remember
[1:25:30] Ephesians chapter 4 that God sent into
[1:25:33] the church all these gifts for what
[1:25:36] purpose to perfect we are in the
[1:25:39] perfecting time you wonder why is
[1:25:42] everything so on me why is everything
[1:25:45] picking on me why is this why why why
[1:25:48] why why is this happening why is that
[1:25:50] happening I'm being rejected over here
[1:25:51] I'm being rejected over there this one
[1:25:53] here doesn't want to talk to me this one
[1:25:55] here doesn't want to look to me this one
[1:25:56] here what is it it's constant
[1:25:59] distraction and the enemy is trying to
[1:26:01] defeat you and put you down and knock
[1:26:04] you down so that you can become
[1:26:06] absolutely useless in the body of
[1:26:11] Christ but there's a God that can
[1:26:14] go when you surrender when you say Lord
[1:26:17] I don't want it anymore I want to move
[1:26:20] on I want I want I want to I want to see

[1:48:57] surrendered my body as a vessel for the
[1:48:59] Holy Ghost I was chosen for all woman
[1:49:02] before me or after me to Bear the body

[1:49:09] exceptional he showed the wisdom of the
[1:49:11] ages even as a young child he astonished

[1:49:39] die the Son of
[1:49:47] God if you knew him like I know him you
[1:49:51] would know that Jesus this with no
[1:49:53] respect or persons everyone despised me
[1:49:57] because I collected taxes on behalf of
[1:50:00] the Romans but not Jesus he was
[1:50:03] different he said two words follow
[1:50:09] me those two simple words changed my
[1:50:13] life I immediately stopped tax
[1:50:17] collecting and follow Jesus everywhere

[1:50:23] speak in way that confuse the religious
[1:50:26] leaders but the children and common
[1:50:28] people they all understood him I grew to
[1:50:32] love his words so much that I had to
[1:50:36] write them
[1:50:38] down
[1:50:40] and how else would others learn him
[1:50:44] about him
[1:50:47] uh Healing The Sick feeding the
[1:50:51] multitudes breathing the the Deads I am
[1:50:54] Matthew I was B born from the line of
[1:50:59] David
[1:51:01] and King David I became a writer of the
[1:51:04] New Testament because I know Jesus and
[1:51:08] if you knew him like I know him you
[1:51:11] would know Jesus is a miracle
[1:51:16] [Applause]
[1:51:21] worker
[1:51:30] if you knew him like I know him you
[1:51:33] would know that Jesus can make you feel
[1:51:35] brand new I was despised full of Shame
[1:51:38] regret and guilt everyone condemned me
[1:51:40] instead I was that kind of woman they
[1:51:43] knew nothing about my past they didn't
[1:51:45] know how I became in possession of my
[1:51:47] precious alabaster box of perfume but
[1:51:50] Jesus he knew and I realized I need to
[1:51:53] give him my most precious possession I
[1:51:56] heard Jesus was diing with Simon and the
[1:51:58] Pharisee and I took my perfume with me
[1:52:01] and in that moment I saw him I suddenly
[1:52:03] dropped at his feet in tears I couldn't
[1:52:06] help myself I just kept crying and
[1:52:08] kissing his feet I was thinking about my
[1:52:11] life all the things I did wrong I cried
[1:52:14] so much that Jesus's feet were being
[1:52:16] washed clean with my tears I didn't have
[1:52:19] anything to dry them with so I used my
[1:52:21] hair
[1:52:24] I dried them kissed them and poured the
[1:52:26] precious Alabaster perfume on his feet
[1:52:28] oh the smell filled the entire house
[1:52:32] then the Pharisees criticized him so he
[1:52:34] told me they told him a parable of what
[1:52:37] it truly means to be forgiven and loved
[1:52:40] after that he looked at me and my sins
[1:52:42] were forgiven and he said I should go in
[1:52:44] peace I am Mary and I received
[1:52:47] redemption and forgiveness because I
[1:52:49] know Jesus and if you knew him like I
[1:52:52] know him you know that Jesus can forgive
[1:52:55] all your
[1:52:57] [Applause]
[1:53:07] sins if you knew him like I know him you
[1:53:10] would know that Jesus is the most
[1:53:13] compassionate friend I didn't understand
[1:53:15] at first just how important he was when
[1:53:19] we welcomed him into our home I was busy
[1:53:22] attending to our guests as I always do
[1:53:25] preparing the meal and serving
[1:53:28] everyone it took some time before I
[1:53:31] noticed that Mary wasn't helping at all
[1:53:34] she was with Jesus and the others I
[1:53:36] didn't want to interrupt anything but
[1:53:39] when I asked Jesus if he didn't mind
[1:53:42] that Mary left me to do all of the work
[1:53:45] he looked at me with such kindness in
[1:53:46] his eyes and explained that Mary had
[1:53:50] chosen the better thing it was then I
[1:53:54] realized how privileged we were that the
[1:53:57] Son of God was a guest in our
[1:54:00] home I had to treasure his every word
[1:54:03] later it was his word that gave me hope
[1:54:06] after our brother Lazarus died I knew
[1:54:09] the promise of
[1:54:10] Resurrection but what a blessing to see
[1:54:12] that the promise fulfilled not in the
[1:54:14] latter day but this day my brother was
[1:54:17] dead and in a tomb for 4 days but Jesus
[1:54:21] the resurrection and the life called
[1:54:23] Lazarus from the
[1:54:24] dead I am Martha I saw the glory of God
[1:54:29] because I know Jesus and if you knew him
[1:54:32] like I know him you would know that
[1:54:34] Jesus is the resurrection and the
[1:54:40] [Applause]
[1:54:43] life if you knew him like I know him you
[1:54:47] would know what it means to be truly
[1:54:50] loved Jesus love is unlike any other
[1:54:54] I've ever known being the son of Zeb I
[1:54:58] felt loved by my father and my brother
[1:55:01] James but in jesus' presence I felt an
[1:55:06] etal love it gave me the strength beyond
[1:55:10] my understanding the strength to see
[1:55:14] Jesus transfiguring before my eyes his
[1:55:19] his body completely transformed shining
[1:55:22] full of light I saw Moses I saw
[1:55:27] Elijah it's the love of Jesus that made
[1:55:32] me strong strong enough to stand and
[1:55:35] watch him be crucified I didn't
[1:55:38] know I didn't understand why he let the
[1:55:41] soldiers nail him to the Cross why
[1:55:44] didn't he fight back I am drun the
[1:55:47] Beloved disciple of Jesus and if you
[1:55:50] knew him like I know him
[1:55:53] you would know that Jesus became the
[1:55:56] Lamb of God because he loves the
[1:55:59] [Applause]
[1:56:04] world if you knew him like I know him
[1:56:07] you would recognized he was the most
[1:56:09] remarkable person I had seen him in my
[1:56:12] dream so I warned my husband have
[1:56:14] nothing to do with the death of this
[1:56:16] innocent man I told him but he didn't
[1:56:19] listen he was afraid of a rebellion he
[1:56:22] wanted to satisfy the bloodthirsty
[1:56:24] masses they demanded the crucifixion of
[1:56:27] Jesus my husband traded the life of a
[1:56:30] murderer for the life of an innocent
[1:56:33] man after his crucifixion we saw and
[1:56:36] heard of phenomenal things happening
[1:56:38] they were nothing short of
[1:56:40] Supernatural first the sun went down in
[1:56:42] the middle of the day there was Darkness
[1:56:45] over the Earth from the 6th until the
[1:56:47] 9th hour we could hardly believe it 3
[1:56:51] hours without sunlight
[1:56:53] later I heard at the same time the
[1:56:55] curtain on the Tabernacle was turned
[1:56:57] from top to bottom I know that Jews
[1:57:00] would not desecrate their Tabernacle in
[1:57:02] this way the curtain was over 30 ft High
[1:57:06] and 4 in thick it took over 300 priests
[1:57:09] to manage it no person could tear the
[1:57:12] curtain that size from top to bottom it
[1:57:15] had to be Supernatural I am Claudia
[1:57:18] pulia the wife of pontis pilot I Witness
[1:57:22] the supernatural because I met Jesus and
[1:57:24] if you knew him like I know him you
[1:57:27] would know that Jesus had Supernatural
[1:57:29] power he willingly gave his life when he
[1:57:32] was led to golgatha
[1:57:41] if you knew him like I know him you
[1:57:45] would have been amazed at the miracle of
[1:57:47] the fish we spent all night fishing
[1:57:50] without a single catch and then we met
[1:57:53] him in the
[1:57:54] morning the he told us to cast our Nets
[1:57:57] this the the boat was filled with fish
[1:58:02] so much that it began to
[1:58:05] sink this one encounter with him made
[1:58:08] all the difference how could I deny him
[1:58:11] why did I deny him I saw all his
[1:58:14] miracles right before my eyes I walked
[1:58:17] on water because of him and yet I denied
[1:58:21] him
[1:58:23] I never imagined I'd live to see this it
[1:58:26] was glorious if others weren't there I
[1:58:28] might have thought I was
[1:58:31] dreaming the most unimaginable moment of
[1:58:33] my life watching my Lord Ascend into
[1:58:36] heaven I am Peter I became a fisher of
[1:58:40] men because I know Jesus and if you knew
[1:58:43] him like I know him you'd know that
[1:58:45] Jesus is
[1:58:48] [Applause]
[1:58:51] Alive
[1:58:53] if you knew him like I know him you
[1:58:55] would know that it's worth leaving
[1:58:57] everything to to follow
[1:59:00] Jesus he saw me in the fields on his way
[1:59:03] to
[1:59:05] gal and he said follow me so I did
[1:59:09] something came alive in me I couldn't
[1:59:12] stop telling others about him at first
[1:59:15] nefo didn't believe
[1:59:17] me when I told him I found the Messiah
[1:59:20] but later he came and saw for
[1:59:24] himself he became a follower of Jesus
[1:59:28] after
[1:59:29] Jesus went up to heaven I continued
[1:59:32] telling others about him I traveled to
[1:59:35] mirror preaching the word then the angel
[1:59:37] of the Lord told me to go back towards
[1:59:40] Jerusalem there I met an Ethiopian he
[1:59:43] was reading a book of Isaiah but he told
[1:59:46] me he didn't understand who
[1:59:49] the pro prophet spoke about I helped
[1:59:54] that ethopian man understand the
[1:59:56] scripture he wanted he wanted to be bti
[2:00:00] immediately as he passed by the river I
[2:00:03] am Phillip my body was translated
[2:00:06] because I know Jesus and if you knew him
[2:00:10] like I know
[2:00:11] him you will know that Jesus the Messiah
[2:00:14] used my
[2:00:16] voice voice and hands and feet to spread
[2:00:20] the gospel
[2:00:23] [Applause]
[2:00:29] if you knew him like I know him you
[2:00:31] would know that Jesus lives in me like
[2:00:34] most people I heard about God but didn't
[2:00:37] think much of him I mean there's so many
[2:00:40] religions and different churches how do
[2:00:42] you know which is correct then a friend
[2:00:45] invited me to her birthday party I knew
[2:00:48] she was a Christian but I didn't mind I
[2:00:51] thought it was a a little strange when
[2:00:52] she'd always pray before eating driving
[2:00:55] or most things she did she always said
[2:00:57] she was praying for me I figured if she
[2:01:00] wants to pray all the time that's fine
[2:01:03] with me so I went to the party and after
[2:01:06] a while they were talking about the
[2:01:08] Bible discussing the one true God and
[2:01:11] Jesus's baptism someone mentioned that
[2:01:14] at creation when God made man he spoke
[2:01:17] to himself because man was inside him at
[2:01:21] that moment moment I felt like I was
[2:01:23] struck by lightning I understood that
[2:01:26] the creator of the universe created me
[2:01:28] to worship him this is my purpose to
[2:01:31] live for Jesus because he paid the price
[2:01:34] for my sin that I can have eternal life
[2:01:38] now I must die to myself I surrender all
[2:01:41] my desires to him I also get to tell my
[2:01:44] friends that there is joy peace hope and
[2:01:47] insurance in the middle of this dark
[2:01:49] world I am a believer
[2:01:52] I am a reflection of God because I know
[2:01:54] Jesus and if you knew him like I know
[2:01:57] him you would know that Jesus has the
[2:02:00] power to transform
[2:02:03] [Applause]
[2:02:10] you do you know him like I know
[2:02:20] him
[2:02:23] now we do have one more portion of our
[2:02:26] presentation for you it'll be a video so

[2:02:30] overhead and we trust the Lord will be a
