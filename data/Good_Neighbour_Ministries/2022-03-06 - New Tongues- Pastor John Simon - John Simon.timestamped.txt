[25:05] but then of course uh you know it's all
[25:09] this faith you know even preaching the
[25:11] word here is faith
[25:13] because um i have to believe
[25:17] that god will give me something else for
[25:20] next week
[25:22] you might say to me oh yeah the lord
[25:24] will give you some you know but it's not
[25:26] that easy when you are the one that has
[25:30] got to believe and wait
[25:32] until and if he speaks the last minute
[25:35] you are
[25:36] you just
[25:38] because you don't know what am i going
[25:40] to
[25:40] say but thank god
[25:43] uh he is great amen
[25:45] not to say that if i don't have anything
[25:47] to say thank god these wonderful
[25:50] instruments in the church uh i don't
[25:52] mean the guitars i mean like
[25:55] brother christian brother tim and
[25:57] brother danny and you know desmond and
[25:59] so on this other brothers here that god
[26:02] can use
[26:03] right but i'm glad to be here this
[26:06] morning
[26:07] and i'm glad to be able to say that lord
[26:10] has given me a message
[26:13] and the lord has given me something to
[26:16] say
[26:17] glory to god and when i say that
[26:21] these
[26:22] past
[26:23] months but say almost a year
[26:26] i'm not just preaching because i went
[26:28] and studied and searched the bible to
[26:30] find a sub topic
[26:32] it's the holy spirit coming and saying
[26:35] say this
[26:37] and so how am i going to say that that
[26:39] is so i don't see nothing there but no
[26:42] but as i wait
[26:44] then all of a sudden it starts to come
[26:48] and and so i can clearly say
[26:51] it's not just me
[26:54] i'm doing the talking
[26:55] but the message is not me it's the holy
[26:58] spirit
[26:59] himself
[27:01] talking to his own people
[27:03] so we give god the glory for that amen
[27:07] praise the lord
[27:08] and i am really thankful when i say it
[27:11] it's not just
[27:13] um
[27:14] you know like fraught on a beer some
[27:16] people just talk
[27:18] for talking sake but i'm saying i'm
[27:20] thankful to every one of you
[27:23] because every one of you i know went
[27:26] through and maybe still is
[27:28] uh
[27:29] going through ups and downs
[27:31] all kinds of trials and that is why the
[27:34] bible talks about overcomers
[27:38] right
[27:39] you know you don't realize but the other
[27:43] thing
[27:44] that you have overcome and the things
[27:45] you've gone through some people wouldn't
[27:47] be alive
[27:49] they can't even take it
[27:50] they're gone
[27:52] but you're still standing here
[27:54] no matter how much you might be shrieky
[27:56] tuttering this way that way you're still
[27:58] standing on the
[28:01] so we world god
[28:02] [Applause]
[28:05] amen god bless you god to see you god
[28:07] god bless you good to see you there
[28:09] brother amen god bless you brother
[28:12] praise the lord real good every one of
[28:14] you here in the house of the lord we're
[28:17] living in such great dangerous times
[28:20] scripture is being fulfilled and the
[28:22] things that are happening and about to
[28:24] happen
[28:25] is not of our concern
[28:28] in the sense we got to watch it but it's
[28:30] not about concern
[28:32] because the the foundations are being
[28:34] prepared for the great change
[28:37] we're going from trouble that we get in
[28:40] troubles to their
[28:42] tribulation
[28:44] right so we are moving the whole thing
[28:47] is moving
[28:48] uh but you don't get worried about
[28:51] what's happening around you
[28:53] because
[28:54] that brings you closer to your salvation
[28:58] than you suppose
[29:00] like paul said we are nero
[29:02] and as i used to sing years ago we're
[29:04] almost home
[29:06] we're almost home
[29:08] it's about to unfold and take place
[29:11] before us
[29:13] and all these questions that theologians
[29:15] try to answer well how's it going to
[29:17] happen are we going to fly up through
[29:18] the air
[29:19] is this going to happen is we going to
[29:21] suddenly disappear from the planes we
[29:23] are in the pilot god we don't care how
[29:27] it happens
[29:28] as long as we are in it and we are part
[29:30] of it
[29:32] we don't care how it happens
[29:34] and i give god praise and glory for all
[29:37] of that
[29:38] i thank god for the worship leader this
[29:40] morning
[29:47] you know by by him
[29:50] um
[29:51] the holy spirit was reassuring me
[29:54] um
[29:55] that what you what i give you to say
[29:58] that is what you have to say
[30:00] he said no of course he don't know that

[33:26] i will have to speak on them to be able
[33:28] to touch on what i have to say
[33:31] but they are not my emphasis
[33:34] the thing about this is
[33:37] in mark 16
[33:40] uh verse 17
[33:43] the lord is speaking and says they that
[33:46] believe

[35:17] these new terms or this new language
[35:22] that they're going to receive
[35:25] 800 years before
[35:28] this time the prophet isaiah if you'll
[35:31] turn to your bible chapter 28 isaiah 28
[35:35] verse and 9 19. you don't mind me
[35:39] starting slowly taking the time here but
[35:42] isaiah 28
[35:44] 9 to 13.

[36:08] whom shall we teach knowledge
[36:12] and whom shall we make

[37:14] line upon line here little and they were
[37:16] little that
[37:19] that they may go back

[37:37] and taken
[37:39] amen
[37:40] praise the lord jesus hallelujah i just
[37:43] want to um
[37:45] stop there
[37:47] now we first of all god is speaking
[37:50] actually in this scripture here to two
[37:52] groups
[37:55] and the first group
[37:56] that both groups are going to receive
[37:58] the same word
[38:00] here little there little line up online
[38:02] precept upon precept because it plainly
[38:05] says the word of the lord came through
[38:08] isaiah
[38:09] then it goes down into
[38:12] a next verse there and it says and the
[38:15] word of the lord
[38:17] came
[38:18] and it came to this group
[38:21] the first group he said when the word of
[38:24] the lord comes to them it will cause
[38:26] them to
[38:27] have knowledge
[38:30] it will cause them to understand
[38:32] doctrine
[38:35] and it will be a time of refreshing
[38:38] uh upon them
[38:40] and
[38:41] it will bring them into the believer's
[38:44] rest versus a time of refreshing
[38:49] and a time when they're gonna
[38:52] enter into
[38:54] the believer's rest
[38:56] that's the first group the second group
[38:59] the same word
[39:02] same message
[39:04] came unto them
[39:06] but
[39:08] what is that supposed to cause
[39:11] we know what it caused and what happened
[39:13] with the first group that received it
[39:15] but what's it supposed to happen or
[39:17] cause
[39:18] in the second group
[39:20] cause some to go back
[39:24] others to fall backward
[39:27] in other words some to go back leave the
[39:29] message complete
[39:31] leave the word complete they just go
[39:33] back walk away from it don't know it
[39:37] others to pull backwards they pull back
[39:40] so they backslide then it says
[39:43] and some to be broken
[39:47] while yet others
[39:50] will be snared which the word snare
[39:53] means trapped
[39:55] they will be trapped and taken away amen
[39:59] praise the lord
[40:01] well
[40:02] one prophet said that
[40:05] 800 years before
[40:08] and then
[40:09] here is
[40:10] another prophet 2 800 years
[40:15] later this prophet
[40:17] of the 20th century
[40:20] amen
[40:22] and in the unveiling of god which i have
[40:28] used that
[40:30] quotation to many of you
[40:33] my subject this morning
[40:36] i trust god will reveal this
[40:39] and it each time
[40:40] if you take the tapes and listen
[40:43] that you
[40:45] may have a spiritual understanding
[40:48] of what god has been trying to get over
[40:52] to his church
[40:54] while
[40:56] without him saying it right out
[41:00] see
[41:01] it's it's a thing it's something
[41:05] we
[41:06] sometimes we have to say things
[41:09] in such a way
[41:11] that it might send
[41:13] the crowd down
[41:16] that it might bring some
[41:19] to go out
[41:22] and
[41:23] others to just leave
[41:28] and others
[41:30] to ponder
[41:32] over
[41:34] but that
[41:35] is done purposely
[41:39] and it must be done that way
[41:42] then it might be said some of you will
[41:44] say you brother bran you mean god would
[41:48] purposely do a thing like that
[41:51] he certainly did
[41:54] and he does it yet now
[41:58] he still is doing it right now so
[42:03] i'm showing you the one prophet said the
[42:05] same thing
[42:07] exactly some to fall back some to go out
[42:10] you know and so it's right there in
[42:12] isaiah and here comes this prophet 28
[42:15] 200 years later
[42:18] and he is saying the same thing to the
[42:20] generation
[42:22] that we
[42:23] are in
[42:25] praise god
[42:27] so i thank god
[42:29] for this prophet that he sent us
[42:33] who spoke to us nothing but the truth
[42:38] amen
[42:39] praise god
[42:41] now
[42:43] we're going to the day of pentecost acts
[42:45] chapter 2 verse 4.
[42:48] now when we come to
[42:51] uh the day of pentecost which was fully
[42:55] come
[42:57] they of course left
[43:00] uh and went to the upper room waiting on
[43:02] the promise of the holy spirit
[43:05] because it was promised by isaiah that
[43:08] stammering lives with another town where
[43:10] like he'll pour out his spirit upon his
[43:12] people it'll be a time of refreshing
[43:15] it'll be this little give knowledge and
[43:17] wisdom praise god hallelujah god
[43:20] promised it
[43:22] amen
[43:23] and jesus said when if you believe
[43:26] you're a true believer you will speak
[43:29] with new tongues
[43:31] so when they went up on the day of
[43:34] pentecost
[43:36] they the holy ghost came upon them and
[43:40] broke he was broke himself up into
[43:43] little pieces
[43:45] and so that he couldn't fill them
[43:48] and fill them with himself
[43:52] god in the believers
[43:55] and there they were
[43:57] and the bible said they were filled with
[43:59] the holy ghost
[44:01] and they began to speak
[44:05] with other towns
[44:07] as the spirit gave them utterance
[44:11] the spirit of god
[44:13] uttering those words through them
[44:16] to the generation
[44:18] that they were in
[44:20] and the bible
[44:22] tells you clearly
[44:24] that those men heard them speaking in
[44:27] dance
[44:28] so we believe in speaking in dance
[44:32] i believe in speaking in towns
[44:35] i thank god that he sent the holy spirit
[44:39] but you see
[44:40] pentecost made their mistake right there
[44:45] because they believe they're speaking in
[44:47] times as a gibber and a jabber and
[44:50] as long as they are coming forth with
[44:52] some strange tongue and language they
[44:55] are speaking in towns
[44:57] but that's not what god was talking
[44:59] about
[45:01] jesus said they shall speak with new
[45:04] tongues
[45:05] hallelujah
[45:07] new tongues they're going to speak with
[45:09] praise god
[45:11] i want you to see her clearly my friends
[45:15] here in the bible
[45:17] that
[45:18] this time that they were using the
[45:21] disciples i mean
[45:23] that all the men as brother branham has
[45:26] said he said where pentecost made their
[45:29] mistake they put the emphasis on the
[45:31] young speaking and not upon the hearing
[45:35] for we heard them speak with other towns
[45:40] or not all these men galileans
[45:43] but how
[45:45] they're speaking galileans
[45:48] which we all know
[45:50] but yet we can hear them in our own
[45:53] language
[45:55] that was the supernatural taking place
[45:59] that was the holy spirit on the scene
[46:03] making himself known
[46:05] and they were all amazed
[46:08] they were in
[46:09] wonder at what was going on
[46:12] so
[46:13] but pentecost today has it that
[46:16] everybody gets in the spirit
[46:18] and everybody begins to jabber and
[46:21] jibber and say something and it becomes
[46:24] one chaos
[46:26] and confusion everywhere
[46:29] and even paul said if you're speaking in
[46:31] tongues like that
[46:33] uh will one come in your midst won't it
[46:36] be confusion
[46:37] they can't understand they don't know
[46:39] what you are saying
[46:41] whatever
[46:42] but here in the bible and if you have
[46:45] the time listen to brother brandon's
[46:47] message on the debate the debate on
[46:50] tongues
[46:52] where he said see
[46:55] and and there's where some theologians
[46:56] were questioning him on this topic and
[47:00] he was answering them
[47:02] and they couldn't answer him when he
[47:03] came out and said listen it's on the
[47:06] hearing
[47:07] they heard them speak with tongues
[47:11] praise god because they were anointed
[47:14] with the word
[47:16] with the holy spirit in them
[47:19] so when they were listening
[47:21] they could know that these men were
[47:24] speaking
[47:25] in a in a language that i already know
[47:30] it wasn't a language they didn't know
[47:32] but the language they already know
[47:35] but yet when they were speaking we can
[47:39] hear what they are saying is is
[47:41] supernatural it's the wonderful works of
[47:43] god
[47:44] it's the wonders of the living god and
[47:47] they begin to praise and honor god
[47:49] hallelujah
[47:50] they want to know if they were drunk but
[47:52] they were not drunk with natural wine
[47:55] they were drunk with the holy ghost
[47:58] and they were bringing the word of god
[48:00] hallelujah amen
[48:02] when they all spoke
[48:05] uh you know as brother branham asked
[48:08] this gentleman and the gentleman in
[48:09] particular he said when you received the
[48:12] holy ghost did you speak with towns the
[48:15] man said yes
[48:17] he says and when you spoke in tongues
[48:19] that that all the people understand you
[48:23] he says no because i i was speaking in
[48:26] tongues he said well you don't have the
[48:29] original pentecost
[48:31] you weren't really baptized with the
[48:33] holy ghost
[48:34] he says because back in the bible there
[48:37] when they spoke
[48:39] all the people heard
[48:41] and the bible wanted you to be sure that
[48:44] the whole world could understand what
[48:46] they were saying because it says greek
[48:49] people from mesopotamia cerrini here
[48:52] there it mentions the different groups
[48:54] so you might know it's not a mistake
[48:56] everybody heard what they were saying
[49:00] everybody recognized what they were
[49:03] saying
[49:04] because it was the holy ghost speaking
[49:06] through them and using them for the
[49:08] glory of god hallelujah amen that's my
[49:12] friends is exactly what it was amen so
[49:18] the new terms is not like some uh other
[49:22] natural language you know we got
[49:24] languages dialects all around the world
[49:26] some we don't even know yet some in the
[49:29] in the woods we haven't even discovered
[49:30] some of those people speaking dialects
[49:33] they're out there but this new tongue
[49:35] that jesus promised is not some new
[49:38] language
[49:40] it's not some new dialect
[49:42] that we are all gonna speak that new
[49:46] dialect whatsoever hallelujah
[49:49] but
[49:50] when they were speaking
[49:52] that new tongue
[49:55] everybody knew it was about the
[49:57] wonderful works of god
[50:00] i want to follow this up by the fact
[50:02] brother branham used to turn he says did
[50:05] you notice
[50:07] that when jesus came
[50:10] and he could have just told them openly
[50:13] and plainly who he was and what this is
[50:15] and what that is
[50:17] but he says no
[50:20] but jesus
[50:22] spoke in parables
[50:24] through his entire ministry
[50:27] and what i am saying now if you follow
[50:29] up unveiling of god just after he said
[50:32] what he said that these things are said
[50:35] like that god deliberately put it that
[50:37] way it's not just said openly but it's
[50:41] said in such a way
[50:43] right
[50:44] that only a certain set of people will
[50:46] be able to pick it up
[50:48] right
[50:49] so
[50:51] he said so i i speak that way and it's
[50:54] set that way purposely that way and even
[50:57] the lord jesus
[50:59] when he was on the scene he said he
[51:02] spoke in parables
[51:04] to the people and all they heard was
[51:07] parables
[51:08] amen
[51:09] now listen
[51:11] hear ye him
[51:13] there is no contradiction in god's word
[51:17] for it is written
[51:19] entirely in parables
[51:22] and
[51:24] it's purposely done that way
[51:29] see
[51:30] to confuse
[51:32] the wise the prudent
[51:35] saw that god may reveal it to them babes
[51:39] and sucklings
[51:41] that would learn
[51:44] god wrote the entire thing in riddles
[51:48] he wrote it in parables
[51:51] so that he could hide it see
[51:54] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[51:58] and reveal it in other words to his
[52:00] children
[52:01] to babes such as would learn
[52:05] amen
[52:07] you see
[52:09] because you don't know it it's not like
[52:12] going and reading a newspaper
[52:17] it is a spiritual revelation
[52:21] and it's only revealed to them
[52:24] who are interested
[52:27] in learning it
[52:29] and you will never learn that by school
[52:34] you'll never learn that by theology
[52:38] it's got to be known by revelation
[52:42] because the entire bible the entire plan
[52:45] of god
[52:46] everything in this bible even your
[52:49] salvation is based upon the revelation
[52:53] of jesus christ
[52:55] hallelujah praise god amen oh my friends
[53:01] what a day what an hour
[53:04] smilian church age
[53:07] who
[53:08] who has known the mind of god
[53:11] that
[53:12] they might instruct him
[53:15] but paul said
[53:18] but you have the mind of christ
[53:20] who have known the mind of god
[53:23] but you have the mind of christ
[53:25] you understand praise god
[53:29] who has the mind of christ
[53:31] but you have the mind of christ paul
[53:34] says
[53:36] matthew 13 13 to 16
[53:39] therefore
[53:40] speak eye to them in bibles
[53:44] because they're seeing they see not
[53:47] and hearing they hear not
[53:49] neither do they understand
[53:52] and in them is fulfill the prophecy of
[53:55] isaias
[53:57] which said by hearing you shall hear
[54:01] and shall not understand you're going to
[54:04] hear the same thing but you're not
[54:05] understanding
[54:07] is that right
[54:09] you're hearing the same thing but you're
[54:12] not understanding
[54:13] and seeing you shall see
[54:16] and yet not perceive
[54:19] for this people's heart is what's gross
[54:24] and their ears are dull
[54:26] of hearing
[54:29] and their eyes have clothes lest at any
[54:31] time they should see with their eyes
[54:34] and hear with ears
[54:36] and should understand with their heart
[54:39] and should be converted
[54:41] and i would heal them
[54:43] but blessed are your eyes
[54:47] blessed are your ears
[54:49] for they hear
[54:51] blessed are your eyes for you see
[54:54] amen smyrna church praise god brothers

[55:00] living in this hour hallelujah amen oh
[55:04] marvelous listen to the word of the
[55:08] living god
[55:09] now there is no devil
[55:11] not church not theologian that all can
[55:16] overstep the boundaries
[55:18] of the proof
[55:20] and abstract of god
[55:23] in the life of an individual
[55:25] because the baptism of the holocaust
[55:30] has recognized you in jesus christ and
[55:34] raise you up in him
[55:37] and now you can see the word of god for
[55:40] the hour and for your day hallelujah

[56:25] it changes your opinions
[56:29] changes all them ideas and notions that
[56:33] you used to have
[56:35] all god why because the baptism the holy
[56:39] ghost come and recognize you woke up the
[56:41] seed of god in you amen it begins to set
[56:45] your affection
[56:47] on the things which are above
[56:50] all them smoking drinking gambling
[56:52] things you used to do is dead because
[56:55] what you've been raised up and then
[56:58] things are now beneath you amen
[57:00] you are quickened
[57:03] quickened by the power of god and it it
[57:06] begins to bring your body your entire
[57:09] being listen this into a rapturing
[57:13] condition
[57:15] get your ready for the rapture
[57:18] take you out to here
[57:20] notice
[57:22] the petty cost of people
[57:25] when the real ones when the pentecostal
[57:28] people on the day of pentecost received
[57:31] their title deed from god you know what
[57:35] it began to do it come to them
[57:39] listen close again and it glorified
[57:44] their souls
[57:46] not your spirit not anointing on your
[57:49] body to make you jibber jabber and jump
[57:51] around
[57:52] it anointed us glorify their soul
[57:56] hallelujah in other words your soul
[57:59] start to go into a transfiguration
[58:02] it begins to change
[58:05] it begins to come to a place where god
[58:07] can rapture it out of here
[58:10] hallelujah oh my i'm not drifting from
[58:14] my original subject this is all part of
[58:16] it give god the glory amen hallelujah oh
[58:20] my see and so
[58:23] when it come and began to glorify their
[58:25] souls they screamed
[58:29] they saw tongues of fire separated and
[58:32] coming upon each of them
[58:35] it's so quick in their body
[58:38] until they couldn't even speak
[58:40] earthly language like that anymore
[58:44] it quickened their body
[58:46] until they began to speak a heavenly
[58:49] language
[58:50] that began to speak
[58:52] a heavenly language
[58:54] new tongue
[58:56] new tongue they were given a new town
[58:59] speaking a heavenly language i'm guided
[59:02] by the holy ghost amen
[59:04] praise god you see that it has to be
[59:08] that way for to speak that heavenly
[59:11] language because
[59:14] of the place where they are going
[59:16] to so they got to start speaking that
[59:20] language right here
[59:22] so
[59:23] they're speaking to the place where
[59:25] they're going to
[59:26] so the quickening power had to come and
[59:29] shake their mortal bodies
[59:32] till their entire mortal language was
[59:36] just taken from them
[59:38] transfigured transformed
[59:42] amen into an immortal language
[59:45] when the quickening part comes changes
[59:48] that to something
[59:50] to somewhere where they belong
[59:54] for if the same spear that raised christ
[59:57] from the dead dwells you
[1:00:00] he shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:00:04] you'll find that in the easter seal amen
[1:00:07] praise god forevermore i give him glory
[1:00:11] for his word this morning amen glory to
[1:00:14] god so brothers what do you see with the
[1:00:17] modern pentecostal here today gibbering
[1:00:20] jabbering speaking in all manner of
[1:00:22] towns what what what to find out with
[1:00:24] them it's like when israel was in the
[1:00:27] land
[1:00:28] and uh
[1:00:30] they wanted to come in
[1:00:32] and be with israel
[1:00:34] uh you know and they said look uh
[1:00:37] we are warning you they sent some men in
[1:00:40] amongst them and israel said well
[1:00:44] for me to know if you're an israelite we
[1:00:46] want you to speak
[1:00:49] speak our language
[1:00:51] they give them a word test
[1:00:53] and
[1:00:54] as much as they tried to pronounce the
[1:00:56] word shibale
[1:00:57] they can't say it
[1:01:00] they can't say
[1:01:02] you see they caught in the word test
[1:01:04] because every time they try to pronounce
[1:01:06] the word they can't pronounce it
[1:01:07] correctly
[1:01:09] oh my and so israel said no you are not
[1:01:12] a real jew you're not a real believer at
[1:01:14] all because you don't have the word amen
[1:01:18] see and they were able to
[1:01:20] recognize them praise god of course you
[1:01:23] know tongues
[1:01:25] and in tongues plus interpretation is
[1:01:28] prophecy
[1:01:29] right tongues plus
[1:01:31] interpretation is equal to prophecy
[1:01:35] praise god hallelujah uh okay let me
[1:01:38] continue on here praise god hallelujah
[1:01:41] uh uh how wonderful it is my brothers to
[1:01:44] see how that god anointed the language
[1:01:48] that they already had and transformed it
[1:01:52] and transfigured it until that language
[1:01:54] become a heavenly language
[1:01:56] preparing them for the place the prophet
[1:01:58] said they're going to
[1:02:00] praise god wonderful to know that that
[1:02:03] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:02:06] forever hallelujah now you heard the
[1:02:08] term
[1:02:10] of uh
[1:02:12] the tongues of men and of angels is that
[1:02:14] right
[1:02:15] amen even paul used that term uh the
[1:02:18] tongue of men and of angels
[1:02:20] but this was not the tongue isaiah was
[1:02:23] speaking of
[1:02:24] right at all whatsoever he said with
[1:02:28] some are going to speak they're going to
[1:02:29] speak with stammering lips
[1:02:31] but he says and another tongue you know
[1:02:34] whenever you see that word and it's a
[1:02:36] conjunction
[1:02:37] it tells you that one thing is not the
[1:02:39] same thing
[1:02:41] you know the one is following the other
[1:02:43] he says a stammering lips and another
[1:02:46] tongue
[1:02:47] jesus come and says then that belief
[1:02:50] shall speak
[1:02:51] with new tongues
[1:02:53] amen praise the lord hallelujah now we
[1:02:57] find out
[1:02:59] that
[1:03:00] on the day of pentecost
[1:03:02] these men spoke
[1:03:04] with towns there is no doubt about it
[1:03:07] there's awkward towns
[1:03:09] but how could it be speaking in towns
[1:03:12] when they were speaking galilean
[1:03:16] they were talking their own language
[1:03:18] just like you and me we talk in english
[1:03:20] isn't that right
[1:03:21] but under the anointing while they were
[1:03:23] talking english let me use the word
[1:03:25] english so you understand war
[1:03:28] yet all the people are wrong could hear
[1:03:30] them

[1:04:10] quickly no it's all right oh no no he
[1:04:14] can come up and he can speak it quickly

[1:04:27] don't have to go close all right go
[1:04:29] ahead
[1:04:30] i and pastor salmon went to ghana you

[1:04:36] and i and him was incar
[1:04:40] and there was a brother that i know
[1:04:42] again
[1:04:43] even brad desmond philip know him his
[1:04:46] name is alex
[1:04:48] we're talking in a ashanti language my
[1:04:51] language in ghana but someone was
[1:04:54] sitting it was in the car he was sitting
[1:04:56] in the front the driver driving me and
[1:04:59] the brother was i was sitting on the
[1:05:01] driver back unless was sitting in the
[1:05:04] middle
[1:05:05] and all of a sudden we're talking in our
[1:05:09] language
[1:05:11] and
[1:05:12] the language we were talking the brother
[1:05:14] asked me
[1:05:16] is pastor simon a ghanaian i says no
[1:05:20] he's not a ghanaian we're speaking
[1:05:22] ashanti language which is my language
[1:05:26] and we keep on talking talking
[1:05:29] then all of a sudden pasta salmon just
[1:05:32] turned his head
[1:05:34] and says oh brothers
[1:05:37] you are saying this you are saying this
[1:05:39] you are saying this you are saying this
[1:05:42] and the brother says oh

[1:05:45] you told me
[1:05:47] the pastor does your pastor doesn't it's
[1:05:50] not a ghanaian
[1:05:51] and he doesn't understand ghana the
[1:05:54] ashanti language how is it that he's
[1:05:56] interpreting the language to us
[1:06:00] and pastor salman just says
[1:06:03] but you said you believe the holy ghost
[1:06:08] i passed someone don't know nothing
[1:06:11] but the holy ghost know all the
[1:06:12] languages
[1:06:14] he wrote their language
[1:06:16] i saw it i i think i have told some of
[1:06:20] you
[1:06:20] some of you believers have said this to
[1:06:23] you
[1:06:24] it was so direct
[1:06:26] my goodness so that's what
[1:06:29] pasta is telling it's real i saw it
[1:06:32] praise the lord
[1:06:33] [Applause]
[1:06:38] i just want you to
[1:06:40] understand
[1:06:43] that on the day of pentecost all of them
[1:06:45] were speaking together
[1:06:48] and all of the people heard them
[1:06:52] and they were speaking
[1:06:54] galilean
[1:06:56] are not all these galilean
[1:07:00] but they were hearing them in whatever
[1:07:03] country language town or whatever they
[1:07:06] came from they were hearing it
[1:07:09] praise god
[1:07:10] so just to pause
[1:07:12] they were talking and i wasn't paying
[1:07:15] any attention they were in the car i
[1:07:17] wasn't paying any attention whatsoever
[1:07:19] because i don't understand what they're
[1:07:20] talking but all of a sudden then
[1:07:24] it's
[1:07:25] just like if you're talking to me in
[1:07:26] english
[1:07:28] i i started understanding i thought they
[1:07:31] had changed
[1:07:32] from their
[1:07:34] language
[1:07:35] to english so that's why i could hear
[1:07:38] them talking i didn't even know anything
[1:07:41] supernatural what's going on
[1:07:43] so i'm listening to them while they're
[1:07:45] talking talking talking so that's why i
[1:07:47] naturally came out i didn't come out
[1:07:49] like i had a revelation i just naturally
[1:07:51] say oh you brothers were talking about
[1:07:53] this and saying that and that's when
[1:07:55] they got shot and then we realized that
[1:07:58] something took place you see but it's
[1:08:01] real
[1:08:03] because friends
[1:08:05] to prove it
[1:08:07] peter got up
[1:08:09] in acts chapter 2 verse 38
[1:08:12] man and bread went when they asked him
[1:08:15] what shall we do to be saved
[1:08:18] hallelujah
[1:08:19] and he began to answer them
[1:08:22] tell him repent be baptized in the name
[1:08:24] of jesus christ the point here is now
[1:08:28] god bring it down to one man speaking
[1:08:32] and yet when the one man was speaking
[1:08:34] under this anointing of the new tongues
[1:08:38] all of them heard him
[1:08:40] everyone under the sun heard the words
[1:08:44] that peter stopped
[1:08:46] because they were speaking under that
[1:08:49] anointing
[1:08:50] oh thank god did they have some other
[1:08:53] strange language that they had was here
[1:08:56] what what he's gonna stand there and
[1:08:58] speak in a hundred languages for each
[1:09:00] group to hear him no
[1:09:02] god is his own interpreter
[1:09:04] [Music]
[1:09:07] god is his own interpreter praise god
[1:09:10] and that is why this was the fulfillment
[1:09:12] of what jesus was talking about
[1:09:15] when he says them not believe
[1:09:17] they shall speak with new towns
[1:09:21] hallelujah and when they spoke without
[1:09:24] new towns these people heard and
[1:09:27] understood what peter was saying
[1:09:30] amen
[1:09:32] but bless god brothers
[1:09:35] the pentecostals are very proud that
[1:09:37] they speak in
[1:09:39] other tongues
[1:09:41] and they do all these things
[1:09:43] but this is really not what paul
[1:09:46] was saying to them
[1:09:50] first corinthians 13
[1:09:54] though
[1:09:55] i speak
[1:09:57] in the tongues of
[1:10:00] men and of angels
[1:10:04] but you have not the capstone revelation
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:09] you don't have charity
[1:10:12] it profits you nothing
[1:10:15] no matter how much you study no matter
[1:10:17] how much you go and do this or do that
[1:10:20] and you don't have the revelation of
[1:10:22] this word
[1:10:24] to cap off your entire life
[1:10:26] he says what you become
[1:10:28] a sounding brass
[1:10:30] and a tickling symbol oh yeah you can
[1:10:33] preach oh yeah you can testify oh you
[1:10:35] can sing oh you can do all these things
[1:10:37] you can carry on everything else like
[1:10:39] that you can make all the sounds and
[1:10:42] everything else but it doesn't have the
[1:10:44] core of the revelation of the holy
[1:10:48] spirit in the middle of it my brothers
[1:10:50] and sisters you are a sounding brass a
[1:10:53] tickling symbol and you are empty of the
[1:10:56] word of god
[1:10:58] empty of the word of god hallelujah
[1:11:01] praise god forevermore now
[1:11:05] let me bring it in a way practically let
[1:11:07] me just say it briefly in a practical
[1:11:09] way
[1:11:11] you know right now i didn't even know if
[1:11:13] he brought my attention to it
[1:11:15] and some of us might have alluded to it
[1:11:18] you know with the real genuine
[1:11:20] revelation of the message
[1:11:22] a bunch of us get together or two of us
[1:11:25] talking it
[1:11:26] and you know somebody else will be right
[1:11:28] there listening to the whole thing
[1:11:30] what are they talking about
[1:11:33] amen
[1:11:34] what is going on
[1:11:36] what is this
[1:11:38] amen
[1:11:39] but it's not
[1:11:40] that they don't understand what you're
[1:11:42] saying naturally
[1:11:45] we know you're gathering we know you're
[1:11:47] talking english we we know you're the
[1:11:49] same thing but but but what is it we're
[1:11:52] hearing it's what they're hearing now
[1:11:55] this what we're hearing is different i
[1:11:58] never heard anything like this before
[1:12:00] you're speaking the new term
[1:12:04] you didn't even know it but you were
[1:12:06] speaking the new town god has given you
[1:12:09] a new language this message was actually
[1:12:11] training you and giving you a new
[1:12:13] language for the place that you're going
[1:12:21] all unconsciously done
[1:12:24] because the holy spirit himself
[1:12:27] is the one doing it interpreting the
[1:12:29] word to your heart to your life to your
[1:12:31] entire being
[1:12:33] praise god you don't have to think about
[1:12:36] it you don't have to interpret nothing
[1:12:38] you don't have to learn nothing because
[1:12:40] you are under the anointing of the holy
[1:12:43] spirit
[1:12:44] you have ever stood by and watched two
[1:12:46] brothers talking this message and while
[1:12:49] they are fellowshipping on a message you
[1:12:51] can sense when the anointing strike
[1:12:53] their soul and the word starts pouring
[1:12:56] out of them
[1:12:58] you might as well be listening to
[1:12:59] another language or
[1:13:01] another tongue because it just carries
[1:13:04] you away you're caught up
[1:13:06] amen under the anointing of this new
[1:13:09] tongue of the holy spirit upon your
[1:13:11] heart and upon your life amen praise god
[1:13:15] hallelujah amen and you have not charity
[1:13:20] you're nothing but a
[1:13:22] a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol
[1:13:26] because you don't have the revealed word
[1:13:29] all you're producing is empty religious
[1:13:32] songs
[1:13:34] that's all you're producing how many of
[1:13:37] you
[1:13:38] i've come it's a pastor i don't know i
[1:13:41] was in this service i was in this church
[1:13:45] it is not that is a wonderful brother
[1:13:47] wonderful sisters wonderful preaching
[1:13:50] wonderful anointing but you know
[1:13:53] it's just something
[1:13:55] i couldn't feel something there in my
[1:13:58] soul it couldn't feed me i i wasn't
[1:14:01] gathering anything why good people but
[1:14:04] something grass and tickling simple amen
[1:14:08] empty of revelation
[1:14:10] empty religious sounds
[1:14:13] amen
[1:14:14] hallelujah but to us
[1:14:17] it brings to us a time of refreshing
[1:14:20] we feel refreshed
[1:14:22] when we got under the influence of the
[1:14:24] world
[1:14:26] we get more understanding
[1:14:28] we understand the doctrine of the word
[1:14:31] of god hallelujah amen praise god line
[1:14:35] up online line upon land praise god you
[1:14:39] begin to get the new towns of the elect
[1:14:42] you get the new tongue of the bride

[1:15:09] language

[1:15:12] and even you yourself have said to me
[1:15:15] many times but i don't understand i am
[1:15:18] telling them it's so plain
[1:15:20] but they can't see
[1:15:22] they can't understand

[1:15:33] heavenly language under the holy spirit
[1:15:36] amen praise god amen hallelujah so then

[1:15:49] voice praise god and what is it they
[1:15:52] understand that this message is a shout
[1:15:56] it's a it's a crime it's a call to the
[1:15:58] rapture amen because this voice is
[1:16:01] calling you for the rapture praise god
[1:16:04] hallelujah amen
[1:16:06] now he says
[1:16:10] my lord
[1:16:11] you see lord be mortal someday
[1:16:14] this great thing that we're speaking of
[1:16:18] you see we'll see it
[1:16:20] for when jesus died on a cross
[1:16:23] he was forsaken by man
[1:16:26] and when he did do you realize that on
[1:16:30] the cross he spoke in another language
[1:16:34] do you understand hallelujah in other
[1:16:36] words he spoke in tongues
[1:16:38] amen that when his locks were baited
[1:16:42] down with blood and he cried out amen
[1:16:45] when he cried out like that you see it
[1:16:49] began to move up through them rest of
[1:16:52] seeds down here amen right on up
[1:16:56] out the same thing coming to them and it
[1:17:00] always come through the blood

[1:17:08] in the word amen and the spirit comes
[1:17:11] out of the word for the life is in the
[1:17:13] blood amen praise god hallelujah and
[1:17:17] when he cried there from calvary amen he
[1:17:21] said that that cry
[1:17:23] went and affected all them seeds that
[1:17:26] were there praise god to this day and
[1:17:29] this hour the seeds of god have been
[1:17:32] affected by the cry of the holy spirit
[1:17:35] when he spoke in another language there
[1:17:39] that i will restore amen praise god
[1:17:43] hallelujah
[1:17:44] listen he's not finished he speaks here
[1:17:47] in faith that the faith that was once
[1:17:49] delivered to the saints do you
[1:17:51] understand what i am saying
[1:17:53] do you understand in type that adam did
[1:17:57] not understand the language of that lamb
[1:18:00] that
[1:18:01] abel slew
[1:18:04] adam they didn't understand when the
[1:18:05] lamb was bleeding
[1:18:07] he said they did not understand
[1:18:10] what was it he
[1:18:13] the lamb was speaking in another
[1:18:16] language
[1:18:18] jesus christ died
[1:18:20] speaking
[1:18:21] in another language
[1:18:23] see
[1:18:24] oh if you understand that's perfect that
[1:18:28] is an unbelievable type hallelujah but
[1:18:32] there he was speaking
[1:18:35] in another language praise god
[1:18:38] oh my oh my think of it think of it oh
[1:18:44] when this message goes forth
[1:18:47] it corrects everything around it
[1:18:50] and when jesus was there
[1:18:53] when all on the outside
[1:18:55] outside a priest on that outside inside
[1:18:59] was making fun of him
[1:19:02] and everything
[1:19:03] he was possessed with a power
[1:19:07] and possessed with that power he spoke
[1:19:10] in another language
[1:19:12] and said out into the spirit world
[1:19:16] speaking out there
[1:19:18] it called back even the spirit of a dead
[1:19:22] girl back to life
[1:19:24] because now that power was upon him
[1:19:27] praise god i'm telling you it's on you
[1:19:29] and me and every one of us now
[1:19:32] anything could happen as god wills
[1:19:35] when god wills
[1:19:37] you know it's not you have any power of
[1:19:39] yourself can do anything but you are
[1:19:42] under the influence and the power of the
[1:19:44] holy spirit just as much of the apostles
[1:19:47] that were back there even more in this
[1:19:50] day and in this hour you are walking in
[1:19:53] a absolute effortless christianity
[1:19:56] unconscious godliness the holy spirit
[1:19:59] able to flow through your life and to
[1:20:02] fulfill his divine will for the glory of
[1:20:04] god
[1:20:06] [Music]
[1:20:08] hallelujah
[1:20:09] you understand when he was on the cross
[1:20:14] the seeds

[1:20:19] yes he knew me
[1:20:20] oh yes he knew me praise god he knew me
[1:20:25] brother sister when he cried out
[1:20:31] the bible is he spoke in tongues the
[1:20:33] prophet said he spoke another language
[1:20:36] and it affected all them seeds right
[1:20:39] down to this time oh glory of god
[1:20:42] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:20:44] lord
[1:20:46] amen glory to god
[1:20:49] see
[1:20:51] one group speaking in tongues and the
[1:20:54] other one having the new tongue
[1:20:58] but you see that those tongues
[1:21:03] was issued under the head of gold
[1:21:07] and it was
[1:21:08] it came in
[1:21:10] by image worship
[1:21:14] forced
[1:21:15] to it
[1:21:16] and ended up in a supernatural hand
[1:21:20] writing on the wall
[1:21:23] and it was writing in another
[1:21:26] language see
[1:21:29] and it was in a supernatural language
[1:21:32] and even though that condemnation or
[1:21:35] judgment was written
[1:21:37] it took
[1:21:39] someone
[1:21:41] with supernatural understanding
[1:21:43] that could understand it
[1:21:46] to be able to interpret it then he says
[1:21:48] amen
[1:21:50] you see friends
[1:21:53] the gentile kingdoms issued in on image
[1:21:57] worship
[1:21:59] see
[1:22:00] and it will go out the same way
[1:22:03] by supernatural works supernatural
[1:22:06] interpretation
[1:22:07] all going together working off the
[1:22:10] supernatural amen that's the way it is
[1:22:14] hallelujah oh praise god see
[1:22:18] when god's people got together back
[1:22:20] there in the book of acts
[1:22:22] he says
[1:22:23] there came a song from heaven like a
[1:22:25] mighty rushing wind that filled a place
[1:22:28] where they were sitting out in the
[1:22:30] streets they went speaking
[1:22:33] in
[1:22:34] this language god made a preacher out of
[1:22:38] every one of them
[1:22:40] see
[1:22:40] when they went out
[1:22:42] they preached in a language
[1:22:45] but in the language that every man could
[1:22:50] hear them

[1:23:06] people expect the powerful things of god
[1:23:09] to be explosive on boom
[1:23:12] no
[1:23:12] but god is hides in simplicity
[1:23:16] he reveals himself in the same
[1:23:19] that's why if you're not watching it'll
[1:23:21] go right by you

[1:23:59] so it's not just a story
[1:24:02] he's teaching something from this story
[1:24:06] he put the duck egg under one of them
[1:24:09] chickens
[1:24:11] and it hatched out and the duck was the
[1:24:13] funniest looking thing that the chickens

[1:29:11] see but you must understand
[1:29:13] brother branham saying one time he says
[1:29:16] i was speaking preaching the word
[1:29:18] hallelujah and when i preaching was
[1:29:21] preaching the word
[1:29:23] whether god converted their hearing to
[1:29:26] hear me
[1:29:28] or whether he changed my words
[1:29:31] to their language
[1:29:33] but something taken place
[1:29:37] and they could understand me hallelujah
[1:29:40] and many times he says also a
[1:29:43] discernment and he talked about a woman
[1:29:45] that was finished and he's talking to
[1:29:48] her in english but she couldn't
[1:29:50] understand and as he continued talking
[1:29:52] all of a sudden she started getting
[1:29:53] recited on sheldon and everything else
[1:29:55] and
[1:29:56] the interpreter had to come and said how
[1:29:58] come you say you didn't understand the
[1:30:00] language
[1:30:01] he said no i don't i was just speaking
[1:30:03] to her he said but you were speaking to
[1:30:05] her in her language amen see why in the
[1:30:08] holy spirit now because you come into
[1:30:11] this place where you are subject to the
[1:30:14] holy ghost
[1:30:15] and another place there he says don't
[1:30:17] you understand what this is god speaks
[1:30:20] every language
[1:30:22] he knows every language
[1:30:25] and when he comes on the individual
[1:30:27] anoints the individual amen whenever he
[1:30:30] wants to he can talk through them to any
[1:30:32] language
[1:30:34] any time for his glory and for his honor
[1:30:37] praise god
[1:30:38] hallelujah
[1:30:40] amen praise god the handwriting is on
[1:30:43] the wall amen think of it only one man
[1:30:47] left in the kingdom
[1:30:49] amen that could interpret them
[1:30:52] unknown tongues amen see oh my think of
[1:30:56] it god allowing that that to happen and
[1:31:00] just one man left
[1:31:02] that could understand that and interpret
[1:31:05] that but that's the way it is
[1:31:09] oneness of unity
[1:31:10] see what is happening now
[1:31:14] is that all nations
[1:31:18] want all people
[1:31:20] to become one like them
[1:31:25] germany taught everybody the whole world
[1:31:28] should become germans
[1:31:31] and try to force the entire world
[1:31:34] to come one
[1:31:36] with them
[1:31:38] russia thinks
[1:31:40] everybody ought to be russians
[1:31:45] and do everything to bring everybody
[1:31:49] to be like them
[1:31:52] the western world also
[1:31:55] now
[1:31:56] listen he said this in 1958 this is not
[1:31:59] now
[1:32:00] the western world also thinks that they
[1:32:05] all should leave over there and come
[1:32:07] over here so we can all
[1:32:09] be one
[1:32:11] see they want them to be one so that
[1:32:15] everyone can speak one language
[1:32:20] just like they did in babylon
[1:32:23] right god said they are one language and
[1:32:28] he wants them they want them to speak
[1:32:31] one language again they want them all to
[1:32:34] be united persons or people but that
[1:32:38] will never take place
[1:32:41] under man's dominion
[1:32:44] amen
[1:32:46] i'll say this again it will never take
[1:32:49] place
[1:32:50] on the man's
[1:32:52] dominion for but there is coming a time
[1:32:56] when all nations will be united as one
[1:33:00] they'll be under one king
[1:33:03] and that king will be none other than
[1:33:05] our lord jesus christ
[1:33:08] hallelujah for daniel saw that that
[1:33:11] stone is christ
[1:33:13] and there will be that time
[1:33:15] of one nation one people
[1:33:18] and singing one song
[1:33:21] the old rugged cross
[1:33:24] praising him
[1:33:25] all of the grounds then that is sick and
[1:33:28] sands
[1:33:29] all of the churches all the
[1:33:31] denominations all nations
[1:33:34] all of them uns and everything else he
[1:33:36] says whatever they may be they are all
[1:33:39] nothing but sinking sand
[1:33:42] there'll be one king one language one
[1:33:45] nation under god
[1:33:47] jesus christ hallelujah and his people
[1:33:50] amen praise god amen think about it
[1:33:55] he says remember it's not just your
[1:33:58] language fit
[1:34:00] by experience
[1:34:02] but god
[1:34:04] knows that
[1:34:06] and he doesn't put it in your head but
[1:34:09] now
[1:34:10] it's in your heart
[1:34:12] in other words you speak in the same
[1:34:14] language you are speaking
[1:34:15] not a different language but it's a
[1:34:18] language of the heart
[1:34:20] not one of your head
[1:34:22] amen or one of your lips that you learn
[1:34:26] somewhere and you go out speaking that
[1:34:29] like that amen oh praise god hallelujah
[1:34:34] amen here it is he says here think of it
[1:34:37] uh
[1:34:38] i heard my own voice speaking in another
[1:34:41] language and come to find out the little
[1:34:44] woman was finished
[1:34:45] she was a finn
[1:34:47] and the holy spirit had called her name
[1:34:50] and told her everything else
[1:34:53] and told her to pray begin to praise god
[1:34:56] and i don't know nothing about finnish
[1:35:00] but it was the holy spirit calling that
[1:35:03] woman out seeing she wouldn't be left
[1:35:06] out
[1:35:07] and he the holy spirit he speaks every
[1:35:11] language
[1:35:12] and at the day of pentecost
[1:35:15] every language under heaven was gathered
[1:35:18] there
[1:35:20] and god spoke to them from his people in
[1:35:24] every dialect under the sun for it was
[1:35:27] god
[1:35:28] it was the holy spirit amen praise god
[1:35:32] so you understand what i'm saying
[1:35:33] brother sister
[1:35:35] i fear nothing you are to fear nothing
[1:35:38] you say oh oh these people that go into
[1:35:41] this country and these people are only
[1:35:42] speaking up that don't mean nothing you
[1:35:45] just preach the word and if god wants
[1:35:47] he'll just
[1:35:49] change your language whatever and you'll
[1:35:51] speak direct to them people and they'll
[1:35:53] understand you you don't have to have no
[1:35:55] worry about nothing anymore because the
[1:35:58] holy spirit will flow through you and
[1:36:00] bring his words to pass amen praise god
[1:36:03] we don't have no language barrier now do
[1:36:05] we
[1:36:07] with the holy ghost and you don't have
[1:36:08] language barrier it's just an immortal
[1:36:11] body don't understand that language
[1:36:14] or that dialect or that tongue but once
[1:36:16] you break into the holy spirit there in
[1:36:18] the language barrier
[1:36:20] you broke through every sound barrier
[1:36:22] you're brought to every veil you're
[1:36:25] brought through everything and you come
[1:36:27] into the presence of the living god
[1:36:28] hallelujah amen blessed be the name of
[1:36:31] the lord glory to god hallelujah amen
[1:36:35] amen hallelujah oh my
[1:36:38] to tell your friends
[1:36:40] when
[1:36:41] a believer is under the influence of the
[1:36:43] revelation of this message
[1:36:47] and they're speaking this message on the
[1:36:50] revelation it brings them they are
[1:36:53] speaking the new terms you know what i'm
[1:36:55] saying that you i want you to understand
[1:36:57] me because your mind is going to wrestle
[1:37:00] with the pentecostal
[1:37:02] uh portrayal that they've been given
[1:37:05] of what speaking in tongues is
[1:37:07] right you got to hear something some but
[1:37:10] listen as i've said to you before
[1:37:13] since i was just a young man the holy
[1:37:16] ghost showed me that
[1:37:18] casting out devils and the devil
[1:37:21] speaking in other towns
[1:37:23] and he said no
[1:37:25] that's not that's not the things i'm
[1:37:27] i'm telling you about that's the devil
[1:37:30] right and cast the devil out to prove it
[1:37:32] that that's the way it was you see but
[1:37:34] when god wants to use an individual
[1:37:38] that's been anointed by the holy ghost
[1:37:41] and have received the revelation of the
[1:37:43] word
[1:37:44] he can let that individual speak in any
[1:37:47] language
[1:37:48] or in any term
[1:37:50] whenever he wants
[1:37:53] and conversely
[1:37:55] he can cause you to understand any
[1:37:57] language
[1:37:59] right
[1:38:01] you can be right there and they're
[1:38:03] talking they're talking
[1:38:05] and like i did i'm hearing english
[1:38:09] it is plain as day
[1:38:11] i hear in english but when i start
[1:38:13] speaking in them to them they're in a
[1:38:15] shock
[1:38:16] because how do you know that you don't
[1:38:17] stop the language no i don't talk the
[1:38:19] language but i am hearing it
[1:38:22] i'm hearing it and that's the way god
[1:38:26] works amen hallelujah hallelujah so
[1:38:30] in your walk and in your ministry
[1:38:33] brothers sisters
[1:38:35] we don't have to fear nothing
[1:38:37] we don't have to wander at anything
[1:38:40] you don't have to before you go to japan
[1:38:42] or korea go and pick up a language book
[1:38:44] and start learning the language because
[1:38:46] you got to preach there and so
[1:38:49] the devil put all these things to be
[1:38:51] obstacles the man in the text five years
[1:38:53] to go learning this language of that
[1:38:55] language before he even goes and by time
[1:38:58] then the fire that was in him cooled off
[1:39:00] right
[1:39:02] you don't have to do that just go in the
[1:39:04] name of jesus christ under the holy
[1:39:07] spirit amen and god will use you for his
[1:39:10] glory amen so the new tongues of the
[1:39:13] elect
[1:39:14] is really the holy spirit himself
[1:39:18] speaking
[1:39:19] through them
[1:39:20] whenever he wills
[1:39:23] whenever he wants to manifest himself
[1:39:26] for his glory
[1:39:27] praise the lord
[1:39:29] and then it's going to leave us after a
[1:39:31] while
[1:39:32] because and i'm going to wind up now
[1:39:35] because you remember
[1:39:37] joseph was down in egypt
[1:39:39] how many knows the story of joseph
[1:39:42] down in egypt and when joseph was in
[1:39:44] egypt like oh god we are here in this
[1:39:47] world and everything else down here
[1:39:49] amongst all the people and everything
[1:39:51] else
[1:39:53] and the brethren came up because they
[1:39:55] wanted to get food from him
[1:39:57] you know there's something about us as a
[1:40:00] people a god who has really received
[1:40:03] this message i know everybody said they
[1:40:05] receive it but receive the revelation of
[1:40:07] the word
[1:40:08] that
[1:40:09] people
[1:40:10] they don't like what
[1:40:12] you're you're standing for and what you
[1:40:14] might be saying and this but yet they
[1:40:18] they want to come and talk to you they
[1:40:20] want to get food
[1:40:23] they want the spiritual food that you
[1:40:26] have yes
[1:40:28] right
[1:40:28] it's the same thing was happening with
[1:40:30] joseph in type right they brought his
[1:40:33] brethren came up to him
[1:40:36] amen
[1:40:37] to be able to buy food or or get food
[1:40:41] from him hallelujah and when he began
[1:40:45] talking to them they said we don't
[1:40:47] understand
[1:40:48] uh uh we don't understand
[1:40:51] of course joseph if he wanted to he
[1:40:53] could step down
[1:40:55] and talk to them
[1:40:57] in just a plain ordinary jewish language
[1:41:00] just like you if you want to you can
[1:41:02] talk to the jewel witness if you want
[1:41:05] and you step down to his level you can
[1:41:06] talk to whichever group you want you can
[1:41:09] step down but if you talk up here
[1:41:12] where you are we don't understand that
[1:41:14] we don't know what you're talking about
[1:41:16] we don't know this stuff here you're
[1:41:18] speaking about so
[1:41:20] so we don't understand that amen and the
[1:41:23] bible says and joseph spoke to them
[1:41:27] through an interpreter
[1:41:30] i want thank god for the holy spirit
[1:41:34] that we can still
[1:41:35] speak to uh our brothers or sisters our
[1:41:39] family or friends
[1:41:41] and speak to them by the holy spirit
[1:41:44] and let the holy spirit have his way
[1:41:46] amen praise god he spoke to them by an
[1:41:50] interpreter and make make no message and
[1:41:53] we know brother sister that the r is
[1:41:56] coming now when this thing is going back
[1:41:58] to israel
[1:42:00] and
[1:42:02] and joseph is going to have to talk to
[1:42:04] his brethren
[1:42:06] and you know all that we don't want to
[1:42:08] go into him calling little benjamin and
[1:42:10] and having to talk with him
[1:42:13] but um
[1:42:14] he he then will have to speak to them
[1:42:18] under the language that
[1:42:20] is now speaking to us
[1:42:23] and and when it goes to them they
[1:42:25] they're not going to understand it
[1:42:26] praise god but after a while
[1:42:30] through the interpreter they will begin
[1:42:32] to understand
[1:42:34] and as the prophet said
[1:42:36] the the trumpets to them is like the
[1:42:38] seals to us
[1:42:39] and when just like the seals broke to us
[1:42:42] it will have to break to them
[1:42:45] and uh when when seals break
[1:42:48] oh yes he's reminding me something here
[1:42:50] i missed the coat station here somewhere
[1:42:53] you can let me find it because he's
[1:42:55] talking about the seventh seal in
[1:42:57] respect to what we're talking about here
[1:42:59] amen yeah and and then so it'll break on
[1:43:03] them
[1:43:04] and they will begin to understand it
[1:43:07] just give me a minute and let me
[1:43:09] find this
[1:43:11] quotation here
[1:43:15] where he's talking about
[1:43:17] this on the seventh seal praise the lord
[1:43:20] hallelujah
[1:43:22] oh praise god i don't know how i went
[1:43:24] over that maybe he wanted to save that
[1:43:27] for us
[1:43:29] for the glory of god
[1:43:31] amen
[1:43:32] hallelujah
[1:43:34] seventh seal
[1:43:36] because he was talking about how you
[1:43:38] notice the seventh seal when it began to
[1:43:41] break on the people
[1:43:43] hallelujah that it didn't have
[1:43:46] anything said about it
[1:43:48] nothing was made known
[1:43:51] to the people
[1:43:52] whatsoever
[1:43:54] praise god
[1:43:56] hallelujah okay
[1:43:58] praise god
[1:44:00] i want you to notice and i'm going to
[1:44:02] close now
[1:44:04] this is a different day uh even my way
[1:44:07] of preaching the word or bringing the
[1:44:08] word to you
[1:44:11] i want you to notice
[1:44:13] that jesus omitted all teaching
[1:44:16] of that seventh
[1:44:18] seal it's not here
[1:44:21] watch
[1:44:23] he does it
[1:44:25] but goes right on
[1:44:27] by speaking parables
[1:44:31] now after that when john comes
[1:44:36] the seventh seal
[1:44:38] the last seal
[1:44:40] that seventh seal
[1:44:43] that's going to be a great thing
[1:44:47] and it's so great
[1:44:49] it's not even written
[1:44:52] see there's the unwritten word where a
[1:44:54] lot of people think you're talking over
[1:44:56] your head you don't know what you're
[1:44:57] talking about it's right there
[1:44:59] the seventh seal he said that one is not
[1:45:02] even written
[1:45:03] well how are you going to get it and
[1:45:04] it's not even written
[1:45:07] how are you going to understand it are
[1:45:08] you going to get anything about it but
[1:45:10] this is what you're saying the very
[1:45:13] nature the life the gene that is in you
[1:45:16] that's not written because that like in
[1:45:18] the little duck is going to pick it up
[1:45:21] that little duck is going to go right to
[1:45:23] it because they're mad for that that
[1:45:25] means they've come along that line
[1:45:28] hallelujah
[1:45:29] a great thing it's not even written
[1:45:32] right you see oh my
[1:45:35] john the revelation
[1:45:38] wanted to write it but the voice said
[1:45:42] don't write
[1:45:43] and there was silence in heaven there is
[1:45:46] not a written word about it
[1:45:49] amen how a praise god so how are you
[1:45:52] gonna get this revelation of the seventh
[1:45:55] seal by
[1:45:56] revelation
[1:45:58] only where you can get it it's by
[1:46:01] revelation
[1:46:02] everyone else are going to be stuck up

[1:47:11] and shouting and singing to make up for
[1:47:13] your deficiencies

[1:47:18] supposed to have
[1:47:20] i just want to thank god for this little
[1:47:23] thought here and i trust has been a
[1:47:24] blessing to you

[1:48:15] not there and you're speaking from one
