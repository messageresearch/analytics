TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Are you down? [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Applause] Hey. [Music] Praise God. Welcome to House of the Living God. Let's give God an applause. Our scripture is taken from Psalm 16. [Music] Psalms 16. Preserve me, oh God, for indeed do I put up my trust. Oh my soul, thou has said unto the Lord, Thou are my Lord, my goodness extend not to thee, extend. Thou are my Lord, my goodness extended not to thee, but to the s to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent in whom is all my delight. Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god. Their drink offerings of blood will I not offer nor take up their names into my lips. [Music] The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup. Thou maintainest my not. The lines are fallen onto me in pleasant places. Here I have a goodly heritage. I'll bless the Lord who had given me counsel. My reigns also instruct me in the night seasons. I have said the Lord I like this portion. Verse eight. I have said the Lord always before me because he is at my right hand. I shall not be moved. That's putting God in front of him. Amen. That's living his presence. Therefore, my heart is glad and my glory rejoice. My flesh shall also rest in hope. For thou will not leave my soul in hell, neither shalt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption. The last verse. Let's read together. Verse 11. Thou will show me the path of life. In thy presence is fullness of joy. At thy right hand there are pleasures forever. Amen.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Welcome into the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. It's good to be here. God bless you musicians. Thank you so much for a wonderful song service creating the atmosphere so that the word can come and uh have uh liberty in our midst this morning. That's that's why we come to church. Amen. We come to assemble around the word of God for this day and for this hour. This is what God has given us. This is a a tremendous privilege and honor. Amen. to be on this side as a minister and to be on that side as a receiver of the Holy Ghost. Amen. This is what we feed on. Praise God. Uh welcome everybody. Welcome to ourers this morning. We certainly appreciate everybody. We welcome our visitors online. Praise God. Um, if the Lord's been blessing you through the services, then like the services, subscribe to the services, share the services, let the word for this hour get into the hearts of the people. Amen. It's what's going to awaken that last li that last seed of God that that we're, you know, that's what we're doing. We're preaching the word. We're putting out the word, which is the water of God's watering the seed that's out there. We don't know where the water's going to land. The word of God will just touch and awaken somebody and all of a sudden it'll catch their attention just like it did for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we're living in a time where the word can move in such a quick fashion. You know, one second a person's listening to it, another minute they can share it with somebody in in Italy or somebody in Portugal or some somebody in Germany or somebody wherever. Amen. Praise God. This is the hour that we're living in. And so we're just waiting for that last one to receive and to awaken to the word for this day. Praise God. And so God has given us a five-fold ministry. God has given us ministers that uh you know have different anointings on them to bring the word of God in such a way that you know I bring it in such a way that you know brother Desmond brings it in a different way, brother Tim brings it in a different way, brother Philip brings it in a different way. But if you're paying attention, you're hearing the same voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we're listening for the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. When you listen to the tapes, you're listening for the same thing. You're listening for the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. To speak to you in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So, we certainly appreciate the five-fold ministry uh of this hour. Amen. And so this morning, um, we're going to continue along where we've been kind of, uh, moving here over the last four or five services on the purpose of God. Amen. And more specifically, the purpose of the Holy Ghost in and what, you know, it it's to produce in in this day and in this hour. And I believe that it's something that um that I'm getting tremendously blessed from it. I'm telling you now. I'm just, you know, doing the studying and and just getting in there and feeding on the word. And it's amazing because uh remember the Holy Ghost in this hour gives you an open book revelation like you've never had before. &gt;&gt; And if you think that you know that that um you know it all or there's nothing else that you need to know, stop right there. Okay. There is so much more that the Lord is unveiling in this day and in this hour. And this is the beauty of this revelation of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost person Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've been talking about that, you know, the Holy Spirit, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. There's a difference. It's it is the same God. It is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ but in different manifestations. You can be anointed. You can you can have the influence of the Holy Spirit. That's why you can come into services, you know, like the ones we had here for our our young people back in in August. You know, there was such a a baptism and an anointing that came into those services and everybody caught got caught into that anointing and it's wonderful, but it needs to produce and and and progress in the individual's life &gt;&gt; more than just the anointing. Amen. Praise God. And so that's why we want to make sure that that we are in contact with the person of the Holy Ghost. not only in contact with him, but allowing him in because when he comes in, it's a whole new life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Let's go to the word of God. Let's look at um our uh so today we're we're looking we're still looking into the purpose of the Holy Ghost. What is the purpose of the Holy Ghost? But today we're going to we're we're we're making a statement that the Holy Ghost produces a new birth. A lot of people think that, you know, they heard Jesus say, "You must be born again." And everybody just puts, you know, Christian denominations out there. Oh, yes, we're born again Christians. We've been born again. And meanwhile, they believe in a trinity. They don't they have no idea of the coming of the Lord. They don't understand the rapture. Just like to, you know, this week there was talk on the rapture and everything. Anyways, let's go to the word and then we can let the Holy Spirit speak to our hearts. Amen. Praise God. And so today we want to look at the birth uh birth. It's a new birth that the Holy Spirit that the Holy Ghost produces in this hour. And a lot of people in this message, believe it or not, have not even been birthed. &gt;&gt; Oh my. It's it's it's a pretty powerful statement, but it's going to stir hearts and lives. And like I said right from the very beginning, if you feel a little bit uncomfortable as the word is coming forth, that's okay. Just check your walk, check your experience and and see what the what the Holy Ghost is producing in your life. Amen. Praise God. So let's go to our scripture. Acts chapter 1 verses 7 to8 and let's just ask the Lord for a blessing. Father, does anybody have a need this morning? An extra uh say Lord remember me. Remember this situation. Lord you see every uplifted hand in the house this morning. Father, mine are both lifted up. Father, there's so many needs, Lord. Oh, God. Lord, as long as we're here in this dimension, Lord, we are going to have to overcome. And Lord, I had to overcome this morning to get here. And Lord, I know that every single one of us here in the house of the Lord this morning, if they're having a real walk with you, Lord, the enemy don't like it. And it's going to be a battle every time to get into the house of the Lord. It'll be a battle every time to turn on that service and to tune in to receive what God has. But Lord, you never disappoint. That's the one thing that I am certain of, Father. That Lord, if our hearts are are are genuinely sincere this morning to receive something from you, you will come. You will speak. You will meet needs. You will deliver. You will set free. You will open the blinded eyes. You will, Lord, you'll raise the dead, Father. Oh, God. Let it be done this morning as your word comes forth and do a great work in our midst. Lord, we surrender ourselves to your service, Lord. Bless your people. Take us into heavenly places. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. And amen. Praise God. And in Acts 1 7 to8 it said and he said unto them and Jesus speaking here because he had just appeared you know to the to the disciples he said it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power. Amen. So we need to realize here that that that that God is the supreme authority that the power that he's talking about here his own power is his authority his plan his absolute uh vision that he had from before the foundations of the world. Amen. That's something that that you or I we don't have control over that but we come into it. Amen. And this is how we come in. But ye receive power. He's talking about a different power here. The power that he's talking about when he says that the father hath his own power, that's authority. Amen. That's his authority. Then he's talking about that you shall receive power. And look, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. The Lord add his blessing to the word of God. Amen. You may be seated. Praise God. You know here Jesus was making it very clear that first of all there was a dispensational change. Amen. That because the people were asking him you know how we're going to know and what what you know h how will we know uh you know the time in the season that we're in? And he says, "Don't worry about that because I'm going to send you the power that you need by the Holy Ghost." And that when you receive the Holy Ghost in your day, it's going to it's going to lead you into all truth. It's going to open the scripture in such a way that you, you know, all of a sudden now you're going to be able to understand why there's so much confusion out in the world when it comes to Christianity. We've got thousands of denominations, Christian denominations, all kinds of interpretations. But Jesus made it very clear that he would send the Holy Ghost and then you could really truly be a witness because you need to you need to know what you know what the Holy Ghost is all about. Amen. It's not about you getting your own understanding. You're you getting your own interpretation on on what Christianity is. No, it's you receiving him, his purpose, and you be setting you being set aside now in the day that you're living in to actually bring forth the manifestation or the interpretation of what it is to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this day, &gt;&gt; a true understanding of Christianity. Amen. Glory to God. there'd be a genuine experience that when the Holy Ghost comes upon you, you will know that you know. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to I can't I can't um you know uh emphasize it or make it any clearer than what I'm saying when I say to you, you will know, you will be changed. You will not have the same desires. You will be transformed. You will be like a like you know when when John said that I baptize you unto repentance but he that cometh after me which is and we know is the Lord Jesus Christ he's going to baptize you with fire and the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the fire you know a lot of people you got to understand what the fire is. Well, listen, fire, you know, it's like a person like I I remember when the Holy Ghost came into my life, when I when I realized that that my God, I'm I'm I'm actually possessed by the spirit of God because you become like a house on fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The fire is the zeal for the word of God. And all of a sudden you re, you know, you want to tell everybody, &gt;&gt; you want to let everybody know your family and you cause a complete and total religious disturbance in your life when this happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You show me one birth that isn't messy. Every birth is messy. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why when the Holy Ghost comes, you'll know it. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost has a purpose. when it comes upon us, there is there is a visible change that our old life is now secondary to the new life. &gt;&gt; It's it's automatic. You you can't help but talk about him. &gt;&gt; You're talking about him. You're reading about him. You're every everywhere you look, you look into nature, you're going to see him. &gt;&gt; He's everywhere because all of a sudden, there's a new nature that's come upon you. Amen. Praise God. The old life dies. Your way of thinking changes. Your way of living changes. Your soul starts to thirst after the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll tell you that, you know, a an experience of the Holy Ghost. You get a thirst for the living God. &gt;&gt; You want to know what God's doing right now. &gt;&gt; You want to understand how it is that my life is is in the situation that it is right now and know that God can change it right now. that you don't have to stay in the condition that you might find yourself in, you know, because you're still human. You're still going to have to overcome. You're still going to get depressed. You're still going to have to fight. You're still going to have to fight for your family, for your loved ones, for your finance, for your health. Many there's people going like look at Sister Sheila. She's been Ela. She's been fighting for her life. Amen. Because over the last couple years, she's gone through so much. But there's something keeping her. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost. The purpose of God. &gt;&gt; The purpose of God once it gets in you, it overrides the disease. &gt;&gt; It overrides the depression. &gt;&gt; It overrides the the the the lack of of your needs. It overrides your mistakes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Glory to God. Brother Brandham said that when you make a mistake as a son or a daughter of God, that's you can make mistakes with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not going to be perfect when you receive him. He's perfect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're not going to be perfect till this gets changed. Amen. But he says that when you as a son or a daughter of God makes a mistake, something cries out of you and says, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; forgive me, Lord. I didn't mean to say that." And right there, Brother Bram said, "And right there, God doesn't even see it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. This is the God that we serve. Listen. Listen. God had to make a way for you in this age &gt;&gt; in a condition like the world is in right now. He needed to make a way for you &gt;&gt; to to overcome this age. Amen. And he knew exactly what he'd have to give you. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Glory. Amen. Listen, John the Baptist, you know, like when when John the Baptist saw Jesus coming into the Jordan, okay? He knew right there and then that he was he was going to be going through a dispensational change because he knew who he was. He recognized the the the the anointing and the word that he was actually fulfilling. He actually quoted it back to the people cuz they came to him. The people were in confusion just like today. There's people all over the earth call themselves Christians, but they still you go and ask them, "Have you received the Holy Ghost?" I can see that you're a believer, but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe? Because I can see you're a believer. But just like in the day of John, he had to say, "You need to repent. You need to turn from your traditions, your understanding of the word because now the word himself is coming on the scene." And he realized right there and then that he would have to decrease. &gt;&gt; He would have to go off and so that Christ could come on. Amen. And these are the things that that have taken place in our day under the message of this hour. And people are failing to recognize the dispensational changes when the Holy Ghost is introduced to the people by the teaching of the word. Even brother Brandham says that the people don't understand the Holy Ghost because of lack of teaching. &gt;&gt; That's what this is all about here. When I started to look into this and dig deeper into it and and listen to sermons, you know, that that that individuals that have caught the revelation of this of this hour when it comes to understanding what the Holy Ghost is to produce, it changed. The book becomes a new book. All of a sudden, you start to see things and realize, "Oh my God, I was I was seeing it this way having not a clarity of understanding." But I believe as we move through this, you're going to be blessed to see how clear and and it's going to vindicate where you're standing. It's going to give you confidence to stand where you are and to know that you're not standing on some slimy sand that's going to that's going to allow you to fall into the sea when that great earthquake takes place. No, you're going to be standing on a rock and you're going to have a revelation that's going to take you right out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we need to understand that when the Holy Ghost changes dispensation and is progressing from age to age, a new birth is actually required. &gt;&gt; A brand new birth. You mean you can be born again? Yes. &gt;&gt; Again? because you thought what you were under was going to produce the things in your life and you're looking at everything and you're looking at the confusion. You see yourself in a church. You see that there's division. You see, listen, as long as you go to church, there's going to be three kinds of believers in every church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to be right to the very end. The true believer, the makebeliever, and the unbeliever. Amen. And those three are always going to be in the midst. And and so understanding that that there's an absolute truth that the Holy Ghost will progress us onto you surrender now to understand that there's a dispensational change that can take place in my day that that could actually bring a greater understanding of what the word is to produce and how it's going to produce the rapture. Because remember the message that we speak and that we preach in this day and in this hour is the message for the rapture of the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Rapturing faith lies within the open word for this day and this hour. &gt;&gt; Rapturing faith lays within the Holy Ghost for this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; The same God, but what he's doing now. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, listen here in uh you can go to the first quote there uh voice of the sign. Look, look at John. No selfishness in him. He never took any glory. They tried to call him the Messiah. Now, I want you to as I'm reading this, I want you to think about the day we're living in. How God sent us a prophet. uh uh Malachi 4:5, William Branham, the messenger to the Pentecostal age, to the Leodysian church age. I want you to understand how it was how he was misinterpreted and how he was interpreted and how he is even today being misinterpreted. Amen. But the Holy Ghost brings a clear interpretation of who he is, where he stands, and where you stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "No selfishness in him." He never took any glory. They tried to call him the Messiah. That's what they did to William Brandham, too. I'm not worthy to lose his shoes. But as soon as Jesus appeared, he had a sign, a pillar of fire, a light above him like a dove come down a voice saying, "This is my beloved son whom I'm well pleased." If you go and you actually get the interpretation of that, who I'm who I'm well pleased, it's whom I'm pleased to dwell in. &gt;&gt; God was coming to dwell as God in a man. &gt;&gt; That's what it was. &gt;&gt; Not you know the father, the son, and the holy ghost three in one. No, no, no, no. God was now changing manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. of Almighty God, the self-existent one, who had to make the sacrifice himself. Amen. Glory to God. Come down and take a human vessel. Called it the Son, which was Jesus, Jehovah, God with us, Emmanuel. The word was made flesh and dwelt among us. How many interpretations do you want? &gt;&gt; Amen. It was God himself &gt;&gt; saying, "I'm now come down. My word is going to which is which was the Holy Ghost." Okay. The person of God himself now coming into a human man &gt;&gt; to show that he could unite with man &gt;&gt; so that he could redeem us &gt;&gt; in man form. &gt;&gt; Okay? That's why he became man so that he could redeem us. &gt;&gt; A man had to go to Calvary. God didn't go to Calvary. A human vessel &gt;&gt; that was ordained as a man went to Calvary to die a sacrifice. God could not die. God can't die. That's why the Holy Ghost, that's why brother Brandham says that God left him at the Garden of Gethsemane &gt;&gt; and he had to go to the cross as a man and suffer as a man and came under obedience to the call which was the word that said that that he would be the sacrificial lamb that would go to Calvary. He he says, "I come not to do my own will." He says, "I come to do the will of the father, which was the will of the father." The word for the day. Jesus was the word in his day to go to Calvary and die for your sin, my sin, &gt;&gt; so that he could send back the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; himself, the person now in multiplied form. Amen. And so here, this is my beloved son whom I'm well pleased. Notice. And John immediately said, "He must increase. The Lord must increase. I must decrease." He presented the church to Christ. &gt;&gt; He was actually presenting the church to Christ. Those that had received John's message that had received repentance by being baptized unto repentance from what they were believing because they were all believing wrong. They had an interpretation of how the Messiah was going to come. And look at all the religious leaders of that day didn't recognize him. What does that tell you? It's going to happen again. &gt;&gt; It's exactly what's happened again. &gt;&gt; I hate to be the bearer of, you know, tough news. But you know what? 98% of the churches that call themselves Christians out there have missed him again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're waiting on his coming. They're waiting on the clouds of glory to display this great announcement of the Lord Jesus. They're looking for people to go in the rapture. Some people think that they're going to be changed and their bodies are going to lift and we're going to see people raising up their bodies going up into the air. That's why this week they made they made fun of it. Actually CNN had a an a news article, you know, they a video that I watched and and they were talking about, you know, this guy that was in Africa that had that that God had spoken to him. The rapture was going to happen on September the 23rd. &gt;&gt; God had showed him. People were getting ready. People were doing everything to to be prepared for the rapture that it was going to happen. They have no idea that the rapture is already in progress. &gt;&gt; That you are already in the rapture. &gt;&gt; One's going to be in the bed. One's going to be taken. One's going to be in the field. One's going to be taken how? By this message. &gt;&gt; Because the rapture is Christ. It is the word for your day. And and it's a revelation of what God is doing. That's why when you get changed in the twinkling of an eye, &gt;&gt; that's going to be the final stage of what he's doing right now in your life &gt;&gt; by the opening of the word in you and giving you a revelation of who you are, &gt;&gt; where you belong, &gt;&gt; what the Holy Ghost is supposed to produce, how it changes your life, that it's not some just sign your name on a on a church and now you're a member of a church. They have a total they are completely blind to the revelation of the rapture. Why? Because they missed the messenger for their age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God had a messenger in the 20th century. Malachi 4:5. Oh, they'll recognize John L John Wesley. They'll recognize Martin Luther. Oh, they'll recognize, you know, Swingley and all these different Calvin and all these other, you know, men of God that that were on the mission fields, but they failed to recognize the prophet that God sent. He says, "Behold, I'll send you Elijah the prophet. He'll turn you back to the word. &gt;&gt; He'll give you He'll have a teaching that'll bring you back to the word of God." That's the that was the the the the purpose of the prophet. and then that he would fulfill Revelations 10:1-7, the opening of those seven seals, which would actually bring Christ back to earth again. &gt;&gt; Amen. It would be another new birth. That's why the prophet said, "This book is a brand new Bible to me." It's &gt;&gt; because now he was possessed of the Holy Ghost. He was the first fruits of the bride of Christ moving into the bride age to recognize there's going to be a word that's going to actually bring the mystical body of Christ, Adam and Eve, right back together to be one again. Glory. Hallelujah. So here he says, I must increase. I must uh he must increase. I must decrease. He presented the church to Christ. Amen. And we are told that in the last days that will repeat again. That's what I was just talking about. I got a little bit ahead of the quote. Amen. There's going to be a message come forth. Glory to God. That will introduce the Messiah to the people. And it'll be in such a way they'll stand dumbfounded like they did then. He promised it. &gt;&gt; And it's happening again. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're down the road, saints. It's happening again. where the where the mighty angel himself under the ministry of a five-fold ministry where he's got individuals that have recognized and receive the Holy Ghost in their day and receive the new birth in their day which allows them to look back into the word and see exactly what the word is to produce in their day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus understood what the word was to produce in his day. He's got to go to Calvary regardless of what any but Peter comes to him and says, "Lord," he says, "What?" When when when he told him that he must die and that he, "No way." Peter says, "You're not going. You're not going to There's no way you're going. I'm going to go with you. I'll I I'll stop them. I'll do everything." He says, "Now look what Jesus turns around and says, &gt;&gt; Peter, no." He said, "Satan, get behind me." &gt;&gt; Because he knew what was talking through Peter. Amen. &gt;&gt; He realized Jesus was the word. He knew what the word was going to produce. He wasn't going to let anything stop him in fulfilling the word for his day. &gt;&gt; Didn't matter if everybody denied him just like they did. Only a dozen followed him. And even they needed to receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And that's why a lot of people have received Christ in the baptism of the Holy Ghost, in the baptism of the Holy Spirit, under the teachings, but have not actually allowed him to come in &gt;&gt; and take over so that his purpose can be fulfilled in every individual life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God forever more. He's interested in every individual. Praise God. And so here now, we know that when we talk about the Holy Spirit, when we talk about the Holy Ghost, we're talking about being separated. When you receive the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost into your life, it's because God is separating you for a purpose. And the purpose in this day is to manifest the word of the hour. &gt;&gt; The the revealed word which will identify prophecy. It identify current events. The word will identify Israel &gt;&gt; because it's the Holy Ghost. Remember, he knows all things. But you know, that's why with w with with with the Holy Ghost, you're going to you're going to take man's interpretation. You're going to take your own emotional understanding and interpretation when you see certain riots going on. People look at all these riots, people seeing, you know, like what's going on in Israel in Gaza there, thousands of people being killed. It's sad. It's absolutely terrible what's going on. But they don't realize that this is prophetic. This is prophecy. They don't understand the position of Israel. why Israel is able to stand as long as they've been standing to this day. It's it's it's God. They could never have done it without God's purpose &gt;&gt; in their nation in in their in in in the word. Every promise that he made back in the Old Testament, that purpose will be fulfilled in the nation of Israel. Nobody can stop it. There's nothing that can change it. They will never divide the land. I'm telling you now, God says, "I shall I will not allow you to divide the land." &gt;&gt; And if God says you're not going to divide the land, who's going to who's going to go over override God's word? They want to they think that they can do it, but that's because they're under a an illusion. They're under a delusion. They're under a reprobate understanding of the word. &gt;&gt; That's why it's all about the word. understanding what God has declared for us in this day and in this hour. So, we understand that that when when the Holy Ghost when we're talking about the Holy Ghost coming into your life, it's because God's purpose in relation to, with, and in man. That's what the Holy Ghost is all about. his relation to man, with man, in man. &gt;&gt; And this is the hour where it's in man to manifest himself in the church, in the bride, in the the the the the true church of the hour. There's got to be one original. &gt;&gt; I know everybody out there, oh, what you saying? You're the only church. I'm not saying I'm the only church. We're not saying Good Neighbor Ministries is the only church. We're saying that the body of Christ is the only church &gt;&gt; and he is the word. Amen. That's that's what we're saying. We're not we're not putting, you know, we're not we're not identifying names of churches and people. We're identifying the word of God, the body of Christ in this day and in this hour. Amen. Praise God. So, let's move on because we're looking at things here um you know in the scripture. We want to look at Acts 2 37-38. Very familiar scripture, but it it's a new book to me. Now I read these scriptures, I'm seeing things that I never saw before. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This this word never stops unveiling itself. Amen. Praise God, brother Phillip. It's wonderful. Listen now, when they heard this, now remember, this is the day of Pentecost. They had just come out of the upper room. There's all kinds of, you know, uh, disciples, 120 of them come running into the streets. They are rejoicing because the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost has come upon them. Amen. They're speaking in tongues. They were speaking. Now, if you go back and read and understand and look into, they were speaking in languages of the day. &gt;&gt; They weren't speaking gibberish. There was actual language that was being spoken and there was people that were hearing it in their own language because there was people from Samaria. There was different they were from different regions receiving the word in their day by the Holy Ghost. They were hearing their own language. When God wants to speak to you, you're going to hear him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you're going to hear the the interpretation of what it means, what what he actually means in his word when you're hearing the word. That's a type of hearing the word for your day. Amen. Hearing it in a language that you're going to understand, which is by revelation. &gt;&gt; Now, when they heard this, they were pricricked in their hearts, the people, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto themreent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So here now when we look at this scripture we are seeing here that remember when John was on the scene what was he saying to the people? Repent for he is coming. Repent from your understanding. Turn away what it is. What is it to repent? People think that oh I got to stop you know I got to stop lying. I got to stop drinking. I got to stop smoking. Uh, you know, I got to stop going into the wrong places. They think that that is the interpretation of repent. Thinking that it's those things, those are the attributes of sin. What you need to repent of is your interpretation of how you see the word of God. people are are are placing their own interpretation or their church's interpretation or their their their pastor's interpretation or their organization's interpretation on the word thinking that that that uh you know is the way that it is. But remember, to truly repent is to turn away from everything the way that you thought it was and allow the spirit of God to interpret it to you. So notice when there's true genuine repentance and you are baptized into the name of Jesus Christ. A lot of people don't even understand that. They think, "Oh, I just need to go into water and pronounce and speak it this way, and that is going to give them the Holy Ghost because I've done it the right way." That's not it, saints. You can, like we've talked many times, you can go into that water, but if you have not truly repented and been changed because that's the first thing, nothing is going to happen. And then if you don't take on his name, what is the name of Jesus Christ? Jesus himself says, I come in my father's name. What was he saying? I'm coming in the life of the Holy Ghost. The self-existent, the almighty, the life of God. &gt;&gt; His name is a person. It's a life. It's a purpose. It has a plan. It has a destiny. It has a desire to fulfill his own purpose of redemption to redeem his sons and daughters. So when you take on his actual name, you're taking on the actual life of God in you. when you're you're you're you're accepting him as your Lord, your Savior. Remember, baptism is an outward expression of something that's already happened on the inside. &gt;&gt; And then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Now, the gift of the Holy Ghost is not something that you deserved that you did to receive it. It's a gift. Notice he said, "You shall receive a gift." A gift. Somebody brings you a gift. If you don't receive it, you don't get it. &gt;&gt; So, you need to receive the gift and you need to understand that it was not given to you for any other reason other than he had a purpose in giving it to you. There's individuals that are ordained because there's life inside of them from before the foundations of the world that are to receive the gift. &gt;&gt; And that's how we need to understand how God is calling each and every individual. It's not because you did something. He put no conditions on it. That's why it's a gift. We put conditions on it. Oh, before I get baptized, I got to go and I got to clean up my life. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. You do need to, you know, be be, you know, conscious that you need to clean up your life. But you need to also understand that if you receive this gift, it's not going to be because of your own works. It's not going to be because of you doing something. It's not going to be we need to take ourselves out of the picture &gt;&gt; and don't look at our own abilities based base our experience on on on on anything else but the promise of his word. &gt;&gt; And when you place your experience not on well you know the the the the individual told me if I go get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'll receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. No, no. You need to base the experience on your genuine faith in the word that that that you and the word have connected that now you're you're seeing something that you never saw before. You're recognizing an element in the word that that that your faith is now going to demonstrate that it's actually in you. that it's not because you're being that that that you're that you're being uh you know coerced or being convinced to come to the water of baptism. No, no, no. It's because something genuinely took place in your heart that has that is that has that has caught your attention to the word &gt;&gt; to now you're looking at the word and you're saying, "Yeah, I can see it as clear as a bell. It says, "Be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." Why do they baptize into the titles of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost? Well, because Jesus said in Matthew 28:19, "You can be baptized. Go into all the world baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost." Jesus said, "I come in my father's name." &gt;&gt; So, what was the name of God? &gt;&gt; It was Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why on the day of Pentecost when Jesus told all the disciples and Peter was right there he when he said go ye into all the world and baptize in the name of the father. Peter on the day of penet we just read it and Peter told them to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Why didn't he say in the name of the father son and holy ghost? Because he had a genuine revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had a genuine experience by the word. &gt;&gt; He had recognized that the word had spoken to him and awakened something inside of him that he didn't even fully comprehend, but all he could do was say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe it. And that's what's going to come out of you when you truly genuinely make God your absolute. You're going to just say amen to the word of God. You may not fully understand it just yet, but I believe God. I believe if God needs to turn me around, God needs to open my understanding, if God needs to remove certain things out of my life, he can do it. &gt;&gt; I trust in it. I I believe in it. Now you're Now you're getting somewhere. Now you're on the right road. Amen. Glory to God. Because receiving the Holy Ghost is not based on sensation, speaking in tongues, or shouting. Everybody has their own experience when it comes to receiving the Holy Ghost because remember it's the word for your day. &gt;&gt; That's the evidence, the word for your day. Amen. You could make mistakes. You could do all kinds of things that has nothing to do with you receiving the word for your day. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Listen, we're going to move on here. Listen, the uh uh you know, it's as simple as receiving the the the word from a friend at work. Have you heard that God sent a prophet in the 20th century to restore the word because there was so much confusion? When I first heard that, you know, you know, my first experience was with him, the mighty God himself, because you know, everybody comes in a different way. It all depends where you're at your path of life. I was stuck in a drug addiction. So God needed to take that demon out of the way in order to get my attention to the word of God. That's what that's how God moves. He He can He can do it in any way he wants to do it. &gt;&gt; Don't put any interpretation on the way God is going to birth an individual. &gt;&gt; The new birth can come in very simple ways. Amen. We've got a lot of young people that are born in this message, brought up under a a a family, a a father and a mother that's that that's believing this message. And those young people, they need the same experience, not in the way that you got it. You know, that's the problem. A lot of the times we want to see them have the same experience that we did when it comes to, you know, because we were we were lost in sin, committing all kinds of wickedness in the world and and cheating and lying and stealing and they and they've been living good lives, but they still haven't got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They need to understand what the Holy Ghost got to produce in their life. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's always back to the word. It always brings you back to the word as a genuine experience. Amen. So, you know, we could be uh you know, preaching this message, quoting brother Brandham over and over and over again, quoting scripture on top of scripture. If you have not received the message of your day by the opening of the word, which is the Holy Ghost in your day, you can listen to tapes all day long. You can come to church six days a week. &gt;&gt; It is not going to change you &gt;&gt; until you come under this anointing of the Holy Ghost for this hour which produces a brand new birth and opens the word of God to you personally like like nobody else. Now you've got something that you can tell the people. &gt;&gt; Now you've got a message that can change lives. Now you've got something inside of you that can strengthen your brethren. Amen. That can edify the body of Jesus Christ. Let's go to the next quote here. In the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. Wonderful message. Go back and listen to it. There's so much in there on the Holy Ghost. It's it's just tremendous. But he goes on here and he says, "Now the first step is repentance towards God." Now pay attention. And then follows after that is water baptism. Water baptism. Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. See, water baptism follows showing that repentance was genuine. &gt;&gt; So you young people, if you're going to come to the water, seek a genuine repentance before you come to that water. Amen. &gt;&gt; Make it up in your own mind. Decide right there and then. Now, this is part of overcoming. You see, people think that, oh, I can just go to the water. It doesn't it it's not just going to the water. It's going to the water with a genuine repentance. Because watch to remit your past sins. It has nothing to do with future sin. It only remits. Now, this is interesting. Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. What for? Remission. Taking away of past sin has nothing to do with the future. &gt;&gt; You know what that says? It says that you can actually repent. You can get baptized. And when you do get baptized, &gt;&gt; your your sin of the past wiped away. &gt;&gt; It's gone. &gt;&gt; You and and you know you know who it's gone to? Not to God. to you. You need to let go of your past. You need that that to to to be have those sins blotted out of your life &gt;&gt; through the baptism, through a genuine repentance. But it still doesn't mean that you're going to go on and from that day on you're just going to be like an angel floating into church every Sunday, every Wednesday. You're going to be an angel at work. You're going to be such a a goodie tooth two shoes and everything else. Yeah, right. A lot of you right here today, right now, you made a lot of mistakes this week. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know it. And you know you need the blood of Christ to cleanse it. Amen. &gt;&gt; But here now, by this by this understanding, you can you can just move up a little higher on the enemy. You can have just one one more revelation and understanding because watch he goes on. He says now takes away your past sin has nothing to do with the future. Just your sin has been chopped off. What you did, you can't repent for what Adam done. You never done it. Adam did. You just get forgiveness for what you done. The old nature is still there. You still got your old nature. You know, &gt;&gt; you're going to fight the old nature and the new nature. inside of you is Jacob and Esau. You're going to struggle with that old nature until the rapture. You need to understand what the Holy Ghost can do for you in this hour. Because if you understand what he can do for you by the new birth, it just breaks the power of the enemy and all these things that try to affect your old nature, &gt;&gt; that try to bring you down, put you into depression, knock you back down, tell you you're not a son of God, you're not a daughter of God. Listen, if you are a son or a daughter of God, let's just get it straight right now. You were always a son or a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; You were lost in an amnesia. You came into this dimension and you had to be born as a human being and you come through a spiritual amnesia forgetting who you were until this message of the hour comes to you &gt;&gt; and then all of a sudden things start to open up and you start to see the word of God and you start to see things in the word like you never seen it before. You just can't understand why am I seeing this? Why is it so clear? because there was something already there &gt;&gt; that could be awakened from before the foundations of the world and it's now coming into manifestation. Amen. We are we are seeing here that your sins if you come to the water you're washed you're cleansed your old life is dead and if you've truly genuinely repented and taken on the name of Jesus Christ which is his life the Holy Ghost seals you it comes the gift now comes to you remember it's a gift God gives it to you not because you deserve it. He already knows that you that that you're going to go out there and you're going to make mistakes again. Your old nature is going to win some of the battles. Amen. Praise God. But we need to understand how this whole experience and you know brother Brandham you know he drew a diagram one time when when he was talking about you know explaining on the Holy Ghost and he drew this diagram on on the wall and and he drew a heart and in and he drew two different hearts and one had a snake in it and the other one had a dove in it and and one the snake was the the old nature. Amen. That's why when when we read in Ezekiel chapter 36, I will put in you a brand new heart. I will put in you my spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that he says, I'll give you a a heart of flesh. He will restore your heart. He will give you back to to the to the genuine uh uh anointing of the spirit of God, not that old nature that you were brought up under and all the influence of your, you know, your your your teachings, all your influence from generational spirits in your life, all the influences of your denominational teaching on the word of God, having no real clear understanding on what it is to be a Christian in this day and in this hour. And that snake has to be rooted out. &gt;&gt; Has to be completely taken out. That nature slowly starts to die out. Amen. Praise God. And that's why the second that's why baptism in water, it just simplifies you being washed or sanctified. water being a separation so that you can be used for the purpose of God. And what is it that God is going to sanctify you from? Let's listen to the quote here. Let's go to the next quote. He goes on here. He says, "Then secondly comes sanctification which sets our minds in order for holiness." Now pay attention. Holiness, remember, holiness is not being holier than anybody else. Holiness is being called and separated for the purpose of God. Important to understand that to think right, to actually have a clear understanding what it is that God wants to do in our lives. Take away sanctification is a compound Greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service. Then the next comes the baptism of the fire and the Holy Ghost that God might dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost inside. Then we bring forth the same life that this did because that's in us. See, God is letting you know that the bornag again experience is his spirit coming into you and completely possessing and your purpose now of what you thought you were purposed to accomplish in this life. all your ideas of what it meant to be a Christian as a denominational Christian and you know you're living a hypocritical life. You know that you you go to church on Sunday but you're a different person on Monday. He says no I'm going to change that that that when when when the Holy Ghost when I come in there your desires are going to be completely changed. That's how you'll know that something really happened. &gt;&gt; All your desire will be different. &gt;&gt; Your desire will no longer be for the for the things of the world. You'll you're it just it just you can't help it. There's a there's a new nature in you. &gt;&gt; The nature starts to take over. Now, it's a process. &gt;&gt; It's a process. It doesn't happen overnight. But we need to understand that that that's what the Holy Ghost is supposed to produce in my life. And that's why we can check ourselves to see is this what I have yielded myself to. Have I surrendered to to my own desires? Am I putting them aside? Am I not allowing my desires to to override the purpose of God? Because he's sanctifying you for one purpose. and he's sanctifying you of the things that are getting in his way on what he wants to accomplish through the word in you. Those are the things he's getting rid of in your life. Not that when you receive the Holy Ghost, you got to go and separate yourself from all your friends and all your family and and and you you know, you can't even work at the place anymore because they swear too much and what? You're holier than thou. That's not the separation he's talking about. He's talking about a cleansing and a sanctification that that that replaces your desires. &gt;&gt; And now your communication with your friends at work, with your family, with your all your friends and and your and it it's it's around him. It's displaying the life of God now on display. It's not your own life. It's a new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Let's read on. But now it has to go through. Now here he's talking about, you know, I I kind of uh, you know, skipped where he's talking about the earth. Now he's saying that every baptism, every birth, every individual goes through this process, including the earth had to go through this process in order to prepare for what he's preparing us for. But now it has to go through a baptism of fire, holy fire from God, which cleanses the earth and the heavens around it. God, remember, God was coming down to the earth to fulfill the plan that he originally started in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve were in the image of God, having full dominion that what they said would go. God having full supreme authority on the earth. This is what we're coming back to. And he goes on here and he says, "Then he says, it's purchased so that the redeemed can live on it. Live in it in peace." Notice the baptism of fire is to cleanse it from sin, from sickness, from disease, germs, from sinners, from the devil and all of his group. He is to be cast out into the lake of fire. Holy fire from God comes down from God out of heaven and burns it up. Notice it makes it ready for God to dwell in. &gt;&gt; And this is exactly the process that he does for you. He sends the Holy Ghost and fire to come in to take possession to burn out all the unbelief which is all your teachings, all your understandings, all your traditions of what you thought the word was supposed to produce. And now you're producing and preparing so that he can dwell in. Let's read on. for God in the new world that is to come is to dwell in the earth. Because you say God, he dwells in human hearts. But he and the bride becomes one. You see this whole process of the Holy Ghost coming upon the church in this hour is to identify you as Eve, as him in bride form. That's that's why he goes on here. He says, I'll read it again. And God, he dwells in the human heart. But he and the bride becomes one and they go to their home in the new world. And the same plan of redemption is used to redeem both world and persons that live in it. That's what he's doing. See, God and man uniting. That's why Jesus came to the earth. See the heart has to be cleansed like that before God can come down in the person of the Holy Ghost. The person of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming down and dwell in the human heart. It first must be repented. It must be baptized in water in his name to show who it who belongs who who it belongs to. That's why when you go and you take on the name of Christ, like a woman when she goes to the altar and she takes on her husband's name, it's identified that she belongs to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he belongs to her. She's taken on the one name which is the the name of Christ, which is the life of Christ, which is which is a brand new heaven and earth. Heaven, Christ, Earth, the bride becoming one. Praise God forever more. Let's go on. Acts 5:32. And we are his witnesses of these things. And notice what it says here. And so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. And what is it that we have come to obey? That we've come under the headship of the word for our day that we've repented from our old life, our own ideas, our own interpretation of the word of God. And we've taken on God's interpretation, God's desires, God's will for your life, God's purpose in calling you. When God when when God calls you, it's because he has a purpose for you. He has a desire to change you and place you into the body of Christ so that you can be put into service. Amen. Glory to God. Let's read on then. And from message desperations, he goes, "Then the life that was in Christ is the Holy Ghost." Not the third person, but the same person in the form of the Holy Spirit coming upon you as a token that your life and your fair is paid. You have been accepted. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the display of the token. People will know that you're not the same person that you were when you received the word for your day. You identify completely different. The reason why you're still in confusion and you don't fully understand is because you haven't found your true identity in this day and in this hour, what it is that you're supposed to produce. Amen. He says, now he says, now watch, he goes on and he says, until that token comes, you're not permitted on the highway. You're not permitted on the on the bus line. You're not permitted to go in until you can present this token, which is the Holy Ghost on display. And that token is your fair. And now it shows that the blood has been shed and has been applied to you. The price has been applied to you. And you have the token that the blood is applied to you and you're accepted. You get it now? Oh my. Now, now just not know certain evidence. See, don't be thinking that it's got to be an evidence. It's something. He says, you say, "Brother Brandom, I feel it in your minds." You see, with what? Why will Why will I know? He says, "Look what you what were you?" Pay attention here now. What were you and what are you? He's saying, "How you going to know? How you going to know that that the Holy Ghost has truly done something to change?" He says, "What were you and what are you now?" He goes, "And there there there is how you know." See what you were before this token was applied, what you are after it's applied, what was your desires before, and what is your desires after. &gt;&gt; Then you know whether the token is applied or not. And these other things just automatically go with that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You listen, we we don't want to make this difficult, but it's as simple as that. You know, you you want you want to you know, you want to check to see where you're at. You know, have you actually really received the change? Well, you tell me what you were back then before and you tell me what you are today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you one of these young people that goes to camp meetings every year and does a repeat every year of the same old thing and you haven't gone any further down the road with him? If you're still the person that you were a year ago today, there's something wrong. You need to go back and check to see if you've progressed in the word and the Holy Ghost is changing you, &gt;&gt; changing your desires, &gt;&gt; got you coming into the house of the Lord on a regular basis. Got you fellowshipping with other young people, looking for opportunity to share this word to with other young people when you're at school. It really shows if the zeal of God, if the fire of God is in you, it's going to be a token that's going to be on display. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be something that you you're going to hide it. You come here, you put your your skirts on when you come on Sunday, but you put your pants on when you go on Tuesday. You're not going to fool God. There's a genuine change. You were some you were a certain way, now you're changed. You're not the same way anymore. Praise God. And you need to obey that call on your life. If if it's truly there, then it's time to surrender. Then it's time to make the effort. You need to you need to overcome. The Bible says in the in this last age, to them that overcome will I grant to sit with me in the throne. &gt;&gt; Do you know that the bride is already seated with him in the throne? the ones that have overcome. &gt;&gt; She's been given the ability to loose and to bind. &gt;&gt; She's been given the power to speak the word of God. I'm not talking about arrogance here. I'm talking about an understanding on the word of God where you are, where God has placed you in the body of Christ. Do you know? Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? Is there a genuine change? And is that change continuing in your life? Amen. Praise God. We need to understand that. Let's read the next scripture from Titus chapter 3:es 3:5. We're talking about the Holy Ghost producing a new birth. And when the new birth genuinely takes place, there's genuine change. In Titus 3:es 3-5, it says, "For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving diverse lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another." You know that there's people in this message that are still in this condition. Churches breaking up. People not associating with other churches. ministers not associating with other ministers because of because they they because of their own pride &gt;&gt; because of their own pride their own you know listen if we if if I disagree with something with somebody else it's not my business unless God shows me to personally go to the individual and speak to that individual that pastor or that individual if God shows in in that in that way God has has a way of doing things. Otherwise, I don't need to I don't need to place any any kind of an interpretation on that person. &gt;&gt; I'm going to let God interpret it himself. &gt;&gt; I don't have to worry about what I preach from here. I I got to trust God in the gift that he's placed and the inspiration that he puts on me that he's going to meet your needs. &gt;&gt; That's that's all that that's all that's on my heart. If there's anything, God knows that my heart is sincere. When I say, "Lord, I I I I don't know what to bring to the people. But if you will come and you will meet their needs, that's that that that's all I can that's all I can ask for." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Open my understanding. Give me the revelation that I need that your people need. &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm responsible for. I'm not responsible to go and correct other pastors. The word will correct them. They will hear the word just like you hear the word. And the faith cometh by what? Hearing the word. And whatever God is doing in this hour and how he's dealing with, you know, with individuals, that's God's business. &gt;&gt; It's not our business. But people are still in this condition. It goes to show that there's no real change yet that's taken place &gt;&gt; because what? But after that, the kindness and love of God our savior towards man appeared. And that's the Holy Ghost, the message of the hour. Not by works of righteousness. It's not what you did. Remember this gift of the Holy Ghost. It's not because you deserve it. It's not because you you did anything for it. It's don't put your works on it. You know, that's what the Catholics do. Oh, if I go to church and I light so many candles and I say so many Hail Marys and I do so many That's total deception. They're actually putting their faith in works. And there it says real clear here, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost. What is that? by a new birth. &gt;&gt; Regeneration is your mind taking on the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Your desires taking on his desires, &gt;&gt; his purpose, his will in your life. &gt;&gt; A true genuine birth. &gt;&gt; Go to the next slide here. I read this last week. He says, "You that wants the Holy Spirit, you that wants that experience, not an emotional excitement, I'm not here to try and emotionally get you uh excited. I'm not here to try and and and and convince you and scare you. This is not about scaring our young people. You better get the Holy Ghost." You can't get it unless he's going to give it to you. But you need to understand what it is so that you can so that you're not in a confused state of mind on what the Holy Ghost actually is and what he wants to produce in your life. You can live an absolutely normal young beautiful life as a young person and enjoy this world and enjoy marriage and enjoy relationships in the Holy Ghost. when you come to understand that that's what he desires for you. Amen. But it comes by a new birth. We need to understand that there's a new birth. He says not an emotional excitement. You want the Holy Ghost, the life, the germ of life inside you. And you want to get rid of that amnesia that's making you that you can't identify yourself. You see, the moment you receive the Holy Ghost, it identifies you where you're supposed to be, why you're in this church, why you believe God sent a prophet, why you believe in the opening of the seven seals, why you understand that you got to take the book and eat the book and and and that that and that you and that you've actually been given the commission to to prophesy. Prophesy what? The word. He's told you to eat the word. Take the word. Understand the word. Receive him. He says, "You can't identify yourself. You don't know where you stand. You don't know what you are. Let's get rid of it right now." Hallelujah. There is a new birth here for you. A real genuine new birth. That's what God is telling us today. Amen. Let's let's finish up here. Couple of more quotes. Amen. Listen, I I take a lot of quotes from the prophet because he was the messenger for our day that restored the truth of the word of God back into our hearts. That's why we quote him. We don't quote him because he's the absolute. No, no. William Brham is not the absolute. William Branham was the prophet of Malachi 4:5, the messenger of Revelations 101:7. Amen. He was the messenger that was on the earth when the mighty angel came down in 1963 to open to to bring to us the open book so that we could receive our new birth. That's where you receive the new birth. Amen. We're going to Amen. This is what caught my attention. The Holy Ghost is the word of God in you that identifies itself by accepting that word. I'm going to read it again. Remember, it's recognizing your word. the day that you're living in. The Holy Ghost is the word of God in you that identifies itself by accepting that word. Outside of that, it can't be the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. People come to you and say, "You can be baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. You can be baptiz then then you can be baptized in the in the in the name of the Rosa Sharon because that he's also known as the Rosa Sharon. He's known as the lily of the valley. But the book of Acts shows 8,000 baptisms and every single one of them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You can't show me one baptism any other way in the scripture. And if the Holy Ghost is in you, and he says, I'll send you the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, and he will guide you into all truth. And you're going to tell me that the Holy Ghost is going to go against his own word. Can't do it. If it's not, if it's listen, cannot be the Holy Spirit. That's the evidence whether you believe or not if the word in you responds to the word. Amen. Next slide. I heard brother Neville say uh this morning someone might have been asking him, "Why don't I preach on the Holy Ghost?" They were, you know, somebody had asked brother Neville, "Why isn't brother Brandon preaching on the Holy Ghost?" He goes, "Why didn't I do this?" Here it is. The Holy Ghost is in the action is in the action in you. That's what the Holy Ghost is. When you see your life being transformed. Amen. It's the action that's that that that's in you. Amen. And it's it's a life, not an emotion, not some sort of fleshly evidence, but it is a person. Jesus Christ, the word of God established in your heart to quicken every word of this age. &gt;&gt; I'm going to repeat that, right? He says it. But it is the person Jesus Christ, the word of God established in your heart to quicken every word of this age. In other words, your life will display the message of the hour. You can't you can't deny God sent a prophet because the Holy Ghost can never deny his own word. You can't deny that the seals were open in 1963. You can't deny that that God has has given us the open book. Amen. And given us an understanding that we're to take the book which is the word for this day and this hour. Amen. People are afraid of the book of Revelation. But we're not afraid of it because the revelation, the book of Revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ. And you are the revelation of Jesus Christ when you receive the word in your day and you display it to the people in the 20 in 2025. Hallelujah. Praise God forever more. Amen. Let's read on. He says in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 11-16 he says for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him. Even so this is how we understand the Holy Ghost. Even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God, which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches. Okay? We're not interested in man's wisdom and teachings and everything. That's what we've been saying here. But we're interested. He says, "But which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual, but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. For he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. What is the mind of Christ? The Holy Ghost. What is the Holy Ghost? The word for your day. What is the word for your day going to do? What God wants purposed in your life. What God has purposed for this church, for the mystical body of Jesus Christ. He's never going to alter his desire for yours. So your desires must change. They must be for the word of God. Amen. And we're going to close on this uh last quote here from Sriian Church age. He says, "Now before I close this subject, now we need to understand about predestination." Okay? Because a lot of people say, "Oh, so what you're saying is that you're just, you know, God just chose you and and uh you know, uh God didn't choose him." No, that's not what it meant. predestination by fornowledge. God saw where his word would would end up. God saw where his seed, you know about the parable of the seed and some seed fell on good ground. And God by the grace of God seed fell into some good ground here this morning because you can recognize you wouldn't be able to see this unless the seed was in you. You wouldn't understand what I'm preaching this morning unless there was a deep inside of you already able to respond the the Holy Ghost in you responding to the word of God. Amen. He says, he says, "Now, I know there's a question in your minds. You will want to know if I believe in the doctrine of pre-existence. I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of pre-existence of souls any more than I believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of souls." Be careful here and see this. It is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God. It is the word not the person. So don't look at people. Understand that in the mind of God before the foundations of the world you were a thought. You were a thought and a thought when it is expressed it becomes the word. It becomes word expressed in that particular age. And that's what God was doing all the way from Genesis to Revelation. He was manifesting himself in different manifestations of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament and now in the hol as the Holy Ghost in the New Testament. Amen. Interpreting himself. So it's not the seed, it's not the individual, it's not the person, it's the word that you had representation from before the foundations of the world. Pay attention. That is it. Way back there, too far back for the human mind to grasp. The eternal God with eternal thoughts thought and decreed, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated in Romans 9:13. And neither was born, they weren't even born yet. And God turns around and says, I hate Esau and I love Jacob. Why? because he knew the word that was in him was was represented and identified as Jacob not Esau. Hallelujah. And so here now see it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and God brought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed. Jacob alone. Next slide. Jacob alone had the seed. Let the musicians come. That is why he had respect to the birthright and covenant of God. There's something in you that when you hear this word, you're not going to just walk out of the church and forget about it. Something will awaken inside of you and will want the right birth. And that's what Jacob desired. That's what was in Jacob. Amen. If you are true seed, you will hear that word. The spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ, filling you and empowering you, and you will receive the word for your day and age. Did you hear that? You will receive the word for your day and your age. Hallelujah. See how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you. Again, note Jesus was the royal seed. He lived in a human body. When the spirit called to him, the word manifested thought. He went to Jordan and was there baptized in water, obeying the word. The Holy Spirit came upon him. And the voice said, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye him." The voice did not say, "This has become my son." Glory. Hallelujah. When God says, "You are my son. You are my daughter." You don't just become a son or a daughter of God. You were always a son or daughter of God, but you were under amnesia. You didn't know it. You were lost in sin. You were lost under tradition. You were lost in the teachings of man. But now God has given you the word to awaken you to the message of this hour. &gt;&gt; That he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. Then having been filled thus and the same pattern holds at Pentecost and ever after he went in demonstrated power receiving the full revelation of God and from God for that day. Now, we have been constantly saying that the true evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost is for the believer to receive the word for the age in which he lives. Glory to God. Hallelujah. I've received I've received a message. Glory to God. We've received a word in this day that that that can change your life. You don't need to remain the same way. You can leave here today, this Sunday. You can leave and you can start a fresh. You can understand now why why he wants to take control. Why he wants to purge you. He wants to sanctify you. What he's sanctifying you from. He's sanctifying you from the things that are that are distracting you from his will and his purpose for your life. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. I'm ready to move on up to another dimension right now. Glory to God. Amen. I'm ready to receive the the Holy Ghost power that's going to translate. Listen, if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you, it's going to quicken you. &gt;&gt; It's going to translate you. It's going to move you. I'm ready to move. I move on up to another dimension. I'm ready to change. Relocate to another location. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat.

Amen. &gt;&gt; See, that's the Holy Ghost's power and purpose that you know, a couple months ago, the enemy wanted to take him down. Amen. But God's power in the Holy Ghost has a purpose and a plan, and it will override sickness. It'll override whatever the enemy throws at us. We will need to overcome. We will need to heal. But it's assured because he will never ever ever fail. &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth will pass but my word shall never pass away. Amen. Praise God. How many know that we have a special speaker next Sunday. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got brother Marcus Becker coming all the way from Germany who will be ministering for us next Sunday. Keep him in prayer and let's let's you know, he doesn't know us. He's never been here. But let the Holy Spirit, let the Holy Ghost have his way. Amen. Let him speak to our hearts and our lives. Come with expectation. You'll go rejoicing. I promise you. Amen. Praise God.
