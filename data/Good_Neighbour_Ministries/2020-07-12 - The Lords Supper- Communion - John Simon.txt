TRANSCRIPT
========================================
brothers and sisters in christ wherever you are whoever you are i come to you in the name of our lord jesus christ may the great great holy spirit bless us all for we truly appreciate him and his help and teaching may the lord jesus christ receive all the glory and the praise blessed be his holy name we are gathered together to partake of the lord's supper this we do in remembrance of him as we have been commanded and as the apostles also practiced may the great holy spirit bless us all let us pray before we read our scripture our gracious heavenly father we thank thee for thy word we ask thy blessing upon this congregation we ask your blessing upon your called out ones we call your blessing upon the glorious assembly of god the firstborn from on high take all your glory lord and speak to your children in the name of jesus christ amen and amen reading from first corinthians 11 verses 23 to 25 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sucked saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this new ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me now brothers and sisters we are here to talk about the lord's supper and together around the lord's table of course the lord's supper tells us a wonderful story it is the story of redemption that we can see in the emblems that the lord himself gave to us that whenever we look at them whenever we partake of them whenever we are together in fellowship we do this in remembrance of him because it tells us the story of how a savior came from glory came and died upon the calvary's cross how he purchased a redemption it tells the story these very emblems tell the story if we have the mind and the instruction of god to understand these emblems also point to the person of this story and that person is none other than the lord jesus christ for he is the center of all things he is the wheel in the middle of the wheel he is the one that controls all things and he is the beginning he is the ending he is the same yesterday today and forever he is all in all and the entire story of redemption it just centers around him as he is the central figure of this entire story and the lord's supper speaks of him the lord's supper also my brothers and sisters reveals the bride as the purpose of the story why did jesus come why did he leave the ivory palaces of glory to come to sinful earth what was his mission what was his the purpose of him fulfilling the word it was that he might come and redeem his bride who were in the devil's pawnshop of sin and so the bride is the purpose that made him leave the glory of heaven and come into this sin curse world for you and i i am so happy today that this savior this jesus this great redeemer thought about us and came to redeem us by his precious blood hallelujah glory to god amen these emblems points to this great time of the calling out of the bride we're taking the lord's supper and as we take it may we meditate upon these things how blessed we are how privileged we are how honored we are that the king will come to save beggars beggars apparently beggars slaves apparently slaves my brothers but underneath that exterior there lives within that human body a chosen one part of the body of christ the bride of jesus christ the called out once the ecclesia of god the real new jerusalem the bright church of the living god in the last day for whom he shed his blood oh the father planned the savior bled and died and now the holy spirit is here executing the plan to bring forth as i say to you now this lord's supper also points to the consummation of this story what a beautiful ending story a what a story of love and redemption of how the prince of glory came to redeem a captive bride and to take her out from the prison doors the prisons and the walls of sin and to bring her out and take her back to his father's house for in my father's house there were many mansions and so we see this this this story has a beautiful ending where the bride and the bright groom the prince of life and his wife the story ends with them living happily ever after within the millennial kingdom of god and after that into the eternities you never ending eternities way beyond tomorrow in the very presence of almighty god oh what a day what an hour i live for the great hour of the manifestation of the fullness of the word and therefore when we come for this lord's supper we do not come with sadness we do not come with weeping and wailing but we come to have a celebration oh this lord's supper is a celebration of his life and of ours his life in us we celebrate this fact that god has come to take his home and his dominion within our hearts and life aren't you happy aren't you glad that out of one in a million he called you out of the my reclaim when a million people perished under the trolls of sin satan and suffering at the same time he brought you out and he unveiled you that you are part of him and actually you are a part of him revealed all things beyond a god oh for this marvelous and wonderful deposit this gift that was given to us from before the foundation of the world and because it's eternal in us we can never die for he delivered and believeth on me shall never die thanks be the god hallelujah may the spirit of almighty god live in our hearts now and forevermore this is a great celebration we are here for the lord supper this is a festival a festival a feast praise the lord that we are here for we are not here to fast i said we are not here to fast but we are here to feast and when we eat the bread and we drink the wine we think of the supernatural spiritual feast now upon the revealed word of god and the quickening power of the spirit of god that comes upon that word and makes it live again and that places us also at the great supper time we shall have in heaven with all the saints of all the ages oh blessed be the name of the lord most high glory god so we are here for a festival oh praise god be a here for a feast and not for a fast may god help you to feast upon this fact upon this word of god here today and may your sin so rejoice in him the lord god your savior as mary's soul rejoiced in the lord praise his marvelous and wonderful name this lord sappa is also a sacrifice but not because it's a sacrifice where we see him hanging on the cross dying on the cross being pierced on the cross being mocked scuffed up spat upon while he was on the cross but we with our open eyes can now see that that which appeared because remember my brother sister that this symbol my friends we see here this symbol the sacrificial symbol following all the substitutes until him hanging on the rear as the reality upon that cross to the true believer with open eyes we see it as a scene of joy we see it as a scene of victory the lord's supper represents his victory his glorious victory in his love divine for us to bring us back to himself for god was in christ redeeming the world unto himself glory be to god forevermore hallelujah amen thanks be to god yes sir we know that this lord's supper also is not a symbol of shame for hanging on a cross in the time of israel back there back in the old days my friends was a sign of shame it was a sign of being a criminal an outcast from society one that was rejected they were not realizing they were rejecting the chief cornerstone they were rejecting the keystone they were rejecting the foundation stone they were for uh rejecting the capstone oh praise god the glorious stone that god said i lay in zion a cornerstone a beautiful stone and jesus christ is that stone that rock of all ages that ever present what rock that gives up ever living water life-giving water for the soul of the true believer hallelujah so this hanging on the cross this lord suffered to us is not a symbol of shame but a great symbol of glory hallelujah it's a symbol of glory it's a glorious symbol praise god hallelujah can you see it it's not shame but it's glory praise god hallelujah lord god amen so when we look we don't just see punishment punishment on that cross we don't just see that yes yes uh oh praise god hallelujah according to isaiah how did the lord have placed upon him the inequity of us all and isaiah said the lord struck him amen god struck him he bore our sins god struck him but we do not see just the fact that god struck him and he took the punishment but we see our glorious relief a release because the day he was punished that was the day we were set free for he became poor that we may become rich he becomes sin that we may become the righteousness of god hallelujah oh he went to a devil's hell that we might avoid it praise god he took her place at calvary so that justice may be able to be fulfilled and the wrath of god can pass over you and i and we can come into the volley before the troll of god under the blood of christ in the name of the lord jesus christ set free by this great thing that happened upon golgotha's hill so the lord's supper is more than just seeing the bread and the wine but it's seeing the revelation the understanding behind the symbolism of the bread and wine the lord support hallelujah praise god we see it with our open eyes and realize that it's not just seeing the punishment but seeing that precious one that set us free by his precious blood praise god our eyes have been opened have your eyes been opened my eyes have been opened i believe it our eyes have been opened by the revelation of god we have accepted the dabbing of the i saw the cross our eyes by prophetic hands that has open our eyes to recognize the word of god for their hour and for this day what a hour praise god hallelujah oh my we look at them at him hanging on the cross and let me say this we do not only see punishment but we see atonement we see that we come back to end at one met with god we have come back to oneness with god hallelujah glory to god god and i walking down life's road together walking in a fellowship in the union once again like he did with adam and eve when he came down at the evening time at the cool of the day to have fellowship with them and hear the end of the world here he comes again the mighty god in christ to have fellowship with his beloved sons and daughters here in the evening time once again this is the evening time it's later than you think and god keeps all of his appointments and here he descends by the opening of seven seals and presents himself to his people that we might recognize that we are a redeemed people we are a atonement a people that have received a tall man and we have come back into reconciliation with god the fellowship that was broken has been restored our joy of salvation has been restored our union with him has been restored how happy can we be to recognize the shining of this heavenly sunshine in the dark caverns of our souls and bringing us light and we may become children of the light who walk no more in darkness and ignorance but having in us the light of life praise god hallelujah for in us god has placed a tabernacle for the son o glory god who resides in his residence within the hearts of the true believer thanks be to god hallelujah amen this lord's supper also is symbolic and points to the bond of brotherhood of all believers of all time all nations all places of all ages one loaf one cup one god one baptism one one one oneness praise god the unity of god's people in him knowing that he is in us and we are in him praise god hallelujah the great revelation of the mystery of god that brings us to a place where we can say like paul oh i wish i could make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery what is the revelation what is the fellowship that this revelation of the mystery of god gives to us it brings us into an invisible union with christ and with each other and praise god we have communion with him and we also have communion with each other the fellowship of all the saints of all the ages don't you think the scripture is real where paul said we are encompassed with my friends a cloud a great cloud of witnesses don't you think when we come together to celebrate and to have a festival of the lord's supper that they are observing and watching what we are doing and are happy and rejoicing in heaven that they have caught the revelation of the last prophet's message they've caught the revelation of who jesus christ is this caught the revelation of the true water baptism they've caught the revelation of the opening of the word the calling out of their names they have caught the revelation of the things that are going to be and they are fully aware of the modern events causing them to look up for the redemption snare for their recognized modern events being made clear by the vindicated prophecy of the son of god that he sent as his messenger in this age and in this hour praise the lord so when we come to the lord's table let us be conscious and aware we are not alone but we are encompassed by this great innurable host this great this great cloud of witnesses oh please god that are rejoicing along with us and we are in fellowship with those saints according to the word of god shall i read now which out of revelation chapter 19 verses 5 to 9. and the voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all his servants and ye that fear him both small and great and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of many thunderings mighty thundering saying hallelujah hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reign it let us be glad and rejoice and give honor unto him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of god hallelujah thanks be to god for being called to the marriage supper of the lamb of which this is only a pre-figure of that which is to come the lord's supper that we partake of praise god oh hallelujah prefigures the marriage supper that is to come this great supper of the lamb praise god so this communion this great fellowship will come to its fullness when we are together again [Music] in our father's house now the family of god is scattered here and there as one songwriter says but lord we love them there and wherever they are we love them dearly oh god where whichever so-called pastor denomination church group wherever they are we know salvation is not a mass event but it is an if individual affair of god speaking to our hearts and our prayer today and our work and our mission our zeal and our desire is to find our brothers and sisters your loved ones your hidden ones your chosen ones wherever they are father and bring them to attention of your word so that we can go together and meet again in our father's house meet them in the morning by the eastern gate where they will be rejoicing and praising the lord hallelujah then brother sister we know then with all these truths that the lord's supper is a solemn affair it's joyful but it's something sober and solemn and this observance of the lord's supper is not based on the matter of our moods on any certain day well i i have a bad mood i don't feel like taking the lord's supper today or i am not feeling well or this and that happened in my life so today i'm going to take a pass it's not a casual affair are identifying yourself with christ regardless of how you feel how you your body feels your mind feels your spirit feels it has nothing to do with your moods or your condition because he can make you whole in every area and every part of your life if you come to him and turn your life completely to him and recognize what these symbols here represents my friends the lord's supper is not based upon emotions though it has a lot of emotions in it it is not based as i've said before upon our feelings or upon our moods but it is based upon our obedience in the words of word of god for the lord himself has said unto us this do in remembrance of me so it is a command it is friends something we must do in obedience to him it is our christian duty to obey the word of god it is also a privilege for by doing this but coming to the lord supper you are pointing symbolizing prophetically that you are one that will be sitting at the lord's table uh oh praise god and eternities to come partaking of the marriage supper of the lamb oh what a privilege my friends blessed are you to hear the words of this book blessed are your ears blessed by your eyes to hear and to see and to know him in the power of his resurrection lord of god hallelujah i want to say to you my brothers and sisters if your covenant of commitment and of consecration has been broken you may renew it now as the scripture has said let a man or a woman examine themselves and let them drink it's a counting time take account of yourself take stock of yourself people of god children of the lord my brothers and sisters wherever you are take account of yourself search your hearts and if you are not certain of your memory and of your ability to search your own heart say search me o lord and see if there be any wicked way in me o lord and set me free let this be your prayer praise god hallelujah the lord's supper is also a reminder that if we have forgotten let us remember that the lord's supper is the seal of the on the covenant of grace that god has given unto us you know in natural life the use and purpose of a seal if you have ever dealt with a lawyer a notary public and you had to have some official document with you and they were to place their seal on it you realize that the use and purpose of a a seal an official seal is to attest to the truth of the matter it is to certify the valid validity or praise god of that will it is to make you sure and certain of the reliability of all that is written or said by the document praise god hallelujah and that seal is always fixed to the document and thank god that the holy spirit the white horse rider rides upon the word of god and so the seal is fixed amen upon the document of the word of the living god hallelujah amen yes sir so the symbol of this seal of the bread and of the wine the symbol of the blood of this sacrifice brothers and sisters is to remind us don't you worry about anything the price of the mortgage for your family home before your father left or died and went away oh glory to god he made sure before he died and went away that he left a lawyer that can give you a a document sealed with seven seals and that the seals with a test will validate with vindicate my friends it will let you know for sure that you are a beneficiary and that the mortgage for your mansion your heaven your father's house was paid for before he left here praise god so the father is showing to us that his word is valid hallelujah and is a witness the seal is a witness to his past sacrifice and all of his labors that he labored in the pits of hell to bring out the souls that were imprisoned then oh glory to god hallelujah and so my friends we see that the seal that is to remind us that he purchased the home and he purchases lived in it and has left it for his beloved his loved ones as any father would do glory to god hallelujah amen so the lord's supper is an assurance of blessed assurance to us that the debt is paid the mortgage is paid and speaks of his purchase of our redemption praise god hallelujah not only of our heavenly home but he paid the mortgage for this person this body this house oh praise god we're redeemed by the purchase but i'm purchased by the blood of christ and we are his purchased possession so let us celebrate the lord's supper amen by faith in our hope of glory i said by our faith in our hope of glory praise god hallelujah amen so here we are as i'm about to uh merge from this uh little sermon and talk into having performing the lord's supper the bread and the wine may we prepare our hearts and prepare our minds hallelujah brothers and sisters i thank god that this lets us know that we are living under god's rainbow promised hallelujah amen god's multi-colored rainbow promise we are living under that bow amen and we recognize it is god's token of his protective presence above us with us and now in us may the lord bless you may the lord bless you in your rising up in your going out and in your coming in in the name of our lord jesus christ and may we now partake and participate in having the lord's supper together the lord bless you [Music] now i want to pause briefly and ask you wherever you are my brother my sister search your heart before god and ask him to wash you and cleanse you even from unconscious unknown and unpremeditated sins and cleanse you make you white as snow before me i have the elements the bread and the wine which represents his body broken for you and his blood shed for
