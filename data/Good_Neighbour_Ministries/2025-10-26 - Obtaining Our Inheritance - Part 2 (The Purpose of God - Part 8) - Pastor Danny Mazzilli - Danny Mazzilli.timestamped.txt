[9:37] [music]
[9:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God. [music]
[9:53] Let's give God an applause.
[10:00] Um,
[10:02] we're going to be reading from Psalm 37,
[10:05] but just like 16 verses, [music] not all
[10:08] of them. And I would like to do it a
[10:11] little more interactive today. So when I
[10:15] speak the first [music] verse, you read
[10:17] the second verse until on the 16th. We
[10:19] all read it together. Amen. Okay. Psalm
[10:23] 637
[10:24] verse one.
[10:26] Fret not [music] thyself because of
[10:29] evildoers,
[10:30] neither be thou envious [music]
[10:33] against the workers of iniquity.
[10:36] The congregation read the next verse.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; Trust in the Lord and do good. So shalt
[10:48] thou dwell [music] in the land and very
[10:51] thou shalt be fed.
[11:00] Commit thy way unto the Lord. Trust also
[11:03] in him, and it shall bring it to pass.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for
[11:18] him. Fred not thyself because [music] of
[11:21] him who prospered in his way. Because of
[11:24] the man who bringeth wicked devices to
[11:26] pass.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; For evildoers shall be cut off, but
[11:38] those that wait upon the Lord, [music]
[11:40] they shall inherit the earth.
[11:45] [music]
[11:52] But the meek shall inherit the earth and
[11:55] all and shall delight themselves in
[11:58] [music] the abundance of peace.
[12:07] The Lord shall laugh at him for he said
[12:09] that his day [music] is coming.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; [music]
[12:23] &gt;&gt; Their sword shall enter into their own
[12:25] [music] heart and their bows shall be
[12:27] broken.
[12:29] Let's all read the last one to be verse
[12:31] 16.
[12:32] A little that a righteous man heart is
[12:35] better than riches of the [music] many
[12:36] wicked. Amen. Enjoy the rest of the
[12:40] service. God bless you all, brother
[12:42] Anthony. See
[12:56] [music]
[13:03] tribute of God.
[13:09] [music]
[13:10] My skin [singing] with him.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; He hides beneath my skin.
[13:18] [music] Before the world was
[13:23] time,
[13:25] [music]
[13:25] &gt;&gt; I always was a [singing]
[13:30] great Let's sing that one more time. I'm
[13:32] an attribute of God. I'm an attitude
[13:35] [music] of God. [singing]
[13:37] A child of the king.
[13:41] [music] My life is in pain.
[13:45] He hides beneath my skin.
[13:49] Before the world was born
[13:53] before [music and singing] time began,
[13:56] I always was a father. [music]

[14:18] [music]
[14:19] I'm a child of the king. [singing]
[14:23] &gt;&gt; [music]
[14:23] &gt;&gt; And so now I see
[14:27] I was always there [singing]
[14:34] and that has no stain
[14:37] to the children of the gain.
[14:41] The price was paid [music] on Calories
[14:44] [singing]
[14:45] Hill
[14:48] [music]
[14:49] of Hell
[14:52] to set the C [music] is free
[14:57] [singing]
[14:57] and separate us from the love [music] he
[15:01] has free
[15:04] yesterday.
[15:06] [music and singing]
[15:08] my for tomorrow
[15:11] et [music and singing]
[15:15] [music]
[15:22] now I [music] see
[15:25] I was always see
[15:30] where were you where were you [music]
[15:34] and the morning sun shine
[15:37] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[15:37] &gt;&gt; together.
[15:39] I was there. Where were you [music] when
[15:43] the sons of God shouted [singing]
[15:46] for joy? I [music] was there.
[15:50] Oh yes, I was there. [music]

[16:06] I will sing. Where were you [music]
[16:10] when the sons of God shouted for joy? I
[16:15] was there. [music]
[16:17] Oh yes, I was [singing] there.
[16:21] I [music] was always there.
[16:25] Not yesterday.
[16:28] Not [music] yesterday.
[16:32] God for tomorrow.
[16:35] Eternally
[16:36] is [music] my life.
[16:41] I'm a [music] child of the king.
[16:45] And so now I see
[16:49] I was always [music] here.
[16:52] Not just today.
[16:54] Oh, [music] not yesterday.

[17:09] I'm a child of the king.
[17:13] And [music] so now I see

[17:30] again. Amen. We're in a journey. [music]
[17:32] The song was written right in our
[17:34] assembly here. You know, throughout the
[17:36] Bible, they would [music] write songs
[17:38] about their experiences. David, after
[17:40] you have a great battle, we would write
[17:41] songs to remind himself of what God have
[17:43] done for him. Amen. And God has given
[17:45] [music] us this wonderful song to remind
[17:47] us who we are this morning. Amen. I was
[17:50] always there with him.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Give him a hand clap this morning.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[17:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you Lord.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; I read a scripture yesterday.
[18:00] Ecclesiastes is talking about after then
[18:03] the the dust shall return to the earth
[18:06] [music] as it was and the spirit shall
[18:08] return back unto God who give it.
[18:11] Attribute of God is inside of us and
[18:13] he's revealing himself this morning unto
[18:14] us. Amen. If it wasn't
[18:19] for the grace,
[18:22] for the grace of God, my life, [music]
[18:29] where would I [singing]
[18:31] be [music]
[18:32] today?
[18:36] How would I have done with my life?
[18:42] [music] It was not
[18:45] who had saw it, but [music] it was Jesus
[18:52] who had sold [music] me. His kind of
[18:55] love
[18:57] to me [singing] was

[19:23] Where [music] would I be
[19:27] today?
[19:30] Why would I have nothing? [music]
[19:34] I was so lost. I was so lost.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; [music]
[19:39] &gt;&gt; and blinded
[19:42] walking in the darkness.
[19:46] My God. [music] Oh my God.
[19:51] Greatest indeed in [music and singing]
[19:53] me
[19:54] is
[19:56] to walk [music] in his love.

[20:07] for the grace
[20:10] for the grace of God [music] in my life.
[20:16] Where will I [singing] be [music]
[20:20] today?
[20:23] What would I [singing]
[20:25] have done [music] in my life?

[28:14] Oh father, we thank you Lord

[28:21] by your grace.
[28:24] Grace [music]
[28:25] called us.
[28:27] Grace placed us.
[28:30] Grace is perfecting us in this hour.
[28:33] Amazing grace, oh God. How sweet the
[28:37] sound, Lord.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; The message of grace,
[28:41] oh God. And we understand [music]
[28:43] that your prophet said that grace gives
[28:46] us the ability to do your will, Father.
[28:50] Lord, we're here this morning, Lord, to
[28:52] do your will, Father. Lord, and your
[28:55] will is your word, Lord. Let the word
[28:59] have [music] preeminence, Lord, this
[29:00] morning, Father. Lord, we come in here
[29:03] with a week [music] of trials, a week of
[29:07] temptation, a week of being tested,
[29:10] Lord. A week of ups and downs, a week of
[29:13] making mistakes, Lord, doing things that
[29:17] maybe are not right, Father. But Lord,
[29:19] we come this morning, Father, through
[29:22] the blood of Jesus Christ. Lord, you
[29:24] said if we come through the b the blood
[29:27] boldly, we can enter your throne this
[29:30] morning, Lord, and ask what we have need
[29:32] of, Lord. Lord, you said seek the
[29:34] kingdom of God first and his
[29:36] righteousness, and all things shall be
[29:38] added unto us, oh God. Lord, we're not
[29:41] here to seek for things of this world,
[29:43] Lord. Father, we we have given a promise
[29:47] by you, Lord. That Lord, even you when
[29:50] you were here on earth, you said you
[29:52] have little faith. You [music] can't
[29:54] believe for the natural things. How you
[29:56] going to believe for the spiritual
[29:58] things, Lord? We know you're going to
[30:00] take care of our bodies, Lord. Lord,
[30:02] that that the healing is the children's
[30:04] bread, Lord. If we need healing, it's in
[30:07] the camp this morning. If we need
[30:09] deliverance, it's in the camp this
[30:11] morning.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Oh God, because you're in the camp this
[30:15] morning, Father, Lord, we need a devil
[30:18] cast out, it's in the camp this morning.
[30:21] Because where the spirit of the Lord is,
[30:23] there is liberty this morning, Father.
[30:26] Lord, have your way this morning. It's
[30:28] not about us. It's not about gifts. It's
[30:31] not about positions, oh God, and who we
[30:34] think we are. It's about you this
[30:36] morning. Father, come in our midst, oh
[30:39] God, and and stir the waters, Lord. May
[30:42] that mighty angel come and stir our
[30:45] hearts this morning, and stir the
[30:47] waters. Stir the atmosphere, Father.
[30:50] [music]
[30:51] Oh God, bind every demon power that
[30:54] would come of unbelief in here this
[30:56] morning, Lord. This is where the sons
[30:58] and daughters of God have liberty this
[31:01] morning. and celebrate our Lord Jesus
[31:04] Christ. Oh God, in the word that will
[31:07] come forth this morning, Lord, that's
[31:09] why we worship, Lord. That's why we
[31:12] praise you, Lord, is because we know a
[31:15] word is coming forth this morning that's
[31:18] going to change us and set us at liberty
[31:21] because you have promised when I sent
[31:23] forth my word, hallelujah, I'll heal the
[31:27] land. I'll heal the people. My words are
[31:30] spirit and life. I'll give life this
[31:33] morning. And that's what your bride
[31:35] wants this morning. Is the very life of
[31:39] God, the token this morning to manifest
[31:43] in her life. More and more of you,
[31:46] Father. Bless each and every one. Lord,
[31:49] oh God, bless them this morning. It's
[31:51] not just saying bless them, but bless
[31:54] them Lord God that they may enter in
[31:57] Lord that they may let go and let God
[32:00] have his way in their hearts this
[32:02] morning. That they may open up their
[32:04] hearts and be like Mary. Be it unto me
[32:08] according to thy word, according to thy
[32:10] spirit and thy working in this morning,
[32:13] oh God. And as your word would come
[32:15] forth, Father, oh God, set the man at
[32:18] liberty. The man is not just a man. The
[32:21] man of God this morning at liberty.
[32:24] Lord, just speak your word, Father. Put
[32:27] a wall of fire and a hedge around him
[32:29] from the fiery darts of the enemy. Lord,
[32:32] shield them and protect them, Lord, that
[32:34] that word may come forth this morning.
[32:37] And Lord, bless us. It's not only the
[32:40] song leader and the musicians this
[32:41] morning, but it's all of us together.
[32:44] Bless the worship this morning, Lord.
[32:47] Set us at liberty, Lord. Lord, rebuke
[32:50] every nonpraising demon, oh God. Lord,
[32:53] and let us recognize this morning, Lord
[32:55] God, what you have done for us, Lord.
[32:58] You have set us free this morning. We
[33:00] are the freest people on the earth. We
[33:02] are the happiest people on the earth.
[33:04] Lord, you gave us a prophet and you open
[33:07] up our eyes to see the word for this
[33:09] day. We thank you, Lord, in Jesus name.

[47:07] excited about the word of God as you

[47:19] [laughter] Amen. Praise God. Good to
[47:21] have uh all the visitors here in the

[47:25] the word of God. Praise God. We've been
[47:28] on a series here on um you know the
[47:31] purpose of God and we you know we've
[47:33] been kind of just progressing along and
[47:36] we got into called unto adoption and I
[47:38] believe this is the age of adoption for
[47:41] us. Amen. For the sons of God in this
[47:44] hour under this message of the hour
[47:46] God's going to have uh attribute sons
[47:49] and daughters that are going to come
[47:50] into their fullness. Amen. To recognize
[47:53] the portion of the word that they are.
[47:55] Amen. Praise God. And last week we were
[47:57] looking at obtaining our inheritance as
[48:01] adopted sons. Listen, if you've got if
[48:03] if you if you're a son in whatever
[48:05] family or daughter in whatever family
[48:08] your mom and dad, you know, they're
[48:09] leaving you an inheritance, but you need
[48:11] to you need to make sure your name's on
[48:13] the will.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to know that your name's
[48:16] on the will and that you know that
[48:18] you're actually going to obtain an
[48:19] inheritance. Amen. So when the when the
[48:22] lawyer when the Holy Ghost starts to
[48:23] call the names in this last day, you
[48:26] want to know that that's me. Hallelujah.
[48:28] I'm present. Amen. I've heard my name.
[48:31] Glory to God. Amen. So we want to we
[48:33] want to just continue where we left off
[48:36] last week. Um and we'll just uh title
[48:38] this obtaining our inheritance part two.
[48:41] Amen. Praise God. And so um let's go to
[48:45] our scripture from Ephesians. Um the
[48:48] same scripture says here in Ephesians
[48:51] chapter 1 verse 9 to11. Let's ask the
[48:54] Lord to bless the word. Father, as we
[48:56] approach you now through the word of
[48:58] God, we're asking your anointing to come
[49:01] and possess speaker and hearers, Lord,
[49:05] that we may together in heavenly places
[49:08] hear exactly what you have that you
[49:11] you're going to open to us the
[49:13] understanding of this day, the the
[49:16] present truth to be established in the
[49:19] present truth. Father, this is our
[49:21] desire this morning. Come speak to us,
[49:24] hear through us. Lord, have your way and
[49:27] let us go rejoicing today, Father, in
[49:29] the name of Jesus Christ, we give you
[49:31] glory. Amen.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; It says here in Ephesians 1:es 9-11,
[49:36] having made known unto us the mystery of
[49:40] his will, according to his good
[49:42] pleasure, which he hath purposed in
[49:45] himself. Amen. that in the dispensation
[49:49] of the fullness of times, which I
[49:52] believe that we're in that time right
[49:54] now, he might gather together in one all
[49:58] things, both which are in heaven and
[50:01] which are on earth, even in him, in whom
[50:04] also we have obtained an inheritance.
[50:09] Amen. Praise God. It's already available
[50:12] to us. We just need to recognize who we
[50:15] are so that we can receive it. Amen.
[50:18] Being predestinated according to the
[50:20] purpose of him who workketh all things
[50:24] after the counsel of his own will.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You may be seated.
[50:32] Amen. Praise God. I believe we're living
[50:35] in the fullness of time, saints. I
[50:37] believe there'll be a people that'll
[50:39] recognize the progression of the word of
[50:41] God for their day. Realize that there's
[50:44] a word that was ordained in this day and
[50:47] in this hour. We've heard brother
[50:48] Brandham say it many times that there
[50:50] was a specific word that you were to
[50:53] come into and that you would actually be
[50:56] the manifestation of that particular
[50:59] word in that particular season. And by
[51:03] you recognizing that brings you into a
[51:06] position and into a revelation of
[51:09] perfect faith
[51:10] &gt;&gt; to see yourself in the word of God.
[51:13] Amen. And there's nothing greater than
[51:16] that, saints, that we could recognize
[51:18] that we are in the word and that we are
[51:21] a part of the will of God. Amen. Because
[51:25] it says here that that it's that that
[51:27] that everything was predestinated
[51:29] according to the purpose of him.
[51:32] who workketh all things according to the
[51:36] counsel of his own
[51:38] &gt;&gt; will
[51:40] &gt;&gt; the will.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; There's a will.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose in God.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; There's an inheritance within that will
[51:48] and purpose of God that that that's
[51:51] ordained for you specifically. You
[51:54] didn't know it.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; You didn't know it. You didn't realize
[51:57] it. you were just living your life here
[51:59] on this earth and you thought that well
[52:01] you know I hope my mom and dad are going
[52:03] to leave me an inheritance and I you
[52:05] know I'm hoping that you know like
[52:06] because it's getting tough out there
[52:08] it's getting tough to get by you know
[52:10] young people these days they can't even
[52:12] buy a house you know the majority of
[52:14] them can't buy a house because it's
[52:16] gotten so out of out of you know
[52:18] ridiculous and you know they're relying
[52:20] on their parents amen they're relying
[52:23] they're trusting that their parents are
[52:24] going to do it and some don't have
[52:26] parents and And then they find that
[52:28] their lives are in chaos. They find that
[52:30] things just aren't, you know, the ends
[52:32] aren't aren't aren't quite meeting. And
[52:34] at the end of the month, there's just
[52:35] not enough money. And so they get into
[52:37] situations and families start to break
[52:40] up. You know that, you know, families
[52:42] break up. Husbands and wives, you know,
[52:44] one of the major causes financial
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's because the wife or the
[52:50] husband is not satisfied with, you know,
[52:55] I thought her parents were going to
[52:57] leave us lots of money. Hallelujah. You
[53:00] know, I thought his parents were going
[53:01] to leave us money and they're just off
[53:03] on their vacations and they're spending
[53:05] all their money and there's no
[53:06] inheritance. Well, listen. This is you.
[53:10] You thought this was your life
[53:12] &gt;&gt; and then you heard the word of God
[53:15] &gt;&gt; and that you were a son of God and that
[53:17] God had a had an inheritance for you.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; An inheritance that not Paul he says
[53:23] eyes have not seen, ears have not heard,
[53:25] nor has it even entered into the heart
[53:28] of man. What God has in store for you.
[53:31] Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And and that just changes
[53:35] everything.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you're here this
[53:37] morning. You know that
[53:39] &gt;&gt; you're not here for just to be a church
[53:42] member, are you?
[53:43] &gt;&gt; You want to hear your name being called
[53:45] &gt;&gt; in the will of God. Amen. Praise God. So
[53:49] that you can know that there's a lot
[53:50] more that your future is actually clear.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; It's not full of heartache and and pain
[53:56] and sorrow. Amen.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful glorious victory we
[54:01] have. And so last week, just a quick
[54:04] review. I'll just go through, you know,
[54:06] you can flip over to the next slide
[54:07] here. We read from Joshua 1 verse 1-6.
[54:11] It says, "Now after the death of Moses,
[54:14] the servant of the Lord, it came to pass
[54:16] that the Lord spake unto Joshua, the son
[54:18] of Nun. Moses, minister, saying, Moses,
[54:23] my servant, is dead. Now therefore
[54:26] arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all
[54:29] this people unto the land which I give
[54:32] to them, even to the children of Israel.
[54:36] Every place that the soul of your foot
[54:39] shall tread upon, that have I given to
[54:42] you, as I said unto Brother Brham.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[54:53] Everything that God told the prophet is
[54:56] for you.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold, I send unto you. Elijah
[55:01] the prophet. Amen. And all the promises
[55:04] that God made to Moses, which is in our
[55:08] day was brother Brham, pertain to us.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Moses is dead.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham is dead. Amen. He's like
[55:19] dead, you know, in the understanding of
[55:21] this world. But you know where he is.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Exactly where he went when he was here
[55:26] before when he went beyond the curtain
[55:27] of time and he saw the sons and
[55:29] daughters of God in their theophony
[55:32] bodies. Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Young. He's having a He's having a good
[55:36] time. Don't worry about them. They've
[55:38] they've done their part. Listen, Brother
[55:40] Brandham did his part. Amen. Now we've
[55:43] got a part.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need to recognize that
[55:47] this is a different commission. This is
[55:50] a new dispensation. This is the hour
[55:52] where the bride comes into her rightful
[55:55] position. She becomes the voice. Amen.
[55:59] Hallelujah. Glory to God. And so we were
[56:02] looking at that and you know and and he
[56:04] you know we read from Joshua 1:9. Have I
[56:06] not commanded thee? For the Lord thy God
[56:08] is with thee wherever thou goest.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; You need to know that it's God that's
[56:14] with you.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. You don't need to be
[56:18] packing the tapes with you.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; You need to know that he's with you.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You want to listen to the tapes.
[56:28] You want to feed on the prophet's
[56:30] messages. You want to go back and I I
[56:32] feed on him every single day. If you
[56:35] don't recognize that God sent a prophet,
[56:37] you can't even you can't even come into
[56:39] what we're going to go into today.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; We're entering in to to the word for
[56:44] this hour. the mighty angel that came
[56:46] down to bring a message and to to open a
[56:50] book and to start calling the names of
[56:53] the sons and daughters of God in this
[56:55] hour. Amen.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; That's what we're interested in. He said
[56:58] here, he says, "Go in and possess the
[57:01] land.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Whatever." Listen, I don't know what
[57:04] your situation God designed you, built
[57:06] you, and and and brought you into this
[57:09] world designed for to meet the
[57:12] challenges of this day. He's made you
[57:15] and I different.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; But one thing he has given us is the
[57:20] land that that that he's given you. You
[57:22] need to possess it. Your home, your
[57:25] family, your finance, your health,
[57:27] &gt;&gt; your your your your happiness. Amen.
[57:30] That's something that you're going to
[57:32] need to possess. You're going to need to
[57:34] make some decisions in your life. You're
[57:36] going to need to overcome. Come on now.
[57:39] Amen. To him that overcomes will I allow
[57:42] to sit with me in the throne. Amen.
[57:44] Praise God. To be with him. Glory to
[57:47] God. So he's given you that. He's saying
[57:50] possess it.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Don't you look to the left. Don't you
[57:54] look to the right. I'm putting you in
[57:56] the in the new land of the message of
[57:58] this hour. Amen.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; A lot of people, they want to stay on
[58:02] the other side.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; They want to stay with Moses, but Moses
[58:05] is dead. But they want to go back there
[58:07] and all they want to do is quote Moses.
[58:09] They just want mo No. No. Moses did this
[58:12] and Moses did that and Moses did this.
[58:15] That's not enough. This is not that
[58:17] dispensation. This is the dispensation
[58:20] where he says you
[58:22] &gt;&gt; you you you go in and possess your own
[58:25] land. Amen.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. And so now you
[58:30] are you are in the land. We're in the
[58:32] message of the hour. Amen. We're we're
[58:34] feasting on the message of the hour.
[58:36] This is this is what we've entered into.
[58:40] This is what has, you know, placed fire
[58:42] within our souls because we've received
[58:45] the new birth.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; There's, you know, we talked about this
[58:49] a few weeks ago that that the Holy Ghost
[58:52] in this hour
[58:54] &gt;&gt; is the new birth. The Holy Ghost, Christ
[58:57] himself coming into you, it it awakens
[59:00] you to the revealed word for right now.
[59:04] Every dispensation had a portion
[59:08] &gt;&gt; of the spirit of God,
[59:10] &gt;&gt; but this is the only dispensation where
[59:12] the Holy Ghost brings us into the full
[59:16] adoption,
[59:18] &gt;&gt; the full revelation of the word.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; To manifest God again.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; In the fullness of the word. Amen.
[59:28] Praise God. This is that hour. And so,
[59:31] you know, here he goes on and uh so we
[59:35] know that we need to we need to take our
[59:37] land. You know, we need to take
[59:39] responsibility. God wants us to come
[59:41] into maturity of our own free moral
[59:45] agency. We're not clones. We're not, you
[59:48] know, this church is not designed in a
[59:50] way where there's a dictator at the
[59:52] front that comes up and says, "This is
[59:55] how you do it. This is what you need to
[59:57] do. You get rid of this. You get rid of
[59:59] that. you stop doing this. You No, no,
[1:00:01] no, no, no. That's not that's not the
[1:00:03] church that that that we belong to. This
[1:00:06] is not this is not the body of Christ.
[1:00:09] This this is the body of Christ. Amen.
[1:00:12] It's not that kind of law and you know
[1:00:15] you got to do no. The law listen the law
[1:00:19] had its time.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's grace now that has come into
[1:00:24] your life
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; by free moral agency. God's looking for
[1:00:28] character. Amen.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; He's looking for you to take
[1:00:31] responsibility and make the right
[1:00:33] decisions on your own.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Listen, adoption gives
[1:00:39] you an inheritance, but with that
[1:00:41] inheritance comes responsibility.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, go to the next quote here.
[1:00:47] This is still just quick review. We'll
[1:00:49] be done in a minute. Listen. In thou son
[1:00:52] of David, have mercy on me. He says
[1:00:54] here, God told them way down in Egypt
[1:00:58] before they came to the prices, I give
[1:01:00] you that land. But he didn't say, "I'm
[1:01:03] going to go in there and sweep it all
[1:01:04] out and garnish the houses and hang up
[1:01:07] the curtains and everything. You You
[1:01:09] just You all just move in." No, no, no,
[1:01:11] no. They had to fight for every inch of
[1:01:13] ground they took. That's right. Fighting
[1:01:16] and take it by every fight, every inch.
[1:01:20] But he said everywhere the souls of your
[1:01:23] foot land, that's possession.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Footsteps is possession.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; You walk with God.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; As you walk with God in this message
[1:01:34] under the revealed word for this day, it
[1:01:37] becomes possession.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; You are a son of God. I possess my
[1:01:42] healing. I possess my finance. I possess
[1:01:46] rel relationships with my family. I
[1:01:49] possess my my my because you're walking
[1:01:51] with God.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; He said, I'm going to be with you.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be with you. He's going to
[1:01:56] listen. Let's go on here. He goes on
[1:01:58] here. He says, "Now remember
[1:02:01] Moses had given them all the
[1:02:02] instructions how to possess the land,
[1:02:04] how to plant the land, how to rest the
[1:02:06] land. All of these things, these are
[1:02:09] instructions that you as as grown sons
[1:02:12] and daughters of God, you should know
[1:02:14] now and take responsibility for
[1:02:17] decisionmaking, for actions that you
[1:02:19] make. Amen. But as long as the children
[1:02:22] of Israel did exactly what what what the
[1:02:24] word was telling them to do and he said,
[1:02:26] "I'll be with you." You you you you just
[1:02:29] got to just keep walking.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; You just keep walking. God comes and
[1:02:34] does the rest. The Lord said only be
[1:02:37] courageous. You got to be courageous to
[1:02:39] live this message to stand on this word
[1:02:42] for this day amongst your friends and
[1:02:45] your family and your co-workers. You got
[1:02:47] to be courageous to stand and believe
[1:02:50] God under the circumstances and show
[1:02:52] that you really do believe.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Amen. And as long as
[1:02:58] you know, but let's listen. Uh, as long
[1:03:01] as we don't trust God, then you're going
[1:03:05] to see situations fall around you. Amen.
[1:03:10] You got to stay with the word. You got
[1:03:12] to stay with the what what he's he's
[1:03:14] given us as long as we obey and we
[1:03:17] recognize the word for our day. God, his
[1:03:20] spirit just continues to move around our
[1:03:22] life because we're walking with him.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Perfect examples. So here
[1:03:28] now, God God was fighting right
[1:03:32] alongside Israel as long as they stayed
[1:03:36] with Joshua's instruction. Amen. Under
[1:03:39] the five-fold ministry. Remember, this
[1:03:42] is the hour where the five-fold ministry
[1:03:45] is the voice of God to give you
[1:03:49] instruction on how to overcome and how
[1:03:53] to deal with the situations in your life
[1:03:56] so that you can walk into your adoption
[1:03:59] as a son of God. Amen. Praise God. Stop
[1:04:03] saying, "Lord, you do this. Lord, you do
[1:04:06] that." It's time that you start to
[1:04:09] understand that the that the voice is
[1:04:11] now in you. God's given you
[1:04:13] responsibility. Time for you to step out
[1:04:15] and walk on your own.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. In
[1:04:21] Joshua, go to the next slide here. In
[1:04:24] Joshua 10:11 it says, "And it came to
[1:04:26] pass as they fled from before Israel and
[1:04:28] were in the going down to Bethon that
[1:04:31] the Lord cast down great stones from
[1:04:34] heaven upon them unto
[1:04:37] Ahesca, and they died. They were more
[1:04:41] which died with hailstones than they
[1:04:44] whom the children of Israel slew with
[1:04:46] the sword." God was showing that he was
[1:04:48] with them. and and there was situations
[1:04:51] that they couldn't handle on their own.
[1:04:53] But that's okay. Don't you worry about
[1:04:55] those situations. You just keep walking
[1:04:58] with God because God's got his word.
[1:05:00] He's got stones coming down dealing with
[1:05:03] all those situations. Amen. We got to
[1:05:05] keep pressing on. Amen. Next slide. And
[1:05:09] still under the review. Then spake
[1:05:10] Joshua to the Lord in the day when the
[1:05:12] Lord delivered up the Amorites before
[1:05:14] the children of Israel and said in the
[1:05:17] sight of Israel, "Son,
[1:05:19] stand still upon Gibian and thou moon in
[1:05:23] the valley of Agelon." And the sun stood
[1:05:26] still, and the moon stayed until the
[1:05:28] people had avenged themselves upon their
[1:05:30] enemies. Listen, you come into some
[1:05:33] tough situations in your life.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's there's no question you're
[1:05:38] going to you're you're going to some of
[1:05:40] you are facing some right now. Some of
[1:05:42] the the greatest challenges that you've
[1:05:44] that you'll ever face.
[1:05:47] But it's at that time that if there's
[1:05:49] faith in your heart,
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; you're going to you're you're going to
[1:05:52] speak you're you're not going to speak
[1:05:55] the doctor's report.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; You're you're you're going to speak the
[1:05:59] word report. I am the Lord God that
[1:06:01] health thee. I am the Lord God that that
[1:06:04] that comforts thee. I am your peace. I
[1:06:08] am your rest. I am Jehovah Gyra that
[1:06:12] provideth all of your needs. Amen. This
[1:06:14] is what's going to speak out of your
[1:06:16] mouth. And those circumstances in your
[1:06:18] life, they got to stand still.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; They got to come under the obedience of
[1:06:22] the word of God that's in you. Amen.
[1:06:25] Because now now you know who you are.
[1:06:28] Amen. You've recognized your calling,
[1:06:30] your position. Amen. And look, and it
[1:06:33] says here that and there was no day like
[1:06:36] that before it or after it that the Lord
[1:06:39] hearkened unto the voice of a man.
[1:06:44] God desires for you to know that he that
[1:06:48] his desire is to possess man. you as a
[1:06:53] as a a a a broken individual,
[1:06:57] somebody that's come out from all kinds
[1:06:59] of generational situations and
[1:07:01] circumstances and and and bad
[1:07:03] experiences and all kinds of listen all
[1:07:07] kinds of situations. We could we could
[1:07:09] give God a thousand excuses why why
[1:07:11] would you choose me? But he chose you
[1:07:15] because he saw you before the
[1:07:17] foundations of the world.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; That you would accept his word.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; That you would say, "I believe it.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; I believe the word of God can do these
[1:07:27] things. I believe that you're my healer.
[1:07:29] I believe that you're my provider."
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; So because of that, he now he now
[1:07:34] indwells in man. He's that that was his
[1:07:38] great desire. Amen. Praise God.
[1:07:40] Hallelujah. And so, so the Lord
[1:07:43] hearkened unto the voice of a man. If he
[1:07:45] did it back then, he'll do it again.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; This is the hour where he's doing it
[1:07:50] again. Amen. This is where the sons of
[1:07:53] God come into full adoption with
[1:07:56] character.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; And so Joshua had a purpose in his
[1:08:02] heart. He had something he needed to
[1:08:03] accomplish. You've got a purpose that's
[1:08:06] been placed in your heart.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You listen. If you've come under
[1:08:10] the revelation of this hour, your
[1:08:13] purpose is to manifest
[1:08:16] Christ in your life in word form.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not going to be a a a
[1:08:23] parrot. You're not going to be a like,
[1:08:26] you know, a a a clone.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Come on now. This listen this this word
[1:08:32] that that that that you've received in
[1:08:35] this hour. It you know you're different.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; You know you can't mix when you're
[1:08:41] hearing certain things. You know you it
[1:08:43] doesn't take long. You you know you you
[1:08:45] can tell you've got that you've got that
[1:08:47] eagle hearing. You've got that that
[1:08:49] eagle vision. You've got that ability to
[1:08:52] hear the word of God when it's being
[1:08:54] preached in its season. You know the
[1:08:57] difference when God is speaking. God is
[1:09:00] speaking in the present truth
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; under the present revelation. Amen. It
[1:09:06] changes you completely. And then and
[1:09:09] then that's what gives you the ability
[1:09:12] to stand and and and and know that he's
[1:09:15] God.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Not to be pulled into some doctrine or
[1:09:20] some teaching or some some two soul
[1:09:23] doctrine or some return ministry
[1:09:25] doctrine or or a or or a a another
[1:09:28] prophet ministry. No, no, no, no, no.
[1:09:31] that the word in you is the attribute
[1:09:34] that God placed before the foundations
[1:09:37] of the world for this age. And you can
[1:09:41] only respond to him.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; You're not going to respond. You're not
[1:09:45] even going to respond to the tapes
[1:09:47] anymore.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; You're going to be you're going to hear
[1:09:50] the word. You're going to recognize that
[1:09:53] it's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:09:55] forever. Amen. But you're going to be
[1:09:57] looking for fresh mana.
[1:10:00] You're going to be coming under the the
[1:10:01] you're going to realize that there's
[1:10:03] things that are coming to you through
[1:10:05] the five-fold ministry that was not
[1:10:08] available.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; It why? Because it's being revealed now.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; It wasn't for then. It was for now.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to look at some of
[1:10:20] this as we move along here. And so, this
[1:10:22] is where we left off last week. And so,
[1:10:25] let's move on now. Okay. Let's go to the
[1:10:27] next scripture as we look into part two.
[1:10:30] It says here in uh Judges 1 18 to1 19.
[1:10:35] It says also Judah took Gaza with the
[1:10:39] coast thereof and Ascalon with the coast
[1:10:42] thereof and Echron with the coast
[1:10:44] thereof. Now this is where the children
[1:10:46] of Israel have been been gone into the
[1:10:48] promised land. And now Joshua has given
[1:10:50] and separated unto them all their
[1:10:53] portions to possess. Right? So here they
[1:10:55] are. or they're going in. But pay
[1:10:57] attention. And the Lord was with Judah.
[1:11:00] Amen. And he drove out he drove out the
[1:11:03] inhabitants of the mountain, but notice
[1:11:06] he could not drive out the inhabitants
[1:11:08] of the valley because they had chariots
[1:11:11] of iron.
[1:11:13] All of a sudden, they were displaying
[1:11:16] certain elements of warfare
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; that seemed to be a little more, you
[1:11:23] know, it just more powerful. You know,
[1:11:26] things can sound, you know, all of a
[1:11:27] sudden you start to hear certain, you
[1:11:30] know, messages coming from different
[1:11:31] churches and different individuals
[1:11:34] bringing out, you know, portions of the
[1:11:35] word and it sounds powerful. It sounds
[1:11:38] strong. It sounds like, wow, this is
[1:11:40] this is something that, you know, I got
[1:11:43] I I get pulled by that. And you know,
[1:11:45] those that that are weak, they're going
[1:11:48] to they're going to come under they're
[1:11:50] going to come under that power. Amen.
[1:11:53] They're going to think, "Oh, this is
[1:11:55] this has got to be God because this is
[1:11:57] this is more powerful. Look at the
[1:11:59] ministry. It's getting bigger. It's a
[1:12:01] powerful ministry. It's, you know, a lot
[1:12:03] of people are talking about it." No, no,
[1:12:05] no, no, no. God said, "Your land,
[1:12:08] possess your land, the portion of the
[1:12:11] word that you are." I thank God for a
[1:12:14] for a pastor who over the years just
[1:12:17] stayed with the word that was revealed
[1:12:18] to him.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; He didn't get pulled to the left or to
[1:12:22] the right. He just stayed with the word
[1:12:24] because he knew that if the word would
[1:12:26] get laid into the hearts of the people,
[1:12:28] the word would discern the error. the
[1:12:31] word would would bring everything clear
[1:12:33] and and they would just continue to
[1:12:35] follow the word. Amen. But you see the
[1:12:38] the the chariots seemed like they were
[1:12:40] too powerful for the people and that and
[1:12:43] they couldn't overcome. Look, look at
[1:12:45] Gaza today. You know, we see, you know,
[1:12:48] Israel is a type of the bride and we see
[1:12:51] what's taken place. Is this the same
[1:12:52] Gaza, the coastline that they were
[1:12:55] talking about thousands of years ago
[1:12:57] that that that that Israel was to
[1:13:00] possess? That's part of their
[1:13:01] possession. Amen. Praise God. But look
[1:13:04] at look at them today. Thousands of
[1:13:06] years later, Israel let the enemy come
[1:13:09] in under the pressure of the other world
[1:13:12] nations out of all the other pressures
[1:13:15] of the different churches, the different
[1:13:17] You got to see the types now. I hope you
[1:13:19] got your spiritual understanding on.
[1:13:21] Amen. that you know all of a sudden all
[1:13:23] these things start to creep into the
[1:13:25] message. All of a sudden they start
[1:13:27] looking left, they start looking right.
[1:13:29] Before you know it, the enemy, he's come
[1:13:31] into your home. he's placed himself in
[1:13:34] there in the way of a track or or all of
[1:13:37] a sudden, you know, you you're not
[1:13:39] following your pastor anymore,
[1:13:42] you know, because you like what you're
[1:13:43] hearing over there and all of a sudden,
[1:13:46] you know, it's because you're not
[1:13:48] solidly staying in the possession that
[1:13:50] he gave you. Amen. But you're but you're
[1:13:53] you're you're wandering. You're looking
[1:13:54] to the left. You're looking to the
[1:13:56] right. Amen. But God don't want you to
[1:13:58] do that. God wants you to see exactly
[1:14:01] what he's given you. Amen. And what
[1:14:05] happened? Israel, all of a sudden, the
[1:14:07] enemy starts building tunnels under
[1:14:10] Gaza. They start, you know,
[1:14:13] infiltrating. All of a sudden, one pops
[1:14:15] up here. Before you know it, a huge
[1:14:18] attack. Do you think that the timing of
[1:14:21] all of this is just by chance?
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; What did Brother Brandham say? says,
[1:14:27] "You want to know what time it is?
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Watch Israel.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Look what's been happening in Israel and
[1:14:35] look and see what's happening within the
[1:14:37] land of this message.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; And see what it is that's trying to
[1:14:41] infiltrate
[1:14:42] you as a son or a daughter of God."
[1:14:45] Amen. Why? Because you you you got a
[1:14:48] little bit distracted by the chariots.
[1:14:51] Amen. Praise God. Look, he says,
[1:14:56] you know, just from my notes here, the
[1:14:58] last two years, we've seen another turn,
[1:15:02] another dispensational change even
[1:15:05] within the message. Now, I'm not trying
[1:15:07] to bring a new doctrine here. Don't
[1:15:10] don't. This is called the progression of
[1:15:13] the revelation of the mighty God who has
[1:15:17] come down to manifest the sons of God.
[1:15:21] And when I say sons, I mean daughters
[1:15:24] also into into their rightful adopted
[1:15:28] position as the full sons and daughters
[1:15:32] of God for a purpose so that they can
[1:15:34] get their inheritance.
[1:15:37] A lot of people put an inheritance as,
[1:15:39] oh well, God's going to, you know, bless
[1:15:41] me here. He's going to give me houses.
[1:15:43] He's going to give me lands. Yes, he's
[1:15:45] he'll do all of that. If you're a
[1:15:47] faithful steward of the money that he
[1:15:50] gives you, if you've got a revelation
[1:15:53] that that it's him that gives you 100%
[1:15:56] of the funds that you get into your bank
[1:15:59] account,
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; and then you get a revelation that that
[1:16:03] like Abraham, he he paid a tithe unto
[1:16:06] the Lord. He all all I got to give back
[1:16:09] is 10%. You're going to give me a 100
[1:16:12] and all I got to do is give you 10,
[1:16:14] Lord. You can give me as much 100% as
[1:16:17] you want. Hallelujah. You see, God can
[1:16:20] bless you with a 100 or 100 million.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; It's all based on the faith that God has
[1:16:26] placed in you in the portion of the
[1:16:30] word, in the dispensation of the
[1:16:32] attribute that you are.
[1:16:35] You've got to realize that God didn't
[1:16:39] it's not by chance that God will bless
[1:16:42] and prosper and use certain individuals
[1:16:45] to to to be used to bring finance into
[1:16:48] the body of Christ. Amen. If you if you
[1:16:51] catch that revelation, you you you and
[1:16:54] it becomes a reality to you like it did
[1:16:56] to me. I got to tell you, when when it
[1:16:58] when it became a reality to me years
[1:17:00] ago, I I said, "Oh, God, thank you,
[1:17:03] Lord. I I want to give you more. I I
[1:17:05] want I want more because you you've
[1:17:07] attached a promise to this. You've
[1:17:09] you've attached a promise to this and so
[1:17:12] I can and so if that promise is for me
[1:17:14] then Lord let me be that channel. Let me
[1:17:17] be Do you desire that this morning?
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; You can be that kind of a channel.
[1:17:21] Listen, there is no reason for any son
[1:17:24] or daughter of God to be living under
[1:17:27] privileged.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Not one.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:17:34] It's for you.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Prosperity. God says that I would that
[1:17:39] you would prosper.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; He wants you to prosper. To get that
[1:17:44] poverty demon out of your mind. Amen.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Don't let the enemy tell you, "Yeah, but
[1:17:50] it's for him, but it's not for you." No,
[1:17:51] no, no. He's the same yesterday, today,
[1:17:53] and forever.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; What he promised for him is for me.
[1:17:57] Amen. Yes, sir. So understanding that
[1:18:01] places you into a place where you can
[1:18:04] you you can be used of God and
[1:18:06] understand that this dispensational
[1:18:08] change, this awakening within the bride
[1:18:11] is just the progression of the word to
[1:18:14] bring sons into full adoption.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that don't even
[1:18:19] understand the adoption. They don't
[1:18:21] understand the sunship. They think it's
[1:18:24] just to be, you know, become a deacon in
[1:18:26] the church or to become a pastor or a
[1:18:28] preacher
[1:18:29] that God's going to give them a higher
[1:18:31] authority.
[1:18:32] I'm telling you that the housewife has
[1:18:35] just as much authority as a daughter of
[1:18:38] God.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. To speak the word, to to lay hands
[1:18:42] on the sick, to to to teach their
[1:18:46] children the word of God. Amen. Praise
[1:18:48] God. Hallelujah. Every listen, every
[1:18:50] position is anointed with a portion of
[1:18:53] God.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And so here, let's go to the next
[1:18:58] scripture here. He says, but you just
[1:19:01] need to understand that you're not to
[1:19:05] make any tribute with the enemy. Don't
[1:19:07] let that those chariots and and and
[1:19:10] those bluffs, you know, come in and and
[1:19:13] you know, things start to creep into
[1:19:14] your life. Amen. And you you know the
[1:19:16] things that you used to kick out, you're
[1:19:18] letting them back in. Watch it now.
[1:19:20] Amen. Neither did Manasseh drive out
[1:19:24] listen the inhabitants of Bethshene and
[1:19:27] her towns, nor Tanak and her towns, nor
[1:19:30] the inhabitants of Door and her towns,
[1:19:32] nor the inhabitants of Elimin and her
[1:19:35] towns, nor the inhabitants of Medigol
[1:19:37] and her towns. But the Canaanites would
[1:19:41] dwell in that land. And it came to pass
[1:19:44] when Israel was strong. Oh, you mean you
[1:19:49] can get to a place where you're starting
[1:19:51] to feel really good. You're starting to
[1:19:53] feel strong. You're starting to think
[1:19:55] that you I've got the message of the
[1:19:56] hour. I'm I I'm I'm placed in the
[1:19:59] church. I've got a position in the
[1:20:01] church. Be careful now that they put the
[1:20:03] Canaanites to tribute that all of a
[1:20:06] sudden you start to allow little things.
[1:20:08] Oh, well, brother, you know, a brother
[1:20:10] comes into the church or a sister comes
[1:20:12] into the church and they got a bit of a
[1:20:13] gossip thing. All of a sudden, they
[1:20:16] start to, you know, talk about this
[1:20:18] person talk. Oh, did you hear what this
[1:20:20] one said? Did you hear what that one
[1:20:22] said? All of a sudden, they're spending
[1:20:24] more time together. All of a sudden,
[1:20:26] they don't realize they've let they've
[1:20:27] led a Canaanite into the village.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, boy. Amen. Would dwell in that land.
[1:20:33] And it came to pass when Israel was
[1:20:35] strong that they put the Canaanites to
[1:20:37] tribute and did not utterly drive them
[1:20:40] out. What does that mean? that that all
[1:20:42] of a sudden they would allow them to
[1:20:45] stay in their home, stay in their
[1:20:48] church, stay in in around the brethren
[1:20:53] as long as they stayed, you know, under
[1:20:56] subjection to the church and they would
[1:20:59] show up and they would, you know, pay
[1:21:02] even pay their tithes. Oh, yeah. Even
[1:21:05] pay their tithes and, you know, make
[1:21:06] some offerings and so forth. But they
[1:21:08] were off the word. They were they were
[1:21:11] telling them certain things that that
[1:21:14] were were were bringing them into
[1:21:16] another direction. All of a sudden they
[1:21:19] started to, you know, make tribute. That
[1:21:21] means that you're you're you're you're
[1:21:22] agreeing that as long listen just don't
[1:21:25] bother me too much. You think the
[1:21:26] devil's he's smart. He won't bother you
[1:21:29] in your house while you're doing all
[1:21:31] those things that you know you shouldn't
[1:21:32] be doing,
[1:21:34] living a double life. and he'll stay
[1:21:38] there and he won't cause any trouble as
[1:21:40] long as you know he stays quiet and you
[1:21:44] just No, no, no. Before you know it,
[1:21:47] trouble in the land. Amen. And it came
[1:21:50] to pass, he says, "And and they paid
[1:21:52] tribute and did not drive them out.
[1:21:54] Neither did Ephraim drive out the
[1:21:56] Canaanites that dwelt in Jazir, but the
[1:21:58] Canaanites dwelt in Jazir among them.
[1:22:01] Neither did Zebulun drive out the
[1:22:03] inhabitants of Kitron, nor the
[1:22:05] inhabitants of Nah, but the Canaanites
[1:22:09] dwelt among them and became tributaries.
[1:22:15] We start to, you know, listen, you start
[1:22:18] out and you're real strong. You come
[1:22:19] out, you know, you're a real warrior for
[1:22:21] God and then all of a sudden you start
[1:22:23] to let the things back in that you had
[1:22:26] kicked out.
[1:22:28] But when the Lord made his promise to
[1:22:30] you that that you would possess the
[1:22:33] land, he didn't say it would happen
[1:22:36] overnight.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "You got to possess
[1:22:40] the land. Know that I'll be with you.
[1:22:42] You need to be courageous." Why do you
[1:22:44] need to be courageous? Because you got
[1:22:46] to fight.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; You got to stand up against situations
[1:22:50] that are going to come into your home,
[1:22:52] into your church, into your life,
[1:22:54] disease come into your body. You've got
[1:22:56] to stand. Oh, the doctor says it's a
[1:22:59] common thing. It's, you know, but but uh
[1:23:01] you know, this is what it's going to
[1:23:03] cause. And you know, it's like those
[1:23:04] commercials that you hear. Oh, take you
[1:23:06] seen, you know, and then at the end it
[1:23:09] tells you you could die. You could have
[1:23:10] heart attack. You could have dementia.
[1:23:12] You could be, you know, as you know, all
[1:23:14] these things. And and this is all the
[1:23:17] lies of the enemy just to try to get in.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Don't drop the bar.
[1:23:24] keep possessing the land.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; That's what God is looking for. He's
[1:23:29] looking for sons to come into their to
[1:23:32] their maturity where they know they got
[1:23:35] a part to do.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; You're not going to, oh God, do this,
[1:23:38] God do that. No, Siri, listen here. He
[1:23:42] says, go on. Let's look at the next
[1:23:43] scripture here. He says, "So many says,
[1:23:46] if the Lord will take this evil spirit
[1:23:49] from me from drinking or gambling or
[1:23:52] from lying or stealing, I'll serve him."
[1:23:55] But that's up to you. What?
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Up to you. See, he says you you got to
[1:24:03] do something, too.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; They they that overcome shall inherit
[1:24:08] all things.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. They that overcome. You have power
[1:24:14] to do it. But you must be willing to lay
[1:24:17] it down.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; You got to lay down your pride. You got
[1:24:21] to lay down your You got to put up with
[1:24:23] the reproach. You got to lay it down. He
[1:24:26] says he says, "Listen, look, look." He
[1:24:28] says, "She has made herself ready."
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; What do you mean she has made herself
[1:24:34] ready? everybody, you know, you you hear
[1:24:37] that, but you don't want to put the
[1:24:39] action behind that. You've got a
[1:24:41] responsibility. You've got a part to do
[1:24:44] in all of this. I like that word. You
[1:24:46] see, God could not push us through a
[1:24:49] little pipe, pull us through on the
[1:24:51] other end, and then say, "Blessed is he
[1:24:53] that overcomemeth." What did you
[1:24:56] overcome? God pushed you from one end to
[1:24:58] the other.
[1:24:59] There comes a point where as a son or a
[1:25:01] daughter that comes into maturity, you
[1:25:04] know what to do with the word.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; You know what God requires of you.
[1:25:09] You've got free moral agency. That's the
[1:25:11] kind of son that he wants to put into
[1:25:13] authority. Amen. Glory to God. Blessed
[1:25:16] is he that overcomemeth. He had nothing
[1:25:19] to overcome. He just pushed you through.
[1:25:21] But you've got to make decisions for
[1:25:24] yourself.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; I had to make decisions for myself. I'm
[1:25:28] doing that. We show our revelation, our
[1:25:32] faith, and respect unto the Lord.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Wow. Praise God.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; You mean you got something to do with
[1:25:41] this?
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; What do you think? You just come here
[1:25:44] every Sunday and every Wednesday and
[1:25:46] just open your plate and, you know, you
[1:25:49] sitting there with your knife and your
[1:25:50] fork. Oh, that's a good piece. I'll eat
[1:25:52] that. No, I don't like that one. No,
[1:25:55] no, no, no, no. This is where the
[1:25:57] warriors, the sons of God are coming to
[1:26:00] hear from the mighty angel where they're
[1:26:02] receiving instruction from the father.
[1:26:05] The father is tutoring. The father is
[1:26:07] instructing. The the father is giving us
[1:26:10] everything that we have need of every
[1:26:12] promise in the book. It's yours.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And you and you've got to take it and
[1:26:16] you've got to apply it. And you've got
[1:26:18] to overcome and you've got to pull your
[1:26:21] sword every now and then and deal with
[1:26:23] situations and know that you will
[1:26:26] possess
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; because he said you would possess. He
[1:26:29] didn't say you might possess. He didn't
[1:26:31] put a condition on it. The only
[1:26:34] condition was that don't let down the
[1:26:36] bar. Don't let those those uh squatters
[1:26:40] into the land. Recognize them. Kick them
[1:26:43] out. Amen. Glory to God. Listen, go to
[1:26:45] the next scripture here in Judges. He
[1:26:47] says, "And an angel of the Lord came up
[1:26:51] from Gilgal to Boim and said, I I made
[1:26:56] you to go out of Egypt." Now he's coming
[1:26:58] to rebuke this Israel, and have brought
[1:27:02] you unto the land which I swear unto
[1:27:05] your fathers, and I said, I will never
[1:27:07] break my covenant with you. Amen. And ye
[1:27:11] shall make no league with no league with
[1:27:14] the inhabitants of this land. Ye shall
[1:27:16] throw down their altars, but ye have not
[1:27:20] obeyed my voice.
[1:27:23] Oh my goodness, why have you done this?
[1:27:26] Wherefore I also said, I will not drive
[1:27:29] them out before you, but they shall be
[1:27:32] as thorns in your sides, and their god
[1:27:35] shall be a snare unto you.
[1:27:39] There's a lot of people that are in this
[1:27:41] condition,
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; but there's hope.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; That's why he sends his word.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; He sends the word in the hour that it's
[1:27:52] needed.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; That's why present truth, it's it's a
[1:27:57] lamp unto your feet. You don't have to
[1:28:00] remain in this condition.
[1:28:03] You listen, you may God was was was was
[1:28:06] instructing you and you you were just
[1:28:08] kind of like letting the voice kind of
[1:28:10] fade out. You know, you go to sleep, you
[1:28:12] wake up the next morning and you figure
[1:28:14] maybe that voice is not going to be
[1:28:16] there, but it's still there. Amen. He's
[1:28:19] saying you you you just need you just
[1:28:21] need to come back to the word. You need
[1:28:24] to come out of your slumber. You need to
[1:28:27] come out of your condition. You're a son
[1:28:29] of God. You're not you're not to remain
[1:28:32] under that situation. Amen. Glory to
[1:28:35] God. He says here, he says, "Listen, God
[1:28:38] sent the children of Israel and the
[1:28:40] angel to rebuke them for not listening.
[1:28:43] But look, if there was any sin in your
[1:28:45] life that you've made tribute with, it's
[1:28:48] time to drive it out.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; That's why he came. That's why the word
[1:28:53] comes. It comes so that you can hearken
[1:28:56] under the word and God shows you certain
[1:28:58] things and then you drive them out.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden now you start to possess
[1:29:03] your land. You start to show your
[1:29:06] sunship as a as a an adopted son of God.
[1:29:10] Amen. The end time sons of God. We are
[1:29:13] the ones who will overcome and will have
[1:29:15] the victory over every enemy that stands
[1:29:19] before you. Every single enemy that
[1:29:22] stands before you, God has given you
[1:29:24] victory over it
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; because of the attribute that you are
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; next slide.
[1:29:32] Amen. Jud in Judges 17. Now watch. He
[1:29:36] comes here and he says, "And the
[1:29:37] children of Joseph said, now they're
[1:29:40] still complaining, right? You know, this
[1:29:42] is the hour." says, "The hill is not
[1:29:45] enough for us, and all the Canaanites
[1:29:47] that dwell in the land of the valley
[1:29:48] have chariots of iron." Here, here it is
[1:29:50] again. Bring it up. They got this
[1:29:52] doctrine. They got this teaching.
[1:29:54] They've got they've got the people
[1:29:56] following them. But look, bo both they
[1:29:59] who are of Bethan and her towns, and
[1:30:02] they who are of the valley of Jezrael.
[1:30:04] And now watch what Joshua and this is
[1:30:07] him now speaking to you, speaking to me,
[1:30:10] because this is the five-fold ministry.
[1:30:12] Joshua represents the Ephesian church.
[1:30:15] Amen. Those that are going to come under
[1:30:17] the headship of Joshua in this day and
[1:30:20] in this hour because God knew that many
[1:30:22] would fall into these conditions. God
[1:30:24] knew that some would get caught under
[1:30:27] certain doctrines or certain aspects and
[1:30:30] influences. Amen. But he comes here and
[1:30:32] he says and speak unto the house of
[1:30:34] Joseph even to Ephraim and to Manasseh.
[1:30:38] Amen. who are the gentile children of
[1:30:42] Joseph's wife who was a gentile. Amen.
[1:30:45] Come to the Gentiles. Amen. Just all
[1:30:47] little types. Saying, "Thou art a great
[1:30:50] people and has great power. Thou shalt
[1:30:55] not have one lot only." In other words,
[1:31:00] don't you think that this is all that
[1:31:02] you get and and say, "Okay, I'm going to
[1:31:06] let these ones take over. this one's
[1:31:08] gonna stay in the land. No, no, no, no,
[1:31:09] no, no, no. You're not gonna stay in
[1:31:12] that condition. He says, "But the
[1:31:13] mountain shall be yours."
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; For it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it
[1:31:19] down. It's not something that's built
[1:31:22] upon anything solid. It's not the
[1:31:24] eternal word of God. It's the wood. It's
[1:31:27] teachings of man. It has a beginning.
[1:31:29] It'll have an end. It'll get cut down
[1:31:32] just as quick as it gets put up.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And the
[1:31:38] outgoings of it shall be thine, and thou
[1:31:40] shalt drive out the Canaan, the
[1:31:43] Canaanites, though they have iron
[1:31:45] chariots, and though they be strong.
[1:31:48] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; That's who you are.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; That's who God is telling us and
[1:31:54] reminding us of who we are in this hour.
[1:31:58] Amen. Praise God. They needed to come to
[1:32:01] a time where the sons of God by the
[1:32:04] Joshua commission would remind them.
[1:32:08] Church, we're being reminded of who we
[1:32:10] are.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; We're being reminded that we're in the
[1:32:13] adoption stage. We're being reminded
[1:32:15] that the tutors are no longer required.
[1:32:18] That the Holy Ghost himself is coming to
[1:32:21] possess and and indwell you and take
[1:32:24] control of your life and show that you
[1:32:27] are a son of God with with authority.
[1:32:29] Amen. Glory to God. Look, the Holy Ghost
[1:32:32] is reminding us that we are a great
[1:32:35] people. That this word will will never
[1:32:38] change. His word will never change.
[1:32:41] Amen. Why did we start to doubt? Have we
[1:32:44] allowed the things that we drove out to
[1:32:46] come back in? The things that the world,
[1:32:48] you know, tries to throw upon us, all
[1:32:51] kinds of different things of the world,
[1:32:53] entertainment and, you know, like, you
[1:32:55] know, getting us, you know, people go on
[1:32:58] vacations these days. They don't want to
[1:32:59] go for a week. They want to go for
[1:33:01] months.
[1:33:02] They don't they don't understand there,
[1:33:04] you know, like uh you know vacations
[1:33:08] from what? Vacations from God. You don't
[1:33:11] take vacations from God. Okay. Sure, God
[1:33:14] wants you to go for rest. God wants you
[1:33:16] to take vacations, but God wants you
[1:33:19] under the the the leadership of the word
[1:33:21] for the day and the hour under your
[1:33:24] captain so that you can receive
[1:33:25] instruction to overcome because things
[1:33:28] start to creep in if you don't kick them
[1:33:32] out and if you don't stay fortified by
[1:33:35] the word of God. Amen. Glory to God. We
[1:33:39] have a responsibility
[1:33:41] to manifest the sons of God with
[1:33:43] confidence. Amen. Look, let's go to the
[1:33:46] next scripture here.
[1:33:48] This is where it starts getting sweet.
[1:33:50] You know, now we're going to start to
[1:33:52] hear about who we are and what God's
[1:33:55] given us and to know that we don't have
[1:33:57] to stay in certain conditions. Amen. In
[1:33:59] Romans 8 14 to18, for as many as are led
[1:34:04] by the spirit of God, they are the sons
[1:34:07] of God.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. For ye have not received the
[1:34:11] spirit of bondage again to fear. Come
[1:34:14] on.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; We got to we got to stand up. We got to
[1:34:17] understand that that fear cannot control
[1:34:20] our lives. Too many people they fear of
[1:34:22] this, fear of that. Oh, well, if I say
[1:34:24] this or if I do that. No.
[1:34:27] Know who you are. Step into your
[1:34:30] position as a son of God. Don't be
[1:34:32] afraid of the enemy that's going to try
[1:34:34] to knock you down, try to, you know,
[1:34:37] mock you and oh, you know, you you you
[1:34:39] believe you believe this. You believe
[1:34:41] that church, you believe what that
[1:34:42] church is teaching. No, no, you can turn
[1:34:44] around and say, "No, no, I believe God.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; I believe the word of God." The word has
[1:34:49] become a reality. Listen, listen. What
[1:34:51] what happens here? He says, "But ye have
[1:34:53] received the spirit of adoption." Now,
[1:34:56] that's a totally different spirit
[1:34:58] altogether, saints. That's the Holy
[1:35:00] Ghost coming into your life. Amen. Now,
[1:35:03] it's not you that has to overcome so
[1:35:06] much, but the spirit that's in you gives
[1:35:09] you the ability to make decisions to
[1:35:11] overcome.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; It gives you the confidence of God.
[1:35:15] Watch. Whereby we cry, "Aba." You know
[1:35:18] what aba means? Father.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; That's what aba means. Aba, father. We
[1:35:23] have a relationship. How can you say
[1:35:26] aba? The only way you can say aba is if
[1:35:29] you're a son. The only way my son can
[1:35:31] call me dad is because I'm his father.
[1:35:34] He came from my genes. Amen. Glory to
[1:35:37] God. This is what God is trying to tell
[1:35:39] you. And look, he goes on. He says, "The
[1:35:42] spirit itself be witness with our spirit
[1:35:45] that we are children of God." Amen. This
[1:35:49] is about the manifestation of the sons
[1:35:51] of God coming into their adoptive
[1:35:54] positions. Amen. And if children, then
[1:35:57] heirs. Remember, we are heirs to an
[1:36:01] inheritance.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Heirs of what? Heirs of God and joint
[1:36:05] hes with Christ.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Meaning that if you're a joint heir,
[1:36:11] listen, if my brother and my sister are
[1:36:14] present, when I go and sit before the
[1:36:18] the the the the lawyer and my parents,
[1:36:22] who I know they're just,
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; oh yeah, we serve a just God, saints.
[1:36:28] He's He's going to give my sister, my
[1:36:32] brother, and me equally our inheritance.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So, we are now joint hes
[1:36:42] meaning with Christ.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. With Christ.
[1:36:48] Christ is
[1:36:51] the first fruits. Christ. Listen, you
[1:36:54] got you got to realize that even when
[1:36:56] Christ came, he came as a man.
[1:37:01] He came to to show that he could be a
[1:37:04] man in a human vessel and he could
[1:37:07] overcome the flesh.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; He could make a way for the sons of God
[1:37:13] and the daughters of God to receive
[1:37:15] their inheritance.
[1:37:17] As long as Jesus was on the earth as a
[1:37:21] man
[1:37:22] and without giving up the ghost, we
[1:37:27] would have never received any
[1:37:28] inheritance. There would have been no
[1:37:29] inheritance.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "I go to prepare a place for
[1:37:33] you."
[1:37:35] A place. People think that it's just a
[1:37:37] shiny road somewhere with this big, you
[1:37:40] know, a mansion, right? We heard that,
[1:37:42] you know, he goes to prepare a mansion.
[1:37:45] Do you realize what that mansion is?
[1:37:48] Let's keep going.
[1:37:50] And if children, then hes of God and
[1:37:53] jointairs with Christ. If so be that we
[1:37:56] suffer with him, that we may also
[1:38:00] be glorified together. For I reckon that
[1:38:03] the suffering of this present time are
[1:38:06] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:38:09] that shall be revealed in us.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's something that he's
[1:38:17] deposited in you and me that's going to
[1:38:22] be manifested as a result of all the
[1:38:25] testing, all the trying, all the
[1:38:27] overcoming, all the things that you had
[1:38:30] to deal with under your adoptive stage,
[1:38:33] under the tutors of being trained to to
[1:38:36] to become sons of God so that you could
[1:38:40] receive your inheritance.
[1:38:43] Amen. What does this scripture really
[1:38:45] mean to you? The spirit of adoption. You
[1:38:47] have received a revelation of your
[1:38:50] father.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; That's what it's saying. That you now
[1:38:54] realize that you are a son.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; You're not just a child, a Christian.
[1:39:00] What? To go to church every Sunday and
[1:39:03] you know twice a week or you know just
[1:39:05] to to be a church member to say, "Oh,
[1:39:08] Jesus saved us." That's the message that
[1:39:10] all the churches out there are
[1:39:12] proclaiming.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's a great message. It's the
[1:39:15] truth. But what's it doing to transform
[1:39:18] your life and put you into the rapture?
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is got it's got
[1:39:23] to produce sons of God
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; that are actually going to go into a
[1:39:28] body change experience where they are
[1:39:31] going to be translated into another
[1:39:32] dimension.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; This is the word for the hour. This is
[1:39:37] what Christianity is supposed to be
[1:39:39] producing. Not church members.
[1:39:42] Not just being a Christian and say, "Oh,
[1:39:44] I'm a Christian."
[1:39:46] It's not about just saying, "I'm a
[1:39:48] Christian." It's about saying, "I am a
[1:39:50] son of God.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; I have recognized something."
[1:39:54] Hallelujah. Glory to God. I've I've I've
[1:39:57] I've recognized that I've got a father.
[1:39:59] I've got a real father that's that that
[1:40:01] that that's a supernatural God. Amen.
[1:40:04] And he he says, "I want to dwell with
[1:40:06] you. I want to be in you." This was his
[1:40:08] desire right from the very beginning.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. The purpose of the Holy Ghost is
[1:40:13] to get you to maturity and then make you
[1:40:16] then and then make your so that you can
[1:40:19] make your own decisions, take
[1:40:21] responsibility for your own actions.
[1:40:23] When you make mistakes, you own up to
[1:40:25] them.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; This is about coming up. This is about,
[1:40:30] you know, fessing up,
[1:40:33] letting God deal with whatever needs to
[1:40:35] be dealt with in our lives so that we
[1:40:36] can we so we can produce what it is that
[1:40:38] he's looking for us to produce. Amen.
[1:40:41] Then you need to let go of the things
[1:40:42] that you're that are getting in the way
[1:40:45] of his purpose for your life. Remember,
[1:40:48] the Holy Ghost comes to fulfill and
[1:40:51] manifest his purpose through you. Amen.
[1:40:54] A Christlike character only comes
[1:40:57] through suffering and being tried and
[1:41:00] being tested and having to to deal with
[1:41:03] your patience and the things that you
[1:41:05] that you you know you so easily some
[1:41:07] people you know like my god some people
[1:41:09] are so hotheaded.
[1:41:12] I'm telling you you can't even talk to
[1:41:13] them. You talk to them a little bit. You
[1:41:15] start to you know you mention a little
[1:41:16] thing and right away
[1:41:19] you see that head just you know spin a
[1:41:21] couple times. you know, hotheaded,
[1:41:23] getting angry so quick. What kind of a
[1:41:26] spirit is that? Amen. That's the kind of
[1:41:29] thing that's trying to, you know, take
[1:41:31] away your joy, take away your peace.
[1:41:34] Don't let that spirit, remember, the
[1:41:36] spirit of God is positive.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to start looking at
[1:41:40] certain things. You need to start
[1:41:41] looking at your diet. If you're if
[1:41:44] you're if you're if you're constantly
[1:41:46] feeding on sugar, sugar, desserts all
[1:41:49] the time, feeding on those things that
[1:41:51] are not good that you know that that
[1:41:53] they they they don't Do you know that
[1:41:54] you can you can find yourself in states
[1:41:57] of depression?
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Because of the over you know the the
[1:42:01] over stimulation that takes place with.
[1:42:03] So you got to be wise too. And I'm
[1:42:06] awakening you know I'm waking up to all
[1:42:08] these things. You know, you know when it
[1:42:10] starts happening, right,
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Brother John? It starts happening when
[1:42:13] you start getting a little older.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Right. You start to feel the aches and
[1:42:17] pains. You start to Wait a minute here.
[1:42:19] Why am I Why is this thing over here?
[1:42:21] Why? What the heck's this all about? All
[1:42:22] of a sudden, you change this. Oh, feel
[1:42:24] better. You change. You are what you
[1:42:27] eat. You want to be the word, feed on
[1:42:28] the word. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:42:31] Don't be one of these people. Well, the
[1:42:32] word I pray over all my food and it's
[1:42:34] all good.
[1:42:37] 20 bags of chips, you know, cheesies
[1:42:40] over here, a cheesecake in the fridge,
[1:42:43] you know. Oh, yeah. Well, good luck.
[1:42:46] Hallelujah. But yes, listen, I just read
[1:42:49] this here from adoption. He says it's
[1:42:51] not up there. He says, "Yep, sure do."
[1:42:54] Says, "The Holy Spirit, I'll give him."
[1:42:56] Now, this is the Holy Spirit. He says,
[1:42:57] "I'll give him tests, boy. I'll try him
[1:42:59] this way and I'll try him that way. I've
[1:43:02] thrown him down sick. I've put him
[1:43:05] under. I've stomped him. I've let the
[1:43:07] devil do everything to him he could do.
[1:43:10] He come right back up again. Now he's
[1:43:12] talking about you. Amen. He come the
[1:43:14] same. Come up again. I made him sick. I
[1:43:18] done this. I throwed him in the
[1:43:19] hospital. I took him out here and I done
[1:43:21] this. I done that. I turned his wife
[1:43:24] against him. Oh my goodness. My
[1:43:26] goodness. Let me tell you. Listen. The
[1:43:29] enemy will do anything he can. He'll use
[1:43:32] those that are closest to you.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; You wonder why? What? What's with all
[1:43:36] this attitude coming from my children
[1:43:39] there? You know why? Why are they
[1:43:40] attacking me like this? Why? Why? Why
[1:43:43] all of a sudden all these attacks
[1:43:45] coming? Why? Because you're growing into
[1:43:47] your position. That's why.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; It's because you're starting to cause
[1:43:50] trouble around them and they don't like
[1:43:52] it. Amen. They don't like the fact that
[1:43:55] you're becoming a little more spiritual
[1:43:57] and and God's opening your understanding
[1:43:59] to your position as a son and you're all
[1:44:01] of a sudden saying, "Whoa, whoa, wait a
[1:44:02] minute. This squatter over here out.
[1:44:05] Come on.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; They don't like that.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; But listen, they will appreciate it when
[1:44:09] it does come down. Let me tell you. And
[1:44:11] when that thing leaves,
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; they'll be glad they got rebuked. You
[1:44:14] know, sometimes you got to rebuke your
[1:44:16] brother, rebuke your sister, rebuke your
[1:44:18] son, rebuke your wife, rebuke your
[1:44:21] husband. Listen, if you get under that
[1:44:23] anointing, let the Holy Spirit show you
[1:44:26] by the word, not anger. I'm not talking
[1:44:28] about revenge.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Watch that spirit of pride. Be careful
[1:44:32] now because ego is a demon from the pits
[1:44:36] of hell.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; It'll rise up right away and say, "You
[1:44:40] don't talk to me that way. You don't
[1:44:42] this, that, this," not realizing that's
[1:44:44] the Holy Ghost saying,
[1:44:47] "Enough."
[1:44:49] We need to recognize what we're under,
[1:44:52] saints. Amen. He says, "Turn his wife."
[1:44:56] I turned his neighbor against him. I
[1:44:58] turned everything. that didn't make a
[1:45:01] bit of difference. Said, "Though he slay
[1:45:03] me, yet I'll trust him."
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. He says, "I killed his family."
[1:45:08] What? I killed I took this. I did this.
[1:45:11] I done all this. I did this. That other
[1:45:15] still he stood right up.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Though he slay me, yet I'll serve him.
[1:45:19] He's mine. Oh, well, I believe we ought
[1:45:22] to call him out somewhere to a little
[1:45:25] special place and have an adoption.
[1:45:28] That's what the father says. Here we go.
[1:45:30] Now, he says, "I I I've tested him in
[1:45:32] all these areas. I'm going to take him
[1:45:34] out. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going
[1:45:35] to adopt him. I'm going to show that
[1:45:37] he's mine."
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look, he goes he goes, "Now,
[1:45:41] when the father in the Old Testament
[1:45:43] understood
[1:45:45] that his son was come of age and had
[1:45:47] been seasoned out unto adoption, they
[1:45:51] bored they they bored a child. But when
[1:45:53] when there's a son, right? Then he says,
[1:45:56] "But then they'll never be no more than
[1:45:59] just a child, just an ordinary son until
[1:46:03] they mature and show what they are."
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Sons of God are going to manifest in
[1:46:13] this hour.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word of God is being preached
[1:46:17] to to to call into manifestation
[1:46:21] the sons of God. The the earth is
[1:46:23] groaning for the manifestation, but the
[1:46:26] word is what calls them into
[1:46:28] manifestation. Amen. They're born a
[1:46:31] child, but when they're a son, right?
[1:46:32] Then, but then they'll never be no more
[1:46:35] just a child. Then he calls out. Now,
[1:46:37] here we are, church. Are you ready? Now,
[1:46:40] it's a little bit late. Everybody bite
[1:46:42] your finger, pinch your soul, and pluck
[1:46:44] your heart just for a minute. See, now
[1:46:47] we're going to place the church. Now
[1:46:49] when the church gets to that place, he
[1:46:52] says, "Manasses, you belong over here.
[1:46:55] Ephraim, you over here." Then he takes
[1:46:58] them out to a certain place. The father
[1:47:01] does. And he sets him up on a high place
[1:47:05] like this and he has a ceremony and they
[1:47:08] all come around and he said, "I want
[1:47:11] everyone to know that this is my child
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; and I adopt my son. Amen.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Here, listen. Jesus had an adoption.
[1:47:25] Amen. When he went up on the mountain,
[1:47:27] Amen. Glory to God. And and Moses and
[1:47:29] Elijah were there and and and the
[1:47:31] apostles were there and they and they
[1:47:33] turned around and says, "Should we build
[1:47:35] a a a tabernacle for for each of you?"
[1:47:38] No. Then the voice said, "This is my
[1:47:41] son.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; This is my beloved son. You and I, we
[1:47:47] are the sons and daughters of God. Hear
[1:47:50] ye [screaming]
[1:47:51] him.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; You got to recognize the dispensational
[1:47:54] change of the word. Amen. He says, "Now
[1:47:57] watch. Here's my son. I adopt him into
[1:48:00] my family. Although he's been my son
[1:48:03] since he was born.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; You always were a son of God.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; But since he received the Holy Ghost,
[1:48:12] he's been my son. But now I'm going to
[1:48:14] place him positionally in authority.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; What he fires is fired.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Satan out. You can't stay here no more.
[1:48:25] You out. This is disease. You out.
[1:48:28] Financial burden. You [screaming] out.
[1:48:30] Kick him out. That comes with authority.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; That comes as a son of God. What he
[1:48:36] hires is hired.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. He starts to speak the
[1:48:41] word. starts to place sons and daughters
[1:48:42] of God by the by the ministry of the
[1:48:45] word. Amen. Glory to God. Let's go to
[1:48:47] the next scripture here. We're winding
[1:48:49] down, saints. Amen. First Corinthians,
[1:48:52] it says, "If the whole body were an eye,
[1:48:55] where were the hearing? If the whole
[1:48:57] were hearing, where were the smelling?
[1:48:59] But now hath God set." Set means
[1:49:02] positioned.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Positioned sons and daughters. This word
[1:49:07] that's being preached is to place you,
[1:49:10] position you as a son, an adopted son of
[1:49:13] God, so that you can receive your
[1:49:14] inheritance.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; You haven't received that inheritance
[1:49:17] yet.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, what? Let's move on. This is going
[1:49:22] to this only gets better, saints. This
[1:49:25] inheritance that that if we had listen,
[1:49:27] if we received our inheritance, you
[1:49:29] wouldn't be here.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll explain that more as we
[1:49:34] move on. He says, "But now hath God set
[1:49:36] the members, every one of them, in the
[1:49:39] body, as he hath pleased, as it pleases
[1:49:43] him." So don't you be complaining. Go to
[1:49:46] the next slide here. He says here in
[1:49:47] adoption 1960, he says, "Now, who could
[1:49:50] doubt that?" That's what Paul said.
[1:49:53] That's Paul's scripture. That's Paul's
[1:49:55] writing. That's what he taught his
[1:49:57] church. the church positionally before
[1:50:00] the foundations of the world. When God
[1:50:03] in his labor pain was bringing forth
[1:50:06] bringing forth you knowing what you
[1:50:09] would do, he positionally placed you
[1:50:12] into his own body to what? To be a
[1:50:15] housewife,
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; to be a farmer,
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; to be a preacher, to be a prophet, to be
[1:50:21] this or to be that? He placed you
[1:50:24] positionally because he knew what you
[1:50:27] would be in this end time.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; He knew what he would need you to
[1:50:34] manifest in this end time so that you
[1:50:37] could edify the body of Christ so that
[1:50:39] you could be a nourishment to the body
[1:50:41] so that you could be really an adopted
[1:50:45] son or daughter of God. You say a
[1:50:48] farmer. No, you're a son. You say a
[1:50:51] housewife. No, you're also a daughter of
[1:50:55] the living God. Amen. It's not just
[1:50:57] housewife, not just son. It's not just a
[1:51:00] It's It says the Lord predestinated you
[1:51:03] for that position in order to display
[1:51:06] his authority by his word in you.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So you housewife,
[1:51:14] you're going to be a testimony
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; and you will stand as a testimony on the
[1:51:18] day of that judgment.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; When somebody comes out and says, "Well,
[1:51:21] I was only a housewife."
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; So was she her sitting with Christ at
[1:51:27] the throne at the judgment seat?
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Her him.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; That that that that factory worker guy
[1:51:36] who was constantly, you know, praying
[1:51:38] over his food. That guy who was
[1:51:41] constantly telling me about the goodness
[1:51:43] of God.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, that guy. That woman. Amen. But the
[1:51:48] battles are too great. Why is it so
[1:51:50] difficult? Why must we bear this
[1:51:52] reproach for the word? Amen. Because the
[1:51:54] Lord is looking for maturity.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; He's looking for character. He's looking
[1:51:59] for you to be everything that he wants
[1:52:02] you to be. Amen. What does the testing
[1:52:04] create in us? Character. Let the
[1:52:07] musicians come. I'm not going to move on
[1:52:09] here. There's there's there's more that
[1:52:11] I' that I've got here, but next week
[1:52:15] we're going to break into this next
[1:52:17] aspect.
[1:52:18] And and
[1:52:20] you know, it's it's wonderful. This is
[1:52:22] what I was I was you know, you know,
[1:52:24] when a preacher gets up and he comes to
[1:52:27] preach a message, he's got the end in
[1:52:29] the back of his mind of what he's
[1:52:31] working towards. He knows what the end
[1:52:34] result is going to produce. He's looking
[1:52:37] for that manifestation of God. Amen. And
[1:52:39] so that's that, you know, that that
[1:52:42] that's what excites us as ministers to
[1:52:45] see what God is producing in our lives.
[1:52:47] But today, God just wanted to deal with
[1:52:49] these things. I hope that, you know,
[1:52:51] that that that maybe the Holy Spirit,
[1:52:53] you know, exposed a little something in
[1:52:55] your life or somewhere where, you know,
[1:52:57] you've let a squatter in and, you know,
[1:52:59] but he's saying, "No, no, you you you
[1:53:01] possess it. It's yours. I've given it to
[1:53:03] you. It's your inheritance. It's you
[1:53:07] just need to obtain it. It's it's
[1:53:09] coming. It's you're you're you're you're
[1:53:11] slowly line upon line, precept upon
[1:53:14] precept, here a little, there a little.
[1:53:16] God is producing sons and daughters.
[1:53:20] Amen. Praise God. I'm excited about the
[1:53:23] word of God. Praise God. Let's sing that
[1:53:26] song. We are heirs. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:53:30] Praise God.
[1:53:33] Oh, we are air.
[1:53:36] Is that the right key?
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; No, higher.
