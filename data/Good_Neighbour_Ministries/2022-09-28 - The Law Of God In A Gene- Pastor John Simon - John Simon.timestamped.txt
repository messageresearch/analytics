[23:48] and I pray the Lord and bless you in
[23:50] every way as you approach the challenges
[23:53] and blessings of this week let's just
[23:56] pause for a minute and pray for the
[24:00] people in Florida where the storm is now
[24:04] going over them we know we have a lot of
[24:07] our churches and Brethren down there but
[24:12] regardless even if they weren't there we
[24:14] just pray for the people if they can't
[24:18] be saved spiritually at least may God
[24:20] save them naturally right now with the
[24:24] trials of life that they're going
[24:26] through praise God hallelujah our
[24:29] gracious Heavenly Father
[24:32] Wireless Tempest is Raging around around
[24:37] them
[24:39] while oh God the wild winds blow
[24:43] Darkness all around
[24:46] we see father those that did not heed
[24:51] the warning
[24:52] now being caught in the midst of all
[24:55] this
[24:56] but we plead and ask for mercy and Grace
[25:00] father
[25:02] uh as Jesus himself said father forgive
[25:06] them for they know not what they do may
[25:10] the great Holy Spirit
[25:12] now move over that region and watch over
[25:17] your beloved you're elected your true
[25:20] children your seed wherever they are
[25:24] father because there were so many lepers
[25:28] in Israel but Elijah only healed one so
[25:31] many sick were there but Jesus only
[25:34] healed so many the elect the flock of
[25:38] God amongst you granted father wherever
[25:42] they are that you will keep them
[25:45] preserve them and protect them and hide
[25:49] them in the cleft of the rock truly hide
[25:52] them Lord hide them till the Tempest be
[25:55] overpassed we give you glory and honor
[25:58] in Jesus name amen praise the Lord
[26:02] hallelujah may the Lord bless you
[26:05] out of the prophecy of Joel chapter 2 uh
[26:12] reading the 25th uh verse
[26:19] this is a well-known scripture
[26:24] and it reads
[26:26] and I will restore to you the years that
[26:31] the locusts had eaten
[26:34] and the conquer worm and the caterpillar
[26:38] and the Palmer worm my great Army which
[26:42] I sent among you praise the Lord father
[26:46] we thank you for this the reading of Thy
[26:48] word we pray Lord now you would lead us
[26:52] into the things things of life and
[26:56] enrich us strictness father as we go
[26:59] forth back into this world with all of
[27:03] its strife and struggles and our lives
[27:08] to shine and to bring glory to you for
[27:11] we ask it in Jesus name amen the Lord
[27:14] bless you praise the Lord
[27:19] now this uh maybe
[27:24] a sermon that you may say I've heard it
[27:28] already
[27:29] but truly uh brother Branham said these
[27:34] things but he still left it uh left
[27:38] these things that these young men that
[27:42] he promised in this word in his prophecy
[27:45] that they will come and I'm only hitting
[27:49] the highlights but they'll break it down
[27:53] so that you'll have a better
[27:56] understanding praise the Lord so and
[27:59] because these things are not coming into
[28:01] their application
[28:03] right uh he was speaking and putting
[28:06] those things out
[28:08] some of which applied back then but in
[28:12] the spirit of Prophecy he was also
[28:14] putting out the word in every way that
[28:18] will apply to the lives of the elect for
[28:21] this hour
[28:24] amen so he's speaking about restoration
[28:29] and uh using Merriam Webster's
[28:33] Dictionary he asked uh what restore
[28:37] means what does it mean what does it
[28:40] mean and he says here now the the right
[28:43] definition for restore it means to
[28:48] return
[28:49] something back to its original owner
[28:53] amen praise God
[28:56] it also means to bring back to its
[29:01] former state
[29:02] foreign
[29:03] or bring back to its former condition
[29:11] then we can enforce a claim
[29:14] for something to be restored
[29:18] amen praise the Lord of course you do
[29:21] that if it belongs to you
[29:23] right if it belongs to you you force it
[29:26] to be restored back that's just a little
[29:29] definition of uh what restore means
[29:34] praise God then he goes to the fact that
[29:37] he's talking and he's saying well you
[29:41] know uh there's a brother the other day
[29:45] that lost his vehicle and he couldn't
[29:49] find it he didn't know where it was
[29:52] and so brother sutman and and some of
[29:57] the others four or five men they came to
[30:00] me and uh brother Branham what can we do
[30:04] he says well let's pray
[30:07] and he said we knelt and we prayed and
[30:11] pleaded this man's case before God Amen
[30:16] we do that right here in the prayer
[30:18] meeting
[30:18] and we see the hands of God praise the
[30:22] Lord Jesus amen
[30:24] and so I took the Word of Promise and
[30:29] sent it forth and the great Holy Spirit
[30:32] took that word and served as Solomons
[30:38] a vision then broke
[30:42] and I saw that man going towards Bowling
[30:46] Green Kentucky with a yellow shirt on
[30:51] driving the Holy Spirit Then Came Upon
[30:55] him and began to condemn him
[30:59] see and he turned around about halfway
[31:04] I saw him come back
[31:08] and parked that car on a certain Street
[31:12] over the river and I told them where it
[31:16] was and the the breadman I told him he
[31:20] said thus say it the Lord and they they
[31:25] started out on the road and there was
[31:29] the car
[31:30] accepting we're on the road there half
[31:34] empty with gasoline the amount they used
[31:37] up you know to drive around you see he
[31:41] says what was that
[31:43] what really was that what is it
[31:48] it was enforcing the claim
[31:52] it was saying to the devil give back
[31:56] that which you took or what he took away
[31:59] give back praise the name of the Lord
[32:02] see that is it what it's talking about
[32:07] when it says restore
[32:10] it's Satan is being told restore give
[32:14] back what you took away or tried to take
[32:19] away you see oh my now if Satan robbed
[32:23] you of your privileges amen and we as
[32:27] Believers have privileges from God in
[32:30] his word
[32:32] and we have got to enforce our claim
[32:36] because Satan is not just going to come
[32:39] and give it to you he wants to keep it
[32:42] as long as he can
[32:44] and if you don't go and say give me back
[32:48] what I had loose what I had loose that
[32:53] bag loose this hand it back to me
[32:57] restore it back and if it's a personal
[33:00] thing within your own self your mood
[33:03] whatever it is
[33:05] God wants you to be able to tell Satan
[33:08] let go and let me restore back to my
[33:13] former state
[33:15] my former condition
[33:17] that I was in I want the joy I want the
[33:21] peace I want the love I want the grace I
[33:24] want your hand on my life I want to be
[33:26] restored back to my former estate my
[33:30] former condition that I want to be in or
[33:34] praise God hallelujah amen you see when
[33:38] you do that I want you to know
[33:42] without being a son or daughter of God
[33:46] you have a right by the Holy Spirit to
[33:50] enforce the claim of God and bring it
[33:53] back
[33:54] hallelujah oh praise God if you're
[33:58] reflected you have the same right
[34:00] give me back my health
[34:03] what right you've got to hold on to my
[34:05] health when Jesus already the Bible says
[34:08] by his stripes we are healed
[34:12] when the lamb has already paid the price
[34:14] on the cross what right do you have to
[34:17] hold on to my healing hold on to my help
[34:20] my being what right of you to have this
[34:24] pain this ache whatever it is what right
[34:27] you have no rights because the lamb paid
[34:30] the price the lamb died for me and by
[34:34] his name by his stripes we are healed
[34:36] amen we are delivered him and we
[34:39] demanded so for the glory of God
[34:42] hallelujah amen yes sir you see you have
[34:47] that right as a son or a daughter of God
[34:50] amen if he's Afflicted you made you sick
[34:55] you have a right to enforce the laws of
[34:59] God by his stripes it says we are healed
[35:04] you have that right to to not just
[35:07] repeat the words but we're just I'm
[35:10] going to get to that in a minute
[35:12] you see now but the fact is we have the
[35:16] right you believe it
[35:18] I believe it we have the right to uh of
[35:22] course make that claim Hallelujah bring
[35:26] him back Satan turn us loose Satan
[35:30] you're you're trying to take him out
[35:33] yonder to death but reclaim him to come
[35:37] back in the name of Jesus Christ
[35:39] hallelujah amen and that's the right we
[35:43] have and that's right is being enforced
[35:46] by believers
[35:48] get away from this idea that the entire
[35:53] bride is going to enforce these claims
[35:57] that as a church the group is going to
[36:00] do it listen this thing is happening
[36:03] already and it's happening so simple and
[36:07] so humble if you're not watching it will
[36:10] go right past you
[36:12] do you know Believers are now raising
[36:14] the Dead
[36:15] but because it's not making a big splash
[36:19] it's a big advertisement and a big show
[36:22] nobody knows anything about
[36:24] and that member a Believer or Believers
[36:27] may not want to even tell anybody about
[36:30] it just want God to be glorified because
[36:33] if God knows the works that he is doing
[36:36] then God will take the glory and God
[36:39] will reward and bless that believer that
[36:42] saint that son that daughter that child
[36:45] of the Living God
[36:47] Hallelujah yes that is that's what I'm
[36:51] talking about
[36:53] enforcement Amen to restore things back
[36:58] to their natural condition again
[37:02] Hallelujah A Woman's Health restored
[37:06] back a man's health
[37:09] restored back a man is sick of baby is
[37:14] sick a woman may be sick they are out of
[37:17] their natural state they're out of their
[37:20] natural
[37:21] conditions Hallelujah then we have the
[37:26] right to enforce our Acclaim and bring
[37:29] them back to their original position for
[37:32] it already tells us by his stripes we
[37:35] are healed
[37:37] Hallelujah yes and you have a right to
[37:41] enforce that law
[37:43] you have a right to enforce that law and
[37:46] the law Giver the Holy Spirit himself is
[37:50] here the great agent of God
[37:54] and see it's done that way
[37:58] listen close now
[38:01] we the only way
[38:05] that he can walk work
[38:08] and this law can work is when you let
[38:13] him work
[38:15] amen and you've got to believe it for
[38:20] there is a law
[38:21] praise God if I ever get see there's a
[38:26] law and a law given almost
[38:29] amongst everything praise God everything
[38:34] has a law amen you know that over months
[38:40] we have been looking at the God's law of
[38:44] a seed
[38:45] right God's law of a seed well tonight I
[38:51] just want to say it this way or uh cause
[38:54] it to be this topic God's law in the
[38:57] gene
[38:59] amen one is a natural seed Genesis 1 11
[39:05] every seed must bring forth after its
[39:09] kind
[39:11] Hallelujah now uh that's not just for
[39:15] the natural seed that was natural seed
[39:18] was only to show us the power of the law
[39:24] in a gene a person with the gene of God
[39:28] in them are the ones that have the right
[39:31] to enforce and claim that by the word of
[39:35] God for the promises unto you
[39:38] the word of God is unto you Hallelujah
[39:41] and only you with the gene life of God
[39:46] in you has the power to Quicken that
[39:49] word for the word to come to life and
[39:52] for the world to move and to bring to
[39:55] you that which you desire amen praise
[39:58] God now this is no formula that I'm
[40:01] giving here for power with God or
[40:05] spirituality it's either you have
[40:08] eternal life which is a gift of God
[40:11] or you're a church Gore uh you may be
[40:14] religious you may be in the message but
[40:16] if that life is not in you you're just a
[40:19] church Gore and you want to enjoy
[40:21] religious worship and religious readings
[40:24] and religious uh preaching and wonderful
[40:27] sermons and everything else that's
[40:30] marvelous wonderful but without the
[40:32] spirit of Revelation without being
[40:35] certain of God in the recognition of the
[40:38] gene or a peace of God is within you
[40:42] then you are just going through emotions
[40:45] and and things like that only the gene
[40:49] The Original
[40:51] Seed of God can be certain of his word
[40:54] certain of God certain of the claims and
[40:58] only they will have the right when they
[41:00] wake up to recognize that they are
[41:03] amateur amateur Gods common geodes the
[41:10] children of the most high with the right
[41:13] praise God Hallelujah to speak the word
[41:16] believe the word receive the promise of
[41:19] the word and force it in the name of
[41:22] Jesus Christ
[41:23] somewhere
[41:26] where brother Branham said he was in
[41:28] South Africa and looked through his his
[41:31] binoculars and there in his moleculars
[41:34] he saw the a lion had killed some animal
[41:40] but he said he hadn't completely killed
[41:43] it he deliberately left it so he could
[41:45] still jump and move but it couldn't get
[41:47] away or go anywhere because he was right
[41:50] there but was giving the Cubs
[41:53] to a chance to practice their hunting
[41:57] and he was looking through his glasses
[42:00] while the lion cubs are jumping on the
[42:03] thing and using their claws and
[42:06] everything else like that like they
[42:08] think that they are real lions and real
[42:12] hunters and everything else well it's
[42:14] like Zach brothers and sisters we are
[42:18] mini
[42:19] Gods Messiah X amen and God that let the
[42:24] prophet said Jesus didn't finish
[42:27] everything on the earth that he had to
[42:30] do before he left the first time he left
[42:34] some of that word to be fulfilled now in
[42:38] this hour this day that we are living in
[42:41] and you and I and those who truly
[42:44] believe are the ones selected for this
[42:48] time this purpose to fulfill the rest of
[42:51] the word amen hallelujah amen there's a
[42:56] law amongst everything
[42:58] do you know that even the fish has a law
[43:02] amen praise God Amen Hallelujah okay
[43:07] I'll leave that alone you see a fish can
[43:10] stand up here in water
[43:14] and he has a lot within him he could
[43:17] just let go
[43:21] and when he lets go
[43:24] of what's in him
[43:27] it can make him sink right to the bottom
[43:30] amen and he'll just let go
[43:34] Amen to the Bottom of the Sea and that
[43:38] even won't bother him a bit right it
[43:41] won't break one cell in his body
[43:44] doing that
[43:46] now you see if you try to do that that
[43:50] law is not in you Amen in other words
[43:54] what he's saying there you have a
[43:56] different law
[43:58] that law is not in you God didn't make
[44:02] you to be a fish but the law for
[44:04] whatever God Made You and place you
[44:07] don't hear for that law is already in
[44:09] you
[44:11] and that Lodge is trying to show us just
[44:15] like the fish is able to uh enforce that
[44:20] law in himself the law that is related
[44:24] to you is already in you and that's the
[44:28] law that you have got to allow that to
[44:31] work amen praise God hallelujah amen
[44:36] now that law is not in you it's not in
[44:40] our natural being for us to do that to
[44:43] go like a fish in that way you see you
[44:46] can't do it
[44:48] but a fish can do it because that law is
[44:52] in him
[44:53] how to deflate himself of air and such a
[44:58] way that he want was open you see he he
[45:02] is made that way already
[45:06] and he knows that he has made that way
[45:10] hallelujah what I'm saying is that
[45:13] people were believing all the time but
[45:15] and people were following the message
[45:17] all the time but we have come to know
[45:20] that the gene of God is in US
[45:24] we have come to know that the seed will
[45:29] bring forth after its kind
[45:31] we want to expand but you stop and think
[45:34] what the Jesus these seed we are seeds
[45:37] but he is the original seed look what
[45:41] came out of his life and every seed been
[45:45] forth after its kind so there's healing
[45:47] in you there's Deliverance in you that's
[45:50] casting out the devils in you oh there's
[45:52] power within you it's not some effort
[45:56] you have to put out some fasting or
[45:59] prayer to bring it down it's already in
[46:02] You by the grace of God is to recognize
[46:05] it Hallelujah the fish he says knows it
[46:09] and because he knows it it can work
[46:13] he begins to know it and it starts to
[46:16] work in him and takes him down amen
[46:19] praise God hallelujah oh praise God the
[46:23] fish doesn't have to go on exercise
[46:26] did the fish have to exercise his lungs
[46:29] to
[46:30] practice having his lungs inflate and
[46:34] deflate in the right way before he goes
[46:36] down no it's natural in him he didn't
[46:39] have to think about it he doesn't even
[46:41] think of himself that well I'm a fish
[46:43] I'm supposed to do that I'm sure if a
[46:46] fish could think that he wouldn't have
[46:48] to think that because he was mad that
[46:50] way and we weren't Dead The Way We Are
[46:53] Made We Are Who We Are by the grace of
[46:56] God
[46:57] Paul said I am what I am by the grace of
[47:01] God it's nothing that we do or I can do
[47:04] but it's what he has done what he is
[47:07] doing in us and through us for his own
[47:10] Glory
[47:12] hallelujah amen hallelujah what's that
[47:16] fish now that fish before he goes down
[47:20] to the depths of the ocean he has to go
[47:23] over to Neptune University and study is
[47:29] that right he goes there to study how to
[47:31] inflate and deflate before he goes to
[47:34] the bottom of the ocean no no no no no
[47:36] no no it's natural to him it's automatic
[47:40] to him that life is in him to cause him
[47:44] to be able to do that whenever he wants
[47:48] for the glory and praise of God
[47:50] hallelujah now Prophet is using fish and
[47:54] so on like that but these are all types
[47:57] and shadows that he is literally using
[48:01] for those who are supposed to see we'll
[48:04] see and who are not supposed to see and
[48:07] understand well not see and understand
[48:08] they'll think it's childishness they'll
[48:11] think it's nothing to that or some
[48:13] imagination what are you talking about
[48:15] Hallelujah but he's trying to get us to
[48:19] clearly see not the law in a fish not
[48:22] just the law in the natural seed but the
[48:25] law that is now working in the genes
[48:29] in the seed of God
[48:32] there's a law working for his glory and
[48:36] for his honor Hallelujah oh yes
[48:40] we see it now
[48:42] for that law was in Christ
[48:46] Hallelujah that law was in Christ now
[48:50] the law is in man
[48:53] amen now you see he's speaking but he's
[48:56] speaking General right now that's
[48:59] General uh if if people want to take
[49:02] that and just take it generally but we
[49:05] know now what he was talking about the
[49:07] law has now come and it's now in man
[49:10] it's found the genes it's supposed the
[49:13] the people it's supposed to be in and
[49:16] the genes are there in the earth amen
[49:21] you can bury that man to the deepest
[49:25] grave
[49:26] you can put him to the deepest sea
[49:29] hallelujah or the lowest hell there's a
[49:35] law of the spirit of God in him that
[49:39] will raise him up again Hallelujah
[49:41] That's the Law of the spirit of God in a
[49:45] form of a gene hallelujah amen given to
[49:49] each elected person to raise them up
[49:52] again we have a guaranteed Resurrection
[49:55] because of the presence of the gene of
[49:59] God or the seed of life that dwells
[50:03] within us for his glory and for his
[50:05] honor praise the name of the Lord amen
[50:08] hallelujah amen praise God so anyone
[50:13] that knows or certain that they have
[50:17] that Gene of God within them has a right
[50:20] to enforce their claims
[50:23] you have a right to enforce any claims
[50:26] you see in the word
[50:28] amen because we have boundaries amen
[50:32] praise God I told it so many times but
[50:34] I'll tell it again it's just a natural
[50:36] thing where in the early days in
[50:38] Pentecost you know uh Faith was
[50:40] something you just talked about great
[50:42] faith and this brother was saying Oh
[50:44] Brother Simon I really believe in God
[50:47] for a car I got to get a nice brand new
[50:50] car and then he was in we were done in
[50:54] the marketplace because we were preached
[50:56] everywhere preaching in the marketplace
[50:58] and he went and he saw a beautiful car
[51:01] that's the car I like he laid his hands
[51:04] on the car oh God I claimed this car in
[51:08] the name of Jesus then he heard a voice
[51:11] saying get your cup which is hand off of
[51:14] my car
[51:17] how could God give you a car that you
[51:20] already gave me right see he had the
[51:23] wrong idea of what it is to take the
[51:27] word and claim what you are but when
[51:30] that law of God is in you it directs you
[51:35] it guides you
[51:37] and takes you to what is yours you see
[51:41] when that law amen praise God when you
[51:46] say law is it the word
[51:49] amen it was the law in the Old Testament
[51:51] is the word over here so don't get mixed
[51:55] up by him going back and forth using
[51:57] that word amen now we know that this is
[52:01] how it is that once that spirit that law
[52:06] of that spirit of God is in you that
[52:12] will raise him up again
[52:14] what's going to raise him up my mind is
[52:16] not going to raise himself up but the
[52:19] the spirit Paul causes the quickening
[52:21] power is already there and because it's
[52:24] there doesn't matter if you die proven
[52:27] by the typology of Elisha when he was
[52:33] dead and the true man a dead man in his
[52:37] grave
[52:38] and he dropped on the body of Elijah and
[52:42] the Bible says he bumps right out of the
[52:44] grave and started running amen why
[52:47] because he there was life in the
[52:51] quickening power the law of life was
[52:54] still in the bones that were laying
[52:56] there in the graveside and I believe
[52:58] that same law of life is in every one of
[53:02] us here tonight every believer every
[53:05] true seed of God wherever they are if
[53:08] they're truly believe it and God catches
[53:12] something in your heart where you're
[53:13] certain and no not a fanatic but you are
[53:17] certain of God hallelujah then we find
[53:20] it begins to work through you becomes
[53:24] activated was laying in you all your
[53:27] life but only on potential amen the
[53:30] potentials of God but now everything is
[53:33] coming into acting everything is coming
[53:34] into life everything is coming in the
[53:37] movement for the glory of God hallelujah
[53:39] now
[53:41] he said do you know that a bird also has
[53:45] a love
[53:46] amen now its body is material
[53:52] it's but it's EarthBound
[53:55] and it sets on the earth here but yet it
[53:59] knows that it has a law already within
[54:03] it
[54:04] that when it is ready it can spread its
[54:08] wings and fly out the sight oh I hope
[54:11] you are becoming conscious of that fact
[54:13] that you have you know already that that
[54:17] law is in you and whatever you you're
[54:21] ready that you can take your flight amen
[54:24] not in the natural air but you can be
[54:27] caught up with the Lord and meet him in
[54:29] the air praise the Lord for his glory
[54:32] amen you see that's against all their
[54:36] science amen that's uh they will say
[54:40] it's Earthbound Hallelujah they will say
[54:43] gravitation can hold it back here but
[54:47] with that it can defy gravitation Lord
[54:51] of God hallelujah with God's life God's
[54:54] seed in you you can defy gravitation not
[54:59] to put on a show but when God is ready
[55:02] he will break every gravitational pull
[55:06] and take us out of here
[55:09] amen you see because it already has the
[55:14] right you've got the right within you
[55:16] already to lift itself right off of that
[55:20] and go right on out because it has to
[55:24] put that law that's in itself to work
[55:30] and it's built that way to possess
[55:34] that law amen aren't you glad with God
[55:38] made us that way
[55:39] that we were purposed by him for his
[55:43] glory now we have also Allah I believe
[55:48] that
[55:50] we have a law and that is the law of
[55:54] life within us the only thing you have
[55:57] to do amen you see you've made and born
[56:02] and he already placed us here in the
[56:05] body of Jesus Christ as sons and others
[56:09] of God so then if you know that you
[56:13] don't have to knuckle down to the devil
[56:17] anymore
[56:18] amen he can't turn it back you already
[56:21] songs you are ready daughters you are
[56:24] ready children he can't turn it back no
[56:27] matter what trial whatever situation he
[56:30] brings towards you amen don't you
[56:33] knuckle down to the devil because we got
[56:36] a law in us hallelujah that law of the
[56:40] Holy Spirit Hallelujah the only thing
[56:45] you have to do
[56:47] is to know how
[56:51] to know how to let go and let God have
[56:57] his way
[56:59] let the gene go to work
[57:02] let go and let God have his way you see
[57:05] but you keep fighting it
[57:10] you keep fighting it and when you do
[57:13] that it will never work it won't but
[57:18] when you let go and let God Rest in him
[57:23] then it'll go to work praise God
[57:26] hallelujah amen praise God I thank God
[57:29] now just think of it he says here if
[57:33] that little fish says oh wait I've got
[57:36] to exercise I've got to
[57:39] catch my breath real good let me breathe
[57:42] in a little oxygen Let Me In Me and see
[57:46] if I can go down
[57:47] and if he does that it won't work he'll
[57:51] burst right open because he's not
[57:53] certain you're not confident
[57:55] amen see now what if that word was to
[58:00] say Amen oh I'll see how fast I can run
[58:04] on the road down here and maybe I can
[58:08] run so fast that I'll take off
[58:12] oh my I wonder if I could be really
[58:16] successful here if I could really run on
[58:19] the earth and become so successful until
[58:22] I'm ready no amen see he won't do it
[58:26] he'll fall down he's got to know
[58:32] amen
[58:34] oh my he's got to know how that law
[58:39] in him can control him
[58:42] amen praise God and the same way it is
[58:46] with us it isn't what we fight
[58:51] it isn't us pulling
[58:54] right it isn't us worrying
[58:59] right oh or if this don't happen if I
[59:02] don't get this if I don't get that it's
[59:06] just to know that the law of life is
[59:09] already in you and then let go and let
[59:14] God work amen hallelujah then when you
[59:19] do that he will take you to your healing
[59:23] if you do that he'll take you to the
[59:26] baptism of the spirit or anything he has
[59:30] promised in his word for them claims he
[59:34] is given them to us and by letting go we
[59:38] are letting God take us to it amen let
[59:42] go and let him take you to it praise God
[59:45] for all my I know I've preached on these
[59:48] things from different angles and
[59:50] different ways but we see now the
[59:53] clarity because we go back and read some
[59:56] of these messages read before but the
[59:58] Bible becomes like a new Bible even the
[1:00:01] message becomes like a new message you
[1:00:04] start seeing all kinds of things in it
[1:00:06] that God had there all the time but you
[1:00:09] couldn't see it before the time now is
[1:00:12] the time and the word is making itself
[1:00:14] clear
[1:00:16] amen praise God oh my it's just like you
[1:00:22] see
[1:00:23] letting go and letting God you know
[1:00:27] praise God letting Gene go and let God
[1:00:31] work through it if an officer
[1:00:35] was to take a fellow who stole your
[1:00:38] property
[1:00:39] taking him to jail
[1:00:41] and you kept pulling the officer back
[1:00:44] saying well I don't know whether he
[1:00:48] should you should do this or do that you
[1:00:51] see you don't do that let the officer
[1:00:55] just do his job let him go let him do
[1:00:59] his work

[1:01:06] let the officer do his work amen that's
[1:01:09] the way you do it praise God oh my God
[1:01:14] will rise up within you and he will do
[1:01:19] his work praise the Lord O praise God

[1:01:29] because we're going to start talking
[1:01:31] about uh how the the Sun the the rising
[1:01:37] of the Sun how that forces or enforces

[1:01:48] to force everything to come back to life
[1:01:51] we'll talk about that next week by the
[1:01:53] grace of God but tonight we just touched
