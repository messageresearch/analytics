[0:19] his car and child.

[0:27] and from his brother.
[0:35] The love of God
[0:39] is greater
[0:42] than tongue or pain
[0:46] can ever touch.
[0:50] It goes beyond
[0:54] the highest star
[0:57] and reaches to

[5:06] Amen. I want to try out a song. It's an
[5:08] older song. We'll try and see if we can
[5:11] get it tonight. But it came to my heart
[5:12] today and I want to try see if we can do
[5:14] it. Okay.
[5:16] Once I alone
[5:20] beside the highway begging.
[5:24] His eyes were blind.
[5:28] The light could not see.
[5:32] He clutched his rods
[5:35] and shivered in the shadows.
[5:39] Then Jesus came and made his darkness.
[5:47] When Jesus comes,
[5:50] the tempest power is broken.
[5:54] When Jesus comes, the tears are wiped
[5:59] away.
[6:02] He takes the gloom
[6:04] and fill the life with glory
[6:09] for all is changed.
[6:12] And Jesus comes to save
[6:16] from home and friends.
[6:19] The evil spirit drove him
[6:23] among the tombs. He dwelt in misery.
[6:30] He cut himself
[6:33] as demonstr
[6:35] possessing.
[6:37] Then Jesus came and set the captives
[6:42] free.
[6:44] When Jesus comes, the tempest bow is
[6:49] broken.
[6:51] When Jesus comes, the tears are wiped
[6:56] away.
[6:59] He takes the gloom.
[7:01] And he fills the life with gloryy
[7:06] for all is changed when Jesus comes to
[7:11] stay.
[7:13] Unclean, unclean,
[7:15] the leopard cried in torment.
[7:20] The death the tongue
[7:22] and helplessness came near.
[7:27] The fear had rage
[7:29] disease had gripped his fix.
[7:34] Then Jesus came and cast out every fear.
[7:40] When Jesus comes, the tempest power is
[7:45] broken.
[7:48] When Jesus comes, the tears are wiped
[7:52] away.
[7:55] He takes the gloom
[7:57] and he fills the life with glory.
[8:02] For all is change when Jesus comes to
[8:07] stay.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; So many today
[8:12] have found a savior able.
[8:16] They could not come. Compassion, lust,
[8:20] and sin.
[8:23] Their broken hearts
[8:25] had left them sad and lonely.
[8:30] And Jesus came and dwelt himself with
[8:34] him.
[8:36] Oh, and Jesus comes.
[8:39] That's his power is broken.
[8:43] When Jesus comes, the tears are w away.
[8:50] He takes the gloom and he fills the life

[8:57] for all is change. When Jes let's sing
[9:02] the chorus once again. When Jesus comes.
[9:04] Oh, when Jesus comes, the tempest power
[9:09] is broken.
[9:11] When Jesus comes, the tears are wiped
[9:16] away.
[9:18] He takes the blue
[9:21] and he fills the life with glory
[9:25] for all.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; When Jesus comes to save,
[9:32] [Music]
[9:34] &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be your name, Lord Jesus.
[9:40] Oh, you came, Lord. That's why we're
[9:42] here tonight. You came into our lives,
[9:45] oh God, and you broke every power, Lord,
[9:50] that Satan had over our lives, Lord. Oh
[9:53] God, you set us free, Father, that we
[9:57] can come. It's not an easy thing, Lord,
[9:59] to come and worship the true and living
[10:02] God in this hour, Lord. We need you to
[10:06] touch us. We need you to come, Lord, and
[10:08] and dwell within us, oh God, and set us
[10:11] free, Lord. And tonight, Lord, we we
[10:13] come with thanksgiving in our hearts, oh
[10:16] God. I know the world just went through
[10:18] a weekend of thanksgiving, Lord. But the
[10:21] bride is here tonight, Lord. And she's
[10:23] thankful every single day, Lord God.
[10:26] every moment of the day that she's
[10:28] awake. Lord, she's thankful, Lord, that
[10:31] oh, the living God came and thought and
[10:36] dwelt in us, oh God. How you would who
[10:39] are we the scripture says that that you
[10:41] would be mindful of us, Lord. And
[10:43] tonight, Lord, you are mindful of us, oh
[10:46] God, gathering us together here, Lord.
[10:49] This is not by chance.
[10:52] This is by purpose, oh God. your purpose
[10:55] that we're gathered here tonight, Lord.
[10:57] Everything, the songs that would be
[10:59] sung, Lord. The people that would be
[11:02] here worshiping, Lord. Lord, the
[11:04] minister that you have ordained, oh God.
[11:07] Lord, you knew before the foundation of
[11:09] the world, Lord, who would be standing
[11:11] in this pulpit tonight, Lord. And you
[11:14] gave him scriptures. You gave him
[11:16] quotes. You gave him a thought tonight,
[11:18] Lord. But we're asking, oh, God. Lord,
[11:21] he doesn't know us. He doesn't know
[11:24] where we are at, Lord. But you know
[11:26] where we're at, Father. You know our
[11:28] hearts tonight, Lord. And we don't look
[11:30] to man. We never look to man. We haven't
[11:33] come in contact with man, Father. But we
[11:35] have come in contact with the
[11:37] supernatural, Lord Jesus. You, Lord. So
[11:40] we ask that you would come, Lord, and
[11:43] possess this vessel that would stand
[11:45] here tonight, Lord, and take control of
[11:48] him. We asking that you would put the
[11:50] man out of the way, Lord. Only done by
[11:53] the Holy Ghost tonight, Father. Lord,
[11:55] because there's eagles here tonight,
[11:57] Lord. There's sons and daughters. We're
[11:59] not just believers, Lord. We're sons and
[12:02] daughters of the living God here
[12:03] tonight, Lord. And Lord, and we want to
[12:06] hear from you, Father. Come tonight and
[12:08] speak to our hearts, oh God. Remove
[12:11] every trap, every snare, every hindrance
[12:13] of the devil. Put a wall of fire and a
[12:15] hedge around the speaker tonight, Lord
[12:17] God, from the fiery darts of the enemy,
[12:19] Lord, and set them free at liberty,
[12:21] Lord, to speak the word of God. Oh,
[12:24] speak, my Lord. Oh, speak tonight,
[12:28] Father, and stir our hearts once again,
[12:31] Lord. Grant these things, Lord. Touch
[12:33] each and everyone. Meet every need,
[12:35] Lord. May we leave these doors and leave
[12:40] this building different than when we
[12:42] came in. Lord, grant these things
[12:44] tonight. Bless each and every one.
[12:46] Father, in Jesus Christ's name we ask.

[16:01] Amen. Praise our God. Hallelujah.
[16:06] Amen. And it's so good to be in the
[16:08] house of the Lord tonight and especially
[16:12] this evening where we have our precious
[16:14] brother Albert Green here all the way
[16:17] from Trinidad. He is a wonderful
[16:21] seasoned minister of the gospel of this
[16:24] message. Amen. Praise God. I met Brother
[16:27] Green back in 1995
[16:30] for the first time. I absolutely fell in
[16:33] love with him. Amen. because he's a
[16:35] wonderful man of God with a heart for
[16:38] the people. Amen. And then I remember,
[16:41] you know, in 1997,
[16:43] we went to visit and um we went to
[16:46] minister myself and brother Tim and
[16:49] brother Green was so gracious to set up
[16:53] nine days of preaching.
[16:56] When I came home, I had to minister the
[16:59] prayer meeting that Friday night, and I
[17:01] ministered, "My God, my God, why hast
[17:04] thou forsaken me?"
[17:07] I was so uh overwhelmed, but the Lord
[17:11] knew exactly what he was doing and uh
[17:14] used our precious brother to to start
[17:16] the roots to go deep. So, with great
[17:20] honor and respect, I welcome our
[17:23] precious brother, Albert Green. Brother,
[17:26] have your liberty. May the Lord bless
[17:28] you and bless us. God bless you.
[17:36] As we are standing, may we take our
[17:39] scripture reading
[17:42] musicians, as somebody say in South
[17:44] Africa, thank you kindly. Singers, thank
[17:47] you kindly.
[17:50] I don't say that in Trinidad. In
[17:52] Trinidad, um, they know it's time to get
[17:54] up.
[17:56] Okay. Wonderful. Just just read a little
[18:00] scripture before you have your seats.
[18:03] Genesis 1
[18:06] 26-
[18:07] 28.
[18:14] Let us join and read together.
[18:17] And God said, "Let us make man in our
[18:21] image,
[18:23] after our likeness, and let them have
[18:26] dominion over the fish of the sea, and
[18:30] over the fowl of the air, and over the
[18:34] cattle, and over all the earth, and over
[18:38] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[18:42] the earth."
[18:44] 27.
[18:45] So God created man,
[18:51] &gt;&gt; created he him.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; Verse 28.
[19:00] And God blessed them. And God said unto
[19:04] them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and
[19:08] replenish the earth, and subdue it, and
[19:12] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[19:16] and over the fowl of the air, and over
[19:19] every living thing
[19:22] that moveth upon the earth." May we bow
[19:25] our heads, bow our hearts. Father,
[19:28] what else can we say but thank you for a
[19:32] glorious opportunity to be in your
[19:34] house. We believe tonight, Lord, this is
[19:36] the best place we could be in. So we
[19:39] thank you, Lord, for your servants. We
[19:42] thank you for this church. We thank you
[19:43] for the officers. We thank you, Lord,
[19:46] and your servant have already told us,
[19:47] Lord, we would leave here better than we
[19:49] came in. We commit ourselves to your
[19:52] care. We pray your blessings be upon us
[19:55] from the pulpit to the pew. Lord God, as
[19:58] your prophet already said, Father God,
[20:01] I've never ministered a message yet, but
[20:03] as the Holy Spirit minister through me
[20:06] and Lord is a prayer of my heart that
[20:08] the Holy Spirit will minister through me
[20:10] and hear through you, Lord, bless them
[20:14] all in Jesus precious name. Amen. And
[20:18] amen and amen. God bless you. be seated
[20:21] by God's grace.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Over, as brother Danny was telling you,
[20:27] over 30 years ago, we have a close
[20:31] relationship with this church and back
[20:33] home.
[20:35] Certainly, special regards to Brother
[20:38] John. Amen. Brother Danny and the
[20:41] officers of the church. If you'll permit
[20:44] me to say uh your precious pastor John
[20:48] as pastor, he set what is a precedent
[20:52] throughout the world. We having a there
[20:54] are a lot of problems throughout the
[20:55] world in what you call succession
[20:57] planning. But brother John has set a
[21:00] model example that I believe would help
[21:03] a lot of people through the world.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; So he had to have a good church to
[21:07] support him. He had to have a a a a good
[21:11] team of people. But what he did, he has
[21:14] set a precedent.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Throughout the world. So as
[21:20] brother John was uh brother Danny was
[21:22] saying, you know, they say first
[21:23] impressions are lasting. So brother John
[21:27] and his team came to Trinidad over 30
[21:30] years ago and they were my first
[21:33] visitors as a pastor.
[21:36] Right. first visitors and as a matter of
[21:40] fact this church is the first church I
[21:41] ministered in in Canada. So we have a
[21:44] lot of first together over 30 years ago.
[21:47] Uh it is said that first impressions are
[21:51] lasting. So for sure brother Danny never
[21:55] forgot those times he had at the Ramla's
[21:58] residence and his visit to Trinidad.
[22:01] There was something about it stays with
[22:03] him. I don't know if brother Mike is
[22:05] here but he will always remain. It was a
[22:07] special time for brother Mike here
[22:10] because when brother Mike came across
[22:11] with us it was during a special time he
[22:14] was going through and he taught us a
[22:16] little chorus in moments like these. So
[22:18] at least let him know we still remember
[22:20] that.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless the Lord. I glad to see the
[22:24] Trinies here. Wonderful Jagenard family.
[22:29] Amen.
[22:31] [Applause]
[22:34] and also our precious sister who was a
[22:37] part of the singing group. I had the
[22:38] honor of marrying them some years ago.
[22:41] So certainly glad to see them. And above
[22:43] all, I do have my nearest dear ones,
[22:46] Canadian visitors with me, my sisters
[22:48] and nieces. I trust God that God richly
[22:51] blessed them.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; And uh other than that, they volunteered
[22:55] to come, right? I didn't have to cajul
[22:58] them. They wanted to do something for me
[23:00] and they volunteered to be here. So I
[23:02] pray God's riches blessing be upon them.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; So I want to share a little thought with
[23:10] you tonight. Amen. The Lord help us. I
[23:15] want to speak to you about you.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; And we come to church to hear hear what
[23:22] the word say about us.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; So I want to speak to you a little.
[23:26] Amen. to you about you and a little
[23:30] thought by God's grace. Amen. A super
[23:34] race.
[23:36] And I will start by using two quotations
[23:39] from God's prophet. The message super
[23:42] sign
[23:44] build a taught by God's grace. The
[23:46] message super sign paragraph 66
[23:51] and 67.
[23:53] Not what you call a super race,
[23:59] but what God calls a super race. You
[24:03] thank God for that.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; God have a super race.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; What God calls a super race because they
[24:12] got what? Super that super race got
[24:16] supernatural power
[24:18] &gt;&gt; with supernatural sign
[24:21] through a supernatural belief in a
[24:24] supernatural word.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; You see what make us super?
[24:29] &gt;&gt; You see what make us super?
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe in a supernatural God.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we identify with a to believe
[24:40] the word is something supernatural. Yes.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; Everybody cannot believe. There are
[24:46] somebody who born to believe.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; There's somebody who has received the
[24:49] gift of believing. Amen. Given a
[24:52] supernatural
[24:54] word from a supernatural God.
[24:58] Amen. You talk about super.
[25:02] Do we have it on the screen? Sorry.
[25:10] Bless the Lord. Should I be getting it
[25:12] on the screen?
[25:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[25:16] Supernatural God paragraph 67
[25:20] in a supernatural body in a natural
[25:23] people.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Are are you following us by God's grace?
[25:28] &gt;&gt; We talking about a supernatural God in a
[25:32] supernatural body in a natural people.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Giving supernatural signs. Hallelujah. a
[25:40] super race.
[25:43] They that know their God shall do
[25:45] exploits,
[25:47] &gt;&gt; great exploits,
[25:48] &gt;&gt; and show a supernatural sign, a people,
[25:52] Abraham's seed, a sign of the
[25:55] supernatural Christ risen from the dead
[25:59] supernaturally.
[26:01] So this is about us. Amen. This is all
[26:05] about us is God's prophet is identifying
[26:08] to us is not what you call super but
[26:12] what God calls super.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; In the message Pogameanian church age.
[26:18] Amen. Paragraph 171. Here is what I'm
[26:22] trying to say to you. The law of
[26:25] reproduction
[26:28] is that each species bring forth after
[26:31] its kind.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even according to Genesis 1:11,
[26:35] and God said, "Let the earth bring forth
[26:38] grass and herb yielding seed, and the
[26:42] fruit tree yielding fruit after his
[26:45] kind, whose seed it is in itself upon
[26:48] the earth." And it was so. Whatever life
[26:52] was in the seed, came forth into a
[26:55] plant,
[26:56] &gt;&gt; and then into a fruit. Yeah.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; The very same law applies to the church
[27:02] today.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; Whatever seed started the church will
[27:06] come forth
[27:07] &gt;&gt; and will be like the original seed
[27:10] &gt;&gt; because it is the same seed.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; In these last days, super race. In these
[27:18] last days, the true bride of Christ,
[27:21] bride church, Christ seed will come to a
[27:24] headstone
[27:25] &gt;&gt; and she Amen. will be the super church.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She will be the super
[27:34] church.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; She will be the super race.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. as she nears him.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; They that in the bride will be so much
[27:45] like him. They will even be in his very
[27:48] image.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; This is in order to be united with him.
[27:53] They will be the very manifestation
[27:57] of the living God.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So church,
[28:02] &gt;&gt; this is what we are called to a super
[28:06] race. Now we are living in a day when
[28:10] everything is super. As a matter of
[28:13] fact, it's no longer super. It's mega.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; You even have mega churches.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; So everything
[28:22] has to be huge. Everything has to be
[28:26] very large. So we are living naturally
[28:30] in a super day.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; Naturally we are living in a super age.
[28:36] Amen.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; You have super jets, super highway.
[28:41] Everything is super.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So man by nature making himself a
[28:48] name. By nature, man want to get make
[28:52] something super. Amen. Man want to make
[28:55] something big. Amen. Man wants to make
[28:58] something bigger than the other.
[29:02] Everyone. Amen. And so there is
[29:06] throughout history the cry about a super
[29:10] race. Amen. A super race is one race
[29:14] ruling over the other.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Hitler once said that we the Germans we
[29:20] are the super race. Amen. Stalin said no
[29:24] we the Russians are the super race.
[29:29] England would say as long as there's a
[29:31] world there will re be an England. So
[29:35] everybody and America saying we'll be
[29:38] great again.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; So throughout the world there is that
[29:44] longing in man to be the super.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Every country, every government, every
[29:52] people wants to be super.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. They all have a
[30:00] super idea.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; But just like Pharaoh,
[30:05] &gt;&gt; just like the all the Caesars,
[30:08] &gt;&gt; all their kingdoms will come to the
[30:11] dust.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; So we thank God for a real super.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; We thank God that we could identify
[30:19] ourselves this evening with a real
[30:22] super.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:25] Hallelujah.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; So by nature, every one of us by nature
[30:32] a sinner man, a fallen son of God, but
[30:36] by nature we want to make something
[30:39] better. Amen. The birds still make the
[30:43] nest the same way. But we are not birds.
[30:46] We are human beings and we want to do
[30:49] something better. Every time in life we
[30:53] want to show improvement. We want you
[30:57] know because something why because
[30:59] something in a man tell a boy there is a
[31:02] better place.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; There's a cry in the human being. There
[31:06] is something more to life.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; So all of us our aim is to have a better
[31:12] car, a better house, a better this, a
[31:16] better that. It is because deep in us
[31:19] there is a cry for something that is
[31:21] better.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; You thank God we know what is better.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; We can appreciate what God what what
[31:28] what we have found what the human being
[31:31] is searching for. By the grace of God we
[31:34] can say thank God I'm anchored in Jesus.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. So the desire for
[31:44] something greater has always been with
[31:48] man. You remember fallen Adam fallen
[31:51] Adam tried to make get some fig leaf
[31:54] because he wanted to make a super
[31:56] religion. He wanted to make his own way
[32:00] and that that is the human being today.
[32:02] They want to make their own way without
[32:06] the word of almighty God. So church this
[32:10] evening we live in a super day. We live
[32:16] in a world of super people. You know
[32:20] that everybody have the fiction. You
[32:22] remember the days of Superman
[32:25] &gt;&gt; because man don't want to be self and
[32:28] that kind of superman led many lives to
[32:31] suicide
[32:32] because man want to be something else.
[32:36] Amen. So man wants to find their own
[32:39] super way and man attitude to find
[32:42] something super is really devil
[32:45] counterfeit. It is not the real thing
[32:48] but we thank God for a super. Amen.
[32:53] Man's achievement will end up as nothing
[32:55] but there is something that is super.
[32:59] There is a super race. So the message
[33:02] super sign where we share that quotation
[33:05] from. Amen. Tells us not what you call
[33:09] super. We call the mega stores, the mega
[33:13] churches, the mega houses, the mega
[33:16] thing, the mega car. Everything natural
[33:20] we look upon to call that super. But
[33:23] brother, sister, by the grace of God,
[33:26] Amen. Amen. is not what you call super.
[33:30] You think about you remember the the
[33:32] Titanic. The Titanic was a man
[33:35] achievement. Amen. That this is the
[33:38] super boat. But where is the Titanic? In
[33:42] the bottom of the sea. So what it means
[33:45] your achievement means nothing without
[33:48] God.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; No matter what we achieve, thank God for
[33:53] what we achieve.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Thank God. Because brother, sister, we
[33:57] thank God for shoes. Amen.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; We thank God for clothes.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; We thank God otherwise we be walking
[34:03] bare feet.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; But that is not God.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That just make life a little
[34:09] easier for us.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; We thank God for a good motor car. It
[34:13] makes life easy for you. But that is not
[34:16] what is super. Amen. So there is a
[34:20] super.
[34:22] God's prophet is speaking about a super
[34:25] race. So, it's not what you call super,
[34:28] but we want what God calls super.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; And I'm saying this evening by the grace
[34:35] of God, we are speaking to you about
[34:38] you. Amen. This is not about somebody
[34:42] else. We are this evening what God calls
[34:47] super. Amen. So, let's get back to
[34:51] Genesis. In Genesis, when God made Adam,
[34:56] everything that God was was reflected in
[35:00] Adam.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Are we in church?
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. God made Adam. And in Adam,
[35:09] everything that God is was reflected
[35:15] through Adam. a super
[35:21] in Adam.
[35:23] Adam had supreme control over the earth.
[35:30] Amen. Adam was in supreme control over
[35:33] the earth. Adam had the authority.
[35:38] Amen. Adam had the authority to subdue
[35:42] the earth.
[35:44] And God, the scripture said, Genesis
[35:46] 1:28, "Bless them," and said unto them,
[35:50] "Be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[35:54] the earth, and subdue it,
[35:58] and have dominion over the fish over the
[36:01] sea, over the fowl of the air, and over
[36:04] every living thing that move upon the
[36:08] earth." So God gave Adam the authority.
[36:14] Yes, he did.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam had the authority to subdue
[36:19] the earth.
[36:21] Adam was really a God man.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; He was not a man. He was a God man.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Everything that God is was reflected in
[36:33] Adam.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Adam was the God of the earth.
[36:39] Amen.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; Adam controlled the earth
[36:42] &gt;&gt; as God controlled the heavens.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God gave Adam the authority. We
[36:51] want to show you where we fell from.
[36:54] Where we fell from, God gave Adam the
[36:58] authority. Adam was a minor God. Do you
[37:03] know Adam didn't have to pray?
[37:08] Adam didn't have to fasten.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Adam didn't have to beg.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Adam didn't have to plead. I don't say,
[37:21] "I don't like you there. You go there."
[37:24] Adam was in control.
[37:28] When Adam spoke,
[37:31] everything obeyed.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything obeyed Adam. God made
[37:39] Adam
[37:41] after his likeness.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Remember the word said, you know, every
[37:47] seed after its kind,
[37:50] &gt;&gt; right? God made Adam in his likeness.
[37:55] Amen. Every seed after its kind. And God
[38:00] said Genesis 1:1 and 12, "Let the earth
[38:04] bring forth grass and herb yielding seed
[38:07] and fruit tree yielding fruit after its
[38:10] kind, whose seed it in is itself upon
[38:13] the earth." And it was so. And the earth
[38:16] brought forth grass and herb yielding
[38:19] seed after its kind, and the tree
[38:21] yielding fruit whose seed was in itself
[38:25] a after its kind. And God saw it was
[38:28] good. Amen.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God, you see now as God's
[38:33] servant taught us, God said it was good.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you something about
[38:38] you. Everything God made was good.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Everything God made was good.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; God had no fault in his first creation.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And my God's prophet tells us if
[38:57] God could not find a fault in his first
[38:59] creation, he could never find a fault in
[39:02] his second creation.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Are you a part of his second creation?
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Are you a part of a group that is born a
[39:09] new?
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Are you a part of a group that's born
[39:13] out of him? He said God found no fault
[39:17] in his first creation.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Everything God did was good. Amen.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was his first creation.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; We thank God we are his second creation.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are his second creation.
[39:35] So we see with Adam,
[39:38] he had power to subdue
[39:42] everything.
[39:44] Amen. Adam was just like God. Every seed
[39:50] after its kind. Amen. Adam was
[39:53] automatically like God. Adam was a
[39:58] supreme being.
[40:00] Adam had supreme control.
[40:04] Adam there was an eternal person.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Adam there was the king of the earth.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam had rulership.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Think about where we fail from. Adam had
[40:21] dominion.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was the God of this
[40:26] world.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam was in God's image.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Adam was in God's likeness.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, church.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; But it is after the fall.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; After the fall, man was born in sin.
[40:47] After the fall, man was born in sin.
[40:51] Amen. After the fall, we end up to be in
[40:54] the likeness and image of fallen Adam,
[40:59] not in the image of God. So the fall in
[41:02] the garden of Eden
[41:04] distorted a good pity.
[41:07] The fall in the garden of Eden spoiled
[41:10] the pitier.
[41:12] Now since then man was born without
[41:18] godship.
[41:20] Man born without power to subdue. Now we
[41:24] had to run from a dog.
[41:28] The power to subdue. We born without it.
[41:33] We born without power to have dominion.
[41:38] Amen. Man now born because of the fall.
[41:44] Before the fall, Amen. Man was man had
[41:49] rulership. Man had dominion. Man was the
[41:52] God of the earth. But now since the
[41:55] fall, Amen. Man was born in a fallen
[42:01] image.
[42:03] So Adam then lost his godship.
[42:07] Adam lost his position.
[42:09] Adam lost his place.
[42:13] But the scripture of Job Joel, sorry,
[42:16] 2:25 tells us, it gives us a promise.
[42:21] Amen. Joel 2:25 gives us a promise. And
[42:26] the promise is, "And I will restore to
[42:30] you." Hallelujah.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; I will restore to you the years that the
[42:35] locust had eaten,
[42:37] &gt;&gt; the kangaroo
[42:39] and the caterpillar and the palmer, my
[42:44] great army which I sent among you.
[42:47] Hallelujah. So God has promised
[42:52] &gt;&gt; a restoration.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:56] God has promised a restoration
[43:00] from the fall in the garden of Eden.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; God have promised a restoration that you
[43:09] could be born again.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; God has promised a restoration to give
[43:15] you a new birth.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; God has Hallelujah.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; God has promised a reconciliation.
[43:23] God has promised to get back man to God.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; That is why hallelujah that in this body
[43:30] we are in Satan's Eden.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; In this body we live in Satan Eden. But
[43:35] in these souls we have shalom with God.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; In the in our soul we have peace with
[43:42] God.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Eventually what God intended in the
[43:46] Garden of Eden some of us have the
[43:49] privilege of enjoying it today.
[43:52] Amen.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Now the message shalom is an incident.
[43:56] Man has been restored. We still live in
[43:59] state and Eden in these bodies. But the
[44:02] inside of the inside is a part of God
[44:05] &gt;&gt; is a part of God's word.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; That's why the message tell you greater
[44:10] is he that is in you
[44:12] &gt;&gt; than in this world.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; This is the world.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; This is not a believer.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; This flesh of ours is beast.
[44:21] That's right.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; I said the flesh of ours is animal.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; That is why we behave like animals
[44:26] sometime.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; This flesh is not God.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; This bless this flesh came the perverted
[44:32] way.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; It came the wrong way.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Who could make a clean thing out of an
[44:38] unclean thing?
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. But thanks be to God, there's a
[44:42] greater is he.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; There's a greater is he that is in in
[44:47] you. Hallelujah. So I want to tell you
[44:50] something tonight by the grace of God.
[44:52] There is a people right now have the
[44:54] ability to subdue this piece of earth.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; This piece of earth. Sometime you know
[45:00] people want to control the world but
[45:02] start by controlling yourself.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Start by getting yourself under control.
[45:08] Start by telling this body what where it
[45:11] could go.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; What it could say.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; How about subduing? You know people want
[45:17] to subdue the storm. You want to subdue
[45:22] &gt;&gt; but you can't subdue the hurricane in
[45:24] your own life.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; In our lives we have hurricane
[45:28] &gt;&gt; in our life. We have storms in our life.
[45:32] This flesh running a mock will make us
[45:35] do what it want to do. But thanks be to
[45:37] God there's a greater is he that is
[45:39] within you
[45:41] &gt;&gt; and a greater than he that is in the
[45:44] world. Amen.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; So, thank be to God, we have a promise
[45:50] tonight. A promise of a restoration.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. The message foundation,
[45:59] fundamental foundation for faith. Amen.
[46:03] E10. Quote number three, God's prophet
[46:06] tells us here, "And Adam never had to be
[46:10] sick.
[46:13] He never had to die.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; He never had a worry.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; He never had a heartache.
[46:24] He never had fear.
[46:27] He just climbed up in the arms of the
[46:30] father and just like a child, everything
[46:34] was his
[46:35] &gt;&gt; and whatever he asked for why he got it.
[46:40] Amen.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Everything obeyed him because he was
[46:45] God's child and a child is the heir of
[46:49] all things.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; But church, when man fell, he lost this.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; When man fell, he lost this. Hallelujah.
[47:02] Amen. But but what he lost in the fall,
[47:07] Christ come as a redeemer.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; What he lost.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; What he lost in the fall, Christ come as
[47:20] a redeemer.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Did you ever stop to think what Christ
[47:24] redeem us for? He give us everlasting
[47:28] life.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. He brought us back to eternal
[47:32] fellowship and relationship with God
[47:36] &gt;&gt; to be sons and daughters of God again.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; He to restore us back all that Adam lost
[47:44] in the fall.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; He has restored us.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Come on church. We only waited for this
[47:51] bodies to change
[47:53] &gt;&gt; but deep inside of us we are restored.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; He walks with me. He talks with me.
[47:59] Hallelujah. We have fellowship with him.
[48:03] We have a relationship with him.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[48:09] Hallelujah. We have a relationship with
[48:12] God. Amen. We have fellowship with God.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; We and God are not enemies.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; I say we are not enemies.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; We have shalom. Amen.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; We have peace.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; We still live in this body of flesh.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. In this body, this body that will
[48:36] war have a battle with us. This body
[48:39] going to fight you till you go to the
[48:40] grave. So don't think the fight finish.
[48:45] You have instant coffee, instant
[48:46] porridge, but you don't have instant
[48:49] deliverance.
[48:52] You know, you living a super data.
[48:54] Everything is instant.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; You get everything fast. Everything you
[48:58] want. Fast food fast everything. But you
[49:00] don't get fast deliverance.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; You have to die daily.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Not monthly. No, not every Sunday when
[49:10] you come to church. I the apostle Paul
[49:13] say for I to live I have to die daily.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Daily I have a battle because I know
[49:22] something. And I you know sometime in in
[49:24] fellowships and we have a tendency to
[49:26] look to somebody to be the enemy but
[49:28] your greatest enemy is you. Watch the
[49:29] mirror.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; I say your greatest enemy is you.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Your greatest hindrance is you.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Our greatest enemy is ourselves.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; That sound strange to some of you.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; No. You you want to look at somebody
[49:47] else as your enemy. Is you who standing
[49:49] in the way of God. is you give yourself
[49:52] and God a lot of trouble because you're
[49:55] not willing to surrender. You're not
[49:58] willing to heal yourself.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Blessed be his holy name
[50:04] tonight. Amen. So, Christ come to
[50:09] restore.
[50:11] Christ didn't come to open a church. He
[50:14] didn't come to open some religion. He
[50:16] didn't come to start some church. He
[50:19] came to restore. Amen.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Restore to us all that Adam lost.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; All that Adam lost. You remember the
[50:32] first message our Lord preached? He said
[50:35] he must be born again. His first
[50:38] doctrine, you must be born again.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; All that Adam lost through the new
[50:46] birth, we are restored back to God. Yes.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are restored back to God.
[50:55] Come on, church. Think about it.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Adam
[51:00] fell in God's Eden, but we having a
[51:04] victory in Satan's Eden.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Come on. Are you having that victory?
[51:12] &gt;&gt; We are having a victory in Satan's Eden.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We overcoming. We are victorious.
[51:21] This is the devil's world.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the devil's world. But we
[51:27] have the ability to move contrary to the
[51:30] world.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What happened to the first
[51:35] Eve will never happen to this Eve.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; What happened to that Eve will not
[51:43] happen to this woman. Amen.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; This is a special people.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; This is a special people.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; This is his bride.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So
[51:57] through the new birth, thanks be to God,
[52:01] we have the opportunity to be restored
[52:05] back to God.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Our first birth, right? Because of Adam,
[52:13] because of what took place in the Garden
[52:14] of Eden, our first birth, Amen, produced
[52:18] sin,
[52:20] our first birth produced sickness.
[52:25] Our first birth produce fear,
[52:28] but our second birth correct the error.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Correct the error. So who
[52:36] you are, you are a new creation.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. You are a new creation
[52:47] in the same body.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; I say in the same body.
[52:53] That's why God's propheted the William
[52:54] Brandham that used to live here don't
[52:56] live here no longer.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Is someone else living here?
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. A new creation. And what the word
[53:02] of God tells us in 2 Corinthians 5:17,
[53:07] "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he
[53:12] is a new creature,
[53:15] old things are passed away, and behold,
[53:20] all things have become new."
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:26] The second birth, Amen. correct
[53:31] the error.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; You are a new creature.
[53:36] Old things have passed away. So it is
[53:40] your second birth that produced this
[53:45] evening the new race.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; It is your second birth this evening
[53:51] that produce the superior race.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is your second birth that
[53:58] have you born in the image and the
[54:02] likeness of almighty God.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we praise God. Amen. We
[54:09] thank God for a natural birth because it
[54:12] takes a natural birth to bring us to the
[54:15] new birth. But we but a natural birth is
[54:18] a birth of sin, is a birth of sickness,
[54:22] is a birth of death. But thanks be to
[54:25] God for a new birth.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Naturally,
[54:30] you are born a loser.
[54:33] Naturally, you are born defeated.
[54:38] Naturally. Hallelujah. We are born
[54:41] defeated. No matter where you born, how
[54:44] you born, you may feel I had everything.
[54:46] But you are born a loser.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. The wages of sin is death.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. The gift of God is eternal life.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; We are born defeated.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; We are born losers. But thanks be to God
[55:03] for a new birth.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God for a new birth.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; All things are passed away.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; All things are passed away. Oh, glory to
[55:18] God. that you will realize by God's
[55:21] grace who you are. You are the beginning
[55:25] of the creation of God. You are the
[55:29] beginning of the new creation.
[55:32] So Adam was the beginning of the
[55:35] creation of God. But now through Christ,
[55:39] you are part of that new creation.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Now through Christ, Amen. Christ is the
[55:46] beginning. But uh Revelation 3:14 tells
[55:50] us, "Unto the angels of the church of
[55:53] loud decision and right, these things
[55:56] said the amen, the faithful and true
[55:59] witness, the beginning of the creation
[56:02] of God." Amen. So Adam was the beginning
[56:06] of that creation, but now Christ is the
[56:10] beginning of our new creation. Through
[56:13] Christ, we are part today of a new race.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:20] Christ is the first of this new race.
[56:25] Christ is the beginning of this new
[56:28] creation. Christ is the last Adam.
[56:34] Amen. Christ is the last Adam.
[56:37] Hallelujah. Christ is the last Adam.
[56:41] Amen. So we are not born into a race of
[56:45] failures.
[56:46] With the new birth, we are not born in a
[56:49] race of defeated people.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; No, with the new birth, we are born into
[56:55] a super race.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; With the new birth, you are born in a
[57:01] race of overcomers.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Come on, remember the scripture said
[57:06] every seed after its time.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we are of a different
[57:13] kind.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; We are of Christ kind.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So thank God for the new
[57:20] birth.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; We bless God for the new birth. Amen.
[57:24] Because without a new birth, you could
[57:27] never be a part of the new creation.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; But we can say thanks be to God.
[57:34] Everything that Adam lost, you become.
[57:41] I said everything that Adam lost you
[57:45] become.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:48] Amen.
[57:49] We were born. Amen. We were born in this
[57:54] new birth. We born with his nature.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; That nature breathes out all
[58:05] imperfection. Thank you Lord.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; In simple language, you were taught, you
[58:11] know, when a child is to be born into
[58:13] this world,
[58:15] the great God
[58:18] know what diseases
[58:21] this child is going to confront.
[58:25] The great God in his great plan, natural
[58:29] plan knows exactly what condition will
[58:34] be in the world at that time.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; And that child is born with an immunity.
[58:42] Before you take her to the clinic to get
[58:44] tablet vaccine and install some vaccine,
[58:48] that child is born with something
[58:52] &gt;&gt; and they don't get it from the tin of
[58:53] milk.
[58:56] I don't know where is it. Where's the
[58:57] brand they use today? In my days was
[59:00] Clayman.
[59:02] No, it don't come from a thinner milk.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; It come from the mother's breast.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; That child is fed. Amen. And in in in in
[59:12] that feeding, that child has an immunity
[59:17] &gt;&gt; to withstand
[59:19] what is there in the earth for that
[59:21] time. But the truth be told, the truth
[59:25] be told, you could have natural
[59:28] imperfection.
[59:30] You could have a child born with some
[59:32] kind of fault. But thanks be to God,
[59:35] there will never be an error with your
[59:37] new birth.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So God, when you your new
[59:43] birth, you are birthed to face with
[59:46] whatsoever
[59:48] &gt;&gt; challenge that is here to confront you.
[59:52] You're born with that in your genes.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; It is a part of your spiritual genes
[59:58] that you are born to withstand. That's
[1:00:00] why you could believe no devil could put
[1:00:03] something too hard on you. You have what
[1:00:05] it takes
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; to be an overcomer.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; So brothers, sister, we are born into a
[1:00:14] new race. We are born into a race of
[1:00:19] overcomers.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are born tonight into a new
[1:00:25] race. Remember every seed after its
[1:00:30] kind. Every seed after its order, we
[1:00:35] thank God. What order we have been born
[1:00:38] with. So church, everything that Adam
[1:00:42] lost
[1:00:44] by the grace of God, we now become. We
[1:00:49] have what it takes to breathe out every
[1:00:53] imperfection.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; What was released unto us? Not the life
[1:00:57] of Christ.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; The life of Christ is. Do you not
[1:01:01] recognize? Amen. What Christianity is
[1:01:04] really is? Christianity is not I living.
[1:01:06] Is Christ living his life in me?
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; I say it again.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; We could never try to be a Christian.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; We could never be Christians on our own.
[1:01:20] It is Christ living his life in me.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Is not I living,
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; it's I giving up.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Is I surrendering
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; and Christ living his blessed life in
[1:01:37] us.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; So we are part
[1:01:43] of the new creation.
[1:01:45] Jesus was the first. Hallelujah. He was
[1:01:50] the beginning of the new creation. Jesus
[1:01:54] was the beginning of the new order.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; So when we see in the scriptures Jesus
[1:02:02] walking on water, he was showing us what
[1:02:06] Adam lost.
[1:02:09] Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:11] Jesus show us what Adam was supposed to
[1:02:15] be.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus showing us exactly what Adam lost.
[1:02:22] So we heard what Adam was, but we never
[1:02:26] see Adam in action. But in Jesus Christ,
[1:02:31] we see what Adam lost. Amen.
[1:02:36] And think about it this evening. If you
[1:02:38] don't re re recognize nothing else,
[1:02:41] recognize with our new birth, everything
[1:02:46] that was in Jesus is in you.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Say it again.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Everything
[1:02:56] that was in Jesus
[1:02:59] is in you.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:05] Every ability of God is within you.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Lord help us.
[1:03:14] We have every ability of God within us.
[1:03:21] But we need to do something. We need
[1:03:24] tonight to recognize that.
[1:03:29] We need to recognize
[1:03:33] that what was in Jesus is now in you.
[1:03:40] Amen. The fall Amen. The fall caused man
[1:03:45] to lose his true identity.
[1:03:49] The fall caused man to lose who he
[1:03:53] really was. Amen. Like the eagle. Amen.
[1:03:57] The power and ability of the eagle was
[1:04:01] always in the eagle.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; But the eagle was in a bar.
[1:04:07] The eagle had to come to a recognition.
[1:04:12] Something had to give the eagle an
[1:04:15] awakening.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; I am saying by grace of God, the power
[1:04:22] of God is within you. Amen.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; The ability of God is within you.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Everything that was in Jesus Christ is
[1:04:35] in you.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; But what we need to do is to come to our
[1:04:43] recognition.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:04:48] Take back go back to that quotation.
[1:04:52] Amen.
[1:04:54] Foundation
[1:04:56] quote number four. Man
[1:04:59] was made. Amen.
[1:05:03] Man, fundamental foundation of faith.
[1:05:07] E9. Man was made as a secondary God on
[1:05:14] earth. That was how man was made.
[1:05:19] Man was made a secondary God on earth.
[1:05:23] He was given power to control all
[1:05:27] things,
[1:05:28] all the elements of the earth. That was
[1:05:32] Adam.
[1:05:34] Adam was given these great powers.
[1:05:39] But then the power that he was given to
[1:05:41] make himself is where he fell.
[1:05:46] Adam could speak to the winds and it
[1:05:50] would stop. He could speak to the trees,
[1:05:53] they would obey him. He could speak to
[1:05:56] wildlife, it would obey him. He could
[1:05:59] speak to the waters, ever what it was.
[1:06:02] Everything
[1:06:04] obeyed Adam.
[1:06:08] Now, that's the beginning of man.
[1:06:12] That's what God gave him power over
[1:06:16] everything on the earth
[1:06:19] through the fall. He lost that power.
[1:06:24] Then he became unconscious of the fact
[1:06:28] after losing his relationship
[1:06:31] and friendship and fellowship with the
[1:06:34] father.
[1:06:36] Then he lost that and all the great
[1:06:39] channels become clogged up and he could
[1:06:43] not get through.
[1:06:45] So he's showing us where the fall
[1:06:49] carried man. But now
[1:06:53] what Adam was in God, Christ has redeem
[1:06:57] us back to that.
[1:06:59] [Music]
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; That is why I think our message
[1:07:02] fellowship by redemption. God's prophet
[1:07:05] tells us what God intended in the Garden
[1:07:08] of Eden, Amen, is happening right now.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; What God intended, the great plan of
[1:07:16] Almighty God
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; is true. Amen. When we leave, a body
[1:07:20] change will take us to even the
[1:07:22] redemption of our natural body.
[1:07:25] But the real you and the real me, what
[1:07:28] God planned in the Garden of Eden, there
[1:07:31] are people today have in that
[1:07:34] relationship right now.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; That is what we that is what your
[1:07:40] ministering is all about.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; That is where the word has taken us back
[1:07:46] to that place by the grace of the Lord.
[1:07:49] Now what Adam was in God, Christ has
[1:07:54] redeemed us back to that.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A redeemer is to redeem
[1:08:01] anything to bring it back to its origin
[1:08:05] again.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Super rest.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Super rest. Through our Lord Jesus
[1:08:15] Christ, we have been brought back to
[1:08:20] origin again.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:26] Hallelujah.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like the eagle. Amen. The power of
[1:08:32] the eagle was always there.
[1:08:36] The eagle was always an eagle.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Paul in a baniard didn't change him. He
[1:08:43] was always an eagle. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:08:47] Living under whatever little he could
[1:08:49] live under. He was still an eagle. But
[1:08:52] brother, he did not. He lost his
[1:08:55] identity. The eagle did not even know he
[1:08:58] could have fly. The eagle did not even
[1:09:01] know he have these wings and that wings
[1:09:04] have a purpose because he was growing up
[1:09:06] in a wrong environment. But one day by
[1:09:09] the grace of the Lord, hallelujah, the
[1:09:12] eagle get an awakening.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The eagle come to a
[1:09:18] recognition of who he is.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He heard a voice.
[1:09:25] Hallelujah. And it brought an eagle to a
[1:09:29] recognition.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; I thank God we have been wakened.
[1:09:35] I tell about you had he quickened.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; You
[1:09:41] had he quickened who were once dead in
[1:09:44] sins and trespasses.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; You had an awakening.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; If you did not have awakening, you'd
[1:09:52] have still be dead.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; I said if you did not have awakening,
[1:09:57] you'd have still be dead. But you heard
[1:10:00] the word
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; and he he quickened you.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; He made you that was dead, he made you
[1:10:09] alive.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have he quickened.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; I thank God for awakening.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; I thank God for a quickening by God's
[1:10:22] grace. Amen.
[1:10:26] Is that brother Fred voice?
[1:10:28] Somebody sound like brother Fred. All
[1:10:30] right. I expected him here. Or is this
[1:10:32] brother here? Maybe. See when voices
[1:10:35] sound. So when God placed Adam on the
[1:10:38] earth,
[1:10:40] Amen. Adam did not have to do anything
[1:10:45] to get authority.
[1:10:48] Adam did not have to do anything
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; to get power.
[1:10:54] No, he didn't have to do nothing. Power
[1:10:58] and authority
[1:10:59] was in Adam by creation.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; He did not had to walk up anything.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; He did not have to beat up himself.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; You know, as some of us try to do,
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; he didn't have to do nothing to get
[1:11:15] authority.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; He born with authority.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; He was born with power. Amen.
[1:11:23] Hallelujah. Do you believe?
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Do you believe?
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; And one of you believe you too when you
[1:11:32] are born again, everything we have need
[1:11:35] of is in us.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; You You tell me you believe Adam had
[1:11:40] power and authority. But do you believe
[1:11:44] everything
[1:11:45] you have need of us of sorry is in us.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; So maybe what we need to do church
[1:11:58] amen is to check and see where we are
[1:12:02] lacking.
[1:12:04] If we are lacking on recognizing what
[1:12:08] God has done for us,
[1:12:14] remember the eagle in the barard lack
[1:12:19] recognition.
[1:12:21] He was out there. He lacked the
[1:12:24] recognition that he was an eagle.
[1:12:29] We see, Amen. When God placed Adam on
[1:12:33] the earth, Adam did not have to do
[1:12:37] anything to get authority and power. We
[1:12:41] know is when sin came in mit
[1:12:46] is poor. But Adam power and authority
[1:12:50] was in Adam by creation.
[1:12:54] But I'm suggesting to us by God's grace,
[1:12:57] we the born again need to come to a
[1:13:00] recognition that what we have need of is
[1:13:06] in us.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; You remember the prophet said healing is
[1:13:10] in you.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; The rapture is in you.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; It coming from nowhere. Hh they coming
[1:13:17] from nowhere else.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Do not recognize naturally. Naturally
[1:13:21] you look at an orange tree. Every orange
[1:13:24] is in the tree.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Every orange is the seed.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; It just has to come to a maturity.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; It has to have a certain amount that
[1:13:33] caring. But no, but you don't go and
[1:13:35] stick orange in the tree. No, the orange
[1:13:38] is in the tree.
[1:13:41] So what we have need of is in us.
[1:13:45] Hallelujah. Now think about Adam
[1:13:49] in the garden of Eden. Adam, amen, did
[1:13:54] not have to eat anything
[1:13:58] to become what God was.
[1:14:03] He didn't have to eat anything. He was
[1:14:06] what God is.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. But remember, Satan came to Eve.
[1:14:13] And when Satan came to Eve, what Satan
[1:14:16] told her? If you want to be like God,
[1:14:21] eat this.
[1:14:23] If you want to be like God. So she did
[1:14:26] not even know who she was.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; She had no recognition what she was
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; and what the devil was doing her was
[1:14:36] questioning her ability.
[1:14:39] The devil was questioning what is
[1:14:43] already in her. Remember
[1:14:47] before the fall they were already like
[1:14:51] God.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what the devil was doing is
[1:14:57] attacking her position.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; And that's the work of the enemy to
[1:15:03] attack what Christ has done for you.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; We got to stand up and war against the
[1:15:10] enemy.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; The work of the enemy is to attack Yes.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Attack what Christ had already done.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; It is a finished work.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; It is already done.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; God has already done it.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; God don't half deliver anybody. God do
[1:15:32] complete deliverance.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. God completely deliver. It is a
[1:15:40] finished work.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is the high priest of
[1:15:46] your confession.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; You have to confess what he has done for
[1:15:52] you.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; So the devil attack today is to cause
[1:15:57] you to doubt the word.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; The devil's attack today is to cause us
[1:16:04] to doubt our position.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; The devil don't want you to know who you
[1:16:10] are,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; right? You know, you you you you you
[1:16:13] don't find it strange and great that
[1:16:17] God's prophet over 40 times make
[1:16:20] reference to the African slave.
[1:16:25] He make reference to that boy. Is was he
[1:16:28] short of illustration? Or doesn't that
[1:16:31] illustration mean something specific?
[1:16:34] That African boy, he was a slave living
[1:16:39] in slavish condition. But he know who he
[1:16:43] was.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; He know he even know he dream he could
[1:16:46] ever get back to Africa. But he is the
[1:16:49] child of a king.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; He is the son of a king.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; And because he know who he happened to
[1:16:57] be, no condition pressing them.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Nobody could depress him.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Nobody. He getting licks like everybody.
[1:17:08] He eating his slave slave food like
[1:17:10] everybody but he operate like a son of a
[1:17:14] king.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; I am the child of a king.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; And that is what the devil is fighting
[1:17:25] us about. The devil don't want you to
[1:17:29] recognize your position.
[1:17:33] Super race. A new race of people. He He
[1:17:37] wants you to see yourself in a different
[1:17:39] way.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil don't want you to come
[1:17:44] to that place. Amen. And amen. To know
[1:17:47] who you are. Amen. Not who he was. God's
[1:17:51] prophet was a child of Charles and
[1:17:54] there. But he's now a son of God,
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; a daughter of God. You got to know your
[1:18:02] position.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:06] Do you believe according to the word of
[1:18:08] God that you are co-equal with Christ?
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Do you believe? Amen. That you can
[1:18:19] recognize through the word of God you
[1:18:21] are co-equal with Christ.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the devil fears. The devil is
[1:18:27] afraid of you. You know
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; he is afraid.
[1:18:33] You don't realize how the devil afraid
[1:18:35] of you.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; The devil don't want you to know your
[1:18:39] position.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; He don't want know you to know who you
[1:18:44] are. He don't want you to recognize your
[1:18:48] day. He don't want you to recognize your
[1:18:50] position. Hallelujah. Let's hear how
[1:18:54] God's prophet express it in the
[1:18:56] revelation of Jesus Christ. Church age
[1:18:58] book page 15 paragraph 3.
[1:19:02] Now remember
[1:19:07] 153.
[1:19:09] Now remember
[1:19:11] quote number five.
[1:19:13] This
[1:19:15] Christ in the true church is a
[1:19:20] continuation
[1:19:21] of the book of acts. Amen.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; But the book of Revelation
[1:19:28] shows how the antichrist spirit would
[1:19:31] come into the church and defile it,
[1:19:36] make it lukewarm,
[1:19:39] formal
[1:19:41] and powerless.
[1:19:44] But it exposes Satan
[1:19:47] revealing his work attempted destruction
[1:19:51] of God's people and the discrediting
[1:19:54] discrediting of God's word right down to
[1:19:56] the time he's cast in the lake of fire.
[1:20:00] He fights that. That's the devil. He
[1:20:03] cannot stand it. He knows if the people
[1:20:08] get the true revelation of the true
[1:20:11] church and what she is. Hallelujah. And
[1:20:15] what she stand for. She can do the
[1:20:18] greater works.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; She will be an invincible army.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; That is what you are called for.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; We are not called to be a group of
[1:20:31] cowards. We are not called to be a group
[1:20:34] just surrendering ourselves. No, the
[1:20:38] devil don't want you to know who you
[1:20:42] are.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He cannot stand
[1:20:47] that. He knows if the people get the
[1:20:51] true revelation. That is why we are told
[1:20:54] in the word of God, pray for revelation.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Pray for revelation.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Pray that God open up his word
[1:21:05] to you.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Pray because power is in revelation.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; If they get a true revelation
[1:21:17] of the two spirits within the framework
[1:21:20] of the church and by God's spirit
[1:21:23] discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:21:26] spirit. Amen. Satan will
[1:21:32] powerless before her.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; That's our promise to the new race.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; That's the promise to the super race.
[1:21:45] Hallelujah. Satan will be powerless
[1:21:51] before her. He will be definitely
[1:21:54] thwarted today as when Christ withtood
[1:21:58] every effort to gain power over him in
[1:22:01] the desert. Amen. Remember the
[1:22:04] temptation of the Lord and what the Lord
[1:22:06] used? He used the word.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; He used the word.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatsoever the devil come with, he
[1:22:14] fight the devil with the word. The devil
[1:22:17] cannot take the word.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As one would say, amen. If
[1:22:23] Eve in the beginning there would have
[1:22:26] would would have tell the devil, wait a
[1:22:28] minute, let me go and call my pastor.
[1:22:31] Pastor Adam, the devil had gone. But the
[1:22:35] devil know how to operate. Amen. We have
[1:22:38] to know how to operate. Amen. To
[1:22:43] withtood every effort to gain power over
[1:22:46] him. Yes. Satan hates revelation.
[1:22:50] But we love it.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; We love it.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Pray for revelation.
[1:22:57] Ask God for revelation.
[1:23:00] We love revelation with the true
[1:23:04] revelation in our lives. The gates of
[1:23:07] hell
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; cannot prevail against us.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; We will prevail.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; We will prevail.
[1:23:19] Oh,
[1:23:21] glory.
[1:23:23] Hallelujah.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; So, it takes us this evening
[1:23:29] to recognize
[1:23:32] who we are. And if we would recognize
[1:23:36] who we are this evening, we will be an
[1:23:42] invincible
[1:23:44] army.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:47] If we would recognize
[1:23:50] who we are, we would be an invincible
[1:23:56] army. Do you want to be a part of that
[1:23:59] army?
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Are you in the church triumphant?
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Are you in the Savior's bride?
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Come and be baptized into the body.
[1:24:07] Amen. God calls you to be a superior
[1:24:13] race.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we wind down by the grace of
[1:24:18] God, Christ is the mystery of God.
[1:24:21] Paragraph 240.
[1:24:24] The new birth is Christ
[1:24:29] is a revelation.
[1:24:31] God has revealed to you this great
[1:24:36] mystery.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; You see, sometimes we go ahead
[1:24:41] believing.
[1:24:42] Amen. We go ahead believing that
[1:24:45] revelation is a church revelation, you
[1:24:47] know. No, this is an individual thing.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; God revealing to you.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Revealing to you the individual.
[1:24:58] Christ has revealed to you. It's not a
[1:25:00] collective revelation, you know. No. The
[1:25:03] great mystery and new of the new birth.
[1:25:06] Now what are you going to do when you
[1:25:09] get all that group together where the
[1:25:11] revelation is perfectly in harmony and
[1:25:15] God expressing himself through his word
[1:25:17] by the same action same things that he
[1:25:20] did making the word manifest. Oh if the
[1:25:25] church only knew its position.
[1:25:31] Oh, if the church
[1:25:35] only knew its position
[1:25:39] and thanks be to God, it will one day.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:50] If the church only knew its position
[1:25:56] and thanks be to God,
[1:26:00] it will one day then the rapture will go
[1:26:05] when it when she know what it is.
[1:26:11] About to close. Take a last quotation
[1:26:14] from perfect faith.
[1:26:17] Hallelujah.
[1:26:19] So from the scripture we will see our
[1:26:23] Lord Jesus
[1:26:25] knowing who he was.
[1:26:28] He overcame
[1:26:30] every demon.
[1:26:33] Amen. The Satan come to misquote the
[1:26:36] scripture for the Lord. Amen. Thou shalt
[1:26:39] throw yourself down and thou shalt do
[1:26:42] this. The Lord defeated the enemy on the
[1:26:46] word of God.
[1:26:48] man shall live by the word of God. That
[1:26:53] why he could have answered the devil and
[1:26:55] tell the devil with all your preaching
[1:26:57] get thee hence Satan
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; because anything contrary to the word is
[1:27:02] the devil. Jesus knowing who he was
[1:27:07] overcame every demon. Amen. And that is
[1:27:12] what the enemy used with Eve. get her to
[1:27:17] question who she is. God's prophet in a
[1:27:21] quotation said, "Amen, the bride asks no
[1:27:24] questions."
[1:27:26] Amen. We don't question the word.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; We believe the word.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; We don't question the word. We don't
[1:27:33] question what go be it unto me.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; What Mary said, be it unto me according
[1:27:38] to thy word.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If the word said cast it,
[1:27:43] then cast it. If the whatsoever the word
[1:27:46] said, be it unto me according to your
[1:27:49] word.
[1:27:52] The message perfect faith.
[1:27:55] Maybe you all stand.
[1:27:58] Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Now remember
[1:28:06] they had the word
[1:28:10] and the word was flesh. Then
[1:28:14] the word tell them I give you power.
[1:28:19] They had the power.
[1:28:24] Amen. They had the power,
[1:28:29] but they did not have faith to operate
[1:28:33] that word that was in them. See what I
[1:28:36] mean? Jesus had it. He was the word and
[1:28:40] he had faith that what he said would
[1:28:44] happen.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, bring him here." Paragraph
[1:28:49] 64. He had faith with his power
[1:28:54] and he said I can do nothing in myself.
[1:28:57] He relied on what he was.
[1:29:01] He relied on knowing who he was.
[1:29:08] He had faith
[1:29:11] in God who made him the word.
[1:29:16] know that he was because the scripture
[1:29:20] said he was this and every scripture
[1:29:24] tied to prove he was exactly what the
[1:29:28] scripture said he would be. He knew
[1:29:33] hallelujah what he was. Do you know who
[1:29:37] you are?
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; We need to examine ourselves.
[1:29:42] Do we know what Christ has wrought for
[1:29:45] us?
[1:29:46] Are we able? Amen. Should we be? You
[1:29:50] know, there was a illustration God's
[1:29:52] prophet made. This lady from India, she
[1:29:56] she had a lot of checks in her Bible,
[1:29:59] but yet she was impoverished.
[1:30:01] She didn't have no food to eat, but she
[1:30:04] didn't even know there were checks. She
[1:30:07] had them in in the word of God. She had
[1:30:09] it there. She didn't even know what it
[1:30:11] was. And she lived an impoverished life.
[1:30:15] We are called by God's grace to
[1:30:18] recognize who you are. Recognize not
[1:30:23] what you have done. Recognize what God
[1:30:25] has wrought in your life.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Recognize what God has made you to be.
[1:30:32] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Father
[1:30:34] God, we thank you for a glorious
[1:30:36] opportunity to be a part of your plan,
[1:30:40] to be a part of your program, Lord God,
[1:30:43] to be with the saints at this time. We
[1:30:46] certainly thank you for lives, Lord. We
[1:30:49] have seen even amongst us, Lord God,
[1:30:52] have been in your word, serving you and
[1:30:55] being faithful to you. We pray your
[1:30:58] continued blessing upon them. Continued
[1:31:00] blessing upon this church. The pastor
[1:31:03] Lord God as even my said and early
[1:31:07] father Lord God what you have wrought
[1:31:09] even amongst them here is a great
[1:31:12] example for many parts of the world. We
[1:31:14] pray your continued blessings be upon us
[1:31:17] as we love you and we appreciate you in
[1:31:20] Jesus precious name. Amen.
[1:31:24] God bless you, brother D.
[1:31:28] God. Amen.
[1:31:30] Thank you, my brother. God bless you,
[1:31:33] brother Green. Amen. Glory to God. Here,
[1:31:38] Brother Green, these are yours.
[1:31:42] Praise God. How many enjoyed that this
[1:31:44] evening? Amen. What was the Lord telling
[1:31:48] us? You know, when Adam was created in
[1:31:51] the image of God, we were in Adam. We've
[1:31:55] heard that we we were in Adam. When he
[1:31:58] fell, we all fell. Amen. And that's why
[1:32:02] the whole human race fell. But Jesus
[1:32:05] Christ, when he came, he came to give us
[1:32:08] his life and to bring us back, to redeem
[1:32:11] us back. And what was lost in the Garden
[1:32:14] of Eden was the book of inheritance, the
[1:32:16] book of life. He forfeited the book. But
[1:32:19] here in 1963, what does God do? He sends
[1:32:22] us a prophet. And and what does that
[1:32:25] prophet do? Identify Jesus Christ in the
[1:32:28] opening of the word. And here he comes.
[1:32:30] The mighty angel comes down. Christ
[1:32:33] himself. And now he's got the book back
[1:32:35] in his hand. Amen. Glory to God. And
[1:32:38] that's what that's what he's doing here
[1:32:40] tonight. That's what he was doing here
[1:32:42] tonight. He came in 63 with the open
[1:32:44] book, but he knew that there'd be some
[1:32:46] in 2025 that would need to hear their
[1:32:49] name. Amen. Because that's what the book
[1:32:52] of inheritance is. It's calling the
[1:32:54] names of the sons and the daughters of
[1:32:57] the living God. Amen. Did you hear your
[1:32:59] name tonight? Glory to God. If you can
[1:33:02] identify with the super race, it's
[1:33:04] because you've heard your name. Oh,
[1:33:08] she's a glorious church without spot or
[1:33:11] wrinkle.
[1:33:12] She's a glorious
[1:33:15] church
[1:33:20] washed in the blood of the lamb.
[1:33:25] Oh, it's a glorious
[1:33:28] church without spot wrinking gold washed
[1:33:34] in the blood of the lamb. Oh yes, she's
[1:33:39] a glorious
[1:33:41] church.
[1:33:45] Oh, wash in the blood of the lamb.
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:33:52] She's a glorious
[1:33:55] [Music]
[1:33:59] wash in the blood.
[1:34:02] [Music]
[1:34:04] Oh, are you in the church
[1:34:08] triumph?
[1:34:11] Are you in the Savior's
[1:34:16] [Music]
[1:34:19] baptiz into the body
[1:34:23] and forever
[1:34:26] more?
[1:34:29] Oh, have you been baptized into the
[1:34:33] body?
[1:34:36] Baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:42] There is but one way to enter today
[1:34:48] just as they did on.
[1:34:54] Oh, are you in the church triumpher?
[1:35:01] Are you in the Savior's
[1:35:05] Christ?
[1:35:07] Come and be baptized
[1:35:11] by thee
[1:35:14] and forever.
[1:35:16] [Music]
[1:35:19] I'm a new creation.
[1:35:23] I'm a brand new man.
[1:35:26] All things are passed away. I'm born
[1:35:30] again.
[1:35:33] Born and a coner.
[1:35:36] That's who I am.
[1:35:39] I'm a new creation.
[1:35:42] I'm a brand. Hallelujah.
[1:35:46] Oh, hallelujah.
