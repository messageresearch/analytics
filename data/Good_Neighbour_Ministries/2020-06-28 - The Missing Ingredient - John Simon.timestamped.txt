[0:03] [Music]
[0:16] good morning friends it's good to be in
[0:21] the house of God and on another
[0:25] beautiful Sunday morning giving praise
[0:30] honor and worship to his glorious and
[0:35] marvelous name today I would like to
[0:41] speak on the subject the missing
[0:44] ingredient now some years ago I read in
[0:50] a book where this woman made a beautiful
[0:56] cake a lovely cake for her husband mixed
[1:01] it lovingly and prepared it baked it and
[1:05] then brought that cake after hit a
[1:09] cooled to her husband giving him a
[1:14] healthy slice of that cake and so he sat
[1:20] down to enjoy that cake but with his
[1:25] first bite and began to chew it his face
[1:32] changed color and as sensitive as she
[1:37] was she said what's wrong honey what's
[1:40] wrong is something wrong
[1:41] he said well it it's a beautiful cake
[1:45] it's it's just lovely
[1:48] no faulting that that is just great but
[1:52] the taste there there's something
[1:55] missing there's something missing from
[1:58] it it's you know a cake is supposed to
[2:01] have to be sweetened this has no taste
[2:04] whatsoever she said oh my god
[2:08] I forgot to put in
[2:11] sugar oh my
[2:14] and so the sugar was that missing
[2:17] ingredient I would like to speak about
[2:22] that today
[2:23] let us pray and read from the book of
[2:28] Judges our gracious God and Heavenly
[2:34] Father we ask for help from heaven may
[2:39] the great holy spirit empower us to
[2:43] speak your word Lord anoint your word to
[2:48] you to the hearts and minds of the
[2:51] people that you and persons you have
[2:54] prepared to hear and to receive this
[2:58] send forth thy light on thy truth in
[3:02] this hour in the midst of the darkness
[3:05] Lord and lighten and brighten every
[3:10] corner of every heart in the name of
[3:13] Jesus Christ our Lord who may love and
[3:17] serve amen and amen blessed be his holy
[3:23] name now I want to show the importance
[3:31] of having this person of the Blessed
[3:35] Holy Spirit in our lives in our homes
[3:39] and in our churches and also in and
[3:46] across our nation praise be to God
[3:51] hallelujah now we know my friends that
[3:55] the story of Samson is found in the book
[4:01] of Judges chapters 13 to 16 there you'll
[4:07] find the story of Samson now in Samson
[4:13] we see a tape a picture are a
[4:19] representation of Israel a backslidden
[4:25] he is also a type for us sad picture of
[4:31] our backslidden
[4:33] modern church world and also a picture
[4:37] of a backslidden believer that has
[4:42] wandered off from the Word of God Samson
[4:47] was born in or around 1004 DC he was the
[4:56] son of Manoa a denied and his wife they
[5:02] hadn't in the visitation and also
[5:06] instruction from the angel of God who
[5:11] had appeared to them and instructed them
[5:14] about Samson's birth his growth and
[5:19] instructions of his eating habits and
[5:23] social habits all about his upbringing
[5:28] he was to be a Nazarite that does that
[5:33] does not mean he has to be born in
[5:35] nazareth but the Nazarite meaning to be
[5:40] a separated one one separated holy unto
[5:45] God and under God's service now while
[5:50] Samson was young he lived and what
[5:56] obediently by the word of God's angel
[5:59] messenger for his time but as he became
[6:04] older as many people do when they are in
[6:09] the church in the message in the word as
[6:11] they become older in the years go by
[6:15] many began to wonder away from God's
[6:19] Word now here in our text which I will
[6:24] read at this particular time found in
[6:28] the book of Judges chapter 16 a belief
[6:33] it's verse 20
[6:41] verse 18 and when Delilah saw that he
[6:46] had told her all his heart
[6:48] she sent and called for the Lords of the
[6:51] Philistines saying come up this once for
[6:55] he had showed me all his heart then the
[6:58] Lords of the Philistines came unto her
[7:00] and brought money in their hand she may
[7:06] be and she made him sleep upon her knees
[7:10] and she called for a man and she caused
[7:13] him to shave off the seven lots of his
[7:17] head and she began to afflict him and
[7:20] his strength went from him and she said
[7:24] the Philistines me upon thee Samson and
[7:28] he awoke out of his sleep and said I
[7:31] will go out as at other times before and
[7:38] shake myself and he was not that the
[7:45] Lord was departed from him I'm going to
[7:49] use the last part of that text and he
[7:52] was not that the Lord had departed from
[7:58] him the missing ingredient now in this
[8:04] picture that we read we find Samson in
[8:10] the seductive arms of a harlot of Sorek
[8:14] named Delilah whose name is inscribed in
[8:20] history's Hall of Shame
[8:23] she's a type of revelation 17 Mystery
[8:29] Babylon the then the mother of harlots
[8:32] and she also my friends is a description
[8:42] of the daughters of the harlot the
[8:46] harlot
[8:48] self a symbol of this great pagan Roman
[8:54] ISM and the Protestants the daughters of
[8:59] and products of that Romanism even
[9:03] though they make themselves or call
[9:06] themselves Protestants now my friends
[9:13] four times in the scripture she enticed
[9:16] Samson and diced him to reveal the
[9:22] secret of his strength on three of these
[9:27] occasions she was absolutely
[9:31] unsuccessful but on the fourth occasion
[9:36] she became successful she succeeded and
[9:42] the scripture says chapter 16 verse 18
[9:47] and she made him sleep upon her knees
[9:53] she loved him to sleep this harlot this
[10:01] organization this Mystery Babylon this
[10:06] denominational spirit learn loathe him
[10:10] to sleep
[10:11] maybe sang and low voice lullaby and not
[10:17] to startle him but to have him just fade
[10:22] slowly going off into sleep and while he
[10:29] fell into a deeper and deeper sleep as
[10:32] the Satan has done to the modern church
[10:35] world today though the church to sleep
[10:38] giving her a self a sense of
[10:42] satisfaction a sense of having religious
[10:48] pleasure at God's expense but there she
[10:52] was with his head upon her knees and she
[10:56] loved him too
[10:57] oh wait now let's sleep us and come to
[11:01] the light on Christ will give your life
[11:03] nevertheless the Bible says when he was
[11:06] fast asleep she called for a man called
[11:11] for a preacher compliment to shave off
[11:16] all of the the seven locks that were
[11:21] upon his head now of course we know
[11:24] those seven locks are representative but
[11:28] we will not speak about that at this
[11:30] time those locks represented his
[11:34] straight they represented the perfect
[11:37] Word of God that God had given to him
[11:42] and that represents the perfect Word of
[11:45] God for our day and our team that has
[11:48] come down to us through seven church
[11:51] ages and open to us by the opening of
[11:55] the seven seals the fullness of the Word
[11:58] of God is made known to his elect to his
[12:03] hidden ones to his chosen ones the Word
[12:08] of God has been made known and they feel
[12:11] to them now she felt at that particular
[12:16] time when she had him long to sleep and
[12:21] his locks shaven off that him being
[12:26] defenseless now she could make a mock of
[12:30] him now she could attack him now she can
[12:35] pull him and bring him down to shame and
[12:37] she cried out the Philistines me upon
[12:41] this answer and the Bible records let I
[12:47] will go out as at other times he woke up
[12:52] briefly and he rose up my god and I said
[12:57] I go out as I did in the past in other
[13:00] words just like how I told that lion
[13:03] just the way you know I I defeated
[13:08] thousands of these Philistines I will go
[13:12] out again as in days of old and there
[13:17] you'll find that these things recorded
[13:20] in judges chapter 14 verse 6 verse 19
[13:26] chapter 15 verse 14 you will find this
[13:32] phrase or similar and the Spirit of the
[13:36] Lord came upon Samson and Samson toward
[13:41] the lion as if it were a kid you've
[13:44] claimed it that he picked up a jawbone
[13:47] of an ass and the Spirit of the Lord
[13:50] came upon Samson and he defeated every
[13:54] one of them my friends here in the
[13:57] scriptures three times we are finding
[14:00] this phrase and similar that it was the
[14:03] Spirit of the Lord that came upon Sansa
[14:07] that made him what he was in the eyes of
[14:11] the world at that particular time no
[14:15] doubt being loved to sleep with
[14:18] self-satisfaction and difference to
[14:20] God's work God's will and God's Way as
[14:23] the mother church he began to feel that
[14:27] he doesn't need to wait on the spirit
[14:31] but all he has to do is to shake himself
[14:33] and the world and the Spirit of the Lord
[14:37] will once again come upon him and use
[14:41] him but the Bible makes an arresting
[14:45] statement but he wished not the
[14:48] scripture says but he was not which
[14:51] means but he knew not but he did not
[14:55] recognize he was in other words unaware
[15:00] that the Spirit of God have already took
[15:04] its light the Spirit of God the dove of
[15:07] peace had left him took its flight and
[15:11] gone away from him and he was left to
[15:14] his own devices
[15:17] Sampson unaware of the
[15:21] departure of the holy spirit so what's
[15:25] the nation of Israel unaware of the
[15:30] pasture of the Holy Spirit for the Bible
[15:34] tells us in those days they're no Kings
[15:38] rule there was no king and every man did
[15:41] that which was right in his own sight
[15:44] I believe we're back to that again my
[15:47] friends where people are just doing what
[15:50] they feel what they think or what they
[15:53] like with their own series their own
[15:57] platitudes precepts their own thoughts
[16:00] and and just push aside the old family
[16:05] Bible got rid of the scriptures would
[16:09] listen to the Bible except to hear it as
[16:11] glorious literature poetry or great
[16:14] books of architecture zoology science
[16:18] whatever and whatever approach they
[16:20] would like to take to the Bible that's
[16:23] the approach they will take and see it
[16:26] in that light not recognizing it in it
[16:30] the pure infallible word of the Living
[16:33] God that's been given to us his people
[16:36] and this thing
[16:38] unaware think of it now here is fans
[16:42] with one ingredient one important and
[16:47] essential ingredient missing from his
[16:51] life the presence of the person of the
[16:55] Holy Spirit my friends I tell you in the
[16:59] name of Jesus Christ without the Holy
[17:02] Spirit a mother lies his personal
[17:06] presence his leadership his teaching and
[17:09] his control we are lost without him for
[17:13] he is our guide to guide us from Earth
[17:17] to glory my friend
[17:19] praise God hallelujah no looking up on
[17:22] Samson Samson not just the same as he
[17:27] was the day before he came to the
[17:30] harlots dipped he
[17:33] have the same muscles the same physique
[17:37] and stature but there was something
[17:40] missing it was the presence of the power
[17:44] and person of the Holy Spirit the action
[17:49] and activity of the Holy Spirit in his
[17:53] life to empower him to anoint him to
[17:56] lead him to guide him and to point in
[18:00] the right way he turned away and the
[18:03] Spirit of God you come on the glory is
[18:06] departed the Holy Spirit had left him at
[18:10] that time
[18:11] but despite the absence of the Holy
[18:15] Spirit like many of our churches today
[18:19] oh they're not those miracles we saw
[18:24] what we used to see but Gordon Langston
[18:27] and William Brennaman Velma Gardner and
[18:32] Donna be granted on robertson many of
[18:35] the old-timers kathryn kuhlman many
[18:38] honors we don't see the power of God Amy
[18:41] Semple McPherson many many others John G
[18:45] link we don't see those things anymore
[18:47] we don't see the leadership and guidance
[18:49] for the Holy Spirit as in Smith
[18:52] Wigglesworth anymore oh my friends but
[18:55] now what it takes is for them in this
[18:59] modern day the modern church takes that
[19:04] you kid it can shake itself it has
[19:07] numbers it has great big machinery of
[19:11] muscles it it has organization it has
[19:13] money so we go out this as we did before
[19:18] so my friends the Church of today
[19:22] believes that Kim in the absence of the
[19:27] presence and power and activity of the
[19:31] Holy Spirit in her lips she believes
[19:34] that she can fight against Satan sin and
[19:37] human suffering and the leads that all
[19:41] she has to do it do is to shake
[19:44] self and say who I'm under that the
[19:47] baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm under the
[19:50] anointing and that's all she has to do
[19:52] and speak in towns and dance the floor
[19:56] and run around them beliefs that she has
[19:59] the victory like that and she can go out
[20:03] as in the days of old of a super Street
[20:07] revivals she believes that that's all
[20:11] she has to do but something is missing
[20:14] something is missing
[20:16] be honest be true to yourself
[20:21] recognize the day that we are living in
[20:24] the atmosphere that we are worshiping in
[20:28] and the things that we are doing and we
[20:31] can recognize something is happening
[20:36] something is missing and everyone is
[20:40] competing with the other to shake itself
[20:43] find some new system or some new way to
[20:47] be able to shake itself and believes it
[20:50] can go out and have a local church
[20:54] revival that when there was real Holy
[20:58] Ghost revivals the revival will be miles
[21:02] away
[21:02] people were persons will come in on the
[21:05] train to attend the revival they would
[21:08] get off the river off of the train and
[21:10] many would start falling on the platform
[21:14] many will be Laughing crane repenting
[21:19] getting here turning of God I'm talking
[21:23] none of a church drummed up revival I'm
[21:26] talking about a heaven revival and the
[21:30] break the Satan's power not just on one
[21:33] life but across the entire nation across
[21:36] the that a town across a city and take
[21:40] that city innocent in his grip and rip
[21:44] it apart the Samson
[21:45] did and that the power of God and the
[21:48] reins of the Holy Spirit fall upon the
[21:52] people and change their lives forever
[21:54] for the glory of God hallelujah
[21:57] how wonderful to know that he is the
[22:00] same yesterday today and forever I'm
[22:05] happy to recognize this truth in the
[22:09] Word of God in him and so my friends I
[22:16] want to say you can't warm yourself at a
[22:24] painted fire
[22:28] many of our modern-day churches a train
[22:32] to sail their ship their gospel ship on
[22:38] yesterday's wind or breeze it would work
[22:43] my friends there's something missing and
[22:47] it's the genuine true Holy Ghost amen
[22:51] they're praying for it they're asking
[22:53] for it they want to have it and when he
[22:56] comes upon the scene that they refuse
[23:00] the Holy Spirit from this age and for
[23:03] this hour as was manifested without a
[23:08] doubt manifested and vindicated 100% by
[23:14] God's messenger and prophet William
[23:17] Aaron Brabham
[23:18] and they rejected the Holy Spirit and
[23:21] the Word of God for the hour that was
[23:24] with him and in him and turned it down
[23:28] and still believes all they have to do
[23:31] is go and shake themselves looking back
[23:36] to their past
[23:37] looking back back to their fundings and
[23:40] of the tell of their great history and
[23:43] ten of their great stories of what
[23:46] happened when their organization or
[23:49] denominational denominations began all
[23:53] my friends it's not
[23:55] what happened back then that's dense and
[23:58] this is now and my friends we must
[24:01] realize and ask God for what he is doing
[24:05] now lost things of them in the past are
[24:08] wonderful we enjoy hearing listening and
[24:12] receiving them but our focus should be
[24:15] even what is God doing now in US and
[24:19] through us for his glory and for his
[24:23] honor
[24:24] no amount of shaking of yourself of
[24:28] dreaming of revivals church sponsored
[24:32] revivals will bring back another
[24:36] Pentecost another move of God that will
[24:41] shake the devil from the from his truck
[24:44] right down to the soles of his feet and
[24:47] cast him out from the house of God out
[24:50] of the temple of the Living God my
[24:53] friends I tell you we fight here the day
[24:56] the picture of this modern church like a
[25:00] drunken man that just woke up from his
[25:04] sleep and is trying to shake himself so
[25:08] that he might come to his true senses he
[25:11] is not in a sense as he has some senses
[25:14] but he hasn't come to his full senses
[25:17] and so he's shaken himself tried to you
[25:20] know come to his senses my friends that
[25:23] will not work you may need the presence
[25:27] and power of the genuine Holy Spirit not
[25:31] some man-made made-up Holy Spirit the
[25:34] disciples asked for help
[25:35] when this ship was seeking Lord save us
[25:39] with perish but they want the Holy
[25:42] Spirit to come according to their desire
[25:46] and their quantification whatever they
[25:49] believe he should do for them not to
[25:52] tell them anything that will make them
[25:54] uneasy not to be able to really tell
[25:58] them the truth but to tickle their ears
[26:01] and to make them feel wonderful but
[26:04] step the Bible tells us in the darkness
[26:07] why upon their ship the spirit of Jesus
[26:11] came walking on the water and the
[26:15] answers to their prayer the desired
[26:17] Florida for the power of Jesus Christ to
[26:21] deliver them from the storm that was
[26:23] coming against them and when they saw
[26:26] him coming it is only two ghosts and the
[26:29] Bible said they were sore afraid of the
[26:33] very thing that could save them I
[26:36] believe that has happened in our age and
[26:39] one day you come to realize that the
[26:42] ministry of wisdom married Brendan Hale
[26:45] wants them angel messenger knock Domino
[26:50] and his wife back there but to the
[26:52] church world here to call out his bride
[26:56] his chosen wants his elected and
[26:59] separated ones to call them to attention
[27:02] of his word one day you're coming back
[27:05] around and their life that he was right
[27:09] he is right and will always be great for
[27:14] what he said was not his words it was
[27:18] thus saith the Lord in other words it
[27:22] was God speaking through that man and
[27:25] saying listen this is not William
[27:27] Brennan speaking this is the Lord
[27:30] speaking through him for the Spirit of
[27:33] God speaks through the prophet of the
[27:37] Living God
[27:38] so here we see Samson's same muscles
[27:43] same machinery same physique modern dead
[27:49] church great organization huge buildings
[27:53] great things tried to shake itself and
[27:57] to live by yesterday's fire I tell you
[28:02] if some of those founders of these
[28:04] various churches and denominations were
[28:07] to come back and to see what was taken
[28:11] place in these groups and churches and
[28:14] organizations
[28:15] that they founded their will they'll
[28:18] scream and cry as we used to tender
[28:21] there maybe turning in their graves if
[28:24] there's such a thing but my friends not
[28:26] there will not stand for what is
[28:29] happening in the various denominations
[28:32] regardless of its strength regardless of
[28:35] its name regardless of who it is and
[28:38] what it is not even being true to their
[28:40] own faith to their own founders to their
[28:43] own founding to their own foundations
[28:46] they have shifted off their foundation
[28:48] and are walking contrary to the Word of
[28:52] God and a servant of the Living God back
[28:56] to the word back to the Bible back to
[28:58] the original faith God is calling his
[29:01] people and his church back to the faith
[29:04] of our fathers living still in spite of
[29:07] all of fire on the sword all of the
[29:11] persecution him had prayed friends
[29:14] Samson behold the Philistines are upon
[29:17] the Church of the Living God wake up
[29:21] worldliness is upon you my woe
[29:24] Samson tried to shake himself to get the
[29:28] many man-made revival by shaking himself
[29:33] but it didn't work he wanted to go out
[29:36] and do battle with dog demons
[29:40] thus Philistine spirits lost man at that
[29:45] time but we fight not against flesh and
[29:47] blood but against principalities and
[29:49] powers and spiritual wickedness and the
[29:53] rulers of darkness of this world and
[29:56] that modern-day Church is going out in
[30:01] equipped missing the presence and power
[30:05] of the great Holy Spirit yes they'll say
[30:09] we have it but the evidence is not their
[30:13] numbers money organization Business
[30:17] Administration marketing public
[30:19] relations that's my
[30:21] what I'm talking about I'm talking about
[30:24] the power of the presence of the Holy
[30:26] Spirit coming down upon a village a town
[30:29] a city or a nation and man will have to
[30:34] subject what is this what's going on
[30:36] what does this mean and the Apostle
[30:40] Hester said this is that spoken by the
[30:42] prophet of Malachi 4:5 that God promised
[30:47] that he will pour out his spirit bought
[30:49] former and latter rain coming together
[30:52] the teaching rain and the harvest rain
[30:55] combined together falling upon the
[30:58] Church of God and the glory of the
[31:01] latter house all my friends greater than
[31:04] that of the former what are what a
[31:07] season what a time back to your original
[31:09] faith back to the Word of God listen to
[31:13] the message of this hour
[31:15] go back and read the writings hear the
[31:19] tapes of Windom present and it will
[31:22] shake you to your roots under your
[31:24] foundation and you will realize and
[31:27] recognize that man was speaking nothing
[31:30] but the truth amen yes sir here we are
[31:36] trained to work to do battle trying to
[31:41] come against the Philistines in his own
[31:47] strength he had the physical night and
[31:53] the machinery made us the missing
[31:57] ingredient of the Spirit of God doesn't
[32:00] this not bring to mind Zechariah chapter
[32:03] 4 verse 6 not by might not by power but
[32:08] by my spirit saith the Lord
[32:11] yes the church today trying to battle
[32:16] against Satan using human knowledge
[32:20] using psychology psychiatry using all
[32:25] the various ologies whether it's t ology
[32:29] humor Harmon UNIX technology technology
[32:35] in and all these things trying to fight
[32:39] Satan with with doctrines and with Greek
[32:42] interpretations and and or and IRA makin
[32:45] Hebrew and and and debates over these
[32:48] matters and trying to fight Satan with
[32:50] that you are defeated before new you
[32:53] have even started
[32:54] you cannot fight and defeat Satan upon
[32:57] those grounds because Satan is a being
[33:01] or spirit that is over six thousand
[33:04] years old in ancient evil wisdom and do
[33:10] you believe that you will compete with
[33:13] him with your puny human wisdom against
[33:18] him you cannot do it but with God's help
[33:22] you can with God's power you can with
[33:25] the Holy Spirit in you you can the
[33:28] genuine Holy Spirit for he has sent in
[33:31] my name they cast out devils and casting
[33:35] out Devils is casting out the unbelief
[33:38] out of the heart of that person first of
[33:40] all before any other thing praise God
[33:44] hallelujah
[33:45] think of it Samson was laid up captive
[33:50] he found himself in a bind and being in
[33:57] a bind
[33:59] he was made blind and be made blind and
[34:05] in a bind the Philistines made him to
[34:09] grind he had a hard life trying to go
[34:13] back to that anointing that power and
[34:17] presence of God that was upon his life
[34:21] and so the Philistines had a great feast
[34:25] a feast of celebration to celebrate
[34:30] their capture of Samson I believe even
[34:35] now with the behavior of a modern church
[34:40] Satan is having a celebration in the
[34:42] pits of hell demons are dancing salomi
[34:47] is dancing the lion is dancing the
[34:49] members of Mystery Babylon are having a
[34:52] great party time all them great
[34:55] performers that did not heed the Word of
[34:58] God and maybe was famous upon the earth
[35:01] where are they now maybe they're dancing
[35:04] but it's where they're dancing they're
[35:05] dancing because it may be too hot furred
[35:08] like a Cat on a Hot Tin Roof they can't
[35:13] stop now because the heat is on oh
[35:15] brother sister he's the voice of God the
[35:19] Word of God for this hour rip cooked up
[35:22] God if you're backslidden turn back turn
[35:25] back and come to God he'd receive you
[35:28] with open arms he loved you and open up
[35:31] his word and reveal it to you and your
[35:34] strength will return your strength will
[35:38] come again your life will be renew your
[35:41] walk will be led by him guided by him
[35:45] and ordered your footsteps will be
[35:48] ordered by the Lord Himself and so they
[35:53] have their great celebration the party
[35:56] was in swing and so here comes Samson
[36:00] let bhaiyya allowed a young boy until a
[36:06] young telogen a page here he was the
[36:10] letter that was the leader of Samson
[36:13] imagine a great world church a brain
[36:17] anointed church that defeated every
[36:20] devil and every demon and every power
[36:23] that comes its way and always took it
[36:25] stand up on the old fashioned work of
[36:28] God now has to be led by some
[36:32] theological dandy on the floor of
[36:38] celebration mockery jesting and called
[36:43] upon to do all kinds of tricks oh just
[36:47] as they did with gee
[36:49] when he was on the cross tell us who hit
[36:51] you
[36:52] we know you have the gift of discernment
[36:53] why don't you tell us who hit you know
[36:56] your platform and why don't you tell us
[36:58] who hit you but God is Paris God doesn't
[37:02] show off
[37:04] God is not a performance he's not there
[37:08] to show off his power but the shines
[37:11] love for his people to deliver his
[37:14] people Oh to put his arms around his
[37:17] people and for them to know he is real
[37:21] so he their doubts could be settled as
[37:24] the Sun set and they can say I know I
[37:26] know
[37:27] this is real no matter what they that
[37:30] the priest told me no matter what the
[37:33] bishop told me no matter what this great
[37:35] authority figure told me I'm known for
[37:39] myself in my heart it's real for it's
[37:43] been revealed to me and I see the
[37:46] presence and the hand of God making
[37:49] himself known to me this great warrior
[37:52] they live like that here we see the
[37:56] picture of a bound and blinded and
[38:00] defeated church of the last day
[38:02] a modern day church kept you captivated
[38:06] by and focused on religious performances
[38:12] religious entertainment for pleasing the
[38:17] audience and with a motive of filling
[38:22] every seat within the building focus on
[38:27] bringing them back wanting them to come
[38:31] back again to church to receive more not
[38:36] realizing than in the Bible sometimes
[38:40] God allows blessed subtractions because
[38:44] when his perilous presence countless
[38:46] parts displayed many times it's not only
[38:49] in healing but many Liars are sometimes
[38:53] struck down dead many look at their site
[38:57] and will try to blaspheme
[39:00] the presence of God were dead blinded
[39:03] even for a season
[39:04] yes sir and great the Bible tells us in
[39:08] the book of Acts and great fear came
[39:10] upon the people yes sir and many of them
[39:14] never came back
[39:15] why this was real this was not a job
[39:18] this was not a musical entertainment
[39:19] this was not something that made you
[39:22] feel nice you were on day on the edge of
[39:26] your pew my friend I have literally seen
[39:30] nah not just in my preaching but I've
[39:33] seen it in other preachers now the place
[39:36] has been anointed of God
[39:38] where the devil moving up on the middle
[39:41] cut knots
[39:42] tender presence of Almighty God and just
[39:46] run out they could not take the Word of
[39:49] God in the presence on an atmosphere of
[39:51] that blessed Holy Spirit it's real
[39:54] friends it's real the days of miracles
[39:58] are not past the days of Acts is not
[40:01] pass the Holy Spirit now wants to write
[40:05] another book of Acts acting true you
[40:08] acting through anyone that will
[40:11] surrender themselves completely and
[40:14] fully into hand humble ourselves be
[40:18] reverent be faithful and God will bless
[40:21] you and lead you and guide you and bring
[40:24] you to the fullness of what you have
[40:26] read within this Bible many of our
[40:30] churches have lowered themselves to
[40:33] pandering and and preaching a simpering
[40:38] gospel in a party light atmosphere
[40:43] flashing lights of multicolored lights
[40:47] jazzy Christian rock music backed up by
[40:51] this multicolored smoke and mirrors and
[40:55] that all day religious tinsel and
[40:59] religious razzle-dazzle and then turn
[41:03] around and call that
[41:06] the Holy Spirit and when that happens
[41:10] there is hardly any difference between
[41:14] the world and its worthiness and with a
[41:19] church that's trying to display the
[41:23] supernatural holiness sanctification of
[41:27] the presence of God in her nest and in
[41:31] the life of those believers and when
[41:36] there is that kind of atmosphere the
[41:40] only difference between a rock band and
[41:43] a rough party in a rut entertainment is
[41:47] that one is singing the word his sons
[41:49] with whirling lyrics and the other one
[41:52] is doing similarly the same thing with
[41:56] the religious words religious lyrics
[42:01] religious sounds upon it and that's all
[42:05] it's this guy's on the jazzy stuff all
[42:09] the rock stuff all this guy's under the
[42:13] clothing of Christian lyrics and
[42:17] religious terminology and so proud the
[42:22] same worldly music I'm not saying that
[42:27] you cannot have music in the church that
[42:29] has some life to it that's not what I'm
[42:31] talking about I'm talking about that you
[42:34] know it I don't have to explain it
[42:36] you'll know the difference if you're
[42:38] filled with the Holy Spirit
[42:40] my friends they wanna use religious
[42:43] lyrics to make it acceptable to people
[42:47] and palatable to to those of some of the
[42:51] old-fashioned believers that wants to
[42:55] hold on to God's unchanging hand for
[42:58] God's Word does not change inviting
[43:02] so-called Christians and truthless
[43:06] Christian comedians
[43:10] Christian magicians into the house of
[43:15] God the devil mocking the church through
[43:21] these various kinds of activities
[43:25] performing within these churches
[43:29] improperly dressed men half-dressed
[43:32] women in every part and every aspect of
[43:37] church from church life sex sin and
[43:42] seduction has crept in to the presence
[43:46] of God in the atmosphere of the Church
[43:49] of the Living God as the scripture has
[43:52] said sin crouching at your door
[43:56] sin is waiting at your door to pounce
[44:00] upon you o friend what a hour what a
[44:04] thing that we are living in what's
[44:06] taking place here up on the face of the
[44:09] earth
[44:09] now they unsaved unbelieving unsaved
[44:15] celebrities are now allowed to step into
[44:20] the puppets the stand behind God's
[44:24] sacred desk all with the motives of
[44:30] enhancing Church profile the church
[44:34] profile in the community for everyone to
[44:38] know that this is a high-class
[44:41] Church to which celebrities dignitaries
[44:46] jeweled ladies and and you know
[44:50] marvelous successful powerful money men
[44:54] come to and create that atmosphere and
[44:58] reputation increasing their numbers and
[45:02] with them focus of amassing great
[45:05] fortunes and great wealth the foolish
[45:09] things be upon thee Samson you left your
[45:12] first love remember from whence you are
[45:15] fallen remember your beginnings remember
[45:18] your origins return back to where you
[45:22] started
[45:23] recapture rekindle that heat the passion
[45:25] the zeal of your first lab bathtub God
[45:28] back to the Bible back to the original
[45:31] faith your fingers your the old men of
[45:35] God whether it be William Booth or or or
[45:40] this one or that one I don't want to
[45:41] call all the names of lost men godly men
[45:45] a million by the Holy Spirit would be
[45:48] ashamed if they came back to see what
[45:51] was taking place within these groups
[45:53] that they started some of them never
[45:56] even intended for the groups to become
[45:58] denominations but they turn them into
[46:01] denominations which is to make
[46:03] themselves a defender of the faith to
[46:06] build walls around themselves we've
[46:08] become Christian fortifications and
[46:11] they're holding the fort for jesus is
[46:14] coming we'll hold the fort for i am
[46:16] coming this we called the home before we
[46:20] are called to break down the walls we
[46:22] are called to come to him and know him
[46:25] to know winter is the no life eternal
[46:29] and to make all men see what is the
[46:33] Fellowship of the mystery when that
[46:36] revelation of the Word of God through
[46:38] his tricks you all the Watchmen on the
[46:41] walls of Zion will see eye to eye not by
[46:45] the beta and strife not by fending and
[46:48] proving not by debate or argument
[46:51] tension not my logic didactic or what
[46:55] otherwise but by my friends the union of
[46:59] the Holy Spirit and harmony of the Holy
[47:02] Ghost in the life of the true believer
[47:04] that walks with him and talks with him
[47:08] every day of their life and now because
[47:13] of this the modern church has left off
[47:18] from the principles of the word of God
[47:21] and Satan has invaded the church where
[47:26] it's now filled with hot stirs
[47:29] and religious content marketers selling
[47:36] in the temple all manner of religious
[47:40] products and paths anelia
[47:43] being sold in the name of Christ and the
[47:46] cross and going for making men and women
[47:52] to fall more the child of Hell I tell
[47:55] you wake up sense of the Philistines me
[47:58] upon you come to yourself recognize who
[48:02] you are come back to the Word of God
[48:04] made a deep call to the deep and may the
[48:07] deep respond here that they come men
[48:11] tricksters and I must say it outright
[48:16] fraud artists playing God's people
[48:20] forgetting and fame at any cost
[48:24] also many false prophets have gone out
[48:27] into Matthew 24 Jesus prophesied is
[48:31] false prophets will be here in the land
[48:36] deceiving and being deceived preaching
[48:40] preaching popularity same but not blood
[48:45] not preaching about the blood of Jesus
[48:48] cleanses us from all sin not even
[48:51] preaching about shame they'll talk about
[48:53] bad habits they'll talk about don't do
[48:56] those bad things that was evil things
[48:59] are cultured in such palatable soft
[49:04] acceptable terms not true not with the
[49:08] words of a true son are dire of God not
[49:12] being irresponsible either but speaking
[49:15] the truth in love that the Word of God
[49:18] may go forth here we find that friends
[49:22] that they want and many of these would
[49:26] even use the word hell they would preach
[49:29] above hell
[49:30] Oh to preach about help lose my ministry
[49:35] the people will leave the church the
[49:37] offerings will go down
[49:39] Porter's are going to get me out of here
[49:41] I can't use that word that's an
[49:45] old-fashioned word I can only say that
[49:48] you will be sent to a bad place or order
[49:52] even say well hell is is living a bad
[49:55] life while you're here alert I'll tell
[49:57] you when you get your deathbed and feel
[50:01] death rattling in your trunk and there's
[50:04] not time for you saying or doing
[50:06] anything you'll note that you'll be too
[50:08] late then my friend give your life to
[50:11] Christ now while there is yet time to
[50:14] get your lighter of him and know him in
[50:17] the power of his resurrection
[50:19] these have diluted and perverted and
[50:22] subversive the true fate of the Word of
[50:25] God these beautiful whited warm churches
[50:29] have become infested with demons Matthew
[50:35] 13:31 the 32 the Bible says God's tree
[50:40] has become a nesting birds revelation
[50:45] the tree in its maturity revelation 18 1
[50:48] 2 4 describe that tree as a habitation
[50:52] Mystery Babylon habitation of unclean
[50:58] spirits and fowl Birds
[51:00] and so lake Sampson the church has
[51:04] become a prisoner of the world and now
[51:07] has to perform a bunch of religious
[51:10] tricks and making religious seals to
[51:16] entertain them and now the churches are
[51:21] trying to outdo each other with that
[51:23] trying to get the attention in the world
[51:26] trying to get the praise of men and
[51:29] praise of the world and anything to get
[51:34] themselves in the newspapers on TV or in
[51:39] the seat of government occupied with an
[51:45] insatiable desire for wanting to be seen
[51:48] and praise of men but the true church
[51:53] was not called to be successful not in
[51:57] the worldly sense but the church was
[52:00] called by God to be faithful be thou
[52:03] faithful unto death and I will give you
[52:06] a crown of life that fadeth not away in
[52:10] my friends here we find you say brother
[52:13] Simon you seem to have a dark world view
[52:15] of this modern church yes I do because I
[52:19] read and fully understood and was
[52:22] properly taught about Leticia and
[52:25] revelation chapter 3 how she will become
[52:29] a different self satisfied lukewarm and
[52:33] nos don't increase with God groups rich
[52:37] and most now not your wretched naked
[52:41] blind and like Samson all the way and
[52:45] not not not aware of what has really
[52:50] happened and is happening in the Church
[52:53] of the Living God the Bible crazy when
[52:57] there comes come to me and by I saw so
[53:00] that your eyes will be opened that you
[53:03] can recognize not just sing the song
[53:07] open the eyes of my heart Lord has a
[53:09] nice religious but actually really cry
[53:13] out to God and ask him to open the eyes
[53:17] of your heart not to a church not to
[53:20] your church fundamentals not be a church
[53:22] doctrines don't worry binders on your
[53:25] eyes but to the full Word of God
[53:27] whatever God wants to reveal to you that
[53:31] you will see it through the eyes of your
[53:33] heart in the fullness of the Holy Spirit
[53:36] and so the mother church has become a
[53:37] stumbling block to many outside like
[53:40] Samson having all the physical muscles
[53:44] powers machinery might numbers money but
[53:49] the genuine Holy Spirit is gone the
[53:52] glory of God has departed he was not by
[53:56] the Spirit of God had departed from from
[53:59] him the church appealing for more and
[54:01] more money instead of more honey when
[54:04] Jake
[54:05] sons were going into Egypt to meet with
[54:08] their brother Joseph their father gave
[54:11] them some money and they were rushing
[54:13] out the door to start their journey and
[54:15] had to he had to tell them now you also
[54:18] need to take some honey and some other
[54:21] spices we need to have the full of
[54:25] fruits of the spirit we need to have the
[54:28] virtues of the Holy Spirit and the Word
[54:31] of God in its fullness pouring out and
[54:34] living in the Church of God for this
[54:36] last day all friends attend new friends
[54:40] what must the church do get together to
[54:43] this bind the churches in the church
[54:46] needs to repent sincerely repent I know
[54:49] the word repent is used over and over
[54:52] until it's become the devil has
[54:54] literally like normalize it it doesn't
[54:56] mean much to people but a genuine
[54:58] repentance not betray eyes but where
[55:02] those blinded eye-sockets but pour down
[55:06] tears of sorrow and repentance and say
[55:10] Lord I'm coming home I'm coming home
[55:13] never more to Rome oh Jesus the entire
[55:18] church and the individuals preachers
[55:21] also come fullness and chest themselves
[55:25] at the feet of the Lord Jesus Christ my
[55:28] friends no matter how dirty it becomes
[55:30] God never leaves himself without a
[55:34] witness
[55:34] he always has a faithful view he always
[55:38] has a little flock he always has his
[55:43] hidden wants their hidden and yet
[55:47] they're everywhere
[55:49] they're in this message there in the
[55:51] denominations they're eating from Jessi
[55:54] bells tingle but yet they're hid from
[55:57] the from the from the world some are
[56:00] still in Mystery Babylon and the
[56:02] organization's and the crying was gone
[56:05] come out of her my people and be not
[56:10] partakers of our sins back to the Bible
[56:14] may God bring us back to the old time
[56:16] holy spin
[56:17] the paragon of manifestations of the
[56:21] Word of God in our lives and bring that
[56:25] missing ingredient back in the house of
[56:28] God and in the Church of God we need
[56:33] supernatural activity of the Holy Spirit
[56:35] in God's church where liars are struck
[56:39] down where many who are unqualified step
[56:45] up to take the Lord's Supper and I'll
[56:48] shut down by the presence of God except
[56:51] me examine themselves then great fear
[56:54] will come upon the church that this is
[56:55] not some story to be told this is not
[56:58] fun this is not a joke this is a real
[57:01] living God who lives and moves and
[57:05] reigns now and forevermore
[57:07] we have serve our God bring the church
[57:10] back that when the church praise was
[57:12] present doors open lame men walk praise
[57:15] God and the Word of God began to spread
[57:18] and multiply not dependency on marketing
[57:23] systems and assimilation and
[57:25] psychological systems and the teaching
[57:27] of psychology and that sort of stuff my
[57:30] friends in a book of of Acts where the
[57:33] Holy Ghost fell they didn't need any of
[57:36] those things in one day 3,000 came to
[57:40] Christ and over you will read it in
[57:42] various chapters all the talk was God
[57:45] deciding to come on the scene by the
[57:48] cries and the prayers and repentance of
[57:51] his people which are called by his name
[57:53] and to come on the scene and that he is
[57:57] the answer for Jesus is the answer to
[58:00] all our warnings he is the answer to all
[58:02] that needs my friends may God help us in
[58:06] these closing days of time as the old
[58:09] song says it's the old time Holy Spirit
[58:13] and that devil will go near it that's
[58:16] the reason people fear it but it's
[58:18] goodie not for me
[58:21] give me that old-time religion give me
[58:24] of that old-time religion
[58:26] god bless you my friends let us pray Oh
[58:28] gracious help me Father we thank you for
[58:31] your word we thank you for the great
[58:33] Holy Spirit taking all the showmanship
[58:36] all the tricks all our Hollywood tinsel
[58:39] and the religious razzle-dazzle Oh to
