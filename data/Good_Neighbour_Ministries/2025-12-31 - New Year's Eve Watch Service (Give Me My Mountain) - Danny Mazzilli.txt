The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, the world and they that dwell therein. for he had found it upon the seas and establish it upon the floods. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands and a pure heart, who had not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor swore unto deceitfully. He shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the God of his salvation. Is he your savior tonight? Amen. Hallelujah. Receive him tonight. Amen. This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, oh Jacob sila. Lift up your heads, O E gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty. &gt;&gt; The Lord mighty in battle. &gt;&gt; He fights your battle tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So don't be discouraged. Amen. He's the one that's leading. Hallelujah. Who is this king of glory? The Lord of hosts. He is the king of glory. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. And as I said tonight, it's only by his grace I can stand here tonight because 12 months ago it could have been a different story. &gt;&gt; Amen. I could have been gone. But it's only by his grace that I can stand here and testify of his goodness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Just a few weeks ago, I celebrated my 70th birthday. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I thank the Lord for bringing me thus far through many dangers, toys, and snear. He had brought me thus far. And by his grace, he's going to take me home because I have blessed assurance that Jesus is mine. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was testifying to a doctor just a couple days ago. You know, have you ever thought about this God that you you say you're serving? Humanly speaking, right? As humans, we think that God is is just something or someone that had a beginning. You know when you talk about when you sit a little bit and ponder right you as a human being you had a mother you had a father. Amen. But this God didn't have a beginning. He's eternal. &gt;&gt; The one that you feel right now as amongst us. You see we're two or three that are gathered in his name. He's in the midst and he's here to bless you tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's the one that chose you. Yeah. Before this world was &gt;&gt; Amen. The word has been coming forth over and over again to nail it down into your heart, but you got to receive the revelation of what it is. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. And I was telling this doctor, I said, "Listen, do you could you analyze God as a doctor? When you look at a human body, it's a marvelous thing how we are formed. The different systems in your body, there got to be a super intelligence out there that form this body. Look at this whole universe. And as our pastor was saying, everything is working in order. &gt;&gt; It's nothing is out of order. Amen. So there got to be a super intelligence that made you &gt;&gt; that placed you here on this earth for a purpose. &gt;&gt; And you got to find your purpose why you're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Did you find your purpose? &gt;&gt; We here to worship him. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's love worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. And those that worship him as our bread must worship him in spirit and in truth. Amen. There's a balance. A bird don't fly on one wing. There is a balance. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. And the balance for this day is the revealed word of the hour with the Holy Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank God for his grace in each and one of our lives. Amen. He is the one that chose us before the foundations of this world. Amen. You say you choose Jesus as your savior. He know the choices that you going you going to make when you get here. That's why he put you down in the lamb's book of life. God being God. This great being that we talk about the one that we serve. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. I don't want to be going on preaching because I got to leave uh some for the other ministers when they come here to share their testimony. Amen. About how the Lord brought them out. Amen. And share a word of encouragement tonight. You are God's test piece here. And God has some nondestructive test pieces amongst us. &gt;&gt; There's a part of you that cannot be destroyed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what Satan tried to put on you, he cannot destroy you because he said all that he he had given him, they shall come. They shall come. None going to be lost.

Every single star, [music] signal fire [singing] of grace, and the nation sings [music and singing] your praises. So alive. [music] So love God of your promise. [music] Don't speak in vain. [singing] Sill empty your voice. You are [music] spoken. All nature [singing] and science follow [music] the sound of your voice. And as you [music and singing] speak, a 100 billion [singing] creatures catch your [music] breath. evolving in [singing] pursuit [music] of what you said. If it all reveals your nature so light, I can see your heart in everything you [music and singing] say. Every painted sky, [singing] a canvas of your [music] grace.

You're the one who never leave the [music and singing] one behind. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [applause] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Wonderful. Um, we said we were going to take up an offering. So, let's do that before it leaves me. This will be the last one be uh the year and give you an opportunity to give and and get everything in, you know, uh the last opportunity of the year to give back to him in this kind of a way, right? So, let's bow our heads. Father, we thank you for this uh time and uh day that we're living in and the the funds that you've supplied us. you supplied us more with with so much, Lord, and and we're so grateful. And we know that you are a God that uh is a God of abundance. So, we're asking you to bless each and every person here as they give. And may the Holy Spirit just fulfill his word in us. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You believe God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, Sister Amanda wanted to give a short testimony. She's the uh actually the only one who who uh sent in that. Okay, I'll get up and give a quick testimony. So, let's hear her right now. God bless her. [applause] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. I had this thought that maybe I should give this testimony, but I waited because I said perhaps this would be the year that Brother Mike would be like, "Oh my gosh, it's so much we have to put some off for Sunday. But then he called and he in conversation with my beloved back there. He's like the sister Amanda have a testimony. Quick short one. So from the lamb's book of life, here's a paragraph of my life, his life in me. I know that this testimony is meant to be a blessing because this is the time he chose to give it. So for whomsoever he has this testimony for through this trial that I experienced. He let me know that this trial was not meant to punish me. It wasn't something that I did, but I learned from it. I grew from it. And that it was meant to be a blessing to somebody else who was going through something. Whatever that interprets as, he's our God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we live to give him glory. And in this paragraph, this year, one of the greatest trials that I had was with my health. Now, he's been struggling to bring me down and put me down with all sorts of things. And he turned up the heat this year. So, um, I start having heart, my heart racing out of nowhere, it would just be pounding really, really loudly that I can hear my heart rate in my ear. And the pews we had before, if I was sitting, I would literally be pushed off. It was so intense. And so it continued. It continued. This is the third time that I have been asked by my doctor to wear a heart monitor. And now I was referred this year to a cardiologist because I got a smart watch. And my doctor says it's not always accurate, but hopefully the cardiologist would be able to help you figure out what's happening and if it's real or something's happening. I went to the cardiologist. Before that, they took my blood work. Praise God. Whenever I've had to do a blood work, it's come back a-ok. Okay. Nothing's ever been wrong with my blood work. And every time I look at that or I hear that, I go, Satan, you see, you can't take my life. My life is in the blood. What are you trying to do? You have no roots in there. He's grasping at straws. But listen, it got real this year. Like really real. When the symptoms of the attacks of the enemy come upon your flesh, they are real and it affects your mind. You begin to think and the battle begins. Am I going to accept this? And what portion am I going to accept? Because as he's pushing his thoughts or all these things on you, you're pushing back because fate's in there. It's alive. It's well to tell his story. Uh so I had a couple of different series of tests done. I wore a mon monitor for like 14 days. I had a stress test done and then my husband accompanied me four to six weeks after for the results. Now, this is the cardiologist. We go and we sit in his office and he's terribly late. We're sitting there for an hour past the appointment time. So, now I'm thinking, is it that he found something and he can't read what it says? So, my husband is like, "Don't worry, don't worry. He'll get there." We sit there and he turns his monitor to the to us so we can see what's on his screen. and all the medical the medical chart is there with the waves and whatever and at the bottom there's a technician's report and it says um it says um pro probability of a blockage he says just ignore that this is this is the the cardiologist saying just ignore that was like wow God's God's at work already he goes on and he says all I can tell tell you is that we picked up palpitations. So my heart the racing of my heart. They last for about a minute but then you go back to normal. What does that translate to? We don't have enough info for you. So here's what we're going to introduce you to. A few lifestyle changes because as you get older in age, women, sisters, I'm sharing this with you. um your estrogen, your estrogen level goes down and it causes your heart to work harder to push the blood up and that tends to make your heart rate raise. So for me, I got to work on building my leg muscles, drinking water, staying away from coffee, and taking magnesium. And I have a choice. I can have him do an incision and put in a little monitor that he can monitor for himself. I was like, not an option for me, doctor. What's next? Well, we have a portable ECG device that you can carry around and whenever you feel it, you you let it take a reading and after you've taken the reading or such and such, you bring it back to us so we can better understand what's happening with you. That's where that left off. But while that was happening, I was having memory problems. Boy, oh boy, it just keeps getting more and more. Now, some of you are hearing this for the first time. When the pressure came, I was so grateful that our deacons and our pastor prayed with me because in that moment, I know I needed reinforcement. It got really bad to the point where I don't know, I thought this was maybe my time. I don't know. But I I praise God for them and for each of you. And we didn't put it on the chat for everybody to pray because to me I felt like the family of God was already in their battle. They were enough and they are enough. And I praise God for each and every one of them. And my deacon called every deacon that was possible on that Sunday and prayed. And I was at rest. And then when the devil stirred up, I said to my pastor after a Wednesday night, "Pastor, can you pray?" And it wasn't the prayer in as much as the prayer that he prayed, but he began to minister about the fear I had. I never told him exactly what he said. But it wasn't the fear of dying, but the fear of leaving my loved ones that I feared. And he said, Why don't you worry? You're a seed of God. You can't die. When he ministered, that was it. I had no trouble. I had no trouble. Um, from my head injury, I saw a neurologist. No correction. I did a CT scan on my head and I'm awaiting currently a neurologist. So the technician of that report said, "Well, in the scans, we saw bright spots in your head." Thank God for AI that reads medical reports. I couldn't understand them. Basically, it's the the the bright spots are blockages in my nerve endings in my brain, which I don't have to rush off because it's not brain damage. And so, all that being said, I if you ask me if I have a heart problem, I don't have a heart problem. I just love praising the Lord. My heart can't keep up. Not by problem. Um [laughter] and and so I leave it in the hands of the Lord. So when I was asked to do this, there was something he reminded me. He is still the way. He's still the truth. And he's still the life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if he got me through it, he's going to get you through. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. [applause] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. He's got it all in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; So if he's got it all in control, then I will praise the [music] Lord. Yes, I [music] will praise the Lord [music] no matter what [singing] tomorrow hold, what it has in [music] store. [music and singing] Anybody else? Oh, I will [music] praise the Lord. [music] I will praise the Lord. [music] No matter what, Sister Sheila, what it has in [music] store. [singing] Oh, when I saw that cleansing fountain, [singing and music] oh wide for all my sins. I obey the [music] spirit's word. Oh, when he said, "Wil thou [singing] clean." Let's all stand and sing and pray. Oh, I will praise him. [music] I will praise him. Praise the Lamb for sinners. [music] Give [singing] him glory. [music] Last verse is blessed be the name of [music] Jesus. Oh, blessed [singing] be the name Jesus. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he took me. [singing] Oh, he's [music] forgiven my transgression. And he [music] has cleansed my heart from sin. [music] And I will praise him. Praise the [music] lamb for sinners. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Let [music] go of the old and lay lay hold [music] on the new and lay it down a new [music] Life is [music] Come on everybody clap and sing. Let go. So let let go [music] of the old. Amen. And lay hold [music] of the new and lay it down. [music] A new life is found. [music] One more time. Let go of the old. [singing] Let go [music] of the old the and come sister. Oh, and you [music] and there [singing] a new life waits for you. [music] Amen. True, true, true. God bless you once again. Be seated. Sister is going to sing for us. God bless her. And speaking of trials and things, we'll let her sing. God bless &gt;&gt; you. Thank you, saints. Um, this is my song of victory. 2025 2025. [laughter] But I'm here and this is my song of victory [applause] and my song of praise. How [music] can I say thanks for the things you have done [music] for me? things [music and singing] yet undeserved. Yeah. You gave [music] to prove your love [singing] for me. The [music] voices of a myth. I'm sorry. I can't see the words. I apologize. [music] &gt;&gt; Yes, I can see those. I I'm [music] sorry. I apologize. [music] [music] How can I say thanks for the [music] things you have done for me? things [music] so undeserved. Yeah. [music] You gave to prove your [singing] love for me. [music] The voices of a million [singing] angels could [music] not express my gratitude. [singing] All that I am [music] and ever hope to be. I owe it [music] all right now to thee. To God [singing] be the glory. [music] To God [singing] be the gloryy. [music] To God [singing] [music] be the gloryy for the [singing] things he has done. [music] Just let [singing] me fill my land and let it be [music] pleasing Lord to thee. And should I gain, should [music and singing] I gain any praise, let it go to Calary. [music] [singing] How for [music] me the very same [singing] heart that flings [music] in or runs to the weary, [music] the mourns [singing] the weak. In [music] the same gentle hands that hold me when [singing] I'm broken. They conquer [music] death to bring [singing] me victory. Now I know [singing] my redeemer [music] lives. lives. I [singing] know my [music] redeemer lives. So let all creation testify. Let this life within me cry. [music] My [singing] redeemer. To God be the [music and singing] glory. To God [singing] be [music] the glory. [singing] To God be [music] the glory for the things [singing] he has done. With his love [music and singing] he has saved me. With his power he has raised [singing] me to come [music] the glory for the things he has done. [singing] Oh, with his love [music] you have great power.

Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Phillip is going to say a few words. Another one of our precious deacons. Wonderful man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless [laughter] you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's give God an applause. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; And I'm just grateful for what God has done for of us to bring us through 2025. And like myself, our family went through um a lot of things, but scripture said many afflictions of the righteous and I believe that God has brought us all through. Amen. &gt;&gt; In all afflictions, he take care of us. So I'm very grateful, thankful to the Lord for his grace and mercy. And as we entering 2026, I have a two scriptures, one scripture and just a small quotation from Bra. I just want to share with the church. I hope that it blesses all of us as we entering 2026. And my scripture is taken from 3r John 1:2. It says that beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest pro prosper and be in health even as thy soul prosper. As our former pastor has always been saying that redemption in three parts. So as we entering the year 2026 don't accept one part redemption. &gt;&gt; We have to accept all three parts of the redemption. And say over here in just one more time, Lord. And paragraph 121 say 3012. He said, "And somebody said something about divine healing." And they claimed it was another day. See, pointing off to what was maybe to be over in the millennium. What do you need divine healing in the millennium for when you are immortal? Today is the day. This is the day. &gt;&gt; So don't let nobody tells [applause] you that you need divine healing over there. You don't need over there. Your prosperity you need it now. &gt;&gt; You are living with great substance. &gt;&gt; The first they went with great substance. We're living back with great substance. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. The same God that spoke to the woman at the well. The same God that spoke to Moses, the same God that parted the mighty Red Sea, that same God lives in you and in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just as we entering 2026, I encourage everyone remember no matter what happens your way, that same God lives in you. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. That's the little exaltation I have. Amen. He's the same God. He has the children. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Every praise [music] is to our [singing] God. Every word of worship in one accord. Every praise, [singing and music] every praise is to our God. Come on now. Sing hallelujah [music] to our God. Glory hallelujah to our God. Every praise. [music] Let me hear one more time. Every praise, every praise to our God. [music and singing] Every word of worship in one accord. Every [music] praise. Every [singing] praise to our God. [music] Sing hallelujah. Glory hallelujah [music] to our God. All right. Where we were. [music] Come on now. Oh God my savior. God my healer.

[singing and music] &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every morning, you should get up and say, "Yes, he is. He's a He's my healer. He's my savior. He's my redeemer. He's my help." Amen. &gt;&gt; Look in the mirror and say, "My God is a a healer this morning." Praise God. His word is true. &gt;&gt; Are you happy? &gt;&gt; Amen. You serve a God like that. All right, you can be seated for a second. Sister Bernice here is going to sing a song for us &gt;&gt; and we're moving along. God bless you. &gt;&gt; All my words fall short. I've [music] got nothing new. How could I express all [music] my gratitude? I could sing [music and singing] these songs as I often do, but every [music and singing] song must stand and you [music] never do. So [singing] I'll throw up my hands and praise [music] you again and again. Cuz all that I have is a [music] hallelujah. Hallelu. [music] And I know it's [singing] not much, but I've nothing else fit for a [music] king except for a heart singing hallelujah. Hallelu. I've got one [music] resp. I've got [singing] just one move.

Sister Deborah Beers, she's going to give her her [music] personal testimony. But we have one more song special. And uh that was uh I believe the the only person who actually physically called me. Everybody else was text. That's which is perfectly fine. But when sister Mary [music] called me, I said, "Oh, of course." And it brought tears to my eyes right there and at work and I just said, "Oh, of course." So she's going to come and sing. But first, life is easy [music] when you're up on the mountain and you've got peace of mind like you [music] never know. But then things change and [music] you're down in the valley. Oh, don't lose faith. [music] For you're never alone. Come on. What a God on the mountain. [music] There's still God in the valley. When things go wrong, he'll make [music] it right. And the God of the good times [music and singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, we got to sing the second verse. Well, you talk [music] of faith. You're up on a mountain, [singing] but the dark [music] comes so easy when life is [singing] pain. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; But it's down in the valley of trials and temptations. That's when [music] faith is really put to the test [music] for the God of the mountain. He's still God in the valley. When things go wrong, he'll make it right.

[applause] &gt;&gt; Well, what a privilege it is to be back in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Um, I just want to say that I'm very thankful to be here today by the grace of God. I want to thank all the saints, Pastor Danny, Sister Jennifer, Brother Simon, all the saints of God for all your prayers through this time. But uh I know that God's doing a great work. It's funny, when I first started um my testimony, I actually started writing it about 10 years ago. And God had me to end it at a certain point and put it away and said, "It's not time." So now he says it's time for me to share this with you and I pray it'll be a blessing to each and every one of you. [clears throat] I was born in July 1967 to Jim and Diane EMTT. I had three older brothers. My mom actually had two miscarriages after my three older brothers and she was told no more kids. So when she got pregnant for me, she said, "I'm keeping it. I don't care what I have to go through." Um, she got very sick during the pregnancy. Um, I was born premature. I was born um with a very gastric ill stomach. I could not keep food down. Um, I had to be put in intensive care for a month. And lo and behold, as uh brother Tim and I connected, we actually connected back then because eight days later, Brother Tim Beers was born almost dying that that night from uh fluid on his lungs and he was put in the same intensive care as me. I you know when we share that story everybody's like it's just the grace of God that started our journey way back then. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that. &gt;&gt; Um three years later. So I lived on a street tim and I at the time lived in separate areas of Toronto. Three years later, after we were born in the same hospital, his family moved on my street, right across from me, and that's where it all began. [laughter] Um, a pinnacle part of my journey was an incident that happened to me, excuse [clears throat] me, my throat's very dry, when I was 14 years old. Um, it was a day in October 1981. I had some friends that I hung out with. I w wasn't close close with them, but I hung out with them periodically. On that particular morning of this particular day, one of the friends got into a fight with um one of the neighbors wives over the a dog that they had because she wasn't looking after the dog properly and so forth. So that same night, myself and two other friends were standing in front of uh one of our friends buildings and I actually So I'm facing my friend's building and this is the street and it went all the way down to the lake. And as I was standing there, I sensed a person that came out. And I turned and I looked and I saw it was the husband of that wife that had the argument with my friend earlier that day. Instantly, a voice spoke to me and said, "Turn around." Within seconds, I was on the ground. I was shot with two bullets. One is a quarter of an inch from my spine and one in my buttocks and they're still in my body today. By the grace of God, I should have been finished. But because that voice that he spoke that day to ask me and told me to turn, it would have been fatal. But God had a plan &gt;&gt; to go forward in our lives. [applause] &gt;&gt; I was actually p physically paralyzed because when I was on the ground, I couldn't move. And it wasn't until I got to the hospital and things sorted out and God gave me back my feeling in my legs. Um, he actually got me to a place where I just wanted to get out. I wanted to move on with life. It was a tragedy, but there was something inside of me that just wanted to press forth and do well and and not stay in a, you know, because tragedies like that can cause somebody to go into a bad sit situation, fear and depression and and so forth. But by the grace of God, I was back to school in two months. I caught up on all my schoolwork. I I was successful in school and he just he just helped me along the way. Now, to that part of it, God used it as well because brother Tim heard on the radio the next morning that I actually had died. and he said something in his heart just changed towards me. We weren't close friends at that time. Anyway, he found out the truth that I was in the hospital. I did survive and he came with me to the trial because there was a trial and so forth. And he was there with me through the whole thing. And it was from then that God started to bring a friendship between us. And then gradually we got married. We got married in February of 1989. We have three children, Adam, Naomi, and Caleb. [clears throat] As most of you may know, Brother Tim's testimony about his suffering from anxiety and depression due to a head injury that he suffered uh at work. Um I had to live um with him in that state for about three and a half years before that God called us. But in that time all I knew I didn't know I didn't go to church. I wasn't religious. But I said I believe there's a living God. That's all that came in my heart &gt;&gt; every single night. Without fail, &gt;&gt; I said, "God, heal my husband." &gt;&gt; I cried out for three and a half years. &gt;&gt; And then it all changed. In January of 1991, Brother Tim's natural brother Paul Beers worked at Campbell Soup and he was witnessed to by brother Mike Brennan, Brother Gee Clement. Paul came home from work that day and sat down with brother Tim. He goes, "You know, I was talking to these brothers today and they're talking about God and faith and the Bible and this and that." He goes, "But there's one thing that they said." He said, they talked about Acts 2:38 that you need to repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Instantly, there was an awakening within Brother Tim's heart. that he never felt. He didn't feel a lot during those three and a half years, but there was an awakening that took place. That was a pinnacle moment in both of our lives. So, he attended a Wednesday night service on Weston Road in Toronto. I lived with him and I saw his condition. I saw the countenance on his face every day. So him and his brother went to the service. I stayed home. He got home from that service. He opened the door and I said, "What happened to you?" He said, "What do you mean?" I said, "There's a light all all around your face, all around you, there's a light. What happened? And I for the first time I saw that darkness leave his face. [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I said, Lord, I looked at him and I said, I'm going next time [laughter] because this is our answer of all the years. I remember walking up the stairs to the upper room where we had our services on the Wednesday nights and all that drew me was the music. The just the music was just so peaceful that I haven't felt in a long time. I got up the stairs. We sat down. And I remember looking at the keyboardist. It was Sister Trudy at the time. That same light that was on Brother Tim's face was on her face. And I said, "Lord, I want I want that same light. I want that same experience. I just you become desperate and then God comes and answers. &gt;&gt; I remember the word that came forth from our former pastor that night and it was just life and all I felt was life for the first time in so long. &gt;&gt; And it was just a supernatural experience for both of us. He just called us and from that point on he's done a mighty work in both of our lives and he continues to do a mighty work in both of our lives. We, you know, you come to that place and you don't realize that he has a great work for you to do. and and as you continue to walk and you grow and he continues to just bless you and and it just it was it's just been yeah a lot of valleys and ups and downs but you know what I wouldn't change it for a thing because he draws us closer every time. Uh we were both baptized that same year 198 1991 on April 12th. From that moment on, it was a dramatic change in both of our lives. I just started walking with the Lord on my own. I just saw God delivering my husband, but I just started walking and seeking him on my own for my own deliverance. And I we I experienced something that I know Abraham when when God said,"Abraham, just pack up, leave this land and follow me." I experienced that so strong because what I came from and what I experienced with what I went through in our early years of our marriage and and this was life to me. He became life to me and I didn't know anything else but to just surrender my life more and more to him. The other thing I forgot to mention is during that three and a half years of me praying for for Tim, I had something in my heart so strong that, you know, some women might have it hard and they might want to leave. I'm just being honest with you. But there was a supernatural strength inside of me that said, "I ain't moving. I ain't leaving until I see my husband delivered." [applause] And that was I know that was God back then &gt;&gt; because it was not a very easy road for those for those times. Um during um my birth, as I said, when I was sick, I was born with many things and one of them being, as I said, the gastric stomach. So, as we're starting to walk with the Lord, I'm just walking and feeding and and just not paying attention. And one morning, I woke up and I I my stomach felt different. &gt;&gt; I said, "Wow, that's odd." I usually had pain every night and gas and pain. I suffered with it since I was born. Lo and behold, it was gone from that day. [applause] &gt;&gt; God, he supernaturally just took it from me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I just kept walking and it just it just increased my faith and I just kept walking and walking and believing him. Well, through all of these events that I've been through and I'm still going through, but I know that these are all part of the great plan that he has for me. [applause] &gt;&gt; He's he's blessed me with many things. My husband, my children, my family, the wonderful family of God. Um he's given me a a wonderful job that he gave me over the years. And and I know this past m this past month hasn't been easy for me in this struggle that I'm going through in my health, but I know that God's doing something good once again in my life. &gt;&gt; So, I'm just looking to see the victory at the end of this because I know that it's just going to get better. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an honor and a privilege and humbly to serve him and walk in his glorious walk. I've been through the water. &gt;&gt; I've been through the flood. I've been through the fire. &gt;&gt; But it's been all through the blood. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.

Amen. Praise [music] God. God bless you. Um musicians, you all may be seated. Amen. And I want to welcome every single one of you um here this evening into the uh house of the Lord. You can put up the first slide. Amen. I want to welcome everybody um friends and family um visitors. God bless you. Thank you for joining us this evening. You could have been out, you know, at a big party right now and you'd have probably been already half cked, you know, if you're back in the world. You you'd have been uh, you know, trying to get to midnight and by the time you get to midnight, you get that last shot of champagne and then you don't remember anything. &gt;&gt; But here, you couldn't have been listen, you don't realize how blessed you are to be here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the grace of God that led you here tonight. You're not here by accident. &gt;&gt; You're you're here by the grace of God. And there's no greater um thing that that that we could possibly be doing. You know, I want to thank God for all the young people that that came up and sang for us this evening and all all the singers. Sister Sheila, that was such a a tremendous blessing. And when you know the life that's behind it, you know the the the the trial that's been, you know, that that that's behind it. And when somebody comes and they sing and that experience comes through the song. Amen. And and that's what that's what God uses. That's what that's how you know God is in the midst. Amen. That's how you know that uh uh it it's supernatural when a life is transformed and delivered. Amen. And so you being here tonight is a great victory. &gt;&gt; You know, this is a reality. This is this is the living God. You're you're in this building here tonight and you wonder, you know, don't take it lightly. You're here and God is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is here.

And so, um, I'm very very thankful tonight to be here with you and, um, I was very blessed by all the songs and the worship. Uh, Amen. Thank you for all your testimonies. Um, they will certainly live in the hearts of the people um, and remember this night. Praise God. Let's go to the word of God. I've got a short thought. um few scriptures that I'd like to talk to you about um here as we leave 2025 behind. Amen. Let's look at uh Joshua chapter 14. Um we're going to read a few verses. Amen. Before we do that, let's just ask the Lord to bless. Father, won't you take your word now, Lord, as we exit 2025? We want to we want to enter 2026 with a word of victory in our hearts, with a a testimony, oh God, that 2025 was was a stepping stone. And now as we move into 2026, Lord, all we want to know is your leadership, your guidance, your vision, the vision that you have placed and given to this ministry that started many, many, many years ago. Father, Lord, you started this ministry. You will take us right through and into the rapture. That is what we believe. And this is the word that we are feeding on in this day and in this hour. It's the rapture message word of God for this day. May you just bless us now as we read your word. Inspire our hearts. We love you. We appreciate you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Joshua chapter 14 from verse 6 it says then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal and Caleb the son of Japun the Kennesite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh Barnea. 40 years old was I when Moses, the servant of the Lord, sent me from Kadesh Barnea to aspy out the land, and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart. Next slide. Nevertheless, my brethren, that went up with me made the heart of the people melt, but I wholly followed the Lord my God. Nevertheless, my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt. But I wholly followed the Lord my God. And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trotten shall be thine inheritance, and thy childrens forever, because thou has wholly followed the Lord my God. &gt;&gt; Next slide. And now, behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he said, these 40 and five years, ever since the Lord spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness. And now, lo, I am this day four score and five years old. He's 85 years old. As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me. &gt;&gt; As my strength was then, even so is my strength now &gt;&gt; for war both to go out and to come in. &gt;&gt; And he goes on and he says next slide. How therefore give me this mountain &gt;&gt; whereof the Lord spake in that day that thou that thou heardest in that day how the Anakans were there and that the cities were great and fenced. If so be the Lord will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out &gt;&gt; as the Lord said. And Joshua blessed him &gt;&gt; and gave unto Caleb the son of Japun Hebron &gt;&gt; for an inheritance. &gt;&gt; The Lord add his blessings to the word of God. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Today I want to talk to you and I want to title this. Go to the next slide. Give me my mountain &gt;&gt; 2025. is over. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But I am as strong today as I was when I started this race. &gt;&gt; And I'm not afraid to enter 2026. And I want to go into 2026 with one attitude, with one vision, with one thought. Give me my mountain. &gt;&gt; Give me my possession. Give me my portion. Whatever portion of the word that you've ordained for me from before the foundations of the world, this is not a church where you just join today. This is where you come and you hear the word of the Lord telling you that you were with him before the foundations of the world, but it's now your time to take your part in the word of God. &gt;&gt; It's now your time to take your mountain. You know, Sister Jennifer and I have come to these watch services for many years. This is, you know, the 31st year that we've been serving the Lord. And we've come to many of these watch services. And we all look back at the many trials. And you know, every time that we would come to the watch service, I I remember I' I'd be so excited because I wanted to hear what the Lord was going to do for us as we enter into the next year. And every year we thought would be the last year &gt;&gt; and we'd be listening to the Lord to, you know, to because God was so real in our experience. And let me tell you, he's just as real and more real to me today and I know to you that that have experienced him. Amen. He's more real to me today than he's ever been. &gt;&gt; Why? Because his word keeps unveiling itself. &gt;&gt; He keeps revealing himself &gt;&gt; to me. not not uh you know showing me you know religious doctrines and no I'm talking about an experience where you've you're walking with God. &gt;&gt; It's a reality &gt;&gt; and you're getting stronger in the Lord because you know the promises of God. &gt;&gt; You know back in Numbers chapter 13, we're talking about Caleb today. Amen. And you know that you're a type of Caleb. Amen. &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb, Christ and the bride. Amen. He was under that leadership. Caleb goes to Joshua says, "Give me my portion of the land." Amen. And that's and and and we're and we're in that relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ in this hour. Amen. And but here back in Numbers 13 verse 22 to 24, I just got it written here. He says, "Because all those men which have seen my now here's um uh the scripture verse 22 because all those men which have seen my glory and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me," this is the Lord speaking now these 10 times and have not hearkened to my voice. There's people that that that they they just don't they can't hear the word of God. They rebel against the word of God. But I want you to notice something about Caleb. Amen. Surely they see surely they shall not see the land which I swear unto their fathers. Neither shall any of them that provoke me see it. Okay? They didn't believe God. They didn't believe that God that God's prophet Moses what everything that he said God was going to do. &gt;&gt; When God told Moses, "I'm going to give you the land." God meant what he said. &gt;&gt; And when God sent us a prophet in the 20th century to tell us that he's going TO GIVE US BACK our land, that he's going to restore our hearts back to the word, there was people that that that didn't accept it. But listen here. He says, he says, "But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him." &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Let me tell you, if you can recognize this word for this hour, it's because you've got a different spirit in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Him will I bring into the land where where where into he went, and his seed shall possess it. That's God's promise &gt;&gt; because Caleb was was of a different spirit. Caleb Caleb followed the Lord holy. &gt;&gt; He fully believed what God said. When those spies went into uh you know Jericho and they seen all those giants, all they could see was the giants. But Caleb heard what the Lord had told Moses. He said, "I'm going to give you that land. That's your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN STOP YOU from receiving WHAT GOD SAYS YOU ARE to become and you are to possess. &gt;&gt; You may not have fully possessed it in 2025, but you can you can be assured if you stay holy &gt;&gt; and believing unto the Lord, he's going to make it happen. HE'S GOING TO GIVE YOU THAT MOUNTAIN. AMEN. Caleb did not ask for the easy mountain. It was Hebron. &gt;&gt; Hebron was was the one that that where all the giants were. &gt;&gt; Listen, you might enter into 2026 facing some some definite giants. &gt;&gt; But don't look at the giants. &gt;&gt; You you you you let the giants know I'm as strong today. I'm stronger today than I ever was because of what God has put in me by the word of God of this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord knew what kind of spirit was in Caleb. &gt;&gt; That's why he called him. That's why he says, "You're going to get your possession." Amen. He knew he would have to face the end time. He knew that he would have to face the fullness of iniquity. He knew that he would have to face the the the the great giants, that he would have to overcome those giants. But he knew that God was with him. Amen. It was a test of faith and going into 2026 will be a test of your faith &gt;&gt; to accomplish everything that God promised you. &gt;&gt; Everything that he's shown you in the word that you are, you will have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't want to believe any evil reports. We don't want to be distracted by the evil reports that are that are being spoken &gt;&gt; even in the midst of this message. We're not interested in the evil reports. We're we're we're we're interested in the true report. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We're not interested in the in in being identified with the evil reports because what does an evil report do? It weakens you. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you listen to the devil, you listen to the lies, you listen to to uh you know, all the different interpretations, you listen to the word of God, &gt;&gt; you stay loyal to the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; You let the Holy Ghost that led you here lead you the rest of the way. Amen. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; God sees differently than we do. &gt;&gt; True. you see, you know, giants sometimes, cancer or heart failure or OR DIABETES OR BUT GOD doesn't see it in that way. In the book of Isaiah 40 verse 21-23, he says, "Have ye not known? Have ye not heard? Hath it not being told you from the beginning? Have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? It is he that siteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers. &gt;&gt; Those cancers, THOSE HEART SITUATIONS, YEAH, THEY'RE REAL. &gt;&gt; BUT ARE YOU GOING to are you going to believe the doctor's report? Are you going to believe the true report? &gt;&gt; You can't leave here unless God says you're coming home. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can stop you from accomplishing what God purposed in you &gt;&gt; from before the foundations of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. THAT STRETCHETH OUT THE HEAVENS as a curtain, and spreadth them out as a tent to dwell in. That bringeth the princes to nothing. He maketh the judges of the earth as vanity. We don't need to look at the giants. We don't need to be afraid of any giants. &gt;&gt; We're going to move into 2026 with one thing, and that is I believe God. &gt;&gt; I believe what he says about me is going to come to pass. &gt;&gt; I believe every promise in the book is mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not going to let fear rob me from my mountain. &gt;&gt; No, sir. Fear is false evidence. It appears real, but it's false. &gt;&gt; Amen. Caleb had spiritual strength. There's a big difference. There's Listen, there might have been a lot of people that were stronger than Caleb. He was 85 years old, but his strength was not so much physical. It was spiritual strength. &gt;&gt; And one man with God is supernatural. &gt;&gt; I don't care how weak, you know. Oh, brother, I'm getting older. I'm feeling weaker. Listen, that's fine. Your body might get weaker, but God didn't get any weaker. &gt;&gt; His power is yet the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost, he he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Your strength is spiritual strength. &gt;&gt; Your strength is in the word of God. Amen. At 85, there would there would have been many that were stronger, but he had a strength believing God. Caleb was not afraid of adversity. Why? Because he believed God. &gt;&gt; We're going into 2026 believing God is going to accomplish what he started in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even you even you young people go back and read Jeremiah 1 6 to7 and he he told the young people that they could be victorious. &gt;&gt; Amen. Does God doesn't look at age. &gt;&gt; Yes. God's not interested in looking at young. God's not interested in looking at old. God's interested in knowing whether you're going to believe his word &gt;&gt; and what he said he's going to do for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Caleb was of a different spirit. He looked back over the 40 years of the many children of Israel that were falling in the wilderness. But he had a promise that was still in his heart. He was still looking at that mountain. He still had his eyes on that mountain regardless of those that were falling to his left or falling to his right. &gt;&gt; It didn't matter. Listen, there's going to be people that are going to come into this church and there's going to be people that are going to leave the church. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't change the plan of God and the purpose of God. And if you are anchored by the revelation of God's word, you're not going anywhere. &gt;&gt; You're listening for his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Not every person will overcome. And we need to understand that. &gt;&gt; God adds to the church such as should be saved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. But he's still Hebrews 12 verses 1 to2. Author and the finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; So what do we got to do for 2026? We need to keep our eyes on the finish line. We need to keep our eyes on the promises of God. &gt;&gt; We need to look at 2026 in a different way. Amen. Glory to God. Let's go to um uh our next slide here. Revelations 2 17 says, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcomemeth will I give to eat of the hidden mana, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name, which no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it. &gt;&gt; Listen, you are going to have to overcome. As long as you are here, &gt;&gt; you're going to have to overcome. And you need to understand the day that you're living in. &gt;&gt; You need to understand the word that's been ordained to your age. &gt;&gt; And this is the capstone age. &gt;&gt; This is the age where Christ comes down to meet with his body. &gt;&gt; And you recognizing that can only happen by spiritual revelation. It's not going to come to you by knowledge. &gt;&gt; That's why overcoming in this hour gives you the ability to receive revelation to overcome. As you overcome, revelation comes because God has started a work in your life that he's going to finish. &gt;&gt; That's why the scripture says to him that overcomemeth will I give to eat the hidden mana. What is the hidden mana? It's the revelation of his word. &gt;&gt; It's what he is going to do in you. Hallelujah. And it's a and and and when brother Brandham, you know, you you may be you might remember when brother Brandham uh you know had uh brother Junior Jackson come to him about the dream that he had about you know they were at the top of this mountain and and there was a there was a big rock and and brother Brandham was standing and they were all looking over into that white rock but there was nothing written in the white shock. &gt;&gt; But brother Brham was was ordained to bring the revelation of what was in that white rock &gt;&gt; to the children of God &gt;&gt; in this day and in this hour. &gt;&gt; And that rock, that white stone is your mountain, &gt;&gt; is your portion of the word. It's who you are in this day and in this hour. &gt;&gt; Listen here. He goes on, read the quote here. He says in the Pergamian church age, it also says here that he is going to give the overcomer a white stone and in not on but the stone a new name &gt;&gt; which the owner alone knows. &gt;&gt; Amen. The reason why you are an overcomer and the reason why you can overcome whatever you're going to face in 2026 is because you were written in the lamb's book of life. Your name was placed there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when that stone on the top of the mountain, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; when &gt;&gt; the top was taken off and the mighty angel came down in 1963, he was coming to call the names that were written in those stones, &gt;&gt; IN THAT WHITE STONE. AMEN. THAT'S WHAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S THUNDERING OUT RIGHT NOW. That's the word that you're receiving right now. That's why that's what identifies this church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what makes us who we are &gt;&gt; and who you are &gt;&gt; is because your name is written on a stone. And the stone is the revelation of God's word. &gt;&gt; And you're one of those stones that was placed into the capstone. You're one of the ones that has to receive your portion of the mountain. &gt;&gt; You're one of the ones that that that by revelation, you're going to come to know who you are. &gt;&gt; And you're going to recognize this message because your name is being called through the word that's being now ministered through the capstone ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now listen, he goes on. He says, "Now the idea of a new name is a familiar one. Abraham was changed or Abram was changed to Abraham." Notice the change of name. God has a purpose when he calls your real name. Your real name is under the message of this hour. &gt;&gt; That's where your strength lies under the message of this hour. It's not under a uh you know denominational teaching message that's never going to call you. That's never going to give you the overcoming power that you need to be victorious as a son or a daughter of God in this day or this hour. You're going to need the revelation that was that was under those seven seals that are being revealed now &gt;&gt; in these last days by the preaching of the word. And he goes on to say here, he says, "Now Abram was changed to Abraham, Sarai to Sarah, Jacob to Israel, Simon to Peter, and Saul to Paul." These names either brought about a change or were given because of a change. It it was only after Abram and Sarai had their names changed by the Lord that they were made ready to receive the coming son. Until you've heard your name &gt;&gt; under the message of this hour &gt;&gt; through the opening of the seven seals, you are just a churchgoer. &gt;&gt; You're not identified as a son of God. &gt;&gt; You're not identified as a daughter of God. only by the revelation of you hearing and recognizing what God is doing in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What God has already done in sending us a prophet to the 20th century. &gt;&gt; You cannot leave out William Brham in your experience. You need to recognize what God has done through William Miriam Branham &gt;&gt; because the word that's been coming forth is the word that was sealed up in the white stone. &gt;&gt; It was the unwritten part of the word. It was the element that that Satan would not be able to impersonate &gt;&gt; all THE OTHER LISTEN EVERYTHING ELSE OUT THERE THAT YOU KNOW ALL THESE DIFFERENT denominational teachings and you know it's all impersonations &gt;&gt; taking the word of God and making it of none effect to the people &gt;&gt; but when the real true revelation comes into the heart of a son or a daughter of God they can never be the same. &gt;&gt; Their name has been called &gt;&gt; and they go through a change. &gt;&gt; Abraham, right after his name was changed from Abram to Abraham AND SARAI TO SARAH, they were now in a position to receive the coming son. &gt;&gt; And until your name has been changed by hearing this word, this message, this revelation, hallelujah. Let's read on. In Jacob's case, next slide, he had to overcome and then he was called a prince. In the case of Simon and Saul, when they had received the Lord, their change came. And today, each one of us true believers has had a change in name. You may not have changed your natural name, but to your friends and your family, when you receive the new birth under this revelation, you're not the same person. You might as well have a different name. &gt;&gt; They don't I had people coming to me says, "Who are you? You're not the Danny that we knew." &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was a new birth. Amen. &gt;&gt; The old has passed away. &gt;&gt; And that experience has to be a reality to every single one of us if we're going to enter 2026 with any kind of strength &gt;&gt; and and and have the same testimony as Caleb. Amen. He says here, he goes on, we are Christians. It is a name common to all of us, but one day we will have another change. We will of certainty receive a new name. It could well be the name was our true and original name written in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; You see, that's what you're hearing in this message. That's what you're hearing when you're when when when you identify yourself with this ministry, this end time ministry. Oh, people talking that God sent a prophet and opening of seven seals and uh you know revelation of the seven church ages and the church history. Yes. All of those things were the elements of the mysteries that were under those seven seals. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the prophet was told to go to Jeffersonville because those seven seals were going to be open and he preached those seven nights in a row, God was unveiling and opening all the mysteries that the world they were they were talking about it, but they were confused in the Godhead. They were confused about the white horse rider. All the things, all the symbols that were brought out by the opening of those those seals had to be fully interpreted by the opening of the &gt;&gt; part of the word that that has your name written on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. In it. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. THAT'S THE PART THAT HAS awakened you in this day and in this hour. And that's the element that's going to give you strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the only way that you're going to overcome in 2026, &gt;&gt; those that overcame in 2025 recognized their time, their season, &gt;&gt; and they're pressing on and they're moving on. &gt;&gt; They're moving on with the same God. &gt;&gt; The same one that's been feeding us all over the years going back to when when we come when we come under brother John Simon under that ministry. He's the same God that's still preaching to us today &gt;&gt; by revelation. &gt;&gt; Calling our names in the white stone. &gt;&gt; Our names were written in the lambs. But he knows the name but we do not. But one day at his good pleasure we will know also. &gt;&gt; We'll know exactly who we are. &gt;&gt; We'll be we'll we'll we'll we'll know as we are known. Amen. Praise God. But right now, all I know is that I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I am not a a a a churchgoer. &gt;&gt; I'm not a denominational uh Christian. &gt;&gt; I don't belong to to denominational church. I belong to the mystical body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are sons and daughters of God. We've been awakened. Our name has been called by the opening of the word. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Here in uh in let's go to the next slide as we close here. I just you know the the thought that I'm trying to bring out here tonight is that we are of the of the tribe of Caleb. &gt;&gt; We are of that understanding that revelation. Hebron. He was given Hebrron because Hebron was the mountain where Abraham that was the that was the the the the the the city that Abraham was looking for. It was the place where God gave him the promises and said, "Look at all the stars and all the all the ground that you it's all yours. It's all your inheritance." &gt;&gt; I want us to understand that we are not of this world. We are not of denominational teaching and understanding on the word of God. We're not uh you know uh just people that that that that are churchgoers. We are the word for this day and for this hour. &gt;&gt; We are the word being made flesh &gt;&gt; to to 2026. &gt;&gt; We are the ones that carry the word. He says he says whatever you bind on EARTH SHALL BE BOUND IN HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; Whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. We're the ones that have been given the open book &gt;&gt; TO TO TO PROPHESY again &gt;&gt; to take that word that was that was delivered unto us &gt;&gt; by the word of God through a vindicated prophet &gt;&gt; and we are now the the the voice of God in these last days. We're Caleb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're we're we're of that spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as we close here, I want I want you to pay attention here in this quote from 1962. It was December the 31st. And you need to understand William Brham at that time had been given the vision. Sir, is this the time? This was when he had been given the vision to go and open those seven seals &gt;&gt; that the that he would be the angel on earth and the mighty angel Christ himself was going to come down to open those seals. It wasn't William Brandham that opened the seals. &gt;&gt; Let me make that clear. &gt;&gt; He was the angel, the messenger, the voice, the vessel that the mighty angel was going to speak through. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. in order to open those seals and to release the mysteries that were under those seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then it was to be conveyed into a people &gt;&gt; that would recognize him and understand. That's why in Revelations 10:8 to 11, &gt;&gt; John was told to go and take the book. John is a type of the bride. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The mighty angel came down with the open book. &gt;&gt; It was the book that had been sealed and now it had been opened. &gt;&gt; He had come to redeem, to call the names of the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; And so here now he recognizes that something is going to take place. And he says, "Heavenly Father, as we stand here, as many thoughts is dying out in our hearts and of the mistakes of the last year, and as we're approaching the death of 1962, you can replace that with 2025." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the birth of 1963, &gt;&gt; you can replace that with 2026. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh God, may we be one step higher, the ladder until we can see Jesus and his program. &gt;&gt; May everyone here, Lord, in prayer while the old year is dying and the new birth of the new year is coming in. May the old man's sin and unbelief die out in our heart and the new birth &gt;&gt; come &gt;&gt; in with the 1963 like a rushing mighty wind. May 2026 come in like a mighty rushing wind &gt;&gt; into our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. A new birth like a mighty rushing wind that might fill our being and make us new creatures in Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you looking to to to to press on into 2026 &gt;&gt; and be victorious and have the same attitude that Caleb had? Give me my mountain. &gt;&gt; Give me my portion of the word. &gt;&gt; Give me my Give me my promise in the word of God. Listen, whatever whatever portion of the word you are, whatever part that you are under this ministry, &gt;&gt; this is our ministry. This is the portion where God has placed you. God has placed you here under this ministry. &gt;&gt; God has placed me here under this ministry. &gt;&gt; We're here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; We're here to fulfill God's plan and take this word wherever it needs to go so that we can be the voice to this last generation &gt;&gt; because there's there's there's one more out there that that that needs to come in. When the last one comes in, we go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he goes on and he he says here in the next slide, he says, "Make us fit servants." &gt;&gt; Forgive our past. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you got to let go of your past. &gt;&gt; You got to say, Lord, I I'm I'm leaving 2025 mistakes and problems and everything I did wrong. I'm leaving it in 2025 &gt;&gt; and I'm moving on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord God, with thy mighty hand Jehovah, bless these ministers here. &gt;&gt; Bless all the leoty, all the visitors. Be thou with us, Lord. We are your servants. &gt;&gt; And we give ourselves holy to you for 2026. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that the power of your spirit might have more preeminence &gt;&gt; in our life &gt;&gt; and in our being. &gt;&gt; Help us &gt;&gt; help us, God. Forgive us. &gt;&gt; Uh and help us, WE PRAY. RAISE UP mighty men. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You young men in here, listen. God's going to use you. &gt;&gt; There's a reason why you're here. &gt;&gt; There's a reason why you're hearing this message. There's a reason why it thunders in your heart. &gt;&gt; It's because you're you there's a portion OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT'S YOURS and you need to say, "Give me my mountain. &gt;&gt; Give me my part of the word." Amen. Glory to God. Raise up mighty men. Raise up mighty warriors &gt;&gt; of the faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Warriors of the revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Warriors that are going to take this message &gt;&gt; and and they're going to have courage to stand with this word to move on with the revelation of this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To allow the word to come and and and mold and shape us and and and deal with us. If you are one of those stones, you got to be shaped. You got to be uh you know uh molded. You've got to let the the the the stonemason work things out in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And where does it start? Right here in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let 2026 be a year that I'm going to be in the house of the Lord whenever I can be there. &gt;&gt; Because that's where I can receive strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the word of God. &gt;&gt; I believe in the five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stand with the five-fold ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to believe that that God, he's he's he's alive. He's he's with his people. He's he he's dealing with with us on a daily basis. We're not we're not going to be playing church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to go into 2026 &gt;&gt; differently. And he says here, "Open this year, Lord, that hidden mana, that rock beneath the rock, &gt;&gt; that we might see the program of God." &gt;&gt; Are you interested in the program of God? &gt;&gt; You want to know what God's going to Listen, he's not stopped. A lot of people want to just say, "Oh, you just need to press play and obey. Just just say what the tapes say. just play the tapes in your church. Uh that you don't really need, you know, if the pastor is going to come up, he just needs to comment on what's already been said. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. That's not what he says here. He says, "Lord, open up this year, Lord, that hidden mana, &gt;&gt; that rock beneath the rock that we might see the program of God." HE SAYS, "CAP CAP OFF THE PYRAMIDS in our life." There's a part of you THAT FITS INTO THAT MOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; And you need to find out what part of that mountain you are. &gt;&gt; You're not a parrot. &gt;&gt; You're a son of God. &gt;&gt; You're a daughter of God. You've been given the word Christ. HE SAYS, "CAP OFF THE THE pyramids of our life, Lord. Put the capstone Christ Jesus upon each and every one of us. It wasn't only on the prophet. It's to come on every single one of us. May his great, magnificent, holy blessings be upon us. May the fire of the Holy Ghost come upon us. May the power of the resurrection be manifested. How's he going to how's the the the the power of the Holy Ghost going to be manifested? BY LIVING THROUGH YOUR LIFE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BY YOU RECOGNIZING YOUR THAT YOU'RE A part of the word and that you have the word and that you're the voice of God in these last days. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. May the power of the resurrection be manifested. God, how we thank you tonight. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We are yours. &gt;&gt; We give ourselves fully &gt;&gt; to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Is that your desire tonight? Are you willing to give yourself fully &gt;&gt; to him? Let the brothers come. We're going to change the order of the service. We're going to go into the Lord's supper at this time. I pray that this 2026 &gt;&gt; will be such a victory year for each and every one of you personally. &gt;&gt; This is a personal walk. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a personal revelation. &gt;&gt; Everything about this message. Just just, you know, go back on your on your experiences. Listen to what sister Deborah was saying there. She said that she saw a light on her husband that she had not seen ever before for the first time. What was that light? It was the word coming to an attribute of God, coming to a son of God, coming to a daughter of God at an appointed time. And the evidence that they are son and daughter of God is that they're here. &gt;&gt; They're here and THEY'VE GOT THE SAME TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; YES, THE BATTLES HAVE BEEN GREAT, BUT LIKE CALEB, I'M STRONGER NOW THAN I EVER WAS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE I'M STRONGER IN THE LORD. I've seen the victories of God. I've seen him oh, deal with my battles. Yes, the battles HAVE BEEN GREAT, BUT HE HAS given me victory every time. &gt;&gt; That's a birth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's the revelation of Christianity. That's what being a a a part of the body of Christ is all about. That's what going to church is all about. not about traditions of man. &gt;&gt; They've made the word of God by their traditions of none effect to the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let the brothers come. Amen. This time we're going to change the order of the service. We're going to we're going to go into 2026. We're going to have the Lord's supper. We're going to take some time to examine ourselves. We're going to think about what the Lord is telling us here tonight. That you're of a different spirit. I've given you Hebron. I've given you the promised land. That's what Hebron represented was God's favor. It was God's favor &gt;&gt; and you are God's favor &gt;&gt; and he's given you your portion of the land. &gt;&gt; Says, "I give it to you, but he said, "Give it to me." He had the spirit on him. He had that desire to move forward with the Lord. Amen. Praise God. Let's read our scripture. in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 [snorts] from verse 23. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you. that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." Brother Christopher, would you take the bread and give thanks? It's okay, brother. You can you can just pray. Lord, this bread [snorts] in my hands, Lord, Father, which represents your broken body, Lord, Father, broken for us, Lord. Lord, as we partake of it, may it bring healing. May it bring deliverance. May it bring strength, Lord, strength for the journey, dear father. Lord, bless it, Lord. May you sanctify it, Lord, to our bodies, Lord, with thanksgiving in our hearts in Jesus name. Amen. After the same manner also he took the cup, and when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me." Brother Phillip, would you give thanks for the wine? Oh our heavenly most gracious eternal God so grateful to be partakers of this because if you not do it not have part in you but your grace has brought us to be partakers of it. Father as we drink the wine that represent the Holy Ghost. Father, may that Holy Ghost go through every part of our being, our conscious, subconscious, every part and do what it's supposed to do in our lives because you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. Bless it, Father, as we partake it in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The next slide says in verse 27-31, "Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. We need to understand here that it's important to examine ourselves. We want to leave 2025 behind. We want a fresh start. And here we have an opportunity to examine our hearts and examine our lives and maybe make some re renew some covenants with the Lord because he's made an unconditional covenant with you. His righteousness has been placed on you. So it's not your own righteousness that's going to do it. It's his righteousness. He by the shedding of his blood and by the giving of his life died for your sins. And by you accepting that your sin is washed away, never to be remembered. Never to be brought up. If you truly believe that, then when you go into your examination, you will reconcile with the Lord. Everything can be made right. Everything can be restored. Everything can be made whole if you truly believe in what he said that he would do. So, let us all bow our heads and take a couple minutes right now and examine ourselves before the Lord. Amen. This time I'm going to ask the brothers to go let their other deacons take the other ends and distribute the wine and the bread and then just hold the bread and hold the wine and we will all partake of it together. Continue to pray. Continue to search your hearts. Continue to think about the things that you've let go that you're leaving behind. Think of them for the last time. Those mistakes, leave them in 2025. Don't carry anything with you into 2026 that's not going to take you closer to God. Let go of those some things you may have to let go. You may have to let go of certain bad company. you young people, maybe you got to let go of some, you know, influences in your life at school. Not saying you gotta, you know, reject them and and, you know, to but separate from the unbelief. Don't be partakers. Be an example when they're using all that foul language. You don't need to be using that language. It defiles you. separate from it. Be different. We're a lot closer than you think. Believe for that new job. Believe for that new opportunity. Believe that God in 2026 is going to open the windows of heaven because of your faithfulness in paying your tithes and paying in giving of your offerings. Be under expectation that God is going to God is going to pour out his promises. He cannot fail to fulfill his word. It's unconditional. But it requires our faith. It requires us to believe what he's revealed to us and allow it to live through our lives. Believe the promises. Believe for that new job. Believe for that that better health. You know, if it means you got to start doing some regular exercise, you're not going to get healthier by just doing nothing. But say, "Lord, give me the confidence. Give me the courage. give me the enthusiasm and the passion to to do that extra exercise on a on a regular basis that's going to make me feel better. Maybe you got to let go of certain bad eating habits. You don't want to carry them into 2026. Say, "Lord, help me with my with my eating habits." Amen. simple things, but he's mindful and and that's all a part of your promises. It's all a part of your mountain. Glory to God. I see a lot of things in 2025 that I could have done better, but I'm glad that I can see those things and I'm glad that I can use them as stepping stones. And that's what we need to look at, you know, our failures. And we're all going to have them, our mistakes. We're all going to make them, but use them as stepping stones. Is there anybody else? Okay, perfect. So at this time Jesus said, "Do this in remembrance of me." Remember what this represents. It's not his literal body. This is not his literal blood. But remember the promises of God. This represents his word. And you you're remembering now to take that word and apply that word in your life. It represents the word of God. Amen. So when you take it, understand it as as I feed on the word of God every day of my life and I'm led by the spirit of God every day of my life because when he gave up the ghost, it was so that the Holy Ghost could come back on me. And that's what it represents. So let us partake of the bread with thanksgiving in our hearts. As you're taking in the word, remember the word is your healing. The word is your deliverance. The word is your forgiveness. I'm remembering that when he went to the cross, he took all of my unbelief to the cross. That's why I'm remembering and partaking of this supper here tonight. And now as you're drinking this wine, take it as the revelation and the stimulation of his word and the effect that it's had in your life and has called you out of this world and has made you the person that you are today and know that you can enter 2026 under the leadership of his spirit. Let us partake of his wine representing the stimulation of revelation. Let the musicians come. Come ahead, Brother Mike. Let's sing a few songs as we we've got about uh 17 minutes before we go into the new year. Let's do a song. Then we're going to give Brother Tim an opportunity to come and say a few words. Amen. He had to work tonight, but by the grace of God, he's here and he was able to make it for the Lord's supper. And we wanted to hear from all the deacons. We still got about 16 minutes, so I'm going to let him take about seven minutes. Okay? And then and then I want to hear from our former pastor. &gt;&gt; And I want him to come and say a few words. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. We're we're the family of God here today. Amen. One song, Brother Mike. Give us one quick song. Brother Tim, come on up and prepare yourself. Amen. [music] Praise God. At the cross, [music and singing] at the cross, where I first saw the light and the [music] burning of my [singing] heart rolled away. [music] He was there by [singing] faith. I receive my [music] side. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I send [singing] my Sior [music] and my sold [music] [singing] [music] for such as [singing] Oh, [music] at the cross. And the cross where I sle [singing and music] [music] I receive my son. [music] Was [music] it for Christ? Was it for Christ? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; He grow up tree.

[music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I receive I am [music] happy. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated. I got seven minutes. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Anyways, it's good to be here tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was expected to be here from the beginning and I got called out emergency services for the roads and if you're going that way, you're you're okay. I got the roads. Okay. Hallelujah. I had a little thought on my heart that I prepared something, but uh didn't work out. We're just going to make it uh probably a sermon later on. But um you know first of all I want to thank each and every one of you that um this year has been there's been a lot of things happening this year a lot of challenges and um but you know one thing I I I realize that's very important uh when you go through some challenges is the prayers of the saints. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I just have a a different appreciation. You know, when I hear a prayer request come through or I hear somebody's in desperation, I don't care what I'm doing. I stop and I get right into prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because [clears throat] I know how important it is, you know, when I need it. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I need it. and we've gone through some times and my wife has gone through some times and we both have and and uh it's just we just appreciate it with all our hearts. Amen. So, don't stop praying one for another. &gt;&gt; The Bible commands us to pray one for another. We don't realize how powerful it is, but I know when you break into the spirit, it doesn't have to be all night prayer meeting. Just break into the spirit and and uh reach out for one another. Amen. But I had a little thought on my heart there about um looking back. Remember Lot's wife. Don't look back. I mean, it doesn't say much about Lot's wife when it when it reminds us of what she did. And she did one thing that that is very, you know, uh stands out in the scriptures. Don't look back. And I'm I was looking at myself and I I was looking at things, you know, 34 years walking with the Lord and and God dealing with so many things. And you know, if like in the high calling, if you truly been really called to be like Jesus Christ in all your spirit, I'm not just talking about playing church or being a message believer, but being a real son and daughter of God, God real deep down inside because he knows our very thoughts in our hearts. And when you become conscious of that, you realize that some of the things that you're still looking back on in your life. And I was looking back and I was, you know, I had good times and I had really bad times growing up, really tough times growing up. But I, you know, I I look back, I was brought up in the 70s and the 80s and with the music, which is I think was a lot better back then than it is today. But um you know and and they're connected they're connected with feelings, they're connected with emotions, they're connected with experiences, right? And sometimes we don't realize that we still connected to those things and the Holy Ghost is telling us don't look back at those things. Sometimes we we you know I I'm just talking about myself. You know I'm looking back at some of those things and I'm holding on to those things as good memories or good feelings or good things and that. But in order for me to go forward, in order for me to overcome, I realize what the Lord was speaking to me. I have to let go of everything. And I said, Lord, let go of everything. I mean, he's taken the bride of Jesus Christ, and I can only speak for myself, and I know for the rest of the bride of Jesus Christ, he's taken us to areas of our lives to surrender and to die out. I can't do it. I can't do it. I try to I try to put it on for many years. I try to do certain things for many years, but I can't do it. But he's doing it now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He got me to a place where he's doing it now. And all he does is he comes to you and he reveals these things to you to let them go. Whatever stage that you're at, you're not might be at my stage or somebody else's stage where God is really dealing with the depths of your spirit and what's in there and what's been placed in there through your life and experiences. But whatever area that you're in that he's speaking to, just let it go and let God have its way. And don't look back anymore. Don't look back because you can't press forward like Paul says,"I press towards the mark of the high calling which is in Christ Jesus." Amen. We have to constantly in our spirits be pressing forward &gt;&gt; to what high calling God has given us. This word, we heard it tonight. We've been hearing it all the time that we're sons and daughters of God. Amen. Are we sons and daughters of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. Have we been called to this great high calling? &gt;&gt; Do we believe that we're going to take a rapture? That we're going to take a perfect faith. Do we believe the seed of God that's within us? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then then then we can believe NOTHING ELSE BUT THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN we believe the truth, and this is the truth, and that truth will set you free &gt;&gt; when you let go and let God have his way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's it. I &gt;&gt; I can go on and on and and go deeper into it, but just let go. Remember, lot wife, just don't look back. &gt;&gt; Let the thing go and press on to the mark of the high calling. Whatever it is, I guarantee you if you let it go in your spirit. It may be a memory, a feel, an experience. Whatever it is, just let it go &gt;&gt; and watch the growth that will happen in your life. God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Tim. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I still have a few after effects of the flu. Uh in terms of my voice not fully back, but the flu itself is gone from me completely. I'm happy to be here tonight. Uh I am also very uh proud to see what's happening in your lives and to see uh what uh has been accomplished during this past year. I want to give God all the glory and the honor and the praise. &gt;&gt; Um if I can have a Psalm 23 verse 5 um up there will be very nice. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup run it over. &gt;&gt; Oh, thanks be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; H what a position. We are leaving the old year behind. And he's saying you haven't entered the new year yet. But I I I prepared a table for you. &gt;&gt; I prepared a feast for you. &gt;&gt; I prepared something good in your future for you. &gt;&gt; It's prepared already. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand? It's it's there. It's waiting for you as you entered into this new year. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies. Of course, that's David speaking because Saul was hunting him like the devil is hunting us. And he's just hunting him and he's running for his life all the time. And next thing you know, uh he didn't know where he's going to even get food some days. He didn't know what's going to happen. and he ended up going into the temple and asking the priest, the high priest, uh, for some food. And the priest says, "Well, there is no food here. The only thing that I could give you is the shoe bread." But you see, that's only given uh to the high priest. anybody else that eats that would die. But but David said, "Look, I'm so hungry. We and my men are so hungry, we got to eat something." &gt;&gt; And so the high priest gave them the shoe bread and they ate the shoebre. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You see, I tell you, so when he said, "Thou prepareest a table before me in the presence of my enemies that are hunting me," HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; Don't you worry about the devil. Don't you worry about all these uh troubles, trials, tribulations, sicknesses, problems that will come your way. THEY'RE GOING TO COME. BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THOSE THINGS, HEALTH, HEALING, PROSPERITY, BLESSING, LIFTING UP, PASSING YOUR EXAMS, PASSING YOUR JOB your your your job uh what do you call it? Interviews and all those THINGS THAT IT'S IT'S AHEAD OF YOU, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH IT ALL BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY PREPARED the way for you. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. Leave the scripture up. Praise. I'm going to finish. Praise the Lord. Uh uh. You know, I can't remember all this like I used to. Praise the Lord. [laughter] He says, "Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runth over." He's going to bless you so much that your cup is going to be full &gt;&gt; and running over. &gt;&gt; What? Well, well, what is this? He's talking about God wasting cup running over and all like that spilling all over the floor and everything else. We'll talk about that another time. But just know God wants to bless you with enough so that you can give and help others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not to give away what you have, but I let your cup be full. You handle whatever you have to handle and I'll make it run over &gt;&gt; and you'll be able to take all those excesses and bless other people with it. &gt;&gt; We're a blessed people &gt;&gt; and I want to wish you a happy new year. &gt;&gt; I want to I want you to have a blessed uh 2026 &gt;&gt; for me and I hope for you. God is my health. The Lord Jesus is my joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus is my wealth. &gt;&gt; He is my happiness. &gt;&gt; He is my all in all. I hope he is the same to all of us. I appreciated the testimonies. I appreciated the songs. I see the potential uh in many of the young people that came up. Praise. Everybody is young to me anyway, but praise them. [laughter] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Come up. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Sam. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Get on up and wish your brothers and sisters a happy new year.
