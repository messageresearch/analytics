[0:00] part of the materials they used was was
[0:03] HZ us to help so we have to dig out the
[0:05] As and we have to get this out of the
[0:08] forde and whatever else and yet we're
[0:10] saying we're we're boasting that we're
[0:13] better and everything that they built we
[0:16] are not going back totir because it's
[0:18] still standing amen that's right so
[0:21] signs of the times are
[0:23] everywhere amen when we look around us
[0:26] we see the signs of the things are
[0:28] everywhere and I believe that uh people
[0:32] are not worried about these signs of the
[0:34] times the only time when they get
[0:35] worried is when there is a a worldwide
[0:38] disaster then their minds turn to God
[0:41] their minds turn to judgment I don't
[0:44] care which human being it is and how
[0:47] they say oh I don't believe in God but
[0:49] when exhaust traes the first person they
[0:56] call I thought you don't believe in God
[0:59] but it's human heart they're built that
[1:02] way to believe in God the fool has said
[1:05] in his heart there is no God you just
[1:08] have to ask where did you come from my
[1:10] mother where did your mother come from
[1:11] and then we keep going back there a
[1:13] chicken in the egg story go right back
[1:16] but you got to you either have to have
[1:18] somebody made that chicken or made that
[1:20] egg because it just can't be like that
[1:22] they have to some super being that did
[1:25] that and whatever you want to call him
[1:27] that's what we call God Amen praise God
[1:30] and more than that he became flesh and
[1:32] we know him as Jesus Christ the same
[1:34] yesterday today and forever amen so we
[1:37] know that it's when there's critical
[1:40] points in history that people turn to
[1:43] God you know 911 they said the Bibles in
[1:47] the bookstores were sold out there
[1:50] wasn't a Bible that you could find we
[1:53] were almost godly people now we all
[1:56] people the churches were jammed couldn't
[2:00] find Space people were calling on God
[2:03] and talking about Revival and everything
[2:05] else and judgment and everything else
[2:08] after that once they see everything calm
[2:10] down they run you
[2:12] know the one Prophet said like a dog to
[2:16] his b they go right back you know go
[2:19] right back to the FI of the world and
[2:21] the things of the world right like that
[2:24] oh Mar but we know that we living in a
[2:27] day of turmoil
[2:30] song says trouble sometimes are here
[2:33] filling man's hearts with fear Freedom
[2:36] we all hold there now is that St we
[2:39] living in trouble sometimes second D he
[2:42] says perilous times shall
[2:45] come your selfishness will
[2:48] abound where uh some people got 100
[2:52] billion and and they don't care you know
[2:56] oh more for me me me me me and one more
[2:58] more more and past the guy Starving in
[3:01] the street and say why doesn't he find a
[3:03] job why does he pick up himself from his
[3:06] bootstrap like I did never mind my
[3:09] father loed me a million dollars to get
[3:12] started so we have to understand the
[3:15] perilous times you live in amen and it's
[3:19] so bad now that people are going insane
[3:22] like the prophet said they will go and
[3:24] save cuz they don't have no more answers
[3:27] they don't even believe the doctors they
[3:28] don't believe the scientist don't
[3:29] believe the politicians it's lies lies
[3:32] lies lies lies and it's all coming from
[3:35] the father of lies because he's the one
[3:38] that's inspiring it and so the people
[3:40] don't have answers to their problems
[3:44] anymore they sending them into
[3:45] depressions oppressions and all kinds of
[3:49] phobias and fears and complexes and
[3:52] anxieties and getting all kinds of
[3:55] things coming upon them because they
[3:58] have no answers you know your your brain
[4:01] you're trying to use your own brain to
[4:03] solve problems and after while can't do
[4:05] it it's like a machine that charge
[4:08] circuit is that right you know you
[4:11] overload certain types of machines all
[4:13] sudden you and smoke because it it just
[4:16] can't take it and the human being is
[4:19] wired to worship wired to serve God and
[4:23] you're trying to overlo it by doing
[4:25] something else after a while that thing
[4:27] is going to short circuit and a lot of
[4:30] that is taking place right now yes
[4:33] people are going ins s and they W away
[4:36] from God and wondering where to turn to
[4:41] and what to do and the funny thing about
[4:44] them is that God has in you will simply
[4:47] tell them Christ is the
[4:50] answer and they
[4:53] laughing uh I was in the lawyer's office
[4:56] and talking to him and he said well how
[4:58] did that happen I I don't understand how
[5:00] did this all of a sudden happen like
[5:02] that said well you know it was just the
[5:04] hand of God oh yes God as if when
[5:07] mocking way to everything you is God
[5:10] that is too simple an answer how can it
[5:12] be God you must have some contact with
[5:15] some powerful person for that to happen
[5:18] well I do have a contact with the most
[5:20] powerful person but you don't want to
[5:22] believe it you want to think it's a
[5:25] natural person amen but God is still in
[5:28] control
[5:30] God is still
[5:31] Sovereign and he he sits and he looks
[5:34] down to the
[5:35] Lord and he knows everything that's
[5:38] going on and nothing can be hidden from
[5:40] him his eye is in every place Lord
[5:44] praise God hallelujah and his word the
[5:47] Bible says run swiftly throughout the
[5:49] Earth to fulfill whatever he says amen
[5:52] praise God so we know that the people
[5:56] don't know where to turn where to turn
[5:58] to but we know that the Bible and the
[6:02] message that we have received has the
[6:04] answers for this day and for this hour
[6:08] Hallelujah
[6:09] iined that we have been given the
[6:12] answers to meet the challenge of this
[6:14] hour and that's the only reason we as a
[6:18] as a people as a people will overcome
[6:21] that's right we will not overcome by our
[6:23] own study wisdom research or knowledge
[6:26] but we will we will overcome by him who
[6:29] has already overcome the wor amen which
[6:33] they triy to in history but he's risen
[6:36] from the dead and he's alive forever
[6:38] more and that's the only reason we are
[6:40] overcoming not by our strength but his
[6:44] strength made perfect in our
[6:46] weakness by that we will overcome praise
[6:50] God so to him be all the glory and the
[6:52] praise everything you ever accomplish to
[6:55] his glory and praise everything that we
[6:59] do it's not by our strength or by our
[7:02] Grace but it's by the grace of
[7:05] God raise our
[7:09] hands us us what he will do for
[7:14] us that day I will not leave you alone
[7:18] but I'll be with you to the very end of
[7:20] thee he PR in the word and I believe
[7:23] this promise amen I hope you do also
[7:26] praise God the people are searching
[7:28] everywhere for
[7:31] they're running all everywhere amen just
[7:34] to think of it is goat yoga going to
[7:36] save
[7:38] you listen to such a ridiculous
[7:41] nonsense you know watching the goats the
[7:44] Z they jump and then you get a yoga
[7:46] system from that goat yoga you know
[7:49] you're making yourself a goat and then
[7:52] you know all kinds of foolishness you
[7:55] know because they don't have an
[7:56] answer I think somewhere brother BR said
[7:59] turning back to spiritualism and
[8:02] Witchcraft and all these things because
[8:04] man heart yearn to worship a spirit
[8:06] being God right but because they reject
[8:10] God we said because you reject what I'm
[8:12] telling you I'm going to turn you over
[8:14] to every un natural and wicked and evil
[8:17] thing to make you believe nonsense to
[8:21] make you believe all kinds of Stuffy
[8:23] nonsense that's where the world is today
[8:26] they're Believing on things that should
[8:28] be un believable they are believing and
[8:31] what should be believable they're not
[8:33] believing it and so they're running into
[8:36] all kinds of trouble they don't know
[8:38] where to look anymore but we know how to
[8:41] look away to Jesus Hallelujah we know
[8:44] how to look to the finisher of
[8:51] ourish
[8:53] Hallelujah yes Jesus and amen here is
[8:58] Son of Man the bottom the alpha H but
[9:02] there the son of man in the top Oma
[9:05] praise God he started it and he finish
[9:09] it amen for he's the author and and the
[9:13] finisher a revelation comes from him and
[9:16] he's going to perfect it and bring us
[9:19] right out into the perfect statue of a
[9:21] perfect man glory to God hallelujah amen
[9:25] yes sir praise God so we have to listen
[9:29] to what God is saying in this hour and
[9:32] watch the signs of the times now Jesus
[9:36] of course in the Bible was asked again
[9:38] and
[9:39] again over and over what the signs
[9:41] should be asked that by whether it was
[9:44] John the Baptist whether it was
[9:45] Sadducees by by his own disciples
[9:47] Matthew 24 you know that uh Matthew 24
[9:50] when they asked him what what would be
[9:52] the sign your coming and use our
[9:54] scripture here tonight it was the SES
[9:56] ofes ask what will be the sign in the
[9:58] end like that and then John the Baptist
[10:01] is asking are you the Christ and he
[10:03] wants to know are you the one that's
[10:05] supposed to come right he was actually
[10:07] asking about his first Covenant right
[10:10] like that so you can see it right down
[10:12] man always want to know when is the
[10:14] Messiah come even now the Jews are over
[10:17] there in Israel they asking the same
[10:19] question when will the Messiah arrive
[10:22] when he's going to come amen see that's
[10:24] always the question praise the Lord
[10:26] hallelujah so the sign that he he was
[10:29] the Messiah of course he showed them
[10:31] many signs while he was alive but the
[10:33] crucifixion actually uh settled it
[10:37] off they should have known by that
[10:41] crucifixion they didn't believe his
[10:43] virgin birth even though Isaiah 800
[10:47] years before had said it it shall be a
[10:51] sign that a virgin will conceive and
[10:55] their my God that should be a miraculous
[10:58] thing and they should be looking for a
[10:59] virgin to conceive and bear a son but
[11:01] when the Virgin did come and tell them
[11:03] that she did conceive and she was
[11:05] bearing a son they called they called
[11:09] her a
[11:10] for amen CU said they tell them Jesus
[11:14] you you want the
[11:16] fornication right so they didn't
[11:18] recognize that sign it passed right by
[11:21] and that's why Jesus knew that many
[11:23] signs would given right like that and
[11:26] they uh you know they were asking this
[11:29] questions first of all you know John the
[11:31] Baptist art thou the one that should
[11:35] come amen and then Jesus referred him to
[11:39] many signs there in the Bible if you go
[11:42] find the scripture this is a Bible study
[11:44] right so you need to go back when I'm
[11:46] finish here and look and read your Bible
[11:49] around the subject so that you can
[11:51] Enlighten yourself even more personally
[11:54] okay praise the Lord cuz if I were to
[11:56] ever put all the scriptures all this and
[11:58] that be there for hours is that right
[12:01] we've been there for hours we don't need
[12:03] I don't need to do that you are the one
[12:05] that needs to go and dig in the word of
[12:08] God to get the actual scriptures that
[12:11] are there amen excuse
[12:14] me hallelujah
[12:19] amen
[12:23] amen now the scripture we read tonight
[12:27] Jesus were was rebuked
[12:29] the religious leaders of this day
[12:31] because they were religious leaders and
[12:34] he says you're the religious leaders but
[12:37] you don't even recognize the sign of
[12:39] your time which is he was the Super sign
[12:42] standing there amen he was the Super
[12:45] sign all the wonders of miracles signs
[12:48] wonders and you still ask him what it is
[12:51] but said if there if if this room was in
[12:54] total
[12:55] darkness and then God spoke and said let
[12:59] be light something bright up there you
[13:02] going to still ask what is that he just
[13:05] said let there be light and something
[13:07] bright appears you and it has never been
[13:10] before but now something you have never
[13:12] seen happen and and something bright
[13:14] appears you don't have to ask the he
[13:17] said the manifestation is the
[13:20] interpretation CU once the thing appears
[13:23] before you that is the interpretation
[13:25] you know what it is and you recognize
[13:27] what is going on praise the Lord
[13:29] hallelujah so here it is amen he says
[13:35] you that to these men that you know the
[13:39] signs of nature that when the sun comes
[13:42] up a certain way in the morning you know
[13:45] it's going to be a good day that's right
[13:47] when it goes down with this red lowering
[13:50] and have certain things around it you
[13:52] can read those signs of Nature and you
[13:55] recognize What's happen and the next day
[13:58] you know it's going to be a bad day he
[13:59] said you can read the Natural Science
[14:02] but you got no Revelation to understand
[14:06] the spiritual science written in the
[14:08] word because it was already there in the
[14:11] word as it was in the of
[14:13] soal as it was in the of so shall
[14:17] there's many scriptures there well did
[14:19] Isaiah say he was even giv them the
[14:21] scriptures well this other one say so
[14:23] and so and so oh you Hypocrites you can
[14:26] read that but you can't see what the
[14:29] signs of the times are right there he
[14:31] was preaching the message that brother
[14:32] BR saw that's why he put it in mod terms
[14:35] recognize your day and it
[14:38] message Hallelujah this the same thing
[14:41] Jesus was preaching but brother caught
[14:44] that Revelation what he was telling him
[14:45] and he preached the message to meet our
[14:48] time and our season and our day amen
[14:51] that if we're going to make it true we
[14:53] must recognize what day we in now if you
[14:57] didn't recognize that a prophet came
[14:59] okay if you did not recognize that
[15:01] Malachi 4 was fulfilled 45 Revelation
[15:05] 10:7 was
[15:07] fulfilled Luke
[15:09] 17:31 is now being made manifest the
[15:12] unveiling of the Mighty God Son of Man
[15:14] now being revealed if you didn't know
[15:16] that every one of us would be sitting
[15:19] right in that Cemetery uh back in the
[15:22] old denominational houses or religions
[15:25] or faith that amen you know that that's
[15:28] right
[15:29] plus I would have never known you
[15:31] brother then right I would have never
[15:34] known you sister we all come from
[15:36] thousands of miles apart but brother B
[15:39] knew that a miracle was about to occur
[15:42] from his ministry that's why he said
[15:44] they they come from the East and West
[15:48] they come from the lands ofar to Fe with
[15:52] the king of the Revelation to die as his
[15:55] guest how blessed those PMS are
[15:59] beholding the face he means catching the
[16:02] Revelation for the day amen
[16:06] hallelujah with light theine the word L
[16:09] up amen bless partakers of his grace by
[16:14] grace alone amen as GS in his crown to
[16:18] shine amen it polishes us and makes us
[16:21] into jewels in the king's crown glory to
[16:25] God hallelujah amen and so if you didn't
[16:28] recog it I didn't recognize it we
[16:31] wouldn't even be here tonight amen this
[16:34] as simple as you see it you're looking
[16:36] at a predestinated miracle we are here
[16:40] by
[16:41] predestination Prophet said you think
[16:43] you just walk in there by your own will
[16:45] and you decide you're just going to come
[16:47] to church you are here because the
[16:49] spirit of God LED your here that's
[16:55] right because other people heard the
[16:57] same thing
[16:59] you didn't do anything to them but you
[17:02] heard the same thing and it did
[17:04] something to you and still doing
[17:07] something for because you're tracking on
[17:10] in you're Journey to the promised land
[17:12] beyond the river praise the Lord
[17:15] something is leading and guiding you
[17:18] hallelujah amen oh praise God Jesus was
[17:24] saying to them in other words if you be
[17:28] the leaders of the people
[17:30] you can deser the natural signs but you
[17:33] can't discern the supernatural signs how
[17:36] in the world are you going to be able to
[17:38] teach the people War the people and
[17:41] preach to them about hell judgment
[17:45] sin uh Redemption repentance how we
[17:49] going to teach all these things because
[17:51] we yourself not seen the danger you you
[17:54] go back read the Bible you see he tried
[17:56] to refer that to them so many times so
[17:58] they can catch on but they never fall
[18:00] blind leaving the blind would they not
[18:02] both fall in the ditch and so many other
[18:05] scriptures he used like that even had to
[18:08] explain to the disciples unto you it is
[18:10] given to know the Mysteries but unto
[18:12] them it's not given praise God to them
[18:15] it's a mystery to use a revelation to
[18:17] them it's a parable to use a promise
[18:20] amen praise God he was just doing
[18:23] everything he can being the wave Chief
[18:25] to try to wave something in FR of them
[18:29] just like when a baby's just born you
[18:31] know their sight is not good like Paul
[18:33] said now we see through a class Darkly
[18:36] amen praise God so the mother puts up
[18:39] toys and stuff like that and hands it up
[18:41] so that when the colors move and and and
[18:44] and the wind sways it or whatever she
[18:45] might even shake it it's so that that
[18:48] child's eyes can start learning to
[18:50] focus right and then after wife can see
[18:53] clearly and then it's able to know it's
[18:55] Mom then it's able to know it's Dad but
[18:57] when they just born there sight is not
[18:59] clear as yet it takes a while for the uh
[19:02] the sight to open up like that but
[19:04] that's what Jesus he was the way sheep
[19:07] God was waving him in front of that now
[19:09] to say see this see that see this see
[19:11] this see that see this see this other
[19:13] the thing here just for them to catch on
[19:15] they didn't
[19:16] catch Hallelujah and in our day God
[19:20] picked up brother BR raised him up amen
[19:25] with the spirit of God waved him in
[19:26] front of him of us hallelujah
[19:29] amen this is a prophet amen he has the
[19:32] word for the hour praise God attract
[19:34] your attention first B second B praise
[19:44] God I see the word being made flesh I
[19:47] see the word come back I see the
[19:49] restoration I see the resurrection and R
[19:52] progress I see beond the river never fa
[20:02] Now by we gain that P here and there one
[20:07] by one began the portal there to dwell
[20:10] with the Immortals Prophet said the
[20:12] moment you cast the Revelation and break
[20:15] in you recognize that you always was an
[20:18] eternal
[20:19] being
[20:21] amen it's only an eternal being is
[20:23] understanding Eternal being is that
[20:25] right only God can understand God that's
[20:29] why no man can see God and live is that
[20:34] right you just another
[20:36] human you can't see God who live but by
[20:40] revelation we see God seeing God and it
[20:44] made us live amen praise God hallelujah
[20:48] here we are praise His wonderful
[20:50] precious name amen hallelujah well we
[20:53] know in the Old Testament
[20:56] times God gave a lot of signs to kind of
[21:01] inform people about the coming of the
[21:04] Lord Jesus Christ it's whether or not
[21:07] they were willing to read the science
[21:11] recognize the SS and obey the
[21:14] science so that it could be made
[21:17] manifest clearly to them amen hallelujah
[21:21] so we know if they had done that they
[21:24] would have an
[21:26] apostate uh not the day the hour but
[21:29] they will recognize the
[21:31] season of the coming of the Lord now we
[21:35] even us we don't recognize the exact day
[21:38] because he already said no man is going
[21:39] to know the exact day right I'm using
[21:43] the word in two compound ways to
[21:45] recognize the exact day like Monday
[21:47] Tuesday Wednesday Thursday but no man is
[21:50] going to recognize the day which the son
[21:52] of man comes right but Hallelujah he
[21:55] didn't say you're not going to recognize
[21:57] the day or season in another sense you
[22:00] would recognize the season it's a season
[22:03] and when that season comes in for the
[22:06] word to be fulfilled just like uh if I
[22:09] would put it the way when Simeon uh
[22:12] start coming to the temple because it
[22:14] was revealed to him by Revelation it was
[22:17] a time for the Christ to appear in the
[22:20] temple amen hallelujah so he just
[22:24] started going to the temple Anna she CAU
[22:26] the same thing she started going to the
[22:28] temple and waiting there and looking
[22:30] looking at all them uh young women
[22:32] coming to offer up their child and
[22:35] everything else and that one day he felt
[22:37] a strong feeling she felt the S and they
[22:40] walk both out and when they come both of
[22:42] them set their eyes on the one young
[22:44] virgin with her child in her hand amen
[22:48] oh Lord let the Ser depart in peace my
[22:51] eyes have seen the salvation of the Lord
[22:55] hallelujah I see the SA
[22:58] God hallelujah he saw the sign of the
[23:02] day praise God hallelujah now if there
[23:06] were pain mind they would recognize when
[23:10] this woman started talking about being a
[23:11] virgin and still bearing her son this
[23:14] even if one of them was really spiritual
[23:16] they would have
[23:17] recognized then here's another clue the
[23:22] Bible says and thou Bethlehem a from
[23:25] thee it's from you that the king is
[23:28] going to be born amen and he's going to
[23:32] come out of the root of the seed of
[23:35] David Hallelujah both Mary and Joseph of
[23:38] course come from that L and he was born
[23:40] in that L right so they should have
[23:44] immediately recognize that he was a son
[23:47] of David because you know David's
[23:49] connection with Bethlehem and the Bale
[23:51] and all of that and the real well was
[23:53] Now dog right there Bethlehem he they
[23:57] had that one dog there but that was just
[23:59] a symbol the real well was now here in
[24:01] Bethlehem and they failed to recognize
[24:04] it amen and there many other scriptures
[24:07] that was pointing to him where he was
[24:11] born lying he would come from you know
[24:15] how a virgin would conceive and so on
[24:17] many things like that and they still
[24:20] would did not recognize it if they did
[24:23] they would have recognized at least the
[24:25] season and time amen praise the Lord
[24:29] hallelujah but they did not recognize
[24:32] the season and time and they didn't
[24:35] understand what was happening or else
[24:38] they would agree with him Hallelujah but
[24:40] they had their own ideas amen amen would
[24:43] you write down John
[24:50] 7:27
[24:52] because when Jesus spoke to them they
[24:55] turned around and said
[24:58] when Christ comes no one will know when
[25:01] he come whence he is
[25:04] from not there were so blind that that
[25:08] the scriptures there were Masters in the
[25:10] scripture boasting that they were
[25:12] theologians of their day there were
[25:14] scribes of their day and they read all
[25:16] those scriptures and yet they're saying
[25:19] the scripture doesn't tell from whence
[25:20] Christ will come but it's not till Herod
[25:24] threatened those wise men and said you
[25:26] got to tell me an answer what these men
[25:27] are talking about you know the wise men
[25:29] that came and asked him uh where is he
[25:31] born King of the Jews then he told his
[25:34] wise men find the answers let me know
[25:37] then the really search the scriptures
[25:39] because desperation Herod never fooled
[25:41] around if you didn't bring him the
[25:42] answer your head was off so desperation
[25:45] they dou and it said oh we found the
[25:47] prophecy of the Prophet out that out of
[25:51] Bethlehem the Christ would be born amen
[25:54] hallelujah but then recognize that in
[25:56] the first place amen and here they read
[25:59] the scripture and yet they're looking at
[26:02] Mary Joseph and his child in Bethlehem
[26:05] and they still didn't recogniz so you
[26:07] can read the scripture and not have a
[26:09] Revelations true you had Theologian you
[26:12] can study the scripture all your life
[26:14] and you'll have no understanding of what
[26:17] you're reading praise the Lord
[26:19] hallelujah well friends we know the
[26:22] signs of times are very
[26:24] important and you know that that even if
[26:27] we got GPS and all that today and you
[26:30] also have signs on the streets you can
[26:33] read the signs but let me tell you if
[26:35] you really don't follow the signs you're
[26:38] going to be in a mess you be going in
[26:40] circles is that right you be going in
[26:43] circles now uh not to say America is any
[26:46] less than Canada but when I go over
[26:48] there I don't understand their system of
[26:50] signs because a matter of fact somebody
[26:53] can take the sign and turn it in the
[26:54] opposite
[26:55] direction it can be pointed this way or
[26:58] that way or whatever and you don't
[27:00] really know where to go and sometimes
[27:02] the signs are too abrupt in other words
[27:05] if you have to turn here the sign is
[27:06] right there there is nothing up the road
[27:09] way to tell you in order you going have
[27:12] to make a right you we are used to
[27:16] having our science place maybe one two
[27:19] coming up to a you know a turn off you
[27:22] know all of a sudden the sign is there
[27:23] and you got turn
[27:26] amen and you happen to be in the outside
[27:29] Lane God help
[27:31] you but when you go up to the next turn
[27:34] off and think it's easy for you to just
[27:36] make you turn and come back when you
[27:38] come off up in the city your T there the
[27:40] streets are so I don't know B mess that
[27:44] might by time you get back around to
[27:46] come you might be lost up there before
[27:48] you get back down to the
[27:50] highway amen so signs are very important
[27:54] amen amen and God brother B said never
[27:58] brings man to judgment without giving a
[28:01] fair warning first so he sends prophets
[28:05] but he sends them way ahead of time so
[28:08] that you have a lot of time to get
[28:10] yourself ready and do whatever you have
[28:13] to do so that when the changing of the
[28:16] age come the change of dispensation
[28:19] comes you can make the
[28:22] time because you recognize your day and
[28:26] this message
[28:28] recognize also the sign post that God
[28:32] placed there that in this day Mal 45
[28:36] will be the sign in this day and you
[28:39] have to go where it's
[28:42] wanted of course a lot of people still
[28:44] get lost because they sit down under the
[28:46] signpost oh great signpost oh great
[28:49] prophet oh and that's wonderful but
[28:52] that's not getting know where you're
[28:53] supposed to go if you sit right
[28:54] underneath the sign and because the sign
[28:57] is big enough to give you some shade you
[29:00] shade yourself out of the sign and
[29:02] you're not going on to where you're
[29:03] supposed to go you got to go out there
[29:05] never mind that hot son is going to hit
[29:06] you trial tribulation and you're going
[29:08] to be many times tested whether you're
[29:11] ashamed of him or persecuting whatever
[29:13] you got
[29:16] a hallelujah thank you Lord amen
[29:20] hallelujah amen now we know when we
[29:23] speak about the signs of the times we
[29:26] mean signs that will give us light in
[29:29] our day not concerning the Jesus being
[29:33] born but the coming of the son of
[29:36] man that's what we looking at the coming
[29:39] of the son of man in our day praise God
[29:43] Hallelujah for the head to return to the
[29:46] body which he was building through seven
[29:49] Church anges like we spoke on Sunday
[29:51] amen praise the Lord so the head is now
[29:54] going to come back on the body and like
[29:56] we describ the flange like he described
[29:58] it's got to fit in that pocket so they
[30:00] can settle them solid and the whole
[30:03] thing will be cemented together by the
[30:05] love of God Amen praise the Lord
[30:07] hallelujah amen is this making any sense
[30:11] praise the name of the Lord
[30:13] hallelujah amen hallelujah oh my so when
[30:19] when we look now we're not looking back
[30:22] like a lot of the Pentecostals Methodist
[30:25] Baptists not to be critical but they're
[30:27] looking back and they are looking for
[30:31] Jesus to come again but they're looking
[30:34] for the Jesus that they saw back in uh
[30:37] you know back when he came the first
[30:40] time they don't recognize that this is a
[30:43] different common amen and they are not
[30:47] because they don't recognize that they
[30:50] don't know how to prepare for the events
[30:55] that are to take place are are taking
[30:58] they don't know how to prepare how to
[31:00] pack up how to get ready the bright has
[31:03] made ready only Revelation gets R and if
[31:07] you don't have Revelation how you going
[31:08] to get ready amen praise the name of the
[31:11] Lord like let me give you just a small
[31:14] example oh come to the altar Pentecostal
[31:17] uh Pentecostal um altar call come to the
[31:20] altar come to the Lord so be born again
[31:23] all some all some scripture repent of
[31:25] your come repent to the AL and
[31:28] everything else now to be
[31:32] honest how are you going
[31:35] to
[31:36] repent if you don't even have a
[31:38] revelation of what original sin is amen
[31:43] you understand what you doing is only
[31:45] repenting of maybe few things you did
[31:47] smoking drinkly but we're talking about
[31:49] a total Deliverance now that's right
[31:51] we're talking about repent original sin
[31:54] we talking about your sin and we talking
[31:56] about even taking our future sin M amen
[31:59] and you just you run to the Altar and
[32:00] say Lord I used to use drugs Lord I
[32:03] smoke forgive me praise the Lord and you
[32:06] talk like that but you don't have a
[32:07] revelation of the enormity the cruelty
[32:11] and the real Corruption of sin that it
[32:14] goes from the out inside out complete
[32:18] total death amen sin brings death amen
[32:23] hallelujah it don't just twist your mind
[32:26] and twist your body twist your thought
[32:28] piss your soul and then somehow you
[32:31] going to be all right no it kills right
[32:34] sin destroys you and only he can bring
[32:37] you back to life amen give you life out
[32:40] of death praise God so without the
[32:44] Revelation a person really can't really
[32:46] repent they really can't even believe
[32:50] because you say oh I believe Jesus
[32:52] believe Jesus well faith has to have a
[32:56] foundation
[32:59] what do you believe when you say you
[33:01] believe what you really believe if
[33:02] something has been revealed to you where
[33:05] you your Fai how is your faith going to
[33:07] your your find a res in place amen it's
[33:10] got to have a rest in place and that res
[33:12] in place has to be not just the Bible
[33:15] but a revelation of the word of God
[33:17] that's right amen so you rest on that
[33:20] the revelation of the word of God they
[33:23] are still back where they are just
[33:24] resting on the readings of the Bible
[33:27] amen and they can make money off of it
[33:29] manufacture it do this sell things do
[33:32] that do whatever else but that's just
[33:35] the the the written part of the word
[33:38] they're masters of it and they're
[33:40] building on that but but that's building
[33:42] on S amen but we are building on the
[33:45] Rock revelation of the word of God amen
[33:48] amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen yes
[33:52] sir oh praise God hallelujah what does
[33:56] that what did Brother BR say
[33:58] Watchman what the night morning cometh

[34:24] aware what's happening J of God times
[34:28] and we living in recognize your day and
[34:31] a message for your day praise the name
[34:33] of the Lord so we got to keep our eyes
[34:36] also on God's time peace that's right
[34:41] and we know according to scripture that
[34:44] Israel is last time Beast amen
[34:48] hallelujah when we see all these signs
[34:51] combining themselves and everything else
[34:54] conglomerating and and getting together
[34:57] Hallelujah
[34:58] said watch he says when he s about the
[35:02] combine is coming he says I need the
[35:04] world
[35:06] C amen check sometime in your computer
[35:09] and you'll find that he actually use
[35:12] that to say he's talking about the world
[35:13] com to the churches they're going to
[35:15] churches going to combine together to
[35:17] push the word out amen so the combine is
[35:20] com he knows what is happening praise
[35:23] God so we see all these signs coming
[35:26] together like that and all the focus is
[35:29] going to turn on Israel and it is
[35:31] turning on Israel amen and he says when
[35:35] you see that begins to happen the kinds
[35:37] of the Gentiles are
[35:39] over
[35:41] hallelujah how you going to recognize if
[35:43] you don't recognize Revelation
[35:45] 107 amen 10 10 1-7 the angel put his
[35:51] foot one of the land one on the sea and
[35:53] he says what time shall be no more
[35:58] in other words the time for these
[36:00] prophecies has come to an end the age is
[36:05] over it's run out not time for the world
[36:09] run out but he's talking about the time
[36:13] like when Jesus was to be born one and
[36:16] when the fullness of time had come God s
[36:19] for his son doesn't mean time for the
[36:21] world ended but the time for the
[36:23] prophecy is now here and it's got to be
[36:25] fulfilled praise God hallelujah amen now
[36:28] if you have no Revelation you will
[36:30] recognize that sign right you wouldn't
[36:33] recognize the sign how many of them
[36:36] recognize that Jesus already
[36:39] descended they don't know anything
[36:41] they're read the Bible child boys
[36:43] trumpet but they have no idea no
[36:45] Revelation that he stepped down already
[36:49] and he is here appearing to his bride
[36:53] preparing her for his com amen Prophet
[36:58] said he's already come and you didn't
[37:01] know
[37:02] it but right now he's here in word for
[37:04] all praise the Lord and soon he'll
[37:08] fulfill all that he has spoken of in his
[37:11] word praise the Lord hallelujah amen
[37:14] hallelujah so if you are a people a
[37:17] revelated people let me use that word a
[37:20] revelated people a people who have
[37:21] receive the Revelation then you also
[37:23] know that you have a great
[37:24] responsibility
[37:27] because with wisdom knowledge experience
[37:29] comes
[37:30] responsibility and that responsibility
[37:32] God will hold us
[37:34] guilty because he said son of
[37:37] man I show you these things if you don't
[37:40] warn the unbelieving and the wicked I'll
[37:44] hold you guilty your their blood will be
[37:47] on your hands you at least need to warn
[37:50] them whatever they do that's up to them
[37:52] am God said because when you speak to
[37:55] them he says if they don't take what you
[37:57] say then from there on I know their
[38:00] blood be on their own head right so we
[38:03] don't have any excuse to say Well
[38:05] they're not going to take it whatever he
[38:07] says whether they take it or they don't
[38:08] take it
[38:10] War you got to war that it's coming soon
[38:14] Jesus coming soon morning and night and
[38:16] do no many will meet their Doom
[38:21] Hallelujah so therefore we must warn our
[38:25] friends our family our neighbors
[38:27] everybody that we meet whenever we have
[38:29] an opening or an opportunity we need to
[38:32] warn them that the Lord Jesus is coming
[38:35] again and you're doing it by Revelation
[38:37] amen hallelujah amen and I want to thank
[38:39] God for one thing God don't speak to his
[38:41] people in rhyth right that's right is
[38:44] that right amen he speak to the people
[38:47] outside in rhythms amen but to us he
[38:49] speaks to us in Revelation amen he puts
[38:52] his lips to our ears and he whispers to
[38:55] our ears just like he did with Moses he
[38:57] said Moses is special for I speak to him
[39:01] lip to air amen is that right Whispers

[39:39] father your aunt your grandfather
[39:41] something like that if he's going to
[39:42] speak to you you'll see their image in
[39:45] in your dream or in your vision and then
[39:47] they'll speak amen I said had a dream of
[39:49] my grandfather and he told me this that
[39:51] that but God used that because he knows
[39:53] you're familiar with that so he used him
[39:55] he says you know you're you're not
[39:57] scared of it praise the Lord uh brother

[40:03] if an angel appear how I would react if

[44:51] wonderful to know that we are right in
[44:53] the line amen hallelujah amen you see
[44:58] if we had not believed the message of
[45:00] the hour and believed the Lord Jesus
[45:03] Christ believe scriptures like Matthew
