========================================
[Music] good evening it's good to be here with you again in the presence of the lord this evening i should have started on the beginning of the laodicean church age however i will be speaking on the promises to his own his promises to his own and may the lord bless us in our bible study tonight on this seven church age series in which we are uh engaged and may the holy spirit the living god so excite our hearts and so uh irrigate our minds that we will be watered by the word of god and grow up into trees of righteousness for his glory honor and praise i come to you once again in the name of the lord jesus christ and we will be uh reading from the glorious prophetic book of revelation chapter 3 reading from verses 11 to 13. let us read together behold i come quickly hold fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown him that overcome it will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let us pray righteous and gracious father who loveth thine own even to the very end we sent thee for thy divine presence we thank you for the unfolding of this seals thank you for opening the scrolls of life and revealing to us as one brother says taking the seals off of our lives lamb of god gracious one or sovereign king who has redeemed us by your precious blood we thank you for this marvelous and wonderful privilege by which we are allowed to approach thy august presence through the blood of jesus christ thine own shed blood through that precious body in which you lived and manifested yourself named jesus christ and through him we have brought nigh back into fellowship with thee may you take thy word tonight lord and send the spirit upon it and may live in our hearts and grant us a divine resurrection in the name of jesus christ our lovely precious lord amen thanks be to god and thank you for being here france thank you for being here brothers and sisters for together like children around our father's throne we can gamble we gamble not gamble but gamble which means to playfully dance around our father's throne giving him glory and honor and praise as we look into the perfect law of liberty and these wonderful things of the lord jesus christ amen yes as one songwriter says coming soon coming soon jesus in all of his glory yes as we worship and praise him we know from the bottom of our hearts with the trail of expectancy that jesus is coming soon hallelujah amen so because he's coming soon let us hold fast to this message to the treasures and the riches of christ that we have received through the ministry of brother william marion branham the prophet of malachi 4. we have received this because of his sacrifice of bearing the reproach of the word of god father we we certainly thank god for this wonderful man of god servant of christ and that we are beneficiaries and recipients of this great deposit of truth placed in the storehouse of the holy spirit god's bank of heaven upon which we can draw and be blessed within our hearts and souls o praise god forevermore amen what do we have that we have to hold faster we have not just the bible not just the message but god has given us his on the unfailing reality of understanding the revelation of the word of god for our day and we are so thankful to god for it amen hallelujah while others are wandering and some are wondering why others are quibbling analyzing debating some are lowering standards changing standards changing the word denying the word i want to encourage you on this glorious evening to hold fast as he said till i come called to god's unchanging hand called to the revelation from the word hold to the rock beneath the rock that we might be stabilized that we might my friends just be made to a place where we have the true spiritual steadfastness and balance that is necessary and needed in this message that we don't go to the left or the right from formalism to fanaticism but that we go straight down the middle of the road of course we are fanatics because we are fanatics of the revelation of this word because we have been to that holy ghost attic of the little room and we have caught the revelation of this last prophet's message and it has set her soul of fire by the anointing of the holy spirit that's the reason why we're here tonight to give god glory and honor for this burning shining light of the word of god that shines and illuminates our pathways oh thanks be to god coming soon we know he's coming quickly amen and we know that because we know that we are now living in the end of the end times amen not only are we in the end times but we are in the ending of the end times hallelujah and that's why he says hold fast to what you have and let no man take thy crown hallelujah and i said what do we have what does the elect have they elect not only have they written word but they have the unwritten word not only do they have the intellectual understanding of reading the word of god passing the word of god analyzing the word of god debating the word of god and going into all kinds of partials you know divisions of the word of god but having the reality revealed to you until you are speechless you can not so profound yet so simple that you cannot even put it into human words or uh explanation it you can't speak it because it's not allowed and it cannot be for it must not and cannot be impersonated oh praise god if we could express all of it if we could put it into english terms or whatever language then the devil is so wise having thousands of years of wisdom above the human being without god oh my he would quickly be able to take that and turn it into his kind of so-called enlightenment and reality to deceive even millions more so god has to bring his people into the little room and there make known to him to them himself oh thank god forevermore so in this end time with earthquakes with fires with floods with all manner of trouble and strife and war amen that's when jesus comes that's when the prince of peace comes hallelujah and with his scrumming he's bringing a resurrection hallelujah he's bringing a rapture glory to god amen because you know there must be a rapture first for paul tells us in the bible we who are alive amen the they that are dead and are asleep will be raised up by the hand of god and we who are alive will be raptured while we are yet alive by god's divine design and process we shall be raptured into the very presence of almighty god amen praise god those who are in the dust will be raised up and those who are alive are waiting for his return for for his return will be caught up into the presence of the lord hallelujah and we are caught up the bible says be given crowns glory to god hallelujah amen why why where are we going to be given crowns because we are sons and daughters genuine sons of god and daughters of the living god not because we say so because he vindicates it so and he sanctifies it so he stamps his approval he puts a crown on our head he's given he's giving us a chariot ride to glory divine transportation then he gives us a crown upon our head all glory be to god hallelujah amen and makes us kings and priests unto god hallelujah that we may reign with him that we may rule with him in righteousness for the glory of god hallelujah that is the promise to all those who suffer with him bear his reproach carry the earthly shame in bearing his name and baptism and walk and talk and action in life we bear his name and because we suffered with him we shall reign with him hallelujah praise god glory to his marvelous and wonderful name o praise god hallelujah amen all those who have perseverance persevered with him in the words of the bible those who endured patiently the word of his patience hallelujah knowing that god who is a just judge as abraham his servant asked one time shall not the judge of the earth do right oh praise god god promised to reward us and here he is his promise to his own o blessed be the name of the lord that be gay because you gave your all for him because we gave our all for him and to him glory to god and committed ourselves to him and to his servants he said that will sit down with him in his throne and share in his glorious kingdom what is he saying i'll bring you beside me as the queen amen to sit on the throne share my authority share my throne share my glory share my eternal being o praise god forever hallelujah thank god for this promise this mighty promise that he has made to his own and as we say in these immortal words of the prophet we are resting on that hallelujah we are resting on that hallelujah praise god hallelujah many many men amen we are to hold fast because god has given us a word for this time for each church age has a word has a promise meant for that day and we can't mix up those various promises and various words given to the church ages and to this specific church age was given these promises these blessings and he's saying hold fast hallelujah to what you have your promise recognize your day the message for your day and hold fast to the word that you have received for this day hallelujah persevere in holding on don't give up no matter what testing trials fiery furnaces burning deserts no matter how hot the sun how thirsty you may get hold fast till i come he's coming he's coming soon praise god hallelujah amen praise god amen don't give up but do what put on the whole armor of god dress yourself from head to toe with the word of god the whole word all of the word from genesis to revelation it is not enough for you to say oh the prophet knew that or the prophet brother branham had that revelation oh praise god that was and it still is his revelation but what you are to do is to let the spirit give you a revelation of what he had where it came from what does it mean to you that you can say like paul now i've caught it hallelujah for the lord himself on the night he was betrayed said unto me and he related everything that happened in that supper room that upper room that supper room and he related it with authority because the lord himself revealed it to him that's the way it has to be friends each one individual salvation individual revelation this magnificent glorious operation that is ongoing right now while the holy spirit moves within the hearts of true believers wake up shake yourself come out of your sleep oh my that sleep that you're in drugged by sin damned by the devil dancing with the devil my friends wake up shake yourself come out of it salome come back to the word recognize the savior jesus christ recognize your lord jesus christ and walk with him so that you will stand there by the cross and give glory to his glorious name o praise god forevermore put on the whole armor of god pray seek god empower every gift within your life to his use and for his glory use every weapon of the spirit of god to defy the forces of darkness and repel the darkness and the smoky fogginess that may be around us glory to god hallelujah and use every gift that is at your disposal to look ahead with joy with expectation with the love of god within your heart oh praise god that you can recognize you are in the beloved you are within the boundaries of the word of god and of the formation of the bride class of saints that came from his sides oh goes back to his side stood by the word amen back then and now she's back to his side standing by the word oh praise god forevermore oh my but thank god he says i'm not only going to give you crowns i'm promising you a crown or promising all of you crowns but also listen to the word of god you will be made pillars in the temple of my god hallelujah he's speaking to his bride he's speaking to his wife pillars in the temple of my god hallelujah of course jesus spoke of his body being the temple amen it was the temple of god and now we are the bride female part of that body he was the head and is the head of that body and for many centuries that body lay without a headship oh but thank god the capstone has returned the headship has come back god's preeminence and sovereignty taking charge and taking over the lives and hearts of true believers glory to god amen and now we are his body the true church the true wife the true believer be in the temples of the living god hallelujah and he is going to make the overcomer a pillar in the temple of of god what is a pillar a pillar is actually a part of the foundation part of the overall super structure hallelujah thank god we must believe we are a part of the super structure that we are a part of the foundation now that would be another topic but just to give you a glimpse what is the foundation of the pyramid what is the foundation the foundation is jesus christ himself being the foundation as the bible tells us our faith is not built on this sense shifting sands of man's opinion but our fate is based upon him on the unchanging unmovable word of god his own person just like he swore by himself to abraham now he comes and for makes us a part of that foundation and that foundation is himself jesus christ the word and we are a part of that foundation the word he is the word she is the word o glory be to god on high he who raised that body jesus from the dead hallelujah now is about to resurrect and rapture his pride from out of the graveyard of this earth back into glory into his divine presence hallelujah to him we give praise honor and glory here blessed be the name of the lord amen amen and that puts watch this the bible tells us the foundation is made up of jesus christ and the apostles but now he's saying that i'll make you pillars in the temple of my god and let me say this quoting directly from the prophet of malachi 4 5 william marian branham praise be to god that puts us puts the overcomer right in with them apostles and all them prophets that went before for it says so in ephesians 2 9 to 19 to 22. now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets you see up to that time it was the apostles and prophets but now he is showing us our identification and showing us where we come from where we're going back to as part of the original superstructure in the foundation as pillars of the temple of my god in whom all the buildings fitly framed together grew it unto a holy temple in the lord in whom you also are builded together for a habitation of god for a temple for a habitation a house of god through the spirit hallelujah praise be to god amen of course a pillar speaks of strength it speaks of stability immovability that is why even in foreign lands where i might have toured even the all banks the old temples that they built always had sure mighty pillars in the front of it are all around it and this is a symbol even in our modern times certain banks will always put large pillars in front and subliminally it's really speaking to the customers we have stability we have immovability we have the financial strength what god is saying by them seeing you they're going to know i have the power i have the glory i have the strength i have your mobility amen you are now foundations pillars in the temple of my god hallelujah amen god is trying to tell the on overcomer you are not going to be like the buildings that were back in the age of philadelphia at that time for philadelphia was an area that was prone to frequent earthquakes buildings would demolish fall to the ground and come to nothing amen but oh thank god we are supporting pillars of the rest of the world for the world has not changed and by our walk our talk our lives reproving the all the immutability the unchanging power of the unchanging god in every age no matter how wicked the age becomes god can always raise up a people raise up a standard that still proves that his word is right and they'll keep in the midst of any storm and hold to his unchanging hand blessed be the name of the lord do you know in solomon's temple and many wise men of earth will understand this in solomon's temple and our bible tells us that it had two main supporting pillars there might have been others but speaking of two main pillars and the bible takes the time to mention these two main pillars and even gave them names one pillar was called boaz another pillar was called jack in hallelujah boyz meaning strength and jacking meaning established oh praise god forevermore thanks be to god that god will give us strength and would establish us firmly within the word of god and to recognize our position in the body as foundation's pillars hallelujah but make no mistake about it the foundation stone and the capstone are the same stone praise god hallelujah you are part to him and he is part of you and together we are one glory to god hallelujah everything has to pass through the door and the door is jesus and jesus is a part of that body or of that temple he is the temple he is the door he is the everything and we are a part of him hallelujah and when god puts a man or a woman in the temple as a pillar and makes him or her a part of that foundation group what is he doing and how is he doing it he is doing it by giving him or her that individual the revelation of the word himself a revelation of the word himself because that is exactly what the apostles and the prophets had amen matthew 16 17 oh he's in the word and he stands in the word and we can't get him out of the word christ is revealed in his own word and he stands behind the lattice work of his word amen looking out at you and many try to peer in and all they can see is a form and the shape but they're still presuming and guessing and they can even say oh it's jesus but they don't have a clear revelation of who he is but i'm so thankful god in the shadows is watching over his own not one will fall to the ground not one given to him and his hands will fail or praise god but every one that was given to him is going back with him right into glory no matter what you think of yourself no matter how you feel about yourself no matter if you feel you're unworthy oh thank god paul said even if your own heart condemns you god is greater than your heart hallelujah and this word revealed to you makes you become firm and stable recognizing that you're a pillar in the temple of your god who is he that overcome it who is he that overcome it he that is a part of jesus christ he that is a part of the revealed word for jesus christ himself is the overcomer how can we overcome and the answer is by him who has already overcome greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world glory to god hallelujah so we are a part of him that's how we overcome oh praise god amen jesus is the christ hallelujah alpha and omega amen hallelujah he that believeth that jesus is the christ not a christ but the christ there's only one christ jesus one person one anointed one hallelujah and that is why we baptize in no other name but in the name of jesus christ for we know father is not a name son is not a name holy spirit or holy ghost is not a name they are titles the name is jesus christ hallelujah and be baptized in his name hallelujah god is talking about his bride here now i read this scripture on sunday and i read it again to you for reinforcement and for divine understanding revelation 7 14-17 hallelujah and i heard the number of them which were sealed and there were 144 000 that were sealed of the tribe of jew of the tribes of the children of israel oh thank god it doesn't mention gentiles amen being sealed into this number of 144 thousand that is absolute false doctrine and nonsense for anyone to teach that gentiles claiming that their witnesses is jehovah and so they are the 144 thousand that will be sealed nonsense it is not in the bible on scriptural for it tells us clearly of friends and emphatically that of the tribes of the children of israel of the tribe of judah twelve thousand tribal reuben twelve thousand seal twelve thousand tribe of god they were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of asher there were sealed twelve thousand the tribe of nephthalim or were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of manasseh was trill twelve thousand of the tribe of simeon the seal twelve thousand of the tribe of levi were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of issachar were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of zebulun were sealed twelve 000 of the tribe of benjamin were sealed twelve thousand and after this i be held and lo a great multitude now we're talking about the gentiles now amen hallelujah we're talking about all that will be included and here comes 144 000 from amongst the jews now he's speaking of the gentile bride oh praise god and lo a great number which no man can number of all nations all kindreds and people and tongues all stood before the throne before the lamb clothed with white robes they couldn't have white robes unless it was given to them by him hallelujah unless they were robbed with it so they can be in the wedding supper or in the bride's chamber in the throne room for the glory of god hallelujah and palms in their hands crying with a loud voice saying salvation to our god hallelujah they're calling the lamb their god salvation unto our god which sitted upon the throne and unto the lamb amen and all the angels stood around about the trump throne and about the elders and the four beasts now watch it 144 000 the multitude of the gentiles representation 24 elders all praise god 12 apostles 12 patriarchs and the four beasts powers from the presence of almighty god fell down before the throne on their faces and worshiped god saying amen blessing glory wisdom thanksgiving honor and power and might be under god forever and ever amen and one of the elders and saying unto me what are these what are these which are a red in white robes and whence came thee and i said unto him sir thou knowest and he said unto me these are they who wash their robes and came out of great tribulation not the great tribulation but they have come out of lines of great trial testing trouble tribulation trespasses temptations they have overcome these are they who have come out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb all nothing but the blood hallelujah o has washed us clean and white as snow amen praise god therefore our day before the throne of god and as the wife serves the husband and because this represents the bright glass of saints and serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitted on the throne shall dwell amongst them they shall hunger no more neither thirst anymore neither shall the sun light on them oh nor any heat hallelujah the heat that the devil would have brought against you is gone there will be no heat you're not gonna have to worry with heat and pressure anymore because it's gone hallelujah amen oh my for the lamb which is in the midst of the troll shall first feed them and he shall lead them onto living fountains of water hallelujah not dead theology dead water but living water and the gods shall wipe away all tears from their eyes jesus has come brothers and sisters thank god and he has sealed the 144 000. he has sealed the 24 elders the four piece and the multitude which no man can number hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah this group doesn't belong to the 144 000 it's a multitude that no one could number and the bride is taken from amongst the gentiles they are there before his throne their night serving him as i've said giving having the special care of the lord upon her hallelujah for they are his wife they are his wife amen oh the bride goes wherever the bridegroom is your body goes wherever your headship is or your head leads a man she will never be left by him she will always stand by the words stand by his side amen you will always share the true throne with him he will be crowned with his glory and honor hallelujah listen what the bible says and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god hallelujah the name a name nature name nature the name nature character hallelujah of my god hallelujah well we know the name of the lord jesus christ emmanuel god with us hallelujah amen oh but you see emmanuel was not his given name it was just describing that he would be with us the name he was given you shall call his name jesus for he shall save his people from his from their sins and jesus himself said to the ruling class at that time i come in my father's name and you receive me not now if his name is jesus and he says he comes in his father's name then his father's name also is jesus and of course you know jesus means jehovah our savior jesus means jehovah our savior hallelujah for jesus jehovah of the old testament john 1 the word was made flesh and dwelt among us hallelujah amen in the head form and now in the bright form the word made flesh dwelling among us oh my glory to god hallelujah oh praise god amen yes sir so it will be the same name that we he will give to his bride his wife and his name is jesus she will be mrs jesus clothed in the purity of the righteousness holiness and wholesomeness of the whole armor of god jesus christ revelation chapter 21 1-4 and eyes john saw i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away oh my all your old-fashioned old whirly stinking thick in the rottenness carnal everything else have passed away and knew of that first heaven passed away and the first earth that you live on and lived in that already passed away the old body best house prison house passed away oh glory to god hallelujah and there is was no more sea you know what is telling you no more separation no more distance you're back in fellowship you're one with him you're one with the word one with the rest of your brothers and sisters in christ not by convention not by any human thing like that but the invisible union of the bride and christ hallelujah glory to god brought back and i saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned from for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men the what the temple of god amen god is now living in man the same house he told solomon he says are you going to build me a house i'm going to build my own house and he has built his house through seven church ages built his house and now the roof praise god of the capstone comes down upon that house for his glory and for his honor blessed be the name of our god hallelujah to him be glory might and honor forever and ever listen behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he shall dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death death will no more have any tyranny fare over you in any way neither sorrow no more partings amen no more not crying neither shall there be any more pain for the old earth has passed away oh praise god for the former things are passed away how wonderful all of god's promises fulfilled in his precious word the change that we have all spoken of will then be completed you will have total deliverance not a partial salvation not a one-third redemption but you will have possessed all of the land and come into a state of total deliverance from earth to glory into the presence of the living god the and his bride settled in all the perfections of god all praises marvelous name hallelujah who is able to do that god himself think about it dream about it read about it hallelujah for the word says so amen oh we can only know a small tiny infinitesimal part of it but it will all become a reality in the rapture and the first resurrection and i will write upon him as i am closing my new name upon him hallelujah amen just as a man gives to his wife his name claims her as his own jesus is saying here i will give them my new name hallelujah when all things things become new you will take upon him a new name and that name will be the name of the bride also as it was in the beginning so shall it be in the end world without world without end hallelujah not earth but world without and amen for in the beginning the bible said and he called their name adam amen why the two were one but after the covenant was broken covenant of innocence was broken then adam and eve oh god have mercy hearing the word of god he said now i restore the whole thing back it's finished he writes upon her his new name a man claims her as his own oh my what that name will be we can't guess we can't presume we do not know but we know it's illustrious it's wonderful oh my hey praise god hallelujah it would have to be a revelation of the spirit given to us individually and conclusively and none would dare that none will dare to deny that that revelation is in you on you through you oh praise god all over you praise his wonderful name and no doubt he will leave that revelation to the day when he desires to give forth his name suffice it to know hallelujah it'll be a wonderful time for you and a wonderful time for me he that had an heir to hear let him hear what the spirit said or is saying to the churches o praise god every age ends with the same warning for in every age there is an elected few that were given heirs given eyes given their supernatural ability to receive and understand the word of god hallelujah or praise god and so god is crying out to all of the church to listen to his voice yet he knows only a few are going to hear and understand and receive it but he still cries out whosoever will may come whosoever will come come amen but what an elect few only a few that make up a part of his body one in a million hallelujah oh praise god but in this particular age that cry is even more insistent because this is the end of the end of the end it all closes off here the angel raises hands to heaven one with the open book you're gonna either take and receive from the open book or else time runs out time shall be no more the seven ages and their messengers their time is over now the mighty messenger from heaven takes charge and unveils his mighty unveiling of the word of god to hearts and lives of his people oh praise god forevermore oh this age is a short age the shortest age and that is why in this age we must have a short quick work of consummation hallelujah amen because we know with time a thousand years is as a day so this age will be like a an hour or two hours with god oh we think it's long but in the eyes of god it's just like two hours or go by like that and so he must warn with all urgency and his voice must continually sound forth into the hearts of his beloved oh be ready be ready for he is coming soon be ready be vigilant be watchful for jesus is coming soon oh yes but there are many voices in the world many that will delude distract and destroy and take you away from the word of god if you are not one that is anchored oh by the rock beneath the rock anchored by the foundation stone anchored by day o the key stone that was laid within you from before the foundation of the world you'll be swept away by the voices of man and by the tides of time but the holy spirit is here to comfort the elected you'll be kept by the power of god true faith in his word revelation in his word oh my oh so many problems crying for our attention brothers and sisters but there will never be any other voice so clear to us for when your name is called doesn't matter if there are a thousand voices around you when your name is called my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow and they hear me and they answer oh thank god hallelujah we'll hear his voice amidst all the confusion and chaos of the various voices around us and recognize who is calling us it's not a man calling you amen i may be standing here preaching the word i'm not putting the pulsation within your heart i'm not putting the pull within your soul that's the living god hallelujah that moves you this is a living god that quells your turbulence of your spirit and brings the peace of god right over your soul the most important voice that you will ever hear is the voice of god through his word by the holy spirit calling out to you the voice of the great shepherd calling to his sheep for his the scripture says he that had an ear to hear let him or her hear the voice of god of what the spirit is saying for he the spirit is calling out to his brine calling out to his beloved to hear his voice and to come to him hallelujah all my friends it's just about home time jesus is standing at the door glory to god hallelujah he's standing there with open arms to welcome us to our heavenly home oh praise god as a song i was listening to yesterday says some call it heaven some call it paradise but i call it home god bless you my brothers my sisters may we go our ways rejoicing in the lord for that time is at hand god bless you [Music] you
