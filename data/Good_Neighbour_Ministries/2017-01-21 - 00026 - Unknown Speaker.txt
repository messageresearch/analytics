========================================
more often ones who have had a bad relationship with their fathers why is that because they've lost acceptance here they're looking for somewhere else you're looking for another father right another way to speak about that is is remember a preacher one time talking about a dog he beat a dog and eventually what does he do he's always expecting to be beaten right if he doesn't see acceptance he's he's he's always going to C away from you he's always going to run away from you so when when I came to my years of Crisis and my years of Trials as a teenager I couldn't go to my dad I couldn't go to my parents I think I mean I I'm not saying that I'm any different I'm saying it because I think I'm like a lot of other people um so where do you go you go to the world you go to your friends you go to places you can find acceptance and the acceptance you get out there isn't isn't going in a good direction um the people you meet out there a lot of them when people struggle with the need for acceptance at home um you look for other people who are broken like you who don't have acceptance other people who don't have proper attachment and those people are doing all the things that you should all the stuff that you shouldn't be doing and they accept you because you're broken like they are but two broken people don't make a good good relationship and so you get LED astray you do a lot of wrong things I struggled from from a very early age I struggled with uh with depression I was bullied very early in school in fact it was kind of funny from I think I can remember being bullied from grade one um and for some reason I I don't know if it was I don't know what did it but I sort of thought it was a trial of my faith at that time thought you people don't like me because I'm a Believer um I don't think that's a very good a very healthy mindset but um as As I Grew Older that sort of stayed with me but none of the good stuff stayed with me so I I strove for acceptance from my friends and I got into all the bad habits that my friends got into I smoked I drank I tried different sorts of drugs um and none of that was bad stuff actually I got when I when I um both in my later teens when I tried to seek God and even other times in my life to give up the smoking the drink all stuff that wasn't that Hur the thing that got me the thing that I'm ashamed of the thing that's worse in my life is is sex um it started and like I'm not alone in this the the the very first the very first time Zan wanted to get us what did he do in the garden of Ed it was sex what he do with Samson it was sex with David it was sex with Solomon it was sex we and we live in a generation in a time that is full of it we live in a generation where where women are worshiped as not not as women but as sex objects we live in a time where where every teenager is bombarded day in and day out it's worse today than when I was a teenager much worse but bombarded by these things but I discovered pornography when I was I don't know I was pretty young I don't think I was a teenager yet um but I had friends that their parents had the stuff around and and I became I became addicted um and by saying is addicted I'm not trying to downplay I'm not trying to pretend that it's just a sickness it's a demon it's it's a lot of I know but what I mean by that is addiction the way addiction Works in a person a person can be addicted to Li person can be addicted to stealing person can be addicted to many things there's there are neural Pathways in a person's brain that when you're a very small child um there are certain chemicals that are released and certain things that are release when a child is accepted by their parents are accepted by their CBL but a need for acceptance and the same Pathways or the same ones that fire when a person is acting out an addiction usually when a person is addicted they're seeking for some sort of acceptance that's what causes it and sexual addiction of course is obviously going down that so I I sat and and there's things there I don't even want to tell um there things I don't want to talk about because I'm I'm so ashamed of them but like like many other young boys I s um I sought acceptance and I felt that there was for some reason that was the thing that that got me and I did things and I became so ashamed because first of all there's a natural acceptance a natural um um a natural need for foret the word I was using sorry natural need for acceptance so that I wasn't been fulfilled but second of all I was raised in a place where we knew about God it was a spiritual acceptance that I wasn't getting the same the same CS Lewis a great writer says that that the the drunk banging on the door of the B house is looking for God a child needing a teenager needing acceptance not just from his parents but needing to know God knowing that there is a God that he needs to know having somehow felt a need seeing him but then unable to reach out find so you feel driven you feel this need to to a need for a love that you just can't find and so I would I would feel because of the shame of the things I did I would been fall into depression and then the way in which I I felt better about the depression is I would turn to the addiction and then I would feel ashamed and I'll fall back into depression so I ended up in this vicious cycle and I went to this Al my teenage years and and and I twice I tried to commit suicide I mean tried how's a person try to commit suicide well you don't either do it or you don't of thing right the attempt is halfhearted if you really were going to do it it'd be done but the point was I seriously wanted to I seriously you know I I I sat for hours with razor blades I I I held a loaded shotgun my hands wanting to put in my mouth and shoot myself I did as a teenager and these sort of spirits um we live in an age when these things are are rampant out there right where where people Jesus says in when he's carrying his cross of Calvary he says don't week for me he says but a time is coming when they will say first of all blessed are the are the the breast of blessed is the wound that has a BN and S Stu he says when they say those things man you cry for the rocks and the hills to fall on them that's a suicidal Spirit we live in that time we live in a time when when people don't want children and suicide is rampant in our world depression is rampant and and your children are at inured for that these are the spirits the spirits that that weren't so much stronger than they were that that are always this is what the devil wants to get them with he wants to make them ashamed as he possibly can of who they are wants to wants to bring that those suicidal spirits on them and and squash them before they become who they're meant to be he knows that you're people of God he knows that you've applied a token he knows that you have children that are meant to do great things for God all those demons he's not after the people that he's already got out there they're all coming after you and they're especially coming after to the Next Generation cuz if you can get them before they get before they goow into what they're supposed to be right so it's it's uh it's on the one hand being being a teenager raised with with the message of God around you is a great blessing on the other hand you're a great Target so it's a great struggle it's a hard place to be at about age um 16 I had gotten so messed up um I don't think my parents knew half of what was going on but at least they know they knew enough that they knew I needed help uh my dad spoken a few times about me about you know he recognized that I was depressed and they known that I got into smoking and drinking and they they had they had thought that maybe i' been into drugs and stuff um they knew a little bit about the pornography and different stuff I've been into so they thought I needed help my sister at that time I recently moved to Cloverdale BC uh where brother Eddie bisol is the pastor of the church there and they had at least they had a vibrant use group and she did she said look send them out here maybe maybe we can we can help so they sent me out and I decided to stay and I stayed there for while I I moved back to Edington for a few few months but I spent most of my time in overdale um when I got there I just I saw this youth group that was everything that I wanted to be when I was a kid I saw people like um John Andy who's a minister there I was just he's only a couple years older than me so he was about 18 at the time um all Matthew I can't remember his last name just but they were people at that time young people and then all just the youth group in general just people that actually believed right I grew up with youth that just mocked the ministry really mocked their parents now I saw people that really believed or at least they really look like they people wow this is what I want to be this is what I want to be when I was a kid I thought here's a chance and so I put aside a lot of those bad habits and stuff that I had developed um and I felt accepted that was the big thing too it's just there there were people people that that should have been struggling the same stuff I was but they had Victory and on top of that they were accepting them even though I was I was so sick of myself myself and told myself these people really cared about me and so I I I I put aside my bad habits as best I could um like I said traffic smoking drinking it's not that I didn't struggle with it of course especially the the cigarettes those are those things that's a pretty Hur Addiction in itself but but I was able to put those things aside with some struggles um and I spent about I was there for about 6 months and and I was seeking God and I remember one night I I I talked to my sister and she told me about her experience how she had found God and how she felt in in a meeting that God was speaking directly to her I never felt that and and I just I had this feel sense I wanted what they had and so I started seeking God and this one night this the the the message that I don't know what was preached but it spoke to me and I just felt this real need um to to just pray and and see and I stayed there for everybody left the sanctuary I was there for it must have been an hour and I was just there and I didn't even know what to pray I just I knew I needed God finally my sister came and said well do you want me to get a minister she brother Tom Ray um I don't know I'm very familiar with the ministers in but brother Tom ready to come in and pray with me and brother Peter was Aon at the time I can't remember his last name um but anyway they came they sat they prayed with me and after they prayed with me but the time said me he said you know now when you feel that presence starting to get away from you so going into your closet your little prayer closet praying closer I mean that's great advice and I had felt something I felt a great need but I I I hadn't had a breakthrough I hadn't really felt that I met God in any way but I thought I was supposed to have so I left the the service and somebody asked me what had happened sort of stuff and I gave and I mean this is something probably should be ashamed of more I lied about my conversion I said that things happen that didn't happen I cobbled together testimonies that I he from other people stuff about God's know God's feeling like God was speaking directly to me and these sorts of things and u s and sort of sort of said that you know I met God that was it but it wasn't I had really had anything I knew I needed something but I had really so at the end of about 6 months I I I came back home Toth land and I went back I ended up in Evon for about three or four months I had some relatives there my sisters and and one of my brothers lived there so I went there and I I all all to time I sort of stayed in the church and I was trying to act like a Christian I was trying to be reformed to be the kind of person that you're supposed to be and this is the trouble with sometimes being raced as Christian is that you know what you're supposed to do right it's it's not a change because you think you just got to act like everybody else so that's what I was doing and then I I um I had this strange dream one night I knew something was wrong I knew there was something I needed what I do I need to knew what I needed I knew I needed deliver I knew I was still a sinner I knew those demons were still on me especially that last demon and I had this dream in this dream it was at the same time at the Gulf War and in this dream I was uh I was in a building I was on the first floor and I knew I needed to get to the fourth floor but every time I get in the elevator I end up on the seventh floor and I knew I wasn't supposed to be there and I tried to get back to the fourth floor and I end up on the first floor and the first floor at this s wasin and the seventh floor at a sister it was the wife of a pastor from the church um it was not not brother Herold was brother's church but it was under another Pastor sister Pastor was there at the time and and so I couldn't understand every time I went in up down where s hin was he tried to jump on me and when he jumped on me I feel like I couldn't breathe and I knew what that was I knew that had to do with I was still craving cigarettes I know what that was about and it's weird you get these dreams I mean I have all kinds of dreams I dream every night I know the most of it's garbage but then you get dreams and they mean something so much you know what I'm talking about and I knew this dream at so I told uh Brother Martin War my brother my was he's been in for years years years I told him about this dream and he B interpreted for me so well seventh floor and the sisters we for pastor seven means perfection four means Deliverance he said you're trying to get somewhere you're trying to be somebody you're trying to be perfect but you're not going to the steps you're not getting delivered and that made perfect sense but I wasn't ready to accept it it wasn't long after that I uh I ended up in some trouble I I I was traveling with some believer summer and I just did some really stupid stuff I'm not even going to explain what I did but I'm just saying it had to do with with my old demon had to do with sex and I was so ashamed and um and I I I tried again I tried to commit suicide it was one of my my uh my most when I like like my real attempts I went and I got a bunch of um I I I got a about I I came back I gotten into more pornography and stuff I got I got into smok and then this thing happened so I got this bottle of of a big bottle of extra straight T off I took the whole thing uh I went to the store bought another bottle I took all a bit and I went to sleep for I think it was 16 18 hours something and I woke up and I had a no s it I thought I was done I mean you you can't actually commit suicide that way but I thought I seriously thought I was committing suicide I thought I was done um and then I just realized I chained myself and I hated myself I need to get out of there I left I went back to Cloverdale um and there among my friends that I trusted that I gotten that that I had been been trying to fit in with before that that uh that have these great testimonies and stuff I turned back to to being that sort of reformed Christian just you know trying to get by with reform and believing I was okay but not really believing knowing I wasn't okay knowing I needed something and one thing that kept sticking out to me sorry am I am I good for okay let me know when I get close so I can jump to the end oh am [Music] I wow well I got to tell you this one so I was seeking God I knew I needed to be re-baptized this was something that got coming to me um and i i i i u i was seeking God one night and I was praying in front of the fireplace we had this big sing song and I was praying and I sat back in my chair and I was just worshiping God and I knew I was looking for something and I sat back in my chair and I felt like I was going up through this darkness and then I was standing in front of a curtain a big black curtain and I knew I wanted to go beyond this curtain and I was there for about a minute all a sudden I was beyond it and I saw Jesus Christ standing with his hands both hands like this and his face was so I knew it was Christ but his face was so bright I couldn't see what what I couldn't see his expression or any of that I just live was Christ I know he was saying you're accepted and I went and then sudden El back beyond that G again and that was an incredible experience and I felt so alive and I went out with some brothers that day and I testified about it and I was so happy and everything was so great and still I failed after that I knew there were things that I needed to do and one thing I knew I needed to do is I needed to know I needed to really repent I needed to get rid of those demons I needed to be delivered and I needed to be re baptized because when I got baptized I didn't know what I was doing I didn't know what it meant to confess the scripture says confess repent to be baptized I didn't know what it meant to repent but I couldn't do it because of Pride um because of Shame and I just I I just didn't and I fell away for 20 years I struggled and the reason I'm saying that the reason point that is because there's one thing if God is telling you to do something do it I I fell away in the worst possible way I went into some of the worst possible sin after that I messed up relationships in my life I messed up of everything I could think of I got so deep into devian and and and just everything that I shouldn't have been doing all because I couldn't make a commitment here was Christ standing saying you're accepted but I couldn't just make a commitment and give a public testimony to say by repentance and baptism that I accept Christ and because of that I ended up for 20 years wanding before I got back here and some of you saw me get baptized here in the tank that was my step back there's a lot more that I wish I had time to tell I knew this was going to happen because I'm a motor Mouse once I get Talking um I wish I could say it all but let me say this this church brother morning when came and brother John Simon have as instruments of God and put me back in a time that I wanted to be on a long time ago I'm very very thanful

back safely amen and I'm talking about all the churches all around because I know believer smaller churches gone Here There and Everywhere else and they need to be covered by the blood in this mad and terrible time that we are living in all kinds of things are flying around and only the grace of God will see you through so let's trust him and believe him and give him honor and glory in all things now um what I have to do here is bring a bring a short word of God and then we're going to have the Lord's supper and after that um hopefully that uh we will have some time to uh be able to search our hearts talk to God Amen and allow God to speak our hearts and I trust that the Lord Jesus will do something for us I'm going to take for a scripture tonight Isaiah 43 18 to [Music] 199 let's stand and read the scripture remember you do not the former things neither consider the things of old behold I will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall you not know it I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the Des no matter how terrible the world he's going to make a river in the desert and streams streams in the desert and rivers in the wilderness amen so so we're not going to lack anything so don't look at what's going on in the world out there and let that get you overwhelmed or things are going bad that's happening that's happening if we don't care what's happening out there why Jesus is coming a doesn't matter what happens Jesus is coming the whole world is sinking and falling apart Jesus is coming and he said behold I make all things new let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for the opportunity of serving you and being called the sons of God born again by your spirit and we pray tonight father that you will speak to us by and through the word that we may enter the new year as better people with the intention of going higher and deeper in every way and to bring glory to your name amen we ask this in Jesus name amen and amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen now um just before I really get into this let me make some of my my own comments at Le I think it's my own comments but I want to encourage you all in this new year to listen to the voice of listen for the voice of the holy spirit cuz God is always talking he always talking to man but most of the times we either don't hear his voice or we don't recognize because God is always talking to us and he speaks in so many ways and because of that uh we we fail to get what God is trying to tell us so I want to encourage you in this new year to listen to the voice of God when he is trying to speak to you now he may speak to you through the word either by your reading your Bible as some of you know that you have something in your mind you go and you open the Bible and there is your answer right there yes nobody could make that up no there is no priest nobody could do that only the holy spirit that was the voice of God speaking to you but the devil will tell you it's by chance oh it's just you know it just happened and dismiss it as if it's not something Supernatural you must recognize when you're hearing the voice of God and when you recognize it and follow what God is saying to you praise the Lord hallelujah amen God will speak through the word while you're reading the Bible he'll speak through the word right off the bit sometimes yes sir amen sometimes the preacher will say exactly what you were asking that's right to the point where you you think somebody came the preacher and somebody did was the Holy Spirit amen but that's how God speaks and we must listen for his voice other words when you come into the service don't just sit there looking around at the ceiling and and watching and this and looking at that listen for the voice of God and hear what God is speaking what are you listening amen God will speak to you also through the spirit of your mind in other words through your thoughts through your Sanctified conscience yeah that's been washed by the blood of Christ every one of us has passed through that where uh you're just like that and you're wondering what should I do I don't know in this situation or or should I go or should I not go should I do this should I do that and a thought we call it will come to you and say why don't you do this and then you push it aside and you go ahead and did whatever you felt you wanted to do and the next thing you know uh when when you you ended up in the wrong end of it you say oh my God I should have listened to my thoughts it wasn't your just your thoughts you should listen to God speaking through your conscience and speaking through you sanctify your mind amen and that's what God wants you to know that's what I I want to encourage you to be a little more sensitive to the Holy Spirit and not just be rushing around and when God is speaking you can't hear you're not getting quiet enough where the Holy Spirit can speak to you and reveal himself to you and tell you what to do so God will speak through your mind God will also speak through circumstances you want to do this and then he'll block you and then you're getting mad that you're getting blocked or or or you obstructed not knowing God is trying to stop you because he has something better is that right he has something better that may look good to you but God knows best one song writer said the Lord will choose for me in be better far I know so let him B me go or stay amen so circumstances sometimes we wake up in the middle of circumstance and realize oh that's the Lord telling me no don't go forward praise the Lord You're just about to sign on the doted line and something in you said and you don't know why and you stop right there but you got to listen for the voice of the holy spirit amen simply God is working through Simplicity God will you got to listen to God's Voice through strangers Yeah because sometimes we think oh we are Christians so God will only speak through our fellow brothers and sisters God can come with one of your sinful relatives my God and speak to they don't care what you think all stuff you just tell you what you feel God use somebody like that tell you right to your face and if you want to fight they ready right amen because and they don't know God is using them but God can speak true uh unsaved a relative of yours but you know recognize it because familiarity brings contempt oh I know him he's my C he being a drinker he being a this he's being a that he's done this and that and all that blinds you from hearing the voice got to Listen for God's voice oh oh that can't be the voice of God because that man is a sinner you know he's not born again well look I I remember witnessing to a young Hindu uh um gentleman um who became later on he got converted became a pastor and I heard just two or three years ago had a big Ministry in the United States and then he passed away but the fact is I was sharing with him what we knew then when the message first came one God his name is Jesus Christ you need to be baptized in the name not father Son and Holy Ghost and and this sort of stuff and then he said because he was going to a Bible to the Bible school I had come out and he was going and said well what about but Jesus was on the cross and and said the father into thy hands I command who was he speaking to
