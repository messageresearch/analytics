TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good wednesday evening my good friends may the lord richly bless you and may he take praise honor and glory over this entire service let us turn our attention to the word of god with thankful and grateful hearts that he hath given himself to die for us to be our substitute so that he may cause his word to become so real to us that we may understand what it is that he has done is doing and will do at the time of the consummation of the ages may god bless us all welcome into his divine presence as the word of god goes forth receive it into your heart and may that word of god live forevermore last wednesday we spoke on or about the harlot jezebel and how she seduced the servants of god to commit fornication fornication of course worship of id idols or idolatry seducing enticing and even forcing some to enter into the worship of idols and for this we read the scriptures revelation 2 reading from verse 20 notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman jezebel which call it herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed onto idols and i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he who search at the reins and hearts and i will give unto every man every one of you according to your works praise our god our righteous father we thank you for the leadership of your word may your great holy spirit now move upon the waters father move upon our hearts and let your word come to life so let it be in the name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen praise god hallelujah this topic of course will be sentence against the harlot sentence against the harlot now of course this woman that woman jezebel this church a woman of course represents the church this unfaithful unrighteous unclean adulterous woman according to the word of god god is saying i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation we are now god is showing to us that this woman will do these unrighteous unclean acts but at the end of it all at the end of his patience god is saying i will arrest her i will stop her in her tracks right now she seems as if she's just going along having her merry way and no one seems to be able to stop her or arrest her a bring her to her senses of what she is doing but god is saying but i i will cast her into a bed i will arrest her just imagine this evil woman this unclean red light district person arrested by god and brought to the high courts of the universe that she might not tried for the evils that she has done the sins she has committed the wickedness that she has encouraged all my friends what what a picture to see this woman in her scarlet robes in the beauty of the world the world's style of beauty haughtiness dignified pride and arrogance but suddenly she is handcuffed by the holy ghost she's arrested by the angels of god she is brought before the high courts of the universe amen and now evidence is taken against her and sentence is passed by the white haired judge of revelation chapter one here he stands the mighty god standing there and passing sentence upon this filthy harlot church that commits herself to universal crimes she's arrested and she's arrested for her own personal nature of harlotry she's drawn to it she's drawn like a vulture to rotten carcass she is drawn to harlotry she cannot stay at home within the word she cannot stay within the confines of the scriptures but she must go out and commit her crimes because it is her nature and her desire to be a harlot and because of this god promised in his word that he will judge her and sentence her because of this she is not only sentenced because of that but the bible calls her the mother of heartless amen the mother of harlots think of it this woman has children the scripture said i will kill her children with death this harlot has children and god is saying sentence is passed against her for being the mother of harlots what is the sentence for not just bringing forth harlots but encouraging her daughters and her children into the same system and organization and pattern of harlotry that way my friends god passes sentence against her because of her encouragement seduction and enticements an example to her children and drawing them into this same pattern of her harlotry now you must remember we say today uh uh i'm remembering now of some person in los angeles california that was arrested and brought before the courts for she was a madame that influenced young women beautiful girls brought them in and brought them and appeared them along with rich men whoever will pay the price now she was called a madame but the bible uses the ancient term the mother of harlots in other words this mother of harlots had a house of our harlotry she had a body house that she kept and stuffed it with a stable of using her own children her own daughters that is an a crime beside your own harmony you're involving your children in the tree also and thus you are called the mother of harlots so she is judged by god for her own harlotry she is judged by god for her encouragement to her children into harlotry amen yes sir this mother of harlots certainly turning them into harlots by encouraging them to do what to denominate or to organize themselves like she organized herself and was able to capture the religious world as rome conquered and captured the then known world by military power and force and a psychology of divide and conquer so she applies that to the spiritual and religious world and she has been successful at it and so she passes this ancient wisdom down to her children and encourages them to use the same blueprint the same pattern and use it you may change the name of it you may give it another label but it remains the same pattern of organization of system and apply it and you'll be able to make lots of money you'll be able to amass lots of wealth right and that also is the path to earthly power she encouraged her children to do this and by doing that by becoming a denomination or to denominate you will gain popularity you will gain worldly respectability despite your harlotry if you follow this pattern that you're being given amen and so she encouraged her daughters into this pattern of organizational system and denomination and she caused them to join themselves to denomination so that they may not be just a nameless group an unrecognized group but that they will have a name under which they can find security religious security as lots of women these will seek a form of what is called a covering a security the protection and so to get protection they enter into denomination and they enter under that covering oh messing numbers and in numbers they believe there is strength and by having a name right and name a denominational name they believe it's the pastor to instant respectability they did not achieve it and not accomplish it by themselves but they entered into a denomination to get protection to get wealth money fame power popularity my friends think about it and recognize what god is saying she is the mother of harlots because she is the first organized church on the face of the earth the mother of organized religion the mother of all the various organizational systems that may come out from the minds of men here it is my friends and the first one to break out as we know was martin luther or the lutherans the lutherans broke away but history tells us that did not completely break away they had a part of the word and so uh luther and the lutherans continue with their candles continued with certain forms of catholic warship and they continued on though they had a part of the word but they were the first to break away but they continued some of that original pattern out from them later came the methodists and the methodists themselves went a little further but they maintained or retained many of the all practices patterns and ways of worship and organizing of themselves by certain patterns so the methodists also came to that then out of the methodists came the protestants of course i can't outline all the various groups because from the lutherans came out a whole bunch of various groups and out of the methodist came out another set of various denominational groups and we go on that way and now narrower to our time out of the methodists came the pentecostals of this day and of this hour and out of them came out many organized groups that went out at this particular time amen yes sir and one after the other amen praise god and organize themselves hallelujah but i want you to thank god the it's the word has gone through its cycle and the seed that was planted has come back to seed again after being planted in the ground and now there will not be an organization that will make it to the rapture but it will be the seed life of god in bright form that will be taken in a rapture according to god's word amen this woman stands before the great judge of the universe her case is being tried the judge of course is the word of god and as you know we will all be judged by the word of god no church will be judged by any other church's doctrine or teaching we will not be judged by any church and sickly holes bulls or whatever they want to propound so it may sound good in our heirs we will not be judged by that but we know from our bible god has said the world will be judged by the word of god so the word of god is the judge why let him let god's word be true and a word or doctrines or teachings or whatever be a liar in the sight of the living god oh judged by your word by god's word hallelujah this woman stands before the living word not just the bible shall argue you to death with the written word of the bible but standing before the judge himself does this woman my friends as she stands there what is her plea she's asked what do you plea as any criminal or any arrested person is asked what is your plea i gave her a space to repent but she did not repent god says in his word what is this woman's plea are you guilty or not guilty what does she plea what else do you expect this woman please that she is not guilty she does not cry out to the great judge asking him for mercy she does not falls upon his grace and asked him for forgiveness no sir this woman is in a died in the wool her left in her heart in her nature in our ways all my friends and now she even protect before the judge she's killing a state of rebellion she protects her innocence enter the filth after the rottenness after the fornication after the adulteries with kings and great men of the earth and all kinds of false gods false teachings idolatry persecutions insurrections inquisitions all of that and she still pre-protects her innocence and stands and proclaims puberty oh my friends think of it she thinks because she robes herself with white because she paints her cathedral's white paints the outward part of her body white god isn't looking just at the dress he is not looking at whether you dress up as a bride god not the heart this is the judge who knows the intent and the motivations of the heart oh praise god the omnipotent omniscient all-knowing god who cannot fail who cannot lie but stands by the word for he himself is the word amen yes this woman puts up a one whale claiming her innocence claiming how pure she is to him the word claiming her honesty she's claiming her kindness in putting up children's schools orphanages uh uh bread you know food baskets and feeding the poor and and charity taking care of so many in various areas building hospitals and everything else outwardly that is fine that is man looking at it that way but this is the great judge of heaven the god of the universe looking and seeing the deeds behind the words and behind the appearances this great judge sees it all and knows it all as she protests her innocence and talks about her honesty and about her kindness in feeding masses around the world in all my friends she protests this innocence and calls for support that multitudes billions of people from her wrecks will come to bear witness great men of this world wise men of this world influential men of this world will come and argue on her behalf about her goodness her innocence or honesty and so on her purity it will speak and they will speak for her human and protest uh her arrest before this great judge of the universe but here she stands still manifesting secretly that same ancient cruelty that has always been in within her heart she refuses the headship of her true husband the revealed word of god she wants nothing to do with the revealed word she rejects his word she rejects his person of one god she will not accept one man within her life the word of god made manifest amen she looks to this multi-dimensional world out there all my friends oh while claiming that jesus the word is our founder and her husband yet she turns around and rejects him and rejects his word she maintains her truthfulness while spreading and propagating religious lies and various uh denominational artifices around the world around the entire place oh my friends she claims she has never and has not been unfaithful to the word and while she is saying it while this woman is still having so-called worship and services and and you know taking what she claims is the word of god while speaking like that my friends carrying within her church body satan's seed satan's seed now forming in the swelling ranks of her the numbers that she carries within her church body within that body something is taking form and is not the form of the stature of a perfect man christ the word she that thing has taken the form of the image of the beast yes carrying certain seed telling lies propagating absolute stuff that is absolutely contrary to the word of god there's only one god and his name is jesus christ not three gods one god there's only one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus hallelujah or blessed be the name there's only one true form of water baptism and that is to be what the apostles thought what the apostle preached what peter thought it has not changed it is in the bible baptizing them in the name of the lord jesus christ one god one name one mediator she speaks my friend in total opposition to that which i have just declared out of the word of god while carrying satan's seed in her that is being forming itself right now as i speak into the image of the beast and not in the image of the word and so acumenism is coming because she is calling out to her daughters to come back to mama come back home let us be one let us tend together as one and resist this judge and resist this sentence that is about to be passed against me yes sir i see here my friends this great evidence we cannot ignore it any longer for the swelling of the numbers of our church body tells us that she has and she is carrying the seed of satan within her which will produce nothing less but that beast-like spirit that is the spirit of cain that killed his brother abell that's why we know she'll repeat it again and over and over again for it is a nature upon of her it is a spirit of satan upon her and she must do it and all those that join themselves to her all those who take her pattern all those who denominate all those who organize with the systems of man of satan and of the world they will come that's why god said come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins amen yes sir we see it clearly in the word of god amen yes here we find friends that as the church goes into idolatry and refuses to take the headship as many women of this modern age will refuse the hateship and leadership of their husbands either because they have better education maybe they have more money because they may be wiser they may be more gifted but god still says that she should be subject to her husband amen she can give him the best advice she can guide him she could tell him this or that and how to go about things like that but she still ought to know how to humble herself and to be a godly dignified loyal fateful woman that is modest in every way and carries her herself loyal faithful true and pure to her husband and to the word of god if a woman is not true to her husband then she becomes an adulteress oh my friends and what will the punishment of this harlot and her daughter's be what will it be first god said i will cast her into a bed amen what bed the bed of tribulation what that means number one god is saying her punishment will be that i will cross her to mr rapture the glorious event that we all with great expectation waiting on the coming of the lord when jesus himself will descend or hath descended and now to catch his waiting bride away and those who uh postulate those who present themselves that they are the brand that they are married to christ when they have a ring of rebellion instead of us who carry a ring of righteousness and royalty holding to god's unchanging hand and word oh prince club that's why he'll take some and leave some amen yes sir so soon the rapture will come and you'll take the bride out of here but things he promised in his word his judgment will be that he will they'll miss the rapture secondly i'll cast them into a bed of tribulation they'll have to go through the tribulation period sentence against the harlot one mr rapture sentence go into the tribulation period amen yes sir and there to face the the tribulation with all its troubled trials and tests amen then god said not only that i'll put her to death with death england yes sir he'll put her to death spiritually right now it doesn't seem like she is dead spiritually but as the bible said oh she a woman that lives in cities dead while she appears that she's leaving yes she appears that she's prospering she's growing she's living and carrying on but the bible said she's dead jesus put it this way you look righteous you're well dressed oh my but inwardly you're rotten you're stink because you're inside you you carry the history you carry the very residual of dead man's bones oh god have mercy in this world in which we live today may god take these few words make them real and true to you may the word of god break through your consciousness may break the veil of sin of blindness and bring to you the fullness of his word and of his divine presence amen god said sentence you'll go with the rapture you're going to the tribulation and at the end of it all i'll put you into spiritual death amen yes sir oh and why i'll put you to spiritual death what is it you'll die by death think of it amen oh my let them be put to death with death in other words your spread spiritual death then i'll let you die by the same false doctrines and things you were peddling and pushing the same religious dope and addictions that you were propagating and pushing and spreading amen and your mad billions to die by it you'll die by death the very death that you were selling and peddling the poison that you are propagating i let you die by the very poison that you were pedaling and selling indeed we find the principle that evil always destroys itself when a snake is so vicious that it will bite and snap at anything that seems it cannot agree with can it see the light can it see the truth it just has to have a little movement coming against it it's ready to snap and the poison acids of hate comes out of it but this time god said i'll put you to death by death i'll let you kill yourself the snake bites its own tail oh think of it the vicious evil wicked snake bites its own tail poisons its own self like the liar will always be caught by his and whip their own lies for liars will find their pathway into the lake of fire the bible tells us i'm winding this down now how that there were ten virgins five wise and five full foolish amen and this woman will be among those that will run around seeking oil they thought there were virgins all the time that thought they were bride that thought they were ready for the rapture they thought they were ready to get out of here only to they did not accept the word they did not walk with the word and in the word and so in the last moments they're running around trying to find oil hallelujah and then but the wise already had the oil and the crown went out behold a bridegroom comet amen go out to meet him go out to face him go out to stand before him oh my friends amen yes sir but those five my friends five went in to meet the bridegroom and the five stayed out because they had no oil within their lamps and that is certainly what's going to happen while one bride or goes in to meet him and is caught up into the spiritual presence of god or the upper atmosphere or into the air amen the other five will be left out they are left out of the understanding now they are left out of the revival now they are left out of the revelation now and they don't know him now and they will not recognize him then may god help us friends may you be in that number that will recognize him now in the word so that when he comes again you'll be able to recognize him in his divine person may the holy spirit take these few words of just a sinful man trying to live god's life trying to present god's word to you not me look past me but see the word and make this word of god catch within your soul and produce nothing less but the image of jesus christ that you may live now and forevermore may god bless you as we come again this sunday will gather in good neighbor ministries where i will be speaking on the word of god for the day star from on high is still shining may god bless you now and we'll meet again next wednesday here as we continue in this marvelous wonderful enlightening series of the seven church ages god bless you [Music] you
