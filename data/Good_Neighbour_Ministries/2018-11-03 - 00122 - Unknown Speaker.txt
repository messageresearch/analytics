TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] this never will be [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] because themselves that you really truly exist and that he never died into their bodies designed and that he is with us and even though we can't see him hey we didn't know heart revelation I like try to explain just a bit of it with your back towards of us [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] everybody messes going into the bride or interruption that's not so amen you have a better chance bigger rounded that if you already like to see the word go click or the kings of heaven will turn the Padma and you will recognize this is not predicted to become for more people it's not predicted to have the kind of revival the technical it's predicted to become cure until we come to the old age until the last one comes in that's how serious the secret if the word comes to that place amen that's the scripture or over read I think was not that you should be a group I want you to be ignorant I don't want to be blind I try to make all men see if you give cause your relatives and all these people to give us a seat rpm to understand these are all them see what is the Fellowship of the mystery I'm gathering together not conventions nothing meetings that with a lot of music a brother/sister the real fellowship comes around the mystery the revelation of the word of God as Isaiah prophesied in that day the Watchmen on the walls desire to see I they will have to put it on or make it up because it kind of seemed like to receive we can help when you you're describing it when I'm describing if you can't describe two things you to describe the same thing and we love to stand each other clearly because it's not quite magical spending it's by revelation of the word of God how the new drapes the name of the Lord Amen or up to the power and oh that's for the scene everybody was partying and you know very clearly and then you get baptized and walk through the name of the Lord Jesus in the sea we all gave you the prophets message right then raised oh oh eat the same message the same spiritual brother Brendan simply understand he said devil he says some believers some people can eat as much as they want and the other one just eat you know regularly the work and the growing in Christ he says about how even if you feed a cup nearly all the vitamins it's still gonna remain a cup there can't be anything else but if you see them evil that evil is going to be an eagle but the canary will remain canary because that's what's supposed to be so when you sell off babies gonna help later on instead begins to tell you know they go for the hair but that's they are elected because those elected before they you are you told her my other I know you before you were in your mother's womb I have when you are dating right so every day despite election given you children abide lectures you turning you are responsible to hold them in that atmosphere as long as you can until they reach the age of accountability [Music] crackling in because they you can feel embarrassed going to make you feel like you fail not see the word clear it's all by election right from that same father is telling Jacob and Esau and right but at the end of the so clearly we [Music] [Music] follow Christ but many of them it was right for their work or the truth in the wilderness that's before you got to the promise now these things were our examples to the intent that we should not that love that evil things as they also lusted you read the whole country [Music] in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ fully length had given rock and in the first official page let me stop right there you see here most people are now talking about belief [Music] clearly was spirit and you come back again with the state of free moral agency as they were in the garden again [Music] [Music] not be the same now that because we must gather the way looking for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] these two Spears are their real prank purpose is like infiltrators first called every nation of their own spices have gills and the devil has healed all right some are even called to spend time with you because with you and purpose will give true in his briefs but the real purpose is the trying to deceive in life they praise God in the messages any one of those for the glory of the Spirit see all those things locked into those tiny marks amen not realizing that plant the general public sounded the devil looking up at the throne because sums it up in the heavens but he didn't realize that my Dejah lat [Music] [Music] right the God himself the money angel in brother branham speaking up just like when Jesus broke loose breanne and the loaves and the fishes once twice of the time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] part of it is right when you have to read this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] but if the work that is in you doesn't match the workers in their chain [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the property or it's not right right what is mr. Turkle dislocate you know think about that anyway great stuff but that's what they are to divide and to destroy and everything else but we know they are life amen praise God now if you don't wait to need to know it we are sitting in a little bit of the maturity of evil just like how this bride is coming to its maturity [Music] and the work that he's doing is also coming to maturity and the greatest battle ever fought is coumba amen and my job on the job of our godly men is to keep you lined up with war in other words any Shepherd would try to keep that wing in the right direction all right Portugal got some strange known together right some that was a stray away they come to church but they always there together like we talked about and what's so and that we could receive have the opportunity to receive the Holy Ghost in now we understand therefore that only the word [Music] [Music] [Music] we enjoy the benefits of it praise the Lord how we go we went through left but you want to talk about go up there the work is Crockett's and everything else like that physically spiritually amen to open up what we call the prophets message men to karate and went right into the third toe first all evening but we're done in 20 of our second vote is are gonna spirit pretty that movement yes spear right sorry bull bring that ball Amen praise them and that's the one that's god it's gonna quit in this power amen not that we have to get even get for dessert meds anymore because the skin above us by a man but praise God Alleluia is the word wouldn't eat your soul that's the most important thing and the soul does not work with intelligence he said it just believe in life with you you look what my heart is our position first [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] if you look back you would have experienced that in life in a different way rather you just [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] those images we see here work the body then later on when opposes speak to in praise of brother Brandon here [Music] you see everything else [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] wait and that's the way this praise the name of the Lord amen praise God my sister we are recognizing the word himself with this awkward for work could live amen the Sun in the form of us in this thing this raised a loop of course not use there will be more crucifixions amen that's going to take place amen knew that was gonna happen Priska [Music] we are all the rest was mainly history showing the dream [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's still the word inside but he wanted to work Oh [Music] [Music]
