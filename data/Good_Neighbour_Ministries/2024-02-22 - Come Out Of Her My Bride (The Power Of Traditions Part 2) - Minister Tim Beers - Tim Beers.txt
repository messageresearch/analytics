and uh I spoke to them and I said call an ambulance immediately and get them to the hospital and I'm on my way and so by God's grace I was at the hospital with him and you know he wasn't in good shape at all but uh you know we prayed with him and we trusted the Lord we stayed there till almost 2:30 in the morning till all the tests and everything had to be done and they started to deal with his condition long story short he is home he's about 99% he's back up and walking and doing everything that he used to do so I want to give God the glory and I want to thank God for your prayers amen they were kind of surprised at the hospital how he was up and going so quickly you know for 94 years old he was in there shaving himself showering ing everything by the you know they let him go yesterday

um I had no idea I we went to the um men the the Young Men's breakfast Fellowship on Saturday morning I was feeling fine we had a wonderful time we ministered to them um you know there was a good 12 14 young men there that uh you know was a real blessing to see them you know zealous for the Lord praise God and so we're very grateful for that but I went home in the afternoon and I was just finalizing my thoughts and you know my message for Sunday morning and I just started to feel unusual and before you know what I was like Keeling over from stomach pain and then the nausea started and and it was a 20-hour fight that's all I can say it just uh you can't do nothing then I hear my brother on Sunday night he got it the exact same thing he says started with stomach cramps and then he was down and out he was able to throw up I did everything I could to try and throw up let me tell you when you're in that condition you just want to get it out but God's uh Grace got it out and uh and we're so glad that uh we're feeling 98% now by God's grace amen praise God and so I tuned in Sunday service it was a real blessing praise God I thank God for brother Chris for uh uh taking that last

you for your prayers on the weekend there the Saints over there in Petrolia send their greetings to Pastor Dany and all the saints here we really had a nice time there amen this the Holy Spirit just really spoke I can't I don't want to get into everything that happened there but there was weeping and crying and rejoicing and testimony after testimony there so we just want to thank the Lord for that amen so um I I trust it's Wednesday night we're coming here to uh expect something from the Lord amen amen hallelujah one word from the Lord that's all we need I want to continue and get right into the word here I got a lot to say tonight this Bible study so uh going to be reading a lot and doing a lot and whatever the spirit would want amen we want to continue our series on the power of tradition I want to I want to call this uh come out of her my bride part two amen so let us turn to the Book of Revelations chapter we got three scripture readings Revelations 181 then we're going to go to John 8:31 and then Matthew 242 2 Hallelujah we've been talking about um you know the power of tradition everybody remember kind of remember the first uh part well we'll just re recap a little bit and we'll just get right into it amen Revelation 181 and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having a great power and the Earth was lightning with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waed Rich through her abundance of her jealousy and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and God had remembered her iniquities amen let's go to John 8:31 Hallelujah then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then ye are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be Abraham's seed and we never EMB bonish to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever committed sin is a servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed Matthew 24:22 and except those days should be shorten there should no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shorten then if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall rise false christs false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very evil elect let us pray father we thank you Lord for your wonderful word Lord Lord Jesus we can do nothing without you lord we're reporting for service both speaker and hearer father we're reporting to battle because you don't speak about these things and not have a battle father we come against this this Kingdom that Satan has has uh set up here father by Your Word we take the word the truth that has been given to us and the truth shall make us free father come and speak truth tonight lord I can't do it but you can do it father come great Holy Spirit wash Us in the precious blood cover us tonight Lord let us be oh God a wall of fire and a hedge around us tonight tonight Lord from all the fiery darts of the enemy Lord and let your word go forth tonight Lord and let your people be free son of man set free your people tonight and Bride come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ thank you Father for your love grace and mercy in Jesus name you may be seated hallelujah amen we're going to be talking about that Babylon that great we've heard a lot of these things already about uh Babylon system but never been a day where we're seeing it manifest like today prophecies have never been and being fulfilled as it is today and I'm talking about when the prophet spoke it back there amen it's coming to pass Here and Now hallelujah amen and we you see right here my brothers and sisters it's not just a system but it's the habitation of devils and every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird so we're dealing it's not flesh and blood we're fighting against here amen it's not positions that we're fighting against here but it's principalities owers spiritual wickedness in high places it's always been that battle and it always will be that battle and it's always been that same Deliverance that God's people had to overcome in every age that they faced just like it says in the Book of Revelations to him that overcometh to him that overcometh it's always to the Overcomer and we have to be Overcomers in order for us to reign with him in this hour there's no way about it there's no way around it amen Hallelujah and we must know our enemy we must not be ignorant of his devices in order to defeat the enemy you got to know his tactics you got to know his strengths amen you got to know where he's going to hit hallelujah amen Jesus said you'll know the truth and the truth will set you free now we look back at the first service and we see that Jesus when he came we know that Christ was the law amen and the Pharisees and Sadducees and the scribes were there coming against the law they say they were keeping the law but they were coming against the very law that they were trying to keep why they didn't recognize him they didn't recognize that he had come to fulfill the law because of all their traditions because of all their dogmas and Creeds because of their oral law that they created it blinded them to the law himself Christ they blinded themsel it blinded them from the very prophecies in the law that spoke of Jesus to fulfill in that day they could not see it though they studied it though they knew it from back and front and here was standing before them and they couldn't recognize it the very law the living law before them the ones the law that they studied all these years but they created so much Tradition now we're talking about a spirit here the two spirits that have always come down to the end the trail of the serpent amen remember people die but Spirits don't die remember history always repeats itself and we can look back and see that here was Jesus fulfilling the law he had to come to fulfill that law he had to be rejected he had to be rejected he had to be crucified in order for what to fulfill the law to let the old the old Covenant the law the mosaic law to be done away with and then enter into the New Covenant with the New Covenant the New Testament with the church to set it up and it's always been that same way there has to be a rejection there has to be a crucifixion of the truth stay with me Hallelujah now do we realize and greatest battle ever fought there's only really two powers in the whole universe all of our differences between nations difference between each other there's only two powers and two kingdoms and the rest of the little miners are connected either one of those powers and those powers are God's power and Satan's power that's all that there is there's two two Powers here tonight Satan's power of unbelief and deception and God's power of Truth and Revelation that sets us free Hallelujah we are not free completely or indeed until the son of man comes by faith and sets us free we are not free because we believe in the message we're not free because we believe in a Prophet our real prophet of this day those things are good but we are free when we catch a revelation and when the son of man comes to you and reveals to you that's what sets you free that's what sets you free how do you know look at the Pharisees and Sadducees look at them we we be not in bondage we Abraham's seed we in the message we have no sin I believe the message I believe everything we be not in bondage and when the word came to them what did they do he said we not we don't have no sin we're not in bondage to no man but here was Christ the word saying you are definitely in sin in unbelief and you need forgiveness of your sins Hallelujah that's us tonight my brothers and sisters we need to progress in this word and in this Deliverance of this word in this hour amen we need to break the Traditions off of our own lives the cultures of of off of our own lives these spirits that were passed down to us that we didn't want we got to take the word and seek the word in desperation to break these things off of our own lives and not say oh I'm in the message for 30s something years I believe every word of God I know it all you know nothing believe me the more God reveals to you the more you know nothing the more you depend on him the more you surrender to him the more you need him Hallelujah in our lives hallelujah amen wow my voice is getting dry I've been getting attacked all day but let's keep pressing on Amen remember the Bible says come out of her my people it's God's people that has to come out of that Spirit of tradition false doctrines Creeds and from that great that has come down through the church ages and that has come with great power of deception it's us that has to come out of it it's the bride that's coming out he said come out of her my people not the Sinners not the unbeliever but my people come out of her the influence of that Antichrist Spirit moving from church age to church a overlapping and overlapping and coming right into this age Hallelujah that's what we want to talk about part three is going to be right in the message right in the message the open of the Seven Seals was the beginning of Deliverance of the bondage of the great from her false teaching in all her lives about the Bible it revealed her Traditions her dogmas her Creeds was not God's word the Lord Jesus was set his bride free to manifest his life in this last generation 400 years without a word from one Prophet to another he journeyed until the last prophet was Malachi and then there was another Prophet for 400 there wasn't another Prophet for 400 years and then God came on the scene one day he walked amongst them again but their Traditions had so tooken a place amongst them he was a stranger to them let me tell you this is being fulfilled today but not to the bride not to the bride no way this has to take place you order you see an order for the setting for prophecies to take place when when Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive 800 years later there had to be a time and a a season and a place where Jesus Christ would had to come on the scene all the elements amen of the world and the system had to be everything had to be in place to welcome him to welcome his revi his rival to the world so he can fulfill it's the same thing today no different than back then hallelujah but their Traditions took the place amongst them he was a stranger to them the traditions of the fathers had washing pans and a way to groom their hair and wear certain buttons on their coats and their certain Priestess robes one starchy Pharisee and another one sadducee you see and that had taken the place of the word amongst those men until God visited them and he was forign to them oh let me tell you about the traditions in this message wearing of hair skirts all these things amen doing it this way doing it that way so many Traditions man-made interpretations making up things that are not in the word that were never instructed by the prophet of God what is it doing what is it really doing it's blinding them from him as making him Jesus Christ a foreigner to them and not even recognizing it not even recognizing it is happening to them if it were possible to deceive the very elect caught in these Traditions caught in the cultures of this message Hallelujah that taking the place place of the word amongst men may I say this with love going beyond the camp brother Brandon speaking here may I say this with love and respect but to drive it home it's the same thing today it hasn't changed a bit 1964 let me tell you my brothers and sisters Hallelujah it hasn't changed a bit today too it's here if we believe the word of God you have to believe it's here you have to believe it's manifesting because all has to be fulfilled in this day and there's nothing there is no setting no atmosphere that can produce the real bride of Jesus Christ unless this comes on the scene in the midst of her she has to be walking in the midst of her because it's Jesus Christ revealing the hidden secrets to her what are the hidden secrets revealing things that are of this spirit this Antichrist spirit so she doesn't be deceived she will know the truth the truth will be constantly setting her free making her free from all these things even her own self even her own flesh everything even her own sins amen her own weaknesses the spirit of God be setting her free right in the midst of it all two in the bed I'll take one I'll leave one two in the Pew I'll take one and I'll leave one it's happening now in our midst right now in our midst who is this work of any Minister any personality to five this is the work of the Holy Spirit the Angels Hallelujah are are dividing and separating in this hour hallelujah oh glory to God at NAA Council ad. 3:25 the Roman Empire Constantine took over the political control of the church forcing it to believe unscriptural words and embrace Pagan beliefs and Jesus right away immediately at the first church age told them in Revelations chapter 2 I have somewhat against you because these Deeds of the nicadan we can't hit on every foul spirit and every demon but we're going to talk about Nick Ian Spirit here very important very important amongst the Gentiles especially now what does it mean nickel conquer the ly in other words they want to make instead of everyone being holy they want to take away from the leot and make a holy man it's not a holy man or a Holy Hill it's a holy God amongst the people and the L has a part of it we are children there's no great one amongst us how can you have faith when you desire respect for one another or control one another we are all one in Christ there's no big man little man we're all the same we're children of one father and we are children of him 1963 greater than Solomon is here we are not a denomination written mystery Babylon the great mother of abomination the mother of harlots Abominations of the earth what is she she's a and what she is a mother of what she's a mother she had begotten something a mother of Sons of harlots what is a harlot something as a immoral woman what made her immoral her Doctrine her beliefs made her a immoral spiritually speaking Hallelujah she was pretending to be a Christan church but was given out man-made dogmas and here she said that she was the first organization then seems like some organizations come out of her my people dogmas means the doctrine of belief in a religion or a political system the literal meaning of Dogma in ancient Greek was something that seems true think about it in the ancient Greek Dogma something that seems true it's not truth Jesus said said You shall know the truth and it the truth shall set you free not not something that seems to be truth not something that man is and interpret to be truth but you'll know the truth these days in the English Dogma is more absolute if you believe in a certain religion or pH philosophy you believe in its Dogma or core assumption assuming assumption the core assumption you talk about core belief but the dogmas are core assumptions now you're automatically I know you're automatically looking back to the Catholic church but remember that Spirit has entered in brother bram's seen the trail of The Serpent and he's seen that serpent which is that Spirit right there of denomination come right into the message right in here Spirits don't die they're alive we have to recognize what the spirit is saying to the churches what the spirit is saying in this hour hallelujah amen get out of this this this belief that you're okay that you're safe in the message that you're safe in The Message Church get get out of that belief because you fight not flesh and blood amen we're only safe in Christ in the revelation of the word and that comes by a new birth unless a man or woman is born again they cannot see or enter into the kingdom of God in desperation in the token message in desperation when he preached a token message it put him in desperation it'll put you in desperation if your eyes are open to see the two spirits that are manifested in the church today the message I'm only preaching about the Catholic church in the and the here and mystery Babylon to show you where these Spirits originated from and that they're not dead they're still alive amen and to over and to order to overcome we got to recognize them here today Bishops raising up in this message controlling many churches all these things taking place now oh yes what was the first organization the Catholic Church what was the second Luther what was the third Wigglesworth down to Calvin and had come to into agon and the him down to the methodists and the Methodist produced uh Alexander Campbell and out of Alexander Campbell came sa uh John Smith and out of Alexander Campbell came the Christian church and they found that four or five Churches of Christ and all those other little isms ran out then here come the Baptist it had a lot of little pullouts out of the Methodist Church come wesling they broke off five or six times they come another time type of Methodist and they they come off again and they come to the Free Methodist and they come out from the Nazarene and the Nazarene for the pilgrim homeliness and the pilgrim homeliness rate down just a little isms running out of that keeping running down each one of them little starters back there right coming down and what did they everyone do finally wound up in Pentecost and what did Pentecost must do the same thing their mama did been raped back to organize what did it become a denomination walk into one the first thing what's your Doctrine boy comb they'll comb you over with a fine-tuned comb see they'll find out what you are what you believe if you don't believe or don't tally up right with them brother you're excommunicate it right away you don't think like they do you're out you say you're Pentecostal that don't mean nothing you tell me that's not here today you tell me that's not in the message today that same spirit is not here today manifesting itself so if those Spirits are manifesting itself then that Spirit of denomination is here today you don't believe what they believe you don't believe their Doctrine in this message like they believe it you don't tally up to what they believe and come into their group or their movement they'll excommunicate you it's taking place now and manifesting amongst the message right now what is it is it Flesh and Blood no it's principalities spiritual wickedness in high places taking over ministers right now Hallelujah the elevation of a holy man above the Le or congregation was a major sin in the first church these elevated church leaders are called nickel adans Revelations 2:6 but this thou H has that hatest the deed ofation which I also hate in the first church the leaders began pushing down people oh oh my it's not happening today all right let's get the war here hallelujah pushing down people hallelujah church leaders love to be important Revelations 2:15 write these scriptures down that's why I'm giving them to you thou has also them that hold the doctrine of the nickel leans which I hate this is the third Church age between 312 ad and 606 ad Deeds had developed into a Doctrine now now they elevated priests or pastors who officially in charge of each Church a bishop then was elevated to be in charge of the number of priests and pastors by the fourth Church age there were Cardinals in charge of Bishops and artch Bishops but God hates elevating human leadership in the church we must never forget that principle Revelations 510 thou has made us unto our God Kings and Priests us means all of us it's pushing people down that's what that Spirit does it doesn't give the freedom that Christ wants in his church and his people to manifest Fest go back study the book of Acts study the early church study the history and see how they manifest it and see how God prospered them see how they grew and see what Spirit was manifesting amongst them every saved Christian is a king and priest a priest stood between the Jews and God every saved Christian is a priest towards the unsaved because they can lead a sinner to Christ but once that sinner accepts Christ then he also becomes a priest the only one above a priest was the high priest that is Jesus all saved Christians are priests with no other human above them only Jesus is above the priests all priests are equal to each other priests are only above sinners in terms of the kingdom of God Hebrews 3:1 therefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly colon consider the Apostle the high priest of our profession Christ Jesus all kings are equal the only H one higher than the king is the king of kings who is Jesus Mark 10 4245 greatness in the kingdom of God will be of elevated in a complete different way than greatness in the world by the world standard servants are numbered amongst the least because they must take orders from those who have authority over them but in the kingdom of God the greatest is the least in the kingdom and the least is the greatest Revelations 19:16 and he had on his vesture on his thigh a name King of Kings so no Christian is above a Christian this nickel leismo be a Christian you must be saved all saved Believers are Brethren and thus equal no brother in a family is above the other brother they are all equal in the same family of God hallelujah Ephesians 3:14: 15 our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named the entire church is one big family we are all equal sons of God Matthew 12:48 but he answered and said unto them and told him who is my mother Jesus talking here who is my brethren remember they're always trying Lord let me be give my son the right hand give my other son the left hand give them this Authority that Authority always trying to get the upper hand with Jesus in the day and and here he is saying right here who is my mother who is my brethren and he stretched forth his hands towards his disciples and said behold my mother and my brethren for whosoever do the will of My Father which is in heaven is the same as my brother as my sister and as my mother what is this for my brothers and sisters what is this saying is to kill that spirit because that spirit will push people down that's not the spirit of Christ Hallelujah we are brethren we are family of God Amen nobody is better and greater we have different gifts yes we have different portions of Faith but we respect one another and the Bible also says those who are given much is expected much and those who are given amen as a lot and became and God has placed them in the kingdom of God must become the least Hallelujah anybody who's great in the Kingdom will make the other person feel greater than themselves and that's how God runs his body and his church but that nickel Adan Spirit you can see it manifesting and right here by personalities by Ministries by great men holy Amen socalled in this message pushing people down it doesn't Elevate the Bride of Jesus Christ when we start seeing we're family we're one in this together and we join our faith with the right Spirit but we have to get those spirits that has crossed over from the church ages especially the seven Church age out of us hallelujah amen Brotherhood depends on one thing only being part of the family of God and doing his will your position in the body depends on doing his will no part of the body is inferior or below another part the only top position in the body is the head because the body is controlled by the head only the head is above the body parts and controls them this position of the head belongs only to Jesus Christ Ephesians 523 for Christ is the head of the church Christ is our head Hallelujah all of our head he must have the prence in all of our lives in all of our positions he must in order for this word to move and for God's word to manifest in our midst and see growth and see prosperity and see God moving with signs and wonders and miracles in our midst I'm not just talking about healing in the body I'm talking the new birth is the greatest miracle that ever could take place amen God's still calling his elect there might be some out there that have to come in to the body of Christ but God is preparing us for that hour amen hallelujah the Vatican in Rome today resembles this Babylon and there followed another Angel saying Babylon the is Fallen is Fallen that great city has because she has made all nations drink of the wine of her Wrath of her fornication Revelations 148 No Authority on Earth has ever interacted with the world and his political system more than the Vatican the great city was divided into three parts and the City of all Nations fell the great Babylon came in remembrance before God and give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of the wrath of God Revelation 16 19 God will someday destroy spiritual Babylon with great anger because of its great wickedness and there came one out of the seventh angel which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither I will show you Thee the judgments of the great that sit upon many Waters hallelujah amen in order for she John and who Jesus was speaking to he could only speak to those and say come hither and I will show you because he knew they were separated then they weren't of that Spirit they weren't manifesting that spirit in this hour and only God can say come hither to the Bride of Jesus Christ because she's not of this Spirit right here in the midst of us I mean the message Hallelujah God will some days destroy spiritual Babylon Hallelujah the Vatican the great whr is the religious system involved in deceiving the world many Waters refer to nations of the world the worldwide system of false religion controlled by one city yet covering the whole entire Earth no other than the Vatican is involved in the whole movement of the religious tolerance and uniting of everything today that is called Humanity not uniting for Christ but Humanity that's the the call of the Catholic church today uniting Humanity together think about it my brothers and sisters we're not uniting flesh and blood we're not uniting Humanity amen we're not looking for members the Bride of Jesus Christ is uniting the Revelation has come to her and that's what's uniting but she the Harlot is uniting Humanity together Hallelujah there are spirits behind all all these statements that can refer and reflect down right here in the message and not separation Humanity but and not separation from the world religions this is called the Catholic church today in whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication the habitation of the Earth has been drunken by her wine Revelation 17:2 religious fornication is the term God uses in Fallen organizations that claim to be Christians but in reality is a traitor of everything that God has ordained God has ordained his word he's ordained a prophet in these last days to give us a pure word and that's what he's ordained in this day and nothing else that's the only thing that he's going to stand behind Hallelujah he's not calling out a bunch of group of people he's not calling out all the message people he's calling out come out from amongst her my bride that's who he's calling in this last days hallelujah so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sitting on Scarlet colored beasts full of names blasphemies having seven heads and 10 horns Revelation 73 the woman is called the Catholic church with is uniting with father Fallen Christians and Fallen religions of all the World supportting by the Antichrist this Scarlet Beast is the power that's uniting governments are we seeing that today under one ruler that will rule the world this ruler this Antichrist will use the to get power to unite the world and yet in at the end both will fall and the woman was arrayed in purple and Scarlet colored and ing gold and precious stones and Pearls having golden cups in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication Revelation 17:14 who else but the Catholic church dresses in purple and Scarlet and colored in royalty the golden cup is exactly what the pope uses for his Mass brother Tim I know this I read the message I understand this I know you do but there's something behind this Hallelujah something behind even when the prophet was speaking this back then he wasn't just speaking it not only to expose her but to expose her to you to expose her out of you and all these devils and these filthy Spirits these unclean Spirits these false doctrines these dogmas out of you and me we are going through a purging we are going through a cleansing we are going through a period of time we're overcoming these things in our lives we're getting rid of them we're becoming that word made flesh again today in order to become that word made flesh again today we have to overcome these things everyone is different Hallelujah people bring in these things they come I realized when I came to the Lord I had Supernatural experience Supernatural Deliverance but it didn't stop there 33 years and God was still all along the way revealing those demons demons of poverty bondage all these spirits that came from the great in our lives Hallelujah and that's the one thing he would love

you didn't see manifesting in your life you were blinded to those manifestation but then he came the word came and started revealing to you and started showing you things in your life and then that's when you let it go and you give it up to the Lord and say Lord I denounce this spirit I denounce that spirit I receive your word I received the Deliverance of my life and those who are being set free those who are being delivered those who are overcoming in this hour they are the ones that are rejoicing they know they're being set free they know they're overcoming in this hour oh yes and they are the most happiest person in the world you talk about joy unspeakable you talk about Rejoice through your trials and trouble Rejoice through these things because you know you've experienced God setting you free Hallelujah you will not be deceived bride if it were possible the deception is so so deceiving in this day he says I got to shorten those days for the elect sake I got to shorten it no flesh our flesh can only go so far so much distance in this great battle amen our souls who we are inside we fight we fight our spirit is willing but the flesh is weak this battle is getting great with each and everyone individually in our lives this overcoming this battle and night and day Hallelujah that's why he says I got to shorten I got to Quicken this Revelation to you as an individual amen or else no flesh is going to be saved but he said my word won't return to me void that's inside of you it shall accomplish it shall overcome it shall manifest who it is God is determined in this hour all he needs is you it vessels not just preachers you you that vessels in your life surrender to God be willing to humble yourself before the mighty hand of God confess your sins repent of your sins David love repenting of the Bride of Jesus Christ loves repenting when David seen that he sinned oh he said who is that man that did that great prophet he say you are that man and David seen that he was that man because he looked he was blinded the prophet was even speaking the manifestation of this individual and what he did and he was blinded to see that he did that and then the prophet thus sayeth the Lord you are that man and his eyes eyes opened and when his eyes opened to see his sin he repented Hallelujah but let me tell you the sword didn't leave his house didn't leave his family until he was fully purged out God has The Purge the f is in his hand he's got to purge it out of us my brothers and sisters out of me out of you he's got to purge that sin Hallelujah I'm going to have a church without spot without Wrinkle in this hour I'm determined sayeth the Lord to do that because I have spoken it and what I have spoken will come to pass Hallelujah I want to be part of that I want to agree with that I want to surrender my life to that Lord help me tonight help me to surrender to that and reject all these Spirits hallelujah hallelujah the Catholic Church even declares that Islam Today is an abrahamic faith and Muslims today see the Catholic Church honoring Islam even the pope is seeing kissing the Quran for the whole world to see this indeed is abomination I saw that drunken woman with the blood of the Saints and the blood of the martiners of Jesus Christ I saw her and John wondered a great adment admiring her is that the truth is that the truth my brothers and sisters oh my if that spirit is uniting in that way that denominational spirit is uniting in that way my brothers and sisters all I can say to you that Spirit as the bride is uniting not the message not the groups as the bride is uniting that spirit in the midst of the message's nting again and it's starting to manifest Hallelujah and God is showing us the truth God is revealing the truth because you know why you're his bride and you're not going to be deceived you're not going to stumble over these things you're going to wck recogize these things when they start popping their head up and they're popping their head up and they're going to pop up their head more and more but it's individually the Bride of Jesus Christ in the midst of all that brother Brandon says don't don't don't leave your denomination go back to your denomination and be a light God has birthed you God has given you the Holy Ghost God has revealed truth to you let me tell you go back be a light bride of Jesus Christ in the midst of the denomination of spirit in this message be a light where else is that going to be fulfilled in this hour hallelujah amen when the angel poured out the fourth Bowl there's unbearable heat instead of repenting the people Curse God all the more the fifth plague darkness and pain the people still did not change either in the series of the trumpets judgments people had to refuse they refused to repent Revelation 9:20 to 21 but now they also curse God indicating an increase in hardness in their lives and in their hearts the outpouring of the six bowl the nomical spirits from the Satanic Trinity enti rulers of the world to make war with one another what result is not just a battle between nations but is the great day of battle for the almighty himself when he destroys his enemies Revelations 12:14 without warning God acts the unexpectedness of his intervention is a good reason for believers always to be prepared so that they are not ashamed when he comes oh he's going to act my brothers and sisters you know just just like the the the Israelites said how long under the altar how long Lord before you Revenge Hallelujah we can see this this squeeze is coming Tighter and Tighter and Tighter in this hour this deception is growing stronger and stronger in this hour how long Lord but he's going to act swiftly unexpectedly amen hallelujah and the Bride of Jesus Christ the ones with the oil in their lamps not the foolish virgins ones being foolish but the wise version are going to be ready and only they are going to be ready in this hour as with the seven seal and the Seven trumpets so with the seven bowls our flash of lightning pearls and Thunders and and earthquakes Revelation 17:18 revelation 85 Revelations 11:19 like the great City Babylon the ungodly world has become so proud of his achievements and power that it has chosen to ignore God and build civilization soberly to suit itself purposely avoid God by their traditions and took the word to suit themselves Hallelujah Satan's bride has a voice my brothers and sisters therefore like Babylon it is destroyed in a terrible judgment from all powers and the holy God Revelations 19:21 this judgment will describe in the great detail the voice of the Bride there are many voices in this present generation however the one voice that hasn't yet been heard in its entirety in its fullness is the voice of the Bride Revelations 18 why my brothers and sisters why hasn't she been heard in her entirety in her fullness because she has to come into the fullness and the entirety of the word of God the understanding of who who she is when she recognizes who she is in this hour when she overcomes my brothers and sisters when she can discern the two spirits in the framework of the church or the message Hallelujah then her voice is going to be start being heard then God is going to send that quickening power upon her and Quicken her and Quicken her you think it's being quickened now you think she's being hurt now no no it's coming my brothers and sisters it's coming faster and faster but the process is in her now amen I started the work I will finish the work I will complete the work I am doing the work inside of you now all this is a part of it coming to service hearing the word of God praying Walking with God every day listening to his voice hearing his voice it's all part of you coming into your position coming into that fullness coming into the voice of the Bride of Jesus Christ in these last days to be manifested Ed in this hour Hallelujah God won't share his glory with no unclean Spirit that's why he has to cleanse amen he has to cleanse the altar he has to cleanse the soul and the spirit in this hour he has to cleanse us from everything that's not of him yes your Soul's been born again amen but your spirit your mind has to be cleansed and purged from all these traditions and all these culture things in our lives and all your ways all your understanding all your thoughts have to be cleansed by the great one who's going to do it only him he's the head of the church the spirit of Truth when it comes it will guide you and lead you to all truth hallelujah amen listen to his voice glory to God let me start winding this down I hope you're understanding standing and seeing something tonight amen about this Spirit here hallelujah hallelujah this passage clearly outlines a season of time in which the voice of the bridegroom will be distinctly expressed clearly and effectivly through the bride and at a certain time for it to cease so there's a time where it will manifest a short quick work and there will be a time it will cease hallelujah oh my brothers and sisters Souls that are in prison now when that word is being preached that revealed word is being preached there's coming a time that only the bride is going to receive that hallelujah hallelujah amen throughout the Earth there is religious and political spirits that the Bible identifies as mystery Babylon nevertheless in the midst of this ungodly system the holy spirit will release great praise and worship expressions of God's creative ability power of the spoken word and distinctions of his true voice in the word bride today in the midst did you hear that in the midst of that in the midst of that Spirit Hallelujah listen God has to BU build the Bride of Jesus Christ up she has to build he has to build her up to be strong to what's coming ahead she has to withstand oh I can withstand the Catholic Church the Baptist Church and all that no she's got to withstand right here right here hallelujah right in the midst of people who claimed to believe what she believes and what she's seeing and what she's catching the Revelation what she's catching oh yes that's why God is building you up making you strong hallelujah hallelujah remember Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it isn't that what he's trying to do and he's going to accomplish it but not to the bride remember that come out of her my bride defile it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless remember the the original Church in the book of Acts it exposes Satan Reveals His works his attempt destructions of God's people and discrediting God's word discrediting it misusing it misplacing it misinterpreting it putting his own interpretation on it doing all these things false doctrines saying something that it didn't say hallelujah right down to the time he's cast in the Lake of Fire that's this time not that time in 63 but right till he's casting a lake of fire is happening right now right here in our midst he fights that he canot stand it because he knows if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for think about it he is so scared of that tonight and every night and every day he's so scared of that Satan that you will sit there and not just be a church uh uh member a church a Pew warmer or or come in here I believe with your self-righteousness but you'll catch a true Revelation you'll your your understanding something will happen that you eyes will open and you'll see this in reality see this in the power and demonstration of his word being fulfilled he scared of that he doesn't want that to happen that's why he causes all kinds of distractions all kinds of interference all kinds of things upon your life it's all for one purpose that you don't recognize what's inside of you what that attribute is you he'll put family he'll put husband he'll put wife he'll put children he'll use what he can use to stop and distract the Son and Daughter of God from recognizing who they are because he's scared I said he's scared that she comes into that understanding that realization of who she is oh my what do I do brother Tim seek the Lord with all thy heart with all thy soul and all thy mind separate lay aside every sin that easily beset you come on to the throne Hallelujah are you willing are you willing to lay aside everything oh your life has been so set up oh blessings blessings from God material all these blessings Financial blessings all you all think it's all from God all the time sometimes it's not read the Bible read the scriptures read the message of the hour and find out some most of the time this is distractions of the devil trying to win you over trying to buy you Hallelujah trying to get you on his side cuz he knows there's some light inside of you he knows in that spiritual real there's something more than you know that something's taking place inside of you something has ignited you and lit you up and he's there trying to deceive you every moment of the day trying to put you down for you're not to recognize who you are but here's the mighty angel with his sword and his mouth coming out of his mouth to Smite the Nations Hallelujah that Smite that devil oh God hallelujah we

144,000 Jews what's the matter today with the sleeping virgin stay long enough they don't stay long enough to get they only stay long enough to get part of that word not all of the word the deceived Church stays long enough to get part of that word not all of the word yeah they were sincere and honest about it so was Eve and Eve was deceived the Bible says she was deceived message people pick up a few base ideas about the Bible from the quotes of brother brandham then they focus on interpreting certain careful selected quotes without proving them from the scripture soon they refer very little to scripture as it is much easier to read brother bram's sermons than study the Bible because studying the Bible's hard work studying the word of God as a result message people have become increasingly Bible illiterate and the greatest enemy of knowledge is not just ignorance it is also the illusion of knowledge people splicing selecting quotes together in a way that is not established in scripture putting a cow on the roof you understanding it's going on it's taking place right now one of the last signs that elij one of the last signs that the world will receive is Elijah's Ministry that is why it it has the last sign and it and and most of it it is because that word is now in The Bride As prophesied now they say that he went off at the end of his ministry talking about brother brandham here the prophet but that's when he brought the correct word the pure word to bring us back to the Faith of Our Fathers but because they loved their TR Traditions more than they love the word of God they said he went off but he was just he was just getting it right it brought us the focus the bride the focus that she needed to get ready for the Rapture it didn't go off it was the pure word that was brought to us the pure Faith the perfect faith it brought the Bri the focus amen the focus to overcome the focus to take this word the focus to to Smite every enemy and every unclean spirit and every demon power and every level that Satan will try to hit her at the religious level the worldly level level the human level every level musicians come you know no we are living at the end time it is this age that the church is going to come together and as they are even now controlling the world politics they will soon control the finances of the world it's happening now then if you don't belong to the world organization of churches you won't be able to buy or sell you will lose all those who stay true to God's word will keep their garments clean from the defilement of this world system of church order will be physically deprived or of lacking something oh you talk about a testing time coming upon the Bride of Jesus Christ but she's going to be ready for that time Hallelujah she's going to have that spoken word inside of her oh yes those are the times that the prophecies that have been spoken about her to speak that word to speak things into existence is g to come upon her let me tell you don't think that you can be in this message my brothers be in Christ be in this Revelation because when that time comes and they come and you can't buy or sell you can't eat and you know you don't have Christ you know you don't have that Revelation inside of you to speak that word of God you're going to give in because your flesh is going to give in because you never overc came that flesh but the Bride of Jesus Christ knows where she's standing she's not going to give in she knows who her provider is hallelujah right now he's meeting all our needs by the World by our jobs by Financial by going to the grocery store but let me tell you just before the end my brothers and sisters there's going to be a need met that it was met in the Garden of Eden what I
