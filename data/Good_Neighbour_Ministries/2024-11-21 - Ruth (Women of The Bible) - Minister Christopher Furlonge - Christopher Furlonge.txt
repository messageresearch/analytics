taken from Ruth chapter 1 amen and going down to verse I believe 19 so a little bit of reading tonight amen but when you read God's word amen amen you're going to be blessed hallelujah praise God Let's us tell B our hearts tonight amen praise God as we look to the author of the book amen Allelujah our gracious God and Heavenly Father truly it's a honor and a grand privilege to be in your house

that they may hear something Lord to encourage them and they may be blessed we commit all into your hands Lord bless the reading of the word Lord as we commit it into your hands in Jesus name we pray amen and amen amen hallelujah so as we read now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and when you talk about a famine in the land now it's right now not for bread and water but for the word of the Lord amen and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sourn in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was AMC and the name of his wife Naomi and the name of his two sons Maron and chilon ephes of Bethlehem Judah and they came into the country of Moab and continued there and Emet Naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the wom of Moab and the name of one was Offa and the name of the other root and they dwelt there about 10 years and Maron and Chan died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband what a time then she arose with her daughters inlaw that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters in law with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah and Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law go return each to her mother's house and the Lord deal kindly with you as he have dealt with the dead and with me the Lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people and Naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands turn again my daughters go your way for I am old to have an husband if I should say I have hope if I should have a husband also tonight and should also be a son would you T for them till they were grown would would you stay with them for having husbands near my daughters for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord is gone against me and they lifted up their voice and wept again and offer kissed her mother-in-law but root clave unto her and she said behold thy sisterin-law is gone back unto her people and unto her Gods return Thou after thy sister-in-law see God started a great work in your life and there's no turning back Hallelujah no turning back amen don't go back to your old ways to your old country your old habits amen once God open up your eyes amen keep pressing on Amen keep marching on Amen Hallelujah there's nothing to turn back to right amen hallelujah praise God I don't want just to this to be like a story for you tonight I want you to listen carefully what the Lord will may be speaking to your heart tonight amen this Bible study amen hallelujah praise God but this is the the sweetest part of the story that everybody should loveen and Ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from falling after thee for with thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God now remember remember where where Ruth came from from a heathen country amen and by the example Naomi said to her change something in her life amen hallelujah where thou dest I will die and there will I be buried and the Lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee from me amen it's like a a bow she took amen amen a vow she took amen when you take a vow to the Lord amen hallelujah you keep that vow amen hallelujah praise God until death amen but a Christian don't die hallelujah praise God when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her so the two went until they came to Bethlehem and it came to pass when when they were Come to Bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this Naomi May Lord add as blessing to the reading of this word you all may be seated tonight amen hallelujah now in our study of the woman of the Bible we have looked at Eve Sarah Rahab and tonight we are taking the character of Ruth amen in the Book of Ruth many of you run over the top of that book and you don't think about the lessons that we can learn from that book amen you'll find it's just a short reading or something like thaten or just another story but as according to our prophet he said that is one of the greatest story that was ever recorded in the Old Testament is it type of Christ amen hallelujah praise God now we seen a culture that traced its lineage almost exclusively through men these women stand out like beacons in a host of male names and you can take all the male characters in The Bible amen but there were only few women that were recorded in the Bible and God had a reason for thaten Hallelujah as we would see tonight men praise God say they stand out and they still do because we talking about them today their presence clearly brings us the question who were these women and why did the Holy Spirit singled them out as a as ancestors of the Messiah Hallelujah we looked at Rahab not only she was a prostitute but also a Canaanite a people marked by God for judgment and yet not only did she saved herself but she saved her family but she joined the faith amen of Israel she married into the Royal tribe of Judah and the lineage is a powerful reminder that even in the face of certain judgment salvation is available through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah so through her lineage of RAB came Boaz in this story tonight amen in this Bible study tonight Hallelujah now we see Ruth repres reprs Grace Joy friendship loyalty and commitment remember those words amen and try and put yourself in that in that category Hallelujah are you joyful tonight amen are you have are you have the grace of God in your life are you committed to the work that he has called you to do are you loyal to him amen hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Jesus you see this story took place sometime during the rule of the judges as we read from the beginning of our reading tonight amen these were dark days for Israel when the people did whatever seemed right in their own sight as is recorded in Judges chapter 17: 6 21 and 25 so the every man did according to what he think was right so as we might say in modern Palance they did they did their own thing amen hallelujah that's right in contrast to all the other women mentioned in the bible root stands out as one of the characters we could learn a lot and pattern our lives with the example that she sets amen hallelujah amen Ruth is one of the brightest and most appealing figures in all scripture Hallelujah now that famine must be really great for EMC to move it his whole family down to Moab amen here we see famine struck the land and Naomi her husband with her two sons left Bethlehem and reside in Moab she her husband her two sons left Palestine a type of the church they left Palestine went over in the land of Moab amen a country which was worshiping Idols they were Idol worshippers amen but remember where the tribe of Moab came from the moabites they were the descendants of lot with an incestous amen relationship right amen hallelujah they had for maybe at the beginning they maybe had part of God in their life but they turned over onto idolatry amen hallelujah that's a symbol of backsliding like Israel did any Jew that left Palestine was out of the will of the Lord God gave Palestine to the Jews and said remain there amen so if God place you in a in a position in a place stay there until he wants to move you amen amen you are blessed wherever God places you amen hallelujah praise God though the the the the the the circumstance around your life may seems like contrary but God is obligated to bless you where he place you Hallelujah the Lord in Deuteronomy 233 says an ammonite or a moabit shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord even to the S generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the Lord forever because they met you not with bread and with water in the way so that's when the children of Israel left Egypt and they were going through on their Journey the moabites prevented them from passing through their land and giving them water here what the Lord says when he came forth out of Egypt and because they hired against the BAM the son of beop of Mesopotamia to Cur you nevertheless thy God would not haen onto bam but the Lord thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto you because the Lord thy God loves you so what God blesses bless hallelujah what God curse is Curse amen so you can't going to bless what God curse amen hallelujah and we seen that happening now around the world Amen Hallelujah and here what the Lord say thou shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days forever amen so we see Naomi went into a country where God cursed amen so it looked like the grass was greener on the other side as lot of us may think you know why God prospering them you know God blessing them I should go and join them up because you remember when God said where Ephraim or whatever that plant con let them plant cor if they're raring sheep let them RAR sheep don't be jealous of them whatever God gives you to do you do that he's going to bless you hallelujah amen hallelujah you might have struggles at first but listen God is testing you to see what you have inside of you as we will see amen hallelujah glory to God the moabites you know where they came from amen as we said they came from lot's older daughter's child Moab when they lived with their father Hallelujah now many times when situation arise around Our Lives we tend to run away in the next Direction and we end up in a worse condition than when we started amen as we see from this story here there was famine land yes it looks D it look bad maybe there was prosperity of food in in in in in Moab so they rush over there but look what happened she lost her husband and she lost her two sons amen hallelujah praise God man we want to find the easy way out as everybody when testing and Trials come with our way we want the easy way out amen we fail to commit it to the Lord and ask him for his perfect will Lord what is your will for my life in this situation amen and sometimes that the last resort we would go to after we face all the problems and we come to our Dead End Amen our box are to the wall and we have no other way but to look up but that is our first line of defense go to God and ask him his will about every single thing in your life everything a job your marriage your children work whatever you know the devil like to to to throw uh uh things in front of you to rush after it you give a nice job but you missing Church man can I come to church man you're getting over time every time that is church nighten amen and you rather rush for that but sacrifice is to Bey to obey is better than sacrifice God so it fit for you to be here tonight you God has a blessing especially for you tonight receive your blessing hallelujah what it is you know God is Try Us in every little area of Our Lives Amen in our time in our Tiding and everything else around our lives Amen to see if you're going to put him first in everything hallelujah praise God God bless you the Lord bless you hallelujah praise God thank you Lord thank you Lord you see trials and testing comes to build character in us to mold us and to shape us amen do you want to be sh you say you want to be more like Jesus It Don't Come Easy you know you had to go through the Press you're going to get some pressing situations around your life put you on your knees you start to ball oh God Amen Hallelujah Lord help me you see when we get from under his protection and here we see this family ended up in a worst condition as a backslider going and mixing up with the things of the world and mixing with the world Amen the Lord said come out from them come out from her and be not partakers of their plagues don't mix up with the things of the world Amen Hallelujah so there we see that family Amen dwelt in the very nation that God forbid them not to have anything to do with them amen you want to mix up with the world Amen you see when you're robbed yes we in the worlden you rob shoulders with the world but you are not of the world Amen Hallelujah you walk through this world Amen yes you see things you come across situation but don't participate and don't be a partaker of it amen amen hallelujah sometimes you go to a maybe a wedding or a party or something unbelievers family or whatever they're drinking and thing but it's not for you to join them that's right to take one and nobody a going see not no Brethren around here God sees though man you m your testimony to others because they're looking at you know you claim to be a Christian and you doing that and they going to turn right against and tell you what you doing here what you doing here you look like the Oddball man hallelujah hallelujah praise God thank you Lord as we read in verse five and her two sons got married they took them wives of the woman of Moab you see God said do not be unequally yoke man and here you're going to marry up with the world and the woman and the worlden hallelujah praise God so you so what you expect trouble will come Hallelujah and the name of one was offer and the name of the other was Ruth and they dwelt there about 10 years and the both of their husbands died amen now in verse six we we read then she arose Naomi with her two daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard in the country amen of Moab how that the Lord has visited his people in giving them bread amen so news came to her boy they prospering in in Bethlehem I know man we see in trouble and hell down here it's time to get up and go like the prodal son man we could take our next lesson there too man he had it well nice because she left amen hallelujah well offen she had property and everything and she left everything and she went down into the world like the prodal son he went to live it up man plenty Friends when the money was flowing plenty this plenty that but you know something it come to an end amen but once you're a son always a son amen God will deal with you you will run but you can't hide amen as our past previous past say your hand too short to box with God Amen Hallelujah if you have that seed you say I have every single one of them and I'm not going to lose none you want to go you want to have a good time out in the worlden as we said the last time the enemy always like to tell you you have to be out there to gain experience but it's a lie from the pit of Hell he will Mar you and Destroy You amen amen he will scar you for life amen is only the grace of God could take you out from that and bring you back in amen Hallelujah but you got to be willing to come back hallelujah praise God excuse me a bit here praise God the name Bethlehem means who knows what the name Bethlehem means ah that is a Bible scholar here well done my brother Bill is the house of God's bread now we have now how fitting that is to Jesus the bread of eternal life Christ is the bread of life you all know that right amen and we believe that amen he's the only one who could quench that thirst and that desire hunger inside of each one anden he will give you a peace that passes all understanding he he give you a joy that will never end hallelujah praise God we all believe that amen how fitting Bethlehem there the bread of the center of the world because when we were in Israel they proved that Bethlehem geographically is the center of the world Amen it's proven you go research it amen hallelujah thank you Lord that where the king had to be born in St John 6:35 says I am the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are all dead but this bread this bread that you're eating here tonight amen hallelujah praise God if man eats this bread he shall live forever amen hallelujah then Jesus is the bread of life no other is he is the bread of life thank you Lord he is our bread of life for the journey like Israel amen so if you want to finish this journey continue eating his word amen hallelujah praise God little by little he changing us amen you are what you eat you eat the word you become the word you eat the world you become the world Amen Hallelujah take out the I always love to say this take out the L from the world and you'll get the word the love of the world from the world and you get the word amen hallelujah so eat the wood you become the wood now in verse eight as we read and Naomi said unto her two daughters in-law go return each to her mother's house the Lord deal kindly with you as he has dealt with me amen the Lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house of her husband praise God then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept and they said unto her surely we will return unto thy people so they agreed to go with her back to Bethlehem amen but on the journey back we're going to see one of them off her decided listen I going back I going back Ruth said no turning back amen I started this race and I'm going through amen amen hallelujah the World Behind Me amen the world is behind you what in front of you amen hallelujah praise God so yes you going to get trouble because if you have a cross man this Christian walk is not easy I always say you're going against the flood of sin and it takes a living fish to flow Upstream amen hallelujah trials go come testing may come your way amen that's a everyday thing so make up your mind from now on listen listen I have to face some tests and trials amen and may God grant us and give us the grace to take go through amen hallelujah praise God God thank you Lord as we have read again in verse 12 turn again my daughters go your away for I am too old to have a husband if I should say I have hope if I should have a husband also tonight and should also bear a son would you T for them until they grow up man man so she wasn't only thinking about herself Naomi she was thinking about her daughter's in-law amen hallelujah Naomi was expressing herself as if God is punishing her and his presence has left when she said for it grieveth me for your sake that the Lord that the hand of the Lord is gone against me man she was thinking because she knew where they Where She Went Wrong and by leaving from under the protection of the Lord from leing a land where God had placed her in and we all know when we leave from under that protection amen and Trouble Comes we just say oh we paying for iten Hallelujah we paying for what we do amen hallelujah and somewhere along the road sometimes you might go off of course amen but God does bring us back amen he just bring us back amen hallelujah and she believed that God was punishing her by taking her son and taking her husband here we can learn a great lesson despite Naomi's best efforts to dissuade her root clung onto her amen hallelujah not only she clung onto her she clung onto the god that served Hallelujah that's where the the the the the the the blessing lies unto the god that Naomi serve unto the god that you serve people are following you because who you are amen when they see the god that you serving they follow that God amen amen as the Apostle Paul said it's not I that live but Christ that lives in me he do the works yes amen he does the change amen he does the converting amen he does your turn around on your life he does this the stop he stops the drinking the smoking the carousing and all that that's the one who can do it it's not I but he that lives in me that does it Hallelujah when you got that testimony you know something really really struck amen an individual life when they can see the god that is living in you amen hallelujah praise God thank you Lord yeah even in her desperate situation Naomi had a selfless attitude although she had decided to return to Israel she encouraged Ruth and offer to stay in Moab and start their lives over even though this means hardship for them man Naomi was not just considering her own needs but the needs of her two daughters-in-law now in the Jewish custom if someone's husband dies it was allow for the Widow to marry another man from the same household in order that the seed is carried on Amen the law kept the Widow from poverty and provided a way for the family's name of the dead husband to be carried on so and I'll just tell you where it's at it is from levitic sorry Deuteronomy 255 and it is stated as the levate marriage found in JW Judaism the brother of a man who died without children is permitted and encouraged to marry the Widow taken from Deuteronomy 255 and to 10 you see Naomi did not have any sons for Ruth to offer to marry so she encouraged them to stay in their Homeland and remarry offer agreed which was her right to do man it's a choice choose this day who you want to serve you're going to serve God or you're going to serve the devil there's only two ways about it you're going to follow Christ or you're going to follow Satan amen hallelujah praise God Ruth was willing to give up the possibility of security and children in order to care for Naomi amen you see Ruth was willing to leave her Homeland and go to Israel amen are you willing to forsake the world Amen and join up with if Gods despised you amen you started out with Jesus and you're going true hallelujah praise God you see Ruth was a moabites but that did not stop her from worshiping the true God nor did it stop God from accepting her worship and for blessing her man you see the Jews are not the only people that God loves God chose the Jews to be the people through whom the rest of the world will be blessed as we go back to the story of Abraham amen hallelujah praise God as Peter expressed in Acts chapter 10: 34- 36 of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of person but in every nation he that feareth him and WTH righteousness is accepted with himen so Hallelujah the word which God sent unto the children of Israel preaching Peace by Jesus Christ he is Lord of all so if God says I accept you who going to reject you amen hallelujah God accepts all who worships him you believe that yeah the true worshipper worships him in spirit and in truth and the father seeketh such Amen in every nation he accept those who fear Him and do what is right God accept those who worship him he walks through people regardless of their race their sex and their National it look here just amongst us here tonight amen Multicultural amen amen hallelujah so this is the God we serve amen it doesn't matter what nationality you come from what background you come from what is the color out here amen is what inside of here amen hallelujah praise God a pure and a contrite hearten God will in no way despise hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord all the root Who belongs to a race often despised by Israel she was blessed because of her faithfulness amen hallelujah thank you Lord Glory no one should feel disqualified to serve God because of race sex or national background you want me repeat that again no one should feel disqualified well you in because you're this and you out because you're that and you know a lot of us you know a lot of people is kind of bring judgment on people man you know where did where did we find the Lord you know some of us may be so religious and me so sanctimonious I might put it that we place plenty people in Hell quick quick quick amen when the Lord was here not where did you find him a prostitute amen down in bar you know the they accuse him of he's with publicans and sinners man he been down the street corner with the common folks amen hallelujah you see such is is those that God accepts God came to save The Sinner he came to seek those amen that were losten Hallelujah and who were those lost Ones those that were with him before the foundations of the world amen amen amen hallelujah you know I love this for God so loved the world that he gave which World his only begotten son who did Christ die for amen hallelujah he came for the lost and if something had to be Lo lost it had to be with somebody before amen hallelujah it had had owner before amen hallelujah so if you were with God before is is you he came to save amen amen hallelujah and he knows who already were with him so when you come down here you came down with part of him inside of you and he's calling you back home say come home son come home daughter it's it's supper time it's time to come home amen it's evening time hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah we see Naomi was left alone with her two daughters in-law so she so she took them out and she kissed them and said I'm returning back to the Homeland now for she heard that God God had brought corn again in her land so she was returning back after 10 years she lost her estate and she lost everything amen also she lost her husband and her two sons so she said I really don't have anything to go back to men men why are you are you going with me I can't support you I lost my estate I can't want no more I'm of age old now I have no way of means of you know helping you all so go back go back to your your your your Homeland amen amen but you know one as we said offer kiss to mother-in-law and return praise God and the part that we will as we read that we love so much Ruth decided since listen your God is my God your people is my people where you die I going to die amen hallelujah and I going to stay as long as I live with you amen she made a commitment to Naomi man you see God did something special for her because you know why Hallelujah she saw the life the example that Naomi was living amen and the god that Naomi was serving amen and turn to that God Amen Hallelujah praise God so when Naomi sorry so the two of them continued their journey and when they came to Bethlehem the entire city was stirred by their arrival and they said Is This truly Naomi amen the woman were you know speaking one with there is that the lady that left here 10 years ago man and she said unto them call call me not Naomi call me Mara for the almighty had dealt very bitterly with Meen I went out full and the Lord had brought me home again empty man just like the prodigal son when he returned home it was all in rags man he went with a lot and he came back with nothing in him right when they called when there why then call me Naomi seeing the Lord had testified against me and the almighty had Afflicted me so here we see that she believe that God has been punishing her very much so you see Naomi had experienced hardship she had left Israel married and secure and she returned widowed and poor she changed her name to express the bitterness and pain that she felt amen just like like a comparison too the PO go and said don't don't call me your son no more I want to be your servant amen so here Naomi say listen don't call me no more Naomi because call me Mara bitter amen bitter Hallelujah she was not rejected ing God openly by expressing her pain sometimes when our backs are against the wall and trials and testing come we tend to lose focus many of us does men you see the devil place so much things in front of us hardship and struggle and all kind of situation we tend to lose our focus and our real focus is supposed to be on to the Lord Jesus Christ amen the source of our strength the source of our peace our joy amen hallelujah thank you Lord however there are resources available around us for us to tap into amen Naomi had resources in her relationship with Ruth and the main one was with God Amen and sometime that's the last result we will turn to we might turn to family friend neighbor worker you know this co-workers and everything and the very last result we was turn to the Lord which is the first step as we always say you should turn to amen you see Naomi had resources in a relationship with Ruth and the main one was with God when You Face bitter times God welcomes your honest pray amen you see you see she was bitter Naomi was bitter because she believed that God has been dealt her a bad hand God is punishing her amen hallelujah amen but don't let bitterness and disappointment blind you for your opportunities amen Hallelujah see Ruth came to know God of Israel through Naomi now back in Bethlehem the prospect were Bleak for the two widows bed of their husband and facing dire poverty nevertheless root remain unsing amen positive energetic Amen in her efforts to find work and to take care of her mother-in-law she didn't give up man they arrived in Bethlehem at the time of the Harvest of The Barley season Bethlehem was surrounded by Lush fields and Olive growes its its harvests were abundant amen you see when God plac you sometimes we get blinded we get out of focus and of the blessings of God Amen Hallelujah and fail to see further down the road but we can't see further down the road once you trust the Lord put your all your trust in him he will see you right through to the end man he'll see you with true but it's all is a test it's all a test for Naomi and it becomes a test for us many times amen you see Ruth and Naomi returned to Bethlehem was no coincidence but it was certainly God's plan because in this tongue of David would be born as predicted by the prophet Micah in chapters 5 verse2 that where Jesus also where David was going to be born and also Jesus was going to be born this move was more than me convenience it look like a good opportunity yeah to to to to to to get by then man but it led to the Fulfillment of scripture you have to look at the bigger picture we don't see the bigger picture when we going through our test and trials when we see situation arrive around our lives everything looks distorted out of place and everything but later down the road you Le back and say wait a minute that is what the Lord has been dealing with me to bring this about so when disappointment come is not disappointment really you know he said all things the disappointment and the not so good things is going to work out together for your good amen hallelujah it's just for the Fulfillment of script you see God has a big plan and we just are players in God's hands to work things out to his perfect will and plan amen hallelujah you see when the Harvest and B were ready to be harvested Harvesters were hired to cut down the stalks and tie them into bundles so they landed up when the Harvest they started to reap the crops amen barley wheat and corn the Israelite law demanded that the corners of the field not to be harvested in addition any grain that was dropped was to be left for the poor to be picked upen it was supposed to be used for food and in Leviticus 199 it says when you reap the Harvest of your land thou shal not wholly reap the corners of thy field neither shallal thou gather the gleaning of thy Harvest and in Leviticus 23 22 says when you reap the Harvest of your land thou shal not make clean riddance of all the corners of the field so you know what the Lord saying don't cut everything leave some leave some and anything that fall on the ground don't pick it up leave it leave it amen hallelujah my and that's going to be entering into our next part of our study and I hope not tonight by God's grace Amen on purpose and leaving it out on purpose hallelujah praise God Thou shalt leave them unto the poor and to the stranger I am the Lord your God Amen and that process was called gleaning amen the purpose of the law was to feed the poor and prevent the owners from hoarding amen you know some people even like to everything sweep the floor clean don't leave nothing behind if the fruit fall in the ground nope nobody can't get thaten you see but when is we serve a god of abundance amen of abundance the birds have to feed man this start together amen the creatures out there amen hallelujah praise God and here we see he said leave it for the the poor and the strangers you see God always have ways men you see Ruth made her home in a foreign land instead of depending on Naomi or waiting for Good Fortune to happen she took the initiative I hope he listening tonight am man she sees the opportunity to go to work she was not afraid of admitting a need or working to fulfill that need and God used that to provide for her and on this note if you are waiting for God to provide consider this he may be waiting on you to take the first step man to see how desperate you are for that need man and as our Prophet really put it out nicely here usually it takes a state of emergency to throw us into desperation you want to wait on that time it's too bad it has to be done that way but human beings are so slothful in their mind that it takes an emergency something arises and when they do then it throws them into that desperation and really in doing that in desperation it brings out that real thing that you are man it shows what you're made out of it's in the time of desperation Hallelujah see Naomi did every sorry Ruth did everything that was necessary to get by you know a lot of people believe yes God is my provider I just open my mouth and food will fall from Heaven and fill Meen God don't like laziness you say you have to walk to eat you see a man that doesn't walk shouldn't eat at all St the scripture man Hallelujah he said by the sweat or your brow you going to eat bread man so you have to work man you do you do something and then God go do the rest for you amen action for reaction you start up amen praise God what is your attitude when the task that you have been given is not up to your expectation the task at hand may be all that you can do do or it may be the work that God wants you to doen and as I said before amen the grass looks greener on the other side why God prospering them and they God they prospering me amen I should be doing what them doing and then God will prosper me but if God call you to do that plant corn as the prophet say plant your corn if he call you to plant potato plant potatoes amen hallelujah be content with in any state that you are in God's going to bless you amen you see as the case of root it was the test of her character that opened up the door for New Opportunities man Hallelujah man how God going to put you in a position where you don't have the character to do it men men if you don't have that character what say it's satanic you can't handle it man so God will give put you in a position where you have the character to to to meet that position Hallelujah me praise God hallelujah

root for me please Hallelujah from verse one and this is a little background of our next study amen that's going to be coming up by God's grace amen I don't want it because this is uh this one is a little extensive and this is just like laying the foundation a little back of the story the the the life of Ruth amen leading us into the next phase that she's going to enter in Hallelujah in chapter two in Ruth it says and Naomi had a Kinsman of a husband a mighty man of wealth of the family of EMC and his name was boas so we remember Rahab had a son and his name was boas amen hallelujah amen and Ruth the moabites said unto Naomi Let Me Now go to the field and glean a of corn after him in whose sight I shall find Grace and she said unto her go my daughter and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the Reapers and and her H was to light on the path of the field belonging unto boas who was the Kindred of am am and behold boas came from Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers the Lord be with you and they answered him the Lord bless thee then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over in the Reapers who is this damsel and the servant that was set over the Reapers answered and said it is the moabi is damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab and she said I pray you let me glean and gather after the Reapers amongst the sheeps so she came and had continue even from the morning until now and she tarried a little in the house then said Boaz onto Ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens my is the next message right there let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go Thou after them have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art a thirst go into the vessel and drink of that which the young men have drawn my then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have I found Grace in thy sight in thine eyes that thou shouldest take knowledge of me seeing I am a stranger amen hallelujah see you see character is not a gift character is a victory hallelujah amen and God shape us and more Us by the test amen and the trials that come like to give us that character to mold us and place us into his body amen hallelujah praise God praise God our next study by God's grace would be kinsman
