i live you shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in the father and ye in me and i in you praise the lord thank god what a message what a message please be seated what a message we have on this great easter day that we have come together amen we we have a blessing in that he is identifying himself in us and we give god glory that we we are we have and we are experiencing a spiritual resurrection out of dark denominationalism out of dark theology he has raised us up in this hour as the prophet zechariah promised at evening time it shall be light the world will be in darkness but when it comes down to evening time god promised there shall be light in other words he would send forth a revelation that will break the chains of darkness praise god hallelujah is there a deacon in the back because people are still coming in okay somebody's in the back regulating things i want to be sure about that hallelujah okay all right if the world is going to become dark the prophet prophesied but god is telling his children or his people don't fear don't worry because at evening time there shall be light i'll send a revelation that will brighten up everything around you the world the word will look like new because light will be shining on the word so that you might have a clear understanding and truly know me not to look at the word through the lens of any denominational view of that word but i will give you a view of myself for god is his own interpreter and he will make it plain praise be to god i'm so glad for that that we have light have been brought to us at this evening time so that when we read the bible listen and what i'm talking about you must understand i've got to back up here i was 12 years old when i saw the lord and the call of god's spirit came upon me uh my parents were not members of any church um all they knew they would read the bible and pray and sing but then when i got to about 14 the pulsation of the spirit was so strong and powerful it caused me to hit the streets and going on the streets all i knew was that jesus lived and did miracles signs wonders died for our sins rose again hallelujah and that's all i knew and except you received the word of god you lost you you you're just finished so i just began to preach the word of god with a good friend of mine who still lives today and he's a major bishop in the united states praise god and i mean to a real and i'm saying this not to shine any light on me but on him and what he has accomplished he rose to the very heights of faith and religion in the united states until he began to do some prayer breakfast in the white house and knowing all the major evangelists you can think about billy graham swagger all of them they know him and he knows them as well as governors senators and so on but the point is to let you know where god took us from and where he's brought us our revival broke out we didn't even know what the revival was we didn't know that the revival was going on because we were praying for the sick and they were jumping up and we're saying oh this is what the bible is talking about because we think this is normal every christian ought to have this and uh people were jumping up and lives were being changed and the demons were cast out and so on and that caught the eyes of the assemblies of god denomination which gave us a scholarship to the college for three years by god's grace but i want to thank god at the end of that an old gentleman who was thought to be on nobody couldn't write his name i would read his letters for him and yet that man who would they know him because he crossed the country and tell people things you're gonna have a child this you're gonna have a son they say you're byron but you'll by next year this time it would happen over and over so all of the denominations knew him they hated him but yet they wanted him near them because whatever it was on him you know you could see it but that man believed and taught why this stayed away from him one god there's no three it's one that man believe what a baptism ought to be in the name not names of the father son and holy ghost and peter knew the name and said be baptized in the name of jesus christ that's all he knew and that's all he taught and oh my praise god i did a lot of prayer time with him and stuff like that the two of us alone would be praying praying for hours and you know that's where i began to print say lord there's got to be something beyond pentecost because i'm shortening everything because by that time i've risen to the heights of pentecost not what pentecost we see now i'm talking about when the real pentecost was coming to its end when the pastor would get up and say well the lord revealed to me a brother is going to come his name is so and so he's going to be here tomorrow to preach the word and um we'd all be in prayer and waiting on expectation and the service started but in the middle of the service the door opens and a gentleman walks in and when he walks in and the pastor would say oh brother so-and-so oh you know me but well the lord told us you're going to be here and you're you're supposed to preach and he'd come up and preach the word of god and i've seen other cases this is not even what i prepared to talk about but i've seen other cases where people come to take the communion and some of those men says don't don't touch it if you touch it they'll send for them to pack you out of here you'll die right on the spot don't even touch it because saturday night you were here here here here so they can't doubt so they back off but you see that we've seen times we're praying together we're preaching we're worshiping and then you see the clouds of glory passing over the congregation and then going on you see you're imagining no it sounds like imagination now because you don't see these things anymore now they're trying to beat it down with music they're trying to sing it down from the heavens they're trying to do everything but you don't tell god when to come when to go what to do whatever he moves as he wills praise god and i want to thank god and i saw pentecost rise to its height and uh you know and then started to fall right it started to fall until right now how are the mighty fallen fallen it has the outward looks as if it's all revival things are going great there's really no revival right there's a lot of fish in the net but a lot of them are snakes and crabs and all kind of other creatures in the net but the real fish the real fish there are very few of those but i want to thank god that i could be alive in this damn time as one who saw the ending of that right and was able to come into what is happening now right praise the lord god bless you let that be just my my comment that was thrown in there but praise the lord now we know we're talking about resurrection time and we know that when abraham had gotten or was living on the top of the mountain that he was visited by three men and as the three men three approached him right he said my lord elohim but even though that word they say it's plural it's really one just like how adam and eve they're standing in the garden two people what the bible says and god called their name adam right there they were so here three men and yet my lord amen and jesus now referring back to that says as it was in the days of sodom of lot so shall it be when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man would be veiled in human flesh again the god of heaven will come and live behind skin veils living in human flesh i want to thank god that he's the mighty god the everlasting father hallelujah praise god now he is saying in other words that god would now return in the form of his church in the form of his people he will no longer be hiding behind the tent named jesus but now he's in a many-membered body he came first as jesus the head the husband the bright groom of the body but now it's body time it's bright time it's your time it's my time it's the time of the holy ghost when he promised that the son of man would be revealed again praise god in other words god would be revealed as man not as jesus christ but in his people because remember uh eve was not different from adam for she came out of adam she was a part of him god did not go take up not a different piece of dirt to make her the same material that adam was made of the same material she was made of because he took her out of him spiritually now in our case jesus was there and is the word and his bride or his wife comes from him then if he was the word let the devil not confuse you blind you or make it so unbelievable to you that you cannot believe that the god of heaven has come down toward again to live in mankind that they may go back to being the word of god as they were in him before the foundation of the world in him when she was separated from him like eve was separated from adam so we look like we are now it's a many member body of thousands and thousands maybe millions of people but yet they are one let them recognize father that they are one right no matter how many there are one praise god what makes you one not just gathering together but your faith makes you want your revelation makes you one as isaiah said and in that day the watchmen on the walls of zion will begin to see eye to eye how are you going to see anything different we're looking we just we're looking at the same thing we're supposed to be looking at the same thing if we are seeing something different it means that somebody is putting their own view and their own concept on it but we can't look at the same thing and seeing two different three four five different things something is wrong somewhere when that begins to happen but thank god it's resurrection time again and the son of man is raised up and is revealing himself in human beings and true human beings look god portrayed all of this in the old testament because he used badger skins to veil the glory of god from the people [Music] it hid the glo god's glory from the people whatsoever praise god and i'm so glad when thousands around the world are celebrating easter as a tradition we can come in here and we can come wherever we are around the world we can come with real christian faith not by tradition but by revelation listen this bible this scripture was not given by education not by theology holy men wrote as they were moved by the holy spirit listen you've got to remember this is a supernatural book there was no book like this before there was nothing written when these men believe abraham enoch elijah there was nothing written that they were believing they had nothing they could read every day like we are to keep up our faith and to you know like a tomato plant to prop ourselves up unless we fall over no no no they had nothing all it was something supernatural invisible spoke into their hearts sometimes they heard a literal voice behind them but whatever that voice was oh praise god whatever the spirit of christ was hallelujah they recognized him and they recognized that that was the truth oh praise god and they they lived their life on that in other words if i'm going to vote i'm going to vote for for him if i'm going to live my life then i'll lay down for whatever that is i know that that's right and what's right that's why the bible says in hebrews 11 these all died in faith did he see anything they didn't read nothing or praise god they only put their faith in what god had made known to them yes i know moses came afterwards and wrote the ten commandments which was for the jews praise god but now we're under the gentile dispensation where the holy spirit is making yourself known praise god look god hiding behind the skin they knew god was in that temple they knew god was in there because the holy fire of god was above the around the place but it hid behind the veil of those skins hallelujah and traditions couldn't go in there to see it because the skins were hiding the word the skins were hiding the glory of god the skins were hiding the shekinah praise be to god hallelujah oh my so my friends there was no beauty to the desire of jesus christ when he came in this world because he was a disguise that god was wearing his name shall be called emmanuel meaning god with us it was god with them god walking around the people among his subjects so that he could be tempted tested tried learn obedience and so on by walking among his subjects to see what they're going through what their lies are like that he could be as the scripture said a high priest amen that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities because he was not tempted with any other temptation less than you had but more than all of us he bore every temptation and he overcame so he knows what it is to go through praise god there was no beauty to be desired of him hallelujah the lord made flesh among us praise god hallelujah and it's the same thing happening today again for this that same son of man is being revealed again now but in you and me but what people will look at there is no beautiful desires of that i know him i know her i know what he'd done i know what she done i know what this other one done you are looking at all of those things and yet you don't see the glory of god hiding behind that skin that veil hallelujah i know him he used to be a drunkard i know her i remember when she used to use drugs and all kinds of things like that brother sister we don't care what they've done if they sincerely surrender themselves to jesus christ and they are washed by the blood of jesus christ and they have seen the word of god for their day and it supports them of their sins and out of their past he closed the book in the temple and today he wants to close the book on your past he want to close the book on every single thing you've done and set you free completely that you might worship him and walk with him alone praise god amen oh praise god i want to tell you them skins that was once on the badger god was using that skin now to hide his glory praise god forevermore oh and so god was being housed or had his habitation behind those skins i want to thank god today that god has come again in our time and we have given up our sins praise god hallelujah but sometimes we gave it up and sometimes god had to skin us alive by hebrews amen the word of god is quick sharper than a two-edged sword oh skin you are lying take your skin off for you get behind your skin that he can hide by behind your skin and walk amongst the people it god hiding in simplicity oh and doing the same by his grace amen yes and behind that skin on the outside when the people look all they saw was badger skins oh my yes he's just like me she's just like me the other one is just like me god made it thus to be like that god might even make you look and see some of their mistakes deliberately make you look and see some of their mistakes so that you can be distracted and don't see that gleam of glory hiding behind that veil oh my praise god but the word of god was back at that veil i believe the word of god is back in some of these veils here today amen the shekinah glory was back of that veil praise the lord and more than that there this shoe bread was behind them that veil at that particular time glory to god all the glory of god was hiding behind that veil praise god even the manna everything was right behind that veil praise god and all you can do when you get behind that veil is walk in the light the light of his presence that was behind the veil all the priests could do was walk in the light and we are asked to do the same thing in our day and time is the walk in the light and that light will preserve you like it preserve the shoe brand that same light praise god will watch over you every step of the way that you are taking glory to god hallelujah oh my listen what paul says changing from glory unto glory hallelujah my friends that's what has got to happen we change from one glory to another glory until you go back to your original glory like jesus said all father would glorify me with the glory i had with thee before the foundation of the world praise god every saint of god every child of god are parts of the stars of the spirit of christ amen and that glory of the light of god in you god wants you to brighten every corner where you are shine the light that is within your soul touch lives and change hearts for his glory and for his honor blessed be the name of god hallelujah thanks be to god now i'm use the term elohim and the reason why he's called elohim is because and the word is plural is because in him was attributes amen people stumble over when god said let us make man uh you know into our own image they stumble over these things they don't realize it's one person speaking but they're speaking for a whole a whole race of people not not natural spiritual he's speaking about a whole super race and he's speaking with one boy you know that naturally even queen elizabeth now we are not amused we who is she alone talking but she is speaking of all the generations behind her right so god now is had attributes in him amen praise god you believe that and there's one god and then god showed on pentecost how he broke himself into pieces and portions and went into these apostles so a part of god was in these apostles they were not god almighty but they as jesus said ye are gods and children of the most high praise god so being part of god amen they moved in his grace and the presence and the power of god in them them identified them that they were part of the living god now we know that we were if we are believers in god as his attributes and jesus came to be our savior and our redeemer how many knows that oh praise god well the word redeem means buy back praise the lord it's like if um let's say sister sheila who went to poland uh uh you know a hairpin or something like that that's made of gold uh to be able to raise some money for funds to do something and uh that that gold hairpin or that authentic piece would be in the pawn shop right and when the time came she wants to redeem it that she might take it back because it's her own right it says born again so he's taking back what is his own but because he allowed us to come down in this world of sin and and satan got the control over us the only price that could purchase us back was his own blood but we are redeemed not with silver and gold but by the precious blood of christ hallelujah and when we say blood we're not talking about the blood that was painted on the cross because you know the life is in the blood that red was only for the human eyes mortal to know that something went out of him that was unseen but that was just a symbol but to this day millions are still power in the blood power in the blood and they're thinking of that blood back there they're not realizing that that blood is really the holy spirit himself amen oh praise god so the life is in the blood so he came to bring us back where we started from praise the lord god hallelujah and where you started from you started in god's thinking that's where you started for in god's thinking right praise god i was in my father's loins before i actually arrived here on the scene we were in god's mind before we arrived here on the scene now god by his great holy spirit hallelujah amen uh shaped every one of us we all different here everyone even if you had twins in this building they still be different because they make up maybe different this is different in different ways but we are all different because god in making us shaped us and formed us that way praise god amen and if not so god knows right where you belong he knows where you belong he knows where you belong praise the lord hallelujah and therefore i want you to know if you really have eternal life as i've said many many times you never began and you will never end hallelujah you're not conscious of it but that's why the word has come to make you conscious of who you really are you're not just another human walking around the earth not knowing who you are where you come from who your father is or what is the order or resurrection of promises of god in the word amen but you recognize fully who you are and then you're able to step into your possessions possess your possessions and accept the benefits of resurrection recognizing who your father is and that he has died and his will has been read under the opening of the seven seals and that you are now accepting what he has left for you you have come into your supernatural inheritance by the power of the holy spirit amen and you have the right to take what is yours by faith in the word of god hallelujah oh my you've been predestinated to this mystery of god predestinated to this hour and to this position that you might receive what god has given to you amen you have you never had a beginning and you never had an end hallelujah and i want you to know you always were you always were you i say again you may not yet be conscious of it amen but you always were so when uh the the false view mistakenly false view because of not having to say listen this bible as i was saying was given by inspiration then if you're going to receive it it's got to be received again by inspiration hallelujah you know when we met used to make tapes or we make cds they're moving at a certain speed is that right when the tape or the cd is like this and i put it here it can't talk to you this bible sitting here can't really talk to you but when it goes back into another tape recorder and even though it's in there if that tape recorded doesn't speed up enough the same speed like it was given it can't replicate the same thing to let the voice speak again so that the people can hear the voice of god on the divine inspiration am i making any sense steve praise the lord hallelujah so the same spirit the same anointing has to return and come again amongst his people glory to god and to make the word of god live again hallelujah the word eternal means something that never had a beginning something that will never end so in reality if you're a true believer you weren't saved on a certain certain day that is when you become aware that you were rarely lost and needed to be saved but you weren't saved on that day because in actual fact the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the lamb knew he were who he was dying for before the foundation of the world you are already in his mind before the foundation of the world he's now come to claim what is his own he come to claim what is his own praise peter god hallelujah being the attribute of god hallelujah and being the attribute of god which is the word of god now that god come comes into your life and you are here and you are uh trying to be like jesus and to live the life he live you become what you you become um what i would say you become a one that can be one that is a display of the word or you become the word made manifest the word made manifest for the word of god is expressing itself in and through you praise god remember there's only one bible right but inside of this bible look how many words is that right in the beginning was the word is that right but praise god in the end what happened we find out uh you are a word but all those little i am a word you are a word he's a word all those words make up the word and in the beginning was the word and where was the word the word was with god and the word was god hallelujah praise god is that too much for you to believe amen praise the lord jesus hallelujah praise god you know if i am to say um microphone in an in a nanosecond while i'm thinking to say microphone i i already visualize a microphone human beings are made like god in his image so before i could say pew or table or or whatever anything you think about you quickly get a picture in your mind without even thinking you don't have to do nothing for that to happen you're made that way that's the same thing with god right so when god spoke about having a wife or a bride he already knew every single one that will make up that bride just as much as when a virgin will conceive and bear islam do you think that god had to wait until mary got born and then he knew which virgin is going to be no he already knew it's the same way i'm telling you he knew you hallelujah he knew you that's why he called you that's why he glorify you and anoint you with the holy ghost and send you here today that you might hear god's word for this hour amen praise god forevermore hallelujah amen as the psalm said when he was on the cross i was on his mind yes he knew me he knew you before you were he was even on the cross so that's why you came on his mind because he was thinking of you and of saving you and i'm talking individually i'm not talking about god thinking of a mass of people he knew you he knew me he knew all my mistakes praised god he knew all my stumblings all my failings god know knows me and despite knowing you he loved me thank god he loved every one of us my god hallelujah praise god and if god ordained you to see this what i'm talking about hallelujah you can't fail to see it you can't stop yourself from seeing it because only certain people are permitted to see it only certain people are made shaped formed and empowered by god to be able to see his glory hiding behind the veil oh praise god hallelujah amen i tell you we're coming you're coming forth in the resurrection right now there's another resurrection going on not the one back there but there's a resurrection going on right now in this day and in this hour a real easter a present-day easter is taking place with a resurrection right now glory to god hallelujah amen do you know again misunderstanding false doctrine jesus is coming the coming of christ he's been coming since the day of pentecost do you know that he's been coming praise god that's the way that the baptists were born that's the way the methodist was born born into a resurrection of their day amen so the new birth puts you into the resurrection process that is going on as i've taught the other night resurrection or a rapture is not one sudden event on a certain day and we've gone up like that of course god can do that but it's a process leading to the finality of the whole thing an event right and we go out of here by the grace of god oh praises wonderful name i'm so glad that he's the same yesterday today and forever so every single age had their wave of the resurrection every age had a wave of his coming praise god but how he came to that first aid second age third age might appear different but it's all steps of his coming coming coming coming to the edge and to this last leodision church edge at the end of it all he comes and takes the whole thing away praise god oh praise god amen blessed be his name praise god i'm so glad that another wave is rolling in right now right now at pentecost they said another wave rolls in well another wave is rolling in what we are in the middle of is another wave of resurrection another wave of the coming of christ hallelujah the real easter in your soul the real resurrection of god raising you about the things of the world hallelujah amen praise god i tell your friends i'm glad that i'm in this move of god for this day amen praise god so the bride body is being raised up that's the resurrection we are in right now the whole bright body is being raised up by the power of god for if the same spirit that raised christ from the dead well in you will also quicken your mortal body by the spirit that dwell in you i'm thinking of a place where um a fish was dead and you know and the spirit of god spoke to brother branham and said pray for that fish this is a silly little thing like that praying for a fish nevertheless you pray for that fish he prayed for the fish and the fish come to life and start swimming away oh my and that fish was dead but four hours you know in the water like that is impossible but the fish lived and then he said oh i understand that he's saying that if he can bring a fish to life that is just such a little inconsequential thing what about his sons and daughters if he could speak a word to make a fish live what about making you live would he raise you up in the last day would he bring you back to what you are before that's the promise of the living god if you can speak the world into existence he can speak you back into life for the glory of god hallelujah now you know the word rapture is not uh found in the bible when when you're tired let me know praise god yes because sometimes the speaker gets so caught up you don't realize uh what's happening amongst the people uh amen you're not gonna throw me off if you get up and stretch your hands or your feet praise god but you know the word rapture is not even used in the bible but it's a commonly used word in christianity but it's not written in the bible that you can say rapture and we do use the word rapture and we understand what rapture means but i'm just telling you the facts that it is not really written in the bible the bible itself says that we are caught up hallelujah the great order of the rapture that was given is amen that jesus would raise of jesus race which he has already praise god one wave of the resurrection praise the lord and how that the the the dead in christ will be raised up first after him and the next order is which we who are alive and remain praise god we will be changed praise god and we will be caught away with christ i won't even that's another subject we're going to be changed while we're still living we didn't have to die but he's still living in other words if all the other saints have passed away and they all slept and you happen to be still alive and that's his time for the rapture and the resurrection and you happen to still be alive the bible paul is saying if you're still alive at a time you are going to just be changed by the power of god hallelujah praise god hallelujah now three things happen before the lord himself appears on the scene praise the lord and we are waiting for that hymn to appear in that way the shout the voice and the trumpet before jesus appears what is a shout it's a message that you know of it's a message going forward in other words and what is the message the message was the the bread of life amen to bring forth the bride that she might feed on the bread of life that will bring her forth into life praise be to god hallelujah how wonderful this is to know that he is the same yesterday today and forever praise god hallelujah you remember when jesus was here when he raised up then he raised up the bible said he descended into hell preached to the spirits in prison and then they were seen for 40 days in the city of jerusalem and the bible says he ascended up on high and he took them all with him now we know that our our catholic uh friends uh our brothers and sisters uh in christ praise the lord they claim that there's a place called paradise there was such a place called paradise but jesus emptied it out he empty out all you see because there was this place where the patriarchs and the prophets who could see that jesus was going to die for their sins because in the lambs that were being killed they could see like a bell from the very beginning could see that from the lambs being killed that there was going to come a real perfect lamb that was going to die for them so they believe unto eternal life right we are looking back now so we are in a better position because we know it happened and now we can believe towards that to be born again right but it's the same old testament new testament um hebrews 11 there they believe unto praise god so here it is that he took them and emptied out all of paradise and took them with him back to glory so paradise doesn't exist anymore there's no use for it no need for it because he has fulfilled uh his position of all the types being the perfect sacrifice the perfect lamb without spot blemish examined by the priests the rabbis and everything questioning him setting traps for him uh everything else they deliberately say something and see how we can react to it you know sometimes believers do that to their pastor and they don't realize that there is something new no you're not doing anything new and you're doing what's already been done and the holy spirit has his own way anyway praise the name of the lord jesus brother sister and the bible tells us amen hallelujah that god brought them all out but you see he showed us what he was going to do before he did it because he went to the tomb of lazarus and said lazarus comfort and his loud voice woke up lazarus hallelujah no matter how many ages that his spirit had traveled and gone down maybe into this edge that voice that sounded back there echoed down through the edges right until this time and it woke up lazarus the last of us it woke us up to the word that we might recognize him our day and the message for our day praise god forevermore hallelujah and so it woke up last round it was that same voice hallelujah shout is a message and that same voice woke up those saints that were there in the prison and took him out and that same voice that was the that was the first rapture that was taking place there do you know that and now the second rapture is going to be the our catching away our catching way of the bride praise god by the spirit of the living god because the old testament saints have already gone into the presence of the living god and when he see he got or was on the cross and the bible says and he lifted up his voice and screamed with a loud voice a lamborghini hallelujah and he gave up the ghost when he screamed that loud voice the same voice that raised lazarus from the grave that voice penetrated right into him satan knew that his dominion was over and the mighty conqueror had come the great one hallelujah the lion of the tribe of judah the mighty god the everlasting father amen prince of peace amen yes sir praise god forevermore and so we know that he's here again for this second part of the rapture saints that are living and saints that are dead and passing over all these things because there are subjects all by themselves so the shout the message the voice his voice amen will touch a little later praise god what is the trumpet what is the trumpet then praise god it's the gospel trumpet you see they're always looking for something spectacular a trumpet listen i was i remember my sister when she had first come to believe and born again she lived near the army camps and the soldiers you know they wake up on time early in the morning a certain time and they would have to blow the trumpet amen and her mother had to tell her get back to bed because when that trumpet blew she jumped out of bed oh hallelujah i'm coming lord oh jesus i'm ready listen no it's the army trumpet next door well she thinks it's a trumpet of the lord because they're thinking of that kind of trumpet but the trumpet the scriptures is talking about is the gospel trumpet that same trumpet that came luther sounded part of it and so on down through the age hallelujah you don't see the compound meaning of scripture and history being fulfilled in one person or one voice they can't see that but it's the same god making him himself known praise god hallelujah so i'm thankful to god amen that the same bread room that was at the beginning has traveled through time and is here again now to pick up his wife his bride praise the name of the lord in this day and in this hour and i'm so thankful that she has heard his voice and has responded to it praise the lord amen glory to god hallelujah okay i want to move on here to talk about um the bible tells us we're going to be caught up how many believe that you really believe that we're going to be caught up i'll touch a little bit on it praise the lord praise the lord now brother branham speaking now i don't want to say translation see paul was caught up into the first heaven and what he seen no i was caught up in the first heaven and what i seen you know his message on look past the curtain of time and so on but he said but paul he was caught up in the third heavens but he couldn't even talk about that amen see if he was caught up then i would have to catch up with him to be caught up right praise the lord oh my i'll give you an example one time he said i was in germany and i had to stop brother schuman i said brother schuman stop stop the rest of them are going with us and they they're trying their best to catch up they're trying their best to catch up with us and we just let's just wait here so that they can catch up with us praise the name of the lord don't you understand we are encompassed with a cloud of witnesses and they are all waiting on us to catch up so that we can all be caught up together and that is what's going on right now praise god you've got to catch up so that we can all be caught up catch up how with your understanding of the word you got to catch up to what the apostles had what the apostles believed what they received you got to catch up so that you could be caught up in the presence of the lord hallelujah amen they've all gone ahead ahead of us and now we've got to catch up with them praise god and praise god now let's i'm going now to elijah and elisha because we see resurrection and rapture all uh typed inside of them or through them by by god's grace amen hallelujah uh notice of course that elijah elisha it's like there were two different prophets but in type they were typing christ and the bride elijah you might as well say jehovah that's her right it's a symbol of the old testament the new testament because the eagle or the bird has got two wings to fly you've got to have balance to be able to fly so it's got to have those two wings a hallelujah now in them we see the same thing catch up hallelujah one was caught up and the other had to catch up see caught up and catch up see we will catch up with them praise god and will be caught up to meet them in the air praise god so you understand what is happening now it's a great fusion and conglumeration of god bringing his people together in this hour for one great catching away we might be in the presence of the lord both of them of course elijah and elisha representing the saints that are living and the saints that are already dead amen praise god hallelujah amen praise god and if you are filled with the holy spirit here today by the grace of god amen amen and god's power and presence is moving in your life i'm going to bring this to an end now even though i have not finished all i have to say but i've been to an end now because let me tell you if god is in your life and is moving in your life right now and he does things so simply uh first of all i want you to know you won't have to stand in the judgment you've heard about the white throne judgment the white trump judgment is for sinners and unbelievers right the judgment of believers is not as the way you're going to go but it's us to rewards that you're going to receive amen praise the name of the lord because he says if you judge yourselves now you will not be judged but what was he talking about if you judge yourself by the word you allow the word to circumcise you clean you up cleanse you chop off all the excess flesh and behaviors and worldliness and this and that's just chop it off he said you will not be judged because you're already judged by this the same word that's going to judge them there judges you here now so if you allow me to judge you here now you won't come into judgment you will not come into judgment but you have passed from death on to life hallelujah you already been translated in heavenly places praise god listen to brother branham here remember what i'm saying you have already been translated into heavenly places with christ jesus that is your soul we're talking about here right not that you will be translated but when you believe you receive what god has sent here you are now right now he says repeating again right now translated and in the presence of the living god may god bless you this sermon is not ended but it's ended for today and i trust that these little uh gobbled up words brought together to you and i say that because it's not a typical well-streamed sermon put together with all the hermeneutics and homoletics and so on but it's just what god has laid upon my heart to say to you for his grace and for his glory may the lord bless every one of you here today and i want to wish you a man happy issa come on musicians praise the lord
