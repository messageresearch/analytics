TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends it's good to be in the Lord's house welcome and I am happy to be here with you may the Lord bless you in a wonderful wonderful way our Bible study today I believe will be something that will enlighten you our scripture is found in the book of Genesis first book of the Bible chapter 45 verses 1 to 7 and it reads then Joseph could not refrain himself before all of them that stood by him and he cried cause every man took lot from me and there stood no man with him and while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren and he wept aloud and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard and Joseph said unto his brethren I am Joseph my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence and Joseph said unto his brethren come near to me I pray you and they came here and he said I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt now therefore be not grief nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God did sent me before you to preserve life for these 2 years at the fan being in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be any earring nor harvest and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance glory to God now my topic is Joseph a type of Christ before we speak let us pray our gracious father we thank you for the word out of the book of Genesis that we just read and we pray that the Great Spirit will anoint the word of God to our hearts and lighten our minds open up the channels of our thoughts and father may you have all the praise honor and glory as we submit ourselves to leave for service in the name of Jesus Christ that ignored of God amen Joseph a type of Christ now first of all you will say to me brother Simon a type what is it time now according to grace publications dictionary of the Bible symbols it says a type is any person or thing that provides a visual picture at an earlier time that represents something or someone yet to appear it is a kind of prophetic picture for example Noah's Flood was a type or symbol of Christian baptism which was to come Israel's journey from Egypt to Canaan was a symbol or type prophetic type of the Christian walk the Christian a journey from Egypt from a life of sin into God's promised land of the blessing Holy Spirit and later on into the gates of heaven for the God's glory amen so that is what a type is now Joseph himself was the eleventh son of the Patriot Jacob and the first son of Rachel his life we will approach this subject for the point of view of Joseph in Israel Joseph in Egypt and Joseph meeting his brethren now when Joseph was very young he was hated by his brethren by his brothers but why was he hinted by his brothers why was he hated it was all because he was spiritual he had the the gifts and the anointing of God upon him and he was spiritual and they hated him for that because he could not help seeing visions and having the ability to understand and to interpret dreams he could not help even dreaming dreams himself and so they hated him for this supernatural god-given ability that was flowing and was activated in him and through his life he couldn't help himself he couldn't not display anything else but what he was and what was in him and therefore his others hated him without a real cause but you see even though they hated him he was beloved of his father Jacob you could loved him and Jacob himself was a prophet and understood what was God was dealing with this boy and so with that understanding his daddy Jacob knew exactly how to deal with him and to keep his relationship with him no this is a perfect type this is a perfect type of Jesus Christ God the Father so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son God loved his son and then his brethren his brothers his Jewish brothers the screams the Pharisees they hated him why did they hit him they hated him without a cause because he was spiritual he could interpret the Word of God well did Moses seem to use such and such well did Isaiah say such and such have you not read the scriptures do you not know the scriptures and you know err he would say to them and because of this they hated him without a real cause because he was anointed of the Holy Spirit to interpret the word of the hour see he could heal the sick he could perform miracles he could raise the dead they were tied into their traditions and he was free he was just free and walking under the leadership and guidance of the Holy Spirit praise God and he would see visions and he would foretell things he would discern he would said before Philip called you I saw you when you were under the fig tree see he would see visions he could discern the hearts of men and discern evil spirits of all the people they could not do it they were just caught into their theological and seminary talks and stuff of that nature and so they hated him went up a real cause think about it they have no real reason his life was thoughtless because the Bible tells us they marked his notes every word he spoke they they passed it they watched it they twisted every everything he said when it was a prophecy when it was a foretelling or or when it was this is that they even looked upon him as uneducated and unknown yeah this is Joseph's son we know him with seminary did he go to which which Mitch's synagogue which great teacher that he go to and they could find no place else where he could go to for he was gone and God didn't need to be taught anything oh praise God hallelujah it was just God in flesh it was the same eternal God whom they claimed to worship that in their midst and he was the unrecognized presence of that Living God think about it so just like Joseph's brethren or brothers before him they hated he Jesus also without a cause no think about how those sons of Jacob treated Joseph and paralleled that with how the Jewish brothers treated their own brother Jesus Christ when he came on the scene according to the Scriptures true jealousy true hatred but of the cause for being spiritual they cast him into a pit they took away from him his coat of many colors that the father had given to him then they dipped in some blood to to deceive their daddy that Joseph was actually dead and so they put it in the pit and they sold them into slavery and the slave traders then took him into Egypt and there in Egypt he was resold to a great general now we know according to the scriptures Joseph was accused falsely by this generals wife and here this accusation Joseph was falsely imprisoned but after some time his ability the Spirit of God in his life began to interpret the dreams of the prisoners that were in that prison with him and so this brought him to the attention of Piru and so he was brought from that place into the very palace and presence of Pharaoh and given such authority and power that none could approach Pharaoh unless they came through Joseph so as it was with Jesus Christ no man can come to the Father except by me speaking of they the father being a Jehovah's spirit that created this body called Jesus then and with the body that was called Jesus and what in him so God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself so you could not come to the Father which was in him except by him and that is why he used those words no man can come unto the Father except through me now notice the trajectory of Joseph's life as they say - that you can't keep a good man down and watch the blessing and the hand of God upon him first his brothers blessed him in a bit but the bit could not hold him from the pit the traders took him and placed him into a prison and from the prison God exalted him to Pharaoh's Palace so from the pit to the prison to the palace there it was the hand of God upon his life and when the hand of God is upon her life that will be also your trajectory if you trust him and believe him you know take you from the ghetto and put you in the get more God would so anoint you and you my friends Oh hallelujah from the gutter balls and place you to the uttermost the Holy Spirit of Almighty God will so use you bless you prosper your waste and spiritually and naturally God will be with you and watch over you trials make cotton as it does in Joseph slight problems may come situations may arise but God will help you to overcome them for with him in your life we are more than conquerors through him that loved us and greater is He that is in you in me than he that is in the world's now let's examine Joseph's life while he was there in Egypt and in Egypt we see he is a perfect type of Christ just as much as dumb from his glory everliving story my god Savior came and Jesus was his name he left the ivory palaces of glory of heaven and came to this sin cursed earth and so Joseph left his father's house and was placed in a pit as a token to the prison and later into the palace but there he found himself in Egypt as Jesus found himself in this Shimkus world in the house of that general he was falsely accused and punished and imprisoned without a cause just late the Lord Jesus but there while Joseph was in that prison Joseph interpreted the dreams of the butler and the Baker that he met while he was in that prison those prisoners there now according to Joseph dreams and interpretation of those dreams the butler was restored to life back to his old life and position the baker we found was condemned to death so according to Genesis 42 verse 2 3 you see Joseph was numbered with these two transgressors or imprisoned along with these 2 transgressors and we find according to Luke 23 verses 32 and 33 that Jesus also was numbered with 2 amongst a transgressions these two transgressors one on the right and the other on the left he was crucified among two thieves according to the Word of God here we see Scripture and type being fulfilled now what happened to Joseph thousands of years before was now being fulfilled in the life of Jesus Christ see here it was that this has made clear to us by this type making itself fully known notice Jesus was taken off the cross and exalted up into heaven Joseph was taken from the prison and placed and exalted by the right hand of Pharaoh in Pharaoh's Palace thank God even so Jesus Christ raised up and no man can come to Pharaoh except through Joseph and no man could come to the Father except to Lord Jesus Christ for there is one mediator between God and men 1st Timothy chapter 2 verse 5 no mediator between God and men but the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he is also need you don't need Mary you don't need any other of the Saints you don't need any other great person whoever there they may be all you need in your life is the one who got placed there to stand in the gap to be the mediator to be urines intercessor to be your advocate to plead your case based upon his shed blood that you should be set free and not imprison and Satan's prison house of habits of Lies of sin of cruelty my friends but to be able to raise your hands to heaven and say thank God I'm free I'm free praise God for evermore just because of your Redeemer your mediator your all-in-all the Lord Jesus Christ amen no just stick with this let us recognize that wherever Joseph went prosperity broke out Joseph went into Egypt that was going into a time of famine and the first job the job that he was given he costs Egypt to prosper when he was in the jail the jail prospers and when Jesus returns the desert will prosper because he is the son of prosperity and when he comes into your life there will be blessing there will be prosperity in every aspect of your life because beloved I of all things that you prosper and be in health even as your soul prospereth amen being helped physically mentally spiritually yes God wants you to have what in a life of complete spiritual natural mental abundance with his anointing flowing and moving through your life praise God hallelujah so when Jesus comes to Israel again it will blossom as a rose when Jesus comes to your life you will blossom as a rose I tell you when that age breaks upon this realm it will be such a time of prosperity and blessing not only upon Israel but upon the entire face of the earth oh praise God more than any other time that the world has ever known everyone will be able to sit under their own fig tree plant their own vines their own ferns and enjoy their lines and walk in peace and live in the presence of God and join a fullness of joy forevermore and be there enjoying God's pleasures and the joy of His grace unspeakable joy and full of glory praise be to God hallelujah thank you Jesus now notice not only the prosperity but that everywhere that Joseph went the cry went out the leader Joseph Jews have bowed the knee to Joseph when the trumpets sounded always to announce his arrival when he was going anywhere and when Jesus comes back to word again when we recognize our Lord's return to earth again it will be by trumpet sound the trumpet self sound of dead shall rise and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up to be ever with the Lord that is our Joseph for this hour the Lord Jesus Christ so was it with Joseph back there that they sounded a trumpet whenever he was coming and when the trumpet sounded everyone shopkeepers in the bazaars along the way all the people that were buying and selling their goods all the great houses that were along that Street all the performers and street actors that were there had to come to a standstill stop what they were doing and bow their knees to Joseph when his presence was announced by a TripIt called hallelujah attend friends one of these days the child of God will sound times shall be no more every time will stand still upon this earth when the trumpet of God sounds and the dead in Christ shall rise first and that morning breaks up on us it turn up bright and fear everything will then have to bow the knee to Joseph for it is written wherefore God highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord every knee should bow of things in heaven and things on the earth and things under the earth and that every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father Philip chapter 2 verses 9 to 11 yes my friends here it is I remember an old song that says the name of Jesus bowing falling prostrate at his feet King of Kings in heaven well crown him when our journey is complete o precious name precious name oh how sweet the name of Jesus is so sweet I love its music to repeat that wonderful blessed name of Jesus oh what a beautiful and wonderful name friends that is the redemptive name of God your deliverance is in Jesus Christ come to him now later lady fun you laid your ambitions later trophies at his feet and we see them into your heart and into your life and live for him and you will grow an abundant grace forever more now notice carefully here another glorious revelation out of the Word of God that we can type Joseph while he was in Egypt and while there not only was he in prison not only was he exalted but he was also given a Gentile bride he was given one of fairest daughters a Gentile bride think of it he being a Jew God permitted him to marry a Gentile bride oh praise God I hope we can see clearly that time in the Word of God even as Jesus Christ himself was a permitted by God to marry a Gentile bride it's hid your Bible is in the scriptures just think on these things and let your thoughts percolate and meditate and whiten and you'll understand clearly what God is signifying hair in his word no no we realize that true this beautiful Gentile bride Joseph had two sons one called Ephraim and the other called menacing now when Joseph had gotten his brothers to bring his father's in Jacob into Egypt being very old at that time Jews have seized the opportunity to allow his father whom he knew to be a prophet to bless his two sons and generally we know that the inheritance and the greater blessing most of the times went to the elder boy but in this instance when this great prophet of God seated and the two boys kneeling before him their grandfather was about to place his lands upon their hands and just as he was about to do that something moved upon him and caused him to cross his hands and so his hands was laid upon them with his hands cross of course I type in a symbol of the cross of Christ that was to come also it was a symbol of the blessing which should have gone to the elder type of the Jewish people left them and went over unto the Gentiles it was in symbol or in type that are in prophetic type that that was what God was fixing to do of course that at that time for even Joseph himself was puzzled and said nay my father not so this is not tradition this is not how we do it but the great prophet of God we find here my friends Jacob said that was not I it was God that cross my hands so here we are seeing in tight as I've said the blessing that belonged to the firstborn or to the Jewish people was for a season given over to the younger son the type of the Gentiles and through the cross are at the cross we were first able to see the light at the cross of Jesus Christ because of rejection by his brothers with other cause the blessing temporarily left them and came over to the Gentiles that he might have a Gentile bride as the book of access that he would call out the people from amongst the Gentiles for his name sake just as a man will choose a wife to take on his name and that is why be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that is his name he is a savior he's a Baptizer he's a healer he's a king he is father he is son his Holy Spirit but the name of that person is the Lord Jesus Christ and be baptized are there are people or anyone that so desires in the name of Jesus Christ so you will take all this name be a part of the bride of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah some areas friends the hands were crossed in the Old Testament as a symbol and type in the days of Joseph and now we see God cross his hands again at the cross of Jesus Christ and they're my friends the blessing we see Abraham came to the Gentiles through Jesus Christ so that we may receive the promise of the Holy Spirit true faith true revelation through understanding to acceptance of the revealed Word of the Living God so the blessing that we repeat of Abraham came through the cross to the Gentiles for the Jews at that time our Jewish brothers for lack of understanding or as Paul the Apostle said there were blinded for a season for our sake amen they are original branch we were just grafted in but nevertheless the same life flows into the real branch flows into the grafted branch also here we are at this time of history with the Spirit of God flowing and moving upon the Gentiles then therefore yes as they the Jewish brothers rejected Jesus Christ as their Messiah and rejected the cross he turned his attention and heard what his that he took a Gentile bride praise God hallelujah all my friends in the cross in the cross be my glory ever till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river thank God for our Joseph that God has given him a Gentile bride in this hour I trust you surrender your heart your life to him and recognize you're a part of that Bride of Christ if you fully surrender commit your life he'll put the ring of righteousness and redemption upon your finger you know place the robe of righteousness upon you and prepare you for a chariot ride to glory may God help us one and all of tonight as I come to the end of this part of our study next Wednesday we will continue on part 2 of Joseph a type of Jesus Christ and there we will deal with Joseph meeting his brethren may the Holy Spirit watch between us and keep and preserve us in these troublesome and perilous times and regather us together again in the house of the Lord where we can raise holy hands without wrath and doubting giving praise honor and glory to his precious of mighty name let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father we ask your blessing upon the world send forth your word with great power father and inspiration and anointing may there be healing men there be deliverance may there be prosperity may there be great understanding interpretation upon the people as they listen to the Word of God and may you Father receive all the glory all the praise and the other and draw all men in yourself we ask it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen the Lord bless you my dear friends and we'll meet again
