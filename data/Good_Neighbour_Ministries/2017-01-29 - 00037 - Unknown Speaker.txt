these precious Saints here making a way for us to be here thank you Lord for your word today Lord as we about to read it may you bless it bless every heart may find oh God root that it may bring forth oh God what it sent forth bless his servant Lord as he stand and Minister anoint him for his service Lord set him aside Lord speak through him Lord father Lord and just thank you today bless the reading bless the hearers in Jesus name amen and it came to pass after these things that nebot the jezreelite had a Vineyard which was in jezrael hard by the Palace of Ahab king of Samaria and Ahab spake unto nebot saying give me thy vard that I may have it for a garden of Earth because it is me unto my house and I will give thee for it it a better Vineyard than or it or if it seems good to thee I will give Thee the word of it in money and neot said unto Ahab the Lord forbid me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee and Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which nebot the jite had spoken to him for if for he had said I will not give Thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread and Jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread and he said unto her because I spake unto neot the jite and said unto him give me thy Vineyard for money or else if it please Thee I will give thee another Vineyard for for and he answered I will not give thee my Vineyard and Jezebel his wife said unto him thust thou now govern the Kingdom of Israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be mared I will give Thee the vineyard of lior the jite amen amen praise the Lord thank you brother praise the Lord God bless the reading of his word and now I'd like to read another scripture a short one uh out of the Book of Proverbs 23 verse 22 23 paren unto thy father that beg thee and despise not thy mother when she is old find the truth and S it not amen hallelujah also wisdom and instruction and understanding thanks be to God may God bless the reading of his word please be seated uh what a wonderful story and within the stories that are in the Bible and in the Old Testament uh they are not just stories to be told but there are are truths embedded in these stories there are lessons to be learned embedded in these stories there are guidelines for living uh principles that gives our life's purpose all wrapped up within God's word so when we read the story of uh Ahab and neor we find out that he was a Believer he was a Jew a genuine believer and Jew and his house means he was well off his house was very close to uh ahab's Palace and no doubt Ahab would look out of his window and see neighbors's Vineyard and realized he's got beautiful Vines planted and maybe you know wines being a wine seller and some of the best wines in Israel coming up and everything else and uh let me use the word he committed it because it wasn't his own uh and he committed it it's not just a matter that he wanted to buy it the desire for it was so embedded within them within him he had to have it and so he broke one of the Ten Commandments uh already by committing and neighbor vard he approached NE and what a privilege I mean most people would be all struck by the king or or or or the president or prime minister come into their house so all struck some people get so off struck by personality they lose their voice they lose their reasoning yeah some of them will just give up and do give anything or do whatever that celebrity says because they're hypnotized by celebrity and big names and lights and and everything else but uh NE respected Ahab but he wasn't so uh you know struck by him or impressed by him that he's going to give him whatever he wants so here it is that the desire for he says give me thy Vineyard that I may have it for a garden of Earth wow think about it he's going to turn this man's Vineyard into a garden of birds then further because it's near my house you're going to turn a Vineyard into a kitchen Garden you understand he's going to turn a Vineyard into a kitchen Garden to show how great he is that uh NE but's Vineyard that's so famous for all the wines the best wines in Israel is going to be nothing but my Vineyard I've heard arrogant rich people talking and uh somebody's going to say oh well my house is uh you know 5,000 square ft and the person turns literally here it turn to the other one and say what are you talking about half of that is the size of the kitchen yeah and I've been there where the huge uh six or 8ot whatever TVs on the wall on a brick wall so far away that it has to be that size for them to see and kitchen is on this one hand my God something else so the arance got a hold of him and he is literally saying here that he is so great that that Vineyard is just going to be nothing but a kitchen Garden for him so you understand that all right um I will give to thee a better vard than this why don't you buy that one if if there's better ones than this why don't you buy that but no he had an habous eye to get this Vineyard if it seeth good to thee I will give Thee the work of it in money and there's a key here nebot said to Ahab the Lord forbid to me that I would give the inheritance of my fathers to thee amen that's what we're going to put most most of the emphasis on I will not give Thee the inheritance of my fathers and it got Ahab so depressed that he went to his home turn turn his head to the wall face to the wall means I don't want to talk to nobody and refuse to eat and everything else but of course Jezebel comes in with the picture and say you call yourself king of Israel you call yourself a man and stir them up and say you you going to have one of your subjects uh tell you they're not going to sell you lay down on your bed have a good sleep get up have something to eat and start to Rejoice because I'm going down there to see him by the time I come back you're going to have your Feld amen we'll talk about Jezebel another time her character and that spirit that can travel down through the centuries and come into our day and in our age and rest on people especially women amen I will give you the vineyard well the fact is we read the other scripture that says bind the truth and S it not by wisdom instruction and understanding and sell it not so you see what I'm thinking I'm looking at at ne's Vineyard as the revelation of the word of God that has been handed down to us amen that is our inheritance for this day this Jesus it's come through all the Patriarchs prophets through the seven Church H messenger from generation to Generation The Generation until it comes to our generation amen is that right yeah and here we are uh in the promised land picking the grapes yes enjoying the wine that God gives amen and rejoicing in the Lord under inspiration of the Holy Spirit amen I'm giving God all the glory and the praise for what he has done in our lives right and uh Satan comes along and he would like you to sell out on your faith sell out your confidence sell out your foundations right sell out your all the fundamentals of the word of God right he would love for you to sell it all out to him sell your birth right right in other words like Esau we wouldn't discuss him but it's the same thing here so his birth right for a message amen and sometimes friends that is what's happening now why am I speaking on this because we're living in an age where uh most of the people want to live act and speak like politicians they have no Foundation right and even in their thoughts they can't hold a sexual thought and carry it for any length of time it seems like the whole uh world is suffering from Ab and they have a short attention span because of Technology right and everything shifting and moving all the time and people can't uh hold to a form Faith or a form belief and stick to it amen and say here I stand so help me go amen come on brother everything else than this message of this hour is sinking sound the truth and our hope is built on nothing less than Jesus Christ and righteousness we can not trust the sweetest R but holy leave on Jesus name for he is the rock of of our salvation and the foundation of the entire church is Jesus Christ the revelation of who here right amen and we this is what I am encouraging you and trying to stimulate you to take a hold and have firm faith in the message of the hour the word of God that has been revealed to us and don't be shifting and having the devil to cause you to shift in your thoughts in your mind today you you believe 100% tomorrow I don't know the next day you're un shaky seeking SS amen you've got to come and realize that this is thus say the Lord on B your faith and your life upon it praise God and don't let the devil condem you in any way don't let the devil put you down anyway praise the Lord there's not one of us in here that is not subject to making mistakes in the Christian life amen while you're a Christian while you living for God Amen while you walking you are going to Tumble down you're going to fall you're going to make mistakes you're going to make slip offs but that should make you sh to bow down your head to the devil into him and [Applause] no condation oh praise God forever more so the generation said the prophet will become weaker but wiser amen and that is why because people have not been as PA Ed the word that f b Ministries to establish the people in the faith Amen in other words you you you create a masterpiece and then after you created it you take it and you get a slab of marble granite polished and you set it on that to let the beauty of the thing show amen but you have to set it on the foundation for it to really look well and God wants to said every one of us not just the church but every one of us our lives should be set upon the foundation of the rock revelation of who Jesus Christ is individually am we are to be founded upon the word of God Amen Hallelujah and don't come here because of your mother no are you here because your father comes in or because your wife comes in or because your husband come comes here the song All spiritual says not my mother not my father but it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer not my father not my mother but it's me oh Lord standing in the of prayer it's me it's me oh Lord I'm standing in the need of prayer it's me it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer not the pastor not the Deacon me oh Lord hallelujah your faith can't rest in the P or the of the word of God As Long As I follow him oh that beon is faithful and true and a good man has a good paner oh you know I'm going to go to that church because that's a good Deacon no doesn't work that way if you want to be a genuine Christian you've got to have your own individ upon the word of God amen hallelujah praise God my God if your mother is gone tomorrow then your fith God if that pass is G tomorrow you f God whatever so but if you have an individual faith based upon the word of God the devil cannot shake you and there is a there is a fam for people that have individual faith based upon their Rock revelation the word of God and that is the reason why you got belever shifting from church to church not because they don't believe but they haven't been firmly established is that right firmly established how would you like to build a building rather than and tomorrow when you come back building shift right instead of being on the slab Foundation that you put there or whatever Foundation it's fin off to the side right because you know I always got to have a back door because if that things don't work out in that church I just slep out the back quick and and and and you know I'm somewhere else I I wasn't ready with them you know I just used to go there and you know sit in the back so that at least I go to church no you come to church you are the church and you come to meet with Jesus Christ amen tell the truth all right that's what this is all about that's the reason why we are here in the house of the Living God praise the Lord hallelujah he wouldn't sell him because first of all the property that was given to him was of sentimental value to him whenever he walk those fields he can realize that his great great grandfather was walking through this field and looking at some of these Vines because you know Vines you know Great Vines can live for 100 years 150 years they can be there forever longer long so he's looking at the same word the same v he's looking at the same Holy Spirit he's looking at the same word the same and walking up and down that field in the morning early and thinking about his great great grandfather and the value of that amen is more than anybody can buy and therefore he said I want s it praise God praise the Lord amen the Jesus said by the P if you get the P of bre price don't sell it why because it's Priceless amen there is no price you can put upon the revelation of God's word said you I cannot stress the importance of genuine Revelation to the True Believer see because you can't buy it in the store he says who can uh dream himself a dream or decid he's going to reveal to himself a revelation or is God deserve it no he says God by his grace gives it and because it's my gra there is no price on it Hallelujah no price whatsoever glory to God you can't buy it in the store but it's by faith in God no earthly value in other words he realize that even if he was going to give his kingdom to neighbor just to got that vard NE was not going to sell it and the devil will try that with you he want to give you the whole world is that right if you give a man the whole world to lose his soul s out my God you want a job you want this you want that money all you got to do is lower the standard Lord just drop this out and come on stop talking like that when you on the job don't bother with this witnessing stuff you it's going to be bad for your career and and and you're not going to be able to get along in life I mean let's Live and Let Live right and uh you know you stroke my back down and I'll stroke yours and and and you don't make trouble in My Kingdom the devil tells you and I'm not going to make trouble for you and we going to get along the only thing is you can't get along the sink am is that right right I who talk to us Solomon talks about the snake you're going to put in your bosom right like the story is told of a farmer that found a snake on a wintery day and the snake was cold shivering nearly dying takes it and brings it into his Farmhouse put it near the fire and when the snake revived and everything else he decided he's going to feed the snake a bit of milk because snakes love milk that's why they even in the Primitive countries they know when a mother's pregnant and she starts to produce milk they got to look for snakes because the snake kind of Senses it smells it and they like to be around there where the milk for the child would come out so here it is now he put some milk there and for the snake and as soon as he puts the milk the the snake drinks the milk and bit him on the hand and he my God I took you out of this cold and brought you in put you by the fire warmed you up now I'm feing you milk to B me what kind of a he says well I'm a snake he says when picked me up you knew I was a snake but that's expect me to do I got to act in other words I got to act by my man praise God so you don't make a deal with the devil because the devil break that deal he's a liar from the beginning and he'll always be the father of liar so when he tells you I'll leave you alone and you leave me alone don't rock the boat and all this stuff and don't testify about Jesus and all this stuff don't you listening to him because he's not somebody you can make a deal with you got to stand to the word and the song that's been ringing in my head when I thought about this hold to God changing hand amen God changing [Music] hand ET [Music] God everything around us is Shifting and moving but the only anger that we have to hold us is Jesus Christ the said yesterday today and forever I thank you Lord thank you hallelujah praise God my God my mother left an old Bible that she wept over cried over marked on and everything else do you think I will go sell that to an auction house you think any of my siblings would take that Bible and and just sell it like that no there is no value on something like that amen because it goes right back through your your Generations listen to Paul Jude one of course one one chapter uh three to four beloved when I all diligence to Rite unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write onto you and encourage you which is what I'm trying to do and exal you that you should earnestly condemn for the faith which was once delivered unto the saes some people are given up the Fed so easy you know let go their rights giving up their inheritance walking away from the what was in God's predestinated will for them they turned away from God's fre will and when the devil challenges the will they decide they're going to back away and back off oh but no this what we have received is not from the mind of will this what we have received has come down through the centuries of the angel through the Patriarchs through the prophets through Jesus Christ through Paul through all the apostles right [Applause] through what is my subject embracing the truth amen Solomon talks about it buy the truth and sell it not amen ssongs of Solomon embrace Bri and said I Won't Let You Go amen they all the way around she Embrace him and tell him I Won't Let You Go amen praise the Lord and praise God forever more so today we want to tell the Lord how much we love him how much we love the message he sent to us and we want to embrace this truth we want to hold on to it with everything we have praise God hallelujah I don't think your wife is going to love you so much and you just give her a light H you really got to embrace her and let her know that your judgment love praise the Lord everybody stay quiet but once you get down to real life and close to people's address they start to get quiet that's all right you're talking about reality that's the truth and if you don't do it you ought to is all right if you don't embrace your wife to embrace your wife you I love her because I marry her you have to tell her you love her um as often as you can not only in words but in Deeds also I kind of slip off into something there maybe that's in for somebody praise the Lord glory to God hallelujah oh my a big am I want to sell you the spot from when comes my inspiration from Once the holy spirit's anointing come upon my life am I going to sell that out and buy a liturgy or buy some stale prayer from some church book how can I sell that out when I'm got a Vineyard that's producing me fresh wine all the time the Revelation never stops it keeps coming out of the word of God every day it's coming out of the word of God how am I going to sell expect me to Shell I might as well sh my soul sh my life amen my God but that's what a lot of believers do this is our heritage right brother bre says you in the rising of the son he said we are the beneficiaries of his resurrection amen he did it for your sake that you can become the inheritor of what he has done right praise God forever more glory to God can you imagine that land handed down from generation to generation Paul said in this generation and nowen I'm leaving and now I pass to you the torch of Life he's thinking of a relay race and at this stage I'm passing to you the torch of life back then they actually ran with a torch like it symbolized right now with the O whenever they're going to start the Olympics they do it with a runner running with the torch and that's the way it used to be in the Olympics and then pass the torch to the next one and the torch of course represents the word of God and Pa said hand to you the word of the word of life he The Word of Life praise God forever more and that torch has been passed down from generation to generation in other words it's not a mod church it's the original Church from hand to hand the anting going from man to man man to man until it comes to the people of this generation the same holy spirit that broke himself up on the de cross and Anointed The People by coming upon their heads in the lick of fire which was just a symbol that he has gone into their lives and the fire of God is now within them that same holy spirit is available to us today I feel his pres today it's not not the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit has to become water no it's the same all time Holy Spirit and that's the reason the devil don't want to go there but it's [Applause] good word praise God hallelujah amen glory to God you know the story is told in the Bible of Solomon when he was alive that his soldiers his kingdom was so rich that his the soldiers his personal guards their shields were made of pure gold pure gold and uh when he died then one of his son after there was some kind of a financial strain on Israel he he got those guards to melt their Shields and sell out the gold and made them go with silver Shields and then when things got more financially worse that's a Believer selling out slow slow in increment you know right there the silver got of value and so he down the silver until the story ended that they end up with shields of brass and you know grass is a symbol of judgment right so he sold out uh but he didn't just sell out like that he he wanted to appear like you still have faith in God and he's still believing and following the message meanwhile slowly behind the scenes he's decaying spiritually going into a Decay by selling out one little thing to another and the little foxes start spoiling out the b right amen am I talking about you you know yourself search your own heart you're here not in my presence but in the presence of the Lord you got to search your own heart and see exactly where you are and that's the reason why brother gr said this is the problem going to be presented in our age because the devil will be so strong in the world Amen that Believers if their names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life he says every single one of the others will be deceived right only those whose names are written in the book right and then another place he says if you make a claim that you are a Christian you're child of God the devil is sure to come and test that right is that right anything you claim the devil is going to come and test that claim to see if you really mean it I'm here oh my goodness the devil is going to come and test you to see if you really believe that you are you anything you say praise the Lord he's going to come and check your out to see if you're solidly founded so that's what I'm trying to tell you if you have want to have faith that's unshakable amen let the devil come let the white wind go there here I stand upon the Water of God Eternal amen glory to his wonderful name glory to God hallelujah no amount of money so Solomon the wisest man is telling us embrace the truth and buy the truth but sell it not amen hallelujah second Timothy 3:16 all scripture is given by inspiration of God and it's profitable for Doctrine for reprove for correction for instruction and righteousness s it not I am saying friends it's time we stop being laid back and just C our Chris we got to go out and declare independence day is that right from the devil from the world from the flesh from the denominational stuff up I declare independence Hallelujah am I'm standing with the word with Christ my king Hallelujah and I declare independence and the freedom of the liberty of the children of God that's what praise God forever more Hallelujah I'm also declaring Emancipation Proclamation amen yes devil you had me like a slave yes yes I work hard for you devil but praise God thank God whom the son of man sets free that's free [Applause] in amen listen we got to be fired up and ready to go with this gospel that we have it's no time for you to staring uh staring the kings of Ammon and all these Kings like Saul scared them and would chop their heads off because look so rich and dignified no you got to hold to God's unchanging hand take that word and hold the sword of God hallelujah tell the truth no matter who it is or where it comes from tell the word of God and let God take control of everything else amen listen I've said this for years we may change the method of how we are carrying the gospel but we can never change the message the message can remain the same and brother said it and the way he said it was well you know we had the bicycle age you know we had the cart the age of the cart where they found out you could make a rum wheel and get a cart to carry more wi and then they get something else they got a bicycle and then you know they got the horse and carriage and finally we got cars and now we got all kinds of other things he's just showing the progression of how people are transported goods are transported and he actually was trying to give us that truth that uh the method of how you carry the gospel may change and it has to change but the basic gospel and this message that don't change is that right that's what we have to understand and some people will will will will be hum up on how you are carrying it rather than seeing that you carrying the same P message that was was delivered unto the saintes and that's what we got to fight for that's what we got to uh contend for and that's what we will never sell out but hold of God's unchanging hand Romans 8:35 to39 who shall separate us from the love of God shall tribulation no Triumph no or distress or persecution no or if up today some fam your cupboard is there with nakedness you left with one one change of clothes or Peril or sword as it is written for thy say we are killed all the day long we are acced sheep for the slaughter but n in all these things we are more than conquerors to him that love us for I persuaded Hallelujah are you persuaded oh my you don't want to be like the kings that said I'm almost persuaded oh almost the song says but lost amen a Miss is as good as a m so I am fully persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able nothing is able to separate us from the love of God which is in Jesus Christ Our [Applause] Lord like to separate you from the truth that Jesus died in Calvary and he died for our sins right there yes the devil would like to set separate you from the truth that he wasn't born of a virgin he like to separate you from God's grace and put your life into disgrace but I believe that we serve a god rich and mercy am hallelujah praise God I'm trying to give you truths that you can Embrace I'm given to you the essential truth of God's word that we are supposed to embrace I can in he heing because of the blood of Christ through Isaiah 53 glory to God hallelujah I believe that he was W for our transgress bruis for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his Christ we are I believe brother sister I believe that we serve a one and true and living God Amen you believe that amen they have their three Gods that's all right for them but we believe in one God here Israel the Lord th God is one Lord you must be established on that and you must Embrace that truth so that even anybody comes to you with any other form of doctrine of a million gods or two or three or four gods or one ever however they want to present it care Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord and the Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the yes you must firmly Embrace that truth and not in a shallow light way taken lightly and and switching back and forth no there's only one God and his name is Jesus Christ and not mhammad but will [Music] is hallelujah we believe and I we have to embrace the truth that baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for in no other name given on the heaven whereby we must be saved by the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord Embrace that truth amen and don't go switching back and forth in your mind or in your heart where somebody just comes uh to your knock on your door and said let me do some Bible study with you and the next thing you know they start to tell you yeah well you know he was a God but he wasn't the almighty God and uh you know he was a prophet and everything else like that but he really wasn't the god of the prophets and you know uh like that and and and then your mind start to get a little fuzzy and you wondering you know but if your faith is EST and firly on the word you canot you can even sit there and and smile until they finished with their long talk by time you talk one or two sentences they're ready to pick up their books and [Applause] run because you never see a bunch of chickens chasing an eagle to eat him but the moment go chicken see an legle Circle above the barard they're running for cover is that right because they know hey that's the real thing now that's I mean that's a scary looking bird Hallelujah the word of God is in them and it's quick and sharper than a ding sword glory to God hallelujah so we believe in immersion in water in the name of Jesus Christ we believe that it's not to be sprinkling where I dip my hands in a with a lace and cief in some holy water soal and sprinkle it to the east to the west north south up down and sprinkle some on you and say you are now baptized now that's I want to ask that person now your mother is dead uh it said okay we leave her on the ground and I just pick a handful of dust for girl and Sprint it on her and say now you are buried no that person's life is still be sticking up the entire church you got to be baptized in water and in the name of Jesus Christ where you completely immersed amen the Bible tells us that John Jesus and Jesus went down into the water John baptized him and the Bible says and he comeing up out of the water means he was in and he was down in the water and he came up then the spirit of God desend upon him like a oh my praise God we believe that amen we need to embrace the truth that there is a genuine infilling of the Holy Ghost do you believe the of the Holy Ghost amen amen praise the name of the Lord Jesus hallelujah or you believe just the infilling of the word amen that's just filling water water pot praise God but you need that word to forment and when it forment it becomes explosive you can't sit still you it it caus you to run with the message of the hour it makes you want to tell somebody you can't shut your mouth and keep it to yourself you you sell out your own pride and your own fear and your own doubts and everything else and you share the word of God we don't know what the effects will be because we are the generation that are preaching to souls in prison now Hallelujah are you following that type you follow him then he go down into hell then he preach the spiritual presence but while he was preaching to those Spirits in prison at the other hand he released the other saints that were Bound in there also that's what we're doing now we are now him revealed and we and this world and the situation that we're living in this is now hell on Earth it's hell on Earth and right now preaching to the spirits that now are in prison and at the same time releasing those whose names are in that L Book of Life the last set of them we are calling them out brother calls us evening time evangelism God said to me go my Bri evening time evangelism he says we got to do that because we don't care whe it's one of them black boys over there in Africa or where it's somebody up in some m somewhere when the last one comes in this goes up Hallelujah so the pastor we we uh support missionary programs not just in this church but wherever God would direct you mainly in the church you need to support your church mainly but my brothers and sisters support missionary programs because we don't know where that last one is amen and we have to support my friends in every possible way amen the preaching of the Gospel amen embrace the truth of a holy life Holiness unto the Lord without which no man can see the Lord no sense talking about message message message out the face of an Angel and the soul of a devil coming to church look so P but at the same time living such a ungodly worldly life no we got to start changing our life little by little amen praise the Lord little by little he's changing my way amen I don't expect you to change overnight unless God does a Mir in your life amen but God is working on us there's a song that says please be patient with me God is not done he's not finished working on me yet he's finished building the building amen praise the Lord so let's get patience with what we not un pray for Hallelujah
