we're going to press forward because what you're hungering for this morning what you have need of this morning whether you're conscious of of it or not God knows you have need of it amen because he knows our steps amen and we just want to flow with the Holy Spirit this morning amen hallelujah amen let us go to First Peter 5:6 i enjoyed the worship i enjoyed the song special i enjoyed even the opening prayer that we had in the deacon's room i I just rejoice in them amen we're missing a few brethren this morning but you're going to see why amen you're going to see why hallelujah my title this morning is if we just hold our positions but my subject is recognizing when we are under a spiritual attack very important amen amen hallelujah i'm going to take my hour and a half so don't worry if you're in the spirit it's going to feel like 20 minutes if you're not get in the spirit because it's going to feel like eternity amen hallelujah hallelujah 1 Peter 5:6 amen humble yourself therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your cares upon him for he carth for you be sober be viligent because your adversary the devil has a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all grace who had called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you amen ephesians 6:10 hallelujah i'm going to read at the beginning i'm going to read two scriptures you You can have your seat but I'm going to read a few scriptures to lay a background amen so that we may see in the word our position and we see right here humble yourself god will exalt you in due time he carth for you be viligent your adversary the devil but we are called to his eternal purpose and glory and after it's all said and done we will be strengthened we will be established in the faith we will be strengthened amen and settled and perfect thank you Lord amen amen glory to the word of God amen ephesians 6:10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand put stand in that evil day and having done all that's what we got to do do all that you can do to stand stand therefore having your loins girded about with truth and having the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shut with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all take the shield of faith wherewith you be able to quench he didn't say he didn't say you're not going to be able or you might be able but you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked amen take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God amen let us pray father thank you for your love grace and mercy this morning thank you for Calvary father I place myself behind the cross this morning i place everybody here behind the cross that precious blood of Jesus the life of God's own son lord you said it is finished there's nothing we can do this morning that you haven't already done there's nothing we can't heal nobody this morning that you already haven't healed we can't deliver nobody that you haven't already delivered but Lord today as we hear your word may we stand as soldiers of the cross may we stand in faith this morning may we take the Lord's side this morning and stand for the Lord and stand for the word of God amen and then we'll go forth and believe what you have already done Lord amen and then that's when miracles and signs and wonders and transformation and change will break out amongst your people because it's already finished it's here this morning it's here in the atmosphere it's hanging over everybody's head what they have need of cuz you have prepared it before the foundations of the world father may they pull it down this morning by grabbing it by believing it simply walk it out and knowing it's for them this morning lord oh God in simplicity reveal yourself in the same we commit ourselves to thee now we bind you said bind whatever you find on earth will be found in heaven we bind the power of Satan we bind his activities we bind doublemindness we bind doubt we bind fear we bind unbelief we bind every contrary spirit that will come against the word of God every opinion every thought that is contrary to the word of God not my thoughts not my word but the word of God this morning in the name of Jesus Christ and we loose father your spirit upon your people and upon us in Jesus name amen you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord amen so we see here in the scriptures hallelujah that we're in a great battle amen we're in a great warfare are you in a great warfare this morning amen if we're walking in the spirit and living in the spirit Amen then we're in a great warfare this morning hallelujah amen hallelujah amen we back connected here good i like my hands when you're When you're in a fight you don't want to have one hand tied up you want both hands amen amen hallelujah hallelujah we're walking in the spirit living in the spirit amen hallelujah and when we're we when we have come and and and God called us and we're born again amen our life has changed a revelation struck us amen amen which opened and changed everything i can only speak by experience amen that my whole life changed my whole concept of life my whole thought pattern everything was turned upside down amen like a new birth is a mess and your life becomes a mess but it brings you into a new dimension a new life amen you look and you see the world that you used to live in the carnal mind the flesh amen and now you see that you're walking and living in the spirit amen and only people will understand as that word progresses more and more in life amen as God's rapture is taking place here amen as God's bride is maturing as she's putting on the word amen you must be walking in the spirit amen to recognize what God is doing amen it's not what man is doing it's not what any pastor is doing it's what God is doing and performing amen amen god placed something on my heart amen i I I got many things on my heart this morning there's about six or seven messages wrapped up in this one right here amen but he placed something on my heart amen he placed something in my experience that I've been going through and I know if you're walking in the spirit which I believe I'm walking in the spirit you're going through some of the same things amen and that's what it's all about this morning saints is to bring the word of God to make you recognize as you're walking in the spirit what we're up against amen amen amen hallelujah so you don't look at me for some great message this morning you don't look at any preacher for any great message amen or how I can deliver it or how I can bring it or how I can organize it i'm doing a slideshow for the first time if it you know praise God I hope it works out good amen you give me your criticism afterwards so I can improve it but it's not about that amen it's not about me standing here i don't want to be glorified you don't want to be glorified we want to lift up Jesus Christ amen amen if we recognize that he's in our midst amen hallelujah if you can sit where you're sitting recognize that Jesus Christ is present here today hallelujah if you can believe that with your heart things would take place hallelujah this would happen amen i would have to minister amen it would just he would just have his way and move amongst us at the right we need amen he doesn't need me to speak he doesn't need nobody to speak into your hearts he can speak into your hearts amen amen but he hasn't provided way if that's the choice amen because we are stubborn because we have this flesh that we're dealing with because we are going through things just like brother Graham the angel said "I always have to push you brother Graham through the pipe and push you and push you to do God's will." Just imagine that when we look back we see the prophet amen a mighty prophet indeed amen when we look back and see don't look at him any higher than what he is amen or else you're going to get offline here amen god had to push him and push him and push him into his position and reveal things and reveal things and be there and deliver him and set him free as he's going along just like you and me yes no different yes we only glorify one person and that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah amen hallelujah i love you hallelujah amen revelations 19:6 I heard as it was a voice from a great multitude as the voice of many waters and as the voice of the mighty thunder saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnimate reignth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor unto him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready amen and it was granted unto her that she be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints amen this is not just letter to me when Jesus stood up in the in the in the temple in the synagogue when it was time for him to fulfill his position he read out the scriptures amen and he said "I have come god has anointed me to heal the delivered the brokenhearted now." And he closed the scriptures and he said "This day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears." I believe the word of God is being fulfilled again in our ears amen amen yes sir hallelujah let us be glad let us rejoice because the marriage has come amen amen it's here now amen it's taking place this morning hallelujah amen i hope the marriage of the lamb is taking place in your heart this morning amen hallelujah glory to God in Galatians 5:16 "This I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary one to another so that you cannot do the things that you would but if you be led by the spirit you are not under the law you are not under this flesh you are not under the law of the letter amen you are in the spirit catching the information of God the inspiration of God for your life amen that's what we need more than anything is the revelation and inspiration to guide us and to lead us amen amen if we're only led by the flesh and we're only led by the law it's going to lead you and keep you in captivity those who are led by the spirit of God are the sons and daughters of God amen and the flesh fights against the spirit and they're contrary one to another yes so let's die to the flesh amen and let's crucify the flesh amen the carnal mind let's bring it under captivity and under subjuggestion to the word of God amen that's where your successes and I tell you 90% of our battles 90% of our prayer requests 90% of our struggles is because we're in the flesh we're in the carnal life yes and we need to break out of that saints you are called you are predestinated to go higher than that you are built and made by God the seat of God inside of you can rise above any challenge any circumstance amen any situation that you go through yes amen glory to God philippians 2:9 wherefore God has also highly exalted him and given him a name above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in the earth and under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father wherefore my brethren as ye have always obeyed not in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and with trembling it's not your brother or your sister it's not your husband or your wife that's going to work out your salvation work out your own salvation amen don't hide don't justify look in the mirror of the word of God amen let your life be looking in the mirror and face the music as they say face what you're going through i have to face my flesh i have to face my weaknesses i have to face the generational things that that that Satan tried to hand down to me i got to face the everything in my life right but I got the word i got the promise i got the blood i got the guarantee amen hallelujah he's with me amen thank you Lord so do you saints you got the guarantee this morning hallelujah there is no guarantee like the one he gives yes amen hallelujah amen the power every need every circumstance every problem will bow amen everything will bow your confession confess in Jesus Christ the word and every situation shall come under subjection to your confession thank you Jesus what you speak is what you believe amen because out of the heart speaketh what are you speaking this morning what are you confessing are you glorifying the things that that Satan has put upon your life no or are you glorifying what God has said about you satan through even through our birth amen through our ancestors has come down through the line and has given us things from birth amen you hear a lot of people say "Oh my family has this oh uh you know my family has cancer my family has this my family has mental problems this bang bang." It's all come down to the line but it's what we confess out of our mouths i'm not confessing that now that my eyes have been opened Amen that has been broken amen that starts right here amen hallelujah god stopped it amen and break it yes now I got to believe and speak it that's right yes amen what the word says about me amen it's a different thing saints when you're rejoicing and and and and and saying amen here but it's a different thing when you walk out there it's a different thing when you get challenged it's a different thing when you get attacked in the midst of it yes i know for myself amen i know a real God i know the power of God but I know there's a real devil yes and I know the power of persuasion the power of the flesh the power of the carnal mind that can come upon you and I got to stand at that time amen amen and fight and fight thus sayeth the Lord thus sayith the Lord you got to fight [Applause] if you're not you're being defeated and taken over that's true that's true oh I might look excited up here but I'm under an anointing i'm under a revelation here that is true satan just break into it amen just break into me Lord whatever your will is show me let me move in the spirit let me move in deliverance amen hallelujah amen glory to God do you feel like you're fighting a battle that is getting the best of you do you feel like it's squeezing the life out of you taking your very spiritual breath away from you at times people on this earth families marriages are under such great attack like never before in history all the seven church ages are combined here the greatest victory that the church the bride of Jesus Christ is going to have is in this day amen amen amen the rapture in this day is going to prove to the world and everybody that Jesus Christ is the one and true God amen nobody no other God stands beside him amen he stands alone yes amen hallelujah amen [Music] and Daniel 12:1 "And at that time shall Michael stand the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was seen there was a nation even to the same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered amen glory at that time thy people shall be delivered are you that people glory to God everyone that is found written in the book everyone glory to God now I want to just lay a little bit of I've been laying a background i want to get a quote here from brother Brandham i think when brother Brandham God gave brother Brandham the greatest battle ever fought he said "The Lord has given me this for the church and it's time to bring it." You're the church amen he wasn't talking about Jeffersonville back then only talking about you you're the church amen i thought of the order of the heavenly host not one of them is out of place that's what we ought to come to this morning to get in place yes sir to get in order amen amen everyone keeps its time perfectly god's great army i thought of the soldiers and how that the moon would happen to get out of order the earth would be covered again with water just in a few minutes the earth would be just like it was when God decided to have us here on it it was without form and void and darkness and water was upon the breath of the earth and if that moon the bride would ever move it would do the same thing again when the moon the bride rocks a little bit away from the earth and the tides come up when it goes down just follow the tides it's God's great army and when I thought about that being God's great army there and then I begin to think not one of those get out of their place oh God they all set in place and if there's a move in anywhere of them it's because and it will affect this earth we just see the results of it now and when them moving into their other spots it affects I believe it affects amen i believe we're under spiritual attack amen the devil is attacking us attacking the body attacking the bride of Jesus Christ because he knows it affects this morning many people have been attacked that have to be here this morning right and it affects and this is why we need to stand this is why we need to be in order in our positions amen hallelujah we just see the results of it and I thought of it if that great heavenly host like that has to keep his place and make everything in order how about the disorder of the earthly host when one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually to strive to keep the order of the spirit amen that's why we have one another that's why we battle together that's why we pray one for another amen that's why we confess our sins one to another so we can continually strive to keep the order of the spirit amen that's why we look we are our brothers and our sister's keeper if we see one not walking in the spirit we go after them because we know it's just an attack of the devil amen hallelujah and we would to God this morning that everyone would bring this to a real healing healing service that we could keep this part this group gathered under this roof this morning in such harmony that the Holy Spirit would place every member of the body that is here this morning in such harmony till there wouldn't be such as be such a spontaneous healing of soul and body amen think about it yes the harmony of and of the spirit of God moving in the spirit of God is here it's here the healing the deliverance everything you have need of is here this morning it follows you it's your theophony it speaks to you it hooves you it covers you it persuades you it convicts you it's here if we just hold our positions we've had many wars and we'll have plenty more but do you realize there's only two powers in the universe all our differences between nations and each other and everything that mounts up to two powers and two kingdoms all the rest are little minor things that are connected to one power or the other power right think about it amen think about it and those powers is God's power and Satan's power every war every disorder everything that comes along is either controlled by God's power or Satan's power amen your life is either influenced from above or below amen nowhere's house yes from above or below choose this day who you'll serve it's cut and dry god makes it cut and dry are you on the Lord's side then take up the armor take up the word of God get in your position hold your position and be a soldier and fight fight against your enemy amen yourself amen and place yourself on the battlefront place yourself on the field yes and fight hallelujah thank you Lord you see an enemy and you're you got your gun and you're at war and you see your enemy coming through those doors pointing a gun at you you're just going to sit there like this that's what so many of us do are you going to take your gun and you're going to aim and you're going to fire before he fires at you and you're going to kill the enemy think about it saints think about what you're doing you're going to see by the end of the service you're going to see something by the grace of God you're going to see something that you're going to recognize a spiritual attack upon your life i don't know what you're going through i don't know how the devil's attacking you but let the Holy Ghost even if you don't know expose him this morning and if it's sin just repent amen god has given us the grace to repent yes don't let pride don't let spiritual pride keeping you away from your deliverance this morning recognize that we're nothing without him amen now watch and there's the power of life and the power of death and Satan's power he's got is a perverted power of God it isn't no real power think about it all the trouble all the trouble you see in the world all the trouble that you have all the trouble that you're going to see in a minute here is no real power i believe that with all my heart this morning because I believe God has the power amen i believe power lies with inside me amen amen by the revelation of the word death is only life perverted a lie is the truth mistold adultery is an act mis misused everything Satan's got is something that was perverted and we are here today sitting here one or the other power is going to control us he says right here so let's cast out the evil one amen he's speaking here the prophet to you and to me our lives let's cast out the evil one amen we have to cast out the evil one out of our lives amen we have the power we have the birth we have the Holy Ghost we got the blood we got the promises to take his word stop crying brother says the Lord said to brother "Stop crying stop crying speak go forth." Joshua didn't cry he knew what he had to do he knew his commission he knew his battle he knew the ground he had to take and he just went and did it when he needed that son to stand still he told him to stand still what am I saying it's you it's your battle it's your life it's the things that you have to overcome you've been placed a commission and anointed to take the word of God god wants to see every member of his body he has to prove and he will prove and he's determined to prove his victory on the cross in your life we need to understand that saints we need to recognize that in your life your part that you have to play let us take our positions like the stars of the heaven that like the Bible speaks wondering stars over in the book of Jude foaming out of their shame their own shame we don't know what wonder and stars wonder if this is right wonder if that is right wonder if it will happen wonder if it could be i wonder if that is still taking place in your mind this morning wonder and start wonder if this is right wonder if that is right wonder if it will happen wonder how it could be don't wonder stay like the stars of the heaven as a real soldier here pulls the duty stand there believe in believing life and death stands before you this morning you know that life and death stands before us every time we come in the house of God and we hear the word of God life and death sits right in front of you this morning whatever you will choose recognize that when you're under a spiritual attack now I'm just going to start to get into my message amen that was just trying to lay a background to us to see who we are and see what we're in amen you have it right up there while I'm going to read i'm just going to go through a lot of things reading here now amen but I believe it will be a blessing hallelujah many people are facing spiritual struggles as they attempt to advance in the things of God one of the primary tricks of the enemy is to get a person deceived and not realizing the depths of what is taking place in their lives isn't that the truth often times people assume that the struggles they are facing is just natural battle yet just beneath the surface there is something more far complex taking place they they are under a spiritual attack what is it what is a spiritual attack a spiritual attack is a series of events coordinated by demonic realm in order to abort promises in your life shipwreck faith oppress believers and stall on your destiny paul reminds us that Satan should take advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices amen in 2 Corinthians 2:11 we must not be ignorant of his devices amen we must know our enemy any nation that goes up against another nation has to study that nation to see if they can fight against them and see if they can battle against them whether they'll go against them or not and I'm trying to bring the word the word is trying to be brought every week to show you that you are a nation of God that can go against Satan's nation amen and defeat him amen this nation is stronger than that nation hallelujah you got to believe that dog amen believe it when you're in the middle of the attack don't scream it to me here right now make it feel like you know that you're spiritual something believe it let's get down to it if I'm on the battlefield and I have somebody beside me when I'm training with him or he can shoot the gun he he looks brave and tough but when I'm out there and balls are flying by my head want to take my life I want him beside me i want to fight with me that's right i want to know that he's a soldier that he's real that he's ready to fight he's ready to die give us life for us hallelujah yeah yes Lord amen [Music] amen the Bible tells us that the devil has various plots and schemes he uses against human beings many people wrongly assume that Satan is stupid believe me he's a lot smarter than you yeah he's a lot smarter than any one of us put together that's why we stand behind the word we stand behind our king amen we take his sword not our sword and we go forth yet he has studied the thoughts and actions and behavior of the human since the beginning of time he knows how to tempt the people he studied you since birth familiar spirits are around your life a lot of times you don't even realize what you're being led and what you're being guided by why you make decisions why you make choices why you do certain things why you say certain things at certain times amen yes a lot of the times until you come into the recogn recognizing of the spirit of God inside of you and the revelation of the word of God I'm just telling you the truth it's a lot of demonic inspiration from below amen that's why we have to break into this saints amen and move in the revelation of this he knows [Music] you he knows how to get to you he knows how to pull your number oh if you struggle or is passed down not that you're accepting I hope you're not with fear he knows how to do it he knows how to bring circumstances around your life to raise that level of fear to deceive you to blind you yes to paralyze you to get you out of your position anxiety worry sickness all these things he's not stupid saints that's why it's going to take a people with revelation to recognize this to walk and live and and be victorious in the spirit medical advancement has begun and has identified warning signs when a person's having a heart attack they get discomfort pre pressure in their center of their chest pain both arms shortness of breath see the spreading of awareness of events mean of warning signs are out there that can save people's lives don't you think we have warning signs somebody said to somebody one time he said "Brother I feel like I'm dying." He looked at he looked at it he says "Maybe you are dying you feel like you're dying spiritually you feel like you're dried up you feel like you're going nowhere maybe you are you don't have to stay like that amen but you have to recognize it amen you don't recognize your condition doesn't change your position if you're a son and daughter of God but if you don't recognize your condition you'll never be able to change it and it'll beat on you it'll beat on you brother it'll give you more bow scars make your life more miserable satan will try to do everything he can to destroy your life cuz he knows he can't destroy the seed inside of you that's right but he doesn't want you to live victorious he doesn't want you to be victorious in in the word of God in your position and who you are right he doesn't want to see prosperity he doesn't want to see blessings upon your life right but that's why we have to take the word that's why we got to fight this morning saints that's why we got to recognize that we're constantly under attack we're in a war you go tell those soldiers that are fighting in the in in the trenches and fighting in the front lines to relax take it easy oh they're always on alert you find your peace in Christ you find your rest in Christ amen you find your victory amen in in in the word of God as you overcome amen we got a wedding supper we're going to amen we got a time of peace we got a time of rest but right now that is in our soul but on the outward is a fight it's a constant fight it's a constant awareness of attacks that are coming upon our lives amen amen hallelujah number one change the slide follow me brother amen loss of spiritual desire you're under attack wow brother I You're under attack when you lost that first love even Jesus himself in the book of Revelation said "Thou has lost thy first love do thy first works and repent." Get back saints shake it off it's an attack on your life many different avenues it might have come through your your finances might have come through your kids it might have come through your flesh and and your mind and different things it was an attack so that you lose your desire for this word of God you see Satan knows if he can take all this away from us how we will not be that hot potato that he cannot handle we'll just be something that he's be thrown around and no way Jesus Christ is going to allow his bride to be thrown around that's right amen no way he Hallelujah he purchases his life supper amen no way yes that's his bride amen [Music] the goal of any spiritual attack is to turn you away from God what God wants you to do in your life the first warning sign of the attack is a loss of spiritual desire you don't you don't live by feelings alone but there's a big
