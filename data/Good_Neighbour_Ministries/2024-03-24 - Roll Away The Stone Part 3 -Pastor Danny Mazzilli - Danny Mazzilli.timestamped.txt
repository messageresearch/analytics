[48:49] hallelujah glory to God today you know
[48:53] um we want to take a look briefly here
[48:57] and then we're going to really get into
[48:58] um you know the the the final thought of
[49:00] what I've got here today but this
[49:03] morning I I want to start by you know
[49:05] looking into some of the stones that we
[49:07] need to roll away in our own
[49:09] lives you know life you know throws all
[49:12] kinds of Curves and you know we look
[49:14] back on our lives and we see all kinds
[49:16] of situations that are placed upon Our
[49:19] Lives growing up you know uh things that
[49:23] that are generational things that we
[49:25] come out of scar s and all kinds of
[49:28] situations that we deal with in life but
[49:30] then then we come to a place where we
[49:33] are introduced to the word of God Amen
[49:37] and when you come into a place where
[49:39] you're introduced to the word of God God
[49:41] says I'm going to roll away every
[49:44] stone every you know every um every
[49:49] shame every guilt every fear and every
[49:53] doubt everything that that that you know
[49:56] that that was placed upon your life as a
[49:58] result of your upbringing and your
[50:00] experiences you come to God and you come
[50:03] to the Living God and and you know we're
[50:05] talking about the resurrection here we
[50:07] we've been talking about Christ in the
[50:10] power of his resurrection we've been
[50:12] talking about him being uh the the
[50:15] resurrection and the power now in our
[50:17] lives right now and we need situations
[50:21] that that you know that need to be dealt
[50:22] with in our lives right now and so we
[50:25] come into this experience
[50:27] and this walk with God and he says I can
[50:30] deal with all of that I can roll away
[50:33] every stone that that that that's
[50:35] holding you back from being all that I
[50:39] want you to be not what you want to be
[50:42] it's not about what what you know the
[50:44] plans that we have he says I got plans
[50:47] for you amen I want those plans in my
[50:50] life I want those miracles in my life I
[50:55] listen if he wants me to roll away some
[50:57] stones that I got to deal with
[50:58] situations in my life I got to get rid
[51:01] of unbelief I got to I I got to resist
[51:03] the enemy I got to resist the devil amen
[51:06] praise God and so I want to look at just
[51:09] a few things that you know that the Lord
[51:11] just gave me some things that he says
[51:13] just bring these things you know because
[51:15] these are areas we're all human we're
[51:18] all dealing with th things in our lives
[51:20] amen praise God and God wants us to be
[51:22] set free you know so so the first thing
[51:25] that you know that that he brought to me
[51:28] was Pride or
[51:31] self-sufficiency these are stones that
[51:34] that that need to be rolled away in our
[51:35] lives and what happens is as we you know
[51:38] mature and as we become adults and we
[51:41] you know things come upon our lives and
[51:44] and we start to take on certain ways and
[51:47] attitudes and and the moment that you
[51:49] start to think that you can do life on
[51:53] your own that's the moment that you
[51:55] start to walk away away from God Amen
[51:58] there is absolutely no way that you can
[52:02] do it alone you see one of the things
[52:04] about coming to Christ he says he that's
[52:07] heavy laden let him come unto me he said
[52:10] come unto me I will give you rest amen
[52:15] you know but people want to do it on
[52:16] their own people want to hang on to
[52:19] their Traditions they want to hold on to
[52:21] all the things that that that they
[52:23] thought was the truth and meanwhile it's
[52:26] it's hindering them from moving on with
[52:29] God Amen you can expect your walk with
[52:32] God to begin to deteriorate the moment
[52:35] that you think you can do it on your own
[52:38] you'll never do it remember this is a
[52:41] call in this hour it is Christ come down
[52:47] to gather each and every son and
[52:50] daughter of God into the body of
[52:54] Christ it's the body of Christ CH that's
[52:57] going to go in the
[52:59] Rapture it's the same spirit that raised
[53:02] up Christ from the dead if it dwells in
[53:05] you so this is a body movement and you
[53:09] think that you can you don't need to go
[53:11] to church you don't need to belong to a
[53:13] Ministry you don't need to be under the
[53:15] leadership of the holy spirit in a in a
[53:18] god ordained Ministry you are doing it
[53:21] you're going it on your
[53:23] own you're G to be you you you've missed
[53:26] the boat you've missed the boat you need
[53:30] to be a part of what God is doing in
[53:32] this hour we're going to move
[53:35] on so we'll burn out from trying to do
[53:38] things on our own power especially
[53:41] spiritual things and when we're worn out
[53:44] and we're tired it puts a distance
[53:46] between us and God you don't feel like
[53:49] it you know when you get worn out you
[53:51] don't want to go to church you don't
[53:53] want to Fellowship you don't want to
[53:55] read the word you're discouraged you're
[53:57] knocked down because you're trying to
[53:58] fight a battle on your own you can't do
[54:01] it you need him amen praise God listen
[54:06] in John 663 Jesus said this he said the
[54:09] spirit gives eternal life but the flesh
[54:13] human effort it doesn't accomplish
[54:16] much it's by the spirit you can
[54:19] accomplish all the Natural Things of
[54:22] this life what is it that you would gain
[54:24] the whole world but yet you would lose
[54:27] your
[54:29] soul praise God in our human effort we
[54:34] cannot please God it's only faith that
[54:36] pleases God you want to try and pray 12
[54:40] hours a day you want to go to church
[54:42] seven days a week like our Catholic
[54:44] friends do you know they think that by
[54:46] going to church and by saying more hail
[54:49] Mar's and more our fathers that that's
[54:51] going to produce Jesus Christ in their
[54:53] life no it's not what the word of God
[54:57] says amen it's not what the word is
[55:01] producing in this hour amen praise God
[55:05] hallelujah but when we lean on the holy
[55:07] spirit for
[55:09] everything all things when we esteem
[55:12] ourselves
[55:14] small and in need of help then almighty
[55:17] God comes and takes
[55:19] over he realizes that you're humbling
[55:22] yourself to his program remember this is
[55:25] about his plan amen this is about the
[55:28] Plan of Redemption and our role in the
[55:31] plan you can go to the next slide I
[55:33] believe
[55:34] that's you know recognizing our role in
[55:37] Redemption that's what this is all about
[55:40] amen praise God so you can pray all day
[55:42] long you can do all that you want amen
[55:46] but it's not gonna it's not going to
[55:48] please God by you worshiping him in your
[55:51] flesh you need to worship Him in spirit
[55:54] and in truth amen in Psalms 10:4 it says
[55:58] the wicked through the pride of his
[56:00] countenance will not seek after God God
[56:04] is not in all his thoughts imagine that
[56:09] you see because his thoughts are on his
[56:12] own ability I got to go to school I
[56:14] gotta you know I I got to get this
[56:16] degree I got to get that degree you know
[56:18] degrees in knowledge and and in this
[56:22] world they're good if you're looking to
[56:24] improve your financial ability and
[56:27] capacity in the work space but when it
[56:30] comes with God if you get too too uh um
[56:35] in in information filled and uh science
[56:39] and and too many degrees and it it
[56:41] starts to take you away from God because
[56:43] science is not with God it tries to
[56:48] prove that God doesn't
[56:50] exist amen it's the opposite of the
[56:52] supernatural it relies on all natural it
[56:55] wants to EXP explain everything
[56:57] naturally you cannot explain God he is
[56:59] Supernatural amen amen so when Pride
[57:03] cometh then cometh shame but with lowly
[57:07] is
[57:08] wisdom when you humble when you trust
[57:12] when you obey the Holy Spirit just comes
[57:15] amen praise God Proverbs 1618 to 19
[57:19] Pride goeth Before Destruction and a
[57:21] hottie spirit before a fall better it is
[57:25] to be of humble spirit with the lowly
[57:29] than to divide the spoil with the proud
[57:33] praise God we need to roll away the
[57:35] stone of Pride amen glory to
[57:40] God impatience there's another
[57:43] one you know if you look back in the in
[57:45] the scriptures you go back into the Old
[57:47] Testament you look back at Abraham you
[57:49] look back at all the prophets they had
[57:51] to be patient they had to wait on God
[57:55] because they knew that it was only God
[57:58] that could do what God was showing them
[58:02] so as God is showing you your part in
[58:05] the word of God and you're you're
[58:06] placing into the body of Christ you're
[58:09] going to need to be patient you're not
[58:11] going to you don't need to be going
[58:13] ahead of God Amen you look at Joseph you
[58:16] look at Moses you look at no Noah they
[58:18] all waited on God if there's anything
[58:21] you need in order to walk with God and
[58:23] to walk well with God it's patience
[58:27] it's to them that wait upon the Lord he
[58:30] renews your strength he doesn't answer
[58:32] prayer when you want it to be answered
[58:35] amen he answers it exactly when you need
[58:38] it amen praise God Hallelujah the Bible
[58:42] says that without faith it's impossible
[58:44] to please God and so you you know trying
[58:47] to do things on your own and trying to
[58:49] figure things out on your own because of
[58:50] your impatience you're just you're just
[58:53] pushing the situation further down the
[58:56] road God's still going to accomplish
[58:58] everything that he needs to accomplish
[59:00] in your lives amen the Bible says in
[59:03] Hebrews uh Hebrews 6:15 and so after
[59:07] waiting patiently
[59:09] Abraham received what was
[59:12] promised and if we wait patiently and we
[59:15] serve the Lord patiently where God wants
[59:18] us where God's placed us where God has
[59:21] given you Faith to to to to do great
[59:25] things you'll know naturally where God
[59:27] is blessing you prospering you don't be
[59:30] looking anywhere else just look at where
[59:33] you are what you're doing and if God is
[59:35] blessing you then you're receiving Faith

[59:40] joyfully you're doing it with praise
[59:43] you're doing it with Thanksgiving you
[59:45] realize that the Supernatural is all
[59:47] over your office all over your position
[59:50] because you've submitted to it you're
[59:52] being patient to the Lord and you're
[59:53] allowing him to do it amen praise God if
[59:57] you are impatient person like me
[1:00:00] sometimes we all are come on everybody's
[1:00:04] got moments where they you know they
[1:00:06] just don't understand what's going on
[1:00:08] they get impatient they get angry they

[1:00:13] God okay but it it gets you nowhere it
[1:00:17] just gets you
[1:00:18] discouraged praise God but you know then
[1:00:22] you know it causes seeds of unbelief to
[1:00:24] begin to sew in your heart

[1:00:27] is looking for ways to plant seed of
[1:00:30] unbelief in you and so he looks when you
[1:00:32] get weak he looks that when you get
[1:00:34] impatient he looks to see when you start
[1:00:36] to say things that you shouldn't be
[1:00:38] saying you get into gossip instead of
[1:00:41] Fellowship you know we we need to be
[1:00:44] careful of all those things these are
[1:00:46] stones that need to be rolled away in
[1:00:48] our lives so that we can come out and be
[1:00:50] who we are and what God has made us to
[1:00:53] be roll away the Stone of impatience you

[1:01:53] us mystery is a part of our walk with
[1:01:56] God hallelujah listen you know I don't
[1:01:59] want to get ahead of myself I'm going to
[1:02:01] wait till we get to that part we cannot
[1:02:03] know all things the Bible says in Isaiah
[1:02:06] that as far as the heavens are from the
[1:02:08] earth that is how far God's thoughts are
[1:02:11] from our thoughts amen what you're
[1:02:14] saying to God is that you want to be in
[1:02:18] control when you're in pay you want to
[1:02:20] be in control I want to call the shots I
[1:02:22] want to say the way it should be you

[1:02:29] you know that you know you know you
[1:02:31] start to talk about things you start to
[1:02:33] plan things and before you know it if
[1:02:35] you sit back one of them's calling all
[1:02:37] the
[1:02:41] shots why because they want to be in
[1:02:43] control they want to know that that
[1:02:46] everything's going to be the way they
[1:02:47] want it they want to they don't want to
[1:02:49] leave any part of it to God's God's plan

[1:02:59] brother Mike went on a trip to Arizona
[1:03:01] he thought he was going just on a trip
[1:03:03] but God had something else in mind amen
[1:03:05] I don't know what it is but I know
[1:03:07] something happened because when you go
[1:03:09] by faith you're going to receive
[1:03:12] something you're going to see things I
[1:03:14] remember our first trip to Arizona
[1:03:17] there's a supernatural element around it
[1:03:19] and I knew right away oh you're going
[1:03:20] there something good going to happen
[1:03:23] Hallelujah because God moves in great
[1:03:26] ways when you're going under Faith under
[1:03:30] expectation under the knowledge of what
[1:03:33] God has done in our day that God had a
[1:03:35] prophet a Vindicated Prophet that he
[1:03:38] sent to the Earth just like Moses just
[1:03:41] like Elijah just like Ezekiel all these
[1:03:44] prophets of God that God had prepared
[1:03:47] and when the people recognized the the
[1:03:49] ones that recognized that they rejoiced
[1:03:52] in the word of the Lord and Supernatural
[1:03:56] took place all around their lives amen
[1:03:59] praise God glory to God we need to allow
[1:04:03] God's uh Mysteries and God's ways to
[1:04:06] work in our lives God knows your life
[1:04:10] God knows what you need Down the Road
[1:04:12] God knows exactly the turn that's coming
[1:04:15] but you sometimes you want to go so fast
[1:04:17] you want to you want to hit the the the
[1:04:19] pedal to the metal and before you know
[1:04:20] it right by the turn and you miss that
[1:04:24] blessing Hallelujah
[1:04:26] roll away the stone of needing to know
[1:04:30] everything people pleasing here's
[1:04:32] another one you see like look at these
[1:04:36] things like they're just simple things
[1:04:37] but God struck my heart he says just
[1:04:39] bring it just bring it PE I learned this
[1:04:43] one right from the mouth of the Lord
[1:04:45] Jesus right here in St John chapter 5:
[1:04:48] 41 I receive not honor from men Jesus
[1:04:53] was not interested in men
[1:04:56] honor praise God he was only looking to
[1:05:00] do one thing and that was to please the
[1:05:02] father please God fulfill the word that
[1:05:06] was destined in his life amen glory
[1:05:09] Jesus said I don't care about this is a
[1:05:11] contemporary English version now Jesus
[1:05:14] said I don't care about human praise the
[1:05:17] Apostle Paul repeats it over and over in
[1:05:19] his letters that he only seeks the
[1:05:22] approval of God and not men Galatians 1
[1:05:25] 10 Apostle Paul says am I now trying to
[1:05:28] win the approval of human beings or
[1:05:32] God or am I trying to please
[1:05:35] people because if I were still trying to
[1:05:38] please people I would not be a servant
[1:05:41] of Jesus
[1:05:43] Christ think about it you want to please
[1:05:47] your family you want to please your
[1:05:48] friends you know they have events and
[1:05:51] they have them on Saturdays and and then
[1:05:53] Sunday you know like they'll have it on
[1:05:54] Sundays and right away they'll expect
[1:05:56] you to be there but you know where your
[1:05:58] place is it's in the house of the Lord
[1:06:01] that's right that's where you please God
[1:06:04] and when you're there and they see you
[1:06:06] standing on God's word and that you're
[1:06:08] you've put God first in your life and
[1:06:11] that you're desires not to please man
[1:06:13] but to please God they see something in
[1:06:15] you that makes them realize that wow
[1:06:19] they're really serious about serving God
[1:06:22] yes we are amen now there's times where
[1:06:25] things will happen of course there's
[1:06:27] times you're going to go on vacation
[1:06:29] there's times you're going to miss
[1:06:30] certain events it's going to happen but
[1:06:33] your desire your heart your motives are
[1:06:36] not that and and nine out of 10 times
[1:06:39] you're going to be pleasing God and and
[1:06:42] not worrying so much about pleasing
[1:06:46] people amen praise God sometimes we do
[1:06:49] make you know concession but our
[1:06:51] concession is is also with a motive that
[1:06:55] God will do something and show something
[1:06:57] and reveal something to them amen
[1:07:00] because this call it's a supernatural
[1:07:03] call listen in in Galatians 1:10 now in
[1:07:07] uh the the original version for do I now
[1:07:10] persuade men or God or do I seek to
[1:07:13] please men or if I yet pleased men I
[1:07:15] should not be a servant of Christ but I
[1:07:18] certify you Brethren that the gospel
[1:07:21] which was preached of me is not after
[1:07:26] man so in other words he's making it
[1:07:29] very clear here listen I wasn't you
[1:07:31] could tell your family your friends
[1:07:33] listen nobody convinced me to go to that
[1:07:35] church nobody convinced me to be a part
[1:07:38] of that message Ministry and what God is
[1:07:41] doing in this hour when I saw recognize
[1:07:44] your day and its message something
[1:07:47] struck my heart something became a
[1:07:50] reality what do you mean recognize your
[1:07:52] day your day you see that's what's
[1:07:55] happen happened that's why you're so
[1:07:57] zealous for the Lord because you've
[1:07:59] recognized your day like Paul he says it
[1:08:01] wasn't man that convinced me he says for
[1:08:04] I receive for neither for I neither
[1:08:07] received it of man neither was I taught
[1:08:10] it now imagine Paul who was a theologian
[1:08:13] of the
[1:08:14] theologians he was taught under gilia
[1:08:16] himself on the word of God and knew God
[1:08:19] and knew the word like like could quote
[1:08:22] the scriptures and everything else and
[1:08:24] here he turns around and he denies any
[1:08:26] teaching of man but he says but by the
[1:08:30] revelation of Jesus Christ he made that
[1:08:34] clear that's how I stand and why I
[1:08:39] please God Amen Hallelujah most
[1:08:42] important opinion to us always must be
[1:08:46] what God
[1:08:47] thinks what
[1:08:49] God wants what he desires in our lives
[1:08:53] amen praise God hallelujah
[1:08:56] we need to roll away the
[1:08:58] stone of people
[1:09:03] pleasing praise God self-centeredness
[1:09:06] everything is not about
[1:09:09] you if you can never see yourself if
[1:09:11] Beyond yourself your walk with God will
[1:09:14] be hindered you got to be able to see
[1:09:17] God's plan God's desire God's goals
[1:09:21] God's purpose all those things have to
[1:09:24] be the Center focus of Our Lives not
[1:09:26] self-centered it'll hinder others
[1:09:29] too when all you want to talk about is
[1:09:32] yourself how's that going to how's that
[1:09:35] going to bless
[1:09:36] God praise God Amen we are called to be
[1:09:39] a part of the body we are called to
[1:09:42] serve others your desires cannot be the
[1:09:45] most important thing to you there there
[1:09:47] there must be room for
[1:09:50] others amen there must be room to listen
[1:09:53] this is a supernatural body Body of
[1:09:55] Christ that's moving under the unity of
[1:09:58] the spirit and the spirit can never go
[1:10:01] against itself so when you feel certain
[1:10:04] feelings within you that are putting you
[1:10:06] against a brother or a sister that's the
[1:10:10] devil plain simple I don't care call it
[1:10:13] whatever you want now sure there could
[1:10:15] be flaws on the brother or the sister
[1:10:17] there could be situations that they're
[1:10:19] dealing with but you you if you're more
[1:10:22] mature and you're you're able to see
[1:10:24] beyond that and to see the real plan of
[1:10:27] God and the purpose of God you'll see
[1:10:29] beyond the mistakes you'll see beyond
[1:10:31] the weakness you'll see the purpose of
[1:10:33] God you'll pray for them you'll project
[1:10:36] love into their lives you'll project
[1:10:38] love into their situations you'll do
[1:10:40] nothing but kindness you'll you'll say
[1:10:42] things that are only going to be kind
[1:10:44] you're going to you're going to lift
[1:10:45] them up more than you're going to lift
[1:10:46] yourself up you're going to you're going
[1:10:48] to do things that are going to bring you
[1:10:50] into that perfect Unity with God so that
[1:10:53] you can be that expression to them
[1:10:55] and so that God can be pleased with what
[1:10:58] you're
[1:11:00] doing we need to roll away the sewn of
[1:11:03] self
[1:11:05] centeredness distraction if there's ever
[1:11:08] been an age of distraction it's right
[1:11:11] now my God distraction in Matthew
[1:11:14] chapter 6 Jesus tells the parable of the
[1:11:16] sore and in it he mentions a class of
[1:11:20] seeds Mark
[1:11:22] 4:18 still others like seed swn among
[1:11:26] Thorns hear the word but the worries of
[1:11:30] this life the deceitfulness of wealth
[1:11:34] and the desires for other things come in
[1:11:37] and choke the word making it
[1:11:41] unfruitful there's so many things that
[1:11:44] can cause us to take our eyes off of the
[1:11:46] Lord Jesus but what he's doing in our
[1:11:49] lives we need to focus on that we can't
[1:11:53] allow the distractions of this life and
[1:11:55] and this this is the age of information
[1:11:58] this is the age where your phone is
[1:12:00] constantly in your
[1:12:02] hand the only time it's probably not in
[1:12:04] your hand is when you're in church and
[1:12:07] if you're in church and it's in your
[1:12:08] hand it's because you're taking
[1:12:13] notes praise God right because I know I
[1:12:16] have it in my hand sometimes praise God
[1:12:19] but you know there's so much distraction
[1:12:21] and if we're not careful we get
[1:12:24] distracted constantly and the minute
[1:12:26] that the enemy can get your your thought
[1:12:29] off into another place right away he
[1:12:32] cuts the channel between you and God
[1:12:35] it's as simple as that distraction so
[1:12:38] many distractions Jesus mentions three
[1:12:41] things that can distract us from God
[1:12:43] worries of this life and we all got
[1:12:47] them and don't tell me they don't
[1:12:49] distract you because they
[1:12:52] do they
[1:12:54] do got him in my life right now there's
[1:12:58] distractions there's situations my
[1:13:00] children this that thinking about you
[1:13:03] know like the setup with the garden
[1:13:04] centers and all these things that are
[1:13:06] going through my mind and the transition
[1:13:08] and and and being here at my post of
[1:13:11] Duty and all those things are constantly
[1:13:13] bombarding my mind over and over and
[1:13:15] over again and it's trying to distract
[1:13:18] me from doing what God wants me to do
[1:13:22] amen but it's it's it's the cares of the
[1:13:25] this life but one thing that always
[1:13:29] brings me
[1:13:31] back God is in control
[1:13:34] amen God started this
[1:13:37] work God is working everything out so
[1:13:41] that in the end he's going to get the
[1:13:43] victory amen and I benefit just being a
[1:13:46] part of the victory that's all because
[1:13:50] I've surrendered I've allowed him to do
[1:13:52] his whatever he needs to do in my life
[1:13:54] I've put your word before my face
[1:13:57] constantly oh God like David said so
[1:14:00] that so that the enemy cannot
[1:14:02] distract but he will but I will not
[1:14:05] allow it when he does I will resist him
[1:14:09] it's it's just part of who we are I say
[1:14:12] it all the time the enemy listen the
[1:14:15] devil's we hear all the time you know
[1:14:17] I'll hear a report of this my wife will
[1:14:18] tell me oh this is going on right now
[1:14:20] and this is this is what you know the
[1:14:22] the enemy is saying and this is I said
[1:14:24] yeah he's doing
[1:14:28] job he's doing his job you ever watch
[1:14:31] The Road
[1:14:32] Runner you remember the the rooster used
[1:14:34] to clock in and the minute he would
[1:14:37] clock in boom he was after that Road
[1:14:39] Runner and he was knocking him down left
[1:14:42] right and Center distracting him doing
[1:14:44] everything that he could to try and stop
[1:14:46] him he's doing his job our job is to
[1:14:50] resist the
[1:14:51] enemy our job is to put the word in
[1:14:54] front front of us replace the lie with
[1:14:57] the word because the word will overcome
[1:15:01] every circumstance and every situation
[1:15:04] praise God if we desire God above
[1:15:07] everything else it's I in our hearts
[1:15:10] that will cause us to prioritize and
[1:15:12] focus on god let's ask the Lord to rest
[1:15:16] our hearts on him and let's roll away
[1:15:19] the stone of
[1:15:22] distraction finally
[1:15:25] let's go to the next
[1:15:27] slide
[1:15:30] next go
[1:15:32] ahead now I've read this
[1:15:34] before but I connect this with
[1:15:37] tradition and
[1:15:40] religion you know people say boy you're
[1:15:42] really
[1:15:44] religious
[1:15:46] no
[1:15:48] religion is people's
[1:15:52] opinions of who God is and everybody's
[1:15:56] got a different interpretation on who
[1:15:58] God
[1:15:59] is religion is something that you
[1:16:02] connect yourself to as a human and you
[1:16:05] make it your Doctrine your teaching your
[1:16:11] understanding but let's read this
[1:16:14] cognitive
[1:16:16] dissonance sometimes people hold a core
[1:16:19] belief that is very strong and when they
[1:16:22] are presented with evidence that works
[1:16:24] against that core belief the new
[1:16:26] evidence cannot be
[1:16:28] accepted what a
[1:16:30] stone what a
[1:16:34] stone it creates a feeling that is
[1:16:37] extremely uncomfortable and it is called
[1:16:40] cognitive dissonance and because it is
[1:16:43] so important to protect the core belief
[1:16:47] people will rationalize ignore and even
[1:16:50] deny anything that does not fit in which
[1:16:55] that core belief even if it is the
[1:17:00] truth even if it is what will set them
[1:17:03] free from the chains of Sin from the UN
[1:17:06] which which we know that sin is
[1:17:09] unbelief now you you've read this before
[1:17:12] I've brought this before but it's a
[1:17:14] powerful statement and as we're going to
[1:17:17] move on now to the next you know to the
[1:17:19] next aspect of this uh service I want us
[1:17:23] to to to to get set in our minds and
[1:17:27] prepare our hearts and those that are
[1:17:30] out there that are listening in and
[1:17:31] listening in onto this service here your
[1:17:34] your your life is controlled by your
[1:17:37] thinking what you think about all day
[1:17:39] long is what you become amen and you you
[1:17:43] you're you're a creature of habit and
[1:17:45] you're a creature that loves to look for
[1:17:47] the easiest way you're looking for the
[1:17:50] easiest way and when truth gets
[1:17:52] presented to you it's it you know and
[1:17:55] and it's not in line with what you have
[1:17:58] been taught well wait a minute I was
[1:18:00] brought up uh baptism we baptize babies
[1:18:02] there's nowhere in the scripture where
[1:18:04] anybody ever baptized a baby it's as
[1:18:08] simple as that and if you're if your
[1:18:11] foundation see we don't we're not
[1:18:14] religious we are not religious this
[1:18:16] church is not religious it is
[1:18:19] spiritually filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:18:23] and the Holy Ghost leads you to the word
[1:18:25] of God and the word of God cannot lie
[1:18:29] and that's why we don't trust in our own
[1:18:32] ability as Men We Trust in the spirit of
[1:18:35] God leading us to the word and then when
[1:18:37] our experience is equal to the word then
[1:18:41] God says
[1:18:43] amen God blesses it amen praise God so
[1:18:48] let's go to the
[1:18:49] next aspect of this service
[1:18:52] okay praise God let me bring up my
[1:18:57] now let me take a quick
[1:19:06] drink and let's read our
[1:19:09] scripture for the Lord
[1:19:17] himself
[1:19:21] sorry for the Lord himself shall descend
[1:19:23] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[1:19:26] of the Archangel and with the Trump of
[1:19:29] God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:19:32] first then we which are alive and remain
[1:19:35] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:19:38] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[1:19:41] and so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:19:45] wherefore Comfort one another with these
[1:19:49] words now as we move into this aspect of
[1:19:53] the service we've just looked at rolling
[1:19:55] away stones in our own lives amen but
[1:19:59] let me tell you God has given us a word
[1:20:03] for this day and for this hour that also
[1:20:05] gives us the ability as Sons and
[1:20:09] Daughters of God as Christians to roll
[1:20:12] Stones away in other people's
[1:20:15] lives here's now where we're going to
[1:20:17] come into this into the part of
[1:20:19] recognizing our part in The Plan of
[1:20:23] Redemption remember this this is a call
[1:20:25] to the body of Christ brother brandham
[1:20:27] now I'm going to just laying in a
[1:20:28] foundation here the first thing comes
[1:20:30] when he starts now listen to brother
[1:20:32] brandham this is the rapture message the
[1:20:34] first thing comes when he starts
[1:20:37] descending from Heaven there's a shout
[1:20:41] from the scripture that we just read now
[1:20:42] we read this also on the on part two
[1:20:45] we're just going to move along now and
[1:20:47] we're going to take it into the end this
[1:20:49] will be the end of this
[1:20:50] series and he says here a message comes
[1:20:53] forth first now lamp trimming time rise
[1:20:57] and trim your lamps watch what was it
[1:21:01] the seventh not the sixth the seventh
[1:21:03] behold the bridegroom cometh rise and
[1:21:07] trim your lamps and they did some of
[1:21:11] them found they didn't even have any oil
[1:21:13] in their lamps see but it's lamp
[1:21:16] trimming time so there's a shout there's
[1:21:19] a message that went forth that we've
[1:21:22] received in the 20th century God sent us
[1:21:25] a continuation of the Reformation I've
[1:21:27] mentioned it many times over and for
[1:21:29] those that are listening in you need to
[1:21:31] go back and study the reformation and
[1:21:34] you need to go back and study the life
[1:21:36] of William Branham and his part in the
[1:21:40] reformation and how he was actually a
[1:21:42] prophet to the 20th century to the
[1:21:45] Gentile churches that were here on the
[1:21:48] earth so that so that all this disorder
[1:21:52] all this religion all this
[1:21:54] interpretation of man could be could be
[1:21:57] fixed and bring us back to the word
[1:22:01] that's why everything that we talk about
[1:22:04] is search the scriptures go back to the
[1:22:06] word see if your experience is lining up
[1:22:09] with the word so the first was the
[1:22:12] message coming forth the second is a
[1:22:15] voice of the Resurrection the same voice
[1:22:18] that loud voice in St John 11 verse
[1:22:22] 38-44 that called Lazarus from the grave
[1:22:26] getting the bride together and then the
[1:22:29] resurrection of the Dead see that to be
[1:22:32] caught up with it now watch three things
[1:22:36] take place so here now that's why we've
[1:22:38] been ministering on this on St John 11
[1:22:41] is because we're actually in a walk to
[1:22:44] the
[1:22:45] resurrection we've already been
[1:22:48] resurrected but yet we're still walking
[1:22:50] to the resurrection because not only was
[1:22:53] was Jesus is going to call Lazarus which
[1:22:56] was the a type of the sleeping Saints
[1:22:58] those that died before us that believe
[1:23:01] the word those Christians that died for
[1:23:03] this word they called them Heretics the
[1:23:06] Dark Ages they burned them to the stake
[1:23:08] they did everything to get rid of the
[1:23:10] spirit of God that was in those people
[1:23:12] but those were actually Sons and
[1:23:13] Daughters of God go back and read the
[1:23:16] exposition of the seven Church ages go
[1:23:19] back and read that and read on how all
[1:23:22] the messengers that that God had sent
[1:23:24] there was a messenger to each of those
[1:23:26] seven churches William brandham was the
[1:23:29] messenger to the seventh Church age okay
[1:23:32] but you'll look back you'll see Martin
[1:23:33] Luther Wesley you'll see Columba you'll
[1:23:36] see St Martin Paul he was the first
[1:23:39] messenger in the book of Ephesus in to
[1:23:41] the Ephesian church this is all church
[1:23:43] history it's all available to anybody to
[1:23:46] go back and research and search the
[1:23:48] scriptures to see if what we're saying
[1:23:50] is truth or not amen but here we're
[1:23:53] talking about H H walk into a
[1:23:55] resurrection and Martha she had received
[1:23:58] the instruction to roll away the stone
[1:24:00] and this is telling us that we've got a
[1:24:02] part to play in this whole Plan of
[1:24:04] Redemption amen and so uh that's why we
[1:24:09] we are on a walk we're a type of Martha
[1:24:11] we're a type of Mary we're walking
[1:24:13] together some are really into the law
[1:24:15] some are really into Grace but we're
[1:24:17] still walking towards the resurrection
[1:24:20] amen and we're looking to to to find
[1:24:22] that last one because Jesus said all
[1:24:24] that the father hath given me will come
[1:24:27] not one of them will be left behind and
[1:24:29] we have a part to play in that we're
[1:24:31] we're we're there testifying of what God
[1:24:34] is doing in this hour amen and so here
[1:24:37] now he says he says the next is what was
[1:24:41] a trumpet a voice a shout a voice a
[1:24:45] trumpet now the third thing is a trumpet
[1:24:48] which always is a feast of trumpets is
[1:24:51] the calling the people to the feast and
[1:24:54] that'll be the bride's supper he goes on
[1:24:58] to say that's the calling of the
[1:25:00] churches second Thessalonians is talking
[1:25:03] about calling those that are alive and
[1:25:05] remain shall not hinder them that that
[1:25:08] that that sleep and and we have to meet
[1:25:10] up with those that are alive and remain
[1:25:13] we need to reach them with the message
[1:25:15] of this hour they need to know that God
[1:25:17] is doing something in this hour and will
[1:25:20] call them into the body for the Rapture
[1:25:23] because this world is is going into
[1:25:24] tribulation don't tell me it's not it's
[1:25:27] all around us more than ever it's
[1:25:30] screaming around us sir it's never
[1:25:33] screamed like it's screaming right now I
[1:25:36] was telling my wife I said my God you
[1:25:37] know 10 years ago we were thinking about
[1:25:39] you know the tribulation and and wars
[1:25:42] and and Israel and and and what we saw
[1:25:45] scripturally because everything that's
[1:25:46] going on in Israel is in the scripture
[1:25:49] everything it's scripturally prophesied
[1:25:51] from before the foundations of the world
[1:25:54] amen and it's all there and it's all
[1:25:56] playing out right before us and here we
[1:25:58] are now witnessing it we're seeing it as
[1:26:01] clear as clear can be but there's a call
[1:26:04] to the bride there's a call to the
[1:26:06] church when I say bride I'm talking
[1:26:09] about the church the real Church the
[1:26:11] body of Jesus Christ not church
[1:26:14] denominations let's go
[1:26:16] on and then and then he says so he says
[1:26:19] that'll be the bride supper the the
[1:26:21] Lamb's supper with the bride in the sky
[1:26:25] see he's talking about that meeting in
[1:26:27] the air the first thing comes forth is
[1:26:30] his message calling the bride together
[1:26:33] the next thing is the resurrection of
[1:26:35] the sleeping Saints those that are that
[1:26:38] that are asleep now there's some that
[1:26:39] are asleep that have died but yet
[1:26:41] there's some that are still asleep that
[1:26:43] need to be awoken right here in this
[1:26:45] generation that are stuck in
[1:26:47] denomination stuck in Tradition they've
[1:26:50] got all kinds of stones rolled over
[1:26:52] their lives and they can't see the truth
[1:26:55] and God is telling you roll away that
[1:26:57] stone some of the people that we got to
[1:26:59] deal with you know that you know like
[1:27:01] maybe their lives are are a mess but
[1:27:04] don't worry like you know like Martha
[1:27:05] said but you know there's a stink don't
[1:27:08] worry about the stink let them come in
[1:27:10] God will clean them up you ever get a
[1:27:12] fish and pull it out of the sea and
[1:27:14] start cleaning it it
[1:27:15] stinks that's the way it is until it's
[1:27:18] clean and then it's cooked and then it's
[1:27:21] delicious Hallelujah and that's how God
[1:27:23] works with his people amen he's dealing
[1:27:26] with lives situations and there's a lot
[1:27:29] of fish that still need to be clean
[1:27:31] there's trout out there amen and we've
[1:27:33] got our part to call and to do and to
[1:27:36] live before them so that they can
[1:27:38] recognize what God is doing in this hour
[1:27:40] and that's that's the thing that's
[1:27:42] taking place friends he says we're right
[1:27:44] there ready now the only thing the
[1:27:47] church coming out has got to lay before
[1:27:50] the sun to
[1:27:53] ripen amen praise God let's go to the
[1:27:56] next
[1:27:57] slide but if the spirit of him that
[1:28:01] raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in
[1:28:04] you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:28:07] dead shall also
[1:28:08] Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[1:28:12] that dwelleth in you so what is it that
[1:28:16] we've got that they
[1:28:18] need those that need to come in the Holy
[1:28:22] Ghost the quickening spirit
[1:28:24] the spirit of God but here I'm going to
[1:28:27] go on here I'm going to read listen
[1:28:29] brother Bram speaking here in uh the
[1:28:33] rising of the sun he says now notice it
[1:28:36] was the first corn of God's wheat that
[1:28:39] had been raised from the dead he's
[1:28:40] talking about Christ God's first corn of
[1:28:43] Wheat by God's quickening power God had
[1:28:46] quickened his life raised him up from
[1:28:49] the dead and he was the first fruits of
[1:28:51] those that slept the first fruit he was
[1:28:54] that Chief that's why they had to wave
[1:28:57] that sheath for he was the first one
[1:29:01] that come to maturity when we're talking
[1:29:03] about the word that's why when we talk
[1:29:06] about Christ there is no other way that
[1:29:09] man must be saved but by Jesus Christ
[1:29:13] The Life of Christ Jesus said I am the
[1:29:18] resurrection so he can raise them up and
[1:29:21] I am the life the eternal life that that
[1:29:24] that gives them and and shows that
[1:29:27] eternal life is in them amen praise God
[1:29:31] so it was waved as a memorial of
[1:29:34] Thanksgiving to God believing that the
[1:29:36] rest of them would come it was a sign
[1:29:39] and today because he was the first Son
[1:29:42] of God to come to full maturity to be in
[1:29:44] God he was plucked up from the earth and
[1:29:48] is waved over the people he's talking
[1:29:50] about the
[1:29:52] crucifixion talking about how Christ had
[1:29:54] to die that's why it's all about it's
[1:29:57] all about the
[1:29:59] resurrection everything changed because
[1:30:01] of the Resurrection amen praise God oh
[1:30:05] glory to God he says oh what a glorious
[1:30:08] Lesson by the quickening power the first
[1:30:11] one although he had he had been typed
[1:30:14] and many times he was shown throughout
[1:30:16] the back listen if you go back and read
[1:30:17] the Old Testament you see
[1:30:20] Christ from from Genesis to revelation
[1:30:24] if you don't if you don't see him in
[1:30:26] every verse in every uh chapter you're
[1:30:29] missing something because it's all about
[1:30:31] him the whole book is all about him amen
[1:30:34] what a glorious Thing by the quickening
[1:30:36] power he had been typed and many times
[1:30:38] as well see later that he was typed but
[1:30:41] this was really the first fruits of them
[1:30:44] that slept he was waved over the
[1:30:46] promised seed that had promise of life
[1:30:49] he was waved at the day of Pentecost
[1:30:52] when there came a sound from heaven like
[1:30:54] a waving Mighty rushing wind and was
[1:30:57] waved over the people the Pentecostal
[1:30:59] people that was up at Pentecost waiting
[1:31:02] for the blessing to come and to be waved
[1:31:06] again we realize in the last day
[1:31:10] according to Luke
[1:31:12] 17:30 in the son of man in the sun day
[1:31:16] again in the day that the son of man
[1:31:18] will be revealed or waved again over the
[1:31:22] people this is brother brandom and
[1:31:24] 1965 in the message it is the rising of
[1:31:28] the sun it was an Easter message he was
[1:31:32] talking about the resurrection of Jesus
[1:31:34] Christ and how the word was now on
[1:31:37] display again and now it was being waved
[1:31:41] before the people again in the life and
[1:31:44] Ministry of William Mariam Branham not
[1:31:47] that he was God no sir it's listen the
[1:31:53] word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:31:57] Jesus Christ listen you have to you
[1:32:00] you've got to you've got to put it all
[1:32:01] into perspective the father is the
[1:32:04] Elohim the self-existent one the Lord
[1:32:07] the Almighty the the the the the logos
[1:32:12] amen and he expressed from his thought
[1:32:16] he expressed and put into expression a
[1:32:20] son and called his name Jesus
[1:32:24] every thought that was in the
[1:32:26] logos went into
[1:32:29] Jesus and whatever was in Christ he
[1:32:33] pours now into the church through the
[1:32:35] Holy
[1:32:36] Ghost so understanding now that when you
[1:32:40] look at the word you you know we look at
[1:32:44] the word and you take for example go ye
[1:32:47] into all the world baptizing them in the
[1:32:49] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:32:51] the Holy
[1:32:52] Spirit and and Jesus spoke those words
[1:32:56] and he knew exactly what he was saying
[1:32:58] because he was the word in the beginning
[1:33:01] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:33:03] and the Word was God and so the logos
[1:33:06] the thought that he had in the back of
[1:33:08] his mind was was placed into him and
[1:33:13] what he was speaking now was the word
[1:33:16] and when he said baptize in the name of
[1:33:18] the father and the son and of the Holy
[1:33:20] Ghost and somebody goes and baptize
[1:33:23] somebody into those titles that's not
[1:33:26] the word what he meant by that was the
[1:33:29] name of the Father the Son and the Holy
[1:33:31] Ghost and we know that that's the Lord
[1:33:34] Jesus Christ father son Holy Ghost same
[1:33:38] person not three in one you see and
[1:33:42] that's why the word that was being waved
[1:33:45] now before the people in the ministry of
[1:33:47] William Branham to restore the hearts of
[1:33:51] the children Malachi 4:5 back to the Fai
[1:33:53] of the
[1:33:54] fathers that was to restore us back to
[1:33:57] the word amen so that our expression our
[1:34:01] experience our walk as Christians is
[1:34:05] according to the word not according to
[1:34:08] doctrines of man that's why when we say
[1:34:10] to somebody there was nobody ever
[1:34:12] baptized as a child and every single
[1:34:16] baptism was done in the name of the Lord
[1:34:18] Jesus Christ we're only repeating the
[1:34:21] word because on the day of Pentecost in
[1:34:23] the book of Acts 238 when Peter who was
[1:34:26] present there with Jesus when he says go
[1:34:28] ye into all the world baptizing them in
[1:34:30] the name of the F Peter caught the
[1:34:32] Revelation that the name of the father
[1:34:34] and the son and the was Jesus Christ
[1:34:37] that was the the the the body that God
[1:34:40] created in order to be on earth so that
[1:34:42] it could go to the crucifixion so that a
[1:34:46] resurrection could take place and the
[1:34:48] and the reason we're here today is
[1:34:50] because of the Resurrection amen it's
[1:34:52] all about the resurrection
[1:34:54] everything's about the resurrection and
[1:34:56] God is resurrecting Sons and Daughters
[1:34:58] of God bringing them into their maturity
[1:35:02] placing them under the the the the the
[1:35:04] leadership of the word and teaching them
[1:35:08] according to the word and now your
[1:35:11] experience is based on the word not on
[1:35:14] doctrines of men so when somebody comes
[1:35:16] to you and says it doesn't matter how
[1:35:18] you're
[1:35:20] baptized they're they're they're denying
[1:35:22] the word
[1:35:24] like they don't understand that they
[1:35:27] they think it's okay because remember
[1:35:29] cognitive dissonance right they believe
[1:35:31] something it's a core belief they're
[1:35:33] going to hold to that thing no matter
[1:35:35] what they're going to want to stay with
[1:35:36] that thing even if it means their own
[1:35:39] salvation but let me tell you if there's
[1:35:41] an attribute of God because Jesus said
[1:35:44] all that the father hath given me will
[1:35:46] will will come not one of them will be
[1:35:50] lost I don't care who they are that's
[1:35:53] why you don't need to get into arguments
[1:35:55] with people you don't need to try to
[1:35:56] convince anybody when you are a part
[1:35:59] listen if when Jesus went to the Cross
[1:36:02] you went to the Cross amen because you
[1:36:04] were in him from before the foundations
[1:36:07] of the world you needed to be expressed
[1:36:09] let's move on here let's look at the
[1:36:12] next um scripture
[1:36:22] here
[1:36:25] okay St John 11:43 let's read this
[1:36:28] because it's there and when he thus had
[1:36:31] spoken he cried with a loud voice
[1:36:33] Lazarus come forth and he that was dead
[1:36:37] came forth bound hand and foot with
[1:36:39] grave clothes and his face was bound
[1:36:41] about with napkin Jesus said unto them
[1:36:44] loose him and let him go then many of
[1:36:47] the Jews which came to Mary and had seen
[1:36:50] the things which Jesus did believed on
[1:36:53] him
[1:36:54] amen praise God now watch he
[1:36:59] says I'm going to read a quote
[1:37:08] here okay here it is it is the rising of
[1:37:11] the Sun as Christ was the first one to
[1:37:14] raise from all the prophets and so forth
[1:37:17] although typed in many places he was the
[1:37:19] first fruits of those that slept in the
[1:37:23] the bride coming of Christ coming out of
[1:37:26] the church there will have to be a
[1:37:28] sheath waved again in the last days Oh
[1:37:32] my he says waving of the sheath what was
[1:37:36] the sheath the first one that come to
[1:37:38] mature the first one that proved it was
[1:37:41] a wheat that proved it was a sheath if
[1:37:45] you are a seed and you are a weed wheat
[1:37:49] wheat not a weed you don't want to be a
[1:37:52] weed
[1:37:54] a wheat then you are going to bring
[1:37:57] forth the Life of Christ you can't bring
[1:38:00] anything else forth because you're a
[1:38:03] wheat you were a wheat from before the
[1:38:06] foundations of the world you are an
[1:38:09] attribute of God you are a seed of God
[1:38:12] and when the word gets called in its
[1:38:15] time and in its season there's no way
[1:38:18] that you can miss the word amen praise
[1:38:21] God he says here Hallelujah I'm sure you
[1:38:25] see what I'm talking about it was waved
[1:38:28] over the people and the first time there
[1:38:30] will come forth for the bright age for a
[1:38:33] resurrection out of dark
[1:38:36] denominal
[1:38:37] denominal ationalism
[1:38:40] will be a message that the full maturity
[1:38:44] of the word has turned back again in its
[1:38:47] full power and being waved over the
[1:38:50] People by the same signs and wonders
[1:38:53] that he he did back there look what he's
[1:38:55] talking he's talking about denom
[1:38:57] denominal denominational systems you
[1:39:01] know they tried to bury Christ in that
[1:39:04] grave they put the you know it was the
[1:39:06] Roman Stone that that they that they
[1:39:08] used to roll over that that uh that
[1:39:11] grave there and and it was it was uh uh
[1:39:15] trying to block every possibility of of
[1:39:19] allowing that life to to to be raised
[1:39:21] you know because they were afraid
[1:39:24] by by by chance that this Supernatural
[1:39:27] that was taking place in his life that
[1:39:28] was proving himself over and over he had
[1:39:30] raised the dead he he's the one that
[1:39:32] called Lazarus from the dead they they
[1:39:34] didn't like what took place you know
[1:39:36] that the the calling of Lazarus from the
[1:39:38] dead was the very last Supernatural
[1:39:41] event that took place before he went to
[1:39:43] Jerusalem to go to Calvary that was that
[1:39:46] was the last Supernatural event that of
[1:39:49] the raising and that's just a type of
[1:39:51] those that which are alive and remain
[1:39:52] they're going to be called out of the
[1:39:54] graves amen they're going to be called
[1:39:56] out of those denominational Graves
[1:39:59] praise God you're going to need to tell
[1:40:01] your friends and your and your family
[1:40:03] about you know about God calling out a
[1:40:06] people that are going to hearken to the
[1:40:08] word of God they're not going to be
[1:40:10] caught by their own traditions of man
[1:40:12] they're not going to allow the word of
[1:40:14] God to control them they're going to
[1:40:16] realize that they can actually walk in
[1:40:18] the light of God's word for this day and
[1:40:21] for this hour listen to brother brandom
[1:40:24] here he says
[1:40:33] here sorry it's right
[1:40:38] here praise
[1:40:44] God just be patient with
[1:40:48] me I'm still getting used to all this
[1:40:50] equipment up here and trying to use it
[1:40:52] in the right way
[1:40:55] praise
[1:41:06] God so there are denominational stones
[1:41:09] that are going to be rolled
[1:41:11] away he says because I live also
[1:41:15] speaking to his wife because I live ye
[1:41:18] shall live what a resurrection that was
[1:41:21] and what a resurrection this this is to
[1:41:24] be quickened from the dead to be made
[1:41:27] alive in Christ Jesus by God's
[1:41:29] quickening power he was waved to them
[1:41:32] the word which he was was waved back to
[1:41:35] them on the day of Pentecost the word
[1:41:37] made manifest now and as I say it's to
[1:41:41] be waved again in the last day now for
[1:41:45] instance amen and so he goes on here and
[1:41:48] he says uh and
[1:41:52] when
[1:41:54] in the in the message in 1962 the
[1:41:56] restoration of the brid tree now to rid
[1:41:59] him out of their sight they hated him so
[1:42:01] bad because he tore up all their
[1:42:05] organizations and this message when it
[1:42:08] is testified when you're out there and
[1:42:11] you're testifying of God's move in your
[1:42:13] life and how God has resurrected you and
[1:42:16] and drawn you out of denominational
[1:42:19] doctrines of man and has brought you
[1:42:21] back to the word of God it brings a
[1:42:24] reproach they get upset they can't help
[1:42:26] it because it's it's going against
[1:42:28] everything that they believe but he tore
[1:42:30] up their organizations to rid him out of
[1:42:33] their sight they buried him and rolled a
[1:42:35] great big denominational Stone over the
[1:42:38] door so he'd be sure not to rise
[1:42:43] again
[1:42:47] now then what did they do they took that
[1:42:51] precious tree cut it down hanged it on a
[1:42:54] man-made tree that's right cut the life
[1:42:57] out of it and hanged upon a man-made
[1:43:00] tree for a mockery that's what they did
[1:43:03] at Calvary then they didn't like it too
[1:43:05] many people standing there crying about
[1:43:08] it so they took him off they said we'll
[1:43:10] make our denomination so tight that
[1:43:13] they'll never get them holy rollers in
[1:43:16] here oh boy so they scooted him back
[1:43:19] into the hole of Joseph of uh armea and
[1:43:23] they rolled a great big Stone took a
[1:43:25] century of men to roll it up there did
[1:43:28] you ever see see the other night in the
[1:43:30] picture the big path they rolled the
[1:43:33] stone up on weighs tons rolled their big
[1:43:37] organizational Stone up there so he
[1:43:40] could not raise up but did that hold
[1:43:43] him no but I will restore sayth the Lord
[1:43:47] let's hit that text now and drive it I
[1:43:50] will restore sayeth the Lord I'll
[1:43:53] restore him in three days I'll raise him
[1:43:55] back up again they couldn't hide him in
[1:43:57] that rock they couldn't hide him out out
[1:44:00] of their sight they couldn't get him off
[1:44:02] the off their hands I will restore him
[1:44:05] sayeth the Lord and in three days he
[1:44:07] rose up and was restored again praise
[1:44:11] God
[1:44:13] hallelujah and he's risen up in your
[1:44:15] life through justification through
[1:44:18] sanctification through the baptism of
[1:44:20] the Holy Ghost all three stages have
[1:44:23] taken place in your walk as a son or a
[1:44:26] daughter of God go to the next
[1:44:29] slide it says here in Acts 18 but ye
[1:44:32] shall receive Power Glory to God God
[1:44:35] promised that you would receive power
[1:44:38] that you would receive the baptism of
[1:44:40] the Holy Ghost to give you the strength
[1:44:42] the confidence and the courage to stand
[1:44:45] on this word amen after that the Holy
[1:44:47] Ghost has come upon you and you shall be
[1:44:50] Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[1:44:53] in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the
[1:44:57] uttermost parts of the earth amen praise
[1:45:00] God forever more glory to God you are
[1:45:04] now walking in the light of God's word
[1:45:08] you are now filled with the spirit of
[1:45:10] God Jesus said in St John 1:7 but if you
[1:45:15] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:45:18] we have Fellowship one with
[1:45:20] another how can somebody that's walking
[1:45:23] in darkness have have fellowship with
[1:45:25] somebody that's walking in the light it
[1:45:27] can't
[1:45:28] happen there's no Fellowship when when
[1:45:32] when your foundation is based on man's
[1:45:34] teaching and man's Doctrine there's no
[1:45:37] Fellowship because Jesus is the light
[1:45:39] listen what he says here he says but if
[1:45:42] you walk in the light we have Fellowship
[1:45:44] one with another and the blood of Jesus
[1:45:47] Christ his son cleanses us from all sin
[1:45:51] and that's the thing that people need to
[1:45:52] understand understand that when they
[1:45:54] come to the light it purges them it
[1:45:57] justifies them it cleanses them it gives
[1:46:01] the opportunity for the Holy Spirit to
[1:46:03] now move in their lives wash away that
[1:46:05] denominational thinking wash away all
[1:46:07] that tradition out of their lives in s
[1:46:10] in St John 8:12 Jesus spake again and he
[1:46:13] said unto them I am the light of the
[1:46:17] world Amen he that followeth me shall
[1:46:21] not walk in darkness but has shall have
[1:46:23] have the light of life there's no life
[1:46:27] outside of Jesus Christ and his word
[1:46:30] amen that's why when when when
[1:46:32] somebody's willing to take a doctrine of
[1:46:35] of of a church a teaching of a church a
[1:46:39] following of a church an interpretation
[1:46:41] of God's word based on man's
[1:46:45] writings there's no way that the light
[1:46:48] can be
[1:46:50] there this is a call out of Darkness
[1:46:53] and into light God is calling the people
[1:46:57] out of Darkness it says walk in the
[1:46:59] light a lot of people just want to come
[1:47:02] to church they just want to sit in
[1:47:03] church they want to leave and they want
[1:47:04] to forget about
[1:47:06] everything it didn't say sit in the
[1:47:08] light it said walk in the light you got
[1:47:12] to walk with God you got to you got to
[1:47:14] put action behind your testimony you got
[1:47:17] to let the Holy Spirit work in your life
[1:47:19] let him move supernaturally by you
[1:47:21] stepping out on
[1:47:23] faith it takes Faith to step out on
[1:47:26] God's word and to walk out of the
[1:47:28] darkness you ever try to walk in the
[1:47:30] dark it's not
[1:47:32] easy sometimes the liks go out and you
[1:47:34] got to walk and now you've got to rely
[1:47:37] on on on your on your your faith you got
[1:47:40] to rely on what you
[1:47:41] know and God he doesn't he doesn't allow
[1:47:44] you to sit in

[1:47:49] if you're a son or a daughter of God he
[1:47:52] comes into your life in order to Quicken
[1:47:54] your your mind so that you put on the
[1:47:56] mind of Christ and now you see through
[1:47:58] the darkness you see through all the the
[1:48:01] lies all the the teachings of man
[1:48:10] amen listen to brother brandom he says
[1:48:13] here in the in uh Christ is the is
[1:48:15] revealed in his own word God is revealed
[1:48:19] in every age by his promised word to
[1:48:23] that
[1:48:24] age I'm gonna repeat that that's a
[1:48:27] profound
[1:48:28] statement God is revealed in every
[1:48:33] age by his promised word to that age do
[1:48:37] you know that God has a promised word to
[1:48:39] this
[1:48:41] age right now there's a word that that
[1:48:44] that that's coming to us that's
[1:48:46] perfecting us for the
[1:48:49] Rapture it's the word that's going to
[1:48:51] give us our
[1:48:54] Resurrection our translation we've
[1:48:57] already been
[1:48:58] resurrected we've already been snatched
[1:49:01] out of the world you know how it says
[1:49:02] you know he'll take one he'll leave one
[1:49:05] that's already happening and those of
[1:49:07] you that have already experienced that
[1:49:09] you know that God took you out and you
[1:49:11] know 30 years ago God pulled myself and
[1:49:14] my wife out of the life that that that
[1:49:16] we were living all the friends and the
[1:49:19] families we still have relationships
[1:49:21] with them but but they don't
[1:49:24] see this that we're seeing
[1:49:27] fully but that's not that's not our
[1:49:32] business our business is to live this
[1:49:35] life and allow the Holy Spirit to
[1:49:37] display itself and if God wants to
[1:49:39] reveal because it's not you that found
[1:49:41] God it's God that found you it's God
[1:49:43] that called you it's God that that he
[1:49:46] says they'll my sheep hear my voice this
[1:49:49] is not about getting as many people to
[1:49:51] join the church as possible possible we
[1:49:54] bring them into the church they come
[1:49:55] under the the the the atmosphere of the
[1:49:58] of the word of God the spirit of God
[1:50:00] starts to speak and and starts to reveal
[1:50:02] things through the word of God and if
[1:50:04] there is a seed in there remember the
[1:50:07] seeds have to come to maturity so if
[1:50:09] there's a seed in there and it sits
[1:50:11] under the under that light long enough
[1:50:14] it needs light you can never grow a seed
[1:50:16] in the
[1:50:17] dark they stay in the dark they'll never
[1:50:19] grow they reject and they no you tell
[1:50:22] them search the scriptures look to see
[1:50:24] what it says about baptism look to see
[1:50:26] what the scripture says about receiving
[1:50:29] the Holy Ghost and and how Jesus said
[1:50:31] I'll give you the comforter which is the
[1:50:33] Holy Ghost and it will guide you into
[1:50:36] all truth look into that Search the word
[1:50:39] and see if that's not going to change
[1:50:41] your walk or your experience to where
[1:50:42] you are now going to look to the word
[1:50:45] you're now going to search the
[1:50:46] scriptures to see if your salvation
[1:50:48] based on the way you've interpreted it
[1:50:51] is going to work out for you
[1:50:53] because it's not too late if you're an
[1:50:56] attribute of God you can't miss this
[1:50:58] you're going to have to come you're
[1:51:00] going to have to surrender you're going
[1:51:02] to have to give into this because the
[1:51:04] spirit of God says I will not leave you
[1:51:07] comfortless I'll be with you even in you
[1:51:10] he says I'm coming after you Hallelujah
[1:51:14] I don't care who you are you're out
[1:51:16] there listening in here today and you
[1:51:18] may have heard something through the
[1:51:19] word of God I challenge you to search
[1:51:22] the scripture
[1:51:23] go back to the word of God study the
[1:51:25] seven Church ages go back and read the
[1:51:28] the revelation of the Seven Seals go
[1:51:30] back and and study the word of God
[1:51:32] prayerfully and see if God doesn't
[1:51:35] reveal to you and place you into the
[1:51:37] light of this hour amen glory to God
[1:51:40] there's a promised word for this age
[1:51:43] glory to God and I'm glad that God has
[1:51:45] awoken me to this promised word in this
[1:51:48] hour because it's what called me out
[1:51:51] it's what gives me confidence to stand
[1:51:53] here and to minister this word and to
[1:51:55] testify and let the people know that
[1:51:57] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:52:00] and forever and if you're going to walk
[1:52:02] in the light of God's word then your
[1:52:04] life must produce the
[1:52:07] word it's as simple as that it's the
[1:52:11] word that is being produced in this hour
[1:52:13] it's the word that that that is going to
[1:52:16] be displayed to the people and the word
[1:52:19] for this age is going to produce a
[1:52:21] church that is going to separate
[1:52:24] themselves completely from
[1:52:25] denominational man-made teachings man's
[1:52:29] control listen the World Council of
[1:52:31] churches is going to try to close up any
[1:52:34] churches that are that are like heretic
[1:52:36] type churches you know they might even
[1:52:38] classify us that way but that doesn't
[1:52:41] matter because we're not worried we've
[1:52:44] got somebody standing with us amen amen
[1:52:47] we've got the word of God that stands
[1:52:49] with his own word he's not going to he's
[1:52:51] not going to uh uh judge the world based
[1:52:54] on their
[1:52:55] interpretation oh there's a hundred ways
[1:52:58] to get to God and so God is now the
[1:53:00] author of confusion no and will allow
[1:53:03] you to go through Mary here and allow
[1:53:05] you to go through Buddha there and allow
[1:53:06] you to go through Muhammad over here and
[1:53:09] what what kind of confusion is that God
[1:53:11] is going to judge this world One Way by
[1:53:15] his word amen he is going to make his
[1:53:18] word so plain and so simple and he's
[1:53:20] going to use you and me to be the simple
[1:53:23] uh conduits that are going to bring
[1:53:26] forth this word in this day and in this
[1:53:28] hour we're not bringing forth a
[1:53:30] complicated word this is a simple word
[1:53:33] brother Gabriel Hallelujah it had to be
[1:53:36] real simple to get a hold of a couple
[1:53:38] Italians like this let me tell you okay
[1:53:41] that we're brought up under the
[1:53:42] traditions of man and all kinds of
[1:53:44] tradition but once that word comes you
[1:53:47] know once that word Shines on a seed
[1:53:50] that seed has to respond amen that seed
[1:53:53] has to come to life that seed has to go
[1:53:57] and say wait a minute here we I need the
[1:54:00] Holy Ghost I remember when that struck
[1:54:02] me so hard I said I went to Pastor Simon
[1:54:04] I said I need the Holy Ghost I realized
[1:54:07] that that was that that was the spirit
[1:54:08] that could overcome the drug addiction
[1:54:10] in my life I said oh that's that that's
[1:54:14] the power that delivered the woman at

[1:54:59] before the
[1:55:01] people you go back and study the Seven
[1:55:05] Seals and you will see
[1:55:08] that when brother brandham came to the
[1:55:11] seventh seal there was silence in
[1:55:15] heaven when he read from the book of
[1:55:17] Revelation when they opened that seventh
[1:55:20] seal it's because Christ himself self
[1:55:23] had left to come down into the Earth
[1:55:28] they're looking for the second coming of
[1:55:30] Jesus Christ I say to you he's already
[1:55:34] come and he's already here and he is
[1:55:38] calling a people he is filling a
[1:55:41] five-fold Ministry with his Spirit he's
[1:55:43] anointed pastors teachers evangelists
[1:55:46] Apostles and Prophets to minister the
[1:55:49] word of God in order to bring a bride a
[1:55:52] Church remember he's calling a church
[1:55:54] out of the
[1:55:55] church he's not dealing with people as
[1:55:59] as many he's dealing with you individual
[1:56:03] he's calling individuals this is a walk
[1:56:06] of you and Jesus Christ amen praise God
[1:56:10] this is not a a a body a a a single man
[1:56:13] movement this is a body movement that's
[1:56:16] led by the headship of the Holy Spirit
[1:56:18] which is Christ and in 1963 when that's
[1:56:22] Supernatural Cloud appeared over sunset
[1:56:25] Mountain that was Christ himself coming
[1:56:28] down supernaturally to meet with the
[1:56:30] body of Jesus Christ the church to call
[1:56:34] them out to give and to become the
[1:56:35] leadership a lot of people will look at
[1:56:37] that cloud but because the spirit of the
[1:56:40] Loos is not in them because remember you
[1:56:44] need the Loos in you which is the
[1:56:46] thought of God the thought of God will
[1:56:48] only recognize the word those that can
[1:56:51] that do not have logo ghost that do not
[1:56:53] have the spirit of God will look at that
[1:56:55] cloud and say just another Cloud just a
[1:56:58] cloud that appeared could have been done

[1:57:03] have the
[1:57:04] logos that have the word in you that is
[1:57:08] the holy spirit will look at that cloud
[1:57:11] and when you turn it to the right you'll
[1:57:13] see exactly what it is it's the head of
