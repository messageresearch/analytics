[27:35] because um
[27:37] we rely on the lord's strength in our

[27:41] you rely on his strength
[27:44] you know you might be strong you're
[27:45] young you still got the you know the
[27:48] muscles and stuff like that but as you
[27:50] as you get you know on in your life and
[27:53] you know you start getting close to rh
[27:55] you know where you break 50
[27:58] and then um

[28:02] start to really rely on god's strength
[28:04] in your life because you start to
[28:05] realize that hey i'm not i don't have
[28:07] the energy like i had you know i just
[28:10] you know the the the pressures of life
[28:12] don't stop but yet
[28:14] you know we got uh the grace of god in
[28:17] our lives that we can keep pressing on
[28:19] and and once you rely on his strength it
[28:21] brings joy
[28:23] it brings joy into your life it's just
[28:25] automatic okay and the scripture even
[28:27] says it
[28:28] right
[28:29] his strength
[28:31] brings us joy hallelujah glory to god
[28:34] so praise god tonight we're going to
[28:35] continue
[28:37] uh with what we started last wednesday
[28:39] night
[28:40] um
[28:41] we were talking about uh you put up the
[28:43] first slide
[28:44] we were talking about that this is your
[28:47] time
[28:48] to recognize your day
[28:51] and you know uh there's so much
[28:53] in there for us
[28:56] um you know because sometimes what ends
[28:57] up happening especially in the ranks of
[28:59] this message
[29:01] a lot of people think that oh recognize
[29:02] your day and it's message and all
[29:04] they're thinking about is alleluia
[29:06] praise god i recognize that god sent the
[29:08] prophet and you know the seals would
[29:10] have been open and
[29:12] you know
[29:12] the church ages and the history and you
[29:15] could get to know everything about the
[29:18] message of the hour not realizing that
[29:20] you are the message of the hour
[29:23] and that your part
[29:25] and your time and that your season has
[29:27] to be recognized
[29:29] amen that's what brings perfect faith
[29:31] so that we can experience the rapture
[29:33] age and so the first
[29:35] scripture talks about
[29:38] that we read and i'll just i'll read it
[29:40] really quickly here because it'll recap
[29:42] and then lead us into the next stage of
[29:45] this message
[29:46] but it says here in second peter 1 15 to
[29:49] 9
[29:50] that moreover i will endeavor that you
[29:53] may be able after my decrease to have
[29:56] these things always
[29:57] in remembrance see peter recognized that
[30:00] there was something that he experienced
[30:03] in his time and season and that that
[30:05] that we had to come into ours and so he
[30:07] says for we have not followed cunningly
[30:10] devised fables when we made known unto
[30:13] you the power and the coming of our lord
[30:15] jesus christ but we're eyewitnesses of
[30:18] his majesty and you now
[30:21] you know at this stage in your walk with
[30:23] god you got to be recognizing that
[30:25] you're an eyewitness that you're seeing
[30:27] the supernatural you're not just you're
[30:29] not you're not just hearing everything
[30:31] you're actually experiencing it amen and
[30:34] so that's what you know he was he was an
[30:37] eyewitness for he received from god the
[30:40] father honor and glory when there came
[30:42] such a voice to him from the excellent
[30:45] glory see he was there he heard he saw
[30:48] he saw that god said this is my beloved
[30:51] son this is the this is the body that
[30:54] i've chosen to come and live in here on
[30:56] this earth
[30:57] amen and so uh
[30:59] when there came such a voice this is my
[31:02] beloved son in whom i'm well pleased and
[31:04] this voice which came from heaven we
[31:06] heard
[31:07] and we were with him in the holy mount
[31:10] we have also a more sure word of
[31:13] prophecy where unto ye do well that ye
[31:17] take heed as unto a light that shineth
[31:20] in a dark place
[31:22] until the day dawn and the day star
[31:24] arise in your hearts see he realized
[31:27] that there was dispensational changes
[31:29] there was darkness and then came light
[31:32] there came revelation for him to
[31:34] recognize who he was his time his season
[31:38] he even realized that he made mistakes
[31:40] he even realized that he denied the lord
[31:42] he realized all those things but then
[31:44] the the revelation struck him clearly
[31:47] that hey
[31:48] i need to know my time
[31:50] i need to know my season this is my
[31:53] visitation
[31:54] this is why i'm this is why i'm on this
[31:57] earth praise god amen you know so
[32:00] knowing this first
[32:02] that no prophecy
[32:04] of the scripture is of any private
[32:07] interpretation
[32:09] that sums it all up
[32:11] it's god is his own interpreter god's
[32:14] gonna live through you god's gonna
[32:16] manifest through you god's gonna reveal
[32:18] his word his time his season in your
[32:21] life for the prophecy came not in old
[32:24] time by the will of man
[32:26] but holy men of god spake
[32:30] oh glory to god as they were moved
[32:34] by the holy spirit
[32:36] the holy ghost let us pray father
[32:39] we so appreciate your word
[32:41] your presence tonight lord
[32:43] we know that you know our hearts our
[32:45] needs
[32:46] whether we are present whether we are
[32:48] out there listening in from from
[32:51] the internet father lord you know every
[32:54] single one of us you know our time you
[32:56] know our season you know the word that
[32:59] we need to hear tonight
[33:01] it'll change our walks
[33:03] and lord we will just commit it all into
[33:05] your hands now lord let your spirit come
[33:08] anoint the atmospheres speaker and
[33:10] hearer in jesus name amen god bless you
[33:13] saints you may be seated
[33:16] and so uh the next slide just a real
[33:19] quick recap and then we'll move on here
[33:21] brother branham speaking here that you
[33:23] know in the message god is his own
[33:24] interpreter he says now all we are today
[33:27] is the display of his attributes
[33:30] what a beautiful just
[33:32] there was so much in that message you
[33:34] know like
[33:35] like
[33:36] you got to go back and listen to it
[33:38] again it's only 55 minutes or so you got
[33:41] to listen to it a few times like i did
[33:43] and it just kept just opening up and
[33:45] just making it so clear that
[33:49] we are god's interpretation of his word
[33:51] for this hour
[33:53] and that you coming into your position
[33:56] your realization is perfect faith that's
[33:59] going to bring an automatic
[34:01] transformation an automatic uh
[34:04] change in your life all the things that
[34:07] are around your life
[34:08] whatever circumstances conditions satan
[34:11] has put around your life or or
[34:14] generational spirits that have been
[34:15] around your life whatever it is that's
[34:18] that's hindering your walk in any way
[34:20] shape or form it's got to be moved it's
[34:23] got to be set aside it's got to be blown
[34:26] out of the water by revelation when you
[34:29] come into this
[34:30] when you realize that god is in you it's
[34:33] your hope of glory amen and so he talks
[34:35] about here how we are his attributes you
[34:38] know and then he talks about oh god was
[34:39] not even god but he was you know
[34:42] we just call him the eternal one he
[34:44] wasn't god because the word english word
[34:47] god means object of worship and there
[34:49] was nothing to worship him so he was the
[34:52] eternal one the main fountain of all
[34:54] intelligence and in this fountain of all
[34:56] intelligence there was not an atom
[34:58] molecule or nothing light nowhere star
[35:02] moon nothing else god what we know as
[35:05] god the great spirit that was eternal
[35:08] never did begin never did end he was
[35:11] there and in him was attributes
[35:14] attributes to be a god
[35:16] attributes uh to be god then his
[35:19] attributes to be a father attributes to
[35:22] be a son attributes to be a savior
[35:24] attributes to be a healer all these
[35:26] attributes was in him and now these
[35:30] things that has unfolded since then are
[35:33] just his attributes being made manifest
[35:38] so it's always been him
[35:40] it's always christ it's everything that
[35:43] you're looking for that's why he's your
[35:45] strength he's your shield you know if
[35:48] you're heavy laden and your burden you
[35:50] need to come to the lord because he'll
[35:52] give you strength he'll give you rest
[35:56] you come into that you know you come
[35:58] into that place as you walk with god
[36:00] that your walk with god is something
[36:03] that that that you have to die out to
[36:06] all your own interpretations all your
[36:09] your old
[36:10] ideas of what it is to be
[36:14] you know to even be a christian
[36:16] to be a christian
[36:18] is to know that christ
[36:20] in the power of his resurrection lives
[36:23] in you amen praise god and so let's just
[36:26] move on let's go down to now we're gonna
[36:29] we're gonna just keep moving along here
[36:32] let's go to slide number
[36:35] seven

[36:41] because you know as we have come
[36:45] and awakened from this darkness okay and
[36:47] we've come into the light of god's word
[36:50] then we also come to realize that
[36:53] because of that darkness
[36:55] we can shine
[36:59] you need to know
[37:01] that as long as you're in this dimension
[37:04] you're going to have to face an enemy
[37:07] a lot of people think oh you know it's
[37:09] okay
[37:10] god is with me i don't have to worry
[37:12] about nothing
[37:14] no no that's not what the word said the
[37:17] word says in ephesians chapter 6 put on
[37:19] the whole armor of god that ye may be
[37:22] able to stand against the wiles
[37:25] of the devil you know when i saw wiles i
[37:28] said you know that that that got me
[37:29] stirred i started to do some research i
[37:32] wanted to find out what this was all
[37:34] about
[37:34] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[37:37] blood but against principalities against
[37:40] powers
[37:41] against the rulers of the darkness of
[37:43] this world look against spiritual
[37:47] wickedness in high places
[37:50] a lot of people think oh yeah you know
[37:53] the the pope and the and the whole you
[37:56] know system and you know the highest
[37:58] powers on earth and he controls the
[38:00] money and he's the wealthiest you know
[38:02] the the vatican is the wealthiest
[38:04] organization in the world and you know
[38:07] and and we start looking at all of that
[38:09] and and thinking that these are these
[38:12] are the the the the the spiritual wicked
[38:15] yeah it is spiritual wickedness in high
[38:16] places but there's a lot higher places
[38:19] than that
[38:21] and you know where they are right in the
[38:22] ranks of this realm of
[38:24] the message
[38:28] listen how could it be so deceiving that
[38:30] it would deceive even the very elect
[38:33] where are the elect the elector in this
[38:36] message
[38:37] the elect have been called and have
[38:39] recognized their day and its message
[38:42] the elect are the ones that that are
[38:45] that are uh moving
[38:47] in the highest levels of revelation
[38:50] and satan he moves in those ranks too
[38:57] so let's look at this
[38:59] wiles of the devil next next slide do we
[39:01] have the air conditioning on a little
[39:03] better
[39:04] like just a little bit more
[39:06] yeah a little down a little cooler
[39:10] whiles are tricks or manipulations
[39:12] designed to deceive someone
[39:15] that's what wiles are
[39:18] okay
[39:19] you know there's a tongue-in-cheek
[39:20] phrase
[39:21] a woman's wiles refers to the
[39:24] seductiveness of fem
[39:27] fatales
[39:28] in using charm or sex appeal to elicit a
[39:32] desired response from a man satan uses
[39:36] his wiles we're going to look at those
[39:38] things here tonight this is this is
[39:40] wednesday night right bible study we're
[39:42] going to look at certain things because
[39:45] these things expose great uh you know
[39:47] traps and and uh and situations that
[39:50] satan tries to place around our lives
[39:53] because you know remember you're going
[39:55] to come into the light you're going to
[39:56] recognize you're going to you're going
[39:57] to recognize your day
[39:59] and your time when that happens you're
[40:01] going to realize that holy smokes the
[40:04] gates of hell
[40:05] are coming against me
[40:08] you're going to realize that you're
[40:09] going to have to overcome that's what
[40:11] the overcomer
[40:12] the the overcomer in this hour has to
[40:15] overcome
[40:17] you know it isn't just oh i'm a
[40:18] christian hallelujah i go to church and
[40:20] everything's fine yeah
[40:22] right the enemy is going to attack you
[40:25] every single day
[40:28] and unless you are prepared
[40:31] in your mind and you are aware of how
[40:34] the wiles of the enemy work you're going
[40:36] to be you're going to be
[40:38] busy just constantly getting out of
[40:40] traps you know you know people are
[40:41] saying oh i don't got enough money this
[40:43] month i'm constantly i need more money i
[40:46] need you know oh my relationships are
[40:49] falling apart you know satan keeps you
[40:51] so occupied on all those things
[40:54] so that he can keep you in a defeated
[40:56] condition so that you can't really be
[40:58] effective in the kingdom of god
[41:01] but when you realize who you are
[41:03] you start to wake up
[41:05] you start to realize hey wait a minute
[41:07] here
[41:08] be so deceiving that it would deceive
[41:10] even the very elect
[41:12] and if you see yourself in the word and
[41:15] you know that you're elected
[41:17] because this is not a time to you know
[41:18] to be like oh i wonder if i'm a
[41:20] christian or i wonder if i'm saved
[41:23] i wonder wonder what you know what
[41:26] you're in wonderland
[41:29] you've been on too many rides
[41:34] you're dizzy
[41:36] from the rides
[41:37] this is real
[41:39] god is real
[41:40] god is going to perform his word god
[41:42] listen all the situations that are going
[41:45] on out there in the world i was telling
[41:46] my own brother today
[41:48] i said len you know we're talking about
[41:50] certain things about you know planning
[41:52] and and all these things you know with
[41:54] investments and everything else i said
[41:56] len i want to make something clear here
[41:58] i said we are living in perilous times
[42:01] anything can happen
[42:03] things could change overnight
[42:05] who would have thought that we'd be in a
[42:07] war right now in ukraine where a whole
[42:09] country was literally taken over and and
[42:12] people were were scattered right from
[42:14] like millions of people 25 30 million
[42:17] people like you know like these are
[42:20] different times things could change like
[42:22] that
[42:23] and we also know that there is prophecy
[42:27] that is not going to make things get
[42:29] better
[42:30] things are going to get
[42:32] worse
[42:33] the world's going to go into great
[42:35] tribulation
[42:37] i imagine those people in ukraine are
[42:39] experiencing great tribulation but the
[42:42] whole world is going to experience that
[42:45] there's going to be a great change over
[42:47] the whole earth
[42:49] and and it's not going to get better
[42:52] there's going to be any an economic
[42:54] collapse scriptural
[42:57] written in the word of god you can't
[42:58] change it i can't change it no matter
[43:01] how we look at it we've got to recognize
[43:03] the day that we're living in and
[43:05] recognize that that this walk and this
[43:09] calling upon your life was not by
[43:11] accident
[43:13] god has a purpose for you god has a
[43:16] place for you in the word of god god has
[43:18] a portion of the word that you must
[43:20] fulfill whether you are young whether
[43:23] you are old regardless
[43:26] if you are an attribute of god it is god
[43:30] in you performing the word
[43:32] [Applause]
[43:34] hallelujah
[43:36] and so wilds of the devil are those
[43:37] clever schemes used by satan
[43:40] to ensnare us through temptation
[43:44] threat or intimidation
[43:47] so we're going to look at some of these
[43:49] right now
[43:52] hmm what would i do with my book okay
[43:57] i need a brother to go into the uh
[44:00] into the deacon's office please i got my
[44:02] notes there i brought my computer and
[44:04] forgot my notes
[44:08] here you got the key for the deacon's
[44:10] office it's on my desk
[44:12] so so so because i just had a few notes
[44:14] on on these four you know areas and
[44:17] examples of the wiles of the devil
[44:19] and i want to look at them and just give
[44:21] you some examples of how you know how
[44:23] they work in our lives and how it is
[44:24] that satan tries to you know get you off
[44:27] track
[44:28] you know challenging god's word you know
[44:30] satan's going to challenge god's word in
[44:32] your life
[44:33] you know things are going to come around
[44:34] you that are going to challenge you you
[44:37] know to to make you wonder if it is that
[44:40] what you believe is the truth you know
[44:42] like oh geez you know i really wonder if
[44:44] this message you know like what is is it
[44:47] for real you know is you know he's gonna
[44:50] he's gonna use every possible tactic to
[44:53] get you
[44:54] off the word of god to get you
[44:56] intimidated
[44:58] to get you thinking that you you know
[44:59] like you you know you you just been been
[45:02] fooled right praise god
[45:06] no it's the it's the folder
[45:15] excuse me for one moment saints
[45:17] it's right there sitting on my desk
[45:46] praise god
[45:48] amen and so so challenging you
[45:53] on the word of god and so here i want
[45:56] you to recognize back in genesis chapter
[45:58] 3
[45:59] it gives us a detailed look into the
[46:01] tactics of the enemy right it led the
[46:04] first human
[46:05] to sin and satan still uses it because
[46:08] it works so well
[46:10] and the and the first recorded word of
[46:12] the devil through the serpent was this
[46:14] did god really say
[46:17] you know did god really see these things
[46:20] with with those words the devil invited
[46:22] the woman to reconsider what she
[46:25] understood god to have said by adding
[46:28] her
[46:29] human interpretation on the word and
[46:32] remember this is all about understanding
[46:34] that god is his own interpreter
[46:36] you're not to put any interpretation on
[46:38] the word you're not to try and reason
[46:40] with the word you're not to try and and
[46:43] figure out the word
[46:45] this is the season and the time where
[46:47] the word is revealed
[46:49] the word is given by revelation
[46:52] it is it is the gates of hell cannot
[46:55] prevail against revelation
[46:58] amen
[46:59] he'll listen it'll prevail against all
[47:02] kinds of other things in your life when
[47:04] you operate from the human senses from
[47:07] your own ability that you think that you
[47:09] can oh i can do this i can do this you
[47:12] can't do it
[47:13] this is the hour where if god doesn't do
[47:16] it in you because of your communication
[47:20] your consciousness of god in your life
[47:23] that you're yielded enough because
[47:24] remember
[47:25] satan is going to test you with pride
[47:28] he's going to get you you know he'll
[47:30] come to you and he'll start you know
[47:32] hitting you with certain things you'll
[47:33] hear certain things that's why you got
[47:35] to be careful this is not the hour where
[47:37] you got to get into
[47:39] into religious disputes with people and
[47:41] try to convince them
[47:43] to believe the word of god you can't
[47:45] convince anybody to believe god's word
[47:47] this is the hour where the gates of hell
[47:49] will not prevail against revelation
[47:52] it is something that must be revealed
[47:54] divinely to you as an individual that's
[47:58] the only way you're going to have the
[47:59] confidence to face the wiles of the
[48:01] enemy
[48:03] hallelujah
[48:04] he was suggesting that we should
[48:06] re-examine the clear teachings of god's
[48:09] word satan invites you to add your own
[48:12] interpretation to the word of god don't
[48:14] do it
[48:16] this is the time where you don't add any
[48:19] interpretation
[48:20] let him interpret it for you
[48:23] let him fight your battles
[48:25] let him be the interpreter when somebody
[48:27] challenges you
[48:29] that's why he said don't you don't have
[48:30] to say nothing
[48:32] be still and know that i am god
[48:35] listen god is gonna he's gonna have a
[48:37] supernatural human race here upon the
[48:40] earth that's called the bride of christ
[48:42] that's gonna have supernatural moving
[48:45] around her life
[48:46] things will come into place
[48:49] you will notice these things if you're
[48:51] if you're if you're conscious and you're
[48:53] constantly aware of god in your life i'm
[48:56] telling you start from tonight from this
[48:59] moment
[49:00] to be aware of how things come together
[49:03] sometimes you think that man how did
[49:07] that all come together
[49:09] is because god is working things out in
[49:12] order to place you
[49:14] properly so that you can recognize that
[49:16] you're a son or a daughter of god
[49:19] without you realizing and recognizing
[49:21] that you're going to be in a defeated
[49:23] condition you're not going to be of any
[49:25] real service to the body of christ
[49:28] when people get together to fellowship
[49:30] with you they're getting discouraged
[49:33] instead of encouraged
[49:35] because of your fellowship because of
[49:37] your attitude because of your pride
[49:40] because of your you know your human
[49:43] understandings and and so forth don't
[49:46] interpret or put any interpretation
[49:49] and that's why god really says there's
[49:51] only
[49:52] you know uh clearly
[49:54] one thing we need to do and that is to
[49:56] put on the whole armor of god
[50:00] the whole armor
[50:02] realize that these wiles of the devil
[50:04] are going to come
[50:06] and the second thing he does is he
[50:07] starts to challenge your identity you're
[50:10] not a son of god you're not a daughter
[50:13] of god
[50:14] look at you
[50:15] look it's look at the way you acted
[50:18] he'll bring up every little thing when
[50:20] you say something when you do something
[50:23] watch out
[50:24] the devil is going to use that man i see
[50:27] examples of that all the time oh you
[50:30] know i said this and i wonder if they
[50:32] took this in the wrong way
[50:34] and before you know it that person is in
[50:36] a wild devil's
[50:39] wind of of battle in their mind
[50:42] trying to overcome because the devil
[50:44] knows where to attack
[50:46] right
[50:47] he knows where to hit you right between
[50:49] the ears the greatest battle is going to
[50:51] be right in your all you said this
[50:54] and now you are going to pay
[50:59] what a devil you know he'll try to he'll
[51:02] try to get you and and say to you see
[51:05] you are not a son of god you you
[51:09] you make those kind of mistakes and you
[51:11] call yourself a son of god if you're
[51:13] aware like that and you're having that
[51:16] battle it's because you are a son of god
[51:18] if you're in the midst of that wild
[51:20] world when it's because you are a son or
[51:22] a daughter of god it's because the devil
[51:25] wants to get you defeated and and become
[51:28] useless but you as a son or a daughter
[51:30] of god you'll come to a place where that
[51:33] revelation will strike
[51:35] and the gates of hell will not prevail
[51:37] and you'll walk away from that situation
[51:40] like it never existed amen
[51:43] glory to god amen that just fed me
[51:47] challenging our identity
[51:50] gives insight into several of the devils
[51:53] while satan came against jesus to tempt
[51:56] him in the wilderness
[51:58] on two different occasions satan began
[52:01] his temptations with these words
[52:04] if you
[52:06] are the son of god
[52:10] if you are a son of god
[52:14] hallelujah satan knew exactly who jesus
[52:17] was
[52:18] let me tell you he knew
[52:20] but he wanted to get him off track
[52:24] jesus
[52:25] jesus was there
[52:27] when satan fell like lightning from
[52:29] heaven hallelujah and and and
[52:32] significantly the devil chose a time
[52:35] when jesus was physically weak and
[52:37] hungry to attack his identity
[52:40] i'm going to tell you guys something
[52:42] i'm going to recommend
[52:45] you get proper sleep
[52:49] what is this is this a church service or
[52:52] is this
[52:54] 30 minutes with dr dan

[53:12] sleep
[53:15] i go i gotta i got i feel i feel
[53:18] mentally exhausted and tired
[53:20] and even last night right after last
[53:22] night i was dealing with a with a real
[53:23] estate transaction
[53:25] and and things you know like i was up
[53:27] from 4am
[53:29] tuesday morning down at the market
[53:31] loading flowers delivering to brampton i
[53:34] was and then this deal comes along and
[53:36] we're negotiating and we're back and
[53:38] forth and there was some some confusion
[53:40] in the midst of it and i even felt
[53:42] myself starting to get a little agitated
[53:45] and i said i sent a text to the to the
[53:48] to the group
[53:49] and i said i'm going to bed
[53:51] i said we will
[53:53] deal with this in the morning they were
[53:55] thinking we got we got we got the deal
[53:57] we're gonna make it tonight i said no
[53:59] in my mind i said no that's it it was so
[54:02] clear to me get to bed now
[54:05] and i went to sleep and then they
[54:06] continued texting i didn't care my phone
[54:08] went off i went to bed i woke up this
[54:11] morning the deal was done
[54:15] the deal was done
[54:17] i just had to do my final part that i
[54:20] knew i had to do which i already knew
[54:22] was gonna was gonna happen and so i just
[54:24] did it everything got done the deal got
[54:26] done i i realized that i don't need to
[54:30] be
[54:31] tempted and brought into because i could
[54:33] have got hot last night from the from
[54:35] the from being so tired
[54:37] you guys you got to realize you'll get
[54:39] tired you'll get weak
[54:41] be careful of those times and understand
[54:44] that you have to step back and you got
[54:47] to se you got to separate yourself from
[54:49] the situation and you need to make sure
[54:51] you get your rest
[54:52] do not push yourself oh i got to make
[54:55] the money i don't care i need four jobs
[54:58] no no things will get worse if you do
[55:00] that
[55:01] you're not trusting god you're not
[55:03] relying on the grace of god in your life
[55:06] and so it it takes it takes
[55:09] understanding that you need certain
[55:11] you're still in a human body you're
[55:13] still human you're still got you still
[55:14] got to be fed you still gotta eat you
[55:17] still gotta sleep
[55:18] one of the things that's most powerful
[55:20] that i realize is you need your sleep so
[55:23] make sure you're getting it so that you
[55:25] can be sharp
[55:26] because the wiles of the devil is going
[55:28] to be moving constantly trying to get
[55:31] you and deceive you challenging your
[55:34] identity satan does the same thing to us
[55:38] to make his wiles more effective he hits
[55:40] us during a crisis
[55:42] or
[55:43] spiritual struggle and suggests if you
[55:45] were a child of god this wouldn't have
[55:47] happened to you
[55:48] no the reason why it's happening to you
[55:51] most of the time is because you are a
[55:53] child of god
[55:55] it's because he's always trying to set
[55:57] us back he's always trying to do things
[55:59] but if you do
[56:01] your part and this one thing i know by
[56:03] experience
[56:05] you do your part you know that you've
[56:07] done all that you can the scripture says
[56:09] do all that you can
[56:11] and then stand
[56:13] and let
[56:14] the lord interpret it
[56:16] he will
[56:17] interpret his word
[56:19] he will
[56:20] allow his perfect will to take place in
[56:24] your life
[56:25] we start to run off and oh this this is
[56:28] how i see it this is how i'm going to do
[56:30] it and it might even look good and it
[56:32] might and god will say it's it's not my
[56:34] perfect will it's my permissive will
[56:36] because you're so stubborn you know
[56:39] because you always want to do it your
[56:40] way you always got to have the last say
[56:42] you always gotta you know no just step
[56:45] back
[56:46] and understand that this is the time in
[56:48] the season where god is gonna do it for
[56:51] you
[56:52] provided you've done all that you can a
[56:55] lot of people say oh well god's in
[56:56] control i don't need to do nothing
[56:59] i got to make a payment at the end of
[57:01] the month
[57:03] it's 1600 for rent
[57:06] the boss is offering me 40 hours a week
[57:08] i don't feel like working this week
[57:13] i don't feel like working this week i
[57:15] don't feel like doing that
[57:17] they change my position i don't feel
[57:18] like doing that well praise god if god
[57:21] gives you enough
[57:22] [Music]
[57:24] funds in the bank that you can live for
[57:26] the next two years without worrying
[57:28] about a job
[57:31] and you got the right attitude you can
[57:33] take a vacation for a year or two years
[57:36] praise god that's a great sabbatical god
[57:38] will use it god will do things in your
[57:40] life he'll do whatever he needs to do
[57:42] but if you are relying on that paycheck
[57:45] and then you don't feel like work i know
[57:47] people like that
[57:49] and i and i i don't say anything i said
[57:50] what the heck am i going to say
[57:52] they need the money they want the money
[57:55] i call them into work they don't want to
[57:57] work
[57:58] [Laughter]
[58:04] but it's it's just the way of the world
[58:07] you know it's just it's just a way but
[58:09] satan
[58:11] he works on these areas amen twisting
[58:14] scripture another of the wows of the
[58:16] devil used against jesus was to quote
[58:19] scripture but with a twist
[58:22] you know you know you we there's a lot
[58:24] of examples in in luke satan quotes in
[58:28] psalms 91 in an effort to persuade jesus
[58:30] to act in the flesh rather than to
[58:33] follow the spirit but satan failed to
[58:36] complete the thought of the psalm the
[58:38] next verse in in psalms 91 13 says you
[58:42] will tread on the lion
[58:44] and the cobra you will trample the great
[58:47] lion and the serpent those animal
[58:49] references are metaphors for fierce and
[58:52] dangerous enemies and the devil is
[58:54] likened unto both a lion and a serpent
[58:57] in the scripture
[59:00] but satan will come into if you be the
[59:03] son of god why don't you just throw
[59:05] yourself off
[59:10] you know the true meaning
[59:12] of of of the passage of psalms 91 is
[59:15] that god will protect and empower his
[59:18] servants as they overcome the enemy
[59:23] as you overcome
[59:25] now overcoming is something that you
[59:27] have to do
[59:30] look at the word overcome
[59:32] overcome means it's something you gotta
[59:35] do
[59:35] not something that you just rely on god
[59:37] to do
[59:38] no you overcome
[59:40] by resisting the enemy resisting the
[59:42] devil and then god comes on the scene
[59:46] and he empowers you and protects you
[59:49] because you're his servant one of the
[59:50] wows of the devil is to leave out key
[59:52] parts of scripture in order to twist its
[59:56] meaning to fit his agenda
[1:00:01] praise god
[1:00:02] glory to god offering a tempting
[1:00:06] alternative
[1:00:09] you know that's you know another amazing
[1:00:12] scheme or while of the devil used
[1:00:15] when he used the temptation of jesus was
[1:00:18] to suggest another path avoiding strict
[1:00:20] obedience to god's will cunningly satan
[1:00:22] knew better than to to just suggest that
[1:00:25] jesus forget the whole plan of salvation
[1:00:29] he just used something to twist them
[1:00:31] away from it
[1:00:32] and go back to heaven instead he offered
[1:00:36] an alternative and the devil led him up
[1:00:38] to a high place and showed him an
[1:00:40] instant all the kingdoms of the world
[1:00:42] and he said to him i will give you all
[1:00:45] their authority and splendor because
[1:00:47] it's been given to me
[1:00:49] you know and satan is going to tempt you
[1:00:51] in those areas
[1:00:53] especially you businessmen you know as
[1:00:55] you mature as a businessman and you grow
[1:00:58] financially in the lord satan is going
[1:01:01] to do things around your life he's going
[1:01:04] to try to set up certain traps you know
[1:01:06] to get you looking you know to to to you
[1:01:09] know this possibility of you know but
[1:01:12] you know what you're gonna have to do
[1:01:14] this to get there
[1:01:16] you're gonna have to use a little bit of
[1:01:18] mumble jumbo
[1:01:20] business dealings
[1:01:22] you're gonna have to go off in this area
[1:01:25] here and you're gonna have to be see
[1:01:27] he's trying to use his power because
[1:01:30] remember he is the god of this world
[1:01:34] of this world
[1:01:36] god is the god of
[1:01:38] the whole plan
[1:01:40] the universe
[1:01:41] he's he's almighty god satan is just a
[1:01:44] god here on earth because he has so much
[1:01:47] power and influence in government
[1:01:50] and they control the money systems
[1:01:53] that's why what you see and what you're
[1:01:54] witnessing right now is a perfect
[1:01:56] example of how satan controls the money
[1:01:59] systems
[1:02:00] they release money by lowering interest
[1:02:03] rates
[1:02:04] when they lower interest rates money
[1:02:06] flows into the economy people get money
[1:02:09] easily they borrow money companies
[1:02:11] borrow money
[1:02:12] so cheap it's never been like it was the
[1:02:14] last 10 years
[1:02:16] zero percent interest rates
[1:02:18] it never got to those that's historical
[1:02:21] because it's the big setup
[1:02:23] it's the big setup for the big climax
[1:02:26] but they were releasing money into the
[1:02:28] system into the world and economically
[1:02:31] the everywhere you go look at look what
[1:02:33] happened just in the last
[1:02:35] five years you know that real estate
[1:02:37] prices
[1:02:38] doubled
[1:02:39] it took previously 30 to 50 years for
[1:02:42] something like that to happen
[1:02:44] and they did it in five years
[1:02:46] they inflated assets to extreme
[1:02:49] ridiculous why how they release money
[1:02:52] into the system
[1:02:53] and the more they release the more the
[1:02:55] people oh it's cheap oh i got a line of
[1:02:56] credit on my house it's only at one
[1:02:58] percent 1.5
[1:03:00] it's cheap money i'll just take it
[1:03:02] invested in the stock market my buddy
[1:03:04] said he made 30 last month on his money
[1:03:07] my god i haven't made 30 of my money in
[1:03:10] five years or 20 years i you know i i
[1:03:12] got to do this and they start getting
[1:03:14] caught into the trap do you know what
[1:03:16] the biggest trap right now is debt
[1:03:19] it's the biggest trap it's got people so
[1:03:22] deceived
[1:03:23] and now what are they doing they're
[1:03:25] pulling their money back
[1:03:27] how are they pulling their money back by
[1:03:29] raising interest rates
[1:03:30] have you noticed that the stock market
[1:03:32] has lost about 28 percent in the last
[1:03:35] five months
[1:03:36] have you noticed that the the real
[1:03:38] estate market is starting to crumble
[1:03:41] it's starting to lose
[1:03:43] its glitter
[1:03:45] all those multiple offers
[1:03:48] they're gone
[1:03:50] they're gone it's like it's like it
[1:03:51] happened overnight i'm in it i see it
[1:03:54] it's like somebody just turned off a
[1:03:55] switch and it's like boop what's going
[1:03:58] on here
[1:03:59] houses that were selling for 1.5 million
[1:04:02] dollars
[1:04:03] three months ago are on the market today
[1:04:05] for 1.250
[1:04:07] that's a quarter million dollars less in
[1:04:10] three months
[1:04:12] that's only the beginning
[1:04:13] why because they're pulling back their
[1:04:16] money
[1:04:16] satan's system is pulling back
[1:04:19] so that it gets people trapped and now
[1:04:22] they're trapped and people bought these
[1:04:24] homes
[1:04:25] they put 200 000 down
[1:04:27] it took them 40 years 30 years some of
[1:04:30] them are you know like you know
[1:04:32] adults they're just coming into their
[1:04:33] first home
[1:04:34] they're 35 40 years old and they save a
[1:04:37] couple hundred thousand dollars honey
[1:04:39] the real estate market just keeps going
[1:04:41] higher we got to get in
[1:04:42] yes you should have been getting in
[1:04:45] how do you time something like that you
[1:04:46] can't time anything because you're not
[1:04:48] fighting against flesh and blood you're
[1:04:50] fighting against powers
[1:04:52] principalities and dominions in high
[1:04:55] places
[1:04:57] there's there's financial control that's
[1:04:59] taking place in high places
[1:05:02] they don't care about the average person
[1:05:05] they go and save their 200 thousand they
[1:05:07] go buy that house they get into a
[1:05:09] bidding war they end up paying a hundred
[1:05:11] thousand more than they should have but
[1:05:13] because the interest rates are so low
[1:05:15] they qualify for the mortgage and they
[1:05:16] say honey we still qualify for the
[1:05:18] mortgage
[1:05:19] and two months later when they got to
[1:05:21] close the deal the bank goes and does an
[1:05:23] appraisal on that house and finds out
[1:05:25] that the same house down the street just
[1:05:28] sold for two hundred thousand dollars
[1:05:30] less it's happening i'm telling you
[1:05:37] all of a sudden their whole
[1:05:40] their whole world is just falling apart
[1:05:42] you mean all my equity the bank says you
[1:05:44] got to come up with another 200 000
[1:05:48] because your 200 000 down is not enough
[1:05:50] now
[1:05:50] you qualified based on a value of 1.4
[1:05:53] million what you paid
[1:05:55] when
[1:05:57] the market was there but now the market
[1:05:59] has changed and the banks do not care
[1:06:00] they're ruthless
[1:06:02] they go based on what the computer
[1:06:04] program tells them the profile they do
[1:06:06] not qualify it's that simple the
[1:06:08] appraisal came in they input the number
[1:06:11] into the computer it's irrelevant it's
[1:06:13] just boom the number comes out wait a
[1:06:15] minute
[1:06:16] they don't qualify
[1:06:18] and this is how this world is being so
[1:06:20] so here's another thing that that we
[1:06:23] need to be aware of
[1:06:24] be aware of how the devil is going to
[1:06:27] try and trap
[1:06:28] in certain ways in certain areas right
[1:06:31] now the there's there's a there's a
[1:06:33] shift taking place in the financial
[1:06:36] world and we need to be aware we need to
[1:06:38] be aware so that we don't get caught
[1:06:41] and we end up you know falling under the
[1:06:43] temptations
[1:06:44] because he's trying to give you an uh an
[1:06:47] alternative temptation to get rich
[1:06:50] oh everybody's been making money in the
[1:06:52] stock market everybody's been making
[1:06:54] money i remember last year everybody was
[1:06:56] like man my portfolio just keeps going
[1:06:58] higher old people were saying holy
[1:07:00] smokes man my portfolio just went up
[1:07:03] another 50 000 last month
[1:07:06] you know
[1:07:07] now a year later
[1:07:09] they don't want to talk about it
[1:07:12] it's like the whole year like everything
[1:07:14] got wiped out just like like literally
[1:07:16] overnight
[1:07:18] and it's happening
[1:07:19] and people are are like now and that's
[1:07:22] why
[1:07:23] these are these are very very scary
[1:07:26] times amen let's let's look at the next
[1:07:28] slide
[1:07:30] so we've looked at at these uh you know
[1:07:32] say listen one in in just in in winding
[1:07:36] down this whole area of the wiles of the
[1:07:37] devil
[1:07:38] understand something
[1:07:41] satan's n is already known
[1:07:44] it's already known
[1:07:46] okay so so be aware of this you know
[1:07:49] because it kind of balances things out
[1:07:51] for you
[1:07:52] because you might be in certain
[1:07:54] situations you might be in certain
[1:07:56] conditions
[1:07:57] but that's not the end for you there
[1:07:59] he's going to be bound for a thousand
[1:08:01] years
[1:08:02] so it's already
[1:08:04] everything is is already in place but
[1:08:06] the thing is we're still here
[1:08:09] we're still in this dimension and just
[1:08:11] like a rattlesnake do you know that
[1:08:13] they've they've cut the head off of a
[1:08:15] rattlesnake
[1:08:17] and thought that you know that that
[1:08:18] rattlesnake was dead but but the head
[1:08:20] was still very active and there's been
[1:08:24] countless numbers of people that got
[1:08:27] bitten by rattlesnakes whose heads were
[1:08:29] cut off and still ended up dying
[1:08:35] okay
[1:08:36] that devil he's got
[1:08:38] an end but while we are here we need to
[1:08:41] recognize that he's still causing havoc
[1:08:44] because though his head is cut off
[1:08:46] he ain't dead yet
[1:08:48] he ain't bound up yet he ain't locked up
[1:08:51] yet so you need to realize that as a son
[1:08:54] of god
[1:08:55] amen
[1:08:56] so brother branham speaking here he says
[1:08:59] now
[1:09:01] in in the stature of a perfect man he
[1:09:03] says now that is the house that god
[1:09:04] dwells in not a building with a big bell
[1:09:08] on top of it and a high steeple see but
[1:09:11] a body has thou prepared for me
[1:09:15] see now we're gonna we're just we're
[1:09:16] just looking and we're moving along here
[1:09:18] and we're phasing into how god is his
[1:09:21] own interpreter
[1:09:22] now that we've kind of exposed some of
[1:09:24] the wiles of the devil right now we can
[1:09:27] move on to realize who we are
[1:09:29] and keep our focus and understanding
[1:09:32] that it's christ in you your hope of
[1:09:34] glory
[1:09:36] that's how you are going to overcome in
[1:09:37] this hour
[1:09:39] by knowing that god is his own
[1:09:40] interpreter
[1:09:41] a body has thou prepared me a body that
[1:09:44] god can dwell in
[1:09:46] god can walk in god can see it
[1:09:50] god can talk in god can work in
[1:09:54] living instrumentally of god
[1:09:58] you see god is working in your life
[1:10:00] when you go to work in the morning god
[1:10:03] goes to work with you in the morning
[1:10:05] i love that i i listen i walk down to
[1:10:08] the sometimes i gotta walk into the food
[1:10:10] terminal and i'm looking for certain
[1:10:13] things
[1:10:14] and i didn't rebook it i didn't you know
[1:10:16] i wasn't prepared i missed i missed
[1:10:18] calling the person because everything
[1:10:20] just happened so quickly and i just
[1:10:22] gotta walk but i i walk and i and i'm
[1:10:24] thinking lord i'm walking with you
[1:10:26] you're gonna send me exactly where i
[1:10:28] need to go i need these products these
[1:10:30] items i would love it you know and i
[1:10:32] talk just like that i'm walking them
[1:10:34] it's like
[1:10:35] why not
[1:10:37] i believe this word
[1:10:39] do you believe this word you believe
[1:10:40] you're walking with god
[1:10:42] all things are possible to them that
[1:10:46] glory to god so why not walk believing
[1:10:49] walk and then you all of a sudden you go
[1:10:52] there hey dan dan
[1:10:54] i'll go over there yeah yeah yeah says
[1:10:56] you need any of this
[1:10:59] somebody just canceled the order it's a
[1:11:01] hot item
[1:11:04] somebody just canceled the order i said
[1:11:07] yeah
[1:11:08] i said what's the price
[1:11:11] this much
[1:11:13] it's too much
[1:11:14] in my mind
[1:11:16] i'll say i'll take it all
[1:11:19] you see god gave me that
[1:11:22] i don't need to argue and sometimes
[1:11:24] there's a time for for there's a time
[1:11:26] and a season for everything
[1:11:29] and this is where we need to realize we
[1:11:30] need to be wise
[1:11:32] when you need to bargain when you need
[1:11:35] to you know negotiate there's a time for
[1:11:38] that
[1:11:38] but then there's times where you just
[1:11:41] you pay
[1:11:42] and you say no
[1:11:44] you just say thank you lord
[1:11:46] you just say thank you lord you gave
[1:11:48] this to me and i and i want that person
[1:11:50] to be blessed i want them to be blessed
[1:11:53] because i know that if i
[1:11:55] what kind of a spirit would i have on me
[1:11:57] if i got a constantly you know that's
[1:11:59] why i don't like that spirit i don't
[1:12:01] mind negotiating because the
[1:12:03] negotiations are
[1:12:05] they're happening it's the time
[1:12:07] everybody's expecting it it's it's just
[1:12:10] the way that it is it's it's the season
[1:12:12] for it so you can negotiate you can be
[1:12:15] and this is this is understanding god's
[1:12:18] way of moving in your life to keep you
[1:12:20] balanced to keep you not getting
[1:12:23] unbalanced because if you you know
[1:12:25] sometimes i've got into situations where
[1:12:28] it gets hot and the guy gets angry
[1:12:30] because what ends up happening you know
[1:12:32] somebody insults somebody and then all
[1:12:34] of a sudden oh well
[1:12:37] it changes the whole thing
[1:12:39] but if you've allowed god you're walking
[1:12:41] and you and he does it he brings it to
[1:12:43] you and then you still fight and argue
[1:12:48] like what's that all about
[1:12:51] you're walking with god so you're
[1:12:52] believing god is gonna do it then let
[1:12:55] him do it and then walk on
[1:12:58] and understand that that this is the
[1:13:00] time that he does these kinds of things
[1:13:02] it doesn't matter
[1:13:04] the circumstance it's it's the
[1:13:07] revelation that you
[1:13:09] catch while you're in the midst of
[1:13:11] walking with god
[1:13:13] and and seeing him do these wonderful
[1:13:15] things in your life
[1:13:16] god walking on two feet where
[1:13:19] in you
[1:13:21] glory the footsteps of the righteous is
[1:13:24] ordered of god
[1:13:26] nothing but the truth god walking in you
[1:13:29] for you are written epistles read of all
[1:13:32] men and if the life that's in christ be
[1:13:35] in you you'll bear the life that christ
[1:13:44] bore next slide
[1:13:48] when we look at this slide
[1:13:50] you know
[1:13:51] because it's important you know
[1:13:55] a lot of people get caught up into
[1:13:58] they gotta become perfect
[1:14:01] i gotta i gotta walk perfect
[1:14:04] i gotta be perfect you know and one of
[1:14:06] the things that you know in this message
[1:14:08] you know we've seen this many many times
[1:14:11] and you know as we look through it we
[1:14:13] see the seven steps and we see that
[1:14:16] faith is the first step virtue knowledge
[1:14:18] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:14:20] kindness the holy ghost divine love all
[1:14:23] of this

[1:14:29] it's not about you you know yeah the
[1:14:31] scripture says and you know faith put on
[1:14:33] virtue virtue put on knowledge and then
[1:14:35] put on your temperance and and learn
[1:14:37] patience all of those things are you

[1:14:48] his virtues in me
[1:14:51] his his love in me
[1:14:54] god i can love these people because you
[1:14:57] love them
[1:14:58] god so loved the world it said that he
[1:15:01] gave himself
[1:15:03] it wasn't that god so loved just you
[1:15:06] it's because god so loved so
[1:15:08] understanding that you're walking with
[1:15:10] god is understanding that it's all his
[1:15:14] virtue all his love all his divine
[1:15:17] knowledge it's his knowledge it's not
[1:15:18] your knowledge
[1:15:20] when you have to memorize things and you
[1:15:22] got to just constantly memorize and
[1:15:24] memorize and you become a parrot and all
[1:15:26] you do is quote quote quote without
[1:15:29] having the life without having the
[1:15:31] revelation the experience of god
[1:15:34] experiencing that thing when you're
[1:15:36] listening to the prophet and you're
[1:15:38] hearing the prophet talk about a certain
[1:15:40] experience that he had with god you can
[1:15:43] identify with the experience because you
[1:15:46] had the same kind of experience
[1:15:49] because it was the same god in you
[1:15:52] that was in brother branham
[1:15:55] it's the same god that's living in us
[1:15:57] dwelling in us fulfilling his word
[1:16:00] interpreting his word
[1:16:02] he wants to interpret the word for
[1:16:06] himself
[1:16:07] but yet
[1:16:08] we need so you know i just wanted this
[1:16:10] because this i didn't bring it in a way
[1:16:13] where you know uh this is the things
[1:16:15] that we need to do we need to be more
[1:16:17] godly
[1:16:19] no you can't be godly
[1:16:21] you can't be spiritual
[1:16:25] it's the spirit of god in you that gives
[1:16:28] you
[1:16:28] a spirit
[1:16:30] of love a spirit of
[1:16:32] peace spirit of of understanding
[1:16:36] because it's his spirit
[1:16:38] let's move on
[1:16:40] in the message
[1:16:42] shalom
[1:16:44] you can go to the next slide
[1:16:48] brother branham speaking here he says
[1:16:50] see you are known when jesus christ
[1:16:52] lives in you by
[1:16:55] his life
[1:16:56] and promised word
[1:16:58] of this day
[1:17:00] reflects itself
[1:17:03] you see how that's underlined
[1:17:07] i'm going to read it again
[1:17:09] you are known when jesus christ lives in
[1:17:12] you by his life and promised word
[1:17:17] for this day reflects
[1:17:20] itself
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:23] can you hear that he's his own
[1:17:25] interpreter see when men see you living
[1:17:28] like him when he sees your character
[1:17:31] your conduct with the word just exactly
[1:17:34] like he was the word being manifested
[1:17:38] then men will see jesus christ
[1:17:41] but it's not something that you put on
[1:17:44] it's something that you are
[1:17:47] you are a child of god you are an
[1:17:51] attribute of god
[1:17:54] i don't call myself a christian
[1:17:57] i don't call myself a catholic i don't
[1:18:00] call myself a baptist i don't call
[1:18:02] myself a presbyterian i don't call
[1:18:05] myself a jehovah witness i although
[1:18:08] that's people call themselves and they
[1:18:10] give themselves titles and it's all
[1:18:13] based on man's teachings
[1:18:16] all based on man's interpretation of the
[1:18:18] word of god
[1:18:20] all the every every foundation of when
[1:18:23] you call yourself a roman catholic
[1:18:25] your foundational teachings are based on
[1:18:28] the interpretations of the popes and the
[1:18:31] fathers and the priests as they
[1:18:33] interpret the word to you instead of you
[1:18:36] looking deeply yourself sincerely into
[1:18:39] the word of god to identify yourself
[1:18:42] with the word
[1:18:44] not with a church
[1:18:47] you are an attribute of god because
[1:18:50] you've heard your you've heard your name
[1:18:52] being called not by your first name brad
[1:18:55] but by the fact that you have recognized
[1:18:58] your time
[1:19:01] your season
[1:19:03] your day and your message in your life
[1:19:06] because you are called you personally
[1:19:09] have been called
[1:19:10] that's why you can't convince somebody
[1:19:13] to be anything
[1:19:14] until god calls them
[1:19:17] personally
[1:19:19] as an individual places them gives them
[1:19:21] faith
[1:19:23] to live this life and to and to do it
[1:19:25] with passion
[1:19:27] to live for christ with passion
[1:19:32] if jesus would come today
[1:19:34] would he take sides with the methodists
[1:19:36] with the baptists with the adventist
[1:19:39] jehovah witness
[1:19:41] christian science pentecostals
[1:19:44] presbyterians no sir he certainly would
[1:19:47] not it's an individual affair of you and
[1:19:51] god
[1:19:53] glory to god
[1:19:55] that's what it is
[1:19:56] it'll never change saints if we're going
[1:19:59] to get out of here is because the same
[1:20:00] spirit that raised christ from the dead
[1:20:03] it dwells in you and it'll quicken your
[1:20:06] mortal body you're going to need a
[1:20:08] supernatural quickening of the word in
[1:20:10] your life and the only way that that's
[1:20:12] going to come is when you recognize by
[1:20:15] perfect faith that you are walking with
[1:20:17] god and that you've come into a
[1:20:19] recognition that you are not some uh
[1:20:22] some title some church uh organization
[1:20:26] or denomination you are attributes of
[1:20:29] god you've been you've been awakened
[1:20:31] your mind is no longer your own mind but
[1:20:34] you've put on the mind of christ
[1:20:40] our life will interpret the rapture
[1:20:44] your life is going to interpret the
[1:20:45] rapture
[1:20:47] this is the time i'm going to i'm going
[1:20:49] to close now
[1:20:50] this is the time
[1:20:52] and the season for the rapture
[1:20:56] remember yes the world goes into great
[1:20:58] tribulation
[1:21:00] but
[1:21:01] just before it gets really bad
[1:21:04] the lord has promised to take
[1:21:06] his church
[1:21:08] not the churches
[1:21:11] his body
[1:21:13] if the same spirit that raised christ
[1:21:15] from the dead dwell in you
[1:21:17] personally
[1:21:19] it'll quicken
[1:21:21] your mortal body it'll move you out of
[1:21:23] this dimension
[1:21:25] into another dimension where the
[1:21:27] redeemed are
[1:21:28] that is known as the rapture
[1:21:31] and so the part that you are going to
[1:21:34] interpret in this hour
[1:21:37] is the rapture
[1:21:40] that's god's interpretation
[1:21:42] we need to see the season the time what
[1:21:45] god is going to interpret what he's
[1:21:46] going to do
[1:21:48] when when isaiah cried out a virgin
[1:21:50] shall conceive 400 years later a virgin
[1:21:54] showed up on the scene it was her time
[1:21:57] it was her season
[1:21:59] she was prophecy that was spoken by men
[1:22:02] that were moved by the holy ghost
[1:22:05] and we've got a sure word of prophecy in
[1:22:07] this hour that says the bride is going
[1:22:09] to go in a rapture
[1:22:11] she's going to be changed in a moment in
[1:22:13] the twinkling of an eye that's going to
[1:22:15] take place it's going to manifest just
[1:22:18] like when mary came on the scene she was
[1:22:20] just a regular woman
[1:22:22] and all of a sudden an angel appears to
[1:22:24] her and says blessed art thou amongst
[1:22:26] all women
[1:22:30] because the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:22:33] and you're going to bring forth
[1:22:35] a body
[1:22:36] it's going to be called jesus
[1:22:38] and in that body is going to be the
[1:22:41] creator himself he's going to come and
[1:22:43] visit the earth it was an awesome thing
[1:22:46] it was unimaginable
[1:22:48] imagine that and here we are we're
[1:22:50] talking about a rapture you're going to
[1:22:51] be changed
[1:22:53] well what is that too hard for the lord
[1:22:55] no you're going to interpret the word
[1:22:57] we're not living in a pentecostal age
[1:23:00] we're living in another age
[1:23:02] see we're not living in the methodist
[1:23:04] age we're we're we're living in another
[1:23:07] age we're living on up here to the bride
[1:23:11] age
[1:23:12] the calling out of the church and
[1:23:14] getting it together for
[1:23:16] the rapture
[1:23:18] that's the age that we're now living to
[1:23:21] my honest opinion that's exactly the
[1:23:24] truth
[1:23:26] hallelujah praise god let the musicians
[1:23:29] come
[1:23:31] modern events made clear by vindicated
[1:23:34] prophecy what a perfect
[1:23:36] what a perfect uh quote
[1:23:39] from the word
[1:23:40] from from from our prophet and even the
[1:23:42] title makes it very clear
[1:23:46] you know so
[1:23:48] we're gonna we're gonna stop right there
[1:23:49] i'm still like only
[1:23:51] you know
[1:23:52] i'd say two-thirds of the way through
[1:23:55] but
[1:23:57] we'll wait for another time
[1:23:59] when the lord makes a way for us by the
[1:24:00] grace of god and we'll continue on but
[1:24:03] you know we're living in a time saints
[1:24:05] where god
[1:24:07] is is he's the same yesterday today and
[1:24:09] forever
[1:24:10] and we should never forget that
[1:24:12] god is his own interpreter
[1:24:14] god is bringing to pass and dealing with
[1:24:17] each and every one of our lives
[1:24:20] in very very you know uh simple but
[1:24:23] precise ways this is the you know
[1:24:26] ephesians chapter 4 talks about the the
[1:24:28] the need of the five-fold ministry and
[1:24:31] the purpose of it
[1:24:33] for the perfecting
[1:24:34] of the church
[1:24:36] i believe we're in that season
[1:24:39] and god is going to perfect
[1:24:41] each and every one of our lives
[1:24:43] to reflect him
[1:24:45] not to reflect your perfection to make
[1:24:48] you perfect
[1:24:50] you'll never be perfect here on this
[1:24:52] earth
[1:24:53] don't try to be perfect
[1:24:55] you'll only get confused you'll only get
[1:24:57] discouraged
[1:24:58] you know
[1:24:59] that's why you know phenomenal athletes
[1:25:02] they deal with depression like you have
[1:25:04] no idea
[1:25:05] okay because they're constantly being
[1:25:07] under the pressure to be perfect to be
[1:25:10] better to constantly be the you know
[1:25:12] better than the rest and and that's not
[1:25:15] an easy thing
[1:25:19] but god
[1:25:21] has given us his grace in this hour
[1:25:26] ahead brother david lead us in a song
[1:25:34] if the
[1:25:35] same spirit
[1:25:37] that raised christ from the dead
[1:25:47] [Music]
[1:25:58] [Music]
[1:26:05] if
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:30] dwells in you
[1:26:32] it dwells in you
[1:26:36] if that
[1:26:37] same spirit that raised christ from the
[1:26:41] dead
[1:26:46] [Music]
[1:27:00] it is
[1:27:12] oh
[1:27:30] if
[1:27:35] [Music]
[1:27:45] greater is he that is in me
[1:27:49] greater is he that is in me
[1:27:52] greater is he that is
