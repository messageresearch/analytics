TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] dear friends good Sunday morning I'm happy to be here I'm here to speak on the subject of the Living Dead I'm Pastor John Simon let us pray gracious Heavenly Father we pray your blessing upon this wonderful time in your presence bless the hearers and the speaker and take all the glory honor and praise in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen let us read our scripture of first Timothy 5 verse 6 which reads thus but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth may I repeat first Timothy 5:16 but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth the scripture of course is speaking about wanton widows who enjoy the pleasures of sin by loose living it is saying but she that lives in sin or for sin or for the pleasure or the enjoyment of sin is already spiritually dead why she is yet alive in other words she is a literal Walking Dead the scriptural extension and the compound application of this scripture would not only say she but she he or they that live in sin or lives for the pleasures and the enjoyment for sin those that live with an appetite and constant desire for sin one is one of the Living Dead certainly my friends I want you like Lazarus to come out from amongst the dead don't live that way don't associate yourself with the Living Dead but the call this morning is for you to come out from a mouse the dead now we know that November 1st is usually celebrated as the day of the dead All Saints Day and also called All Souls Day then we see this time also ties in with Halloween which is generally October 31st and it's the observance of this Day of the Dead night of the Dead Halloween is usually observed by the burning of candles by prayers for the dead and by visits to of all places to the cemetery now both of these traditional observances of Halloween and of All Saints Day are literally of pagan origins that have successfully inserted themselves into Christianity one speaks of the day of the dead and the other speaks of the night of the dead considered to be the one and only night where it's believed that on that one night the dead are allowed to come out of their graves and to cross back over into the land of the living and to walk among the people of the earth now you say well brother Simon what has that got to do with me friends as a fact a literal fact no such a thing really exists as the dead coming out of the graves and coming back to walk and to live among us and move around for that one night upon the face of the earth well friends it's midnight it's midnight in America it's midnight in Canada and it's midnight all over the world spiritually it's midnight everywhere and gross darkness covers the land and covers the heart of the people certainly suffocating spiritual darkness as in Egypt is now upon us and it is spread everywhere now this is not a surprise to Christians to believers it is not a surprise because this was already prophesied by God's prophet of the 20th century William variant brain hand now these moves as you see represented behind me are simply uh something that at a time when he prophesied many many years before that something like this was going to happen and drew upon a wall this marvelous description of the seven churches moving from late in the days of fall right to our day of the Libyan church age a day of darkness and deception and death and this is the time we are living in it's midnight friends it's the midnight hour all over the world and he said also there will be a total blackout for God reflected this to us in the moon sea and these seventh changes of the moon with the last one going into total darkness speaks of our day when truth will be pushed out and spiritual darkness gross darkness darkness can be felt and sense will cover the land cover the earth and rest upon the people what time is it sirs it's midnight owl x clock is striking the hour Jesus will soon descend and yet people are living and walking in sin caring not that our Lord was crucified for them and died for their sins and is waiting with love as a great Shepherd for his children to come back home to him wherever you are let me sum the call let me sound the cry return while there is yet time to return come to him while there is yet time to come submit your life to him and he will change you by His divine power and make you into who he wants you to be there was the ending of this seventh church age of Letitia this age of spiritual darkness of sin sin has blinded the minds of men everywhere every nation of retirement of every language it's universal this virus this poison of sin has covered the hearts of men and women everywhere certainly we see a trans government's covered in darkness courts places of worship schools universities I tell you homes entire families taken over by the darkness flowing and swirling around everywhere like a dark and foggy night where none can see their way or see any light or truth anywhere suddenly the spiritual zombies are out the ghouls are out the ghosts are out the demons impersonating the souls of the so-called dead and Damned are now stalking the land we know according to the Gospel of Luke chapter 16 verse 19 to 31 a matter of fact let me read a few verses because Jesus tells a marvelous story of how there was a rich man and a beggar and let me continue and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torment and say Abraham afar off and see it Lazarus the beggar in his bosom and he cried and said father Abraham have mercy on me have mercy on me send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in this flame but Abraham said son remember thou in thy lifetime receiveth like good things and likewise Lazarus evil things and now he is comforted and thou art tormented and beside all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from this Oh friends I'll stop the reading right there that is enough so we understand it from the Word of God from the Lord Jesus himself telling about this saying clearly let no one none can return back to the land of the living after that they're dead so let no one deceive you let no one mislead you let no one listen for you distract you from the truth of the word of God therefore from this we know that these are evil demonic spirits that are impersonating the souls of the dead intent these are of the invisible armies of darkness unseen Devils that I here to kill to steal your joy your life your future and to destroy your entire existence in every possible way now these soul eaters and Body Snatchers earth and spiritual zombies are out because the darkness of the spiritual atmosphere invites them to activity here friends it's midnight it's midnight all over the world now you say well pastor Simon what what is a zombie now according to Google if you will look it up yourself you'll find it there a zombie is a walking corpse and the people who are living in sin are already spiritually dead or Daryl are you dying and rotten from the insulate out dead spiritually dead but physically they are convinced that they are living nothing but a wonderful life and that their life is good and everything is alright meanwhile they're rotten and the stench rises up in the nostrils of God ah their very nature on the inside compels them to send and sin and sin again but Jesus said speaking about the religious leaders of his day he said in Matthew 23 vs. 27 but you are like weddings if graves that appear beautiful on the outside but are full of uncleanness and dead men's bones on the inside you see the Pharisees the Sadducees the religious leaders of that day and at that time that were opposed to the word of the hour the Word made flesh was being opposed by religious leaders of that day and he said in appearance they were literally almost perfect and attractive by their dress their wear their walk their talk but really on the inside there was a stitch that not all the perfumes of Arabia could destroy there's that the rottenness to the core was from the inside coming to the outside yes and so is any religious person or any persons whatsoever that lives the way they did rejecting the Word of God for your day and for your hour you will also have that a good man a good woman a wonderful a church-going person perfection on the outside but on the inside rotten to the core ken was a zombie for he was a child of the evil one half man and half beast with no seat gene of God no soul of God in him in fact he had a soul that sins and the Bible tells us when you have a soul that sin the soul that sinneth it shall surely die according to ezekiel 18:4 and also verse 20 but thank God first John chapter 3 verse 9 says but the seed of God cannot see so that sins shall die not eternal but they are the gene of God that's in the other person is eternal it cannot sin and it cannot die no wonder jesus said he that liveth and believeth on me don't he were dead yet shall he also live for the scene of God first John says abideth in him all thanks be to God hallelujah all yes here we see the seeds of death and the seeds of life and the seed which shall not be heir with the shop now the people of North days for as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man when the son of man would be revealed again now the people at Mars day were of the kind of similar to Cain for their work mainly of his generation with that beast nature that would listen to the preaching of a god-sent prophet Noah who was a knower of the world and rejected his message for their day proving that they were Antichrist empty word and against their principles and teachings and warnings of the Word of God may God help us friends that we do not have a spirit like that but that we will cooperate we will submit and surrender and obey that precepts principles and teachings and warnings that comes from the Word of God so we see friends that all that were in the day of Noah that did not heed the Word of God their perish and all outside of the ark perished all outside of Christ will perish here we are all those without and gene a seed a life of God that was placed within them they all praised God will perish friends certainly we see also feral was nothing but a walking dead kora datum they were in that army of the Walking Dead the Pharisees and Sadducees in the days of Jesus they were in the army of the walking dead then we see Judas who inserted himself into Christianity and was right beside the Lord Jesus right there with his love of money and they witnessed desire that he had been in his heart oh my friends there he was but the Bible tells us clearly that he was a son of the devil he was of that wicked one he was evil to his very core but outwardly he was very religious these spirits these evil demons they were also active in the days of Paul and Paul spoke of them and call them ravening wolves Jude described them as spots within over feasts these demonic powers make no mistake about it these demonic powers don't maybe appears like Angels of Light religious are in our midst again and we must be aware of it friends they are here today John the revelation gives a description in Revelation 9 of some of these frightening devils and spirits that are to be loosed upon the face something earth I tell you my friends it's a dark day we're living in and a frightening time but for the Christian it's a glorious and wonderful time because on one hand when there was darkness for the devil his demons and the dis followers there is light for the Christian and a believer for they can look up for the coming of the Lord joint 9 the coming of the Lord is here thanks be to God how happy we should be we also see the scriptures one beautiful song that says turns clock is striking the hour jesus will soon descend clad in the garments of power the reign of sin to end it is the rising of the Sun and when the Sun comes up it rains the darkness away the fog away all of the doubts your fears your your presumptions are driven away by the rising of the Sun oh praise be toward God we are so confident in him and happy in the Lord because we know we are more than conquerors through him that loved us and Satan's legions of the already damned and his armies of darkness made up of demons and humans are already defeated in the name of Jesus Christ by the blood of Jesus Christ and by the testimony of Jesus Christ yes it's midnight in America it's midnight in Canada it's midnight all over the world and spiritual darkness is everywhere whoa men right in the world for the world lines in a bed of worthiness and drunkenness it's midnight in God's church and I'm here blowing a trumpet in Zion the one God's people heaven or hell Christ or chaos judgment is at hand and heaven is near Oh make up your mind to live for the Lord and for him alone this is the hour when we must choose Hussein we are on yes the church living in worldliness comfortable like a frog in a kettle with the spirit of lukewarmness resting upon her while drinking from our cups a spiritual fornication do you who are watching is it nighttime in your life are you Mary existing are you walking in the dark are you a message believer and you just blindly following the message without the clear revelation of dust saith the Lord you do not have a clear revelation or a clear understanding of what God has done by sending a prophet and what he is doing now through the message of the Prophet which is for running the second coming of Jesus Christ o my brother my sister I ask you look up lift up your head and cry out to God and ask God for wisdom who gives liberally to anyone that will ask it God will give you revelation not from from book of theology not from a universe not by higher learning not by becoming some so-called trained counselor or becoming some great theologian that's just nonsense in the eyes of God for that's knowledge accrued by the five senses of man which is totally limited but I'm talking about youth talking to God and asking him lord help me to tap into your wisdom your knowledge your understanding and don't let me interpret your word but God come fill me and you be the interpreter of your own word I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ and surely God will hear you God will help you God will lift you up and like you dip the Bartimaeus the scales will fall from your eyes like he did to Paul the scales will fall from your eyes and you will be able to say oh I wish I could make all men see the what is this fellowship of this mystery Oh for Jesus will reveal himself to you personally by the opening of the Word of God for the hour yes friends wake up wake up out of your sleep get up as Paul said and rise and come to the light it's frightening ly dark very dark and it's at nighttime when demon powers become active whipped or without the light of the Moon witches wizards demon powers are always active when things become dark but hope thanks be to God we are not children of the darkness we are the children of light we walk in truth we walk in light but we must know the fact that when darkness the same spiritually or naturally it's when the evil demon power began to become active if at night said the Prophet when rats roaches snakes and all other creatures of the night that's the time when they begin to come out I want to notice friends it's usually at midnight or after midnight when all the crazies come out all the moonstruck come out when all the parties really begin to rock and the music begins to move and sound and the screams and cries of stupefying japanesse adulteries fornications perversions of all kind of which paul says they which do these things will not enter into the kingdom of God they will not do it one time the Prophet being in a hotel going to his room after meeting and down the hallway of the hotel runs a half-naked woman with her with a camera or glass of liquor in her hand half drunk and saying hey this is life and he couldn't help himself he turns there's no woman that is that life that is death and I say to you Tintin today that is death if you live that way that is death oh my friends it's this kind of a darkness that shows up at least office parties be honest with yourself man be honest think about it that's when the darkness sometimes shows up office parties Christmas parties champagne gatherings but remember in the midst of all that they live in sin or death will they appear to be a life successful rich or even appear to be physically healthy for she that liveth into the places of sin is dead once you live it my friends true Christian believers know that we are in a midst of a ferocious war we are here fighting against unseen powers of darkness operating in high places we wrestle not against flesh and blood but our fighters with spiritual wickedness everywhere my question to you is which side are you on are you with the horse of heaven are new with the Lord's army are you with God's salvation army are you with the armies of light let by Michael the Archangel under the power of the Holy Spirit or are you with Satan and his viral parasitic evil army of Darkness Oh God lives in his army that is why it cannot be defeated for he is the mighty Conqueror who has ripped the veil into God empowers his army by his presence of living in them and they walk as children of the light but Satan also lives in his Ernie he possesses them and he walks and lives anoints and inspires the Living Dead who are alive physically but dead spiritually oh my friends get away from that I want you to know my friends right now that when you live like that you qualify as a member of that army as a soldier in that evil Legion of darkness that you are a member of however your situation is not hopeless for Jesus proves that he has the power over life in this he challenged Satan by saying even if you destroy this body in three days I'll raise it up again he also proved it at the grave of Lazarus Lazarus who was dead and Jesus came it appears as if he was late but he Jesus Christ the God is never late even though it seems like he's delaying and he maybe hasn't answered your prayer just yet just wait upon the Lord because Jesus keeps all of his appointments and so he came on the scene and one of the sister said Lord if you had been here my brother would not have died and you know Jesus felt sad the scripture says he wept he says you know he live again they said yes Lord we know in the resurrection in a nice way he was correcting and he said but you don't understand the resurrection is not a time it's not some event only that's maybe coming up the road I am the resurrection I am the personification of the resurrection I am the life that's all in me and he says take me to where they laid him they took him to the tomb of Lazarus I can see the crowds with the Pharisees his detractors his critics all crowding about dances now he's gone too far now we really got him and he stands there this man's dead for four days and he's asking that to roll back the storm all my friends I tell you if the stone of doubt and fear and darkness and happens can roll away from you today I'll tell you you'll walk out of your path you'll walk out of that all night and you'll walk into a new one in the name of Jesus Christ and the Bible further tells us the Rope they get rolled back the stone but not wittingly they said Lord why should be ruling that he's thicket and of course your life will stink if you're living in sin your life will have a rotten seated order to it if you are living and existing and walking in the darkness of sin but thanks be to God he is the mighty Conqueror he is Lord and so he said throw back the stone and then the Bible says he lifted up his voice and he says Lazarus come forth and the Bible tells us Lazarus came for wrapped in his grave clothes and Jesus said lose him and let him go no matter what happens no matter what conditions or situations may hold you bound Jesus Christ is saying to you today lose him Satan let him go Satan let her go let them go if thou canst believe all things are possible to them that will believe the Word of God far away where the soul of Lazarus might have been traveling he who the cart of the time heard the voice of the Lord over life and death calling him Lazarus come forth that same voice is coming to you come out of your darkness come out of your dirt come out of your filth come out of your sin come out of your mistaken this place raka ideas and thoughts and presumptions and come to the city of the revelation of the Word of God that is speaking to you right now for that same Jesus Christ who has the power that could call for Lazarus from the grave it's calling to you now won't you come to him now friends I want you to come out from amongst the dead dead friends and associations of conditions that you might find yourself in and come to the light and find yourself in Jesus Christ there's a wonderful and beautiful song that you may know that says you raise me up so I can stand on mountains you raise me up to walk on stormy seas I am strong when I am on your shoulders you raise me up Lord - more than I could be may God raise you up may he raise you up and bring you out from whatever condition situation help position health condition whatever you may be in may he bring you out today and give you a new lease of life so that you can rebound from your setback and have a supernatural spiritual comeback by the presence of the Living God may God bless you this wonderful Sunday morning and may His Holy Spirit anoint you let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father even as we stand here they're praying may we ask for the forgiveness of our sins we ask for the cleansing of our hearts may we Lord Jesus become new creatures in Christ maybe have a new direction in life may we begin to find a new sense of purpose Lord a balance in life as believers who the many who have followed this message may the Holy Spirit right the leaning ship that was about to sink and bring it back
