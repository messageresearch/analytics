[52:42] higher place
[52:43] &gt;&gt; with him in the cliff of the rock? Amen.
[52:46] That secret place with him this morning.
[52:48] I believe that if you've come expecting
[52:51] in that way, I believe that the Holy
[52:53] Spirit will take you right into that
[52:55] sacred place with him into the cliff of
[52:57] the rock will speak to you personal.
[53:00] Amen. That's what we desire when we come
[53:02] into the house of the Lord. We expect
[53:04] the Holy Spirit to come and speak to our
[53:07] hearts
[53:08] &gt;&gt; and to speak to our needs and to discern
[53:10] the things that are heavy upon us
[53:13] because we're human. We're living in
[53:15] this world. We're we're we're so uh um
[53:17] you know bound by the things of this
[53:20] life. Uh at times you know um time
[53:24] trying to control us and and the work
[53:27] and the efforts that we have to put
[53:29] forth every day to you know to keep food
[53:32] on the table to keep relationships
[53:34] together the pressures of life. Well
[53:37] guess what this morning you can come
[53:39] into his presence.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; You can release it all to him. He can
[53:43] speak to those situations and you can be
[53:46] set free. God bless you musicians. Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; We certainly appreciate
[53:51] &gt;&gt; the worship this morning.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Um I want to welcome
[53:56] all the visitors. Welcome everybody into
[53:58] the house of the Lord this morning. We
[54:01] certainly appreciate um everybody. We
[54:03] appreciate our former pastor John Simon
[54:06] who's with us. Um, you know, he's a real
[54:09] strength and an encouragement to me and
[54:12] to this ministry and to all of you, I
[54:14] know. Amen. And so, we certainly
[54:17] appreciate um his uh his encouragement.
[54:21] Amen. Praise God. Because um you know uh
[54:25] we are here as his uh you know, converts
[54:29] and his offspring, you know. Um, we were
[54:33] having some fellowship the other day and
[54:34] he was just saying how proud he is to
[54:37] see that, you know, that that he's he's
[54:39] seeing the the fruits of of his ministry
[54:43] over the many years where he had to, you
[54:45] know, just kind of um just continue to
[54:48] just bring the word and to put aside all
[54:51] the distractions that were going on even
[54:54] around the message of the hour, you
[54:56] know, all the distractions. He's so
[54:58] grateful that the Holy Spirit just led
[54:59] him to stay with the word and and now
[55:02] the effects of that have come upon us
[55:05] because we're just loving the word.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; We just want to hear the word. We just
[55:11] want to feed on the word.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; That's what caught our attention. Amen.
[55:14] It's the word. It's him. It's the person
[55:17] of God. It's the, you know, this is what
[55:19] we're going to be looking at today. This
[55:21] is what has set us a flame. If your
[55:24] experience didn't start that way where
[55:27] you actually met him, the person of of
[55:30] the Holy Ghost, then then you're you're
[55:33] still in progress. Then you're you're
[55:34] still you're going to find yourself uh
[55:36] you know in a place where you're still
[55:38] you know at times in a state of
[55:40] confusion and and so forth. So praise
[55:43] God. Let's um I bring greetings from
[55:45] brother Chris and Sister Farerita in in
[55:48] Trinidad. They they reached out and
[55:49] said, "Please send our our greetings to
[55:51] the saints." So, I'm doing that and I
[55:53] I'm thankful for the service we had here
[55:55] on Wednesday night. How many enjoyed
[55:56] that with brother Daniel Pasos? Amen.
[55:59] Praise God. Very simple uh you know
[56:02] anointing of the Holy Spirit to come and
[56:05] speak to his children in such a simple
[56:07] way. And I love that because God is
[56:10] hidden in that simplicity.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Don't ever be looking for great things.
[56:15] Just be looking for the great God. Amen.
[56:18] To speak to your needs. Amen. Praise
[56:20] God. So this morning we're going to
[56:22] continue
[56:24] um where we uh sort of well we we left
[56:27] off last week with um you know we've
[56:29] been on a series here on the purpose of
[56:30] God. Amen. You can go to the next slide.
[56:33] And um you know uh today we want to look
[56:36] at you know a little bit more
[56:37] specifically the purpose of the Holy
[56:39] Ghost. Amen. And we just want to over
[56:41] these next couple services we want to
[56:44] dig. We want to we want to understand we
[56:46] want to break out of the confusion
[56:49] that's that's moving around the message
[56:52] of the hour and even out there in the
[56:54] world in in the in the Christian world
[56:56] because there's just so much you know um
[56:59] chaos and confusion about what the Holy
[57:03] Ghost really is and what the purpose of
[57:05] the Holy Ghost is and and people just
[57:09] don't know. You can go and ask, you
[57:11] know, five different people and you'll
[57:14] get five different interpretations of
[57:16] what they think the Holy Ghost is. But
[57:18] let's just see what the Holy Spirit
[57:20] gives us today so that we can, you know,
[57:23] trust that that we can walk out with
[57:26] clarity of mind and know exactly where
[57:29] we stand as sons and daughters of God.
[57:32] Amen. Praise God. Let's go to our um
[57:34] before we go to the scripture, let's
[57:36] pray.
[57:37] Father, we've come this morning with one
[57:41] desire, Lord, and that is that that we
[57:44] could enter into your presence because
[57:47] we know you're here. We already know
[57:49] that. That's your promise. That's the
[57:52] word. We we we don't join because we
[57:55] belong to some organization. We don't
[57:58] come into the into the uh church of God,
[58:01] into the house of the Lord. It's just a
[58:03] a church building. We come to assemble
[58:07] and gather around you, around your
[58:10] spirit, around your word. And Lord, that
[58:14] is what we are placing in front of the
[58:17] people this morning. Lord, take away the
[58:20] me, the self, the individual. Lord, take
[58:24] away all the and then on the people.
[58:27] take away all the the the scars and and
[58:30] and the perceptions and the insecurities
[58:34] of the people, Lord, because Lord, many
[58:37] of us come into your presence. And Lord,
[58:39] we we just don't know how to approach
[58:41] you sometimes. But Lord, uh this
[58:44] morning, may we approach you with what
[58:45] with one thing, a pure heart, Lord. A
[58:48] pure heart, Lord, to that that that we
[58:51] would see you, Lord. Blessed are the
[58:53] pure in heart. They shall see God, Lord.
[58:56] This is our desire this morning, Lord.
[58:59] That your word would become alive. That
[59:01] it would become real to each individual
[59:04] heart, Lord. So that we can leave here
[59:07] different than the way we came, Lord.
[59:09] That we can go out, Lord, and and have a
[59:11] confidence in this relationship that we
[59:14] have with you, Lord. Not with an
[59:17] association that God sent a prophet and
[59:20] and that and that that the you know that
[59:22] that mysteries have been revealed. Lord,
[59:24] all those things are a result of an
[59:28] experience and a walk with you, Lord.
[59:30] That those things become real, become a
[59:33] reality, become an experience, Father,
[59:36] uh in a in in the word, an experience in
[59:39] the word, not in just an anointing or an
[59:42] emotion or an atmosphere, but something
[59:45] that that is the word in us. Lord, you
[59:49] said that would be our hope that that
[59:51] that it would be your spirit in us, our
[59:55] hope of glory. And so, Lord, let that
[59:57] become more reality as we minister your
[1:00:00] word. Lord, minister to the hearts.
[1:00:02] Lord, take control. I surrender solely
[1:00:06] and completely unto you now in the name
[1:00:10] of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Praise
[1:00:13] God. Let's read. Let's read our
[1:00:15] scripture.
[1:00:16] Amen. 1 Corinthians chapter 12.
[1:00:20] Now concerning spiritual gifts,
[1:00:22] brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
[1:00:26] You know that ye were Gentiles carried
[1:00:29] away unto these dumb idols, even as ye
[1:00:32] were led. Wherefore I give you to
[1:00:36] understand that no man speaking by the
[1:00:39] spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed and
[1:00:43] that no man can say that Jesus is the
[1:00:46] Lord but by the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Now there are diversities of gifts but
[1:00:52] the same spirit. And there are
[1:00:55] differences of administration but the
[1:00:58] same Lord. And there are diversities of
[1:01:02] operations, but it is the same God which
[1:01:06] workketh all.
[1:01:09] Did he say some things?
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; All
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; in all.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; All in all, we need to first understand
[1:01:24] that God is God.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; And that he is the word. that in the
[1:01:29] beginning, before there was even a word,
[1:01:32] he was the self-existent one. He was the
[1:01:35] allencompassing
[1:01:36] spirit of the universe, of eternities,
[1:01:40] of dimensions, of everything that we
[1:01:43] could possibly imagine. He was the
[1:01:47] self-existent one. And there's nothing
[1:01:50] that exists that that would
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; even potentially exist that was not and
[1:01:56] does not exist by him.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. But God
[1:02:04] had something that he wanted to express.
[1:02:07] And when he and when the word when he
[1:02:09] said let there be light, there was a
[1:02:12] word light that was that came into
[1:02:15] manifestation.
[1:02:16] And that's when we we could see the
[1:02:19] manifestation of God by the word that he
[1:02:22] spoke. That's what that's what the logus
[1:02:24] is. It is the word that comes forth from
[1:02:27] God and that creates all things that
[1:02:30] exists in all things. The worlds were
[1:02:33] framed by the logos, by the word of God.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so,
[1:02:42] um, I want to read a quote here from
[1:02:43] brother Brandham. He says here in the
[1:02:47] five identifications of the true church
[1:02:50] of the living God in 1960 he says you
[1:02:54] say well brother Brandham I believe.
[1:02:58] Well listen and I've never received the
[1:03:01] Holy Ghost.
[1:03:03] No you don't believe yet.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; He says you are just believing unto
[1:03:11] belief.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; You have hope.
[1:03:14] That's why, you know, people people talk
[1:03:17] about God, people talk about who he is,
[1:03:20] but really, you can go out there and I
[1:03:22] guarantee you that 95% of the people
[1:03:26] that you speak to on who is God, you're
[1:03:29] going to get 95 different answers.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; You're going to get all kinds of
[1:03:33] different interpretations. But here,
[1:03:36] here, Brother Brandham is saying, "Have
[1:03:38] you received God?" The Holy Ghost is
[1:03:40] God. It's the spirit of God. And then he
[1:03:43] goes out and he goes on to read, you
[1:03:45] know, 1 Corinthians chapter 12, which we
[1:03:47] just read, but I'm going to skip that.
[1:03:49] And he says, he goes on and he says,
[1:03:51] "You don't know nothing about it until
[1:03:54] you've received the Holy Ghost."
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; You don't know nothing about God.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you You know, listen,
[1:04:01] today we're going to listen, we're going
[1:04:02] to say some things today that is going
[1:04:04] to that that's going to challenge a lot
[1:04:06] of people,
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; whether you're in the house of the Lord
[1:04:09] or you're online. Uh listen, I love it.
[1:04:12] I want to be challenged. I want to know
[1:04:14] what I believe. I want to know where I'm
[1:04:17] standing. Amen. I want to know that God
[1:04:19] is God and that I'm having a real
[1:04:21] experience. I'm not having some church
[1:04:24] membership. Not interested in church
[1:04:27] membership. We're way down the road,
[1:04:28] saints.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; This is not about church membership.
[1:04:32] This is about being the church of the
[1:04:34] living God, the body of Jesus Christ
[1:04:37] that the Bible talks about. Amen. He
[1:04:40] says, "You say I accept Jesus Christ as
[1:04:42] my personal savior. Have you received
[1:04:45] the Holy Ghost since you believed?"
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I love that. I loved it when
[1:04:51] Pastor Simon, you know, he he he tells
[1:04:54] many times, you know, how how he came
[1:04:56] into that revelation at a very young uh,
[1:04:59] you know, early stage of his walk with
[1:05:01] the Lord where where the Holy Spirit
[1:05:03] showed him that, hey, you need to
[1:05:05] receive the Holy Ghost even if you think
[1:05:07] you're in the message. Amen.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; There's something here that's going on
[1:05:11] that that's beyond what you think is the
[1:05:14] is the is the culture of the message.
[1:05:16] Amen. Praise God. And so here, brother
[1:05:18] Brandham says it and he says, "If you
[1:05:21] don't, you can't even call him the
[1:05:23] Lord."
[1:05:25] Imagine that. You can't even call him
[1:05:27] your Lord. You want him to do things in
[1:05:30] your life. You want to You want to see
[1:05:32] God move. You want to see things change.
[1:05:35] You want to see healing in your life.
[1:05:36] And yet if you haven't received the Holy
[1:05:39] Ghost,
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; you can't even call him Lord when you
[1:05:41] pray. You can't even call him Lord.
[1:05:43] That's why many are going to come to him
[1:05:45] on that day and say, "Lord, Lord,
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; have I not cast out devils? Have I not
[1:05:49] prayed for the sick? Have I not spoke in
[1:05:51] tongues? Have I not?" He says, "I never
[1:05:53] knew you."
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Imagine that statement coming out of the
[1:05:57] Lord. I never knew you. Depart from me,
[1:06:00] ye workers of iniquity.
[1:06:04] Knowing what is true. That's why there's
[1:06:06] a lot of churches out there, but they're
[1:06:08] afraid of this.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; They're afraid of the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; That's why when when when when you get
[1:06:13] into things like this, it starts to stir
[1:06:15] the pot a little bit and people start to
[1:06:17] get a little bit uncomfortable. So, if I
[1:06:19] see you starting to squirm in your
[1:06:20] seats, it's okay.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; That's all right. Let the Holy Spirit
[1:06:24] have his way in your life. Amen. Let him
[1:06:26] change. Let him transform your thoughts.
[1:06:28] Let him bring his nature into you. He
[1:06:30] says, listen, he goes on. He says you
[1:06:32] can't even call because he's not Lord.
[1:06:35] He's an historical being that you now he
[1:06:38] even says it by faith have accepted.
[1:06:43] So here now we can see that somebody can
[1:06:47] actually accept Jesus Christ and not
[1:06:52] have him.
[1:06:54] They can they can say, "Oh, you know, a
[1:06:57] lot of times you come to this church,
[1:07:00] just come here. Come to the altar. Now
[1:07:02] repeat after me and confess it with your
[1:07:05] mouth, that Jesus is your Lord,
[1:07:09] and you can leave now and everything's
[1:07:11] good. You're saved. All is well. Praise
[1:07:14] God." Everybody clap their hands. Glory
[1:07:16] to God. Amen. That's not it.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; No sir. He says by faith have accept but
[1:07:22] when he comes into you
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost he is your Lord.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Now he now he comes into you now he is
[1:07:32] your Lord. And no man can call Jesus
[1:07:36] Lord only by the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:39] So until you are born of the spirit of
[1:07:43] God and the Holy Spirit is in you, then
[1:07:47] if you are, you're born into this
[1:07:50] kingdom and you're part of the church,
[1:07:53] you're the called out ones, then see you
[1:07:57] see it. All right. Now, praise God.
[1:08:00] Amen. Glory to God. And so here, let's
[1:08:02] go to the next slide. our scripture
[1:08:04] here. He says, now in John chapter 14
[1:08:08] verse 26,
[1:08:12] he says here, but the comforter,
[1:08:15] now this is Jesus speaking, okay? So
[1:08:18] he's telling us, he's telling us about
[1:08:21] the Holy Ghost. But the comforter, which
[1:08:24] is the Holy Ghost,
[1:08:26] whom the Father will send in my name,
[1:08:30] he shall teach you all things and bring
[1:08:33] all things to your remembrance,
[1:08:36] whatsoever I have said unto you. So here
[1:08:41] Jesus now, he's making it clear. Now, a
[1:08:44] lot of the people out there, they read
[1:08:46] this scripture and they say, "See,
[1:08:48] there's the Trinity. There it is right
[1:08:50] there. Jesus is saying that that the
[1:08:53] comforter is the Holy Ghost which the
[1:08:56] Father will send in my name
[1:08:59] and he shall teach you all things. And
[1:09:02] so right away if you don't have a
[1:09:05] revelation on who God is, you're going
[1:09:08] to look at that and you're going to see
[1:09:10] the Trinity.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; And you see, we know that that is false.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; There is no such thing as a Trinity.
[1:09:20] That's why we're going to be digging
[1:09:22] deep here. We're going to be looking in
[1:09:24] to see how the Holy Spirit unveils
[1:09:26] himself and makes himself personal to
[1:09:30] you so that when you read things like
[1:09:33] this, you understand your absolute. You
[1:09:36] understand where you stand.
[1:09:39] Next scripture, John 15 26 and 27. And
[1:09:43] he says, "But when the comforter is
[1:09:45] come, whom I will send unto you from the
[1:09:48] Father, even the Spirit of truth which
[1:09:51] proceedth from the Father, he shall
[1:09:54] testify of me, and ye shall also bear
[1:09:58] witness, and ye that because ye have
[1:10:02] been with me from the beginning."
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Now, what's Jesus talking about there?
[1:10:07] See, a lot of people will read that
[1:10:09] scripture and they will look at that and
[1:10:11] they'll say, "See, there's the
[1:10:12] comforter. Jesus saying God's going to
[1:10:15] send the comforter whom I will send whom
[1:10:18] I will send unto you from the father."
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; But he said I
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; But he said I. Yeah. So, so what what is
[1:10:27] is there some confusion here? Yeah. You
[1:10:29] know, a lot of people they get confused
[1:10:31] by that. That's why, you know, you dig
[1:10:33] into things like this, right away it
[1:10:35] starts to, you know, cause people to
[1:10:36] squirm because they don't want to dig
[1:10:39] deep. They don't want to allow the Holy
[1:10:40] Spirit to deal with their lives to get
[1:10:44] out all the stuff that they need to
[1:10:46] repent of and move out of their lives,
[1:10:49] all the teachings that they've had
[1:10:50] growing up, all the the the theological
[1:10:54] background and and and traditions of man
[1:10:57] and all those things. They get so
[1:10:59] challenged by things like that. But here
[1:11:02] he's saying whom I will send unto you.
[1:11:04] But in the last scripture he says but
[1:11:06] the father whom the father will send in
[1:11:08] my name. And now he's saying whom I will
[1:11:11] send unto you from the father.
[1:11:14] You see you got to know that that that
[1:11:17] god before he was even father he was
[1:11:22] god.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he was expressing himself in
[1:11:26] manifestations and in
[1:11:29] dispensations.
[1:11:31] This is what we're going to be seeing
[1:11:32] here as we go deeper into the purpose of
[1:11:35] the Holy Ghost. We want to know what it
[1:11:38] is and what it's supposed to produce in
[1:11:40] our lives. So here now we we can see
[1:11:43] here and ye shall bear witness because
[1:11:47] you have been with me from the
[1:11:49] beginning. Which beginning? What it was?
[1:11:52] those disciples that that had just
[1:11:54] started with him on that day.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; No. He says, "Father, show them that
[1:12:01] that that that you have been with me
[1:12:03] from before the foundations of the
[1:12:05] world. Show them that that they were
[1:12:07] that they are that they are mine. Show
[1:12:09] them that all that the that the Father
[1:12:11] hath given me will come. Show them my
[1:12:15] Let them hear my voice." Well, if they
[1:12:18] hear my voice, that means that that that
[1:12:20] that they're my sheep. Let them know
[1:12:22] that they are one as we are one.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Let them know that they are a part of
[1:12:27] me. Amen. This is what we're interested
[1:12:29] in understanding. But here, let's look
[1:12:32] at, you know, some of the common
[1:12:34] teachings of what is the Holy Spirit?
[1:12:37] You know, I did some research on the
[1:12:39] internet and over here it says the very
[1:12:41] first thing that they described when I
[1:12:44] put in the question was this. The Holy
[1:12:46] Spirit is the third person of the
[1:12:49] Godhead.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; The very first statement,
[1:12:54] the third person, three people in one.
[1:12:59] We know that's absolute nonsense.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; That's confusion.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; There's no sense to that. If you've seen
[1:13:07] me, Jesus said, you've seen the Father,
[1:13:09] Phillip. Amen.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; He It's not I that doeth the works, but
[1:13:14] the father which dwelleth in me? Who was
[1:13:16] the father? It was the Holy Spirit.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; So who who was it that came to Mary? Was
[1:13:21] it the Holy Ghost or was it or was it so
[1:13:25] so did did did uh did Mary have two
[1:13:27] fathers? Because one was of the father
[1:13:30] and the other one was of the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:33] So which one was it? You see? Well,
[1:13:36] unless you've got an absolute, and
[1:13:38] that's the first thing you've got to
[1:13:39] come to a place to understand that you
[1:13:42] must know who God is, that there is no
[1:13:44] other God beside him, that he is the one
[1:13:48] and only, there is only one Lord, thy
[1:13:50] God is one. Amen. Until that is a
[1:13:53] reality in your life, you're going to be
[1:13:54] confused.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; I don't care how long you've been in
[1:13:57] this message.
[1:13:59] I don't care how long you think you've
[1:14:01] understood. You're going to be
[1:14:03] challenged today. you're going to be
[1:14:05] looking a little bit deeper into the
[1:14:07] purpose of God. Amen. That's what that's
[1:14:09] what we're doing. And so he now he they
[1:14:12] go on to say he equally with the father
[1:14:14] and the son is God.
[1:14:18] As the Nyian uh you know constipalopian
[1:14:21] creed of AD 3:21 says he is the lord and
[1:14:25] giver of life who proceeds from the
[1:14:28] father and the son who with the father
[1:14:32] and the son together worshiped and
[1:14:34] glorified who spoke by the prophets. He
[1:14:38] is the spirit that is he is immaterial
[1:14:42] and he is holy that is to be set apart
[1:14:46] and without sin. We also knowing the
[1:14:49] following about the Holy Spirit.
[1:14:52] He goes on and it talks about the Holy
[1:14:54] Spirit is personal and scripture
[1:14:57] presents the Holy Spirit as a divine
[1:14:59] person. He is a divine person. You see,
[1:15:03] if you're reading this by revelation and
[1:15:05] you've got a revelation of who he is,
[1:15:08] this makes perfect sense because you've
[1:15:10] got a revelation of who they're talking
[1:15:12] about. But without revelation, with the
[1:15:16] teachings of man,
[1:15:18] an unrepented individual
[1:15:21] will hold to those teachings as a
[1:15:24] stubborn individual that will not allow
[1:15:27] the Holy Spirit to even begin the
[1:15:30] process of bringing him to a place where
[1:15:34] he can indwell.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so he thinks and knows
[1:15:41] Corinthians chapter 2:10. He can be
[1:15:44] grieved in in Ephesians 4:30. He
[1:15:46] intercedes in Romans 8:26. Makes
[1:15:49] decisions according to his will in 1
[1:15:52] Corinthians 12:7-11. And comforts and
[1:15:55] counselss in John 14. The spirit
[1:15:58] appoints specific people to specific
[1:16:01] tasks in like Acts chapter 13 and
[1:16:04] chapter 20. The Holy Spirit is divine.
[1:16:08] They go to say the fact that the Holy
[1:16:09] Spirit is God is clearly seen in many
[1:16:12] passages of scripture. In Acts 5 chapter
[1:16:16] uh chapter 5:es 3 and 4, Peter confronts
[1:16:19] Ananas as to why he lied to the Holy
[1:16:22] Spirit, you know, because now the Holy
[1:16:24] Spir he's he's a he's an enforcer. Amen.
[1:16:28] tells him that he that he had that that
[1:16:30] that he that that he had lied and and
[1:16:33] that you cannot lie to the Holy Spirit.
[1:16:35] You can't lie to God. That's true. God
[1:16:38] knows every one of you. God knows every
[1:16:41] situation that you're dealing with right
[1:16:43] now. Amen. And further, the Holy Spirit
[1:16:45] possesses the characteristics of God in
[1:16:48] that he is omnipresent. Amen. Where can
[1:16:51] I go from that from your spirit? Where
[1:16:53] can I flee from your presence? If I go
[1:16:55] to to the heavens, you are there. If I
[1:16:57] make my bed in the depths, you are
[1:16:59] there. Amen. Psalms 1:39. He's
[1:17:02] omniscient. Amen. He is eternal. Hebrews
[1:17:06] 9:14. And the spirit does things that
[1:17:08] only God can do, such as create, inspire
[1:17:13] scripture, and reveal the deep things of
[1:17:16] God. 1 Corinthians chapter 2. Amen.
[1:17:19] Praise God. These are the attributes of
[1:17:22] the spirit of God. These are the
[1:17:24] elements of the Holy Spirit that that
[1:17:26] you that you take for granted sometimes.
[1:17:29] You don't realize, you know, the depths
[1:17:33] of the Holy Ghost that you've that
[1:17:34] you've that you've entered into a
[1:17:36] relationship, the depths of this
[1:17:38] relationship and how powerful it is.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; It is it is the power to to overcome
[1:17:47] anything that comes your way. Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; When you've received it and and you've
[1:17:52] got a revelation of it and that you know
[1:17:55] that he is in you. Amen. Where can I go?
[1:17:58] Glory to God. The Holy Spirit is as much
[1:18:01] God as the father and the son. It says
[1:18:04] as seen in the great commission. Jesus
[1:18:06] said that believers are to be baptized
[1:18:08] in the name of the father and of the son
[1:18:11] and of the holy spirit. All listen, they
[1:18:14] go on to say all three persons of the
[1:18:16] godhead are equal and share one name.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; You see it sounds very nice but but it
[1:18:25] absolutely makes no sense.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; It makes no sense because now which one
[1:18:32] do you fully surrender to?
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; You know which one do you fully
[1:18:39] surrender to? You see, because you're
[1:18:41] you're in your mind there's confusion
[1:18:44] and you're not seeing him in the way
[1:18:47] that you should be seeing him. Amen.
[1:18:49] Praise God. You know, it goes on to talk
[1:18:51] about how the Holy Spirit is active and
[1:18:54] you know, um that how the Holy Spirit's
[1:18:56] presence in your life as a believer is
[1:18:58] beyond consequence. He he permanently
[1:19:02] indwells in believers and seals them
[1:19:04] until the day of redemption. God doesn't
[1:19:07] seal everybody.
[1:19:09] Amen.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; God seals those that are that are from
[1:19:15] the foundations of the world in the
[1:19:18] Lamb's book of life whose names were
[1:19:22] written before the foundations of this
[1:19:24] world. Listen, if God is omniscient, if
[1:19:27] God is omniresent, if God knows all
[1:19:30] things, then he knows exactly who you
[1:19:33] are. He knows where you're seated right
[1:19:35] now. He knows your condition. He knows
[1:19:38] if there's any confusion in your mind
[1:19:41] about your experience with him. And if
[1:19:44] there's a desire in your heart to to to
[1:19:46] to have this confusion lifted, it's
[1:19:49] because there's something in you that's
[1:19:51] of God.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; There's something in you that desires to
[1:19:55] know truth and wants to be set free and
[1:19:58] liberated so that you can live for him.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. You know, it goes on
[1:20:05] and I'm not going to read all of it. You
[1:20:07] know the the Holy Spirit also gives
[1:20:09] believers wisdom by which to understand
[1:20:11] spiritual things. We know that the
[1:20:13] spirit of truth. That's the comforter.
[1:20:15] He'll guide you what? Into all truth.
[1:20:18] How can the Holy Spirit
[1:20:21] on the day of Pentecost?
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Filled the the the the disciples in the
[1:20:29] upper room, filled them with his
[1:20:31] presence. Come out under the anointing.
[1:20:33] and Peter under the anointing in Acts
[1:20:36] chap 2 verse 38 and people will say well
[1:20:40] you know Jesus said go ye into all the
[1:20:43] world baptizing them in the name
[1:20:47] I'm going to repeat that in the name
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; of the father and of the son and of the
[1:20:52] holy ghost. That name is no other name
[1:20:55] that man must be saved by but by the
[1:20:58] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:00] And Peter on the day of Pentecost,
[1:21:02] filled with the Holy Ghost. Okay? And
[1:21:05] now we just read here that the Holy
[1:21:07] Ghost is the comforter. He'll guide you
[1:21:09] into all truth. Now remember, Peter was
[1:21:12] the same one that denied the Lord
[1:21:15] on the night that he was being taken for
[1:21:18] the crucifixion. Three times he denied
[1:21:21] him,
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; but yet he didn't have the fullness of
[1:21:26] the Holy Ghost yet.
[1:21:29] He was under an anointing when when
[1:21:31] Jesus sent out the disciples. He sent
[1:21:33] them out. He says, "I give you power to
[1:21:36] cast out demons, to lay hands on the
[1:21:38] sick, to do all of these things." But
[1:21:41] the Holy Ghost was not given until after
[1:21:46] he was glorified.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to be looking at this
[1:21:49] a little deeper and see how it is that
[1:21:52] that so that we can better understand.
[1:21:55] Amen. the the the the true reality. And
[1:21:59] so Peter here on he goes repent. Now
[1:22:02] that's the first thing that he said.
[1:22:05] Imagine that
[1:22:08] people don't repent. People have not
[1:22:10] truly repented. They want the Holy
[1:22:13] Ghost, but they don't want to repent.
[1:22:16] They think that they need the Holy Ghost
[1:22:19] in order to repent. People have it all
[1:22:21] confused. Oh, brother, if I get the Holy
[1:22:23] Ghost, then then I can overcome
[1:22:25] anything.
[1:22:27] No, no, no, no, no. That's not what he
[1:22:28] said. He said, "Repent, every one of
[1:22:31] you, be baptized in water in the name of
[1:22:36] the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall
[1:22:40] receive the Holy Ghost."
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; So, there's a process there of repent,
[1:22:46] baptism, receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; That doesn't change, saints. Praise God.
[1:22:52] Remember, listen, I don't want you to be
[1:22:54] confused by by you, you know, because we
[1:22:56] all know, you know, we're down the road.
[1:22:58] We know that there's an attribute of God
[1:23:00] in us that was placed in us before the
[1:23:03] foundations of the world.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; But let me say that if that attribute is
[1:23:07] there, it will not alter the word of
[1:23:10] God.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; It will not variate from the word of
[1:23:13] God.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; It will come under submission to the
[1:23:16] word of God and it will bring into
[1:23:19] manifestation
[1:23:21] exactly what the word said.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; That's how you know that somebody has
[1:23:26] truly repented because they come
[1:23:28] according to the word.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; They there's no way they'll deny the
[1:23:33] word of God. Amen. Praise God. Let's go
[1:23:35] on here. So, the Holy Spirit is
[1:23:38] personal. We can know him, fellowship
[1:23:40] with him because he's divine. We can
[1:23:43] worship and obey him because he is
[1:23:45] active. We can rely on his perfect work
[1:23:48] in our lives.
[1:23:50] but only when we've truly received him.
[1:23:55] Amen.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Go to the next slide.
[1:24:00] Now, last week I mentioned to you, if
[1:24:03] you've got time, go back, read or listen
[1:24:06] to the message, what is the Holy Ghost?
[1:24:09] Because I'll tell you, a lot of my notes
[1:24:11] and a lot of quotes are coming right out
[1:24:14] of that message from 1959.
[1:24:17] I went back and listened to that a
[1:24:19] couple of times and I'm just I'm just
[1:24:21] rejoicing.
[1:24:22] I'm rejoicing. There's so much in there
[1:24:26] that that the Holy Remember, the Holy
[1:24:28] Spirit will bring light
[1:24:32] in the particular season that you're in
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; so that you can recognize the word for
[1:24:40] your day.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; He puts light on his word. Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; He He makes it live. Amen. A lot of
[1:24:49] people see they they've they've taken
[1:24:52] this what I'm saying right now. I went
[1:24:54] back and listened to the to the message.
[1:24:56] I listen to the tapes.
[1:24:58] I listen to them. I listen to them every
[1:25:01] single day.
[1:25:03] But I'm feeding on the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not feeding on a man.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; I'm feeding on the Holy Ghost. I'm
[1:25:12] feeding on the revealed word. the the
[1:25:15] actually the part of the word that's not
[1:25:17] even written.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; This is the this is the ministry that
[1:25:21] we're actually under right now. But I
[1:25:23] don't want to go too far down the road
[1:25:24] here,
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; but this is the element that we are
[1:25:27] under.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; We're not feeding on on man. We're not
[1:25:30] feeding on written word. We're not
[1:25:33] feeding on scripture.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Everybody's feeding on scripture, but
[1:25:37] but the spirit gives it life.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about here. We
[1:25:42] want the Holy Ghost to give us the right
[1:25:44] interpretation on the word of God so
[1:25:46] that we can have a real experience with
[1:25:48] God.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; So that when we lay hands on the sick,
[1:25:51] we've got a revelation of what we're
[1:25:54] doing. It's not just some tradition.
[1:25:56] James says, "Anoint them with oil. They
[1:25:59] shall be forgiven of their sin." Period.
[1:26:01] Even if they're unrepented, they come in
[1:26:03] the into the presence of God. Come on.
[1:26:06] We're not we're not this is not some
[1:26:09] some uh you know some assembly line that
[1:26:12] has a you know uh the end result is
[1:26:14] going to produce this.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; This is God.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; This is the reality of God. This is what
[1:26:21] the Holy Ghost there's a purpose in the
[1:26:23] Holy Ghost. We need to understand that
[1:26:25] purpose so that we can have the right
[1:26:27] relationship not just with God but even
[1:26:30] with one another.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Because I I can show you the scripture
[1:26:33] that says when you've been endued with
[1:26:36] power
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost, go and strengthen
[1:26:39] your brethren.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; How am I going to strengthen you if I
[1:26:42] ain't got the Holy Ghost?
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; How am I going to do anything to help
[1:26:46] you if I don't have a true experience
[1:26:49] with the Holy Ghost and the word of God
[1:26:51] for this hour?
[1:26:53] I can't help anybody out there.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; I can't strengthen my brother because
[1:26:57] the strength doesn't come from me.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; It comes by the revelation that's on me.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; It comes by the power of his
[1:27:06] resurrection in our lives. Brother
[1:27:09] Glenn. Amen. Praise God. Amen.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; So here now listen what he says. upon
[1:27:14] this place
[1:27:16] we wish to approach the subject which I
[1:27:18] think is the outstanding subject of
[1:27:21] today. I think that you know what when I
[1:27:24] when I heard brother Brandham say that
[1:27:25] and I've heard you know other ministers
[1:27:27] you know quote this quote but when I
[1:27:29] heard it I you know and and and and it
[1:27:32] was because God knew that I was digging.
[1:27:35] Oh, God knows when you're digging.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. God knows when you're when you're
[1:27:39] you're sincere and you're saying Lord
[1:27:41] let me understand let me have
[1:27:44] understanding on your word Lord that
[1:27:46] that that you alone can give this kind
[1:27:48] of understanding when I seen this I said
[1:27:51] outstanding subject of today he said
[1:27:53] yeah today right now this is outstanding
[1:27:57] this is something that that people are
[1:27:59] confused he goes on and he says of of
[1:28:02] what is the Holy Spirit what is it and
[1:28:06] now the reason I've taken these subjects
[1:28:08] in line like this. You cannot come and
[1:28:11] receive the Holy Spirit unless you know
[1:28:13] what it is.
[1:28:15] Makes perfect sense. And you cannot
[1:28:19] receive it if you know what it is unless
[1:28:22] you believe it's given to you.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute here. That you mean? You
[1:28:31] mean I I need to know and believe that
[1:28:34] it's for me?
[1:28:36] Yeah, you need to understand who you are
[1:28:41] in the day that you're living in.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; You you need to understand your life.
[1:28:46] You're con you're your your your your
[1:28:47] brokenness.
[1:28:49] You need to understand why you've come
[1:28:52] to a place in your life where you are
[1:28:55] you you you just you've come so far and
[1:28:57] you're looking to go deeper. You're
[1:28:59] looking to go further with God, but you
[1:29:02] don't know how you're going to go any
[1:29:04] deeper. And then all of a sudden the
[1:29:07] Lord comes into your Now, now I'm not
[1:29:09] talking about going deeper with God at
[1:29:12] the stage of your life like I just
[1:29:14] looked back at my own life and I knew
[1:29:16] that my condition was was a broken
[1:29:19] condition. I was in a broken vessel. I
[1:29:23] was in a drugaddicted vessel. I was in a
[1:29:26] broken marriage. Our marriage was
[1:29:28] falling apart. I was in a broken uh you
[1:29:31] know in a broken condition even business
[1:29:34] from a business perspective. I was at a
[1:29:37] point in 1993
[1:29:39] where I was in in 1991 where I was ready
[1:29:43] to to just figure out exactly how to
[1:29:45] exit this life because of of the of the
[1:29:48] disaster that I was in the midst of when
[1:29:51] when the real estate crash came and I
[1:29:53] lost everything including the next 20
[1:29:57] years of my wages. That's how much I had
[1:29:59] lost.
[1:30:01] I said, "How can I how can this move on?
[1:30:02] How can this go on?" But then there came
[1:30:06] a a point where
[1:30:10] I knew I there was something that came
[1:30:14] into my path which was this message. And
[1:30:18] when it did, it was God himself. and he
[1:30:21] had come into the into the into the part
[1:30:23] of my life where I needed him the most,
[1:30:26] not knowing what I really needed.
[1:30:30] But then when the the this word, this
[1:30:33] reality,
[1:30:35] the spirit of God came and and dealt
[1:30:38] with my life in a way that that that I
[1:30:41] that nobody else could do it. I realized
[1:30:43] this was for me.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; This was what I was looking for all my
[1:30:49] life. Amen.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; I was looking for that perfect high. I
[1:30:53] was looking for that for the reason and
[1:30:55] the purpose of living. I was looking for
[1:30:57] that that next, you know, that that next
[1:31:00] uh way of of getting that next
[1:31:02] adrenaline shot, looking for that next,
[1:31:04] you know, thing to satisfy. You'll never
[1:31:07] find it. If you are a son or a daughter
[1:31:10] of God, and you always were,
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; you will come into contact with the Holy
[1:31:15] Ghost and you will be able to say that
[1:31:18] you believe it's given to you.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; It was for you.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; He knew you.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; He saw you. He saw you in the condition
[1:31:29] you were in. He saw you in that
[1:31:31] situation. He saw you when you took that
[1:31:34] blow, Brother Tim. He knew exactly what
[1:31:36] you would need. Your mind would have
[1:31:38] been shattered without his coming into
[1:31:41] your life and and intervening in but you
[1:31:44] knew that it was for you.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you need to know that
[1:31:49] this is something that that's for me.
[1:31:51] Amen. And then he goes on to say here he
[1:31:54] goes on to say here um uh uh and it's
[1:32:00] for you. And then you cannot know
[1:32:02] whether you've got it or not unless you
[1:32:06] know what results it brings.
[1:32:09] Amen. So if you know what it is and you
[1:32:12] and who it is and who it is to what
[1:32:17] action it brings when it comes, then
[1:32:19] you'll know what you've got when you get
[1:32:20] it.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Just
[1:32:25] that's just would settle it. He says,
[1:32:28] "Amen." Now, praise God. Brother Brandon
[1:32:30] preached these messages in 1959.
[1:32:33] He preached two nights in a row with um
[1:32:36] the first night, what is the Holy Ghost?
[1:32:38] The second night, what was the Holy
[1:32:40] Ghost given for? A couple of nights
[1:32:42] later, he does questions and answers on
[1:32:45] the Holy Ghost. Now it's important for
[1:32:47] us to understand that there is a
[1:32:51] difference between the spirit of God,
[1:32:55] the Holy Spirit, the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:58] Spirit or the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:02] and the Holy Ghost himself.
[1:33:06] We need to understand there is a
[1:33:09] difference. But yet, I'm going to tell
[1:33:11] you, it's all the same person.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. So, so
[1:33:19] don't want to bring any confusion, but I
[1:33:21] want to tell you there is a difference,
[1:33:22] but yet it's all him.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And as we move through
[1:33:28] these next few services, we're trusting
[1:33:30] that the Holy Ghost will reveal and
[1:33:32] bring clarity to us personally.
[1:33:36] Amen. To help us really understand what
[1:33:40] we have or don't have.
[1:33:43] have, don't have.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; You understand? Because
[1:33:49] we're just human beings. We're just
[1:33:51] walking this walk. We're trusting God
[1:33:55] every day of our lives. We know he's a
[1:33:58] reality, but yet we face situations
[1:34:00] every single day. The enemy fights. The
[1:34:05] enemy was fighting hard this morning for
[1:34:08] me to even get here, saints.
[1:34:11] It's a real It's a reality. I'm telling
[1:34:14] you. I don't I don't understand it
[1:34:16] sometimes. I I I just But but I say,
[1:34:19] "Lord, this has got to be, you know,
[1:34:22] this has got to be real because I don't
[1:34:25] understand why this pressure is on me.
[1:34:27] Why this this, you know, this uh uh this
[1:34:30] fight that that that's going on in the
[1:34:33] atmospheres, but you got to be still.
[1:34:36] You got to know that God is God. and you
[1:34:38] got to just move forward and that's it.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; If you listen I there's there's one
[1:34:42] thing I can tell you. I know God is God.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; And I know that God is is not some some
[1:34:49] uh you know some emotion that I got
[1:34:51] caught up into.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; I know where I'm standing with the Lord,
[1:34:55] but I also know that I got to fight an
[1:34:56] enemy every single day. So don't think
[1:34:59] that when you get the Holy Ghost that
[1:35:02] everything is just fine and everything
[1:35:03] is just wonderful and you can just go
[1:35:05] sit on your cloud and rejoice and sing
[1:35:07] songs all day long.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; You got to overcome.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; You got to fight.
[1:35:17] But if you But you know, as we go
[1:35:19] through this, I I'm I'm I'm trusting
[1:35:21] that you're going to understand some
[1:35:23] things that are available to you as a
[1:35:25] son or a daughter of God that will give
[1:35:28] you strength in a time when you need it.
[1:35:32] A supernatural strength that only comes
[1:35:34] by the Holy Spirit. Amen. By the Holy
[1:35:37] Ghost. Hallelujah. Praise God. And so,
[1:35:41] let's look at some things here. We want
[1:35:44] clarity. So, you know, I was challenged.
[1:35:48] You know, I've been studying. I've been
[1:35:49] listening to different messages,
[1:35:51] different ministers, and and as as a
[1:35:53] minister, that's what we do as a pastor
[1:35:57] of the church. I'm I'm I'm hungry for
[1:36:00] for what God wants to bring to his
[1:36:02] sheep.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; My my concern is for for the sheep. I
[1:36:06] just want, you know, I want something
[1:36:08] that's going to be a balanced diet
[1:36:09] that's going to give them strength,
[1:36:11] that's going to give them uh, you know,
[1:36:13] uh, encouragement, going to give them
[1:36:15] overcoming power and ability by by by
[1:36:18] understanding the word of God. Amen.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. You need to understand
[1:36:25] when Jesus was saying that that they may
[1:36:29] see
[1:36:30] what is the truth. He was the the word
[1:36:34] see if you actually look it up in the
[1:36:37] Greek it means understand
[1:36:39] that you may understand. There are
[1:36:41] things that you naturally need to
[1:36:43] understand in order to have a real full
[1:36:48] experience with the Holy Ghost. Yeah.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; So here now I want I want you to
[1:36:54] understand something here in the Old
[1:36:55] Testament. Okay? Spirit of God is
[1:36:58] mentioned 14 times in the Old Testament.
[1:37:02] I I went right into my concordance. I
[1:37:04] went in. I looked at every I counted
[1:37:05] every single one. I hear things. But
[1:37:08] then I go into the scripture. I want to
[1:37:09] I want to understand. I want to see it.
[1:37:12] I want to because then when I go into
[1:37:14] it, I see even more. And here now, the
[1:37:17] spirit of God is mentioned 14 times. In
[1:37:20] the New Testament, it's mentioned nine
[1:37:21] times. Spirit of God. Remember, we're
[1:37:25] talking about the one that was before he
[1:37:27] was even known to be anything. He was
[1:37:31] the self-existent one.
[1:37:35] So, he's the spirit of God. And that's
[1:37:38] how they knew him in the Old Testament
[1:37:40] up to a certain time.
[1:37:43] and then and and to certain prophets,
[1:37:46] kings and priests. But here now in the
[1:37:48] Old Testament, the Holy Spirit is
[1:37:50] mentioned three times, only three times.
[1:37:55] And I mean Holy Spirit together, not
[1:37:58] just the word holy. If you put holy,
[1:38:00] you'll catch it 600 times.
[1:38:03] But
[1:38:05] in the New Testament, it's mentioned
[1:38:07] four times.
[1:38:10] In the Old Testament, Holy Ghost is
[1:38:12] mentioned zero times.
[1:38:16] Zero. Not once is it mentioned in the
[1:38:19] Old Testament. In the New Testament,
[1:38:22] it's mentioned 89 times. Holy Ghost.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Now, do you think
[1:38:30] does everybody believe that all
[1:38:32] scripture is written by men that were
[1:38:35] moved by the Holy Ghost?
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. that were inspired by the Holy
[1:38:38] Spirit to write the things that they
[1:38:40] wrote. Do you think that God would give
[1:38:43] them confusion when he when where where
[1:38:45] in in the in the beginning from the book
[1:38:47] of Genesis right up until Exodus chapter
[1:38:51] uh
[1:38:53] six I'm not sure but I've got it here
[1:38:55] where where you know holy is first
[1:38:56] introduced where it was only known as
[1:38:59] spirit of God
[1:39:01] that the spirit of God brooded over that
[1:39:05] the spirit of God came that the spirit
[1:39:07] of God did all these things and then
[1:39:10] when they would when they would write
[1:39:12] Holy Spirit that they had that that they
[1:39:15] were just, oh, I'm just going to call it
[1:39:16] Holy Spirit now and then in the and then
[1:39:20] not even mention Holy Ghost at all in
[1:39:22] the Old Testament and then all of a
[1:39:23] sudden mention it 89 times in the New
[1:39:25] Testament.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Why why would he do that? Why why would
[1:39:28] the Holy Ghost Why would the spirit of
[1:39:32] God inspire these men to write in those
[1:39:35] ways and put those th write it exactly
[1:39:39] the way that that that he wanted him to
[1:39:41] write it? I'm going to say to you, it's
[1:39:43] because he had a different thought and
[1:39:46] manifestation
[1:39:48] behind the thought of when he mentioned
[1:39:50] Holy Spirit and when he mentioned Holy
[1:39:52] Ghost in the context of how he mentions
[1:39:55] it. That's why you need to go back and
[1:39:57] study these things. I've been studying
[1:40:00] these things. And when I go in there and
[1:40:02] you start to actually read the
[1:40:03] scriptures where he mentions Holy
[1:40:05] Spirit, then he mentions Holy Ghost, you
[1:40:08] you will see that there's a different
[1:40:10] context of what God is actually
[1:40:13] conveying in the thought behind the
[1:40:17] words Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost.
[1:40:19] There's a reason behind it. there's a
[1:40:23] there's a different manifestation of God
[1:40:25] that goes with the way that it's
[1:40:28] written.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Then we look at
[1:40:32] So, so remember the writers of the
[1:40:34] Bible, they're all catching the very
[1:40:36] thoughts and writing it exactly as they
[1:40:39] receive it. Amen. Moses received things.
[1:40:42] He saw it. He heard it. He wrote it.
[1:40:45] Amen. Praise God. But but what we're
[1:40:49] seeing here is that the the this is why
[1:40:51] it's so important to have the spirit of
[1:40:54] revelation in your life
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; because the spirit of revelation
[1:40:59] will immediately clear the confusion
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; of even the godhead.
[1:41:06] Even though you don't even need a
[1:41:07] revelation to know that God is one,
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; you don't need a revelation on that. I
[1:41:13] can show you scripture after scripture
[1:41:14] that says there is no God beside me,
[1:41:18] before me, nor shall there be one after
[1:41:20] me. I am the Lord thy God. I am one.
[1:41:24] Period.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; He never said, "I am two."
[1:41:28] It's just as simple as that. But yet,
[1:41:30] you need a revelation to understand when
[1:41:32] you're reading the scriptures and how it
[1:41:34] pertains to you in this day and in this
[1:41:37] hour because it pertains to your
[1:41:39] salvation. It pertains to your future.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; It pertains to you overcoming tomorrow
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; when you leave this place and you've got
[1:41:48] to deal with the things of this world
[1:41:50] and the situations that you're going to
[1:41:52] have to deal with as a human being.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:41:57] So, so the different So, what what is
[1:42:01] the difference then between Holy Spirit,
[1:42:04] Holy Ghost, baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[1:42:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost? It's the
[1:42:09] manifestations
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; under different dispensations of what
[1:42:15] God was manifesting himself in and
[1:42:18] through the people to bring his purpose,
[1:42:22] his word for that day to that particular
[1:42:25] people, nation, kingdom, king, whatever
[1:42:29] the situation was when the Holy Spirit
[1:42:32] would anoint back in the Old Testament.
[1:42:35] He was anointing them with the Holy
[1:42:38] Spirit. He was not
[1:42:42] embodying them
[1:42:44] in the holy with the Holy Spirit. He was
[1:42:47] anointing all the kings, the priests and
[1:42:51] the prophets. That's why you will not
[1:42:53] hear Holy Ghost in the Old Testament
[1:42:56] because Holy Ghost was the coming of the
[1:42:58] Lord where God himself now was going to
[1:43:01] come to the earth.
[1:43:03] Yes, he showed it in type when he came
[1:43:06] as Melzdc and and and met up with
[1:43:09] Abraham. Amen.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; He was Those are all types and shadows
[1:43:12] of what he's going to do and what he's
[1:43:14] doing right now.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the dispensation and the time
[1:43:20] whereby the Holy Ghost would possess you
[1:43:22] personal
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; was was left for this age,
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; for this time for the open book to be
[1:43:29] revealed so that we could understand
[1:43:32] what was written the the the the element
[1:43:35] that that brings you into a personal
[1:43:38] oneness with God to where you and God
[1:43:41] become one.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Not two, one.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So why is this the case? Why
[1:43:49] is there different manifestations? And
[1:43:51] what is the difference? The difference
[1:43:53] is the dispensations and manifestations
[1:43:55] of the spirit of God, Holy Spirit and
[1:43:58] Holy Ghost, yet all the same. But did
[1:44:01] you know that the word holy,
[1:44:04] and I just, you know, I just digging
[1:44:06] this up this morning, the word holy was
[1:44:09] only first introduced in Exodus 3:E 5
[1:44:13] with Moses when when the Lord called
[1:44:16] unto Moses to the burning bush and said,
[1:44:18] "Take off thy shoes, for this ground
[1:44:20] that you are now standing on is holy
[1:44:23] ground." God was changing a dispensation
[1:44:27] right there. God was now starting to put
[1:44:31] an eye on a certain people, on a certain
[1:44:35] group of individuals. God was now going
[1:44:38] to convey and manifest himself in a
[1:44:42] different dispensation, the the
[1:44:44] dispensation of of of the law coming
[1:44:48] down to the people where God now would
[1:44:50] be known as God above us. Amen. God
[1:44:56] above us. that that that the people of
[1:44:58] Israel would know God now as as God that
[1:45:02] that was the the God of Israel. They had
[1:45:05] heard about, you know, about the God of
[1:45:08] Israel. They had heard about, you know,
[1:45:11] Abraham. They had heard about Moses,
[1:45:14] about Noah. They had heard about what
[1:45:16] God did through all of these patriarchs.
[1:45:20] But now they were going to experience
[1:45:22] God for themselves because God was now
[1:45:26] looking at them.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; God. Now look, he goes on here, holy
[1:45:31] ground. Then in Exodus 12, look, notice,
[1:45:34] notice the progression here. I just saw
[1:45:37] this this morning. Then in Exodus 12:1
[1:45:40] 16 where he says that the first day, the
[1:45:44] seventh day shall be a holy convocation,
[1:45:48] no manner of work. Hallelujah. The
[1:45:52] seventh day, the opening of the seventh
[1:45:54] seal, the the the the the seven seals
[1:45:58] being revealed, all these things. When
[1:46:00] when you start to look at these things,
[1:46:01] you're going to see there's there's
[1:46:03] something here that the Lord was
[1:46:04] conveying in all of this. Then he goes
[1:46:07] on, he says in Exodus 15:13, he has
[1:46:11] redeemed a people to guide them into a
[1:46:14] holy habitation
[1:46:18] where they were going to come into a
[1:46:20] holy habitation.
[1:46:22] And then in in in 19 in verse 19 or
[1:46:25] chapter 19 verse 6, ye shall be unto me
[1:46:29] a kingdom of priests and an holy nation.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, praise God. If that
[1:46:35] isn't exactly what he's doing right now.
[1:46:38] Amen. In all of these things, here I go
[1:46:41] to digging in here to see about holy to
[1:46:44] understand why it was, you know, holy,
[1:46:46] where it started, what it means, and
[1:46:47] everything else. But these here, God was
[1:46:50] showing himself because, you know,
[1:46:53] you've been given the understanding.
[1:46:55] You've been given the mind of Christ.
[1:46:57] You can look now and you can see God in
[1:47:00] every scripture. Brother Bram says if
[1:47:02] you don't see Jesus Christ from Genesis
[1:47:04] to Revelation, go back and read it
[1:47:07] again. You're going to see him.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:11] before this people uh you know before
[1:47:14] God made himself known to Israel and and
[1:47:17] come to them as a as a called out set a
[1:47:20] set apart people they worshiped they
[1:47:24] they got so corrupt in their thinking
[1:47:27] God had to destroy them before that with
[1:47:29] Noah God had to send a flood to wipe out
[1:47:32] the the the whole the whole earth
[1:47:35] because the mind of man without God
[1:47:38] without any leadership
[1:47:41] man goes and and and pride takes over
[1:47:44] and man wants to be something. Man wants
[1:47:48] to make himself something. What did they
[1:47:49] end up doing? They ended up to where
[1:47:51] every single thought that they had was
[1:47:54] corrupt.
[1:47:56] God says, "I got to wipe it all out."
[1:47:59] And that's why we had the seven
[1:48:01] different dispensations that we know of.
[1:48:04] the dispensation of innocence. Adam and
[1:48:06] Eve, they were in communion with God
[1:48:08] back in the Garden of Eden before any
[1:48:12] sin had come. They would walk in the
[1:48:14] cool of the night. They would have
[1:48:15] fellowship with the self-existent one.
[1:48:18] They were expressed in his image. They
[1:48:20] had perfect harmony with the father.
[1:48:23] They were walking with him. They were
[1:48:25] living in perfect total innocence
[1:48:27] because the Holy Spirit, the spirit of
[1:48:30] God was all around them. They didn't
[1:48:32] even know they were naked. There was no
[1:48:36] nakedness. They were absolutely pure in
[1:48:39] their heart. Don't you desire that that
[1:48:42] relationship back again? Don't you want
[1:48:44] to have that kind of a walk with God?
[1:48:47] Glory to God. But then the dispensation
[1:48:50] of conscience came in because of sin.
[1:48:52] They became conscious of their sin. Man
[1:48:55] becomes conscious of his unbelief. Oh my
[1:48:58] goodness. And then it goes into the
[1:48:59] dispensation of human government. And
[1:49:01] God has to come in and wipes out the
[1:49:04] whole earth and except for Noah and his
[1:49:06] family to start all over again. Then
[1:49:08] comes the dispensation of the promise
[1:49:10] where God comes to Abraham,
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; calls him out,
[1:49:16] brings him out from amongst his people.
[1:49:20] Abraham recognizes this unknown God
[1:49:22] because Abraham was a pagan
[1:49:25] just like many of us. Until God came
[1:49:28] into our lives, we were lost in sin. We
[1:49:31] didn't know what was good, what was bad.
[1:49:33] We didn't we we would just justify
[1:49:35] everything by our own lusts and desires.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; But Abraham received the call and he
[1:49:41] also received a promise. And that
[1:49:43] promise now has come to you and me.
[1:49:46] Amen. Then came the the the dispensation
[1:49:48] of the law through Moses which lasted
[1:49:52] 1500 years. Glory to God. And then comes
[1:49:54] the dispensation of grace where Jesus
[1:49:58] Christ, the Lord himself, God now coming
[1:50:02] to change his manifestation to come into
[1:50:05] a new dispensation so that he could
[1:50:07] reveal himself personal so that he could
[1:50:10] now come under the dispensation of grace
[1:50:13] where man had sinned again. Man had
[1:50:16] fallen into a state where there was no
[1:50:19] hope for man.
[1:50:21] But if a man sin, a man must die. And so
[1:50:25] he now comes and makes that sacrificial
[1:50:30] price and pays the penalty.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that we could enter in.
[1:50:36] But here it was God changing
[1:50:38] manifestation. Now it was God now coming
[1:50:41] to unite with man. You see, when we talk
[1:50:44] about Holy Spirit, when we talk about
[1:50:46] Holy Ghost, when we talk about the
[1:50:48] spirit of God, it's always in relation
[1:50:51] to man. That's why it's relevant to us
[1:50:55] because it concerns you. You need to
[1:50:58] know what the Holy Ghost is. You need to
[1:51:01] know if you've got it or if you don't
[1:51:03] got it
[1:51:05] because it's a re it's it's in relation
[1:51:07] to man. And Jesus now was coming under
[1:51:10] that dispensation. And then the final
[1:51:12] dispensation will be the millennial
[1:51:14] dispensation
[1:51:16] of 1,000 years. But each of these
[1:51:19] dispensations had different
[1:51:21] manifestations of God. And God's purpose
[1:51:24] in each age, the Lord had separated
[1:51:28] people who he wanted to manifest himself
[1:51:31] through. And he does it by the Holy
[1:51:34] Spirit and now by the Holy Ghost.
[1:51:40] Glory to God. And in the Old Testament,
[1:51:41] God was manifesting himself in in
[1:51:43] different dispensations by anointing
[1:51:45] prophets, kings, priests with his
[1:51:49] spirit, showing that he was that he
[1:51:52] existed, that he was a reality, and that
[1:51:55] he had a purpose
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; in every one of those manifestations
[1:52:00] that he would anoint each king, priest,
[1:52:03] prophet.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; He had a purpose in it. When the Holy
[1:52:07] Spirit would come upon any of them, it
[1:52:09] was God saying, "I have called you
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; for a purpose."
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Anytime the spirit of God would come on
[1:52:17] an individual, that's why you go back,
[1:52:19] you read the Old Testament, and the
[1:52:21] spirit of the Lord came upon Elijah,
[1:52:25] came upon Jeremiah, came upon all the
[1:52:28] prophets, and he would say, "Go and tell
[1:52:30] the people, thus sayeth the Lord."
[1:52:33] It would be the anointing of his spirit
[1:52:35] that would come upon them to so that God
[1:52:38] could bring his word into manifestation
[1:52:42] under that dispensation for a purpose.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Look at David. God set David apart to be
[1:52:52] the next king of Israel as a young boy.
[1:52:54] He goes and he slays Goliath.
[1:52:58] What do you think gave David the
[1:53:01] strength and the anointing to slay
[1:53:04] Goliath? It was the Holy Spirit.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; That's what David had. He was anointed
[1:53:11] for the purpose of God to go and slay
[1:53:14] the enemy. But yet, even with the Holy
[1:53:18] Spirit anointing him, he committed
[1:53:20] adultery.
[1:53:22] He went and committed murder.
[1:53:25] You see, he wasn't he he he was under
[1:53:28] the anointing of the Holy Spirit. God
[1:53:30] would use him for a purpose and then he
[1:53:34] would still be able to sin and do things
[1:53:38] and show that that that there was
[1:53:40] something in him that had not been
[1:53:43] completed yet.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; That's why we have to come to this day.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; That's why without us they cannot be
[1:53:51] made perfect.
[1:53:53] They're waiting on on what we are going
[1:53:55] to manifest in this day and in this
[1:53:57] hour.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at Samson under the
[1:54:02] anointing because you say, "Oh, they had
[1:54:04] the Holy Spirit. They had the Holy
[1:54:05] Ghost. They were anointed by the Holy
[1:54:08] Spirit. They were anointed by the Holy
[1:54:10] Ghost. They were anointed by the spirit
[1:54:12] of God to have supernatural strength to
[1:54:15] do the things that they did."
[1:54:18] But it wasn't until until Samson's hair
[1:54:21] was cut that he lost his strength,
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; his Nazerite vow unto the Lord. God had
[1:54:26] called Samson for a purpose. And when
[1:54:29] God calls you for a purpose and you
[1:54:31] reject that purpose,
[1:54:34] you're going to find yourself in sin.
[1:54:36] You're going to find your life falling
[1:54:37] apart. You're going to realize that this
[1:54:39] cannot continue. I I'm missing
[1:54:42] something. There's an element that I'm
[1:54:44] missing.
[1:54:47] So the evidence of the Holy Spirit back
[1:54:49] in the Old Testament was not that they
[1:54:52] would live perfect lives.
[1:54:55] And the evidence of the Holy Ghost in
[1:54:57] this hour is the same thing. You're not
[1:55:00] going to live a perfect life. Don't be
[1:55:01] thinking you can live a perfect life
[1:55:03] thinking that if you get the Holy Ghost,
[1:55:06] that's all you need. You need much more
[1:55:09] than that. You need the person of the of
[1:55:11] the Holy Ghost.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; You need Jesus Christ himself. Amen.
[1:55:15] Glory to God. Hallelujah. So when the
[1:55:17] Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost comes on a
[1:55:19] person, they can never remain the same.
[1:55:23] That's for sure. Because a process
[1:55:25] starts to take place within their lives.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; David knew that the anointing of the
[1:55:31] spirit of God was on him. And when he
[1:55:34] had fallen into sin, listen to what he
[1:55:36] says. Lord, take not thine Holy Spirit
[1:55:39] from me. It was on his life. It was
[1:55:42] around his life. It was prospering his
[1:55:44] life. It gave him an anointing and a
[1:55:47] strength. But when he had fallen into
[1:55:50] sin, he lost that anointing.
[1:55:52] He felt alone. He felt, you know, Lord,
[1:55:56] take not thine Holy Spirit from me,
[1:55:59] which means that he had this on his
[1:56:01] life.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; And it's not something that once you've
[1:56:05] received it, once you once you've truly
[1:56:08] come alive and come to a revelation of
[1:56:10] this, you can never lose it.
[1:56:17] Let's read the next quote.
[1:56:20] Now I want to talk on it as the Holy
[1:56:23] Spirit being a sign for it is a sign. We
[1:56:28] realize that that all promises is given
[1:56:30] to us by Abraham and Abraham was the
[1:56:34] father of the promise because God gave
[1:56:36] the promise to Abraham and to his seed
[1:56:39] after him. The promise was made to
[1:56:43] Abraham and to his seed. And this sign
[1:56:48] is uh to a covenant people. So we know
[1:56:52] that when God is going to give the Holy
[1:56:54] Ghost, he's giving it to a covenant
[1:56:56] people. He's given it to a to a people
[1:56:59] that he he he already knows who you are.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, there is a vast
[1:57:06] difference between just a Christian
[1:57:10] and a Holy Ghostfilled Christian.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; There's a big difference.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; And now we're going to get this from the
[1:57:17] scripture and place it just exactly in
[1:57:20] the scripture. The first the first place
[1:57:23] there is a Christian professed to be a
[1:57:25] Christian. But if this Christian has not
[1:57:28] yet been filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:57:31] he's only in process of being a
[1:57:34] Christian.
[1:57:36] So, you're, you know, you're sitting
[1:57:38] there and you're hearing this and you're
[1:57:41] you're looking at your experience and
[1:57:43] you're wondering where do I fit in all
[1:57:46] of this?
[1:57:48] Remember, if you're a son or a daughter
[1:57:50] of God, you can never ever be lost.
[1:57:53] So, get that out of your mind that, oh,
[1:57:56] maybe I'm lost. If you're a son or a
[1:57:59] daughter of God, you can never be lost.
[1:58:01] Amen.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; He says, "But if this Christian has not
[1:58:06] been filled with the Holy Ghost, he's
[1:58:07] only in the process of being a
[1:58:09] Christian." See, he has professed to
[1:58:12] believe it. He's working to it, but God
[1:58:15] has not yet given him this spirit of the
[1:58:18] Holy Ghost. He's not yet reached that
[1:58:22] goal with God that God has recognized
[1:58:24] it.
[1:58:26] You will know
[1:58:29] when you have entered into that
[1:58:32] relationship with God. Remember when God
[1:58:35] comes into your life,
[1:58:37] you have to change.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Your nature begins to change.
[1:58:43] If you have, if listen, if you're still
[1:58:46] in the same condition that you were a
[1:58:48] year ago, today,
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; you need to check your walk with God.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; You need to take a closer look because
[1:58:58] his nature has to be taking over your
[1:59:02] nature.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Because his nature has a purpose in
[1:59:06] coming into you. Amen.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Remember, the Holy Ghost will not come
[1:59:10] into somebody unless God has a purpose
[1:59:14] for that individual.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; You can come into the church, you can
[1:59:20] get under the anointing. Oh, we had some
[1:59:23] wonderful meetings over here a couple of
[1:59:24] weeks ago. My God, the people were
[1:59:27] shouting. They were rejoicing in the in
[1:59:29] the presence of God. And there was such
[1:59:31] an anointing in the house that day. Oh,
[1:59:34] that over that weekend. And so many
[1:59:36] people were left rejoicing.
[1:59:39] I bet you you go back and talk to 80% of
[1:59:43] those people. They'll tell you, "Oh,
[1:59:46] brother, yeah, wow, those meetings, they
[1:59:48] were wonderful."
[1:59:50] But man, what a fight. You know, I'm
[1:59:53] still dealing with this. I'm still
[1:59:55] dealing with that. Of course,
[1:59:58] because it doesn't just end with an
[2:00:00] anointing.
[2:00:02] Your experience cannot be based on you
[2:00:04] coming to certain meetings and getting a
[2:00:06] fresh anointing. All you got was a
[2:00:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And do you
[2:00:11] need that? Yes, you need that because we
[2:00:14] know that you know the the whole process
[2:00:16] of of receiving the Holy Ghost. Luther,
[2:00:20] Wesley, Pentecost, and then the Holy
[2:00:23] Ghost himself, justification,
[2:00:25] sanctification made way for the baptism
[2:00:27] of the Holy Ghost. But here we've got a
[2:00:30] prophet that was sent to us in the 20th
[2:00:33] century who was the messenger to the
[2:00:35] Leodysian church age. It went now beyond
[2:00:39] Pentecost. He was the one that was
[2:00:41] bringing this message in 1959.
[2:00:44] He knew that there was a dispensational
[2:00:46] change that was in motion.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; He was the one that introduced you know
[2:00:51] that nobody ever talked about this until
[2:00:53] he brought it out. What the Holy Ghost
[2:00:56] actually is. What is the Holy Ghost?
[2:00:59] People had a a conception. If you talk
[2:01:01] to the Pentecostals, it was speaking in
[2:01:03] tongues. It was gifts of the spirit,
[2:01:05] shouting, praising God. Oh, coming
[2:01:08] getting that anointing on your life. You
[2:01:10] come in, you get baptized, you go in a
[2:01:12] wet sinner. You go in a dry sinner, you
[2:01:15] come out a wet sinner.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; No change, no transformation,
[2:01:20] no nature change.
[2:01:23] That's not the Holy Ghost of this hour.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:26] The Holy Ghost of this hour will bring
[2:01:29] absolute change in your life.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; You will not remain the same today after
[2:01:35] this message here today. If you're under
[2:01:37] this anointing, if you're catching the
[2:01:39] thoughts, I can't convey to you in in in
[2:01:42] word, but I'm trusting that the Holy
[2:01:45] Spirit is speaking to your hearts and
[2:01:47] giving you an understanding. You you've
[2:01:49] got to progress. You've got to shake
[2:01:52] yourself. You've got to understand that
[2:01:54] the Holy Ghost is a is a lifechanging
[2:01:57] experience in your life and that things
[2:02:00] must change. They cannot remain the
[2:02:02] same.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:07] Go to the next slide.
[2:02:13] I need a
[2:02:15] Kleenex.
[2:02:17] Some paper towel, please.
[2:02:20] Here
[2:02:27] he says, "He called Abraham,
[2:02:30] and Abraham moved out of his country
[2:02:34] and went into a strange land to dwell
[2:02:37] among strange people." And that was a
[2:02:40] type of when God calls a man to stop his
[2:02:45] meanness,
[2:02:47] repent of his sins. He turns them from
[2:02:51] the crowd that he was in to live in a
[2:02:55] new crowd. Amen. This is what God does
[2:02:57] when when when you've truly received his
[2:03:00] spirit
[2:03:01] among a new type of people, new types of
[2:03:04] people. I never knew I had never had any
[2:03:07] idea I'd be I'd be, you know, mingling
[2:03:09] with with so many different nations of
[2:03:11] peoples.
[2:03:14] peculiar people,
[2:03:17] very simple, humble people of of every
[2:03:21] walk of life.
[2:03:23] But when the Holy Ghost is in there,
[2:03:25] there's a fellowship divine.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; There's something that overrides how you
[2:03:30] look, how you think, how you speak, how
[2:03:32] you how you react to situations. When I
[2:03:34] get into fellowship with the Holy Ghost
[2:03:36] in you, it changes my love for you, my
[2:03:39] my desire to be with you, my my
[2:03:42] experience walking with you and edifying
[2:03:45] one another in the Holy Ghost,
[2:03:50] you come among a new types of people.
[2:03:54] And then after God found Abraham to be
[2:03:56] faithful,
[2:03:58] God's still checking, testing, cleaning,
[2:04:02] purging things in our lives.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Because he wants us he wants to he wants
[2:04:08] to fully indwell us.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; He wants to fully consume you.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; He wants to he wants you to he wants you
[2:04:14] to give he wants to give you the
[2:04:16] fullness of the word.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; No more partial no more portion of the
[2:04:20] word. This is the hour where the
[2:04:22] fullness of the word, the fullness. And
[2:04:25] who is the word? It's Christ.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; He wants you to have it all. Amen. But
[2:04:29] he needs character. He needs maturity.
[2:04:32] He needs understanding. He needs you to
[2:04:34] study the word. He doesn't want you to
[2:04:36] get all caught up into the emotion of
[2:04:38] the word.
[2:04:40] It's not about emotion. It's not about
[2:04:42] yelling and screaming and shouting.
[2:04:45] Those things are all good. It's not
[2:04:47] about speaking in tongues. It's not
[2:04:49] about, you know, prophesying.
[2:04:51] It's about a humble spirit in the
[2:04:54] presence of God, willing to submit to
[2:04:57] his presence that he can change your
[2:05:00] life and and deal with the things that
[2:05:02] the enemy has been trying to keep on
[2:05:04] your life as a stronghold to prevent you
[2:05:07] into coming into the full maturity of a
[2:05:10] son or a daughter of God.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Abraham to be faithful to the promise
[2:05:15] that God gave him. God found him
[2:05:18] faithful that he would have a that he
[2:05:20] would have the child and through this
[2:05:22] child all earth would be blessed. Then
[2:05:24] God confirmed his faith by giving him a
[2:05:27] sign and that sign was circumcision and
[2:05:31] circumcision is a type of the Holy
[2:05:34] Spirit. It's a type of God vindicating.
[2:05:38] I'm pleased.
[2:05:40] I've separated you and now I'm going to
[2:05:42] place a seal on your life. I'm going to
[2:05:45] place my spirit upon your life. If you
[2:05:48] are not displaying the sign of the of
[2:05:51] the Messiah on your life, if people
[2:05:54] don't know you as Oh yeah. Oh yeah. When
[2:05:57] I talk to Tim, oh yeah, he loves the
[2:05:59] Lord. Yep. He loves to talk about God.
[2:06:02] Yep. When I talk to brother Eugene, oh
[2:06:04] yeah, yeah. Yeah. He comes to work, but
[2:06:06] he's praising God. He's saying God is
[2:06:08] good. Brother Phillip, he gets into a a
[2:06:11] job situation and he gets a contract. He
[2:06:14] says right to their face, "Praise God.
[2:06:16] God has blessed me by blessing you."
[2:06:18] Amen. You see all of these things,
[2:06:20] you've come into a relationship in
[2:06:23] knowing and and and God is pleased now
[2:06:26] with your life because you're actually
[2:06:28] displaying the sign of the Messiah.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; You're you're displaying the fullness of
[2:06:34] the word that's to come on display. And
[2:06:37] it's not some, you know, religious
[2:06:40] spirit. You go into work and say,
[2:06:43] "Praise God, I'm here. I'm going to pray
[2:06:45] for everybody today. Everybody repent
[2:06:49] right now so that we can pray before
[2:06:51] God."
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; That's a religious spirit
[2:06:57] that's going to send the people further
[2:06:59] away from God.
[2:07:01] But if you see somebody that's
[2:07:02] struggling and you go up to them and you
[2:07:04] say, "Hey man, I see you're in a bit of
[2:07:07] a struggle. You mind if I pray for you?"
[2:07:10] Just personal,
[2:07:13] that person's going to wonder,
[2:07:17] "That's different."
[2:07:19] You see, it's it's because you've you
[2:07:21] you you know where you are. You know
[2:07:25] where you're standing. And this this is
[2:07:28] on display now in your life.
[2:07:30] It's just who you are.
[2:07:34] Praise God. Let's go to the next
[2:07:35] scripture. Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4.
[2:07:38] It says, "According
[2:07:41] as he hath chosen us in him," what time
[2:07:45] is it? 10 to 1. Okay, we're going to go
[2:07:48] through this and we're going to stop
[2:07:50] here. according as he hath chosen us in
[2:07:52] him before the foundations of the world
[2:07:55] that we should be holy and without blame
[2:07:59] before him in love. Now, we read this a
[2:08:02] couple of weeks ago, but I want to bring
[2:08:04] it up again to to make clear here where
[2:08:06] we're standing. Having predestinated us
[2:08:08] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[2:08:12] Christ to himself according to the good
[2:08:15] pleasure of his will. Next slide.
[2:08:20] having made known unto us the mystery of
[2:08:23] his will according to his good pleasure
[2:08:26] which he hath purposed in himself.
[2:08:32] He's purposed your life, your your
[2:08:36] being, your existence. It's in him. He's
[2:08:39] purposed it within himself. You're a
[2:08:42] part of him. You are now in the by you
[2:08:46] receiving the Holy Ghost. The purpose of
[2:08:48] you receiving the Holy Ghost is so that
[2:08:51] he can be on display. So that he can
[2:08:54] reveal his purpose, his will, why he's
[2:08:58] placed you in him. Amen. That in the
[2:09:01] dispensation of the fullness of times,
[2:09:03] he might gather together in one all
[2:09:06] things in Christ, both which are in
[2:09:08] heaven and which are on earth, even in
[2:09:12] him. in whom we also have obtained an
[2:09:17] inheritance, being predestinated
[2:09:20] according to the purpose of him who
[2:09:23] workketh all things after the counsel of
[2:09:26] his own will. So what is the purpose of
[2:09:30] the Holy Ghost?
[2:09:32] Why is it that he that you know uh you
[2:09:35] know if you look at the word holy? Go to
[2:09:37] the next slide. It says holy is
[2:09:40] fundamentally meaning that you are being
[2:09:42] that you're being separated when you've
[2:09:45] received the Holy Ghost. You've you
[2:09:48] you've come into that relationship with
[2:09:50] him. Not by you know we're going to be
[2:09:53] looking at a lot more next week. This is
[2:09:56] just this is just really a foundation.
[2:09:58] We're going to be going deeper into the
[2:10:01] manifestations of the Holy Ghost and
[2:10:03] what it what how it brings change in our
[2:10:05] lives. But you need to understand that
[2:10:07] his purpose in giving you the Holy Ghost
[2:10:10] is to separate you.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Is to put a seal upon your life. He says
[2:10:16] in Ephesians 4, whereby you are sealed
[2:10:20] until the day of your redemption.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; That seal is something that can never be
[2:10:24] taken from you.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; It can never be it can never be taken
[2:10:30] from you because God has sealed you by
[2:10:33] Holy Ghost. set you apart for a purpose.
[2:10:38] A distinct call to be holy through being
[2:10:42] set apart for the purpose of God. Holy.
[2:10:46] If you look at the word holy, it's not
[2:10:48] about being living perfect.
[2:10:52] It's about being set apart and called
[2:10:54] out by God.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; That's what holy is.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; People got that. They they they mis they
[2:11:01] misunderstand it. That's why a lot of
[2:11:03] young people, they think that that, you
[2:11:05] know, oh, if I receive the Holy Ghost, I
[2:11:06] got to live a perfect life. I just told
[2:11:08] you Samson received the spirit of God on
[2:11:11] him. And yet, while he was under that
[2:11:14] anointing, he was committing adultery.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; Should have been with another woman. He
[2:11:19] should No, David, he took another man's
[2:11:22] wife and killed the man while under that
[2:11:24] anointing.
[2:11:27] I'm not saying that you're going to go
[2:11:28] out and live that kind of a life. That's
[2:11:29] not what I'm saying. But you need to
[2:11:31] understand that the word holy when God
[2:11:35] was calling David, God was calling David
[2:11:38] for the position of being the king of
[2:11:41] Israel. He was setting him aside for the
[2:11:45] purpose of displaying his attributes
[2:11:47] through David.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:11:50] And God is calling you as an individual
[2:11:54] by giving you the holy set aside purpose
[2:11:57] of God
[2:11:59] so that your life now can be on display
[2:12:02] a lot different than what the Christian
[2:12:04] world out there calls the Holy Ghost.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; There's a different understanding on the
[2:12:11] Holy Ghost out there than there is in
[2:12:13] here. Amen.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; So we must have the understanding of the
[2:12:17] difference in the manifestations of the
[2:12:20] spirit. The spirit of all existing one
[2:12:23] before there was a holy spirit before
[2:12:25] there was a holy ghost before there was
[2:12:27] any manifestation was the spirit of
[2:12:31] Elohim the self-existent one. Then we
[2:12:34] need to understand the holy spirit is
[2:12:37] the anointing on man but it is also him.
[2:12:42] The Holy Ghost is the person of the
[2:12:44] spirit in man.
[2:12:47] The Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost
[2:12:49] baptism is the spirit of God anointing
[2:12:52] man.
[2:12:54] That's why you need the fresh baptism of
[2:12:56] the Holy Ghost when you come into the
[2:12:58] house of the Lord. You need to hear the
[2:13:00] word of God that brings a refreshing
[2:13:02] into your life that because and it's not
[2:13:04] an emotion. It doesn't have to be an
[2:13:06] emotion for somebody. It could be
[2:13:08] somebody right here, right now that's
[2:13:10] just sitting there and God is speaking
[2:13:12] directly to their hearts and maybe one
[2:13:13] tear coming down because they feel that
[2:13:16] that that that God, you know, God really
[2:13:18] wants them to to to have a closer walk
[2:13:20] with them and and and the anointing is
[2:13:23] is just revealing the word to them,
[2:13:26] opening up the scriptures to them,
[2:13:28] making the word come alive. All of a
[2:13:30] sudden, now I understand why the the
[2:13:32] prophet of Revelations 10:1-7 had to be
[2:13:35] on earth when the mighty angel came down
[2:13:37] because God was displaying and and
[2:13:40] bringing the first fruits of what we
[2:13:42] were to become. Amen. As sons and
[2:13:45] daughters of God,
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; all of this starts to make sense. All of
[2:13:51] a sudden, now you're not being pulled by
[2:13:54] the tape ministry by you got to only
[2:13:56] listen to the tapes. Can you imagine
[2:13:59] what kind of an experience is that where
[2:14:02] it's only listen to the tapes, only get
[2:14:05] high and get emotionally, you know, uh,
[2:14:08] built up by listening to the tapes and
[2:14:11] then yet living a life where you're
[2:14:13] still depressed? You're still oppressed.
[2:14:16] You don't understand why you're still,
[2:14:18] you know, uh, bound by certain sin in
[2:14:20] your life
[2:14:22] and unbelief.
[2:14:25] You need the Holy Ghost person to come
[2:14:30] possess, take control, change you,
[2:14:34] remove every doubt
[2:14:38] that you had possibly would allow to
[2:14:41] come into your life. Amen. You have the
[2:14:43] baptism of the Holy Spirit. It gives man
[2:14:45] the supernatural ability to do things.
[2:14:49] You need the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:14:51] from time to times. You need God to come
[2:14:53] and anoint you sometimes. Even though
[2:14:56] you've got him, you still need his
[2:14:58] ability to come on you every now and
[2:15:01] then to to open the understanding so you
[2:15:03] can testify so that you can test give a
[2:15:06] testimony or or lay your hands on the
[2:15:08] sick.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; And have them recover because of your
[2:15:11] relationship, your walk with God. He
[2:15:14] anoints you with his power, with his
[2:15:17] spirit, with his anointing from time to
[2:15:19] time. You need it. But there's a
[2:15:22] difference because somebody could get
[2:15:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour
[2:15:26] of the day, Brother Aram said, and still
[2:15:28] be lost.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm going to stop right
[2:15:37] here, let the musicians come. Next week,
[2:15:40] we're going to be looking at how this
[2:15:42] dispensation changed
[2:15:45] from Holy Spirit of the Old Testament to
[2:15:48] the Holy Ghost in the New Testament.
[2:15:51] We're going to be looking at how John
[2:15:53] the Baptist was actually the one that
[2:15:55] would be introducing this this
[2:15:57] dispensational change
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; that would take place.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I know there's, you know, this is a
[2:16:03] bit of a study. It there's a bit of
[2:16:05] inspiration, but I'm trusting that, you
[2:16:08] know, that that as we go through this
[2:16:10] that it's going to put some light on
[2:16:13] your personal walk with God and give you
[2:16:16] a strength. You know, this has really
[2:16:19] strengthened me by understanding. I I've
[2:16:22] got a better understanding of my calling
[2:16:25] and why God gave me the Holy Ghost
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; is because God has a purpose in in in
[2:16:31] giving me the Holy Ghost. That purpose
[2:16:33] is on display right here, right now.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; It's right here. It's right there. It's
[2:16:38] right here. It's right there. It's right
[2:16:39] here. Right there. Right there. Right
[2:16:41] there. God is showing that his spirit
[2:16:44] has a purpose. And when that's why we
[2:16:46] read the first scripture that all the
[2:16:48] gifts are from the same spirit. He's in
[2:16:52] all and through all.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; But there's a difference when somebody
[2:16:56] comes to a a realization of the person
[2:17:00] of Jesus Christ that they've now come
[2:17:03] into full contact with him and that now
[2:17:06] he's in control. He's he's manifesting.
[2:17:10] He's displaying all the things. I I I'm
[2:17:12] still walking in the world. I make a
[2:17:14] mistake. All of a sudden, the blood
[2:17:16] covers it
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; because there's a purpose in the Holy
[2:17:18] Ghost in me.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; I make a mistake, all of a sudden the
[2:17:21] blood covers it.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; He says, "No, no, no. My purpose
[2:17:24] overrides that situation. My purpose
[2:17:26] overrides your broken relationship with
[2:17:28] that son or that daughter or that
[2:17:30] situation." Oh, glory.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; It overrides everything that God has put
[2:17:39] into your life for a test to see. Just
[2:17:42] like Abraham. Abraham, God
[2:17:44] says,"Abraham, take that first son and
[2:17:47] offer him unto me."
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what to his heart?
[2:17:52] And sometimes you're going through that
[2:17:54] the exact same experience
[2:17:57] where you're experiencing God in such a
[2:17:59] way where you are at a place in your
[2:18:01] life where you just don't know if you're
[2:18:03] going to make it. You don't know if you
[2:18:05] can get through this. You don't know if
[2:18:07] you're going to be able to do it. But
[2:18:08] but you just know something inside you
[2:18:10] is is is pulling you is is drawing you
[2:18:14] to a closer walk with God that you know
[2:18:17] that he can he's he's able to do it.
[2:18:20] He's more than able to do it. Abraham
[2:18:22] knew that God had told him that you will
[2:18:26] have a nation come out of you. He says
[2:18:29] count the stars. He believed the
[2:18:31] promise. He believed the word of God. Do
[2:18:33] you believe it?
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Do you believe what he said about you in
[2:18:36] this hour? Do you believe that you are
[2:18:38] the display of Jesus Christ in
[2:18:41] manifestation by the Holy Ghost to this
[2:18:44] generation that's now falling apart?
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it with all of your heart
[2:18:48] that God can do whatever needs to be
[2:18:51] done to to get you through whatever
[2:18:53] situation you're dealing with right now?
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Believe it, saints.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Father,
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; we so appreciate Lord that without you,
[2:19:04] Father, without your spirit, your
[2:19:05] anointing, your your person coming to
[2:19:09] each and every heart, Lord, we will find
[2:19:12] ourselves at times in such confusion. We
[2:19:14] will we'll be looking for for the Holy
[2:19:16] Ghost in so many different ways and so
[2:19:19] many different avenues. Maybe we got to
[2:19:20] go to this meeting or go to this camp
[2:19:22] meeting or join this church or or or
[2:19:25] maybe I got to maybe I just got to only
[2:19:27] listen to the tapes or maybe there's so
[2:19:29] much confusion out there. Lord, won't
[2:19:31] you come personal to every heart here
[2:19:34] this this afternoon, Lord, those that
[2:19:37] are in in the house of God, those that
[2:19:39] are out listening, Lord, let your spirit
[2:19:41] and your anointing go to them
[2:19:43] personally, Lord. Let it be in such a
[2:19:46] way, Father, that they can know that
[2:19:49] they know that the that that Lord, bring
[2:19:51] them to a place where they can truly
[2:19:53] repent and let go of the things that are
[2:19:57] holding them back from being all that
[2:19:59] you want them to be and to manifest in
[2:20:02] this hour. Granted, Father, we so need
[2:20:06] you, Lord. I need you more than ever,
[2:20:09] Lord.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; You know the things that I'm dealing
[2:20:11] with. You know every heart here. There's
[2:20:13] nobody perfect in this place, Lord. We
[2:20:16] need you.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; We need you in every area, in every
[2:20:19] situation, Father. We're calling upon
[2:20:22] you to come, Lord, and and and baptize
[2:20:25] us with your spirit so that, Lord, we
[2:20:27] have the supernatural strength to
[2:20:29] overcome the things that are trying to
[2:20:31] tear us down, Lord. Granted, Father, we
[2:20:35] know that nothing can ever change our
[2:20:36] salvation. Lord, you don't you're not an
[2:20:38] Indian giver. You don't give and take,
[2:20:41] Lord. Not in that way. Not when you give
[2:20:43] eternal life. No sir. Blessed be your
[2:20:47] wonderful name. Father, we so appreciate
[2:20:49] your word and all that you're doing in
[2:20:51] each and every one of our lives. Father,
[2:20:54] bless your people, Lord. Let us have a
[2:20:56] prosperous week this week. Lord,
[2:20:57] whatever lays before us, Father, give us
[2:20:59] the strength. Go before us, Father. Let
[2:21:02] your spirit direct and guide every
[2:21:05] circumstance around our lives, Lord,
[2:21:06] that we can see you this week in a
[2:21:08] greater way. Lord, I challenge you,
[2:21:11] Father, to come on the scene for every
[2:21:13] every heart that's cried out to you here
[2:21:15] this morning, Lord, that you would just
[2:21:17] do something in their hearts and in
[2:21:19] their lives, Lord. Something simple,
[2:21:21] something real that will that that
[2:21:23] they'll come back and say, "Glory to
[2:21:25] God. He's a reality in my life." Blessed
[2:21:28] be your name, Father. We give you the
[2:21:30] glory and all the praise in Jesus name.
[2:21:33] Amen and amen. Glory, glory, glory.
[2:21:37] Hallelujah.
[2:21:41] Hallelujah. I had one song here.
[2:21:44] Amen. Have you been baptized into the
[2:21:47] body? Praise God. Give Jesus.
[2:21:53] Are you in the church triumphant?
[2:21:59] Are you in the Savior's pride?
[2:22:04] Oh, come and be baptized into the body
[2:22:10] and forever
[2:22:12] more.
[2:22:15] Oh, have you been baptized into the
[2:22:19] body?
[2:22:21] Baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[2:22:27] There is but one way to enter it in
[2:22:32] just as they did on
[2:22:36] cross.
[2:22:38] Or are you in the church triumphant?
[2:22:44] Are you in the savior's bride?
[2:22:49] Have you been baptized into the body
[2:22:55] and forever
[2:22:57] more abide?
[2:23:00] When the bridegroom comes, will you be
[2:23:04] ready
[2:23:06] and your vessel build?
[2:23:09] [Applause]
[2:23:11] You will be among the foolish burdens
[2:23:17] if you do not walk in the light.
[2:23:22] Oh, are you in the church triumphant?
[2:23:28] Are you in the Savior's Christ?
[2:23:34] Have you been baptized into the body
[2:23:39] and forever
[2:23:41] more above
[2:23:45] I am in the church triumphant.
[2:23:50] I am in the Savior's Christ.
[2:23:56] I have been baptized into the body
[2:24:01] and forever
[2:24:04] more.

[2:27:30] Amen. Praise God. You know, when we come
[2:27:34] to church,
[2:27:36] we just don't want to hear a good sermon
[2:27:37] and go home. We want to be identified in
[2:27:39] that in the word that was spoken. I hope
[2:27:42] you are identified. And wherever you are
[2:27:45] identified, it doesn't I don't care
[2:27:47] where you were identified in that word,

[2:28:12] him manifest what he wants to manifest.

[2:28:22] praise God, I'm going to take No, let
[2:28:24] the Holy Spirit do what he wants to do.
[2:28:26] Maybe he just wants to speak a simple
[2:28:28] word to somebody and maybe he wants a
[2:28:30] pat on his shoulder. Oh, power in the
[2:28:32] pat.
[2:28:34] Praise God. But God bless you if you're
