TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good morning friends it's good to be in the house of God on this marvelous wonderful sunny Sunday morning in God's house with God's people giving glory to his wonderful and marvelous name let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father we ask thy blessing upon this a bread of life we ask that you will send it forth to be a blessing to all those that will hear it we commit ourselves to thee for service Lord may a great holy spirit rest upon us and walk upon the water once again and take glory honor and praise in Jesus name Amen and amen god bless you friends brothers sisters in Christ we are again speaking on the second part of the subject the Living Dead oh praise be to God the Living Dead and as we read out of the scriptures first Timothy chapter 5 verse 16 for she's at limit in pleasure is dead while she live it now this scripture is speaking of wanton widows loose living widows living for the pleasure and enjoyment of sin and we're told by the scriptures that she is spiritually dead while yet physically alive and by this scriptural understanding we know that anyone who live a life of sin for the enjoyment of sin is one of the Living Dead I want to leave your old way of life I want you to make a change I want you to be able to say I'm turning around my entire life and I'm going into a different direction today I want you to come out from among the dead and walk in God's purpose and plan for you now we mentioned how that All Saints Day and Halloween night are really pagan worship and celebrations of the physically dead who can never return to us ever again now we know friends that the worship of ancestors the worship of these so-called dead relatives and frames is totally unscriptural and against the Word of God for no dead person really ever comes back it is Satan and his armies of Darkness who have exploited a loophole in religious teaching of today these demonic entities are impersonating people's loved ones and getting people to believe that their loved ones have returned to them that's a lie from the pit of hell that's a lie from Satan now you of my friends what time is it it's midnight darkness covers the land and gross darkness and blindness is upon the people who cannot recognize the way of God because of the confusing array of dynamic nations and different thought processes that are propounded and place out there and so men on women are walking and doubt not recognizing what direction they should take it is spiritually dark so dark so dark as it was in the land of Egypt it is the church age of Leticia where we go from walking in bright moonlight right on through the ages predicted to walk into this age of Leticia of a total brat black out of truth understanding wisdom and the light of God now during this darkness these evil demonic walking corpses are everywhere roaming the earth spiritually dead on the inside capable of any action and physically there are life spiritually dead but physically alive a walking corpse roaming the earth they may be all dressed up with a beautiful dress beautiful woman beautiful man beautiful suit handsome man like that animated by a spirit of enticement and seduction and blind it to the Word of God unbelieving people unbelieving people like in North Day and like lots they we're like this all friends look into the Word of God where Jesus himself said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days when the Son of Man is being revealed again and make no mistake friends the manifest Asians of these invisible invaders are here among us they have moved from those primitive days where are of people falling on the ground forming at the mouth and and long fingernails had long hair and drooling and dripping right on down to appearing like Angels of Light and of respectability and acceptability also but I tell you the book of Revelation chapter 9 speaks of them graphically and describes these horrible and unimaginable evil things that are coming upon the earth read your Bible book of Revelation chapter 9 it tells of them all kinds of locusts all kinds of scorpion-tailed animals insects and monsters looking like women with hit with tear like women and acting like evil beasts o friends it's coming upon the face of the earth and a part of it is already here run I would say run people run into Jesus Christ and ask him for the salvation of your soul repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he will forgive you cleanse you and accept you as one of his own let us face it without Jesus Christ in your life you're living in a nightmare this world is like a nightmare and you are living in it right now sweating and screaming and one day you'll wake up with a shout because you find your way slipping and sliding down into a glowing fiery Devil's pit of hell right now he'll parts of Hell has opened up a part of him is manifesting itself on earth now by the actions the activities the display of the inside to the outside you can see hell manifesting itself and we are living in the middle of a living huge asylum here upon the earth it has been said by the prophet of Malachi 4:5 shall come to pass that the entire world will go insane people will be insane everywhere ninety sixty four when their eyes were opened listen we are living in a country insane institution 1965 communion yes sir the entire world has become like a complete insane institution with the people on the merry-go-round of madness and all kinds of ungodly unseemly perverted poisonous and evil things taking place around us and the devil has so proliferated it that is now becoming normalize ungodly acts ungodly things being done right openly and it's accepted as a norm era seems to sit upon the throne lies seem to reign and the truth seems to be on the streets crying all my brothers my sisters back to the Bible back to the Word of God search the Scriptures and see it bends in you will see the truth don't just take what I say what the priests say what the Pope says or what the superintendent says take God's word for the Bible says let every man's work be aligned and my word be the truth that is how we should approach it brothers and sisters no this entire world is a pond of golf strain and that ghost train is speeding its way right to the last stop by life and by our nature we are displaying that we are on that train or when we're off that train I can tell you I'm not on that train I've left that train already I got off of it many years ago I gave my life to the Lord Jesus Christ and now I'm on the gospel train I'm on the glory train I'm headed home to glory but this other train is going in the opposite direction it's Satan ghost train and many people wrongly or rightly find themselves on that train by some mistake and they don't know how they get off oh stop the world stop the train I want to get off and it seems as if the train and the world keeps going around and they're handing up on it and that train makes stops along the way to pick up many other passengers and I run that time as possible that a person if they're aware of what's happening they can get off that's happens junctions in our lives comes trials troubles opportunity comes and we must know by the grace of God when we are to get off of that train that we are on many call it the rat race many call it the race of life but that's the that's the human race that's on that kind of a train and you are on a train that's going from stop to stop giving you opportunities why are you getting like to get off of that train but if you do not get off that train the last stop is going to be held hell is your last destination that that train ladies and gentlemen says the conductor the last stop coming up now and the last stop is called hell my friends you're headed for a town or a city that's called him and so we use the term hell bound hell bound there you are you bought your ticket by your actions by your nature listen a person can make mistakes and ask God for forgiveness and go on and God will wash them in his blood forgive them for their wrongdoing cleanse them from their sin like anyone else and my friends but then there are so many that it is their nature to sin not sin by a mistake but the nature the the desire is in them the unstoppable urge to sin is in them and so they are called a sinner not one that just sins and then ask God Oh Lord I made a mistake forgive me Lord I'm here I want to be your child your son your daughter I slipped up I messed up Lord I'm turning around I'm coming to you Lord forgive me of my sins that's totally different than one who sits on that train and loves the view and loves the enjoyment loves the pleasure love all those things and the Train many times for well knowing that train is hellbound i heard the man just today saying oh yes i'm gonna enjoy my life and even if i die this way then at least I lived well I don't I don't think that's really life you actually are dead when were yet living if you're gonna be thinking like that so that train is bound to its last and final stop which is him and many others are on that train and really don't know that they're on that train they got on the train by making a mistake and here we find them Revelation chapter 3 verse 17 that the Bible tells us clearly that many say I'm rich I'm increased with Goods but the Lord says but knowest thou not in other words but you don't know you don't realize no it's now not my friends that were blind you miserable and the spiritually naked lukewarm if you're even a church member and don't even know it and know it it not you're on that train and don't realize that you're on a train that's held bound honestly to Satan's pit now in his mission series o-h Ren the author mentioned that we are at war with the armies of darkness you know the scripture clearly tells us we are we do not fight against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places yes sir we are at war against the powers of darkness and the god of this evil age the book of Revelation chapter 12 the Bible tells us fear in the Word of God chapter 12 verse 7 and there was war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought with his angels and prevailed not he lost neither was their place found any more for him in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him all of these devils and demons another part of the scripture tells us this was one third of the angels that he was able to persuade right came with him down to this earth to infest to to possess the control the minds hearts and the bodies of men to live in them and to commit demonic acts all friends that is why the term was used we are living in an insane asylum surrounded by these walking corpses anointed and inspired by the devil and all of his evil works but thanks be to God we find out that he is a loser because in the book of Isaiah chapter 12 we discover in the Word of God that Lucifer who became Satan the dragon the evil one that old serpent speaking his ancient wisdom was kicked out of heaven thanks be to God God kicked him out of heaven he will not put up with his actions as lies he will not put up with him with his evils hit with all of his see subverting God's kingdom and his great conspiracy God kicked him out and you never right if you can believe God's Word whoever you are no matter how humble your life is or how mighty your life is no matter her accomplishment you have a right to kick him out of your life in the name of Jesus Christ and claim a complete victory over him for the Bible says they fought but they prevailed not and they were kicked out where were they kicked up up cast out upon the earth so we rather now right here among us these invisible invaders in a further part of that chapter it calls him 200 200 million horsemen 200 million deep monic horsemen upon the face of the earth attacking the entire human race through Envy because God claims them blames them that they are his children and he created them and placed them here and replaced him as the one that should be in charge now you must understand that Satan actually the right from first being called Lucifer when he was in heaven and we know that Lucifer according to the Bible read isaiah 14 as we said he was the Light Bearer this main name means Light Bearer oh he was also the leader or worship leader up there in heaven he led the chorus he led every all the sing in the worship of Almighty God but after a while God jealous of the worship God was receiving and then he began to create an evil conspiracy against the Most High God and by telling mom tales which we call lies but his long tail he was able to pull in one turn of the excerpt of the Angels on his side and there with that third of the angels this evil one began to try to offer throw the kingdom of God but the Bible tells us and there was warned in heaven and Michael fought with his angels and defeated Lucifer and his angels and so when he was kicked out his nature changed his name got changed it wasn't Lucifer anymore he wasn't bearing any light anymore but he was now the Prince of Darkness he was now called Satan he was called an evil one he was called that great dragon he was called that old serpent yes sir and a Bible said he was kicked out he was cast out no wonder jesus said in my name if thou canst believe in my name you cast out devils your lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover oh yes so we as believers have the right to cast out the devil anywhere he rares up his head and we can recognize it we have the right to cast him out oh praise God for evermore that evil one that Prince of Darkness I also want to draw attention to another one of names he has many names dosa those are just names him so here it is he is also called Beelzebub no Beelzebub which means Lord of the dung heap or translation Lord of the Flies that's inspired many things in this modern day but that is the name of Beelzebub right which means Lord of the dung heap or Lord of the Flies or lord of demons Beelzebub and he was cast out in the name of Jesus Christ thank God we are not of his army but we are of the Lord's hosts we are of the armies of light I am of the army of light I trust you are of the army of light I want to ask whose army are you in in Romans 13 in Galatians 5 Paul describes the works and the lifestyle of those who have membership in this army of Darkness he says in Romans chapter 13 listen closely verses 12 the night is far spent and that day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light works of darkness let us walk honestly as in the date time not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering whirring and in wantonness not in strife and in envy envying but put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh and the book of Galatians Paul continues to describe the activities of this army of Darkness check yourself to see when whether you are a member of this army whose side are you on Joshua was asked the question and he said I am on the Lord's side I trust you will say the same today Paul speaking now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies oh my praise God envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of which I tell you as before I have also told you in times past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God my friends they are as late the coming of the Lord is an end and the entire world is deceiving itself the world is in a terrible state and trying to console itself in this modern age by science by technology trying to console itself that everything is alright never mind the signs in the climate never mind the signs in the heavens above never mind a signs upon the earth beneath earthquakes Wars rumors of wars nation against nation Kingdom against Kingdom as Jesus said in Matthew 24 pestilences striking the earth everywhere and still disobedient man refuses to listen to the voice of God into the science he spoke of over two thousand years ago that they will come upon here and when you see these things know that my coming is there look up lift up your head for your intentions right now think about it but the world keeps consoling itself with parties with all enjoyment with money-making with in every manner of distraction that Satan can provide their defense going in two different directions away from the Word of God trying to say everything is on right some will say oh brother Satan it's my life leave me alone I just want to live my life and have my way but be careful don't you be like a frightened little boy whistling in the dark and trying to convince himself that he's not afraid I'm not afraid I'm not afraid but he is whistling as loud as he can he is playing his boom box or his music as loud as he can and if possible he'll put Stoppers in his ears so that he can't hear the voice of God speaking to him but in reality you're whistling in the dark it is a very sign of fear it's the sign that something inside of you is telling you something is fixing to happen and you need to be prepared and get ready for the scripture says prepare to meet thy God and after death the judgment oh brother sister you say about brother Simon you're old-fashioned all that preaching about handling and going into a fiery pit it's all imagery it's it's not really it's just a pictorial Bible language it's not true I'm here to tell you friends too late will too late will be the cry you take that chance to leap in the dark close your eyes and step into the dirt beyond with no one there to greet or meet nor shining light to welcome you will be a horrible experience for you I warn you in the name of Jesus Christ give your life to Him while there is yet time to give your life and be not a member of this army of the Living Dead give your life to Jesus Christ oh yes they come going going through the graveyard trying to you know prove to everybody else around I'm not afraid I'm not a race Fred but it's whistling so loudly but you're really afraid of what lies ahead of you you're really afraid of the unseen that's in the dark you do not know what next is going to happen and I want to say this is that something I'm making up because as a boy I experienced this in my own hometown I went to the cinema at night and - I went to see the movie congratula and that was in neighbouring town I forgot I totally forgot that after seeing such a horror movie I had to get back to my town late at night and I had to walk through a dark unlit winding country road that made its way of all places through a graveyard that was one mile long graveyards on both sides of this pitch-black dark country road and there I was as a little boy inside trembling but not wanting to of anyone to know that I was afraid I was whistling away whistling away because I was afraid to walk through that graveyard well this world is a graveyard if you're not afraid if you're not recognizing what's going to this happening to this world how its heading down the the greasy pole right to you right my friends right down to a hill right now we need to take us stock of ourselves and ask the Lord Jesus to have his way with in our lives and so there I was in the darkness walking through this graveyard acting as if I was unafraid but very soon that was going to change because suddenly in the dark I heard such a blood-curdling screaming and screeching coming from the moms of tombs that was enough for me and with the fleet feet and running that you can only get from a little boy I ran I ran non-stop until I got home with beating something hard I got home and I want to say my friends don't you deceive yourself don't just live blindly in the darkness of this age don't try to convince yourself that because you're well-off or maybe because you're rich you're fashionable that you have no fears of your future don't deceive yourself because you have a good job a wonderful education and so you have no fear for your future please don't allow yourself to be captured by such thoughts or captivated by such thoughts don't allow yourself to be captured bunnies armies of darkness and to become a slave to the dark side of life your secret dark side hidden from everyone but known only to you and on 1-liter him are the dark hidden secrets now in the midst of this call that 19 atmosphere you may be facing a dark and uncertain future but don't give up but look up look up while there is life in you there is still hope repent give your life and your future into the of our Lord Jesus Christ and I'm sure that in the depths of your heart quietly you will hear the voice of God's angels speaking to you because you have repented because you have turned your life over to me your future is clear god bless you brothers and sisters god bless you my dear friends you have come to the end of this sermon and I wanna bow my head and pray with you in your car in
