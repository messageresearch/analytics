TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] welcome friends here we are again another wednesday evening giving praise honor and glory to his marvelous and wonderful name i'm happy to be with you and may the lord bless us all together as we look into the perfect law of liberty wherever you are at this particular time especially at this time a days before the christmas celebration let us look into god's word and give praise and thanks for god our savior jesus christ and may the lord bless us together as we think on these things out of the book of revelation chapter 3 verse 8 it reads i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name what a marvelous piece of scripture how wonderful it is let us pray our lord and savior lord jesus how thankful we are to be numbered in the great shining strong of the saints who have gone before us we pray thy blessing on this broadcast here today and we pray that the great holy spirit of almighty god will anoint the words of life that we are here to express today we give you all the glory lord and may this be long remembered in jesus name we ask it amen and amen well this evening we are still in the philadelphian church age at this point we want to take for our topic the age of the open door the age of the open door if you will look at this this verse you will find four things that we can look at one i know thy works and those works are analyzed by these four things the open door secondly little strength third their word and forth the name let me share with you also a principle by which we can better understand the flow of the church ages as each church age comes to its ending there is actually an overlapping of these ages a melting into fading into the other age none of these ages actually comes to an abrupt end whatsoever and so it is not the edges are not clear cut like that but they overlap melt or blend into each other as time marches on so one age flows over into the next age the seventh church age which is the leodycian church change which we will consider later on i would say next year is a very short age and it gathers itself up for a quick short work for it must work quickly uh and uh it it because it has a a fight it has a contest it has the saints of that age must be particularly strong in the grace of god the light of the day that they might fight against the uh works of the devil for you must understand that they have to face not one devil from the first day first age or two of the princes of the second age but they face the accumulated evil a cloud of devils are accumulous of them that have come together to come against this church age but when they come against this church age to us we have received the revelation of jesus christ therefore we'll draw the sword and the christian soldiers of the lord will go forth in jesus christ's name in the name of jesus christ we hold the devil accountable to the word of the living god all the realities of pentecost will be in this great age and once this philadelphian church age of which i'm speaking has run its course the ledecian church age quickly comes in and when it comes in it brings in with itself bought the tears and also the wheat because it's ripening time there was a planting season during the great ages of paul and the reformation and here comes the time of growth and now we are coming towards the judgment after the rapture then the judgment and the fruits on the vine are ripening both true and false amen yes both tears and wheat are ripening at this particular time listen matthew 13 30 says first bind the tears to burn them but gather their wheat into my barn oh praise god forevermore now remember the sardis church age started the great rev reformation the resurrection of the pentecostal church of the apostolic age being reformed reshaped resuscitated brought back to life from its entoment and now as the holy ghost begins to move my friends that church that had gone through the planting cycle and come up now through the cycle of planting and watering and nourishing comes right back in at the end of laodicea after the original seed of course we know the original seed is none other but the lord jesus christ himself for he itself says except the corn of wheat fall into the ground it abides alone but if it goes into the ground then it'll come forth multiplied and it'll come forth in a hundred fold and so on and so from the word seed original jesus christ from him came forth the great blast of pentecost and pentecost traveling through the ages through the seven church ages has come to its fullness that seed that was planted there now comes to its fullness after it has gone through its cycle through the ages and it's supposed to come back not to pentecost but back to the original grain the original seed the original word amen and that word is none other but jesus christ himself so when we speak about the restoration of the church we speak about the return of jesus christ we're really talking about the seed going through its cycle dies goes into the ground goes through its cycle what planting watering growing nourishing and now back to when it comes back as an original seed but now in a multiplied form not in the form of the headship of jesus christ but in the multi-pride form of a bride a bride hallelujah praise god for the two are one as adam and eve their name was called adam oh thanks be to god for this wonderful day in which we live praise god jesus said behold i come quickly and that makes the age of laodicea which is to follow this philadelphian church age it's the age of a quick work it is going to be cut short cut short for the elect's sake that a this age of love this year will be cut short watch therefore you know what not when our lord shall come when you least expect he comes upon the scene and takes his waiting bride away north thief keeps noise to let you know he's coming but the thief slips in and slips out hallelujah a certain secret catching away of this last day bride of jesus christ oh praise god hallelujah i pray god that you are elected to be a part of of her oh blessed be his marvelous and wonderful name he said behold i set before the unopened door and no man can shut it hallelujah well of course the open door signifies the tremendous missionary efforts that occurred during this church age of philadelphia of course paul in second corinthians 2 12 paul called the new missionary endeavor for the lord and open door listen furthermore when i came to truass to preach christ's gospel a door was opened unto me of the lord or praise god so we clearly see the meaning of the open door of missionary endeavor missionary works that will be carried on and was carried on during this age of course god works in the number three so we find here in the pergamus church age how that the church in that church age was married to the state there was a state and church union which it which it carries on unto this day state and church and the deeds of the nickelodeons became the doctrine of the nicolaitans this time during this pergamos church age it was an age of open door for the false vine but thanks be to god do during this age of philadelphia it is an open door for the true vine the true believers and the elect of god for as the false vine had an open door to spread and spew their lives spawn their systems of evil so is the true vine given an open door for the spreading of the truth that it might go forth reaching the hearts and lives of all those who will believe the promise of this hour thanks be to god yes they had their time of higher keys setting up their systems which spread like wildfire and three ages later after a long and a hard struggle we find that the open door comes to the for people to be open to the truth in other words god says i'll i'll open the door to the truth that evil cannot prevail continue to prevail over you hallelujah praise god and so the age the fifth age was an age that gave us exploration it gave us communism gave us colonization gave us the printing of books and so on was a great age but god opened the door for the spreading of the truth and i thank god for it now in the book of mark the gospel of mark chapter 16 verses 15 to 20 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover o praise god so then after the lord has spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth preaching everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following hallelujah now notice carefully he never told them now they're in the edge the open door is here the door is open for the spread of the truth and he never told them go ye and establish bible colleges goyi and open up great seminaries goyi build great monasteries everywhere in colleges oh no he did not say goyi and give out tracts spread literatures everywhere that the people may know that i am the christ amen now all those things as i have spoken of they're all fine they're wonderful but what jesus told them was to preach the gospel go and be witnesses unto me stick with the word stay with the word of god and then when you do that these signs shall follow them that will believe the word of god hallelujah amen many people have the idea that the ministry given to the apostles has already died out it's not here anymore but i beg to differ amen the ministry apostolic ministry signs wonders miracles preaching of the truth jesus the christ risen from the dead alive forevermore and we are witnesses of these things that message and the confirmation and vindication is still here with us and it is taking place around the world that he is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever for this i give him praise honor and glory that he has not changed but he's alive forever more oh bless his holy name down to the ages we cannot deny the apostolic power continued on anointing and using men like philip who would dare to deny the ministries of men like irenaeus saint martin columba saint patrick and countless others that god chose to use with his mighty anointing upon them using them for his glory and for his honor hallelujah amen the bible way is the believer's way the bible way is god's open door for every true believer of the living god hallelujah amen i know for a shortie that jesus christ is the same yesterday forever and the power of god is still available to those who will believe and receive it in his great and mighty name hallelujah a matter of fact no man ought to be out there on the mission field preaching the gospel unless he's filled with the holy ghost and preaching the true gospel hallelujah and preaching it in the demonstration of the parable mighty god moving hallelujah power of the holy ghost and if you're not seeing such results you're not seeing that in your life it's because you're not preaching the true gospel back to the word back to the original seed back to the original life let the lord have his way in your life today before behold i set before thee an open door blessed be god hallelujah glory to his name now getting back to the missionary door of this philadelphia age this age was a wonderful missionary age or an age of missionary exploits but it did not have the open door of the demonstrated power of almighty god that it ought to have for the bible mentions for thou hast a little strength there were a few that had the parent presence of god with them but in general that age had little strength oh praise god forevermore the word was preached but the power of the spirit was missing in that age they were anointed to make souls wise unto salvation but the great power of god that showed itself and shot shot his micey works and bearing his arm of strength on behalf of his own was missing except among a few small scattered groups of people who god wanted to use yet we praise god for this age yet we give god for this glorious age where man like william carey who was called the uh father of modern missions from the baptist church of molten england was used of god for that with that great purpose i have set before thee an open door hallelujah oh yes it was in this age my friends that revelation 3 8 speaks of open door then it says little strength word name hallelujah so the open door has to do with all these other three things the open door of course signifies what it signifies john 10 7 and jesus said verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheepfold behold i've set before you an open door and now john 10 7 says i am the door of the sheepfold hallelujah so the i am is the door of the sheep oh praise god so he gives this parable to about himself as a shepherd and calls himself the door and that is what a real shepherd is to the sheep you have to get past the shepherd to get to the sheep so jesus is actually the door to the sheepfold lord said that over in the east eastern part of the world a shepherd would gather his sheep together and he would put them in a fold and when they're there he'll conquer them he'll see it's night and then what would he do he would lay down across that doorway making himself the door that none could come out or none go in because he is the door and it said that often time in the mornings he'd get up and take his sheep and while he's going he'll pass by some of the markets or bazaars and they're all mineral goodies there you would think those sheep would run and try to grab those goodies but now good sheep keep their eyes on their shepherd shepherd they follow the shepherd and don't run everywhere and when if you are genuine truly born again true believers of the message of this hour then you belong to the great shepherd you'll follow the great shepherd only right in his footsteps just as those sheep did you won't be tempted to turn aside leaning to your own understanding turn aside we are all judgments amen oh turn aside attracted by some big shining perfume flower option theology or church listening to the voice of some dd phd or ld some popular preacher of your day you won't do that you'll stay with the shepherd you'll stare with the voice of god in these last days for the bible says my sheep know my voice and a stranger listen a stranger they will not follow a vo a matter of fact a stranger's voice will cause them to flee and run into the arms of their shepherd all glory hallelujah praise god i'll run to him anytime all the time for he is my lord and he is the shepherd of the sheepfold praise god hallelujah now when we come to think of the word or the name shepherd it does not only apply to sheep but do you understand that a man can be a preacher or a so-called shepherd and yet he is a shepherd or a preacher to muse he can be a shepherd to pigs a shepherd to goats a preacher to camels virtually speaking oh my you see a shepherd is one that just my friends grazes herds animals together that person is then called a shepherd while the other shepherds of those other herds will go to their homes and leave their herds whether pigs or goats or mules out in the fields while they go to their homes and rest the true shepherd will lay across the doorway where his sheep are and be right there with them to protect them speak to them and calm them down praise god i want to thank god that jesus is the door and then when the night time of lordisia comes that he will be with us there protecting us caring for us for he is the door of the sheep now the door he said before i set before the unopened door watch it now the door is opening and he claims he is the door what is he speaking of the time coming when he would open the door of revelation of himself for he is the door praise god hallelujah amen oh my that is nothing but a revelation of himself and the revelation is opening up to give you what strengths that strengths could pour out of the word of god into your heart so that you might be able to wrestle against or not flesh and blood but against principalities powers spiritual wickedness demons devils and religious realm of the religious places of a higher ranking than just the regular devil that you will meet when you pray for the sick but these are now enticing spirits religious devils dressed up counterfeit and covered with religious garb religious speech religious words but contrary to the word of the living god and so this great revelation of himself is to give us strength by him illuminating or giving us light upon the word and as the word opens up it gives us strength to meet the challenge of this hour that in the midst we can glorify his great and mighty and wonderful name hallelujah isn't that wonderful friends isn't this a marvelous hour to recognize what god is doing hallelujah amen was in the midst of these last two ages that the deity of jesus christ began to blossom forth back into the knowledge of the people that followed the word of god amen we knew that jesus christ was and his god amen how else could he be your savior god is our savior god is our salvation salvation is of the lord redemption is of the lord oh hallelujah but we know that he is our only god our only savior that jesus christ is god alone that he is our alpha he's our omega he's wonderful counsel almighty god everlasting father prince of peace the bright and the morning star amen the babe born in a manger the word born back there in flesh in that day but there we see him born again the word born again hallelujah when it came down and made itself known in the heart of a prophet the manger of a heart and now the word has come to coming to its full stature going through its cycle ready to go out in a rapture oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah amen god alone that jesus this jesus is both lord and christ making jesus christ god father son and holy ghost in one praise god one person hallelujah thank god amen and that truth was lost since the first or earliest church ages and just it was destroyed and taken away by the false vine oh thank god that he's opening up the door now we are seeing it again in our midst the revelation of who he was and who he is is back in the church again back in my heart again back in your heart again if you can see what we're i'm talking about indeed the godhead is not a tree person god let me repeat that that the god we serve is not a tree person god with one personality where it takes a personality to make a person amen there is one personality only and there is one person from that amen and we believe that one person of god is jesus christ many others believe in three persons being in a three-person godhead and they are guilty of breaking god's first commandment hero israel the lord thy god is one lord amen the lord god is a jealous god no other gods before me thou shalt not bow down before them nor serve them that's the word of god as god spoke even in the old testament but thank god the revelation of god the godhead is back amen i said the revelation of the godhead is back praise god now the true church on the basis of the opening door open door of the word and of the revelation of who god is that he is jesus christ is now recapturing and regaining our strength amen hallelujah and all this time she knows now fully who her lord is who her god is and once again we're baptizing in the name of the lord jesus christ for jesus himself told us to baptize in that name when he says baptize them in the the name one name of the father son and holy ghost and i know peter understood that so when he was asked peter unto what shall we be baptized and he said you baptize them in the name of the lord jesus christ hallelujah amen praise god just as they did on the day of pentecost or praise god forevermore hallelujah if you will look from genesis 1 1 to revelation 22 1 which is to say from cover to cover of the entire bible the only thing you can see is one god if you are seeing three then you've got a blur you see in stars you've got amnesia you hit your head and you don't know what you're seeing oh lord have mercy the people have been blinded by this foul trinitarian dark spirit of dogmas god have mercy yes sir and that dogma is so universally accepted that when anyone preaches or teaches like this back to the word check even your original history check way back as you can you will find that even in the catholic church at one time they're baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ they know it but they have changed their so-called unchanging god they have changed it but god never changes god never lies god knows his word and he stays with the word let every man be a liar and let my word be the truth amen oh yes oh praise god it's almost a struggle to get persons to see the revelation of one god one god amen if people can't see the truth of the godhead they'll fight it they'll fight you or fight that truth if they can't see it they can't ever see the rest of the truth and if they can't see the revelation of the godhead they can't see the rest of the truth amen because the revelation of jesus christ in his church under his works through the ages in the midst of the church for the chapter changes will not be clear in their hearts and minds revelation 3 8 thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name hallelujah the strength returning by the return of the revelation of the word strength is returning into the church dunamis of acts 1 8 acts 2 4 is returned to the church of god but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me praise god hallelujah all glory to his name people have people have received the truth the power of the inquisition had waned the philadelphia church age was on the rise many people left their homelands traveled across the seas demanding freedom of worship which was one of the causes of the french revolution for the york of hierarchies was being broken governments were finding it wise not to take one side or the other but to stand there just as a government within the middle amen poorly led people were marching for their rights their religious rights france as you know fell in the revolution but thank god because of the revival of the ministry of john wesley britain was spared that kind of a problem and so god was able to use britain as his instrument in his hand for many many glorious years before they began to rain the preaching of the word was never greater but while the word was growing greater satan was raising up hordes masses black clouds of mosquito theologians claiming that they had uh that could be called cannons when they had nothing but pipsqueak water pistols the real cannons of those who have their dynamite of revelation of acts 2 4 you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you brought in all manner of multitudes of free sinkers liberal theologians and these days he's infected even the so-called conservative theologians spreading their filthy rotten unscriptural wares contrary to the word of god god has raised up thank god in this hour mighty missionaries mighty men of faith i thank god for people like our great brother john lafontaine amen some of the brothers have passed on brother many are still alive brother johnson that god used in the philippines men that are still on the march on the move with god within their hearts brother biscuit that was used opening up many countries for the glory of god i've sacked talk with brother perry greene or praise god forevermore many people like dio narang or jar of trinidad that god use say what you like god use men like wendy al hallelujah amen god you there are many others and many others have been used right in north america god didn't use them as missionaries to go everywhere overseas but they're missionaries just the same hallelujah tim pruitt donny reagan one of them called they are into home missions yet they are supporting foreign missions oh praise god old henry green from down in the south ruth not carolina god used man of that nature jerry rowe of north carolina many many others you can name them and there are many others whose names may never be known or heard but nevertheless my brothers that day is coming when god said i set before thee an open door and so preaching teaching amen hallelujah god using even the the instrumentality of the voice of god the continuing ministry of brother william marion branham and spreading the gospel far and there various lands languages towns peoples and nations amen hallelujah preachers and teachers rising and coming out of this message man of unmatched anointing and use of god for his glory and honor oh my back there in those ages and back in philadelphia they had their spurgeons william parker mclarens jonathan edwards john bunyan's george miller people like bernards barnes a man who wrote his great commentary bishops many many many others came from that philadelphia church age amen their preached taught and wrought the word and glorified his name and again in this quick short work of the laodicean church age god using amen the bible believers of british columbia canada with their great message hub spreading the gospel everywhere around the world hallelujah god using every instrument he can find whatever you may think of it he is not concerned with that he is just concerned about his gospel getting out and he is taking it out using all the tools that he can find mighty men of god unparalleled through the ages of this hour god are using them to spread the gospel everywhere because before them again is set an open door but what open door is this not only the open door of revelation that is leading them moving them and giving them these divine impulses my friends but the open door of revelation 4 1 when john being a type of the bride heard the voice in heaven saying behold i have set before the unopened door and he said behold a door was opened before me in the heavens oh praise club oh thank god there's an open door of the rapture for this bride we are not going to be shut up we're not going to be shut down we're not going to be closed up close close up because we are going up this we are my friends we already heard the countdown oh blast off time is here upon us we are ready earborn for his glory breaking through the sound barrier we hear nothing else but thus saith the lord may the lord bless you as god has opened before us an open door may the door be opened if you have not entered into this door run quickly get in to the ark door get in to the spaceship door get in to this great door of god who is none other but jesus christ and god will bless you and i'll meet you again if not on this side but we'll meet around the throne of glory god bless you my friends [Music] you
