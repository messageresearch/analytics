TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends it is with great joy that we come together in the presence of the lord may his divine presence bless us may he pour out of the fullness of himself upon us god bless everyone everywhere that will hear or see this word of god now we will speak tonight on the subject of the beginning of the creation of god and this is found in revelation chapter 3 verse 14. it reads thus and unto the church of the laodiceans right these things said the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god amen gracious heavenly father we pray that thou wilt so fertilize and anoint our understanding that the great holy spirit of almighty god will open up and magnify thy word to us that our spirit our being may be able to grasp it all into our hearts father and that by that we'll receive divine strength to come against the falsehoods the lies discrepancies and illusions of the devil may you take all the glory praise and honor father as we surrender ourselves as vessels for you to manifest yourself through by the opening of the word and manifestation of the holy ghost in the name of our blessed lord jesus amen and amen of course the scripture that we read if not understood many will take a wrong interpretation they will take a wrong understanding of it because these words that you may read the beginning of the creation of god it means more than what it sounds like because those words don't mean exactly how it sounds to us and in fact multitudes of people have carnally misunderstood the word of god and around that was built a great organization that taught and still teaches that jesus was just the first creation of god the very first thing that god created was jesus and then the first creation jesus created all the rest of the creation universe and whatever is contained within that universe but that is not right that is unscriptural that does not agree with the rest of the scriptures for the words are that he is the beginner or in other words the author of the creation of god every one of us surely we would know or should know that jesus christ is god himself and the very idea that some one would think to believe that god created god is is absolutely nonsensical it doesn't make any sense for god the eternal being the moment the word create how can you create another eternal being so god did not create jesus for jesus himself is god he is not another god he is not a secondary god he is not a younger god oh he is very god the only god the same one yesterday today and forever and thank god i can testify he lives in me he lives in me the god the creator of all heavens and earth has returned back to earth again and he lives in me to the glory of his mighty name hallelujah amen praise god amen we find in the scriptures john 1 amen the bible tells us it all things were made by him and without him was not not anything made that was made he is the one of whom it is said in genesis 1 1. in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and again in exodus chapter 20 verse 11 for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested on the seventh day but there is no doubt that he is the creator and he was the creator of a finished physical creation amen praise god hallelujah remember john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god amen and that word which was god became flesh and without him was nothing made that was made all thanks be to god that he lives forevermore and a god eternal god my god he is he cannot die he always has existed is present tense now existing and will exist forevermore praise god hallelujah amen now we understand hallelujah god created all these things because he is among all things he is the creator take god and first he created a physical creation and that physical creation of the earth the days the the seas the uh the light the sun the stars all those things mentioned in genesis 1 created adam out of adam he took eve the wife so god created in the physical creation the earth the man and then the wife out of that man hallelujah so he was the author he was and is the beginner of the physical creation but now he is in these church ages he is presenting himself and saying i am not only the author of the physical creation but i am the author of this spiritual creation which we know by from the apostle paul is called the new creation which is what jesus himself was referring to when he said when he was in spirit form he said uh you know my father worked hitherto amen in other words when i was in spirit form this natural creation was made now he came to earth and he was in flesh he says but now i work amen he is now working to bring about the new creation praise god hallelujah amen so he is the author of both natural and spiritual creation hallelujah and we thank god that he stands here again in the midst of his church glory to god hallelujah and he calls himself the author or the originator or the beginner of this new creation that is emerging even as i speak the new creation is manifesting and emerging oh praise god and he's saying my hands are manifest and involved in their life and in the power of the holy spirit working in and through them to bring me glory and honor hallelujah so he is the creator of the true church that he builds himself man no group no administration or association can truly build the true church they can build churches but i'm talking about the bride herself i'm speaking of the true elected church the elected lady of god only god can she originate from and god is saying here i am the originator the beginner the author of this new creation by the power of the holy spirit the heavenly bridegroom now creating his his own pride in the genesis we see god spirit coming to adam and god creating the wife out of adam notice he did not take another different piece of earth to make her but she took apart he took a part of him to make her the wife now in this last day on the divine inspiration the same holy spirit because the heavenly bright groom is the word of god god has taken hallelujah he the heavenly bridegroom god himself has taken a part of himself to bring his bride into her fullness of manifestation praise god displaying in in adam and eve what he would do now at the end of the age and what he is doing now in this hour oh praise be to god who lives forevermore glory to god hallelujah amen notice he created his own body he created his own temple said i would let solomon you you can't really build me a temple amen and so i'll build my own house and so when it is claimed by another group that mary is the mother of god for she produced and created that body that came from her amen but that is simply unscriptural and wrong for it would mean out of sinful mankind came the sinless one which is unscriptural uh you know saying that out of the uh dirty you're going to take something clean and pure out of that it is impossible and it is unscriptural for god himself has spoken amen that he will build his own temple natural spiritual hallelujah praise god no natural man could produce the last adam christ the word of god hallelujah the bible speaks of him and says law a body has thou prepared for me hallelujah amen so god provided the body not mary provided the body the body simply passed through mary but did not come from mary for the scripture tells us that god prepared him a body amen glory to god she was just a human vessel to carry that child and bring him forth to birth amen and that is why jesus the god man god and yet man man and yet god he was the jehovah of the old testament now the jesus of the new testament not another god but the same god in a visible form for the word was made flesh and dwelt among us oh praise god hallelujah thanks be to god you see it was a he was a god man for my friends he was the first or let's let me say this way he was the wave chief of the new creation hallelujah to be resurrected and waved over us as if to say many of the others will come forth from this field of earth and they will come forth and there will be of the same kind as the scripture has said as he is so are we in this world praise god by the word of god making itself known we recognize that we are of that same god gene god quality god's attribute we come from god and we go to god by the great holy spirit of almighty god oh hallelujah glory to god listen what the scripture says amen therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creation praise god for the all things have passed away behold all things have become new amen or praise god so this old order this old man will pass away but the man inside the soul man is renewed day by day and he will never die but this old man will pass away that new creation will never pass away glory be to god for he created in union with jesus christ ephesians 4 24 amen put on the new man put on jesus christ hallelujah amen and i thank god this new creation that is in me now by the word amen hallelujah is not of this old order of it is not carnal it is not of this old creation that will pass away hallelujah amen but placed or created in this body amen it it was placed here on the earth with god's divine purpose jesus had his purpose the prophets had their purpose the apostles had their purpose the members of god's bright body each one individually have their purpose for his glory and for his honor there may be despised decried they may be called names they may be laughed up they may be quietly chuckled at mock that scuff that not a word may be spoken but in your heart you you it's just a uh something to laugh about joke about chuckle about amen but friends back up all of that amen it's the new creation it's a brand new man god by his holy spirit moving in the human heart has done something that the world cannot see but the holy spirit has produced amen for his glory and honor amen glory to god thank god that god is no longer dealing with the ways of the flesh but god is dealing not with the old abraham he is now dealing with abraham's faith seed that had the quality of being able to receive revelation even when there was no written bible abraham received the revelation and his faith seed proves that they are right for his faith seed they identified i identified themselves as part of his faith seed by being able to catch the revelation of god's word hallelujah by inspiration hallelujah amen not just the written word but by inspiration you're able to catch it so god is dealing not with flesh anymore but now out of every kindred every race of people red yellow black white brown whatever color they might be out of all creation every tribe and every nation hallelujah god has purposed to have himself a new creation hallelujah and he is here saying i am the first one of that creation hallelujah why because he came from the realms of glory he is showing you the pattern of how every single elected seed will come to earth and just as jesus was placed to marry god by his spirit place every single elected seed to whichever parent he wanted them to be with and in and to pass through so they could be physically manifested on the scenes of earth to make manifest his glory honor and purpose in and through their lines hallelujah so he is the beginner the beginner the author the originator the first one to comfort of the of god himself coming into flesh in the form of jesus christ the fullness of the godhead bodily but now the individually individual attributes and genes of god because he has shown the pattern also come in flesh flesh that was what was placed here saying oh mary you will bear a son well an angel didn't come to your mom your father your dad but certainly by the purpose of god there were predestinated by him that there may be the originators there would be the uh there will be the vessels is the word i wanted to use there would be the vessels through whom you would pass through so that you could be here to glorify magnify and worship his great name and bring honor to our great eternal father blessing him in all things amen hallelujah praise god amen let me emphasize as spoken by our prophet in the rising of the sun he is the wave sheath the first one to come on this earth god manifested in the flesh hallelujah now his wife comes on the scene and where does she come from from out of himself the word and has been being formed over seven church ages and now we've come to the rest within this eighth day oh god building his own temple amen coming forth now o blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah amen so god literally created himself to be a part of his own creation thank god and this my friends in all simplicity is the true revelation of god god in heaven god on earth god and morphine himself from a single man god man and morphed transform changing himself into a bright form of a many-membered body manifested as he is says the scriptures so are we in this world and we are the same he is the great melchizedek we are priests after the same order or origination of that melchizedek we come from the same source we come from the same fountainhead we come from god and we're going back to god hallelujah amen yes sir god can look down through the ages hallelujah and all would be over and he still would see himself in the midst of his church as the author of the creation of god and it was his sovereign power that brought all of this great mystery that is now unfolding his sovereign power i must say his supreme sovereign power brought all of this to pass when we have come down now to the consummation of the ages soon time will end then into eternity according to prophecies several things still have to come to pass before the earth is renovated oh but between now and then we're looking for a rapture oh the holy spirit has promised his rapturing grace that he will not take his wife through the fires of tribulation and the trials and of tribulation but he is take his wife out of here take his bride out of here for the grace and glory of the living god hallelujah for we are predestinated unto the adoption of children we are already children hallelujah but we are predestinated to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will all this done by his omniscience an omnipotence praise god he has brought it to pass hallelujah and it's now in progress we're in the midst of prophecies being fulfilled we're in the midst of the living word making itself manifested hallelujah praise god standing in the midst of his church receiving glory from all the rest of his brethren hallelujah praise god amen blessed be thy wonderful name receiving glory from all of his brethren who recognized joseph for this day and this hour in which we are ill are in hallelujah amen and so he has worked it all out according to what he knew ephesians 2 11 says in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being pre-destinated according to the purpose of him that worketh all things after the counsel of his own will praise god hallelujah aren't you glad that you belong to him and all my friends are come to a conclusion by saying as has been sung in the past he is my father my mother my sister and my brother he's everything to me he's everything he's everything to me he's everything he's everything to me for he's my father my mother my sister and my brother he's everything to me god bless you tonight and remember jesus is perfect everything
