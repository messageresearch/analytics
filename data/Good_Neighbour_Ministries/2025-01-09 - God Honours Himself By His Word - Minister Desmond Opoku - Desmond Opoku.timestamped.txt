[21:11] period when God speak is done and it's
[21:15] real and never change and remain the
[21:18] same day hour the minute the second that

[22:30] Lord we going to see something here
[22:33] about
[22:34] neon neon the Bible says he was a
[22:38] man look here because of him the Lord
[22:42] has given Deliverance onto Syria that
[22:46] man that man was something special about
[22:49] him he was good man he was not Israel he
[22:52] was
[22:54] Syrian why
[22:56] God he this

[23:35] man of
[23:36] Val Syrian they always fighting with the
[23:40] the land of
[23:42] Israel but why God has to bring this man
[23:45] name in the Bible and all the same time
[23:47] heal him that means there was something
[23:50] about this
[23:51] man God want to glorify himself it
[23:55] doesn't matter if God want to glorify
[23:58] himself he can bring
[24:00] anything
[24:02] purposely that's why when something
[24:04] happened to anybody you cannot just sit
[24:07] down and talk about that person I said
[24:10] believe you don't know what God has
[24:12] brought that to that man how he's going
[24:15] to use that man for His
[24:17] Glory

[24:26] love God doesn't laugh to somebody who
[24:30] is in in need or who who is sick or who
[24:34] is who who has a
[24:37] brish because we know every sickness any
[24:40] deformed person come from Satan and if
[24:44] you are a Believer or God's
[24:47] son when you see that you know the enemy
[24:50] has struck that person so what we have
[24:53] to do
[24:54] is oh Lord have mercy upon this man
[24:59] what can I
[25:00] do to help this man is there anything
[25:04] Lord you want me to do as a Believer
[25:08] what you have to do whisper a little
[25:10] prayer in your heart oh God because we
[25:14] as we are sitting here we don't just
[25:15] come here the mercy and the grace of God
[25:18] has brought us here we didn't come here
[25:21] by ourself Hallelujah there's a purpose
[25:25] why God has brought us here each and
[25:27] everyone has has a purpose each and
[25:30] everyone has a position to be fulfilled
[25:32] if God can bring somebody that is this
[25:36] man and and and brought him to his
[25:39] presentence to glorify himself what
[25:42] about you right now where is
[25:45] God as we are sitting here why is God
[25:47] God is in
[25:49] you if you sitting here if you are
[25:52] walking around and you talking about God
[25:54] and where is God God is here amen
[25:57] because he said I'll be in you even I'll
[26:01] will be with you even in you till the
[26:03] end of this world so where is God God is
[26:07] in you you can do anything with God
[26:11] hallelujah if you believe the message
[26:14] that God have called you into Hallelujah
[26:18] as I always said we are powerful than
[26:21] what we
[26:23] think you can create your own
[26:25] atmosphere Hallelujah when Satan see you
[26:29] is scree because of your
[26:32] presence look here in the time
[26:36] when the Lord Jesus Christ was here or
[26:40] when let's say after he left and Peter
[26:44] and he came back and dwell among the
[26:46] people of the the the
[26:48] disciples what the Bible said when they
[26:51] were walking on the street people
[26:54] intentionally bring the lame people and
[26:56] sick people and lay them on the street
[26:59] for the shadow of these brothers to
[27:02] touch them and the Bible said when they
[27:04] bring them the faith that they brought
[27:07] them and the faith that they believe
[27:08] that God is in them that Faith healed
[27:11] those
[27:13] sickness so we are special people do not
[27:18] underestimate yourself
[27:23] Hallelujah and this man in his time
[27:26] there was a man
[27:28] okay and I I I ask you the meaning of a
[27:31] prophet a prophet is a person who God
[27:36] speak who speak sorry a person who who
[27:41] speaks for
[27:44] God that's the mean of a prophet that is
[27:47] a minister right
[27:51] now a prophet is God a man who God speak
[27:57] through
[27:59] so when a brother or a minister standing
[28:05] here when you speak the word of
[28:08] God I'm talking about a real call
[28:12] ministers because the Bible tells us
[28:15] that we have false prophet false
[28:19] ministers so when God when a true
[28:23] Minister that call from God standing the
[28:27] pulpit and he ministering anything can
[28:32] happen if you
[28:34] believe Hallelujah because that man is
[28:38] Anointed it doesn't
[28:40] matter how shape or form that person is
[28:45] if that person is being called by God
[28:48] himself and is standing in the Pulpit
[28:51] bringing forth the word of God you have
[28:54] to know that even if you're sick or
[28:58] whatever is happening if you believe in
[29:00] your heart and you believe that man
[29:03] something will take place in your
[29:04] life Hallelujah let me tell you to stand
[29:08] here to minister is not just like
[29:11] somebody standing on the pulpit and go
[29:14] and went to school and bringing to be
[29:17] his Perfection this is not a Perfection
[29:19] this is a calling from God
[29:23] hallelujah brother Braham didn't have no
[29:26] education
[29:28] okay he didn't have no education he
[29:31] didn't call by Ed brother Abraham when
[29:33] he was passing under the tree and God
[29:37] spoke to him he was a a a young man he
[29:40] was a young man he scared he ran to his
[29:43] father and murder God call him from the
[29:47] day that he was born so this gift God
[29:51] calls you said gift and calling I will
[29:54] die repentance amen Hal
[29:59] Hallelujah before I didn't know I never
[30:02] knew that I'm going to stand here to
[30:04] preach to stand anywhere to talk about
[30:06] God because I didn't know him but he
[30:09] know me he knows you
[30:13] amen one time I was 9 years old I was
[30:16] sitting outside playing and God spoke to
[30:19] me I didn't know what is that all of a
[30:21] sudden it just came to me just like that
[30:24] get up go here I went I scared but I
[30:29] didn't know where I'm going I went and
[30:32] the thing that God want to show me he
[30:36] show me amen and I came and brought the
[30:40] people and the thing was right there to
[30:42] manifest because was Act of sin that
[30:45] they know supposed to how do you know
[30:47] nothing about that how do you
[30:51] know every person that's sitting here
[30:56] God knew you before you here
[30:59] today there's a purpose in our life so
[31:03] if we leave to see that purpose you will
[31:07] see
[31:10] Hallelujah this man name man was a
[31:12] Syrian a great man a man of Honor Mighty
[31:17] Man of
[31:19] Valor sometime things happen to people
[31:22] they don't understand
[31:24] it your physical mind that's why every
[31:29] everything you everything you cannot put
[31:31] your mouth or your talk about it you
[31:35] don't know what God is
[31:39] doing just just just pray because you
[31:44] know whatever you speaking your
[31:47] Chambers God know about it before that
[31:51] talk comes to your mind God know about
[31:54] it you cannot fool God
[31:58] you can sit here that you are believer
[32:01] or you are God knows your heart the
[32:05] pastor did not know the pastor word the
[32:09] pastor job is to bring forth the word of
[32:11] God and you have to grasp
[32:14] it for for you to grow and maturity in
[32:19] the word of God so that when the time
[32:23] comes you have something to speak about
[32:26] God and God can take that word and
[32:29] manifest through to honor himself so if

[33:18] speak he go there and bring to your mind
[33:22] and when you speak something will take
[33:24] place Hallelujah this is this words
[33:28] this every time I Minister I want to let
[33:33] the people know that God that we serve
[33:37] is real it's not just we talk about the
[33:42] the Bible that is written here we want
[33:44] to bring the reality that the god that
[33:48] we serve is
[33:51] real it's not that we come to church to
[33:54] sit down to see one another but my my
[33:58] desire in my heart to present
[34:02] him real real to you that the god that
[34:06] we serve is real what is written here is
[34:09] these things that the Bible that we read
[34:12] every time is the people the same like
[34:15] you and me that happen and that they
[34:19] they they put in the book that this is
[34:22] what God did when Bible said he took the
[34:26] Israelites from there to Canaan it's not
[34:30] just a word it's not just letter it's
[34:33] reality and when he spoke to the prophet
[34:37] he put a mouth in the prophet all them
[34:39] from Moses to the Elijah to them those
[34:43] men was the same men like me and you
[34:46] that God chose them to speak through to
[34:50] bring to honor that word that he put
[34:53] inside there and those word that he
[34:56] spoke through them did this word here is
[34:58] still
[35:00] inspired every word in this BBL is
[35:05] inspired it can bring if you put that if
[35:08] you speak that word and you bring it to
[35:11] reality as God put it that inspiration
[35:15] will come and manifest exactly what is
[35:18] in the Bible amen hallelujah amen this
[35:21] is
[35:22] reality so when I come here my my desire
[35:27] is for the people to know the reality
[35:30] and the power of God that he has given
[35:33] to us that is not different than the
[35:37] those people that were there the the the
[35:40] the the the the the the
[35:44] disciples and the Israelites how God
[35:47] spoke to them this man here when that
[35:50] thing happened you know this man was a
[35:53] warrior and they went to
[35:56] Israel and capture a little a little
[36:00] Maid that to me that maid was a Believer
[36:05] up to now I would say he she was a
[36:09] Believer and they took her over there
[36:12] and that believer know and believe her
[36:16] God is
[36:18] God her God can heal
[36:21] sickness she said that man if he goes to
[36:26] that prophet
[36:28] you understand he will get his
[36:33] healing so that woman spoke that word
[36:38] reality and what that word that he spoke
[36:40] was inspired inspiration from
[36:44] God so that's why I'm saying when you
[36:47] hear the word in the PO the word comes
[36:50] to your heart and you believe that word
[36:52] can bring exactly manifestation as God
[36:55] wants us to bring it amen you think that
[36:58] lady he didn't hear
[37:01] Elijah she saw manifestation of the
[37:04] Israelites he knew that they have God do
[37:07] we have God the god of Abraham is the
[37:11] same God that is here today tonight she
[37:15] never changed that God never change
[37:18] hallelujah what he did through the
[37:22] prophet right now anything that God
[37:25] wants to do you will can do it here
[37:28] right now if the
[37:31] is sitting on the whe chair right here
[37:35] and God want to hear him the same time
[37:37] where how he did Brother she that criple
[37:40] will stand up and
[37:41] walk Hallelujah because the word that
[37:44] Prophet spoke was not the words of the
[37:47] Prophet himself it was the word of God
[37:50] in him coming out from that from that
[37:54] vessel that God has he has yielded
[37:57] himself to to manifest through
[38:00] Hallelujah so when we comes to church
[38:05] and the minister standing here the
[38:07] pastor standing here or any Minister
[38:09] standing here preaching is not just the
[38:12] word that he's bringing it's reality it
[38:15] can change anything any time any moment

[38:23] spoke the word this and that and I saw
[38:27] the manifestation of the word so when
[38:30] I'm preaching the gospel I am very very

[45:19] thing when something comes to
[45:22] you stand up have faith in God for every
[45:27] word that we hear from the poet here we
[45:30] are buil on the basis upon the word of
[45:33] God in this church here amen
[45:36] hallelujah this church is not just a
[45:38] normal
[45:39] church that is out there this is the
[45:42] Church of God the church the Lord Jesus
[45:46] Christ himself the message of the hour
[45:49] we stand upon the word of God hallelujah
[45:53] it's not by own listen here it doesn't
[45:55] matter how much education
[45:58] the person has he has nothing to do with
[46:01] that he
[46:03] has what God has placed in that person
[46:09] Hallelujah and then sometime we going to
[46:12] see here and when this man
[46:15] went he brought the letter to the king
[46:18] of
[46:19] Israel saying now when this letter comes
[46:23] to thee behold I have therewi with sent
[46:26] name and my servant to thee that thou
[46:30] might recover of his
[46:33] leprosy and see the answer of the king
[46:37] every word
[46:40] that God everything that God had made
[46:44] has he has to go to a perfect place
[46:48] before the manifestation
[46:50] comes and it came to pass when the king
[46:53] of Israel heard and read the letter and
[46:57] he ran his clothes and
[46:59] said am am am I God to kill and to make
[47:05] a life that this man do send unto me to
[47:10] recover a man of his
[47:14] leprosy consider I pray you and see how
[47:18] sick Sith to C against
[47:21] me the the King when he hear this man
[47:25] the letter he he was rough rent his
[47:30] Grove say he's not God how can he
[47:33] somebody that has a Ley and all those
[47:36] things he can cuz no these people they
[47:38] try to trick me they want to fight with
[47:42] me instead of Israelite he's supposed to
[47:45] know that every spiritual thing goes to
[47:48] who the
[47:50] prophet he he he he he he didn't
[47:54] recognize that's why I'm saying you have
[47:56] to recognize your position and who you
[48:01] are you understand in this church here
[48:04] we have a
[48:05] pastor that's Pastor Danny and we have
[48:10] ministers and Israelites every time they
[48:14] have a prophet they have prophets
[48:17] prophets God prophets too inside but God
[48:21] has chosen
[48:22] one that he has to work for the whole
[48:25] nation he the mouth PE of the whole
[48:28] nation see when God set up the church
[48:33] the pastor is he that God has chosen to
[48:38] stand for the
[48:40] flocks we ministers around him we are
[48:44] helpers yes so when God want to do
[48:47] anything he comes to the minister that
[48:50] word has to go to the pastor you can't
[48:54] take charge for what you because you a
[48:57] minister you have that same quality but
[49:01] God has chosen one man that's the pastor
[49:06] that that word has go
[49:08] through so he has to deal with the
[49:11] situation when he goes through then
[49:13] maybe he said he will God will speak
[49:16] through him send this one do this one do
[49:20] this one maybe you will send one of the
[49:23] ministers God will speak to him and and
[49:27] he would go will tell him what to do we
[49:31] are around him cannot tell him what to
[49:34] do because God knew him that all these
[49:39] flocks here God plac under his
[49:43] hands we are not responsible for the
[49:47] flocks of the church he is responsible
[49:51] for the flock of he is going to answer
[49:53] everything that he do for you and me
[49:55] amen so you never byass the pastor and
[50:00] speak through the you can you can you
[50:04] can speak because there's
[50:06] a there's a he has anointed us and put
[50:10] it in position that he can come through
[50:12] us when he comes through us we have to
[50:17] subject to him then he will do what God
[50:20] tells him to
[50:22] do you understand you don't take we
[50:25] don't take things our own hands so this
[50:31] man the case reach
[50:36] Elijah let me read
[50:40] here and it and it was so when
[50:43] elishah the man of God had heard that
[50:47] the king of Israel has ran his clothes
[50:51] that he sent to the king saying
[50:54] wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes
[50:56] close let him come now to me and he
[51:00] shall know that there is a prophet in
[51:06] Israel that King was not a
[51:09] prophet and the girl told him there's a
[51:14] prophet so the king supposed to know
[51:16] there's a prophet in Israel whom God
[51:19] speak
[51:21] through you understand so when anything
[51:24] happen God has chosen the man of God in
[51:28] this church the pastor that he does the
[51:33] spiritual things so anything that comes
[51:37] he has to go to him
[51:39] first before anything
[51:42] unless
[51:44] maybe we are outside and God want to use
[51:49] you and then God will tells
[51:52] you what to
[51:54] do and then you bring the message to the
[51:59] pastor what God has done through you and
[52:02] then the testimony come and what it
[52:05] honor God it glorify
[52:08] God so we don't take things our hands we
[52:12] have to put in the place where it
[52:15] belongs to a deacon the Tres they all
[52:19] has their position where the word of God
[52:23] has to be Hallelujah do you hear hear
[52:26] what I'm saying this is not my word this
[52:30] is the word of God
[52:34] hallelujah so so what happened there
