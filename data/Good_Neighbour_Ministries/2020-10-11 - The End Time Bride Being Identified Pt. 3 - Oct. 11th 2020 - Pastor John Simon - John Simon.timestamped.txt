[52:47] hallelujah the end time bride

[52:54] that is found in the book of john
[52:57] chapter 14 verses 19 to 20.
[53:02] i'll read the scripture and then i'll
[53:04] continue
[53:05] on on my speaking on
[53:09] the end time bride being identified i

[53:14] three of it and next week no doubt we'll
[53:16] have to continue
[53:27] let us pray father we thank you for the
[53:29] reading of your word we ask your
[53:31] blessing on the word
[53:32] we pray you will lift up your people
[53:34] together remember
[53:36] those that are across the world around
[53:39] the various nations of the world that
[53:42] are listening
[53:43] now oh god whether it be from
[53:47] colombia or or way over
[53:50] in romania wherever it is father may
[53:54] your spirit
[53:56] go forth bless your people
[53:59] in jesus name
[54:03] yet a little while and the world see it
[54:06] me no more
[54:08] but ye shall see me because
[54:11] i live you shall live also
[54:15] at that day you shall know
[54:18] that i am in the father and ye
[54:21] in me and i in you
[54:25] bless you please be seated
[54:31] uh now we when we spoke last week we
[54:35] touched on the fact that
[54:37] before the beginning god thought
[54:41] of his bride he thought of his bride
[54:46] and of course he thought of her in his
[54:48] mind
[54:50] so we were already in him before
[54:54] the foundation of the world in the
[54:57] dateless past of the eternities
[55:00] which there is no counting number years
[55:03] or time
[55:04] but we were already in his mind
[55:07] as a part of him now in the same way god
[55:12] wanting to portray
[55:13] that he did it in adam
[55:17] when he created adam and placed him here
[55:20] on the earth
[55:21] and the first adam
[55:25] came with his bride already in him
[55:30] and went because when god thought
[55:33] of him he thought of both of them
[55:37] but he thought of both of them as one
[55:40] and she was in him until the time
[55:44] or the hour came for her to be expressed
[55:49] now after the beginning jesus
[55:52] came on the scene now that's the same
[55:55] god with his bride
[55:57] in his mind but now
[56:00] in flesh the godhead bodily
[56:04] jesus christ comes with his bride
[56:08] already in him because when god thought
[56:12] of him of course he thought also of the
[56:14] bride
[56:15] that was in him and that is why
[56:18] when he as the old song says when
[56:21] when he was on the cross
[56:25] i was on his mind
[56:28] see we were in his mind before the
[56:30] foundations we were in his mind
[56:32] right at the cross at the moment when he
[56:34] was dying
[56:36] so that he could now release the bride
[56:38] just like
[56:39] adam had to be put to sleep god struck
[56:41] him he had to be put to sleep
[56:43] so the bride could be separated from him
[56:46] and have her own existence and
[56:49] manifestation
[56:51] that people would recognize her that she
[56:53] was his
[56:54] bride amen so we were in him
[56:59] that means we had representation in him
[57:03] uh that means that we had a theophany
[57:06] way back
[57:07] there uh that's we're not going to talk
[57:10] about that but we were in him
[57:12] or way back there we had our
[57:14] representation
[57:16] so that is why brother branham in the
[57:18] message called identified with christ
[57:21] when he died we died
[57:24] because we were in him so when he died
[57:27] we died
[57:28] when he rose up and and said that uh
[57:32] i am the resurrection and the life amen
[57:36] i'm the conqueror amen we were in him
[57:40] so he wasn't speaking just of himself
[57:44] that person jesus that was standing
[57:47] there
[57:48] but it was all of us in him
[57:52] praise god so rem always remember that
[57:56] that even though you may appear like a
[57:58] loser you may appear weak you may
[58:01] appear that you don't have this quality
[58:04] or that quality
[58:05] remember that satan trying to lie to
[58:08] your
[58:08] outward mind because you are already
[58:12] an overcomer in him
[58:15] you already overcome the world you
[58:18] already overcome the flesh you already
[58:20] overcome the devil
[58:21] you overcome everything he could throw
[58:24] against you
[58:25] praise god and your rose up
[58:29] and we are proving it again that is the
[58:32] same
[58:32] yesterday today and forever brother
[58:35] branham said the devil tried to kill you
[58:37] with sin
[58:38] but he said you rose up again above the
[58:41] world didn't you
[58:42] he said you rose up again above the
[58:44] flesh didn't you amen
[58:46] your rose up above denomination and
[58:48] everything else because
[58:50] you are overcomers by the promise of the
[58:53] holy spirit
[58:54] that is in you praise god hallelujah
[58:58] i said hallelujah somebody said
[59:01] hallelujah
[59:04] hallelujah glory to god amen
[59:08] amen praise god and while speaking on
[59:11] that
[59:12] i just dropped along the thought that
[59:15] then we see the truth
[59:17] of the fact that god's original plan
[59:20] was that the man carried the woman in
[59:23] him
[59:25] but then satan by his deceit lies
[59:29] and perversion of god's way and god's
[59:33] plan
[59:34] he twisted the thing the other way
[59:37] and brought it from creation to
[59:40] procreation
[59:42] and then lied to her until you shall be
[59:45] a creator
[59:46] you shall be as gods and so
[59:49] she began to bring forth man
[59:52] so now the woman carries the man in her
[59:55] and now the churches have memberships
[59:58] and
[59:58] they uh try to bring you to a new birth
[1:00:03] which is contrary to the word of god
[1:00:06] the man the word brings you to a new
[1:00:09] birth
[1:00:11] he brings you to the place where you
[1:00:13] know who you
[1:00:14] are and where you came from and where
[1:00:17] you are going praise
[1:00:18] be to god aren't you happy to recognize
[1:00:21] that we are of the lord and savior jesus
[1:00:25] christ
[1:00:27] we further show that with the many
[1:00:30] identifications
[1:00:32] of the bribe being identified the the
[1:00:35] final and the foremost identifier
[1:00:39] jesus was identified that indeed he
[1:00:43] was the christ by his resurrection
[1:00:47] by his ascension it could not be
[1:00:50] doubted any longer because
[1:00:53] as he said in john chapter 3 verse 3
[1:00:57] no man can rise up and go back to heaven
[1:01:00] unless he first came down from heaven
[1:01:03] and the bride will identify herself
[1:01:07] in the rapture because the rapture
[1:01:10] identifies her of who she is
[1:01:13] it's nothing she has to do nothing she
[1:01:15] has to say
[1:01:16] but god identifying her of the gift of
[1:01:20] eternal life that he already placed in
[1:01:22] her well
[1:01:24] identify her that she is that bride
[1:01:28] and raise her up praise god and take her
[1:01:31] away
[1:01:31] for his glory so the bride will be
[1:01:35] identified by her going
[1:01:37] in her rapture and god
[1:01:40] as we know will only rapture his
[1:01:44] original
[1:01:44] thoughts he's not going to rapture a
[1:01:47] church he's not going to rapture any
[1:01:49] denomination
[1:01:50] of any particular name but he is going
[1:01:53] to
[1:01:54] rapture his original thoughts
[1:01:58] for the man's thoughts and himself
[1:02:02] are one and we are
[1:02:05] one with him praise the lord
[1:02:08] so he's not going to rapture any church
[1:02:11] he's rupturing his word
[1:02:13] he's rapturing himself he's rapturing
[1:02:17] all of us that were in him so while we
[1:02:20] are here
[1:02:21] we must be identified with the word of
[1:02:24] god
[1:02:26] while you are here line up your life
[1:02:28] with the word of god
[1:02:31] show that you are one with him
[1:02:34] praise god listen brother brandon
[1:02:37] speaking
[1:02:38] the word the evening message
[1:02:42] must bring evening results
[1:02:45] the evening message must saw
[1:02:49] evening seeds not mourning seeds
[1:02:52] but evening seeds the midday
[1:02:55] scene those seeds see it
[1:02:58] died it perished but evening time
[1:03:02] message will show evening time
[1:03:05] light will show evening time
[1:03:08] results and bring an evening time
[1:03:12] message now jesus came with a
[1:03:16] midday message and he got
[1:03:20] midday results the beginning message
[1:03:24] got beginning results when they
[1:03:27] when god made creation
[1:03:30] see that was the result of the
[1:03:34] beginning message he made his son
[1:03:38] in his own image in the
[1:03:41] midday in the evening time he makes the
[1:03:44] bride
[1:03:46] and all this by what the word
[1:03:51] all by the word in the beginning you
[1:03:55] know god said let there be let there be
[1:03:56] let there be
[1:03:58] with jesus gabriel had to come and say
[1:04:01] you shall receive a son his name shall
[1:04:03] be he spoke the word
[1:04:05] praise god hallelujah and now in the
[1:04:08] last day
[1:04:09] god sends a prophet who speaks the word
[1:04:12] of god again
[1:04:13] to a bride to bring forth her
[1:04:17] amen how did he do it from the earth
[1:04:20] he's how did he speak it into existence
[1:04:23] by his word
[1:04:24] who was his son the word in the
[1:04:28] beginning was
[1:04:29] the lord and the word was with god
[1:04:33] and the word was god
[1:04:36] and that word which was god was
[1:04:40] made flesh and dwelt among
[1:04:44] us then how will he take his bride there
[1:04:49] how will he identify her
[1:04:52] by his lord praise god
[1:04:56] glory so how are you identified
[1:04:59] how is the end time bride identified by
[1:05:02] the word
[1:05:04] by accepting the word by
[1:05:07] catching a revelation of the word
[1:05:10] you're identifying that you are a part
[1:05:13] of him
[1:05:14] and the deep is calling back to the deep
[1:05:17] and
[1:05:17] god is seeing god hallelujah
[1:05:21] praise god you are identifying yourself
[1:05:25] that you are a part of him
[1:05:28] because you will not be able to
[1:05:31] interpret
[1:05:32] understand recognize and know god unless
[1:05:35] it's god in you recognizing himself
[1:05:40] praise god for it's the amen who blesses
[1:05:44] himself
[1:05:45] in the amen he will take his bride by
[1:05:48] the word
[1:05:49] now you remember when eliezer went to
[1:05:52] find a bride for isaac
[1:05:56] i think that's genesis chapter 24 you
[1:05:58] want to read that
[1:05:59] the rest of the week you can read that
[1:06:01] chapter you can study it
[1:06:02] you can laugh you can cry you can
[1:06:04] rejoice but in that
[1:06:06] chapter eliezer abraham
[1:06:09] told him what qualities he'd like to
[1:06:12] have in this
[1:06:13] brain that he wanted for his son and so
[1:06:16] when eliezer went he got to
[1:06:19] a place where there was a well and while
[1:06:21] he was there
[1:06:22] you know he said oh my lord let it be so
[1:06:26] that uh how will i know this woman how
[1:06:29] well may i be able to identify
[1:06:32] this woman that she is the bride for my
[1:06:35] my master's son and so
[1:06:38] he gave out the requirements
[1:06:42] and so when he came and he sat with his
[1:06:45] camels
[1:06:46] by the well rebecca
[1:06:49] was there and she came now
[1:06:52] do you know that she didn't ask him what
[1:06:56] he wanted
[1:06:56] she said oh sir you are tired and your
[1:07:00] camels must be thirsty let me
[1:07:03] fetch some water and she started to
[1:07:06] fetch water
[1:07:07] without her masking so what was in his
[1:07:10] mind
[1:07:11] she started to live it she started to
[1:07:14] act it out
[1:07:15] so her deeds began to identify her
[1:07:22] her life begins to identify her
[1:07:26] of who she was so he kept looking he
[1:07:30] kept looking
[1:07:31] and you know her words identified her
[1:07:34] because she literally asked to go and do
[1:07:36] this job
[1:07:37] to go and quench the thirst of these
[1:07:41] uh camels i won't give you that but you
[1:07:43] know
[1:07:44] one camel alone drink so many gallons
[1:07:46] and gallons which is
[1:07:48] buckets and buckets of water and he had
[1:07:50] several camels
[1:07:51] and she went and quenched the thirst of
[1:07:53] all those camels
[1:07:55] plus him ask him does he want a drink of
[1:07:58] water
[1:07:59] and everything else so her words her
[1:08:02] deeds
[1:08:03] and when he looked at her her nature
[1:08:06] what was inside of her her nature
[1:08:09] identify her
[1:08:11] so her words identify her deeds identify
[1:08:14] her
[1:08:14] and her nature that she had identified
[1:08:18] her
[1:08:20] so she didn't have to say anything he
[1:08:22] already knew
[1:08:23] she was the bride for his master and so
[1:08:26] is the end time bride objectified by her
[1:08:31] words her works and her deeds her nature
[1:08:34] that is in her praise god
[1:08:38] doesn't have to work up anything she
[1:08:39] doesn't have to be an actor or
[1:08:41] actress or anything like that it's just
[1:08:44] flowing out of her
[1:08:45] because it's god in her amen god in
[1:08:49] christ
[1:08:49] god in the church god in the bride amen
[1:08:52] moving forth his great
[1:08:54] activity in this wonderful end time
[1:08:57] praise god so god will according to his
[1:09:01] word
[1:09:02] he'll identify her don't you put
[1:09:05] one thing to it don't add one thing to
[1:09:08] it don't become an actor and anything
[1:09:10] like that
[1:09:11] but leave it the way that it is
[1:09:14] the evening time he promised it revealed
[1:09:17] uh law
[1:09:18] open these seven seals
[1:09:22] and show them to the churches
[1:09:25] that had missed back there and make
[1:09:29] known to them
[1:09:30] revelation 10 malachi 4 luke 17 30
[1:09:34] he said he would do it doing god's
[1:09:36] service without
[1:09:37] doing his will praise god so we won't go
[1:09:41] in the rapture then because of what
[1:09:43] church we belong to
[1:09:45] we won't go in it because of uh
[1:09:48] we we are worshippers there's a lot of
[1:09:51] worshipers
[1:09:52] you know people in any religion worship
[1:09:55] god
[1:09:57] i mean even the chickens worship god i
[1:09:59] mean they know when they drink water
[1:10:02] to raise their head up at least like
[1:10:04] that
[1:10:05] so the water can go down their throat so
[1:10:07] they give praise to god
[1:10:08] also amen so you're only going to go
[1:10:12] if you are identified in and with the
[1:10:16] word
[1:10:18] praise god hallelujah amen
[1:10:21] so friends i'm just so happy for that
[1:10:24] that we must be identified with the word
[1:10:27] because
[1:10:28] that makes it an individual thing
[1:10:31] we don't go because all of us
[1:10:34] uh as a group suddenly
[1:10:38] um hold on to certain
[1:10:41] written truths that some church gave us
[1:10:45] but even though brother branham has
[1:10:47] tapes and books and
[1:10:48] and quotations like that that's not even
[1:10:51] it
[1:10:52] but it's the revelation of the word of
[1:10:55] god that
[1:10:56] identifies you to god and to yourself
[1:11:00] that i am one of them praise god
[1:11:04] hallelujah praise god
[1:11:08] now we know of course that jesus didn't
[1:11:10] suffer from any spiritual amnesia
[1:11:13] he knew who he was he knew he had a work
[1:11:17] to do he had a mission to die
[1:11:19] and he didn't have any spiritual amnesia
[1:11:23] praise god so when john spoke and said
[1:11:27] behold the lamb of god amen that taketh
[1:11:31] away the sins of the world
[1:11:34] john was only reinforcing
[1:11:37] who he knew he already was
[1:11:41] amen but when we came we had spiritual
[1:11:44] amnesia
[1:11:46] we didn't know who we were at all
[1:11:49] so god had to send a prophet and the
[1:11:52] prophet had to
[1:11:53] preach the word in such a way uh
[1:11:56] you know and take you and i back
[1:11:59] like you would take an amnesiac person
[1:12:02] back to their original school room
[1:12:05] back to their old family
[1:12:08] back to the old neighborhood walk them
[1:12:11] through the same street
[1:12:13] take them back to their old home
[1:12:16] you know or close to it so they start to
[1:12:19] get some
[1:12:19] kind of reaction so god sent a prophet
[1:12:24] and the prophet started to preach the
[1:12:27] word
[1:12:27] to bring us back to familiar places
[1:12:32] familiar places in the world
[1:12:35] praise god so when he quoted certain
[1:12:38] scriptures
[1:12:39] when he told certain things it was
[1:12:42] all designed by god almighty
[1:12:46] to be able to bring us and draw us back
[1:12:49] to our original uh our original
[1:12:52] place and position where we were
[1:12:56] and thank god i woke up
[1:13:00] i thank god i woke up
[1:13:03] i hope you woke up
[1:13:06] amen and just as it did
[1:13:10] with jesus with brother branham it did
[1:13:14] the same thing with me
[1:13:15] it made me become even more
[1:13:18] certain of god i
[1:13:21] began to recognize who i was
[1:13:26] amen hallelujah oh
[1:13:29] my as that prophet began to preach the
[1:13:32] word of god
[1:13:33] i told the story of the little boy
[1:13:37] i think in kentucky the people were so
[1:13:39] poor
[1:13:40] to have a big mirror was a hard thing to
[1:13:43] do so
[1:13:44] whenever they'd find a piece of mirror
[1:13:46] somewhere
[1:13:47] they'd tuck it on a tree or or or put
[1:13:50] two nails to hold it up in the house
[1:13:52] and saw this little boy had never seen a
[1:13:55] mirror
[1:13:55] before in his life and so going to visit
[1:13:59] his grandmother
[1:14:00] there he was and he
[1:14:03] decided he he saw this mirror and then
[1:14:06] he looked
[1:14:07] uh he saw another little boy in the
[1:14:10] mirror
[1:14:11] and when he moved the little boy moved
[1:14:14] and he was he's puzzled by it so he kept
[1:14:17] looking in the mirror
[1:14:18] when he moved his hand the little boy
[1:14:20] moved his hand and
[1:14:21] he just caught up with it and his
[1:14:24] parents are looking at him
[1:14:25] and then after a while the realization
[1:14:29] struck him
[1:14:30] just like how the revelation struck you
[1:14:34] because we were listening to the word
[1:14:37] for many years and you're hearing what
[1:14:40] the prophet's saying
[1:14:41] for many years and you you can say yes i
[1:14:44] see this i see that yeah you saw it it
[1:14:46] is there you're seeing it
[1:14:48] but yeah you don't have the recognition
[1:14:51] of what you're seeing
[1:14:52] you don't have the revelation i think
[1:14:54] brother branham said somewhere
[1:14:56] he said if you don't have that
[1:14:57] recognition he says
[1:14:59] i can send you to the barn for a hammer
[1:15:02] but you don't know what the hammer is so
[1:15:05] you can bring me a saw
[1:15:06] you can bring me something else because
[1:15:08] you don't have the
[1:15:10] recognition of what it is praise god
[1:15:13] hallelujah but thank god he opened our
[1:15:17] understanding by the revelation
[1:15:20] of the word praise god you you
[1:15:24] read about this young boy in uh uh three
[1:15:27] uh
[1:15:28] you know three kinds of believers i
[1:15:29] think it's paragraph two
[1:15:31] seven to three where he said mama
[1:15:34] that's me that's me
[1:15:38] i'm seeing myself in the mirror praise
[1:15:41] god
[1:15:42] and you know god's word is a mirror and
[1:15:45] when you
[1:15:45] look into the word of god as it begins
[1:15:48] to unfold
[1:15:50] that is why when a real preacher is
[1:15:53] preaching the word
[1:15:55] and you sit there you want to know how
[1:15:58] in the world does that man know that
[1:16:01] i was just talking about so-so in my car
[1:16:05] i was just thinking so and so or i
[1:16:08] wanted this right desire that it's not
[1:16:11] anything to do with the man but he's
[1:16:14] showing you the word
[1:16:15] and the words making you see yourself
[1:16:19] in the mirror you're hearing about
[1:16:22] yourself
[1:16:22] you're looking at yourself in the world
[1:16:25] amen
[1:16:26] praise god it's so real glory to god
[1:16:30] hallelujah that before you come out in
[1:16:33] the morning you
[1:16:34] look at yourself in the mirror praise
[1:16:36] god
[1:16:37] amen yes sir glory to god hallelujah
[1:16:41] and so the bride is supposed to look in
[1:16:43] the word
[1:16:44] and recognize her position
[1:16:48] glory to god hallelujah as
[1:16:51] wonderful as all these things are i am
[1:16:54] so
[1:16:54] thankful to god for his blessed
[1:16:57] and holy word amen
[1:17:01] question and answers on the seals now we
[1:17:04] come back with the seals
[1:17:06] open that seal god opens the seal
[1:17:10] for us what's that first
[1:17:14] a messenger to the church age amen
[1:17:17] comes then he opens the seals you know
[1:17:21] what happens when the sea lopes the
[1:17:23] prophet said the spiritual war breaks
[1:17:26] out
[1:17:26] because when that messenger opens that
[1:17:29] the seal is open
[1:17:31] and it declares the truth it reveals
[1:17:34] truth and error and shows you how far
[1:17:36] away from the word
[1:17:38] these churches have drifted and then
[1:17:40] when they
[1:17:41] hear you with the truth is contrary to
[1:17:44] what they've been teaching
[1:17:46] and it will break up and tear down their
[1:17:49] denomination
[1:17:50] if they allow it and let it so they've
[1:17:53] got to block it they have to destroy it
[1:17:55] they have to disparage it
[1:17:56] and discounted in every possible way
[1:18:00] hallelujah but we stay with the word of
[1:18:03] god hallelujah
[1:18:05] spiritual war breaks out and then
[1:18:09] the seven seals amen
[1:18:12] then we see the corruption
[1:18:17] we are able to see the corruption that
[1:18:20] hit the church ages
[1:18:22] email but this seventh seal
[1:18:26] doesn't reveal anything in other words
[1:18:28] he's saying the sixth seal reveals all
[1:18:30] the corruption down through those
[1:18:32] those ages there the six seals do that
[1:18:36] but now when the seventh seal was open
[1:18:38] if you go to your seal book and you read
[1:18:40] the seven seal
[1:18:41] it doesn't reveal anything praise god
[1:18:45] that you could see with your eyes or
[1:18:47] hear and you say well what's the
[1:18:49] use of that seventh seal amen
[1:18:52] it doesn't reveal anything that's going
[1:18:54] to happen does it
[1:18:55] see because at the end of the church
[1:18:58] ages
[1:18:59] is to come a prophetic gift to reveal
[1:19:03] these things
[1:19:04] are you following amen praise god
[1:19:08] glory to his wonderful name one
[1:19:11] we know now that the seventh seal
[1:19:14] was the mysterious coming of christ
[1:19:18] hallelujah we also
[1:19:22] know and if we don't know we ought to
[1:19:23] know that the
[1:19:25] bride herself is that seventh seal
[1:19:29] that is now broken by the lamb himself
[1:19:34] now the unveiling of the mighty god
[1:19:38] now as one quotation here says
[1:19:41] now in the unveiling of god it is now
[1:19:44] jehovah
[1:19:45] taking the veil off of god hallelujah
[1:19:49] amen
[1:19:50] it's the artist taking the cover from
[1:19:53] off
[1:19:54] of the masterpiece praise god hallelujah
[1:19:58] she's being unveiled to the entire world
[1:20:02] just before she's raptured out of here
[1:20:05] of who she is amen the veil being
[1:20:09] taken off of her glory to god amen
[1:20:12] you see they put a lot of emphasis on
[1:20:15] signs ones and miracles
[1:20:16] they think she's got to be she got to be
[1:20:18] identified by
[1:20:19] signs wonders miracles and big revivals
[1:20:23] and everything else like that and it's
[1:20:25] nothing of the kind
[1:20:27] she is revealed by her identification
[1:20:31] of our obedience to his preeminence of
[1:20:35] his word
[1:20:36] and she walks with the word all
[1:20:39] through the world in white
[1:20:42] praise god aren't you happy friends

[1:20:58] as i told you i was on the mountain i
[1:21:00] saw where the rocks were blasted
[1:21:02] the word eagle was still in the rock
[1:21:05] until it got
[1:21:06] dug out but i saw it there but to us it
[1:21:09] was so sacred we wouldn't touch anything
[1:21:11] my god and then after those seven angels
[1:21:15] had spoken
[1:21:16] to the prophet of malachi 4 william
[1:21:19] barry and branham
[1:21:20] then they went back up and as they were
[1:21:23] going back up
[1:21:24] 30 miles up that science took the
[1:21:27] picture
[1:21:28] and the entire picture was in
[1:21:32] the face of jesus christ
[1:21:35] doing god's service in two sons

[1:21:59] how could this happen there is no fog up
[1:22:02] there there is no air there is no
[1:22:04] moisture 30 miles high up there

[1:22:49] and they are they which testify of
[1:22:52] the word amen they are there
[1:22:55] that testify of the truth these
[1:22:59] things that god is now doing

[1:23:27] that when the wise men were trying to
[1:23:31] journey to the full born word
[1:23:35] for two years the signs were in the
[1:23:38] heavens
[1:23:39] and when they saw those
[1:23:42] that's those stars and lying in the
[1:23:44] heavens they realized
[1:23:46] if the stars in the heavens messiah must
[1:23:49] be on the earth
[1:23:50] now lord of god if the son of man
[1:23:54] appears in the cloud in the heavens

[1:24:30] be revealed in the last day
[1:24:34] when the seventh angel's message
[1:24:37] now listen remember this not when he
[1:24:41] stands out
[1:24:44] not when he starts out doing this
[1:24:48] but when he begins to sound his message
[1:24:53] see not in his years
[1:24:57] of preparation
[1:25:00] but when he begins to sound the message
[1:25:05] then these mysteries then
[1:25:08] they will be revealed and here we are
[1:25:12] not knowing them and you people
[1:25:15] are now witnesses of that
[1:25:19] that observatory that cloud in the
[1:25:22] heavens over twosome
[1:25:24] oh my doesn't anybody recognize it
[1:25:28] hallelujah oh praise god
[1:25:31] now let me say this to you my brothers
[1:25:34] and sisters
[1:25:34] that you might recognize clearly what
[1:25:37] i'm
[1:25:38] saying here amen not when the messenger
[1:25:42] started out not under the first ball
[1:25:46] not under the second pole hallelujah
[1:25:50] first ball healing second paul
[1:25:53] discernment of
[1:25:54] spirits but the third pull straight to
[1:25:57] the soul amen
[1:25:59] praise god the word calls the bride
[1:26:02] the word identifies the bride the spirit
[1:26:05] of god
[1:26:06] begins to reach her praise god those
[1:26:09] first two was just
[1:26:10] a gathering all of the fishes inside of
[1:26:12] the barrel
[1:26:13] inside of the boat amen and then the
[1:26:16] word himself comes
[1:26:18] and begin to identify her praise god
[1:26:21] not in the years of preparation
[1:26:25] now i know why he used that you know the
[1:26:27] life of jesus christ if you study the
[1:26:29] life of christ
[1:26:30] is actually divided into three parts
[1:26:34] amen the years of preparation
[1:26:38] then the years of popularity
[1:26:41] and then when he died the years of
[1:26:43] persecution
[1:26:45] and that's a simple way to break up
[1:26:48] break down the life
[1:26:49] of jesus christ and that's why in the
[1:26:52] ending of the
[1:26:53] his ministry he had to preach on on the
[1:26:56] in
[1:26:56] i indict this generation for the
[1:26:59] crucifixion
[1:27:00] amen second crucifixion amen of
[1:27:04] jesus christ praise god hallelujah while
[1:27:07] god doesn't do things in twos it got to
[1:27:08] be three
[1:27:09] and the third one is not going to be him
[1:27:11] it's going to be her
[1:27:12] praise the lord she's going to be
[1:27:14] criticized she's going to be
[1:27:15] called all kinds of names and everything
[1:27:18] else like that
[1:27:18] you see praise god ours is not so much
[1:27:21] the physical but spiritually
[1:27:23] and so we have to carry the reproach
[1:27:27] for the world so not when he begins to
[1:27:30] sound out the message
[1:27:32] some i mean begin to start out with his
[1:27:34] preparation
[1:27:35] but then he begins to sound the trumpet
[1:27:38] begins to
[1:27:39] call the bride to attention of the word
[1:27:42] of god
[1:27:43] hallelujah and it catches her and that
[1:27:47] word
[1:27:47] takes a hold of her heart amen
[1:27:50] praise god page 466 of the sealed book
[1:27:55] amen hallelujah those church ages are
[1:27:58] revealed
[1:27:59] amen the messenger begins to sound
[1:28:02] when he sounds the seals begin to open
[1:28:06] up the message of the seven church ages
[1:28:10] what does that do war is declared amen
[1:28:14] praise god and that war declared
[1:28:17] then the seventh seal is preached
[1:28:20] and opened up and it appears like
[1:28:24] there's
[1:28:24] nothing in it praise god but
[1:28:28] for the bride there was something in it
[1:28:32] hallelujah because it shows
[1:28:35] her herself she sees
[1:28:39] the mystery coming of christ hallelujah
[1:28:43] not in jesus but in a
[1:28:46] bright form she sees
[1:28:49] his coming again praise god and that
[1:28:52] spirit comes down
[1:28:53] the holy spirit anointing comes to its
[1:28:56] body
[1:28:57] predestinated for the hour to use it for
[1:29:00] his glory
[1:29:01] and for his honor amen
[1:29:04] oh my think about it when god came
[1:29:07] down revelation 10 the mighty angel
[1:29:10] which we know the covenant angel the
[1:29:13] prophet said is jesus christ
[1:29:14] himself revelation 10 went to revelation
[1:29:19] 10 7. i've said it before and went and
[1:29:22] began to use the body
[1:29:24] of revelation 10 7
[1:29:28] to fulfill the scriptures for this hour
[1:29:31] amen fulfill luke 17 30 and 21
[1:29:36] son of man been revealed to fulfill many
[1:29:40] other scriptures joy
[1:29:41] fulfilled john revelation revelation 10
[1:29:45] 7 amen malachi 4 5 that the angel of god
[1:29:50] would begin to fulfill those various
[1:29:53] scriptures that god had prophesied in
[1:29:56] this
[1:29:57] hour praise god hallelujah well you know
[1:30:00] the first six seals
[1:30:04] manifest identified of course jesus
[1:30:07] christ
[1:30:07] and how he was walking up and down among
[1:30:11] the
[1:30:11] seven candlesticks and how
[1:30:14] he loved the church died for the church
[1:30:17] and loosed her
[1:30:18] with his own blood amen
[1:30:22] praise god but those same six seals
[1:30:25] also identified the false church it
[1:30:28] identified the
[1:30:30] mystery of inequity manifested in the
[1:30:34] four horsemen coming down through the
[1:30:36] ages
[1:30:37] trail of the serpent the evil deeds of
[1:30:40] satan
[1:30:41] and all of his works amen it shows
[1:30:45] and reveals his deceit in the garden and
[1:30:47] his damnation to the pits of hell
[1:30:50] in the book of revelation praise
[1:30:53] god hallelujah oh my but in
[1:30:56] this seventh seal hallelujah we find
[1:30:59] friends
[1:31:00] that identify the bride of who she is
[1:31:05] by god interpreting himself through her
[1:31:09] interpreting his own word god is his
[1:31:12] own interpreter and only he could bring
[1:31:15] her
[1:31:16] to life again to recognize who
[1:31:19] she was praise god hallelujah
[1:31:22] so just as god did that true brother
[1:31:25] branham fulfilled
[1:31:27] the prophecies about about
[1:31:30] this gentile prophet in this age he
[1:31:33] also fulfilled this end-time
[1:31:36] scriptures that are supposed to be
[1:31:38] fulfilled
[1:31:39] he uses the bride to do that
[1:31:42] see he used brother branham to fulfill
[1:31:46] malachi 4 5 revelation
[1:31:48] 10 uh you know luke 17 30 and things
[1:31:51] like that
[1:31:52] in a partial form and now he is
[1:31:55] literally
[1:31:56] using his many membered body so it is
[1:31:59] becoming unto us
[1:32:00] to fulfill all righteousness it's
[1:32:03] becoming for the holy spirit
[1:32:06] to work through us and to fulfill all
[1:32:09] righteousness praise god and for you to
[1:32:12] do that
[1:32:12] you're going to have to bear the
[1:32:13] reproach for the world i said you're
[1:32:15] going to have to wait a reproach for the
[1:32:17] word
[1:32:18] because now remember excuse me
[1:32:21] now you're carrying the word
[1:32:25] are you or is the word carrying you
[1:32:28] but in any case what i'm saying is that
[1:32:32] you're going to have to
[1:32:33] bear the reproach of that pregnancy
[1:32:36] because it's going to reveal you it's
[1:32:37] going to identify you
[1:32:39] it's going to show you who you are and
[1:32:41] you're going to have to
[1:32:42] bear the reproach for the word of god
[1:32:45] amen
[1:32:46] every one of us we're going to have to
[1:32:47] bear that reproach for the word of god
[1:32:49] he said but i don't see it yet but let
[1:32:51] me tell you it's coming down
[1:32:53] slowly the devil knows how to bring
[1:32:56] pressure
[1:32:57] and he brings it slow slow you don't
[1:32:59] hardly know that pressure is coming down
[1:33:01] on you little by little pressure is
[1:33:03] coming down
[1:33:04] amen by the time you wake up you're
[1:33:06] already caught up in the middle
[1:33:08] of it and there's nothing more you can
[1:33:09] do praise god
[1:33:11] but thank god we've been prepared by the
[1:33:14] word of god
[1:33:15] for this hour praise god hallelujah
[1:33:18] amen how wonderful it is to know that we
[1:33:21] are
[1:33:22] part of him now i'm looking at the
[1:33:24] unveiling of god
[1:33:27] paragraph 122 now what is this
[1:33:31] what's this revival belong to now
[1:33:35] how could it ever prosper them talking
[1:33:39] of revival
[1:33:40] how could it be like that
[1:33:43] don't they understand when moses
[1:33:47] went out amen you remember
[1:33:50] of course that brother branham spoke as
[1:33:52] i was with moses so shall i be with thee
[1:33:54] he typed himself dr moses
[1:33:57] so and so and like that he says now
[1:34:00] when moses went out remember
[1:34:04] that when he gathered the people
[1:34:07] it was a mixed multitude
[1:34:12] that went out with him see a mixed
[1:34:15] multitude
[1:34:16] but the difference between them
[1:34:20] right and wrong it's for what was it
[1:34:24] what's it done for so that jehovah
[1:34:28] himself can take the veil
[1:34:32] off of god to
[1:34:35] show the difference between right and
[1:34:38] wrong
[1:34:40] methodist presbyterian
[1:34:44] what's right to show the difference
[1:34:47] between
[1:34:48] right and wrong but god's word is right
[1:34:52] amen now catch that subtle thought there
[1:34:56] he is saying there that he's gonna prove
[1:34:59] that all of these denominations are
[1:35:01] wrong
[1:35:02] but god's manifested word for the
[1:35:05] hour that's right he's going to show it
[1:35:08] that that's right they are right that
[1:35:11] word
[1:35:11] in them is right and no matter how big
[1:35:14] these giants have become
[1:35:16] and everything like that they are still
[1:35:20] right
[1:35:21] so moses left with a mixed multitude
[1:35:24] amen
[1:35:25] but only joshua and caleb met married
[1:35:28] over the other side amen praise god
[1:35:32] he identifies his bride
[1:35:35] by unveiling himself in her
[1:35:39] praise god taking the veil
[1:35:42] off of god himself praise god
[1:35:46] amen it's a hidden mystery but it's
[1:35:48] written in the word
[1:35:50] it's written in the word and there you
[1:35:53] find it praise the lord hallelujah
[1:35:56] you see the rest the other church ages
[1:35:59] were not
[1:35:59] raptured amen they died in faith but
[1:36:02] they weren't raptured
[1:36:05] not because they weren't worthy like us
[1:36:07] but they yet did not have
[1:36:09] all of the truth see that's
[1:36:12] all so they without us cannot be made
[1:36:15] perfect
[1:36:17] they have to wait until
[1:36:20] all of the word is unveiled to us
[1:36:24] and then being encompassed with this
[1:36:26] cloud of witnesses
[1:36:28] they have to watch and see what we are
[1:36:30] going to do with this world
[1:36:32] how we're going to react to it but that
[1:36:35] this word of god in us
[1:36:38] now that has come to the confirmation of
[1:36:41] all the ages
[1:36:42] and the entire fullness of it has been
[1:36:45] deposited
[1:36:47] all the word of god in christ amen
[1:36:50] all in him bodily praise god
[1:36:54] that word now come down in the bright
[1:36:56] form
[1:36:57] of a son of man form and now
[1:37:00] watch that word make itself manifest
[1:37:03] within that bride praise the name of the
[1:37:05] lord so they did not have
[1:37:07] all of the words so they could not come
[1:37:09] to full obedience
[1:37:11] they could not come to their complete
[1:37:13] and total
[1:37:14] placing in jesus christ praise god
[1:37:17] hallelujah uh you you remember when uh
[1:37:21] christ is a mischief god revealed when
[1:37:23] brother brahm said
[1:37:25] oh i just looked at the clock it's two
[1:37:28] o'clock
[1:37:29] oh praise god he says the fastful is
[1:37:33] over
[1:37:34] the second pull is over the third pull
[1:37:37] is at hand
[1:37:38] glory god amen hallelujah
[1:37:41] oh my his announcing their presence
[1:37:45] their rival the manifestation
[1:37:48] the interpretation of the bride the word
[1:37:52] of god in bright form
[1:37:54] hallelujah oh water our
[1:37:57] glory to god hallelujah in the same
[1:38:01] message right in the same paragraph
[1:38:05] he says did you notice that we are
[1:38:07] singing
[1:38:08] and suddenly i said that and the singing
[1:38:11] went into a higher octave
[1:38:13] oh my praise god the whole thing has
[1:38:16] gone into a higher octave
[1:38:20] do you know that even some brethren
[1:38:22] wouldn't even
[1:38:24] can't follow what we're even talking
[1:38:26] about here now
[1:38:28] it's gone into a higher octave
[1:38:31] completely
[1:38:32] praise the name of the lord jesus
[1:38:34] hallelujah
[1:38:35] and so the seven thunders are now
[1:38:40] or is now identifying the bride
[1:38:43] the seven thunder's the voice of god the
[1:38:46] revealed voice of god
[1:38:47] making itself known praise the name of
[1:38:49] the lord hallelujah
[1:38:51] because the years of preparation did not
[1:38:53] place the bride
[1:38:54] it didn't position the bride or didn't
[1:38:57] identify
[1:38:58] the bride whatsoever not when not until
[1:39:01] when he started
[1:39:02] to open up the seals and
[1:39:06] that is what began to catch the bride's
[1:39:08] attention
[1:39:09] the word grab more of our attention
[1:39:12] praise god
[1:39:14] oh my remember brother sister
[1:39:19] before i read about brother brandon's
[1:39:24] books i was seeing
[1:39:26] miracles signs and wonders
[1:39:30] it was marvelous brother branham came
[1:39:33] along
[1:39:34] but he was just another another great
[1:39:37] evangelist
[1:39:38] velma gardner w v grant a.a
[1:39:41] allen oral roberts many of them with
[1:39:44] miracle signs and wonders
[1:39:47] and everything else like that but
[1:39:50] when that man began to speak the word
[1:39:54] i would read about i would read some of
[1:39:57] his messages
[1:39:58] in and now the funk publication called
[1:40:02] the herald of his coming
[1:40:05] from lost pines california and
[1:40:08] there my brother i would read his
[1:40:10] message and
[1:40:11] i actually started to collect those
[1:40:14] things to read his
[1:40:15] messages because there were
[1:40:18] in one part the entire thing and i think
[1:40:21] the prophet mentioned it
[1:40:22] he said they're always saying god send
[1:40:25] us an elijah
[1:40:26] we need an elijah in this hour we need
[1:40:28] the spirit of elijah
[1:40:30] to bring the word of god down to us
[1:40:33] everything else at that time i didn't
[1:40:35] recognize that he was
[1:40:37] literally the elijah was right there
[1:40:41] and they didn't know who he was
[1:40:44] and he was bringing these messages and i
[1:40:47] would
[1:40:48] deliberately keep those magazines with
[1:40:51] his
[1:40:51] messages in it not knowing who he was
[1:40:56] and then later on um when
[1:41:00] i realized with the casting out of
[1:41:02] devils and having them devil speaking in
[1:41:04] tongues through a
[1:41:05] schoolmate of mine i knew the person so
[1:41:07] it's not
[1:41:08] they're not putting on it's not
[1:41:10] something else i knew that was a devil
[1:41:12] and the devil got exposed and the devil
[1:41:14] talked to me and i talked back to the
[1:41:15] devil
[1:41:16] and knew it was the devil and he was
[1:41:18] speaking in tongue i knew right then
[1:41:20] tongues could not be the initial
[1:41:22] evidence and so
[1:41:23] they didn't like that when i began to
[1:41:25] talk like that
[1:41:27] and so of course my brother sister we
[1:41:29] parted
[1:41:30] ways right there and then praise god
[1:41:33] parted with right there and then not
[1:41:36] just based on that
[1:41:37] because just around that time i
[1:41:40] began to pray lord then if tongues is
[1:41:44] not the evidence
[1:41:45] then what is the truth
[1:41:48] there got to be something that is the
[1:41:50] evidence other person has the holy
[1:41:52] spirit what is it
[1:41:54] it wasn't like weeks later a book couple
[1:41:57] of books were slipped under my
[1:41:59] the door of of where we
[1:42:02] i stayed praise the lord and
[1:42:06] reading the books hybrid religion was
[1:42:08] attraction on the mountain
[1:42:09] oh my oh
[1:42:14] i tell you my soul started to go
[1:42:17] up and down i'm gonna i'm just gonna
[1:42:20] talk with you now
[1:42:21] praise the lord amen and
[1:42:24] i could not sleep
[1:42:28] but you know i wasn't going to just jump
[1:42:30] on any bandwagon
[1:42:32] because somebody said something so i
[1:42:35] one god not three
[1:42:38] but that's what it is but i thought that
[1:42:41] that's what everybody believed
[1:42:43] because that's how i was thinking of it
[1:42:46] so when i go and ask the professor
[1:42:50] i won't call his name i asked him like
[1:42:52] that oh no
[1:42:54] god is one yes but the three persons in
[1:42:57] one god and
[1:42:58] began to this and that and whatnot and
[1:43:01] see my and so i saw a difference right
[1:43:05] there
[1:43:05] and begin things began to open
[1:43:09] things began to open and then i began to
[1:43:12] question and
[1:43:13] the rest of it you know we separated we
[1:43:16] parted ways
[1:43:17] and uh based on the prophet's
[1:43:20] message there and that's where i regret
[1:43:23] now i didn't write
[1:43:24] him because right then i was writing a
[1:43:27] letter
[1:43:27] that was just in the middle of 65
[1:43:31] and i was writing him a letter and
[1:43:35] it didn't get there in time 65 or
[1:43:39] was it 65 but yes
[1:43:42] yes i didn't write the letter i delayed
[1:43:46] and by the december
[1:43:48] i heard that the prophet had passed on
[1:43:52] but later on i understood that
[1:43:55] obviously he didn't get the letter but
[1:43:58] still he knew
[1:43:59] praise the lord but later on i go to
[1:44:02] other places
[1:44:03] and preach the word and preach the word
[1:44:07] and
[1:44:07] then commanding this
[1:44:11] crippled man stand on your feet in the
[1:44:13] name of jesus
[1:44:14] and he stands up on his feet and started
[1:44:17] walking like this
[1:44:18] then suddenly he stopped he said but but
[1:44:21] but the prophet prayed
[1:44:23] and right away something got a hold of
[1:44:25] him and he went
[1:44:26] right back down he had to scramble his
[1:44:29] friend had to hold him and he go back
[1:44:31] and sat down in the chair
[1:44:32] the friend said what but but you you
[1:44:35] didn't understand you remember
[1:44:36] he said when jack is in the box
[1:44:41] amen and if you
[1:44:44] react to the right word you're healed
[1:44:47] amen
[1:44:48] he said you want to understand john is
[1:44:50] jack
[1:44:53] and the box is the pulpit
[1:44:56] he said oh brother i said i can't do
[1:44:59] anything i didn't know about that
[1:45:02] there's nothing i can do praise the lord
[1:45:05] but i want you to know
[1:45:06] that god has sent us a god-sent prophet
[1:45:12] but not only because he says so before
[1:45:17] um before anything else
[1:45:20] a couple of books that we were reading
[1:45:23] and then i would
[1:45:24] i stand by a bridge that we had over a
[1:45:28] canal
[1:45:29] and some bushes on the side there and
[1:45:32] i'm talking to them
[1:45:33] and telling them of the prophet and
[1:45:35] they're talking back to me and we're
[1:45:37] talking with the prophet
[1:45:38] and out of those bushes come a light
[1:45:41] about this size
[1:45:44] and it's just moving slow it's not
[1:45:46] moving fast
[1:45:48] just slow and because it was behind them
[1:45:52] and i'm talking to them the bushes are
[1:45:55] back there
[1:45:56] and this thing kept coming up like and i
[1:45:59] want to know
[1:46:00] if i'm seeing right maybe i'm imagining
[1:46:02] things
[1:46:03] so uh you know um i said
[1:46:07] do you see anything and they turn oh my
[1:46:10] god
[1:46:11] and so they saw it too light starts
[1:46:14] coming up
[1:46:15] like that praise god now this is not
[1:46:18] brother branham
[1:46:20] talking about some imaginary pillar of
[1:46:23] fire
[1:46:23] that i gotta imagine that came on him in
[1:46:26] the states
[1:46:27] i am looking at it there
[1:46:30] and it's moving slow about this size
[1:46:35] and i'm saying well you know
[1:46:38] you know i thought quickly that maybe
[1:46:41] because we
[1:46:42] are not talking about this man we caught
[1:46:44] up in all this stuff like that
[1:46:46] uh we can start to imagine all kinds of
[1:46:49] things
[1:46:50] so i was staying at my aunt
[1:46:53] my wife's um sister my mother
[1:46:56] mother sister and she lived across the
[1:46:59] canal so i just ran over the bridge
[1:47:01] ran to the house this is after midnight
[1:47:04] like one o'clock in the morning
[1:47:06] so there's nobody around and i just
[1:47:09] bang bang bang bang on the door and they
[1:47:12] want to know
[1:47:13] run out because they want to watch this
[1:47:14] emergency what happened what happened
[1:47:16] boy
[1:47:18] i asked them do you see anything
[1:47:21] so what do you mean oh my god
[1:47:24] what is that because it's moving slow
[1:47:28] and it's just going like that but when
[1:47:31] about three or four of them came out and
[1:47:33] said what is that what is that
[1:47:34] what is it it just went then it went
[1:47:38] in a speed it just went right up
[1:47:41] and disappeared now that is my
[1:47:44] experience
[1:47:46] and i saw that
[1:47:50] i didn't see it in the states i didn't
[1:47:53] see it
[1:47:54] anywhere and i don't attribute it to
[1:47:56] anything
[1:47:57] but just to let you know that the word
[1:48:00] of god is
[1:48:02] real of god is real
[1:48:08] amen so brother sister
[1:48:13] what do we have to say what do you have
[1:48:15] to say you don't have to say
[1:48:17] nothing the word the holy spirit himself
[1:48:21] will identify who you are and who i
[1:48:24] am i don't have to say anything to you
[1:48:27] you can
[1:48:28] you can say whatever you want call me
[1:48:30] any name you like
[1:48:32] whatever you can put me down you can say
[1:48:34] i don't have to listen to him
[1:48:36] i don't like that accent that he has
[1:48:39] you know is it african is it west indian
[1:48:42] is it the
[1:48:43] caribbean is it is it from the south or
[1:48:47] i mean that state called canada is it
[1:48:49] from there
[1:48:50] where is it from amen but you see those
[1:48:53] things don't matter
[1:48:55] so the devil distracts people i'm just
[1:48:57] talking with you now
[1:48:59] the devil distracts people from the word
[1:49:02] they'll make you look and say oh his tie
[1:49:04] is twisted
[1:49:07] what's this twisted tie got to do with
[1:49:09] the word
[1:49:10] do you understand god deliberately send
[1:49:13] prophets that were living in smelly
[1:49:15] dirty caves wearing
[1:49:19] you know camels you know them
[1:49:23] how they're full of licensed fleas and
[1:49:26] everything else
[1:49:27] and elijah was wearing camel skin
[1:49:30] you know how smelly you you know how
[1:49:33] goats are smelling and camels are worse
[1:49:37] and they're wearing that and they want
[1:49:38] to come talk to kings
[1:49:40] and talk to these wise men
[1:49:44] so i'm trying to show you god
[1:49:46] deliberately place
[1:49:48] his men in those kinds of
[1:49:51] background that if you're not really
[1:49:55] watching and listening you'll be
[1:49:57] distracted
[1:49:59] you'll be thrown off you won't be able
[1:50:01] to see those things
[1:50:03] because you're looking at all these oh
[1:50:05] he didn't clean his
[1:50:07] shoes off at the door before he came in
[1:50:09] my house
[1:50:17] oh my god or something or the other but
[1:50:20] that's how the devil works
[1:50:21] so brethren keep your eyes on the word
[1:50:25] of god
[1:50:26] and let the word be your guide let the
[1:50:29] holy spirit in you
[1:50:30] take the word and be your guide praise
