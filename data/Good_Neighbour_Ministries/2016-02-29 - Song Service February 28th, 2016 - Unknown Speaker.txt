about suicide some of the people that were were um you know causing the problems you know these days social media and bullying and you know people can say things that can literally cause our young people to get into desperate situations where they they want to take their lives can you imagine and it's one of the major causes of teen suicide today but yet some of the people that did The Bullying actually went back and apologized why because God was asked to come on SE and now all these raised up hands here in this house I know I got hands and feet in the air and all these prayer requests that
