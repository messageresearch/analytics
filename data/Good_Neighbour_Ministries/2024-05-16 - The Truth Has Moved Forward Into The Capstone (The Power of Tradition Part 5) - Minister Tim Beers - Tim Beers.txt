bit of work amen and but uh we're here tonight because we don't look to our flesh amen we look to the spirit of of God Amen Hallelujah you'll get what you expect Hallelujah if you expect the refreshing from the presence of the Lord today you'll get it from him amen hallelujah well amen it's good uh it's good to uh get into the word a little bit tonight we're going to continue in our study the power of tradition part five we're going to the title is going to be tonight the truth has moved forward into the Capstone I can't get away from this saints of God I can't get away from this thought here all I see when I read the message and I listen to the message amen I'm seeing something different Hallelujah this thing is constantly unfolding before my very eyes and I believe it's before the Bride of Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah those who seek will find those who knock amen hallelujah will be open to you amen it's this is the hour to be certain of God who is God is the revealed word amen hallelujah oh my let us continue to pray for one another amen let's pray for our pastor Allelujah he's under a great uh amount of stress and uh physical stress and mental stress and trying and testing I'm working with him so I know I see it Allelujah his heart and his Desir is to be here amen but uh he's he's busy at work right now for the month of May so let's keep him in prayer let's not just you know take it for granted he's under pressure he's under stress I see the the tests and the trials coming right it's just because you know these things come you know especially to the Elders of the church right that are ordained to min of the word to get us out of that channel right to you know any distraction any hindrance any trial test that Satan could throw at us is to get us out of that channel and that channel if you get out of that channel it stops the the flow of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives Amen in our gifts and that's what feeds us man don't feed you it's the Holy Spirit through the gifts through the channels that he's ordained to feed need you amen so that's why we have to pray one for another Hallelujah not just taking it for granted that you know oh Lord bless the pastor or bless the the elders or bless the minister but lord they're under trial they're under P if I'm going through what I'm going through in my life imagine what they're going through Hallelujah for you here for you online and for all that will listen let us pray one for another and in that love one another Hallelujah let us turn to Matthew 25 we got three scripture reading tonight it is Bible study tonight so and I just got to get my glasses here or else I won't be reading much Hallelujah Matthew 251 and then we're going to go to Revelations 3:14 and then Isaiah 61 and like I said before all these scriptures have a meaning they have a purpose why a minister brings these scriptures and are led to bring these scriptures the truth has move forward into the Capstone Hallelujah Matthew 251 says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be like unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom terth they all slumbered and slept all of them both the wise and the foolish and at midnight there was a cry behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us oil give us your oil for our lamps have gone out what happened they all arose they were all sleeping and SL number then the cry went out the word the Revelation the seals were open give us of your oil we know oil is a type of Revelation for our lamps have gone out but the wise answered said no not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to to them that sell and buy for yourself and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterwards came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore ye know neither neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh wow what a scripture what a scripture I can see this scripture where is this scripture going to be fulfilled is it out there in a denomination how can it be fulfilled out there in a denomination how can this setting and this scene of the the play this is a script to the play be fulfilled out there like we've been talking about all through this series Revelations 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of the leoan write these things say the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that th Thou Art neither cold nor hot I would thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing wow saith thou thou are rich with goods and have need of nothing I don't have need of the Holy Spirit I don't have need of the mighty angel I don't know have need of the spirit of TR I got the message I got the written word I got the tapes I have need of nothing I am rich but the life the life is what God is going to prove what is truth and knoweth not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich so there is hope there is Mercy and Grace that is still available to us to whoever it is that God has speaking to and white rayment that thou mayest be clothed and thou that thou shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy eyes with isab that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame and sat down with my father in his throne he that had an ear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches not what the man said but what the spirit said unto the churches Isaiah 61 arise Shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and Kings to thy brightness of thy rising of thy Rising Hallelujah let us pray father we thank you thank you for your word tonight Lord we can do nothing without you lord but with you we can be yielded vessels you said take no thought for what you would say in that hour Lord I've prepared I've studied I have notes before me Lord but come great holy spirit let there be Faith sufficient for this hour Lord for this age in this place and them that are hearing abroad Lord bring us into that place Lord that we need to be tonight father not by might not by power but by your spirit sayeth the Lord when the spirit of Truth has come it will guide us and lead us into all truth Come Holy Spirit we invite your presence tonight bind every Power Of Satan I know he's a distractor I know he's a Hinderer I know he's a liar tonight father and as a deceiver Lord expose him in each and every one of our lives so that we may be set free and who the son of man sets free is free indeed free to receive and see the word for this hour so that we may go out and Manifest this truth Lord that you have given us Grant it Lord in Jesus name we ask amen you may be seated God bless you hey amen so we talked about I'm not going to recap everything but we talked about you know in jesus' day with the Pharisees and Sadducees and what they did with their Traditions made a word the word of God of none effect we talked about the Dark Ages how the word came down through the Dark Ages and how uh that nickel and spirit rised up and tried to take over the church and have the minion over the church we see that Luther Wesley right up to Pentecost amen started restoring back truth to us hallelujah but it didn't stop at Pentecost Hallelujah and we see that God sent us a 20th century prophet and we believe that he is a prophet of God William brandham amen but we also see that he was also in and he was sent to the pent costal age Hallelujah but we also see as the word progressed in his ministry we also see the Turning of a corner we seen the word come to a place amen that it had to come to a place where it changed and that is what we call the opening of The Seven Seals and we know that it wasn't of man because when we go back and we look at the first six seals we can see that God revealed to a man and God allowed a man to speak those six seals but in the seven seal there's nothing that man could have said there's nothing that the prophet could have said to us because that seven seal is Christ alone and him alone and he was showing there and proven there that is him he has come on the scene and he has taken contr control of his the church he is the head of the church amen he's the one that is going to reveal what this truth this Rapture in faith that we need this perfect faith that the bride needs to change a body in this hour no more No Greater Faith than in any other age than what is in this age to change our bodies as we are living to be transformed that is a faith that is greater than any other Faith amen and only he can do that that's why he said I'm not leaving it to a prophet I'm not leaving it to man but I'm coming myself and all we are as a five-fold Ministry are yielded vessels to speak his word but he has to ride on that word and reveal it to us because this Revelation this body change is only going to come by Revelation by it being revealed to you unless the spirit of truth comes it will guide you and lead you into all truth so we can see that in the message as a whole there's a part that's Pentecostal and we see that in that Pentecostal age before the seals yes the seals were breaking Revelation was coming out like the serpent seed we talked about things were starting to unfold but they weren't made clear even brother bradam when it came to the opening of the seals he said this Bible is a new Bible this message is new Hallelujah to me we can see and recognize by faith that something transformed in him something changed in his walk in his ministry and by recognizing that we can understand that there is something different in the message when we hear it preach than just a Pentecostal message remember a lot of these preachers have come out of Pentecost into this message or any other denomination Hallelujah and they take the quotes and they make the Pentecostal message more glorified more Rich more exciting to the people and people are swallowing that oh yes that's what's taking place but the Bride of Jesus Christ is starting to recognize because I can see it and I can and I and when I fellowship with the bride of Jesus Christ I can see that they're starting to understand and pick these things up remember this is not going to be a public show and that's not saying out there it's not out there it's here it's amongst the ranks of the message the message has grown to such a place that God is not going to make this truth his truth known as a public show anymore but as individuals now remember the Capstone age is what we're in has always been rejected just like back then brother Bram talked about the Capstone on the pyramid was rejected so this Capstone this Capstone age in our hour that we're living in is going to be rejected the word the revealing of the word to the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to be rejected but not to her she receives it she sees it and she receives it the whole age is rejected what this whole age this Pentecostal age this leoc and age no that's not what he's talking about here this Capstone this bride age this time and season that God is going to bring his word to the another level with her you see we have to go through the steps the message has to go through the process justification sanctification baptism with the Holy Ghost and then the Holy Ghost himself you cannot Escape even in your experience you can't escape that but if you got to True new birth inside of you that's what takes you through that experience that's what moves you through the steps that you're going through and and causes you to keep overcoming as you place yourself in that position of the holy spirit in your life the age is rejected and who is living in this age is rejected too good people but not recognizing the bride age gross Darkness upon the people of cour of this course this is a prophecy of the day that we are now living in you see the oil the Revelation has moved into the Capstone air age every age when the word is revealed that is the oil for the age and once that age is over it starts blending out and going into it Luther had oil had Revelation and it started blending out but when Wesley came on the scene that Luther age that people were living in the oil had run out and then you go right down to where and now here Pentecost had the oil but now it's run out my brothers and sisters you see where the foolish virgin is not in Pentecost the denomination but in the Pentecostal experience age experience right here hallelujah amen recognizing your day in this message brother brandham why do they do that you see I'm taking these right out of the message of the hour I'm not denying and I'm not rejecting any of the message of the hour in the quotes but seeing the Revelation that God is revealing to me in this hour and seeing it right in the message and recognizing Now you listen to what he's saying here remember people are always looking at what God did hallelujah what God's going to do but failing to recognize what he's doing right now and that was the foolish virgin failing to recognize right now they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that there will be an Awakening they're good people why is it what is wrong think about it what is wrong brother Tim I'm in a messes church I listen to the brother brandham tapes what is wrong they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride see by being a Christian not a denominational but a Christian he's saying they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but they see they're look looking for it way off in the future we know that something is supposed to we've been preaching about it it's being preached constantly that what is supposed to happen What like Jesus said don't go and look for it over here look for it over there it's happening right in your midst the kingdom of God Has Come amen and I believe the kingdom of God has come in this hour to us amen you're hearing by the spirit the kingdom preached every time when it's happening right by you very good people but they don't recognize the bride age they're not placed into that Capstone by the New Birth by the revealing of those seals in this hour now remember it's a proc process that we are going through amen I want to encourage you tonight too I'm going to tell you the truth but I I want to encourage you Amen to keep pressing on Hallelujah keep pressing forward some when a a baby is born it's not an adult overnight H Allelujah but I know when you're born again because I can look back at my experience 30 something years ago I know when you're born again again a new life has come inside of you and something happens to you Hallelujah something is different inside of you no matter what you here oh I've been tried tried to be deceived by the devil over the years many times especially listening to many different voices out there there's a danger Hallelujah especially to young babies there is a danger to listen to many voices is out there mature adults can filter amen but even they are wise to know not to listen to too many voices out there Hallelujah well if your eyes are not open you can only see the church ages from the past you don't understand that the key word of this age is your past word think about it my brothers and sisters what is the greatest word in this age this age this leoc and age when we talk about a word that everybody has password password password gets you into everything how many passwords do you have here tonight I know I got a bunch of passwords you can't get into your technology you can't get into your computer or what ever it is without a passw Hallelujah and leoan is built on a pass word hallelujah glory to God and what it takes in this age everybody is living off of a past word think about it my brothers and sisters think about it they got stuck people are stuck on a password people are believing in the password people are accepting the password and they're stuck what are they stuck on that God sent a prophet they're stuck on that they haven't moved past that yes God sent a prophet but why did he send a prophet to restore the word what did the word do what is it supposed to do bring a bride into maturity call out a bride perfect a bride clean a bride deliver a bride bring her to that place that she's walking with God alone but Satan using the same message same word using the process of growing and maturity in the word and how it changed to keep people in a past age believing in the password you got to change your password Hallelujah whoever you are you got to change your password to the Eternal Word of God let me say that the message of the hour is truth but the message is in two parts we know that if you know the message and you study the message and you can divide the truth is in two parts it's coming out and going in the Pentecostal part of the message calls you out every single one of you here tonight have been called out the message has called you out that's guaranteed if you're listening to this and you believe that God sent a prophet and you believe the message of the hour and you're going to a message Church you have been called out but there's a going in you have C been called out to come in to go in not to stay here just like in the just like in the Tabernacle we're not to stay in the outer court or the inner but to go behind the inner Veil that is the process that we have to take hallelujah amen but in that process Satan is always there the liar the deceiver taking like he did with Eve the same word and that's what you got to recognize my brothers and sisters that's what I have come to recognize to see to take he takes the same word word and tries to keep me in a past age keep my condition my experience in a past age and not let it move forward amen [Music] hallelujah if you believe the message of the hour and you are following it in a message church that only means you have come out it doesn't mean you have gone in yet the leoan age is part of the Pentecostal age which is the coming out but the opening of The Seven Seals being revealed to the individual bride is the going in into the Capstone age or the Rapture age producing perfect Faith hallelujah amen we should never think that we have arrived never because that was what Satan will I got the the message I got the tapes I got this I got all Revelation no That's what Satan will use to deceive you from going forward this is an age that we're living in in the in this message we've come out but we're still living on a password this is the age where everything is connected together technology theology man's opinions and understanding and everything has a password connected to it you see this this oil in this age has run out it's finished gone and now the foolish virgin are manifesting in this message and living off of a past word the Bible said there will be two in the field and two in the bed and I'll take one and I'll leave one physically we are all in in the same place leoan but spiritually the bride is in a different place she's not in leoan Hallelujah she's in a different dimension altogether go back to the scriptures that we read in the opening and go back to the message I know it's Wednesday night Hallelujah and our flesh some of us will fight us more than others go back and listen to it again now listen Satan's Eden I'm still trying to lay something down here Satan's Eden the God of this world today the worshipper person of this world today is Satan the person who is worshiped and the people are ignorant of worshiping Satan but is Satan impersonating himself as the church think about it Saints I know when we read these quotes I mean I used to I always looked because it wasn't revealed to me that it's here now it's here manifesting I know it's very difficult for some of you very difficult but when God when you start seeking God will start opening in your eyes and even some of you are starting to see things starting to recognize things things that you don't you didn't understand why you're Discerning certain things because God wants to reveal truth to you and show you my brothers and sisters this messes culture this messes Traditions that we have going around and moving around Hallelujah is not what it perceives to be they worship Satan thinking that they are worshiping God through the church but it's the way Satan has done it all you say but wait a minute we preach the word the message of the hour we preach it look back here at my text tonight now I'm I'm not I'm not talking I'm brother Brand's talking here Satan was the one that preached the word to Eve first in the beginning as God said see it's to interpret something such as a statement or action wrongly and misinterpret that part of the scripture that applies to the day that you're living in he will let you know all about Jesus and what he did was perfectly well you listening stay with me he will let you know all that Moses did was perfectly well he even lets you know everything that brother Bram did was well but to let you know about the bride age about your part in the word think about it and how to bring your part into manifestation oh no he won't let you know that he ain't going to let you go that far because he doesn't want amen Jesus is coming he know what he had to deal with with brother brandham the the manifestation of the wave sheet that came to maturity he know what he had to deal with with him he don't want that being spread like it was on the day of Pentecost little Jesus is all over the place and that's what the message is supposed to do just like it did back there amen with the apostles the pillar of fire spread out and went into them and there was Jesus all over the place my brothers and sisters that's the deception of this hour that's the deception of Satan trying to take the word and stop this manifestation from coming to pass in the bride that's why he's got to be exposed to the highest level am I the only one or no I'm not but I'm I got to be true to what I'm seeing this is what's burning on my heart just like when the prophet came he had to speak the truth what he was seeing amongst the denominations ministers called anointed in this hour God to speak the same truth and we've heard it for many years the two seeds the two spirits in the churches through our former Pastor being exposing these things hallelujah it's still here the bride still needs this word to sharpen her sword sharpen her discernment in this hour oh yeah he'll let you know about everything about every other age but he won't let you know your part in the word how many people are worshiping brother Brenham I've seen videos is right on if you know go on Instagram or whatever Tik Tok or whatever I've seen pictures of brother Brenham and people are worshiping them bowing down before them building up an idol like Daniel is happening right now my brothers and sisters Satan always trying to distract the people from finding their part how can they find their part in the word how can they recognize who they are you see that's the greatest thing that brother Bram said in this hour when she recognizes who she is she'll be Invincible Satan hates that he didn't say he hates you worshiping brother Bram or picture or being religious or wearing long dress and having long hair but he hates when people recognize who they are in this hour and that's what's raising up that's what the Holy Ghost is building within us Building a Church a super Church an invincible Army to take this word Hallelujah so that when we speak the word oh brother I pray nothing happens this you got to be built up you got to be strengthened and built up in the word you got to recognize who you are most of the people that say that God don't hear my prayers or nothing happens when I pray is the people that don't recognize who they are in this hour that's why it's very important that God get you to a place you don't need to experience all the the Miracles and all the feelings and uh speak in tongues and all these things that even in this message calls the Holy Ghost still think about it preaching it as the Holy Ghost still the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all these things bringing the people and leading them into deception but no it's recognizing who you are is the most important thing that's what operates the sword of faith amen the word of God in this hour Hallelujah he knows brother brand speaking here that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and stands for like we were just talking she can do the Greater Works invisible army they get a true revelation of two Spirits within the framework of the church and by God's spirit by God's spirit not no other Spirit not ministers catching the pastor's spirit and manifesting it but by God's spirit and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her Hallelujah yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it because it says who we are it reveals who we are with a true Revelation in our Liv lives the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail you see where it is Saints you see what we should be seeking for in this hour but Satan is trying to take this Pentecostal message in this message and make you go and run after it he that has an ear let him hear those who have eyes to seea it's not what it is the bride is having a Revival right now and you're saying oh brother we're the church is not packed out and we're not he having healing lines and having all different kind of Miracles the word Revival is what's Tak place right now the word is unfolding in the bride it's revealing to the bride it's bringing her to a place Hallelujah glory to God Satan's Eden 1965 but now the cunningness of the devil now makes the people believe that they are Christians when they're not Revelations 3:14 the leosan church age that how the church would be in these last days and it said it would be sitting as a widow and have need of nothing it was rich increased with Goods poor miserable blind naked didn't even know it think about it didn't even know it now remember he's speaking to the Church of this age now can you discern between the lines he's speaking to the message of this age message is different than the word well brother the message can't be different is a word it all depends which way you interpret it Hallelujah it is different than this opening of the seals wretched naked blind don't know it the last phrase that last word is makes it so striking they think they are filled with the spirit they think they are filled with the spirit they're all ready for the Rapture the leoan church age is the Pentecostal Church age because it's the last Church age Luther had his message Wesley had his message and Pentecostal had had their message it also said that because you are lukewarm neither hot or cold the emotions of the outside the mental conception of the gospel because he said you are that way because you believe it that way because that is your experience in the message I will spw you out of my mouth in other words it made him sick to see the church in that condition think about it trying to do God a service without being his will now watch close it gets to that Razor Edge now between right and wrong now remember it falls on one or the other side it comes write down to make it more accurate Intense or effect sometimes like a Raaz a razor between the difference is between right and wrong you see it's coming right down to the razor's Edge that's where it's coming down to and that's where it'll come down to In your experience right down to the razor's Edge so close doesn't it say that it will deceive the very elect if it were possible it'll be so close stay with me hallelujah it's not to be it's got to be every word of God not just almost every word what does it mean by that it's got to be every word brother brother I believe every word I believe everything brother brandom said I believe everything the Bible says but that's not what he's saying when he's said if you take one word away or if you add one word he's talking about the age that you're living in you can't take a word out of the age that God has ordained for us to be in amen you can't go in Wesley's age and believe only Luther and bring it over to Wesley you're taking a word away hallelujah it's got to it's got down today not Luthers or methodists or not Pentecostal but that razor intense age this age is a razor intense age where the Antichrist anointing is so perfectly it would deceive the very elect perfectly that that anointing he said that anointing is so perfectly it'll deceive the very elect if it was possible they fall on the wrong side if they don't watch it like a wedge watch brother Brandon speaking here watch be careful we're not living in the Pentecostal ages now we pass that age just the same as we pass looser and Wesley we have gone past that age trying to do God a service without being his will the church ages begins with a message that is the oil in the lamps as the church ends the oil runs out in the last age the Pentecostal age the oil has run out and the people are trying to feed off of that age when that age has changed into another age called the bride age where the oil is today is that the people's fault it's The Minister's fault because ministers are the ones that are preaching and and when the when the when a a preacher is preaching the word of God and if he's preaching a Pentecostal message in this age that's what the people are believing and standing on I believe we've been hearing for many years now Hallelujah the caps Stone Age The Bride age Hallelujah that's what's brought me I know brought me to this place where I am in my walk because I have not been feeding off of a a Luther Wesley or Pentecostal age I've been feeding off of the Eternal Church Age The Bride age the word of God being revealed to bring a bride into perfection in this hour that's what's brought me to this place in my experience Hallelujah and both the foolish virgin and wise virgin are feeding off of the message but one is receiving Revelation oil to keep her lamps lit up and the others feeding off of a past AG Faith the seals are open to one and not to the other and both in the same message church both called Believers but one say this Revelation is wrong and fighting against it by using a Pentecostal quotes in the message not recognizing the opening of the seals the word spoken about the Capstone age the bright age yes many times brother Simon has stepped out by faith amen God revealing the word for the hour to him and bringing it just like have you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe this message people fought against him people called him false and then he start preaching that there's another age beyond the seven Church Ages which is the Eternal Church age who fights against who takes the quotes and fights against the truth is people right here right in the message not recognizing and then some will come out those who are elected and called will come out and recognize the truth hallelujah but the other ones will stay because that's all that they see that's all that they can recognize and receive because they don't got the seed of the age inside of them to produce the fruit of the age that they're living in h Allelujah that's when they're going to ask where did you get the oil where did you get this Revelation this Revelation that you've been feeding off of my brothers and sisters this Revelation that we've been feeding off of for years here I'm talking about you I'm talking about me I'm talking about us here there are many there are other churches amen that God is revealing this CH this truth to we're not the only ones I'm not saying that but I know that has been happening here because I can can see it in my life and experience it in my life happening right here right now oh yes my brothers and sisters hallelujah amen yes we are both believ in the same message but one receiving it by Perfect Faith the other didn't virgin means Purity Purity they were all good people every one of them I'm not saying they're Wicked I'm not saying they're bad people they're evil people they're good people I'm telling you what the word says they're virgins Purity every one of them virgins Sanctified vessels of God think about he's saying here but those who had oil in their lamps went in and the others were left out they were all virgins everyone people that you couldn't even put your finger on them anything wrong with them every one of them believed the coming of the Lord they all were ready to meet him but some of them left their oil out I got the message don't ever get to that place my brothers and sisters I got the message I got the truth let him reveal to you that you're secure in him let him show you that you're sealed let him reveal to you where you're at until then you seek you knock with perseverance why do you think he preached after the token message you must have the token just like Jesus said you must be born again he PR he preached perseverance he said after that token message he said I got in desperation and he says I'm still in desperation Hallelujah I don't think there's enough desperate people hallelujah why why because Satan has deceived them you got the message you got the tapes I'm okay I believe that God sent a prophet but deep down inside you don't recognize who you are in the word God has not revealed your portion in the word that's the deception of Satan that's where brother brand said you got to shake yourself you got to stir your faith up amen it's not about your brother or your sister your husband or your wife it's you and God alone you got to know who you are you can't stop night or day that was a matter with the foolish virgins they stopped they got comfor able in what they believe but the wise virgins seek persevered in desperation they wanted to know truth hallelujah are you content tonight are you content where you are tonight or do is there a call in your heart for more of God hallelujah oh my shake yourselves this is the most wicked deceiving age that there ever gross Darkness upon the people hallelujah the death Angels passing in this age Hallelujah but he won't come near the bride those who have the blood the token the life over the doorpost of their heart their life the death angel will pass by know that you know my brothers and sisters h Hallelujah even if this shakes you to the core it shakes doubt in your mind but you got to know that you know who you are in this hour and know that God is dealing with your life know that God is bringing you to a place in your walk hallelujah amen don't don't let that be your case he says keep oil in your lamps oil the spirit the Holy Spirit the Revelation keep it in your lamps what does he mean by that keep it in your L keep growing in the faith Hallelujah I got a revelation what did they do in a denomination what did they do when they got a revelation they got a truth they kept it and they denominated around it they didn't let it grow and that's what happens with a Believer and I'm going to call everyone a Believer that's what happens to a Believer they get a revelation and I've seen it over the years some of you have seen it that been here long enough over the years somebody comes in they got a revelation yeah they got a revelation it was a real Revelation but they denominated they didn't let it grow they didn't protect it and let it grow grow in the word of God hallelujah don't let it drain from you when you feel your love dying away your sincerity to Christ and the cause go quickly to him who has the Fountain of oil and buy yourself filling with oil buy the oil how do I buy the oil off Jesus Christ amen you have that ability to approach God to approach his throne through the blood of Jesus Christ he says through the blood come boldly before me and ask your petition Hallelujah ask what you have need of he said seek the kingdom of God first and his righteousness and all things shall be added unto you stop seeking and asking for all things being added unto you but the kingdom of God my brother brothers and sisters it has come it has come to man in this hour that's what the message was all about to bring the kingdom to the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour that's what we ask for Hallelujah that's what we want to keep alive in our lives and no matter what it takes no matter what it takes what we have to separate from what we have to die out to it doesn't happen overnight but you got to keep overcoming you got to keep praying for that situation like it says lay aside every sin and weight that easily besets you you got to pray for those things in your life that easily beset you the sin in your life in your flesh it's not in the soul if the Soul's been born again the seed cannot sin but it's in your flesh we got to pray and pray pray through it Lord Jesus and keep praying and keep pressing on hallelujah it's a universal Rapture there's going to be another part I know that shall be caught away secretly oh I love that that great bridegroom coming and the bride got herself ready waiting in that secret moment that she doesn't even know herself but she is ready she's dressed and she's waiting she's dressed with what the word the Revelation oh my she didn't Slumber or sleep my brothers and sisters but when she awoke she had oil in her lamps there's a there's a there's a mystery there Hallelujah because if you read it it says they all slumbered and sleep and they all Rose but why when they all arose from to Slumber and sleep one had oil and one didn't what was the difference you figure it out hallelujah amen trying to do God a service without being the will of God look when they brought the build the temple and brought the ark into it God went there with the pillar fire amen it was David jumping and screaming and all the singers and the priests carrying on just like Pentecost when they went out of the will of God but when God identified the Ark in its place and position before they could get the Ark in there here come the pillar of fire leading the way right down over the cherin wings and right behind the holies of holies his resting place the pillar of fire do you see what see what's being said here hallelujah it's chained something changed here was David the great prophet dancing and screaming taking the ark but that wasn't his position it's not no man's position this can't be touched with man's hands Hallelujah it was the pillar of fire that had to come and lead them right down into the holies of holies and the glory of God was in there till they couldn't see how to minister they couldn't even Minister cuz when the glory of God comes upon the people hallelujah it's beyond ministering Hallelujah nobody can Minister this Revelation when it strikes you in your heart and it's revealed to you in your heart Hallelujah it will be in the Kingdom illuminated it will illuminate them by his own personal presence he will not be used in the star s The Messengers no he's not using them that's not what's going to illuminate his personal presence which people think no to give light in the darkness any longer that's not what's happening anymore my brothers it will be Jesus himself speaking face to face as he shares his kingdom with us as he Reveals His Kingdom in us hallelujah Jesus has given us this description of himself in relations to the last age now listen the days of grace are winding up he has looked from the first century right through to the 20th century he told all things that concern these ages before he reveals the characteristics of the last age to us he gives us one final look at his own Grace gracious and supreme deity this is the Capstone revelation of himself thus sayeth the amen hallelujah let me try to wind it down here I'll skip over some things and bring it to the next Hallelujah Jesus himself when he came he knew he was the word he was that he was positive that for he was and when he was just 12 years old a little boy we find him in the temple debating with the priests his knowledge of who he was could surpass their traditions and he was teaching them men and when his own mother came to him dun said a word that was wrong catch watch the word correct the error the word always corrects the error and if the people could only see today that the word for the age corrects the error the whole thing is become an error but God's word is what is right he said the heavens and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away and the word that is prophesied for this day is correct the error of the day it corrects the error of the day you understand that the word itself corrects the error the people today say oh let us join a church let us join the message of the hour let us go to the council let us do all these things that's an error and the word comes back and corrects that error by identifying himself the hour and the time of the hour now we know these things to be true Hallelujah let's fite the musicians up amen the but the new birth is Christ is a revelation you have been born again or receiv received the Holy Ghost since you have been born again have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed sorry this message has God reveal to you this great mystery if he has that's the new birth what are you going to do when you get all those groups together where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressing through it his word by the same actions and the same things he did making his word manifest in this day oh if the church only knew its position position it will one day you see if it only knew its position then the Rapture will go when it knows it Christ is the mystery of God revealed hallelujah amen last statement here the gross darkness is here upon the earth and the people of this age is full of Darkness but the light has come to the bride to take her out of this age that is heading in One Direction but the Lord has put us in another Direction in another age where there is no darkness and only light is the shikina glory where the bride is coming into perfect Faith she's in there recognizing that God has forgiven her of all her sins because he wants her consecration in that inner veil in that most holy place let us the bride of Christ get that to that place with him let's lay aside everything that gets in the way and overcome and press with this perseverance and Desperation in this hour never give up if you have recognized that you have been called to be separated from this religious spirit of this age of this world or in this message then let us press on and love one another and pray for one another because we're all in this together my brothers and sisters those who are called are in this battle together hallelujah amen this this is something my brothers and sisters is a part of our faith Jesus manifested in his hour by exposing what the error was in the hour in the religious real people that were preaching in Moses's message Jesus come and expose the error that man's Traditions put on the me the the law made all kinds of traditions as we spoke about that's what he did he exposed the greatest part of his ministry and the greatest opening of the people's eyes in that day when Jesus was speaking was them recognizing that he was speaking truth and they were speaking error brother brandham came in the 20th century and he spoke the word of God and exposed the error of the denominations is that correct and that was a coming out for us we can see that he exposed the a of the denominations but he also manifested as the wave sheet he manifested a Faith That Grew that changed amen and he introduced to us Christ in this hour and as John said I must decrease and he must increase and we know Christ is the word the revealed word of the hour and same thing in this hour my brothers and sisters if John doesn't decrease and Christ increase then you're going to be in a past age believing a pass word and not recognizing the true message of Christ in this hour he said in that hour don't go when they say over here or over there they got the message they got the message they got the truth over here we see that happening in this message if you don't follow this person or that person the Bible teaches us don't in that hour don't follow those things but Christ has come in this hour in this day he's the one that descended in the cloud he's the one that opened up the seal heals he's the one that called out your name he's the one that's perfecting your faith he's the one trying to get you to a place to recognize his presence in your life his voice in your life when you come and recognize that oh there's a power in recognizing the ability that you have when you recognize him in your life that's what this message is supposed to do get a bride ready filled with Revelation oil of who she is my brothers but it takes desperation it takes perseverance like the Bible says you have not strived with blood you have not pressed in the kingdom of God with violence amen do you want it bad enough oh this a age we are all affected by this gross Darkness this age my brothers and sisters all the pressure work all these things are upon all of us my brothers excuse after excuses can be poured down upon us but we have to rise up that's where we have to pray for one another when we see one another families marriages falling into the Trap Of The Devil pray in the Holy Ghost pray for one another we're all affected in the flesh of this age Hallelujah God the Lord Jesus Christ is here waiting waiting for you to ask for isab to put on your eyes for the scale to fall off of your eyes and when they do you're going to recognize that he's always been here he's never left you he'll never leave you and never forsake you like Abraham said it wasn't God who left me I left the promised land he s he told me don't leave the promised land stay in it there was battles there was people that he had to kill he he had to overcome he had to wipe out not like Saul when God said destroy everything When God Says destroy everything he means destroy everything my brothers and sisters and you stay and you fight in your life until you destroy everything this is how this is going to come this is how you keep oil in your lamps don't take it for granted get that deception lie out of your head that you're okay you have no right to Proclaim because you're in this message and you believe God sent a prophet that you're okay or even look at your life no you got no right the Holy Ghost is the one that confirms his word and interprets his word let him come until he comes and you recognize in your life and interprets to you you are my son you are my child then that brings humility and humbleness a change in your life when you're walking with the King let us stand Hallelujah you may not understand everything but believe that God is here speaking you're not here by [Music] chance you're not here listening to this by chance it's not brother Tim never once do I lift myself up never once I point that I can give you anything but we are channels ministers are channels and vessels to point you to Christ point you to him that you may seek him every message that comes forth is to get you to seek him to look to him ask him believe him that he is more than able father Lord Jesus what has been on my heart I spoke it to my best ability Lord I know it's broken up in some areas it could be spoken better English that people may understand better but Lord there's nobody that can reveal it clearer than you can in the people's hearts I pray for each and every one everyone has different portion of faith and levels of faith and levels of understanding but I pray they would hold on to something tonight that was revealed by your spirit if it's keep pressing on then keep pressing on keep believing then keep believing whatever it is if it keeps seeking for more truth to open up like that Roman candle then keep seeking for more truth whatever the Holy Spirit has spoken Lord I pray that you would just never let them rest day and night come upon them in the we hours of the morning Father and speak to your bride because it's not us it's you getting your bride ready in this hour bless our pastor father to be a yielded vessel he's he's not only the pastor but the true revelation of the Bible is Bishop overseer of the elders to be a vessel be yielded to be sensitive to your spirit to lead us at times in the direction you want us to go to be sensitive to correct us when you want us to be [Music] corrected bless him father because I know the devil will fight him we'll fight the elders at a higher level we're all receiving our portion of faith and it is Faith it's Revelation but we are called to different offices and different levels we would not be able to stand up here Lord if it wasn't for your grace lord it's not easy it's not the preaching people's faith and anointing the preaching is easy it's living the life lord it's staying in that channel staying in that consecration is the hardest thing so many distractions so that's why we pray father in the name of Jesus Christ not only for the elders but each and every one here every position every portion that's in the body of Jesus Christ that's going to bring this rapture to completion all around the world Lord Jesus mighty Army raise up for the glory of God take your position take your stand with the word of God of this hour this age and who you are this is our age the bride age where Christ is manifesting now in the portion of the word that he has spoken for the bride oh it's so simple Le but Lord open the people's eyes to recognize it then we can march on to this Rapture this truth Lord
