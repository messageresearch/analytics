[0:08] be letting shine in this dark hour that
[0:11] we are now living in is Christ let him
[0:15] shine out of your life amen what the
[0:18] world has got tensil what is really
[0:21] saying the world has got cheap
[0:24] tens the world is putting more emphasis
[0:27] on style rather than on
[0:31] substance amen hallelujah but we want to
[0:35] put our emphasis on the substance of the
[0:39] word of God or the revelation of the
[0:41] word of God that's where our faith is
[0:43] lying on Amen when you come to when you
[0:46] come
[0:47] to teaching you go on the TV those guys
[0:52] on the TV or those women on the TV will
[0:55] make us look like we are country
[0:57] bumpkins
[1:00] Dr Charles Stanley doct this doctor that
[1:04] everybody's a doctor to write reverence
[1:06] so and so your lordship so and so and
[1:09] whatnot my goodness wow and when they
[1:13] begin to present their stuff like that
[1:17] why we I tell you it's amazing I admire
[1:19] some of them but the fact is of course I
[1:22] don't look look at them really I don't
[1:24] really look at them but if you know they
[1:25] turn the TV on they happen to be there
[1:27] cuz they start to listen and in a short
[1:30] while they're talking nonsense they're
[1:32] off the word and I can't take it I've
[1:35] got to I just got to turn it off cuz I I
[1:39] can't take it so the fact is brother
[1:42] sister that um that's what it is they
[1:45] got a whole other style but listen to
[1:49] them simple as we are you are listen to
[1:53] them the least in the Kingdom in that
[1:57] day the Bible says the least in the
[1:58] Kingdom will be great G than John is
[2:01] that right greater than John hallelujah
[2:04] praise God forever more what I'm saying
[2:07] to you is never mind don't be
[2:09] intimidated by these modern day
[2:12] giants walk in the land just because
[2:15] they have a dumb whatever behind their
[2:17] name praise the Lord I'm breaking into
[2:20] preaching I'm let me stay with
[2:22] teaching but uh you know ba this and PhD
[2:28] and whatnot and and they used that to do
[2:31] what they use all those titles to just
[2:34] gain credibility right off the bat once
[2:37] people he they got those letters behind
[2:39] they start to swallow everything that
[2:40] they say is that right yeah and who are
[2:44] you you come from out to Nowhere uh by
[2:47] the way what uh what university did you
[2:50] go to did you go to Yale haard Berkshire
[2:53] where what MIT
[2:55] [Music]
[2:58] whatever they don't want to hear that
[3:01] they want to be able to know where you
[3:02] went and if you don't have that say oh
[3:05] well yes and they'll accommodate you now
[3:08] right just they'll tolerate you they'll
[3:12] just tolerate you now and and you can
[3:14] say whatever you want but it's just
[3:16] passing through one ear go through the
[3:17] other a and they're not listening
[3:19] anymore because you don't have the
[3:23] credibility that comes from their
[3:25] educational system but you see brother
[3:29] Bron said God takes men we'll we'll talk
[3:32] about that when we get there uh he takes
[3:35] men um usually Sometimes some have some
[3:39] and some don't have nothing he took
[3:41] Isaiah who was a friend of the king and
[3:43] was in and out of the palace you know he
[3:46] took uh Daniel that was a prime minister
[3:48] in there and then turns around he takes
[3:50] a fisherman right uh that couldn't be
[3:53] read and right you see like that takes
[3:56] another one that was a Doctor Luke and
[3:58] takes another one that was this or that
[4:00] so the Bible is written over a period of
[4:02] 1600 years you know 66 book and and we
[4:06] have these all different authors from
[4:08] Kings and Priests down to fishermen to
[4:13] lowly people uh you know a whole range
[4:16] of people God is no respector of persons
[4:19] amen and that P fire can come into a
[4:22] come into a great big meeting with
[4:24] thousands of people bypass everybody and
[4:27] go right to a woman sitting there and
[4:29] said oh oh I see that woman is standing
[4:32] over her it by pass everybody went over
[4:34] that woman I go right over there and
[4:37] goes over there and it goes over oh
[4:39] there's that my colored sister I see or
[4:42] my colored brother gone over there then
[4:44] it goes back over there brother I see
[4:47] you oh I see I see uh trees they he you
[4:50] from Pines oh you come from the Lost
[4:53] Pine area of California on he call it
[4:57] out like that God has no respected
[4:58] person a farest moves and he go wherever
[5:02] he Wills amen is that right and the sons
[5:06] of God are like that they're
[5:08] unpredictable led by the spirit of God
[5:11] sons of God are led by the spirit of God
[5:14] and the wind blows worthless and no man
[5:17] knows what they're going to do next and
[5:19] that unpredictability is what uh gets
[5:23] the devil heart attack and give him all
[5:25] kinds of problems cuz he doesn't know
[5:27] what you're going to do next that's why
[5:29] re ation is our deadly weapon is that
[5:33] right you see you reading a book The
[5:35] Devil can read it too he's reading over
[5:37] your shoulder and you talking brother BR
[5:40] said you think you're going to use your
[5:42] brain or your mind or your your
[5:44] intelligence to uh defeat Satan he said
[5:48] he's a being that was there before this
[5:51] world was formed and he had 6,000 years
[5:54] of practice with his lies and tricks and
[5:57] everything else and you come along with
[5:59] 50 60 70 whatever even if you have 200
[6:03] you going to think you're going to
[6:04] challenge him with
[6:06] intelligence you can't do it but
[6:09] Revelation now Revelation everybody
[6:12] that's true child of God is subject to
[6:14] that you can be sitting there and you're
[6:16] not even doing nothing and revelation
[6:18] will be pouring into your heart amen see
[6:22] Prophet says as long as you don't say
[6:24] anything he doesn't know what what's
[6:27] been revealed to you he said that's the
[6:29] reason why I know better when certain
[6:32] things are revealed to me not to say
[6:35] them until it happens and then it's too
[6:38] late he can't do anything to muddy the
[6:40] waters says because if you speak it
[6:42] sometimes before the time the devil will
[6:44] run ahead mess up everything mudy the
[6:46] waters and everything else praise God so
