that need for you he'll speak to the situations in your lives i know that he'll do that because he is still a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of our hearts amen praise god god bless you we're going to be starting from uh number 14 number 14 tonight we're just gonna continue um along the uh the lines of what we were ministering on sunday let's just pray before we go to the word father what an honor one what a privilege tonight lord to be once again in this atmosphere father where your spirit comes lord and and takes us into heavenly places it's an atmosphere where all things are

continue to strengthen him encourage him lord give him rest that he has need a father and lord bring him back full and ready to release once again and set aside for your glory lord we just commit this service tonight anoint speaker and hear father in jesus name amen praise god uh we're going to continue our thought on sunday was that um that god has called us and is calling us to our position amen it's important to understand that you know if he's calling you if he's called your name if you've if you've recognized the word for this day and for this hours because god placed within you an attribute of himself a part of himself there's no way that you would have been able to recognize this this miraculous word that we are feeding on it's different from everything else that we hear out there christianity uh you know that we've known many of us understand that um it's like it's like a different language altogether and why is that because god speaks by revelation he reveals his mind and his thoughts directly divinely to each and every attribute of god amen praise god let's read um so this this um particular slide is talking about how you are foreknown amen god knew you before we came here before he did anything he already knew exactly who each and every one of us were that we had a certain name that that that he said my sheep will hear my voice and they will recognize they will be given um special ears to hear amen special eyes to see amen praise god he says here for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called he's called you and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified may the lord add his blessings tonight you may be seated what a wonderful scripture you know he foreknew you not only did he foreknew you for know you he actually predestinated you because he knew that when the word was going to come to you you would say amen to the word you would have that special ability to recognize that he was speaking to you in your day in the time the dispensation here we are in the 21st century the word has been progressing all the way along you see god was god from the beginning when adam and eve fell in the garden of eden there was a curse that came upon the earth what did that curse do separate us from god amen then god all down through the old testament through each and every patriarch from abraham all the way down to malachi all the patriarchs in between what was he doing he was revealing himself in tight form the word being expressed always in tight form he was god he was he was god of the old the lord of the old testament jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new testament it's the same person it's always been jesus christ it's always been the lord one god not three in the offices there are three in one you know father son and holy ghost that's all that's all confusion that's paganism amen when when you've come to a revelation of who god is you'll realize that there's only one god and it's been the same god right from the very beginning and he's expressing himself amen praise god and all down through those you know prophets coming down it was always christ in them showing vindicating joseph showing in type form all the way down every single time it was god in human flesh through prophets revealing himself in son of man ministries now we come into his ministry where he comes to the earth where he is he now expresses himself not as son of god but as son of man amen because son of man is where god himself comes into mortal flesh takes on human flesh and becomes flesh the word was made flesh and dwelt among us so he was expressing himself now in a human form then he gave up the ghost right he gave up himself at calvary and then he sent back the holy spirit then the holy spirit comes down then he's he's speaking to all the churches revealing himself there he was back in in the office of son of god not in son of man it wasn't until brother branham came on the scene that he became son of man again now it was god in human flesh again amen god showing that he was going to come back and restore all things why because everything that took place back in the garden of eden had to be restored into the fullness right at the end it's where adam and eve get fully re restored the first adam fell the second adam spirit of resurrection comes back restores everything now here we are being restored eve being back placed positionally back into our position but here he is he's still here in son of man ministry where in you and me you see this is all part of god's great plan of redemption amen but it's so important for us to recognize that because when you can see that you can see your your position your placing in the word how important it is for you now to recognize your part because you're saying well he's calling me to to a position what position what is it that i'm supposed to do you are christ now being revealed you are eve the female part of jesus christ now being revealed in human flesh amen praise god you've got a ministry this is our ministry that's why you know like if if you did receive brother branham because he was the first fruits of that ministry so brother branham had to come and reveal he he he he was he was expressing everything that that abraham did you know as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be when the son of man luke 17 30 is being revealed right you know doing all the things that abraham that god did with abraham now god is doing it with you and me amen praise god abraham and his wife christ and his bride it's all type forms everything all the way down through it praise god hallelujah amen let's look at the next slide oops sorry hang on a minute let me go back to that that'll be slide 15. we're just going to be looking at scriptures here tonight and um and and it's just gonna it's just gonna solidify and you know kind of bring some reality to our purpose our calling you know why god has called us amen and and that you know when he called you there was no coincidence in him calling you romans 8 28 and we know that all things everything not some things all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose amen and so you can look back on your life you can look back on yesterday you can look back at this morning this afternoon i don't care look back whatever you did whatever you know you might have had some some you could have had a tough day today okay you could have had a great day today regardless it's all working for good everything that you're facing everything that you're dealing with all the trials everything that's coming your way is because god knew that it would work for your good in this dimension it's only in this dimension that we need things to work for our good because when you're fully restored as a son of god or a daughter of god there'll be no sin in you no unbelief to deal with nothing to be ashamed of nothing to to you know to to to to bring you down and and make you feel you know unworthy and defeated and sometimes you know you feel like you're a failure and you go through all kinds of situations regardless of what you go through it's for your good hallelujah you believe that amen i believe that with all of my heart praise god next slide says our ways are god ordained next slide having a problem with the slide no praise god it's got to be good that's why amen our ways are god-ordained psalms 37 23-25 regardless of what you might think you know you might make certain decisions and you think oh you know like i had to think this all out and i had to get some advice and i had to go and see a counselor and everything else i don't care what you did if you are an attribute son or daughter of god there is no coincidences in your life because everything will lead you right back to his plan the steps of a god man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand i have been young and now i can say i'm feeling older yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread so there is nothing that can separate you from god's purpose and will and call upon your life absolutely nothing amen slide 17 god knows everything about you he knows everything about you for thou has possessed my reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well he's talking my soul knoweth right well you know david was inspired you know he was under that inspire he knew that the attribute that was within him the part of god it knew everything was was was just fine you know do you have those days where you know where you just feel so blessed you know you've had a rough day you've had maybe a rough week but then god just comes and reveals his thoughts to you and just lets you know that you know everything is good everything's fine don't you think that i made you perfect don't you know that i wonderfully made your body and if i wonderfully made it i can fix it you know all the things that we have to deal with the pains and this and the sickness and everything else but he he wonderfully made you why would you worry that he can't wonderfully fix you this is about taking your position with confidence as a son or a daughter of god and not having to live by fear do not govern don't do not allow your life to be governed by fear don't don't listen to the doctor's report he's given his report that's fine you're not going to turn around and and you know uh insult him and say well you know you can say this and that i don't believe what you're saying what are you going to the doctor for you can go to the doctor you can listen to his report but you've got a revelation in your heart to know that that you're a called son or daughter of god if god needs you to fulfill his word and you've got more work to do on this earth guess what he's going to heal you he's going to fix you he's going to restore you he knows exactly what you my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth man we can look back and see how we were you know we we we hit bottom a lot of times in our lives amen we were going through a lot of different ups and downs saints but god knew what he was doing he was molding and shaping amen next slide psalms 139 thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them my god he knew everything he saw you you know even though you felt you were unperfect you might even think tonight you're not perfect you're not as a human but as an attribute of god there's perfection because it is god alleluia how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them if i should count them they are more in number than the sand when i awake i am still with thee he's always there he's always wanting to make a way for you regardless of your circumstances he's always going to make a way for you it may not come in the time that you want it to come but it will come amen it will come because god's will must be done you are an heir next slide to eternal life oh where are we here oh you're one slide too far go back one number 20. first john 5 11 it says and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but his past from death unto life is already passed he's talking that life that he's talking about is like what we're talking about on sunday that life is god's life the light of god is the attribute of god in you that's what the light of god is that's what the life of god is amen this life that we live by here on earth it is also by god because all things live by and are consistent by the power of god amen praise god but then there's an attribute in you which is eternal that is that's why it says here to us eternal life he hath given unto us an attribute eternal life amen praise god romans 5 next slide justified by his blood it says but god hath commended his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him everything is through christ everything is through the word that's why that when we apply the blood of jesus christ on every situation regardless of that situation you apply the blood what is the blood the word you're applying the word to every situation in your life every circumstance whatever it is god will make a way through that situation for if we when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life his attribute his word amen next slide don't you love the word of god it just keeps just keeps reminding us like like this is this is um you know we're not preaching a big message and you know we're trying to you know preach the mysteries of god and everything else these are things that we need to be reminded of because god has called us to a position so we need to have confidence in that position amen and the only way you're going to have confidence is if you take the word and you believe the word you accept the word you apply the word amen praise god colossians 1 20-23 and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy unblameable unreprovable in his sight how can that possibly be how can that possibly be born in sin shaped an iniquity speaking lies you know but here now he's made a way that that that he's going to present us completely washed through the blood amen hallelujah if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard you see you know like you can you can get away from the word you can move away from the word you can you can get lazy you can get lazy because the word is not going to stop moving on the word will continue to progress it'll it's not going to it's not gonna wait for anything the word will progress and as you receive the word you apply the word you you you come into the you you come into the the season of the word because the word is is progressing and so it's important that you're catching the revelation of christ in the day that you're living in that's why this message now with christ in the five-fold ministry remember he's he's under the son of man ministry now in human flesh he came down 1963 the whole body was being built up all through the seven church ages but then when the seven church ages came to an end which they did they came to an end under the son of god ministry because god was dealing with the churches and what were they doing they were putting them out of the church what happened in the laodicean church age he's outside of the church knocking why because they put them out because of their doctrines because of their own teachings you know just go back and read the seven church ages that was god dealing with the church amen but now he's dealing with you and me as individuals he's come to call us individually now personally because in 1963 when the head came down you know the cloud in the shape of the head that that was not just a coincidence that was christ now because when the body is fully built up everything was being built up the eyes you can go back and you can see all kinds of quotes where brother brahms was talking about the legs the arms the mouth was the time you know where they were where it was all the preaching going on and and then the eyes the scene age you know the prophet comes on the scene now and what happens what's next the intelligence the head the thoughts what are the thoughts the thoughts of god what are the thoughts of god why did he have to come down in 1963 now the intelligence coming down to the body that's already been built and finished now it needs intelligence what is the intelligence the thoughts what are the thoughts the attributes who are the attributes you and me hallelujah god calling you by your name because you are one of his thoughts you are one of his attributes because the body's got to be complete eve's got to be fully restored she's got to be put back into a condition where she will not fall hallelujah this is the bride age this is the age where the bride takes her position she she moves into her position she's going to get tested she's going to get tried she's going to be tested by that same devil hallelujah but this time she doesn't fall hallelujah she can't fall why because the intelligence has now come and taken possession of her he says take the book revelations 10 8-11 he says take the book eat the book feed on the book hallelujah because you've got another ministry you've got something that's got to be fulfilled now this bride has a ministry she must prophesy again what is what do you mean prophesy again what just repeat everything that's already been said no there are sons and daughters of god that need to be called into their position and the holy spirit now needs a body on earth in human flesh to speak and to call every son and daughter of god into their position that's why we've heard him call our name but why is he calling our name to place us to position us so that he can take this body to the next stage which is what the rapture let me have a drink hallelujah what a word what a time what a season glory to god listen to brother branham here next slide okay actually 23 yeah you're right we are more than conquerors amen praise god more than conquers romans 8 37 nay in all faith all these things we are more uh more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord there is nothing that can separate an attribute of god because it is god you need to recognize i'm not saying oh you are god you are god i'm not saying that you are attributes of god you are portions of god you are the thoughts of god but you're now being expressed and manifested here on this earth and you're doing that for a purpose god has a purpose in doing that listen to brother branham uh next slide the church has god's power the church has god's word that's what we have it's not that you've got power because you know god sent a prophet there's a lot of people talking about god sent a prophet god sent a prophet all they want to do is give tracts don't you know god sent a prophet if you don't believe that god sent a prophet you're not going to be you're not going to go to heaven no sir that's not going to be that's not the message of the hour god sent a prophet for a purpose you need to know what that purpose is you need to know that it was to restore the word to restore all things remember the curse in the in the beginning of the garden separated us from god the restoration of the word reunites us back with the word amen and so you need to recognize why god sent a prophet you need to know what his ministry was and that without that ministry we couldn't have this one it's as simple as that a lot of people oh you follow a man you follow a man well what do you what what did when moses took the children of israel out of egypt what was it what was it was it a man that they were following or was it a god sent prophet with thus saith the lord to give them the word to recognize what it was that god was going to do in that day had they not listened to moses that had never gone through the red sea those that disbelieved what happened to them they perished it's that simple god's always operated in that way but you need to understand how god is operating and what god has done recognize the dispensations and the times and the seasons for the word of god and without brother branham coming to restore the word to be that first wave chief of the son of man ministry stood before people discerning their hearts and their lives and their conditions just like abraham when he was with with uh with sarah and and melchizedek came and visited with him and was telling him all about what was what was going to come what was going to happen and discerned everything and showed exactly what he was going to do in the last days because it was as it was in the days of sodom he was going to do it all over again but it was for a purpose to restore eve to restore the church amen praise god so brother braham says well i'm afraid that the church doesn't know their authority amen i'm afraid that that holy ghost born men doesn't realize their authority that god has permitted to his church amen praise god we need to recognize our position and the authority that god has given to us as sons and daughters of god your life and your your circumstances and your conditions they do not need to remain the same you can live above sin you can live with with an expectation in your heart because god has given you his word and his word is authority give unto thee the keys to the kingdom whatsoever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven whatsoever you loose will be loosed i will give you power over serpents and over all kinds of diseases why do you fear covet we should not fear covet i'm not saying you shouldn't wear masks and you absolutely there's nothing wrong with that because the disease is out there and covet can hit you in your body it all depends on your faith it all depends you know where you're at so so i'm not going to say you know you know don't don't don't worry about covid i'm just saying don't fear it it cannot take your life only god can take you and because you are called for a purpose you you're you're not called to die by covet okay you're not it's you know like could it happen are people dying of covet yes they're dying of covet in the message yes people in the message why because it was their time to go whether god used coven whether god used cancer whether god used a heart attack what all of a sudden you know no see we don't fear disease we don't fear sickness we are sons and daughters of god amen but we live in a world that's afflicted by those things so we don't turn around and make ourselves better than others and start you know you know saying oh well you know what colvin can't touch me and you know like i'm i'm definitely see no you should just know that in your heart you should know who you are and where you stand as a son or a daughter of god that's it you don't have to boast you don't have to there'll be times where you will testify sure god will use your you to testify amen disease oh everything and nothing shall harm you exercise your faith let it loose let god have his way god will grant it to you if you just let god have his way in your life just believe only believe amen praise god next slide joshua stop the son is that true yes somebody said all things are possible with god nothing is impossible simple right we've read the word but all things are possible to you also nothing impossible to them that believe all things are possible brought right down and made you if you just know who god was amen praise god forevermore next slide but how will this thing work acts 2 38 you know he's still the same yesterday today and forever you know there's some that are maybe on youtube tonight that are hearing the word and you know they they want to know well what what must we do well it's he's still the same he's still the same god acts 2 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost still the same amen praise god for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call praise god god is still calling sheep god is still calling the little lambs amen praise god he still does it the same way he does not change god hides in simplicity you know so if you're going to be you know if if god is calling you and god has called you because you have a purpose he's not going to change the way he calls you he's still going to bring you through the process of the call the first thing that you're going to do when god calls you because you're gonna realize that you're a sinner that's the first thing that happens when somebody receives a call from god you know like sometimes you hear that altar call and people come to the altar you know that's that's great it's wonderful it's how everything starts but what happens in that individual they repent they realize that they're sinners they realize that they've been living a life of unbelief and it causes them to repent and when they repent then they need to take a dip into the water as a type the water doesn't do anything you you could go down a a a wet center and come up or go down a dry center and come up a wet sinner it's not the water that does anything to you the water and the baptism is showing that something took place inside something has something has caused you to recognize that god is a reality that all things are possible with god and then the word says be baptized what is it it's it's being buried in the water is a symbol of being baptized is that your old life gets buried in the water you come out fresh and new and you're washed by the blood not by the water but by the life of jesus christ and now all things are possible for you all things are new it says you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and the gift of the holy ghost is everything it's everything to a son or daughter of god because it's the quickening power that's gonna that's going to save you from this dimension that's going into tribulation things are not going to get better here on earth things are only going to get tougher and rougher and tribulation is going to set in and there's going to be a a great tribulation praise god but there's going to be a church a bride that goes in the rapture that gets taken out before that it's just an interdimensional change that's all it is i mean it's a great thing it's not that it's all it is it's a phenomenal thing but it's going to be in a moment in the twinkling of an eye you're going to be changed you're going to move from this dimension into that other dimension but this earth is going to go into great tribulation but then you got to read on if you look through the you know you read on to the book of revelation we can't get into all of that again tonight but you look on there is there's there's a thousand years of peace on the earth after the great tribulation and we as sons and daughters of god come back for another thousand years to rule with christ where there will be peace on earth a real government not this shamble that we've got here in the world right now where all the the the world governments it's just it's all it's all corrupt it's all political corruption it's just the way it is you know you don't know what to believe anymore and look at the you know the wars are already starting things are coming together things are gonna come you know they're not gonna get better you know like oh you christians all you talk about is you know things are gonna get worse no we're not no things are gonna get better for for sons and daughters of god it's just part of the plan of god and there's nothing that we can do to change it it's god's plan amen praise god so be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind what do you think's happening tonight we're not being brainwashed we're being taken out of the spiritual amnesia that we were under when we were living in sin and that amnesia is being lifted from us and that's what happens when you receive the holy ghost when you when you receive the the the word of god you get washed by the word amen and you get renewed that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god in your life hallelujah next slide so what do we got to do we got to hold our position first corinthians 15 57 therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast immovable always abounding in the work of the lord knowing that your toil is not in vain in the lord you've got to keep pressing on saints saints it's getting harder and harder it's not easy to live the word of god it's getting tougher there's people that are falling away because it's getting tough it's getting harder you know the the you know the you're looking around life and you see the world condition and the things that are going on and people are saying man uh you know what i i i just want to live i just want to you know i just want to enjoy i don't know how many more years i'm going to have left on this earth it just shows that there's there's there's some carnality in their thinking and that they really they they need to have that that experience that closer walk with the lord amen it's not going to get easier for us don't think just because you serve god that it's going to get easier it doesn't get easier you're still going to get tested by the revelation that you receive as you grow in christ as you mature in christ you'll get tested on that maturity to see if you really can you know stand the test it's not so that god can know that you can do it god already knows what his attribute is going to do but he needs you to know why you were called and what authority and what ability has been placed in you and that you can overcome not that you can you will overcome this is the age to them that overcome will i allow to sit with me where in the throne what's the throne it's it's it's a position of authority as sons of god and daughters of god when we come back for the 1000 year millennium the thing that you are going to have when you come back is wisdom character and the ability to rule as a son of god so therefore my beloved be steadfast immovable always abounding in the work of the lord knowing that your toil is not in vain next next slide forget the past and look on to the future too many people are carrying the sins of the past they keep going to god for the same things you repented of it you placed it under the blood two weeks later you're feeling guilty again about what you did 10 years ago what is that that's a devil that's a devil trying to put you under condemnation trying to make you doubt that the blood of christ the word says them who he called he justified you know you look up the word justified justified means that you never did it in the first place your sin is gone it's it's washed under the blood this is so powerful saints to live a life that now you don't take your liberty and and turn it into disgrace but you you are the freest human beings on this planet as sons and daughters of god but you're not to take that freedom and make it you know a disgrace to the word and a reproach against god but you are free you're not to be uh you know can you know condemned by your past my god brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do you know paul finally caught a revelation about it because you know paul had to live think about paul okay paul was called and he was the word in his day he had to manifest the word in his time and he was called and imagine what he had to walk with all this all the christians that he had killed imagine but he finally caught a revelation and he was able to put it behind and says forgetting those things which are behind i gotta forget about those things because those things they're of this earth i can't take them to that other dimension you cannot take all your money all you that that are afraid to give all you that are afraid that you're not gonna have enough you know he's jehovah jireh he's jehovah that that he owns a thousand cows on a thousand hills a million cows on a tower whatever he owns it all and you're worried about what you're worried about your your needs it not not in this hour not at this time in season where the word is manifesting and and finalizing all things adam and eve when they were in the garden of eden and they hadn't fallen yet they had dominion over the earth whatever they spoke whatever they wanted they would tell this tree to move they would speak to the animals they would sit with the lions they would do they had dominion amen we are being restored back to that hallelujah so the only way you can do that as a son of god that you can you know overcome in this life because like i said we're not gonna it's not gonna be easy you're gonna have to overcome but you'll have a much better chance if you're not carrying a whole bunch of guilt and living by the sins of the past and constantly going back to god and saying oh lord i know that that was just so bad that i you know what i did and he's going what are you talking about it's gone he placed it in the sea of his forgetfulness so he says reaching forth unto those things which are before he says i press towards the mark of the prize of the high calling of god in christ that's what we should be doing pressing on pressing forward amen next slide be truly committed to christ oh did i double slide okay sorry sorry cast off the works of darkness romans 13. so don't let darkness come in to your life cast it off you know satan's going to be there and speaking in your left ear listen in the right ear to what the word says because he's right satan's wrong you know cast off the works of darkness cast off the lies put put put put away those those those evil thoughts and deeds and that knowing the time that now is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed everything is drawing closer and closer to the completion amen the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light next slide be truly committed to christ committed people have passion and dedication show it show it in your actions show it in your attitude if you're a real christian you should be a happy person you should be a positive person you should be you know your atmosphere when you come into a conversation it should bring life it should bring positivity positive atmospheres you know look for the good stay away from the bad committed people refuse all distractions just to achieve his goal committed people will always find a way to attain his main purpose when you're committed to something you accept no excuses only results amen praise god we are the sons of god we are the ones that will fulfill this word maintaining your position james 4 submit yourselves therefore to god resist the enemy how do you overcome certain temptations resist it that's all just don't entertain it push it away don't speak it don't let your lips speak the negativity amen and he will flee the devil will flee if you just do what the word says if you need to say it in your mind you know somebody comes up to you and they're saying things to you and they're telling you all negative things and they're telling you how bad you are and you know this and that just just resist the thoughts okay resist and do not accept those thoughts let the word replace those things that are being said i am more than a conqueror through christ i am able all things are possible because i am a believer amen draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded amen praise god next slide as we're winding down here last couple slides fight a good fight of faith first timothy 6 12 fight the good fight of faith you gotta you gotta overcome saints you're gonna have to fight to maintain your position when a soldier is called to a certain position and he's to hold that position he's got to fight to hold that position you're going to have to overcome to hold your position in christ amen we're unto thou art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses hebrews 12 1-2 says let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus who is the author and the finisher he started a work in you don't you fear he's going to finish it hallelujah glory to god amen perseverance and trial james 1 12 says blessed is the man who pre perseveres under trial because when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life that god has promised to those who love him there's a saying every test in your life makes us bitter or better every problem comes to break us or make us the choice is ours whether we become victim or victor you have the ability to choose you have the ability to decide you have the ability to resist unbelief god has given you all of that next slide his grace is sufficient so when you get to a place where you you've done all that you can and you know that there's nothing more that you can do because you've done what you can you've prayed you've done all that you know as a son or daughter of god then you wait on the lord and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness don't fear weakness not when you've genuinely done everything that you can you've done all that you can you can't do anymore your your your battle is has has weakened you and now you're at a point where there's just no more that you can do and you feel like you're giving up don't worry at your weakest point that's where his strength comes on the scene most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me so in other words when you're down and out and you've got problems and you're surrounded by it glory in it glory in it because you can know assuredly that the power of christ is upon you to overcome because you've got that clear revelation and you've got that relationship with christ therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distress for christ's sake for when i am weak then i am strong praise god forevermore ephesians 6 be strong in the lord finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil isaiah 41 says fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness for i the lord thy god will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not i will help thee amen praise god this is a quote here i i just put this because we're finished now i put this quote in here because it was it was something that came up on i think it was either saturday or sunday and brother tim and i were talking about it but it was a it was a beautiful quote about you know you know how we've been talking about here now just bring your mind back to your part in the word your position in the word that you are the word of god now in this day and brother branham was the wave sheep he was the one that was there fulfilling his portion of the word and he had to bear a reproach but he was the word being manifested right there before the people and here he's talking he says now i want you to know this this is sure this is from the anointed ones at the end time and you that listen to this tape you might have thought today that i was trying to say that about myself being that i was packing this message like in other words like he's talking about how you know that that he was that he was the the word that was come down you know the anointed word for this day and for this hour and you know that you know he was he was the prophet of malachi 4 5. he was fulfilling revelations 10 7. but here you know he was trying to tell the people hey don't think i was talking about myself you need to recognize the word so when we're talking about fulfilling our ministry and you know you you tell people about that you know that the word is now being fulfilled in our lives you you should you should you know understand that this is truth this is what's actually happening you are manifesting you are fulfilling you are are revealing christ in this day in a many membered body this time and he says i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice you see they wanted to make him god because you know the perversion is that well he is god you know brother branham was god we need to baptize in the name of brother branham you see you see all the the the perversions of the enemy but here now we need to realize what was really taking place and my voice even against my better judgment i wanted to be a trapper but it's the will of my father that i declare to you and to determine to you i wasn't the one that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happen as perfect they are i'm only one that's near when he does it see he was showing the son of man ministry in his day he was showing that it was christ doing it all that's why you are not god but you are an attribute of god and you are fulfilling the word in your day and it's not something to be ashamed of it's a reality i was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what i knew it wasn't it's what i just surrendered myself to do that he spoke through you see all we can do is surrender and allow the holy spirit to work through our lives amen it wasn't it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was it was through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man you see he was revealing the stage the present stage of of christ's ministry that was being introduced to the earth at that time and this is just months before he went off the scene but he was showing that he was manifesting now in a son of man ministry and that it was christ himself now come down and it's christ in you it's christ in the bride it's christ in the five-fold ministry that's revealing and and completing we we complete this cycle before the rapture the rapture is the completion of this season this this dispensation we complete it when we go in the rapture amen oh no it's not a man it's god the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man amen that's what we're feeding on right now glory to god if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to fly above all these denominations and things of the world will you at this time do it while we pray let the musicians come last slide and then we're going to go to prayer get out of your condition whatever it might be and rise up to your position understand the seriousness of this hour understand the call of god upon your life it's not that you like don't take this in the wrong way and think oh i gotta do this and i gotta do that and i gotta try and i gotta try and consecrate myself more and you know i gotta i gotta pray eight hours a day because no just be yourself but recognize who you are just be yourself but recognize the hour that we're living in this is the completion this is where eve gets fully restored she gets fully tested and she goes in the rapture let us pray father i can't put the words on what is in my heart lord completely lord these words this these quotes these scriptures lord i realize you've got to write these words with your spirit into the hearts of each and every individual son and daughter of god this is not something that we can study up that we can that we can by intellectual understanding grasp this is supernatural revelation your thoughts divinely revealed and inspired to each and every attribute son and daughter of god so that they can come out of any spiritual amnesia that still remains lord we're growing we're maturing we're letting go of the things of this world overcoming lord even our own selves and lord we are the worst enemy ourselves because we get weak we get tired we get angry at times lord we get affected by this dimension and the things that constantly bombard our minds the advertising the social media all the things that lord would try to take away the victory that we have in you the lord i'm praying tonight father for each and every son and daughter of god each and every individual that would hear these words tonight lord
