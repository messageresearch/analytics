[18:14] eternal God. We come to thy throne as
[18:17] sinners save by grace. We so grateful.
[18:20] Father, we so thankful for making a way
[18:23] for us to be here.
[18:25] Pray that you search our heart, our
[18:27] mind, our thoughts, our conscious,
[18:30] unconscious. Anything unlike you, we
[18:32] bring it under the altar. And you gave
[18:35] us that promise that the blood of Christ
[18:37] washes us from all unbelief. Father, I
[18:40] pray that you take me aside. Help me to
[18:43] get myself out of the way so that you
[18:46] can speak to your children. Father, we
[18:48] come against anything contrary to the
[18:51] word. Let your true Holy Ghost have his
[18:54] free course.
[18:55] have preeminence and speak to your
[18:58] children. May we not leave here the same
[19:00] way we came. May they come and feed with
[19:04] the king and know that and left and
[19:10] praising God and saying did not
[19:14] ours within us as he spoke unto us. May
[19:19] everyone that is here be blessed. those
[19:22] online bless everyone and you come
[19:24] against any contrary spirit let your
[19:27] true holy ghost have reminisence and
[19:30] bless the reading of the word in Jesus
[19:32] name amen okay I have couple of
[19:35] scriptures
[19:40] um my first scripture will be taken from
[19:44] Galatians 4
[19:46] 27:31 Galatians 4:27:31
[19:52] one. If you got it, say amen. For it is
[19:57] written, rejoice, thou barren that beest
[20:04] not. Break forth and
[20:07] cry, thou that travest not, for the
[20:11] desolate had many more children than she
[20:15] which had an husband.
[20:18] Now we brethren as Isaac was are the
[20:20] children of promise. But as then he that
[20:24] has been after the flesh persecute
[20:27] persecuted him that was born after the
[20:29] spirit even so it is
[20:33] now.
[20:35] Nevertheless what said the
[20:37] scripture cast out the bond woman and
[20:40] her son for the son of the bond woman
[20:43] shall not be heir with the son of the
[20:45] free woman. So then, brethren, we are
[20:48] not children of the bond woman, but of
[20:51] the free. In Ephesians
[20:54] 1:37, blessed be God and father of our
[20:57] Lord Jesus Christ, who had blessed us
[20:59] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[21:03] places in Christ Jesus, according as he
[21:08] had chosen us in him when before the
[21:11] foundation of the world, that we should
[21:13] be holy and without blame before him in
[21:17] love, having predestinated us onto the
[21:22] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[21:25] himself
[21:27] according to the good pleasure of his
[21:30] will. I always say that people ask why
[21:33] did God do this? Why did God is explain
[21:36] is God having pleasure. So you don't
[21:39] have to question God. is a sovereign God
[21:42] to praise of the glory of his grace
[21:46] wherein he had made us accepted in the
[21:49] beloved in whom we have redemption
[21:53] through his blood the forgiveness of
[21:56] sins according the riches of his grace
[21:59] and my last one that I'm going to base
[22:02] my thought on who so in is 1 John
[22:08] 3:9 John chapter 3:9 9 it says whosoever
[22:13] is born of God do not commit sin for the
[22:18] for his seat remed in him and he cannot
[22:22] sin because he is born of God. So my
[22:26] title today is um only a seed of God can
[22:32] be reborn. Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[22:36] may you please bless the reading of the
[22:38] word and bless your children. Amen.
[22:40] Please be seated. So my title tonight is
[22:46] that only a seed of
[22:49] God can be reborn. You can never be born
[22:54] again unless you are a seed of God.
[22:58] Amen. To that to be truly born again,
[23:02] there has to be a seed of God in you
[23:04] before you can be reborn. In the
[23:07] churches, Abraham said, "And now then
[23:11] here we are coming out to a conclusion
[23:15] as the eternal logos God was infinite in
[23:19] the sun."
[23:21] There's church ages the Samrian church
[23:25] age and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness
[23:28] of the godhead bodily and that eternal
[23:32] one was the father manifest in flesh and
[23:35] thereby gain the title of son. Even so,
[23:39] we eternal in his thoughts in our in our
[23:43] 10 became the many member spoken word
[23:46] seed manifest in flesh. And those
[23:50] eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh
[23:54] are the sons of God. Even as we are so
[23:59] called, we did not become seed by the
[24:03] rebirth.
[24:06] We did not become a seed by the
[24:08] rebirth. We were seed and therefore were
[24:13] reborn were reborn. For only the elect
[24:17] can be
[24:18] reborn because we were seed is the
[24:22] reason we could be quickened in none
[24:24] seed. There is nothing to quicken.
[24:28] Amen. So tonight you are here. If you've
[24:32] been quickened by the word of God, it
[24:35] means that there's something inside of
[24:37] you. Because there's no way you can be
[24:40] genuinely reborn without having the seed
[24:43] of God in you. And if you have been able
[24:47] to receive the word of God for the
[24:51] present stage of his ministry, then you
[24:54] have to thank God because not everybody
[24:59] have that ability to receive the word
[25:01] for the day. Amen. And recently I read
[25:04] an art an article where a
[25:08] multi-billionaire was saying that the
[25:10] most dangerous thing that people do is
[25:13] when they base their success in the past
[25:17] and base it on what is going to future
[25:20] and they fail to live the moment. When
[25:24] you bring it back to the word of God,
[25:26] there are so many people who praise God
[25:28] for what God has done in the past, what
[25:30] God is going to do in the future, they
[25:33] fail to recognize what God is doing in
[25:35] the present tense. Amen. But as you are
[25:39] eagle sitting here, every eagle is not
[25:44] like a hawk. He can go higher than hawk.
[25:46] Hawk can sometimes just sit on the poles
[25:49] and then just around and eat anything.
[25:52] But an eagle go higher and he can only
[25:55] eat on what? Fresh food. Fresh cat. An
[25:59] eagle never eat on dead substance. He's
[26:03] always on what? Fresh food. Amen. So if
[26:08] you're a son or daughter of God, you
[26:12] eating fresh word of God for today. You
[26:16] cannot be satisfied with the past word
[26:21] because eagle eat fresh food, fresh
[26:23] kill. And the sons and daughters of God
[26:27] are able to recognize what God is doing
[26:30] now while they are living. They can know
[26:34] what part of the thing to play. Because
[26:38] if you have those seed of God in you,
[26:41] you always going to be playing the past
[26:43] or the future. But you can't recognize
[26:46] what God is doing for your present
[26:49] day. So when I talk about the seed and
[26:54] being reborn, it's all in the Bible from
[26:58] Genesis to Revelation, you can find it
[27:02] everywhere that those who are seed of
[27:06] God, they are able to receive the word
[27:08] of God and they are able to what?
[27:12] receive revelation and they able to
[27:14] what? Please God. But those who are non
[27:18] seed, they always try to push themsel
[27:24] ahead and try to be like they are but
[27:28] they cannot. They become like hawks.
[27:31] They fall in between. Somewhere said
[27:35] that Cain could not give excellence
[27:39] could not go and give excellent
[27:41] sacrifice that Abel made even though God
[27:45] gave me an opportunity and said if you
[27:48] have done like what your brother did I
[27:51] could have what heared you. So in other
[27:53] words he was telling him to go and do
[27:55] what his brother did and he was going to
[27:57] what be accepted. But he said because
[28:00] there's a wrong seed in him, he couldn't
[28:03] do it. He was so angry and went and
[28:05] killed his brother. So what I'm trying
[28:07] to say is that the non seed, there's
[28:10] nothing to quicken them. They can never
[28:13] please God or do God's will. They in the
[28:18] outside sometimes may appear to be doing
[28:20] something good, but they cannot go all
[28:23] the way far. And it's all in the Bible
[28:27] like Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael was
[28:30] what? Bullying Isaac and Isaac was the
[28:34] promised seed. And we have it all over
[28:37] Jacob and
[28:39] Esau. Esau intellectually outside look
[28:43] good. Abraham said look more gentleman
[28:45] than Jacob. But the Bible said that
[28:48] before the two were even born, the
[28:51] scripture said Jacob have I loved. He so
[28:55] I hate and the children will not even
[28:58] born because God by his full knowledge
[29:02] will not wait for you to be born before
[29:04] he make his decision because he's
[29:07] infinite. He knows to today from
[29:10] tomorrow even right now all of every
[29:14] thought passing through our mind is not
[29:16] hidden from God. And he knew it before
[29:19] the foundation of the world, before even
[29:22] you and I were born that we are going to
[29:24] be sitting here and this preaching will
[29:26] be going on and every thought every
[29:28] aspect nothing is hidden from him. He
[29:32] knows even the hairs on our on our head.
[29:35] So we cannot hide from God. You can you
[29:38] can hide from the people but you can
[29:41] never hide from God because God knows
[29:45] everything. So why will you hide things?
[29:49] Why will you try to hide
[29:51] cover? The only time they did a use
[29:55] religion as a covering is what Adam did.
[29:59] He put a thick leaf on him when he
[30:02] sinned. But God want a blood sacrifice.
[30:05] So he killed animal gave him to cover
[30:08] his himself. So is the people they are
[30:12] hiding behind religion and doing all
[30:15] kind of wicked things. Amen. They have
[30:18] make the Christian to become so cheap
[30:21] that even when you say you are
[30:22] Christian, people don't even know the
[30:24] kind of Christian that you are. They
[30:27] think that you are just a normal people
[30:29] going there claiming the name of Jesus
[30:31] on them. But we are the true children of
[30:34] God. We are the true sons and daughters
[30:36] of God. We are manifestation of the book
[30:41] of fast in the present stage. That same
[30:44] God who was in Peter and Paul and did
[30:47] all those mighty works in them. That God
[30:50] is in you and in me today. If only thou
[30:53] can believe. All things are possible to
[30:56] them that believe. He's the only wise
[30:59] king. He's eternal prince of peace.
[31:02] Mighty God. Before him there's no any
[31:04] other god form. Neither will there be
[31:06] any other god form after him. His name
[31:09] is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[31:12] Amen. He controls
[31:14] everything. He is our everything and he
[31:17] never ever lost a battle because he is
[31:21] God that never change. Amen. So what am
[31:24] I trying to say? We have a lot of Issa
[31:28] spirit even now operating in the message
[31:34] because Jacob's spirit is grace. Amen.
[31:38] And
[31:41] Jacob respect the birth
[31:45] rights. All that God wants from you and
[31:49] me is to respect the birth right. Amen.
[31:53] When Jacob with all his
[31:57] flaws, he grabbed that birth right, he
[32:01] didn't play with it. The Bible said that
[32:04] Esau sought with repentance, but there
[32:08] was no repentance to be found in him. It
[32:10] was too late because those spirit is
[32:15] only for their excuse me
[32:17] belly what they're going to eat today or
[32:20] tomorrow. That's all they thinking
[32:21] about.
[32:23] How on
[32:26] earth will
[32:28] you sell his birth wife for just a pot
[32:31] of
[32:32] porridge? We never seen anybody been
[32:35] hungry and
[32:37] dying. But because he despised it, he
[32:41] just give it up. And so many people, I'm
[32:45] afraid, are using this gospel to to
[32:49] what? as a as a um to enrich
[32:53] themselves. They have used the gospel as
[32:57] a money making
[32:59] scheme. And some people to instead of
[33:02] putting God first, they putting their
[33:05] job, they putting their business, they
[33:07] putting so many things ahead of the
[33:09] gospel. But the Bible said, "I seek ye
[33:12] first the kingdom of God and his
[33:15] righteousness and all other things will
[33:19] be added what?" Unto you. So let's put
[33:21] God first. No matter what comes our way,
[33:25] let's put God first. He will take care
[33:27] of first. If you commit everything to
[33:30] God's hand, even though it might look
[33:34] outside sometimes very like there's no
[33:37] way out, but he makes a way where there
[33:41] seems to be no way. God will always make
[33:44] a way where there seems to be no way
[33:47] because he's the same yesterday, today,
[33:50] and
[33:51] forever. So back to that issue
[33:55] spirit. If the Lord Jesus Christ was to
[33:58] be here, I believe he will still take a
[34:00] cane and wipe so many of them in the
[34:04] pulpit because they are enriching
[34:06] themselves
[34:08] with the gospel.
[34:11] But the Lord Jesus Christ gave himself
[34:14] up. When God calls you to be a minister,
[34:18] a preacher, pastor, you are supposed to
[34:21] be a servant.
[34:23] But not in this modern world.
[34:26] They are enriching themselves and having
[34:30] that issue spirit. It's a balam spirit
[34:34] on the people just like Balam. He what
[34:39] was a what? The false prophet. God
[34:42] revealed to him that if you bless
[34:44] Israel, you'll be blessed. You curse
[34:45] him, you'll be cursed. You can't curse
[34:47] my people. But because of money, he went
[34:51] and took money from the king barrack and
[34:54] he still went ahead tried to curse them.
[34:58] And he was so dumb that even his um what
[35:01] his ass was speaking to him, he couldn't
[35:04] even hear it because all his focus was
[35:07] on the money that he was going to get
[35:10] from the king. I wonder so many people
[35:12] all that they are thinking is money
[35:14] money. There's nothing wrong to get
[35:16] money. Don't get me wrong. We are the
[35:19] people that know how to use money well.
[35:21] We are the people that need the money to
[35:24] use it wisely. But the Bible said love
[35:27] of money is the root of all evil. Money
[35:30] itself is good. But you don't allow that
[35:33] money to use you. You use the money and
[35:37] use it for good purpose. But Bam was
[35:40] blinded by the fame, the re the riches
[35:43] and everything that he not even had
[35:46] anything. And that is what is sometimes
[35:49] going on other people's life. Once they
[35:52] want money, they ignore everything. They
[35:54] ignore all the warning. All that they
[35:57] want. But what are you got? What s
[36:00] profit a man when he gain the whole
[36:03] world and lose his soul.
[36:07] So all that God is asking us is to give
[36:11] him our all in all. Amen. as Peter said
[36:15] because just like the rich young
[36:18] ruler he also has the same kind of
[36:23] didn't have the true seed of God in him
[36:27] and outwardly he was obeying all the
[36:30] rules all the laws from A to Z when the
[36:36] Lord Jesus Christ met him the Bible said
[36:38] the Lord Jesus loved him he said I've
[36:41] obeyed this since my youth
[36:45] But he said, "Thou lackst one
[36:47] thing." That was what his heart was was
[36:51] all his riches. So he said, "Go and sell
[36:54] it and come and follow me." But the cost
[36:58] was so much for him. The Bible said that
[37:00] he left there very what?
[37:03] Sad. Very sad. And you think after he
[37:07] rejected the the the work for the day,
[37:11] he was going to get poor, he got riches
[37:14] and riches and his band was so full that
[37:18] he said that I'm going to enjoy. Then
[37:19] the Bible said that that foolish you
[37:22] think tomorrow is yours and then he
[37:24] couldn't enjoy it and he died. But
[37:26] someone like Peter, someone like Moses,
[37:29] Moses forsook all and follow the Lord
[37:32] Jesus Christ. Amen. And Peter also said,
[37:36] "We have left mothers, fathers,
[37:39] brothers, family and follow you. What
[37:42] are we going to get?" And the Lord said
[37:44] that there's no one that has left all
[37:48] this and followed me that will not be
[37:51] blessed in the present tense and what
[37:55] the world to come. Amen. So if you
[37:59] surrender yourself, if you worship the
[38:03] Lord Jesus Christ, he will bless you
[38:06] abundantly. It might not come the way
[38:09] you expected. But David said, "I have
[38:12] been young and old. I've never seen a
[38:15] righteous forsaken nor his descendants
[38:19] ever begging bread to eat." The Bible
[38:22] said that there's no good thing that God
[38:25] would uphold from those that walk
[38:28] uprightly before him. So once you are
[38:31] walking with God, once you are walking
[38:34] upright with the King of Kings, he will
[38:36] provide your needs. He will never leave
[38:39] you nor forsake you. But so many people
[38:43] they just caught up with the uh present
[38:47] situation and they get so much um kind
[38:50] of minded that they just want to follow
[38:54] just for a minute because the Bible said
[38:59] that
[39:01] Moses who refused to enjoy the pleasures
[39:06] of Egypt for a season and chose to go
[39:10] with our flesh. ation of the
[39:13] Israelites and he made a right choice
[39:17] and tonight you have made a right choice
[39:20] by sacrificing me to be here at this
[39:22] time and God is going to bless you even
[39:25] for the choice that you have made and
[39:28] let's continue to make the right choice
[39:31] even though it might be hard but he said
[39:34] he told the prophet that you have chosen
[39:36] the right way it's a narrow way but it
[39:39] is my way and because of this choice the
[39:42] whole momentum of heaven's source is
[39:45] waiting on you. So is a bride of Christ
[39:47] a compound meaning let's take the narrow
[39:51] way because many are called but few are
[39:54] chosen yet many are the children of the
[39:57] bond woman but the children of the of
[40:00] the of the hus of the of the few men are
[40:03] few.
[40:05] So said little h little flock do not
[40:08] worry. It is your father's kingdom
[40:10] pleasure to work to give you the
[40:13] kingdom. God does not look in their
[40:15] numbers. He look into the heart tonight.
[40:19] If you purpose yourself that I am one
[40:22] person I am the one to be sent to be
[40:25] there for God to use me. And if you
[40:28] purpose and you believe it you are more
[40:31] than a million. One will chase a th00and
[40:33] two will chase 10,000
[40:36] because Moses what did Moses did the
[40:40] Bible said that he became prisoner of
[40:42] Christ and when we are prisoner of
[40:45] Christ we have not our own choice we
[40:49] have not our own way it's God's way to
[40:53] be our way not our own s not our own way
[40:58] and God is was behind our skin because
[41:01] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[41:03] forever. He will never leave you nor
[41:05] forsake you. And
[41:09] Moses forsook everything and follow
[41:13] Jesus. But those who do not have the
[41:18] true seed of God like Dayton and Kora,
[41:22] they challenge
[41:23] Moses. What I'm trying to say is that
[41:27] God will cause separation. Amen. It's
[41:30] not you that going to separate yourself.
[41:33] It's the word of God that will separate.
[41:36] And when Dayton and Korab challenge
[41:39] Moses, when the showdown came, what did
[41:42] God did? He told Moses to just get out
[41:44] of the way. And on that day, he opened
[41:47] the what the the earth and swallowed
[41:50] thousands of them for following data and
[41:53] Kora and God separated them. Amen. But
[41:57] oh man, there was someone out of if you
[42:01] read the Bible, it says that the
[42:04] children of Israel, they have were fed
[42:08] by the angels. They have mana, spitting
[42:11] rocks, they received the battle, they
[42:13] have all those
[42:15] things. But they were heart was not
[42:17] pleased with God. And only two who had
[42:22] the right seed who were able to be born
[42:25] again. The Bible said that Joshua and
[42:27] Caleb they were of of different spirit.
[42:32] So it's you and me. We are of a
[42:34] different spirit. That's why you can
[42:37] receive the word for the day and and
[42:39] believe it and leave this present day
[42:42] ministry because we have a different
[42:45] spirit and that different spirit we have
[42:48] is a rapturing spirit is a quickening
[42:51] power. Amen. The Holy Ghost in us it
[42:54] help us to choose the right way, the
[42:58] narrow way. Even though it's hard but we
[43:01] chose that narrow way. Sometime you
[43:03] can't see your way forward but you still
[43:05] trust in God. Sometimes everything fall
[43:08] apart but you have confidence in God and
[43:11] one day when all is dark he comes on the
[43:13] scene and change things and change
[43:16] situation. Amen. Amen. Just like Joshua
[43:19] and Caleb they said that they
[43:20] uncircumcised Philistines. We're going
[43:23] to get rid of them. Our God will give
[43:25] deliver them to us. So it's you and me.
[43:29] And God will deliver has delivered Satan
[43:31] to you. Satan has no power over you.
[43:34] He's just a bluff. He was defeated on
[43:37] Calvary. Death, hell, and grave were
[43:40] defeated. Amen. He died for you so that
[43:43] you can give yourself blessing. Give him
[43:45] push. Give him that a boot. I went to
[43:49] enemy's camp and I took up what he stole
[43:52] from me. Whatever the Satan has taken
[43:54] from you, you have the right to get it.
[43:56] It's a jubilee time. It's a redemption
[43:59] time. Don't be scared and sit on your
[44:02] corners and moan and cry like someone
[44:05] have no hope. Amen. Just be rejoice. Ah,
[44:09] God is on the throne. He's coming once
[44:12] more. He's riding a train once more
[44:16] through his bride. It's a bright time
[44:19] now. It's a bride of Christ time now.
[44:22] Amen. It's we that God is requiring.
[44:25] It's we that are God are using. We are
[44:28] his hands. We are his everything. If
[44:31] thou can believe, all things are
[44:34] possible. Amen. He conquered hell, death
[44:37] and grave. Every sickness under our
[44:40] feet. He said by his stripes we were
[44:42] healed. Accept your healing. Don't let
[44:45] the devil test anything. You accept your
[44:48] healing. Sometime might not happen right
[44:50] away, but it will come to pass. Just
[44:53] keep on believing. Just keep on
[44:55] believing. No matter how much you pay,
[44:58] don't doubt it. Believe God will bring
[45:00] it to pass. One day it will come to
[45:03] pass. Keep on believing. The moment you
[45:06] doubt, the enemy has got you. But why
[45:08] you keep on believing, it will come to
[45:11] pass, not hope. Hope is just something
[45:14] hoping you have something to tell. But
[45:16] faith is more than hope.
[45:19] Somewhere in the in the in the message
[45:20] of Bri, one brother was having a hope
[45:23] instead of faith. Bes hope you think
[45:25] it's going to happen. Hope look at
[45:28] circumstances. It can go all too far.
[45:31] But faith goes beyond hope. It faith it
[45:35] settle in your heart and you know it to
[45:38] happen. Yes. No matter what the
[45:41] circumstances,
[45:43] how blue, how bleak it is, faith goes
[45:46] beyond it. and trust God's word. That's
[45:51] what faith is. And it's a revelation.
[45:54] And you can never please God without it.
[45:57] Because all those who have the truth
[46:00] faith, they have the seed of God in
[46:03] them. Those without that seed cannot
[46:07] have the genuine faith. It will be hope
[46:11] and hoping for. They hoping this will
[46:14] happen. They hoping that will happen.
[46:17] But faith it get you settled because you
[46:21] know it's not you doing it. It's Christ
[46:24] in you. He's the hope of your glory. Oh
[46:28] our God is good. He's the same
[46:31] yesterday, today, and forever.
[46:33] The word of God always separate us.
[46:37] Amen.
[46:38] Hallelujah.
[46:42] This word of God, it cause for total
[46:46] separation from every
[46:48] unbelief. Because remember, if you are a
[46:52] true seed of
[46:54] God, you are a royal seed of
[46:57] Abraham because it's
[47:00] not the bonesman son, Ishmamail.
[47:06] Even it's
[47:07] not the flesh that he has Isaac but the
[47:12] Bible said the seed of Abraham he didn't
[47:15] say seed seed and that seed of Abraham
[47:19] is a royal seed of Abraham and you and I
[47:22] that royal seed of Abraham and whatever
[47:25] God was requiring from Abraham if we are
[47:28] a royal seed of Abraham God requires the
[47:31] same thing from you
[47:34] when God called Abraham
[47:36] He called him
[47:37] alone. But as human being, he grabbed
[47:41] his
[47:42] dad. He took his nephew with him. God
[47:46] didn't call Lot. He didn't call. He
[47:49] called Abraham. He said, "Walk before me
[47:52] and I will take you to your land." But
[47:55] he brought those with him. And
[48:00] until God separates all dead people from
[48:04] him, Abraham cannot get his blessings.
[48:08] So it is
[48:09] tonight. Unless you fully separate from
[48:14] unbelief, separate from anything
[48:16] contrary to the word of God, you cannot
[48:19] get your blessings. That is the only
[48:22] thing that can hinder that
[48:25] blessings because the word of God calls
[48:28] for total separation from total
[48:31] unbelief.
[48:33] That's why Moses said oh sorry David
[48:37] said Lord deliver me from what
[48:40] presumptuous sins. Sometimes maybe
[48:43] certain things happen you thought maybe
[48:46] you have got rid of it. Maybe it might
[48:48] be still hiding there. You got to go
[48:50] down this route and cast out everything.
[48:55] Don't let anything hang hang around you.
[48:58] Um unforgiven
[49:01] spirit or
[49:03] anything that people has done you take
[49:07] from your heart, your mind. Don't think
[49:09] all those things. Don't give them an
[49:11] opportunity have any baggage on you.
[49:14] just be free and let God have permanence
[49:18] and p you from every sin in the um
[49:22] greatest battle ever fought. He said
[49:24] that if a man could get his
[49:26] conscious conscience um senses,
[49:30] imagination, everything purged and place
[49:33] the word of God in there. No devil can
[49:36] battle against that.
[49:39] The problem is some of us don't go
[49:41] through the
[49:43] root. Get rid of anyone like
[49:46] Christ so that he can bless you the way
[49:50] he wants to bless you. And when
[49:53] Abraham his dad died and when his
[49:58] servants and Lord's servants were
[50:00] fighting he said that if you go to the
[50:03] left I take the right. You take the
[50:05] right I took the left. And you see
[50:09] yesterday I was talking to my sister in
[50:11] German. I was telling her
[50:14] cutting I just I was just telling just
[50:17] to come back what I'm trying to
[50:19] say. Lot saw the green part. It looks so
[50:24] green in
[50:26] Sodom. So he chose the fertile part and
[50:30] Abraham chose the what? The place that
[50:34] look like nothing is there. So I was
[50:37] just telling my sister that um my
[50:40] niece is done her masters everything but
[50:44] when it comes to
[50:45] marriage she doesn't need to get someone
[50:48] who has finished school like her. let
[50:50] God
[50:52] chose. She can even be married to
[50:54] someone who doesn't have an
[50:56] education, but that might be one who
[50:59] loved her. And a person might not even
[51:02] have money today, but tomorrow you can
[51:05] have more money. So when you making the
[51:08] choices, it doesn't have to be on a
[51:11] fertile ground. Just go by God's
[51:14] choosing. And Abraham gave the best in
[51:19] the natural high to Lot. But after that
[51:22] the God said that you have made the
[51:24] right choice in blessings. I'll bless
[51:27] you in multiply you. Look at the stars.
[51:31] You cannot even count. Why? He let God
[51:34] make a choice for him. And God was
[51:37] pleased with the choice. So it's you and
[51:41] me. Let's make our choices based on the
[51:45] word of God, not by the eye. Because the
[51:48] eye is always deceiving.
[51:51] Look from the heart and let God make the
[51:55] choice for you because his choice is the
[51:59] best choice.
[52:02] Let him choose for us like he did for
[52:05] Abraham.
[52:07] Sometimes it seems that people are full
[52:10] are trying to what um take advantage of
[52:13] you. Don't worry, everything will work
[52:17] out good. He's the same yesterday,
[52:20] today, and forever.
[52:22] So, and unless when Abraham was totally
[52:25] separated, then God was bless blessing.
[52:29] So is you and me being a royal seed of
[52:33] Abraham. Unless we separate from
[52:37] unbelief totally, there is going to be
[52:40] always a hindrance. We cannot like flow
[52:43] through the way God to wants to
[52:46] flow. Amen. So
[52:49] let's get everything aside
[52:52] so God can use us both spiritually and
[52:56] naturally.
[52:59] Because
[53:00] remember it can one thing he did it
[53:04] affected the whole cup. You might think
[53:07] that oh it's just me. No you are part of
[53:12] a
[53:12] body. When one is sick we all get it
[53:16] affected.
[53:18] So if you go and take any box somewhere,
[53:21] you taking that box, you come to reflect
[53:23] the the church and the the the sons of
[53:26] God here. So let's watch our
[53:30] lives and be sure that we're not
[53:33] bringing any reproach to the gospel
[53:38] because your life is what
[53:44] um it's like a reading block. Once you
[53:49] claim this gospel, people are watching
[53:52] your life every day.
[53:55] You are billboard for Christ.
[53:59] Yes. Yesterday I was just
[54:01] thinking
[54:03] just coming and say, "Oh
[54:06] God, help me coming here to stand before
[54:10] your
[54:11] children. I don't want anything to
[54:14] distract my mind. Help
[54:17] me to
[54:19] come and preach like my last sermon
[54:23] because I don't know what's going to
[54:24] happen tomorrow.
[54:26] Will God be happy with me after I left?
[54:29] If I is my last sermon, what did I
[54:33] bring? How did I brought to please God?
[54:37] If the last sermon you going to hear
[54:39] tonight, is God going to please with you
[54:41] when you leave here? If anything
[54:44] happens, if it's your last sermon, you
[54:46] prepare her to come. So, let's approach
[54:50] every service very sincerely.
[54:54] That's our as if it's our last sermon
[54:56] because nobody knows tomorrow. People
[54:59] are dying left and right. It can be your
[55:02] call today or tomorrow. So what I'm
[55:05] trying to say is that let's all
[55:07] consecrate ourselves. Let's all come
[55:09] more prepared so that God can flow the
[55:12] way he wants to flow. I know he's been
[55:15] flowing here. Don't get me wrong. But he
[55:17] want to flow more and more that one day
[55:20] when he come the whole place will be
[55:22] sanctuary be smoking the power of God in
[55:25] the time of Solomon. It was so much that
[55:28] the five priest could not even
[55:31] what
[55:32] minister that's the atmosphere that you
[55:36] want to create. We've seen it. The
[55:37] pillar of fire has been vindicated the
[55:39] church over and over. We've seen the
[55:41] power of God. But that power of God,
[55:44] that revival, only the bride have that
[55:47] revival. It's a bride revival, not the
[55:49] people out there, not for the nomination
[55:52] out there. It's we God is using us. It's
[55:56] we that we having a right revival.
[55:59] And God is more than able to use you and
[56:03] me. It depends on what you will give
[56:06] him. And also it depends when he's ready
[56:08] to use you.
[56:11] So we don't rush on
[56:13] anything. Just let's be ready. So when
[56:16] God wants to use this, we're going to be
[56:18] ready to be use of him. Amen. That's all
[56:21] it is. We are not going for a race. We
[56:24] not like fighting with any why I'm doing
[56:27] this or that. Let's just be simple and
[56:30] live a simple life. And when the time
[56:34] that God wants to use you, he will use
[56:37] you, he'll use me.
[56:39] Amen.
[56:41] Hallelujah. I'm
[56:43] still on that um non seed and the seed
[56:49] of
[56:50] God having left it. There are so many
[56:54] examples. Judas, he listened to all the
[56:58] sermon of the Lord Jesus Christ. It did
[57:00] not do him no good. When it came the
[57:03] time for him to go to receive the Holy
[57:05] Ghost, his color showed. Why? because he
[57:09] has a wrong seed on him. And if you have
[57:12] the wrong seed, you can't go all the way
[57:14] far. You can only go for like a while
[57:18] like a hawk. You can't go like an
[57:21] eagle. It will show end. And Judas also
[57:25] repented like Esau repented. He gave
[57:29] their money back to him to them. But it
[57:31] was too late.
[57:34] And like Paul and Deos, Deas, whatever I
[57:38] said, if I pronounce the wrong the word
[57:41] wrong, forgive me. Paul said, "Why has
[57:44] Deas forsaken me?" For the present tense
[57:49] tense and he couldn't go
[57:52] far, but Paul so many people when it was
[57:56] time for crying of his ministry, so many
[58:00] people left him. So is the prophet of
[58:02] God. When the seas were revealed when
[58:06] the best thing came all people left him.
[58:11] The Lord Jesus Christ the same thing.
[58:14] They were 5 700 500. He said except eat
[58:19] of my flesh drink of my blood you have
[58:21] no part in me. They left. It was left
[58:25] 70. And after the
[58:27] 70 he said the son of
[58:31] man who is
[58:33] here still in heaven they say how can it
[58:37] be you are Joseph's son how can you be
[58:39] here be in heaven and they walk with him
[58:41] no more so is the bride of Christ we are
[58:46] sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[58:49] Jesus
[58:50] he said your soul changed didn't it
[58:54] your bodies Yes, we are in the Licia the
[58:58] seven church age but our spirit has been
[59:01] transported to the eighth day. We can
[59:04] say that we are say here still what in
[59:07] heaven some part of us has caused the
[59:10] eternal church age. Amen. We are present
[59:13] standing here but some part of was in
[59:16] heaven is the same thing the same God.
[59:21] When you say that people say, "Oh, you
[59:23] Phillip here in heaven at the same
[59:25] time." Yes, I'm sitting heavenly places
[59:28] in Christ Jesus. Amen. Hallelujah.
[59:33] Praise God. The the bride can say the
[59:35] same thing. Yes. Because the same
[59:39] God. Hallelujah. So, we are no more lock
[59:42] up in the seven church age anymore. He's
[59:45] the same yesterday, today, forever. He's
[59:49] an awesome God. Ah, God is so good
[59:53] because eagles cannot eat dead
[59:56] food. Amen. Hallelujah. They only eat on
[1:00:01] what? The fresh food of
[1:00:04] God. Our God is good.
[1:00:07] Praise
[1:00:09] God. Hallelujah.
[1:00:12] I'm
[1:00:13] just
[1:00:15] um going to read this
[1:00:23] here. Yeah. I said, "Okay, that's fine."
[1:00:27] So, neither will a Christian eat on that
[1:00:29] dead car from old denominational
[1:00:32] doctrines and things. They want the word
[1:00:35] of God
[1:00:36] fresh. The promise of the hour. God
[1:00:40] promised rabbis in the days of
[1:00:43] Luther. He promised other things in the
[1:00:46] days of others. But now he promises a
[1:00:51] full square meal. The full seven course
[1:00:56] meal for all the services are open and
[1:01:01] everything is ready for the word of God
[1:01:05] to those who can what? Receive.
[1:01:09] Amen.
[1:01:11] Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:01:14] And you what you know what the
[1:01:17] quickening
[1:01:18] power the
[1:01:20] apostles when they receive that quick
[1:01:23] for what did it do to them? They
[1:01:25] quickened them on the day of Pentecost.
[1:01:27] They were so much quicker in the power
[1:01:29] of God by next month that their tongue
[1:01:31] their language even changed. And that
[1:01:34] same God is here. And seven was also
[1:01:38] full of the quickening power that he the
[1:01:41] his eyes everything constant change what
[1:01:44] like light and that same quickening
[1:01:47] power one time Philillip in the Bible as
[1:01:51] he had a revival from one revival it was
[1:01:54] having a
[1:01:56] massive revival over there demons being
[1:01:59] cast out dead being raised all that and
[1:02:02] the and the and the and the power of God
[1:02:05] picking map to go and meet that what
[1:02:08] Ethiopia you know the Bible say he was
[1:02:10] transported
[1:02:12] he was quaking
[1:02:15] oh man and that same quaking power was
[1:02:18] so much in Elisha that even when he died
[1:02:23] he was full of God that quicking power
[1:02:26] so much on him brother sister that when
[1:02:29] they thread dead person on him that
[1:02:32] person right away come back to life amen
[1:02:35] so is you and me. Let's allow that
[1:02:38] picking power is in
[1:02:40] us. The same way that
[1:02:45] power walk with God, he was and he was
[1:02:48] not. That quickening power pick him
[1:02:51] up and took him the presence of God. He
[1:02:54] did not die. Amen. One of these
[1:02:58] days, soon and very soon, we shall go to
[1:03:03] be the king.
[1:03:04] We shall all not asleep
[1:03:08] one day. This motor will put on
[1:03:10] immortality and we're going to meet the
[1:03:12] Lord in the air with a twinkle of an
[1:03:14] eye. That quickening power be so much in
[1:03:18] this month. That within a twinkle of an
[1:03:20] eye, you're going to be in the presence
[1:03:22] of God. That rapture is a process
[1:03:24] leading to an event.
[1:03:27] Soon and very soon, you're going to meet
[1:03:28] a king.
[1:03:30] Amen. We're not going to be here
[1:03:32] anymore. all the suffering, all the
[1:03:34] cheat and all the things that we are
[1:03:36] going through, the people in the world
[1:03:38] and everything. One day it all going to
[1:03:41] come to an end and we're going to be in
[1:03:43] his presence and live there forever. We
[1:03:47] are the most blessed people of the s of
[1:03:50] this earth. We are blessed beyond
[1:03:55] blessing because the seed of God is in
[1:03:59] you and in me. Amen. Some of
[1:04:03] us have been under this ministry. Some
[1:04:07] 30 years, 40 years, 50 years. What do
[1:04:10] you think has kept you all these years?
[1:04:13] When a lot of people since you came,
[1:04:15] this one fell right, this one fell left,
[1:04:17] this one fell, this one fed that. They
[1:04:20] cannot go all the way. But God has kept
[1:04:22] you all this time. You have to be
[1:04:25] thankful. You have to know that there's
[1:04:28] something in you that is keeping you the
[1:04:31] seed of God. It's not the wrong is the
[1:04:34] true seed that has kept you all this
[1:04:36] far. Something keeps on holding me.
[1:04:40] It's the Holy Ghost. It's God himself
[1:04:44] that has kept us all this far. So we
[1:04:48] should be the most happiest people on
[1:04:49] the face of this earth. Amen. Because
[1:04:52] the seed of God in us, we can be reborn.
[1:04:57] And the Nancy, there's nothing to
[1:05:00] quicken them. Oh my. They just hang
[1:05:03] around for a little bit. They find a
[1:05:06] little fault, they pick up the bag, they
[1:05:08] gone. A little fault here. They Sometime
[1:05:10] God even can use a brother, even the
[1:05:12] pastor to try you to see your reaction.
[1:05:18] Amen.
[1:05:20] And sometimes it might not even be the
[1:05:23] wrong thing you have done. Just like
[1:05:26] Job, you are so perfect behind in the
[1:05:29] eyes of God that the devil said, "Oh,
[1:05:32] you have put a hedge around him. That's
[1:05:34] why he cannot do anything. You just let
[1:05:37] me take that hedge, let him try him and
[1:05:40] see if you're not going to curse you."
[1:05:42] God have confidence in Job. He said that
[1:05:45] don't take his life. go and do whatever
[1:05:47] you want to do to
[1:05:49] him. And I believe that what Job has got
[1:05:53] went through none of
[1:05:55] us has gone through half of that. He
[1:05:58] lost his family, he's lost his children,
[1:06:01] everything boys. And I believe that he
[1:06:04] was even thinking the wife and the wife
[1:06:06] said, "Why don't you curse God and
[1:06:08] died?" He said, "Thou speaks like a
[1:06:10] foolish woman. The Lord giveth, the Lord
[1:06:12] taketh, blessed be the name of the
[1:06:14] Lord." And because he was so faithful to
[1:06:18] the Lord Jesus Christ, that quickening
[1:06:20] power quickened him and show him. He
[1:06:23] said that, "Oh, I know my redeemer
[1:06:25] liveth in my flesh. I'll see the Lord."
[1:06:28] Amen. God quicken him to see the rapture
[1:06:31] and everything. That same God is here to
[1:06:34] quicken us to
[1:06:37] himself. Amen. So no matter what you go
[1:06:40] through, believe that God is on your
[1:06:43] side. Amen. He will never leave you nor
[1:06:46] forsake you. Amen. Hallelujah. The
[1:06:51] scripture said, he
[1:06:53] said, I will
[1:06:56] not leave
[1:06:58] my holy one in hell, neither will I
[1:07:02] suffer him to see
[1:07:05] corruption. Okay. Right. He said, but
[1:07:08] who is
[1:07:09] holy? There's no one holy. So when he
[1:07:12] said the holy one, it means God himself
[1:07:16] came to die to save us. He is the only
[1:07:19] holy one. Amen. So I'm going to just
[1:07:22] read this one for you guys for you.
[1:07:24] Sorry that he is the only holy God.
[1:07:28] There was no one when the cry went out.
[1:07:31] There was no one
[1:07:33] worthy to even look or to do
[1:07:37] anything. But the one was the tribe of
[1:07:41] Judah. Only the lamb came and took that
[1:07:43] book. He is the only holy one. There's
[1:07:46] none of us holy because well born is in
[1:07:50] by what? By sex art. But he came through
[1:07:54] the virgin birth. So he is the one that
[1:07:56] is the holy one. So I'm just going to
[1:07:58] add this to it. Then I'm going to wrap
[1:08:00] up. And so it is today. We don't try to
[1:08:05] be some big person. It is the rising of
[1:08:09] the
[1:08:09] sun. We don't care what people say about
[1:08:13] us. Our name aren't nothing. It's his
[1:08:18] name. Our life is nothing. It's his
[1:08:23] life. It's his power, not our power. And
[1:08:29] there is only one thing that we love to
[1:08:31] do is see him
[1:08:35] glorified. And how can it be when he's
[1:08:39] glorified what in us by his resurrection
[1:08:44] that is in us? We see him represented
[1:08:47] again as he was today. Did you get that?
[1:08:52] See, our desire is not to be glorified.
[1:08:56] Our desire is
[1:08:59] not some big name. See, our desire is
[1:09:04] not to be glorified. Our desire is not
[1:09:06] to boost some church or make more in
[1:09:09] Sunday school or try to bring in hog tie
[1:09:12] pushing offer picnic party or bring
[1:09:15] stars buttons or something else like
[1:09:17] that. That's not our desire. Our desire
[1:09:21] is to see him
[1:09:23] glorified. Glorified what?
[1:09:26] Not with self
[1:09:28] pride but in us our lives to prove he is
[1:09:34] alive and living in us.
[1:09:38] If I can get myself out of the way. So
[1:09:42] when William Abraham not even thought of
[1:09:46] and you not even thought of till we can
[1:09:50] see Jesus glorified tremendous see him
[1:09:55] that is our desire that's the quick
[1:09:59] gives us the quickening power and it
[1:10:01] gives us joy to know that we are with
[1:10:04] him both flesh and bone of bone of him
[1:10:09] being the bride of him and sin his name
[1:10:12] vindicated methods proving next that
[1:10:15] he's now risen from the dead.
[1:10:18] No wonder he said fear
[1:10:21] not for now notice you are redeemed by
[1:10:26] him and now risen with him that's what
[1:10:29] Easter means to the people raising with
[1:10:32] him notice we have his spirit in us he
[1:10:38] the abstract did fully paid no you don't
[1:10:41] say well I hope I make it you don't say
[1:10:45] I hope I make it you see You have
[1:10:49] already made it.
[1:10:52] Not I will make it. I've already made
[1:10:57] it. I never made it. He made it for me.
[1:11:02] See, not me.
[1:11:06] Him. Well, brother Abraham, they say I
[1:11:09] don't care what they say that he made it
[1:11:12] for me. That is all I want. I'm caring
[1:11:15] about.
[1:11:17] Just I want to see him manifested. How
[1:11:19] can we do it? Call him down? No, he is
[1:11:24] in you. He is in you. Well then, Lord,
[1:11:29] if I can get myself out of the way, you
[1:11:32] can manifest myself. How can you do it?
[1:11:36] Because you ordained it. So, all that
[1:11:39] the father has given me will come to me.
[1:11:43] So he
[1:11:44] said because I live you shall also live.
[1:11:50] Amen. Because he was what? The
[1:11:53] first wave she chief. And Abraham also
[1:11:57] demonstrate that to us. And that same
[1:12:00] God is in you and in me to do exact same
[1:12:06] thing. Not maybe the high level like
[1:12:09] that but according to what he wants us
[1:12:11] to do. And I believe with all my heart
[1:12:15] that it's the same quickening power. One
[1:12:18] day I was in square one shopping mall
[1:12:23] just on the escalator going walking down
[1:12:27] the escalator.
[1:12:30] Then when the escalator come all the way
[1:12:33] down, I saw a lady sitting down with a
[1:12:37] security around her. And they calling
[1:12:41] the ambulance to come and pick her up
[1:12:44] because she can't walk. I raised her. I
[1:12:47] said, "Do you believe in prayers?" He
[1:12:49] said, she said, "Yes, I believe in
[1:12:50] prayers." Okay. So, there was one
[1:12:52] brother. I didn't know that he was even
[1:12:54] around brac's people. So he came and
[1:12:57] took the lady's uh wallet or purse. He
[1:13:02] doesn't know the lady anywhere. We bowed
[1:13:05] down our head. We prayed in the public
[1:13:08] and within a minute by the time the
[1:13:10] ambulance came just jump and he was gone
[1:13:12] in her car. What that the same
[1:13:14] quickening power is using you and me in
[1:13:17] a small way. He's the same yesterday,
[1:13:20] today and forever because we are the
[1:13:23] evidence of his resurrection. Yes, we
[1:13:25] are the one that people are looking for.
[1:13:28] They looking to when they come to you
[1:13:30] with their problems. It's not you they
[1:13:33] coming to they approaching that God in
[1:13:36] you. That's why people bringing their
[1:13:39] prayer request to the prayer meeting
[1:13:41] because they have seen God in you.
[1:13:44] Uncautiously they are contacting the
[1:13:47] Lord Jesus Christ in you. He said that
[1:13:49] because I live you shall also live.
[1:13:52] said, "The works that I do shall you
[1:13:55] also do."
[1:13:57] Amen. He's the same yesterday to today
[1:14:00] forever. He love us and we are
[1:14:04] privileged that we can say that we are
[1:14:07] born again because we have the right
[1:14:11] seed in us. And somewhere said that even
[1:14:14] if your heart condemns you, God is
[1:14:17] greater than your heart. Amen. So I
[1:14:20] leave this with you tonight. Let nothing
[1:14:23] condemns you because he that believe in
[1:14:27] God has passed from death unto life. You
[1:14:31] shall not come unto condemnation. The
[1:14:33] word of God is judging you now. So you
[1:14:36] are not coming to any judgment. You are
[1:14:39] passed from death unto life. His spirit
[1:14:43] is the same spirit that raised up Christ
[1:14:46] from dead. If it dwells in you, it will
[1:14:49] also what? Quicken your mortal body one
[1:14:52] of these days. So let's keep on pressing
[1:14:56] on. Let's keep on pressing and pressing
[1:15:00] and pressing. One day we're going to see
[1:15:04] the one that we are we are talking
[1:15:08] about. It becomes so
[1:15:10] personalized and real to us that we
[1:15:14] can't have anywhere. You don't even know
[1:15:16] how to express it. He is God. He has
[1:15:20] risen from the dead. He's God. Every
[1:15:23] knee shall bow. Every tongue shall
[1:15:26] confess that Jesus Christ is God. Amen.
[1:15:30] He has never changed. He's the same
[1:15:33] yesterday, today, and forever. Let's
[1:15:36] pray.
[1:15:38] Oh heavenly most gracious eta god and
[1:15:42] I've
[1:15:43] just bring what is you place in my heart
[1:15:48] give me the scripture that a seed of god
[1:15:52] can never sin because your seed dwelleth
[1:15:57] in
[1:15:58] him and I've brought it
[1:16:01] away you gave me lord if I said anything
[1:16:04] or anything contrary ask forgiveness I
[1:16:07] pray that it will reach its intended
[1:16:09] purpose and encourage your children and
[1:16:12] bless them. Oh God, may the may the sick
[1:16:17] be made whole. May those who need money
[1:16:20] get jobs. Those who don't have a job get
[1:16:22] job. Father, oh God, answer their pray,
[1:16:27] provide their needs.
[1:16:29] May your spirit take full control Lord
[1:16:31] as you quicken the word of God because
[1:16:34] the letter kill it but the spirit giveth
[1:16:36] life. May that spirit quicken the word
[1:16:39] every day revelation upon revelation and
[1:16:42] bless your children has never been
[1:16:43] before. We thank you for hearing us. We
[1:16:47] thank you for your blessing. We thank
[1:16:49] you for revealing yourself to us. We
[1:16:51] thank you for the Holy Ghost. We thank
[1:16:53] you father for your love and mercy. We
[1:16:55] thank you. We cannot even thank you
[1:16:57] enough. We appreciate you from the
[1:17:00] bottom of our hearts. We love you Lord
[1:17:03] Jesus for your grace and your mercy in
[1:17:06] our lives. Thank you Lord. We give you
[1:17:09] all the glory and the honor in Jesus
[1:17:12] name. Amen.
[1:17:14] [Music]
[1:17:16] Hallelujah.
