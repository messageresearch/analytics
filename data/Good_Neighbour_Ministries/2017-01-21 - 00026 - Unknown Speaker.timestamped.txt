[0:00] more often ones who have had a bad
[0:01] relationship with their
[0:03] fathers why is that because they've lost
[0:06] acceptance here they're looking for
[0:08] somewhere else you're looking for
[0:09] another father
[0:12] right another way to speak about that is
[0:15] is remember a preacher one time talking
[0:17] about a dog he beat a dog and eventually
[0:21] what does he do he's always expecting to
[0:22] be beaten right if he doesn't see
[0:25] acceptance he's he's he's always going
[0:28] to C away from you he's always going to
[0:29] run away from you so when when I came to
[0:32] my years of Crisis and my years of
[0:34] Trials as a teenager I couldn't go to my
[0:37] dad I couldn't go to my
[0:39] parents I think I mean I I'm not saying
[0:43] that I'm any different I'm saying it
[0:44] because I think I'm like a lot of other
[0:46] people um so where do you go you go to
[0:49] the world you go to your friends you go
[0:51] to places you can find
[0:53] acceptance and the acceptance you get
[0:55] out
[0:56] there isn't isn't going in a good
[0:59] direction
[1:01] um the people you meet out there a lot
[1:03] of them when people struggle with the
[1:05] need for acceptance at home
[1:11] um you look for other people who are
[1:13] broken like you who don't have
[1:15] acceptance other people who don't have
[1:17] proper attachment and those people are
[1:19] doing all the things that you should all
[1:21] the stuff that you shouldn't be
[1:24] doing and they accept you because you're
[1:26] broken like they are but two broken
[1:28] people don't make a good good
[1:31] relationship and so you get LED astray
[1:33] you do a lot of wrong
[1:36] things I struggled from from a very
[1:38] early age I struggled with uh with
[1:42] depression I was bullied very early in
[1:44] school in fact it was kind of funny from
[1:47] I think I can remember being bullied
[1:48] from grade
[1:49] one
[1:51] um and for some reason I I don't know if
[1:55] it was I don't know what did it but I
[1:56] sort of thought it was a trial of my
[1:57] faith at that time thought you people
[2:00] don't like me because I'm a
[2:02] Believer um I don't think that's a very
[2:05] good a very healthy mindset but
[2:09] um as As I Grew Older that sort of
[2:12] stayed with me but none of the good
[2:13] stuff stayed with me so I I strove for
[2:17] acceptance from my friends and I got
[2:20] into all the bad habits that my friends
[2:22] got into I smoked I drank I tried
[2:24] different sorts of
[2:25] drugs um and none of that was bad stuff
[2:29] actually I got
[2:30] when I when
[2:33] I um both in my later teens when I tried
[2:37] to seek
[2:38] God and even other times in my life to
[2:41] give up the smoking the drink all stuff
[2:43] that wasn't that
[2:45] Hur the thing that got
[2:47] me the thing that I'm ashamed of the
[2:50] thing that's worse in my life is is
[2:54] sex um it started and like I'm not alone
[2:58] in this the the the very first the very
[3:02] first time Zan wanted to get us what did
[3:04] he do in the garden of Ed it was sex
[3:07] what he do with Samson it was sex with
[3:09] David it was sex with Solomon it was
[3:12] sex we and we live in a generation in a
[3:15] time that is full of it we live in a
[3:17] generation where where women are
[3:20] worshiped as not not as women but as sex
[3:24] objects we live in a time where where
[3:27] every teenager is bombarded day in and
[3:31] day out it's worse today than when I was
[3:32] a teenager much worse but bombarded by
[3:36] these things but I discovered
[3:37] pornography when I was I don't know I
[3:39] was pretty
[3:41] young I don't think I was a teenager yet
[3:44] um but I had friends that their parents
[3:47] had the stuff around and and I became I
[3:51] became
[3:52] addicted um and by saying is addicted
[3:55] I'm not trying to downplay I'm not
[3:56] trying to pretend that it's just a
[3:57] sickness it's a demon it's it's a lot of
[3:59] I know but what I mean by that is
[4:03] addiction the way addiction Works in a
[4:06] person a person can be addicted to Li
[4:07] person can be addicted to stealing
[4:09] person can be addicted to many things
[4:12] there's there are neural Pathways in a
[4:14] person's brain that when you're a very
[4:16] small
[4:17] child um there are certain chemicals
[4:19] that are released and certain things
[4:21] that are release when a child is
[4:22] accepted by their parents are accepted
[4:24] by their CBL but a need for acceptance
[4:28] and the same Pathways or the same ones
[4:30] that fire when a person is acting out an
[4:36] addiction usually when a person is
[4:38] addicted they're seeking for some sort
[4:40] of acceptance that's what causes it and
[4:42] sexual addiction of course is
[4:44] obviously going down
[4:47] that so I I sat and and there's things
[4:50] there I don't even want to tell um there
[4:52] things I don't want to talk about
[4:53] because I'm I'm so ashamed of them but
[4:57] like like many other young boys I s um I
[5:01] sought acceptance
[5:03] and I felt that there
[5:06] was for some reason that was the thing
[5:09] that that got
[5:10] me and I did things and I became so
[5:13] ashamed
[5:15] because first of all there's a natural
[5:18] acceptance a natural
[5:22] um um a natural need
[5:26] for foret the word I was using sorry
[5:29] natural need for acceptance so that I
[5:31] wasn't been fulfilled but second of
[5:34] all I was raised in a place where we
[5:36] knew about
[5:38] God it was a
[5:40] spiritual acceptance that I wasn't
[5:46] getting the same the same CS Lewis a
[5:50] great writer says that that the the
[5:52] drunk banging on the door of the B house
[5:54] is looking for
[5:57] God a child needing a teenager needing
[6:01] acceptance not just from his parents but
[6:03] needing to know God knowing that there
[6:05] is a God that he needs to
[6:07] know having somehow felt a need seeing
[6:12] him but then unable to reach out find so
[6:15] you feel driven you feel this need to
[6:19] to a need for a love that you just can't
[6:22] find and so I would I would feel because
[6:25] of the shame of the things I did I would
[6:28] been fall into depression and then the
[6:31] way in which I I felt better about the
[6:34] depression is I would turn to the
[6:35] addiction and then I would feel ashamed
[6:37] and I'll fall back into depression so I
[6:39] ended up in this vicious
[6:41] cycle and I went to this Al my teenage
[6:43] years and and and I twice I tried to
[6:45] commit suicide I
[6:48] mean tried how's a person try to commit
[6:51] suicide
[6:52] well you don't either do it or you don't
[6:55] of thing right the attempt is
[6:57] halfhearted if you really were going to
[6:58] do it it'd be done
[7:00] but the point was I seriously wanted to
[7:04] I seriously you know I I I sat for hours
[7:07] with razor blades I I I held a loaded
[7:10] shotgun my hands wanting to put in my
[7:11] mouth and shoot myself I did as a
[7:14] teenager and these sort of spirits
[7:17] um we live in an age when these things
[7:20] are are rampant out there right where
[7:23] where
[7:23] people Jesus says in when he's carrying
[7:26] his cross of Calvary he says don't week
[7:29] for me he says but a time is coming when
[7:33] they will say first of all blessed are
[7:35] the are the the breast of blessed is the
[7:38] wound that has a BN and S Stu he says
[7:40] when they say those things man you cry
[7:42] for the rocks and the hills to fall on
[7:44] them that's a suicidal Spirit we live in
[7:47] that time we live in a time when when
[7:50] people don't want children and suicide
[7:53] is rampant in our world depression is
[7:55] rampant and and your
[7:57] children are at inured for that these
[8:00] are the spirits the spirits that that
[8:03] weren't so much stronger than they were
[8:05] that that are
[8:07] always this is what the devil wants to
[8:09] get them with he wants to make them
[8:10] ashamed as he possibly can of who they
[8:12] are wants to wants to bring that those
[8:15] suicidal spirits on them and and squash
[8:18] them before they become who they're
[8:20] meant to
[8:22] be he
[8:25] knows that you're people of God
[8:30] he knows that you've applied a token he
[8:33] knows that you have
[8:34] children that are meant to do great
[8:36] things for
[8:37] God all those demons he's not after the
[8:41] people that he's already got out there
[8:43] they're all coming after you and they're
[8:45] especially coming after to the Next
[8:47] Generation cuz if you can get them
[8:49] before they get before they goow into
[8:52] what they're supposed to
[8:53] be
[8:56] right so it's it's uh
[9:00] it's on the one hand being being a
[9:02] teenager raised with with the message of
[9:05] God around you is a great blessing on
[9:07] the other hand you're a great
[9:09] Target so it's a great struggle it's a
[9:11] hard place to be at about age um
[9:16] 16 I had gotten so messed up um I don't
[9:22] think my parents knew half of what was
[9:23] going on but at least they know they
[9:25] knew enough that they knew I needed
[9:27] help uh my dad spoken a few times about
[9:30] me about you know he recognized that I
[9:34] was depressed and they known that I got
[9:36] into smoking and drinking and they they
[9:39] had they had thought that maybe i' been
[9:41] into drugs and stuff
[9:43] um they knew a little bit about the
[9:45] pornography and different stuff I've
[9:47] been
[9:47] into so they thought I needed help my
[9:50] sister at that time I recently moved to
[9:53] Cloverdale BC uh where brother Eddie
[9:56] bisol is the pastor of the church there
[10:00] and they had at least they had a vibrant
[10:03] use group and she did she said look send
[10:06] them out here maybe maybe we can we can
[10:10] help so they sent me out and I decided
[10:13] to stay and I stayed there for while I I
[10:16] moved back to Edington for a few few
[10:18] months but I spent most of my time in
[10:21] overdale um when I got there I just I
[10:24] saw this youth group that was everything
[10:26] that I wanted to be when I was a kid I
[10:29] saw people like um John Andy who's a
[10:32] minister there I was just he's only a
[10:34] couple years older than me so he was
[10:35] about 18 at the time um all Matthew I
[10:39] can't remember his last name just but
[10:41] they were people at that time young
[10:43] people and then all just the youth group
[10:45] in general just people that actually
[10:48] believed right I grew up with youth that
[10:51] just mocked the ministry really mocked
[10:54] their parents now I saw people that
[10:57] really believed
[11:00] or at least they really look like they
[11:01] people wow this is what I want to be
[11:03] this is what I want to be when I was a
[11:05] kid I thought here's a
[11:07] chance and so I put aside a lot of those
[11:10] bad habits and stuff that I had
[11:12] developed um and I felt accepted that
[11:15] was the big thing too it's just there
[11:17] there were
[11:18] people people that that should have been
[11:20] struggling the same stuff I was but they
[11:22] had Victory and on top of that they were
[11:24] accepting
[11:25] them even though I was I was so sick of
[11:29] myself myself and told myself these
[11:31] people really cared about me and so I I
[11:34] I I put aside my bad habits as best I
[11:36] could um like I said traffic smoking
[11:39] drinking it's not that I didn't struggle
[11:41] with it of course especially the the
[11:43] cigarettes those are those things that's
[11:46] a pretty Hur Addiction in itself but but
[11:49] I was able to put those things aside
[11:50] with some
[11:53] struggles um and I spent about I was
[11:56] there for about 6
[11:58] months and and I was seeking God and I
[12:01] remember one
[12:02] night I I I talked to my sister and she
[12:05] told me about her experience how she had
[12:07] found God and how she felt in in a
[12:10] meeting that God was speaking directly
[12:11] to her I never felt that and and I just
[12:16] I had this feel sense I wanted what they
[12:19] had and so I started seeking God and
[12:21] this one night this the the the message
[12:24] that I don't know what was preached but
[12:26] it spoke to me and I just felt this real
[12:29] need um to to just pray and and see and
[12:33] I stayed there for everybody left the
[12:35] sanctuary I was there for it must have
[12:37] been an hour and I was just there and I
[12:40] didn't even know what to pray I just I
[12:41] knew I needed God finally my sister came
[12:45] and said well do you want me to get a
[12:46] minister she brother Tom Ray um I don't
[12:50] know I'm very familiar with the
[12:51] ministers in but brother Tom ready to
[12:54] come in and pray with me and brother
[12:57] Peter was Aon at the time I can't
[13:00] remember his last name um but anyway
[13:03] they came they sat they prayed with me
[13:05] and after they prayed with me but the
[13:08] time said me he said you know now when
[13:09] you feel that presence starting to get
[13:11] away from you so going into your closet
[13:13] your little prayer closet praying closer
[13:15] I mean that's great
[13:16] advice and I had felt something I felt a
[13:19] great need but I I I hadn't had a
[13:23] breakthrough I hadn't really felt that I
[13:26] met God in any way
[13:29] but I thought I was supposed to have so
[13:31] I left the the service and somebody
[13:33] asked me what had happened sort of stuff
[13:34] and I gave and I mean this is something
[13:36] probably should be ashamed of more I
[13:38] lied about my conversion I said that
[13:40] things happen that didn't happen I
[13:43] cobbled together testimonies that I he
[13:46] from other people stuff about God's know
[13:48] God's feeling like God was speaking
[13:50] directly to me and these sorts of
[13:53] things and
[13:56] u s
[14:02] and sort of sort of said that you know I
[14:03] met God that was
[14:06] it but it wasn't I had really had
[14:08] anything I knew I needed something but I
[14:10] had really so at the end of about 6
[14:14] months I I I came back home Toth land
[14:17] and I went back I ended up in Evon for
[14:19] about three or four months I had some
[14:20] relatives there my sisters and and one
[14:23] of my brothers lived
[14:25] there so I went there and I I all all to
[14:29] time I sort of stayed in the
[14:30] church and I was trying to act like a
[14:33] Christian I was trying to be reformed to
[14:34] be the kind of person that you're
[14:35] supposed to be and this is the trouble
[14:37] with sometimes being raced as Christian
[14:38] is that you know what you're supposed to
[14:40] do right it's it's not a change because
[14:42] you think you just got to act like
[14:44] everybody else so that's what I was
[14:46] doing and then I I
[14:49] um I had this strange dream one
[14:53] night I knew something was wrong I knew
[14:55] there was something I needed what I do I
[14:57] need to knew what I needed I knew I
[14:58] needed deliver I knew I was still a
[14:59] sinner I knew those demons were still on
[15:02] me especially that last
[15:04] demon and I had this dream in this dream
[15:06] it was at the same time at the Gulf War
[15:08] and in this dream I was uh I was in a
[15:11] building I was on the first floor and I
[15:14] knew I needed to get to the fourth
[15:16] floor but every time I get in the
[15:18] elevator I end up on the seventh floor
[15:20] and I knew I wasn't supposed to be there
[15:22] and I tried to get back to the fourth
[15:24] floor and I end up on the first floor
[15:26] and the first floor at this s wasin and
[15:31] the seventh floor at a sister it was the
[15:34] wife of a pastor from the
[15:37] church
[15:39] um it was not not brother Herold was
[15:42] brother's church but it was under
[15:45] another Pastor sister Pastor was there
[15:47] at the time and and
[15:49] so I couldn't understand every time I
[15:52] went in up down where s hin was he tried
[15:55] to jump on me and when he jumped on me I
[15:57] feel like I couldn't breathe
[15:59] and I knew what that was I knew that had
[16:01] to do with I was still craving
[16:02] cigarettes I know what that was about
[16:04] and it's weird you get these dreams I
[16:06] mean I have all kinds of dreams I dream
[16:08] every night I know the most of it's
[16:09] garbage but then you get dreams and they
[16:11] mean something so much you know what I'm
[16:13] talking about and I knew this dream at
[16:15] so I told uh Brother Martin War my
[16:17] brother my was he's been in for years
[16:20] years years I told him about this dream
[16:21] and he B interpreted for me so well
[16:24] seventh floor and the sisters we for
[16:26] pastor seven means perfection
[16:30] four means Deliverance he said you're
[16:32] trying to get somewhere you're trying to
[16:33] be somebody you're trying to be perfect
[16:35] but you're not going to the steps you're
[16:37] not getting
[16:39] delivered and that made perfect sense
[16:41] but I wasn't ready to accept it it
[16:43] wasn't long after that I uh I ended up
[16:47] in some trouble I I I was traveling with
[16:49] some believer summer and I just did some
[16:51] really stupid stuff I'm not even going
[16:53] to explain what I did but I'm just
[16:56] saying it had to do with with my old
[17:00] demon had to do with sex and I was so
[17:03] ashamed and um and I I I tried again I
[17:07] tried to commit suicide it was one of my
[17:10] my
[17:11] uh my
[17:13] most when I like like my real attempts I
[17:16] went and I got a bunch of um
[17:22] I I I got a about I I came back I gotten
[17:27] into more pornography and stuff I got I
[17:28] got into smok and then this thing
[17:31] happened so I got this bottle of of a
[17:34] big bottle of extra straight T off I
[17:36] took the whole
[17:37] thing uh I went to the store bought
[17:40] another bottle I took all a bit and I
[17:42] went to sleep
[17:44] for I think it was 16 18 hours something
[17:48] and I woke up and I had a no s
[17:52] it I thought I was done I mean you you
[17:56] can't actually commit suicide that way
[17:59] but I thought I seriously thought I was
[18:01] committing suicide I thought I was
[18:03] done um and then I just realized I
[18:06] chained myself and I hated myself I need
[18:08] to get out of there I left I went back
[18:10] to
[18:12] Cloverdale um and there among my friends
[18:15] that I trusted that I
[18:18] gotten that that I had been been trying
[18:20] to fit in with before that that uh that
[18:23] have these great testimonies and stuff I
[18:25] turned back to to being that sort of
[18:28] reformed Christian just you know trying
[18:30] to get by with reform and believing I
[18:32] was okay but not really believing
[18:34] knowing I wasn't okay knowing I needed
[18:36] something and one thing that kept
[18:38] sticking out to me sorry am I am I good
[18:41] for okay let me know when I get close so
[18:43] I can jump to the
[18:45] end oh am
[18:46] [Music]
[18:48] I
[18:50] wow well I got to tell you this one so I
[18:53] was seeking God I knew I needed to be
[18:54] re-baptized this was something that got
[18:56] coming to me um
[18:59] and i i i i u i was seeking God one
[19:03] night and I was praying in front of the
[19:05] fireplace we had this big sing song and
[19:06] I was praying and I sat back in my chair
[19:10] and I was just worshiping God and I knew
[19:12] I was looking for something and I sat
[19:13] back in my chair and I felt like I was
[19:14] going up through this darkness and then
[19:18] I was standing in front of a curtain a
[19:20] big black curtain and I knew I wanted to
[19:21] go beyond this curtain and I was there
[19:24] for about a minute all a sudden I was
[19:25] beyond it and I saw Jesus Christ
[19:29] standing with his hands both hands like
[19:31] this and his face was so I knew it was
[19:33] Christ but his face was so bright I
[19:35] couldn't see what what I couldn't see
[19:38] his expression or any of that I just
[19:40] live was Christ I know he was saying
[19:42] you're
[19:44] accepted and I went and then sudden El
[19:46] back beyond that G again and that was an
[19:49] incredible experience and I felt so
[19:53] alive and I went out with some brothers
[19:54] that day and I testified about it and I
[19:56] was so happy and everything was so great
[20:01] and
[20:02] still I failed after
[20:05] that I knew there were things that I
[20:07] needed to do and one thing I knew I
[20:09] needed to do is I needed to know I
[20:10] needed to really repent I needed to get
[20:12] rid of those demons I needed to be
[20:13] delivered and I needed to be re baptized
[20:16] because when I got baptized I didn't
[20:17] know what I was doing I didn't know what
[20:19] it meant to confess the scripture says
[20:23] confess repent to be baptized I didn't
[20:25] know what it meant to repent
[20:29] but I couldn't do it because of Pride um
[20:32] because of
[20:33] Shame and I just I I just
[20:36] didn't and I fell away for 20
[20:39] years I struggled and the reason I'm
[20:42] saying that the reason point that is
[20:44] because there's one thing if God is
[20:45] telling you to do
[20:47] something do
[20:49] it I I fell away in the worst possible
[20:52] way I went into some of the worst
[20:54] possible sin after that I messed up
[20:57] relationships in my life I messed up of
[20:58] everything I could think of I got so
[21:00] deep
[21:02] into devian and and and just everything
[21:06] that I shouldn't have been
[21:08] doing all because I couldn't make a
[21:11] commitment here was Christ standing
[21:13] saying you're accepted but I couldn't
[21:15] just make a commitment and give a public
[21:17] testimony to say by repentance and
[21:20] baptism that I
[21:22] accept Christ and because of that I
[21:26] ended up for 20 years wanding before I
[21:28] got back here and some of you saw me get
[21:31] baptized here in the tank that was my
[21:34] step back there's a lot more that I wish

[36:23] course the preeminence the word and and
[36:27] so here we are um tonight by the grace
[36:30] of God and I I'm hoping I'm trusting God
[36:33] because I was praying there that as he
[36:36] gives that testimony the holy spirit
[36:38] will place it right where it needs to go
[36:41] in somebody's heart that will bring a a
[36:45] transformation and a change completely
[36:48] in their lives amen praise the lord well
[36:52] uh first of all let's remember all of
[36:54] those uh that have uh Gone foreign

[37:29] them all that God will bring them back

[37:42] to be covered by the blood in this mad
[37:45] and terrible time that we are living in
[37:48] all kinds of things are flying around
[37:51] and only the grace of God will see you
[37:53] through so let's trust him and believe
[37:56] him and give him honor and glory in all
[37:59] things now um what I have to do here is
[38:03] bring a bring a short word of God and
[38:06] then we're going to have the Lord's

[38:13] uh we will have some time to uh be able
[38:16] to search our hearts talk to God Amen
[38:20] and allow God to speak our hearts and I
[38:24] trust that the Lord Jesus will do
[38:25] something for us
[38:29] I'm going to take for a scripture
[38:31] tonight Isaiah
[38:33] 43 18 to
[38:36] [Music]
[38:45] 199 let's stand and read the
[38:55] scripture remember you do not the former
[39:02] things neither consider the things of
[39:07] old
[39:09] behold I will do a new
[39:12] thing now it shall spring forth shall
[39:17] you not know
[39:19] it I will even make a way in the
[39:23] wilderness and rivers in the Des no
[39:27] matter how terrible the
[39:29] world he's going to make a river in the
[39:32] desert and
[39:34] streams streams in the desert and rivers
[39:38] in the wilderness amen so so we're not
[39:41] going to lack anything so don't look at
[39:44] what's going on in the world out there
[39:46] and let that get you overwhelmed or
[39:49] things are going bad that's happening
[39:51] that's happening if we don't care what's
[39:53] happening out there why Jesus is coming
[39:57] a doesn't matter what happens Jesus is
[40:00] coming the whole world is sinking and
[40:02] falling apart Jesus is coming and he
[40:05] said behold I make all things new let us
[40:08] pray our gracious Heavenly Father we
[40:12] thank you tonight for the opportunity of
[40:15] serving you and being called the sons of
[40:19] God born again by your spirit and we
[40:23] pray tonight father that you will speak
[40:26] to us by and through the word that we
[40:29] may enter the new year as better people
[40:33] with the intention of going higher and
[40:36] deeper in every way and to bring glory
[40:39] to your name amen we ask this in Jesus
[40:42] name amen and amen praise the name of
[40:44] the Lord hallelujah
[40:47] amen now um just before I really get
[40:52] into this let me make some of my my own
[40:56] comments at Le I think it's my own
[40:58] comments but I want to encourage you all
[41:01] in this new year to listen to the voice
[41:05] of listen for the voice of the holy
[41:08] spirit cuz God is always
[41:11] talking he always talking to man but
[41:16] most of the times we either don't hear
[41:19] his voice or we don't
[41:22] recognize because God is always talking
[41:25] to us and he speaks in so many
[41:30] ways and because of that uh we we fail
[41:35] to get what God is trying to tell us so
[41:40] I want to encourage you in this new year
[41:42] to listen to the voice of God when he is
[41:46] trying to speak to you now he may speak
[41:49] to you through the word either by your
[41:52] reading your Bible as some of you know
[41:55] that you have something in your mind you
[41:57] go and you open the Bible and there is
[41:59] your answer right there yes nobody could
[42:03] make that up no there is no priest
[42:05] nobody could do that only the holy
[42:08] spirit that was the voice of God
[42:11] speaking to
[42:12] you but the devil will tell you it's by
[42:14] chance oh it's just you know it just
[42:17] happened and dismiss it as if it's not
[42:19] something Supernatural you must
[42:22] recognize when you're hearing the voice
[42:24] of God and when you recognize it
[42:28] and follow what God is saying to you
[42:31] praise the Lord hallelujah amen God will
[42:34] speak through the word while you're
[42:36] reading the Bible he'll speak through
[42:38] the word right off the bit sometimes yes
[42:41] sir amen sometimes the preacher will say
[42:45] exactly what you were asking that's
[42:47] right to the point where you you think
[42:50] somebody came the preacher and somebody
[42:53] did was the Holy Spirit
[42:57] amen but that's how God speaks and we
[43:00] must listen for his voice other words
[43:03] when you come into the service don't
[43:05] just sit there looking around at the
[43:07] ceiling and and watching and this and
[43:10] looking at that listen for the voice of
[43:13] God and hear what God is speaking what
[43:17] are you listening amen God will speak to
[43:21] you also through the spirit of your mind
[43:25] in other words through your thoughts
[43:27] through your Sanctified conscience yeah
[43:30] that's been washed by the blood of
[43:32] Christ every one of us has passed
[43:34] through that where uh you're just like
[43:37] that and you're wondering what should I
[43:39] do I don't know in this situation or or
[43:42] should I go or should I not go should I
[43:43] do this should I do that and a thought
[43:46] we call it will come to you and say why
[43:48] don't you do this and then you push it
[43:50] aside and you go ahead and did whatever
[43:53] you felt you wanted to do and the next
[43:55] thing you know uh when when you you
[43:58] ended up in the wrong end of it you say
[44:00] oh my God I should have listened to my
[44:02] thoughts it wasn't your just your
[44:05] thoughts you should listen to God
[44:07] speaking through your conscience and
[44:09] speaking through you sanctify your mind
[44:13] amen and that's what God wants you to
[44:15] know that's what I I want to encourage
[44:17] you to be a little more sensitive to the
[44:20] Holy
[44:21] Spirit and not just be rushing around
[44:24] and when God is speaking you can't hear
[44:27] you're not getting quiet enough where
[44:29] the Holy Spirit can speak to you and
[44:32] reveal himself to you and tell you what
[44:35] to do so God will speak through your
[44:37] mind God will also speak through
[44:42] circumstances you want to do this and
[44:44] then he'll block you and then you're
[44:46] getting mad that you're getting blocked
[44:49] or or or you obstructed not knowing God
[44:52] is trying to stop you because he has
[44:54] something better is that right he has
[44:57] something better that may look good to
[45:00] you but God knows best one song writer
[45:03] said the Lord will choose for me in be
[45:07] better far I know so let him B me go or
[45:10] stay amen so
[45:13] circumstances sometimes we wake up in
[45:15] the middle of circumstance and realize
[45:17] oh that's the Lord telling me no don't
[45:20] go forward praise the Lord You're just
[45:23] about to sign on the doted line and
[45:26] something in you said
[45:27] and you don't know why and you stop
[45:29] right there but you got to listen for
[45:31] the voice of the holy spirit amen simply
[45:36] God is working through
[45:38] Simplicity God will you got to listen to
[45:41] God's Voice through strangers
[45:45] Yeah because sometimes we think oh we
[45:47] are Christians so God will only speak
[45:49] through our fellow brothers and
[45:50] sisters God can come with one of your
[45:53] sinful relatives my God and speak to
[45:59] they don't care what you think all stuff
[46:02] you just tell you what you feel God use
[46:05] somebody like that tell you right to
[46:07] your face and if you want to fight they
[46:13] ready right amen because and they don't
[46:17] know God is using them but God can speak
[46:21] true uh unsaved a relative of yours but
[46:26] you know recognize it because
[46:29] familiarity brings
[46:31] contempt oh I know him he's my C he
[46:35] being a drinker he being a this he's
[46:37] being a that he's done this and that and
[46:38] all that blinds you from hearing the
[46:41] voice got to Listen for God's voice oh
[46:45] oh that can't be the voice of God
[46:47] because that man is a sinner you know
[46:50] he's not born
[46:51] again well look I I remember witnessing
[46:54] to a young Hindu uh um gentleman um who
[46:58] became later on he got converted became
[47:00] a pastor and I heard just two or three
[47:03] years ago had a big Ministry in the
[47:05] United States and then he passed away
[47:07] but the fact is I was sharing with him
[47:10] what we knew then when the message first
[47:11] came one God his name is Jesus Christ
[47:14] you need to be baptized in the name not
[47:16] father Son and Holy Ghost and and this
[47:18] sort of stuff and then he said because
[47:21] he was going to a Bible to the Bible
[47:23] school I had come out and he was going
[47:26] and said well what about but Jesus was
[47:28] on the cross and and said the father
[47:30] into thy hands I command who was he
[47:32] speaking to
