[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] praise the lord
[0:16] a good sunday morning to you
[0:19] to all of you my dear and precious
[0:22] friends
[0:23] wherever you are and around the world
[0:27] god bless you in a marvelous
[0:30] and in a wonderful way as you have come
[0:34] into god's house on god's
[0:37] day with god's people
[0:41] to receive god's word
[0:45] may he break the bread of life
[0:48] and give you the waters of life
[0:53] to quench your thirst and your hunger
[0:57] for him
[0:58] may the lord bless us all together as we
[1:02] come
[1:02] together as a family of god
[1:06] once more to worship him
[1:09] and to glorify his great and
[1:12] mighty name hallelujah may the lord
[1:16] bless us all on this wonderful day
[1:19] around the world wherever we may be
[1:24] in your bibles shall we
[1:27] turn to luke
[1:30] chapter 17
[1:35] reading from verses
[1:39] 18
[1:43] 28 sorry to 30.
[1:50] and it reads us
[1:53] likewise also
[1:57] as it was in the days of lot
[2:02] they did eat they drank
[2:07] they bought they sold
[2:11] they planted
[2:14] they build it and the
[2:17] same day that the lord went out of sodom
[2:22] it rained fire and brimstone
[2:26] from heaven and destroyed them all
[2:32] even thus shall it be
[2:35] in the day when the son of man
[2:40] is revealed praise god
[2:43] for the wonderful reading of his word
[2:47] the lord jesus christ speaking
[2:51] and telling us prophesying
[2:54] forewarning us that when we
[2:58] look to the world events
[3:03] or we look around us and see
[3:06] the conditions in the world social
[3:09] political
[3:10] educational in every form
[3:15] when we see the conditions similar
[3:18] to what was in sodom
[3:22] when those conditions are around us
[3:27] he says look for then the son of man
[3:32] will be revealed praise god
[3:36] i'm so happy to know that he is
[3:39] being revealed in our day and in our
[3:42] time
[3:43] by the opening of the word of god
[3:48] and making the the word of god
[3:51] plain to us for every one of us to
[3:54] understand for every one of us to
[3:58] humble ourselves to the word of god and
[4:02] to obey the word of god
[4:04] and walk in the light of your day
[4:08] and of your hour now
[4:11] what jesus was speaking of here
[4:16] was in the time of lot as it was
[4:20] in the days of lot well
[4:24] then we need to go back to the book of
[4:27] genesis
[4:29] around chapter 14
[4:32] and uh verses 18
[4:35] to 20 and we will
[4:39] find the story of abraham
[4:43] we will read how that abraham
[4:46] got word that his nephew lot
[4:50] who lived in sodom
[4:53] that he was captured
[4:57] by five kings and carried away
[5:01] into slavery
[5:04] and the bible tells us abraham
[5:08] called for his the 300 servants
[5:12] that he had with him and they
[5:15] girded themselves and
[5:18] got on their camels their horses
[5:22] and charged down after those
[5:25] five kings glory to god hallelujah
[5:28] amen those five kings of course my
[5:32] friends
[5:32] king touch king feel king here king c
[5:36] o praise god the five senses of the body
[5:40] as much as that was it was a symbol
[5:43] or a type of how the true believer
[5:47] would have to overcome or will be the
[5:50] overcomers over the five senses of the
[5:54] flesh
[5:56] and so abraham came down
[5:59] on with his servants oh
[6:02] praise god charged down upon them the
[6:05] bible said
[6:06] he defeated the five kings and
[6:09] every believer that believes
[6:13] god no matter what habits no matter what
[6:16] trouble no matter what trial no matter
[6:20] what sickness no matter what tribulation
[6:23] temptation comes your way i
[6:26] want to tell you definitively that
[6:30] god will grant you the power as
[6:33] he did to abraham to overcome
[6:36] every one of these five kings
[6:40] that tries to take you captive
[6:43] and to rule over your mind and over your
[6:48] body and over your life oh
[6:51] only believe all things are
[6:54] possible the them that will believe
[6:59] the word of god hallelujah thank you
[7:02] lord
[7:02] and so abraham
[7:06] became an overcomer defeating these five
[7:10] kings
[7:12] oh and on his return
[7:16] back the bible tells us
[7:19] one came out
[7:23] also to meet him
[7:27] and the name of the one that met abraham
[7:33] the bible says his name was melchizedek
[7:38] king of salem which means king of
[7:42] peace well
[7:45] you know the type the symbol jesus is
[7:48] the prince of peace
[7:49] but back then he was melchizedek
[7:55] king of salem praise god hallelujah
[7:59] you'll find the bible tells us
[8:02] this man melchizedek he was mysterious
[8:07] the other kings didn't know where he
[8:09] came from
[8:11] the bible tells us he had no mother
[8:15] no father no beginning
[8:19] no ending they simply
[8:22] did not know who he was
[8:26] well i'm here to tell you today who he
[8:28] was and who he
[8:30] is and who he will continue to be
[8:35] for abraham melchizedek
[8:39] and abraham met in the beginning of the
[8:43] bible
[8:44] now we know that god promised
[8:47] to abraham that
[8:50] what i do for you i will also do for
[8:54] your
[8:54] seed i will do it for your children
[8:58] i will give them the promises i gave to
[9:02] you
[9:03] those promises will also be theirs
[9:07] the covenant that i make with you
[9:10] that same covenant will also
[9:14] be theirs there will be the inheritors
[9:18] of whatever promises whatever blessings
[9:23] whatever covenants that i
[9:26] make with you abraham and so
[9:30] we are abraham's
[9:33] children by faith abraham's
[9:37] faith seed or abraham's
[9:41] royal seed we are
[9:44] kings and priests to god
[9:47] and we are of the spiritual
[9:50] lineage of abraham
[9:53] that is the reason why we have abrahamic
[9:57] faith
[9:58] abrahamic faith what do i mean abraham
[10:03] heard a voice speaking to him telling
[10:05] him come out of your country
[10:08] come and follow me and believe me
[10:11] the one true god and the bible says
[10:14] abraham believed god and came out of his
[10:18] sins
[10:18] came out of his idolatry came out of his
[10:22] background of on culture of which he was
[10:26] his father was a wealthy man down there
[10:30] in that nation but he came out of
[10:33] all of that praise god to hear the voice
[10:37] of god
[10:38] to believe the word of god and to follow
[10:41] the promise of god for his day
[10:43] and for his time and so
[10:47] he met melchizedek and the promises god
[10:52] made to abraham were also made to
[10:56] abraham's
[10:57] seed that would come
[11:00] down through the ages
[11:03] i believe we are now in the last days
[11:08] i believe the great holy spirit
[11:12] is here with us and among us
[11:15] and working and moving with a mighty
[11:18] hand
[11:20] bringing his children out of all
[11:23] of satan's prison houses where they were
[11:27] kept bound up tied up tangled up
[11:31] god has brought them out and is
[11:34] bringing them out with a mighty hand
[11:37] to the glory of his name just as he did
[11:41] to the children of israel brought them
[11:44] out of egypt
[11:45] just as it did to the children of israel
[11:48] that were
[11:49] under nebuchadnezzar he brought them out
[11:52] of
[11:52] babylon by a mighty hand
[11:56] and now he brings us out of worldliness
[12:00] he brings us out of filth and the mess
[12:03] of the world
[12:04] the stench of the world and the
[12:07] degradation of denomination
[12:10] he brings us out of all of that i i
[12:13] i just call denominations demon
[12:17] nations demon nations
[12:21] for it seems as if the devil works in
[12:24] that amongst them
[12:25] in the mighty way i'm not speaking about
[12:28] the individual
[12:29] people in those denominations
[12:33] but organizations are of the devil like
[12:37] that religious organizations
[12:40] they're not of god god never founded one
[12:42] of them
[12:43] you'll never find that anywhere from the
[12:45] book of acts right through to revelation
[12:48] never founded them god's people are an
[12:52] organism a living body of
[12:55] christ hallelujah walking in the light
[12:59] of god's word and obedience to the word
[13:01] of god
[13:02] hallelujah so now since abraham
[13:07] met melchizedek in type
[13:12] it is also what jesus is referring to
[13:17] listen to the parallel as
[13:20] it was in
[13:23] the days of lot
[13:27] so shall it be
[13:31] at the coming of the son of man
[13:36] i will not go into all of this right now
[13:39] but just enough to point to you that he
[13:42] is speaking
[13:44] that the children the royal seed of
[13:47] abraham
[13:48] the faint seed of abraham will
[13:51] also have a meeting
[13:55] or will have to meet melchizedek
[14:00] just like abraham met him
[14:03] back there in that day
[14:06] you are going to know it that the
[14:09] children of abraham
[14:11] the royal seat of abraham are supposed
[14:15] to meet melchizedek again
[14:17] by the promise of god he gives us the
[14:20] time
[14:21] he gives us the conditions of the time
[14:24] and he tells us what people will be
[14:27] doing
[14:28] now if you just look around you and you
[14:31] know it's happening
[14:32] eating drinking partying uh
[14:35] enjoying themselves and all that going
[14:39] on
[14:39] marrying giving in marriage taking on
[14:43] wives and wives women taking on several
[14:46] men and
[14:47] all that sort of thing it's going on
[14:49] right now
[14:50] and jesus said when you see these things
[14:56] then will the son of man
[14:59] be revealed i believe he is being
[15:01] revealed right now
[15:03] i believe the word of god is making
[15:06] itself known to you
[15:07] right now now you'll say to me well
[15:10] brother simon
[15:11] i've heard about melchizedek but who is
[15:14] this
[15:14] melchizedek now this
[15:18] melchizedek in short
[15:22] i told you and will tell you again
[15:26] as we know god is the eternal spirit
[15:31] living alone
[15:34] before the foundation of the world
[15:38] before he created anything
[15:41] god dwelt alone
[15:45] and there this the great almighty spirit
[15:48] dwelling alone
[15:51] later on he wanted
[15:54] to have children around him he wanted to
[15:57] be a healer a savior
[15:59] a father a deliverer he wanted to be
[16:02] a friend he wanted to be all in all
[16:07] and so this great mighty god
[16:10] realizing that he had a plan in his mind
[16:15] a a plan of redemption
[16:18] a great marvelous plan
[16:21] genesis 3 18 tells you that
[16:24] in there the seed of the woman will
[16:27] bruise the serpent's head
[16:29] god knew man would fall into sin
[16:32] and that man will need a savior
[16:37] and since there was no one else the
[16:40] bible said he
[16:41] swore by himself
[16:45] but there was no one else
[16:48] no bishop no pope no prince no
[16:52] king no commoner no none
[16:55] there was no one else that could save
[16:59] the world save the people his children
[17:03] but he himself and so he decided that he
[17:07] would come down
[17:09] oh what condition bringing
[17:12] us redemption and so god
[17:15] began to form himself
[17:20] from spirit
[17:23] to come down into flesh
[17:27] well part of the way of that
[17:30] transformation in
[17:34] greek words or in theological words
[17:38] which you don't need i'm using it so you
[17:41] can understand
[17:43] god made himself into a
[17:47] theophoney a teopany
[17:51] which is a a spirit body a
[17:54] word body
[17:57] this word formed it into a body
[18:02] that had the shape of a man
[18:07] who was called melchizedek
[18:10] king of peace king of righteousness
[18:14] glory to god hallelujah and so
[18:18] melchizedek us paul will tell you
[18:21] later i believe in the book of hebrews
[18:23] that melchizedek
[18:25] was really christ
[18:29] he wasn't jesus christ as yet
[18:33] but it was christ amen
[18:37] without mother without father
[18:41] without beginning without ending
[18:45] first and the last oh glory to god
[18:48] it was jesus christ
[18:52] god bringing himself down
[18:56] to redeem his own
[18:59] but now he is in this body
[19:03] representing himself
[19:07] in a theophanic body to the
[19:11] people of the world they couldn't
[19:14] understand
[19:15] him they couldn't explain him
[19:18] they could not interpret who he was
[19:22] where he come from where he was going
[19:25] yet they knew he was a king
[19:28] and he was he had no
[19:32] trace ability that they could not trace
[19:34] him
[19:35] they just had to trust him and had
[19:38] confidence
[19:39] in him later on
[19:42] that theophonic word
[19:46] body began to
[19:50] again change itself i'll use another
[19:53] word
[19:54] god began to end morphe
[19:58] himself e-n-m-o-r-p-h-e
[20:03] greek term changing himself he begins to
[20:08] end morphe forming himself
[20:11] into the shape of what we know
[20:15] as jesus christ for
[20:18] he was already christ there
[20:22] in melchizedek but now he was going to
[20:26] have a
[20:27] physical human body
[20:30] the body will be named jesus
[20:35] and melchizedek christ
[20:38] would be living in that body who is
[20:41] the smell cassidy the same god that was
[20:45] there in the eternities be
[20:48] come down to dwell in human flesh
[20:54] to walk amongst his creation
[20:57] that he had created
[21:00] in your bible john chapter 1 verse 1
[21:06] in the beginning was the word
[21:09] and the word was with god
[21:14] and the word was
[21:17] god did you hear what the bible says
[21:21] the word was god
[21:24] and furthermore it says and the
[21:28] word became flesh
[21:31] so in between melchizedek
[21:34] and jesus christ
[21:38] their merchandise
[21:41] was being on morphe becoming
[21:45] flesh and the word
[21:49] became flesh and dwelt among us
[21:54] hallelujah take god he's god in the
[21:58] father
[21:59] he's god in the son he's god
[22:03] in the holy ghost he's the god the only
[22:06] one i know god
[22:08] is god and god don't ever change i know
[22:12] god
[22:13] he's god and jesus is his name
[22:18] he's god when the lightning flashing
[22:20] he's god when the thunder
[22:22] rules he's god in the amen corner he's
[22:26] goddamn in my soul
[22:28] i know god he's god and god don't ever
[22:32] change
[22:33] i know god he's god and
[22:36] jesus is his name hallelujah
[22:40] oh praise god forevermore and so
[22:43] god the word form
[22:48] became flesh
[22:51] the word became flesh and dwelt among us
[22:55] oh praise his wonderful name
[22:58] you know the rest of the story
[23:02] and the angel gabriel came to a a virgin
[23:08] and said you shall bear a son
[23:12] and his name shall be called jesus
[23:16] every child born every person born has
[23:19] to be given an earthly name
[23:22] they must receive a earthly name by
[23:25] which they will be recognized
[23:27] and called by so when he came
[23:30] into flesh they had to give him an
[23:33] earthly name
[23:34] and that name was jesus
[23:38] how significant do you know the meaning
[23:41] of the name
[23:42] jesus the name jesus
[23:46] is saying he is jehovah
[23:51] has now become our savior
[23:54] jesus means jehovah our savior
[23:58] the same jehovah of the old testament
[24:02] that lived in eternity came
[24:05] down and morphed himself
[24:09] into human flesh that he
[24:12] might become our savior to deliver us
[24:17] from the bondage of sin
[24:20] hell the grave and from hell
[24:24] glory to god hallelujah and so friends
[24:29] here was god
[24:32] being raised in a human body
[24:36] but yet being god the bible said he
[24:39] humbled himself
[24:41] he took more reputation as you find the
[24:44] book of philippians
[24:47] and there it is he he ran around like a
[24:51] like a child moved around like an
[24:54] ordinary human
[24:57] but he was still god and so one day
[25:03] joseph and mary they went up to the
[25:05] great feast
[25:08] and there the bible says he got
[25:12] they drifted away from him
[25:15] god help you don't you drift away from
[25:18] the word of god
[25:20] don't lose the word of god don't let the
[25:23] attractions and the things
[25:25] of this life and of this world draw you
[25:28] away from the things of god
[25:31] but hold to god's unchanging hand
[25:34] prophet not this world's vain riches
[25:37] that so rapidly decay oh praise
[25:41] god but whole to god's unchanging hand
[25:44] now one forevermore and so
[25:47] when they realize that they lost him
[25:52] they started to search around trying to
[25:55] find him
[25:56] friends if somewhere in your life
[25:59] you fell away backslid lost the word
[26:02] lost your position it oh my come
[26:06] back to the word of god come back to
[26:08] this word and know
[26:10] him in the power of his resurrection and
[26:13] in the fellowship
[26:14] of his suffering all glory to god
[26:17] and now friends just search for him
[26:22] and when they found him
[26:26] mary rushed to him
[26:30] and turned and said
[26:34] your father and i
[26:38] search for you
[26:41] it was god in the body of a 12 year old
[26:45] boy
[26:46] and she knew it for then he turned
[26:50] and he looked into her eyes and said
[26:53] woman
[26:55] woman
[26:58] do you know to whom you're speaking
[27:01] and she was quiet the bible is not
[27:05] written
[27:05] not another word came out of her
[27:09] the bible said she just took him
[27:13] and went back on their journey wherever
[27:16] they had to go
[27:17] and it was never mentioned again in the
[27:19] bible but
[27:20] right there god spoke out of that little
[27:25] boy's body that child's body
[27:28] amen and brought her to her senses
[27:34] to recognize who it was
[27:37] that dwelt in that flesh
[27:41] body the word was made flesh
[27:45] and dwelt among us amen
[27:48] well i'm saying to say this
[27:51] many say that mary
[27:55] was the mother of jesus christ
[27:59] obviously you know that's unscriptural
[28:03] that's error that is completely
[28:06] wrong for he was before her
[28:10] he said before abraham was i
[28:14] am and there is
[28:17] mary decoy the mother of god she could
[28:20] not be the mother of god
[28:23] god has no beginning no ending god
[28:26] eternal
[28:27] amen what's the devil trying to do with
[28:30] that kind of a doctrine
[28:32] trying to tell you that she was
[28:35] eternal before he was eternal there's
[28:38] only one eternal
[28:40] and that one eternal is god and all of
[28:44] his children
[28:44] it's still god but a part of him that's
[28:48] now
[28:48] being revealed and manifested
[28:51] upon the face of the earth mary is
[28:54] supposed to be the mother
[28:56] of jesus christ but that's completely
[29:00] wrong
[29:02] that's the reason why he called her
[29:04] woman he didn't call her he didn't say
[29:07] mother no when she turned him and said
[29:09] your father and i
[29:11] of course she already because she also
[29:13] rejected
[29:14] the supernatural birth by saying that
[29:17] she was now claiming like
[29:18] like joseph was his father and
[29:22] of course she was rebuked by the holy

[37:16] are not sinners saved
[37:20] by grace let me repeat that that will
[37:22] sound
[37:23] kind of controversial the true sons and
[37:27] daughters of god
[37:29] are not sinners saved
[37:32] by grace for we
[37:36] are children of the most high
[37:40] and you were in him

[37:58] that
[37:59] man as paul calls him the hidden man
[38:03] of the heart that man never did anything
[38:07] wrong to begin with
[38:09] that's jo first john for the seed of
[38:12] god cannot commit sin
[38:15] it cannot do it for it is god himself
[38:19] in the individual working out there if
[38:22] they
[38:22] make us humans we'll look and see them
[38:24] do this or maybe they made that
[38:26] it's this outer man here doing all kinds
[38:29] of tricks upon them
[38:31] but you hold on to god's hand and god
[38:34] will deliver you
[38:35] in every possible way amen thank god
[38:39] we are the very attributes
[38:44] or the thoughts the
[38:48] attributes of god himself a man and his
[38:51] thoughts
[38:52] are one man and his attributes
[38:56] are one god and his children are one
[39:01] jesus said i and my father are one

[42:12] into it
[42:13] and search out these things whether they
[42:16] be true
[42:17] but they are true for they are in the
[42:19] word of god
[42:21] and jesus has made it plain amen
[42:24] hallelujah oh god bless you my friends
[42:28] that you clearly see the revelation of
