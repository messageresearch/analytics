[1:17] is my lord

[1:28] confess that
[1:32] jesus christ
[1:35] is lord
[1:39] yes my brothers and sisters i
[1:42] want to proclaim him today and every day
[1:46] of my life
[1:47] that jesus christ is
[1:51] lord let us read our
[1:54] scripture today let us pray
[1:59] and then we will go into the word of god
[2:04] speaking today or teaching today
[2:08] on jesus the living
[2:12] word out of
[2:15] revelation chapter 2 verse 12
[2:19] it reads and to the
[2:22] angel of the church in pergamus
[2:27] right these things said he
[2:32] which had the sharp sword with two
[2:36] edges praise god
[2:40] let us pray father we ask your blessing
[2:44] upon the bread of life
[2:48] that as we break this bread
[2:53] you said man shall not live by bread
[2:55] alone but by every
[2:57] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[2:59] god
[3:01] may the living word proceed
[3:05] out of the written and spoken word and
[3:08] make himself manifested
[3:11] by the revelation
[3:15] opening of the word opening of the heart
[3:17] the mind
[3:19] and may thy spirit lord
[3:22] god rest eternally within our being
[3:26] take all the glory honor and praise
[3:30] we are just here to represent you for
[3:32] your namesake
[3:34] in jesus name amen
[3:37] the lord bless you my dear brothers and
[3:39] sisters
[3:40] bear in mind that our scripture which we
[3:44] just read
[3:46] says and to the angel of the
[3:49] church in
[3:52] pergamus now this is not an angel
[3:55] in heaven but this is to
[3:59] the angel in the church
[4:03] not an angel uh in the heavenly places
[4:07] but an angel on the earth
[4:11] that is moved by the holy spirit
[4:15] to bring god's message
[4:18] or word to the church
[4:22] of his day
[4:27] that these things yet he which had the
[4:30] sharp sword with two edges
[4:34] the one that is speaking is now
[4:37] identifying himself and making it known
[4:42] who he is now we understand
[4:47] that the message to the third
[4:50] church age is about to come forth
[4:55] third unfolding drama
[4:59] of jesus christ in the midst of his
[5:02] church
[5:03] is about to be revealed
[5:07] and now we hear the sound of the
[5:10] trumpet-like voice
[5:12] of god the spirit presenting
[5:15] the matchless one in his glorious
[5:20] divine splendor walking
[5:23] up and down among the candlesticks
[5:27] he which had the sharp sword praise
[5:30] god with two edges hallelujah
[5:33] all the new testament cut you going
[5:36] forward and coming backwards
[5:38] the word of god cuts the very individual
[5:42] that's preaching the word of god it
[5:45] comes back and it searches the heart the
[5:47] mind
[5:48] the very life of the one who is bringing
[5:52] forth the word of god for it is a
[5:54] two-edged sword
[5:56] and here we see friends
[6:01] in the ephesian church age
[6:04] there was a revelation of god
[6:08] and in that church age god he was set
[6:11] forth
[6:12] as the unchanging god
[6:16] unchanging god
[6:19] then here in the smernian
[6:23] church age he presented himself to us
[6:29] as the one true
[6:32] god and beside him
[6:36] there is no other no other name
[6:40] given under heaven whereby we
[6:43] must be saved but the name of jesus
[6:46] christ
[6:49] in the protagonist church age which we
[6:52] are now studying
[6:54] we are now receiving a further
[6:57] revelation of this
[7:00] mighty god in christ
[7:04] and so we see he presents himself
[7:09] as the one with the sharp to edged
[7:13] sword which is the word of god
[7:18] this great unfolding revelation
[7:22] now god never does something without a
[7:26] reason
[7:27] and there is a reason and a purpose
[7:31] why he under identifies himself
[7:34] having one name but yet he identifies
[7:37] himself
[7:38] with different titles and different
[7:42] representations of himself
[7:45] unfolding through the ages
[7:49] and now we see here he says
[7:53] he is the word of god
[7:57] now why is a fresh revelation
[8:00] given because just as
[8:04] much as satan
[8:07] is changing his strategy
[8:11] he is changing his attacks
[8:15] changes the way that he approaches
[8:18] the the church and the believers
[8:22] within the church
[8:24] [Music]
[8:25] now revelation chapter 6
[8:31] when the first four seals were opened
[8:36] a voice cried out in the temple of god
[8:41] come and see and when john
[8:44] looked john saw first a
[8:48] white horse then he saw
[8:52] a red horse then he saw a black
[8:56] horse and then he saw a pale horse
[9:01] under the first four seals
[9:05] now there's a reason why god made that
[9:08] known to us and we will
[9:10] study that later on
[9:14] but that was the spirit of the
[9:17] antichrist
[9:20] riding on the white horse
[9:23] of religion
[9:26] under the disguise of religion
[9:30] he is riding on the white horse
[9:34] deceiving
[9:36] and seducing the minds and
[9:40] hearts of those whose names were
[9:43] not written on the land's book of life
[9:46] before the foundation of the world
[9:51] this is his spirit of deception and
[9:54] death
[9:56] and he is deceiving through the angel
[9:59] ages
[10:00] for she came as a as a white horse
[10:04] hiding under behind religion which he
[10:06] still is doing
[10:08] then he changed himself to a red horse
[10:11] after people began to
[10:13] recognize what he was doing through the
[10:16] evil
[10:17] of the uh wicked uh
[10:20] church at that time
[10:23] working through it he changed to another
[10:26] horse
[10:27] and there he began to use the white red
[10:31] horse
[10:32] and after that was discovered or exposed
[10:37] that he had changed his way of approach
[10:39] under the
[10:40] red horse of war and blood
[10:44] and inquisitions and that
[10:48] then he changed to a black horse
[10:53] that was going forth with plagues and
[10:56] death and
[10:57] and hunger and thirsting
[11:00] and starvation and killing out
[11:03] multitudes of
[11:05] people just to get to the believers but
[11:08] many others in europe and many other
[11:11] countries
[11:12] were being killed and it seemed like if
[11:15] it was just a worldwide plague
[11:18] that was aimed at the entire human race
[11:21] but in actual fact his aim was to get
[11:26] to god's little flock god's elect
[11:29] people his few that was mixed
[11:33] into the whole human bundle
[11:36] oh he was finally light shined upon that
[11:41] and he was exposed
[11:46] and he changed jumped off that horse and
[11:49] jumped on another horse
[11:51] and began to ride the horse but that was
[11:55] a pale horse
[11:57] well pale horse he had a mixture
[12:01] of the first three horses
[12:04] a mixture of those colors mixed together
[12:08] made up the pale horse which means he
[12:10] had all the same
[12:12] qualities propensities for evil for
[12:15] lying for deceiving for death and
[12:19] suffering it was all in him
[12:22] still but coming up under a different
[12:25] color so when he does his
[12:29] changes thank god we serve a
[12:32] god who never leaves himself without a
[12:36] witness
[12:38] no matter how dark the day dismal the
[12:41] times
[12:42] perilous the hour god always
[12:45] has a witness and so god
[12:48] never left himself without a witness
[12:52] but god as the bible says when the enemy
[12:56] comes
[12:57] in like a flood the spirit of god will
[13:01] rise up a standard
[13:03] against him amen and to
[13:06] god's standard god's highest standard
[13:11] is to raise up the standard of his word
[13:15] you know what a standard is it just
[13:18] means a
[13:19] level but also going to war
[13:22] they'll carry the flag and the flag
[13:26] tells clearly whose side you're on
[13:29] so god's in this age
[13:33] god is emphasizing that the word of god
[13:37] is his standard
[13:40] and jesus christ is a living
[13:43] word of god which is the standard
[13:48] revelation of who god is in christ
[13:52] is the standard hallelujah
[13:56] it divides between truth and era
[13:59] it lets you know right and wrong
[14:03] you recognize clearly
[14:06] in that day when the people
[14:09] were faced with all manner of
[14:14] evil
[14:16] on all manner
[14:20] of different beliefs
[14:23] they needed an anchor something that
[14:27] will hold them
[14:28] firmly we know god said
[14:31] uh his word does not change his word
[14:35] does not lie his word does not
[14:39] pass away for heaven and earth may
[14:42] pass away but my word stands forever
[14:49] excuse me but god uses
[14:52] his word as his standard
[14:57] in that age now
[15:00] we understand in the god's word
[15:05] and we understand why he is associating
[15:09] pointing to and representing himself
[15:13] in the word for that is his
[15:17] name the word
[15:21] of god first john 1
[15:24] 1. in the beginning
[15:28] was the word hallelujah
[15:32] now we understand that of course genesis
[15:36] 1 says
[15:36] in the beginning god
[15:40] created the heavens and the earth
[15:44] in the beginning the earth the world was
[15:47] without form and void
[15:49] and god said see the word hallelujah
[15:55] so in the beginning was the
[15:58] word now they
[16:01] root the root of the
[16:05] word of that word that we are saying now
[16:09] word the root
[16:13] of it is logos
[16:17] l-o-g-o-s
[16:19] which really means
[16:23] the thought or the concept
[16:28] in the beginning was the logos
[16:32] before the written word before the
[16:34] spoken word before any
[16:36] other thing in the beginning what they
[16:39] thought or the concept
[16:43] the idea that was in the mind of god
[16:49] that came first then the other
[16:52] levels of the unfolding of the word of
[16:57] god
[16:58] came afterwards amen
[17:03] now we know
[17:06] that that logos has a double meaning
[17:10] of both thought and speech
[17:15] first the logos or the word
[17:18] when it is in the thoughts but
[17:21] then when it it uh and morphed
[17:25] itself to speech it is still the
[17:29] word in spoken form
[17:33] and then when that word is believed and
[17:36] received in the heart
[17:38] of a person a believer then
[17:42] that word becomes the
[17:45] living word living in the hearts
[17:50] living in the bodies living in the minds
[17:54] of god's people a people
[17:58] that were elected by god
[18:02] before the foundations of the world
[18:05] to be the receptors the vessels
[18:10] the receptacles that will receive
[18:14] him in your
[18:17] age or your time when he will
[18:20] come to find
[18:24] his true seed when the son of man
[18:28] comes shall he find faith upon the earth
[18:31] yes he will but he will come to
[18:35] find those whom he had allocated
[18:39] predestinated
[18:41] to each age for him to be able
[18:45] to have these consecrated dedicated
[18:49] bodies to indwell
[18:52] and use so that he could reveal
[18:57] himself not just as the
[19:01] word as a thought not just the word
[19:04] only spoken but the
[19:07] revealed living word
[19:11] the word of god living again
[19:14] on the earth to fulfill hebrews
[19:18] chapter 14 verse 8 13 8
[19:22] jesus christ the same
[19:25] yesterday today
[19:28] and forever today in you and me
[19:32] today in the true believer and
[19:35] forever the eternal one oh blessed be
[19:38] the name
[19:39] of the living god let's get back to it
[19:42] logos the root meaning
[19:46] thought or concept
[19:50] hallelujah so a thought
[19:54] expressed becomes a word
[19:58] that we can hear the thought
[20:01] expressed becomes a word
[20:04] that we can hear see the origin
[20:08] is back there in god's mind it was the
[20:12] thought it was the concept the
[20:15] idea that was in this mind that is the
[20:18] logos the original
[20:20] these are only an unfolding
[20:24] of that logos that is here now
[20:27] we are still making himself known
[20:31] by revealing himself to us
[20:35] and then through us
[20:38] so that he may be glorified by his
[20:42] people who see him
[20:45] and recognize him in the written word
[20:51] you see that is why i keep emphasizing
[20:55] and re-emphasizing
[20:56] over and over again and i will never
[21:00] stop re-emphasizing it and trying to
[21:03] make it clearer
[21:04] and clearer to everyone
[21:07] that will believe the word of god
[21:11] that we are not here to just emphasize
[21:13] the writing
[21:15] or the quotations
[21:18] of the written word that is why we say
[21:22] it's not bible schools it's not colleges
[21:25] not universities they have their place
[21:28] but we don't rely
[21:30] upon the right thing or the written
[21:33] word which we can see or anything like
[21:36] that
[21:37] but we are trying to bring god's people
[21:40] back or restore god's people back
[21:44] to the sought to the
[21:48] idea to what was in the mind of god
[21:52] bring you back to the original
[21:56] though because the word of god is the
[21:59] original
[22:00] sea life of the genuine sons
[22:04] and daughters of the living god amen
[22:09] you see the thought
[22:12] or concept amen
[22:18] was represented
[22:21] by writing the writing only
[22:24] represented the concept
[22:27] and still represents the concept
[22:31] so the writing is true the writing
[22:35] is the word but this is the written word
[22:39] we are not just talking about the
[22:41] written word
[22:43] but the life behind the word
[22:46] the sought the death the eternal
[22:50] realities of the living god
[22:54] that's beyond the veil hallelujah
[22:58] praise his marvelous name amen
[23:02] the original thought idea or meanings
[23:06] behind the writing that is upon
[23:10] the pages thank god
[23:14] that is marvelous and wonderful and
[23:16] beautiful
[23:19] and john tells us
[23:22] that this meaning
[23:25] expression of god was mad
[23:28] clear in christ in jesus christ
[23:34] for jesus is the fullness of the godhead
[23:39] bodily the very substance of god
[23:43] the very essence of god
[23:47] the word was made flesh
[23:50] they sought the concept
[23:55] the idea or meaning of who god
[23:58] is was mad flesh
[24:02] and dwelt among us oh glory
[24:06] be to his marvelous name hallelujah
[24:10] that great spirit god
[24:13] unto which no man could approach
[24:17] before in genesis
[24:20] down through the ages thousands of years
[24:23] ago
[24:25] abraham might have caught the first
[24:28] early revelation that there is a god
[24:31] almighty god one of the first
[24:33] revelations
[24:35] but they could not see him
[24:38] they did not know him and
[24:41] most of the people feared him for when
[24:44] he came
[24:45] down on the mountains with
[24:49] smoke and fire and
[24:52] oh the light of god thunderings
[24:56] lightnings upon the mountains and the
[24:58] voice of god roaring out like a lion
[25:02] and so fear came upon the people
[25:05] when they heard god in the heavens on
[25:08] the mountain
[25:09] in the thunder when it rolls and god in
[25:13] the lightning when the lightning flashes
[25:16] they were afraid of that god
[25:20] amen but now
[25:24] jesus christ that god that was there
[25:28] thundering with lightning was in
[25:31] christ tabernacled in a human body
[25:36] that he might be known believed
[25:40] loved and served by
[25:44] his people that would believe him
[25:47] and love him praise god he dwelt among
[25:51] men to express the fullness of god
[25:56] to men to bring a
[25:59] clear understanding and knowledge
[26:03] to men who god
[26:06] is what god's
[26:09] characteristics are what his personality
[26:14] is like all of that was pictured
[26:18] in jesus christ that we could see
[26:21] that he is a god of love but he's a god
[26:25] of justice
[26:26] also we can see him with
[26:29] a power to raise the dead
[26:32] hallelujah but he is a god that can give
[26:37] life fear not him that can
[26:40] kill the body but fear him
[26:44] that can kill both body and soul
[26:49] first john 1 john chapter 1 the gospel
[26:52] of john
[26:53] 1 verse 18
[26:57] no man had seen god at any time
[27:02] the only begotten son
[27:05] which is in the bosom of the father
[27:09] he had declared
[27:12] him hallelujah that
[27:15] god has now become
[27:19] emmanuel god with us
[27:23] remember god above us
[27:27] god with us in
[27:30] our day god who used to be
[27:34] with israel walk with them
[27:38] that god has now come to dwell
[27:42] in them so god above us god
[27:45] with us now god in us
[27:49] oh he lives in me i want to say today
[27:54] he lives in me the god of all heaven and
[27:57] earth
[27:58] he lives in me i praise him and thank
[28:02] him
[28:02] that he chose me as a vessel
[28:06] to use in my age my day
[28:09] my time and to live in me
[28:12] you say oh uh brother simon
[28:15] you may have outward faults and flaws
[28:18] you may not be
[28:20] perfectly outside 100 percent
[28:24] but that is the love of god that is the
[28:27] grace of god
[28:28] that he chose him perfect people
[28:31] that he could now perfect himself in and
[28:34] through
[28:35] them by the potter can take the clay
[28:39] and and make it over again he could take
[28:42] my life your life the life of anyone
[28:46] no matter how mixed up tangled up no
[28:48] matter how
[28:49] dirty filthy no matter how man may call
[28:52] it pure but in the eyes of god that's
[28:54] not pure
[28:55] god can take the entire vessel
[28:59] with its aims ambitions all of its fears
[29:02] and complexes and depressions
[29:05] and the pressures that come upon us take
[29:07] us
[29:08] and make us and shape us all
[29:11] over again into what he wants us to be
[29:15] amen
[29:16] not what i want to be but what he
[29:19] wants me to be that my will o lord but
[29:23] thy will be done amen
[29:26] praise god forevermore may the will of
[29:29] god be done within our lives and let us
[29:33] be
[29:33] shaped by the unchanged and transformed
[29:38] by the living word of god hallelujah do
[29:42] you believe this word of god is living
[29:45] this written word represents the
[29:48] thought the original root the very
[29:52] concept the meaning the idea the very
[29:55] essence of god himself and the word of
[29:59] god has come to
[30:00] live in us and move in
[30:04] us that we might become living voices
[30:08] living people living epistles
[30:11] to be read and known of
[30:14] all men not just the bible here
[30:17] being read but you and i have to become
[30:22] living representations of this
[30:25] written word so that men who know
[30:29] not god or think they know about god
[30:32] will see christ in you and will be able
[30:36] to read the bible read the word
[30:39] read the manifestation the rev
[30:42] unfolding revelation of god
[30:46] himself amen amen emmanuel
[30:50] god made flesh and dwelt among us and
[30:54] his dwelling among
[30:55] us and making himself known once again
[30:59] to the world amen praise god
[31:02] hallelujah god with us
[31:07] amen the bible says
[31:11] john 1 18 he
[31:14] jesus christ had declared
[31:18] him now that word declare
[31:22] doesn't mean just someone standing up
[31:25] and unknown saying
[31:27] that's part of it but declared
[31:30] let me use a theological word here the
[31:33] exit jesus
[31:36] the xe jesus e x
[31:39] e g e s
[31:43] i s which means to
[31:46] thoroughly explain and to make
[31:50] something clear
[31:53] hallelujah and that is
[31:56] what the living word jesus christ
[32:00] has done is doing and
[32:04] will do to the very end of the age
[32:08] you see he jesus christ
[32:12] exegesis god to us
[32:16] he made god clear he made god
[32:20] fully explained and revealed to us
[32:25] by the words he spoke by the life he
[32:28] lived oh praise god
[32:31] and the holy spirit continues his work
[32:34] now
[32:35] by coming to the written word
[32:39] and giving the genuine elected believer
[32:43] and exegesis of this word
[32:47] others may read it others may write it
[32:51] others may make books about it videos
[32:55] dvds
[32:56] all kinds of uh things they can do from
[32:58] it
[33:00] but only the elected will be allowed
[33:03] into beyond the veil to a clear
[33:08] understanding of the exegesis
[33:12] clear explanation revelation and
[33:15] declaration
[33:17] of the word of god oh in speaking i am
[33:21] trusting that the great holy spirit
[33:26] for i'm only a man that can speak words
[33:29] and
[33:30] bring forth thoughts but
[33:33] he can declare what it is i'm
[33:36] trying to say to you oh
[33:40] many years it may sound strange
[33:43] others it may sound like fantastics
[33:47] but may the great god of heaven the
[33:50] great
[33:51] living holy spirit not just heal your
[33:54] body
[33:56] but may he heal your wounded broken
[33:59] spirit
[34:01] and give you life again may you be
[34:04] born again may the sea life be germinate
[34:09] again
[34:10] may it come up to life and spring up to
[34:13] bear
[34:14] fruit in the days to come
[34:17] and declare from what seed you came from
[34:20] for every seed shall bring
[34:23] forth after its kind i may call one may
[34:27] say
[34:27] i'm a christian i'm this i'm that but
[34:29] the seed that you are
[34:31] originally against your own will
[34:35] it will bring forth after its kind the
[34:38] lemon
[34:38] can't say oh it's going to expose me to
[34:41] the people that i'm a lemon so
[34:43] i i want to be changed into a cherry so
[34:46] that they will love me
[34:47] oh the left the lemon can't change its
[34:50] origin
[34:52] amen and oh oh my friend
[34:55] let me say this whatever
[34:58] seed was in you before the foundation of
[35:03] the world
[35:04] the you see that's why the evidence is
[35:07] not just the
[35:08] reign of the holy spirit coming on the
[35:10] seed
[35:11] but the holy spirit is just a rain
[35:14] coming
[35:15] but the seed itself the rain
[35:18] brings out what the seed originally
[35:22] is and that's what the holy spirit has
[35:25] come to
[35:26] do is to make you know you're a daughter
[35:30] of god you're a son of god
[35:32] you are children of the living king of
[35:35] hosts the lord of hosts amen the lord of
[35:39] hosts
[35:40] the jehovah wow of the armies of heaven
[35:44] of the family of heaven and earth in
[35:46] whom their name
[35:47] and the name is jesus christ glory be to
[35:51] god on high hallelujah amen
[35:55] he was making jesus the living word
[36:00] was making one
[36:03] or explaining
[36:06] and making clear who god
[36:10] is and now he comes in us
[36:14] and that's what the holy spirit is in us
[36:17] to do
[36:18] is to make god clear not by just
[36:22] talk talking but by
[36:25] him revealing himself in and through you
[36:28] for your life and your talk
[36:32] must line up with your walk
[36:36] let me say that again your life
[36:41] your walk and your talk must line up
[36:44] together
[36:46] to present to the people a clear
[36:50] understanding of who god is
[36:54] god is not a sex exposure
[36:59] god is not a uh some kind of a sex
[37:03] loving man god is not a greedy
[37:09] god is not a liar cheat or any of those
[37:12] things i won't go down my
[37:13] entire list that's where your spirit can
[37:15] follow those things
[37:17] but god is not that he's he's come
[37:20] to show you how to live
[37:23] like him who he is how he walked
[37:27] how he dressed praise god
[37:30] why would a man go around
[37:34] wearing all kinds of pants
[37:37] himself bulging in the front and bulging
[37:40] behind and
[37:41] walking around like that claiming he's
[37:43] pretending representing god
[37:46] why would a woman go out with all manner
[37:49] of sex exposure
[37:51] clothing exposing our breasts
[37:54] exposing her behind exposing every part
[37:57] of her body
[38:00] and presenting herself with with the
[38:03] with sex attraction rather than with the
[38:05] attraction
[38:06] of the word of god and the purity and
[38:09] the holiness and the life that was
[38:11] in christ now living in you
[38:16] why would that man want to go around
[38:20] like that
[38:22] or that woman
[38:25] shorts
[38:29] tight jeans
[38:33] why would a woman when the bible says
[38:37] she shall not put on
[38:41] anything that
[38:44] pertains to a man that is the bible
[38:48] that's not brother simon telling you
[38:50] that that's the word of god
[38:52] saying that to you that is how we should
[38:55] walk
[38:56] like holy women of god like sarah
[38:59] like mary oh like rules
[39:03] oh the children of god man that
[39:06] walk like man not mice or mangoes or
[39:10] or rats or snakes in the grass
[39:14] liars and cheats and seducers
[39:18] and liars of every form but real men
[39:23] will stand with the word of god
[39:26] and live like men take care of their
[39:30] responsibilities
[39:32] wives and children like god takes care
[39:36] of his own
[39:37] protects them provides for them
[39:40] even will go as far as dying for them
[39:44] that's the love of god he wants to see
[39:47] reflected in us as
[39:48] men and as women praise
[39:52] god now satan may put all kinds of veils
[39:55] on us
[39:56] and we look uh the world looks on us and
[39:58] once we
[39:59] we were a drunk once we were we were
[40:01] this once we were that
[40:02] that's what he presented you as to the
[40:05] world
[40:06] but now we are changed we are
[40:08] transformed we are
[40:09] anointed the scales have come off of our
[40:13] eyes and
[40:14] we recognize and we can see clearly now
[40:17] as jimmy cliff says i can see clearly
[40:21] now
[40:21] the rain is gone
[40:25] i can see all obstacles in my way
[40:29] hallelujah all of the dark clouds all
[40:32] praise
[40:32] god hallelujah they're driven away amen
[40:36] wow hallelujah oh my it's a it's a
[40:40] bright bright
[40:41] sunshiny day for the sun is up
[40:45] the word is declared the light is
[40:48] shining upon our hearts glory to
[40:50] god all the foggy presumption days of
[40:54] the
[40:54] presumption are now being cleared away
[40:58] and the gloom is going
[41:00] past and now we can look into tomorrow
[41:04] and see there's a new life there's a
[41:07] rapture at hand
[41:08] there's a power in the presence of the
[41:10] living god
[41:11] i'm going out of here but while i'm here
[41:15] let me live as close as i possibly can
[41:18] to the to the representation jesus
[41:21] christ has given and
[41:23] is giving within the revelation
[41:27] of the word of god hallelujah
[41:32] amen first john 1 1-3
[41:38] which was from the beginning
[41:42] which we have heard amen
[41:47] praise the lord see which we have
[41:51] seen with our eyes
[41:55] which we have looked upon
[42:00] our hands have handled
[42:04] their word of life or the living word
[42:08] the word of life
[42:11] for that life was
[42:14] manifested and we have seen it
[42:19] we have seen the manifestation of what
[42:23] was an invisible
[42:24] life that was in god
[42:28] we have seen it because now that
[42:30] invisible
[42:31] life has now made itself manifested
[42:35] in a man now in our day true men and
[42:37] women
[42:38] so that it may be known recognize
[42:42] that you're not just a woman or a man
[42:44] walking on the street but there's
[42:46] something different
[42:47] about you something in you
[42:50] makes you different he lights up your
[42:53] life
[42:55] your life becomes a shining light
[42:58] walking in this dark and dismal day of
[43:01] conflict disease depressions and death
[43:06] oh my that life
[43:10] manifested to be seen
[43:14] that life manifested to bear witness
[43:18] amen the life
[43:21] manifested to show display
[43:24] make clear to the people hallelujah
[43:30] that eternal life that you have in you
[43:34] that eternal life that was
[43:37] in the father and was the father
[43:40] amen now made manifest
[43:43] each one of us that we have seen what we
[43:47] have heard declare unto you
[43:50] that you may have fellowship with us
[43:53] that's real fellowship not by bringing a
[43:56] bunch of people through church
[43:58] organization or denomination
[44:01] but when a bunch of people
[44:04] begin to see on an individual basis
[44:08] the same things within the word of god
[44:12] they are brought together not by man but
[44:15] by god himself
[44:16] into what is a fellowship
[44:20] if you will look in your bible you will
[44:21] see paul himself saying
[44:23] oh i i wish i could make all men see
[44:26] what is the fellowship of this mystery
[44:31] the revelation of this mystery how it
[44:33] draws people together
[44:35] and if there's any elected seed around
[44:37] you or in your
[44:38] area or in your city or nearby or
[44:41] anywhere
[44:42] god will draw them with the cards of
[44:45] love with the magnetizing power
[44:48] of the one who said if i be lifted up i
[44:51] will draw
[44:52] all men unto me o glory to god he is
[44:55] drawing
[44:56] the third pull is on the power of god is
[44:59] on
[45:00] the presence of god is on you see
[45:04] in the smyrna church age
[45:07] where the church was being challenged
[45:09] and confronted
[45:11] by the belief in many gods
[45:14] god to counteract satan's strategy
[45:18] had to present himself as the one god
[45:22] for they were presenting to the people
[45:24] that he's a trinity he is a
[45:26] he's this he's a folly a god you know
[45:28] many gods
[45:29] and he says no i'm not trinity i'm not
[45:33] three i'm not
[45:34] million i'm not a thousand i'm not a
[45:36] fight-headed or
[45:38] five-armed god i'm one god
[45:41] one person one god and so he had to
[45:45] emphasize that in the smyrna
[45:49] church age now in this age of pergamos
[45:55] the people who were being challenged by
[45:58] all kinds of false manifestations
[46:01] tongues is the evidence oh
[46:05] a prophecy of this is the evidence or
[46:08] or or some other sign is the evidence
[46:13] bearing false witness of the word of god
[46:17] you see if you put a sign by the side of
[46:19] the road
[46:20] which has boys many times we would turn
[46:23] the sign that was on the road uh let it
[46:26] point in a different direction
[46:28] it is still a sign but that sign is
[46:32] bearing
[46:32] false witness it's telling a lie
[46:37] of which direction you are supposed to
[46:40] go
[46:40] into and so this is what was happening
[46:45] back there the devil was twisting the
[46:48] word
[46:49] to point in a different direction the
[46:51] very word he was preaching
[46:53] the very word he was so-called bible
[46:56] teaching
[46:57] the very word he was using for his
[46:59] denominational
[47:00] objectives but it was pointing in a
[47:03] completely
[47:05] wrong direction and that is why we say
[47:08] back to the original word of god
[47:13] so god is presenting himself in this
[47:16] age of pergamos as the
[47:20] living word to point the people and
[47:24] bring them back to the original faith
[47:27] of the original life of god
[47:32] to live and walk within the hearts
[47:36] of his people praise god forevermore
[47:40] hallelujah my friends as i'm going to
[47:43] begin to wind this down
[47:46] i want you to know that the word
[47:50] will only come to the spirit filled
[47:54] or the way i would express it the word
[47:57] of god
[47:59] can only and will only
[48:02] come to the predestinated
[48:06] vessels that he prepared from before the
[48:08] foundation of the world
[48:10] as mary was sarah
[48:14] ruth different ones
[48:17] man that he prepared women that were
[48:20] predestinated
[48:22] for his purpose that when he comes to a
[48:24] certain age
[48:25] he has bodies he has vessels
[48:28] satisfied by himself you don't sacrifice
[48:32] yourself but he sanctifies
[48:34] clean you up for his own use and for his
[48:37] own glory
[48:38] thanks be to god not of works of
[48:41] righteousness by which we have done
[48:43] but by his mercy that he saves us
[48:47] and cleans us and so the word of god
[48:50] comes to the predestinated vessel
[48:55] the holy spirit the great eagle
[48:58] will seek he will search
[49:02] until he finds that those vessels
[49:07] but the word will always only come
[49:10] to the predestinated vessels that's why
[49:13] unto you it is given to know the mystery
[49:17] of the kingdom of the kingdom of god
[49:20] unto you
[49:21] it is given to recognize the shepherd's
[49:24] call
[49:25] unto you it is given to recognize
[49:29] the cry of the great jehovah eagle
[49:33] speaking to your soul bearing witness as
[49:36] the
[49:37] deep crawls to the deep and the deep
[49:39] response back to the word
[49:41] oh praise god forevermore and that is
[49:45] why
[49:46] he has to pass your way
[49:51] because you and i you are ones that he
[49:53] has to pick up
[49:56] there cannot be any rapture there can
[49:59] not be
[49:59] any catching away of the church until
[50:02] that last
[50:03] one is brought in by his mighty hand
[50:07] by his divine call hallelujah
[50:10] god is now giving his last altar call
[50:14] by the blessed holy spirit speaking into
[50:18] our minds our hearts our lives
[50:20] and transforming us by his glory amen
[50:24] he'll search for you
[50:27] he'll seek for you hallelujah
[50:32] no wonder god is calling today
[50:35] out in the desert seeking seeking
[50:41] o my dear brothers sisters
[50:45] he's seeking for thee hallelujah
[50:49] oh gently revealing
[50:54] divinely calling
[50:57] o my dear loved ones oh come on
[51:01] to me jesus
[51:04] is calling jesus

[51:18] believer

[51:22] resurrection
[51:24] into this life this deeper life into
[51:27] which we are
[51:28] called to walk with god
[51:32] oh praise god he's calling you today
[51:37] jesus is calling jesus is calling
[51:41] praise god could it be you
[51:45] who are listening watching here today
[51:49] could it be that you are now
[51:53] recognizing

[52:01] us
[52:01] a spiritual realization
[52:06] of who he is who we are
[52:11] recognize his voice
[52:14] and answer his call
[52:18] jesus is still the living word
[52:21] and may that living word that proceeded
[52:25] out of this bible out of my life
[52:30] out of my heart and my human
[52:33] frail expressions somewhere
[52:37] in there that the great holy spirit
[52:41] will call you may god bless you my
[52:44] brothers and sisters

[53:05] for him

[53:10] off of fall's eyes and his eyes were
[53:13] opened to walk with god may your
[53:17] eyes be opened to walk with god
[53:21] to love him and serve him and to fulfill
[53:24] his divine will
