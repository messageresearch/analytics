[34:27] been you know I've been at Pastor
[34:28] Simon's side now for 30 years and I have
[34:33] witnessed
[34:35] Supernatural Beyond I could I could sit
[34:38] here and give testimony all night to how
[34:41] the power of God has moved through this
[34:44] ministry I heard things that were spoken
[34:47] from his lips and it pondered and it
[34:50] made me wonder when he would say things
[34:53] like we will have a building worth
[34:55] millions of dollars one day and today we
[34:58] sit in that very manifestation of the
[35:02] word of
[35:06] God at that time we couldn't see how but
[35:11] one thing that I knew was that we were
[35:14] serving a living God and that man and
[35:18] that woman had connected with the Living
[35:20] God and had found their purpose their
[35:23] plan and their will that God's will for
[35:26] their lives and I'm just so glad to be a
[35:29] part of it amen and I know that many of
[35:31] you have benefited from the visions and
[35:35] from the
[35:36] steadfast he stood against every enemy
[35:40] it didn't matter what they said he held
[35:43] to the word and the vision that God had
[35:45] given him amen praise God and so here we
[35:48] are at this time uh rejoicing and I I
[35:53] believe that yes it is a celebration but
[35:56] it's not a celebration of of
[35:58] retirement no sir this is a celebration
[36:03] of
[36:04] achievement amen glory to God when you
[36:08] stand with God God will stand with you
[36:11] and God will lift you up amen God will
[36:15] show and vindicate his word praise God

[39:43] man that has dedicated his life uh and

[39:50] and the true
[39:51] God um I have been
[39:55] fortunate uh to know him
[39:58] from teenage
[40:00] years um we kind of grew up
[40:03] together um he
[40:05] was around I think 15 years old when he
[40:08] started his teenage
[40:11] Ministry and I was about 11 12 years
[40:15] old and one day well himself and his
[40:19] sidekick by the name of Michael
[40:22] Patterson um you know they started this
[40:25] ministry uh at the street street
[40:28] corners and uh they were uh preaching
[40:32] there for the Assemblies of God at the
[40:34] time and these two fire Brands were um
[40:40] the Pioneers so to speak uh for the
[40:43] Street Ministry uh for uh Assemblies of
[40:46] God so one Saturday evening at that's
[40:49] the time that they would go out there at
[40:51] pit and Main
[40:52] Street and they would speak there and
[40:55] preach to the crowd
[40:57] that are passing by so one day uh one
[41:01] Saturday night I was
[41:02] passing about 11 years 12 years old with
[41:06] a friend and decided to stop and listen
[41:11] to this uh Teenage
[41:13] preacher and
[41:15] uh was captivated by the things that he
[41:19] was saying about God and and um I can
[41:22] still hear the words that he spoke that
[41:24] night and um
[41:28] as he was speaking and I asked made the
[41:30] altar call and raised my hand and I had
[41:35] my elbow rested on my friend's shoulder
[41:38] like that and I can still hear him say
[41:41] there is
[41:42] one uh raised his hand resting on the
[41:45] backbone of
[41:49] man you know
[41:51] so uh so from that night you know he
[41:54] invited me to the Assemblies of God
[41:56] Church I was a uh um
[42:00] Anglican uh I used to go to the Anglican
[42:03] Church the Anglican school at that
[42:06] time so went to
[42:08] the Assembly of God joined there and um
[42:12] for many years was there um I'll try to
[42:16] prey this uh
[42:19] conversation and uh long story short as
[42:22] they would say brought me into um
[42:26] knowing Jesus Christ
[42:27] as my personal savior at that time and
[42:31] after I was attending the Assemblies of
[42:34] God I
[42:36] um uh became a member there and he left
[42:40] to go down to the capital and was there
[42:43] in Bible school and uh that's where he
[42:46] met um brother R Jerry R if you many of
[42:50] you can remember him and he brought that
[42:53] message across to
[42:54] Guyana and um well after he started that
[42:58] he had his church on the west coast
[43:00] where he met his wife um and then he
[43:03] came back over to New Amsterdam to talk
[43:07] to his parents about himself getting
[43:10] married that's where he met me on the
[43:12] fairy Stelling because I was a porter at
[43:15] the time at the H the post office used
[43:18] to go and pick up
[43:19] meals so he met me there and I asked him
[43:22] I said what is this thing that I heard
[43:23] about you man that you left the church
[43:26] and uh you know know that you're
[43:28] preaching this false
[43:30] Doctrine so I uh so he said um you know
[43:35] this is what it is he said you know
[43:37] about the godhead they said yes I know
[43:39] God is tree and you know he's Father Son
[43:42] and Holy Ghost and um but you're you're
[43:45] talking about this one God and I don't
[43:47] understand that so he sat down there and
[43:50] uh right there on the fairy stilling me
[43:52] waiting for the males and explained the
[43:54] godhe to me I said but that is what I
[43:56] thought you believed
[43:57] anyway again long story short um I
[44:01] believe what he said um left the
[44:05] Assembly of
[44:06] God uh came back into the service that
[44:09] that Sunday because they heard that I
[44:11] had associated with him now and believe
[44:14] what he
[44:15] said so I purposely went to church to be
[44:19] read out you know cuz at that time you
[44:22] know they would really out the church so
[44:25] I purposely went there to read out the
[44:27] church so I was as the pastor was
[44:29] reading me out of the church I was
[44:31] smiling and happy as a clam as he would
[44:34] say you know left there and I think um
[44:37] at the time I was living with some
[44:39] friends and um that that situation
[44:43] wasn't good so when he came over I told
[44:45] him you know I'm looking for a place to
[44:47] get so he said uh come uh you know and
[44:51] he said my my my uh parents have you
[44:55] know their what we call bottom house
[44:57] house and they had a little structure
[44:59] under the house so it took me there to
[45:02] live with uh under that place and uh
[45:05] with his parents whom I came to know
[45:07] very well and his brothers became my
[45:10] brothers and we used to romp and play
[45:13] and fight you know just like real family
[45:17] and um but uh I had the honor of um
[45:22] burying both hisence uh when the time
[45:26] came um but uh you know he has been
[45:30] instrumental in my life after the time
[45:32] he left Guyana and came
[45:34] here um we connected back reconnected
[45:37] back
[45:38] after what 10 15 years about that at the
[45:42] convention in North
[45:44] Carolina and um from since then we've
[45:46] been in contact and uh here we are today
[45:49] so God bless you and um I want to thank
[45:52] him for the dedication that he has shown
[45:55] uh regardless of the
[45:57] trials and the tribulations that have
[45:59] been gone that he gone through while
[46:01] here but in any um message beli or
[46:06] any
[46:07] um any Minister that goes through these
[46:11] type of traumas and so forth in your
[46:13] church you know it only makes you
[46:15] stronger if you're true to the word so
[46:18] these challenges will come and you have
[46:21] faced many of them um with his
[46:23] leadership and I see how resilient uh
[46:26] you have been
[46:27] and it's a testimony tonight for what uh
[46:31] you know you have done in in the uh
[46:34] changing over of the Guard um and uh you

[46:40] they have put in here for these what 30

[56:38] Corinthians beautiful music
[56:41] tonight if you can't preach after that
[56:44] go back to Episcopalian
[56:48] Church 1 Corinthians chapter three we're
[56:50] going to start at verse
[56:53] 5 who then is Paul who is who is Apollos
[56:58] but ministers by whom you believe even
[57:01] as the lord gave to every man I have
[57:04] planted Apollo's watered God gave the
[57:06] increase so then there is he that
[57:08] planteth or neither he that WTH but God
[57:11] that gives the increase now he that
[57:13] planteth and he that WTH are one other
[57:15] words The Same
[57:17] Spirit and every man shall receive his
[57:19] own reward according to his own
[57:23] labor for we are labors together
[57:26] together with God and you all are God's
[57:30] husbandry you are God's Building
[57:33] according to the grace which is given
[57:34] unto me as a wise master builder I have
[57:37] laid the foundation and another builds
[57:41] thereon but be very careful how he
[57:45] builds there
[57:47] on for other Foundation can no man laid
[57:51] than that is laid which is Jesus
[57:55] Christ turn over a few pages to
[57:57] Ephesians chapter
[57:59] 4 one of our well all these are our
[58:02] favorite verses we're not going
[58:04] to distinguish Ephesians 4:11 says and
[58:09] he that's God gave some Apostles others
[58:13] prophets some evangelists some pastors
[58:16] some teachers what for for arguing I
[58:20] heard this and you're wrong and I'm
[58:22] right and you're not going no no for the
[58:25] perfecting
[58:27] of the Saints now in the Catholic Church
[58:29] how many people were catholic let's see
[58:30] your hand be
[58:31] honest yeah the Saints are on the other
[58:34] side according to them but this says
[58:36] perfecting of the Saints we're still
[58:38] here perfecting of the Saints for the
[58:40] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[58:42] the body of Christ and one other back to
[58:46] the left to
[58:47] Galatians this is a key verse that
[58:50] everybody should know by heart but this
[58:53] is where Paul had been in this area and
[58:56] had success and baptized a few people
[58:58] and he comes back a few months later and
[59:00] these people are already drifting
[59:02] listening to some other stuff and he
[59:05] says in verse 6 I Marvel that you're so
[59:07] soon removed from him that called you
[59:10] into the grace of Christ unto another
[59:12] gospel which is not another people but
[59:15] there be some people among you that
[59:17] trouble you and would pervert the gospel
[59:20] of Christ everything off the center line
[59:22] is a perversion amen and that's why why
[59:26] tonight we have our level with
[59:30] us anything on the sides of perversion
[59:33] we got to stick with the
[59:35] truth pervert the gospel of Christ but
[59:38] though we if me and Silas if John Simon
[59:42] William brandham anybody comes by or
[59:44] even an angel pops out of Heaven
[59:45] preaches any other gospel unto you than
[59:47] that which I've already preached to you
[59:48] by Revelation let him be a cursed that's
[59:51] straight to the hot place it's a one-way
[59:55] trip you see we don't like to make you
[59:57] wonder what I'm
[59:59] saying and he says again you know in
[1:00:02] case nobody was paying attention as we
[1:00:04] just said so say again if any man preach
[1:00:06] any of the Gospel unto you that when we
[1:00:08] have received let him be a
[1:00:11] cursed Heavenly Father we're thankful
[1:00:14] for your grace tonight we're thankful
[1:00:16] Lord that you brought each one of us

[1:02:00] contact and thankful that God sent him
[1:02:03] when he
[1:02:04] did so tonight we're going to speak on a
[1:02:08] subject Christians in
[1:02:11] progress see that picture up there
[1:02:14] you're in that
[1:02:16] picture so if you want to concentrate
[1:02:18] find yourself in that
[1:02:20] picture now whoever Dre the picture
[1:02:22] didn't know the message too well because
[1:02:23] there's not you don't see too many
[1:02:24] long-haired ladies there
[1:02:27] but that's where we're HD it amen now
[1:02:32] God has sent us a prophet we don't have
[1:02:33] to argue about
[1:02:35] that and he came not because he you know
[1:02:37] God didn't have anything better to do no
[1:02:39] he sent him in fulfillment of scripture
[1:02:43] amen
[1:02:45] amen and um The Promise was made by a
[1:02:49] prophet 400 years before Jesus ever
[1:02:52] showed up way back there behold send
[1:02:56] you most of us believe and are convinced
[1:03:00] that William bram's Ministry fulfilled
[1:03:03] those verses okay especially the second
[1:03:07] part of the prophecy spoken over 2400
[1:03:10] years
[1:03:12] ago and then we have the very words of
[1:03:14] Jesus over here in Matthew chapter 17
[1:03:18] you want to keep your Bible handy
[1:03:19] because we're going to have basically a
[1:03:22] Sunday school lesson today but in
[1:03:24] chapter 17 of Matthew Jesus been up on
[1:03:27] the mountain they saw Moses and Elijah
[1:03:30] and so they're coming down from the
[1:03:32] mountain and Peter of course he was
[1:03:34] always you know a promoter wanted to see
[1:03:36] things done right and everything and he
[1:03:38] wanted to build three Tabernacles and as
[1:03:41] they came down in verse 9 Jesus said now
[1:03:43] don't tell this Vision to anybody until
[1:03:45] the son of man is risen again from the
[1:03:47] dead so this is one of the many hints he
[1:03:51] gave them this isn't going to be nice
[1:03:53] and even the whole time son of man's
[1:03:54] going to be killed raised again he told
[1:03:56] them that many times they were a little
[1:03:58] bit thickheaded they weren't catching at
[1:03:59] all and his disciples asked him why then
[1:04:02] do the scribes say that Elias or Elijah
[1:04:05] must first come the Jews are taught from
[1:04:09] the crib up about
[1:04:11] Elijah they know Elijah is on the way
[1:04:15] okay and they've been teaching that and
[1:04:17] so Jesus said and them Elijah truly
[1:04:21] shall first come and restore all
[1:04:24] things future tense anybody can read
[1:04:27] that so if our friends that are out
[1:04:30] there you know watching TV and drinking
[1:04:33] whatever they're doing and they used to
[1:04:35] be sitting in the church if William
[1:04:37] Brand's Ministry doesn't
[1:04:40] fit this verse of
[1:04:43] Malachi Jesus himself said he's coming
[1:04:46] so guys instead of throwing rocks at our
[1:04:48] message go find him cuz he's
[1:04:51] coming like our brother said last night
[1:04:53] there's not much time better hurry
[1:04:57] so we're convinced that it
[1:04:59] is but you
[1:05:01] see we have an English Bible and we're
[1:05:04] thankful for it and I hope everybody's
[1:05:05] reading their Bible I hope some of you
[1:05:08] even have a scoffield Bible but you see
[1:05:10] the scoffield Bible is simply the fact
[1:05:13] that ski I think he was a lawyer but
[1:05:16] then he got to read he was reading the
[1:05:18] scripture he thought now there's got to
[1:05:19] be a way of of you know putting this
[1:05:21] together so he made all these notes all
[1:05:24] the references you see in the middle all
[1:05:25] the notes at the bottom all that was
[1:05:27] finished on January 1
[1:05:30] 1909 okay no
[1:05:32] computers pencil and paper and a few
[1:05:35] helpers okay so um this Bible is a true
[1:05:42] Masterpiece and when he studied here in
[1:05:44] Matthew
[1:05:46] 17 he wrote down here at the bottom
[1:05:49] these scriptures you can go read them
[1:05:50] later all these passages must be
[1:05:53] construed together Christ conf confirms
[1:05:56] the specific and still unfulfilled
[1:05:58] prophecy of Malachi 4:5
[1:06:00] and6 why didn't I see that when I was 17
[1:06:03] years old in the Baptist churchan it's
[1:06:05] been there all the time ever since 1909
[1:06:07] W he he saw that there's two Ministries
[1:06:12] there it just takes some discernment you
[1:06:15] know so this Bible is a true
[1:06:19] Masterpiece it's given by one
[1:06:23] author okay to 40
[1:06:27] writers now if we take 40 people out of
[1:06:30] these first benches here and give them
[1:06:31] an assignment they're not going to match
[1:06:34] I mean we're smart enough to know that
[1:06:37] but these 40 writers lived in three
[1:06:40] different continents spoke three
[1:06:42] languages didn't know each other mindly
[1:06:45] and it's over 1500
[1:06:47] years and none of it fights each other
[1:06:50] it's all God's
[1:06:53] word it's real okay
[1:06:56] and there's no contradictions and so now
[1:06:58] that we have computers they've you know
[1:07:01] got a lot smarter because progress you
[1:07:04] know and um now we know that there's
[1:07:08] 63,360 cross
[1:07:12] references says here oh it matches this
[1:07:14] over
[1:07:15] here nobody can write a book like that
[1:07:19] this is God's
[1:07:21] word and our Prophet said that this is
[1:07:24] God in written form form he also said
[1:07:27] you don't put
[1:07:29] anything I hope I don't see anything on
[1:07:32] top of your Bible not even my books he
[1:07:35] said so watch
[1:07:39] it okay just laying a foundation here
[1:07:43] preparing for tomorrow's
[1:07:46] service we'll leave you a little
[1:07:48] bit so this prophet he brought us a
[1:07:51] prophetic word here in Lea to prepare a
[1:07:54] bride for Jesus Christ okay and it's in
[1:07:57] our
[1:07:58] language people that speak English have
[1:08:01] no excuse
[1:08:02] whatsoever now the other countries they
[1:08:05] depend on translation and over 200 times
[1:08:08] he said back to the Bible because the
[1:08:12] original promise was I'm going to send
[1:08:13] you Elijah he going to turn your hearts
[1:08:15] back well is going to turn your hearts
[1:08:17] back to
[1:08:18] this and this has only been in print for
[1:08:20] just over 500 years we're very fortunate
[1:08:24] you know so his words spoken on over
[1:08:27] 1,200
[1:08:28] recordings um when they're repeated
[1:08:31] correctly or translated correctly can
[1:08:34] only hurt the unbeliever and the MB
[1:08:36] believer that's the ones that go to
[1:08:38] sleep that's the ones got to take three
[1:08:40] drinks of water and all that but the
[1:08:43] believer wants more you see and so uh
[1:08:48] these are the ones that are not going in
[1:08:49] the Rapture obviously so we're dealing
[1:08:51] with three kinds of Believers and I
[1:08:52] didn't make up the rules but brother Ram
[1:08:54] said that there's three kinds of
[1:08:55] Believers in every
[1:08:58] congregation that's very easy for you to
[1:09:00] sit there and you're you know North
[1:09:02] American judgmental way just like me and
[1:09:06] decide who is the believer and who's the
[1:09:09] unbeliever that's not important who are
[1:09:13] you
[1:09:14] okay exactly so um there is an order
[1:09:20] there's a progression remember
[1:09:21] Christians in progress even Peter said
[1:09:24] over here let go to Second Peter chapter
[1:09:26] 1 a very important scripture it's right
[1:09:30] before Hebrews I think here or right
[1:09:32] after Hebrews I'm sorry
[1:09:35] um where that um where we at here in
[1:09:39] First Peter second Peter chapter 1 where
[1:09:42] he says over here in verse 15 moreover
[1:09:44] Brethren I will endeavor I'm going to do
[1:09:47] my best that after I'm gone you might
[1:09:51] have these things always in remembrance
[1:09:53] so he's writing down his message that
[1:09:55] they can have and we can have it to
[1:09:57] still today you see why for we have not
[1:10:01] followed cunningly devised fables when
[1:10:03] we made known unto you the power and the
[1:10:05] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were
[1:10:08] eyewitnesses of his ministry yes so
[1:10:12] we've read those words quickly we've
[1:10:14] read them for years but guess what you
[1:10:16] have lived long enough to see the
[1:10:20] Fulfillment of the prophet's prophecy
[1:10:22] amen yes sir we today have have people
[1:10:25] among us I knew these people I ate with
[1:10:28] them I traveled with them they have
[1:10:31] devised these cunningly devised fables
[1:10:35] stuff that's not even true they make it
[1:10:37] up it's
[1:10:39] insane so we have to put up with that
[1:10:42] stuff okay so this prophet and his
[1:10:45] ministry they are a vital part of you
[1:10:49] know Ephesians 4:11 and
[1:10:51] 12 and there's Harmony between the five
[1:10:54] Ministries
[1:10:55] amen the prophet is in perfect harmony
[1:10:58] with the scripture because brother
[1:10:59] Brown's Ministry is the Amplified
[1:11:03] version of the Bible yes it and anybody
[1:11:06] that calls your a preacher Works in that
[1:11:09] same anointing that same
[1:11:12] Unity we don't have the Bible saying one
[1:11:14] thing and way over here that's what the
[1:11:16] man in Rome does and some of those
[1:11:18] people in Salt Lake they got the same
[1:11:20] Bible we have amen but they're not
[1:11:22] repeating it correctly they bring stuff
[1:11:24] out is not even true so the five
[1:11:27] Ministries work together there's Unity
[1:11:31] okay and so uh God gives us these five
[1:11:35] Ministries for our spiritual health our
[1:11:36] spiritual diet to stay
[1:11:40] balanced if anybody even thinks about
[1:11:42] going to
[1:11:44] sleep you'll hear that
[1:11:48] again I might leave it here I can buy
[1:11:50] another
[1:11:51] one sometimes I got a big one
[1:11:55] so let's move ahead here but our
[1:11:57] foundation is Galatians
[1:11:59] 1:8 he is the master builder now you can
[1:12:02] spend the rest of your life criticizing
[1:12:03] Paul and how sorry he was and how he
[1:12:05] killed grandma and all these things he
[1:12:07] did as a bad
[1:12:09] boy but God's grace can reach
[1:12:13] anybody it doesn't matter where you come
[1:12:15] from what you did if he can save Paul
[1:12:19] you can save
[1:12:21] anybody they made a movie a few years
[1:12:23] ago Paul Apostle Jesus Christ I was
[1:12:26] driving by the theater and said wow Paul
[1:12:28] that's interesting got up close wow
[1:12:30] Apostle so I went in and saw the movie
[1:12:33] yeah there's only five people in this
[1:12:35] whole
[1:12:37] theater I don't know how they got
[1:12:39] inspired to make the movie I took some
[1:12:40] other people in the had never been in a
[1:12:42] theater while they look see
[1:12:45] fun they come out crying because it's
[1:12:48] reality the scriptures coming
[1:12:50] alive brother BR says The Minister's job
[1:12:53] is to make Christ real to the
[1:12:55] people that's our job you know okay so
[1:13:00] the only worldwide Ministry for the
[1:13:01] Bride of Jesus Christ is the ministry of
[1:13:03] William Brandon nobody else that's
[1:13:05] that's what feeds the bride he was fully
[1:13:07] Vindicated and we're feeding on the
[1:13:09] Vindicated word that the god brings the
[1:13:12] blessing it's just that simple okay so
[1:13:15] God has a plan he's in charge of all the
[1:13:19] details not just today all the way to
[1:13:22] the end he knew you'd be here he knew
[1:13:25] what kind of shirt you was going to be
[1:13:27] wearing he he knows all this stuff so
[1:13:30] what you worried about he's going to
[1:13:32] make it work out you see so in charge of
[1:13:36] all the details and he's a god of
[1:13:39] precision you see now this this level
[1:13:42] probably cost me $10 and it's it's good
[1:13:44] enough but there's a man over there in
[1:13:47] the other side of Canada on St John's he
[1:13:50] works in some kind of Big Industry he
[1:13:53] says now the levels we have we don't
[1:13:55] slam those around cuz they cost
[1:13:57] $5,000 now that's Precision you see and
[1:14:01] so if you look at nature you know the
[1:14:04] Moon is is coming up
[1:14:06] later uh I think it's 12 days until it's
[1:14:09] a full moon again of course it's cloudy
[1:14:10] here you probably never hardly ever see
[1:14:12] the moon but every 28 days it's right
[1:14:15] there same size Precision you see and on
[1:14:20] April 8th some of you probably saw the
[1:14:22] eclipse I was in the path sure enough
[1:14:25] here it comes 2:30 3:00 in the afternoon
[1:14:28] it's all
[1:14:29] sunny I can see the stars amazing and
[1:14:33] they knew that they they predicted that
[1:14:34] way back there because it's precise you
[1:14:37] see and so the the orbits were crossing
[1:14:40] and so perfectly synchronized you know
[1:14:42] to the hour the minute the second to the
[1:14:46] microsc you know what a microsc is we we
[1:14:48] have the you know the clock we see the
[1:14:50] minutes we see the the seconds ticking
[1:14:53] but then when you take that second and
[1:14:56] you divide it into
[1:14:58] millions that's six
[1:15:00] zeros that's a
[1:15:03] microc and if you divide it into um nine
[1:15:07] zeros that's a billion that's a nanc and
[1:15:12] so we have science today that that they
[1:15:13] can do that kind of stuff God is that
[1:15:16] precise okay so God's Pro program is
[1:15:21] progressing now what I have right here
[1:15:24] you probably never r youve never seen
[1:15:25] this before this is a old old
[1:15:30] record very old there's metal in the
[1:15:33] middle plastic out here and when you buy
[1:15:35] this the man that bought it it's slick
[1:15:37] there's nothing on it so the machine you
[1:15:40] put the needle here and it spins out
[1:15:42] here and you got 5 and a half minutes
[1:15:44] you got to turn it over real quick you
[1:15:45] got another five and a half minutes here
[1:15:47] so this is one of 22 records a set that
[1:15:52] is the first message recorded of William
[1:15:54] Brandon W April the 12th 1947 faith is
[1:15:59] the substance this is one of the set I
[1:16:02] just brought to show you then
[1:16:04] later uh they got into the 7in
[1:16:07] recordings that most of you are familiar
[1:16:09] with and this is this is
[1:16:14] tape you know but it comes in two hours
[1:16:19] comes in three hours which means that
[1:16:21] you play for 30 minutes and you got to
[1:16:24] turn over and play the other 30 minutes
[1:16:27] of course every time they turn it over
[1:16:28] like that when they're recording they
[1:16:29] miss a few words you know and then
[1:16:31] there's a 90 minute which uh a 3H hour
[1:16:35] which is 90 minutes on each side well
[1:16:37] anyway brother Brandon you know realized
[1:16:38] hey you know I'm I'm very long- winded
[1:16:41] he said I want you boys to to help me
[1:16:43] out here so what they did they edited
[1:16:46] some of the messages now some of them
[1:16:48] are are just right this is in tement
[1:16:49] from
[1:16:53] 1957 now you remember the 45s that we
[1:16:56] used to buy like the old I bought some
[1:17:02] too I was young at one
[1:17:05] time now see what what a lot of you
[1:17:07] don't understand me and Reverend John
[1:17:09] are the exactly the same
[1:17:11] age yeah our mothers were happy at the
[1:17:14] same
[1:17:17] month but these are little records I
[1:17:19] think it's a set of 37 and it's it's uh
[1:17:23] I think it's 30 minutes on one side 30
[1:17:25] minutes plays at 16 RPM so it's just
[1:17:28] some of the history of the things that
[1:17:30] God has permitted that you know we have
[1:17:32] in the progress so um this um this word
[1:17:38] is only for serious
[1:17:39] Believers I'm not an Entertainer it's
[1:17:42] just come to speak the things that God
[1:17:44] put on my heart you see and so it's only
[1:17:46] for serious Believers this is not
[1:17:49] another
[1:17:50] religion you going everybody had to
[1:17:52] drive did anybody walk to church today
[1:17:54] yes no everybody drove so you came by
[1:17:57] many
[1:17:58] churches and those are religions those
[1:18:01] are perversions of the
[1:18:03] truth I mean I'm sorry but they they
[1:18:06] chose that route we didn't send them
[1:18:07] there and so
[1:18:10] um the
[1:18:12] um what we're following is God's
[1:18:15] word so when you when you run into a new
[1:18:18] person don't try to make him understand
[1:18:20] marriage and divorce don't try to make
[1:18:22] him understand what happened in the
[1:18:24] garden no that that's
[1:18:25] later first they got to come to
[1:18:28] scripture there's five comings of
[1:18:31] Elijah you know I've been to Israel many
[1:18:33] times and we never go to convert the
[1:18:37] Jews that's foolishness you know they
[1:18:40] are the people of the book they they
[1:18:42] know what their book says and so one
[1:18:46] time I was there and U I had one group
[1:18:49] finished on like Thursday the next
[1:18:50] group's going to show up on Monday so I
[1:18:52] stayed over and just you know sat on the
[1:18:54] beach and walked around well the guide
[1:18:57] we had do we have a time limit tonight
[1:19:01] sandwiches are ready right
[1:19:05] okay so the guide we had he was an older
[1:19:08] fellow about N9 years older than me he
[1:19:10] was retired but he loved his job guiding
[1:19:12] and he had some other retired people
[1:19:14] that he fellowshipped with so one day he
[1:19:16] says he go come with me we're going to
[1:19:17] go see these other retired people well
[1:19:19] some of these people are very
[1:19:20] intelligent and so we're in this house
[1:19:23] and the brother had a
[1:19:25] he had the the fellow we're visiting had
[1:19:27] a huge Library I mean just all kinds of
[1:19:30] books and so we're sitting there
[1:19:32] fellowshipping and I'm just listening
[1:19:34] because they're all talking Hebrew and
[1:19:37] so one of the ladies said now we
[1:19:38] understand or said Ruben is told us that
[1:19:41] your father-in-law is a prophet now can
[1:19:44] you tell us about that well now that you
[1:19:49] asked I said now surely in all these
[1:19:52] books you've got a Hebrew New Testament
[1:19:54] oh right here so they grabbed it out so
[1:19:56] we went to Matthew
[1:19:58] 17 and a few other places and I sat now
[1:20:01] look in your studies you all know that
[1:20:04] Elijah is coming oh yeah so there's five
[1:20:07] comings well they never heard of that
[1:20:09] you Elijah and Elisha and then here's
[1:20:12] John the Baptist which is in Malachi 3
[1:20:15] and we have one in Malachi 4 well they
[1:20:17] didn't know about that I said out of
[1:20:19] these five four is coming to you and one
[1:20:21] came to us oh really when's ours coming
[1:20:24] I don't
[1:20:25] know but any Jew that you talk to today
[1:20:28] that's serious they know the messiah's
[1:20:31] almost here yeah any day but first we're
[1:20:34] going to see Elijah Elijah will be two
[1:20:37] steps in front of him or right next to
[1:20:39] him but first we'll see Elijah see we
[1:20:41] didn't know that but so God has been
[1:20:44] merciful to us he sent us Elijah and the
[1:20:46] whole purpose was to bring us back to
[1:20:49] the original okay so I'm only a witness
[1:20:52] of the truth and I'm here to hold up the
[1:20:54] miror of the word so that you can see
[1:20:57] yourself now I've been in homes where
[1:20:59] you know the mirror is about here well
[1:21:01] it's kind of hard to comb your hair when
[1:21:03] the mirror's down here you know you like
[1:21:06] to look in the mirror don't you
[1:21:08] yeah and so this mirror doesn't need
[1:21:11] cleaning it's already clean it's perfect
[1:21:13] we just got to get it in the right
[1:21:15] position so you can see yourself you see
[1:21:17] that's our job and um we uh we want to
[1:21:21] see that God is working with you God
[1:21:24] knows what his program is and we want to
[1:21:27] see what needs fixing for all of us in
[1:21:29] order to come to the stature of perfect
[1:21:32] man now
[1:21:35] um Hebrews
[1:21:38] 138 is preceded by three Hebrews
[1:21:42] 13:7 see it goes together in my Bible
[1:21:45] and some Bibles it's got a semicolon
[1:21:46] there so those who brought the word to
[1:21:49] you Jesus Christ is you saw Jesus Christ
[1:21:51] the same yesterday to ever in whoever
[1:21:54] taught you and that should carry on we
[1:21:56] are the Hebrews 138 today you see that's
[1:21:59] not just brother R that's us today you
[1:22:01] know now in the beginning of the
[1:22:04] book um God met Moses and had him write
[1:22:09] the five books right pent talk we call
[1:22:11] it the five books of Moses and the Jews
[1:22:14] they meet every Saturday morning just
[1:22:16] like they did today over here someplace
[1:22:17] and all over the world and they have a
[1:22:20] portion of Moses that they read They're
[1:22:23] faithful to the text and they go on
[1:22:25] about their their worship and so he
[1:22:27] wrote the first five books and the Ten
[1:22:30] Commandments the law all by
[1:22:33] Revelation at the um end of the book God
[1:22:36] provided through John the Revelator the
[1:22:40] written word for the end of the world
[1:22:42] and
[1:22:43] Beyond that's why it says over here in r
[1:22:45] in Revelation 1 1 through3 the
[1:22:47] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:22:49] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[1:22:52] things which must surely come to pass
[1:22:54] and he sent and signify it by his Angel
[1:22:56] to his servant John Who Bore witness uh
[1:22:59] bore record of the word of God of the
[1:23:02] testimony of Jesus
[1:23:03] Christ and of all things that he saw
[1:23:06] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[1:23:09] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[1:23:11] those things which are written therein
[1:23:13] for the time is at hand amen this thing
[1:23:16] is about over amen this isn't going to
[1:23:19] go on and on and on it's it's got a it's
[1:23:22] got a point Okay so we got the in the
[1:23:25] front of the book we got Moses the back
[1:23:27] of the book we got John the Revelator
[1:23:29] but in the middle of the book The Bible
[1:23:30] says and the word became flesh and dwelt
[1:23:33] amongst us they never had it
[1:23:36] before but that was what happened there
[1:23:39] in the middle of the book
[1:23:41] okay and so that was something very
[1:23:43] special and it was prophesied by
[1:23:45] prophets throughout the Old Testament
[1:23:48] and being prophetic words they had to
[1:23:50] have a
[1:23:51] fulfillment centuries later 400 after
[1:23:55] the last uh Prophet but centuries later
[1:23:59] most people had forgotten most people
[1:24:01] couldn't read you know they had this
[1:24:04] Hebrew Bible only the priests could read
[1:24:06] it and so all these years later all
[1:24:09] those prophecies came to pass in a very
[1:24:12] small cave in a little village south of
[1:24:15] Jerusalem in
[1:24:17] Bethlehem MH which by interpretation is
[1:24:21] the house of God's bread so in Christ
[1:24:25] God was
[1:24:26] manifested
[1:24:27] entirely fullness of the godhead
[1:24:30] bodily now we're going to say things
[1:24:32] that you've already heard before maybe
[1:24:33] not in this order and I'm not going to
[1:24:35] go out there and debate with you just
[1:24:37] listen okay it's all in there okay so
[1:24:41] when we surrender and we're converted
[1:24:44] and Born Again of the spirit of God and
[1:24:47] then recognize our position in the body
[1:24:49] of Christ we are God manifested In the
[1:24:52] Flesh okay
[1:24:55] but by measure each one of us according
[1:24:57] to God's Amazing Grace it's like the
[1:24:59] ocean you know the entire ocean is
[1:25:01] anywhere from three and a half to 4%
[1:25:04] salt
[1:25:06] well Christ was the ocean we are a part
[1:25:09] of that okay and um some have a spoonful
[1:25:13] some have cup so forth brother Ram
[1:25:16] preaches he says now we in Christian
[1:25:18] church we have pennies we get nickels
[1:25:20] and dimes and quarters and half dollars
[1:25:22] and silver dollars it depends dep on how
[1:25:24] much you give how much you surrender
[1:25:27] that's why brother rand's Ministry was
[1:25:29] so great he surrendered all you know and
[1:25:33] um so Genesis 8:22 says After the flood
[1:25:38] you know God said while the Earth
[1:25:39] remaineth seed time and harvest cold and
[1:25:42] heat summer and winter dry uh what say
[1:25:46] and day and night shall not cease so
[1:25:48] there is an order there's a
[1:25:50] progress this man works with plants he
[1:25:52] sees the changes all the time you know
[1:25:56] and we see that Ecclesiastes 3 to
[1:25:58] everything there's a season and a time
[1:26:01] to every purpose under Heaven amen this
[1:26:04] is the time to sit and listen after a
[1:26:06] while the Lord tears we'll have
[1:26:08] something to eat after a while we're
[1:26:09] going to sleep so there's a time for
[1:26:11] each thing you see time to be born a
[1:26:14] time to die time to plant time to pluck
[1:26:17] up that which is planted so Christians
[1:26:20] in progress Christians are not perfect
[1:26:23] hate to tell you that
[1:26:26] but I had some grandchildren too my baby
[1:26:29] grandchild is about 63 now he's in Peru
[1:26:32] tonight but um when those little babies
[1:26:35] are born oh they're just so precious
[1:26:38] there's not another one in the whole
[1:26:39] Hospital you go down to the hospital and
[1:26:42] if you don't have one if you're just
[1:26:43] walking through well they all look the
[1:26:46] same
[1:26:47] you let's face it there's there's not a
[1:26:49] lot of
[1:26:50] characteristics but every grandparent
[1:26:53] you know but but
[1:26:55] um there's no Christians that are
[1:26:57] perfect but we are
[1:26:59] forgiven and we learn how to forgive you
[1:27:02] see so we're not here for anything less
[1:27:05] than to find out how to move forward how
[1:27:08] to get out of
[1:27:11] leosa suicide is not an
[1:27:14] option God will take you when he's ready
[1:27:16] for it he's not ready for you yet your
[1:27:19] mansion's not ready
[1:27:21] yet yeah so um
[1:27:24] we're uh we're in progress moving
[1:27:26] forward we have a destination am it's
[1:27:30] not the Border it's not home it's not
[1:27:32] your favorite pillow it's the Gate of
[1:27:34] the
[1:27:34] Resurrection we're headed to that that's
[1:27:37] why this picture is up here that's where
[1:27:38] we're going it's important you see and
[1:27:42] so now there's a message called a man
[1:27:44] running from the presence of the Lord uh
[1:27:46] February 17th of 65 you've probably
[1:27:49] heard it before but let me just give you
[1:27:50] a little uh a little history on that
[1:27:52] brother Brandon had been prom ing people
[1:27:54] he was going to come back to
[1:27:55] Jeffersonville and preach on marriage
[1:27:57] and divorce because a lot of people had
[1:28:00] you know I mean pastors know that my
[1:28:03] case is different you know you tell them
[1:28:05] to listen to the tape yeah but my case
[1:28:06] is different there's thousand
[1:28:10] variations and so they had it all set up
[1:28:13] to be back there for that what weekend
[1:28:16] of the um 18th of of February of 65 well
[1:28:20] the kids were in school and so he drove
[1:28:23] by himself
[1:28:25] yeah now he didn't spend time in motels
[1:28:27] the way we do he would drive when he got
[1:28:29] tired he'd pull over in the shade and
[1:28:31] take a power and hour for 20 minutes
[1:28:33] then keep going okay so he arrives back
[1:28:35] in Jeffersonville which is about 2,000
[1:28:37] kilometers he arrives back
[1:28:40] there uh sometime early Wednesday
[1:28:42] morning and churches until Thursday
[1:28:44] night so he thought well no since me
[1:28:47] sitting up here at the house by myself
[1:28:49] I'll uh I'll go down to church tonight
[1:28:51] and uh just you know be with the
[1:28:52] inspiration well soon as brother Neville
[1:28:55] saw him coming in Oh Brother Bill May
[1:28:59] well he he's got nothing he he he's
[1:29:01] ready for Thursday Friday Saturday and
[1:29:03] Sunday and um so okay comes up and he
[1:29:07] preaches this Mighty message a man
[1:29:08] running from the presence of the Lord
[1:29:10] and he says on there I believe we have
[1:29:12] truth I'm satisfied of that and I
[1:29:14] believe the shuck is absolutely pulling
[1:29:16] away from the wheat here back in 65 but
[1:29:20] the wheat has to lie in the presence of
[1:29:21] the sun to ripen and that's what we're
[1:29:24] here for friend to stay in the presence
[1:29:26] of the sun till our little group of
[1:29:29] people here become so ripe to Christ
[1:29:33] until it becomes Bread on his table see
[1:29:36] there's a there's a reason there's a a
[1:29:38] progress he says um that's what I want
[1:29:41] it to do so later in the same tape he
[1:29:44] says let the great Holy Spirit he's
[1:29:46] praying here let the great Holy Spirit
[1:29:48] Come that came down on the mountain the
[1:29:50] other day out there now saturate every
[1:29:52] heart in here with his goodness and
[1:29:54] mercy with understanding we realize
[1:29:57] father that's what we need is to
[1:29:59] understand for if we do not know what
[1:30:01] we're doing then how do we know how to
[1:30:03] do
[1:30:05] it great question wish I have thought of
[1:30:07] that he said but we must have
[1:30:09] understanding as Daniel said he had
[1:30:12] understanding by Prophet Jeremiah's
[1:30:13] writing and father we have understanding
[1:30:16] by the holy spirit's writing as he will
[1:30:18] reveal it to us in this hour so it's not
[1:30:21] immediate but it's Progressive as he
[1:30:24] will reveal it to us now if I could
[1:30:27] somehow prove to you that you know how
[1:30:30] thick the streets of gold are are they
[1:30:33] are they 10 cm or 20 or what I don't
[1:30:36] know it's only for those that get
[1:30:39] there and we're not going to be around
[1:30:41] there measuring oh something's wrong
[1:30:42] here no so don't worry about all those
[1:30:46] things my whole Christian life I've been
[1:30:48] around people that are worried about
[1:30:51] what's going to happen after the
[1:30:52] Rapture forget it it's only the people
[1:30:55] that get there the rest of you it's a
[1:30:57] waste of time you know so let's leave it
[1:31:01] alone but you see it's unfortunate but
[1:31:05] the truth of the matter is that many
[1:31:06] people are going to miss Heaven by a
[1:31:09] mere 18
[1:31:11] in now you know when you're going down
[1:31:13] these freeways over here at 110 miles
[1:31:16] kilometers per hour and and you're
[1:31:18] talking oh you missed the freeway you
[1:31:20] missed the exit by you know one minute
[1:31:24] but imagine missing Heaven by 18
[1:31:27] in that's the difference between your
[1:31:29] brain and your
[1:31:32] heart we can quote it and we can oh man
[1:31:35] we got it what about it being a
[1:31:39] reality you know I was over to the
[1:31:41] garden center today and got these plants
[1:31:43] these pots got the little thing on there
[1:31:45] it says you know this is going to be
[1:31:46] that and that well I just see green
[1:31:48] plants but he knows that this one is a
[1:31:51] real hot plant and this one's not as hot
[1:31:54] and this is a yellow rose or whatever
[1:31:56] but you see um we could argue about that
[1:32:00] let's wait till the fruit comes on let's
[1:32:02] see what we're really talking about no I
[1:32:05] can listen to anybody in their their
[1:32:07] their particular Revelation oh okay what
[1:32:10] kind of fruit do you have what what's
[1:32:12] the what's the manifestation of this
[1:32:14] great truth you're projecting some of it
[1:32:16] hasn't worked out you know so um uh you
[1:32:21] know the day after in the in the few
[1:32:23] days immediately days after the after
[1:32:24] the Rapture of the bride all the
[1:32:27] churches are going to be crowded with
[1:32:29] people because then it's going to hit
[1:32:32] them see uh back there with Noah that
[1:32:36] was a conspiracy
[1:32:38] theory it'll start raining oh he was
[1:32:41] right after all and then guess what oh
[1:32:45] please let us in but up to that point up
[1:32:47] to up until the rain started falling
[1:32:50] they threw eggs at the ark they threw
[1:32:51] potatoes they threw everything at the
[1:32:53] ark so here's all this trash and now the
[1:32:56] rain started and they W in but the the
[1:33:00] door's been shut for seven days too bad
[1:33:03] and that's what's going to happen right
[1:33:04] here in this church and everywhere else
[1:33:07] people that
[1:33:08] came didn't pay attention yeah yeah
[1:33:11] brother John's a great pastor and
[1:33:13] brother Danny boy he's he's got a lot of
[1:33:14] potential and blah blah blah what about
[1:33:17] getting with program what about really
[1:33:19] taking it in and becoming the Christian
[1:33:21] that we're talking about you know so
[1:33:24] it's going to get tough so like I said
[1:33:28] the message of William brandom is simply
[1:33:29] the Amplified version of the
[1:33:32] scripture if you want to make it
[1:33:34] something else well go ahead but that's
[1:33:37] the way that people can kind of
[1:33:38] understand what it's about and um uh as
[1:33:42] bride we have this love letter from
[1:33:44] Jesus Christ we have the right we have
[1:33:47] the luxury to read between the
[1:33:49] lines yeah but what you get from between
[1:33:52] the lines is got to be in Perfect
[1:33:54] Harmony in perfect balance with what's
[1:33:56] on the line it can't be something
[1:33:59] different that's right and that's why
[1:34:01] the five Ministries they work together
[1:34:03] in harmony now they may say it a little
[1:34:05] different you know but we're going to
[1:34:07] the same goal you know so it's important
[1:34:12] that we hear what the messenger had to
[1:34:13] say that's how the bride makes her ready
[1:34:16] they're in Revelations 197 and the bride
[1:34:19] has made herself ready by studying by
[1:34:23] listening that's that's how we get ready
[1:34:24] you see and um the um so we have Jesus
[1:34:29] Christ born in the house of God's bread
[1:34:31] and he himself said in John 6:35 I am
[1:34:34] the bread of life he that comes to me
[1:34:37] shall never hunger and he that actually
[1:34:39] believes shall never thirst so in Christ
[1:34:43] is the portion that satisfies the
[1:34:47] believer okay now you might not know but
[1:34:50] I've spent the last 50 years translating
[1:34:54] brother brenham's words in Spanish so
[1:34:56] that they can have that's why this man's
[1:34:57] sitting here today yes sir way back
[1:35:00] there when he wanted to hear William
[1:35:02] brand he was listening to me so that
[1:35:04] that goes on all over Latin America and
[1:35:06] so it's got to be
[1:35:08] exact now there's no such thing from
[1:35:10] some of you people are bilingual you
[1:35:12] know that there's no such thing as word
[1:35:15] for word translation that doesn't work
[1:35:18] it's not in the Bible it's nowhere it's
[1:35:20] the meaning it's this it's the phrase oh
[1:35:23] that's what you me
[1:35:25] I was in Israel with some some Nigerians
[1:35:27] uh several years ago these people have
[1:35:29] been in message for
[1:35:31] years and first of all they thought
[1:35:34] brother Neville was a black man I guess
[1:35:38] just from The Voice they never seen a
[1:35:40] picture and they had a lot of
[1:35:43] questions um they they wouldn't take
[1:35:45] communion at 2:00 in the afternoon when
[1:35:47] had our appointment with the with the
[1:35:49] garden tomb because brother brand said
[1:35:51] it's supper it's not lunch well fine you
[1:35:53] missed your opportunity but but you can
[1:35:55] get so nailed down on stuff let's open
[1:35:59] this thing up
[1:36:01] you okay so
[1:36:04] um the message was brought to restore us
[1:36:07] not just right to the scripture not just
[1:36:09] to the apostles Doctrine but all the way
[1:36:11] back to Eden amen that's where it was
[1:36:14] perfect you see so we do have the truth
[1:36:18] and in Christ is all you will ever need
[1:36:21] if you get into Christ you see even even
[1:36:24] Martin Luther said Christ Alone we don't
[1:36:28] need all this stuff we need Christ Alone
[1:36:30] we need the word alone see and so when
[1:36:34] when Martin Luther was reading over in
[1:36:36] Matthew in Romans 1:17 the just shall
[1:36:39] live by faith see he was he was studying
[1:36:41] to be a lawyer and God was tugging on
[1:36:44] his heart and so then he gets into the
[1:36:46] priesthood all there was only Catholic
[1:36:48] Church okay back then and so he he goes
[1:36:51] over there thinking he'll find peace
[1:36:52] well he had it's a busy mind look you're
[1:36:55] you're just a troublemaker go go over
[1:36:56] there and study scripture fine so he
[1:36:58] studies scripture you know and he found
[1:37:01] that the just shall live by faith and
[1:37:04] the light of Revelation turned on you
[1:37:06] know he came alive in Christ but you see
[1:37:09] when Paul was writing Romans uh 1 Paul
[1:37:13] was quoting from he from Haba 2:4 the
[1:37:16] just shall live by faith that's a cross
[1:37:19] reference see it's over here and he's
[1:37:21] saying it over here yeah
[1:37:24] so the only thing we need is Christ the
[1:37:27] word you see and the believer is secure
[1:37:32] with the anointed word of your hour now
[1:37:34] all this other is true look I got good
[1:37:37] friends they don't have anything good to
[1:37:38] say about Billy Graham well hello he's
[1:37:41] one of the three Messengers for starters
[1:37:43] he did his job now the fact that he
[1:37:46] never saw this message well it wasn't
[1:37:47] for him he had this over here to do he
[1:37:50] did his job right that's right
[1:37:53] somebody came to brother Brandon one
[1:37:55] time and they uh they had you know it
[1:37:57] was a bit of a competition back then
[1:37:59] because whoever could get there first
[1:38:00] with the news you know they might get a
[1:38:01] gold star get a shortcut into heaven or
[1:38:04] something and they came to tattle on Oh
[1:38:06] Billy Graham said or did something he
[1:38:08] said wait a minute if I can hold up my
[1:38:11] end as well as he's holding up his end
[1:38:13] everything will be okay so I believe now
[1:38:16] that we have people they're maxed out
[1:38:19] brother Chris is living the best he
[1:38:21] knows how he's living the message
[1:38:24] brother Danny's living the message the
[1:38:25] best he knows everybody's at their max
[1:38:27] level praise God we're going together
[1:38:33] so
[1:38:34] um in the message of uh Hebrews this is
[1:38:37] real important in the Hebrews message
[1:38:40] 1957 Jesus said in St John 5:24 he that
[1:38:43] heareth not he that shaketh or he that
[1:38:45] speaketh he that heareth my word and
[1:38:48] believes on him that sent me has eternal
[1:38:49] life and shall never never come to the
[1:38:52] judgment
[1:38:54] um but it's passed from death into life
[1:38:56] so it's your faith and your faith
[1:38:59] confessed by your lips only makes
[1:39:02] manifest to the people around you that
[1:39:03] you can hear in other words all these
[1:39:06] churches they're quoting out the same
[1:39:08] Bible okay so I can read and quote okay
[1:39:11] he says but your life is open before all
[1:39:14] so no matter how much you try to act
[1:39:16] like this or do that it never works it's
[1:39:19] got to be in you that's the kernel of
[1:39:21] the whole story your personal faith is
[1:39:23] in the resurrected Christ as your savior
[1:39:26] that he's at the right hand of God
[1:39:28] acting in your place this morning as
[1:39:30] you're acting in his place down here as
[1:39:32] a witness so bread is very important in
[1:39:37] you know our diet it's important for
[1:39:40] survival and it comes in many different
[1:39:42] shapes kinds and so forth and here in
[1:39:45] America we got you know all kinds of
[1:39:47] choices other countries not quite as
[1:39:49] many but before we can have bread on the
[1:39:51] table like we quoted a while ago
[1:39:54] there's a long
[1:39:55] process Gardener knows some of you
[1:39:57] people in farming maybe you know that we
[1:40:00] have the the preparing of the ground we
[1:40:02] got the planting of the seeds now west
[1:40:05] in Canada they plant sometimes with an
[1:40:08] airplane there huge tracks of land you
[1:40:11] know and so they plant the seeds and and
[1:40:14] so then they wait and see if it's going
[1:40:15] to come up and so comes up half an inch
[1:40:18] oh we got wheat no you got little green
[1:40:20] plants no wheat yet looks like wheat you
[1:40:23] know
[1:40:23] and so it grows and then of course
[1:40:26] eventually there's the harvesting the
[1:40:28] storing of the wheat and the greenery
[1:40:30] then eventually it goes to the mill and
[1:40:32] you got this white powder you still
[1:40:34] can't eat it it's useless you use it for
[1:40:36] wallpaper paste maybe so B then you got
[1:40:39] these good cooks that we have here and
[1:40:41] they know how to take that white powder
[1:40:44] and mix it with something good and
[1:40:47] eventually you got chocolate
[1:40:50] cake or we go on but
[1:40:54] that's
[1:40:55] later but from the little plants in the
[1:40:57] field to the bread on the table is a
[1:41:00] long difficult process okay and for the
[1:41:05] Christians it's a long difficult process
[1:41:09] from repentance at the cross to the
[1:41:12] picture on the wall it's a
[1:41:15] long but it's worth it amen prophet of
[1:41:19] God said whatever you do don't miss it
[1:41:22] am it's very very important so those
[1:41:25] little plants they grow and so you know
[1:41:29] there there is a goal there's a purpose
[1:41:30] to be useful to the master and during
[1:41:32] the gross cycle there's going to be
[1:41:34] trials tribulations fears doubts critics
[1:41:38] all kinds of stuff but he said there
[1:41:40] that's what we're here for friend to
[1:41:42] stay in the presence of the sun till our
[1:41:45] little group of people here becomes ripe
[1:41:48] to Christ becomes Bread on his
[1:41:51] table that's when you can
[1:41:54] retire this is not a retirement program
[1:41:56] well there's no retirement program in
[1:41:58] this Bible you're moving into a a little
[1:42:01] bit different
[1:42:04] responsibility I might be calling
[1:42:08] you so he's just changing you know
[1:42:11] dispensations we'll
[1:42:13] say but everything that happens to you
[1:42:15] in your journey is nothing less than the
[1:42:18] tender hand of
[1:42:20] Jehovah if he didn't care for you if he
[1:42:23] didn't care about you we wouldn't waste
[1:42:25] any time with you but he's watching you
[1:42:28] all the way through through this process
[1:42:30] and that's why it says over in Romans
[1:42:33] 8:28 we know how do we know because we
[1:42:36] read it because we believe
[1:42:38] it you know you've got a car out there
[1:42:41] unless something happens but you know
[1:42:44] and you know that it's going to start so
[1:42:46] we know that all things work together
[1:42:49] for good for good for those of love God
[1:42:54] and those are called according to his
[1:42:55] purpose and you can't fake either one of
[1:42:58] these okay got that straight so for
[1:43:02] plant growth wheat or anything else in
[1:43:04] the earth you got to have
[1:43:07] seed and you got to have the soil from
[1:43:09] the
[1:43:10] nutrients and um you got to have water
[1:43:13] and you got to have sunlight you take
[1:43:15] away you one of those four you have
[1:43:17] nothing you got a mess you see and so uh
[1:43:21] that will produce something of benefit
[1:43:23] for humans and other creatures and we
[1:43:26] must have all four so the most plants
[1:43:28] are started from seeds or cuttings of
[1:43:31] other plants correct correct correct
[1:43:34] okay got that straight so once the plant
[1:43:36] is
[1:43:37] growing uh there's going to be
[1:43:39] storms you know in your life that's
[1:43:42] that's to make you solid that's not to
[1:43:44] turn you over you know and make the
[1:43:47] roots go deeper and so with the little
[1:43:49] plants you know we have trials and
[1:43:51] tribulations and if if you can afford it
[1:43:55] he's got some plants over there that are
[1:43:56] you know in a nice size pot they're
[1:43:59] they're already you know half grown
[1:44:01] that's nice if you can afford it but
[1:44:03] it's more fun to see the plant grow but
[1:44:07] when we're raising children there are
[1:44:09] times that we wish that we could go from
[1:44:12] the hospital and somehow magic and and
[1:44:15] by the time we get them home there two
[1:44:16] years old well it doesn't work that way
[1:44:20] or maybe
[1:44:22] 12 no you got to go through the trials
[1:44:25] got to go through the long nights and
[1:44:27] everything I saw a cartoon the other day
[1:44:29] where this woman she had the new baby
[1:44:32] and everything and she uh said you know
[1:44:35] I'm going to sleep on this side of the
[1:44:36] bed tonight cuz from over here you can't
[1:44:38] hear the
[1:44:39] baby cuz he never heard
[1:44:42] it but that's just some of the things
[1:44:44] you know and um when I and you're going
[1:44:47] to face dangers you're going to face all
[1:44:48] kinds of
[1:44:50] Trials when I was young a long time ago
[1:44:53] uh I was facing the the the
[1:44:55] uncertainties and the dangers of War
[1:44:59] 1965 I had doubts and fears I just come
[1:45:02] through basic training in the Army I
[1:45:04] didn't know what they're going to do
[1:45:05] with me I mean all these other guys Bo
[1:45:08] they wanted to go kill people and run
[1:45:10] the tanks all that stuff I didn't know
[1:45:12] said Lord you know and so um I um I had
[1:45:17] a a few days a few moments on Saturday
[1:45:20] morning there at Thanksgiving in the
[1:45:22] shreport Louisiana
[1:45:23] with brother brandham and he simp simply
[1:45:26] said George don't worry footsteps of the
[1:45:28] righteous are order of the lord it's a
[1:45:31] foundational scripture you know Psalms
[1:45:35] 37:23 Jesus Says I Am With You Always
[1:45:38] even to the end of the world not just
[1:45:40] till Sunday not just till whatever no to
[1:45:42] the end of the world so to be
[1:45:45] useful we have to have experience which
[1:45:48] produces maturity okay so as you
[1:45:51] surrender he takes over he guides you
[1:45:54] guides every step Matthew 28:20 teaching
[1:45:58] them to observe all things whatsoever I
[1:46:00] have commanded you and lo I with you
[1:46:02] always even to the end of the world so
[1:46:04] you got nothing to worry about just feed
[1:46:07] your soul just like you you know we're
[1:46:10] not going to go hungry too far you know
[1:46:12] there's restaurants everywhere nobody's
[1:46:14] going to suffer well put about your soul
[1:46:17] you got to read the
[1:46:19] word you'd be surprised if people I run
[1:46:22] into that don't know the word I mean I
[1:46:26] deal what this lady just uh yesterday I
[1:46:29] said study the ladies of the Bible Well
[1:46:31] she goes over here in Acts and she finds
[1:46:33] Lydia wow didn't he know that was in the
[1:46:36] Bible well where you been these 40
[1:46:38] years study the word it feeds your soul
[1:46:43] okay okay now so we have to
[1:46:46] surrender in order for God to lead
[1:46:49] brother Brandman had to surrender get
[1:46:52] the people to believe you now he didn't
[1:46:54] have an education he barely made it to
[1:46:56] the seventh
[1:46:58] grade I'm sure you don't probably know
[1:47:00] anybody stopped at seventh grade but
[1:47:02] that's as far as he got way back there
[1:47:04] and um so so now he's preaching and he's
[1:47:07] young and he falls in love with this
[1:47:09] girl and so he goes on a little vacation
[1:47:11] up here to Michigan someplace and uh he
[1:47:14] found the Pentecost all of a sudden wow
[1:47:17] you know so they asked him to preach
[1:47:20] well you know the whole story so he goes
[1:47:22] home with this list of man that we want
[1:47:23] you over here cuz it was something they
[1:47:25] never heard before a young guy like that
[1:47:26] preaching like that so he goes home and
[1:47:30] U his wife says well bill I'll go yeah
[1:47:34] you bet but then when they face Grandma
[1:47:37] oh different story you're not taking my
[1:47:40] woman my my daughter out there you get
[1:47:43] back down that church and preach so
[1:47:46] William Brandon being young no
[1:47:48] experience he listened to
[1:47:50] mother-in-law and the world
[1:47:53] suffered in Jeffersonville today the
[1:47:56] Ohio river is one mile
[1:47:59] wide during the flood of January 1937 is
[1:48:02] 200 miles
[1:48:04] wide only God knows what all was swept
[1:48:06] away and brother Rand had to live with
[1:48:08] that stuff the rest of his
[1:48:10] life he should have done but he didn't
[1:48:14] well
[1:48:15] then God was dealing with him he was a
[1:48:19] man of the Wilderness he had that Elijah
[1:48:21] Ministry and that anointing and so he
[1:48:23] was going to go hunting and God would
[1:48:25] show him okay now you're going to see
[1:48:27] this kind of animal and you know
[1:48:30] squirrel's going to be there and all
[1:48:31] this kind of
[1:48:32] stuff and then when he was in the Pulpit
[1:48:35] the same voice would tell his name's
[1:48:37] John his name's Mary give him courage to
[1:48:40] know that he could speak that In Crowd
[1:48:42] of a thousand people more you know so it
[1:48:44] all worked together but he had to
[1:48:47] surrender he had to walk by faith even
[1:48:49] when he was going to preach the Seven
[1:48:51] Seals clear up in 63 been preaching for
[1:48:53] you know 30
[1:48:54] years and advertised and studied and
[1:48:58] everything but on the way to the pulpit
[1:49:00] he stops at Billy's office and he said
[1:49:02] now Billy if you ever talk prayed for
[1:49:04] daddy pray now I don't have any idea
[1:49:07] what we tell these
[1:49:08] people walk by faith now he knew who he
[1:49:12] was he had the assurance that God was
[1:49:14] with him but yet he had to walk by faith
[1:49:17] so as the wheat plant is growing it's
[1:49:20] green it's growing it struggles it
[1:49:22] pushes is but when the grain becomes
[1:49:25] mature you know in July um the struggle
[1:49:29] is over you can just bow its head and
[1:49:32] here comes a combine and that's what's
[1:49:35] coming now the combine's coming so
[1:49:38] you've had plenty of years of teaching
[1:49:40] and
[1:49:40] preaching and now the combine's coming
[1:49:43] you better be ready you know so when
[1:49:46] Jesus was in Gethsemane he knew who he
[1:49:49] was there's no doubt he didn't want to
[1:49:53] die you know he said not my will but
[1:49:56] thine but if this cup could pass oh you
[1:49:59] know all he could do is bow his head and
[1:50:02] surrender and so that's what we're doing
[1:50:05] now we're waiting for the combine it's
[1:50:07] on the way it's already cranked up it's
[1:50:11] coming you better be
[1:50:14] ready Psalm
[1:50:16] 46:10 be still I'm God I got to figure
[1:50:19] it out don't need your opinions don't
[1:50:21] need your ideas all your calculations
[1:50:23] all your quotes
[1:50:26] just
[1:50:28] coming Ephesians 6:13 wherefor take unto
[1:50:31] you the whole armor of God that you may
[1:50:33] be able to withand in the evil day and
[1:50:35] having done all just stand we don't have
[1:50:39] to have an answer for all those crazy
[1:50:40] people amen if they want to blast their
[1:50:43] head off and all the stuff they want to
[1:50:46] say they're just digging their hole
[1:50:48] deeper every day no just stand steady
[1:50:51] okay amen so the believer comes to a to
[1:50:54] a maturity through a process and then
[1:50:56] you will be useful to the master in the
[1:50:59] New Testament he said tear ye in the
[1:51:01] city of Jerusalem until you be endued
[1:51:04] with power from on high how long until
[1:51:08] he didn't tell him 10 days he didn't
[1:51:10] tell um what's the name Abraham it's
[1:51:13] going to be 25 years no see we as humans
[1:51:17] we're placed on a free moral agency he
[1:51:19] gives the command then you all decide
[1:51:22] you know we have that choice and so we
[1:51:25] make decisions and many times we fail to
[1:51:28] seek God for those decisions
[1:51:32] now um 65 years ago this week brother
[1:51:36] br's preaching over in
[1:51:38] Chicago and the time came for Abraham
[1:51:41] the great patriarch and servant of God
[1:51:42] to make a decision you see God doesn't
[1:51:45] make all of our decisions and there's
[1:51:48] many times that God doesn't tell His
[1:51:49] prophets just what to do
[1:51:52] because they have to make the decision
[1:51:55] if there's no decision that we have to
[1:51:57] make uh and just wait on God for every
[1:52:00] move then there's no overcoming on our
[1:52:03] part that's good for all of us and
[1:52:06] sometimes they make the wrong decision
[1:52:09] now these are his words God's anointed
[1:52:12] prophets make the wrong decisions and
[1:52:14] many times are
[1:52:16] deceived all this is telling you is
[1:52:19] they're
[1:52:21] humans they're humans
[1:52:24] I mean Abraham received the
[1:52:26] promise and you know time's ticking hey
[1:52:30] Sarah well
[1:52:32] nothing same old story every month well
[1:52:35] then in the meantime he had brought her
[1:52:37] this beautiful Egyptian maid so she's
[1:52:41] Ming the floor she's doing all the work
[1:52:43] now Abraham you know he told him she
[1:52:45] told him one night now look
[1:52:47] Abraham you brought me this girl now
[1:52:49] this probably is God's program because
[1:52:52] you know she's a beautiful girl she's
[1:52:53] bearing age here I am look at me he said
[1:52:56] well he was human well okay and from
[1:53:01] that day till this we've got problems in
[1:53:03] the Middle East that's why because
[1:53:07] Abraham listened to his
[1:53:10] wife
[1:53:13] right so we have the clear word of God
[1:53:17] in 2 Corinthians 6 wherefore come out
[1:53:19] from among them be you separate sayith
[1:53:21] the Lord touch not the unclean thing I
[1:53:23] will receive you and will be a father
[1:53:25] unto you and you shall be my sons and
[1:53:27] daughters sayith the Lord Almighty
[1:53:30] having therefore these promises right
[1:53:32] here let us cleanse ourselves from all
[1:53:34] filthiness s of Flesh and spirit
[1:53:37] perfecting Holiness in the fear of God
[1:53:40] fear of God this is his word feed your
[1:53:44] soul you'll be on the right path so in
[1:53:47] other words maturity is achieved
[1:53:50] progressively we don't have instant
[1:53:52] children I mean even when they get to 19
[1:53:55] and 20 and still in college what are you
[1:53:57] guys
[1:53:59] thinking they they eventually come oh
[1:54:01] yeah Dad's right well it takes time you
[1:54:03] know so it's not
[1:54:05] instantly and so this maturity is one of
[1:54:08] the benefits of being subject to the
[1:54:10] ministry as Paul wrote in Ephesians 4
[1:54:13] God placed these vital Ministries in the
[1:54:15] body for the perfecting of the
[1:54:18] Saints don't come here thinking you're
[1:54:20] doing Danny a favor about coming here
[1:54:22] showing up and putting $100 you're not
[1:54:25] doing any
[1:54:26] favors you're doing favor when oh yes
[1:54:30] sir you're right and you start to see
[1:54:32] the the flower blooming out you know so
[1:54:36] um for the perfecting of the Saints so
[1:54:38] it's not just listening to the prophet
[1:54:40] or the pastor but all five for a
[1:54:42] balanced
[1:54:44] diet if you don't believe me when you go
[1:54:46] out here tonight you watch how people
[1:54:48] pick up stuff they don't just pick up
[1:54:51] sandwich and to drink no they they want
[1:54:53] a little bit of
[1:54:55] variety we had a great variety at
[1:54:57] breakfast I mean so much
[1:55:00] that poor people India starving here we
[1:55:03] are throwing food
[1:55:05] away but anyway we got through it um so
[1:55:09] for thousands of years the Jews have
[1:55:11] been quoting Moses perfectly but they
[1:55:13] failed to recognize the manifestation of
[1:55:15] those promises right it's one thing to
[1:55:18] read and repeat but hey wake up it's
[1:55:21] coming to pass you know you know and um
[1:55:24] they were blinded for our benefit don't
[1:55:27] feel bad at them they could not help it
[1:55:30] you listen to the brother Ram he'll tell
[1:55:31] you you know so go home and read Romans
[1:55:34] 9:10 111 it was for a
[1:55:37] purpose you see so the Christian Life
[1:55:40] does not take us to a sinless perfection
[1:55:42] in this body I don't care how much
[1:55:44] vitamins you take how much broccoli you
[1:55:46] eat I mean brother Bob he Bo's
[1:55:50] sharp eats right
[1:55:53] but guess what there's a line in the
[1:55:54] road you won't go past that line that's
[1:55:57] right yeah so we don't come to to
[1:56:00] Perfection this body we live among
[1:56:03] Sinners but we don't conform to their
[1:56:06] ways now I know people that wouldn't go
[1:56:08] to the mall they wouldn't go to the
[1:56:09] beach they're just going to live in
[1:56:11] their little cocoon and live their
[1:56:13] little Christian Life well there's no
[1:56:15] scripture for that we where the
[1:56:17] Christians we can go any place I mean if
[1:56:20] you're not going to see any bad women
[1:56:21] you better just stay in the bedroom
[1:56:22] because they're
[1:56:24] everywhere I mean they I don't know if
[1:56:26] you go to the airports but man the
[1:56:28] airports they come through with pajamas
[1:56:29] and not pajamas and all kinds of crazy
[1:56:31] stuff you know but um no we we have to
[1:56:36] be a part of this thing um our desires
[1:56:39] to God to his word to his Spirit brother
[1:56:42] Ram says you'll have trouble with this
[1:56:43] flesh until the day he calls you home so
[1:56:46] whatever you however perfect life you
[1:56:49] have you're going to have trouble it's
[1:56:50] not going to go away today we're
[1:56:52] speaking about maturity ripeness bread
[1:56:54] on the table and the combine is coming
[1:56:58] there's no more time for struggling just
[1:57:00] get ready okay and um we're living in
[1:57:04] the time of the Fulfillment of the
[1:57:06] prophet's prophecy and uh it's not going
[1:57:09] to be you know uh usually it's not
[1:57:13] immediate but it's always right on time
[1:57:17] God is very patient step by step uh
[1:57:20] we're
[1:57:21] actually just imagine we're exiting
[1:57:23] we're on the way out and the building is
[1:57:24] crumbling behind us it's already
[1:57:27] starting to crumble as we leave there's
[1:57:29] no
[1:57:30] repair you know FEMA is not going to
[1:57:33] help no nobody's going to help so we
[1:57:35] have many promises and evidences of the
[1:57:39] um the better life that lies ahead for
[1:57:41] us and uh it's not make believe it's
[1:57:43] more real than sitting here yes you
[1:57:46] think you're real and you got your nice
[1:57:47] suit on but guess what it's more real
[1:57:49] than that yeah and so
[1:57:52] uh many times we've rehearsed the scene
[1:57:54] of Abraham and Sarah you know out there
[1:57:57] under the oak tree
[1:57:59] remember guess what the oak Tre is still
[1:58:01] there when I was there in 1984 it still
[1:58:04] had green leaves on it and they've got
[1:58:07] history of 5,000 years those people are
[1:58:10] really they've been watching that thing
[1:58:12] it's still there so they were living
[1:58:14] under the oak tree and um out there
[1:58:17] south of Bethlehem and they were
[1:58:19] actually turned back young in their
[1:58:21] flesh to have the child God can do
[1:58:25] anything
[1:58:27] anything we all have
[1:58:30] testimonies there's a man sitting in
[1:58:32] prison down in
[1:58:34] Colorado and he's known as El
[1:58:36] Chapo a bad boy I mean he look he made
[1:58:40] Al Capone look good you know but God has
[1:58:43] reached him he's perfect peace life in
[1:58:46] prison okay no problem you know only
[1:58:50] thing he hadn't been baptized well a lot
[1:58:51] of people weren't baptized
[1:58:53] but U God can forgive he can change
[1:58:55] anybody's life you
[1:58:58] see brother R says he showed in Abraham
[1:59:00] and Sarah what he's going to do to you
[1:59:02] and your wife one of these
[1:59:04] days yeah Brooks it going to make you
[1:59:06] younger here wow
[1:59:11] sharp you and your wife one of these
[1:59:14] days turn you back young again we're on
[1:59:16] the seed we what we're the Seed of
[1:59:18] Abraham on our road to the
[1:59:21] promise M's are already over there
[1:59:23] waiting for me she's already perfected
[1:59:25] she's waiting for me when she was sick
[1:59:28] way back in 2004 back in there uh I
[1:59:32] could see she was getting you know the
[1:59:34] doctors wern't helping all these pills
[1:59:36] and everything wasn't helping and so um
[1:59:40] the Lord took her in uh November of
[1:59:44] 2006 but prior to that month or so prior
[1:59:48] we had a a sister from another state
[1:59:50] called us and she said you know I was
[1:59:52] sitting there at lunch today and right
[1:59:54] there there's a vision he said and there
[1:59:57] was brother brand preaching to this big
[1:59:59] bunch of people and their prayer line
[2:00:01] everything he's preaching Faith he says
[2:00:04] and you little sister thank you for
[2:00:06] praying for my daughter
[2:00:07] Rebecca and tell George not to worry
[2:00:11] everything's going to be okay well then
[2:00:14] I'm not going to worry it's not going to
[2:00:15] turn out the way I want probably but I I
[2:00:18] I told her in those days long there I
[2:00:20] said now look you know that God can can
[2:00:22] raise you up make you brand new in the
[2:00:24] next 20 minutes because she lived 19
[2:00:26] years with William Brown she knew what
[2:00:27] faith was she knew what healing was all
[2:00:29] these Miracles and everything and I said
[2:00:32] but if he chooses to take you then you
[2:00:35] get with your dad and wait for me there
[2:00:37] okay so the Lord took her well um two or
[2:00:42] three years ago a brother called me uh
[2:00:44] that I know in Mexico he speaks Spanish
[2:00:48] and um he said I had this dream he said
[2:00:51] I was in heaven
[2:00:53] and I was I was right there I was
[2:00:54] talking to brother Brandon we were
[2:00:55] talking about things you know current
[2:00:56] things and um and he said uh and I
[2:00:59] noticed on on brother bram's side on his
[2:01:02] arm was this girl I'm looking at her ah
[2:01:05] it's Rebecca yeah young Rebecca and so
[2:01:08] she smiled at him and she said you tell
[2:01:11] George I'm right where he told me to
[2:01:15] wait it's
[2:01:19] real so Hall
[2:01:22] remember we quoted from John from
[2:01:24] Genesis 8:22 while the Earth remaineth
[2:01:27] see this this is a progress It's going
[2:01:28] to remain for a while so God has an
[2:01:31] order Sun you know large burning fire
[2:01:35] out there we can't even imagine but God
[2:01:38] has put the Earth in exact
[2:01:40] position if it was any farther it freeze
[2:01:43] it's any closer it burn you know so
[2:01:46] there's that big burning fire and our
[2:01:47] little planet here is in precisely the
[2:01:50] right distance and it goes around every
[2:01:53] 365 days around that sun it's not around
[2:01:57] it's kind of a egg shape and we have a
[2:02:00] moon that's going around our sun around
[2:02:02] our Earth all that's precise you know so
[2:02:06] the the Sun out there is so
[2:02:08] large that you could put a million
[2:02:11] Earths in the sun that's how large that
[2:02:14] thing is it's huge but God has it all
[2:02:18] figured out you see and um uh so maybe
[2:02:23] we're not so important after all maybe
[2:02:25] we're not so indispensable as we think
[2:02:27] we are we're just little creatures on a
[2:02:29] little blue planet out
[2:02:31] here God's in control you see and so God
[2:02:37] Says by his prophet in Isaiah 49:16 I
[2:02:39] have Graven thee upon the palms of my
[2:02:43] hands if you had a magnifying glass and
[2:02:46] you look at all those little lines in
[2:02:47] your hand God's got all the names in
[2:02:50] there
[2:02:52] Isaiah
[2:02:55] 49:16 God knows what he's doing he
[2:02:58] doesn't need our thinking where we got a
[2:03:00] chicken brain by
[2:03:01] comparison nothing you know okay let's
[2:03:05] see if we can wind this up on the second
[2:03:07] Miracle right over here in Erie
[2:03:08] Pennsylvania 51 this is the way heaven
[2:03:11] will be now either brother Ram knew what
[2:03:13] he was talking about or it's like Walt
[2:03:15] Disney one of the two this is the way
[2:03:18] heaven will be there's going to be
[2:03:20] Germans and fins Italians
[2:03:22] Irish
[2:03:24] Mexican Nigerians El Salvador they're
[2:03:28] they're all going to be there
[2:03:31] yeah um some morning when this Mortal
[2:03:33] life is all over the sun will be set for
[2:03:35] its last time this old Earth will be
[2:03:38] blowned into bits maybe 500 years from
[2:03:41] tonight let's draw a picture now
[2:03:43] mentally 500 years from tonight now you
[2:03:46] see we think 500 years a long time no
[2:03:50] 500 years back here was Martin Luther
[2:03:53] Christopher Columbus it's just you know
[2:03:55] back there so 500 years out here you
[2:03:58] know he's drawing the picture I hear the
[2:04:00] winds howling I look at the Earth it's
[2:04:02] out of its orbit atomic bombs have
[2:04:04] thrown her out of her orbit Yonder She
[2:04:07] lays towards the sun she's whirling fast
[2:04:09] the suns are blowing the sun is blowing
[2:04:12] the winds are blowing there's not a
[2:04:13] living thing on Earth the Sands are
[2:04:15] blowing across howling many times
[2:04:18] thousands times Fahrenheit of heat
[2:04:20] laying against the Earth see it wouldn't
[2:04:23] take much got a little bit closer it
[2:04:25] burn and so no more water fire this time
[2:04:29] what do I see sticking up out of the
[2:04:30] sand over there oh it's a tombstone
[2:04:32] somebody's name is on it there they may
[2:04:35] be sitting in the meeting tonight
[2:04:37] where's your soul then friend if you're
[2:04:38] not right with
[2:04:40] God then let's draw a little farther out
[2:04:43] I see God bringing it back into his
[2:04:45] orbit again she's reinhabited the wolf
[2:04:49] and the lamb shall feed together as see
[2:04:51] a Beautiful Dawn a Tropic like the
[2:04:53] Orient big palm trees beautiful birds
[2:04:56] singing I come and look walking down
[2:04:59] through the garden over there the white
[2:05:00] doves are flying from tree to tree
[2:05:03] what's approaching it's the one that's
[2:05:05] going to sit on David's throne and his
[2:05:07] white robe is moving
[2:05:10] along I want to stand along there don't
[2:05:13] you may just be possible the tears come
[2:05:16] down and run my cheeks running down my
[2:05:18] cheeks while he passes by and I look at
[2:05:20] him and I say there's the lovely one
[2:05:22] that redeemed me when the Great supper
[2:05:24] is
[2:05:25] set and there were all seated around the
[2:05:28] tables at the wedding supper I'll look
[2:05:31] across the table and I'll say I
[2:05:33] recognize him he's from Finland or he's
[2:05:35] from Niagara wherever you know I
[2:05:38] recognize him I'll reach across the
[2:05:39] table take you by the hand we'll just
[2:05:42] have to shed a few tears then the first
[2:05:44] thing you know the king comes walking
[2:05:46] out in all his
[2:05:47] Beauty he'll take his hands wipe the
[2:05:50] tears from our eyes put his arm around
[2:05:52] us and say don't cry now it's all over
[2:05:55] No more healing Services no more hot
[2:05:57] nights No More Tears no more wheel
[2:05:59] chairs no more crutches it'll all be
[2:06:01] over entering into the joys of the
[2:06:04] Lord that's what this picture is all
[2:06:06] about thank you Lord that's where we're
[2:06:09] headed don't miss it let's Stand
[2:06:11] Together the musicians please come
[2:06:14] up and one of the reasons that we have
[2:06:17] confusion and divisions amongst
[2:06:20] believers
[2:06:22] we're in the age of perfection coming up
[2:06:24] to Perfection you know and we're coming
[2:06:27] up to maturity and we're looking at each
[2:06:29] other no take care of
[2:06:32] yourself get ready yourself amen we
[2:06:35] should be looking in the mirror of God's
[2:06:37] word so let's think on this as we
