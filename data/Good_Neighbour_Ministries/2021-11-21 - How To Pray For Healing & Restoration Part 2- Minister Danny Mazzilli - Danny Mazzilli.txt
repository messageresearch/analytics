service amen praise god we're so grateful to be in the house of the lord this morning once again how many have been enjoying these uh 40 days of prayer and just finding your lives you know just building some momentum feeling that anointing around your life you know you cannot walk with somebody um every single day you know and be in constant communication with that person and not feel them around you and not sense them you know especially the lord right you know you're catching their thoughts their minds you know you just think about it when you're at work you know your work with the same people all the time you're constantly communicating they're telling you more and more about their lives you're getting to know they're getting to know you more and more well that's what your relationship with the lord is all about and and you know over the years i know you think well you know brother i've been walking with the lord for 25 years or 30 years or whatever i don't care how long you've been walking with the lord i know for a fact that you are still in this world and you will get distracted and you will get sideswiped and you will get hurt and you will have heartache and you will find yourself in tribulation and situations that you never thought that you would find yourself in even after walking with the lord for so many years and the only thing that you've got is your contact and relationship with the lord he is the only one that can fix any problem that you might have amen praise god forevermore and that's you know today we're going to be looking at how to pray for healing and restoration uh let's just have a word of prayer before we do that we'll read the scripture father we are so thankful this morning lord that we can be here father and that we can know that you are present lord you said where two or more would gather lord here there's probably 70 80 people father under expectation in need of healing in need of restoration in need of you father to come lord even tomorrow we we we need intervention father lord but we are trusting and believing in that relationship that you started you called you authored and now you said i will finish and all we've got to do is surrender ourselves yield ourselves and do what we know we can do father grant it now lord remember all the needs in our midst father remember to continue to strengthen our pastor as he rests at this time lord his home is family father may you just just take control now bless speaker bless hearer we welcome you great jehovah god who is jehovah jireh our provider granted we pray in jesus name amen praise god and so um we'll look at our scripture first slide you're going to need to follow me here on the slides because we're going to be going through a lot of slides okay and the first slide says if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then i will hear from heaven and i will forgive their sins and i will heal their land god bless you you may be seated i want to do a quick review of um part one um a few weeks ago we were looking at uh the different things and the first thing is next slide it's that we have to admit that we are not in control as much listen this relationship is with with the almighty god the creator of heaven and earth and he has given us his ability to to to communicate and to receive his thoughts so we are like a channel here on this earth we've been given that ability so whatever happens in us and through us it's god working through us god in us your hope of glory amen so so next slide it says if my people will humble themselves and we looked at humility and so next slide we looked at some of the thoughts look at this uh you know here brother brown speaking look at the seraphim woman when when she was told by jesus it's not right for me to take the children's bread and feed you dogs what would you have said if he had called you a dog you'd have said i'll join the next church but not her she knew who she was talking to she said lord that's right you're so right in that but the dogs is willing to eat the scraps under the master's table that got him that was it that's what he's waiting for you to do humble yourself into such a place no matter how god sends it to you if you're healed instantly if you're healed by degrees if if you're put off for like abraham was for 25 years oh glory to god amen hallelujah waiting for the promise but instead of getting weak he got stronger all the time giving praise to god just so that you know that god promised it and you accept it for yourself to not it's not to come to pass just remember now as i go on record in these tapes i say this with all my heart that if any persons will take the right mental attitude towards any divine promise that god has made it will come to pass amen praise god you see it's it's humbling yourself before the lord it's recognizing that that you're that you're dealing with an awesome god amen we don't approach him like you know like some you know hey father like you know you gotta do this for me today we don't approach him with pride oh i did this and i did that and i did this lord and i went to church 74 times this year that's pride that's not going to catch his attention let's look at a few of the things that we looked at just briefly next slide confess your sin the moment you realize it this is this is attributes of humility you know humility is forgiving quickly you don't hold on to things if god has forgiven you like you just got to look back on your own life and see what god did for you and he forgave you for things that you don't even want to talk about anymore but yet you want to hold something on somebody you don't want to let go and believe that god can heal the whole situation and restore that's what we're looking at today we want to see what god can do to restore heal and i know you got lots of things in your life because i got lots in mine don't tell me oh i'm okay i'm fine no you need healing you need restoration this morning when you treat when you're treated unfairly be quiet patient and don't retaliate when you look for ways to serve others and not yourself all the time humility is being respectful to the authorities in your life good or bad good or bad humility is picking up the trash whenever you see it if you're walking downstairs or you're walking through this church and there's something on the floor in front of you you pick it up it just shows that you care about the house of the lord that you know that this is his house and that you show respect that's all it is amen praise god humility is admitting your weaknesses and sin to a few safe people that you trust so that you can pray together amen praise god humility is always speaking well of others always always no matter what no matter how many things you might see nine things that are wrong with that person encourage them with the one that's good amen it's for your good yes humility is praying for your enemies humility is not thinking less of yourself well i'm no good you know oh poor old me well you know well you know i don't think that um uh you know i i really deserve this you know this inheritance right here uncle sam you know i mean i don't think you know like what are you trying to do you're trying to put on humility you can't do that with god humility is something that you that you just are you just decided that i'm not gonna think about myself humility is not thinking less of yourself but thinking of yourself less and putting others first and looking to do what's best next slide and so if i'm humble god will guide me next slide god leads the humble in the right way and teaches them his will so in other words if you're humble god will guide you god will show you what you need god will show you what to do amen he will guide you psalms 25 9 next slide if i'm humble god will bless me next slide it says i will bless those who have humble and contrite hearts isaiah 66 2. next slide if i am humble god will give me the power to change his grace is what changes us that's the power of god that's when god intervenes in your life when you don't deserve it but because you're humble because you're you're waiting on the lord you're patiently waiting on your brothers and your sisters you're you're you're you know you're you're mindful all those things then his grace comes because you're projecting love into every situation not yourself but love next slide god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble james 4 6 so if i am humble next slide god will relieve my stress that one really blessed me amen praise god you know when you really trust god when you really know that you're not in control that you've that you've settled it that lord i am i i am gonna let your will be done i don't care how long it waits i gotta wait i don't care your word said this i believe it that settles it when you come to that place where you can believe god in that way and know that he's in control and he will do it in his time and in his season stress leaves you amen worry is unbelief you know that's worry is unbelief but you know what the things you need to pray most about are the things that you worry about the most next slide take the yoke i give you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble and i will restore deep rest into your soul how many need some deep rest how many knows that these last two years have been just oh amen it has it has taken people's rest it has taken people's minds that i've never seen such oppression like i've seen it in the people over these last two years and the effects of people and depression and oppression like never before saints but god says i i can take that from you i can remove that from you i will restore deep rest next slide and so now we want to move on to the next stage of this how to pray for healing and restoration part two and we want to continue and we want to look at the next step and if we look at the next slide it says ask god for help you know a lot of people they don't ask they try and work things out on their own they think that i can do this i can do this no you need to ask god next slide it says i tell you the truth my father will give you anything you asked for in my name until now you have not asked for anything in my name ask and you will receive so that your joy will be the fullest possible joy now i want you to notice something here the lord did not say everything you know there's a difference between everything and anything he says you can ask anything you want you can absolutely and he says ask ask anything anything then let him decide when he wants to and if he wants to give you one of your any requests because he knows when is the right time and the best time and he knows if you're ready for it he knows if you deserve it he knows if you if you've done your part he knows you know like you know a lot of people just like you know it's like a child right you know when you're going through the store a child says daddy i want this i want that i want this i want that and a father knows you know he's pointing at a rifle a father knows that you know he's not going to give him the rifle a father knows what his sons and daughters need but he says ask ask and continue to ask let's look at the next slide remember jesus wants me to ask he why does he want you to constantly ask well look at a child when a child goes to the mummy and the daddy and says mommy i i want this you know mommy i got a boo-boo i need a i need a band-aid and mommy goes and puts that band-aid on there and rubs it and kisses it the the child says oh thank you mommy it starts to build trust it knows that when you respond to that child over and over again it starts to trust you and that's why a child their mummy and their daddy is everything to them well god is the same for us he wants us to ask because he wants us to trust him he wants us to trust him in the situations knowing that that his answer is perfect he will give us the right answer at the right time and he knows what's absolutely best for us but he doesn't but because he hasn't responded because he hasn't given you the answer exactly when you wanted it next slide we got to continue to pray for our needs and never give up look when you give up you stop praying it's that simple when you stop praying it's because you gave up the two cannot work at the same time the two got to work together amen they can't be one against the other amen so you can't do one without the other when god has not answered you yet it's because he is testing you or because he is testing your priorities or because he's testing your motives or he's testing your maturity because when a child does start to grow the parent starts to give them certain responsibility and test them on whether they are going to be responsible enough to handle what they are asking for these are simple things aren't they but i'm telling you they're profound because like over these last three weeks in in doing this research and and and these studies i've come to realize a lot of things about myself and i'm sure you have too a lot of areas in your life where you were just taking certain things for granted you were you were careless in in many ways you know god really really uh you know just checking my heart through all of this and boy am i ever being tested i'm telling you i'm being tested saints you might think oh well brother danny you know you're you're you don't seem like you know you always seem positive and this and that i'm positive i'm positive about him i'm positive that he's going to work everything out and it's going to work for my good regardless of whatever the circumstances might be now however i might look at them right now whatever i'm looking at is regardless because i'm trusting in the promises of god amen praise god next slide he says here and i will put this third into the fire this is zechariah and refine them as one refines silver and test them as gold is tested they will call upon my name and i want to i want to just tell you what that means they will pray and i will answer them and they will say the lord is my god he is my god hallelujah because he came through amen he made you know he brought it to pass at the right time he just knew exactly when i was going to need what i needed amen praise god but he knew that i needed to be tested he knew that my attitude needed to be tested he knew that my patients needed to be tested he knew that my my my uh you know all these attitudes that that that we build up as we grow and and as we mature you know as whatever area of your life whatever if you're a businessman or you're a teacher or you're you're a worker he just knows exactly where he needs to refine you because saints of god this is all about perfect faith this is all about knowing who you are in the lord he wants you to see who you really are he wants you to recognize that you're not under this human control you're not to be controlled by human teaching by human ability you are a son or a daughter of god that's led by the spirit of god you will not be controlled by anything but the lord himself amen praise god hallelujah yes sir next slide and so what we need to do now in moving forward in building our relationship with the lord is building our relationship with others and get other people to pray with you we need one another don't be trying to be a lone ranger when you get into situations that you think you know like boy i'm i'm really i'm really in a bad spot right now you know a lot of people as soon as they get hurt they they run they go looking for you know for for a hiding place they immediately start looking everywhere else but god is saying no closer together clean yourself find yourself in prayer with one you know somebody that you can trust somebody that you can spend time with in prayer that they can pray for you you can pray for them you can come to the cir you can come to the elders of the church next slide it says i tell you that if just two of you on earth agree together about anything two you don't need to be a 500 people you don't need to have everybody you know in the whole church praying about that situation it's up to you certain things you will you know certain things are personal certain things you need to just get out there you know the difference but if just two two can agree on anything it will be done for you by my father in heaven matthew that's jesus speaking next slide is any of you in trouble he should pray is anyone happy let him sing songs of praise is any one of you sick he should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the lord these are all things that are available to us amen next slide and the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well the lord will raise him up if he has sinned he will be forgiven you see now now now you say but wait a minute here you mean i can be forgiven for anything absolutely anything there is nothing god didn't sin is just unbelief in the word of god and so whatever it is and a lot of people they want to hide their sin because they're ashamed and they're not willing to go to the elder of the church or their deacon and say brother or sister you know brother you know can you please pray for me can you anoint me with oil because now it's because not because you think well if i just do that i'll be fine you walk out and go sin again no no there's a difference there's a reality and a sincerity in your heart amen that you are going because you are truly sorry you are truly repented amen praise god next slide prayer pray in the spirit at all times with all kinds of prayers asking for all you need to do this you must always be ready and never give up remember never ever ever hear here it is right here in ephesians chapter six never give up always pray for all god's people amen never give up never never think that oh you know what this has gone too far this this can't be fixed oh i don't think this can be uh you know this can't be no no everything can be fixed there is nothing too hard for the lord absolutely nothing too hard for the lord you just got to take it to him you've got to trust him amen what are you looking for you're looking for a breakthrough in that area you need a breakthrough in that area you know next slide if you had been here on friday night you know for the prayer meeting you know i want you to if you haven't done so you need to go back you need to read on on page 120 of your workbooks in your 40 day prayer workbooks about praying for a breakthrough it's a real blessing there's six steps for praying for a breakthrough and read daniel chapter nine read the whole chapter you're gonna see things in there that god you know what like god dealing with you in prayer how god deals with his servants in prayer amen it was a real blessing brother brother desmond ministered on it you know it's all in your workbooks you should be using your workbooks you should be reading your daily scripture you should be praying you should be connected to a small group if you possibly can so that you guys can work together pray together and and then have testimonials together amen praise god so if you get a chance look at that and so now let's move on to the next slide number three in how to pray for healing and restoration seek god not a miracle i know that seems a little bit strange right but if my people which are called by my name so first of all my people not just anybody you've got to be identified in the word of god you've got to be identified as a christian my people who are called by my name in the name of the lord jesus christ if you're the wife and bride of jesus christ you've taken his name in baptism in all that you do everything is in the name of the lord jesus christ called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face seek my face and turn from their wicked ways they will hear from heaven and will and and will forgive their sin and will heal their land next slide brother branham says here whatever you do don't you forget my words don't you let this anchor god take an iron pen and engrave it in your heart that you won't forget it don't forget it thus saith the lord return to god with all your heart come back don't rely upon emotion sensation or anything seek god with all that's in you until something happens to you that you want to straighten up you want to be godly you fear god you want to live right do that don't you forget it because we are at the end time now remember we're at the end time from a true sign that's overlooked next slide i love those who love me and those who seek me to find me and when you seek god you get everything else you see everybody's always praying lord give me this lord give me that lord i need this lord i need that god is not some atm that you just go there and you just think god just okay this okay that okay that like no seek god seek god with a walk with him seek him in in the power of his resurrection seek him that you want to have that relationship that you know you're naked before god and that it's you and god and when and that now that relationship is something that god is just enjoying with you there's too many that don't really seek him next slide god rewards those who earnestly seek him next slide the lord looks down from heaven on the entire human race he looks to see if there's even one with real understanding who seeks for god can you imagine why because they've made him an object of worship the whole world has turned god and just into an object of worship that's why there's so many different gods out there but if they ever seek him and seek his face his reality his presence in their lives he'll he'll burn all the sin out of their lives he'll he'll expose all the things that we need to let go of he'll deal with you that to where you will repent and repentance is is something beautiful it's not something bad repentance is you know it's from the word metanoia from the scriptures is to turn it's to turn and change our minds from looking at things in a certain way and then seeing them in the right way that's what god is asking you to do is to take you know certain attitudes in certain ways that you look at things and you interpret things and and he's saying repent turn away from those ways of thinking and look at your life that you know that you know once you've confessed your sin your sin gets left behind you've repented of it and now you're brand new again so repentance is a beautiful thing it's not something that we should be afraid of it's something that sets us free it liberates us from the power of darkness it moves us from darkness into light because you were believing a certain way and now you're believing the right way hallelujah next slide you know i i really like the way he said this he said if you're stuck in a cycle and year after year after year you feel like i'm not getting any better i'm just kind of stuck i'm in neutral i wasn't any better last year i'm not sure i'll be any better this next year same situation relationships still stink my habits still are not where i want them to be you're stuck in that cycle it's because you're not seriously seeking god you're not seriously seeking god and and uh um you've got to seek him with all your heart you know what if you'll do that it's kind of like humility god loves the humble but god goes overboard for people who seek him he will bless your socks off i started laughing when i read that hallelujah the lord can bless you so much my god you'll jump right out of your socks yes hallelujah brother praise god all you got to do is seek him with all of your heart seek him knowing that he's real he's not some denominational teaching he's not in some because he's in this church because of this preacher or because of that preacher it's got nothing to do with the preacher it's got to do with him hallelujah it's got to do with his word and how his word is being revealed to you [Music] glory to god amen next slide if you seek the lord your god you will find him if you look for him and with all your heart and with all your soul when you are in distress and all these things have happened to you you will return to the lord your god and obey him for he is merciful god hallelujah he will not abandon or destroy you aren't you thankful for that amen he'd never destroy or abandon you but sometimes you need to get into desperation you got to come to a place where you become desperate with your situation and you and you just got to say that's enough enough is enough i'm not dealing with this anymore i'm not going to stay the same way i don't want 2022 to be a repeat of 2021 in my life i don't want this unbelief around my life anymore i want healing in this situation i want restoration in my marriage i want restoration in my finance i want restoration in my health i want these things to be dealt with i don't want them anymore amen glory to god you got to make that decision you got to decide and so the only way you can do that is you need to seek the lord with all of your heart next slide listen to brother brown he says now we're going to talk on desperations for a few minutes now usually it takes a state of emergency you know everybody oh they go running to god the moment there's an emergency what about having that relationship so that when you come to that emergency he's already there waiting that's the kind of relationship that we should have especially after so many years walking with the lord and for those that are young and walking with the lord you can trust him in that way he will be there at every emergency and he'll do it even when you haven't prayed if you're a son or a daughter of god my god how many of you can look back on life and know that god was right there when you didn't deserve it but yet he was there keeping you he was there when you didn't deserve it oh come on saints you should you should judge something you should jump up and run around this place i feel like doing that right now come on saints you know that god has taken you out of situations circumstances you didn't deserve it you didn't even know him while we were yet sinners he loved us what amazing love what amazing grace it takes a state of emergency to throw us into desperation see it's too bad it has to do that but human beings are so slothful in their mind that it takes an emergency something arises and when they do then then it throws them into that desperation and really in doing that in desperation it brings out that real thing that you are oh we could talk about this all day long because some people they just run for their lives they run from the church they leave the church they'd say well god didn't do it for me there so i guess i'm going to have to move on you see it it brings out what's really there when you get tested you know that the church is a mystical body of jesus christ it's not a place it's not at 5270 new street or whatever address this church is whatever that that's not the church that's a building then there is a body of believers that within that body are sons and daughters of god that believe god they either believe it or they don't it's just that simple and they do not run when they get under the pressure when the pressure comes they draw closer they look for help look at look look when when there's sheep in trouble they draw closer together they protect one another amen they don't look they you don't you don't be running away and going off on your own because i'll tell you the enemy is like a wolf he's waiting for one of those sheep to go run off on their own so that he can devour them and and take control of their lives and take them further away from god no sir the real thing it shows what you're made out of in the time of desperation and it usually pulls out all the good things that are in you hallelujah you know how you know that you're a son or a daughter of god is when you get tested and you get tried like a fire you get everything gets taken from you regardless but you know god you know what's real you know the reality of god in your life you know what he he has done for you you have that experience and you can always go back on that experience and know that he's real amen praise god number four next turn my attention from the world to the word we're looking at how to pray for healing and restoration and this is number four we turn from the world we don't look to you know like so many people are you know oh i gotta go see a psychiatrist it's sad it's very sad a lot of those psychiatrists need psychiatrists themselves because they've been dealing with so many unbelievable situations that their own minds are starting to lose it you think it's easy for these look up some of them a lot of them are in trouble they don't realize there's only one real you know like i'm not saying that counseling is bad no counseling is good there's nothing wrong with counseling but when you've made it your absolute outside of god good luck because if you're working with the lord and the lord leads you into a proper counseling to somebody that's going to guide you and lead you in the right way and your faith is in the lord still always in the lord not in the world not in the world's ability to fix your situation not in the world's ability to you know the the the the economy is going to fix my financial issues no not the economy jehovah jireh provided all of my needs my finances got nothing to do with the world if god has designed you in a certain way you know look you know something that really you know struck my heart you know in studying and all of this god has designed you in a certain way for the body of jesus christ and if there's some of you that the lord is going to bless financially then those are the things that you are going to be concerned about most of the time that's just the way you're built you've got to understand the way god designed you and and built you and so you'll find yourself in certain situations where you are your your your concern is about finance i'm just using that as an example i realize that that that's you know the way god built me a lot of people think oh you're money hungry money i don't need money other than what we need for this earth and what we need to to do what we need to do the part that we need to do the part that we need to support how we need to support it it's listen when when the rapture happens money ain't going to be on my mind but you know what money is on my mind because god designed me in a certain way god designed you in a certain way and the things that are on your mind are usually the things that you know that you should be working on praying about finding support uh you know looking for support in those areas but knowing that it's god that put that in you and so if it's god that put that in you and it's god that that's designed you that way then god will provide what you need in order to fulfill your part [Applause] so why should you be fearful of losing anything you can't lose nothing [Applause] everything that god has given you is already it's predestinated from before the foundations of the world he designed you in that way and so he's expecting you to live by faith in that area and so we need to recognize each other's strengths and weaknesses and recognize that the body we we need one another we need each other god needs us in this ministry here this local ministry there's a part that each and every one of us has and we need to find it and get into it next scripture you know turn from their wicked ways when you think of the word wickedness you know a lot of people think of the word wickedness and right away they'll start thinking about you know murder and and and you know uh all kinds of you know things that we can look out into the world as being wick wicked but you know what wickedness when you when you really look it up to see what it actually means scripturally forgetting god god was speaking saying if my people who are called by my name and if they shall seek my face and they shall turn from their wicked ways i will hear them i will heal them i will hear the land he's he's saying don't look anywhere else for me you're looking anywhere else for me as wicked you're actually putting god in second place because you're you're you're putting all your faith in the wrong things we want to communicate we want to have that right relationship so that we can receive our healing and our restoration and i know we all need it amen turn from it next scripture isaiah 17 says you have forgotten the god who saves you and you have not remembered that god is your place of safety and so people will choose wicked ways other ways outside of the word of god use anything else but god to try and solve their problem try to do it themselves god says turn away from that look back to me he says seek my face next repent and turn to god so that your sins may be wiped out so that your times of refreshing may come from the lord we need times of refreshing how many how many needs sometimes a refresher amen praise god saints i don't know about you but you know what these last couple of years they've been they've been crazy years and we need some times of refreshing from the lord amen we need we need him to just come and scour out and so the only way we're going to do that is we need to get into a habit of prayer we need to seek his face we need to continually approach him amen next slide if you hide your sins you will not succeed we need to we need to come we need to we need to come and confess we need to we need to say hey i need help here i need i need i need restoration i need restoration in my finance i need restoration in my health i need restoration in my home with my children with my wife with my husband i need restoration you've got to humble yourself you got to come to a place and you got to let that unbelief that's holding you back because it's only unbelief when you think that something is impossible nothing is impossible for god god can make a way through the way or the situation that can that can satisfy everybody god knows how to do that it's not always a one-way street you can't be all one way you listen anybody listen anybody that is just no my way or the highway you need to get back on your knees because it's not my way or the highway you better discover god's way because that'll be the best way but if you hide your sins you'll not succeed but if you confess and reject them you will receive mercy why would you why would he say you'll receive mercy because you probably don't deserve it because you've been so stubborn and you've been so much in your own ways and you want to do it your way and that's it in my way or no way and but god says if you just repent and try me if you just humble yourself allow yourself to just come to a place where you know you need help god will make a way because he'll show mercy amen praise god how we need mercy and grace therefore and we're winding this down saints because what i want to do is i want to give everybody an opportunity today to be healed and to be restored the lord showed me last night in the middle of the night woke me up and showed me that there's healing and restoration needed in this house and he says let them come now we're not going to have a big altar call that's not what we're going to do but we're just going to allow you one at a time whoever wants to come through and wants to come up here and i will anoint you with oil and then i want everybody in the house to be praying for that individual we don't need to know what it is but your action in coming forth your decision in deciding that that you know what i need healing i need restoration it takes action sometimes that's it it really does saints we have to do we need to show that we really want it and so sometimes we need to confess and we need to go forward and we need prayer therefore next slide confess your sins no go back to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed now you decide if you you know like like we were saying here like if you decide you want to confess something you know with somebody that you know that you trust and you don't have to get into all the details but you want to you want change you want to be set free the first thing you got to do is you got to let go of that thing you can't let it stay in your closet because it's going to haunt you it's going to continually come back you don't want to stay the same way you want change you want to allow god to come into that situation whatever it is and bring healing and bring restoration to that situation hallelujah god says here through our prophet next slide i will restore saith the lord all the years all send back i'll send back another church in the last days i will restore that original power again how's god gonna do that if you're not willing to go all the way if you're not willing to yield yourself surrender yourself that's the only thing jesus asked us to do was only believe all things are possible to them that believe we don't want to stay in the condition that we're in if we're in a certain condition that we're not happy with then we need to we we need to take a step to change and allow god to come and change that situation i will restore that original power again in the evening time it shall be light down in the heart of that tree no matter how many branches is pruned there will come forth the royal seed of abraham hallelujah god promised it god will do it he said he would do it i will restore all the years that the denominations eat away i will restore all the years i've proved i've pruned the thing off but yet there will come a vine out of the heart of it he'll be like a tree that's planted in the rivers of water a man that meditates in the word of god day and night not to a creed or a denomination but meditates in the word day and night he'll be like a tree that's planted by the river of water branches shall not wither he'll bring forth his fruit in the season god promised it god has a plan for each and every one of our lives we want him to have his way in each and every one of our lives let us bow our heads and let the musicians come you talk to god you search your heart you search the things that you know you don't want anymore you need healing in that area healing is not just something physical in your body healing can be an emotional scar a memory something somebody did to you years and years and years ago and you're still allowing that thing to come up and control you and and bind you and put you under certain fear and doubt and then god can restore the joy of your salvation maybe you find yourself a little bit miserable at times and find yourself depressed more than you're you're you're happy you should be you know a son or a daughter of god should be the happiest person on earth but we're human and i understand that and we all know that but if we're miserable and we're depressed more than we are joyful and and and at rest is because we're not trusting the lord we're not praying enough we're not believing him enough one of the brothers go find me some oil please just search your heart saints just play a soft song [Music] search me oh god [Music] he was first [Music] surely hallelujah you might have some sort of a doctor's report i don't know [Music] whatever it is saints humble
