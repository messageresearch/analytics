========================================
[Music] he's changing me are they just words that we're singing or are they reality reality because faith is declaring unto you that there's a change taking place how can you know that you're being change unless faith is being revealed to you from Glory unto Glory do it Lord amen it's a good to be here today amen amen I uh it's always uh I don't know for me to stand here is is something that I've always ran away from but to stand here is the greatest honor and the greatest privilege that any man could have amen [Applause] God would chose me I don't know I really don't know but I just want to do what he wants to do in my life and fulfill what he has to fulfill in my life what else what else can we do that's not only for me that's for each and every one of us right so if we just get ourselves and our own thoughts out of the way and our plans for our lives and let God do what he wants to do in our lives regardless of our own thoughts because it's our greatest enemy is our own thoughts our own selves because we always put ourselves down we're always calling you know you know taking ourselves as unworthy but we we got to watch that we don't take that too far because we do make mistakes and we do fall down but remember who called you amen the great king of glory and does he make a mistake no abut so I don't think he made a mistake in calling me this morning to minister the word and for you to be here and for you to receive the word right I have nothing that I can give you but my own experiences but I know there's one here if we can break into the supernatural right there's one here that can speak to your heart that can release Faith to you that can produce a change in you that's why we come to church for right it's to meet with him May that become a reality to me and to you more today amen I believe this message with all my heart am amen I believe it with all my heart and I want to live it with all my life but I know that's going to take a sacrifice I know that's going to take a dying out I know that's going to take for me to surrender my life and it's no less for any one of us we ain't going to come any other way than any other one that came through the path we have to follow those bloody Footprints right up to glory amen each and every one of us have to die to our own selves I I I I can be here encouraging you encouraging me but you have to take the word am and you have to apply the word and you have to go through the pain that it takes to die out but I believe that there's a bride and as we speak this morning I Was preparing another message this week I got hit really heavy with a I just got hit with the devil I'm not going to say what it was I got hit with the devil I was gone for a few days and and I was I was lying there Thursday morning still not feeling 100% I had a thought in my mind and as I was in in between sleep and awake he does that to me sometimes and he speaks and he gave me this title and I believe it's not only for me but it's for you that we should earnestly contend for the perfect faith that I once delivered to my bride amen amen let's see what the Lord will do this morning Amen Let Us stand and go to Jude 1 we'll read down there's a word here any words that are over 10 letters I I can't pronounce so you can scream it up when I get to it I'm trying but I like us we got the first slide up there yeah Jew the servant of Jesus Christ the brother of James to them that are Sanctified by God the father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied beloved when I give all deligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints for there are certain men creeped in unaware who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into that's amen and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ I will therefore put you in remembrance through ye once knew this how that the Lord having save the people out of the land of Egypt afterwards destroyed them that belied not see how important it is to believe and continue to believe amen let us pray father we just commit the service into your hands we commit ourselves to you father I'd be up here speaking Lord but it's not me speaking it's you speaking by the still Small Voice into every one of our hearts Lord we can do nothing without you lord so we're reporting for service for Duty Lord for battle Lord each and every one of us Lord father break every Spirit of unbelief break every Spirit of Doubt break and bind the spirit of fear anxiety anxiousness that is in our midst Lord and let the spirit of God have the Liberty because of Calvary because of what You' sacrificed because of the word that's been released in this last day it's been crucified and has been resurrected have the preets in our midst father in Jesus name you may be seated I really don't know where I'm going to go this morning just going to probably preach a lot of things preaching is just saying things over and over and over again I'm going to read a lot of quotes is I I feel that the things that I want to say and the way I want to say it in some ways nobody says it better than the prophet amen right I can say it in my own words and that's true in some things I do but I just feel to do that this morning bring back you know when the Bible says in the Book of Revelation when you lost your first love go back to your first wordss and we cannot change that this is the this is not and we have expressed it and you know you have to say this by faith you have to say this with total understanding that it's not brother bram's day we understand that but the word that he brought he was a prophet and the word comes to the prophet that word is eternal that word is here today and it's real and it's written that we all could feed off of in the message we call the message of the hour and that word will never be out of date it will never be a past age he's the same yesterday today and forever amen amen so don't let the devil deceive you because this is the pale horse rider this is the most decept age that we live in is this age that we live in amen and you need this word that is sharper than the two head sword sometimes to cut through the unbelief the deceptionist out there that we are subject to the atmospheres in our minds and our Spirits out there we need this word to cut through it sometimes in our own lives amen and break the deceptionist sometimes we I get deceived for a period of time and I need the word to be spoken in a certain way and that's what he's saying here these people have creeped in and and and speak speak in the word of God and not speaking it the way it should be spoken do I know how to speak it the way it should be spoken no but he knows how to speak it I just got to yield my vessel to him and let him speak it the way he wants to because we need it we not staying here this this world is becoming less and less to me amen amen the other side is more real to me and every year is becoming more real to me I don't want to stay here I don't know about you you but I don't know what you see when you look out in the world but I know what I see I see prophecies being fulfilled and all I know what's up ahead is a Rapture is got to take place a body change is got to come my life has got to be ready for that Rapture and I all I have to do is yield my vessel to him I know it sounds easy but yielding your life to Jesus Christ is not easy true true it's not easy to give everything over to him the fears and the doubts and and the things that we struggle with in our flesh is not easy but God gives a faith a perfect Faith to us right that causes us to raise above our trials and our circumstances in our lives and the things he gives us a faith to raise above it amen thank you Lord and press on press on to what press on to the resurrection press on to see that word Jesus Christ live in me that's been my my my Revelation my experience right from the beginning is oh God more of you and less of me live in me he saved me he saved you but what does he want to do now let him live let him have the preeminence let him incarnate let him do what he wants to do get ourselves out of the way earnestly contend earnestly sincerely contend for the Faith with intense conviction over danger difficulties something as a position and Ur urement maintaining holding claiming a state declaring professing something earnestly content for that faith I'm talking to those this morning that have faith and if you don't have faith I'm praying that God will give you Faith amen because that's the people that have faith know what it is and that's who the Lord is speaking to to his bride in this last day yes and I believe that we're all right but I'm not God Amen I'm not the judge of that he knows his own I know my own he say so I'm just speaking the word but the word needs to be spoken and God will take care of his own I can't be scared I got to speak it as it is I can't be scared because God knows his own he'll take care of his own and if you're of his own he will reveal to you he'll make plain and known who you are that's right and what is the greatest Revelation Brothers and sisters that that we see it's not about the Mysteries it's not about you know all the ways that man can preach the word of God and make it more mysterious it's about knowing who you are that's the greatest Revelation that God can give you is who you are because if you don't know who you are this morning you're wavering you're up you're down you're all over the place you don't have no position you don't know where understanding you don't know where your place is in the body of Jesus Christ it doesn't matter how simple it is how simple it is so we need to know who we are that's what God delivers of Faith amen so earnestly my bride content for the faith that I once deliver to you amen there is a perfect faith that was once delivered to the bride you go to the second slide I just got a few inspirational slides I just put it together at the last minute this perfect faith is worth contending for this what we want to talk about this perfect faith is repeatedly threatened from within the church I'm talking about in the message well there's AIG big threat going on it's being threatened all the time because there's an original life there's an original seed amen and without the eyes of discernment and Revelation you won't be able to see this threat but there's preaching going on as we read in uh in our scripture opening that word means there are men preaching the gospel that are Poss M with sexual immortality sexual thoughts running through their mind uncleanness running through their lives that's why I take every position for Me Myself and no matter what position that you have in Christ you take it seriously amen amen when you're dealing with the word of God you're deal I'm not just dealing and standing here because I'm just going to be preaching and I I want to make myself look good I'm not here for that this is a sacred place and not only this this is a sacred place your walk your position in Christ your profession of a of Christianity and believing in this message of the hour is is something that is more greater than you think amen it's Jesus Christ that you're professing and he said don't bear false witness against me amen you might I might not see if you're living a clean life but God sees it God sees if you're sincere he sees the struggles that you have but he sees the faith that that he placed beside you that press through amen but God help you if you're playing with this word God help me yes the things that we're here week after week from the flyf ministry it could be the greatest blessing and eternal life or could be damnation that's the word every genuine believer should contend for the perfect Faith what is it it's the token that has been made available to us in this last day the token the church has always been the the called out the Born Again whether they're methodists Baptists Presbyterians whatever they are and it's the called out of God and the word of God is in for instruction reproof that a man might stand before God blameless if we follow the blueprint well we'll stand blameless the book of Jude as it is written in the year a66 33 years after Pentecost now I want you to notice in Jude who he's addressing he's addressing Christians he's not speaking to unbelievers in the church or make Believers he's talking directly to Christians now notice Jude the servant of Jesus Christ the brother of James to them that are Sanctified not to them that are of the world them that are Sanctified of God and preserved in Jesus Christ we're not only Sanctified we're preserved glory to God and we're called now you're the people that I'm talking to that you earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints not just a faith that was once delivered but the faith that was once delivered now the churches today they go back and I've heard and I've listened to a few sermons on this that are out there and they go back and they look at the Bible they look at Paul they look at Jude back there and see that you know this is what we got to contend for but what they don't realize and that we realize amen is that the word was lost it went through the Dark Ages and it was lost okay the written word actually the written word was lost for a period of time in the Catholic church we know that but that wasn't what was really lost it was the understanding it was the interpretation it was the revelation of the word that was lost okay now now you see God come back and and Luther came with a revelation that just shall live by faith now that word that we're supposed to be contending for was starting to be revealed again and then we know Wesley sanctification all the Revelation and then we know Pentecost came back but they're still looking back there and what are they seeing they're seeing nothing they don't know what they're contending for they don't know what faith that they have I know you said well brother they they believe the written word but no no you can't believe the word unless the word has been revealed to you amen you can't tell me you know the person when you have not met himen amen but they're saying that they know him they say that they're in the faith they say that they're they're they're staying right with the word they're staying right with the letter but look what what the Pharisees and Sadducees did when they stay with the letter what did they do they cruci ified the Lord Of Glory and that's the same thing that they're doing today so when when when when James is talking to us when the Bible's talking to us what we're speaking this morning amen We're Not Looking Back to the days of paulm and that we're looking to today because what he had back there was restored in this day it's the same thing that he had back there but was is restored today and outside of the revelation of this message you you don't see what he was preaching back there you only see it here amen hallelujah so the Lord is speaking to us today to contend for the faith oh not just to contend for the Bible but contend for the Revelation that has been revealed through the message of the hour in your life that's what he's saying contend for that's why he's saying press on because I guess the church or the Bride of Jesus Christ is in a position where he needs to push you a little bit through that pipe this morning he needs to push me through that pipe this morning amen and Shake us a little bit Hallelujah don't think it's easy to stand up here and preach like this because I got to go through it I got to go through it before I can preach it and it's not easy sometimes it's not easy just you know come up here and brag and when when the when the chasing of the Lord Lord and the trials of the Lord and things that you go through amen but you take it thank you you take the word of God the sacrifices that the ministers the fivefold ministry the true ones that are making in their lives to bring forth the word of God are we perfect we're not perfect amen thank youus amen there's only one Faith one Lord one God one baptism one Doctrine I want to make that clear M and now people say we have all the faith and I go to my own church they're saying that we must contend for the faith that Paul spoke but that was lost well that's not what Jude was speaking about he's talking about a different Faith at a different time in this day Hallelujah a word that's been restored a word that come to a prophet of Malachi 4:5 amen hallelujah amen the believer's call is to fight for the faith that's the way Jude begins and ends the letter but in the middle of his concern is different it is not to help Believers feel content but to help them feel Vigilant having been showing them the elected love of God and the surpassing power of God to keep them safe now Jude shows them the danger that surrounds them and that's what I want to break into today the danger that surrounds us Amen in this faith that has been delivered to us amen hallelujah there is a danger and it's not the danger not necessarily is not only coming from false teachers but the danger is with inside yourself it's yourself is your greatest battle it's the atmospheres around you it's what you believe and what you take in is what you interpret amen the danger is the flesh the things the things that you struggle with in your life that you know the spirit of God is pressing you through amen calling you to a higher calling a deeper walk with him a deeper consecration where is the consecration today where is it we don't need it anymore we don't need to pray until we break through we don't need to fast at times when struggles and and and Trials come upon our lives and areas that we know that we're not getting breakthroughs in and we just let it go that's a danger we just ignore it we just ignore these battles that Satan is impressing on us and bombarding us sometimes we have the word we have a sword we got the spirit of God all we have to do is apply the word in our lives all we have to do is God PR we make a decision to fast when we make a decision to pray till we break through when we make a decision to get in the spirit and speak the word in our condition then watch you're not given God any opportunity to fulfill and confirm his word in your life when you're not doing that amen that's the danger L see in church age what's the danger Revelation 3 5 15- 16 I know they works that thou are neither cold nor hot Revelations 3:15-16 that's who we are it's not just something I'm reading it's here this is here this is this age the atmospheres that you struggle with is this this is the word of God fulfilled right now today and you're going to either be under the spirit of the anointing of the word the faith that was delivered to us or you're going to be under this anointing right I just don't want to read and make it sound like it's just I'm reading something to you this is not just words this is the word of the living this is prophecy this is a spirit of Christ which is a spirit of Prophecy amen you want to know what life is all about this is what life is all about you want to know where your struggles are this is where your struggles are you want to know how to get Victory this is where you get Victory amen it's all in here everything that you need to know neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot but because thou are luk warm neither cold or hot I will screw thee out of my mouth Luke God help me you can say to yourself God help you but I'm saying God help me we're going to go and look at this very carefully and what he's saying Le see in church age the group is luk Wen it's Luke Wen it's not going to be it's lukew you understand what I'm saying it's lukew now whether you're lukewarm or not that's between you and God and your experience with the Lord but if you are I pray that Faith would come to you to break out of that lukew because he doesn't have good things to say about it amen this luk is the man's a penalty from God now these messages as the leoan church age the token and perfect faith if you want to go back and read those messages it'll be a blessing to you the penalty is that they will be spewed out of his mouth here is where we don't want to go astray as a lot of folks do they verely unwisely say that God you out of his mouth and that proves that there is no such thing as any truth to the doctrine of perseverance of the Saints I want to correct your thinking right now this verse is not given to an individual it's given to the church the message as whole not the individual the bride that's why I'm trying to difference here this this morning he is talking to the church furthermore if you will just keep the word in mind you will recall that nowhere does it say that we are in the mouth of God we are engraved on his palms we are carried in his bosom way back in the unknown ages Before Time we were in his mind is that the truth is that the revelation of the message for the bride is that what we believe amen we are the Sheepfold of his pastures but never in his mouth but what is in his mouth the word is in his mouth Matthew 4:4 but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God the word is supposed to be in our mouths amen we're not in his mouth but the word is supposed to be in our mouths and in order for the word to be in our mouths the word must be in us the Revelation must be in us the truth must be in US am amen now we know that the church is his body it is here taking place what will we what will be in the church in the mouth of the church you see first Peter 4:11 If any man speak let him speak by the ordinance of the word of God 2 Peter 1:22 for prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy man of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost then what went wrong with these people in the last days they have gotten away from the word now he's talking here because he came to the seven Church age messenger came as the angel to the whole age so he's talking to the whole age but so many times we don't catch the revelation of modern or or or or time that we live in now right we have to place the word today where is God now God is the word where is he now so he's talking back there to the age cuz he had to but as we read it now as a fivefold ministry under the anointing of the Holy Ghost speaks the word of God it speaks different now Amen to our day our age what is the church today the church is the message and there is a bride in the message amen so that you can take this word and apply it to your life and if it's not good you can change it you got time Mercy's on the seat still you have time for repentance and make things right they have gotten away from the word they are no longer fervent about it they are lukewarm about it I am going to prove that right now now he's talking here now the Baptists have their Creeds dogmas based on the word the apostolics they have theirs Miracles based on the word with the Holy Ghost and believe in that the methodists say they're based on the word and there is no water baptism but sprinkling not baptism and sanctification of is the the sprinkling of is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what they believe is the word the Church of Christ Majors on regeneration baptism and they base it on the word but most of the time they go down dry Sinners and come up wet ones yet they claim the doctrine is word based Go Right Down the Line to Pentecost do they have the word give them the word test and see they will sell out the word for a sensation like I've been in a Pentecostal Revival amen a true Pentecostal Revival down in the states I've seen everything in that that that meeting that you would believe and what he's saying here this is what they're doing and they're still doing today they're selling out the word for sensation just about every time you see them on the TV you see them soon as they get a sensation soon as they get a feeling an emotional or something like that bang and then they get a they get a prophecy or something prophecy comes forth and and bang they sell out for that they don't check and see if the prophecy is [Music] right if they can produce a manifestation like oil or blood or tongues or signs whether in the word or not whether it can be properly interpretated from the word or not the majority will fall for it but what has happened to the word the word has been put aside the don't look at the Pentecostal out there don't look at the Methodist and Baptist out there here look in your own life examine yourself to see if you be in the faith that's what we have to do i' rather tell you the way I can see it I can only tell you the way I see it and the convictions on my heart did not tell you because I want to close my eyes in Death Or I want to be changed in a moment the twink of life knowing that all I want to hear well done good and faithful servant and that's should be the same for you it's not only to minister but the word of God is in your mouth too and you are responsible for that word they put the word aside God says I'm going against you all now I'll spew you out of my mouth this is the end the seventh out of The Seven Ages I have said nothing but men esteem esteeming themselves over my own word so at the end of this age I will spew you out of my mouth it is all over I'm going to speak all right yes I am here in the midst of the church the amen of God faithful and true will reveal himself and will be it will be my Prophet oh yes that is so Revelations 10:7 as he declared in Malachi 46 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers I will bring the elect in the last days and they will hear the Vindicated prophet and give exact the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as he did and those he left with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works we are his elect we are his body amen amen we are to produce his Works amen why isn't it happening why isn't it manifest you can ask the own question in your own life why isn't what the Lord said taking place is the danger that surrounds us amen Lord help me in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but the people took the revelation of God became to Liv in Epistles read of all men for their generation there is again people in the land who are under their message will be the final voice to the final age the church out there is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is his own mouthpiece and God is turning on them for the bride and the spirit in Revelation 17 you see it will be the voice of God in her for the spirit and the bride say come amen the spirit and the bride say come I'm trying to bring it and and all that I can Saints I'm in a great battle up here I'm trying to bring it to this day CU Satan don't want you to see it even if it's how simple it can be he don't want you to see the danger because he doesn't Revelation means unveiling uncovering and that's why he hates the Book of Revelation because it uncovers him yes and he's a same devil this morning that hates to be uncovered amen this thing is so simple it's so simple it places right back in your life I don't want you dreaming of of of some fantastic thing in your mind about what's being spoken that it is you the word is speaking to you it's speaking to your experience it's speaking to your condition it's speaking to your life amen thank you Jesus it's speaking all about you because you in the word of become one amen him and his bride are one in the same thank you Jesus there's a danger a Darkness a Satan's eeden an evil presence that is around us that if we don't see and understand and press through this battle in our own lives you don't have my battle I don't have your battle but youve got a battle this morning and you got to take that word you got to take the sword and press through that batt you have the word you have more Bibles than ever but what are you doing with it doing about it they're taking the word dividing it up they're hacking it up into pieces that's what they're doing in this message they're taking the word they taking the Revelation one Minister over here one great Minister over here over here and over here taking the word hacking it up am saying I got it I got it I got it and God never intended that he says I am my own interpreter I will make it plain what he said he said Peter who do you say that that I am who do they say that the son of Adam Peter didn't say well you know well they did say some say this some say that some say that but who do you say that I am I don't care who this brother they they have their work they have their work that's none of my business I don't even want to give a thought in in whether they're right or they're wrong that's none of my business none of our business but who do I say that this is yes that's the question it's a personal revelation to each and every one of us amen people are hacking at the pieces tearing it apart and what is it doing it's confusing the people it's not leading them to Christ brother BR said back there he says I'm afraid that the ministers are not leading the people to Christ I'm I afraid that is happening again in the message today they're not leading the people to Christ to that that that life that is provided for us we look at the prophet as the wave sheet we seen what he went through we seen how God down we see how humble the humility and the things he had to go through we hear his life being spoken on The Taste we see how God dealt with them with situ sitations after situations and he's our way sheet how can God do anything different if you don't see the dealings of the Lord and the holy ghost moving in your life in some way or some shape like you did that you see in the prophet get on your knees get on your knees and I'm not saying that you are the prophet you are you are the seventh age messenger but outside of that office there was a a life amen that he lived there was a personal relationship outside of that office that he had and I see that he stood alone he stood alone in an age he stood around people he stood around church members he stood around friends that were not seeing this life that was was not being dealt with with the Holy Ghost like he was being dealt with the word was not leading them into a life of crucifixion like they were leading him a life of surrender a life of of total submission like they was doing like the Holy Ghost was doing with him and he stood alone you can see by faith you can see what he would stood you can see the battles that he went through the oppositions that he went through you can see I'll even even to a place where where he said to his wife tell them I'm not home and the Holy Spirit say you can't even go pray for that little child unless you go tell him that you lied oh he try to hide and try to go outside but you see the dealings of the Holy Spirit I'm trying to bring something here amen there was a life that the prophet lived and that life was the Holy Ghost and he had to overcome he had to contend for the faith he stood alone amen he stood alone we're not standing alone I don't know how many are here this morning that are contending to Faith but I know that there are some here because I know their experience I know their walk I know the word of God is in their mouth and when they speak I can I can hear the voice of God and I can hear them testifying that they're contending for this Faith this perfect Faith this perfect life this surrendered and consecrated life that was once delivered through a life of the prophets am so more than hacking the word more than understanding the word we need to know him the word himself the life more than what brother can say it doesn't matter what his English it doesn't matter what his education it was his life the life of Christ was on display it's not necessarily the words that were spoken but it was the spirit that was being released out of his life the spirit that you hear on the Tes the voice of God because was in his why was it in his mouth because it was in his life it was in his consecration
