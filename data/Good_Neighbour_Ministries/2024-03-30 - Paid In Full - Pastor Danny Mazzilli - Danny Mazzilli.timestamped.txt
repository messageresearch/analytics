[36:51] chapter 8 verse 36 he says he whom the
[36:55] son of man has set free
[36:58] is free indeed praise God let's go to
[37:01] our scripture before we do that we'll
[37:03] just ask the Lord to send once more his
[37:07] inspiration to the word father we're so
[37:09] grateful tonight Lord we feel your
[37:12] spirit and your presence here this
[37:14] evening we're so grateful father that
[37:16] Lord that you are a living God to us
[37:18] Lord we're not mourning tonight Lord we
[37:21] are rejoicing father Lord we're we're
[37:23] we're in a time in our lives to know
[37:25] that we've accepted what you did for us
[37:28] 2,000 years ago and you resurrected and
[37:31] you came to be with us here tonight in
[37:34] our midst father you said I'll be with
[37:36] you even in you Lord we're calling upon
[37:39] that promise tonight and we're asking
[37:41] you to take possession of the speaker
[37:43] and the hearers Lord as we Fellowship in
[37:45] Heavenly places Lord may you take
[37:48] control in Jesus name amen praise God
[37:51] let's go to our
[37:52] scripture Colossians chapter 2:
[37:56] 10-4
[37:58] and ye are complete in him which is the
[38:02] head of all principality and Power in
[38:06] whom also ye are
[38:08] circumcised with the circumcision made
[38:12] without hands in putting off the body of
[38:16] the sins of the flesh by the
[38:18] circumcision of Christ so in other words
[38:21] we're not doing the natural circumcision
[38:23] he's saying here there's a spiritual
[38:25] Supernatural circumcision that takes
[38:28] place and and that's the the the the the
[38:32] uh complete birth and Born Again
[38:34] experience of coming into Christ and
[38:37] being completely separated from the sin
[38:41] of the flesh amen praise God buried with
[38:44] him in baptism that's why we baptize in
[38:48] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[38:50] water because it's a type of being
[38:53] buried and leaving the old life buried
[38:57] and and then being resurrected in the
[38:59] name of the Lord Jesus Christ to a brand
[39:02] new life that is debt
[39:05] free amen praise God buried with him in
[39:08] baptism wherein also ye are risen with
[39:11] him through the faith of the operation
[39:14] of God in other words through the
[39:17] Revelation that God reveals to you of
[39:20] who you are who he is amen praise God
[39:24] who hath raised him from the dead and
[39:27] you you being dead in your sins and
[39:30] uncircumcision of your flesh hath he
[39:33] quickened together with him having
[39:35] forgiven you
[39:37] all
[39:39] trespasses trespasses yes translated
[39:45] debt Hallelujah blotting out wiping out
[39:49] the handwriting of
[39:51] ordinances that was against us which was
[39:54] contrary to us and took it out of the
[39:58] way nailing it to the Cross amen the
[40:02] Lord add His blessings to the word God
[40:03] bless you you may be seated
[40:06] amen what was nailed to the cross is
[40:10] described as the handwriting of
[40:13] requirements ordinances in the King
[40:16] James version that was against us
[40:19] ordinances that were against us which
[40:22] was contrary to us because ordinances
[40:26] the word used in the King James version
[40:28] sounds like
[40:30] law some twist the meaning of nailed it
[40:33] to the Cross into Paul saying the force
[40:36] of the law of God ended at the death of
[40:39] Christ the law still
[40:43] exists and the penalty of sin still
[40:47] exists for those that do not accept
[40:50] Jesus Christ as the atonement for your
[40:54] sin so it wasn't so you know when we
[40:57] look at
[40:58] this okay and using the words Paul here
[41:01] like in in the scripture that we read
[41:04] okay nailed it to the Cross Paul was
[41:06] describing the record of our sins now I
[41:09] want you to understand something back in
[41:11] the days you know back in the days of
[41:13] the Romans and and going all the way
[41:15] back to Egypt and and and at the time
[41:17] when they would when they when somebody
[41:19] owed a debt they would take a a writing
[41:24] of ordinance they would write everything
[41:26] that the man owed
[41:27] they'd go to his door and they'd nail it
[41:30] to the wood post on his door to let
[41:33] everybody know this man is in debt this
[41:37] man owes and everybody needs to know it
[41:40] it's like a shame praise God and so when
[41:44] we look at how Paul describes it here in
[41:47] the scriptures we're seeing here that
[41:50] that we had sin on our lives we had debt
[41:55] in our lives there's there's natural
[41:58] debt and then there's spiritual debt and
[42:01] the spiritual debt comes as a result of
[42:03] being born in sin all have fallen short
[42:06] so don't look at anybody thinking oh
[42:09] this person is okay this person you know
[42:11] they didn't do anything wrong that no
[42:13] you're born in sin you're shaped in
[42:15] iniquity and you're speaking
[42:17] lies amen praise God and as you grow and
[42:21] as you you move in this world you start
[42:23] to build up debt sin and it's and it's
[42:28] written against you yes on that day on
[42:31] the great white Throne judgment when all
[42:33] are risen up they'll be judged according
[42:36] to the works of their
[42:38] flesh that's what the scripture says but
[42:41] to them that accept Christ and
[42:44] understand that he was nailed to the
[42:45] cross that when he went to the cross
[42:48] your sin was nailed to the cross because
[42:51] what would happen is when that
[42:53] individual's debt was eliminated and he
[42:56] paid it off
[42:57] they would go to his doorpost and they
[42:59] would put a cross over the ordinance
[43:02] saying he's debt free it's over he's
[43:07] been set free and they would also nail
[43:09] that to the door so that everybody could
[43:11] see it well Jesus Christ went and nailed
[43:15] himself allowed himself to be nailed to
[43:18] the cross and when he went to the Cross
[43:20] he took everything that was on you with
[43:24] him praise God hallelujah this
[44:16] [Applause]
[44:27] before we go to the Lord's Supper
[44:28] there's some of you that are carrying
[44:30] some unnecessary debt and you need to
[44:34] understand that that debt needs to be
[44:36] left behind because Jesus took it and
[44:40] said paid in full amen praise God he
[44:45] paid the price for our sins he took
[44:47] death upon himself and he resurrected
[44:50] himself so that he could give you
[44:52] eternal life because the penalty of sin
[44:57] was death and death is eternal
[45:00] separation from God that's what death is
[45:04] you should not fear death as a son or a
[45:06] daughter of God there is no death to the
[45:10] Sons and Daughters of God because once
[45:14] Christ has filled you with his Spirit
[45:17] once you have given your life to him and
[45:21] you know that the father now dwells in
[45:23] you on that day he says ye shall know
[45:25] that I am in the father
[45:27] ye and me and I and you all that was in
[45:30] Christ Christ ported into the church
[45:33] it's all in you now that eternal life is
[45:37] what holds you it what's it's what keeps
[45:40] you it's what brings you the ability to
[45:42] get back up when you make mistakes
[45:45] because you're going to make mistakes
[45:46] while you're here on this
[45:50] Earth so when we say Jesus took our debt
[45:54] we are acknowledging the reality that
[45:57] we've made him Lord in our
[45:59] life we've expressed it in baptism in
[46:02] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ being
[46:05] buried in water not that it saves you
[46:09] but it shows that you've acknowledged
[46:12] the atonement you've taken the sacrifice
[46:16] you've you've allowed it to clean you
[46:18] cleanse you you know that it has the
[46:20] ability to wash you and to keep you and
[46:22] to give you life beyond this life
[46:26] everybody wants to live
[46:28] forever everybody's looking to somehow
[46:31] they can escape death all the health and
[46:34] beauty and the and the and the and the
[46:36] medicine business is is thriving very
[46:39] strongly these days the vitamin business
[46:42] huge because people are looking for ways
[46:44] that they can live healthier live longer
[46:48] I tell you there's one antidote where
[46:50] you can live
[46:52] eternally and that's Jesus Christ the
[46:56] atonement for our sin amen forgiveness
[47:00] and
[47:00] Reconciliation this transformation not
[47:03] only changes your status from Death to
[47:06] life but it also gives you purpose it
[47:10] gives you a reason to live a reason to
[47:14] overcome the trials and the tests that
[47:17] we all have to face yes we all have to
[47:21] deal with the things of this life but
[47:23] when you've come into that that that
[47:25] recognition you've You' come into that
[47:27] reconciliation with God With Jesus
[47:30] Christ it's something personal and it
[47:33] changes your status
[47:36] immediately it puts you into a a an an
[47:40] an area of life where all things start
[47:43] to work together for good everything
[47:46] comes under submission to the purpose of
[47:49] God because now he's in you remember
[47:52] it's him in you that's what that's what
[47:56] God is watching watchingg over he's
[47:57] watching over his
[47:59] word when individuals claim Christ and
[48:03] they'll go to church and they'll they'll
[48:05] they'll they'll believe in a trinity or
[48:07] they'll they'll believe in doctrines of
[48:09] man and they'll take man's
[48:10] interpretation on the word of God
[48:12] instead of the word which is Christ the
[48:16] spirit of God how can the spirit bear
[48:19] record of
[48:22] that the spirit will only bear record of
[48:25] the truth of his word
[48:27] and so when somebody says how are you
[48:30] baptized and you said I was baptized in
[48:32] water in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:33] Christ for the remission of my sins and
[48:36] God filled me with his spirit I had the
[48:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost I experienced
[48:42] Christ and now he lives forever more in
[48:45] my life the word says amen the word says
[48:50] that's it but when somebody has a
[48:53] testimony that is contrary to the word
[48:55] of God there is no way God can back that
[48:58] word amen praise God listen it's one
[49:02] thing to have Earthly debt erased which
[49:05] would be amazing how many's got debt we
[49:08] all got debt some way somehow you know
[49:12] we choose sometimes to have debt that's
[49:15] life you know but debt is something that
[49:19] that we have to deal
[49:21] with in this realm financially as human
[49:25] beings but then there's another kind of
[49:27] debt it's the kind of debt that brings
[49:29] you
[49:30] down and you know it's an it's an
[49:33] entirely different kind of debt it's
[49:35] called the the the debt of
[49:37] sin okay debt free now can only be
[49:42] achieved in Jesus Christ because he
[49:46] justifies you he justifies you that you
[49:50] never did it in the first place it's not
[49:52] the kind listen imagine somebody coming
[49:55] up to you and saying how much you got on
[49:57] the on the house
[49:59] 500,000 here's the check paid how much
[50:02] you owe in the car here's the check paid
[50:06] Lord and by the way I'm your great
[50:10] uncle and I decided to look you
[50:13] up and your friends turn around and say
[50:16] hey what what's this all about what do
[50:19] you want from me I'm justified in the
[50:22] fact that he's my uncle he came looking
[50:25] for me and he paid my debt am so I can
[50:29] rejoice in that kind of Revelation amen
[50:33] well that's what Jesus did for you he
[50:35] came looking for you he saw that you
[50:38] carried all this weight of sin he saw
[50:40] that you were in a condition that you
[50:42] were so under oppression you were
[50:45] feeling the guilt and the shame of it
[50:47] that he says I'm going to set you
[50:49] free I'm going to pay it in
[50:54] [Applause]
[50:55] full praise God you know let me give you
[50:59] some facts
[51:00] here a study from the Royal College of
[51:04] psychiatrists they did a study around
[51:07] debt and mental health they found that
[51:10] half of the adults with debt problems
[51:14] also live with mental
[51:17] illness problems and
[51:20] issues these illnesses ranged from a
[51:23] consistent feeling of anxiety l
[51:27] mood to diagnosed mental health
[51:32] issues that can make you feel
[51:35] anxious especially if you don't have
[51:38] support thatt can be a huge
[51:41] burden made worse by dealing with it
[51:44] alone nobody likes to be alone nobody
[51:48] likees you know it's a it's it's
[51:49] wonderful when you've got friends and
[51:52] family around you that can be there when
[51:55] times get tough
[51:57] praise God nobody wants to be alone
[52:00] imagine somebody that's completely on
[52:02] their own and they haven't got any way
[52:05] of meeting that next month's rent
[52:08] payment it puts a lot of pressure on the
[52:11] people worrying about debt can affect
[52:14] your sleep losing out on one night's
[52:16] good sleep can make you
[52:19] moody lose your energy
[52:21] levels can also affect your ability to
[52:24] work and have good relationships with
[52:26] your friends and your
[52:27] family that's what debt can
[52:30] do sometimes you wonder you know you see
[52:33] people that you know financially they
[52:35] got no
[52:37] problems but yet they're
[52:40] miserable they're
[52:42] unhappy they're sick they're
[52:46] tired they're always having to deal with
[52:49] with family issues and and problems at
[52:52] work and situations what is what kind of
[52:55] debt is that that's the that kind of
[52:58] debt can only be dealt with by the blood
[53:01] of Jesus Christ no other
[53:03] way that's where you surrender where you
[53:06] come to a place where you realize you
[53:08] can't do it on your own anymore you need
[53:11] the
[53:12] antidote praise God
[53:14] hallelujah all of these things can
[53:16] further add to your debt problem all to
[53:20] say debt can be a very real mental
[53:24] emotional physical weight that we carry
[53:29] from time to
[53:31] time it's a
[53:34] reality let's go to our next scripture
[53:36] we're going to we're going to look at
[53:38] the weight of debt and
[53:41] sin and the antidote to that debt and
[53:45] sin in Luke chapter
[53:48] 23 from verse 33 to 43 we're going to
[53:51] read and when they were come to the
[53:53] place which is called Calvary there they
[53:56] crucified him and the maleactors one on
[53:59] the right on the right hand and one on
[54:01] the left then said Jesus father forgive
[54:05] them for they know not what they do and
[54:09] they parted his reignment and cast lots
[54:13] and people stood beholding and the
[54:15] rulers also with them derided him
[54:18] derided means they ridiculed him they
[54:22] mocked him saying he saved others let
[54:26] him save himself if he be Christ The
[54:29] Chosen of God and the soldiers also
[54:32] mocked him coming to him and offering
[54:34] him vinegar and saying if thou be the
[54:37] king of the Jews save
[54:39] thyself and a super scription also was
[54:42] written over him in in letters of Greek
[54:46] and Latin and Hebrew this is the king of
[54:49] the Jews and one of the malifa which
[54:52] were hanged railed on him saying if thou
[54:56] be Christ save
[54:59] thyself but the other answering rebuked
[55:02] him saying does not thou fear God seeing
[55:06] that thou art in the same
[55:09] condemnation and we indeed
[55:12] justify for we receive the due reward of
[55:15] our Deeds but this man hath done a miss
[55:20] and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me
[55:23] when thou comest into thy kingdom and
[55:26] Jesus said unto him verily I say unto
[55:29] you to thee today shalt thou be with me
[55:34] in Paradise when we look at this
[55:37] scripture it opens up showing us Jesus
[55:40] being nailed to the
[55:41] cross the immense weight of the wooden
[55:45] cross symbolizes not only the physical
[55:48] suffering Jesus endured but also the
[55:51] burden of Humanity's sin he had to carry
[55:54] all the weight of our sin when he was
[55:57] walking up galtha when he was moving up
[56:00] that street and he was falling with the
[56:02] weight of that cross it was because of
[56:04] the weight of our sin on
[56:07] him he didn't he didn't he didn't bow to
[56:11] the pain he didn't submit to the pain he
[56:13] knew the purpose that he had he knew why
[56:16] he had to do it he knew that there was
[56:18] nothing that was going to stop him from
[56:20] getting to the to the to the Finish Line
[56:23] amen praise God then he he was nailed to
[56:27] that cross like he said record of our
[56:30] sins were nailed to that cross all the
[56:34] things that were against us all the
[56:36] things that we hold and we try to hang
[56:38] on to as we live this life and we try to
[56:41] move through this Dimension we we we
[56:43] want to hold on to to old uh you know
[56:47] hurts and and pains we want to hang on
[56:49] to scars from the past we want to we
[56:52] want to say oh but you know it's
[56:53] generational things that that that we're
[56:55] dealing with my life listen when you
[56:57] were birthed by this word and the blood
[57:00] of Jesus Christ cleansed you from your
[57:02] sin your sin was placed in the sea of
[57:05] his forgetfulness never to be remembered
[57:08] no more why would you carry that he
[57:12] nailed it to the
[57:13] Cross glory to God Amen in the midst of
[57:17] his Agony Jesus uttered words of
[57:20] incredible mercy and kindness when he
[57:22] said father forgive them they don't know
[57:27] what they're doing it's like you and me
[57:29] we do things we we get caught into
[57:32] situations you know and we do things and
[57:35] and and and we don't realize what we're
[57:36] doing but the mercy and the grace of God
[57:39] keeps saying over and over you're
[57:43] forgiven you're
[57:45] forgiven have mercy he says he says
[57:48] forgive them Father they don't know what
[57:51] they're doing
[57:55] amen the amount of debt didn't cause
[57:58] Jesus to stray from his purpose he
[58:02] didn't give up he went freely and
[58:05] allowed himself to be the ordinances of
[58:09] our sin and he allowed it to be nailed
[58:12] right there to the Cross so that we
[58:14] could be free we're reminded of the
[58:18] magnitude of the sin that he carried you
[58:21] would have never been able to deal with
[58:23] these things in your life aren't you
[58:26] glad to know that God had an antidote
[58:28] for you that he made a way for you that
[58:31] he allowed you to come into the revealed
[58:33] word that he came himself personally you
[58:37] see that's what this is all about a lot
[58:40] of people are preaching on the cross and
[58:41] preaching about Jesus Christ you know
[58:44] Easter Sunday but they don't realize
[58:46] that he's risen now he's alive
[58:49] now yes we had some stones that we
[58:52] needed to roll away but now they've been
[58:54] rolled away praise God
[58:57] and now we can live
[58:59] free and be debt free and free from all
[59:02] the burden that there was just no way
[59:05] that we could have
[59:06] possibly handled it in the midst of all
[59:10] the mockery Jesus remained steadfast in
[59:13] his mission of redemption there is
[59:15] nothing he said all that the father hath
[59:18] given me will come he says not one of
[59:21] you is going to be lost I'm going to
[59:24] every single one of you's written and
[59:26] and in the palm of my hand your names
[59:29] are written in my book he
[59:32] says and I'm going to call each and
[59:35] every one of you at that appointed
[59:38] time
[59:39] Hallelujah he bore the
[59:42] reproach he bore the
[59:44] mockery and I believe some of us have
[59:47] had to Bear the reproach and bear the
[59:51] mockery it's not easy to stand for Jesus
[59:55] it's not easy for for you to stand and
[59:57] tell the people Hey listen Easter was
[1:00:00] all about
[1:00:02] salvation Easter was all about restoring
[1:00:06] the Earth and bringing us back to the to
[1:00:10] the state that we should have always
[1:00:12] been in before the great fall that took
[1:00:16] place Easter is about the spirit of God
[1:00:19] coming into us to take us out of this
[1:00:22] Dimension and to move us into Heavenly
[1:00:24] places where there's going to be a great
[1:00:26] meeting one day amen with the Lord Jesus
[1:00:29] in the air it's called The
[1:00:32] Rapture we're rejoicing around it we're
[1:00:35] talking about it we're experiencing it
[1:00:39] that's what we're in the midst of that's
[1:00:41] what he's saying tonight you can't take
[1:00:44] the Rapture with debt you can't carry
[1:00:47] your burden you can't you can't sit in
[1:00:50] that guilt and shame and expect the the
[1:00:53] the supernatural power of God to deliver
[1:00:55] you you got to allow the spirit of God
[1:00:58] to come in control take possession
[1:01:01] possess you move aside all the
[1:01:04] hindrances he's the Overcomer that's in
[1:01:06] you that wants to overcome every
[1:01:08] situation that you want to carry he says
[1:01:11] I've paid it in full all you got to do
[1:01:14] is accept
[1:01:18] it amen glory to
[1:01:21] God we're reminded here how Paul you
[1:01:24] know and and how Jesus probably did it
[1:01:26] he he was he was focused on what he
[1:01:29] needed to do Hebrews 12: 1 and 2 says
[1:01:32] wherefor seen we also are compassed
[1:01:35] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:01:39] listen Jesus was on the cross and I can
[1:01:42] tell you if he would have allowed the
[1:01:44] eyes of the people to be opened they
[1:01:46] would have seen millions of Chariots and
[1:01:50] warriors just waiting there to pounce on
[1:01:53] the Romans all he had to do was move his
[1:01:56] finger and say destroy them
[1:01:59] all encamped about with all kinds but he
[1:02:03] denied himself because he had a purpose
[1:02:06] he had you in mind he had you in mind he
[1:02:10] had every one of you in mind saying no
[1:02:12] no no no no I got to fulfill this Plan
[1:02:14] of
[1:02:15] Redemption I could easily he could have
[1:02:18] easily uh just called down millions of
[1:02:21] angels and and everything would have
[1:02:23] been fine and there would have been a
[1:02:24] glorious uh uh you know uh Symphony
[1:02:27] singing around him but he endured the
[1:02:31] cross because he knew there was a
[1:02:34] penalty for sin
[1:02:36] amen and he knew that he was the only
[1:02:39] one that could pay the
[1:02:42] price so wherefore now you having
[1:02:47] received the spirit of God in this day
[1:02:49] having been given the responsibility of
[1:02:52] the representation of Jesus Christ in
[1:02:55] the flesh
[1:02:56] by his spirit in you that's why Paul
[1:03:00] says your hope of glory the spirit of
[1:03:03] God the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ is your
[1:03:06] only hope of Salvation by accepting his
[1:03:10] Spirit within you now you're encamped
[1:03:13] about by a cloud of witnesses now you're
[1:03:16] being watched there's those that died
[1:03:19] for this gospel we've come through the
[1:03:22] Reformation We've Come Through the Dark
[1:03:23] Ages the reformation and we're and here
[1:03:26] we are in
[1:03:27] 2024 and if you look around the world
[1:03:30] there's there's all kinds of signs of
[1:03:32] his of his of his uh uh complete uh uh
[1:03:37] wiping out of sin and unbelief because
[1:03:40] sin is getting so so heavy Wars and and
[1:03:44] and demonic Powers possessing the people
[1:03:47] taking them into all kinds of their own
[1:03:50] interpretations of of what man should be
[1:03:53] and how a woman should be and all this
[1:03:56] all this confusion the world is in
[1:03:58] complete utter
[1:04:02] dismay if there's ever a
[1:04:05] time where where he's he's just ready to
[1:04:08] come it's
[1:04:09] now there's ever a time where he's ready
[1:04:12] to take his church it's

[1:04:18] much fulfilled around our lives for the
[1:04:21] church sure the world is going to go
[1:04:23] into Great Tribulation sure there's
[1:04:25] going to be all kinds of things that are

[1:04:29] this world goes into total chaos God is
[1:04:32] going to take his church he's going to
[1:04:35] remove his body his church the body of
[1:04:38] Believers those that are in Christ that
[1:04:41] have been debt paid in full and have
[1:04:45] entered into Christ

[1:04:51] encompassed about with so great a cloud
[1:04:54] of witnesses let us lay aside every
[1:04:56] weight of debt and sin which doth so
[1:05:00] easily beset us and let's run with

[1:06:32] God rejoiced together around the throne
[1:06:36] Hallelujah he endured the cross
[1:06:38] despising the shame and is set down at
[1:06:41] the right hand of the Throne of God that
[1:06:43] means he set back in his seat of
[1:06:48] power the same God Jesus Christ the Lord
[1:06:52] Jesus Christ Lord God above us Jesus God
[1:06:58] who came as the
[1:07:00] atonement
[1:07:02] Christ in you your hope of glory
[1:07:06] hallelujah
[1:07:09] hallelujah look to Jesus in these last
[1:07:12] verses from our passage we see the two
[1:07:15] different responses that came from the
[1:07:18] two criminals that were on each
[1:07:21] side while one criminal joins the
[1:07:23] mocking crowd and questions
[1:07:27] Jesus the other one recognizes his
[1:07:30] sin and realizes that
[1:07:34] Jesus was
[1:07:36] innocent how do you see him
[1:07:40] today how do you look a lot of people
[1:07:42] they don't look at Jesus in the right
[1:07:44] way they're not seeing him in the right
[1:07:48] way like the way that the that that that
[1:07:50] the the the thief at the cross saw him
[1:07:53] in the right way when they realized this
[1:07:55] man has done
[1:07:56] nothing it was because of me that he's
[1:08:00] here and until you get to a place
[1:08:04] whoever you are wherever you are until
[1:08:06] you come to a place where all pride and
[1:08:09] all your teachings and all your your
[1:08:12] your upbringing and all the things that
[1:08:15] you say are generational and well my
[1:08:17] father was a Methodist my mother was a
[1:08:20] Methodist my grandfather was a method
[1:08:22] Methodist and I'm going to die a
[1:08:24] Methodist
[1:08:26] until somebody can come to a place where
[1:08:29] they allow Jesus Christ I am a Christian
[1:08:33] my parents were Christians right my
[1:08:36] grandfather was a Christian I am a
[1:08:38] Christian a Christian is one that is
[1:08:41] filled with the spirit of God and when
[1:08:44] they read the word they say Amen to the
[1:08:46] word of
[1:08:47] God they don't mock the word they don't
[1:08:50] mock the the the the teachings of the
[1:08:53] word they don't look at somebody that
[1:08:54] believes the the word so much that they
[1:08:57] want to live a certain way like when a
[1:08:59] woman you know uh adors themselves they
[1:09:02] adore themselves in a Christian way in a
[1:09:05] way that doesn't cause a man to look at
[1:09:07] them to lust after them I'm just giving
[1:09:09] you examples here of of life you know
[1:09:12] living a Christian Life yes a man that
[1:09:16] that that you know when he's when he's
[1:09:17] among workers every third word out of
[1:09:20] his mouth is not the you know
[1:09:23] word living examples of of of Christ in
[1:09:27] you if Christ is in you there's no way
[1:09:30] you can you can express that kind of a
[1:09:37] life in his
[1:09:40] humility he pleads and he says to now
[1:09:42] this is the the thief that recognized he
[1:09:45] had done nothing he humbled himself he
[1:09:49] came to a place to realize wait a minute
[1:09:51] here I need
[1:09:53] salvation I need to to understand this
[1:09:56] atonement remember me when you come into
[1:09:59] your kingdom he said to Jesus and in
[1:10:02] response to this simple yet profound Act
[1:10:05] of Revelation because that's what took
[1:10:08] place in him and until you catch a true
[1:10:11] revelation of who God really is he's
[1:10:14] only going to be a teaching Sunday
[1:10:16] school lesson to you he's only going to
[1:10:20] be a Sunday or you know a a Sunday
[1:10:24] churchgoer lesson to
[1:10:26] you he's not going to be a revelation to
[1:10:29] you like he was to Peter when when Jesus
[1:10:32] was on the earth and he looks he says he
[1:10:34] comes down from praying he looks to his
[1:10:35] disciples he says who do the people say
[1:10:37] that I
[1:10:38] am now imagine here's God in human flesh
[1:10:43] and he's asking a question and it's a
[1:10:45] good question you can ask that question
[1:10:48] who do you say Jesus is who do you say
[1:10:51] and he looks he says who do you say that
[1:10:53] I am and Peter you know
[1:10:55] one some of them says oh some say you're
[1:10:57] you know John the Baptist risen Jeremiah
[1:11:00] a Prophet this and that he looks to
[1:11:01] Peter and he says Peter whom sayest thou
[1:11:04] that I am because Jesus knew who he was
[1:11:09] and Jesus knows who you are and when
[1:11:11] that question comes to you as an
[1:11:13] attribute Son of God and somebody says
[1:11:16] to you have you been baptized since
[1:11:19] you've been
[1:11:20] saved who do you say Jesus is and if
[1:11:24] you're calling him well he's he's he's a
[1:11:26] trinity he's three in one I can't quite
[1:11:29] figure it out but that's what he is no
[1:11:31] no he hasn't revealed to you who he is
[1:11:35] that's the problem and now you've got an
[1:11:37] interpretation based on a teaching
[1:11:39] instead of a revelation where God
[1:11:41] reveals himself he says to Peter Flesh
[1:11:44] and Blood hath not revealed this to you
[1:11:48] but my
[1:11:49] spirit I revealed this to you directly
[1:11:53] it's the mind of God his thought
[1:11:56] directly into your heart and and if when
[1:11:59] that happens like it happened to me 30
[1:12:01] years ago there was nobody that could
[1:12:04] convince me different I don't care who
[1:12:06] it was because it was placed in me and
[1:12:09] look what he says to to to Paul or to to
[1:12:11] Peter he says flesh and blood has not
[1:12:14] revealed this your your mom your dad
[1:12:16] your teacher your your your your
[1:12:19] priest he
[1:12:21] says but the spirit has revealed this to
[1:12:24] you
[1:12:25] amen and Upon This Rock not Peter a
[1:12:31] rock upon the divine revelation of God's
[1:12:35] mind rein expressed into your mind and
[1:12:38] heart and thought directly he says I'm
[1:12:43] going to build my church that way and
[1:12:45] you're a part of that building because
[1:12:47] you are one of those Revelations that he
[1:12:50] called in these last days and you've
[1:12:53] responded to the word and you've resp
[1:12:55] responded the right way amen praise God
[1:12:59] so so here now his response simple yet
[1:13:02] profound was an act of Revelation and
[1:13:05] Jesus offers the Assurance of redemption
[1:13:08] and declares truly I say unto you now
[1:13:12] he's speaking to him lip to ear this guy
[1:13:15] he's all ears right now he's he's
[1:13:18] listening and and because he knows that
[1:13:20] this is not some ordinary man speaking
[1:13:22] to him he says today
[1:13:25] you will be with me in paradise and when
[1:13:28] you receive that first revelation of who
[1:13:31] God is and that you're a sinner and that
[1:13:34] you need him and that you can't do
[1:13:37] anything without him that you'll remain
[1:13:39] in your unbelief until that day comes
[1:13:43] and he speaks to you and says today
[1:13:45] that's right today not tomorrow today
[1:13:50] not by going to church oh I got to clean
[1:13:52] up first friends that you know they say
[1:13:54] Dan I I got I got to I got to get rid of
[1:13:57] a lot of things in my life before I can
[1:13:58] come to church I say you got it all
[1:14:00] wrong yes you got it all wrong you can't
[1:14:03] get rid of those things you need to give
[1:14:06] them to Jesus you need he says he that's
[1:14:09] heavy laden let him come unto me I will
[1:14:12] give you
[1:14:14] rest you got to get the thing right you
[1:14:17] need to get into the house of the Lord
[1:14:18] you got to let the word of God wash you
[1:14:21] by the washing of the word of God Amen
[1:14:24] the Regeneration of of his word this
[1:14:26] encounter
[1:14:27] exemplifies the transforming power of
[1:14:30] the Lord Jesus that when he speaks to an
[1:14:33] individual who says Lord I need listen
[1:14:37] go back to your own experience go back
[1:14:39] to that genuine time when you when you
[1:14:42] you you came to God it was now you and
[1:14:45] God you were naked before God and you
[1:14:47] said Lord I need to know that you're
[1:14:49] real and when he unveiled himself to you
[1:14:51] made himself real to you everything
[1:14:54] changed amen it's a supernatural
[1:14:57] transformation that takes place your
[1:15:00] friends won't understand your family
[1:15:02] won't understand it's okay they're not
[1:15:04] supposed to understand they're supposed
[1:15:06] to experience it that's the only way to
[1:15:10] understand you need to experience Christ
[1:15:13] in the power like Paul says of his
[1:15:17] resurrection these criminals were about
[1:15:19] to receive their just penalty the eyes
[1:15:23] of the Romans at that time the way they
[1:15:25] saw them they were to die they were they
[1:15:28] were they were Sinners because of the
[1:15:30] works that they did but there was an
[1:15:33] atonement right there and one of them
[1:15:36] happened to recognize that atonement
[1:15:38] have you recognized the atonement
[1:15:39] tonight amen in the eyes of the Roman
[1:15:42] they were guilty but Jesus hung as an
[1:15:45] innocent man so that he could take on
[1:15:49] every sin that man could not bear
[1:15:57] one of them was fortunate enough to
[1:16:00] recognize who he was next
[1:16:06] scripture in Romans 3:23 as we wind this
[1:16:09] down it says for all have sinned and
[1:16:12] come short of the glory of God there is
[1:16:16] not one person that can say I'm okay
[1:16:19] right no you're not
[1:16:22] okay even you know like okay your your
[1:16:27] salvation it was done from before the
[1:16:30] foundations of the world let's get that
[1:16:32] straight when you respond to this word
[1:16:35] and you truly respond to this word
[1:16:38] You're just showing that you were always
[1:16:40] a Son of
[1:16:42] God and you were just coming in like
[1:16:44] people say oh I went to an altar call no
[1:16:47] the altar call didn't save you the
[1:16:50] response to the word by Revelation
[1:16:52] brought you to the Altar and displayed
[1:16:55] that there was something in you that
[1:16:57] could respond to the word of God for
[1:16:59] this day and for this hour and that is
[1:17:03] salvation that is the New Birth when you
[1:17:05] receive the word in your day not
[1:17:08] denominational word not all the words oh
[1:17:12] the the church has been here for 2,000
[1:17:15] years I don't care how long the any
[1:17:19] church has been around if it's not
[1:17:21] foundationally found on the spirit word
[1:17:24] of the Living God let every man's word
[1:17:27] be a lie and the word of God be the
[1:17:31] truth it's as simple as that so all have
[1:17:34] sinned and fallen short of the glory
[1:17:37] this is true but also Romans 3:24 says
[1:17:41] and all are Justified freely by his
[1:17:45] grace through the Redemption that came
[1:17:48] through Jesus Christ so yes all have
[1:17:52] fallen short but yes Redemption comes
[1:17:55] through the
[1:17:56] cross paid in full Hallelujah listen to
[1:18:01] brother brandom here he says go to the
[1:18:02] next slide what uh what it takes for you
[1:18:05] to
[1:18:08] overcome
[1:18:11] oops your device ran into a problem okay
[1:18:16] yeah I know it ran into a problem I know
[1:18:18] who the cause of the problem is
[1:18:21] too praise God let's let's read it now
[1:18:27] all Redemptive blessings to us the human
[1:18:30] race was paid for for us at Calvary when
[1:18:34] Jesus died for us we believe that the
[1:18:38] work and the complete plan of God every
[1:18:41] Redemptive blessing was completed at
[1:18:44] Calvary we don't need anything else
[1:18:48] don't let anybody tell you oh you need
[1:18:50] to follow this guy you need to follow
[1:18:51] this person you need to follow this
[1:18:53] teaching you need no no no you need to
[1:18:55] follow the word Paul says follow me as I
[1:18:59] follow Christ amen praise God so he says
[1:19:03] here uh being uh at Calvary that all of
[1:19:07] God's promises was made possible to
[1:19:09] every human being that would accept it
[1:19:13] when Jesus died to clear the human
[1:19:16] before God at Calvary I believe that
[1:19:18] every man in the world was saved when
[1:19:22] Jesus died at Calvary but now it's a
[1:19:26] finished work now the thing to do is can
[1:19:30] we get the people to see it and accept
[1:19:33] it you see that's our
[1:19:36] part therefore Divine Healing doesn't
[1:19:39] lay upon some magic something that
[1:19:42] someone has in their hands or some holy
[1:19:45] oil or water that they sprinkle on the
[1:19:49] people I do not believe in those things
[1:19:51] I believe that the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:19:54] is is sufficient for everything we have
[1:19:57] need of see and I believe it's something
[1:20:01] has already been paid
[1:20:05] for amen praise God forever more let's
[1:20:09] go to the next
[1:20:13] slide let the brothers get
[1:20:16] ready so now that we understand who we
[1:20:21] are we understand what he's done can we
[1:20:25] go to the Lord's Supper a little
[1:20:28] different can we approach him a little
[1:20:31] different here tonight knowing

[1:38:09] situations we're human beings we're no
[1:38:13] different than anybody else but we've
[1:38:14] got a we've got an
[1:38:18] antidote and you just got to take the
[1:38:20] antidote you know it's like it's like
[1:38:22] the the the the uh prisoner that was in
[1:38:26] prison and the president had written a
[1:38:28] uh a statement to set him free it was a
[1:38:31] pardon that that you know because the
[1:38:34] the family went and said my son is
[1:38:35] innocent he's innocent but that you know
[1:38:38] that that individual had been so scarred
[1:38:41] with all the trials and all the mocking
[1:38:43] and all the people saying You're a
[1:38:45] murderer you did it you did it and he
[1:38:48] got so so depressed and so caught into
[1:38:51] the into the sin of the moment and then
[1:38:54] you know the family went to the
[1:38:55] president and the president saw his case
[1:38:57] and said I'm going to give him a pardon
[1:38:59] and he wrote the pardon and he says take
[1:39:01] it down to him and when they went to
[1:39:03] give it to him he he totally rejected
[1:39:06] them he said get away from me he he was
[1:39:09] he was so caught in his sin and unbelief
[1:39:11] he was so miserable he'd gotten into
[1:39:14] such a place because of the you know the
[1:39:16] scars and the and the hurts and all the
[1:39:18] pain that he didn't accept the
[1:39:21] pardon and they ended up having to put
[1:39:25] him to
[1:39:26] death and then the president had to come
[1:39:30] out and say listen a pardon is not a
[1:39:33] pardon unless the individual accepts and
[1:39:37] receives the pardon you need to accept
[1:39:41] that Christ paid in
[1:39:44] full glory to God Amen go to the next
