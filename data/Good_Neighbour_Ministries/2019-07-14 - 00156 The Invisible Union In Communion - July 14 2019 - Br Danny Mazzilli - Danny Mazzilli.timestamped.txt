[0:08] presentations and I said John 5:1 4:00
[0:26] p.m. on Friday afternoon and so they
[0:29] gave us another big check
[0:40] here comes the victory stop here we go
[0:44] this is this because right up until
[0:47] right up until Friday I didn't know how
[0:52] I was getting there yet because the
[0:54] pressure and it was just so much going
[0:58] on all at the same time and it just
[1:00] everything was coming from every side
[1:02] and it was just unbelievable but then
[1:05] you know Friday after the dinner we do
[1:28] whatever we can do and make sure you're
[1:31] doing your best all thought wants is for
[1:33] you to just give your best even under
[1:36] the fears of pressure just still just
[1:38] keep your best you know you're gonna
[1:44] make the stage don't worry get up to eat
[1:47] your best God is going to do his part in
[1:50] darkness and so and then it just went
[1:53] from there you know it just kept and
[1:55] then it was just one blessing after the
[1:58] other blessing after blessing Holy
[2:00] Spirit just
[2:01] part of the state for people so I'm very
[2:05] grateful for that you're going to get a
[2:07] five-minute or maybe go ahead
[2:36] you want to explain what's happening
[2:40] all I see the elevator okay are well so
[2:46] at the beginning there you saw the
[2:48] sanctuary that's that's the sanctuary
[2:50] and everybody will be through services
[2:53] these are the areas right above the
[2:56] sanctuary and to the very back they have
[2:59] learned all the young people compete and
[3:02] serve downstairs outside the sanctuary
[3:05] they bring all the girls up this is
[3:07] where they were actually doing their
[3:09] their banners because we had it wasn't
[3:12] seven teams of eight teams that we had
[3:15] this year total of about 95 96 youth
[3:21] huge and so there was banners that were
[3:27] made they all had the paint your old
[3:28] banners you can see the creativity in
[3:31] these banners it all basically got to
[3:35] choose from certain themes based on the
[3:40] names
[3:59] [Music]
[4:09] [Music]
[4:38] [Music]
[4:49] actually some ministers in design
[5:15] 23 year old young man married designed
[5:20] for the purpose of ministering to the
[5:24] young people of this generation God
[5:27] prepared that vessel he gave his
[5:30] testimony he started preaching at the
[5:33] age of 14 and he grew up under the
[5:44] basically brought up by his grandmother
[5:47] this Angela's parents were golden family
[5:53] just a filmer appeal is the skits
[6:00] overdone which were really good
[6:26] [Music]
[6:40] [Music]
[7:13] [Music]
[7:21] songs for food song services and they
[7:25] were real
[7:33] [Music]
[8:16] I've never seen a creature that could
[8:18] preach without taking a breath I'm not
[8:23] you know this brother would go through
[8:26] 30 minutes tonight obviously breathe
[8:30] literally for like 20 to 30 minutes he
[8:34] could go without stopping with the
[8:37] thought process by which he was gifted
[8:40] to bring the word and never lost his
[8:42] train of thought stayed right in line
[8:44] with the thought that was coming and you
[8:47] would think that you know you would miss
[8:49] it but actually the wave was coming you
[8:52] know I asked some of the young people in
[8:53] this emoticon like because he would stay
[8:56] on it in such a way that would just keep
[8:58] moving and keep holding that thought and
[9:00] it would just get cooked right into
[9:02] their heart boom to second father back
[9:05] in the revelation that God was talking
[9:10] so it really is a remarkable gift
[9:22] [Music]
[9:32] [Music]
[9:54] [Music]
[10:00] [Music]
[10:08] [Music]
[10:19] [Music]
[10:31] they said a song it was a song for us to
[10:35] sing and not ever say their song
[10:37] probably rates the sickness song this
[10:40] song goes like this
[10:42] [Music]
[10:58] [Music]
[11:04] [Music]
[11:12] [Music]
[11:43] [Music]
[12:10] just got all caught up beginning and I'm
[12:13] going to you in that atmosphere that was
[12:15] there only just it was special it was
[12:19] just special and I'm just so glad to be
[12:21] a part of it and you should be very glad
[12:28] [Music]
[12:30] because our children they are the Lord
[12:37] tarries so what just continue to break
[12:43] them believe that God is going to
[12:48] continue the work that our lives because
[12:52] after the camp they still got to go back
[12:54] and they got a good deal of money and
[12:56] they got a deal with the peer pressure
[12:58] and they got to deal with you know the
[13:00] struggles one there was a word that was
[13:03] placed in them that can rise up it's the
[13:08] standard that's how God raises his
[13:10] standard in our lives he gives us his
[13:12] word and that is our staff
[13:17] praise God well this morning we're going
[13:21] to be ministering not very long we're
[13:24] going to be doing the Lord's Supper
[13:25] today but the Lord did give me a thought
[13:28] that we want to just bring and you know
[13:32] the title this morning is the invisible
[13:35] union now in community so there's
[13:39] there's something that's taking place in
[13:41] this pane in this hour
[13:42] that is drawing the people together
[13:45] under a revelation of what God is doing
[13:48] in this day at this hour it's very
[13:51] important for people to recognize that
[13:54] God is not a dead God he's not a dog
[13:57] he's a living God present present he's
[14:02] still moving along with the prophecy of
[14:05] his word but there were prophecies that
[14:07] were given for this baby for this hour
[14:09] that must come to pass and we can never
[14:13] disregard by getting caught up in
[14:17] traditions into you know organized
[14:23] religion they are not organized we are
[14:27] in the autumn of Jesus Christ we are
[14:30] living church body of Jesus Christ and
[14:34] it is the book of acts in continuation
[14:37] it's still doing everything that started
[14:40] back to the book of Acts when the first
[14:42] Christian Church
[14:43] went into that upper room and we see the
[14:45] Holy Ghost and came out speaking in
[14:47] different tongues and
[14:49] languages and get people to understand
[14:52] was because God was starting to move
[14:54] that was going to restore the church
[14:56] back to its original condition back to
[15:00] Eve again remember Jesus Christ Adam and
[15:04] Eve Jesus and the church Christ and his
[15:08] bride God the Father and his children
[15:10] it's all the same thing
[15:12] it's all just evicted in different forms
[15:16] and types everything that happened in
[15:18] the dark Medina was all a prophecy of
[15:21] things that were to come the book of
[15:23] Genesis is the book of beginnings is the
[15:26] seed book it's where everything had its
[15:28] beginning and there's a prophecy that's
[15:31] written into the book and it's all
[15:34] coming to pass everything that was going
[15:37] to take place from from the start to the
[15:41] beginning of God's plan of redemption
[15:43] that which God saw in his mind he placed
[15:47] it all into that one book of Genesis did
[15:49] you know that but yet if you played it
[15:52] out in all the 66 books of the Bible a
[15:55] just kind of showing himself Jesus
[15:57] Christ the same yesterday today and
[15:59] forever Joe hold out of the Old
[16:01] Testament
[16:02] Jesus of the New Testament it's all God
[16:04] Jesus God Jesus is the Lord Jesus is
[16:08] Jehovah
[16:11] maybe Jesus needs so you've got all
[16:13] kinds of different teachings up there
[16:16] about religion about Christianity there
[16:19] is only one Christianity there is not
[16:24] 3500 different than ama national
[16:27] teachings of Christianity we need to get
[16:30] this straight if we need it we want to
[16:32] come to God that we're gonna need to
[16:34] come God's provided wait you're not
[16:36] saying oh you're a church that has the
[16:39] truth if you don't come to this church
[16:40] you're going into tribulation that's not
[16:43] what we're saying
[16:44] we're saying that there is only aren't
[16:46] true that that is the Word of God and
[16:47] that the Bible that God's Word be truth
[16:50] and that every man's word be alive
[16:52] but jesus said I said to the comforter
[16:56] which is the Holy Ghost and he will
[16:59] guide you into all now it's important to
[17:04] get the Holy Ghost that's why they live
[17:07] into the upper room he's still the same
[17:09] yesterday Reaper he does it the same way
[17:11] he has not changed everything remains
[17:14] the same because he is the same they saw
[17:20] with me this morning
[17:22] very well amen praise God because we
[17:24] want to just you know be like what we're
[17:26] going to communion today but yet there's
[17:29] an invisible union that has brought us
[17:32] into this
[17:33] very much and this invisible union is
[17:36] the Holy Ghost in you leading you and
[17:39] guide you into all truth
[17:44] you see there's certain things that you
[17:47] that if you are really born again and
[17:51] you are Christian that there's no way
[17:54] you cannot be buried into the water not
[17:59] this tank you people really contrary are
[18:02] baptized what they're about Kaiser who
[18:04] year hot tub and all the people it's
[18:07] irrelevant
[18:07] all right it's the symbolic outward
[18:11] expression of something that has taken
[18:14] place on the inside and that's why when
[18:17] he was being told about about Christ and
[18:20] about the baptism in the name of the
[18:22] Lord Jesus Christ the moment he came
[18:24] across water he says look stop this now
[18:27] right now for the baptized me right now
[18:29] because he realized that something that
[18:32] taken place on the inside and I wanted
[18:34] to take you to be expressed somebody
[18:37] goes and gets baptized they are being
[18:39] buried baptism means to be buried into
[18:43] the water just like you were dying into
[18:46] a break and then being risen up into the
[18:49] mists of life and that all either stays
[18:52] buried
[18:53] and drowned in that water
[18:57] and that is the born-again experience
[18:59] that's written is it's not you brought
[19:01] up there honey that's not what this we
[19:05] are not religious people we don't drive
[19:09] Jesus down equal strokes we are sons and
[19:15] daughters of God that have recognized
[19:17] who we are and then it requires
[19:20] receiving the Holy Ghost in order for
[19:23] him to lead us and guide us into all
[19:25] truth
[19:25] sort of when you testify to somebody
[19:28] just like they did in the book of Acts
[19:30] listen everything you want a little out
[19:32] of the church operates just go back to
[19:34] the point about right even look at any
[19:37] cost
[19:37] acts 2:38 do they receive the Holy Ghost
[19:40] they came down and they were speaking to
[19:43] the people that were destined finder the
[19:44] people you need to receive all the
[19:47] ghosts this is what they were saying
[19:49] because look we ask in acts 2:38 what
[19:52] shall we do in order to receive this
[19:56] Holy Ghost
[19:57] you're talking about wait he said Peter
[20:02] Peter not never Peter who's with Jesus
[20:07] says we every one of you and be baptized
[20:13] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[20:17] your sins and this promise is
[20:27] [Music]
[20:35] this is the way this year's the pork
[20:37] chop if you want that you if you've got
[20:39] an attribute of you that can respond to
[20:42] the Word of God in other words if your
[20:44] son or daughter of doctors never attack
[20:45] you we're not eternal means having to be
[20:54] giving in the land but what you did was
[20:57] you came to the spiritual I need you to
[20:58] come into this body and you come into
[21:01] this vessel that you're living in this
[21:02] earth and you're going to a baby's body
[21:05] and you know you've got to come through
[21:07] all these traditions and all these
[21:09] upgrades and all you know your
[21:11] generational teachings of your parents
[21:14] and all whatever it was but then the
[21:15] word comes to you and now if that if you
[21:18] were a son or daughter of God
[21:20] you always work then you hear this word
[21:23] you hear the truth is Jesus and the
[21:25] truth will set you free you hear this
[21:28] truth and all of a sudden your risible
[21:32] you know think understand i could have a
[21:35] thousand testimonies you know from all
[21:37] the people right here we might have a
[21:40] hundred testimonies of people that can
[21:42] tell when God revealed himself to them
[21:45] how they were enlightened by the Word of
[21:48] God to see truth and actually look into
[21:51] the word and see the baptism is clear as
[21:53] an awesome oh my god I got baptized as a
[21:56] baby
[21:56] I can't repent 25 years ago this one and
[22:06] I'm looking at I've seen I couldn't be
[22:09] kept as a baby and then
[22:13] when they baptized in the Catholic
[22:15] Church I see how they do it's in the
[22:16] name of the Father the Son the Holy
[22:18] Spirit and there's a Trinitarian
[22:21] teaching title and all of a sudden they
[22:25] just didn't make sense
[22:27] but this makes sense of working sense
[22:30] and when you will make a word their
[22:37] minds up to a revelation of God I was
[22:44] godly people would come to be say you
[22:48] need to go to church on Saturdays I said
[23:07] listen I said God wants me he can come
[23:11] talk to me itself just like that shut
[23:17] right down wasn't too long after that
[23:26] and now
[23:30] [Music]
[23:40] God comes you there's an invisible unit
[23:45] let's read the scripture it's from
[23:48] [Music]
[23:59] what was dr. 7 verse 4 says wherefore my
[24:04] brethren ye also are become dead to the
[24:06] law by the body of Christ that ye should
[24:11] be married to another even to him who is
[24:15] raised from the dead that we should
[24:17] bring forth fruit unto God just that
[24:20] scripture goal is everything I talked
[24:22] about everything I've talked about he
[24:26] says my brother ye also are become dead
[24:28] to the law by the body price in other
[24:31] words all that you're thinking all your
[24:34] traditions everything that you thought
[24:36] was was was true
[24:38] everything religions all these different
[24:41] interpretations are not once you haven't
[24:43] come into the body of Christ
[24:45] you are completely liberated and you
[24:49] receive truth that truly set you free we
[24:53] go down to verse 10 and it says that if
[24:57] Christ be in you the body is dead
[25:01] because of sin in other words this isn't
[25:06] this isn't what God has redeemed God's
[25:11] not redeeming you as a human God is big
[25:14] Dini is all his attributes he's bringing
[25:19] back sons and daughters of God so sin
[25:23] now it's dead no longer has a control
[25:28] over your life anymore it's just
[25:31] remarkable but the Spirit is life
[25:34] the Spirit is life because of
[25:39] righteousness because of Christ because
[25:41] everything that God does is it's good
[25:43] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[25:46] Jesus from the dead
[25:48] well you he that raised up Christ from
[25:53] the dentist of the Holy Spirit Christ
[25:56] himself his anointing his power lovely
[26:02] new even reason impressively dead shall
[26:05] also quicken your mortal bodies by the
[26:08] spirit that dwelleth in you so it's
[26:11] telling us that you're gonna be changed
[26:13] from this mortal body that's why he's
[26:15] not redeeming your or the lot therefore
[26:20] brethren we are debtors not to the flesh
[26:23] it's not good in other words we're not
[26:25] to be controlled by the flesh we're not
[26:28] to be under the bondage of the flesh we
[26:32] need to understand what this is what
[26:35] sickness is as we try to tell you you're
[26:38] not to be under the body
[26:41] sickness example flesh it attacks the
[26:45] flesh but we are not to become of a
[26:47] bondage of that right because of the
[26:49] spirit that dwells in us right
[26:51] and so therefore whether we're we are
[26:54] debtors not to the flesh to live after
[26:57] the flesh for if you live after the
[26:59] flesh if all you're looking at is my
[27:03] life but your revelation you should be
[27:13] that the Spirit that dwelleth in me
[27:15] shall overcome shall heal this father
[27:18] shall bring it under subjection to what
[27:21] the word says not what the world says I
[27:26] don't want the doctors before
[27:29] to tell me that I've got cancer the Word
[27:33] of God said I will work on all of this
[27:37] so I'm going to place that on and over
[27:41] the doctor's report right I'm not gonna
[27:44] redo the doctor he's doing his job he's
[27:47] doing what he has to do but the Word of
[27:50] God says different and if it's my time
[27:53] to go according to that way because in
[28:25] the peoples on here but through the
[28:29] spirit do mortify the deeds of the body
[28:32] even in other words to allow the Spirit
[28:35] of God in you not your will God's Word
[28:40] to to prayer through dedication and
[28:44] through you know discipline by applying
[28:47] the Word of God Keeper
[28:49] you will bounce to take control amen
[28:54] for as many as are led by the Spirit of
[28:56] God they are the sons of God see
[28:59] everything we're just saying for him not
[29:02] received the spirit of bondage again to
[29:04] fear but he received the spirit of
[29:07] adoption whereby we cry
[29:10] adoption we've got a complete series on
[29:12] that about how God is placing you giving
[29:16] you a position in the body has given you
[29:18] a gift to operate in the body once you
[29:21] take that position once you allow a gift
[29:24] to operate through you and you do all
[29:26] that God has shown you according to the
[29:29] faith that God gives you you can
[29:31] actually be a powerhouse in the body of
[29:34] Christ you become nfie
[29:36] you become an encourage you become like
[29:39] you know something that nourishes the
[29:42] body of Christ all because you've come
[29:44] into your adoption the spirit itself
[29:46] bears witness with our spirit that we
[29:48] are the children and if children then
[29:52] heirs heirs of God but these are
[29:58] powerful words there but let's let's
[30:00] let's populate what we're eating here
[30:02] heirs of God sons of God amen praise God
[30:08] and if children then heirs heirs of God
[30:11] and joint-heirs with Christ
[30:15] imagine so he's saved on put you right
[30:18] next to me not whatever you say if you
[30:22] say to this mountain if you say to this
[30:25] sickness if you say to this situation
[30:28] all of your work because you have a
[30:31] revelation of who you are as a son or a
[30:35] daughter of God simple look very
[30:38] powerful that we are the truth and
[30:41] Affairs two years of the Christ insult
[30:43] be that we suffer with him that we may
[30:46] also glorify them together be glorified
[30:50] together so what do you think it's going
[30:53] to be a bed of roses it's not you will
[30:57] suffer with him but better to suffer
[31:00] with him
[31:03] there's a lot of people suffering out
[31:05] there don't go to them and you try to
[31:07] you know you try to you try to help them
[31:10] you know keep you away get away too much
[31:19] more you can only introduce them to what
[31:23] God has done for you for I reckon that
[31:27] the sufferings of this present time are
[31:29] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[31:31] which shall be even us so the creature
[31:40] was being subject to vanity not
[31:43] willingly but by reason of him who have
[31:46] subjected the same people because the
[31:49] creature itself also shall be delivered
[31:52] from the bondage of corruption into the
[31:54] glorious ability of children of God for
[31:58] we know that the whole creation groaneth
[32:00] and travaileth in pain together until
[32:03] now near the final stages as bodies is
[32:08] travailing it's over covenants were in
[32:12] communion it's an invisible communion
[32:14] it's an invisible
[32:16] there's a there's a struggle within the
[32:18] body to come together and it's quoting
[32:21] if there's your situations and and you
[32:24] know about that and not only they but
[32:27] ourselves also you got to count
[32:29] ourselves into that we're growing we're
[32:32] all a part of that which have the
[32:34] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[32:37] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[32:39] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[32:42] of our body let's pray father we thank
[32:46] you so much this morning Lord we've read

[37:25] why is God giving us such faith in Aries
[37:29] why is not testing us in these areas why
[37:33] because this is the final culmination
[37:37] remember that capsule
[37:41] we had a profit that came and told us
[37:43] clearly you will not get in there on
[37:47] their own
[37:48] you're not going to do it by your own
[37:50] works you have to do it in Harrogate buy
[37:53] buy buy buy my spirit it'll take my
[37:57] spirit in you
[37:58] it'll take grooming it'll take some
[38:01] suffering God does deal with our
[38:03] characters gotta move and shape us and
[38:06] break us if he has to break us in
[38:08] whatever way and then he'll know that
[38:11] sometimes it's painful it's painful we
[38:15] pass to deal and mold and shape us and
[38:17] doing us but but it's it's all for a
[38:20] purpose and God indicates that God comes
[38:23] in he'll send a minister through and the
[38:25] computer program he says I was going to
[38:27] treat something different
[38:29] I had a totally different message but
[38:31] the Lord and the precipice upon
[38:35] understanding of symbiotic relationships
[38:39] I'm just you know because I can see them
[38:44] that how the might of God is purity his
[38:48] children company is keeping us
[38:54] [Music]

[39:14] such a way when you receive that word
[39:16] when you accept it you say be done to me
[39:20] according to thy word OPA and let that
[39:23] we have an effect on you don't worry
[39:25] that demon has to lead that power that
[39:29] control it cannot state must
[39:35] chickenshits word God's Word is truth
[39:39] [Music]
[39:44] absolutely he's done and you are
[39:47] liberated and you are free but some
[39:49] people will stay in that bondage and
[39:51] stay under that chain of circumstance
[39:54] will allow certain situations that
[39:56] people hold on their lives but no God
[39:59] says a relationship is a mutual
[40:03] relationship where both men and when you
[40:06] could look at the situation you can see
[40:08] on both betterment you're liberated he
[40:12] blessed you strengthened very much
[40:14] amen or it got the message on Wednesday
[40:19] that and I was bust on how the Holy
[40:22] Spirit is expedient that you understand
[40:25] and recognize that the Holy Spirit is in
[40:27] you that he's the one that is overcoming
[40:29] in you that you are an overcomer because
[40:32] of your recognizing who you are and it's
[40:35] all part of the by the duck bring us to
[40:38] a recognition of who we are so that we
[40:41] can stand in our post with authority we
[40:45] can stand around positions with
[40:47] authority without allowing any power or
[40:50] any influence wonderful blessed praise
[40:54] God brother Branham speaking here in the
[40:56] invisible union of the private price it
[40:59] is speaking about this age speaking
[41:01] about where we're at
[41:02] it will receive with it and he says here
[41:05] he says I am thankful to God to be
[41:08] living in this time of the closing
[41:11] scenes of this phone system now he was
[41:15] here in fact apparently this was back in
[41:17] 1965 and he was seeing how things were
[41:22] coming together in the world of
[41:24] prophecies word word will be fulfilled
[41:26] all around him and he goes on he says
[41:29] I'm so glad we seen this I don't know if
[41:32] I would have had a facial before the
[41:36] foundations of the world and God
[41:42] to me and said to me I want you to reach
[41:46] and now what age do you desire to go to
[41:51] the earth to preach for the bestest I
[41:55] would've chose this age for I think this
[41:58] is you know that age is now right here
[42:14] brother bad news got off the scene but
[42:17] the word that was dropped for the
[42:19] prophecy that he spoke the age that he
[42:22] was talking about remember he was seeing
[42:24] all these prophetic events how the
[42:26] church is gonna get you lined up how God
[42:29] had his advice on the scene of Israel's
[42:32] back into her homeland how it was things
[42:36] going on on the earth that were actually
[42:40] expressing the fulfillment of God's find
[42:44] the combination of calling a bride now
[42:49] the church the victory from the church
[42:52] with this day in this hour if we go back
[42:55] we look at certain victories and how God
[42:59] got you know started to bring the church
[43:02] into its fullness which is what were
[43:04] anything into now we can go back to the
[43:08] book of Acts like you said and the Holy
[43:10] Spirit came down on the day of Pentecost
[43:12] but that all continued it all went
[43:14] through the dark ages
[43:16] remember the enemy which is the devil
[43:19] has always been there trying to stop the
[43:23] plan enough he didn't in the garden he
[43:27] was a serpent in the garden is
[43:30] the surface channel that's been running
[43:32] all the way through there's always been
[43:34] an advocate there's always the enemy
[43:36] that's trying to stop God's plan God's
[43:39] purpose of God's program but he can't
[43:41] stop it and Saints been always trying to
[43:44] get to the church to disbelieve the work
[43:47] but yet here now become if we come hope
[43:50] we come through the Dark Ages and how
[43:52] the Christians they have the dot they
[43:54] had to give their lives I was all part
[43:56] of building up the body it's all part of
[44:00] milling about Luther you know he
[44:02] received a revelation from God he was a
[44:05] Catholic at the time in the Catholic
[44:08] Church at least and he was one of the
[44:11] sweetest word secret revelation from God
[44:13] that the just shall live by faith and
[44:16] that was the beginning of the
[44:18] Reformation that was when God was going
[44:21] to break the way down from from a man
[44:24] controlled because the Pope's they
[44:26] basically whatever the Pope said that
[44:29] was what the people wanted the Pope says
[44:31] you pay money people in the purgatory
[44:33] out he died that you get free to heaven
[44:36] the people said that how much because
[44:40] that's how they got to see but that's
[44:44] not what the word said he said I think
[44:47] you got a good old experience and
[44:50] relationship with me and so Luther broke
[44:55] away from the church because of that
[44:57] revelation and started that's why
[45:03] and from what he receives a revelation
[45:08] for the dog yeah if I think we also need
[45:12] to have a sanctified life you can't be
[45:15] living like that smoking drinking gene
[45:17] and lying and stealing everything else
[45:19] and say that you're a Christian and that
[45:20] you can just don't need to sanctify your
[45:23] life and Wesley that's why the
[45:25] Presbyterian Church was all about and
[45:35] they had Trinitarian teaching and you
[45:38] know that's what he did you and you
[45:48] trying to talk about Jesus Christ
[45:50] they say if you make him the Son of God
[45:52] God is perhaps not as we say that Jesus
[45:58] Christ is not he came down in a human
[46:01] vessel a manatee he'd come down the Word
[46:04] was made flesh and dwelt above the
[46:07] southeast Jesus Christ coming God coming
[46:10] down into a human body to express
[46:13] himself so he could go as a human to
[46:15] come to taking the place and so all of
[46:19] that was all in the program of God here
[46:22] in Luther grates away
[46:23] away all the servers would never be
[46:25] viable because without the spirit he got
[46:29] all truth and those spirit jesus said
[46:32] spirit and truth spirit and truth so you
[46:37] need the ball all of a sudden here comes
[46:39] the Holy Spirit at Pentecost 1906 and a
[46:43] constant movement Azusa Street and now
[46:46] he thought was called the Pentecostal
[46:47] movie because some things have gotten
[46:49] millions and millions of people that are
[46:52] Pentecostal and but the word didn't stop
[46:55] there
[46:56] in kept progressing and God house says a
[46:59] 20th century prophet people say go back
[47:07] to be no 66 books were adopted use a man
[47:11] filled with the spirit adopted the Word
[47:13] of God for that day God the sign of the
[47:16] scent of Gentile minister by the name of
[47:19] William Branham to bring the Word of God
[47:21] to this generation because it was going
[47:24] to show himself that there was going to
[47:26] be a church called out of all the
[47:27] churches and that there would be a
[47:29] revelation because
