TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] another wednesday evening and here we are again o praise god glory and honor and adoration be to his marvelous and wonderful name we are here with another lesson from the seven church ages and this is entitled the doctrine of the nicolaitans praise god our scripture is found in revelation chapter 2 reading verse 15 alone so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nickelodeons which thing i hate i reiterate so has thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nickelodeon's rich thing i hate let us pray lord jesus great and sovereign lord king of kings lord of lords the almighty god we place ourselves within your hands and ask for divine utterance and direction of the mind and of the heart that we might be led into the paths of righteousness that we may be led into the paths you have ordained for us to go bringing light to the nations wherever they are shine your bright and shining light into the hearts of men and women here today oh god there are no boundaries with you no countries no borders with you but thy word goes forth lord god and run it swiftly to accomplish what you have lord god ordained for us for it to do so we give you glory praise and honor in jesus name amen and amen praise god hallelujah praise god wednesday evening and the doctrine of the nicolaitans of course we know the word doctrine doctore comes from teaching it means teaching right praise god so here it is the teaching or doctrine of the nickel lydians now you may have remembered before we talked just in a brief way on this how nico comes from saint nicholas that was back there and nicole that part of the word nico comes from nico las nico which means in greek to conquer nico means to conquer conquer the laity conquering the laity and here we find uh lao meaning laity meaning conquering the laity or the teaching on how to conquer control and dominate the laity of the church this is what we are here to speak about today nickelodeonism past nickelodeon present nickelodeonism future for it's here in the word of god now we know that god has never placed the leadership of his church into the hands of elected leadership god has never placed this church let me repeat into the hands of elected leadership elected pastors elected uh you know bishops elected whatever supervisor superintendents elected by numbers or whatever god has not did not place his church in the basis of elected leadership now we want just briefly mentioned matathias in the book of acts how that they tried to elect even the apostles write it and it wasn't wrong it was not god's will paul was supposed to be the next one to fill that gap but they ran ahead of god and they had lots drawn from atathias and his name is never mentioned again nothing ever told about them no accomplishments whatsoever but god spoke and used paul for his glory so god has never placed his church in the hands of elected leadership moving with political maneuvers and political actions and political mindedness in the way they act instead god has set in the church book of ephesians god has set in the church the various ministries that are supposed to be there god ordained and spirit-filled word living men and women men that will preach and declare the word of god through feeding the people on the bread of life which is the word of god itself and god also has never separated his people by classes or into classes but now what do we find the masses of people are led by a so-called holy priesthood we we agree and believe that the ministers ought to live holy lives but also so must the congregation live holy lives in the presence of almighty god hallelujah and the priest and the people ought to be worshipping god together there is no place where god separated the worship of the priests or the worship of the minister from the worship of the people it's all one worship and adoration and glory to the marvelous name of our lord and god wants us to love him and serve him together and we are all brothers whether i am the minister or someone else is the minister we are all brothers in jesus christ god has just placed me in this position of leadership to declare his word and so my brothers we must recognize that the god has no higher order no higher position than a than the genuine god sent holy spirit anointed minister of the gospel no higher authority is above that minister but jesus christ himself now nickelodeonism of course destroys those precepts and practices of god's genuine word and it instead separates the ministers separates the priests from the people and makes them of the lords makes them overlords instead of causing them to be servants now of course this didn't come out of nowhere uh we have been tracing and showing you how that spirit of nimrod of organizing in battalions and forming the first army and and stuff of that nature and assist various systems of conquering and that now has come into the spiritual realm down through various governments armies whether it's rome or whatever and now it's here in the spiritual form conquering and trying to conquer and dominate everywhere that it goes now this doctrine actually reared its snake-like head in the first age [Music] and the problem lay in the use of two words mainly elders and bishops now their thought was uh a bishop is higher than an elder and and and they they placed it like two offices in the church not realizing what it really was teaching the idea that a bishop has preeminence and has authority and control over elders which truth of course is not in the word of god today it's not in the word of god at any time you will not find it there for we know that the word elder signifies the chronological age of that person right in the lord and in their walk with god in their life elder only speaks of chronological age in the lord that's what the man is he's just an elder that's what he is and bishop is the office position of the man of course according to the bible the word bishop actually means pastor or shepherd it's not different but they have placed the word bishop as to make it someone higher than the pastor higher than the elder and someone who exerts preeminence authority and control that of course is a man-made idea implanted and inserted within the word of god for it is not found in your bible the man is called an elder because he's been a seasoned in the presence of the lord ripened by the word of god hallelujah trained by the holy spirit of almighty god and under the heart of the son of the sign of leo the land the land of the tribe of judah that same son that writes the fruit in august is the same s o n that shines upon the son of god and sons and daughters of god to write them in their experience and in their walk with god hallelujah amen so when the word elders use it means one that is not a novice one that is not new or johnny come lately no but one that's been around for a while and has been steeped like like tea if i might say that steeped in the spirit in the word the wine of the holy ghost hallelujah and their life has imbibed praise god and taken in the influences of the holy spirit upon them amen praise god so he's called an elder not because he's elected to that position or ordained into that position but because he is just older elder just means he's just older and he's been around with god and in the word for a longer time the message for a longer time amen praise god hallelujah amen so we find out my brothers and sisters that we were completely overlooking the word of god hallelujah and to them they believe that a bishop has extended authority in other words he's not a pastor that's how they're thinking that's not the word of god they think the pastor has local authority in his local area but neglectionism teaches that the bishop has power over pastors and his power extends to various parishes various countries various provinces various states whatever and and his powers are over arching power and so they believe the bishop having a higher power not realizing and recognizing that even at 18 years old timothy was already a bishop and bishop just meaning that he was the pastor of that church praise god and but in his church there were elders that were older than he was uh praise god but he was the pastor by his office he was the bishop by his office doesn't mean he has power over churches everywhere like that no but it means that he was the pastor over his church there for the glory of god so friends we see clearly in the word of god amen that many of these people or so-called bishops leaned towards organization and what started as a deed in the first age became a teaching or a doctrine as we as time moved on to this day and to this hour bishops so-called bishops are claiming power authority preeminence and control over men and they believe they can deal with men as their desire they believe they can take one preacher or priest from this diocese or from this a part of his church or this place where he is or take him out of a certain church and place whoever they wish in there and throw that man aside as an old shoe or place him in some secondary place as they wish they believe that's their power to place them wherever they will in ministry and when they do that they're denying the power of the holy spirit himself amen the god of the bible who said into the apostles separate me paul and barnabas for the work where unto i have called them so god would separate his own men separate them and anoint them for the task at hand that's the work of god sons and daughters of god not led by the bishop led by the pope but led by the holy spirit amen sons and daughters of god are led by the holy spirit as god leads them and guides them for his glory of course we know that everything separate contrary to that is anti-word anti-god anti-christ amen matthew chapter 20 verses 25 to 28 jesus spoke speaking to his disciples said you know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion domination over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them listen to this but it shall not be so amongst you for whosoever will be great among you let him be your servant amen let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered onto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many o praise be to god so god has called the man of god the pastors ministers to be your brothers in christ just like you are only we did not ask for this position we did not ask for this leadership we did not ask to be made to a preacher a priest or whatever we we didn't ask for it but god by his divine calling of his holy spirit not by his mother's asking him to become a preacher not by his father not by some bishop not by somebody else no but the holy spirit of almighty god already put the mark of a minister upon that person god anoints them with his divine holy spirit god vindicates them by the power of the holy ghost amen amen and man is only used to confirm what god has already placed inside of that person oh blessed be the name of the living god amen praise god listen matthew 23 verses 8 to 9 be not ye called rabbi that's like being not ye called father be not you called rabbi you know what people go around calling you oh father this father father that father the other listen to jesus himself listen to how the word of god is totally disobeyed pushed aside and given no no confidence no relevance and simply slipped it on the people and they accepted and believe it not knowing what the word of god says i repeat be not ye called rabbi for one is your master even christ and all you all you are brethren amen and call no men your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven god is not speaking of your natural father he's speaking spiritually call no man amen father amen praise god father this father that father dominic father whatever you are to call no man father and it's in the book it's in the word of god amen for you only have one father and that father is the lord himself who is in heaven revelation 13 3 speaks about nicoletanism and describes it as the beast whose head was wounded unto death revelation 13 verse 3 and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the beast we're looking in the word of god and we're seeing friends how that the old pagan roman imperial roman empire was wounded unto death and how it was able to transform itself rome the imperial power which was a great political world power and how it experience uh a spiritual resurrection from the dead as it were one day unto death but resurrected and transformed pagan imperial political rome transformed itself from being a military and political world power to people or papal rome a spiritual religious and political world power from natural to spiritual now remember this is all going on from the teachings of the nicolasians of course rome's basis of her military success was based on the thought of divide and conquer now that precept that teaching prevails today amongst governments nations of the world still base themselves on that thought that idea that seed from satan that was planted divide and conquer within each country that goes on within each uh part of the world that goes on divide and conquer if you can split races against races of people uh weaken both sides then so you can come out as the power or whatever but that's goes into the realm of politics that goes into every round it permeates the entire earth or dirt that the iron and clay was supposed to be mixed and here we find their thought of divide and conquer that seed of satan and so with her iron teeth the legions of rome marched they trampled and destroyed conquered everywhere they went the eagle of of the legions of rome went everywhere conquering everywhere that they went and then she destroyed carthage according to history she destroyed carthage completely praise god and then that same spirit that iron hard cruel iron spirit can move now from natural to spiritual but it continued with its uh pillaging and its destruction in the same way raising up as a false church with the same spirit and anointing upon her to divide and conquer and her to this day her policy remains the same for out of her is what came all the denominations that are out there is the same top principle divide and conquer and her policy remains the same and that is what the bible describes scribes as nicole latianism how to conquer and control the laity not by controlling the body but so much controlling the mind and spirit by false doctrine false teachings contrary to the word of god and control this exercise over not millions but billions around the world being controlled by this teaching of necro-lithianism and the bible tells us in revelation 2 15 which thing i hate god hates organization god not order but god hates organization god hates their systems of control that they place within their so-called organizations to move and control the people well my friends we find that by their political powers by their thought of divide and conquer divide and dominate divide and control oh think of the word denomination just going to throw this up quickly dominate denominate denomination dominion denominational conquering and domination over the mind of men and so nickelodeonism has led the church world into politics yes this political party that political party the other political party oh and so the church is caught up today in politics and policies filled with pride and the pump of position nickelodeonism has led to jealousies in the church even hatred think of it one person believing that jesus is the christ and yet claiming hatred against their brothers their sisters in jesus christ not disagreeing not being disagree of disagreeing without being disagreeable i can disagree with you without being disagreeable and he hateful and nasty or anything like that but that's not what it is they will hate you enough to persecute you and jesus said even to kill you amen and that is the spirit of nicolasianism that has been hiding back of these skin veil of religious man and women and membership and they don't realize it until the word of god exposes it light is shined upon it and then it it rears its head and it's ready to pounce at you and come against you in every possible way neglectionism also lead to intellectualism for if i'm brighter than you and this one is brighter than the other one they can climb their way up the religious ladder and so that leads also to the spirit of competitiveness within the house of god and within this church of the living god nickelodeonism leads to all of that so when this era crept into the church and this office of the bishop began to have more and more power man started to compete and undercut subvert trick fight and in some cases even uh like in the days of martin luther paid for their position paid the higher ups so they can get a lofty position of a bishop an archbishop or or a cardinal that paid monies to get some of those positions not all of them paid but some of them literally paid for that position and so this position began to be given to those who were better educated also it was given to those whose parents mothers fathers families had more money or were materially progressive they started to give those positions like that and also to men who had they could see that the person has political talent they had political talent the ability to sway and to move men and quickly they will give them a position so they can use that talent that gift for their own purposes and for their own plans in that way human knowledge and church programs and plants began to take over instead of the leading and guidance of the holy spirit himself my friends what a tragic age and a tragic time so the holy spirit no longer was able to control his church what an evil that these bishops would take control over the people of god and they began to claim uh it's not necessary for a bishop to maintain a transparent christian character or holy christian life uh to minister the word of god you see because the host the host that they usually give to the people the holiness is in the host therefore i don't have to be holy the the priest the bishop doesn't necessarily have to be holy as long as the holiness is in the host amen that's the way they begin to think of it that the host must be considered holy so he doesn't have to be holy to minister the rights of the church the word of god or the elements of the ceremony of god amen and when they begin to talk and teach like that evil man began to creep in to the branches of this tree begin to lodge within the branches of this evil tree seducers waxing worse and worse to rend and destroy the flock of god amongst them well with this man-made doctrine of the elevation of bishops to a higher place which is not in the scripture it's not recorded anywhere in the scripture the next step from that was to begin to hand out or give out graded titles titles began to be given up within the church and soon they developed the position of the archbishop above the bishop and of course a richer more powerful more influential or more talented maybe poor but maybe talented in certain ways and his skills and talents are needed then they will now have there was cardinals began to be elevated above those arch bishops and by the time of uh bony face bony face we find that there rose up a pope over all of these cardinals and archbishops and bishops and priests and and no you know nuns and nova the the nova what you call it again they forgot the nova novites they were young and so my friends novices uh rose up above them and so now here comes a pontiff or a pope over all of this hierarchy for this was the development of a religious hierarchy not found in the word of god it is not in your bible it's a man-made man-sanctioned man-created man-positioned and placed in the church of god now with this necrolytion or this conquering or this teaching of how to dominate the world the laity and the people of the world not by military might but by religious ideas and thoughts figments traditions mythologies coming from the uh morass the swamp of the minds of men and not from the presence of almighty god spewing and spreading the slime across the face of the world with which to capture all who would step right into that now friends here we are this amalgamation of christianity with ancient babylonianism paganism with the wounded head of the beast rising again that we see the progression of mystery babylon entered into and growing in strength within the religious realm oh my you say brother simon why do you brothers preach so hard against denominationalism they are they're christians too they are brothers too well in name the in name but taking the name just taking the name and using it doesn't mean you even know what you have it's like a man holding a lion's tail or a tiger's tail and think he has a rope oh god have mercy what a day in time we're living in listen this ezekiel saw it ezekiel 8 verse 10 the prophet ezekiel speaking so i went in and saw and behold every form of creeping things he's seeing now the idols in back in all israel when they drifted away from god and god showed him how they had idols shaped like beasts idols shaped like abominable beasts and creeping things on all the idols of the house of israel not only did they have idols but they have beautiful artistic pictures of these idols on the walls listen and portrayed upon the walls around i saw oh my listen lots goes on as religious art and religious this releases that it's the same spirit moving in that way revelation 18 2 and the mighty angel came down crying with mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the greatest fallen is fallen is fallen and has become the habitation or the house of hell the house of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of our fornications i would also like to place the scripture of mark chapter 4 verses 30 to 30 flow for in which jesus foresaw this and was telling it to his disciples in a parable in which he said he saw this invasion into the church and he gave it as a part in the form of a mustard seed he said does it not grow into one of the greatest trees but then he says all mirror birds begin to come and hide or flock and roast under the shadow of christianity roost in its branches hide under that cloak and begin to use it for their own purposes read mark 4 30 your verse 34 and so these foul words [Music] you might have a a wonderful eagle seated on one branch and on the other branch is a mockingbird over on one branch you may see a beautiful hummingbird or a canary and on the other side is a nightingale oh my god have mercy over one side my friends you see one beautiful word the other side there's a buzzard oh there's a carrion crow what have mercy that's what has happened to the church of god in this day and in this hour in which we live living in and we are witnesses of these things we are living in the days of what the fulfillment of scripture the manifestation of prophecies mentioned within the word of god lord jesus have mercy upon us friends and so this nicoleton doctrine but you know thank god god always has a few he always has a witness not everybody accepted that nicolettian doctrine back there not at all and so when they went out to establish it as a rule within the church it did not hit off well with some of the genuine saints of the living god amen for they had read the epistles of paul that read the word of god and they knew the difference and what the word of god says so what did the church do what did the so-called church at that time do the false church began to excommunicate excommunicate them and also began to try to burn the scrolls and writings of all the prophets and apostles that were around and they were persecuted if they were found to have those scrolls those writings reading them you wouldn't know it because now it's just like jesus said uh today they killed the prophets and tomorrow when they realized that those were real prophets they dig them up and then they they put a beautiful around them and they begin to worship there and praise him but they're the very ones that kill them and call it a shrine now they will end up reading all those epistles and reading all the prophets but back there that killed people for reading them for believing the prophets believing these apostles and walking in the light of the word amen praise god and they begin to teach that the ordinary man should not read those scrolls or read these prophets they can't understand it it takes a special education to read and understand the word of god and you know that many years for centuries later they were putting locks on the bibles locks on the word of god lock and key locking it away from the people under the spirit of domination dominating dividing and conquering yes sir and so after taking away the word from the people it soon came to the fact that the people had to go into these so-called houses of worship and just listen to the priests listen to the minister then because they could not read the word for themselves to compare whether what he was saying is true or not true they don't even know where when he speaks in latin or greek or whatever what he's cursing or swearing they just accepted that oh it sounds holy so it must be good and there it is my friends they began to literally swallow or believe everything those so-called priesthood said they accepted that as gospel not knowing that they were rejecting or bypassing the true gospel of the word of god and so they by that means that false church listen close was able to take over the minds to begin to conquer and take over the minds have mind control soul control spirit control over the people at that time and of their life and brought them to a place of servants controlled by a denom dominating and this despotic priesthood controlling them until they become servants of the woman servants of the church instead of servants of the word of god amen we're not called to be servants of the church even though we will by our own hearts of gratitude thankfulness and love serve in the church but we are called to be servants of god amen so instead these people were servants of the church instead of being servants of the holy word of god now according to an edict by emperor theodosius the 10th listen he was baptized into the first church of rome and he ought to give this edict we three emperors will that our subjects steadfastly adhere to the religion which was taught by saint peter to the romans of course we will not speak of that now but peter was never in rome it is not in history not in pagan history not in world history it is in nowhere that peter ever went to rome so put that in your uh in your mind and just think about it [Laughter] oh my they said he said adhere to the religion as taught by saint peter to the romans a lie which has been faithfully preserved by our transit traditions preserved by traditions not by the holy spirit not by the god of heaven but preserved by their traditions which is now professed by the pontiff the damascus of rome so it was preserved by tradition and we believe it now because it's being professed oh my professed by the pontiff of rome then my friends according to the institution of the apostles and the doctrine of the gospel he continues listen closely let us believe in one godhead of the father of the son and of the holy spirit of equal majesty in the holy trinity not found in the word of god either just a slight twist of the tale away from the word of god sounds like scripture but it's not in the scripture we order listen to this now they're going to force people to believe this faith force people to believe this religion until generations after people are being born into it born into it and immediately yes they're born they believe that makes them christian catholic they're born into it they believe that makes them christian catholic and that is contrary to the word of god now listen we order let the adherents or believers of this faith be called catholic christians is differentiating them from the rest of so of christians that were there there in the world no we are now catholic christians of course we know catholic means universal but here it is we brand all senseless followers of these other religions with the infamous name of heretics anybody that believes different from them right now that spirit is sleeping and they're allowing all these wants to function but when they have come to the complete power and they manifest their power every one of them will have to grow out of let me use the word out of business and come under that one world council one acumenism or they're going to be decimated and destroyed completely listen he says here all these we brand these followers of other religions with the infamous name of heretics and forbid their their conventicals assuming the names of churches in other words they shouldn't even call themselves churches but because there's only one true church that is the holy roman catholic church that's what they believe because my friends the condemnation of divine justice they must expect the heavy penalties which our authority guided by heavenly wisdom shall think to inflict upon them now they're forcing people to believe this false teaching of nucleationism of divide and conquer and it started that way until now it has become a tradition it has become something people are born into the church born into it they're not even forced anymore because they're willingly accepted my mother was a catholic my mother was a methodist my mother was a baptist i was born into that therefore i'm one too and god doesn't have grandchildren because it never will work that way amen 15 laws of penalty this emperor issued and thereby deprived genuine true believers evangelical in faith all rights of exercising their faith and their their religion and punish them by beginning to first of all exclude them from government positions begin to put them out from holding government posts if you want to haul the government post you got to be a member of so-and-so like that and my friends threaten them with fines if they don't bow down and accept that teaching threaten them with confiscation of their properties confiscation of their wealth or whatever they have and also banishment from rome they'll banish them out of rome have to leave their business leave their whatever they have out of there and in some cases they even inflicted upon them death my friends we are headed that way today the roman catholic church calls herself even to this day the holy mother church she calls herself the first original church and that is absolutely correct because she is the first one to backslide into sin like eve did in the garden she backslid away from the word of god and also like nimrod in the beginning she was the first to begin to organize herself in a hierarchy of orders and positions of power religious power within the confines of the church and hear the deeds and then the doctrine of the nicolasians no one will deny that this church is a mother for that mother has produced daughters and straight to the point we know of how protestantism arose that martin luther actually came out of the womb of the catholic roman catholic church and from luther all the protestant organizations denominations of this day whatever they want to call themselves you can even trace it in the in the orders of denominations how they came from luther and how they came out and they broke out with zwingli and and hosts and all these men and began to spiral out and become a tree of knowledge religious knowledge of good and evil here it is my friends and so from her came all these denominations her daughters all these pro so-called protestant churches and the catholic church sits back with a smile on her face knowing that those are all her daughters and even though some may even go out preaching against her saying things against them and speaking but as long as they hold to the original teaching of the holy trinity they are still daughters of that mother as still as they continue my friends in the teaching of the tri-unity of god or trinity of god regardless of what name of churches they put on themselves there's still are daughters to that mother whom the bible describes she's a harlot a to the word of the living god oh my a wow a woman married to god untrue to her marriage vows like eve was married to adam untrue to her marriage vows then went with the serpent and brought forth nothing but a bastard hybrid came so did that first church went away from the word of god and went and had a union with babylonianism nickelodeonism and next week we'll speak about their union with and produce nothing but monstrosity married to god and fornicating with the devil amen bringing forth daughters with the same kind of attitude like you they may not call themselves the they have the same organizations pope cardinals archbishop bishops down to the priests one may change the name superintendent general superintendent down to local uh superintendent and on down to the local pastor and so on and you go through it it'll go from head presbyter they may change the names but the organizational reality is exactly the same and they continue to propagate the same doctrines and same teachings under their mother as franchises and my friends as showing their relationship spiritually with her think of it and saw them we are looking in our day at her mother and child reunion mother and daughter's reunion reuniting again of the world cups of churches ecumenism ecumenism is on the move friends they're once more coming together into a religious unity what was not obvious before is beginning to come obvious where evangelical ministers take it as a a matter of pride of being going to the rome for an audience with papa with the pope and bowing down and kissing the so-called ring my lord have mercy god help every one of us back to the word back to the bible back to the original faith trust in him who will not leave you oh praise god hallelujah amen those bishops early bishops begin to think they were above the word they began to teach and tell the people they could forgive sins they didn't have to go to jesus anymore they didn't have to bow their knees and cry out and sorrow of repentance before god anymore but if you want a crowd to god cry out to me and so they would go into the confessional box and they'll tell the people i will forgive your sins and when you confess you you don't need to confess to god confess to a a sinner like yourself garbed in human robes and confess to the sinner like yourself the bible doesn't tell you that the bible tells you you must confess to the lord jesus christ the bible tells you my friends only he has the power to forgive your sins amen praise god you begin to baptize people baptized infants only in the second century baptizing infants listen this is all the seduction of satan acts 2 38 tells you repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins your sins won't be forgiven listen until you repent and here it is how's the baby going to repent how's that infant going to repent how's a child going to repent but they determine in their way they are going to baptize infants it's not in the word of the living god and this they also began to teach regenerational water baptism in other words you're baptized in the church and you're saved you're saved by being baptized into the church the bible doesn't say that it says repent and then be baptized and in the name of jesus christ then you'll receive the gift of the holy spirit my lord jesus hallelujah and that is contrary to god's word you're not born again by baptism you're born again by repentance and faith in the substitute shed blood of jesus christ for the remission of our sins amen hallelujah there's no wonder people are mixed up today friends they're mixed up they were mix-up back then and that was only shortly after pentecost they got mixed up by that babylon mystery babylon and the babylonian pagan teachings back there and now here we are 2 000 years and more past that time away from the original truth and people are even more mixed up today that is why we are crying out day after day week after week year after year back to the world back to christ back to the original faith even if god can help us to bring one back one soul my friend is worth more than the worlds that are out there and that is my work that is the work of every true man every true child of god every servant of the living god come home come home back to the word of the living god and stay with god's word because in him there's only the only true hope we have is in jesus christ today amen he is our shelter in the time of storm the lord's my rock in him i hide he is my shelter in the midst of covet in the midst of tribulation trial problem whatever it is god is our rockies or shelter your hopes are in him let us rest our entire lives in
