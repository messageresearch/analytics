[46:10] five we're going to bring it right
[46:13] into the right into the message but
[46:17] remember the church ages blend they
[46:19] never stop and end they blend so these
[46:22] messages are blend together any one of
[46:24] these serieses they they blend together
[46:26] amen amen so we're going to start
[46:28] breaking into the lean Church age this
[46:32] morning the Pentecostal
[46:35] age and the bride Age The Rapture Age
[46:38] The Eternal age which most people don't
[46:41] understand and don't recognize what's in
[46:44] the message hallelujah amen hallelujah
[46:49] Jesus said You shall know the truth and
[46:51] the truth shall make you free Hallelujah
[46:55] there's a very very fine line there in
[46:58] truth a lot of people think they know
[47:01] the truth and especially in this message
[47:04] because they got the letter of the
[47:06] message they think they know the truth
[47:09] but remember when the spirit of Truth is
[47:12] come it will guide you and lead you into
[47:15] all truth so you can't know truth unless
[47:19] the spirit of truth comes and reveals it
[47:22] to you
[47:24] hallelujah oh my
[47:29] in the days of Jesus the Pharisees and
[47:31] Sadducees and the scribes they created
[47:34] hundreds of traditions and the oral law
[47:37] to cover or make none effect of the
[47:40] Mosaic law Jesus broke the church Free
[47:45] by fulfilling all the
[47:48] law we're not under the law we're under
[47:52] grace amen the law had a purpose and the
[47:56] law has has a purpose in our life amen
[47:59] but the law is fulfilled under Jesus
[48:03] Christ the blood the life amen the token
[48:07] of this hour
[48:09] Hallelujah and people still don't
[48:13] recognize that in his fullness and
[48:15] that's where the Lord wants to bring his
[48:17] bride to Hallelujah into that fullness
[48:20] of understanding we cannot be that
[48:23] Mighty church we cannot be that Mighty
[48:25] Army until we fully recognize who we are
[48:29] and we're in that process this morning
[48:32] every morning every day we're in that
[48:35] process amen of moving forward
[48:39] Hallelujah God Don't Look Back God don't
[48:42] have any pleasure in people who draw
[48:44] back in their
[48:47] faith he looks for men of God with
[48:50] backbone women of God with
[48:53] backbone amen we are not weak people
[48:56] people we are rugged people we are
[48:59] soldiers of the
[49:01] Cross we are the most mentally strong P
[49:04] people on this face of this Earth that
[49:07] are walking on this Earth we are
[49:10] determined with a purpose we are certain
[49:13] that God is with us amen that's what
[49:17] kind of people we
[49:19] are oh when people rise up and they know
[49:22] who they are more and more that's what
[49:24] that anointing is created around your
[49:26] life
[49:27] that confidence comes around they're
[49:29] talking about being positive they're
[49:31] talking about being confidence out there
[49:33] but nothing is more confident amen and
[49:37] positive than this word of God when it
[49:39] gets into an
[49:40] individual Hallelujah and that's why
[49:43] we're here this morning is that why
[49:45] you're here or you just come to
[49:49] church pat yourself on the back I'm a
[49:52] message believer I'm religious I believe
[49:56] God sent a
[49:57] Prophet I believe in the prophet I
[49:59] believe in all these great stories so
[50:01] does the
[50:04] devil probably believes it more than
[50:07] you because he's felt the effects of
[50:10] it then we see the Dark Ages the Roman
[50:14] Catholic Church bringing in the nickel
[50:21] ladyann Adan Spirit we talked about
[50:25] that they br it in in remember the Bible
[50:28] says that the Gentiles like to exercise
[50:31] authority over one another they put all
[50:33] the categories in all the headships in
[50:37] of man and all that is to do is to
[50:40] eliminate God out of the process you're
[50:44] not allowed in anymore Holy Spirit they
[50:47] kick them out when they do that
[50:50] Hallelujah God has offices but those
[50:53] offices are gifts they're yielded Val
[50:56] vessels to God for God to have the
[50:59] prence in them that the Holy Spirit can
[51:02] flow through them Hallelujah he didn't
[51:04] set up any of these organizations
[51:07] denominations none of these things that
[51:09] man has set up
[51:12] hallelujah amen at the end of the leosan
[51:15] church age came the prophet to bring the
[51:17] bride into the fullness of the truth
[51:19] again because the message started in a
[51:22] Pentecostal
[51:24] age that's where it started
[51:27] the prophet comes at the end of the age
[51:30] it was the Pentecostal age that the
[51:32] prophet came to just recapping here amen
[51:37] hallelujah amen and grew until the
[51:40] opening of The Seven Seals thus when the
[51:43] age
[51:44] changed again until the Eternal Church
[51:48] age then it became the brides age then
[51:51] the messenger amen changed over like
[51:55] like John said say I must decrease
[51:59] Hallelujah do we see the type I must
[52:01] decrease John the prophet so that he
[52:04] Christ can
[52:06] increase what came down on the mountain
[52:10] what was the cloud all about who was
[52:15] that
[52:17] Hallelujah the mighty
[52:20] Angel
[52:22] amen but people are still feeding off
[52:25] the Pentecostal
[52:29] age it's all the
[52:32] message but not recognized when the age
[52:35] changed and God turned a
[52:38] corner and we talk about going deeper
[52:41] into the truth and not staying shallow
[52:44] in his word but digging and moving into
[52:47] the opening of the word bringing us into
[52:49] the Capstone
[52:51] age Hallelujah that's just a recap what
[52:53] we've been speaking on Amen
[52:58] now the word
[53:00] seek
[53:01] [Music]
[53:05] Hallelujah attempt to find
[53:08] something attempt or desire to obtain or
[53:11] achieve something ask for something from
[53:14] someone pursuing hunting searching for
[53:17] it out chastening chasing it down
[53:22] shopping for it seeking for it
[53:25] Hallelujah
[53:27] we think that we don't have to
[53:30] seek we think we don't have to find we
[53:33] think we don't have to knock in this
[53:35] hour we think we have it
[53:38] all because we have the
[53:41] tapes because we have the books because
[53:44] we come to
[53:46] church my brothers and sisters this is
[53:49] the most deceiving age where Satan is
[53:51] trying to make the church well he is
[53:54] making the church but not the bride
[53:57] lukewarm lazy spiritually lazy
[54:02] powerless in this
[54:04] hour we should be people amen determined
[54:09] to know the
[54:11] truth if it's stirred in our hearts I
[54:14] know when when the truth struck me and
[54:17] this light struck me I didn't know a lot
[54:19] but I know it was
[54:21] real I know something touched me like no
[54:24] other thing could touch me amen
[54:27] something healed me and delivered me I
[54:30] didn't know who it was what it was but
[54:33] when not touched me and changed my life
[54:35] I knew my life was
[54:38] changed Hallelujah and I from that day
[54:42] was seeking and finding to this day I
[54:45] haven't stopped I'm more determined to
[54:48] seek and find out truth I am still
[54:51] growing in this truth and growing in
[54:54] this understanding amen because I'm
[54:56] still here the Rapture it hasn't taken
[54:59] place yet the Rapture is on but the
[55:02] event hasn't taken place Hallelujah so
[55:06] I'm
[55:07] seeking I'm knocking Lord Jesus every
[55:11] day every moment that I wake yes I'm
[55:14] living and moving and and and and and
[55:17] living my life like like it looks like
[55:19] on the outside like everybody else but
[55:22] inside inside there's been a birth
[55:26] there's there's been a
[55:27] change

[58:08] circumstances from time to time where we
[58:10] can't make it amen hallelujah and the
[58:13] people that are online right now that
[58:16] don't want to come in and assemble

[1:10:51] are
[1:10:53] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:57] living behind the veil is not living
[1:10:59] outside of the veil or going in and out
[1:11:04] maybe you're in between
[1:11:07] stage not in not
[1:11:11] out Hallelujah a lot of people's
[1:11:14] experiences right there you're not in
[1:11:16] you're not out Hallelujah you got the
[1:11:20] seven Church ages Hallelujah you see
[1:11:22] that then you see the Gap in between the
[1:11:24] caps Stone which is the holy spirit then
[1:11:27] you see the Capstone the love the son of
[1:11:30] man that's the bride age that's the
[1:11:32] Eternal age Hallelujah in the message
[1:11:36] you have all those seven Church ages
[1:11:39] displayed in the message you're reading
[1:11:40] them you're listening to them but there
[1:11:43] was a Chasm that the prophet
[1:11:46] experienced Hallelujah and he went into
[1:11:49] the
[1:11:51] Capstone and that's the same way we have
[1:11:54] to be it's the same process that the
[1:11:56] bride goes through in her experience
[1:11:58] with God
[1:12:01] hallelujah
[1:12:04] amen you see but when a person lives
[1:12:07] behind the veil they manifest the same
[1:12:10] life that the wave sheet in this
[1:12:14] hour your life your thoughts your words
[1:12:17] your emotions your feelings your
[1:12:19] decisions your choices and your actions
[1:12:22] they see Christ in you you watch
[1:12:25] differently than other people in the
[1:12:28] message I don't want to walk like some
[1:12:30] people in the
[1:12:32] message wear my cowboy hat my Bob
[1:12:35] buckles and try to put on something holy
[1:12:38] on the
[1:12:39] outside Hallelujah I'm like I'm like
[1:12:42] Paul chiefest of
[1:12:43] Sinners I make more mistakes than
[1:12:45] anybody else I'm not here to perfect the
[1:12:49] flesh Hallelujah I'm here to grow Amen
[1:12:53] in his Perfection thank
[1:12:56] inside Hallelujah this out man is
[1:12:59] perishing every day but the Inside Man
[1:13:02] is renewing every day that's the new man
[1:13:06] that's the man I'm focused on that's the
[1:13:09] man I feed the word of God and the
[1:13:12] truth and it will reflect it will
[1:13:15] reflect but remember you don't find
[1:13:17] you're never going to get perfection in
[1:13:18] this flesh but a lot of people are
[1:13:21] striving and interpreting this message
[1:13:23] to be perfection in the flesh fesh how
[1:13:26] much they can bring this flesh under
[1:13:28] subjection
[1:13:30] Hallelujah if a true son and daughter of
[1:13:32] God tries that God will allow you to
[1:13:35] fall in your flesh in your sin just to
[1:13:38] show you Perfection does not come by the
[1:13:41] flesh
[1:13:43] hallelujah amen hallelujah you walk
[1:13:47] different than people in the message
[1:13:49] remember the High Calling God deals with
[1:13:51] you differently he speaks to you
[1:13:53] differently he doesn't allow you to do
[1:13:54] things that other Christians other
[1:13:57] message Believers are allowed to do I'm
[1:13:59] surprised I'm I'm I'm I'm shocked at how
[1:14:02] people live their lives in this message
[1:14:04] how they interpret the
[1:14:06] message but God doesn't deal with
[1:14:09] them in a way that he deals with the
[1:14:12] bride
[1:14:14] hallelujah
[1:14:16] amen hallelujah and the atmosphere
[1:14:19] around your life is different this is a
[1:14:22] person who has crossed over into the
[1:14:24] Eternal age the bride age no more living
[1:14:27] in the past Pentecostal age but see
[1:14:30] after the Seven Seals were open our
[1:14:33] Prophet was no longer in the leosan age
[1:14:36] spiritually
[1:14:38] speaking Hallelujah the lalene age the
[1:14:42] Pentecostal age was
[1:14:44] over we are still naturally and our
[1:14:48] flesh is naturally in the leoan church
[1:14:51] age but we have crossed over H Allelujah
[1:14:55] the Revelation in us has crossed over
[1:14:57] into the Eternal Church age where he is
[1:15:01] our
[1:15:02] messenger the mighty
[1:15:08] Angel people can't understand that when
[1:15:10] you say the prophet of Malachi 45 is no
[1:15:13] longer our an our messenger they don't
[1:15:17] understand that what do you mean what do
[1:15:19] you
[1:15:20] mean what do you think the voice his
[1:15:22] voice was actually the literal voice of
[1:15:24] God
[1:15:25] or do you think everything he said was
[1:15:27] thus sayeth the Lord then that would
[1:15:28] make him God Almighty which some people
[1:15:31] believe
[1:15:35] that spiritually speaking and th and his
[1:15:39] message was no longer a Pentecostal
[1:15:43] message so what am I trying to say
[1:15:48] hallelujah the new birth in this hour is
[1:15:51] through the opening of the seals the
[1:15:53] revealing of the word of God the
[1:15:56] changing of the corner the changing of
[1:15:58] the age the changing of the
[1:16:01] dispensation spiritually speaking amen a
[1:16:04] lot of people are born again by a
[1:16:08] Pentecostal message in this

[1:20:12] ideas and beliefs than of what God has
[1:20:15] spoken this is what he has done with the
[1:20:18] denominational thinking today in a
[1:20:21] different thinking to God's thinking it
[1:20:24] will separate us from God which results
[1:20:27] in death Amos 3:3 how can two walk
[1:20:31] together andless they be
[1:20:34] agreed we cannot agree with him until he
[1:20:38] reveals it to us until we walk with him

[1:20:50] forth of his own kind there there was no
[1:20:54] death in in the Eden we are now entering
[1:20:57] where Satan is taken the throne as the
[1:21:01] Antichrist in the Eden of this Earth the
[1:21:05] Eden of sin perverted religion he
[1:21:08] started out not by saying I am Satan I
[1:21:12] am the great Angel no not upon that but
[1:21:16] upon perverting God's word hallelujah
[1:21:20] what so if he didn't come out in that
[1:21:23] way and come out with that kind Ministry
[1:21:25] but he come out and pervert in God's
[1:21:26] word what does he take then what does he
[1:21:31] take yes that's what he
[1:21:36] takes
[1:21:37] [Music]
[1:21:38] Hallelujah and that's how he has brought
[1:21:41] his kingdom in every age and now in this
[1:21:44] great deceitful age ready to take his
[1:21:46] throne by his people he's built himself
[1:21:49] an intellectual educated scientific Eden
[1:21:53] right down scientific preachers
[1:21:56] scientific Church scientific theology
[1:22:00] everything is scientific everything is
[1:22:02] based on
[1:22:09] knowledge not in this message right not
[1:22:12] in these message
[1:22:16] churches the whole church is built upon
[1:22:22] knowledge let me tell tell you my
[1:22:24] brother and
[1:22:27] sister is the message of the hour built
[1:22:30] upon as as as a whole perfect
[1:22:36] Faith
[1:22:38] hallelujah
[1:22:41] amen the power of
[1:22:44] traditions
[1:22:46] stops the teachings stop you from going
[1:22:49] deeper in the revealing of the word in
[1:22:53] your position tradition closes the door
[1:22:55] of your heart and the Holy Spirit cannot
[1:22:58] come into that heart into that
[1:23:00] experience when you place believe in
[1:23:03] something else than the revealed word
[1:23:06] it's your belief core and not letting
[1:23:09] the truth come in the word oh man we
[1:23:13] have a belief core in this message this
[1:23:15] is the strongest the strongest belief
[1:23:17] core in the world today you think the
[1:23:19] Catholics are strong in their belief
[1:23:21] core oh nothing stronger than the
[1:23:24] message M and when a message
[1:23:26] believer right gets to a place where
[1:23:30] where they believe what they
[1:23:32] believe that belief core is strong
[1:23:35] around them Hallelujah you're saying oh
[1:23:38] brother Tim that's good yeah it might be
[1:23:41] good it might be it might be negative
[1:23:42] too H Allelujah because remember this is
[1:23:46] an unfolding of Revelation like I said
[1:23:49] before a preacher said to me he said
[1:23:51] brother everything is revealed
[1:23:52] everything is there nothing needs the
[1:23:54] the grow and mature I said yeah it's all
[1:23:56] here but it has to be open up to the
[1:23:58] individual it has to grow and what a lot
[1:24:01] of people don't understand that brother
[1:24:02] bradam had to grw grow in
[1:24:05] faith the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:24:08] love he did not say
[1:24:11] that Hey listen I believe that this
[1:24:13] Prophet is a prophet of Malachi 45 he's
[1:24:16] a true Prophet but I realize he's a man
[1:24:18] and he had to grow in his position
[1:24:21] because I glorify not a man I glorify
[1:24:23] God and I see God in a man perfecting a
[1:24:25] man allowing a man to grow and grow and
[1:24:28] grow in faith then then an angel have to
[1:24:31] come to him and say listen we and even
[1:24:34] brother Brown said when an angel comes
[1:24:35] to you and corrects you on your teaching
[1:24:38] and on your
[1:24:40] Doctrine
[1:24:43] Hallelujah so that's what's happening my
[1:24:46] brothers and sisters and we develop a
[1:24:48] belief core amen and remember when we
[1:24:52] start out in this Journey this
[1:24:55] experience with God this Enlightenment
[1:24:58] that has happening to you it's a
[1:25:00] constant Revelation that is unfolding
[1:25:03] and Satan is trying to bring tradition
[1:25:05] he's trying to bring law he's trying to
[1:25:07] bring all these deceitful ways in your
[1:25:10] path into the path of a true seed but
[1:25:13] remember the true seed will
[1:25:15] overcome Hallelujah they'll overcome
[1:25:18] every snare every trap everye doubt
[1:25:22] deceiving thing that comes your way why
[1:25:24] because of man because of a great
[1:25:26] ministry no because the Holy Ghost is
[1:25:30] determined in her life to bring this
[1:25:32] word to to truth to
[1:25:35] Enlightenment even I can't preach what's
[1:25:38] on my heart even I can't no man can
[1:25:43] Hallelujah no man in this message
[1:25:46] can and when you think any preacher in
[1:25:49] this message has it well this brother
[1:25:51] has it he preached this he preached he
[1:25:53] has it all he explains it all you cannot
[1:25:56] explain the Holy
[1:25:59] Spirit you cannot do his job no man
[1:26:03] could do his job and that's where
[1:26:05] they're got it wrong that's where
[1:26:07] they're built on knowledge and
[1:26:10] intellectual in this
[1:26:14] message when this
[1:26:17] Peter who has it revealed to you Flesh
[1:26:20] and Blood hasn't revealed it to
[1:26:22] you my father has revealed it to you
[1:26:25] they could have been around Jesus seen
[1:26:27] everything that he done for 100 years
[1:26:30] until the Holy Spirit came and revealed
[1:26:32] that that he was the son of God
[1:26:37] hallelujah amen 1962 convinced and

[1:40:04] through a fight and a battle to what to
[1:40:07] get into that Capstone to
[1:40:10] overcome remember in every age is it's
[1:40:12] given to the Overcomer to them that
[1:40:15] overcome to them that
[1:40:18] overcome we got to
[1:40:21] overcome and Order order to receive what
[1:40:25] has been given to us this is not been
[1:40:28] given to us my brothers those tapes are
[1:40:31] not what God has given to us it's what's
[1:40:34] behind it it's him behind it that's been
[1:40:37] given to us and that's why we have to
[1:40:40] overcome
[1:40:42] Hallelujah glory to
[1:40:45] God
[1:40:47] Amen
[1:40:49] Hallelujah and now we find in that in
[1:40:52] each one of those ages usually people
[1:40:55] don't want to believe it because they're
[1:40:57] already set in their ways you're turning
[1:41:00] a corner you're building a building and
[1:41:04] then you get to the corner and everybody
[1:41:06] wants to keep running
[1:41:08] straight straight ahead oh isn't that
[1:41:12] today spiritually speaking everybody in
[1:41:15] this message want to build the building
[1:41:18] they want to go straight ahead and build
[1:41:20] a building
[1:41:23] I'm not only talking naturally I'm
[1:41:25] talking
[1:41:27] spiritually they want to go straight
[1:41:33] ahead but listen to brother
[1:41:36] bradam they don't want to turn a
[1:41:40] corner we're not building a wall like we
[1:41:44] start off in
[1:41:45] Luther
[1:41:47] message go right straight down the line
[1:41:50] right down to the Pentecostal message
[1:41:55] we are turning a corner we're turning
[1:41:59] Corners we are building a building God's
[1:42:02] word is the blueprint anybody can run a
[1:42:05] straight line but it takes a Mason to
[1:42:07] turn a
[1:42:09] corner right brother
[1:42:12] Chris it takes the power of God to do
[1:42:15] that it takes an anointing from Heaven
[1:42:18] to be sent down to do that upon you it
[1:42:22] has in every age
[1:42:24] and in those Prophet ages the word of
[1:42:26] the Lord comes through those prophets
[1:42:28] and they turn those Corners made those
[1:42:32] differences but the builders what they
[1:42:35] want to build a wall it's not a wall at
[1:42:38] all it's a building a building of God
[1:42:42] there's where we get those Junctions of
[1:42:44] time mixed
[1:42:47] up there's where it's hard for the
[1:42:50] people to understand that God has turned
[1:42:53] to
[1:42:54] Corner amen God has turned a
[1:42:58] corner in brother bram's
[1:43:01] Ministry you see it but a lot of people
[1:43:05] don't even recognize that God turned a
[1:43:07] corner in his ministry after the opening
[1:43:09] of the seals where he said the Bible
[1:43:12] became a new Bible to me and he said I'm
[1:43:15] not a Pentecostal preacher anymore go
[1:43:17] look it up for yourself I'm not a
[1:43:19] Pentecostal preacher anymore I'm not in
[1:43:21] the Pentecostal spiritually age anymore
[1:43:24] but I've crossed over to the Eternal
[1:43:26] Church age I've crossed from Death unto
[1:43:30] life amen when you're born again in this
[1:43:33] hour you cross from Death unto life amen
[1:43:38] hallelujah glory to God he turned that
[1:43:42] corner and he went in into the
[1:43:47] calstone in behind the inner Veil his
[1:43:50] life changed his walk
[1:43:53] changed everything about him changed his
[1:43:57] ministry
[1:43:58] changed did it get more
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:04] popular isn't that where they said he
[1:44:06] went
[1:44:10] off remember what I said earlier the
[1:44:13] word of God will always repeat itself
[1:44:17] will always come to pass history always
[1:44:19] repeats itself remember all
[1:44:21] righteousness must be fulfilled
[1:44:24] right Jesus Paul brother brandham now
[1:44:28] the bride must ride this Trail again
[1:44:30] brother brandham ain't coming back he
[1:44:32] ain't rising from the
[1:44:36] grave if you believe in that kind of
[1:44:39] nonsense you're not even in leoan church
[1:44:42] age you're in some other
[1:44:45] age called
[1:44:52] crazy yes I just speak as I
[1:44:58] speak we that are here today are the
[1:45:01] evidence of that seed of God let me try
[1:45:04] to start winding this down in this there
[1:45:07] is the seed that must pass through many
[1:45:09] trials confusion uncertainties but it
[1:45:12] grows and comes out of all of that and
[1:45:16] that that Faith grows into more perfect
[1:45:18] faith and that's what's bringing that
[1:45:20] Born Again into that little room means
[1:45:23] when you when you born as a baby into
[1:45:25] this world you don't know nothing about

[1:51:31] lot of things for the next
[1:51:34] message people say in this message just
[1:51:37] say what the prophet
[1:51:39] said repeat what he says and like we
[1:51:43] always said there's a bunch of parrots
[1:51:44] the best parrots you want to buy a good
[1:51:47] parrot they're right here in the message
[1:51:50] they can repeat everything that the
[1:51:51] prophet said
[1:51:53] that's not what he
[1:51:55] said that's not what he
[1:51:58] meant didn't mean to say for you to
[1:52:00] repeat
[1:52:01] everything how do you find your place
[1:52:03] and your position how do you come into
[1:52:06] your own when you just repeat if if the
[1:52:08] if if the son always repeats what the
[1:52:10] father's doing how does he find his his
[1:52:12] own identity he can't find it that's not
[1:52:15] what he
[1:52:19] meant just like when he spoke and Jesus
[1:52:22] said
[1:52:23] baptize in the name of the Father the
[1:52:24] Son of the Holy
[1:52:27] Ghost if they repeated what Jesus said
[1:52:30] the apostles would have baptized in the
[1:52:32] name of the father Son and the Holy
[1:52:33] Ghost but acts
[1:52:36] 238 they came out and baptized in the
[1:52:38] name of the Lord Jesus Christ why they
[1:52:40] knew what he meant they knew his name
[1:52:44] they knew who he
[1:52:45] was do we
[1:52:48] understand if we know what he meant we
[1:52:52] know who he was and who this
[1:52:57] is then we speak the name of Jesus
[1:53:01] Christ
[1:53:03] Hallelujah glory to
[1:53:06] God Queen of Sheba as long as a human
[1:53:09] being search and hungers and thirsts the
[1:53:12] calling for the power of God there's got
[1:53:14] to be a power somewhere to respond to
[1:53:17] that power before there be can become a
[1:53:20] creation there has to be a creator to
[1:53:22] create that a man longs to see God
[1:53:27] there's got to be a god somewhere that
[1:53:29] has created and desired for him if
[1:53:32] there's a deep call into the deep
[1:53:34] there's got to be a a deep to respond to
[1:53:37] that call because the Deep had to be
[1:53:40] first to be created that call inside of
[1:53:44] you amen do you have a deep this morning

[1:56:56] continue with this next time I'm called
[1:57:00] in the Bible study to finish it up
[1:57:03] showing clearly as possible that the
[1:57:05] bride is not living or feeding off the
[1:57:08] church ages anymore but she's in the
[1:57:10] Capstone behind the inner Veil where the
[1:57:13] food has been stored up that's the food
[1:57:16] that's been stored
[1:57:18] up that is the food people interpret as
[1:57:21] that the letter or the books or the
[1:57:23] tapes but behind that is behind the
[1:57:27] inner
[1:57:30] veil in the Capstone is where the true F
[1:57:34] food has been stored up for the Bride of
[1:57:36] Jesus Christ
[1:57:38] Hallelujah that's where she feeds off of
[1:57:43] and who she feeds off
[1:57:46] of

[1:58:20] Supernatural real
[1:58:23] [Music]
[1:58:25] and if you can only
[1:58:29] believe and move yourself aside this
[1:58:34] morning and let God come and interpret
[1:58:36] his word to you and you stop
[1:58:39] interpreting in
[1:58:41] yourself oh what an hour what an
[1:58:46] hour where people are living and dying
[1:58:48] at the same
[1:58:50] time living a piss read of all men dying

[1:59:50] simple Hallelujah a walk with God is
[1:59:53] very simple very
[1:59:57] humble but getting to that
[1:59:59] place there's a spiritual warfare that's
[2:00:02] taking place there's a battle that's
[2:00:04] going
[2:00:05] on oh Satan don't want to lose
[2:00:09] one he don't want to lose one but Jesus
