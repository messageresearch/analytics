change in the moment in the twinkling of an eye I'll Fly Away amen that's what I'm under expectation for is that what you're under expectation for this morning this morning amen I hope so this morning this morning amen praise God forever more God bless you I bring you greetings from Pastor Simon spoke to him he's um taking a little bit of time U to rest and he'll be back here on Wednesday night um also heard from brother Danny Sister Laura zanki they're they're in South Korea they said it's absolutely fantastic Daniela is doing great they're having a great time and they send their greetings to everybody amen praise God forever more and so we're here once again the last time we were here was um a couple weeks ago and we were right in the midst of um the elections in the US and um you know I recall when I was studying for for the message that weekend when I came across that scripture as I mentioned to you in Corinthians 15 where when I read the last trump it just kind of like jumped out at me and I told you that I said but then I thought my mind I said but Lord how in the world could they ever put a man like that on the throne here in America and and then you know the the prophecy brother braham's prophecy but you know I was with my partner Frank a lot and you know we'd be constantly talking about this and he says it's not going to be Hillary and he just kept saying that and he just believed that and he just he says she's too awesome she's this is Brother Brown says it's going to be beautiful and there's nothing you know there's not so much Beauty in her and stuff like that and this is what he was saying you know and uh you know and then he'd bring up every time you know the times where brother Bram spoke about it and if you actually look at all of the quotes of brother Brown speaking about this woman that's going to come into great power you'll not see that it says clearly or thus sayith the Lord she's going to be the Pres amen does not say that but it says that she'll come into some kind of a dictatorship or a great powerful woman in America she was the most powerful woman in America over the last year you know that right she stood in that position she stood in that office and she actually you know was was revered by by the Democratic movement and by that liberal movement and by the women's you know uh Liberation and everything else and took the Pinnacle of women power to such a level that you would wonder my goodness this is amazing and that's why there was so many women that were disappointed and and you know women having to explain to their daughters and you know I heard so much on the on the news and you know on the radio about all of this in the in the newspapers about how you know women had to wake up and tell their daughters they emphasized on these things you know how you know that it wasn't it just you know wasn't the time yet and you know but they were looking at this as a great moment for America that a woman would would escalate to the highest office in America imagine but yet you know we saw God's interpretation this week right right because all I could do when when that when that happened and I was watching it happen and I just I was watching the election results and I was seeing how it was on I can just imagine a lot of you know Believers worldwide imagine there's going to be a greater Falling Away now you know because they were probably wondering what in the world is going on so many of them went out on the on the limb and you know and said this is going to be the Fulfillment of that prophecy and and and this and that you know and and then even when I when I explained this to to a brother and I said you know when I when when I was reading that scripture and that came out to me so strong and and I know the inspiration that I caught off of it but then there's that natural right remember there's a spiritual and the natural and I caught the inspiration of the last trunk being that this bride is going to receive Faith that's going to actually change her at at a moment there's going to be the last Trump and it's going to be a faith that's going to be Beyond human Faith human understanding you can't put any interpretation on it all I can tell you is that it's going to be a revelation and it'll be the last Revelation you receive as a mortal human being before you are changed and that revelation will change you it's that simple and so you know I said and I said you know and so he turns he says well what are you saying brother are you saying that Trump's going to be the president I said no I'm not saying that I can't even imagine I just I just you know in my mind I just couldn't make it fit but then after it happened then you start seeking the Lord and you start wondering and you start looking and and saying well Lord and all I could say was he was your choice he was your choice let's get to the message today I want to talk about the last Trump part two and I want to look at what's happened I want to look at what it all means and really how do we fit into the whole thing because that's what's important to me and to you right whether anyway let's get into the message praise God let's open our Bibles to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 I don't want to get ahead [Music] here we've got a bit of a PowerPoint presentation that we'll be putting up just I'll let you know when um when you can put up actually go ahead and put up the first slide amen let's pray father what a time and what a season for the Sons and Daughters of God lord we have gone through quite a year I know there was great expectation in the hearts of the Believers and father there was so much excitement Lord through these uh elections in the USA father the modern Sodom and Gomorrah Lord we saw so many uh prophecies and so many uh uh manifestations of your word in so many ways father a a a country a land a nation that is completely Fallen apart but yet Lord these are prophetic scriptures these are prophetic events that we have witnessed with our own eyes and in our time and in our season but yet we are the ones Lord that have been given the ability to recognize the word of God and how it pertains to our day and the hour that we're living in and that's what we are gathered here this morning to do father is to be inspired by you father through speaker through hearer Lord that we might catch the faith and and the present truth father what it is that we need the inspiration that's going to give us the Courage the confidence and the ability to to to fulfill our part and the purpose why you called each and every one of us and so for that we come together this morning with great expectation and we ask that your anointing would come and move and bind every Power every demonic power that would try to hinder or or uh uh try to hold back in any way shape or form what it is that you would accomplish this morning but that would that change would be broken eyes would be opened the dead would be raised up father and Lord if there's healing required let there be healing in our midst father we thank you for it we give you the praise we give you the glory for it and we look to thee Oh God giving you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name remember our pastor watch over him uh rest him strengthen him and bring him back in Jesus name am amen God bless you Saints in Corinthians chapter 15 verse 51 it says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed amen may the Lord add His blessings to the word of God you may be seated amen praise God so we're looking here at the trumpet of God we know that God never does anything L he first reveals it unto his servants the prophets and then once the word has gone forth then there is a trumpet call which calls the children of Israel to the feast to the call to what it is that God is accomplishing what God is doing in that present day in that present hour amen praise God and so next slide we know that this is the hour where there's something that's going to sweep the land for the Christians for the sons and the daughters of God and it is going to be a faith that is going to change our bodies we don't need to know how it's going to happen we don't need to be scientific about the whole situation and how the event is actually going to be and how we're going to be you know changed into white gowns and all of a sudden we're going to be floating up into the air like some people want to interpret it that's not that's not important to me all that's important is that I that you know that it's going to happen so quick in the twinkling of an eye I was explaining it to one of my children yesterday and I was saying you see how you just blinked that's how quick it's going to happen that's how quick it's going to happen and God is doing it and and it's not going to be a matter of you know that we got to work something up in order for it to happen no it's got to come into God's time and God's season and when does the faith is going to come into the fivefold ministry and she's going to begin to to to minister that word in such a way that it's just going to it's going to have an effect on the bride it's going to bring her into more clarity of what it is that God is doing in her day amen now last weekend last Sunday we had an experience of what it is to be to be evangelized amen glory to God by the word of God by a servant of God by an evangelist by the five-fold ministry you witnessed an evangelist you heard him Minister the word of God in such a way that there was fire moving through the house there was inspiration moving through the hearts of the people there was there was demon powers being cast out of the people there was chains being broken he says listen I'm not like your pastor I'm not like your pastor where I can hold back and I got to be emotionally attached to your situations and you're you're I'm not concerned with that I'm I'm not built that way see he had perfect Faith he had a revelation of who he was the part that he was playing and God was pleased with that and God came down and anointed what he was speaking and that word had an effect on you don't tell me it didn't have an effect on you if it didn't have an effect on you you better get back on your knees because that fire burn burned around me for days amen it's still burning because it is the fire of God it is the way God is taking this bride and changing each and every one of us changing us from from from Glory unto Glory removing all those character flaws Amen to God the one thing that you will not take from here okay is all of your money all of your pride all your all of your Acquisitions you're not going to take any of that with you none of it some people they get into this concept into their minds that they're going to that they're going to be able to show God that they did something good by showing how much they could give or how much they could build that's not what it is without faith it's impossible to receive the change it's just that simple it's it's not going to be a matter of your ability or my ability or anybody's ability it's going to be the word in its season the word in its season and when you catch that word in your season it's going to cause you to manifest life the life of the word amen that's the interpretation of the Holy Ghost brother Bram says the evidence of the Holy Ghost is your ability to recognize the word receive it and live it amen so in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible now the very next thing that you're going to see when that Trump strikes your soul and you are changed in a twinkling of an eye you're going to see the Saints of old prise Lord that'll be the very next thing that you are going to see because the scripture is very clear that the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and it's just that simple so we can be under the right expectation of what it is that we expect to happen and just like when Jesus in the first resurrection when the when he came back from hell with those Saints because he went down to preach to the souls that were in prison but with him came the the the the Saints of old amen glory to God and that's just a very uh exact type of how it is that we are going to witness and see this change and this next event that's going to happen because Jesus is going to go get them first the dead in Christ shall rise first and just like the apostles and the disciples back in the days of Jesus they witnessed those Saints in Jerusalem they witnessed them they saw these events taking place Jesus had told them about you know there was going to be this time this season just like we've been told so we get under the same expectation to know what it is that's going to happen here in this Dimension right now in the season that we're living in and how it is that it's all going to come about amen puts us under the r the the the right expectation very important Saints because you can get all caught up with what's going on in the states and you could be one of those that are so disappointed oh I don't know brother gram said that you know it was supposed to be a woman president I mean how close can it get I don't know you know I don't know about this now I'm wondering what's going on here I wonder you know these guys that are that are you know claiming brother Brandon to be a false Pro I wonder I wonder I wonder I wonder you know why cuz they're wandering Stars they aren't anchored by revelation God does not make any mistakes that's why as soon as it had happened as soon as I seen it I all I could say what all I could say was this was your choice Lord how does it how does it pertain to me now where do I fit into this now how do I move on because you don't make mistakes you don't do anything that is out of cater according to your plan and that's one thing you need to get into your heads right you need to get that stubborn thing about oh I want to be right you don't need to be right you don't need to be right there's no there's no need to be right there this is the hour where God you know God has always been his own interpreter amen so why all of a sudden you want to be his interpreter right why does everybody out there want to be his interpreter I'm not here to be an interpreter like I said to you when when I study the scriptures and I look to the word of God I wait for inspiration to strike my soul and then I just go and just whatever God lays on my heart that's what God that's what I that's what I give to the people that's all I can give because I know that I got nothing I know that I don't I cannot you know come up with my own ideas and my own interpretation on the word of God God is his own interpreter God sends the power of the Rema life into the vessel God sends that anointing onto a certain situation and he brings it to pass exactly the way he prophesied it like you know he said a virgin shall conceive he said that hundreds of years before through Isaiah and my god when that day come when that angel come down and stood before Mary and said blessed art thou amongst all women thank you that was the life word Rema power love anointing of God coming upon that individual and she right there manifested a seed in her womb and all she could say because she was under that Supernatural anointing that light that was all over her she could not deny it one of these Morning Saints that light is going to light around you that power is going to come upon you you're going to feel a love and anointing that you will not all you know that you will say be it unto me according to Thy word oh God Amen blessed be the name of the Lord you won't have to try and put an interpretation on that God will interpret it to the world Amen and that's what he's doing in this hour don't let these events get you all out a cater next slide please recently we know that God always shows signs in the heavens before they are declared on the earth and we know that brother BR said that if you want to know what time it is he says watch Israel we've heard that over and over and over again you need to hear it again Watch Israel watch what's going on in Israel recognize that whatever God is doing God is showing in the heavens and in a nation which was his chosen people and just recently and you know I never knew about this it was brother Desmond that brought it to my attention after I ministered there a couple of weeks ago he sent me this video he says oh brother have you seen what's going on in Israel and what took place with the trumpets I said no so he showed it to me yeah and then I said wow and I looked into it and it happened right after the final feast in Israel because they've just gone through all of their feasts and the last Feast is the Feast of Tabernacles the one that calls the Saints to that final Feast the one that calls the chosen the elect of God to that final Feast to that that final meeting and so we know that trumpet sound is God's way of calling to an event that's what it is it's a calling to an event this event next slide took place on October the 1st and here you know we read in the scriptures then you shall cause the trumpet of Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month on the day of atonement you shall make the trumpet to sound throughout all your land it's interesting you know we've seen that before on the 10th day the 7th month and we know what happened in Revelations 10: 7 when the mighty angel came down that was the time in the season for a change in dispens dispensation that was a major event on the earth Saints we're going to look a little bit more at that as we go into the message here next scripture Joel 2:1 says blow the trumpet in Zion where is Zion Israel Jerusalem amongst my chosen people sound the alarm on my Holy Hill let all who live in the land tremble for the day of the Lord is coming it is close at hand amen this is a season this is a time we're trying to look at where we are and how it all fits together next scripture it's not a scripture actually it's a link and I'm going to ask Chris if he would just play that link because this is the actual somebody that you know recorded the event back on October the 1st it off you got a microphone up there [Music] tell [Music] amen this was a phenomena that took place back on October the 1st and you could hear the trumpet sound in the background and this has been happening in other times and seasons and but this being so close to this event and the time and the season that we're living in now does it mean that it is the final Trump does it mean that you know we're going in the Rapture in 30 days or 60 I'm not giving you any kind of interpretation on but I'm letting you know of the things that are taking place that before God declares anything to the people he declares it in the heavens and you saw The Ring there like a trumpet like the end of a trumpet and you heard sound coming out of that and you know all the scientists would like to say well that's like a that's like a phenomena that takes place when certain atmospheric pressures move together and this happens yeah sure that's that's fine but who's the intelligence behind you there's an intelligence behind every event and every uh natural situation in the world and that that natural that that intelligence is God Amen it's that simple blessed be the name of the Lord and so you know these things are happening in the world and people are getting excited and imagine the children of Israel are getting excited to them you know the the conservative Jew and the rabbis they're they're looking at these events and they're saying something God is moving God is up to something the world is going through a dramatic change right now this is a world changing event amen next slide back in 2015 Donald Trump stood before a Christian organization with his Bible that was speaking to the Christian people and I don't know like you know this week I had a chance to I said you know what I got to I got to look into this guy I got to look into him I got to find out what's what you know and then you know I I I I came across some interviews where you know he was asked by a Christian minister by an organization saying uh Mr Trump have you ever asked God for forgiveness of your sins and he couldn't answer he couldn't answer it straight know wow you know i' I've looked at my life in such a way that you know I make mistakes and and then what I do to to you know I just I just my relationship with God is to make those things right but you know you know sure I made a mistakes and you know sure you know this and that but you know and all I could all I could see was that through every interview when it when it was with respect to Christianity and to the word of God we've been given the ability to discern the Lord's body amen and to recognize don't ever underestimate your faith in Christianity the faith that you got according to Christianity because 99% of the Christian world out there has an interpretation but they have not recognized what God has done in this day amen your ability to recognize what God is doing now just like when Jesus was on the earth remember when Jesus was on the earth there was only a handful a couple of handfuls that actually recognized that he was the word made flesh the rest of the world wanted to crucify him they didn't recognize the word because the word was clear all even the priests of that day they could not recognize the Fulfillment of scripture where he would you know where behold your king he comes riding into Jerusalem on the full on the ass of a mule they couldn't recognize that that was the Fulfillment of all the scriptures of the Old Testament saying that he was coming he was coming he's coming he's coming and they fail to recognize and they would always get caught up in the day that they were living in and looking at the leadership of the day that they were looking that they were living in don't miss this they were looking at the leadership of the countries and the Kings and all the great leaders and they were looking to them for an interpretation they go look into the pope a man for an interpretation they go look into to their priest or to their to their uh Pastor or or no that's not the Jesus Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and what he meant by that was that when he spoke to Peter and he asked him personally who do you say that I am never mind what your papa your mama your pastor your preacher or your Rabbi says I want to know who you say that I am and Peter caught a revelation you Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God you are the word made flesh you are the Messiah you're the you're the one that we're supposed to follow and Jesus turning says flesh and blood has not revealed this to you you were not taught it by by some teacher by by your Traditions that's not how you receive Christ in this day and in this hour the way to receive Christ is according to his word amen he says repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive receive the gift of the Holy Spirit which the Holy Spirit Jesus said would lead you into all truth I'm just trying to keep it simple we need to be reminded of these things and so we don't look at what the world interpretation is we look at what the word interpretation is because that is what you are going to be judged by on that day if you are not a son or daughter of God because the Sons and Daughters of God they go in the Rapture amen your judgment the sons and daughters the Judgment for them is right now they're being judged every day by their life by their character by their by their own conscience by the way that they live by trying to get their lives right with Christ amen amen because this flesh is not your friend it's your enemy it wants to do things like Paul said the things that I shouldn't do I do the things that I should do I don't do you will struggle with that the Bible says that the carnal mind is at enity with God Amen bless the Lord and so a lot of people Christians started to look at this Trump and say wait a minute he's God said he's he's he's the man that God has chosen to lead America this is our way of getting back our heritage next slide Christians have been pointing to the book of Isaiah comparing Trump and saying Cyrus the next scripture Cyrus who was whose name was pronounced Kesh in Hebrew became King of Persia in 559 BC and conquered Babylon in 539 BC he is mentioned in the Majestic passage in Isaiah where the Lord says Cyrus he is Shepherd now you got to realize Cyrus was a pagan he was not one of the Kings of Israel he is my shepherd and he shall fulfill all my purpose saying of Jerusalem she shall be built and and of the temple your foundation shall be laid could Donald Trump then be a modern-day Cyrus and I looked at this because you know these are some of the you know the arguments of Christianity today and they're trying to find where it is that he could possibly fit into the word of God and be God's chosen now remember what I said at the beginning God has a plan and God's will will be done he rose up individuals that were not Sons and Daughters of God they were pharaohs they were they had a purpose God hardened their hearts for a purpose God used many in the scriptures that did not they were only used in order to move Israel into her position move the Sons and Daughters of God into their position God has a way of applying the word of God in our day and we've got to be able to recognize the scripture and the prophecy that's being fulfilled and to see where we fit in and so what's clear though is that God did not raise up an idol worshiping King to rule the nation of isra that would have been a curse rather than a blessing so when we look at at Cyrus as being like uh someone that that that God would raise up to be king over Israel that wouldn't line up and so to say that that Donald Trump has been raised up to be king Over America over the Christian people of America because that's what they're doing they're taking him and saying this is this is how God is going to deliver us this is how God is going to deliver [Music] America before I even looked into this before I even looked into this to see what Christianity was saying this week earlier in the week and I was saying God he's your choice he's your choice he was your choice in this election regardless of how we look at it because nothing you are God you you you create the wealthy the you you place Kings you do you are God it's that Ser I don't have to argue or try to find some excuse or some way to justify what it is that's taking place he's God he's done it that's it that settles it but what came into my thoughts and into my heart was did I not raise up a pharaoh did I not use a Nebuchadnezzar to come and there was a Jeremiah in the land at that time and he was the only one that had the truth he was the only one that had thus sayth the Lord that recognized you go back and read and you know read about Jeremiah in the time when Nebuchadnezzar came in and wiped out Jerusalem Nebuchadnezzar even he even he even like you know he he he even like uh was bragging how God you're God he went to Jeremiah say you're God is given me this imagine so can God raise up a Nebuchadnezzar because if you look back at that year and at that time you will recognize that Israel was in a fallen condition she was totally backslid from God the leadership was absolutely totally corrupt come all the king every every part of the Kingdom from the King down to his Down To His prophets even down to His prophets those that he he he would look to for counsel and here we have witnessed in our day an America that is so corrupt in its in its political correctness that they've made this word of God of none effect to the people where the people will look to political correctness instead of looking to the word of God Amen so God can raise up a Nebuchadnezzar God can raise up somebody because I want you to note that the prophecy for America according to the Revelation that we have received through a prophet of Malachi 45 William maryi and Brenham does not talk about an America that's going to be rebuilt up like Cyrus did on that's not the season that we're living in we need to recognize the they were're in and to see what the word of God says what the prophecy says about America now these are not our own interpretations Saints this is in the word of God you can find it in the Book of Revelation what it says about America the 13th chapter of Revelations 13 stripes States 13 13 she's the number of 13 there's nothing really too good to look forward to in America I hate to be the bearer of this news but it's the prophecy of the word we are entering into perilous times we are entering into the final moments of time as we know it amen and so Israel has gotten America a type of Israel back there in the book of Jeremiah Was that they were completely gone from God they did not want to hear God's word they did they did not want to rule by God's word they wanted to rule by their own interpretation by their pride and by their by their their their their their their their standards and their liberal de Democratic uh teachings in the way that the world should be and the the future of of the nation and and the new New Age movement they want to move by their own interpretation but the word of God does not back that up next slide so he too was an idol worshipper there was another Ancient King named Nebuchadnezzar the Babylonian leader who decades before Cyrus became king led his armies to destroy Jerusalem burn down the temple and send the Jewish people into Exile in 58 6 BC he too is an idol worshipper yet shockingly God called him my servant stating plainly behold I will send for all the tribes of the north declares the Lord and there's another one in the north that we've been told about the King of the North Russia oh yeah Russia and they're not exactly you know they were they they they wanted Trump [Music] the only reason they wanted Trump was because they just couldn't quite get a handle on this woman that's right they couldn't quite get a handle on her and they couldn't control her and and and the and the the the the the Democratic party and the and the power that was behind it but that P you know that party got smashed you know that they didn't expect what happened to them they were shocked just as much as 95% of the other people out there and you wonder well hang on a minute here if 95% of the people you talk to I talked to 10 people n nine of them say I thought it was going to be clean n out of 10 yeah but yet he wins not just not just the presidency the goop the Congress he's got he's got he's got like where his party basically in control they're basically in control and I can imagine that Democratic power that's that's been so strong that's been so you know because if you look into the Republican party and you look into their to their teachings and their history and their background they're very conservative they're like they're more like the farmer you know like the natural farmer that wants to just have things right they're like they're like yeah papa comes home Mama's got a meal ready for me not the Democrats honey you got my meal ready what cook your own meal you know I've been working all day quiet I'm busy just look into it you will see the Republicans they have that that old they're they're more they're more like go to church on Sunday not like the Democrats we I want to church Christmas Easter you know you look into it but God did something and I believe this is a a this is a very significant time Saints this is a a a historical event not only is it a historical event but when you look at Israel and you look at the blood wounds you look at the season you look at all the years the Year of Jubilee last year all of the things that have taken place in the time and the season that we're living in and these events line right up with it all and then you see an earth shattering this this was an earth shattering [Music] event it's only the beginning there was another earthquake this morning in in uh New Zealand 7.4 on the RoR scale there's there's birth pains taking place constantly Saints and this was one of the earthshaking events politically in the world where there's been a shift of power amen and I want you to know something it was God's will it's part of God's plan it's part of God's purpose and what he's doing in this day and in this hour and we don't need to be shaken we don't need to be uh uh you know Fall Fallen away because we we thought that it had to be exactly you know that brother BR said it be a woman president he did say that amen she might be read this read the go back and read all the quotes I went back and read them all and and and it's like in such a way God always does things in such a way that if you get too lck you know he's not looking for that he's looking for somebody that can catch inspiration that can recognize what his mind his thoughts his ways his will and desire for the for for for for the Sons and Daughters of God because remember things will be said and done in such a way that will take others away why because they were not of the scripture they're not of the kingdom of God they're not Sons and Daughters of God a lot of people say everybody's a son and daughter of God no amen if that was true then this word is a lie cuz that's not what the scripture says I can show you scriptures that talk both the sons of God and the the sons of that Wicked one the seed of God and the seed of that Wicked one God brought life everything exists by the life of God yes amen everything has an existence by the life of God because he is life amen but then there's those who were with God before the foundations of the world and those are the sons and daughters the attri rutes of God all God did was Express those attributes into a dimension called Earth and place them into Earthly vessels and use them for a time and a season so that when the time and season came just like now we are those Earth and vessels we are the ones that God is using right now to to to show what is the manifestation of the word of God we're not making ourselves special I want to make that clear here cuz a lot of people might think oh what you think you're better than anybody else no no better than anybody else I could tell you about my past it was ugly you a lot of you know about it but it's irrelevant God says my future is clear and that's why I Rejoice because he forgave me of my past he washed away my past he gave me an ability to recognize what he's doing in in his day in the day that we're living in right now my day and I can rejoice and only be thankful
