TRANSCRIPT
========================================
because your Revelation your understanding of the word that is given you has PR you into that place amen praise God Anointed with the Holy Ghost you opening up your understanding to the word so you know him in his fullness we don't have a paral revelation of God but all was in him in him was the fullness give him who the word and now the word has opened up and the full this man know to you the man with the water is now pouring out the world Hallelujah and we can receive all that we want by the grace of godall oh praise God the church is no longer the mpce of God God is turning away from her you just have to look out there and see that he's turning away from is it right not when she walks into the church walks into the church with charts on MH like I told you my wife and I was going somewhere and we saw a certain church and the pastor's wife and all the ladies in the church were coming up with bikinis out of the church they were just locking the door going to the swimming pool and they were going to have a swim praise the name of the Lord hallelujah this is what the church has come down to and then they have all kinds of promotions and they have all kinds of stuff going on and you know selling this and selling that and selling the other and all kinds of of programs and this and that nothing is wrong with the church having certain kinds of programs inocent but my goodness everywhere manages for this and that and everything else going on praise God bringing in every kind of fou bird inside of the church amen amen you know what some of them would even invite um uh what what what I can't remember these names of this modern uh lady guy I'm tell if if she were to tell some of these churches that I'd like to come and uh perform for you on Sunday morning is all the doors open white they're not even going to talk or discuss anything with her they don't at the door uh wi like that amen and then uh when we have certain uh standards that we keep by the word they're going to say oh they're strange yes there something's wrong with them they're not living up to this but God don't change God don't never change he Remains the Same God Amen Hallelujah praise God the message Remains the Same hallelujah amen the method of how you deliver it or you carry it may change the transportation may change whether it's a bicycle a carriage and L around a car and then L from a car you know you go to rockets and everything else so the the the carrying the transportation of the message that may change but the message itself does not change amen praise the Lord hallelujah so that's where we have to place our fa now God says clearly that with all the wisdom of these churches around you sometimes you tend to get a complex a spiritual complex you know uh but but he says God will confound amen he will confound them in this last day true the message the Prophet The Bride for there will be the voice of God and the voice of God will be in her amen praise God forever you w have to think what you have to say or what you going to do in that hour for the father that dwells in you will speak through you is that right says Don't Fear when you become up before the judge and he tries to scare anybody H from the G he speak the truth I already speak the truth you don't have to knock the G for me to speak the truth that's all I know how to speak amen so we are not we Fearless because it's our father in US amen and don't feel a complex oh I'm not educated no I don't know how to answer this I don't know the message God didn't ask you what you know you ask what you believe is that right he didn't ask you to be successful he ask you to be faithful if you Happ to be successful and faithful then it's wonderful but the fact is your faith must be in God our secret weapon is revelation he said the devil hates it why because one minute the person knows nothing and the next moment all of a sudden something comes out of their mouth that confs the devil this him my heart attack right man he he he's whipping his tail all over the place and he doesn't know what to do because he's in confusion cuz the father just speaks right out amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah I told the story of a brother that wasn't educated thought and uh somebody was commiting his a vehicle and because he wouldn't sell it for the price they wanted they got mad because he wouldn't sell them at the price they wanted and punched him in the mouth and broke his teeth and it was in the night in a parking lot amen I should say punch they hit him in the mouth and broke his teeth and so it came up as a before the courts the police came and came up before the court so the the lawyer came up and says my good man on the night of so so were you withness he says yes sir says and you made a claim that my client was also there he says yes sir he says and you made a claim that my client uh bash you in the teeth with a with a iron with a pipe or some iron object he says yes sir he says now uh according to the weather there was no moon on that night that part not had no lights it was dark it was very dark how can you say that my time hit you on your mouth with a with iron pipe and the brother got mad he's in court but he for God himself and before he could think he said do you have to see a fight when it hit you in the mouth and break it oh Court started laughing because you don't have to see it you just got to feel it right even the judge started laughing said dismiss give the man his and give the brother his settlement of whatever he had to have but he didn't know what to do and he got mad and before you know he spoke out and and there was the answer right there you don't need to see it to know what hit you is iron pipe when iron pipe get you and people started laughing at the lawyer and even the judge laugh so God speaks through you in simple words and don't second guess yourself but trust God that he does live in you and he will speak through you and because it's in his interest so he says the spirit in the on the bride say come so you see once more the world will again hear directly from God as it was on the day of pente cross but of course the the word Bride for doing that will be repated just as in the first age what does all this gathering together mean talking about the problem what is all of this about message you know H these men are drunken as we suppose right mocking the Bible say and they mockingly said these men are drunk as we supposed and then Peter stood up and says this is that spoken by the prophet William BR amen amen what going happen over there in Los Angeles California that was spoken by the prophet William amen this catching way that's going on that was spoken by the prophet William BR the Lord and took the scriptures and show them from Joel 238 that that is the prophecy that was now being fulfilled in them and we have a right to show Malachi 4:5 Revelation 10:7 that voice is in us and that's what in fulfillingness hour and that's what that's what separates us from every other bird we are the speal bird what a beautiful God Amen sprinkled with the blood of your M amen because he died for us and sprinkled us with his prous love Hallelujah one the female was there the male was killed and the blood as he fled on the altar sprayed on the priest and sprayed on the wings of that white do and sprinkled her with his own blood and then the high priest would pick up that D and release it to go free amen that's what exactly happened to us we've been sprinkled by the blood of christe [Applause] oh praise God redeem them how happy I am I don't know about you but I'm happy I'm excited by the grace of God hallelujah he says so once again they'll hear from the voice of God in these last days and he has said you have the word we have more Bibles in this age than ever before how many knows that more B is now printed than ever before amen but you are not doing anything about the word except dividing it up packing it into pieces amen taking what you want and leaving out the rest of what you don't want you are not interested in living it you are more interesting in debating it have you found people like that they're not interested in you having a good fellowship with them they want to prove that that they have some H Doctrine that's this and that and you afterward they more interested in debating it rather I would soon let you were cold or hot if you were cold I would reject you if you would get white heart to move the truth and live it I would praise you but when you simply take my word and don't honor it in return I must refuse you and dishonor you amen praise the Lord hallelujah that's the day we're living in brothers and sisters praise God aren't you happy that you can say your one that praise God hallelujah uh from these text that I have in front of me I'm turning a corner from from one place rep restoration and preparation for the Rapture I'm going into another Direction right now but what happens is that for me to do that I'll have to continue on for quite a while and if you're prepared to stay for another 2 hours then is that okay hallelujah oh one person said hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah I I I believe I shared enough with you because I teach on Wednesday nights right I do a lot of teaching Wednesday night praise God um Sunday morning

the Lord hallelujah amen glory to God may the Lord bless you I'm I'm going to stop now about speaking about this voice uh of the rapture we are the voice of that Rapture you praise the Lord you the bo the so that's all we got to talk about now there's nothing else left for us he said there is no future but the coming of the Lord what is left for you and me what are we living for We Living For The Rapture praise God so that's what we actually have to talk about is the rapture time that is upon us by the grace of God may the Lord bless every one of you real good and I trust that we'll see you on Sunday night uh Wednesday night you're ready to be here and you should be here and Friday night is our prayer meeting amen next Sunday morning we come back in the presence of God you can't receive everything on one day but little by little is that right what did he say to Joshua he said I can deliver you right now today I can give you victory over the whole land amen but he says I want he says
