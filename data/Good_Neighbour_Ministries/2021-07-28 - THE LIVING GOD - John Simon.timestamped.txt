[0:46] the hills of home they're calling me
[0:49] may you hear the call may you feel the
[0:53] pull
[0:54] may you recognize that the lord god of
[0:57] heaven
[0:58] is giving his last altar call
[1:01] and calling his children to his side

[1:12] are going back to him the word of god
[1:15] and i'm happy to be here with you and to
[1:19] share with you the word of god for this
[1:23] day
[1:23] and for this hour we will
[1:26] read tonight out of the scriptures
[1:30] revelation chapter 2
[1:33] reading from verse 23 and
[1:38] 24. amen
[1:42] and i will
[1:45] kill her children with death
[1:49] i will kill her which means jezebel's
[1:53] children
[1:55] with death and all the churches
[2:00] shall know that i am he
[2:04] which search at the reigns on hearts
[2:08] and i will give unto
[2:11] every one of you according
[2:14] to your works
[2:17] here ends our scripture reading a
[2:20] gracious
[2:21] righteous loving heavenly father
[2:25] we ask your blessing upon this
[2:28] the bread of life break
[2:32] thou this bread of life lord
[2:35] quicken us together lift us
[2:38] up into your divine presence
[2:41] and lord give us a clear crystal
[2:44] clear waters from the rivers of life
[2:48] that flows by the trees that beareth
[2:51] all the fruits of god amen
[2:55] may a great holy spirit now bless us
[2:57] father one and all
[2:59] everywhere within the divine sound of
[3:02] the gospel of jesus
[3:04] christ and to the glory of your eternal
[3:07] kingdom
[3:08] this we ask in jesus name
[3:12] amen and amen
[3:16] god the god
[3:19] of the living
[3:22] in our last talk we
[3:26] spoke about this woman jezebel
[3:31] her evil our wicked
[3:35] uh heart and her evil acts
[3:40] we spoke of our evil deeds
[3:43] of the children
[3:47] she bore and that took
[3:50] her teachings her way of life
[3:55] followed in her footsteps and
[3:58] did whatsoever she did
[4:03] now in israel we know
[4:06] that if jezebel did not only
[4:10] married ahab
[4:14] but in judah she
[4:17] got her daughter to marry
[4:21] jehoram the king
[4:24] of judah at that time
[4:29] and the minute or the moment
[4:32] that that marriage took place
[4:35] between jehoram and jezebel's
[4:40] daughter that moment
[4:44] the tribe of judah began to
[4:47] die spiritually
[4:51] we find out friends
[4:54] in the same manner the moment
[4:57] rome married herself
[5:01] to organization
[5:05] systems religious systems
[5:09] of religious orders and of how to set
[5:13] up or organize
[5:16] religion
[5:19] that moment the church of the living god
[5:25] died death began to
[5:28] set in to the church
[5:32] and which you know she went into the
[5:35] dark ages
[5:37] before she could have a resurrection
[5:42] by lutheran revival
[5:45] then the wesleyan revival
[5:50] then later on out of the methodist
[5:54] or wesleyan revival came
[5:58] the great move of god
[6:01] the pentecostal revival
[6:05] took place and the moment the
[6:08] pentecostals
[6:10] began to organize
[6:13] themselves into
[6:17] organizational groups oneness
[6:20] trinitarian
[6:22] this that various various
[6:25] names of blasphemy
[6:28] they literally my friends
[6:32] the moment they received organization
[6:36] and established themselves by
[6:39] organization
[6:41] spiritual death set in
[6:44] upon that move of god which started
[6:49] originally genuinely from the hand of
[6:52] god
[6:53] corrupted by satan with his
[6:57] organizational strategies
[7:00] causing the church to fall
[7:04] into death now of course
[7:08] we know that
[7:11] the church married herself
[7:15] as jezebel uh ahab married jezebel
[7:18] so has the church married herself to
[7:21] false doctrine
[7:24] ahab married jezebel who was the
[7:27] priestess of paganism
[7:30] and now the modern church has married
[7:34] itself to
[7:36] false doctrine and
[7:39] denomination or let's use the word
[7:43] married or joined herself too
[7:46] it's as if you joined a denomination
[7:50] you married yourself under that
[7:53] denominational
[7:54] name as a woman takes on the man's name
[7:58] they have taken on the name of baptist
[8:00] mother this catholic
[8:02] uh presbyterian united
[8:05] whatever the name might be they took
[8:08] that name on and like many women
[8:12] today they want to add a second
[8:15] name which it might be
[8:18] you know smith
[8:22] brown or whatever in that same
[8:26] way they want to say i'm a baptist
[8:28] christian
[8:30] no you're either a christian or you're a
[8:32] baptist
[8:33] you're either a christian or you're a
[8:35] catholic
[8:37] oh praise god you take on the
[8:40] name of jesus christ hallelujah and his
[8:44] name is the only name we bear
[8:47] the name of a genuine true
[8:50] christian and so we are
[8:54] not to marry ourselves to organization
[8:59] for uh to marry yourself to an
[9:01] organization
[9:02] is to enter into a downward
[9:06] slide you may feel
[9:09] exhilarated you may feel uplifted
[9:13] naturally speaking but spiritually
[9:16] you have entered into the realms of
[9:19] spiritual death
[9:21] because death or organization
[9:25] comes and the church dies
[9:28] the individual dies i want to thank god
[9:34] using for a theme tonight
[9:38] we are not the god of the dead or of
[9:41] organization
[9:42] we are a god of the living of the living
[9:46] word
[9:47] amen so we are we are children of
[9:50] god the living god we live
[9:54] by the word we walk with
[9:57] the word of god organization is
[10:01] death amen death anyone that
[10:05] joins themselves to organization
[10:09] has joined themselves to spiritual
[10:12] death and are doomed to die
[10:16] the death spiritually speaking
[10:20] amen hallelujah my friends
[10:23] here we are eve just as
[10:26] much as eve brought
[10:30] death to the entire human
[10:33] race and so now
[10:37] organization has brought
[10:40] death to any move of god
[10:44] any revival that god gives
[10:48] organizational structures
[10:51] and they're masters of it at this time
[10:55] it has become a science it's become a
[10:58] religious science
[11:00] that is teachable in universities
[11:05] in various colleges they have developed
[11:09] sciences of how to replicate
[11:12] how to multiply it how to do it
[11:16] they learn all the sciences of religion
[11:20] and how to pass that on
[11:23] but my friends the genuine
[11:26] spirit of god by real election
[11:30] and by revelation can not
[11:34] be given to anyone else god himself is
[11:38] the only one
[11:40] that can transform that supernatural
[11:44] knowledge and wisdom and teaching and
[11:46] upbringing
[11:48] that we all need from the hands of our
[11:51] heavenly
[11:52] father amen the church
[11:56] through the vehicle of organization
[12:00] organization of course brings into
[12:04] your life and into the life of that
[12:07] church the twin
[12:10] corrupters the twin demons
[12:14] of nicolasianism and
[12:17] balaamism and uh
[12:21] they're usually propagated by
[12:24] jezebel back there now by the
[12:27] false church in this hour that they are
[12:31] propagating
[12:33] that kind of a teaching and atmosphere
[12:37] within their ranks of total obedience
[12:42] and my friends here it is in the word of
[12:45] god
[12:46] now we know that eve should have been
[12:50] judged along with the serpent
[12:53] amen she only had a partial judgment
[12:57] but adam
[13:00] intervened on her behalf
[13:03] amen hallelujah and by
[13:06] joining himself to her his wife
[13:10] she was saved or redeemed by marriage
[13:14] through the grace of god the oneness
[13:18] with
[13:18] adam is what saved her because
[13:22] for god to slay her
[13:26] he would have to slay himself he'd have
[13:29] to slay
[13:29] adam and destroy this great work so
[13:34] we are so happy today that
[13:37] when we were in sin we walked the ways
[13:41] of sin we wandered away in darkness
[13:46] we allowed ourselves to be tossed and
[13:49] tempted
[13:50] and driven along by the tides of time
[13:54] but thank god jesus christ
[13:58] my friends has inserted himself into
[14:02] our experiences oh glory be to god
[14:06] hallelujah
[14:07] and he has intervened on our behalf
[14:11] the bible tells us but he was
[14:14] wounded for our transgressions he was
[14:18] bruised for our iniquities the
[14:21] chastisement
[14:22] of our peace was upon him and by his
[14:26] traits we are healed oh thank god
[14:30] we are healed because he intervened
[14:34] he took stood before us and
[14:37] took the spear trusts the sword trusts
[14:41] the nail prints the scoffings the
[14:44] mockings
[14:46] and everything else and has redeemed us
[14:50] because we have you been we are united
[14:53] with him
[14:54] true faith in his name indeed
[14:57] we serve a god of the living
[15:00] the living word of god we serve it all
[15:04] our hearts and with all our lives
[15:08] of course this satanic
[15:12] religion coming down
[15:17] from babylon through jezebel and many
[15:19] other
[15:20] uh various individuals
[15:25] has snaked his way in the trail of the
[15:29] serpent
[15:30] down to our day in our time
[15:35] through the ages in so much
[15:39] that the church has again
[15:42] wandered away from her husband
[15:45] the word finds herself
[15:49] under the charming spell
[15:52] of the evil serpent of genesis
[15:56] now in the supernatural form
[16:00] of satanic religion and influence
[16:04] and has wandered away from
[16:07] the original word of god
[16:11] and she now has no one
[16:17] to intervene on her behalf
[16:22] all that is left that we can see ahead
[16:27] is judgment only for the elect
[16:31] we see rapture resurrection
[16:35] and next after that oh
[16:38] there's darkness of tribulation
[16:42] and the ages of judgment that are to
[16:45] come
[16:46] one day the fire will not just be on the
[16:49] west coast
[16:51] oh the fire will fall from the heavens
[16:55] oh praise god all my friends
[16:58] let us see clearly here she the
[17:02] modern church will be burnt
[17:05] by the supernatural fires of god
[17:09] burnt along with her seducer
[17:13] that liar from the beginning the
[17:16] serpent who was not a
[17:19] snake as we visualize it in our seat
[17:23] today
[17:24] because we know it was a
[17:27] is the missing link between man
[17:31] and the animals in between
[17:34] was the serpent whom the bible says
[17:37] was one who could walk who could talk
[17:40] the bible says he
[17:42] was intelligent subtle
[17:45] smart everything else like that
[17:48] built like a man shaped like a man
[17:50] looked like a man
[17:52] but my friends he had a place for a soul
[17:56] but no place in him no soul no
[18:01] soul inside of him or empty
[18:04] caverns and here my friends she will
[18:07] have
[18:08] no one to intervene
[18:12] on her behalf because she allowed
[18:15] herself to be seduced
[18:17] by this father of lies in this
[18:21] last day and that harlot
[18:26] and her children and the antichrist
[18:31] and satan himself will all
[18:35] find their places in the
[18:38] lake of fire amen revelation
[18:42] 18 when you have the time read that
[18:47] and you will read the burning of the
[18:50] false
[18:50] church where the prophet
[18:53] john speaks saying he looked and saw
[18:57] a man and also heard a voice
[19:01] saying whoa whoa whoa
[19:05] whoa for in one hour
[19:09] babylon has fallen she has fallen
[19:13] she has fallen and the bible describes
[19:17] the
[19:17] scene of the smoke
[19:20] and the blossoms of flame that were
[19:23] going everywhere
[19:25] while this great mystery babylon
[19:29] was being burned by the supernatural
[19:32] fires of the living god and then the
[19:36] bible said it'll take one hour
[19:38] only that special fire is gonna
[19:41] burn her in one hour and
[19:44] all the merchants the kings of the earth
[19:48] and many others that joined with
[19:52] her in this evil worldwide
[19:55] system of corruption
[19:59] through the instrumentality of
[20:02] denomination
[20:04] flowing out of babylon those natural
[20:07] rivers
[20:08] now we have the spiritual
[20:11] rivers of babylon that are flowing full
[20:14] today
[20:15] and my friends reproducing
[20:18] evil oh my friends think about
[20:22] it let the holy spirit
[20:25] guide you and take your thoughts
[20:28] and move beyond the boundaries
[20:32] of human thinking think of how the
[20:35] living
[20:36] god so merciful
[20:40] that after the church failed
[20:44] amen the early church
[20:47] fell then the catholic
[20:51] church from the nicene council
[20:55] took the word of god originally they
[20:57] started out
[20:59] with the genuine water baptism
[21:03] in the name of jesus christ oh
[21:07] and they fell away from the original
[21:10] face of one god to three
[21:14] and then went into the dark ages
[21:18] out of which came the lutheran
[21:22] movement from the womb
[21:25] or bowels of the catholic church for she
[21:30] was the harlot of she is the harlot of
[21:33] revelation
[21:35] where she bore children and
[21:38] the first one was the lutheran
[21:42] uh group and out of whom
[21:45] later came the methodists and then
[21:49] later came the pentecostal
[21:52] groups but when the pentecost died when
[21:58] she accepted
[21:59] organization and died
[22:02] god went outside of the
[22:06] pentecostal ranks god went into the
[22:09] highways the byways the hedges
[22:12] the little house churches the little
[22:14] groups the little
[22:15] men and no bodies the street corners the
[22:18] brush harbors
[22:20] wherever there could be true
[22:23] sons and daughters of god to be found
[22:26] god found them hallelujah
[22:29] and god used the voice of the
[22:33] seventh angel william marion branham
[22:38] to call out his children what
[22:42] not by the attraction of the things of
[22:44] the world
[22:45] but first by the first pull of healing
[22:49] the first attraction through his healing
[22:51] ministry
[22:53] and a greater attraction by his
[22:56] discerning
[22:57] of the spirits of men and
[23:00] now the last attraction
[23:03] the pull of christ if i be
[23:07] lifted up i'll draw men unto myself
[23:11] here he comes the revelation
[23:14] of the word of god oh to some
[23:18] it will be like dry manna that they at
[23:21] over and over again in the wilderness
[23:25] and they began to despise it but the
[23:27] real
[23:28] true believer amen hallelujah
[23:31] the word of god is all the attraction
[23:35] they need whoa music is fine
[23:38] and we love to have that and it's great
[23:41] if we have it
[23:42] all the other wonderful additions and
[23:46] uh flowery stuff we can have around it
[23:49] it's
[23:49] marvelous and wonderful and it's good to
[23:52] have
[23:53] but my friends the genuine attraction
[23:57] is to have let the word
[24:00] have his true place of
[24:03] preeminence leadership and
[24:07] headship over the body
[24:10] of jesus christ hallelujah
[24:14] and so the word of god
[24:17] the holy spirit went beyond
[24:21] the pentecostal groups for you can't put
[24:24] god in a box shut the box and think
[24:28] you're going to keep him in there
[24:30] i tell you brother the jail house has
[24:34] rocked and the prisoners are loose
[24:37] amen oh praise god they're loosed
[24:41] but they're not just loose but wild like
[24:44] to themselves their prisoners to christ
[24:47] hallelujah
[24:48] and they're led by the word of the
[24:51] living god
[24:52] moving with him and led by
[24:55] his spirit amen o praise club
[24:59] and so a healing discerning
[25:03] revival swept the world
[25:06] under the message amen
[25:09] of the seventh angel of revelation 10
[25:13] verse 7 bringing the word of
[25:16] god prophesied in the bible for
[25:20] this day and for this time many will not
[25:23] accept it
[25:24] but to those for whom this is ordained
[25:28] this is foreordained god's spirit is
[25:32] calling
[25:33] god's spirit is speaking god's spirit
[25:36] is directing his word to his elected
[25:40] bride
[25:40] and calling her to attention of his word
[25:44] that revival has swept the world
[25:48] many of them think many think
[25:52] that because william branham
[25:56] is dead and died in a car crash
[26:00] very similar to elijah going up in a
[26:03] fiery chariot
[26:04] uh of those days this one goes up in a
[26:07] chariot
[26:08] of this day but there it is my friends
[26:13] they think because he lived there
[26:17] and died and he prayed for
[26:20] thousands and none prayed for him
[26:25] while he laid there the midst
[26:28] the carnage and the wreckage of that car
[26:33] but his message which they thought would
[26:38] die and maybe it's dried up and died and
[26:41] gone away
[26:42] and disappeared many have tried to
[26:44] insert themselves
[26:47] to become the next leader of this
[26:49] message
[26:50] not understanding that the message has
[26:54] its leader already
[26:55] for the leader is the god of heaven the
[26:58] living god
[26:59] most high the holy spirit
[27:02] is here to lead and to guide the church
[27:06] the great pillar of fire is here to
[27:09] lead and to guide his church once again
[27:13] to the glory of god amen
[27:16] that his message i swept the world
[27:21] revival fires a burning everywhere
[27:26] name the country name the nation
[27:29] you see all the iron curtain uh
[27:33] of russia you say oh the bamboo curtain
[27:36] of china you say oh the purple
[27:40] curtain of rome i want to tell you
[27:43] right in rome i've preached into
[27:47] churches that believe the message of
[27:50] william branham
[27:51] of this seventh angel of revelation 10.
[27:54] amen there are multitudes of churches
[27:58] behind the iron curtain amen hallelujah
[28:02] all the brothers are doing great work
[28:04] there
[28:05] the message is spreading everywhere
[28:08] and behind the bamboo curtain oh
[28:12] my friends they're our brothers and our
[28:14] sisters in christ
[28:16] hallelujah holding to god's unchanging
[28:19] hand
[28:20] pressing on with the word of god they
[28:23] walk in a way of
[28:24] peace yet they're thought to be
[28:27] intruders
[28:28] they are thought to be contrary oh
[28:32] but we are the sons and daughters of the
[28:35] heavens amen
[28:36] we are sons and daughters of the living
[28:39] god
[28:39] that he has sent down here to live on
[28:42] this earth
[28:43] and to carry out his divine will plans
[28:46] and purposes
[28:47] for his glory and for his honor oh
[28:50] thank god amen yes brother sister
[28:54] when you have some time i want to urge
[28:58] you to read
[28:59] revelation chapter 20. amen

[29:14] rise of the beast out of the sea

[29:22] of the burning of the false church
[29:26] revelation 20 you will find
[29:29] not only will she be literally
[29:33] burnt naturally here on the earth
[29:36] but in the great hereafter she will be
[29:40] burnt without the in the lake of
[29:43] fire revelation 21
[29:48] verse 18 the bible
[29:52] reads clearly thus let me
[29:55] read that revelations 21

[30:02] but the fearful and the unbelieving
[30:06] and the abominable and the
[30:10] murderers and the whoremongers
[30:14] and sorcerers and
[30:18] idolaters and
[30:21] all liars amen
[30:25] shall have their part in the
[30:28] lake of fire which burn it
[30:32] with fire and brimstone
[30:35] which is the second
[30:38] death this is not just natural death
[30:42] but this is spiritual death
[30:45] the second death of extinction amen
[30:50] where that one will be birthed
[30:54] amen for hell we know
[30:57] is not eternal oh
[31:01] that's another subject hell is not
[31:04] eternal
[31:05] but there will be burnt to
[31:08] crisp in the lake of fire
[31:12] as the word of god has said
[31:16] oh blessed be the name read revelation
[31:20] 13 read and understand of this beast
[31:25] that rises from amongst the rest of the
[31:29] people
[31:29] the sea now
[31:32] looking at the power
[31:36] in this modern age through every age
[31:40] the power of the roman
[31:43] catholic church
[31:47] and how she has risen in her power
[31:52] through her magnificence
[31:55] of her organizational skills
[31:59] and abilities through the myriad
[32:03] uh minds of skillful
[32:07] men yes sir oh hallelujah but remember
[32:13] glorious wonderful admirable
[32:16] as she will appear outwardly
[32:19] my friends she is
[32:23] the representation of the false vine
[32:26] amen hallelujah and
[32:30] she does not take the name
[32:33] of the lord but she takes the way
[32:37] of satan oh praise
[32:40] god and we find out that her
[32:44] end will be completely identified
[32:47] with the beast and everything that he
[32:51] does for we see it in the bible
[32:55] how this woman is robbed in the
[32:58] scarlet or the clothing of royalty
[33:02] riding on what the beast
[33:06] she is empowered she's transported his
[33:09] carriage is supported
[33:11] by beast power of satan
[33:16] operating in her midst inspiring
[33:20] as he did with the serpent in the garden
[33:23] now he inspires multi-face
[33:27] and even gives every kind of
[33:30] thought word and act to be carried out
[33:35] yes sir our powers the power of the
[33:38] god of force amen the god of war
[33:43] satan yes sir and not of
[33:46] our god the prince of peace who is jesus
[33:50] christ
[33:52] amen here we see verse 17
[33:57] the bible tells us how
[34:00] that church or
[34:03] the catholic church will
[34:07] soon very soon she will come
[34:11] come control all of the commerce
[34:15] of this earth this is not some
[34:18] conspiracy this is not some man-made
[34:22] teaching this is not some man spouting
[34:25] his own words it's in your bible
[34:28] read it in the word of god god has said
[34:32] it
[34:33] clearly that she will control after a
[34:36] while
[34:37] all the comers of the earth right now
[34:41] you may not recognize it
[34:42] but she is behind most if not many
[34:46] of the companies corporations
[34:50] major ones in the world today
[34:53] she's not there personally her money is
[34:55] there her influence is there
[34:57] she's on the board somewhere she's in
[35:00] the background
[35:01] somewhere her influence is everywhere
[35:05] amen they have a headship but their
[35:08] headship is not of god
[35:10] amen it's not of the lord i tell you my
[35:13] friends
[35:14] and so she gains control over the
[35:17] commerce of the earth
[35:19] revelation 18 9 to 17
[35:23] the bible tells us that this church
[35:27] becomes involved with kings
[35:29] with merchants with princes with all
[35:32] these of the earth and control
[35:36] of the commerce comes about
[35:39] revelation 13 verse 14
[35:43] we learn that the beast begins to spread
[35:47] his power and influence through
[35:51] that image of a church of the church
[35:54] that he has built he begins to spread
[35:57] out
[35:58] his influence right through there
[36:01] amen and that image is shaping and
[36:05] forming itself
[36:06] amen right into a world
[36:10] ecumenical counselor of world council of
[36:12] churches
[36:13] amen all the organizational
[36:17] uh churches going back to their harlot
[36:21] mother into a oneness
[36:24] and then they'll turn against
[36:27] all the rest of the faithful few
[36:31] and you are with us or you're against us
[36:35] you join us or we'll destroy you that
[36:38] will be their battle cry
[36:40] and then you will have to answer
[36:44] for that at that particular time
[36:47] all my friends just my friends
[36:51] i want to tell you
[36:54] communism which all
[36:58] may believe is dead
[37:02] will rise again it
[37:06] must rise again because
[37:09] god has spoken in his word that he will
[37:13] use the iron curtain
[37:17] of communism to destroy
[37:20] the purple curtain of rome it
[37:23] is spoken in the word of god

[37:44] am not a communist i don't believe in
[37:47] communism
[37:48] i have nothing to do with it but looking
[37:51] at the word of god you can see nothing
[37:54] else
[37:54] but communism spoken by
[37:58] the prophet of malachi 4 5 will
[38:01] rise again to destroy
[38:05] the harlot church the false church
[38:09] it will destroy her god raise them up
[38:12] oh russia king of the north
[38:15] god will use them hallelujah
[38:18] i believe russia itself will
[38:21] soon begin to experience a marvelous
[38:25] manifest revival that cannot be stopped
[38:28] by
[38:29] man governments forces
[38:32] human force because it will be a
[38:35] sweeping gale
[38:36] of the spirit of the living god sweeping
[38:39] through the land
[38:41] blessing those wonderful righteous
[38:44] brothers
[38:44] sisters christians some who are right
[38:47] now
[38:48] eating from jezebel's table in the
[38:51] denominational
[38:52] church because they know nothing better
[38:55] but
[38:55] here comes the word of god here comes
[38:58] the voice of god in these last days
[39:01] here comes the bride amen the
[39:04] manifestation

[39:11] living god
[39:12] amen praise god praise god
[39:16] it's not communism rail is your enemy
[39:19] oh that's a strong man it will serve its
[39:22] purpose
[39:23] it's the public curtain of rome that you
[39:27] should be
[39:28] wary of and recognize there's
[39:31] danger back of that my friends
[39:34] revelation 13 1 to 4
[39:38] compared with revelation 12
[39:41] 1-5 along with revelation
[39:45] 13 1 to 4
[39:49] and i stood upon the sand of the sea
[39:53] and saw a beast rise up out
[39:56] of the sea having seven heads
[40:00] and ten horns and upon his horns
[40:05] ten crowns and upon his heads
[40:09] the name of blasphemy amen
[40:13] oh revelation of the voice christ who is
[40:18] like unto the beast and who is able
[40:21] to go out and make war with him
[40:24] then revelation 12 1-5 and there
[40:27] appeared a great wonder in heaven
[40:30] a woman clothed with the sun
[40:34] and the moon under her feet and upon her
[40:37] head
[40:38] a crown of twelve stars
[40:41] and she being with child cried
[40:44] travailing
[40:44] in birth and pain to be delivered
[40:48] and there appeared another wonder in the
[40:51] heaven
[40:52] and behold a great red dragon
[40:55] oh having seven heads ten horns
[40:59] seven crowns upon his heads and his tail
[41:04] drew the third part of the stars
[41:08] of heaven and cast them to the earth
[41:12] and the dragon stood before the woman
[41:15] which was ready to be delivered
[41:18] to devour her child as soon
[41:22] as it was born and she brought forth a
[41:25] man-child
[41:27] hallelujah who was to rule
[41:30] all nations
[41:34] with a rod of iron and her child was
[41:37] caught up
[41:38] unto god and to his throne
[41:41] hallelujah amen so
[41:45] satan and his satanic religion
[41:49] are represented by these
[41:52] beasts that we have just read
[41:56] about for the first beast was wounded
[41:59] unto death but lived again
[42:02] and that represents imperial
[42:06] military rome that was
[42:09] destroyed and defeated and
[42:12] faded away but out of the
[42:15] death of militaristic
[42:18] and imperial rome rose
[42:22] people rome religious rome
[42:26] rose out of that in other words satan
[42:30] seeing
[42:31] his defeat under the militaristic way
[42:33] that he had
[42:34] changed his strategy
[42:37] and now begins to continues his war
[42:42] but now it goes from natural into a
[42:44] spiritual war
[42:46] against the saints of the most high god
[42:49] in the religious realm satan
[42:54] operating now in the religious realms
[42:58] with enticing spirits with doctrines of
[43:02] demons amen seducing spirits
[43:07] and the works of the devil here we are
[43:10] brother sister
[43:11] this is the day and this is the time
[43:15] when that beast that was
[43:18] wounded amen is raising its head again
[43:23] she lost her power from the invasion of
[43:26] the barbarians
[43:28] but now that was only temporal power
[43:31] but now she has regained her power
[43:35] in a different form under
[43:38] the pontificate under my friends
[43:41] in this day and in this hour
[43:45] amen yes sir a national
[43:48] a natural nation rising to power
[43:51] by crushing all the other nations round
[43:53] about it
[43:54] don't you see the spiritual significance
[43:57] you can look ahead in prophecy and you
[43:59] can clearly see it
[44:00] speaking of the religious
[44:03] uh aspects of rome how
[44:07] that will use the same strategy of
[44:09] divide and conquer
[44:11] and also destroy all the other
[44:15] nations denominations
[44:19] churches whatever oh that's against her
[44:22] and
[44:22] bring them to heal amen conquer
[44:25] every one of them like that
[44:28] because she'll develop one of the
[44:32] strongest
[44:33] and most powerful empire
[44:36] that there ever was seems like i sung as
[44:40] if i'm praising rome
[44:41] but i'm not i'm telling you what's in
[44:44] the bible that's supposed to happen
[44:46] that they're going to grow in power
[44:50] and they will have so much power ruling
[44:52] the commerce
[44:54] ruling over kings ruling over emperors
[44:56] ruling over
[44:57] countries nations and they will have
[45:01] supreme power in this
[45:04] present world because in this time
[45:08] the papal rome has already
[45:11] infiltrated the whole world
[45:16] and her power is getting to the place
[45:19] where it's soon it will become absolute
[45:23] oh the triple crowns the keys
[45:27] of dead hell and the grave signified
[45:31] a being used and abused
[45:34] and we see it friends the power is
[45:38] rising all around us everywhere
[45:41] and her uses of kings merchants and
[45:44] and and her deadly religious arsenal
[45:48] and her financial strength all coming
[45:51] together
[45:53] as great force and power
[45:56] and governing the entire earth like a
[45:59] goddess
[46:01] ruling on the face of this earth in this
[46:04] present
[46:04] age and the dragon is there
[46:08] behind her oh praise god hallelujah
[46:12] amen look at the book of daniel
[46:16] we find danielle the last part of the
[46:19] image
[46:20] that daniel saw was an image whose
[46:24] feet and toes went into iron
[46:28] and clay meaning that the roman empire
[46:32] would no longer be solid it would no
[46:35] longer be an
[46:36] iron empire but one mixed with humanism
[46:40] mixed with all manner of other things
[46:43] and there she begins with the running of
[46:46] world affairs
[46:48] in all the nations democratic despotic
[46:52] and otherwise because god is allowing
[46:55] mankind to use
[46:57] every form of human government
[47:00] and everyone will fail
[47:04] and fall to pieces until the
[47:07] prince of peace jesus christ comes again
[47:11] there will be no peace except when he
[47:15] the prince of peace comes
[47:17] and brings peace once more to the earth
[47:20] again
[47:21] the roman church churches in every
[47:24] nation
[47:25] and everything is all mixed up at this
[47:28] particular
[47:29] time again i may ask the question who is
[47:32] able to make war with the beast
[47:35] who is able to a war against them
[47:38] amen look in the bible look in the word
[47:42] of god
[47:43] there's some mighty nations right now
[47:46] but my friends rome is calling is
[47:49] actually
[47:51] she she's the one that's calling the
[47:53] tune
[47:54] she's telling them where to turn what to
[47:57] do
[47:58] she calls all the shots but right now
[48:01] she's standing behind the scenes
[48:04] not to cause any ripples or too much of
[48:08] trouble she's not ready to publicly
[48:12] uh reveal herself that she is the move
[48:16] of the shaker
[48:17] that she is the taker she's the one
[48:19] behind it all
[48:21] and the pope today and every day
[48:24] sits in the driver's seat oh my praise
[48:28] god
[48:29] look my friends his power i want to let
[48:32] you know
[48:34] the power of the pope will increase
[48:39] lots of people think it's going to go
[48:41] down but now
[48:42] doesn't make any difference one pope
[48:44] dies another one arises
[48:46] one pope dies another one arises and the
[48:49] power of the popes
[48:51] will increase that office will grow
[48:54] in power and in influence in every
[48:58] possible way verse six
[49:02] and he opened this mountain blasphemy
[49:05] amen why is it blasphemy because he's
[49:08] teaching for
[49:09] doctrines the commandments the litanies
[49:13] to
[49:14] all my friends the tenants of faith the
[49:17] various things of
[49:18] man not by god
[49:22] as timothy says they've become heady
[49:26] arrogant high-minded lovers of pleasures
[49:32] more than lovers of god
[49:35] having outward forms of godliness
[49:39] but spiritually denying the genuine
[49:43] powers of god
[49:45] amen blaspheming the name of god
[49:49] changing his name and turning it into
[49:52] titles
[49:53] and getting the people to believe in the
[49:55] titles
[49:56] rather than in the direct name of the
[49:59] person
[50:00] who owns those titles amen
[50:04] and they refuse through the years to
[50:07] repent
[50:08] and to do it and it was given unto him
[50:11] says verse 7
[50:13] to make war with the saints persecution
[50:17] is coming it may
[50:20] not be it may start right before the
[50:24] rapture
[50:25] we may see little uh
[50:28] elements of its shadows of it but
[50:31] persecution will
[50:33] ripen and break out upon the saints of
[50:36] god
[50:37] during the tribulation time
[50:40] death to the true believer and
[50:44] all that follow the lord in that order
[50:47] is how they are going to progress amen
[50:51] oh praise god even my friends
[50:54] we find no matter where you go that is
[50:57] what they will do verse 8
[50:59] and all that dwell upon the earth whose
[51:01] names were
[51:02] not written in the book of life of the
[51:05] lamb slain
[51:07] from the foundation of the world shall
[51:10] worship him god is saying
[51:14] he will be successful
[51:17] in his ambition of ruling
[51:21] the earth because
[51:24] all those whose names
[51:28] were not in the original election of god
[51:31] in the mind of god
[51:32] in the book of life in christ the logos
[51:35] the word
[51:36] all whose names were not written on that
[51:39] page white and fair
[51:42] will be deceived
[51:46] they will be fooled there will be
[51:49] seduced
[51:51] and carried away into babylon
[51:54] carried away into captivity
[51:58] amen but the elect will not be deceived
[52:03] they will not for their hear the
[52:05] shepherd's voice
[52:07] hallelujah and they follow him
[52:10] and him alone do they follow
[52:14] the word of god what have i been
[52:17] what have we been trying to show you
[52:18] here today
[52:21] that the seed of death which started
[52:23] from the garden
[52:25] naturally has started spiritually
[52:29] coming down out of babylon
[52:32] into nicaea with constantine into the
[52:35] realm
[52:36] of the romish uh pagan
[52:40] religion later at church
[52:43] and later now transformed itself into an
[52:47] angel of light
[52:48] into a christian church amen
[52:52] paganism has effectively
[52:56] invaded christianity and now
[52:59] operating in the christian
[53:02] ranks yes sir and so now
[53:05] we find that seed of death
[53:09] which started off as a seed
[53:12] as jesus spoke has now become a great
[53:15] tree
[53:16] in whose branches roosts all manner of
[53:20] unclean spirits
[53:22] all manner of wicked birds
[53:25] looking and sitting in the branches
[53:28] lodging there
[53:30] and in spite of her claims
[53:33] that she is the giver of life and she
[53:36] holds the keys
[53:38] to salvation inherit the fruits of
[53:42] death eat and die my friends
[53:45] but come to christ the bread of life and
[53:48] eat and drink and
[53:50] live forever more in him is life
[53:53] for we serve the living god amen
[53:56] over there you have the god of death the
[53:59] god of this evil age
[54:00] but we serve the true and the living god
[54:03] jesus
[54:04] christ hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the
[54:07] same
[54:07] yesterday today and forever
[54:11] amen amen yes sir that
[54:14] mighty world church systems
[54:20] that fools the whole world that she
[54:24] is the way to salvation and in her
[54:27] doors is physical and spiritual
[54:31] salvation deceiving and destroying
[54:36] multitudes amen
[54:39] oh my friends but i want to tell you she
[54:42] is the personification of the spirit of
[54:45] death
[54:46] that walks and moves upon the face of
[54:49] the earth
[54:50] and that carrion of death
[54:53] by her religious lies
[54:56] amen the bible tells us will be put to
[55:00] death
[55:00] by death in other words she'll be put to
[55:03] death
[55:04] by the very dealings of organization
[55:07] that she deals with
[55:08] it's like a a dope dealer dying by the
[55:11] very
[55:11] dope that he's peddling the very lies he
[55:14] peddles
[55:15] destroys him and kills him
[55:18] defeats him and brings him to death
[55:22] and she will experience it all into the
[55:25] in the lake of fire
[55:28] amen all my friends men could not
[55:31] perceive that
[55:33] but there she is bride of satan
[55:37] or to bring it in a way that your
[55:40] natural
[55:40] mind will understand she is like a
[55:42] patchwork of denominations
[55:44] bride of frankenstein will be placed
[55:47] into
[55:48] the lake of fire but
[55:51] thanks be to god god has his own
[55:55] and she will they will come to an end
[55:58] but to those who are
[55:59] god's children and god's true elect
[56:02] though you may be in her midst god has
[56:06] said
[56:06] come out of her my people and
[56:10] be not partakers of her evil deeds
