TRANSCRIPT
========================================
together with the world and so I preached that back there and my God confusion tell me I'm trying to tell him not born again and all this Stu like that thrown out almost beaten up by another one there in Detroit my Lord wouldn't even see me out the door but praise God I'm still here today by the grace of God and I see most of them have come around in a big circle and beginning to understand um that amen praise the Lord so that's the way it is praise God hallelujah amen now he says now we know in this last days many of these churches and people they believe in a carnal way they believe you can't tell them they don't believe they're doing Bible studies they're reading the Bible they can even put up graphics and graphs and everything else better than you can is that right and they do that he says but you see what is that they are in the last days they're going to impersonate the real spirit this is what he say they're going to impersonate the real script the spirit they'll pick up a certain scripture and that that man will make take that scripture and make it live new make it live exactly what it promised here in the Bible another man will see him do that and he'll come around and try to do it and it won't be the same I hope you're reading between the lines Why one has the scripture and the spirit with him but the other one the scripture is not inspired by the spirit to amen they got the same qu same Bible same book but one saying the same thing the other one saying the same thing but it's inspired to one and not inspired to the other one we don't want to go back to Canan and come up the Book of Genesis of the rainb back again but you can follow that yourself in your own mind one's uh one's one's gift one's offering is accepted and the other one is not it's as simple as that he says what is it you see he's trying to act that way you can even do the same thing Jesus said it it's just like jer's and jam with stood Moses it's the same thing it's happening again today see they believe but they believe in a carnal way amen and that spirit in these last days will go to impersonate the real spirit and that's where your real trouble is coming from right that's what I'm talking about the message settled down now the prophets of God everybody got the books we all got to take and everybody say oh we all the same yeah Ally yeah we all the same but yes sir you got the word but it's not word insired or revealed the way should be revealed he amen hallelujah he says people come up to me and say I got the Holy Ghost too but look at the way they live the way they live don't last from even one Revival to another doesn't even last from the one meeting to another it's all made manifest the haveen God for man's born of the spirit of God and I'm winding up now or a woman they have the fruits of the spirit amen they walk Godly yes and they live that life amen uh I'm going to add a little piece here it's not here in that quote but he says a sheep doesn't have to work up itself to Bear wo so if it's a genuine sheep it automatically Bears amen is that right me I don't have a piece of here because I don't look I'm not looking too much like a sheep right so you going to add on a piece you going to try to work harder to be a Christian no he says just in the word live amen is that right amen one BL he say I don't how a black cow eat green grass and produce white milk is that right all the to do is in the grass I don't have to explain it I don't have to know how God do all that stuff like that I don't need to know the mystery of we don't have to know the mystery of this and the Mystery of that no all you got to do is feed on revealed word of God Amen and it will work out your salvation it will work in you praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen I go to I I almost started preaching there I'm teaching but I almost start preaching talking about the word we'll work it out because we'll start to purge and all kinds of other stuff start coming to me there that we can just preach a nice little message in there praise the Lord let me wind this up here see they keep keep away from the things of the world not because the Bible tells you separate yourself from unbelief and so you a sister or a brother that you heard did did something you're sitting in the que and they sit beside you and you start to slightly leave this way for what you going to catch something is there some virus going around like that that you going to catch no praise the Lord Jesus didn't think something wrong to go sit by the well and wait so that he could speak the word into her soul she he knew that she was a part of him that need to be revealed and to recognize who she really was she was under delusion of the devil thinking that she was supposed to be living the life she was reveal no that's not your real life this is your real life amen praise the Lord hallelujah back there I mean David drank from The Well of Bethlehem and he say you think you're drinking from Jacob's Well that's not not the well need to be drinken from that well is only natural thirst for a little while come back to the again you drink from this well never again praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen see they keep away from the things of the world it's God moving in them God moves in them and makes himself manifest and proves that he is God working in there and the other one is really impersonating Christianity impersonating the message in the message impersonating the message it's not this wicked people and they go out there deliberately to go do it but they're trying to do the same thing the genuine believer is doing without the gine holy spirit amen is that right you Beat It Down by music you can't bring it up by Bible study it has to be real and gine and then speaks for itself is that right praise the Lord for it's God moving in them and making themselves manifest that's how you going to overcome because it's not you other plac he said they think many times they're going to speak evil against you he said but they think it's you they're speaking evil against it's not you amen he that is in you because they don't understand your action why because we are not of this world Amen and we are not acting like the people of this world and when you don't act like the people of this world and you don't get into their system and their way the world system is selfishness and you're not selfish am the world system is Revenge and you don't have anything like that to do and many of these other things and they can see the difference and they want to know why in the world you're not Jing fighting claing cursing swearing caring on uh misbehaving participating with everything they're doing you know you're a devil on a on a on a Friday night and a Saturday night and a saint on a Sunday morning they find out that no this guy is a Christian every single day is that right that's right but he just ordinary guy he not going like one of these really super spiritual super natural on you know like that he's just regular gu like me praise God amen hallelujah amen oh you guys are drinking give me an orange juice That's Right Said brother compromising what was Jesus doing s those guys that were drinking the wine why didn't think they call him a wine B cuz he was sitting there while they drinking wine and then he gives them out talk to them but I had to tell one brother I said the reason why you upset is because you're not confident in your Christianity you think that the smell of the wi will draw you back right and and that's why you don't even want not that they going to want to walk into a situation like that but I'm saying if you're found in that situation don't go acting like you Scorn the people and this going on and your relative drinking not the drun and all that's the old message to go amen you just grab your juice and drink your juice and enjoy your juice and talk to them amen and the walls are going to fall that's right amen and you going to have a better opportunity glory to share what is in your heart amen praise the Lord amen I hope you're blessed amen the Lord bless you tonight praise the Lord let's all stand word of pra the Le k for the spirit his life I can say whatever I want unless the Holy Spirit comes to give life to what I'm telling you what I am saying will kill you is that right but if the spirit is here and he anoints the word anoints the most holy then that word will come to life in you praise God the let K but the spirit gives it life think about it throw this in you can think about the rest of the week the same thought is what he tried to share many many ways in the message when he talks about the gasoline and the spark from the from the spark CL you can have all the gas you want the letter kills but the spirit gives it life Spirit has to come to Quicken the word for the hour glory to God hallelujah our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for these that are here tonight I fully understand their sacrifice and the courage it takes to come and be in the presence of God we and tired in their physical body sometimes we in their mind sometimes their backed into a corner by the devil and yet they realize that being in the house of God is the source of their strength Hall and the place for them to have spiritual recovery so I praise them Father and I admire them for their strength and their courage and for their perseverance and for their desperation [Music] help us and strengthen us everyone for the greatest temptation is what to forsake the assembling to together as the manner of sist more that we see the day approaching draw us closer to you father and as we read the Bible and go back and reread the messages and listen to the text again we ask that you inspire the word with our hearts and our ears like we've never heard it before let's behold wonderful and beautiful things coming out of the world and you take the glory in Jesus name amen and amen over you
