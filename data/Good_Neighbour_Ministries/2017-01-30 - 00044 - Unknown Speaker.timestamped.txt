[0:06] he's changing
[0:08] me are they just words that we're
[0:11] singing or are they
[0:15] reality
[0:16] reality
[0:18] because faith is declaring unto
[0:22] you that there's a change taking place
[0:26] how can you know that you're being
[0:30] change unless faith is being revealed to
[0:33] you from Glory unto Glory do it Lord
[0:38] amen it's a
[0:39] good to be here today amen amen I uh
[0:46] it's always
[0:48] uh I don't know for me to stand here is
[0:51] is something that I've always ran away
[0:53] from but to stand here is the greatest
[0:55] honor and the greatest privilege that
[0:57] any man could have amen
[1:00] [Applause]
[1:04] God would chose me I don't know I really
[1:06] don't know but I just want to do what he
[1:09] wants to do in my life and fulfill what
[1:12] he has to fulfill in my life what else
[1:14] what else can we do that's not only for
[1:17] me that's for each and every one of us
[1:19] right so if we just get ourselves and
[1:23] our own thoughts out of the way and our
[1:26] plans for our lives and let God do what
[1:28] he wants to do in our lives regardless
[1:31] of our own thoughts because it's our
[1:32] greatest enemy is our own thoughts our
[1:35] own selves because we always put
[1:36] ourselves down we're always calling you
[1:40] know you know taking ourselves as
[1:44] unworthy but we we got to watch that we
[1:47] don't take that too far because we do
[1:49] make mistakes and we do fall down but
[1:52] remember who called you amen the great
[1:56] king of glory and does he make a mistake
[1:59] no abut so I don't think he made a
[2:02] mistake in calling me this morning to
[2:04] minister the word and for you to be here
[2:06] and for you to receive the word right I
[2:10] have nothing that I can give you but my
[2:12] own experiences but I know there's one
[2:15] here if we can break into the
[2:19] supernatural right there's one here that
[2:22] can speak to your heart that can release
[2:25] Faith to you that can produce a change
[2:27] in you that's why we come to church for
[2:31] right it's to meet with him May that
[2:34] become a reality to me and to you more
[2:38] today amen I believe this message with
[2:41] all my heart am amen I believe it with
[2:45] all my heart and I want to live it with
[2:48] all my life but I know that's going to
[2:50] take a sacrifice I know that's going to
[2:52] take a dying out I know that's going to
[2:54] take for me to surrender my life and
[2:56] it's no less for any one of us we ain't
[2:58] going to come any other way
[3:00] than any other one that came through the
[3:03] path we have to follow those bloody
[3:06] Footprints right up to glory amen each
[3:09] and every one of us have to die to our
[3:11] own selves I I I I can be here
[3:15] encouraging you encouraging me but you
[3:17] have to take the word am and you have to
[3:20] apply the word and you have to go
[3:23] through the pain that it takes to die
[3:26] out but I believe that there's a bride
[3:28] and as we speak this
[3:30] morning I Was preparing another
[3:34] message this week I got hit really heavy
[3:37] with
[3:38] a I just got hit with the devil I'm not
[3:40] going to say what it was I got hit with
[3:42] the devil I was gone for a few days and
[3:45] and I was I was lying there Thursday
[3:46] morning still not feeling
[3:48] 100% I had a thought in my mind and as I
[3:52] was in in between sleep and awake he
[3:57] does that to me sometimes
[4:00] and he
[4:02] speaks and he gave me this
[4:05] title and I believe it's not only for me
[4:08] but it's for
[4:10] you that we should earnestly
[4:13] contend for the perfect
[4:15] faith that I once delivered to my
[4:19] bride amen amen let's see what the Lord
[4:23] will do this morning Amen Let Us stand
[4:25] and go
[4:27] to Jude 1
[4:44] we'll read

[5:37] and exort you that ye should earnestly
[5:42] contend for the faith which was once
[5:45] delivered unto the
[5:48] Saints for there are certain men creeped
[5:52] in
[5:52] unaware who were before of old ordained
[5:55] to this
[5:57] condemnation ungodly men
[6:00] turning the grace of our God
[6:03] into that's amen and denying the only

[7:11] unbelief break every Spirit of
[7:15] Doubt break and bind the spirit of
[7:19] fear

[7:28] Liberty
[7:30] because of Calvary because of what You'
[7:34] sacrificed because of the word that's
[7:36] been released in this last day it's been
[7:40] crucified and has been
[7:44] resurrected have the preets in our midst
[7:47] father in Jesus name you may be
[7:54] seated I really don't know where I'm
[7:56] going to
[7:57] go this morning
[8:00] just going to probably preach a lot of
[8:02] things preaching is just saying things
[8:04] over and over and over again I'm going
[8:06] to read a lot of
[8:08] quotes is I I feel that the things that
[8:11] I want to say and the way I want to say
[8:12] it in some ways nobody says it better
[8:15] than the prophet amen right I can say it
[8:18] in my own words and that's true in some
[8:19] things I do but I just feel to do that
[8:23] this morning bring
[8:26] back you know when the Bible says in the
[8:28] Book of Revelation when you lost your
[8:30] first love go back to your first wordss
[8:33] and we cannot change that this is the
[8:36] this is
[8:37] not and we have expressed it and you
[8:40] know you have to say this by faith you
[8:42] have to say this with total
[8:44] understanding that it's not brother
[8:45] bram's day we understand that but the
[8:48] word that he brought he was a prophet
[8:50] and the word comes to the prophet that
[8:52] word is
[8:53] eternal that word is here today and it's
[8:56] real and it's written that we all could
[9:00] feed off of in the message we call the
[9:02] message of the hour and that word will
[9:05] never be out of date it will never be a
[9:08] past age he's the same yesterday today
[9:12] and forever amen amen so don't let the
[9:15] devil deceive you because this is the
[9:18] pale horse rider this is the most decept
[9:21] age that we live in is this age that we
[9:24] live in amen and you need this word that
[9:28] is sharper than the two head sword
[9:30] sometimes to cut through the unbelief
[9:33] the deceptionist out there that we are
[9:37] subject to the atmospheres in our minds
[9:39] and our Spirits out there we need this
[9:42] word to cut through it sometimes in our
[9:44] own lives amen and break the
[9:47] deceptionist sometimes we I get deceived
[9:50] for a period of time and I need the word
[9:52] to be spoken in a certain way and that's
[9:55] what he's saying here these people have
[9:57] creeped in and and and speak speak in
[9:59] the word of God and not speaking it the
[10:01] way it should be spoken do I know how to
[10:04] speak it the way it should be spoken no
[10:06] but he knows how to speak it I just got
[10:08] to yield my vessel to him and let him
[10:11] speak it the way he wants to because we
[10:14] need it we not staying here this this
[10:18] world is becoming less and less to me
[10:21] amen amen the other side is more real to
[10:24] me and every year is becoming more real
[10:26] to me I don't want to stay here I don't
[10:28] know about you you but I don't know what
[10:30] you see when you look out in the
[10:33] world but I know what I see I see
[10:36] prophecies being fulfilled and all I
[10:39] know what's up ahead is a Rapture is got
[10:41] to take place a body change is got to
[10:44] come my life has got to be ready for
[10:47] that Rapture and I all I have to do is
[10:50] yield my vessel to him I know it sounds
[10:53] easy but yielding your life to Jesus
[10:56] Christ is not easy true true it's not
[10:59] easy to give everything over to him the
[11:03] fears and the doubts and and the things
[11:06] that we struggle with in our flesh is
[11:09] not
[11:10] easy but God gives a faith a perfect
[11:15] Faith to us right that causes us to
[11:18] raise above our trials and our
[11:21] circumstances in our lives and the
[11:24] things he gives us a faith to raise
[11:27] above it amen
[11:29] thank you Lord and press on press on to
[11:33] what press on to the resurrection press
[11:36] on to see that word Jesus Christ live in
[11:39] me that's been my my my Revelation my
[11:44] experience right from the beginning is
[11:46] oh God more of you and less of me live
[11:50] in me he saved me he saved you but what
[11:54] does he want to do now let him live let
[11:57] him have the preeminence let him
[11:59] incarnate let him do what he wants to
[12:02] do get ourselves out of the
[12:06] way earnestly contend earnestly
[12:11] sincerely contend for the Faith with
[12:14] intense
[12:17] conviction over danger
[12:21] difficulties something as a position and
[12:24] Ur urement maintaining holding claiming
[12:29] a state
[12:31] declaring professing something earnestly
[12:35] content for that
[12:37] faith I'm talking to those this morning
[12:41] that have faith and if you don't have
[12:44] faith I'm praying that God will give you
[12:46] Faith amen because that's the people
[12:50] that have faith know what it is and
[12:53] that's who the Lord is speaking to to
[12:56] his bride in this last day yes and I
[12:59] believe that we're all right but I'm not
[13:02] God Amen I'm not the judge of that he
[13:05] knows his own I know my own he say so
[13:08] I'm just speaking the word but the word
[13:11] needs to be spoken and God will take
[13:13] care of his own I can't be scared I got
[13:16] to speak it as it is I can't be scared
[13:19] because God knows his own he'll take
[13:20] care of his own and if you're of his own
[13:23] he will reveal to you he'll make plain
[13:25] and known who you are that's right and
[13:26] what is the greatest Revelation Brothers
[13:29] and sisters that that we see it's not
[13:32] about the Mysteries it's not about you
[13:34] know all the ways that man can preach
[13:36] the word of
[13:37] God and make it more
[13:40] mysterious it's about knowing who you
[13:43] are that's the greatest Revelation that
[13:46] God can give you is who you are because
[13:50] if you don't know who you are this
[13:52] morning you're wavering you're up you're
[13:55] down you're all over the place you don't
[13:57] have no position you don't know where
[13:59] understanding you don't know where your
[14:01] place is in the body of Jesus Christ it
[14:03] doesn't matter how simple it is how
[14:06] simple it is so we need to know who we
[14:09] are that's what God delivers of
[14:13] Faith
[14:17] amen so
[14:19] earnestly my bride content for the faith
[14:23] that I once deliver to you
[14:26] amen there is a perfect faith that was
[14:29] once delivered to the
[14:33] bride you go to the second
[14:37] slide I just got a few inspirational
[14:40] slides I just put it together at the
[14:41] last
[14:43] minute this perfect faith is worth
[14:46] contending for this what we want to talk
[14:49] about this perfect faith is repeatedly
[14:53] threatened from within the church I'm
[14:56] talking about in the message well
[14:58] there's AIG big threat going on it's
[15:01] being threatened all the time because
[15:02] there's an original life there's an
[15:04] original
[15:06] seed
[15:08] amen and without the eyes of discernment
[15:11] and Revelation you won't be able to see
[15:14] this
[15:15] threat but there's preaching going on as
[15:18] we read in
[15:21] uh in our scripture opening that word
[15:25] means there are men preaching the gospel
[15:28] that are Poss M with sexual
[15:30] immortality sexual
[15:33] thoughts running through their mind
[15:36] uncleanness running through their lives
[15:40] that's why I take every position for Me
[15:42] Myself and no matter what position that
[15:44] you have in Christ you take it seriously
[15:47] amen amen when you're dealing with the
[15:50] word of God you're deal I'm not just
[15:52] dealing and standing here because I'm
[15:54] just going to be preaching and I I want
[15:56] to make myself look good I'm not here
[15:58] for that
[15:59] this is a sacred place and not only
[16:02] this this is a sacred place your walk
[16:06] your position in Christ your profession
[16:09] of a of Christianity and believing in
[16:12] this message of the hour is is something
[16:15] that is more greater than you think amen
[16:18] it's Jesus Christ that you're
[16:21] professing and he said don't bear false
[16:23] witness against me amen
[16:29] you might I might not see if you're
[16:31] living a clean life but God sees
[16:34] it God sees if you're
[16:37] sincere he sees the struggles that you
[16:39] have but he sees the faith that that he
[16:42] placed beside you that press through
[16:45] amen but God help you if you're playing
[16:47] with this word God help me yes the
[16:51] things that we're here week after week
[16:54] from the flyf
[16:57] ministry it could be the greatest
[16:59] blessing and eternal life or could be
[17:04] damnation that's the
[17:09] word every genuine believer should
[17:12] contend for the perfect Faith what is it
[17:15] it's the token that has been made
[17:18] available to us in this last day the
[17:25] token the church has always been the the
[17:29] called out the Born
[17:30] Again whether they're methodists
[17:33] Baptists Presbyterians whatever they are
[17:37] and it's the called out of God and the
[17:40] word of God is in for instruction
[17:42] reproof that a man might stand before
[17:45] God blameless if we follow the blueprint
[17:49] well we'll stand blameless the book of
[17:52] Jude as it is written in the year
[17:56] a66 33 years after
[17:59] Pentecost now I want you to notice in
[18:02] Jude who he's
[18:05] addressing he's addressing
[18:08] Christians he's not speaking to
[18:11] unbelievers in the church or make
[18:14] Believers he's talking directly to
[18:18] Christians now notice Jude the servant
[18:20] of Jesus Christ the brother of James to
[18:23] them that are Sanctified not to them
[18:25] that are of the
[18:27] world them that are
[18:30] Sanctified of God and
[18:33] preserved in Jesus Christ we're not only
[18:37] Sanctified we're
[18:39] preserved glory to God and we're
[18:44] called now you're the people that I'm
[18:48] talking to that you earnestly contend
[18:51] for the faith that was once delivered to
[18:54] the
[18:55] Saints not just a faith that was once
[18:59] delivered but the faith that was once
[19:03] delivered now the churches today they go
[19:07] back and I've heard and I've listened to
[19:09] a few sermons on this that are out there
[19:13] and they go back and they look at the
[19:16] Bible they look at Paul they look at
[19:18] Jude back there and see that you know
[19:23] this is what we got to contend for but
[19:26] what they don't realize and that we
[19:28] realize amen is that the word was lost
[19:32] it went through the Dark Ages and it was
[19:35] lost okay the written word actually the
[19:38] written word was lost for a period of
[19:40] time in the Catholic church we know that
[19:43] but that wasn't what was really lost it
[19:46] was the understanding it was the
[19:49] interpretation it was the revelation of
[19:51] the word that was
[19:53] lost okay now now you see God come back
[19:59] and and Luther came with a revelation
[20:01] that just shall live by faith now that
[20:04] word that we're supposed to be
[20:05] contending for was starting to be
[20:07] revealed again and then we know Wesley
[20:11] sanctification all the Revelation and
[20:13] then we know Pentecost came back but
[20:16] they're still looking back there and
[20:18] what are they seeing they're seeing
[20:21] nothing they don't know what they're
[20:23] contending for they don't know what
[20:25] faith that they have
[20:28] I know you said well brother they they
[20:30] believe the written word but no no you
[20:33] can't believe the word unless the word
[20:36] has been revealed to you amen you can't
[20:40] tell me you know the person when you
[20:41] have not met
[20:43] himen amen but they're saying that they
[20:45] know him they say that they're in the
[20:48] faith they say that they're they're
[20:49] they're staying right with the word
[20:52] they're staying right with the letter
[20:53] but look what what the Pharisees and
[20:55] Sadducees did when they stay with the
[20:56] letter what did they do they cruci ified
[20:59] the Lord Of
[21:00] Glory and that's the same thing that
[21:03] they're doing
[21:04] today so when when when when James is
[21:07] talking to us when the Bible's talking
[21:09] to us what we're speaking this morning
[21:12] amen We're Not Looking Back to the days
[21:14] of paulm and that we're looking to today
[21:18] because what he had back there was
[21:20] restored in this day it's the same thing
[21:22] that he had back there but was is
[21:24] restored today and outside of the
[21:26] revelation of this message you you don't
[21:28] see what he was preaching back there you
[21:31] only see it
[21:32] here
[21:34] amen
[21:36] hallelujah so the Lord is speaking to us
[21:39] today to contend for the faith oh not
[21:42] just to contend for the Bible but
[21:44] contend for the Revelation that has been
[21:46] revealed through the message of the hour
[21:49] in your life that's what he's saying
[21:51] contend for that's why he's saying press
[21:54] on because I guess the church or the
[21:56] Bride of Jesus Christ is in a position
[21:58] where he needs to push you a little bit
[22:01] through that pipe this morning he needs
[22:03] to push me through that pipe this
[22:05] morning amen and Shake us a little
[22:09] bit
[22:11] Hallelujah don't think it's easy to
[22:14] stand up here and preach like this
[22:15] because I got to go through it I got to
[22:17] go through it before I can preach it and
[22:20] it's not easy
[22:22] sometimes it's not easy just you know
[22:25] come up here and brag and when when the
[22:27] when the chasing of the Lord Lord and
[22:28] the trials of the Lord and things that
[22:30] you go through
[22:32] amen but you take it thank you you take
[22:35] the word of God the sacrifices that the
[22:38] ministers the fivefold ministry the true
[22:40] ones that are making in their lives to
[22:42] bring forth the word of God are we
[22:43] perfect we're not perfect
[22:47] amen thank
[22:49] youus amen there's only one Faith one
[22:53] Lord one God one baptism one Doctrine I
[22:57] want to make that clear M and now people
[23:00] say we have all the faith and I go to my
[23:03] own church they're saying that we must
[23:07] contend for the faith that Paul spoke
[23:10] but that was lost well that's not what
[23:14] Jude was speaking
[23:16] about he's talking about a different
[23:18] Faith at a different
[23:20] time in this
[23:23] day
[23:26] Hallelujah a word that's been
[23:29] restored a word that come to a prophet
[23:33] of Malachi
[23:35] 4:5
[23:36] amen
[23:40] hallelujah
[23:41] amen the believer's call is to fight for
[23:45] the
[23:46] faith that's the way Jude begins and
[23:48] ends the
[23:50] letter but in the middle of his concern
[23:53] is
[23:54] different it is not to help Believers
[23:56] feel content
[23:58] but to help them feel
[24:01] Vigilant having been showing them the
[24:03] elected love of God and the surpassing
[24:06] power of God to keep them safe now Jude
[24:11] shows them the danger that surrounds
[24:14] them and that's what I want to break
[24:17] into
[24:18] today the danger that surrounds us
[24:22] Amen in this faith that has been
[24:25] delivered to us amen hallelujah
[24:29] there is a danger and it's not the
[24:32] danger not necessarily is not only
[24:33] coming from false teachers but the
[24:36] danger is with inside yourself it's
[24:38] yourself is your greatest battle it's
[24:41] the atmospheres around you it's what you
[24:43] believe and what you take in is what you
[24:46] interpret amen the danger is the flesh
[24:49] the things the things that you struggle
[24:51] with in your life that you know the
[24:53] spirit of God is pressing you through
[24:56] amen calling you to a higher calling
[24:58] a deeper walk with him a deeper
[25:01] consecration where is the consecration
[25:04] today where is it we don't need it
[25:07] anymore we don't need to pray until we
[25:09] break through we don't need to fast at
[25:12] times when struggles and and and Trials
[25:15] come upon our lives and areas that we
[25:17] know that we're not getting
[25:18] breakthroughs in and we just let it go
[25:21] that's a danger we just ignore it we
[25:24] just ignore these battles that Satan is
[25:27] impressing on us and bombarding us
[25:30] sometimes we have the word we have a
[25:33] sword we got the spirit of God all we
[25:36] have to do is apply the word in our
[25:40] lives all we have to do is God PR we
[25:44] make a decision to fast when we make a
[25:47] decision to pray till we break through
[25:49] when we make a decision to get in the
[25:51] spirit and speak the word in our
[25:54] condition then
[25:56] watch you're not given God any
[25:59] opportunity to fulfill and confirm his
[26:02] word in your life when you're not doing
[26:06] that amen that's the
[26:20] danger L see in church
[26:23] age what's the
[26:26] danger Revelation 3 5 15- 16 I know they
[26:31] works that thou are neither cold nor
[26:36] hot Revelations 3:15-16
[26:40] that's who we
[26:43] are it's not just something I'm
[26:48] reading it's
[26:50] here this is
[26:52] here this is this
[26:55] age the atmospheres that you struggle
[26:57] with is this this is the word of God
[27:01] fulfilled right now
[27:04] today and you're going to either be
[27:06] under the spirit of the anointing of the
[27:08] word the faith that was delivered to us
[27:11] or you're going to be under this
[27:12] anointing
[27:14] right I just don't want to read and make
[27:17] it sound like it's just I'm reading
[27:18] something to you this is not just words
[27:21] this is the word of the living this is
[27:24] prophecy this is a spirit of Christ
[27:26] which is a spirit of Prophecy amen you
[27:29] want to know what life is all about this
[27:31] is what life is all about you want to
[27:33] know where your struggles are this is
[27:34] where your struggles are you want to
[27:36] know how to get Victory this is where
[27:38] you get Victory amen it's all in here
[27:41] everything that you need to know neither
[27:44] cold nor
[27:46] hot I would that thou were cold or hot
[27:50] but because thou are luk warm neither
[27:53] cold or hot I will screw thee out of my
[27:56] mouth
[28:03] Luke God help
[28:05] me you can say to yourself God help you
[28:08] but I'm saying God help
[28:14] me we're going to go and look at this
[28:17] very carefully and what he's
[28:20] saying Le see in church age the group is
[28:24] luk
[28:25] Wen it's Luke Wen it's not going to be
[28:29] it's
[28:31] lukew you understand what I'm saying
[28:33] it's
[28:34] lukew now whether you're lukewarm or not
[28:39] that's between you and God and your
[28:40] experience with the Lord but if you
[28:43] are I pray that Faith would come to you
[28:46] to break out of that
[28:48] lukew because he doesn't have good
[28:50] things to say about
[28:52] it
[28:56] amen this luk is the man's a penalty
[29:00] from God now these messages as the leoan
[29:03] church age the token and perfect faith
[29:05] if you want to go back and read those
[29:07] messages it'll be a blessing to
[29:11] you the penalty is that they will be
[29:14] spewed out of his
[29:16] mouth here is where we don't want to go
[29:21] astray as a lot of folks
[29:24] do they verely unwisely say that God
[29:29] you out of his mouth and that proves
[29:32] that there is no such thing as any truth
[29:37] to the doctrine of perseverance of the
[29:41] Saints I want to correct your thinking
[29:44] right
[29:45] now this verse is not given to an
[29:49] individual it's given to the church the
[29:53] message as whole not the individual the
[29:55] bride that's why I'm trying to
[29:57] difference here this this morning he is
[29:59] talking to the
[30:02] church furthermore if you will just keep
[30:06] the word in mind you will recall that
[30:10] nowhere does it say that we are in the
[30:13] mouth of
[30:15] God we are
[30:17] engraved on his palms we are carried in
[30:21] his
[30:23] bosom way back in the unknown ages
[30:27] Before Time
[30:28] we were in his mind is that the truth is
[30:32] that the revelation of the message for
[30:34] the bride is that what we believe
[30:37] amen we are the Sheepfold of his
[30:40] pastures but never in his mouth but what
[30:44] is in his
[30:45] mouth the word is in his mouth Matthew
[30:50] 4:4 but he answered and said it is
[30:52] written man shall not live by bread
[30:55] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[30:58] out of the mouth of
[31:00] God the word is supposed to be in our
[31:05] mouths amen we're not in his mouth but
[31:08] the word is supposed to be in our mouths
[31:11] and in order for the word to be in our
[31:14] mouths the word must be in
[31:17] us the Revelation must be in us the
[31:21] truth must be in US
[31:23] am amen
[31:29] now we know that the church is his
[31:33] body it is here taking
[31:36] place what will we what will be in the
[31:40] church in the mouth of the
[31:41] church you see first Peter 4:11 If any
[31:45] man speak let him speak by the ordinance
[31:47] of the word of God 2 Peter 1:22 for
[31:52] prophecy came not in Old Time by the
[31:54] will of man but holy man of God spake as
[31:59] they were moved by the Holy Ghost then
[32:02] what went wrong with these people in the
[32:05] last
[32:06] days they have gotten away from the
[32:11] word now he's talking
[32:15] here because he came to the seven Church
[32:20] age messenger came as the angel to the
[32:22] whole age so he's talking to the whole
[32:25] age but so many times we don't catch the
[32:28] revelation of modern or or or or time
[32:33] that we live in
[32:35] now right we have to place the word
[32:39] today where is God now God is the word
[32:43] where is he now so he's talking back
[32:46] there to the age cuz he had to but as we
[32:49] read it now as a fivefold ministry under
[32:52] the anointing of the Holy Ghost speaks
[32:54] the word of God it speaks different now
[32:58] Amen to our day our age what is the
[33:01] church today the church is the message
[33:04] and there is a bride in the
[33:08] message amen so that you can take this
[33:11] word and apply it to your life and if
[33:14] it's not good you can change it you got
[33:17] time Mercy's on the seat still you have
[33:20] time for repentance and make things
[33:22] right
[33:28] they have gotten away from the word they
[33:30] are no longer fervent about it they are
[33:34] lukewarm about it I am going to prove
[33:38] that right now now he's talking here now
[33:41] the Baptists have their Creeds dogmas
[33:43] based on the word the apostolics they
[33:48] have theirs
[33:49] Miracles based on the
[33:54] word with the Holy Ghost and believe in
[33:57] that
[33:58] the methodists say they're based on the
[34:01] word and there is no water baptism but
[34:03] sprinkling not
[34:05] baptism and
[34:07] sanctification of is the the sprinkling
[34:10] of is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[34:12] that's what they believe is the word the
[34:14] Church of Christ Majors on regeneration
[34:17] baptism and they base it on the word but
[34:20] most of the time they go down dry
[34:22] Sinners and come up wet ones yet they
[34:24] claim the doctrine is word based
[34:28] Go Right Down the Line to
[34:30] Pentecost do they have the word give
[34:33] them the word test and
[34:36] see they will sell out the word for a
[34:40] sensation like I've been in a
[34:42] Pentecostal
[34:44] Revival amen a true Pentecostal Revival
[34:47] down in the states I've seen everything
[34:50] in that that that meeting that you would
[34:52] believe and what he's saying here this
[34:56] is what they're doing and they're still
[34:58] doing
[34:59] today they're selling
[35:01] out the word for
[35:03] sensation just about every time you see
[35:07] them on the TV you see them soon as they
[35:09] get a sensation soon as they get a
[35:10] feeling an emotional or something like
[35:13] that bang and then they get a they get a
[35:16] prophecy or something prophecy comes
[35:17] forth and and bang they sell out for
[35:20] that they don't check and see if the
[35:22] prophecy is
[35:23] [Music]
[35:26] right if they can produce a
[35:28] manifestation like oil or blood or
[35:30] tongues or signs whether in the word or
[35:37] not whether it can be properly
[35:39] interpretated from the word or
[35:43] not the majority will fall for
[35:47] it but what has happened to the
[35:51] word the word has been put
[35:56] aside the don't look at the Pentecostal
[35:59] out
[36:00] there don't look at the Methodist and
[36:02] Baptist out
[36:04] there
[36:06] here look in your own
[36:10] life examine yourself to see if you be
[36:13] in the
[36:13] faith that's what we have to do i'
[36:17] rather tell you the way I can see it I
[36:19] can only tell you the way I see it and
[36:21] the convictions on my heart did not tell
[36:25] you because I want to close my eyes in
[36:28] Death Or I want to be changed in a
[36:31] moment the twink of life
[36:33] knowing that all I want to hear well
[36:36] done good and faithful servant and
[36:38] that's should be the same for
[36:40] you it's not only to minister but the
[36:43] word of God is in your mouth
[36:45] too and you are responsible for that
[36:51] word they put the word
[36:55] aside God says I'm going
[36:58] against you all now I'll spew you out of
[37:00] my mouth this is the end the seventh out
[37:04] of The Seven Ages I have said nothing
[37:07] but men esteem esteeming themselves over
[37:11] my own
[37:14] word so at the end of this age I will
[37:17] spew you out of my mouth it is all over
[37:20] I'm going to speak all right yes I am
[37:24] here in the midst of the church the amen
[37:26] of God faithful and true will reveal
[37:29] himself and will be it will be my
[37:34] Prophet oh yes that is so Revelations
[37:39] 10:7 as he declared in Malachi 46 will
[37:43] turn the hearts of the children back to
[37:45] the
[37:45] fathers I will bring the elect in the
[37:48] last days and they will hear the
[37:49] Vindicated prophet and give exact the
[37:52] exact truth as it was with Paul he will
[37:56] restore the truth as he did and those he
[38:00] left with him in that day will be the
[38:03] ones who truly manifest the Lord and be
[38:07] his body and be his voice and perform
[38:12] his
[38:13] works we are his
[38:17] elect we are his body amen
[38:21] amen we are to produce his Works amen
[38:29] why isn't it
[38:31] happening why isn't it manifest you can
[38:33] ask the own question in your own
[38:36] life why isn't what the Lord said taking
[38:41] place is the danger that surrounds
[38:45] us
[38:49] amen Lord help
[38:52] me in the Dark Ages the word was almost
[38:56] entirely lost to the people but the
[38:59] people took the revelation of God became
[39:02] to Liv in Epistles read of all men for
[39:06] their
[39:09] generation there is again people in the
[39:12] land who are under their message will be
[39:15] the final voice to the final age the
[39:18] church out there is no longer the
[39:20] mouthpiece of
[39:21] God it is his own
[39:24] mouthpiece and God is turning on
[39:31] them for the
[39:35] bride and the spirit in Revelation 17
[39:39] you see it will be the voice of God in
[39:42] her for the spirit and the bride say
[39:47] come
[39:50] amen the spirit and the bride say
[39:53] come I'm trying to bring it
[39:57] and and all that I can Saints I'm in a
[40:00] great battle up here I'm trying to bring
[40:03] it to this day CU Satan don't want you
[40:05] to see it even if it's how simple it can
[40:08] be he don't want you to see the danger
[40:11] because he doesn't Revelation means
[40:14] unveiling uncovering and that's why he
[40:17] hates the Book of Revelation because it
[40:19] uncovers him yes and he's a same devil
[40:23] this morning that hates to be
[40:25] uncovered amen this thing is so simple
[40:30] it's so simple it places right back in
[40:32] your life I don't want you dreaming of
[40:35] of of some fantastic thing in your mind
[40:39] about what's being spoken that it is you
[40:42] the word is speaking to you it's
[40:44] speaking to your experience it's
[40:46] speaking to your condition it's speaking
[40:48] to your
[40:49] life amen thank you Jesus it's speaking
[40:53] all about
[40:55] you because you in the word of become
[40:57] one amen him and his bride are one in
[41:00] the same thank you Jesus there's a
[41:04] danger a
[41:07] Darkness a Satan's eeden an evil
[41:11] presence that is around
[41:14] us that if we don't see and understand
[41:19] and press through this battle in our own
[41:22] lives you don't have my battle I don't
[41:24] have your battle but youve got a battle
[41:26] this morning
[41:27] and you got to take that word you got to
[41:29] take the
[41:31] sword and press through that
[41:35] batt you have the
[41:37] word you have more Bibles than
[41:41] ever but what are you doing with
[41:45] it doing about
[41:49] it they're taking the word dividing it
[41:53] up they're hacking it up into pieces
[41:58] that's what they're doing in this
[42:00] message they're taking the word they
[42:02] taking the Revelation one Minister over
[42:04] here one great Minister over here over
[42:06] here and over here taking the word
[42:09] hacking it up am saying I got it I got
[42:12] it I got it and God never intended that
[42:16] he says I am my own interpreter I will
[42:19] make it
[42:21] plain what he said he said Peter who do
[42:25] you say that that I
[42:28] am who do they say that the son of
[42:31] Adam Peter didn't say well you know well
[42:35] they did say some say this some say that
[42:37] some say that but who do you say that I
[42:39] am I don't care who this brother they
[42:42] they have their work they have their
[42:44] work that's none of my business I don't
[42:46] even want to give a thought in in
[42:48] whether they're right or they're wrong
[42:50] that's none of my business none of our
[42:52] business but who do I say that this is
[42:57] yes that's the
[43:01] question it's a personal revelation to
[43:04] each and every one of us
[43:07] amen people are hacking at the
[43:10] pieces tearing it apart and what is it
[43:13] doing it's confusing the
[43:16] people it's not leading them to Christ
[43:20] brother BR said back there he says I'm
[43:22] afraid that the ministers are not
[43:23] leading the people to
[43:25] Christ I'm I afraid that is happening
[43:28] again in the message today they're not
[43:31] leading the people to Christ to that
[43:34] that that life that is provided for us
[43:37] we look at the prophet as the wave sheet
[43:40] we seen what he went through we seen how
[43:42] God
[43:43] down we see how humble the humility and
[43:48] the things he had to go through we hear
[43:50] his life being spoken on The
[43:53] Taste we see how God dealt with them
[43:56] with situ sitations after
[43:58] situations and he's our way
[44:01] sheet how can God do anything
[44:04] different if you don't see the dealings
[44:07] of the Lord and the holy ghost moving in
[44:09] your life in some way or some
[44:12] shape like you did that you see in the
[44:15] prophet get on your
[44:17] knees get on your
[44:20] knees and I'm not saying that you are
[44:22] the prophet you are you are the seventh
[44:25] age messenger but outside of that office
[44:29] there was a a life amen that he lived
[44:33] there was a personal
[44:35] relationship outside of that office that
[44:38] he
[44:40] had and I see that he stood
[44:44] alone he stood alone in an age he stood
[44:48] around people he stood around church
[44:51] members he stood around friends that
[44:53] were not seeing this life that was was
[44:57] not being dealt with with the Holy Ghost
[44:59] like he was being dealt with the word
[45:03] was not leading them into a life of
[45:05] crucifixion like they were leading him a
[45:08] life of
[45:09] surrender a life of of total
[45:13] submission like they was doing like the
[45:15] Holy Ghost was doing with
[45:18] him and he stood alone you can
[45:22] see by faith you can see what he would
[45:26] stood
[45:27] you can see the battles that he went
[45:30] through the oppositions that he went
[45:33] through you can see I'll even even to a
[45:37] place where where he said to his wife
[45:39] tell them I'm not home and the Holy
[45:41] Spirit say you can't even go pray for
[45:44] that little child unless you go tell him
[45:47] that you
[45:50] lied oh he try to hide and try to go
[45:52] outside but you see the dealings of the
[45:54] Holy
[45:55] Spirit I'm trying to bring something
[45:58] here amen there was a life that the
[46:01] prophet lived and that life was the Holy
[46:06] Ghost and he had to
[46:09] overcome he had to contend for the faith
[46:12] he stood
[46:14] alone amen he stood alone we're not
[46:18] standing
[46:20] alone I don't know how many are here
[46:22] this morning that are contending to
[46:24] Faith but I know that there are some
[46:26] here because I know their experience I
[46:28] know their walk I know the word of God
[46:30] is in their mouth and when they speak I
[46:33] can I can hear the voice of God and I
[46:36] can hear them testifying that they're
[46:38] contending for this
[46:40] Faith this perfect Faith this perfect
[46:43] life this surrendered and consecrated
[46:46] life that was once delivered through a
[46:49] life of the prophets am so more than
[46:53] hacking the word more than understanding
[46:55] the word we need to know him the word
[46:59] himself the life more than what brother
[47:03] can say it doesn't matter what his
[47:05] English it doesn't matter what his
[47:07] education it was his life the life of
[47:10] Christ was on
[47:13] display it's not necessarily the words
[47:15] that were spoken but it was the spirit
[47:18] that was being released out of his life
[47:20] the spirit that you hear on the
[47:23] Tes the voice of God because was in his
[47:27] why was it in his mouth because it was
[47:29] in his life it was in his consecration
