TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so we as a combination as ministers as deacons trustees we can find any any spirit can be that was you can be free so much Cometh Wars and Fighting's among you something not hence even from your own lusts that war in your members he lost and have not the human desire to have and cannot a party he's fighting war if you have not because you ask not some time to disco has opportunity for underprivileged children [Music] because other people [Applause] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and I saw this picture of a grocery bag at Safeway and big chunk of butter on top that's a big grocery bag [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he is interested in our work and what we did whatever he had to do his interest in ISA posterity in Magnus Hebrews 13:8 nori and that's what we need to believe and have any questions I'm going to try to focus here lots of questions we sometimes have more questions than we do and that's roll [Music] sometimes it deceives by you know how is that how's that gonna work or how does that work if you money maybe understood it but getting under student standing in its fullness what a understood it before and that but now that we're living in the fullness of time and then I believe there's a there's a portion for us a double point and then that give us a personal revelation of these things and maybe is yes but it's still an answer and always still an answer if he says yes what he says no lots of questions Amen I I think of a neighbor that's in his eighties and he's a churchgoer he's got these questions about God and he asked me why does God is sovereign God is God you know unless there was something sick then there could be nothing to do we know he he was looking for answers and he said I wrote a letter to God asking why why the lure - August it's his birth and that's so he could be the savior so he can be ideal and here I'm talking with this old boxer and he had a dream that God was creating the university so everything he's not a church-going man he saw God creating everything and God terms company said I want you to work with the work with God with your own spirit first then the property and he's just a blessing all [Music] anyway he said never leave us or forsake us he knows our usual after he'd already saw the duck come down already have that experience and he still is even though my eyes got one film over and that's the way it is today if not careful our eagle eyes that field over with the things of the world with the hardness of the world with the conditions of the world and then looking at the things of the world looking at the internet looking at this looking at that that filmed your eyes over give less sensitive and you can't look to the unseen amen this is we were at the African safari and that was just a wonderful time have the adapter was up there with me enjoyed myself more than that and it's not like that but it's a [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] fieldwork she was and he just around the other birds of prey they fool around all these conditions [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Kennedy we lose it sometimes but it's here for us amen you know there was Paul once I asked the question three times he asked me that the Lord delivereth from his infirmity and a lot of the scholars disagree on that but we know from the Prophet he said it was his eyes his eyes continually weak he said he would have up your eyes for me but he asked him three times in the Lord the answer was the same every time they had sometimes God doesn't even answer and that instrument they answered and Paul you know after he got that answer the third time he said my grace and then I'm glorified in your body calls with this it keeps you humble that's the way we should accept amen and I had a caller that was beautiful that the Prophet says in the eagle stirreth or a mask see said that Sarah Phoenician woman when she was told by Jesus she had a question about her daughter was asking 14 what would you have said if he had called you adult yesterday well you understand I'll join the church but not her she knew who she was when she asked if she knew he was named she never was there so she said she knows he was done she said Lord that's right you're so right in that Lord but even the dog just women do you describe and then clean that she clung she's the ones that are Casper your desk for this morning it's here Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and that was it that's what he was waiting for her to do it was pointed out bullying another couple yourself into such a place men don't matter how sensitive you if you're healed instantly if you're healed by degrees if you're like Abraham plus 25 years waiting for the cross but a step in a weaker he got stronger all the time it embrace the thought well it has now God just just so that you know that God has promised and you accept it for yourself it's into us you know history operations I used to love inspires work but he was like whatever testify amen so it's time we accepted that just accepting for yourself and it's got to come to Tennessee God accomplices matter how he comes disappears one you are to ask my question amen in our text he had a revelation he saw delightfully we saw when we saw the revelation Domanick that he was Hebrews 13:8 and that he'd be a top of the ride for this day what's what you see Elijah saw it you know maybe not they can actually see it looking back that the Prophet said if you can't see Christ in every scripture but you know he was he started we know that people who says that it's the same as they take forever so what he's done for you yeah and the public record is more because there's more of us we have to break but we can do for you he's done more Jesus has done more in this ministry that he did it is all right [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's missing you know if you ever fail [Music] [Music] in the world I can do the same things we are trained doctor Elijah I'm going to profit by David must remember Saul are you drinking he by himself amen shame on people that have spent 45 years in this vessel to walk right say them realize [Applause] one campaign we were registering and the sister I said now we have a program a sister she was from one of the villages and somewhere kidnap TRADOC kidnapped and summer murderer away and hit big marks and she had search parties which the police [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] if you get outside that building and her [Applause] [Music] give me that way this morning and so it's the type of mushroom it's the way we ask God to be a little bit of a mint in this building in them just get caught up how many have ever been carried away [Music] my message this is not this morning and you stepped out but Jesus a to come come just comin to me anywhere and did a lot of that time is right there he is one for himself [Music] I was in the mountains [Music] I was sitting there thinking to Peter you know how he walked across the water like walk on water it was a Nokia was a man like us physically but he didn't even have the Holy Ghost when he walked on water I was thinking on those things you know you're fine the way you work like a laser by the weight of the cares of life you need to find that place you need to find the place that stupid place that boy is that whether it's your ecology or the danger her brother should go up there that's what the property and then he saw God unto the spirits and I was there as just having this mountaintop experience I was thinking about Peter I thought you know we don't I'm just like the type of person that I learned by my experiences by preached by the species I'd like to suggest Louisa I don't want to war about myself that's all they were looking at that water is the mighty tops of our Thompson River mighty river to the rocks that's something said to me well and all things are possible because I didn't mean I got to church the next person next day that the church the pastor was preaching you base comes by hearing hearing by the word support capacity [Music] after gets up he says now if we all hate this subsidies and if we have yeah [Applause] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you said something that's very interesting the Prophet comments on messages but it's what the angel came to do Sakurai's verse 13 of chapter 1 but the angel said unto him if you're not authorized for thy prayers hurt my wife Elizabeth felt envious and have joy gladness many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of Lord talking to the warrior strong drink and he shall be filled with his with the long-ago sleeper from his mother's womb and many of the tournaments will show returns or their God and he took home before even the spirit and power of the light second coming in there now at four he says to turn the hearts of the father's to the children and that disappeared to the list of other just to make ready a people prepared the floor as I press it onto the evil now we ask the controversial I noticed for an old man and my mother's three hundred years and the angel answered so instead of a blessing he just received and he said I agree brother stand in the presence of God and sent to speak totally to show me these things [Music] today [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] eleven even conceived and asked this question and he gets a review teas that you'll be done up in wispy all the dates of these things are performed in there see question wasn't enough this body changes well the same thing you see what changes it's a question of faith this morning what faith do you have do you have the boldness you have the courage to ask for the impossible what do you have me do this one and then I marry being a type of rock she said before me and then she conceived the promise of being a man and we can do the same thing you can give birth this morning to the promises that are yours your faith can give birth this amen how do you want to exercise and I want you to exercise your faith is a kind we see many other examples I thought about David you know that question we had one that Goliath came out and then I wouldn't be seated you know description of somebody sighs and how big he was and all the our memory had and is you know he's declaration that it's the difference flesh but to the foul the air the beasts of the field and they've been comes and he he has a declaration of faith and then they David Santosh Lux slain a line I played a bear and this uncircumcised Philistine those walks right into and I'll cut your head off he said today and feed it to the thought and then so David was in his death all these great amide is right there down was the enemy his left and whose mystical life sometimes this can be a delight your own flesh and then he struggled to overcome it to believe that all things are possible I was telling my wife last night who over there the importance of the our Blessed ministers box [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] where is the where is this translation where is this does
