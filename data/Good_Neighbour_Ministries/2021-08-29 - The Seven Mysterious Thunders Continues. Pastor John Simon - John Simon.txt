TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and when that comes he said that algebra will be revealed to them at that particular time praise god oh my i don't know much about astronomy i don't know much about geography oh praise god but i know that god has revealed to me this word this led me back where i can see the fullness of the word the word he said it's not even written in the bible praise the lord i've made this kind of clear i'm not going to keep you all day but i want to make this clear that um you know the seven thunders if i can give you a human illustration it's like when you're speaking right there's the word you're hearing and then there's the nuances coming out from that word right because you can read there the book says what or why but then if you heard the actual person use it you will know how why why why why is that see so therefore you can't just trust that you oh i read it in the bible that's good that you read it there but did you get a revelation and the prophet said the only way you can get that he said that will take the author of the book to come and reveal the author of the book has to reveal to you for you to recognize what god is saying in the word that's just being able to read your bible read the quotes it's just being able to know english and have a good intelligence to be able to read and understand that amen hallelujah all praise god hallelujah no brother brown said those seven sons are not even written and if they're not written they're telling you they're not going to believe they're not going to believe it whatsoever because they got to see it to believe it amen right praise god and they're not they're people right now in the world they will not accept the unwritten word in other words they will accept from the seven thunders for the prophet tells you clear and the bible tells you seven thunders were not to be written hallelujah it's to become living epistles to be read of all men in god's people hallelujah the seven thunders are going to be made manifest in a people and will be revealed to them it'll be algebra to the rest of them but to us we will understand you will be made to understand hallelujah i can assume that all of you sitting in front of me is one of them i you must know that for yourself hallelujah you must be able to catch the revelation of the word and let the word embed itself in you wake up the seed of life that is in you the germ the gene that's in you hallelujah where you can't fail to recognize you just oh i'm just a housewife uh oh it ain't got none of that anymore you don't have to know anything when that word begins to break like the prophet said uh wash a woman out in the middle of nowhere one revelation that veil rips once it rips and she puts her head in did she see a little something she started to go in further the next week going further she's gone beyond the veil lord of god hallelujah may god help every one of us to be able to go beyond the veil of the written word and enter into christ the word making itself known hallelujah amen we know that voice the seven thunders israeli the voice of the mighty angel of revelation 10. revelation 10 3 the bible says when he uttered his voice seven thunders blasted out amen remember when them when those various uh messengers came each one of them this thunder broke and a seal blasted and then the truth made known to them they heard one thunder what is telling you they're down through the edges all the other edges got one thunder two 3 being revealed to them in other words they only could receive partial truths is that right but seven is the number of perfection and the mighty angel's message will be the full voice of the mighty angel amen being made known to his beloved bride hallelujah and that means that we have been blessed of god not to hear one thunder blast in a spiritual war declare but we are here hearing the rolling thunder of the voice of the mighty angel amen hallelujah amen rolling roaring rolling what's the difference the voice of the mighty angel rolling with the word of god one after the other bringing you to a place where you recognize that it's god speaking from his word amen glory to god hallelujah amen yes sir oh it's called the unwritten word what's the purpose what's the purpose of those seven mysterious thunders of the voice of that mighty angel that are not written at all listen they're not even written at all i believe that through the purpose of the seven thunders through these seven thunders one will be revealed in order to get the bride together for rupturing faith amen let me go back what's the purpose of the seven thunders the seven thunders will be revealed first of all it will be a revelation right it's telling you right there the seven thunders will be a revelation it's not something you're going to go and study or do all kinds of efforts of man and what's the purpose of it in order to get the bride together in a convention in a camp meeting in any kind of thing like that even though it's good intention that's man-made effort but the fulfillment of the word is the genuine elect of god will come together when the watchman isaiah speaking on the walls of zion will begin to see eye to eye they'll see the same thing if i stand on the rock where moses stood what am i going to see i'm only going to see what he already saw because it's the same scene i'm sitting on the same rock that he stood i'm looking in the same direction so i'm seeing what he saw and that's what the seven thunders does for you and i we begin to see what the prophet saw what he saw on why he said many things that he is saying and has said we begin to get a clear understanding we got a distillation and clarity on what he has said amen because it's right before us by the holy spirit through grace alone amen hallelujah oh my praise god of course if you want to accept the unwritten word you simply won't be in the rapture it's just as simple as that you simply won't be in the rapture because it's the seven unwritten thunders that gives you rapturing faith what is faith what did brother branham say his faith anybody can tell me verbally say it love come on amen faith is a revelation so when he said that the seven thunders would give to us rapturing what revelation rapturing revelation a revelation that will put you in that state that rapturing condition that rapturing state glory to god hallelujah you don't have to do nothing you don't have to try nothing you don't have to work up yourself to nothing but by a revelation amen you are brought into a rapturing condition by the grace of almighty god hallelujah amen yes sir so somebody tells you uh that there's that there's like how i'm preaching now about seven mysterious thunders and the turn of the voice of the mighty angel it's nice for me to be saying that here and you just listening but this is declaring a spiritual war and no doubt there are people that may be fuming angry or mad already from hearing what i'm saying talking about eternal church age how dare you you're talking about seven thunders or not written in the bible and asking me to believe oh my spiritual war hey man you'll understand what i'm saying here i'm going to use up my time if you don't mind is that okay i'm going to use up my time here praise the name of the lord jesus hallelujah a spiritual war is beginning and it's starting with thee with this preaching and talking about the unwritten word amen praise god hallelujah i want to thank god that he had a man named william marion branham who became the mount peace for a voice for the mighty angel many of you have heard it in the in the message i don't know if they still have that part in uh looking to the unseen when a voice suddenly spoke out this is not william branham speaking this is the lord god almighty come down amen praise god what it was the spirit of god speaking through the prophet god making himself known amen hallelujah many times many of you here and if you don't do it you should do it you said but long after i'm gone you just sit in a chair laying up you know in your living room in a quietness and listen while them tips are playing hallelujah and while they're playing there in the middle of the quietness revelation will strike your heart out to the voice of that prophet out of that message revelation is going to strike your heart amen yes sir oh my i tell you friends those seven thunders declares spiritual war amen it brings the bride together i know i'm repeating myself but i'm just nailing like the prophet said a good carpenter you don't hit the nail one time and stop you hit it a couple of times to make sure it catches amen and so here we are it gathers the bride together it gives faith or revelation for rapturing grace hallelujah for revelation is my grace alone praise god hallelujah it reveals christ hallelujah what does the seven thunders do it reveals christ he's revealed in his own word amen let's listen seven thunders to get the bride together because what we got right now we won't be able to do it you're trying to operate on the second pull and get into the rapture by by being able to say you heal this person and you you cast out this devil many gonna come to me in that day and in my name even that's saying that they've done these things but that's not it the thing is the word for this day and for this hour all those things gonna follow the people that are carrying the word of god when it is necessary we don't have to do all these other things to prove that god is with us but when god needs to use you for that purpose it will happen is that right i know what i'm talking i'm just saying hi how are you and i just took the person next thing you know the person's up in the group up in the air and dung on the ground and his demons pull me i didn't do anything i just shook their hand and i wasn't thinking anything just shook their hand that happened will happen to you like the sister that told us how she he going to walk into a room and all of a sudden a woman starts screaming i want nothing to do with you where you come from who are you and turn on like that and everything else the next thing you know the woman's was insane and she prayed for the person and the person's sanity came back to them right now that person didn't run around and make a big thing and everybody uh print a book about it no but those things will happen is that right you believe it praise the lord you know the sister that was dead and literally saw abraham and everything else her testimony is on youtube i believe right praise god right in the church here but it was a big thing printer magazine put it out oh the dead was raised in good neighbor ministries amen uh brother so-and-so prayed for this person and oh my god they were sick and they got better it's happening all the time but they are just to follow us we don't send them ahead to prepare the way for us to make us famous or to give us a big name will just allow god to have his way simplicity humility brother brown said be reverent be humble and god will bless you amen be simple be reverent be humble and god will bless you amen glory to his marvelous name amen oh praise god hallelujah where is where are the preachers and the people going to get this unwritten word from out there are they gonna go and say they're gonna burn the midnight oil with these message books for the you know all night for days they're gonna read them they're gonna study them they're gonna pray over them they're gonna make all kinds of notes and everything else like that whatever oh my no matter what i'm going to get it and they're going to study it no the bible says by studies by faith abel by faith abraham by faith enoch by faith amen it's all by faith it's all by faith by the help by the holy spirit that's gonna hear the voice of the mighty angel when the word begins to you recognize it all of a sudden the excitement built in your soul and the word starts to blast off within you amen inside your entire being praise god hallelujah think of it we've only got faith amen enough faith for that for divine healing yeah there's lots of brothers even in this message they got faith for divine healing and casting out devils and all that he said yeah we only got fed for that amen and that's good but he said you've got to have enough faith or revelation to be changed in a moment to be swept up out of this earth and we will find that after a while the lord willing we will find where it is written listen he said the seven thunder is the unwritten word amen hallelujah now he's turning around and he's saying we got to have revelation right in a moment to be swept up off the earth and we will find that after a while the lord willing we will find where it is written you're going to go right back to these same spoken word books that you used to read and you understood in a certain way and all of a sudden you're gonna find it right in those spoken words book it's written but it's not written you're reading it and when you give somebody else the same thing to read all they can see is the writing but you are reading something else into it because it's right there in front of your eyes you'll find where it is written after a while praise god i think we're in the middle of it right now i believe we are partakers of it then the judgments of these evil doers that we've seen through the church ages as the seals was breaking amen you know that the seals never really just all break at the seventh church age they were breaking down through the ages they only come to the consummation and fullness at the end of time he's saying it right here he said the seals have been breaking through the ages on until now the last seal is broken then all the judgments of these evil doers we see down through the edges as these have been breaking until see until now as they have been watching on these seals and and they were presuming at them and presuming at what they were doing see oh my but now at the end of the ages of all the church ages all of these evil dwarves will take their place and head up begin to head up for the tribulation amen hallelujah oh praise god amen yes sir because their soul can't find no place to identify with it can identify with the word coming forth for this age and can't find no place to identify there praise the lord now let me say something here and remember this or write it down with the seals god used brother branham to identify and to give us the entire history and revelation to uncover satan and all of his evil actions and deeds through the ages of time from the garden of eden right to this hour that's what that was doing making known to you what the devil was doing that's what the seals did is that right as i told you the seals really speak of the past right if you go back and look at all the scenes it's only when you get to the semester don't say nothing you read the same seal you don't read nothing there he's gone into another dimension but all the rest of it is telling you of the past amen and the brothers that study that to death and can outline it to you and they have gifts for that purpose and and god bless them because that's their purpose they can outline all those dispensations and ages and stuff like that and weeks and feasts of weeks and so on they can outline that it's right there amen but these seals amen are all of the evil doers of the seven seals and all their workings working mysteriously within the church amen and we will find out in a minute they even worked in the name of the church amen you see so that's what the seals were for is to unveil or uncover the antichrist or anti-war spirit it was there to uncover the evil one the mystery of inequity the trail of the serpent and you have to know the antichrist to be able to recognize the real christ amen hallelujah uh if you only know white you wouldn't know what is black or black then you know what is white that way praise god hallelujah so the the seals uncovered the anti-war spirit amen so if i see anti-christ everybody is saying antichrist i'm using that term so you can grasp it anti-war spirit it was uncovering that spirit and its activity through the edges hallelujah but now when you can see the true word hallelujah because seven seven seals unveiling uncovering the antichrist seven thunders doing what revealing christ one unveils the antichrist anti-word spirit and the other one reveals the word christ they had stoned hallelujah praise god so uh you see what i'm trying to tell you here now glory to god so brother sister what a hour once you have seen the true word unveiled the devil can't deceive you anymore because he is in the light now amen even if he tries to come to you as an angel alike you already recognize his works his activity his nature and it's always anti-word amen you'll recognize it every time hallelujah that's why brother branham said you got to be humble you got to be simple because it comes so simple if you don't watch it now i'm continuing to quote and now reveals all the mysteries that have gone on in the past see he said now the thought is here at the end time that the mysteries that began way back long ago has come down through the church edges are to be revealed here at the breaking of the seals here at the last age see this is it it reveals it and you see the evil doers and what they are doing within the church and in the name of a church amen hallelujah but thank god hallelujah it's time for the lamb to come and catch his bride away is that right amen we're right at the time where the lamb is now changing his nature from lamb to lion it's moving from savior to judge it's moving from the throne of christ to the great white throne the tribulation is coming upon us oh my brother sister i'm just let me stop right now because it just struck me about the people in louisiana let's just have a moment of prayer for them right now a gracious father while those folks that that horrible monster is striking the coast of the united states and those poor people are under the suffering of kovit and then now with this hurricane striking them the evil ones stirring up these contrary wild winds oh destructive forces lord i pray father you will save as many and such as should be saved protect them cover them under your shelter of your wings father as we commit them to you now in one brief moment of silence before we revert back to the word in jesus name oh my while the storm is raging stand by me while they are when the storm is raging stand by me oh my may god stand by those people in this hour regardless of what you think of what you know you let lord god reach out and stand by them amen praise god hallelujah now we see that judgments are going to start falling the tribulation being part of that judgment you know that tribulation on the earth is part of the judgment starting right there amen meanwhile the bride will be gone for the mystery of inequity is already working hallelujah paul said it the mystery of iniquity way back it's one o'clock oh my i'm going to stop right now if you don't mind i i stop according to my word praise the lord glory to god may god help every one of us and bless us and keep us in this day and hour while the musicians are coming to the front brother sister i'm so glad that god has made known his word to us in this day this time in this hour that we can recognize these seven mysterious thunders of revelation 10 and one what it means for the bride how it blinds some open the eyes of others it shuts some out and it opened the doors for others to enter in it gathers the bride together so that they can see the fullness of the word of god we are we remember we come by invitation we don't come by by by going in or pushing our way and climbing in through a window or or some other way but we are coming in by god's provided way through the opening of his word to some this is to them it doesn't mean anything to them some will say they don't know what i'm even talking about some will not understand but even if somebody's out there never heard nothing like this before and then suddenly hear it if they got that germ of god in them that little piece of god in them is going to light up it's going to explode it's going to open up and that seed is going to feed on the moisture coming forth from the word and they'll receive new life forever more come brother mike praise god hallelujah god bless you pray for me as i pray for you brother sister because i'm glad that i can feel the kiss of the prince charming on my soul i i i feel the blast of those seven sons strike my being amen and i trail for the day when this word will come and fully catch us all away we're already being caught up is that right you're caught up you're already in a heavenly place it's just that you you're not conscious of it praise the lord what you are as paul said you're being changed from glory unto glory on to glory and like i say until one day you step right through the looking glass into glory god bless you all hallelujah [Applause] let's all stand praise god so if we add anything

daughter's on the other side of the world it seemed like but she says oh your daughter's been hit by a car and i need you to speak to the doctor and so um right at that second i had a flash go through my mind and i actually saw rachel being picked up by what i must have been an angel it was a split second and then the doctor came on the phone and she explained that you know that she had quite an impact um she says miraculously there's no broken bones in her body but she is quite hurt and uh you know she had a severe concussion and so but anyways by the grace of god she's back home again um she's healing extremely well i know that uh it's it's supernatural that the lord has kept her and i know that it's because of the prayers of the saints um that you know that she is healing so quickly and so well and also you know we don't take it for granted when we pray for our children you can you can you can count on the lord there was not one second that i doubted the lord in that whole situation that he was in the midst of it and that he is watching over our children i love rachel dearly i love all my children dearly and i know god is keeping them each and every one so thank you
