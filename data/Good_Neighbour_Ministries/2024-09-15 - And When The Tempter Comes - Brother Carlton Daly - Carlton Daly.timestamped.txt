[38:00] very home country that your former
[38:02] Pastor is from from Guyana South America
[38:05] so this is why the connection is there I
[38:07] visited Canada on many occasions because
[38:10] most of my biological relatives lives in
[38:13] Canada I'm the only one in New York
[38:15] flying the New York flag and uh whenever
[38:17] I come to visit I would normally visit

[38:59] there's just one bride amen uh
[39:01] regardless we may have different
[39:03] location of Fellowship but what really
[39:06] unites us is the spirit so I trust that
[39:09] the holy spirit will have his way this

[42:09] TR
[42:14] vanish
[42:16] heart of
[42:22] mened in the pray
[42:28] [Applause]
[42:31] of the
[42:37] king
[42:38] Hallelujah God bless you Saints amen as
[42:42] you stand let us turn to the word of
[42:49] God we'll be reading from The Book of
[42:52] Matthew chapters 4
[42:58] 1 to1 and then Matthew
[43:01] 3 13-1 17 and 1 Peter 5
[43:13] 8-10 then was Jesus led up of the spirit
[43:17] Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the
[43:21] devil and when he had fasted 40 days and
[43:23] 40 nights he was afterward and hunger
[43:28] and when the tempter came to him he said
[43:33] if thou be the Son of God command that
[43:36] these Stones be made
[43:39] bread but he answered and said it is
[43:43] written man should not live by bread
[43:46] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[43:50] out of the mouth of
[43:52] God then the devil taketh him up into
[43:55] the holy city and set him on a pinnacle
[43:58] of the temple and said unto him if thou
[44:02] be the Son of God cast thyself down for
[44:04] it is written he shall give his angels
[44:09] charge concerning thee and in their
[44:12] hands they shall bear thee up least at
[44:16] any time thou Dash thy foot against the
[44:20] stone I just want you to recognize the
[44:22] devil knows the
[44:23] word oh yeah he comes to church
[44:28] amen sometimes we we make it so like
[44:31] it's too hard but I believe he's in
[44:33] every
[44:35] service because he knows the
[44:37] word Jesus said unto him it is written
[44:41] again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
[44:45] God again the devil taketh him up into
[44:49] an exceeding high mountain and showed
[44:52] him all the kingdoms of the
[44:55] world and the glory of them he even saw
[44:59] Canada yes even though it didn't exist
[45:02] back then amen and said unto him all
[45:06] these things will I give thee if thou
[45:08] wil Fall Down and Worship me then said
[45:12] Jesus unto him get thee hence Satan for
[45:15] it is written Thou shalt Worship the
[45:18] Lord thy God and him only shalt thou
[45:24] serve then the devil let him and leaveth
[45:29] him and behold Angels Came and
[45:33] ministered unto him I want you to know
[45:35] that even in your
[45:37] weakness angels are
[45:40] there to minister to youall you're never
[45:44] alone because of who you are amen okay
[45:49] Matthew
[45:51] 3 from verses 13
[45:57] then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan
[46:00] unto John to be baptized of him but John
[46:05] forsake Him
[46:08] saying forbid him sorry saying I have
[46:12] need to be baptized of thee and comest
[46:15] thou to me so you see the word has to
[46:17] come to the word and John answering said
[46:21] unto him suffer it to be so now for thus
[46:25] it becometh us to fulfill all
[46:29] righteousness then he suffered him and
[46:31] John when he was baptized went up
[46:34] straight
[46:35] away out of the water and lo the heavens
[46:39] were open upon him and he saw the spirit
[46:43] of God descending like a dove and
[46:46] lighting upon him and lower voice from
[46:50] Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in
[46:56] whom
[46:57] I'm well pleased and then one other
[46:59] scripture first
[47:04] Peter chapters 5 8 to
[47:12] 10 be
[47:14] sober be vigilant now that is for us
[47:18] okay because your adversary the devil as
[47:23] a roaring
[47:25] lion walk about seeking whom he may
[47:32] devour whom resist steadfast in the
[47:38] faith knowing that the same afflictions
[47:42] are accomplished in your brethren that
[47:47] are in the
[47:49] world but the God of all Grace who had
[47:53] called us onto his eternal
[47:57] Glory not time there's no timeing this
[48:01] amen by Christ Jesus after that ye have
[48:05] suffered a while make you perfect
[48:10] establish
[48:12] strengthen settle you now may the Lord
[48:16] God add us blessing to the reading of
[48:17] his word you may have your
[48:19] seats and I would like to for a little
[48:22] uh title to entitle this and when the
[48:26] tempter
[48:28] comes amen and when the tempter comes
[48:34] and for a
[48:35] context the Builder's
[48:39] reputation amen the Builder
[48:44] reputation now saints of
[48:48] God we all desire to live a comfortable
[48:53] life we desire to have one what this
[48:57] world has to offer in terms of modern
[49:01] day uh
[49:03] technology uh you know it's wealth and
[49:07] all that we can dream of because like in
[49:10] America they say you have the you know
[49:12] the American dream and that is you know
[49:14] to own a house you know and to have
[49:18] whatever luxury that we can have now
[49:20] nothing is wrong with those things
[49:22] saints of God but as sons of God I'm not
[49:26] addressing you you as just Canadian
[49:29] Believers but as sons of God Amen and
[49:32] I'm certain many of you are from other
[49:34] nations as well as I am from Guyana
[49:37] South
[49:37] America but we have to
[49:40] know not only who we are but who God
[49:44] is because you cannot know who you are
[49:47] until you first know brother Bram says
[49:50] who God
[49:51] is and when you get to know by
[49:53] Revelation who God is then he will
[49:57] reveal to you who you are it's not what
[50:01] you think you want to be but it's what
[50:04] he has in his mind concerning you and me
[50:08] and that's what really matters it's not
[50:10] our ambition it's not what we want to be
[50:13] but is what he had
[50:16] predestinated so in other words it has
[50:19] nothing to do with us amen so whatever
[50:22] would be our the end of our faith the
[50:26] end of that we labor and we work for God
[50:29] already knows it he is already
[50:32] pre-planned
[50:33] amen praise God what we will be
[50:37] Hallelujah and you know bream says when
[50:39] this bride gets to know who she is see
[50:43] this is what really matters since then
[50:45] he said the Rapture will go hallelujah
[50:50] amen but this subject this morning and
[50:55] when the tempter
[50:57] comes is something that we have to be we
[51:01] cannot bypass a church if you're a son
[51:06] you must go through that
[51:09] experience your enemy is not who you see
[51:13] sitting beside you or around you it's
[51:17] not the government it's not some race of
[51:19] people but you're enemy as ran says the
[51:22] greatest enemy is
[51:25] yourself when you don't know who you are
[51:29] amen church because if you know who you
[51:32] are whenever the enemy comes you will
[51:35] know how to uh what should I say uh to
[51:38] overcome
[51:40] him amen and the only way you can
[51:43] overcome him is not by your strength
[51:46] it's not by your knowledge but by the
[51:50] word that's the only way we can overcome
[51:52] in and what is the word amen it is not
[51:56] letters because Paul says the letter
[51:58] kill it but the spirit give it life so
[52:02] what is important we must we must have
[52:06] that holy
[52:07] spirit because we can read this Bible
[52:11] intellectually it is not a book of
[52:13] intellectual because Christ said I thank
[52:16] the father that he hid these things from
[52:19] the wise and The Prudent and reveal it
[52:23] to babe so in other words we have have
[52:26] to Humble ourself to be child
[52:30] trained regardless you might be in your
[52:32] 70s or your 60s amen you may have been
[52:34] in this message a long long time that
[52:37] means nothing Saints but until you can
[52:39] become like a child to be child train
[52:44] then you are meat for the master
[52:47] service so it's to know how to humble
[52:51] yourself that's what really matters amen
[52:54] and even to humble yourself is one of
[52:56] the hardest thing to do because we have
[52:58] what you call a free moral
[53:00] agency amen we have you know uh what you
[53:04] call a
[53:05] self-esteem who are you to talk to me
[53:07] like that now Christ could have said the
[53:10] same thing who are you to talk to me
[53:11] like that but all he did was not use his
[53:14] power amen he never used Miracles but he
[53:18] used it is
[53:20] written hallelujah hallelujah it is
[53:22] written because in the beginning was the
[53:27] word not Miracles even though we believe
[53:30] in miracles because you can't have
[53:32] Miracles by bypassing the word you must
[53:36] have the word first for the Miracles to
[53:39] follow but there are people who want
[53:41] Miracles but they don't want the
[53:43] word amen so you can receive Miracles
[53:46] you can you know be healed and still be
[53:50] lost you can receive the anointing of
[53:53] the Holy Ghost thank God for this
[53:55] message can still be lost you said but
[53:58] brother de I can't understand that I
[54:00] thought when I get the Holy Ghost that's
[54:01] it you see but you can have the Holy
[54:03] Ghost Amen on your flesh yes you can
[54:07] have it you know uh what should I say in
[54:09] your mind but unless it gets into that
[54:13] Soul amen the Bible says it's not the
[54:15] body that sinth but it's the soul that
[54:18] sinth it shall die Hallelujah so how do
[54:21] you receive the word in the first place
[54:24] you cannot just say you'll take the tape
[54:27] and you will listen to the tape with all
[54:29] due
[54:30] respect amen but Faith cometh by hearing
[54:35] and by hearing the word of God and how
[54:38] can you hear except God
[54:41] sends he said I will give you
[54:46] pastors not one but plural I will give
[54:50] you pastors according to my own heart
[54:57] so it's not you trying to qualify
[54:58] yourself or brother they trying to
[55:00] qualify himself that I'm around for a
[55:02] long time and you know it's time for the
[55:04] pastor to give me this position but
[55:05] unless God gives
[55:07] you Hallelujah you're not a gift to the
[55:10] people it's just your ego it is just
[55:14] your knowledge and we saw Paul before he
[55:18] was converted had such knowledge he
[55:20] thought he was doing God a
[55:22] service but without
[55:25] Revelation but but when because God had
[55:28] chosen him hallelujah amen it's not Paul
[55:31] choosing you could have never choosen
[55:33] yourself to believe this message the
[55:36] only way you can be where you are this
[55:38] morning is because God choose
[55:41] you we never choose ourself this is why
[55:45] when the tempter comes except God
[55:48] chooses you you're no match for
[55:50] [Applause]
[55:51] him Jesus didn't choose to come but he
[55:55] was tent of the father but he's not
[55:58] another person it is just that God who
[56:01] is a spirit because God is not a man
[56:03] he's a spirit but that Spirit has to
[56:05] take on bodily form amen so this is why
[56:09] he chose and he you know he stepped out
[56:13] amen from this uh logos from this great
[56:18] you know Spirit to become
[56:21] visible so that you can see him and know
[56:25] that he's not just a Son of God but he
[56:28] is God because he told the devil worship
[56:32] God but you think he was saying another
[56:35] person but the devil didn't have
[56:37] Revelation who was in him so to be a Son
[56:41] of God this morning you're not just a
[56:42] church member you are God in
[56:48] flesh it's not God now only in Jesus
[56:52] that's right amen because Jesus without
[56:55] the Christ is is just a Jesus like the
[56:57] Jesus there are many people that have
[56:59] the name Jesus but are they the Christ
[57:03] and the devil know that there's going to
[57:05] be a Christ he know there's going to be
[57:08] a Seed of Abraham he know there's going
[57:10] to be a woman's seed so he was hunting
[57:13] for that seed Hallelujah from since the
[57:15] garden he was hunting for it but Adam
[57:19] failed
[57:21] amen uh Noah failed because he drank
[57:25] After the flood and he died Moses failed
[57:29] all the prophets but when it came to
[57:31] this one that came to John in the water
[57:35] John said I'm not worthy for you to come
[57:38] to me but he said suffer it so John
[57:40] Hallelujah so he's giving the example
[57:44] and how we should be
[57:47] identified because you can't just come
[57:49] to church and sit there and say you
[57:50] believe the
[57:52] message because you have to follow God's
[57:55] Pro PR you must be
[57:59] baptized amen you must be filled with
[58:01] the spirit Hallelujah so he came now
[58:04] what baptism signifies death burial and
[58:10] Resurrection Hallelujah because without
[58:12] the resurrection our faith is
[58:15] dead amen so when you are baptized it
[58:18] means you're dying you are buried but
[58:22] then the victory is you'll rise again so
[58:25] we must know him in the power of his
[58:32] resurrection now if you have a very
[58:35] close loving relative of yours and death
[58:39] strikes that family it's it's hard even
[58:42] though you're a message believer that is
[58:44] no
[58:45] ordinary
[58:47] experienceing I've lost both my father
[58:49] and mother you know they are there in
[58:52] the grave now they were not message
[58:54] Believers but you know what I thank God
[58:57] for that God used
[58:59] them as the
[59:02] channel to bring me into this
[59:05] world and on the basis of knowing that
[59:10] God had used them I have a
[59:14] hope that even though they may not know
[59:17] or understand about this message saints
[59:19] of God but they have brought a Son of
[59:23] God hallelujah thank J into this world
[59:27] and thank God for this message BR said I
[59:29] now know that I am more than Ella bradam
[59:33] or you know Charles Bram son but I am a
[59:36] Son of
[59:38] God so what that means Church you have
[59:41] no
[59:42] beginning Jesus and you can have no
[59:45] end but this Mortal will perish but
[59:49] before it does God already has a plan
[59:52] that he already has a body that if only
[59:55] he can allow us to see beyond this
[59:58] natural and see what we are in the
[1:00:00] spiritual Hallelujah there's nothing
[1:00:03] look even though you don't have a job
[1:00:04] you still Rejoice because just having
[1:00:06] that revelation of who you are as Son of
[1:00:09] God that when the enemy comes to say you
[1:00:12] have cancer you have stage four you know
[1:00:14] you're going to die look him in the face
[1:00:16] and say yes I don't mind but this you're
[1:00:18] speaking to
[1:00:19] this but you're not speaking to that
[1:00:21] what is inside of me because the real me
[1:00:25] is not what you're seeing on the outside
[1:00:26] the real me is what is on the
[1:00:31] inside and I know that one can't
[1:00:34] die Hallelujah now look we would say in
[1:00:38] this life the best time of our life is
[1:00:42] when probably you were working in a
[1:00:44] company and you got
[1:00:47] promoted from a supervisor now to a
[1:00:50] manager or probably the CEO and you know
[1:00:52] what benefits goes with that all right I
[1:00:55] I've the experience you don't pay for
[1:00:57] your gas when you go to the gas station
[1:00:59] the company pays for it you don't pay
[1:01:01] for your
[1:01:02] electricity for your home the company
[1:01:04] pays for it all you have to do is submit
[1:01:06] the
[1:01:07] bills and all the bills are paid you
[1:01:10] think you want to give that
[1:01:12] up to accept you know something where
[1:01:16] you it has to come out of your
[1:01:17] pocket amen I don't knowah you say I
[1:01:20] work hard for it amen and now I've
[1:01:23] achieved so it's the best time of my
[1:01:26] life but that's for Mortal but when it
[1:01:29] comes to a Son of God the best time of
[1:01:32] your life is when the test comes amen
[1:01:36] now I know we would get much amen
[1:01:38] there thank you Jesus who pray and ask
[1:01:42] God give me a
[1:01:43] test who pray and ask God give me stage
[1:01:46] four cancer you're you got to be a mad
[1:01:49] man who pray and ask God well let my
[1:01:51] wife give me some trouble or let my wife
[1:01:54] husband give me some trouble nobody
[1:01:56] prays like that but God will allow
[1:01:59] it and the reason why he will allow it
[1:02:02] is to prove to the devil who you
[1:02:05] are
[1:02:08] hall because you're not just a Mr and
[1:02:11] Mrs daily son but you're a Son of
[1:02:14] God and as long as you're a Son of God
[1:02:17] his eyes are upon you all the days of
[1:02:21] your life now I would just like to give
[1:02:23] you a little example here of what it is
[1:02:27] to be
[1:02:29] chosen and the material that you're made
[1:02:32] up of this morning amen we all know
[1:02:36] brother Bram isn't that so yes sir we
[1:02:38] all know the test he went through don't
[1:02:39] we all right we see how you know we read
[1:02:43] uh his life story and we can always talk
[1:02:45] about brother Brown's life story but you
[1:02:47] can talk about all of that still church
[1:02:49] and still be
[1:02:50] lost God is not taking you into the
[1:02:52] Rapture because you know about William
[1:02:54] Brandon
[1:02:56] you have to come to know who you
[1:03:00] are this bridge is not
[1:03:03] between you know life and Eternity is
[1:03:06] not a one man's
[1:03:08] Bridge it's not M William branham's
[1:03:12] bridge but God had built a bridge and
[1:03:15] you know Bram told of it wasn't a story
[1:03:18] it's a a real life situation we're in
[1:03:23] Australia there was this challenge to
[1:03:26] build a bridge in the harbor you know
[1:03:29] from I can't remember if it was Sydney
[1:03:31] what have you but the government had put
[1:03:34] out uh tender for
[1:03:37] engineers who are qualified enough to
[1:03:41] build this bridge across the harbor and
[1:03:44] there are some who put in the tender
[1:03:46] they came and they started to do their
[1:03:48] you know survey and test and you know
[1:03:51] they dug and very deep but then they
[1:03:53] come to realize that the depth is too
[1:03:56] deep and even though they put the steel
[1:04:00] piles or what have you it would not hold
[1:04:03] so many of them tried their best but it
[1:04:05] couldn't work so it seems as though
[1:04:07] nobody could take that challenge until
[1:04:10] one day there was an English engineer a
[1:04:12] young man that came and said I can do
[1:04:15] the job so everybody looked at him and
[1:04:17] think well who are you and what he
[1:04:20] did first of all he made sure that when
[1:04:25] they
[1:04:26] dog deep they went all the way to
[1:04:30] bedrock you have to hit Bedrock cuz
[1:04:33] until you find Bedrock if you're just
[1:04:35] hitting sand you're just hitting mud it
[1:04:37] cannot stand so you have to go deep so
[1:04:41] Saints I want you to know this morning
[1:04:42] we have to go deep you can't just sit in
[1:04:45] church and just you know a quick sermon
[1:04:47] and we go home we have to go deep until
[1:04:51] we come to bedrock and you know Bedrock
[1:04:53] is Christ am on Christ the solid rock I
[1:04:57] stand all other ground is sinking sand
[1:05:00] so make sure you find Bedrock so when he
[1:05:03] found Bedrock he said okay I know I can
[1:05:06] build this bridge but that was not all
[1:05:09] it's not how deep you go you have to
[1:05:11] find the material so to set up now your
[1:05:14] columns and your piles and your Steel
[1:05:18] Etc but he does just go and buy any
[1:05:21] steel now when we look at steel because
[1:05:24] we don't have the knowledge of what is
[1:05:25] the quality of Steel always said that's
[1:05:27] a good piece of Steel let me buy it but
[1:05:29] he didn't do that he know that that
[1:05:31] steel had to be tried tested proven not
[1:05:36] only for the depth but for uh nature you
[1:05:41] know the the challenges of nature okay
[1:05:44] over a period of time where if it would
[1:05:46] rust and you know it will collapse
[1:05:48] eventually so he had to have a steel
[1:05:50] made of the best
[1:05:52] material so for God to build this bridge
[1:05:55] Between Heaven and Earth he has to look
[1:05:58] around Toronto he has to look around
[1:06:00] Burlington and I'm certain there are
[1:06:02] hundreds of thousands of people here but
[1:06:04] why
[1:06:08] you why choose you from Burlington why
[1:06:12] choose you from Toronto why are you so
[1:06:16] special there are other people that do
[1:06:17] great things but why you now you didn't
[1:06:20] know that but God know what you made up
[1:06:22] of he know the quality of the material
[1:06:26] that our faith is made up of so he's
[1:06:30] going to choose not only the best but
[1:06:31] the best of the
[1:06:33] best so the bride this morning is no
[1:06:35] ordinary people they are the best of the
[1:06:39] best nobody may have told you so but he
[1:06:42] is telling you this morning you're not
[1:06:44] here by chance but I have chosen you and
[1:06:48] the reason why I'm chosen you because
[1:06:50] I'm building a bridge and in this bridge
[1:06:53] you're a part of that bridge
[1:06:57] Hallelujah so he will have to get the
[1:06:59] best
[1:07:00] steel and not only steel he has to get
[1:07:03] now the concrete or what you call it the
[1:07:05] mixture of Sand and Stone and uh the
[1:07:09] cement also have to be of the best
[1:07:12] quality because again it has to
[1:07:15] withstand the weather it has to
[1:07:18] withstand the salt it has to withstand
[1:07:21] the wind amen so he has to have the best
[1:07:24] material
[1:07:26] Hallelujah so this is why when the
[1:07:28] tempter
[1:07:29] comes it's God proving
[1:07:32] you that Under Pressure you will not
[1:07:36] give up under pressure you w't leave the
[1:07:39] church under pressure even the pastor
[1:07:41] preached something that you didn't like
[1:07:43] but God knows it's the best for you
[1:07:46] because he's proving you are not
[1:07:49] believing and following this message
[1:07:51] because of your pastor because of
[1:07:53] brother Bram or because of brother
[1:07:54] Bramson but you are following because
[1:07:57] you are
[1:07:59] chosen you are an
[1:08:02] elect it had nothing to do with you
[1:08:04] Saints so you had to search the whole
[1:08:07] world at this end time to find the best
[1:08:11] of all the church ages now all the other
[1:08:15] Church ages came to an
[1:08:17] end Hallelujah they all died you cannot
[1:08:21] go back to Wesley you can't go back to
[1:08:23] Luther you cannot even go back to
[1:08:27] Pentecost Hallelujah now you say but
[1:08:29] brother hold up hold up are you against
[1:08:32] Pentecost no church I believe in
[1:08:34] Pentecost but we have to have more than
[1:08:39] Pentecost let me give you a simple
[1:08:41] example thank you Jesus in Matthew sorry
[1:08:44] in the Old
[1:08:46] Testament we know that life begins with
[1:08:49] a birth all the way back in
[1:08:52] Eden but the first birth in Eden was not
[1:08:56] by the spoken
[1:08:58] word it was by
[1:09:01] sensation Eve was deceived by the
[1:09:06] serpent it brought
[1:09:08] sensation it felt
[1:09:11] good it tasted good and she went to her
[1:09:15] husband with that sensation now don't
[1:09:17] you think Adam knew what
[1:09:20] happened he know he is the
[1:09:24] word Hallelujah he's not just a man but
[1:09:28] he's a word because a Son of God means
[1:09:31] you are part of the
[1:09:33] word and brother says one word slightly
[1:09:37] doubted one word broken brings the fall
[1:09:41] this is why we are all old aged this
[1:09:42] morning we can't stop it this is why we
[1:09:45] have cancer every trouble we have in the
[1:09:47] land right now is all because of what
[1:09:49] took
[1:09:50] place with that first
[1:09:53] birth and that first birth was not by
[1:09:56] the spoken word but it was by sensation
[1:10:00] but it started with a false
[1:10:04] preacher sir sir amen
[1:10:07] hallelujah so this is where your Trouble
[1:10:10] Comes is if your the preacher is not a
[1:10:13] man of God chosen of God sent of God a
[1:10:16] man according to his own
[1:10:18] heart then the church is in
[1:10:21] trouble amen so he started off preaching
[1:10:26] didn't God say she said yeah he
[1:10:30] did but didn't he tell you that this
[1:10:33] thing has
[1:10:35] sensation said but you know uh that part
[1:10:38] I'm not too certain about so he said I
[1:10:41] want you to know it is good it tastes
[1:10:45] good and when you do it then your eyes
[1:10:47] will be
[1:10:48] open Church what opens our eyes is it
[1:10:52] sensation or is it revelation
[1:10:56] amen so just to make it short she fell
[1:11:00] for
[1:11:01] it sensation and it brought conception
[1:11:06] right come on and that conception God
[1:11:09] already
[1:11:11] knew what would take
[1:11:13] place Hallelujah and he already had
[1:11:17] preparation yes for what had happened
[1:11:20] then thank God for his full knowledge
[1:11:24] thank God for predestination am thank
[1:11:27] God for election Church Hallelujah but
[1:11:30] nevertheless he allowed
[1:11:33] it because for his elect there's a way
[1:11:38] out and the only way out is by God
[1:11:42] himself becoming one of us
[1:11:46] amen hallelujah not the spirit but God
[1:11:50] had the spirit had to become
[1:11:52] flesh so that first birth was by by
[1:11:55] sensation and Adam followed that
[1:12:00] move that he too went with
[1:12:03] sensation now he
[1:12:04] knew as God told him the day you touch
[1:12:07] that
[1:12:08] tree the day you die was it a physical
[1:12:11] tree but said no she was that tree
[1:12:13] because a tree of
[1:12:15] life amen life comes either by a woman
[1:12:19] or by the new
[1:12:21] birth Hallelujah we were all born out of
[1:12:24] that old carnal nature this is why we
[1:12:27] suffer this is why we die but when Jesus
[1:12:30] came he said you must be born
[1:12:33] again Hallelujah hallu but not by
[1:12:36] sensation even though it can bring
[1:12:38] sensation but not sensation so much just
[1:12:41] in the
[1:12:42] flesh but the
[1:12:44] Revelation the wine of
[1:12:47] stimulation Hallelujah will make you
[1:12:49] scream will make you jump but it's not
[1:12:52] so much a fleshly thing church it's a
[1:12:55] Revelation so from Eve in the garden all
[1:12:59] the way all the prophets were born by
[1:13:04] sensation and then when we come to the
[1:13:06] New
[1:13:06] Testament there were two
[1:13:09] women
[1:13:11] Elizabeth zachariah's wife she was of
[1:13:15] age she was Barren and God sent an angel
[1:13:20] to Zachariah and said you and Elizabeth
[1:13:23] will have a son like me an old man so
[1:13:27] there was a body
[1:13:30] change and Zachariah and Elizabeth by
[1:13:35] sensation brought by conception John the
[1:13:40] Baptist Hallelujah by
[1:13:43] sensation but was John the Baptist the
[1:13:47] Christ was William Bram the Christ
[1:13:51] no when they came to him they said are
[1:13:53] you the Christ and many even in the
[1:13:57] message will want to make brother Bram
[1:13:58] Christ now that is an antichrist
[1:14:02] Spirit Hallelujah I don't care how much
[1:14:05] the the God use the prophet but he's not
[1:14:10] God he was born like any one of us he
[1:14:14] was born to even tell lies like any one
[1:14:16] of
[1:14:17] us hallelujah you don't think God know
[1:14:19] all our mistakes he know the lies we
[1:14:22] would have made but by for knowledge by
[1:14:26] predestination he saw us
[1:14:28] perfect Hallelujah so how will he bring
[1:14:31] that Perfection it had to come by more
[1:14:34] than a John it has to come by more than
[1:14:36] a William brandham it has to come by the
[1:14:39] Holy Ghost
[1:14:41] himself
[1:14:42] Hallelujah so Elizabeth
[1:14:46] had the same Angel
[1:14:49] Gabriel that came to Zachariah that
[1:14:53] brought her John the Baptist but by
[1:14:56] sensation not the word sensation I mean
[1:15:00] they were given a promise Hallelujah and
[1:15:02] they believed the promise but
[1:15:05] Mary 800 years prior Isaiah the prophet
[1:15:10] says a virgin shall conceive how can you
[1:15:13] fathom that how can a virgin conceive
[1:15:17] without
[1:15:20] sensation how could you the virgin of
[1:15:22] Christ conceive without sensation
[1:15:26] but the word was already spoken a virgin
[1:15:30] shall conceive and nobody's going to
[1:15:32] stop that not even God could stop that
[1:15:36] because there's a time appointed that we
[1:15:39] the Virgin bride of Christ must become
[1:15:42] pregnated but pregnated by the spoken
[1:15:46] word
[1:15:48] hallelujah so
[1:15:50] Mary a virgin going to the well and here
[1:15:54] come
[1:15:55] Gabriel Hail
[1:15:57] Mary thou are found highly favored among
[1:16:00] women and you know the Roman Catholics
[1:16:02] take that and they tried to make her the
[1:16:04] mother of God what
[1:16:07] nonsense Hallelujah but she's a virgin
[1:16:10] and all the Angels said to her you're
[1:16:13] going to have a child and his name Shall
[1:16:16] be Called
[1:16:18] Jesus but she said I know no
[1:16:21] man he said I know that
[1:16:25] Church Bear in mind don't we know
[1:16:28] brother
[1:16:29] brandham you think this message is of a
[1:16:32] man
[1:16:34] no did Brother brandham know
[1:16:37] you cuz if he did you can't bring the
[1:16:41] Christ
[1:16:42] child because this message is not by a
[1:16:46] man this message is by the holy
[1:16:50] spirit it's not a man's thing this is
[1:16:53] why we will both our church is better
[1:16:56] than any other church we have the best
[1:16:58] message preacher in Canada we have the
[1:16:59] best message preacher in New York we
[1:17:01] have the best message preacher in
[1:17:03] Trinidad or South Africa
[1:17:06] man but this Christ child is not going
[1:17:09] to come by a
[1:17:12] man she said I know no man how am I
[1:17:15] going to have this child he said the
[1:17:17] Holy
[1:17:18] Ghost shall overshadow
[1:17:22] thee no man shall overshadow thee
[1:17:25] because if he was a man we will lift up
[1:17:27] a man and this is why if you don't get
[1:17:29] this birth right we are going to lift up
[1:17:31] brother Brandon before the people and
[1:17:33] it's going to confuse the people we
[1:17:35] don't know if this message is right but
[1:17:38] if you're a Mary it cannot be wrong
[1:17:40] church because you know you didn't
[1:17:42] receive it by a man but you receive it
[1:17:45] by Revelation the Holy Ghost shall
[1:17:48] overshadow youus
[1:17:52] [Applause]
[1:17:55] now in the garden Eve had to know Adam
[1:17:58] and she knew the
[1:18:00] serpent she had a relationship with
[1:18:03] boat and she produced conception by boat
[1:18:08] but look what it brought Church death
[1:18:10] yes fighting murder see that's why
[1:18:14] anytime you're born of a man you'll be a
[1:18:18] murderer you're born of a man you'll
[1:18:21] leave church you're born of a man when
[1:18:23] The Temper comes
[1:18:25] you don't know how to
[1:18:28] overcome Jesus never said Joseph is my
[1:18:31] father neither do he ever say Mary is my
[1:18:34] mother but he know where he come from he
[1:18:38] said I come from God and I'm going back
[1:18:41] to God every son and daughter we are not
[1:18:43] from Trinidad we are not from Canada we
[1:18:46] are not from New York but we come from
[1:18:50] God
[1:18:51] Hallelujah the same holy ghost that was
[1:18:54] in Jesus is the same holy ghost in every
[1:18:57] son and daughter of God
[1:19:00] hallelujah and when you come to know
[1:19:02] that like brother Braham says I now know
[1:19:06] I'm not the son of Ella and Charles
[1:19:10] Branham which Pentecostal Church could
[1:19:13] preach
[1:19:15] that I'm not against Pentecostal church
[1:19:18] I believe they had their day but church
[1:19:22] we are further up the road
[1:19:26] hallelujah hallu hallelujah you know
[1:19:29] look I'm not trying to be political but
[1:19:31] right now in the United States is
[1:19:33] political season and one of the
[1:19:35] candidates is saying we are not going
[1:19:39] back she's
[1:19:41] right but that is just
[1:19:44] politics but this bride we are not going
[1:19:48] back but we are going ahead we are going
[1:19:52] on to the Statue of a perfect man we are
[1:19:54] going on to Perfection Church Hallelujah
[1:19:58] the Pentecostals had yes their time they
[1:20:00] taught that speaking in tongues falling
[1:20:02] down was really it no I'm not against it
[1:20:05] I believe it is but we will not all
[1:20:07] speak in
[1:20:09] tongues we will not all
[1:20:11] interpret we were not all you know the
[1:20:13] the gifts but the best of it is when we
[1:20:17] could just have the
[1:20:20] revelation of who Jesus is amen of
[1:20:24] righteousness is not what you can do
[1:20:27] your righteousness is not your
[1:20:28] experience but your righteousness is
[1:20:30] your
[1:20:31] Revelation that Jesus Christ is our
[1:20:35] righteousness he has already done all
[1:20:38] that we need Hallelujah to make us a son
[1:20:41] and daughter of God
[1:20:44] hallelujah so our righteousness is
[1:20:48] him the devil came to him if thou
[1:20:51] be
[1:20:52] if Hallelujah and it's the same thing
[1:20:55] those who are looking at our life if
[1:20:58] thou be but you must know in your heart
[1:21:01] I
[1:21:04] am not if thou
[1:21:07] be thank you Pastor but I
[1:21:11] am who I am not because of what I made
[1:21:15] myself but because of
[1:21:17] revelation God has opened to me amen
[1:21:20] these
[1:21:21] mysteries of where I come from
[1:21:25] my ancestor is not Africa or Ireland or
[1:21:30] Europe that's what politicians fight for
[1:21:33] that's what you know this body of us the
[1:21:36] way we look at it fight for but that
[1:21:39] spirit that is in us that spirit that
[1:21:41] Mary
[1:21:43] recognized that the Holy Ghost shall
[1:21:45] overshadow the she didn't ask any other
[1:21:46] question all she said is be it unto
[1:21:50] me be it unto me no question why because
[1:21:54] God chose her
[1:21:56] amen God elected her don't you think
[1:21:59] there were many other virgins in Mary's
[1:22:02] time but why
[1:22:04] Mary God doesn't make mistakes Church
[1:22:07] don't you think there are many good
[1:22:08] people like you in the world right now
[1:22:10] in Burlington wherever you live but why
[1:22:14] you is it because your pastor called you
[1:22:16] he couldn't call you Church the Bible
[1:22:19] says no man can come except who the
[1:22:22] father
[1:22:24] now a lot of us would say when we die we
[1:22:26] want to go to heaven where are you going
[1:22:28] to heaven where is your
[1:22:31] destination where you going to live who
[1:22:34] you going to connect with in
[1:22:36] heaven when Jesus came he said I go the
[1:22:40] way to the
[1:22:42] father and except I go you can
[1:22:45] come Hallelujah so he never came to take
[1:22:48] us to heaven but he's coming to take us
[1:22:52] back to the father which is he
[1:22:57] himself so when you die look you know
[1:22:59] Heaven and Earth will pass away so why
[1:23:01] you want to go to
[1:23:06] heaven it will pass away but the word
[1:23:10] will never pass
[1:23:12] away so when you die bury me in the word
[1:23:16] when you rise you're still in the word
[1:23:18] and the word cannot pass away but
[1:23:20] Heavens will pass away Earth will pass
[1:23:22] away but the word will never pass
[1:23:25] away thank
[1:23:27] you so when your parents or whoever di
[1:23:30] don't say well they are in
[1:23:31] heaven do you know you're in heaven
[1:23:33] right
[1:23:34] now
[1:23:36] ah said brother de if this was why we
[1:23:38] have all this fight
[1:23:40] around why is the church you know people
[1:23:43] are crying when the doctor give you a
[1:23:45] terrible
[1:23:46] diagnosis but he say you're already in
[1:23:48] Heavenly places in Christ
[1:23:51] Jesus yes sir but you see this physical
[1:23:54] will still have to connect with this
[1:23:57] Earthly Dimension but there's a world
[1:24:01] Beyond this
[1:24:02] world that is called Eternal hallah he's
[1:24:06] not calling you to time but he's calling
[1:24:09] you to
[1:24:10] Eternity that's what we long for church
[1:24:13] that when this Earthly is dissolved
[1:24:15] you're not coming as an old man
[1:24:16] again if my father has to raise you
[1:24:19] think I want to see him as an old man
[1:24:20] again because we have to bury him
[1:24:23] again that's double you know
[1:24:28] expenses so
[1:24:30] why oh come back come back for what more
[1:24:37] trouble this is why BR said be on the
[1:24:39] curtain of time when he saw what it was
[1:24:41] like there he said for me to go back to
[1:24:43] the body I don't want to go it's so much
[1:24:45] better here he said it's Perfection time
[1:24:48] Perfection time Perfection a brother
[1:24:50] could hug a sister and there's no
[1:24:52] sensation
[1:24:53] [Applause]
[1:24:56] thank you Lord because that body is a
[1:24:58] glorified
[1:24:59] body said there's no sex
[1:25:02] organ in that body you think
[1:25:05] Pentecostals could have preached that to
[1:25:07] us you think Peter James and John could
[1:25:10] have preached that to us sir Hallelujah
[1:25:13] but it had to take a son of man Ministry
[1:25:15] Hallelujah because the last
[1:25:17] sign Before Destruction is not
[1:25:21] California going under everybody
[1:25:23] California you see the
[1:25:24] California so
[1:25:26] what but the last sign before the
[1:25:30] destruction is the visitation of son of
[1:25:34] man and church that sign has already
[1:25:37] come and the whole world have missed
[1:25:39] it you know why they are not sheep to
[1:25:44] hear the voice of the great
[1:25:47] shepherd He said only sheep will hear my
[1:25:50] voice so anytime you play that tape
[1:25:53] church it's not just a message tape but
[1:25:55] that voice is connected to what is
[1:25:58] inside of you that you know that is more
[1:26:01] than William Branham that's the voice of
[1:26:03] God opening to me who I
[1:26:06] am hallelujah thank where I come from so
[1:26:10] even though you and your wife or your
[1:26:12] loved one may have some kind of a fight
[1:26:15] not physical amen but disagreement and
[1:26:19] you know you hear some news that your
[1:26:21] son had an accident and he died it's
[1:26:22] it's it's terrible Church
[1:26:24] but when you come to know who you are
[1:26:26] you have a
[1:26:28] hope take all you can take away from me
[1:26:31] but give me
[1:26:33] Jesus that I know that I have the power
[1:26:37] of the Resurrection in me hallelujah
[1:26:40] amen so coming back to building this
[1:26:41] bridge this man choose the best of
[1:26:44] material he tested it to make sure that
[1:26:47] he had the best because like I said you
[1:26:50] have to deal with the salt water you
[1:26:52] have to deal with the movement of water
[1:26:54] you have to deal with the soil and if it
[1:26:56] is not the best Church it will crumble
[1:26:59] so you may say okay from the time I
[1:27:00] believe this message I should be ready
[1:27:01] for Rapture no no no you got to be
[1:27:03] tested first and you know how you're
[1:27:06] going to be tested God will let the
[1:27:07] Comfort sorry the
[1:27:10] tempter come after you you cannot escape
[1:27:13] a church as long as you're a son brother
[1:27:16] said every son must be tried and
[1:27:21] tested and God went through it himself
[1:27:25] he didn't allow man to do it but he
[1:27:27] himself came and the devil said if thou
[1:27:30] be now notice what he asked not if thou
[1:27:32] be the son of Joseph the son of Mary the
[1:27:34] son of a Jew or Israel but if thou be
[1:27:37] the Son of God you see what he's
[1:27:40] haunting
[1:27:41] down you think the devil is haunting
[1:27:44] down uh
[1:27:46] the good uh neighbors Ministry member
[1:27:52] he's not looking for that church but
[1:27:53] he's looking for for a son this morning
[1:27:56] and as long as you meet that
[1:27:58] criteria rest assure he's coming after
[1:28:02] you but brother Del can something stop
[1:28:05] it no church it must come because you
[1:28:08] have to overcome not by being a member
[1:28:10] of this church but by being who you are
[1:28:12] as a son because the word is in you like
[1:28:16] the word was in Mary this is why she
[1:28:19] said be it unto me according so Mary
[1:28:22] brought forth a son
[1:28:24] but he was not a son of Joseph neither
[1:28:27] was he a son of Israel but he was a Son
[1:28:29] of God you see the difference so one is
[1:28:31] by
[1:28:32] sensation it's good church John the
[1:28:35] Baptist was a prophet but it took more
[1:28:38] than a
[1:28:40] prophet it took more than a John the
[1:28:43] Baptist it took the Holy Ghost himself
[1:28:46] the
[1:28:47] person choosing you to be his Temple his
[1:28:51] Tabernacle that he now dwells in you
[1:28:54] amen that John said I saw the Spirit
[1:28:56] descending upon him and here God said
[1:28:59] this is the one that I am well pleased
[1:29:03] thank you Lord because he overcame the
[1:29:05] test so Church whenever you're going
[1:29:08] through your test don't deem it to be
[1:29:12] you have done something
[1:29:13] wrong thank God for it because you know
[1:29:17] why it is the best time of your life do
[1:29:20] you see any Paparazzi coming around when
[1:29:22] you were sick
[1:29:25] taking your picture and putting it in
[1:29:26] the Times magazine or the newspaper no
[1:29:29] church but when you're married and you
[1:29:31] have a horse driven Carriage with you
[1:29:34] and your
[1:29:36] wife the best time of my life look at my
[1:29:38] toxedo look at her $50,000 dress huh
[1:29:43] that's not a test church that is just
[1:29:47] vanity and God is not dealing with
[1:29:50] vanity he's dealing with proven
[1:29:53] character amen so what he will allow the
[1:29:57] devil to hit you with
[1:29:58] cancer the devil would hit you with some
[1:30:00] kind of a disease that the doctors have
[1:30:02] no answer
[1:30:04] to or even cause the church to break up
[1:30:08] what are you going to do now now on the
[1:30:10] internet brother brand is not a prophet
[1:30:12] he's a false prophet what are you going
[1:30:13] to do about the
[1:30:14] message the test is going to
[1:30:18] come and he's coming after you so to be
[1:30:21] a son this morning I hope that after
[1:30:24] this service you don't want to change
[1:30:25] from a son to a church
[1:30:30] member cuz you cannot escape this test
[1:30:33] and let me tell you every test for a son
[1:30:35] is the
[1:30:36] best it's the best time of your life
[1:30:39] brother daily for all those years I'm on
[1:30:41] bed and I'm struggling I'm praying and
[1:30:43] this thing is not going and the doctor
[1:30:45] tell me I'll die you are saying that is
[1:30:47] the best time of my life yes it
[1:30:50] is because that's what God choose for
[1:30:53] you
[1:30:55] look when Jesus was going through his
[1:30:56] test all his best friends all his best
[1:30:59] buddies left
[1:31:01] him he said aren't you going to pray
[1:31:04] with me an hour people are falling
[1:31:08] asleep and blood virtually is coming
[1:31:11] through his
[1:31:13] sweat and even he himself Jesus said
[1:31:18] father why me take this cup away from me
[1:31:23] but then Revelation had a strike you're
[1:31:26] not a sensational burn but you are born
[1:31:29] of the Holy
[1:31:31] Ghost you're born of the word and your
[1:31:34] life was made manifest for this hour
[1:31:38] Hallelujah so there he said nevertheless
[1:31:41] it's not my will but thy will be done
[1:31:44] how many of us when our test comes we
[1:31:46] can say Lord thy will be done said
[1:31:49] that's all you Brethren have to tell me
[1:31:52] do you understand what I'm going through
[1:31:53] you understand the pain I'm going
[1:31:54] through and more so nobody's not even
[1:31:56] calling and asking me how I'm doing
[1:31:59] remember the prodigal who went after the
[1:32:02] prodigal no Deacon not even the pastor
[1:32:05] called
[1:32:09] him and you know that's people's excuse
[1:32:12] well if he's a pastor he's getting all
[1:32:13] the ties and he's living up why did he
[1:32:15] call me I'm away from the church for so
[1:32:18] many years why are you away from the
[1:32:20] church how did you get there that's
[1:32:22] right
[1:32:24] wasn't it your own free moral agency
[1:32:27] wasn't Adam's free moral agency wasn't
[1:32:30] he's free moral a you don't think God
[1:32:32] know you will make such a mistake but
[1:32:35] don't blame the church for it but thank
[1:32:38] God for
[1:32:40] election thank God for what he knows
[1:32:42] about you and invested in you am that
[1:32:46] one day you're going to come to
[1:32:48] yourself because as long as you're a son
[1:32:50] you must come to yourself I don't care
[1:32:53] how look how far back you would have
[1:32:58] fallen you may be in a backsliding
[1:33:00] condition but a Son of God cannot
[1:33:05] fail because they that are born of God
[1:33:08] cannot
[1:33:10] sin because his
[1:33:13] seed what is the seed the word remain it
[1:33:17] Hallelujah in you not sensation no I'm
[1:33:20] not taking away
[1:33:22] sensation but what com first is the
[1:33:25] word you cannot sin so as long as you're
[1:33:29] a son God with all what you're going
[1:33:31] through will make you come to yourself
[1:33:33] one day and you'll come to realize and
[1:33:36] you'll humble
[1:33:38] yourself like a child I have sinned not
[1:33:42] the church not the pastor you see that's
[1:33:45] the character of a real son but others
[1:33:47] will want to blame somebody else for
[1:33:49] your trouble stop blaming your wife stop
[1:33:51] blaming it's you how you handle the
[1:33:54] situation that God allow you to go
[1:33:56] through are you going to handle it by
[1:33:58] the word and say that by his stripes I'm
[1:34:00] already
[1:34:02] healed stay with the word amen and when
[1:34:05] he came to himself the Bible says he
[1:34:07] repented how many have the character to
[1:34:11] repent he said I will what
[1:34:15] return where Israel
[1:34:19] no Burlington no but to which house
[1:34:24] father my father's house you see what
[1:34:27] Jesus came for to bring us back to the
[1:34:30] father's house because in his house are
[1:34:33] many
[1:34:35] mansions in his house food Gore in his
[1:34:39] house is healing in his Jo is Joy
[1:34:42] Forever More in his house you you you
[1:34:46] cannot die in his house you cannot sin
[1:34:49] in his house you have
[1:34:52] servants and you're not a
[1:34:55] servant but you're a son Hallelujah
[1:34:58] because this Revelation is not for
[1:35:00] servants but it is for sons and he came
[1:35:04] back humbly and he repented
[1:35:07] father I have
[1:35:09] sinned and he said make
[1:35:12] me make me he thought he when he sold
[1:35:16] out that's it there's no
[1:35:19] return a servant he was humbling himself
[1:35:22] but the father already knew he made
[1:35:25] provision by
[1:35:27] predestination by election but his
[1:35:29] brother didn't have that same T about
[1:35:32] him it's like many of us you see a
[1:35:34] brother make a mistake you're ready to
[1:35:37] bury
[1:35:38] him but leave it to God he's testing
[1:35:42] he's proving and if he's a real son he
[1:35:45] will come
[1:35:46] back not by the help of any
[1:35:49] man I know no man your experience is not
[1:35:53] not by any man's hand helping you you
[1:35:56] see too often we are depending on the
[1:35:58] help of man I've made that mistake many
[1:36:00] times that when the church is there you
[1:36:02] have some members and you know they're
[1:36:04] fine and you know they pay good Tiding
[1:36:05] you know the church would be covered and
[1:36:07] everything but then all of a sudden they
[1:36:08] leave I said Lord how are we going to
[1:36:10] make
[1:36:11] out but Christ said I will build my
[1:36:16] church I never left it to you brother Dy
[1:36:19] but I I am the master builder I am the
[1:36:23] Builder yes this is not in your hands
[1:36:26] but it's in the master Builder's hands
[1:36:28] and that master builder has a repetition
[1:36:31] and that repetition is you know uh it is
[1:36:34] his
[1:36:35] name that will be
[1:36:37] questioned so when he had to choose the
[1:36:40] best material for the bridge he knows
[1:36:42] that when the bridge has to be
[1:36:44] commissioned and open if that bridge
[1:36:46] fail his name
[1:36:49] fails and I want you to know anything
[1:36:52] that man Bild will fail
[1:36:55] amen but when the master builder builds
[1:36:59] his name could never
[1:37:01] fail so anytime if Pastor with all due
[1:37:04] respect Simon or your precious Pastor
[1:37:07] now try to build this church rest ass
[1:37:09] sure it's going to
[1:37:12] fail because that's not the man you need
[1:37:14] to
[1:37:15] know but to know him Christ when he
[1:37:20] builds it there's nothing can ever
[1:37:24] destroy that
[1:37:26] bridge and it's not built with any
[1:37:28] ordinary material each and every one of
[1:37:30] you are
[1:37:32] important because you are of no ordinary
[1:37:34] material I don't care how much the color
[1:37:37] of your skin could be dark it could be L
[1:37:40] white God is not looking at that but
[1:37:43] he's looking at that inward man inside
[1:37:46] of you that when the tempter
[1:37:50] comes you're not fighting him based on
[1:37:52] what you know a man but you're fighting
[1:37:54] him based on the word what the word says
[1:37:57] about you get de behind me
[1:38:01] Satan because I didn't come here because
[1:38:04] I wanted to be here but I was
[1:38:06] chosen predestinated you love him okay I
[1:38:09] want to use a quote just to back that up
[1:38:11] a little
[1:38:20] bit from the message marriage and
[1:38:22] divorce night
[1:38:27] 1965 paragraph
[1:38:31] 153
[1:38:35] 162 says
[1:38:38] here and in him was attributes right
[1:38:43] what is an attribute you have heard
[1:38:45] those things in a Pentecostal
[1:38:47] church I'm not you know trying to put
[1:38:50] them down church that's true amen yes
[1:38:54] but this is deeper church because if you
[1:38:56] want this bridge to withstand you have
[1:38:58] to go deep oh and the only way you can
[1:39:01] go deep is not by a man but it has to
[1:39:04] take a profit because the word of God
[1:39:06] first comes not to Pentecostal Church it
[1:39:09] come to
[1:39:11] profit hallelujah amen he said an
[1:39:16] attribute is a
[1:39:17] thought now you'll get something that
[1:39:21] will border on the lesson for tonight he
[1:39:25] was his attributes that was in him now
[1:39:29] it was in him to be
[1:39:34] father amen church that's his attribute
[1:39:37] his Tau it was in him to be God so he
[1:39:41] wasn't God yet but his attribute his
[1:39:44] thought was to be God it was in him to
[1:39:48] be son you think Pentecost going to
[1:39:51] understand this CU they going to call
[1:39:52] this three person
[1:39:55] but it's God's
[1:39:56] attribute are you getting it church it
[1:40:00] was in him to be
[1:40:03] savior it was not in them it was in him
[1:40:07] to be
[1:40:08] healer and all these things here are
[1:40:12] just displaying his
[1:40:14] attributes there is nothing out of
[1:40:19] order now please again not politics I'm
[1:40:22] living in a America there's one
[1:40:24] candidate saying he's going to make it
[1:40:26] great
[1:40:27] again cuz he feels it's not
[1:40:30] good but I want you to know nothing is
[1:40:34] out of order
[1:40:35] am it's just displaying his
[1:40:39] attribute now he could not be just and
[1:40:44] make a man to fall he had to put him on
[1:40:48] equal basis of free moral agent
[1:40:53] so God doesn't force you to
[1:40:55] believe it's a choice Hallelujah to make
[1:41:00] his own choice now you got to make a
[1:41:03] choice to come to this church to be a
[1:41:04] member of this church nobody could force
[1:41:06] you church if anybody does it's of a
[1:41:09] man but as Believers we ought to know no
[1:41:12] man the only way you're supposed to be
[1:41:14] here is because he led you
[1:41:17] here and he knows he will have pastors
[1:41:20] here after his own heart so you have to
[1:41:23] first amen ask God for discernment that
[1:41:26] these pastors are men after God's heart
[1:41:30] he didn't give you a
[1:41:32] tape he said I'll give you
[1:41:35] pastors a tape can't bury you a tape
[1:41:38] can't marry you with all due respect
[1:41:40] Church a tape is not a person it's an
[1:41:44] instrument it's a mechanical instrument
[1:41:46] he didn't say I will give you mechanics
[1:41:49] I'll give you the Dynamics and the
[1:41:51] Dynamics is the Holy Ghost of
[1:41:55] operating Hallelujah a bodily mechanic
[1:41:59] but it's not your pastor it's the Holy
[1:42:01] Ghost amen but knowing he would
[1:42:07] fall now he can be a savior
[1:42:11] unless something is lost he can't be a
[1:42:15] Healer unless something is
[1:42:18] sick these things has to be that way now
[1:42:22] before there was ever any
[1:42:24] sickness as what happened in the garden
[1:42:26] God already
[1:42:27] knew that's why he wanted to be a savior
[1:42:30] and a Healer so you don't think he
[1:42:33] already know what is going on right now
[1:42:36] in your life what is happening right now
[1:42:38] in Canada he already knows it and he
[1:42:41] already has a
[1:42:43] plan so don't worry brother Christianity
[1:42:47] is AR
[1:42:48] rest it's not fussing Church believe his
[1:42:52] word God made them thus so that his
[1:42:55] great attribute could be displayed if
[1:42:58] there wasn't that he had never been a
[1:43:02] savior but we know he was even before
[1:43:07] there was a time he was a savior now
[1:43:11] scientists are trying to say the Earth
[1:43:12] is so many billion years old before the
[1:43:14] billions God was already a
[1:43:16] savior do they know that no could
[1:43:18] Pentecost teach that to you it had to
[1:43:22] take son of man God himself to go all
[1:43:26] the way back before time now Moses wrote
[1:43:28] the first four or five books in the go
[1:43:30] in Genesis but not even
[1:43:33] Moses could have given this
[1:43:36] Revelation because it was
[1:43:39] reserved right for Revelation
[1:43:43] 107 it was reserved for Malachi 4
[1:43:48] 56 and thank God we are the
[1:43:51] manifestation
[1:43:53] Hallelujah of such a
[1:43:55] revelation that we are living in the
[1:43:58] greatest time in our
[1:44:00] life in the best time of our life so
[1:44:03] regardless what comes church we are
[1:44:06] privileged to have such a
[1:44:09] revelation is it by sensation now again
[1:44:12] I'm not against sensation but it's by
[1:44:15] the
[1:44:16] word hallelujah he was a savior so there
[1:44:19] has to be something
[1:44:21] lost how
[1:44:23] is it going to be if he takes and loses
[1:44:28] it just in order to save it then it
[1:44:32] isn't Justice to his judgment he
[1:44:36] couldn't send a man to hell and be
[1:44:40] just he is kind gentle true honest and
[1:44:44] he is a great judge
[1:44:48] see he would be working against himself
[1:44:52] so so he had to put man out here and
[1:44:56] make him on free moral agency so he
[1:45:01] would
[1:45:01] [Applause]
[1:45:03] knowing would fall and the man in his
[1:45:06] own image how could he fall now you
[1:45:12] seeing
[1:45:14] daylight so he had to make a
[1:45:18] byproduct something out of the original
[1:45:21] creation now you see it see there you
[1:45:26] come then that's what
[1:45:30] fell not the original but the byproduct
[1:45:34] he made it knowing it will it would
[1:45:37] fall and it put over in the hands of
[1:45:41] Satan for a vessel of Dishonor now you
[1:45:45] know the Bible talks about there are
[1:45:46] vessels in a home some to honor and some
[1:45:49] to dishonor amen are you getting it now
[1:45:53] the very one that was made to dishonor
[1:45:55] was made by
[1:45:57] God could you tell God how to do his
[1:46:00] work but in order to fulfill the
[1:46:03] attribute of him being a savior being a
[1:46:07] redeemer he had to beat Satan on his
[1:46:11] CR because he allows Satan to take that
[1:46:16] one the byproduct you love him
[1:46:20] s where is honor bestowed today you
[1:46:25] think on
[1:46:27] that then again why she was designed
[1:46:30] this way and not like other females now
[1:46:33] you say does God have something against
[1:46:37] women why she was designed that way you
[1:46:41] see unless you understand what was in
[1:46:43] the mind of God that's right you would
[1:46:45] want to think that God is
[1:46:48] unjust well oh that's why the men you
[1:46:50] know they could get away with a lot of
[1:46:52] things but we will and everything is on
[1:46:53] us and us is always the woman the woman
[1:46:55] the
[1:46:56] woman but it took two Elizabeth and Mary
[1:47:01] to bring the Christ
[1:47:04] child one by sensation but brought the
[1:47:08] Baptist and one by the spoken word
[1:47:11] brought the Christ child and here come
[1:47:14] the devil if thou be he never went to
[1:47:16] John and sa th
[1:47:19] be but he went to the one that was born
[1:47:22] by the word
[1:47:24] so he knows church that when you are
[1:47:26] born by the word you are more than a Mr
[1:47:29] and mistress daily you're a Son of God
[1:47:32] so this morning even though your
[1:47:34] identity may be whatever name your name
[1:47:36] God is looking beyond that and the devil
[1:47:39] is hunting down to find out if you are
[1:47:41] one of them and the day he gets to know
[1:47:43] you are one of them he's coming after
[1:47:44] you but God has equipped
[1:47:48] you with the word of the hour that when
[1:47:51] he comes you don't fight him base on the
[1:47:53] strength of the church but you fight
[1:47:54] them on the basis of the
[1:47:57] word so here he says why was the woman
[1:48:01] designed so and not other
[1:48:05] females none of the other females was
[1:48:08] designed like that they are not today
[1:48:12] they can't nothing being made that way
[1:48:16] she can't do it why did he not make this
[1:48:19] female then a woman just like other
[1:48:22] females so she would just be the same
[1:48:26] way could just raise her babies then she
[1:48:30] would have her husband and live and when
[1:48:33] it comes time for her baby she would
[1:48:36] have her hus her baby why did he make
[1:48:40] her like this I can't say the he said I
[1:48:44] can't say these words and you understand
[1:48:47] what I'm trying what I'm talking about
[1:48:51] don't you if you can
[1:48:53] understand say amen he says there is
[1:48:57] young girls sitting here and young boys
[1:49:02] but you know the animal has to come to a
[1:49:06] certain time of the
[1:49:09] year then her mate then that's all you
[1:49:12] know what he means by that yes sir all
[1:49:14] right there's what you call a period of
[1:49:16] you know when the animals uh there's
[1:49:19] that season for you know reproduction
[1:49:24] that's only time the male and the female
[1:49:26] come together it is by a
[1:49:28] season an appointed season Hallelujah
[1:49:33] and God have made them in such a way
[1:49:34] that's the only time they come together
[1:49:36] but not for
[1:49:38] sensation but just the ACT to bring
[1:49:41] another cat or another dog amen but a
[1:49:45] woman it's
[1:49:48] anytime and why did he make her like
[1:49:52] that
[1:49:53] now watch his great program unfold now
[1:49:57] you know brother Bron had about a fifth
[1:49:59] grade education you understand about
[1:50:01] these things amen now you expect
[1:50:04] Einstein should have known that but this
[1:50:06] is not for Einstein church we are not in
[1:50:10] no science class we're in a holy ghost
[1:50:13] class only the Holy Ghost could reveal
[1:50:16] these things to you as we go on through
[1:50:19] here now just a perfect as perfect can
[1:50:22] be
[1:50:23] I didn't know this till the other day
[1:50:26] this is
[1:50:30] 1965 now brother BR is coming to know
[1:50:32] why God made a woman the way she's
[1:50:34] made say I didn't know now how did he
[1:50:37] know that by
[1:50:38] intellect but it's what that Spirit Lord
[1:50:42] have shown him that through all the ages
[1:50:45] they could have never got that
[1:50:47] Revelation so we're not against women
[1:50:49] church because you here this morning is
[1:50:51] more than just a woman amen you are the
[1:50:55] bride nobody's forcing you to dress the
[1:50:58] way you dress and don't cut your hair
[1:50:59] and don't wear makeup and all of these
[1:51:01] things nobody's forcing you have a free
[1:51:03] moral agency but why you do what you do
[1:51:06] by
[1:51:08] Revelation Hallelujah you come to
[1:51:11] understand you and him are one the
[1:51:14] material that he is is the same material
[1:51:16] in you and if his material is saying it
[1:51:19] is written man shall not live by bread
[1:51:21] alone but by every word you will say
[1:51:26] Amen glj Mary said I know no man no man
[1:51:30] could give you this
[1:51:32] Revelation Peter how you know he is a
[1:51:34] Christ he said Flesh and Blood have not
[1:51:36] revealed that to you not even your
[1:51:38] father Peter but Hallelujah my
[1:51:41] father oh Hallelujah so you're not a
[1:51:45] daughter of a Canadian but you're a
[1:51:47] daughter of the supernatural amen the
[1:51:50] heavenlies
[1:51:54] so you dressing the way you're dressing
[1:51:56] is not because the church said so you're
[1:51:58] dressing because you're a part of the
[1:52:01] word hallelujah Church look around us is
[1:52:05] Darkness we're not talking about the
[1:52:07] sunlight but just look at the condition
[1:52:09] of character of people today and brother
[1:52:12] say you want to know what condition the
[1:52:13] country is in don't look at the
[1:52:15] economics don't look at the border but
[1:52:17] look at our
[1:52:19] women look at the morals of The Country
[1:52:21] Church that is showing you where are we
[1:52:24] living right now in Satan's Eden why a
[1:52:28] woman have to dress with not short pants
[1:52:30] now it is so
[1:52:31] short church that if you don't have the
[1:52:34] spirit of Christ in you you will fall to
[1:52:36] you know we are
[1:52:39] men we have a free moral
[1:52:41] agency we have daughters we have sons we
[1:52:44] would try to tell them it is wrong to go
[1:52:46] to school like that but there's what you
[1:52:47] call peer
[1:52:49] pressure free moral agency so you can't
[1:52:53] do it but the
[1:52:55] promise is unto
[1:52:57] you Acts
[1:52:59] 2:38 it's unto you and to your children
[1:53:03] and to those as many as the Lord God
[1:53:05] shall call so you have a right you don't
[1:53:07] have power but you have
[1:53:09] authority to claim the promises of God
[1:53:12] God don't let my daughter go that way
[1:53:15] don't let my son go that way because I'm
[1:53:17] applying the
[1:53:19] token for my home
[1:53:23] you have the promis
[1:53:25] Saints brother you don't have the power
[1:53:29] but he has the power but you have
[1:53:32] authority because you're a son yes you
[1:53:35] have authority so don't sit there as
[1:53:37] though you can't do
[1:53:40] nothing the Bible says whatever you say
[1:53:44] yes on you don't even have to pray you
[1:53:47] see your son or your daughter in that
[1:53:49] condition speak to that condition
[1:53:51] Hallelujah Lord you have given me the
[1:53:53] authority speak to your wife speak to
[1:53:56] your husband because you're speaking
[1:53:59] Standing On Solid
[1:54:01] Ground you're standing as a Son of God
[1:54:05] and as long whatever you say he said I
[1:54:07] will back it
[1:54:08] up so don't worry the word has come it
[1:54:13] has made you know now by inheritance who
[1:54:15] you really are amen so when the tempter
[1:54:18] comes you don't use your power you use
[1:54:20] the word amen because the word has given
[1:54:23] me a promise you say it to any
[1:54:26] mountain and as long as you believe it
[1:54:28] in your heart God will bring it to
[1:54:31] pass look all the other church members
[1:54:34] will make you feel bad about your son or
[1:54:36] daughter because they don't have the
[1:54:38] Holy Spirit Well if you're a son if
[1:54:40] you're a pastor you know you're a Son of
[1:54:43] God how come your wife is dressing like
[1:54:44] that she has a free moral
[1:54:47] agency I can't force her cu the more you
[1:54:50] force them is the more stubborn they
[1:54:54] get but Brother D what are we going to
[1:54:56] do do what he tell you to do only
[1:55:00] believe all things are possible to them
[1:55:04] that
[1:55:05] believe you speak the word it may take
[1:55:07] 10 years for them to change but God will
[1:55:10] honor that
[1:55:11] word he promised Abraham he didn't say
[1:55:14] you'll get the son immediately took 25
[1:55:16] years but Abraham against hope he
[1:55:19] believe in hope everybody else around
[1:55:22] you might say your son can't change your
[1:55:23] daughter can't change but be a true
[1:55:25] Abraham seed said against hope I'm going
[1:55:28] to believe for my son I'm going to
[1:55:30] believe for my daughter because I know I
[1:55:33] am a Son of
[1:55:35] God
[1:55:36] Amen don't wait for the church to change
[1:55:39] your wife or change your
[1:55:40] children this is of no
[1:55:43] man but only God and God
[1:55:46] Alone can do that church and it's not
[1:55:49] just God it's your
[1:55:51] father because the father was in the son
[1:55:53] he said I and my father are so let the
[1:55:56] devil know Hallelujah you are a son and
[1:55:58] you're the father the Holy Ghost are
[1:56:02] one and you have the promise because
[1:56:05] this is according to God's attribute you
[1:56:07] love him saints of
[1:56:09] God
[1:56:11] Amen so look what he says
[1:56:13] here now watch his great program
[1:56:17] unfold we go on there through here now
[1:56:21] just as perfect
[1:56:22] can be I don't know this till the other
[1:56:26] day why did he make her like that in the
[1:56:31] beginning like the rest of the females
[1:56:35] because it would be Unbecoming to him he
[1:56:39] is the Fountain of all Purity that's the
[1:56:43] reason he had to let Satan get a hold of
[1:56:48] her so Eve didn't fall because she
[1:56:51] wanted to to fall but in order for God's
[1:56:55] attribute to be made manifest there had
[1:56:58] to be a fall so you have to make
[1:57:01] something to make that fall come so when
[1:57:05] Satan comes Hallelujah she's a
[1:57:08] byproduct she's not the word and I want
[1:57:12] you to know you're not a
[1:57:13] byproduct you are the
[1:57:16] word hallelujah you're no byproduct
[1:57:19] Church you know they say women like to
[1:57:21] byproduct
[1:57:25] so when the man go out they said let us
[1:57:26] go to the mall he stays in the car let
[1:57:29] her walk
[1:57:31] around they'll love to buy products
[1:57:35] hallelujah amen but please I'm not
[1:57:37] saying you
[1:57:38] sisters amen I know you're good sisters
[1:57:41] amen you'll support him Hallelujah but
[1:57:43] that's That's what Satan and His World
[1:57:45] all right praise be to God so we see
[1:57:49] here that's the reason he had to let
[1:57:51] Satan get a hold of her what he done in
[1:57:55] the perversion such a creature would be
[1:57:58] would not be becoming to him originally
[1:58:01] designed for all his works that he
[1:58:04] designed in the original is in
[1:58:08] continuity all of his original work was
[1:58:11] in continuity the female dog the male
[1:58:14] dog see female cow the male cow
[1:58:18] everything in continuity all nature is
[1:58:21] in continuity seed die go into the
[1:58:24] ground just like death burial
[1:58:26] Resurrection amen the sap goes down out
[1:58:29] of a tree drops in its Leaf come back
[1:58:32] the next year with the resurrection of a
[1:58:35] new Leaf see what I meant mean
[1:58:39] everything even nature of God is all in
[1:58:44] continuity in one and here is one
[1:58:47] designed out of the continuity of God
[1:58:50] nature is so designed so it can't
[1:58:55] sin think the original creation of God
[1:59:01] could not sin you see
[1:59:04] Church why today A boy is saying I'm not
[1:59:07] a
[1:59:09] boy and a girl is saying I'm not a girl
[1:59:12] and then the schools are being pressured
[1:59:15] yes Amen to accept that as the norm
[1:59:21] could you imagine and you look at nature
[1:59:24] the cat never say want to be a
[1:59:28] dog for thousands of years they're a
[1:59:32] cat the dog the
[1:59:34] same and they don't have a
[1:59:37] soul they were not made in the image of
[1:59:40] God but why
[1:59:44] man see the
[1:59:46] prsion but what is going
[1:59:49] to correct that perversion
[1:59:53] no man could do it but the word amen so
[1:59:57] this is why we stand where we stand not
[2:00:00] because of the church but the word has
[2:00:02] been restored amen not in just
[2:00:08] portions you see Pentecost had it in
[2:00:11] portions but we have it in the
[2:00:15] fullness when that angel shall begin to
[2:00:19] sng the
[2:00:20] mystery of God should be finished church
[2:00:25] we have nothing to make an
[2:00:27] excuse that we can overcome this
[2:00:31] generation God had to allow a generation
[2:00:33] like this to come to prove there is a
[2:00:36] people yes there is a bride yes there is
[2:00:40] a church that has
[2:00:43] reputation not preach the Gospel
[2:00:45] Tabernacle not the good neighbors but
[2:00:49] the Lord
[2:00:50] Jesus I will build my church yes sir and
[2:00:53] the Gates of Hell could never Prevail
[2:00:57] against it why not because of sensation
[2:01:00] we believe in it but more than
[2:01:04] sensation we are not Elizabeth's
[2:01:09] type but we are Mary's
[2:01:13] type because even Zachariah
[2:01:17] doubted and God made him
[2:01:20] dumb Elizabeth couldn't understand how
[2:01:24] could this be but Mary a little virgin
[2:01:27] said be it unto me I need no sensation
[2:01:31] to believe this message so not because
[2:01:34] you never fell you never fall down you
[2:01:36] said pastor I want to have an experience
[2:01:38] because if I don't I'm not making it in
[2:01:39] the
[2:01:41] Rapture who told you
[2:01:44] so there are many going to fall down
[2:01:46] there are many going to shout many going
[2:01:47] to scream I'm not against it but many
[2:01:50] will miss it because they think that's
[2:01:52] the
[2:01:53] evidence but the evidence is when you
[2:01:55] can
[2:01:56] receive the revealed
[2:02:00] word the light for your day Church it is
[2:02:03] so simple now I'm not saying that
[2:02:06] because you say you believe you already
[2:02:07] have it you got to be proven you got to
[2:02:10] be tried you got to be tested sickness
[2:02:13] will come what about it's all his
[2:02:16] attributes but deep in your soul nothing
[2:02:19] will make you
[2:02:20] quit you're not a critter amen you're an
[2:02:30] overcomer so it's not the church that
[2:02:32] makes you what you are you are what you
[2:02:35] are because of
[2:02:37] predestination look even if this church
[2:02:41] has to fall
[2:02:42] apart you
[2:02:44] can't thank you Lord you know why
[2:02:47] because you are
[2:02:48] here and this church can't fall apart as
[2:02:50] long as you are here
[2:02:52] amen amen amen do you think it's your
[2:02:57] pastor cuz you know why you are
[2:02:59] predestinated to your
[2:03:01] destination so if God has to preserve
[2:03:04] this church because of
[2:03:05] you you must get to your predes that
[2:03:08] your predestinated
[2:03:11] destination Hallelujah so even though
[2:03:13] the church May close it has to open back
[2:03:16] because when you
[2:03:18] pray God will give your pastor Revival
[2:03:22] he will give the church Revival
[2:03:24] Hallelujah all because you are here you
[2:03:26] got to be
[2:03:27] fed you got to be nurtured because God
[2:03:30] is looking at you to make the
[2:03:32] destination so there's no way this
[2:03:34] church could fall apart as long as you
[2:03:36] are
[2:03:38] here and there's no way this world could
[2:03:40] fall apart until the bride
[2:03:44] leaves I don't care whether if it's
[2:03:47] conservative or liberal that has nothing
[2:03:50] to do with your Destin
[2:03:52] Nation so what is holding America I'm
[2:03:55] one of
[2:03:58] them does the Democrats know that does
[2:04:01] the Republicans know that but you know
[2:04:04] it Canada can't fall apart Because of
[2:04:08] You does truda know it does the
[2:04:11] opposition no but God knows it because
[2:04:14] in his eternal thoughts he taught of you
[2:04:18] and nothing could happen until you come
[2:04:20] to know
[2:04:22] who you are and you get out of here you
[2:04:25] love him
[2:04:26] Saints all right I know time is going I
[2:04:28] have to close glory be to
[2:04:31] God I'm going to read one more quote
[2:04:33] here from the message God's only
[2:04:36] provided place of worship
[2:04:39] 1965 and here brother R
[2:04:43] says he had in his heart before the
[2:04:46] foundation of the world a
[2:04:49] son think of it
[2:04:52] before there was even a star a molecule
[2:04:54] look right now the not only the Hubble
[2:04:56] telescope but the web they've gone so
[2:04:59] far they're
[2:05:02] exploring planets and galaxies that
[2:05:05] never ice could have seen before but God
[2:05:08] is beyond all of
[2:05:10] that he's beyond all of that church all
[2:05:14] space and
[2:05:15] time is filled with him you see how
[2:05:18] great he is yes and if you're are a part
[2:05:20] of him who do you think you are you
[2:05:22] think Canada has a place to hold
[2:05:25] you that's that's what we are Church you
[2:05:28] know what we are valued brother says we
[2:05:31] have valued more than 10 what thousand
[2:05:33] worlds could could you calculate
[2:05:35] that Jeff bezo is Rich Elon Musk is Rich
[2:05:39] this said 1927 he will be a trillionaire
[2:05:42] and everybody oh I wish I could be his
[2:05:49] cousin man
[2:05:52] man knowing a man but when you come to
[2:05:55] know your God you come to know what you
[2:05:58] where you come from you come to know how
[2:06:00] rich he is I don't care what's the color
[2:06:02] of your skin nobody could value what you
[2:06:06] are
[2:06:08] worth and only this message could have
[2:06:11] brought us to such a
[2:06:15] reality there's no
[2:06:17] money that could buy
[2:06:20] me they offered brother BR Millions but
[2:06:23] he returned
[2:06:24] it because he doesn't want to be a billy
[2:06:27] grar or all Roberts with all their big
[2:06:29] he said look
[2:06:31] up look up look at all the stars and all
[2:06:35] the heavens they belong to
[2:06:37] me and because you have chosen the hard
[2:06:42] way many of us as immigrants we come
[2:06:44] from the hard countries is that so
[2:06:46] Brother D is one of them and we come to
[2:06:49] North America because we want this soft
[2:06:52] way but remember Peter said be
[2:06:55] vigilant the devil is like a roaring
[2:06:58] lion seeking to devour so we can't be
[2:07:02] drunk at this time church we can't be
[2:07:05] sleeping at this time the hour is later
[2:07:07] than we think the knowledge of this
[2:07:09] world is foolishness with God so you're
[2:07:12] not known by your education and your
[2:07:14] degrees but you're known by
[2:07:17] Revelation who you really are you might
[2:07:19] be living in a basement don't don't
[2:07:21] don't say God I could have deserved
[2:07:25] better than this but if only he can open
[2:07:27] your eyes to see what you belong
[2:07:29] to one day you're going to be translated
[2:07:32] hallelujah thank you Lord from this
[2:07:34] terrestrial prise lordes to the
[2:07:36] celestial
[2:07:38] church and there's no rocket can take
[2:07:40] you
[2:07:41] there there's no man-made power that can
[2:07:43] take you there there's only one
[2:07:46] power that's the Holy
[2:07:48] Ghost and power that is keeping as alive
[2:07:52] you love him saints of God so you're not
[2:07:55] here you know to know well how could
[2:07:57] brother da make me richer I can't church
[2:08:00] but you're here to hear the truth amen
[2:08:02] and the truth is you were elected you
[2:08:05] were chosen even regardless of your
[2:08:08] mistakes God knows your heart and he has
[2:08:11] chosen you to predestinate you to this
[2:08:13] destination Hallelujah you love him
[2:08:15] saints of God so don't complain about
[2:08:18] the church don't complain about the
[2:08:20] pastor Hallelujah

[2:08:25] Lord open my ears open my eyes that I
[2:08:30] can see who I really
[2:08:33] am a Son of God and that's what the
[2:08:36] devil came if thou be I'm asking what
[2:08:39] membership Church you are but if thou be
[2:08:41] the Son of God command these students I
[2:08:45] know you're hungry I know you're weak
[2:08:47] but he said look I'm not living by bread
[2:08:49] but I'm living by every word
[2:08:52] so this bride is not just about
[2:08:54] sensation she's about every
[2:08:57] word that's the Revelation that's the
[2:09:00] evidence that you have the Holy Ghost
[2:09:03] because you can have sensation you can
[2:09:04] speak in tongues and still deny the word
[2:09:08] amen they will have a woman preacher
[2:09:10] they will have the women wearing their
[2:09:11] pants they will have the women wearing
[2:09:13] their makeup they will have them wearing
[2:09:14] their lipsti they will have them cut in
[2:09:15] their and they are Bishop when Paul say

[2:09:36] Revelation that's by
[2:09:38] man that's by law but this is not a law
[2:09:41] church this is a revelation you don't do
[2:09:45] it because you afraid that they will

[2:10:27] dust of the earth he didn't settle for
[2:10:30] that he started making man again he made
[2:10:35] an Noah he died drunk he made a Moses
[2:10:40] that failed to keep his word he made
[2:10:44] prophets that run in the time of trouble
[2:10:48] and he kept building and holding until
[2:10:52] after a while he wanted a
[2:10:55] masterpiece to reflect
[2:10:57] him his nature what was in his heart was
[2:11:02] a
[2:11:04] son what a son should be one day down at
[2:11:09] Jordan after that
[2:11:12] Masterpiece had been formed and made

[2:11:20] wings of of a dove said this is him he
[2:11:26] was so ined with his this masterpiece

[2:11:35] time of your
[2:11:37] life you know when everybody following

[2:11:53] mess that he would die for the rest of
[2:11:57] us that's imperfect that through this
[2:12:01] shedding of his blood he might bring
[2:12:04] many
