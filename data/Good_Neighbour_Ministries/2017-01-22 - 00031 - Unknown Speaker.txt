TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen hallelujah it's true the brick is manmade am the stone is unshaped natural it's just natural but the main point is on shaped uh but let me make a point here a preacher a a stone Mason can quickly put up a wall with bricks mhm because they're already all of them the same size it's uniform right they have their fundamentals this is how Christian should be that's and everything you got to fit within that goal you know that you know when you make we been carp BL so I know Chris understand what I'm talking about every sit in the M every one is the same right so he knows that when he grabs put grab puts it there the measurements the same everything the same everything like that the same like that and he can quickly and swiftly put it up but the that's the reason why because bricks are all identical they're all identical but when you see raw Stones they're of different shapes they're of different size they're of different color yes and the stone Mason just can't go and grab and put on the wall he's got to pick up the stone and then he's got to evaluate it he's got to look at that stone carefully uh to know exactly how to chip is that right you know when I was in Israel the guy was telling me there when he has those diamonds behind of course a thick bulletproof B but he was telling me you know that you know his job asked him about his job he says every ship of that of that of that diamond you got he says sometimes you they can take a day or two days looking at di that Diamond walking around the diamond looking at it through the microscope before they even put a chisel or whatever to it because you don't want it to break in a certain way you want it to go exactly the way you wanted to go you don't want to spoil the beauty of the diamond you don't want to damage that believer's life uh by some pastoral abusive uh uh you know Behavior or something like that are you following me praise the Lord you want to chip it exactly the way God wants iten hallelujah amen bringing it naturally discipline your child without breaking the child's spirit it's the same thing I'm trying to say here you can discipline the child without breaking the child's spirit see so this is important we understand that the same thing goes you need a stone Mason brother says that quoting him just these things just comeing to me here where he says he says when you you you you repent and you come to Christ you said you're nothing but a stone rolled out of the gter you need a stone Mason to chip of the C amen and Shake you that you find your place in the body of Christ amen a lot of people get that problem because they don't want to submit themselves to a St me all right because it's painful somebody Ching away do is not an easy stuff right going be very painful stuff that you love that chip away this part you think was nice chip away and so it becomes very painful Pro procedure as it is amen so he's start to chip it to see how it will fit in and Chip it and shape it to fit and uh finally when he's done of course people start to declare oh my Believers from that church my God they're a work of art hallelujah amen let me feel good tonight brother that amen Paul said let me be a fool he said let me boast a little a preacher met um some Believers from this church um and said to me he said oh oh my God I met Believers from your church and if the rest in your church and never met a church with so many I would have never met a church with so many people like that in one place I have to come and see that myself amen amen so that preacher has to come here because you can't believe it right he just can't believe it praise the Lord amen so I I just thank the Lord I just say thank you brother appreciate that uh very very much it's encouraging amen amen cuz you're slugging away slugging away year after year getting dirt M everything at you you know and all kinds of stuff and and sometimes you're human sometimes you think what am I doing this for you know the devil come play with your mind what am I doing this for you know I really don't need to take this I'm old now maybe I should just sit them and rest that right but I heard a voice behind me say I sat down to rest from feet gr but then I Heard a Voice me say you got to keep on walking keep right on walk Walking in the light of the Lord you'll get to heaven somay if you walk the right way walking in the light of the Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus I I have two more minutes and I'm going to use it it's not 9:00 yet so you can't start uh saying anything pray for amen and so we are all different and God gives us different [Music] talents diversities of gifts that's why when he drew the p every part of it is a different color and that color types the rainbow and then if you follow that up and want to preach a message you gone into Joseph coat of many colors and then you gone to the angel of the Covenant the same rainbow and you can go on and on it's always featured that way because praise the name of the Lord God loves variety amen doesn't love the same mess that's right like we seen the denomination they have to come cut right out of their lurgical book or they got their fundamental statements of faith and everything and you got to fit within those certain boundaries or you're not one of them you've got to you see God loves that variety uh there so here we find of we've got diverse talents diverse abilities diverse personality and then God in his uh in his wisdom will bring certain opportunities to you that he will bring to me amen because I don't have the talent to seize those opportunities amen you have the talent God will open that kind of opportunity for you glory to God and you seize the opportunity praise the Lord hallelujah amen you don't hesitate I wonder if God want no you don't have to wonder I mean an e see fresh me don't wonder just grab some tears amen because that's the way it's me praise the Lord he who hesitates is lost you don't hesitate you just seize the opportunity for God's glory and for his honor amen listen so we do you understand I'm talking about here tonight you your body is housing the mystery amen amen you are housing the mystery praise God we who were lost and undone God redeemed us changed us amen hallelujah hallelujah because our ancestors Sinn he couldn't give us a virgin born body m is that right like he did for himself but the next best thing he could do after Satan God had doomed the whole human race condemnation by adamic representation he turned the th around praise the Lord by the shedding of his blood and redeemed Us by the blood so that he can house himself in redeemed flesh today amen redeem how I love to Proclaim it redeem by the blood of L redeem through his infinite Mercy his child and forever I am glory to God hallelujah listen to Ephesians 5:30 we are his body not just his house not not just his family not not just that but we are his body the amen we are the members of his body we are members of his body now that you're catching some glimpse of it now you going to see all the scriptures lighting up all his flesh amen and his b what's it telling you we are now his special B right right we are now not talking about Jesus back there the devil already Tri they looking back there got paintings of of the head that was just the head and they paint that and they they just look into that and not realizing why they're looking there something's going on down here is that right and here it is we are we are his flesh amen and of his b praise God do you know um what they call genuine royalty do you know a terminology for genuine royalty he or she is of true B that is the term for royalty Now read it back in the Bible and understand what he's trying to tell you right in there we are his flesh and of his b you are a true B amen you are true genuine royalty Kings and Priests of God blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah let me just stop there for tonight I'm just halfway through going us stop on this teaching praise the name of the Lord you say brother Simon why would you continue on you can spend another two hours and Believers will appreciate it well I know that you'll appreciate the revelation of it but your body won't amen praise the name of the Lord look we have enough to deal with am with the stress factor in this world over all the other ages this age has more stress amen just driving your car what press you are I'm telling you I'm not kiding the devil will send off you say I'm a good driver that's nothing to do the devil will send all kind of people stop in front of you they come beside you they'll even give you a wicked grin and drive up and drive whatever like that so our lives are in God's hand is not can drive or or or this or that you got to place your life in the hands of God we live in that age where most stressful age and remember once the devil start to get a hint of who you are he's going to start to pull up out the tricks and that's right right he's going to pull Tricks and Treats on you and pull you around here put you around there so at the end of every week every everybody that goes to a job will feel like they're washed out I'm telling you but the fact is if your job is so fantastic so good or whatever you you anxious to get back on your job why do they have to have no work on Saturday I want to go in nobody talks like that if they have to that's right nobody goes in but the reason why because of consciously the devil is clawing at us as Believers and tearing at you trying to do everything he can in other words I know you're going to make it there now because water the blood but I'm going to make it like hell here you're on my my turf I'm going to make my head and he's going to do his best so you got all that to deal with and then you got to come in the house of God and then you got to go to hell and back you got to go back see see after we finish all this preaching and the Hallelujah and the shouting you got to come right back with come to reality and realize that you you got to go back to your job and this work you have to to there and that's why I try to stick as much as I can to this time frame amen that's the reason why I do that not because I can't preach long I can preach an hour two more hours and we can go on sh Hallelujah but then you're going to have to wake up tomorrow morning early and go to your workout sleepy and everything else and and that's not going to be good all right so so you understand what I'm doing amen and it's not because I want GL um preaching the word to you but especially in the middle of the week there are these concerns the same holy spirit that told me years ago have one service on Sunday when when I had the only Mage Church in Toronto at the time have one service on Sunday cuz what I was F have two services and the sisters with unsaved husbands family getting Frid there is anger there is argument there is this and the Holy Spirit said no they have to have time with their family too they got to have time to prepare for their work get their children ready have go on service amen and even if it's long when it's ended they can go and do whatever they can do so I instituted that back then and um it's been working till today and it's the same way the holy spirit says now before you can preach as long as you want when I'm in Africa of course I can preach as long as they want me to preach I they sit there all day I'm not move and I'm already washed out but the fact is here um you preach the word and then I let you go because that's the time frame and you need to be out and do whatever you have to do God bless you I kep you 10 minutes so you can uh find me shall we our word prayer [Music] godes him Simplicity and he reveals himself in the s yes sir you you brother BR said when you look what do you see you see what you're looking for he said if you if I send you to the barn to get me a hammer and you don't know what it is you can go there and kick it and don't know what you're picking up so you got to have the Revelation and the understanding and the wisdom of God I'm not talking about knowing the message you don't have to mentally know the message as he said I wash a woman in the woods c one Revelation and the whole thing begins to open up when preaching begin to preach all of a sudden she start to understand but he is that wisdom father we thank you tonight for the spirit and the anointing that is upon me and upon your people here opening up the eyes of the understanding of the heart and we pray that the word of God will take root and grow and and stabilize their foundations and their character that we truly will be the house of God this we ask in jesus' name amen take us safely to our homes protect us on the road from the from the weather and from the the people that are out there take us safely and bless us on our jobs and prosper us on our way as brother Brandon said I wish you a bless a new year full of blessings spiritually physically financially and materially happy New Year so let it be with everyone here tonight in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you all it's okay brother you don't need to leave him in a closing him or anything uh we are dismissed Lord bless you just greet one another and we'll see each other again on Sunday
