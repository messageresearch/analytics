[0:00] go back to the old history you will see
[0:04] that when God wanted to deal with people
[0:06] the people of Israel and he go into all
[0:10] the different churches and say okay if
[0:12] you start to say that who starts a
[0:14] 90-second no he goes he says Farrell
[0:19] it's time that my people are going to
[0:22] get set free and I'm going to teach what
[0:24] they're not the oldest one that you
[0:26] brought up with me
[0:28] that's how God works and he calls Moses
[0:31] and those who the spirit Moses want to
[0:34] assess that wasn't posted that was Moses
[0:43] that's like you and me the part of us
[0:46] twenty-five years ago I walked into my
[0:49] family
[0:55] [Music]
[1:02] [Music]
[1:17] [Music]
[1:31] so in 1906 there was a man who was born
[1:35] into this world prepared that life
[1:39] brought a message that was going to
[1:42] liberate and you go back and stuck it
[1:44] and you do an actual study on it there
[1:47] is absolutely no way that it happened
[1:51] exactly the way that it all happened to
[1:53] help
[1:54] there's just too much to talk about that
[1:56] but it is what God was doing in the
[1:59] compression of the order and that's why
[2:02] we have the activation because you know
[2:05] since I've talked with ministers I've
[2:08] set to talk to them for for you know
[2:10] four hours we do the word of introducing
[2:13] what seminary to come like the beginning
[2:19] the whole structure like that and start
[2:22] talking to the bringing revelation
[2:24] Genesis to Revelation and tied the word
[2:27] together this no 27 this is the Holy
[2:33] Ghost
[2:35] they wondered why and what is that it's
[2:41] not really himself to an individual
[2:45] he took Paul it's all the Bible the New
[2:49] Testament when God takes an individual
[2:51] now Paul was a theologian filled with
[2:54] all kinds of teachings of God God says
[2:57] go to the desert I'll meet you there
[2:59] you know he was taking them to the
[3:01] desert for to take all of that theology
[3:04] out of it the cleanup a lot of I was
[3:08] only speaking native tradition what
[3:10] mommy said that that isn't in the preset
[3:12] what this was - no this is not even
[3:14] gonna speak you to get a preach my word
[3:17] we're gonna see what mother bird says
[3:19] because that's the only way I can honor
[3:21] my word to stand behind it and so he
[3:24] received the Holy Ghost
[3:25] Paul had received the Holy Ghost of the
[3:28] digna that he was riding on a big horse
[3:30] there and think he's been both killed
[3:32] Christians got whacked about his high
[3:34] horse and filled with the Holy Ghost and
[3:37] all of a sudden his eyes were shattered
[3:39] and blindness but then God says no the
[3:42] meticulous chapels huh and all of a
[3:44] sudden he wasn't dealing Christians
[3:46] anymore he was talking he was out there
[3:49] preaching the Word of God what the power
[3:52] of God was going to do for them and
[3:53] that's what God did for us God's 10 that
[3:56] Samantha Paul was a messenger all of us
[3:59] would be to be easy to change you know
[4:01] you tell people have we got
[4:05] that's right try to come back in the
[4:08] loopers that so many people actually
[4:09] believe Luther when people are saying
[4:12] either
[4:12] he brought the message of justification
[4:15] you need to come out of bondage
[4:19] they're telling you what to do their
[4:20] baptizing babies baptize babies babies a
[4:24] lot of people said here's a cuckoo who's
[4:29] under now he's in history was sleep now
[4:33] he's in history the Pentecostals now
[4:35] they're in history we have analysis into
[4:39] assertiveness find out because of God
[4:42] his truth without promoting man here
[4:48] they're devoting God but without
[4:51] recognizing God's generals and God's
[4:54] prophets and dogs provided way of
[4:57] sending the word to go back to read
[4:59] every one of those books if you see the
[5:01] word of the Lord came to the properties
[5:03] and he said see you can these bones
[5:09] these ep-1 as is our story he said
[5:13] prophesied to those bones you're going
[5:19] to speak to those dry bones in all most
[5:21] churches novels
[5:22] sons and daughters of thought that are
[5:24] bound up under the chains of tradition
[5:26] and circumstance and all those elements
[5:28] you're gonna speak to those trifles and
[5:30] they're gonna rise up as a mighty
[5:37] all these things you know it's
[5:44] [Music]
[5:54] because a son or a daughter thought just
[5:58] when you talk to the all-tournament that
[6:08] see you with your position so that he
[6:10] can use you to hold those planets all
[6:17] hear my voice you cannot deny this truth
[6:21] you cannot deny the stirring in your
[6:23] heart will you hear this word case
[6:25] focusing glory to God let's move along
[6:28] here here
[6:31] brother brother speaking out he goes on
[6:34] to get out and then this is her the
[6:37] message works is faith expressed you
[6:40] know if there's faith in you if there's
[6:42] faith God this dark places faith in his
[6:45] church he's gonna vindicate his church
[6:48] this is not about a man trying to clean
[6:51] what God said no no this is God he puts
[6:57] his word inside of you he starts to
[6:59] manifest the works of faith basis of
[7:02] Revelation a lot of people talk about
[7:04] faith what this big gate is because soon
[7:07] as clear as I can possibly meet you it's
[7:10] the mind of God being telepathically we
[7:16] kneel to you through this work so in
[7:21] other words it gets to my wife and that
[7:25] letter says I'll never forget that night
[7:29] that I asked it was an afternoon
[7:34] she'll remember all the details of that
[7:38] it will comfort her totally just like
[7:41] that I didn't speak that's how this with
[7:46] God in His Church
[7:47] God is people he speaks to you
[8:11] [Music]
[8:31] [Music]
[8:36] there was an enol and then he was he
[8:47] pleased the Lord the dimensional change
[9:03] that's how you change
[9:05] [Music]
[9:15] [Music]
[9:25] [Music]
[9:42] so you're the fantasy now to speak
[9:45] expressed the message now and you might
[9:48] understand now because I preach the
[9:50] scriptures here that's all for preaching
[9:54] Greeks the scriptures here the dates of
[9:58] stop so shall it be in the coming of the
[10:02] Son of man in the days that the church
[10:04] is being redeemed Church P he said in
[10:11] the days that the son of man is being
[10:14] Christ now giving himself in human
[10:18] vessel again a lot of people shocked
[10:24] when somebody says it's greater is He
[10:30] that's in me
[10:32] you really have to believe that in order
[10:36] for it to have effect it's like somebody
[10:39] saying that I know my big brother is
[10:43] right there and he's gonna he's got my
[10:46] back and he knows he's there because his
[10:50] big brother says how he I'll never leave
[10:52] I'll be with you on
[10:55] in every time that he got into a
[10:58] situation if you believe that that
[11:21] itself you're not to fear anything
[11:24] you're not a greater kind apology so
[11:26] here he is now the giving of something
[11:28] the same way he says as was the basis
[11:31] officers should do this come on man in
[11:34] the days that the church is being
[11:35] revealed though in the basics I'm asking
[11:38] what is revealed we know God is making
[11:43] to solve know that right we need the day
[11:47] that the Son of Man is being revealed it
[11:49] will be a big tomorrow is that
[11:52] right well this is the Saints to go back
[11:54] and study Sodom Gomorrah you look
[11:56] exactly what discipline history just
[11:59] look at the Google search so easy you
[12:01] can find out what was going on in the
[12:03] days of Sodom and Gomorrah those were
[12:04] two coastal cities that were an absolute
[12:07] disgrace homosexual ISM at the highest
[12:10] levels you know immorality at the
[12:14] highest levels you know and there was a
[12:16] bed in there unlocked which was
[12:19] Abraham's nephew was inside and they
[12:23] were in there and he was out
[12:24] the bear he was participating in all
[12:26] things it was all part of the situation
[12:28] but yet he knew that it was not right
[12:31] it's like a lot of people that live in
[12:33] this world they're looking at all happen
[12:35] around them this is that we're not to
[12:37] walk there and start condemning the
[12:39] whole sexuals in the lesbians of this
[12:41] madness
[12:42] they're all there because the word said
[12:44] thing would be there and we cannot
[12:46] change those things that's part of the
[12:48] prophecy you can still love them the
[12:51] same way you love anybody else because
[12:53] God can change translate transform and
[12:56] do anything that he wants with anybody
[12:59] okay so don't ever talk to somebody else
[13:02] because of a certain situation or
[13:04] condition they've got to take you not
[13:07] protect me from a life with drug
[13:08] addiction and take that might interfere
[13:11] around and put it into the service if
[13:14] you take a prostitute that he could meet
[13:16] at 11:00 and that's over there and that
[13:18] still got five husbands and the one
[13:20] she's with now is not even hers and God
[13:23] speaking a couple of words to that woman
[13:25] and you know that her testimony have to
[13:27] fuels warned again that she we see the
[13:29] word her testimony converted the whole
[13:32] city
[13:35] and she told him of the power of God for
[13:37] the book amen why because God can take
[13:40] any life he can do whatever he wants
[13:42] with it so we're not right about
[13:43] people's conditions will not look at
[13:46] people's situations
[14:39] [Music]
[14:47] [Music]
[15:01] because okay but we have to do something
[15:10] as a it's got to be awesome
[15:16] Deacon whatever it is you see because
[15:19] that's God's anointing on those officers
[15:21] in those positions but generally sons
[15:25] and daughters of God should be the
[15:27] happiest people on earth they should be
[15:30] happy people they should be always
[15:31] welcoming always ready to put up your
[15:33] hand and say god bless you no it's good
[15:36] to see you
[15:36] god bless you sister
[15:41] every day you need to get on your knees
[15:45] god help get some sanity newbies say
[15:49] alright get this thing away from my life
[15:51] get this atmosphere out of my life I'm
[15:53] not watching anymore I cannot I cannot
[16:00] [Music]
[16:06] [Music]
[16:11] because of my experience at everything
[16:13] so please people on earth who the uprise
[16:18] yes I'm not praying for you
[16:34] that this invisible union is is to bring
[16:38] unity to Prague and prosper the bodies
[16:41] that they strengthen and encourage the
[16:43] body of Christ that's what and who we
[16:45] are is that simple there's no other
[16:49] compromise Christian's
[16:51] down there in their right date they have
[16:54] to be messengers down that right this is
[16:58] not look we have never in all the
[17:01] history of the church ever had a
[17:03] universal messenger to the church then
[17:05] his need ended it had now people at the
[17:10] end of the day it's directly related to
[17:13] God it means that sent from god the
[17:17] father of nation individual and goddess
[17:21] is we giving himself through now brother
[17:25] brother
[17:26] Dileep Rahab was a messenger to the just
[17:30] like the messengers that God sent in two
[17:33] messengers into southern North Billy
[17:37] grave and all robbers were two
[17:39] messengers that God sent into the world
[17:41] and there was no two messengers that
[17:43] preached repentance and those two
[17:45] messages like the other like brother
[17:47] Billy Graham on on repentance and
[17:50] brother Robert something gives to the
[17:52] spirit receiving the Holy Ghost and the
[17:54] Pentecostal movement to call into they
[17:58] were calling
[18:04] [Music]
[18:08] in there Abraham go back to read the
[18:36] book of Genesis Genesis 15 apron and God
[18:43] community when Abraham and Abraham same
[18:45] horn because they practice God showed
[18:48] Abraham come to the discourse on the
[18:50] door of a sense of elation unweighted it
[18:54] up because there's no there's there's
[18:56] not one register I'm just going to
[18:59] whatever the Colorado and his family
[19:02] everything else is going to be the
[19:04] spices when winters 50 40 he says causes
[19:09] I was spared in the world or this
[19:13] tournament obscure there was what 2010
[19:23] because of the horrible against the you
[19:31] cannot change that prophecy States as
[19:34] was the days of son we're entering into
[19:37] those changes now
[19:38] become public knowledge you cannot be
[19:41] more than talking against homosexuals
[19:43] and it's against the law
[19:45] they've gotten out where it's all become
[19:48] just playing it's simple it's just the
[19:51] way it is you're nothing you're not to
[19:53] walk there and try to protest against it
[19:55] everything else that's not your
[19:57] department work there's people up there
[20:00] that do it because they don't understand
[20:02] the prophecy of this world has to come
[20:06] people God can bring the property
[20:09] judgment and break the rapture and then
[20:12] for us to go into the 1000 year
[20:14] millennial which is 1,000 years of peace
[20:16] here on this earth so this small part of
[20:19] dogs behind Upton sonicator everything
[20:21] is working perfectly together well this
[20:23] is whether the Brotherhood was a and
[20:44] here now these hop the see overall
[20:48] purchase office e-rep yeah william
[20:55] branham is off the seat oh brother look
[21:02] at the
[21:08] he grandma's teeth are any age eight out
[21:12] of six letters everybody knows that the
[21:14] number six represents man is all
[21:17] commands the number seventeen recipe six
[21:28] numbers six digits Brandon never in the
[21:32] history of church charismatic movements
[21:36] and leads of God and everything else was
[21:40] just a coincidence because and aged 87
[21:51] number condition number that God just
[21:55] like the seven churches seven messengers
[21:59] everything is all perfectly put together
[22:03] and if you look at the name-brand and
[22:07] brandy the wheat he's going to take the
[22:11] wheat it's going to put it into the dark
[22:13] and everything else everything else it's
[22:22] all part of God's plan is just the way
[22:24] this we can't change that but God do
[22:27] these things
[22:39] [Music]
[22:41] but Abraham's name was a TBR aah ATM you
[22:48] go back in the Bible the book of Genesis
[22:50] Abraham father of Nations talks about
[22:55] Abraham's faith in the book of the New
[22:57] Testament in the book of Hebrews talks
[23:00] about Abraham's bacon how he staggered
[23:03] not at the promise of God because they
[23:05] were chosen people Abraham population to
[23:08] the nation of Israel out of people
[23:11] Israel as to the title of the Christian
[23:15] church God's called the elected people
[23:17] everything runs in perfect light perfect
[23:20] turnouts 84 heaven here downtown sense
[23:24] of bread had seven digits safe last
[23:27] three digits at at the end because now
[23:30] the hearts of the children would be see
[23:35] it's all perfect it's everything is the
[23:37] perfect God those ways so the universal
[23:42] church being the letter of and six men
[23:45] made organization yet has received their
[23:48] messenger it had a safety Moody foody
[23:51] knocks counters over the never I have
[23:56] that daughter said the dog says a grand
[23:59] and then he sends a friend they even
[24:01] butter billy graham new brother brandon
[24:03] big to each other he came up from each
[24:06] other's meetings they came up really
[24:09] great came up brother credits meetings
[24:11] all rockets they work together they were
[24:13] listeners never on the field but brother
[24:15] Brandon had a messenger that was going
[24:17] to the sons and daughters of God the
[24:19] elected from the foundations of the
[24:21] world those whose names were written in
[24:23] the last of the white folks who said my
[24:25] sheep hear my voice those that would
[24:27] receive the opening of the seven seals
[24:29] those that without the revelation of the
[24:31] seven churches so that they could place
[24:33] everything age of decision everything
[24:35] and so they didn't look back to industry
[24:37] and denying everything lining up
[24:40] perfectly together because God has a
[24:42] plan God's make it simple enough
[24:45] we can go to you so that you can stand
[24:47] with confidence that you're not just
[24:49] believing some tables this is not me not
[24:52] this is not these are these are people
[24:54] do your own research you will find that
[24:57] this is God's Word maybe this is God's
[25:00] revealed word for this day for this our
[25:02] dividend we're not making another just
[25:04] giving you what was in the industry of
[25:08] what products of the day that were
[25:09] innocence but he says but look but never
[25:12] had is that right but they got and these
[25:15] ambassadors
[25:16] and he's backing that walls as hard as
[25:19] he can never did everybody preach like
[25:21] duty great went around the world from
[25:24] the top he preached the president she
[25:26] prayed for precedence he was all over
[25:28] the world because to the and that's the
[26:02] way it got center grant sent a messenger
[26:08] about sent us a word but return with the
[26:10] investment we destiny for Dane covenant
[26:13] Abraham and his group got a messenger to
[26:16] watch he didn't he'd give them a
[26:19] scientist that the time was near to the
[26:22] fired upon
[26:23] now it's firing out we're looking for
[26:25] there's going to be an atomic there's
[26:27] gonna be a tug of war it's going to be
[26:28] something that's going to spread we
[26:29] already know that there's it will build
[26:31] these bombs because they're not going to
[26:33] use them they're both there there's
[26:35] there's going to be a pretty severe
[26:37] World War
[26:41] there's going to be some pretty
[26:42] devastating defense that are going to
[26:45] take place on the earth no we can't stop
[26:47] that though we're not food sayers you
[26:49] know what I was reaching out sides of us
[26:52] here googled revealed already that's not
[26:56] who we are
[26:57] we both thought was going to take us out
[26:59] of this and we've got faith to live and
[27:04] to love and to be who we are because we
[27:08] can't change it
[27:09] you're who you are because God made you
[27:11] he cannot change this is that simple now
[27:15] that messenger did something he spoke
[27:17] about a woman that he had his back
[27:19] turned to and told her told her she was
[27:21] dummy when he was say her remember when
[27:23] Abraham went and were labelled peasant
[27:26] when God came to visit with Abraham and
[27:28] his wife was there and he was telling
[27:31] Abraham that he was going to have a son
[27:34] that's just like the promise that that
[27:38] God has given us that we were going to
[27:40] bring forth Christ in our lives it's all
[27:43] the titles like the Virgin Mary with the
[27:45] age of 1 to the Virgin Mary
[27:48] or a certain I shall call his name Jesus
[27:50] she will lead the word Angela
[27:53] literally translated a body a seed word
[27:57] body into her that God spoke in turn and
[28:01] it's the same thing now that God was
[28:04] coming to gaybraham and tell them that
[28:07] your wife Sarah she's going to have a
[28:10] son
[28:11] and they were already 75 years old he
[28:14] was older but yet she laughed because
[28:19] she couldn't believe that this was that
[28:21] every body was actually changed a lot of
[28:28] us don't believe there's a lot of
[28:30] service that are in the camp that are
[28:33] there in the world that that are
[28:35] claiming all Abraham and this is not the
[28:37] right seraphim the rapture it will lead
[28:40] to the body change that God's going to
[28:42] make us kill together that thoughts
[28:43] going to translate into the preform is
[28:46] this glorious victory which is Christ
[28:48] his bride and a great feet in the air
[28:51] and she's not in the air somewhere on a
[28:53] cloud it's another dimension just like
[28:55] this one here and we're going to gather
[28:57] into a corner into a supper and
[29:00] that's going to be very long with the
[29:03] sons and daughters of God we're gonna
[29:04] rejoice we're gonna have a good dinner
[29:07] together
[29:08] for three to five years while there's a
[29:11] lot of tribulation we're not in this
[29:13] dimension
[29:14] just as I mention will change all of
[29:16] this it'll be me up Scotty you see that
[29:18] you're in there it's just that simple
[29:23] Jesus group that we came to the earth he
[29:25] walked right through the wall he came
[29:27] right into the room he said that it was
[29:36] sure that there's a there's an eternal
[29:40] body there's one way to this birth the
[29:42] tabernacle Peter saw there's another one
[29:49] that's why this party is going to be
[29:51] but this time it's actually going
[29:53] to be changed it's gonna be like just
[29:55] like Star Trek that's as easy as you can
[29:59] describe it it's going to be putting so
[30:01] much that it's just going to translate
[30:02] and it's not going to give in an old
[30:04] body or it's gonna get brand new 21 year
[30:08] old maybe 20 years old
[30:10] whatever

[30:17] holding up and here he's saying now that
[30:19] he spoke about a woman that he had his
[30:22] back to her and told her and told her
[30:24] she was done it he was saying talk to
[30:27] her her condition and what was going to
[30:29] happen is that right that he say that
[30:32] the son of man would be dealing
[30:33] something the same way in that date he's
[30:36] doing the same well do you believe that
[30:38] the truth will here stands a woman and
[30:42] now he was out of meeting now and he was
[30:45] converting they kind of divided listen
[30:47] to this message here that faith is works
[30:50] as expressed he's not leading to a
[30:54] paradigm and look what he says here he
[30:56] says here that luck here stands a wooden
[30:59] dock with surety people got to listen to
[31:01] that message brother Brennan was there
[31:03] he had thousands of fair lives
[31:06] and the Holy Spirit the angel of God
[31:08] would come right variant that we would
[31:11] be standing right next to him and would
[31:13] tell him every detail of the person here
[31:17] league is Andrea best you live at 12:22
[31:21] Yonge Street yesterday humor and their
[31:23] doctors and the doctor said that you've
[31:26] got cancer and that you are only got
[31:28] four months to live and the doctor had a
[31:31] white gown on it is a black hair
[31:34] that stuff said born before that
[31:37] wouldn't even breathe it off she would
[31:41] jungle rejoice and right there he says
[31:43] appear healed and she never was
[31:51] it wasn't brother gratitude was the
[31:53] power of the Spirit of God vindicated
[31:55] and saying that we better listen to this
[31:58] revelation of this message because the
[32:00] best of days bringing is for my people
[32:02] and I'm not doing these signs and
[32:04] wonders because I want to show up
[32:06] because I'm indicating that means God's
[32:12] healing the Nitza that needs a community
[32:14] we thought we did have communion and
[32:16] it's not about just coming together the
[32:18] deep breath if you want it you're hungry
[32:20] you want to drink a little bit of water
[32:22] you need to do that at home okay you can
[32:25] feed it all beat up get your food and uh
[32:28] this is not about coming together for us
[32:30] as a tradition to eat the Lord's Supper
[32:33] this is about communion with God this
[32:36] about you recognize that human restore
[32:40] you give you a total deliverance from
[32:42] whatever
[32:45] situation financially relationship
[32:49] [Music]
[32:54] because he's still sitting on the
[32:56] support assessor he says well here
[32:57] stands a woman and in the invisible
[33:01] union of the church the pride to Christ
[33:05] that messenger is here which is Jesus
[33:09] Christ the same yesterday today and
[33:12] forever
[33:14] now I got that whole disorder and I
[33:17] realized how hard was leading and where
[33:20] he was leading us and how he was gonna
[33:22] bring us into communion and how it is
[33:24] that God can do something here this
[33:26] morning we're not here because of a
[33:28] traditional Lord's Supper no sir we've
[33:33] come here because we have come here
[33:36] because my brother hasn't possessing all
[33:40] things is here since under the but by
[33:43] faith tonight in Christ Jesus we shall
[33:46] not take the community not the community
[33:49] you commune as you eat with one another
[33:53] just communing with God he says the
[33:56] communion is not the bread it's not the
[33:59] why is because you have a revelation
[34:09] the community is talking back and forth
[34:13] [Music]
[34:16] and this is a simple that we take that
[34:20] we believe in his death that good body
[34:24] his burial his resurrection we believe
[34:28] in the presence of the Holy Spirit and
[34:30] we believe that he gave us eternal life
[34:34] that we cannot die we have passed from
[34:37] death unto life and some people when we
[34:40] separate from one another here will rise
[34:43] again in the resurrection with each
[34:45] other joined together with Christ Jesus
[34:47] as a that's what the communion because
[34:55] we believe that he's here that we can
[34:58] receive a healing that what we're taking
[35:01] that breath it's not that's incited with
[35:08] Jesus because he were in when he went to
[35:13] the cross you were on his mind you were
[35:16] there you were with him you were born
[35:22] we were going through this experience
[35:24] you were doing you were there his song
[35:26] move before you cite yourself here today
[35:29] and in July 14 2019 before you were here
[35:35] he saw you here he saw you commuting he
[35:38] saw that you have a desire to be to be
[35:41] healed to be restored to be be dedicated
[35:45] to the Lord whatever it is that you have
[35:47] with you
[35:47] God wants to do it for you this morning
[35:50] God wants to set you free gonna give you
[35:53] strength of your body
[35:54] God wants to give your back God must
[35:57] have built a human earier blood pressure
[36:00] got us to deal with that with that power
[36:03] condition gotta move all these things
[36:06] aside diabetes whatever it is I believe
[36:15] it with all my heart
[36:16] amen this week when I was working and I
[36:20] was doing things but life even knows it
[36:22] and something
[36:27] [Music]
[36:30] and within just like that and so I heard
[37:29] your testimony I was blessed Wow
[37:37] and he was fighting up these he wants to
[37:43] send the board at that time he was but
[38:15] he kept at the top and God knew because
[38:18] given the strength that he was doing
[38:20] everything he ever knew and everything
[38:21] else but God is able he's still got
[38:26] something that's cost promises that's
[38:36] God's Word that's available to us this
[38:39] morning there's one testimony after the
[38:41] other after the other that says that God
[38:44] can do it other than we and solar heater
[38:48] count up the votes coming so we're going
[38:51] to go to the Lord's Supper and we will
[38:53] be done by 1:30 by the grace of God and
[39:04] so the ground of speaking here is saying
[39:09] I come this is the best
[39:13] the door he says I come to I come into
[39:18] some what suffering is fellowship you
[39:22] got publishing one with another how
[39:24] about the Lord and you are buddies you
[39:27] are partners and whatever you have he
[39:29] has to whatever he has you have to you
[39:33] see you he becomes you that you might
[39:36] become him and everything is in common
[39:39] then there is another little door in
[39:42] your heart I'd like to speak of this
[39:46] this morning and that other door is the
[39:49] door to me so many Christians now you
[39:56] say Lord you can come in that's right
[39:59] but I don't believe that all the Bible
[40:01] is right I will see what the church says
[40:04] but I let take the wrestler how does the
[40:08] Lord ever going to question them how can
[40:10] he be your Lord and even if he can't get
[40:14] your hearts door of faith you know that
[40:18] feeling is a revelation from God
[40:21] all got us to do is say here to you I
[40:24] mean this have to speak that way he did
[40:28] it right by speaking through the kingdom
[40:31] but it wasn't another kind of set it was
[40:35] the fact like God said to brother Mike
[40:39] through what he said here he and right
[40:45] there and then it materialized in his
[40:47] body because faith is a substance you
[40:51] just have to open your heart to believe
[40:52] that is possible that's it it's as
[40:55] simple as that so just hold whatever it
[40:58] is that you have
[40:59] all the Lord keep it here possible the
[41:03] local medical just hold on to that of us
[41:05] people over here he says my you see
[41:08] already be company he says now over
[41:11] never got a question about can he do to
[41:13] you they'd be here Gordon here if you
[41:14] can't even get near her and you accept
[41:18] it by faith he can come in and you
[41:20] welcome him you open that door and you
[41:24] walk into that faith of yours and you

[41:29] want to welcome him this morning to my
[41:32] heart other roots every door how about a
[41:41] sweet I stand there and kiss the cup of
[41:44] blessing with him in the door and

[42:41] mean here you are a Christian and I
[42:43] appreciate that by accepting the Lord
[42:45] but you're living under your privilege
[42:48] you're keeping your door closed you are
[42:51] running from pillar to post and so forth
[42:54] because you don't believe you must open
[42:57] that door faith and back give in then he
[43:00] will give you the desires of your heart
[43:03] upon the Lord shall renew their strength

[43:39] and brought into the
[43:40] see and believe that's being done all I
[43:44] believe man is beat that you shall

[46:47] whosoever shall eat of this bread drink
[46:50] this cup not a man examine himself and
[46:57] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[46:59] that Cup but he that eateth and drinketh
[47:02] unworthily in the drinking that we
[47:05] should do soft like the street towards
[47:08] this cause many are weak and sickly
