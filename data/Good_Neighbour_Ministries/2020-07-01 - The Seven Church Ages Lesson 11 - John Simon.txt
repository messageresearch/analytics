TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening my precious friends it's good to be here again may the Lord richly bless our study and the teaching of the word of God tonight I will talk about the Atmos vision let us pray as we come into his presence with joy with grace and with Thanksgiving may the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and cause his face to shine upon you and grant you peace now and forevermore father we ask your divine blessing upon this service here tonight and may the Great Holy Spirit anoint the word of God from our hearts into the hearts of our hearers of our listeners may the spirit of grace may the Spirit of Almighty God send the arrows of his word to the hearts of his beloved we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen reading from the wonderful book of Revelation chapter 1 from verse 9 and 10 for I John who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ who was in the isle that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet thank God John was on the Isle of Patmos now what can we learn from his stay him being on this Isle of Patmos first of all the Apostle John of course received a marvelous series of visions while upon that Isle of Patmos and these visions as our focus as believers as the Church of God as the Bride of Christ our focus should always be on the Lord Jesus Christ himself his person his glorious marvelous and wonderful person so John received these visions and these visions were all about the person of Jesus Christ now we know that John was banished banished to this Isle of Patmos which was a small island about 30 miles off of the coast of Asia Minor in the Aegean Sea a rocky and infested place with snakes lizards and scorpions all around - the Roman Empire it had no commercial value so it was used by the Roman Empire to house and hold prisoners it was a penal colony just like Devil's Island it was a penal colony for the Roman Empire that time where they held most of their desperate criminals political criminals were all held there now we noticed that John in speaking to us addressed himself to Christians as brothers in tribulation of course he is referring to the fact that he was not the only one that was undergoing trial tribulation persecution suffering but that he was made an example to other Christians by being placed on this Isle of Patmos for it was in that time that Christians were being persecuted persecution was on the fires of him were burning hot the demons of hell with the three-pronged forks were out pricking on torturing the minds the bodies and the spirit most of all the faith of the believers were sorely tested as they served the truth and the Living God their faith was evil spoken of everywhere within the Empire the people who held to this Christian faith were being imprisoned they were being killed tortured men women children who ever held a name of Jesus Christ as I was in the nation of South Sudan during their Wars during the 90s to this time I believe while there in one of the camps the war was going on bombs could be dropped at any turning warring militias could plan attack villages towns at any moment especially coming from the north and these believed are there a crescent moon prophet was the one that they came down with that faith to attack the Christian faith now we see during that time a meeting was called in which I was privileged to be in there was there was Catholics they were Anglicans they were Lutheran's they were a Nazarene belief they were Baptist they were seven day Adventists they were all kinds of denominational beliefs gathered there together as one in Christ and the reason why that when the invaders came down from the north they were not asking whether or not you were Catholic you're Adventists you were Methodists or whatever you want as long as you bore the name of Christ or you carry the cross or believed in the blood of Jesus Christ you were target and was instantly assassinated and taken to pieces chopped to pieces in those days the point I'm making is that regardless of what straight what part of Christianity that you're a part of what part of the Church of Worldwide Church of God that you are regardless once you name the name of Christ you were instantly killed and so is it anyone that named the name of Christ in those days were immediately in prison persecuted tortured and put to death now John like many others that's the reason he included himself not that because he was an apostle he was excluded or he was of a prince of the church so he was of course a kept out of that and know my friends God made him an example to give heart to the other believers to hold the faith of God firmly in the in the lights of it in their hearts so here it is arrest him and trade the trade in van to kill John then they tried to kill him by boiling him in a pot of hot boiling frying oil but plead forgot that boy is a type of the Holy Spirit and John was placed in that pop of oil for 24 hours and they kept boiling and boiling and he was not dying and dying or screaming and shouting but like Daniel in the lion's den Daniel prayed to his God Daniel sang the songs of Judah and of Zion and give glory to God for his God would protecting him for he was in the line of service now it's periodic for someone to just jump into a pit alliance or or dabble with snakes because the Bible tells us that he will protect us now you'll be provoking God to do such a thing of your own but while in the line of duty and of service God watching over his own and protecting his children my brothers the Lions became like a pillow for Daniel sleep in the night and this pot of boiling oil was a type of the Holy Spirit and if John understood that John must have felt comfortable in the middle of that boil and like Hugh Latimer and Master Ridley in England were the burning flames of the bonfire run them when they were tied to the stake take heart take courage mr. Ridley we will light up a light of pale here in England that shall never be pabout and the light of Christianity still blazes in that land it still is a light across the world because those that went before us paid the price they paid the price for there is a cost to any true Pentecost and the Holy Spirit protected them and provided a way out form their tribulations there it was John for 24 hours boiled and when after 24 hours yet he did not die there were even more enraged instead of them recognizing that the hand of God was upon the servant of the Lord they got morin and raised and angered that they could not kill him and these powerless officials then sentence him to badness as a of some kind of a witch for the equipment understand how he could live in a boiling pot of oil which he should have been afraid in an instant by it but remember God with him as God is with us in our trials in our troubles in our desperations in our depression or oppression my friends he said I will never leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you I'll be with you to the very end of the age I'll be with you as he was with Daniel and the three boys in the fiery furnace God will be with you as the first man in the fire as with you in the trial in your tribulation in your dark darkness of despair he will Bitchie be with you you are never alone for he said I will never leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you to the very end of the age Oh comfort Oh what consolation Oh what joy to know that we can walk with him and then he my friends has brought himself to our lowest state to walk with us to think that the King on Isle only better can walk hand in hand together a nice road led by his mighty hand and protected by his prevailing power made a great holy spirit Saint this within our souls and within our heart and give us a confidence and a certainty that we can stand up upon our feet get off of your knees stand up on your feet rise and try again and know that our God is with you every step that you did so he was speared and he was allowed to leave the island of Patmos and returned to his pastor rate of the city of Ephesus the church in Ephesus where he continued as pastor until the time of his death no John of course I believe if if I'm correct John love's the only disciple that actually died in his bed a peaceful death in this bed know all the others every one of them parish might fire by sword or by some form of a horrible her if ik death but John whom Jesus spoke to love died upon his death bed as an old man now these visions that John received was over a period of about two years from eighty nine to five and eighty nine to six and of course they're among the most remarkable visions found within the boundaries of God's Word now this book of Revelation may I say by the words of the Prophet revelation is a book of symbols it's a book I and I see of God's system of paragrafix you know the old Egyptians wrote their books their signs were all done in word pictures and this is what God did in this book of Revelation giving us symbols signs prophecies being expressed in the form of signs and symbols to us so that we may recognize what he is doing in the years to come the things that were going to be that these things would be clearer to us for a picture is better than a thousand words now remember here that this book as I've said is also a target of the system much speculation a book of dispute however this book has the seal of God upon it it has the missing of God upon it blessed is he that readeth and to him that understands and he didn't ear to hear let him hear what the Spirit of God is saying to the churches the church ages what God is saying and speaking and unfolding by his word now this book is authentic this book is of tremendous value of course to all of us who read it or listen to the reading of it of the sacred pages for the scripture says that clearly blessed is he that readeth or he that hears the word of this book so you are blessed right now even listening to what you are hearing this a blessing of God is coming upon you while you are listening to what you are hearing for this is the word of God now as we have said what can we learn from John's time upon this Isle of Patmos remember here John said in the word John revelation 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet listen to that phrase Johnson I was in the spirit friends here it is we are now learning from John state on this Isle of Patmos about the importance of the reception of revelation that we must be in this spirit and the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit to be able to receive revelation from the presence of Almighty God so we must be in that atmosphere in that attitude of being in God's Spirit to be able to receive revelation now why are we as believers believe that clearly in God's Word we understand friends that some want to be in the fish the believe by going through the actions the motions of the human freshly manifestations which they may call the Holy Spirit that that will give them revelation but listen to what the Word of God 1st Corinthians 3:1 to 6 and I brethren could not speak unto you as spiritual but as Carla even as unto babes in Christ I have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you are not able to bear it neither yet now are you able for you are yet carnal for where as there is among you envying and strife and divisions are you not carnal and what is meant for white one set I am of Paul I am of apollos I do not carnal who they respond and who is Apollo's but ministers by whom you believe even as the Lord gave every man I have planted and Apollo's watered and God gave the increase in Galatians chapter 5 if you turn with me verse 13 to 21 for brethren you've been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for the occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self for if you bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you work but if you be led on the spirit you are not under the law now the works of the flesh are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revellings and thus the such length of the which I tell you before as I have told you also in times past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God my friends if we are going to live as Christians we must live in the spirit and walk in the spirit John was not talking about being his own spirit worked up in his own spirit but he is talking about being under the anointing of the Blessed holy spirit no it has to be the Spirit of God that will come upon you and give you the wisdom of God the revelation of God not the knowledge of man but the revelation knowledge of the Living God now we realize in John chapter 15 1 2 5 Jesus says I am the vine you are the branches furthermore he says with out me you can do nothing without the Holy Spirit anointing you and lightening you teaching you guiding you witnessing to you warning you this great Holy Spirit is the one my friends without him we are powerless and we can do nothing for it's not by might nor by power it's by the Spirit of the Living God working within your heart and in your life so it has to be the Spirit of God and John gave him revelation and it has to be that same spirit of God on us that will also give us revelation therefore Paul said our efforts will be freshly and there will be in vain but if we run the spiff we are in the spirit then pray in the spirit live in the spirit sing when you sing sing in the spirit when you worship worship in the spirit if you live walk with Him that by him and live in the Spirit of God all friends if there is anything good that will come to us then it has to be revealed by God's Holy Spirit it has to be confirmed by the Word of God and made manifest for by their fruits or by the fruits and bears you will know whether that's the spirit of Almighty God or not to receive these from men revelations it will take the same spirit to give it up gave it to come back and be here with us to reveal it is this is just plain we can see it clearly the word was given by inspiration it must be received by inspiration given by revelation to men of God People of God now it must be also received by revelation by the same spirit that gave it for God is his own interprete and he will make it plain now so then we see friends we need the spirit to be unbe able to understand these marvelous revelations of God that God has given to us to live by in and through his word now in that chapter 2 verse 38 Peter tells us clearly repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen see so if you want to receive the Spirit of God to be able to receive revelation you must first repent you must come to God and repent of your sins and be baptized next in water the correct way in the name of Jesus Christ said Peter be receive him confess him be baptized in water in his wonderful name the name of Jesus upon your spiritual marriage certificate or praise God for evermore and God will fulfill his word my friends by filling you with wisdom and understanding filling you with the Spirit of God the Word of God gone up with a shout in a blaze of fire the pure fire with back restored within your heart and within your life praise God yes sir Oh France so pray the God for the revelation of God by His Holy Spirit get in the spirit now we see here the Word of God says clearly to us that if we need anything from God whatever it is we need to get in the spirit if you need healing then you understand do these things according to God's Word first ask God for your healing ask God for your deliverance secondly call for the elders of the church as the Bible said simply obey the simple word of God as simple as it sounds call for the elders of the church confess your sins the Bible says confess your sins before your even prayed for for confess your sins to God let the other the Church of knowing you with boil which is a symbol of the Holy Spirit upon you and let them pray over you and not just say a prayer like that but the Bible says that the earnest that the sincere prayer the earnest prayer of a righteous man availeth much with God hallelujah that is what we need and when we follow God's program God's plan laid out in his word my friends that your answer welcome your answer will be right there it may not be immediately but your answer will come for God is unfailing in his word and he will fulfill it now you see brother Simon what do you mean about getting in the spirit getting in the spirit well you know my friends that out there we understand amongst people human beings we go to the baseball game go to the football games we go maybe to a basketball game or hockey game or also some people go to parties or they'll go to a dance I like that but think of it when they go to a ballgame a party or a dance they don't just sit around all the time but they're trying to get into the spirit of the atmosphere and the attitude of that game or that party or that dance did getting into the spirit when there is a goal scored my god whether it's football whatever they're in a great shock they'll throw their caps in the air they're then just shootin hummer their team is winning and when our team is winning we need to get in the spirit on holler and shout and praise our God and give glory to his wonderful and marvelous name Oh glory to God but many times a lot of believers want to sit us wallflowers well they want to sit in this in in the seats of spectators and they want to sit as if they're just observers my friends but we are not to be observers or spectators God calls us to me participate errs we ought to be in god's spirit rejoicing night and day as we want the narrow way for the hand of God upon our lives we see and the reason for all this is the reason for bliss hallelujah is that the comforter has come to stay within her heart the double peace has found its nest upon thy altars O Lord the spirit of the Living God rests with us and walks with us and talks with us within our hearts every day for they that the sons and daughters of God led by the spirit of the Living God in other words if those people can enter into the feeling and atmosphere that they are in how much more we as believers as Christians shall get into the feeling into the spirit and the despair of what we are in by the presence of God but of course Satan hates that Satan hates that and he thinks that he hates the people that behave like that that that acts like you know shouting praising God shouting hallelujah giving glory to his name trying to tell you you're too dignified to do that you too rich to do that you do you're too conservative to do that you you're too manly and cultured to do that my friends let me tell you where the Spirit of the Living God falls on the true believer regardless of color culture race status stature stratus whatever it is when the Spirit comes he is the leveler to meet the high places low and the low places I hi he is the one that makes all things one into harmony beautiful composition by the great director of the supernatural symphony of the Spirit of Almighty God making it all work together to bring forth the music of the cosmos the music of the spheres that's the music the harmony and the beautiful timing of the Blessed Holy Spirit working within the life of the believer praise God forever that devil hates it though they want to shut down meetings like that revivals like that prayer meetings like that they wanna shut it down when believer scantiness spirit almost soft lectures you know beautiful descriptions are wonderful more admiration for the presentation and the personality and the beauty and artistry of the theology and stuff that my friends get away from that back to God back to the Word of God those rough crude prophets of patriarch with the sheep skins on I tell you it that they'll even throw Paul out of the pulpit if you were to come back today then that one reject they will reject him as a jailbird with a bad reputation he had no and having no degrees of this world the only degree he he had was a big experience born again by the Spirit of the Living God and walking under the anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir so we should expect this Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit to the stirrup Satan's hatred what he sees people coming back to the original face of God moving within their heart if they hate it they don't know why it gives them that feeling that the kinds of creates that feeling are upon them that they can't stand that they don't want that that what a beautiful thing that will struck them like a cat so that they can just meow and relax and have a good time in the pew my friends may God help every one of us to get in God's Spirit but let's come as Christians and get into the spirit of worship where our spirit is clean where our spirit is fresh where the Holy Spirit of us is real it's sobah it's never performance it's not a show it's not too impressed it's not to attract a human beings in that sense not my friends it's it's a serious but sober spirit of the Living God even though it's exuberant with the joy of the Lord which is our strength the joy of God riches above all our understanding my friend praise God it's full of the pleasures rivers of pleasure rivers of joy flooding our soul with a glorified heaven the sunshine shining down with in the Dutton parts of our minds on hearts and bringing the light of God within us to enlighten our ignorance and Layton or blindness and Layton every part of our being no wonder he said I am the light of the world he that fun with me shall not walk in darkness just shall have the light the light of life so let us then savor taste and see the Lord is good let us see the goodness of God let us delight in the Word of God the service of the king walking in fellowship together as believers in Christ Oh Gloria his marvelous name let our hearts let our emotions be a purely focused on the Lord not on man or men or or our church or our loyalty to some group or groups but our learning to be beat up Christ alone for he the great work proper profit of this 20th century said often we find ourselves loyal mark love church or being loyal brought to us of government let it be a church government or some sort my friends rather than to Christ and Christ alone look away - Jesus look away to him and to him alone and when you do that he will draw you deeper and deeper and to himself oh praise God God bless you what a joy to be with you this evening my precious friends may the Holy Spirit go with you and continue to talk with you and lead you and guide you heal you deliver you bring you encouragement of Lippmann and may the joy of the Lord continue to be your strength until we
