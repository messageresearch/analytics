[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] the morning friends good Sunday morning
[0:16] to all of you may God richly bless us
[0:21] together here today I'm happy to be in
[0:25] the house of the Lord to appraise him
[0:28] and give him Thanksgiving for all of his
[0:33] goodness and all of His mercies to me
[0:37] now last week we explained the meaning
[0:42] of the word quicken we quoted up from a
[0:47] poem called the little plant and spoke
[0:52] of gods that spoke of the fact of God's
[0:56] elected seed for if the seed be planted
[1:01] the water will raise it up again if the
[1:06] seed be planted the word will raise it
[1:10] up again and furthermore we talked about
[1:15] the seed gene of God how it was placed
[1:20] in the believer and for the believer to
[1:25] be conductor a conductor or conductors
[1:30] of the word of God in the age in which
[1:35] they are living in then we close with
[1:39] the thought of mechanics and dynamics
[1:44] that a car may have all the gas but if
[1:49] that spark plug
[1:51] that's not fire and there's no fire and
[1:54] the gas all you have is a piece of junk
[1:57] it may be beautiful
[1:59] it may be expensive it may be a lovely
[2:03] looking church might be a wonderful
[2:06] looking Christian person but whoever
[2:10] they are without that fire of the Holy
[2:14] Spirit that quickening power of the
[2:17] spark of the Living God may
[2:20] he himself manifests in the life of that
[2:23] church for that individual it's nothing
[2:27] but a piece of junk but with the fire
[2:31] the motive power of the Holy Spirit is
[2:34] able to empower and motivate and move it
[2:39] to accomplish the perfect will and plan
[2:42] of God no Paul made it clear that his
[2:48] knowledge of Jesus Christ was not from
[2:52] the seminary it was not from the
[2:57] University of Gamaliel but his knowledge
[3:02] was from God he said by revelation he
[3:08] made known unto me the mystery by
[3:12] revelation he not the seminary he not
[3:19] the Malians university but he Jesus
[3:23] Christ who met him on the road to
[3:26] Damascus he revealed to me the mystery
[3:31] he revealed to me all of his hidden
[3:35] secrets all the great secrets of God
[3:40] that were hidden for ages and ages and
[3:44] for generations as it is written in the
[3:48] scriptures he has now made know all of
[3:53] his secrets that were hidden
[3:55] being made known to his people to his
[3:59] living Saints he is revealing himself
[4:03] and His Word now let us read from the
[4:09] scripture Ephesians chapter 3 verses 1
[4:14] to 5 for this cause I ain't Paul the
[4:20] prisoner of jesus christ for you
[4:22] gentiles if you have heard of the
[4:25] dispensation of the grace of god which
[4:29] is given to me you were how that by
[4:33] revelation
[4:34] nation he made known unto me the mystery
[4:38] as I wrote a for in a few words whereby
[4:44] when you read you may understand my
[4:50] understanding my knowledge in the
[4:53] mystery of Christ which in other ages
[4:59] was not made known unto the sons of men
[5:04] but as it is now revealed unto his holy
[5:10] apostles and prophets by the spirit that
[5:15] the Gentiles should be fellow heirs of
[5:17] the same body and partakers of his
[5:21] promise in Christ by the gospel how
[5:25] wonderful Paul received revelation Paul
[5:31] received
[5:32] hidden knowledge Oh we're speaking this
[5:36] morning on the Spirit quickens the word
[5:41] and before we continue speaking let us
[5:48] have a brief word of Prayer
[5:50] dear God we come today in the name of
[5:55] Jesus Christ made a great holy spirit
[6:00] move up on the scene Lord move on the
[6:04] waters of the word let the word of God
[6:08] be stirred up in our soul and let the
[6:12] word live today as it has never been
[6:16] alive let it leap off the pages of the
[6:20] Bible let it lord god just leap into our
[6:23] hearts and you take all the praise the
[6:26] honor and glory for we ask it in the
[6:29] name of Jesus Christ amen and amen
[6:35] now Paul received God's great secrets by
[6:42] revelation and if he received it by
[6:47] halation how are you going to receive it
[6:52] how do we receive it how we do probably
[6:57] receive revelation Ephesians three one a
[7:01] Frank tells us clearly is by revelation
[7:06] Hebrews tells us faith cometh by hearing
[7:09] and hearing by the Word of God it means
[7:15] that as you listen to this sermon faith
[7:20] revelation is knocking on your door may
[7:24] you open your heart may you open your
[7:27] mind your life and let the word of God
[7:30] come in we read in the book of
[7:33] revelation of Jesus knocking on the door
[7:37] asking to be let in and he was left on
[7:41] the outside
[7:42] oh I plead with you my friends my
[7:45] brothers and sisters do not leave him
[7:47] out of your experience do not exclude
[7:51] him from your life do not keep him away
[7:55] from your lifestyle but today I
[7:58] encourage and urge you to invite him
[8:02] into your life and he will set all
[8:05] things right for his glory and honor how
[8:08] do you receive revelation how do you
[8:10] receive faith you receive it as I staff
[8:14] or sit by listening to this sermon here
[8:18] today also by listening to the faithful
[8:22] preaching and teaching of your pastor
[8:25] the Word of God just reading out of the
[8:30] Bible if you are a child of God he will
[8:34] quickly your understanding to that word
[8:37] of God o listening also to the sermons
[8:43] of the messenger of this seventh church
[8:47] age will quicken your spirit quicken
[8:50] your soul to recognize the Word of God
[8:54] for your day and a message for your day
[8:58] you also may be able to receive
[9:01] revelation by reading the Word of God
[9:05] aloud to yourself a simple as it sounds
[9:11] reading the Word of God faith cometh by
[9:14] hearing and hearing by the Word of God
[9:16] reading the Word of God sometimes
[9:19] allowed yourself or by listening to
[9:24] media yeah you know your your tablet or
[9:29] having it like on there that will help
[9:33] you to receive some understanding and
[9:38] revelation from the Word of God you also
[9:42] will be capable of receiving revelation
[9:47] by having seasons of prayer sweet hours
[9:52] of Prayer time for prayer in the
[9:55] presence of the Living God and ask God
[9:59] for wisdom during your time of Prayer
[10:02] like Solomon asked God for pray for
[10:06] wisdom give me understanding Lord that I
[10:09] might know what to do and how to do it
[10:13] and he asked God for wisdoms God says
[10:16] you ask something that's far above
[10:18] riches far above just power or you've
[10:23] asked for wisdom which is the most
[10:25] excellent thing it's a great thing when
[10:28] you ask God to open up your
[10:31] understanding may you ask him today and
[10:34] I believe God will answer your prayer
[10:37] and give you the wisdom and the
[10:39] knowledge the leadership that erection
[10:43] that you seek here today you also may be
[10:46] able to receive revelation by times of
[10:52] meditation times of silence Oh
[10:57] blest quietness holy quietness in the
[11:01] presence of the Living God when God can
[11:04] whisper his secrets into your soul why
[11:08] don't we just in our heart say Lord open
[11:12] the eyes of my heart
[11:13] Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to
[11:18] see thee the the word I want to see the
[11:22] word open up to my soul that I might
[11:26] recognize who you are and who I am
[11:30] o God help us here today oh yes sir
[11:34] also we receive it by meditation for the
[11:40] Bible says these are my people and they
[11:46] are also the Sheep of my pasture God
[11:49] Leighton's us to sheep now what the
[11:52] sheep do after they've eaten grass and
[11:56] they go in the quietness under a shaded
[12:00] tree somewhere and they'll begin to chew
[12:04] what we call their cud they'll they'll
[12:08] bring it back up and they'll chew that
[12:10] grass finer than when they first eat it
[12:14] so sometimes we must do that with the
[12:17] Word of God also cows do the same they
[12:21] regurgitate sit under a tree and really
[12:25] begin to chew more finally the things
[12:29] that they had eaten and here you are
[12:32] today listening to the Word of God and I
[12:36] would pray my friends that you will
[12:39] regurgitate that you will take this to
[12:42] heart
[12:43] play it again sit listen and slowly be
[12:48] able to take it in your life inculcated
[12:52] into your character let the word of God
[12:56] move richly within your soul to open up
[13:00] the gateways of your understanding that
[13:03] well did the messenger say to us long
[13:08] after I am gone
[13:09] just sit or lay there quietly in your
[13:13] room and listen to these tapes all
[13:17] friends this is advice we all should
[13:22] listen to coming from directly from God
[13:27] and profit of this hour yes sir
[13:31] believers I will encourage you to play
[13:34] play this these sermons and listen to
[13:39] them over and over and receive it into
[13:44] your soul while you are in the presence
[13:47] of the Living God because thinking of
[13:51] the word of thinking on the Word of God
[13:53] in silence opens up this supernatural
[13:58] portals of the higher dimensions in God
[14:03] and brings you to a place of a deeper
[14:08] walk where you no longer have to think
[14:11] about there about how to live and how to
[14:15] walk and what actions to take but you
[14:18] live in a state of grace you
[14:22] consistently live in a state of
[14:24] unconsciousness when the spirit of a
[14:29] mighty God flows through you without you
[14:32] having to think about any act any word
[14:36] consciously but it flows out of your
[14:39] life as your blessed entire atmosphere
[14:42] and the surroundings all around you
[14:46] absolutely so also you may receive
[14:50] revelation simply by having fellowship
[14:56] fellowshiping with your brothers and
[14:59] sisters around the revelation of the
[15:03] word create such an atmosphere and puts
[15:08] the entire group into heavenly places
[15:12] and set their minds on things above and
[15:16] god sends down revelation by the bucket
[15:22] loads or by the handfuls on purpose for
[15:26] his glory and for his honor and that
[15:30] revelation inspires and anoints the
[15:33] believer as they receive it we know also
[15:38] that you Mary
[15:40] Seve a sudden flash of revelation
[15:44] lightning from the troll of gods tricks
[15:47] your soul sometimes you're sitting in
[15:49] the church and you're listening to the
[15:52] sermon or you're listening to a
[15:54] broadcast like this and in the middle of
[15:57] it a light from heaven heavenly sunshine
[16:01] shines down upon your soul and Witten's
[16:05] the Word of God
[16:06] whenever sons and daughters of God
[16:09] gather to worship God as they did before
[16:13] the foundation of the world creating
[16:17] great noise and praising and worshipping
[16:21] God like the voice of many thundering
[16:25] waters in the presence of God when they
[16:28] rejoice job 38 verse 7 now here we see
[16:32] the very importance of fellowship
[16:35] fellowship is very important for when we
[16:40] come together he promised with two or
[16:43] three are gathered together in my name
[16:47] there am I in the midst to bless I
[16:51] believe he's here today I believe the
[16:54] Lord is flowing through this medium I
[16:57] believe the Holy Spirit is anointing
[17:00] hearts changing lives bringing men and
[17:03] women to Christ and bringing believers
[17:06] closer to Jesus Christ and bringing
[17:10] ministers even to a clearer more
[17:13] powerful understanding of the Word of
[17:16] God not because of me but because it's
[17:19] the great Holy Spirit himself making
[17:22] himself known through the opening of the
[17:25] word for one and all that are willing to
[17:28] receive the Word of God in their day and
[17:32] in their time now as we started this
[17:36] talk by giving you various definitions
[17:42] of the word quicken we found in those
[17:48] definitions that the word quicken means
[17:51] to stimulate or to excite
[17:55] interest quickly means to give or to
[17:59] restore life as in the quickening of the
[18:04] body of Jesus Christ quicken it restored
[18:08] life to the dead physical body of Jesus
[18:12] I'm applying that to thee o the Holy
[18:16] Spirit quickly the letter that kills the
[18:19] dead word and brings it to life in the
[18:23] alerts of the believer also it means the
[18:27] cause of fire to burn it if there's no
[18:33] fire my friends it's no use to sacrifice
[18:38] being on the altar as a wonderful
[18:41] brother
[18:42] priest a wonderful message no sacrifice
[18:46] no fire will fall Oh blessed be the name
[18:50] of the Lord so we need the fire we need
[18:54] the Holy Spirit we don't want or desire
[18:58] to have a dead church a dead life a dead
[19:03] walk and unexcited existence in the
[19:07] presence of the Living God but we want
[19:10] to walk with God every day and see the
[19:13] vindication of His divine presence
[19:16] working within our lives yes sir well
[19:21] did the old song says
[19:23] burn burn all his spirits burn and me
[19:27] set my soul on fire fill me with the
[19:33] Holy Ghost and God's will desire make me
[19:39] like the Christ of old healing and
[19:42] raising the dead Oh blessed be the name
[19:45] the Lord may God help every one of us
[19:48] here today to enter into the presence of
[19:52] God enter into God's inheritance of his
[19:56] word that he has sent to us through the
[19:59] Ministry of William Marion brand ham the
[20:03] prophet of God for this 20th century
[20:06] read his uh his might
[20:09] Murphy read his life story written by
[20:11] Gordon Lindsay and man sent from God
[20:15] 20th century prophet written also by
[20:20] Perry green Oh may the Living God bless
[20:24] these words to our hearts here today let
[20:27] the fire of God fall upon this word here
[20:31] today may the fire of God fall upon this
[20:36] altar and anoint the word of God fire
[20:40] fire fire fire fall on me as it was on
[20:44] the day of Pentecost made a fire of God
[20:47] fall of me may the Spirit of God search
[20:50] our hearts and burn out every trace of
[20:53] sin and bring the light and glory in now
[20:58] quicken also means to speed up it means
[21:04] to make something faster or to cause
[21:08] something to accelerate Oh blessed be
[21:13] the name of the Lord as I think of this
[21:17] I am thinking of a very popular song
[21:20] that we all love these are the days of
[21:23] Elijah these are the days of the Elijah
[21:27] oh praise God and it reminds me of
[21:31] Elijah and am first Kings chapter 17 and
[21:36] 18 is where you will find that story you
[21:39] can read it for yourself how that Elijah
[21:44] had met with me and told him after the
[21:50] great drought that they had that happen
[21:56] right on the chariot go back to Jezreel
[22:00] Oh for I hear the sound of the abundance
[22:04] of rain Oh rain is coming the Holy
[22:08] Spirit's anointing is coming the power
[22:12] of God is coming down to heal you to
[22:15] save you to deliver you to raise you up
[22:18] to vindicate his word the spirit of
[22:21] living God the rain is coming and he had
[22:25] said oh oh he's like job I'm gonna get
[22:28] there before you so he grabbed ahold of
[22:31] his reins and you know a king yes the
[22:34] best chariots he has the best horses and
[22:37] he took off in a cloud of dust heading
[22:41] towards Jezreel but the Bible says but
[22:45] the hand of the Lord the hand of the
[22:48] Lord was upon Elisha and when the Holy
[22:53] Spirit anointing fell upon the Elijah
[22:57] Elisha and all prophet the Bible says
[23:01] that Elijah outran all of Iran's chariot
[23:06] and was waiting him at the gate of Jesse
[23:10] just real because Elijah got there
[23:13] before he did think about it this the
[23:17] Spirit of God fell upon an old man and
[23:21] quickened him I'm typing that old man
[23:24] like they the ancient word of God given
[23:27] down to us and we think it's an old word
[23:30] but when the Spirit of God fell on that
[23:34] man as it falls upon the Word of God for
[23:38] this day
[23:39] two thousand years five five thousand
[23:42] years later it falls upon that word it
[23:45] brings that word alive and it quickens
[23:49] the word accelerates the movement of the
[23:52] Word of God within your heart your life
[23:55] your experience your walk your church
[23:58] life all your associations the holy
[24:01] spirit begins to animated - anointed to
[24:05] give you the seal the strength to make
[24:07] the power that you need to overcome and
[24:10] to defeat the works of the devil to
[24:13] defeat him and defeat every strategy
[24:16] that he will bring against your life so
[24:19] that no evil fiend form that gets you
[24:23] can prosper it cannot because you you
[24:26] believe and you're a child of the king
[24:29] and you
[24:30] ask God to open your eyes in all and if
[24:33] you'll take your eyes are already open
[24:35] then you need to ask him to open your
[24:38] open eyes to see more and to see further
[24:42] until you can look into tomorrow all the
[24:45] things that are going to be and see
[24:48] modern events me and make clear by
[24:51] prophecies being vindicated by the Holy
[24:55] Spirit in this day an hour how happy we
[24:58] ought to be the Holy Spirit anointing an
[25:02] old prophet type of the word quitted him
[25:06] to the point that he already had the
[25:09] pity with his chariot and horses to the
[25:13] Kings to the gates of Jezreel the hand
[25:17] of the Lord Philip came up on the Elijah
[25:21] and he outran Oh blessed be his name oh
[25:24] praise God I want to ask here today if
[25:28] it did that to an old man then what will
[25:32] the Holy Spirit do in your life in this
[25:36] day now as a young person
[25:38] what will the Holy Spirit if you
[25:41] completely and fully surrender and
[25:44] dedicate yourself with a clear
[25:47] understanding of this message and what
[25:51] it ought to do and what is doing within
[25:54] your heart and your life Oh

[26:16] leader wherever you are whoever you are
[26:19] Oh may the Spirit of God apply this word
[26:22] of God to your heart and to your soul
[26:25] and bring about a life change that will
[26:28] never be able to turn itself away well
[26:32] did the Word of God bill I just says
[26:34] look I'm I'm running up the shining way
[26:38] I'm running to jazz reels I can imagine
[26:43] had in his chariot right going down
[26:46] furiously
[26:47] and in a cloud of dust and then he sees
[26:51] another cloud of dust go by him like a
[26:55] roadrunner heading towards Ezreal it was
[26:58] the prophet Elijah anointed by the holy
[27:01] spirit of Almighty God and let me tell
[27:05] you you can do supernatural things you
[27:08] can do it all imaginable things Oh with
[27:12] the Spirit of God anointed you nothing
[27:14] is impossible with God nothing is
[27:17] impossible in your life nothing that you
[27:19] asked for that God cannot grant nothing
[27:23] that God cannot do for rigorous nothing
[27:26] impossible with the God that we serve I

[27:55] sound of the abundance of rain I can
[27:58] hear the former rain and the latter rain
[28:02] forming together combined together and
[28:05] they're falling together I can hear the
[28:09] the teaching rain and the harvest rain
[28:12] combined together I'm falling upon the

[30:10] work of God and while I'm talking to you
[30:13] all feel the quickening power I feel as
[30:16] and sense the presence of Almighty God
[30:20] moving within my heart and within my
[30:24] life it's so good to be a Christian it's
[30:27] so good to be a child of God it's so
[30:30] good to be a son or daughter of God
[30:33] being led by the Spirit of God and
[30:36] anointed by the Holy Ghost to perform
[30:39] God's will and the fulfill my purpose
[30:43] here upon the earth think of it the word
[30:48] means to accelerate quicken means to
[30:51] accelerate and Elijah surely accelerated
[30:56] pass a Habs chariot we also see
[31:03] the start of the quickening fire of God
[31:05] in Elijah's bones you will read that
[31:10] incident in second Kings chapter 13
[31:14] verses 20 to 21 weird the prophet Elijah
[31:20] had died and it came to pass as the
[31:24] Scriptures will say they buried him in a
[31:29] cave and while I was in Israel and past
[31:33] many little caves on the side of the
[31:37] road and in those caves people were
[31:40] buried because that was the ancient way
[31:43] of burying folks so Elijah's cave was
[31:48] there at the site of the road and so it
[31:53] came to pass there was a war and this
[31:56] young man was wounded and dying and no
[32:02] doubt his friends wanted to get him back
[32:05] his family tried to write quickly away
[32:07] from the enemy with this half dying man
[32:10] and it came to pass he died he died and
[32:14] to save their own life they're going to
[32:17] lessen the weight they're gonna lessen
[32:19] the Lord that they were carrying they
[32:22] threw him off of the horse and it just
[32:25] so happens he fell right on into the
[32:28] cave on top of Elijah's bones that were
[32:33] laying there
[32:35] now Elijah's bones is a type of the Word
[32:39] of God with the latent power of the Holy
[32:44] Spirit within it amen
[32:48] which my friends is release just to
[32:53] think after this man is prophet that
[32:56] died his bones were still vibrating with
[33:00] lights vibrating with resurrection power
[33:03] so that when a dead man came in contact
[33:06] with him as much as when a believers
[33:10] filled with the Holy Spirit and one who
[33:12] is dead and sins and Christmases comes
[33:15] and contact with them
[33:16] that Spirit of God is able to quicken
[33:18] the life of that person that was dead in
[33:21] sins and in trespasses and bring them to
[33:24] a supernatural life so this young man
[33:27] fell upon the bones of Elijah and soon
[33:32] the power of God struck him and the
[33:35] Bible says he punched out he came out of
[33:38] that cave and he was alive again and no
[33:41] doubt running up the road running up the
[33:44] road because the anointing struck him
[33:47] from off of that death prophet print
[33:50] bones that was their praise God
[33:53] hallelujah
[33:54] I know another prophet has gone on and I
[33:56] want to tell you if you think that his
[33:59] messages his words are all dead and it's
[34:03] gone and it's dying and everything else
[34:06] oh you just get around it you just form
[34:09] up on it you just let the Holy Spirit of
[34:13] God straight your soul but this word of
[34:15] God it will bring you to life for if
[34:18] that same spirit will quicken you to
[34:21] life again run a glory of praise of the
[34:24] Living God hallelujah I tell you friends
[34:27] no matter how they track these Deen
[34:30] deepen nations try to bury you in every
[34:34] possible way I'll tell you the Holy
[34:37] Spirit is here to quicken and raise you
[34:40] up hallelujah
[34:42] yo there's still resurrection power here
[34:45] there is still resurrection power in the
[34:49] Word of God it hasn't gone with the
[34:51] Apostles it hasn't gone with the old
[34:54] prophets I'll tell you my friends it's
[34:56] here today for is Jesus Christ the same
[35:00] yesterday today and forever the Living

[35:28] of it Oh blessed be the name of our
[35:31] living God hallelujah yes sir
[35:35] power to put you in the rapture I
[35:36] remember the quicklink bar struck Samson
[35:40] one train he picked up an old broken
[35:43] jawbone of an ass tight for the word of
[35:45] God again and smoke with that thousand
[35:50] Philistines which is a type of the
[35:52] believer under the anointing picking up
[35:55] the Word of God and as the scripture
[35:57] says one shall chase a thousand and do
[36:01] shall chase ten thousand oh we are more

[37:00] be quickened in spiritual understanding
[37:03] job was a man filled with questions job
[37:08] was the richest man of his day that has
[37:11] nothing to do with it you can be rich
[37:13] you can be intellectual you can be
[37:16] knowledgeable in things of this world
[37:18] and totally and absolutely ignorant and
[37:22] blindfolded lighted in your mind and in
[37:26] your soul to the things of the Living
[37:30] God
[37:30] you need the Spirit of God the teacher
[37:35] to come and open up your understanding
[37:38] to the Word of God
[37:40] to ask him to do so would you ask him
[37:43] Lord open up the the Gateway of my soul
[37:47] that I might recognize what you are
[37:50] saying to me from your word but I might
[37:53] not just be a reader of the world or a
[37:56] hearer of the word only but one who
[38:00] hears recognizes and acts upon the word
[38:04] and let the word come to life and
[38:06] manifestation through me job had a lot
[38:10] of questions in his life and job was
[38:13] asked can can a man by searching find
[38:17] out God then he asked who can bring a
[38:22] clean City ultimen unclean thing then he
[38:27] asked how are the dead raised up these
[38:31] questions are still be amassed and he
[38:34] also asked if a man die shall he live
[38:38] again so he was filled with questions
[38:41] John chapter 19 verses 25 around there
[38:45] the Bible tells us this great incident
[38:49] of job asking the questions and then God
[38:53] turned around and begin to ask job do
[38:57] you know how I place the earth in a
[38:59] circle - hang on nothing do you know how
[39:03] the stars are staying in their places
[39:05] and don't move until I say so
[39:08] how waters the waters are out there and
[39:12] the water is even on the heavens like
[39:14] that God began to ask him some
[39:17] soul-searching questions may you ask
[39:20] yourself some soul-searching questions
[39:23] here today and while job was listening
[39:26] to God speaking the Holy Spirit struck
[39:29] his soul that thunder rolled a lightning
[39:32] flash John said I know that my Redeemer
[39:36] liveth and shall stand upon the earth in
[39:39] the latter time seasonal job catches a
[39:41] revelation and that revelation open this
[39:44] understanding from that time when he was
[39:47] alive right to the
[39:49] the Lord where he said I know he knew
[39:52] there was a redeemer coming
[39:54] I read my Redeemer liveth and will stand
[39:57] upon your rapture second coming
[40:01] hallelujah in the latter days God turned
[40:04] him from a new body into his prophet he
[40:09] recognized his position and here he
[40:12] turned from uncertainty he turned from a
[40:17] state of presumption he turned from a
[40:20] state of uncertainty to a place where he
[40:23] could say I know where he was now
[40:27] certain of God and recognized who he was
[40:31] and what he was to do with the rest of
[40:34] his life may God help you today Saints
