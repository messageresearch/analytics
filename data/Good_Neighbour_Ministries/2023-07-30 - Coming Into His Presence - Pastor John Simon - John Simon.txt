was on some point you before [Music] yourself [Music] [Music] and then when we were on the cross we were on his mind we came from in his mind to being on his mind because we are being expressed on the earth and therefore he has to think about us we give God praise honor and glory for this opportunity of being here how many of you love the song service the worship and then you enjoy the worship praise the lord lord of God I really enjoyed it I thank God that anoint her brother and use him to lead in this wonderful worship service that we have here today amen God bless you as we enter into this marvelous and wonderful service and may this Holy Spirit bless us all together don't you want to be blessed I want to be blessed in the presence of the Lord hallelujah and um I I as we the brother was leading the worship service what uh the song leader actually does is literally tried to catch the holy spirit before he even gets in here and then the duty of the worship leader is to bring you into that presence is to bring you into that Presence by leadership through the Holy Spirit and the the songs the holy spirit will inspire right that is what it is and that is what my subject is about today uh coming into his presence Amen Let us read Psalms 100 1-5 and together let's let's read those words aloud together as we give him glory Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing knowing that the Lord he is God it is he who had made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his posture enter into his Gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth and Durant for all generations God bless us today gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for the word which we have just read now we pray father as you raise your head to heaven and you said oh I thank you O Father that you had revealed us the babes and sucklings and such as what learn but hid from the wise and The Prudent we thank you on this marvelous day father that we can come not just into the building but somehow by the worship by the leading of the word that we can break through the barriers that we can enter into that Dimension where the hearers are in the same Dimension oh God and then there Comes The Great back and forth deep calling to deep and the spirit speaking to Spirit life to life and the presence of God resting upon us as we come together Lord for one thing to raise up your glorious name to praise and magnify you and to see the wonderful things you have done for us whereof we are so glad and we give you the glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen let's say it again amen let's say hallelujah let's say it again Hallelujah let's say hallelujah the Lord he is God hallelujah God bless you please be seated the Lord is God there is no other God beside him none before him none beside him none after him he is Father Son and Holy Ghost he is the only one amen praise God we thank God for that we have no double vision or triple Vision we have one vision and that Vision as we see Jesus only and we recognize him for who he is thanks be to God Amen coming into his presence the thing about it is that we are in this age this is where we are now I'm telling you about the time we are in that we are actually in the time and season where the holy spirit is drawing us into his presence uh we are not there yet actually because the Rapture takes us there but we are slowly entering into his presence by Revelation upon Revelation break up one brick word upon word making the word clear to us and bringing us into his divine presence praise the Lord I don't know why you're here but the reason why I'm here and why there's joy within my heart because every day takes me closer to him and to home and to his divine presence praise the Lord and person when I say presence right now we are dealing with the with the uh not only the atmosphere but the spirit of the Lord but the prophet said the one who you hold you're holding your heart you don't see you just feel him but one day he'll become personalized before you he'll become a living being in front of your presence right in front of your eyes Hallelujah so I'm saying we are coming closer and closer to that and the spirit of God is taking us there I don't know about you but I heard I heard a voice I I felt a pull and it began pulling me in that direction uh I I can't help it but know that even though I may be getting older but the inside has got the same pull and even more because of the opening of the word it's pulling me closer and closer to him and I praise God for that amen hallelujah amen listen Solomon Songs of Solomon 1 verse 4 where the the bride is is calling out to the bright room and saying these words draw me and we will run after thee amen praise God hallelujah so as he pulls or attracts us amen we run after him praise the Lord and that's what I'm doing I've been running for Jesus for Allah long time and I'm not tired yet praise God I'm still running amen I'm still running because I want to come right into his divine presence praise the Lord amen yes sir so every day and every hour that we are living in brings us closer and closer to him ask us with any real king uh you just don't come as you like into the presence of a king you don't come when you want in the presence of royalty you don't come on your own terms you don't come as you desire but you've got to come to that King on the certain circumstances amen hallelujah I want you to know my brothers and sisters it's very important that we know that because we know that you must come to this King amen by first invitation you can't come without an invitation you can come to church but I'm talking about the king God himself inviting you amen inviting your soul on the inside to come closer to him and to love him and to serve him to worship him to bring glory to his name he draws you to that place where you feel full fullness of joy you feel fulfilled and you come to a perfect realization that this is your place this is your position this is the condition you're supposed to be in praising his name we have our everyday things we have to do that's just your flesh your natural being have to do those things to survive while you're down here but in your soul praise God you want to know I'm living in the presence of the king amen praise God don't you want to live in his presence every day every hour to feel his cleansing power and to know that you are living in the presence of the very King that you are serving praise God forevermore you've got to come by invitation you also got to come with preparation you just don't come anyway but you come by invitation Hallelujah Were you invited into his presence that invitation only comes to those who were in his mind before the foundation of the world it goes out to The Cry goes out to everyone whosoever will makeup just come so so the god the cry goes out everybody believes they they can be saved everybody believes the blood was shed for them everybody believes that they can come like they want to come and you you can come but you must come to the King by invitation you've got to have a token you've got to have an invitation something that shows you've been invited to this Feast for this party to this wedding supper uh other than that you have nothing but praise God we know that he planted that within our hearts so we feel different in here than every other individual let me feel religious they may feel they have to got theological explanations they got to come to him by reasoning they got to reason it out and analyze it and debate it before they can have a perfect stand of which they can take but we don't come that way we don't come by reason all I know is I feel the Paul I hear a voice I recognize the day my hour and the power of the spirit of almighty God working within my soul amen oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen praise God we find out that we've got to come with the proper approach as the prophet said there is an approach to God and you may want to come your own way but God has a provided way and God has a way of approach that you must come to him every King every royalty has that same way that we must come in the presence of God hallelujah amen yes sir so I want you to know this is the hour that we are coming more and more closely into the presence of the Lord like Paul puts it this way he says you're in the church but you may not recognize it but the word revealed to you is the glory of God being made known and he is saying you are going to move from Glory into Glory into glory and it's going to get so high one day you have walked right into the Glory Hallelujah you're not of work you are of Heaven you are not of mankind you are of God's kind Hallelujah you are not here just to be a man a woman live eat die but your sons and daughters of the Living God that come from the very presence of the Eternal one and you return back to Eternal where you come from amen yes sir praise the name of the Lord amen now I want to use uh here the the story of Esther which you can find that in the Book of Esther and mainly around chapters two and four but you can read that book of Esther and you will see there how that vasty the queen who was the queen at that time married to a authorus the king and how she was there and uh of course that woman got her power from him because he was King that is why she was respected as Queen but she start to feel because she has power wealth and royalty I I do this on my own I got all this yeah I I just done it so so after a while he called for her and she's rebelling against him don't want to hear so he says okay that's it I put her away and I need to find a wife that listened to me and so he said go throughout the land and get all the beautiful virgins that you think I may like and bring them and then I will make much I will make my choice they're not going to choose me I'm going to choose them praise the Lord you didn't choose him he chooses you you don't come to this altar now and say I take Jesus you don't just take him you don't take who you want and marry them no he attacks you and he has come to take us praise God hallelujah praise the Lord so here it is he said I'll choose who I want so Esther was brought to the palace and she was put into the care of some eunuchs of course we don't want to preach on that that's another subject spiritual eunuchs these men that were were in a state where they were of no danger to the women around them they didn't need anything from them they didn't want anything from them all they want to do is the will of the king amen they had no seat of their own that they could plant so they they just did the will of God Amen and a real man of God that's what he's here it's not the plant himself in your heart but to plant the word of God in your heart to plant the revelation of the holy spirit in your soul so that you look to Jesus and see Jesus only amen lift it up high and mighty you have a lasting God Amen yes sir praise God forevermore so so then they were brought to the eunuch and the the Bible says here and the you not gave to them things for their purification their beautification and their preparation he provided to them the things that they needed amen that is what the real minister of God does provides you the word but if you have to take the word and apply into your life he is not going to come and do everything for you you've got to do it yourself amen you've got to apply the token to you by yourself after you receive it to yourself amen and so those she took what they gave her and started to prepare herself amen oh praise God I want you to know that even as she did that amen God gave her grace amen praise God God gave her grace and so they were doing what they were making themselves all ready amen do you know the denominations are making ready for the rapture do you know there were 10 virgins you know five were wise and five were foolish yet there were all virgins righteous people good people good people they just haven't caught the revelation of the word of God and they're giving it denominational applications which are not in line with the purpose and promise for this day and for this hour to fulfill Revelation 10 7 Malachi 4 5. no sir they're not there with that whatsoever and so she began to prepare but an interjection into this story how that on the other hand the Jews existence were being challenged and there would have been exterminated and so her uncle sends to her a message telling her don't think because you are queen and you're up in the palace you're going to escape this so you'd better go in and see the King right you'll find it right in your Bible in the Book of Esther and she answered him and said but as you know according to the laws none can approach the King on their own unless my invitation if the king doesn't give you an invitation and you try to go in to see him the guards will kill you you will be killed you cannot come on your own you've got to come by your recognition praise the Lord God's holy spirit telling you that this is something totally different amen and so she said fast and pray for me because I've got to get into the presence of the king amen I trust you will have that kind of hunger answers that you want to live in the very presence of the king amen and if I perish let me perish but I've got to see the king amen I've got to see what I read in this Bible I got to see the Holy Ghost I've got to see the power of God I've got to see the presence of God I've got to experience the god of Heaven amen if I perish let me perish but I'm going to see the king amen yes sir and so she began to fast and and pray to see the king amen and so we find out that the she she asked you not to take her in the presence of the king he said well I'll take your butt you know the Lord you can live or die amen because no man comes to the king accept him who he will stretch forth his scepter Hallelujah God has to give you the revelation God has to stretch forth his Supernatural hand and give you the word for this day and for this hour if he doesn't do that you cannot spiritually come you may physically come but physically you cannot come amen only by the king reaching out look you come by invitation you come by the king's reaction praise the Lord God reacting to you and you're going to see that if you're a True Believer and you genuinely believe the word you're gonna start to see little inclinations little intimations little little things that will begin to make them make you become conscious yes God is dealing with me as an individual I I I see him in my life I see him in my walk I see him at whatever I do nobody else may see it but he wants you to know that he's dealing with you and for you to see it and for you to recognize it [Applause] while I was thinking on these things I remember one time was with my father when he was alive walking in the jungles of Guyana real jungles not not little woods like these but behind every Bush and every shrub could be a a jaguar or a big python or something you've got to be alert and there were people a few Hunters with guns but that were there but you still need to be alert because just brushing a leaf might be a green little snake that can and and that's it so so you're you better be alert so uh that's why I said even now for me to go back there I can't survive because the senses that oh my they've got to be there so anyway I can go in the city maybe and even there I gotta be careful because you got other snakes and other animals in the Concrete Jungle but there my brothers they were hunting and I was just looking around and while I'm looking around all of a sudden the wind blew and the leaves because that I should explain to you the canopy of these leaves makes down there like Twilight it's almost dark you can see but it's still not light and the wind blue and the some of the leaves move and a shaft of sunlight came from way up top and down into the jungle and it came right on an orchid that was hanging on one of those trees and it was so beautiful amen natural and beautiful and I said wow look at that my hair and I you know I just turned the call and as I turned to call the thought let me put it that way it said that's for you to see that's not for anyone else and after you're gone from here that Orchid is no more it'll just wither up and gone nobody else will ever see it but that was for you and that's what I'm trying to tell you God will make known to you amen of his own it's not even I'm telling you just as to help you but I it's not me gonna open your eyes not nobody can nobody can not my mother not my father not my sister not my brother not the Deacon not the pastor nobody but God himself Hallelujah can open up your heart open up your eyes amen yes sir and so individually God begins to deal with us Amen in that way you know the rest of the story how that she went in the presence of the king and the King found out what was happening behind his back and how uh this spell the fellow was hanged amen right Haman was hanged because of what he was doing but I want you to see that you come coming into his presences By Invitation by Divine approach it's by God's reaction and acceptance of you as his own praise the name of the Lord that's how we come in the presence of the king amen praise the Lord now I just briefly want to mention to you here that if you in the Old Testament if you wanted to come into the presence of a God or the presence of the king you have to come to the Tabernacle and when you came to the Tabernacle the Tabernacle had an outer Court an inner Court and the holy of holies which held of course the great Ark of the Covenant the pillar of fire the two cherubim so the pure fire hanging in between them and so on behind the veil made of badger skins good skins and so on praise the Lord but that's how they had to approach God remember this outside was the wide world and then if you had some kind of a religious belief you may make it into the outer Court all right because you at least you got a religious belief you you believe in something or some God or or you feel that you should live a better life or something so you you'll come into the outer court right but then when you come into the outer Court then you find out that that outer court that you're living in there there was a uh like uh in there when you come in with a basin which you had to take some water begin to wash yourself you right before you come in the presence of God remember that's you washing yourself I don't want to go into all of these things even just you washing yourself that's not God washing you yet you just washing up yourself the best you know how to come in the presence of the Living God Amen but when you are in there in that outer Court even when you come to the inner Court you're still going by daylight you're still going by Moonlight and starlight and you're going by all those lights coming on you uh the best that you know how but you see when you enter into the holy of holies it was so enclosed with these Badger skins that were like about six inches or more thick Badger skins and goat skins of stuff like that that were put up there praise God that there was no natural light in there and no uh sounds were penetrating in there it was just the quiet presence of the pillar of fire which represented the presence of almighty God that was right there in between the two cherubims that were there on the Ark of the Covenant and the Ten Commandments were in the ark right oh my and the pillar of fire was hanging right above that like that amen praise God I want you to see that picture and understand this let me quote here now look civilization travels with the Sun from the East to the West this is an oriental Bible the Bible is an oriental book do you believe that see and now we find when the Great Pentecostal church was inaugurated great signs and wonders followed it upon the basis of the shed blood and the Holy Ghost going forward with great signs amen then you know after the Pentecostal age then come the next Church Age come in then that begins to dwindle out and then it went Plumb on down till it went down through 1500 years of Dark Ages amen then it started coming up again what it's never been light since the Pentecostal day amen certainly not the sun rose and gave its light it's been a day long for the breaking of the daylight when the sun come up then it went dim and dimmed out and dimmed and dimmed but the prophet said there will be a day amen that can't be day or night a kind of a day that's smoky oh my cloudy time aren't we living in a cloudy time my goodness lies are everywhere chaos is everywhere you don't know what to believe you can hardly see clearly anything that you want to do you you got to think carefully if you'll use a computer you know that even an email is not just normal you've got to watch carefully it might be look like an email from a friend and it could be an email from a deadly enemy it can be what's up whatever it is but you dealing with these things you see something saying now this is something comes from the government CRA and you have been given so many uh dollars back from the government but you need first to send us your information so that we know where to send it right see everywhere it's a cloudy day it's a time of chaos one one of the Apostles said in the last days perilous time shall come perilous times shall come very deceiving hour that we are living living in while this the deceiving Rider is riding black nor white neither black nor white just a mixed up mixed up uh uh melange of everything that is on the face of the Earth right now likewise everything is calling itself Christian mixed up with this mixed up mixed up mixed up all mixtures it's just coming up and saying oh I'm a Christian oh I do I'm a Christian because I cried when I went to the altar no that's not the Bible oh I'm a Christian because they made the sign of the cross in my forehead with holy water I became a Christian then no it doesn't work that way either oh I became a Christian because I shook the superintendent's hand when he welcomed me into the fellowship yeah that's not the scripture either oh no sir oh I was a Christian long before that the moment I was baptized in the spiritual Sanctus demons businesses I became a Christian right then I didn't even know I was a Christian but I still became one because I was baptized see not the Bible because the Bible tells us baptism Jesus went down into the water then it says John the Baptist took him and put him under the water then the Bible says he coming up out of the water amen pray oh my goodness I I want to see you do that in a little baptismal thing that they usually have but the point is that everyone the devil has created such confusion he's creating so many counterfeits that has created confusion in the minds of the people you don't know in which direction to go neither do they know who to listen to but thank God God places something in the hearts of True Believers that they recognize who they are amen and the spirit of God leads them and guides them praise God that we walk in the light of this day and of this hour by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah listen amen a day that can't be damned night Smoky clothing there's been enough light on the gospel and still they wouldn't believe the Lord and be saved amen oh my it's been out there bright on the Eastern world I'm jumping over a few things here right like that at Pentecost as the sun is going down it's shining right on the Western People a day of light again it shall will be light in the evening time the path to Glory you will surely find we have found it I said I have found it I found the path to Glory as the prophet said we have entered the vestibule of Heaven amen I've entered the foyer of Heaven just before you walk into the presence of the king amen oh it's wonderful here what will it be like when we cross over there amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen yes sir now in these last days where God's pouring out the sunlight upon the people like this and God caught my attention right there not just pouring out his Spirit as in Pentecost but now is the hour when he is pouring out sunlight sunlight Revelation on the word is being poured out upon us and it's the abundance of this Revelation my friends that prepares us makes the bride able to prepare taking these Revelations you are able to prepare yourself and come into the presence of almighty God Amen Hallelujah do you see that you understand what I'm trying to say amen glory be to God Amen yes sir o praise God yes sir so he's doing this upon the evening like people just before the dark amen the blackout that the prophet already uh predicted now let's go into this a little bit more is that okay now another thing this is the next quote from the hidden life another thing we will call your retention just before we close look at the light on the outside in the courts it was the firmament lit up and so forth some days what cloudy days some days the sun didn't shine at all see oh my some days it was dark that's all happened in the outer Court the next court amen was the lamp of God where the Justified stands amen praise God and it was lit by human hands he's talking about the seven candlesticks right that was in the inner court amen and the priests had to go light those amen you know the representation of that the seven the way back in the Old Testament cast for casting the Shadows of the seven Messengers coming the church ages and so on it was already showing itself in the Old Testament in that Tabernacle casting forth the truth of the coming of these Servants of the Living God and these seven ages of the church which were hidden from Satan under these signs and symbols that are in the word of God Amen now praise God this is where the Justified stand and it is led by human hands and that's where we argue our denominations where we argue our differences uh praise the Lord I I hope you deacons are alert and understand praise the Lord and make sure that people folks moving around you know where they are and what they're doing and that maybe they're not just downstairs or up you know wherever moving things around just be sure about things like that you got to be aware amen praise the Lord now you see I don't be one say they split tears argue on differences I don't believe Divine Healing I don't believe Visions come from God I don't believe this I don't believe that arguing because you see you're eating Manna but you are living under an artificial light amen we are not here to live under artificial lights we are here to live under the light of God's word and of his spirit amen yes sir praise God now sometimes the light goes out sometimes your lamp gets smoked up praise God how many knows about God your lamp gets smoked up amen he knows what he's talking about because he lived poor in the countryside where the people will put some oil in a bottle and stick a rag inside and light the top and we call those a Speak Easy lamp and so and so yeah they smoke up the place and things like that and if you did have uh what you call the the lampshade if you did have one of those and you put it over it it would be a little better but the shade after a while becomes smoked up Smoky and it has to be washed and cleansed before you use it again amen so that's what he's talking about here amen saying you living under an artificial light and light goes out sometimes the lamp gets smoked up but but he who desires to hide away walk

weakness at God deliberately you get to that state where you're weak you're everything is going in that direction but then he is strong through you he is able to make himself strong through you because you are weak you don't you don't you're not heavy you're not high-minded you're not this anymore you don't have none of that stuff because he's able to flow his word amen thank God for that message amen when you are weak then he is strong in weakness there is strength praise God hallelujah come coming into his divine presence amen praise the Lord now I'm not going to use all of these but uh brother the brothers have these quotes sitting in the back if you want to have a copy of them you can have them I've quoted from the hidden life I quoted from a message called Christ amen they're beautiful and I trust that you should read them don't just listen and hear me say it and forget about it amen be a blessing to your soul praise God I just want to be sure that you get this amen clearly you find out here he spoke hidden life I think I told you that and then in this yes the hidden life with Christ he preached the message more than once and once it's called The Hidden life then it's called hidden life with Christ and you should check up these but the brother has a copy of these quotations you can get a copy from him and you can read them for Yourself Praise the Lord in the court out of court holy of holies praise the Lord now when you come into the presence of the king I want you to know in the presence of the king is life is that right because when they brought Aaron's Rod now you know Aaron used to walk around with a rod that's not the walking stick but a rod and the rod was a piece of a Akia tree they cut off and you know cleaned it up and use that as a run it was dead but when they're brought that rod and left it in the presence of God overnight the Bible tells us when they come in the morning it was an almond tree story but when it came in the morning it's this side started to Blossom it started to live again that dead piece of wood amen I don't care what a dead what you were or I was but when the Holy Spirit comes on your life by the opening of the word god starts to bring life you start to bloom some of you are blooming right in front of my eyes some of you are blossoming right in front of my eyes some of you are maturing in front of my life some of you are bringing forth fruit already right in front of my eyes and I give God praise for that amen somebody say Amen accept praise the Lord let's give glory and praise to the Living God wherever you may be amen May the spirit of God bless you amen yes sir hallelujah amen Aaron's rug began budding who life is in the presence of almighty God Amen Hallelujah another thing is that they had what was called the shoe brand and the shoe bread was some of that manner that was uh made given to them and he said Gather some of that and put it in a pot and that part is to be brought and placed in the presence of the Lord amen so they brought that pot and they brought it right in the presence of almighty God Amen praise the Lord and brother sister I want you to know that a whole when they brought that pot they it never went stale it didn't go stale it remained there fresh like on the first day take God and I'm so glad that's the word that we have received here today amen because that word was in the presence of almighty God given to a prophet and now we're getting it fresh like the first day amen same word of God fresh like on the first day many many insights and things that you can see from this but you need to deal with that yourself amen never spoil Amen Let Me Tell You friends this hair will never become a denomination I don't mean this local church I'm talking about the word and as long as this local church remains with the Revelation where it can never denominate and that word will keep you that way and preserve you until the very end amen another thing is uh like any King when you come in the presence of almighty God Amen Hallelujah that you can't just come in just with emotions you just can't come in just uh you know because you're on fire therefore that's your spiritual no because in the Bible if you will search it you'll find that some um uh some men of Israel thought they could come in the presence of the Living God because the priest went in with a little censor which lots of people are trying to copy the same thing but the sensor with a little fire in it you come in the presence of God with incense and there he would do his high Priestly duties amen if he was in sin he dropped dead right there if he wasn't he wouldn't be allowed to come back out but he would go in like that but there were other men that wanted to go in the presence of God and they said he putting some fire and incense he's a man like me I put my own incense and they made up their own incense and light it up and and two of them I believe and walk into the presence of God and of course they were struck dead and God was saying you don't come in here with Strange Fire right Strange Fire look in the Bible you're going to find God Strange Fire yes you're on fire but that's a strange fire that fire don't take you to the word that fire is pointing you to a trinity that fire is pointing you to everything else but it's not pointing you to the word praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen my brother sister I'll tell you what are we living in when we Rejoice here it's the real thing amen but a lot of them come with Strange Fire they get a convention Strange Fire all the places on fire everybody's shouting and everything else but the shout of the king what is that it's not in the camp The Cry of the king is not in the camp but yet there is noise noise why they're bowing down to a golden calf they're bowing down to a golden calf Moses not even off the mountain with the word and they're screaming and shouting well I got the word here how can it be there the same no you see Strange Fire amen so a man May preach me on fire that's not it listen watch what he's saying and let the Holy Spirit apply that to your heart unto your soul amen praise the name of the Lord amen coming into his presence of course we're talking about uh coming into the king's chamber you know that's not a way of saying you're coming into the king's chamber and uh you know to come in the king's chamber in the in the pyramid up there that they drop there you had steps to go up those seven steps to get into the king's chamber and at each step there was a guard you know type of the some Messengers there was a guard you just couldn't go in there only who were coming by invitation I thank God that we have taken those seven steps amen and now we have stepped into the little room praise God under the anointing of the Holy Spirit to meet what to meet with the King Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen yes sir how wonderful to know I'm going to start to wind some some of this up praise the Lord amen no I want to bring to your attention you must come in the king's presence and you must come with faith in that right come with faith because remember in the New Testament the woman that came and she touched the Hem of His Garment but sometimes to come to the presence of Lord you've got to come true relatives talking all kinds of stuff you got to come through crowds of people criticizing you you gotta press your way through massive of masses of unbelief and obstruction you gotta push your way right through there before you could come into His presence amen but when should come to his presence she just barely touched the Hem of His Garment now he brings her in this presence and he turns around and says who touched me and now he invites her to come into His presence oh praise God isn't it wonderful oh praise God that we have a touch from God hallelujah we touched him and he touched us and we are here today as the evidence of who we are Sons and Daughters of the Living God blessed be the name of the Lord God is good I said God is good he's a revealer of the word amen amen I want to praise God I don't care my friends what issue you may have in your life this woman was suffering from what an issue of blood oh my issue of blood blood life all right so what issues do you have in your life here today what issues Jesus it doesn't matter what issue you have what issue you're dealing with right now right now you may be dealing with an issue but regardless of what that issue is amen just Reach Out And Touch the Lord and if you touch him Hallelujah your issue will be gone the Bible says deceased instantly by the grace of almighty God God can settle every issue that comes within your your life Matthew 7 24 there was a woman who had a daughter she was grievously troubled by devils and she came to Jesus when she came to Jesus to pray for him to pray and he turned around and the same gentle Jesus that people believe is so gentle he turned around and says woman is not becoming fit for me to give the children's bread to dogs you know what he did he called her a dog this is loving Jesus that usually paints so gentle is loving and kind they don't realize that with that Comfort comes correction is that right and that he is a God that's a both a dove and a screaming eagle he's a lion but yet he's a lamb depends on what he has to declare in the hour and the time that we're in praise God so here we turn does not fit together children bread to the dogs right but really he wanted reaction he wanted a reaction to the word amen sometimes we do that we talk to somebody we quote a little bit of the word or say quote from the prophet waiting for a reaction right and she said but Lord even the dogs eat some of the crumbs amen I don't I'm not asking you Lord in other words for a whole loaf I'm not asking for the whole thing just just even though I can get some crumbs coming off of the Masters table amen he says oh woman great is your faith go thy way thy daughter is made whole amen and that daughter was made hold from that instant praise the Lord no matter what your situation just raise your hands Lord drop down some handfuls on purpose for me say Lord I need some crumbs here today I need a slice today here praise God Amen and your whole situation your whole life will change your relationships will change oh my praise God hallelujah amen praise the Lord um isn't that wonderful I'm thinking of Zacchaeus he wanted to come in the presence of the Lord but he couldn't come he was too short uh he wanted to come to the presence of the Lord but he found he had a complex it was a guilt complex uh and physically he was too short he had done some robbing uh and fudging figures as a tax collector and stuff like that and it was bothering his conscience and he didn't want to just come in the presence of the Lord like that so he climbed up a tree right many of us climb up trees uh you know now praise the Lord so I'm going to describe those trees somebody else could describe the various trees that you could come up down amen praise the Lord and and Jesus passed by and says Zacchaeus come down out of the tree calm down let me go home and have lunch with you here I will must eat at your house today praise God and sometimes God got to call some of us down from our high horse just like he did with Paul and knock him off the high horse take you off with a high tree and brought him down sometimes we have to do that if we want to come in the presence of God regardless of our situation whether we're down and out when we're up and away with success God calls from both sides of the spectrum and just say come on to me Ollie that labor and I have a laden I will give your rest and God calls us to Humble ourselves to have faith in his word faith in this promises trust in his grace and he will bring us True Praise the name of the Lord blessed be his wonderful and His Marvelous name praise God I trust today that
