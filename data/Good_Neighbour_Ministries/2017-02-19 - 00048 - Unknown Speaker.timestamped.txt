[22:13] to
[22:13] everyone and we'll be hearing from him
[22:18] on Sunday but tonight we're here by the
[22:21] grace of God and those that are here
[22:24] were the ones God wanted to be here
[22:26] they're the ones God is going to bless
[22:28] tonight tonight and give some kind of
[22:32] encouragement through the word of God
[22:34] because I can only um bring to you what
[22:38] the Lord has given me but if you've got
[22:41] faith tonight then you're going to get
[22:43] something a lot more than what you could
[22:46] possibly get from me and on Wednesday
[22:49] nights we do Bible
[22:51] study and um so uh these are
[22:55] opportunities where you can use these
[22:59] messages and again I remind you that
[23:02] they are uploaded to our website they're
[23:05] very current now we we've got somebody
[23:08] that um has dedicated themselves sister
[23:10] Patricia has dedicated herself to um
[23:14] following up on the messages being sure
[23:16] that she gets them that they're being
[23:19] recorded and then get put up to our
[23:22] website so you can use these types of
[23:24] messages on the Wednesday nights they're
[23:26] great opportunities for Bible study for
[23:29] teachings current teachings okay you
[23:32] know it's one thing to bring Bible
[23:34] studies that you can get all kinds of
[23:36] Bible studies you can go online and pick
[23:39] up all kinds of Bible studies but it's a
[23:40] lot different when you're studying the
[23:43] word of God according to the day and the
[23:47] message that God is giving in the
[23:50] present season it's a lot different and
[23:53] this is the one thing that you know that
[23:55] we need to understand that um when we're
[23:58] testifying we're not testifying
[24:01] of just Bible History we're testifying
[24:05] of what God is doing
[24:08] now this is Christianity amen right it's
[24:13] Christ in his church a lot of people
[24:16] forget that it's Christ in his church in
[24:20] the present stage of his ministry
[24:23] remember the Bible is a book of
[24:26] Prophecy it is God for 4,000 years of
[24:30] history in the Old
[24:32] Testament 2,000 years of
[24:35] history in the New Testament from the
[24:39] arrival of Jesus Christ to the present
[24:42] day but
[24:44] yet in that history there's prophecy
[24:48] amen that's right and within that
[24:50] prophecy we need to be able to see the
[24:53] hour the time and the season of what God
[24:55] is going to do in the day that were to
[24:58] me oh
