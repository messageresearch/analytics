[44:13] before and it's found in matthew chapter
[44:16] 17 verses 9 to 13 which we will stand
[44:21] and read once we have found it
[44:25] in our bibles and i pray when you leave
[44:28] here you'll leave uh with
[44:31] thoughts in your heart
[44:33] which you can read regurgitate
[44:36] like brother branham said the the sheep
[44:39] just doesn't eat and stop there they go
[44:42] and sit somewhere quiet under a tree or
[44:44] something and they bring it up and they
[44:47] chew it again praise the lord so that's
[44:49] what i'm saying to you that once you've
[44:51] heard the word of god that you will
[44:55] chew it again praise the lord i hold the
[44:58] bible in my hand but i have the text
[45:00] written here
[45:02] in larger letters matthew 9
[45:05] 17 9 to 13 praise the lord
[45:11] and as they came down from the mountain
[45:14] jesus charged them saying tell the
[45:18] vision to no man
[45:21] until
[45:22] the son of man
[45:24] be risen
[45:26] amen
[45:27] that's when you're going to tell the
[45:29] vision
[45:30] that's when you're going to make it
[45:31] plain
[45:33] and his disciples asked him saying
[45:38] why then
[45:39] say the pharisees
[45:41] that elias must first come
[45:45] and jesus answered them and said unto
[45:47] them elias truly shall first come
[45:52] and restore all things
[45:55] but i say unto you
[45:58] that lies
[46:00] is come already
[46:03] and
[46:04] they didn't recognize their daenerys
[46:06] message
[46:09] they knew him not
[46:12] but have done unto him
[46:14] whatsoever they listed
[46:18] likewise
[46:19] shall also
[46:21] the son of man
[46:23] suffer of them
[46:25] that was the coming of the son of man
[46:28] the first time
[46:29] and now
[46:30] we are in the next
[46:32] the coming of the son of man for this
[46:35] time
[46:36] praise the lord
[46:38] and then as this last verse says
[46:40] then the disciples understood
[46:43] he spoke unto them
[46:46] of john the baptist
[46:48] amen
[46:49] now we understand
[46:52] that he is speaking since back then
[46:55] about this prophet
[46:57] coming here
[46:59] in that spirit of elijah to fulfill the
[47:02] same word of god
[47:04] as it was back then
[47:06] god bless you let us pray
[47:09] uh for help to be deliver the word and
[47:12] to hear the word our gracious heavenly
[47:15] father
[47:16] we know according to your words
[47:20] as we ask your spirit to take a hold
[47:24] not so much for healing lord
[47:27] but we pray that the holy spirit will
[47:31] take a hold of our souls
[47:34] anoint the speaker and anoint our ears
[47:38] that we may hear the word of god
[47:41] and more so father we don't come here
[47:44] for just the wonderful works of god but
[47:48] for to enjoy
[47:50] uh and to soak ourselves in the sun of
[47:52] your presence
[47:54] may the holy spirit take the word shine
[47:58] the light that we may walk upon this
[48:01] pathway into the glory of god
[48:04] in jesus name we ask it now
[48:07] amen and amen may the lord bless you
[48:11] please be seated
[48:13] where you are
[48:16] [Music]
[48:19] i'm quoting brother branham speaking
[48:22] from
[48:24] redeemer
[48:26] and redemption
[48:28] san fernando california
[48:33] now listen close
[48:36] he said their homelands israel has got
[48:39] food
[48:40] so i must go back home
[48:43] and naomi kissed her daughter-in-laws
[48:47] and told them goodbye
[48:50] and so arfa a type of the
[48:54] church
[48:55] normally
[48:57] nominally the church formal
[49:00] was willing to kiss her mother-in-law
[49:05] goodbye
[49:06] she
[49:07] she was craving the things of the world
[49:11] and the
[49:12] all-formal life she used to have
[49:16] and turned right back to her idols
[49:20] because her mother-in-law
[49:23] had
[49:24] like kissed her
[49:26] and
[49:27] brother brandon says there and
[49:29] discouraged her just a little
[49:32] by saying
[49:34] both of them now i'm too old to have
[49:36] children
[49:37] if i would be married again and have
[49:39] children would you wait for them
[49:42] you know what that was back then the
[49:45] tradition was that um
[49:48] if one of the daughter-in-laws or the
[49:50] sons died
[49:53] then that daughter-in-law who now lost
[49:55] her husband
[49:57] um if the mother would have another son
[50:01] that is free
[50:03] she would then marry that
[50:06] son
[50:07] so what are what naomi is saying
[50:10] i'm already old
[50:13] i really can't get children but if the
[50:15] lord did bless me and i did get one
[50:19] would you be willing to wait
[50:21] till that boy or whatever grow up
[50:25] well
[50:26] brother branham is saying here that in a
[50:28] nice way she was discouraging her
[50:31] right it was a nice way of her
[50:34] discouraging her uh uh not to wait why
[50:37] are you gonna wait praise god hallelujah
[50:41] but you see that is the very type
[50:44] of believers following this message
[50:46] today
[50:49] and a lot of things as we have quoted
[50:53] the quote from unveiling of god when he
[50:55] said a lot of the things that i have
[50:58] said and done
[51:01] god has deliberately allowed me to say
[51:05] it
[51:05] and do
[51:06] it to deliberately discourage them
[51:12] to cause some to even leave the message
[51:15] and go back
[51:17] go out
[51:18] and at the same time what i'm saying
[51:22] will cause some to come in
[51:25] amen
[51:26] some gonna be blinded some gonna go
[51:29] wandering someone gonna be discouraged
[51:32] and turn away from it uh the message is
[51:34] too rough it's too crude it's too
[51:37] critical it's it's you know they're
[51:40] going to see all kinds of points
[51:42] amen
[51:43] but it's all set that way because it
[51:47] will cause the elected to come in even
[51:50] closer to him the word
[51:53] and to know him in the power of his
[51:55] spirit hallelujah amen see
[51:59] they come to the message and god will
[52:02] allow some little thing
[52:04] some little happening to occur in the
[52:06] church or in the message deliberately to
[52:10] cause them to get discouraged
[52:13] then they have a legitimate excuse now
[52:17] that they can say oh this happened in
[52:19] the church
[52:20] or that happened with that brother or
[52:23] this sister or this thing took place and
[52:27] they have you can't say a thing about it
[52:30] because it's legitimate
[52:32] and but it was designed to god allow it
[52:35] to happen so they can turn back
[52:38] they can go back
[52:40] so some go right back to the world right
[52:43] you say back to the world that don't
[52:45] mean go drinking smoking and whatever
[52:47] that's like that and then they go back
[52:49] to the world because they're craving
[52:51] success
[52:53] you can go back to the world because
[52:55] they're craving you know i i gotta i
[52:58] gotta get a big house like everybody
[52:59] else
[53:00] i've got to get this i gotta get that
[53:02] they gotta accomplish this uh you know
[53:05] various they're not willing to
[53:08] cast down their crowns of achievement
[53:10] and ambition
[53:12] at the foot of the savior at the foot of
[53:14] the lamb they're not willing to cast all
[53:17] of that down and to about them and give
[53:20] him praise and honor and glory amen that
[53:24] rather the praises of the world
[53:26] they're rather than their
[53:28] accomplishments in the world oh what a
[53:31] great woman oh what a great man oh look
[53:34] what she done look what they prefer that
[53:37] brother
[53:38] hallelujah because when you come in the
[53:41] church it's not like that doesn't matter
[53:43] who you are doesn't how much what you
[53:45] got you're just another brother
[53:48] you're just another sister
[53:51] is that right
[53:52] no but some don't want to be treated
[53:54] that way they want to be treated with
[53:56] you must recognize what
[53:58] uh what what what i have done i become
[54:02] a doctor i become uh my god my masters
[54:05] now i am a lawyer i'm this i'm that no
[54:08] you see once you can't break that veil
[54:12] and understand
[54:13] that that soul man that's inside
[54:16] jesus said all on the same level same
[54:20] pay doesn't matter what time of day you
[54:23] come in doesn't matter how much work you
[54:25] done or didn't do it's his right to pay
[54:29] everybody whatever he wants to pay them
[54:35] and the pay is salvation
[54:38] the pain is your redemption
[54:41] the pain is that heavenly rapture and
[54:44] grace that will take you in the presence
[54:46] of god
[54:47] hallelujah
[54:49] oh
[54:50] boasting oh i've been in the message for
[54:52] 40 years that don't mean that to god
[54:57] i don't mean he doesn't respect it but
[55:00] that doesn't give him a twist in any
[55:02] sense of partiality
[55:04] because a young boy a young girl can
[55:07] just come in just come in
[55:09] like chemical titus just come in
[55:13] and they just come into work for one
[55:15] hour
[55:16] and according to the bible pay them the
[55:18] same pay as those who start in the
[55:20] morning
[55:21] and they're going to turn to him and say
[55:23] master that's not fair i've been working
[55:27] all day i've been working 40 years in
[55:30] this message and look she just came in
[55:32] or he just came in and all of a sudden
[55:35] the spirit of god is moving on them and
[55:38] using them and people are forgetting me
[55:41] you see
[55:42] same pain
[55:44] it doesn't matter who we are
[55:46] it's his grace and mercy that we are
[55:50] serving him and praising god for
[55:53] our foot turned right back and went back
[55:55] to her idols
[55:58] and there's a lot of people are turning
[56:00] back and going back to their old idols
[56:04] brother branham said he says you know
[56:06] uh uh lotsa are going to uh be blinded
[56:10] they're gonna miss things because what
[56:12] they're looking at dignitaries
[56:16] they're looking at dignitaries right in
[56:19] this message
[56:21] their eyes are blinded by dignitaries
[56:24] god bless our brothers
[56:27] wherever they are because god bless them
[56:29] they can't help that amen
[56:32] that's what leadership is after a while
[56:34] people start
[56:36] looking up to you but the point is when
[56:38] you encourage that
[56:41] when you exploit that
[56:43] when you allow that to start to consume
[56:46] the hearts of the people and like
[56:48] brother branham would say oh no brother
[56:50] i'm not this i am not that he always
[56:52] seemed to be like he's putting down
[56:54] himself out of that office when he is
[56:56] the one that could have really put his
[56:58] hands and and say do you know who i am
[57:02] i'm the prophet of malachi 4.
[57:07] but he didn't do that
[57:09] oh don't say that sister
[57:11] don't say that brother amen he's the one
[57:14] running from it and other ones want to
[57:17] run into it
[57:18] amen is that right my friends if you
[57:21] know what's good for you run for your
[57:23] life and stay away from anything like
[57:25] that
[57:26] you
[57:27] god is always hides in simplicity
[57:32] you hear he hides
[57:35] he makes a deliberate attempt to hide
[57:39] hides in simplicity
[57:41] but that same hiding reveals himself
[57:45] praise god hallelujah
[57:48] i pray that you uh from a simple
[57:51] appearing simple message like this
[57:54] you'll be able to be able to see god
[57:55] making himself known within the word of
[57:58] god hallelujah
[58:00] she was going back to her old idols all
[58:03] the things that she used to love and
[58:06] you know she'd used to embrace and stuff
[58:08] like that back to her old mother
[58:12] is that right that was a literal matter
[58:14] now but now this is
[58:16] the spiritual mother now there's a lot
[58:18] of believers turning back to their old
[58:19] religious mother
[58:22] you know some gone back to their mother
[58:24] church where the fronts at least they
[58:26] had more order
[58:29] right
[58:30] because they preaching conduct order and
[58:32] doctrine but they don't have a system
[58:35] they don't have they don't have a
[58:37] literal regimentation
[58:40] that they're acting by so you don't know
[58:44] what the next guy is going to do
[58:46] because uh
[58:47] things are not in order but that's what
[58:49] satan loves
[58:51] satan loves systems
[58:53] because systems gives predictability
[58:58] and once he knows you're acting within a
[59:02] certain system
[59:03] he can always run ahead of you
[59:06] mess up and mess up everything
[59:09] because he knows your next move is
[59:10] according to this system
[59:12] he knows how you're going to move before
[59:14] you do it right
[59:16] but the sons of god as jesus said in uh
[59:19] john 3 3
[59:21] he says they're like the wind
[59:23] it blows where it listed
[59:26] but no man knows where it goes
[59:29] everybody knows they got even charts of
[59:32] how the wind blows
[59:33] but you know when it really starts to
[59:35] blow they will tell you we don't even
[59:37] know
[59:39] where it's really going to come and
[59:40] where it's really going to go
[59:42] hallelujah but you know when the wind is
[59:46] blowing because you see the leaves
[59:48] moving and then you know the wind is
[59:51] passing by
[59:52] and that's how we know when the holy
[59:54] spirit is passing by praise the lord
[59:57] glory to god we've been given and sold a
[1:00:00] bill of goods of
[1:00:02] when to how to expect when the holy
[1:00:04] ghost is moving oh the holy ghost is
[1:00:07] really moving when the music is loud
[1:00:11] the holy ghost really moving when
[1:00:13] everybody is screaming in the church
[1:00:16] do you know in brother bran's meetings
[1:00:19] what he
[1:00:20] most of his meetings
[1:00:21] it was so quiet
[1:00:23] like this
[1:00:25] and he'd just be talking
[1:00:27] he just be talking
[1:00:29] and all of a sudden somebody screams why
[1:00:31] the holy spirit moved over there
[1:00:34] all of a sudden somebody's left out of
[1:00:37] a wheelchair
[1:00:39] spirit of god moving over there
[1:00:42] see but now they change the expectation
[1:00:46] when the holy spirit really moving
[1:00:48] people are going to fall on the floor
[1:00:50] is that right when the holy role goes is
[1:00:53] really moving brother bro i never seen
[1:00:56] brother desmond
[1:00:57] speak in tongues but all of a sudden
[1:00:59] he's going to speak in towns
[1:01:01] nothing wrong with speaking in towns
[1:01:04] i speak in towns
[1:01:06] i do privately
[1:01:08] and if god wants you to speak publicly
[1:01:11] will they speak publicly let's put his
[1:01:13] glory
[1:01:15] is that right
[1:01:16] we were done in grenada we were having a
[1:01:18] meeting where the preacher didn't want
[1:01:19] to hear me he rejected what i was saying
[1:01:22] and i got up to speak there and i'm just
[1:01:25] starting to all of a sudden sister
[1:01:27] johnson was there and another spirit
[1:01:29] drop on her
[1:01:32] all of a sudden she speaks out in towns
[1:01:35] the next thing the lady spoke out in
[1:01:37] town the next thing you know
[1:01:39] the voice spoke out to her
[1:01:41] and
[1:01:42] you know it kind of worn that church
[1:01:44] spoke to that church and so on like that
[1:01:46] but what was that it's just the holy
[1:01:48] spirit
[1:01:51] we don't have to beat
[1:01:53] not to say we're not going to sing we're
[1:01:55] not going to shout we're not going to
[1:01:56] praise god and all of a sudden you're
[1:01:58] going to go in your shell because i'm
[1:01:59] preaching like this
[1:02:04] and then you're going to want to touch
[1:02:06] the drum barely like you like you're
[1:02:08] using a matchstick
[1:02:09] you know
[1:02:10] no we come to praise god
[1:02:13] but i'm just telling you let your your
[1:02:16] your soul your spirit be open and not be
[1:02:19] bound in any system or form amen but
[1:02:24] simon i can't do that because brethren
[1:02:26] are going to say i'm playing boogie
[1:02:27] boogie music in church
[1:02:31] see what i'm saying the devil got them
[1:02:33] coming and he's got them going
[1:02:36] but the real believer when they know
[1:02:38] they are free in the grace of god and
[1:02:40] the spirit of god is doing when the
[1:02:42] spirit wants me to shout out shout when
[1:02:44] the spirit wants me to dance or dance
[1:02:46] when the spirit of god wants me to play
[1:02:48] louder play love what he wants me to
[1:02:51] play with reverential and great i'm
[1:02:53] moved by the holy ghost amen not by the
[1:02:56] will of man but by the will of god and
[1:02:59] by the power of spirit of god hallelujah
[1:03:03] amen praise the name of the living god
[1:03:07] amen one of those meetings uh
[1:03:10] i was in the home of brother ernie
[1:03:13] fandler you heard brother branham spoke
[1:03:15] of him in his books he's now dead
[1:03:18] and uh
[1:03:19] he was just telling me that uh how he
[1:03:22] hadn't seen brother branham for two
[1:03:24] years and he went to brother brown's
[1:03:27] meeting and how he got
[1:03:29] into the hotel room and i started
[1:03:32] praying and praying and praying so
[1:03:34] before you know it was like two o'clock
[1:03:36] in the morning and he was crying and
[1:03:38] praying and

[1:03:44] gonna first of all he didn't tell
[1:03:45] anybody he was coming so we're gonna
[1:03:47] know he's there so he didn't bother to
[1:03:49] answer but he kept ringing and ringing
[1:03:51] so finally an annoyancy

[1:03:55] the hotel says oh mr fandler there is
[1:03:58] somebody here calling you here now he
[1:04:01] says calling me who could be calling me

[1:04:05] saying ernie

[1:04:54] of course i don't plan to talk about any
[1:04:56] of this here i'm not even following what
[1:04:58] is in front of me here but the fact is
[1:05:01] he went the next day
[1:05:03] and meeting the other ministers and
[1:05:05] talking with them he says you know i
[1:05:07] thank god last night and i was praying
[1:05:10] zone and i got full of the holy ghost
[1:05:12] and i thank the lord for that and they
[1:05:14] said what full of what holy ghost what
[1:05:16] are you talking about and they start
[1:05:17] mocking him
[1:05:19] okay they got in the meeting that night
[1:05:22] brother branham was preaching and
[1:05:24] preaching all of a sudden he stopped
[1:05:27] and he turned over and looked at the
[1:05:29] brother ernie he says brother
[1:05:33] they told you you don't have the holy
[1:05:35] ghost but in the name of jesus christ i
[1:05:37] tell you you caught the holy ghost
[1:05:40] amen now he said was 3 000 people in
[1:05:44] this meeting in chicago and the next
[1:05:47] thing he knew
[1:05:49] he felt like he was in a bed
[1:05:52] with feather pillow he says when he come
[1:05:55] to himself
[1:05:57] he was seated on this side of the
[1:05:59] auditorium
[1:06:02] and he come to himself laying on the
[1:06:05] floor on the opposite side of the
[1:06:07] auditorium
[1:06:09] he said he got a foretaste
[1:06:11] of the rapture
[1:06:13] the glory divine he said brother i felt
[1:06:16] nothing i didn't know nothing all i know
[1:06:18] is that i'm i was there and then i'm
[1:06:20] over there
[1:06:22] and everything felt soft hey man
[1:06:25] of course the place went up in screams
[1:06:27] and people were getting healed and
[1:06:29] delivered and everything else like that
[1:06:31] but friends we got to keep our eyes on
[1:06:33] him
[1:06:34] because if we don't we're going to miss
[1:06:37] it
[1:06:38] amen and my subject today is of course
[1:06:41] being left behind
[1:06:43] because there's a lot of people
[1:06:45] are going to be left behind
[1:06:48] and they don't know why um they're going
[1:06:51] to be
[1:06:52] left behind
[1:06:53] at this moment here you know yes

[1:07:01] when are they going to be left behind
[1:07:04] and also um how are they going to be
[1:07:07] left behind
[1:07:09] right
[1:07:10] you see
[1:07:12] a lot of them left behind as we've said
[1:07:14] before because of their whirly and
[1:07:15] earthly cravings amen
[1:07:19] and they the next thing they're going to
[1:07:21] be left behind is failing to recognize
[1:07:24] their day
[1:07:26] and the message for their day
[1:07:28] everybody has heard brother brennan make
[1:07:30] that quotation and it hasn't really
[1:07:35] seeped down into the soul they just take
[1:07:38] it on face value
[1:07:40] to recognize your day
[1:07:43] and the message for your day
[1:07:46] and they don't realize many are trapped
[1:07:49] in the message of another day
[1:07:52] uh they're trapped into another age
[1:07:56] they're trapped and it's true these
[1:07:59] truths are the truth uh uh uh church age
[1:08:03] one two three four five six they're
[1:08:04] right behind me you see they're trapped
[1:08:07] in that age and they can't seem to get
[1:08:09] out of it
[1:08:11] and now we're living in a day and time
[1:08:14] when the people are trapped in the
[1:08:16] seventh church age
[1:08:18] because they they're blinded by the
[1:08:20] brilliance of the anointing that was
[1:08:22] upon the prophet
[1:08:24] and they keep looking back at the
[1:08:27] prophet with a frog like belief
[1:08:31] not realizing that you can't go forward
[1:08:35] while looking backwards
[1:08:37] you've got to recognize what was done
[1:08:40] there and then let that be a foundation
[1:08:43] for you to break into the holy ghost
[1:08:47] and stand on the very face or rock
[1:08:50] revelation that he was standing on
[1:08:53] then you will start to see the same
[1:08:56] things that he saw
[1:08:59] you're not going to see anything greater
[1:09:00] you're not going to see nothing like
[1:09:02] that
[1:09:03] but he was the first
[1:09:05] one of the grain
[1:09:07] that come to its ripeness
[1:09:10] and what did he say he said and that
[1:09:13] will let you know
[1:09:15] what the rest of them brains are going
[1:09:18] to be like amen because as they ripen
[1:09:23] they're going to look like the first one
[1:09:26] they're gonna start to look like the
[1:09:28] first one
[1:09:30] amen we've given given one twentieth
[1:09:32] country prophet
[1:09:34] and that prophet
[1:09:37] is uh was and is our example for this
[1:09:41] age
[1:09:42] you see back then the people saw jesus
[1:09:45] and he
[1:09:46] is our example
[1:09:47] right down to this time
[1:09:50] that began to fade away god sent a
[1:09:52] prophet exactly in the same spirit with
[1:09:56] the same anointing that you have a
[1:09:58] present tense example of the holy ghost
[1:10:02] when it possesses a man uses a man for
[1:10:05] his glory and manifests his stature
[1:10:08] through that man amen glory be to god
[1:10:11] hallelujah amen
[1:10:14] so
[1:10:15] if you're going back
[1:10:17] go back to your mothers
[1:10:20] go back there and find comfort in other
[1:10:22] words you may find feel more comfortable
[1:10:25] in your denominational atmosphere and
[1:10:28] amongst your denominational friends
[1:10:31] you're gonna find a lot of comfort in
[1:10:33] that well that's the way with you
[1:10:36] lukewarm church members
[1:10:38] the first little things comes along in
[1:10:41] the church
[1:10:42] you're discouraged
[1:10:44] and you are so willing to turn back
[1:10:49] amen oh what a pity brethren amen but
[1:10:53] they don't realize god allows that
[1:10:57] because he's trying to capture the last
[1:11:00] little something that may be in the
[1:11:02] heart of that believer
[1:11:04] on saying to the human eye
[1:11:06] but seen by hebrews 4 12 the eyes of god
[1:11:10] don't miss nothing
[1:11:12] and if you have something hide up inside
[1:11:14] you god will reveal it
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:17] god will make it known
[1:11:20] make everything plain amen hallelujah

[1:12:23] you can run though there is no bomb
[1:12:25] shelter where you can run to the only
[1:12:28] safety zone is to hide in jesus christ

[1:12:36] of life go past why because you're
[1:12:39] hiding in a rock of ages praise god oh

[1:16:53] and everything else i said i'm here to
[1:16:55] see mr so-and-so well how do you know
[1:16:57] he's here
[1:17:00] he comes from toronto infrequently and
[1:17:02] he just happened to come up here and he
[1:17:04] told nobody because he doesn't want
[1:17:06] nobody to know he's here
[1:17:08] yeah but um i'm supposed to see him
[1:17:12] and of course he came out and we talked
[1:17:15] and settle the whole matter praise god
[1:17:17] that was to do with the old church and
[1:17:19] some people were opposing us buying the
[1:17:22] building and all this stuff
[1:17:24] and of course he just told them he says
[1:17:26] oh when the people were smoking drugs
[1:17:28] back at that building you weren't
[1:17:29] reporting it when they were drinking
[1:17:31] back there and you weren't reporting it
[1:17:33] but now they're praising god and they're
[1:17:35] serving god and you're reporting it
[1:17:38] well i say it's past
[1:17:41] [Applause]
[1:17:45] amen just walk
[1:17:48] you're free
[1:17:50] hallelujah come out of that old life
[1:17:53] where you're going to church and you
[1:17:54] have to wonder i wonder the people are
[1:17:56] going to watch me how i dress
[1:18:00] they're going to look at me and
[1:18:02] nobody doesn't worry about that sort of
[1:18:05] thing of course you're not going to come
[1:18:07] in here half naked
[1:18:10] we know because there's a principle in
[1:18:12] the word of god
[1:18:14] but we don't enforce that legalistically
[1:18:17] i have no deacons at the back door with
[1:18:18] the tape measuring your skirt leg
[1:18:23] is that right
[1:18:25] praise god
[1:18:26] and nobody is measuring anybody's pants
[1:18:29] crutch or whatever but it's
[1:18:31] not that that is proper but you're not
[1:18:34] supposed to be that way and if you're if
[1:18:36] the spirit of god doesn't move on your
[1:18:39] own soul your own conscience to make you
[1:18:42] obey the word
[1:18:44] and i have to tell you that
[1:18:46] then you obey the word because i tell
[1:18:48] you
[1:18:49] because i place an order in the church
[1:18:52] saying so-and-so can't come in this one
[1:18:53] can't no you must move by the spirit of
[1:18:57] almighty god
[1:18:59] and then the
[1:19:01] god place the pastor the deacons and the
[1:19:03] officers in the church to correct the
[1:19:06] spirits that are in the church
[1:19:10] and they will know when and how to
[1:19:12] correct you with love grace be doing
[1:19:14] that very well knowing that all these
[1:19:16] people are wrong listening and then it
[1:19:18] elevates
[1:19:20] that officer no they have more wisdom
[1:19:22] than that
[1:19:24] they know how to take your side and talk
[1:19:26] with you quite less if nothing ever
[1:19:28] happened in the first place is that
[1:19:30] right what kind of a message is this
[1:19:32] anyway i'm supposed to be preaching on
[1:19:34] left behind and i'm going back and forth
[1:19:36] and everything else you must
[1:19:40] oh my
[1:19:42] but don't look for any of these great
[1:19:44] revivals they're talking about
[1:19:47] don't look for it
[1:19:49] not that you don't real look let me
[1:19:51] continue talking here
[1:19:53] amen
[1:19:55] you know
[1:19:56] the greatest revival
[1:19:58] has already struck the earth
[1:20:01] and it's going on even right now
[1:20:04] but they're looking for a great revival
[1:20:07] in the way they expect a great revival
[1:20:11] they don't understand that when brother
[1:20:13] brennan was under the first and second
[1:20:15] pull
[1:20:17] that was the ending
[1:20:19] of the pentecostal revival
[1:20:22] that was the ending of it
[1:20:25] and
[1:20:26] it went from there into the third pole
[1:20:30] where the attraction
[1:20:32] was no more healing to the body
[1:20:36] where did where the attraction was no
[1:20:38] more the discernment of spirits
[1:20:41] and the revelation of addresses and
[1:20:44] names and conditions
[1:20:46] but it went even higher
[1:20:50] where the attraction
[1:20:52] should be the word
[1:20:55] in the bible
[1:20:56] when jesus was writing into jerusalem on
[1:20:58] that little
[1:21:00] little donkey or preacher whichever one
[1:21:03] you want to put it
[1:21:05] so he was riding into
[1:21:06] into jerusalem on this little donkey
[1:21:10] and
[1:21:11] the pharisees couldn't understand why
[1:21:12] the crowds of people were attracted to
[1:21:15] him
[1:21:16] because you have to understand back
[1:21:18] there he was just another ordinary young
[1:21:20] man
[1:21:21] and he didn't have on some special
[1:21:24] beautiful suit or something like that
[1:21:27] he just was wearing the regular garb of
[1:21:30] the regular people riding on a donkey
[1:21:32] the cheapest form of transportation
[1:21:36] and yet crowds were gathering around him
[1:21:39] and they couldn't understand it what was
[1:21:41] the attraction on the mountain
[1:21:43] the people were attracted by him the
[1:21:47] word
[1:21:48] he the word
[1:21:50] was the attraction
[1:21:52] because when they looked at him
[1:21:55] they saw past
[1:21:57] the veil
[1:22:00] they started going beyond the veil
[1:22:04] for the seven seals had ripped the veil
[1:22:08] and looking behind the veil they could
[1:22:12] see and come into
[1:22:14] a supernatural communion
[1:22:16] with the pillar of fire himself
[1:22:20] and god can now
[1:22:23] be his own interpreter
[1:22:26] speaking to his own bride
[1:22:29] bringing forth the word of god
[1:22:31] and they could recognize him
[1:22:34] regardless of who he speaks truth
[1:22:37] regardless of if it's a boy of 12 or a
[1:22:41] girl or 15 or whoever they listen for
[1:22:44] the voice of god
[1:22:45] for my sheep hear my voice and a
[1:22:48] stranger they will not follow they'll
[1:22:50] recognize the voice of god hallelujah
[1:22:53] wherever it comes from glory to god
[1:22:56] hallelujah amen so the greatest revival
[1:22:59] is going on right now how many believes
[1:23:01] that
[1:23:04] amen yes sir
[1:23:07] you're looking for something

[1:23:10] devil is sure going to show you
[1:23:12] something
[1:23:13] the devil listen what he says here and
[1:23:16] escape here quickly the satan

[1:23:24] thing over there

[1:23:28] going on over there oh yes there is a
[1:23:31] toronto blessing run over there brother

[1:23:57] greater greater greater greater you see
[1:24:01] and while they're looking for that
[1:24:03] greater thing that satan keeps saying
[1:24:07] it's passing them by in other words the
[1:24:10] real revival is passing them by
[1:24:13] amen
[1:24:14] now he says did not john the baptist
[1:24:19] was on earth and even
[1:24:22] the righteous ones some of the righteous
[1:24:25] did not even recognize him in his
[1:24:28] day amen
[1:24:31] did not even the disciples
[1:24:33] they didn't recognize him say
[1:24:35] when will eli
[1:24:38] elias come he said you see they didn't
[1:24:40] even recognize him jesus had to identify
[1:24:43] him to them for them to know
[1:24:45] amen but they didn't recognize him
[1:24:49] and he said he's already come
[1:24:51] and you didn't know it
[1:24:53] the revival
[1:24:56] amen
[1:24:57] is over
[1:24:59] hallelujah for the pentecostalists that
[1:25:02] revival is over

[1:25:26] to recognize that revival
[1:25:28] the son of man
[1:25:30] now being revealed

[1:31:54] the coming of the lord is at hand you
[1:31:56] see that
[1:31:57] if you're carnal if you're still in the
[1:31:59] flesh you're looking at the car the
[1:32:00] coming lord still coming up the road
[1:32:02] some some time like that you don't
[1:32:04] realize that when those the seven seals
[1:32:09] the first six
[1:32:10] told you all that was was back there and
[1:32:14] what the histories and what happened
[1:32:16] but the seventh seal brought that mighty
[1:32:20] covenant angel back to earth again
[1:32:24] that angel with the sweat back wings
[1:32:27] not a man of earth but the lord himself
[1:32:30] from heaven
[1:32:31] and when the seventh seal broke out
[1:32:33] silence why because the lord himself had
[1:32:37] come to ortiz and even the angels
[1:32:39] couldn't let that out satan couldn't get
[1:32:41] to know it because the lord himself come
[1:32:44] hallelujah praise god listen listen let
[1:32:48] me let me say it again i know you all
[1:32:49] hear this until your ears may be ringing
[1:32:52] but listen back in the old days in the
[1:32:54] old school
[1:32:56] uh the boy sees a young girl that he
[1:32:58] loves and hey he don't want to tell her
[1:33:02] walk up to her and tell her and be
[1:33:03] embarrassed
[1:33:06] so he gave a note to his friend
[1:33:09] and the friend uh which is the type of
[1:33:11] the prophet i'm talking about takes the
[1:33:14] note and he comes to the girl and he
[1:33:17] starts to tell her everything that his
[1:33:20] you know his best friend told him and
[1:33:23] you know
[1:33:25] your eyes like pearl and you this and
[1:33:27] that and so on
[1:33:28] all right you read the book of songs of
[1:33:31] solomon and so on oh my and this is what
[1:33:34] your best friend said and then after a
[1:33:36] while the best friends realized that now
[1:33:39] the girl really likes loves him
[1:33:42] and he gets the confidence to talk to
[1:33:43] her himself
[1:33:45] no more notes coming to that friend to
[1:33:48] that
[1:33:48] friend or that prophet anymore you got
[1:33:51] to get out of here

[1:33:55] hallelujah
[1:33:58] oh my and while the prophet is sleeping
[1:34:01] in this big tent to this message
[1:34:03] then another one steps forth oh my think

[1:34:09] living god in this hour in time has come
[1:34:13] now from the breaking of the seventh
[1:34:15] seal and when you know it if you go you
[1:34:18] can read the seventh seal over and over

[1:34:27] there's food for your soul in there
[1:34:30] right because it's the lord himself that
[1:34:33] has returned to us that was the coming
[1:34:36] of the lord

[1:35:13] in your heart
[1:35:14] in your soul
[1:35:16] himself

[1:35:20] he allowed the prophet to store up the
[1:35:22] food so that you can eat that food and
[1:35:25] start to recognize who he is what he is
[1:35:28] what he promised he would do and your

[1:53:18] prophets
[1:53:21] you claim you are believers of the
[1:53:24] prophet
[1:53:25] but he said you are of your father the
[1:53:27] devil
[1:53:28] following the prophet following jesus
[1:53:31] around and then turning around trying to
[1:53:33] trip him trick him trap him
[1:53:36] into various things and read all manner
[1:53:38] of things in there he says following the
[1:53:41] prophets
[1:53:43] amen believers of the prophets but of
[1:53:46] your father the devil do you believe
[1:53:49] that
[1:53:52] people in this message
[1:53:54] could be of their father the devil
[1:53:58] let me tell you my friends
[1:54:00] that is not just words talking that is
[1:54:03] real you got more devils in this message
[1:54:05] now than there ever was out there
[1:54:08] because the devil realized this is the
[1:54:10] last part of the whole thing
[1:54:12] and he has just
[1:54:13] filled just like putin is trying to fill
[1:54:16] the united states with all kind of spies
[1:54:18] now and the united states vice versa is
[1:54:20] trying to get as much spies as they can
[1:54:22] into there to let them know what's going
[1:54:24] on that devil also saturate the whole
[1:54:28] message with a bunch of devils
[1:54:31] enticing spirits

[1:54:37] in the religious realm
[1:54:40] my
[1:54:41] watching and waiting and trying to
[1:54:43] decipher what is going on but thank god
[1:54:47] the prophet of god made it clear they'll
[1:54:50] never be able to know what this is to be
[1:54:52] able to copycat it
[1:54:54] or the devil ain't going to find nothing
[1:54:56] that he couldn't be able to try to uh
[1:54:59] what's the word
[1:55:01] not copycat but
[1:55:03] you won't be able to
[1:55:05] impersonate thank you brother
[1:55:07] impersonate he won't be able to
[1:55:08] impersonate this
[1:55:09] because you can't put it on it's the
[1:55:11] life of christ in you working through
[1:55:14] you praise the lord i'm quickly coming
[1:55:16] to an ending of what i'm talking about
[1:55:18] here right praise god

[1:55:33] believers but let me tell you some in
[1:55:36] here seated
[1:55:38] are greater than john jesus said
[1:55:41] because we are being given things beyond
[1:55:44] what he had at that time
[1:55:47] if he was here no doubt that's why he
[1:55:49] said oh i wish i can go into that golden
[1:55:52] age
[1:55:53] he would want to come on down but he was
[1:55:56] just not allowed because he said no two
[1:55:58] of us can be on the earth at the same
[1:56:00] time well i have to go i must decrease
[1:56:03] that he might increase
[1:56:06] he's the one who's gonna talk to the
[1:56:08] bride amen praise god hallelujah think
[1:56:11] about it amen see
[1:56:14] you claim you are of you are believers

[1:56:19] yet you you claim that then god sent the
[1:56:23] prophet uh and and you put them prophets
[1:56:26] in the grave you killed the prophets
[1:56:29] amen but now what are they doing they're
[1:56:31] killing his influence
[1:56:33] they're killing that influence of the
[1:56:35] prophet righteous man he says i'm
[1:56:38] talking about holy man
[1:56:41] man that if you look at them you
[1:56:43] couldn't even put a finger on their life
[1:56:45] yet jesus himself called them nothing
[1:56:49] but serpents and devils
[1:56:51] oh my oh friends apply this to our day
[1:56:55] hallelujah god's chosen place of worship
[1:56:59] do you realize
[1:57:00] the shadows of the old testament

[1:57:23] the scene
[1:57:24] all the shadows and types concerning the
[1:57:27] bride the rapture the bride the growing
[1:57:29] home of the church the
[1:57:32] the negative which was the types and
[1:57:35] shadows are now coming into perfect
[1:57:38] realization it's coming into perfect
[1:57:40] reality by the holy spirit moving in the
[1:57:43] hearts and lives of the believers amen
[1:57:46] every day praise god don't you know
[1:57:50] all the feasts the holidays
[1:57:52] all of the tabernacle all the wood in
[1:57:55] there everything in the tabernacle was a
[1:57:58] type of christ all the offerings all the
[1:58:00] laws it was a type of christ every and
[1:58:03] now in our day

[1:58:20] behind
[1:58:22] and they are no more not even in the
[1:58:25] race at all
[1:58:28] think of it
[1:58:30] every denomination he says he repeats
[1:58:33] every denomination
[1:58:34] they are completely left out of this
[1:58:39] see
[1:58:40] why
[1:58:42] there is no place for them in this
[1:58:46] hallelujah in putting together
[1:58:49] the great jigsaw apostle
[1:58:52] that the old man was putting together of
[1:58:54] the face of jesus christ
[1:58:56] hallelujah
[1:58:58] when it fits all together the true
[1:59:00] believer been it's been revealed to them
[1:59:02] and the word will begin to fit together
[1:59:04] their understanding will begin to open
[1:59:06] and the world will fit together but then
[1:59:08] all of a sudden the devil throw in a
[1:59:10] piece
[1:59:12] but that peace there is no place for it
[1:59:14] it can't fit in there
[1:59:16] to make the thing complete so you could
[1:59:19] see jesus christ and you know the same
[1:59:21] with this judah's spirit
[1:59:24] there was no place for judas
[1:59:26] he could not be found think of it at
[1:59:29] that time
[1:59:30] they could ever be so sincere
[1:59:33] like esau was
[1:59:34] seeking repentance
[1:59:37] with tears
[1:59:39] unforgiveness with tears
[1:59:41] oh my you know forgiveness is a funny
[1:59:44] thing the devil has got forgiveness down
[1:59:46] to the point
[1:59:48] that um
[1:59:49] people only have to say i'm sorry
[1:59:52] and wants to say he said well what else
[1:59:54] can the guy do they already told you
[1:59:56] that he's sorry
[1:59:57] what can she do she already said she's
[1:59:59] sorry
[2:00:00] that's not repentance
[2:00:03] because that makes them go out and do
[2:00:05] the same thing
[2:00:06] over
[2:00:07] and over
[2:00:08] again
[2:00:10] amen that's not repentance oh but you
[2:00:13] should forgive them you're a christian
[2:00:15] you should forgive them and forgive them
[2:00:17] forget all that they thought no
[2:00:20] the only person that can forget anything
[2:00:22] is god
[2:00:24] he can forget and put it in the sea of
[2:00:27] forgetfulness while you're in this flesh
[2:00:29] you can't forget no fool yourself you
[2:00:31] can't forget
[2:00:34] you can remember
[2:00:36] but you don't hold nothing here
[2:00:40] but some people think because you
[2:00:41] remember you ain't forgive
[2:00:43] it doesn't work that way
[2:00:45] that's not real forgiveness right
[2:00:48] forgiveness goes here
[2:00:50] forgive i can forgive you but i still
[2:00:53] recognize
[2:00:54] what kind of spirit is on you and how
[2:00:56] that spirit is going to act
[2:00:59] how it's going to move so i got to be
[2:01:01] watchful i got to be very careful
[2:01:04] of what's taken place amen praise the
[2:01:06] lord hallelujah
[2:01:09] praise god
[2:01:10] you must know what you're doing
[2:01:14] praise god or else you'll find yourself
[2:01:17] fighting the air
[2:01:19] that's what paul talked about you're
[2:01:21] fighting up and you fight in the air
[2:01:23] when you fight in the air you don't even
[2:01:24] know what you're doing right come back
[2:01:27] to the word of god get lined up with the
[2:01:29] word of god you see a soldier doesn't
[2:01:32] act until he gets orders
[2:01:34] to do it amen and we must be soldiers
[2:01:38] get your orders see see not not that not
[2:01:42] the orders or the charges from yesterday
[2:01:47] not the charges the general gave the day
[2:01:49] before
[2:01:51] see
[2:01:52] not the but the charge or the the order
[2:01:55] for today
[2:01:57] hallelujah that's what we are trying to
[2:01:59] do here
[2:02:00] is to obey the order for this day you
[2:02:04] know how many years
[2:02:05] i take all kind of smears all kind of
[2:02:08] talk
[2:02:09] what what is birth simon talking about
[2:02:10] what is this stuff here but you see in a
[2:02:13] way
[2:02:14] the lord jesus make me say things and
[2:02:16] put things ahead of my time
[2:02:19] it was and so when you're saying it it
[2:02:21] couldn't be caught couldn't be
[2:02:22] understood
[2:02:23] or else they think that you're saying
[2:02:25] those things because you want to make
[2:02:26] yourself something but the more you see
[2:02:28] the word you want to make less of
[2:02:30] yourself you don't want to be nothing
[2:02:33] amen you want to get out and let god out
[2:02:35] this way amen see
[2:02:37] modern events are slipping by so swiftly
[2:02:41] that one day
[2:02:42] they're going to find out you're left
[2:02:45] behind
[2:02:47] left behind without nothing
[2:02:49] you'll be caught and sealed into the
[2:02:52] mark of the beast before you know it
[2:02:56] amen
[2:02:57] the prophecies that promise every one of
[2:02:59] them
[2:03:00] fulfilled
[2:03:01] in its age
[2:03:03] it foretells what the author has done
[2:03:06] and what he will do again
[2:03:09] oh what a time that we are living in
[2:03:11] praise god we are not living in the
[2:03:14] methodist age the baptist age we are not
[2:03:16] living in the pentecostal age and as you
[2:03:19] see i have to stop here and i keep
[2:03:21] repeating this because this is the
[2:03:24] brother branham said some of them got
[2:03:26] something stuck in their craw and and
[2:03:28] they can't swallow the the fullness of
[2:03:31] the world
[2:03:32] and it's stuck there they can't get it
[2:03:34] down they don't realize that brother
[2:03:36] branham was the prophet of malachi 4 and
[2:03:42] that he was the
[2:03:44] seventh angel
[2:03:46] to the leodision church age
[2:03:49] don't they know that the judicial church
[2:03:51] is the pentecostal church age
[2:03:54] and that he
[2:03:55] was the messenger of the pentecostal
[2:03:57] church age
[2:03:59] but he was also used as the wave shift
[2:04:03] or as the one to bridge the gap to bring
[2:04:07] us right to the
[2:04:09] to the river
[2:04:11] right up to bradley kindness to the
[2:04:14] to the bank of the river jordan
[2:04:18] to the crossing over
[2:04:21] but he was not allowed as i was with
[2:04:23] moses social identity
[2:04:26] he was not allowed to take your cross
[2:04:29] he can't
[2:04:31] joshua is allowed to take you across
[2:04:34] and joshua is a type of the holy spirit
[2:04:38] so the holy spirit takes over from that
[2:04:40] point
[2:04:41] amen and takes you across
[2:04:45] this great messenger from heaven
[2:04:48] not another man on this earth claiming
[2:04:50] he's a messenger

[2:05:05] before you

[2:05:10] it right now you're looking at the
[2:05:13] calendar and you find out what day of
[2:05:16] the year you're living in but when you
[2:05:18] look in this bible when you look in the
[2:05:20] word of god what age you're living in
[2:05:22] we're not in the methodist baptist age
[2:05:25] pentecostal age or anything we are
[2:05:27] living in the bride age
[2:05:30] i said we're living in the bright age
[2:05:33] praise god hallelujah shall come from
[2:05:36] his side
[2:05:37] this is not where god took e from
[2:05:40] he took eve from adam's side
[2:05:43] right what rib was it
[2:05:46] which rib fifth rib
[2:05:49] wow what a number my anyway he took her
[2:05:53] on from that fifth rib that grace number
[2:05:57] and brought her from adam's side
[2:06:00] and she could be visibly seen standing
[2:06:02] there beside him but he still called
[2:06:04] their name and they shall be called adam
[2:06:08] even though it was two of them standing
[2:06:09] there
[2:06:10] god said their name shall be called adam
[2:06:14] later on adam called her his wife's name
[2:06:17] eve adam called her eve but god called
[2:06:20] them
[2:06:22] adam
[2:06:23] and we come back to this age and time
[2:06:27] and because we were in him before the
[2:06:30] foundation of the world and we come out
[2:06:33] from his side amen hallelujah
[2:06:38] now
[2:06:38] we're taking the bride stand
[2:06:41] which is to stand by our husband the
[2:06:43] word we're taken back into his side
[2:06:47] again
[2:06:48] to identify with him
[2:06:51] mrs jesus christ anointed by the word of
[2:06:54] god

[2:07:24] events made clear i hope you are not
[2:07:26] asleep
[2:07:27] i hope you are not asleep by this time
[2:07:30] for the grain is now here
[2:07:34] is that right you believe that
[2:07:36] the real grain is here
[2:07:39] it is to be gathered into the garner
[2:07:42] it was the bride
[2:07:44] that part of it and what he said will
[2:07:47] happen to the stock
[2:07:49] that stock
[2:07:51] must now be burnt with unquenchable fire
[2:07:55] seek salvation now
[2:07:57] while there is still time
[2:08:00] let god
[2:08:01] show you
[2:08:02] be a grain
[2:08:04] not a stalk
[2:08:06] and now
[2:08:07] step into life
[2:08:10] go into that life
[2:08:12] not live by the old dead form
[2:08:15] but get into the life of christ
[2:08:18] which is the word
[2:08:20] manifest
[2:08:22] amen hallelujah
[2:08:25] for the combine is now coming
[2:08:28] this is the gathering time
[2:08:31] and you would better get into the grain
[2:08:33] cause all that is shock
[2:08:36] is going to be left
[2:08:38] behind
[2:08:40] don't be left behind
[2:08:42] praise god
[2:08:43] let's go over the facts i've i've said
[2:08:46] this to some of the brothers quietly
[2:08:48] people are being left behind right now
[2:08:49] and they don't even know it they're left
[2:08:51] behind in understanding they're left
[2:08:53] behind in revelation they're already
[2:08:55] left behind the gap is widening
[2:08:58] you don't have to separate yourself from
[2:09:00] nobody oh that brother doing this listen
[2:09:02] no god himself is separating
[2:09:06] is that right
[2:09:07] separating
[2:09:09] by his word
[2:09:11] god bless you

[2:09:17] strengthened and you caught the
[2:09:19] revelation
[2:09:21] of this prophet's message the last

[2:11:05] thank the lord
[2:11:11] friends
[2:11:12] i want to say that
[2:11:15] i've been
[2:11:17] serving the lord
[2:11:18] and preaching this message
[2:11:21] for about 63
[2:11:24] years
[2:11:27] and
[2:11:28] i just want to thank the lord he has
[2:11:30] brought me thus far
[2:11:32] you know what i'm praying for now that
[2:11:34] god will
[2:11:35] um
[2:11:36] bring you let the eagle renew its
[2:11:38] strength
[2:11:40] but for that to happen
[2:11:42] uh it takes the eagles down in the
[2:11:44] valley
[2:11:45] and they go through all kind of
[2:11:47] emotional all kind of physical things
[2:11:50] and they get broken down and everything
[2:11:52] before he can renew their strengths
[2:11:54] and i pray that god will renew my
[2:11:56] strength like that of the eagles
[2:11:59] i'll hearing you my strength like he did
[2:12:02] with abraham and sarah
[2:12:04] uh when there are 100 that the
[2:12:08] pharaoh can look at sarah
[2:12:11] and want her to be his wife
[2:12:14] my
[2:12:15] praise god but she wasn't even bothered
[2:12:17] with that amen you lose sight of the
[2:12:20] things of the earth but the grace of god
[2:12:23] hallelujah i just ask god to give me
[2:12:25] health
[2:12:26] and strength
[2:12:28] and grace
[2:12:29] more understanding
[2:12:31] and that the word will go forth to your
[2:12:33] benefit and blessing
[2:12:36] now remember
[2:12:38] we are not to
[2:12:40] uh my sermon has ended i'm just
[2:12:42] commenting now
[2:12:43] i'm just saying we are not now to think
[2:12:46] well the brain is supposed to be
[2:12:49] just a certain number of people and so
[2:12:52] no we have continued great evangelistic
[2:12:56] work
[2:12:57] we have got to reach out
[2:12:59] because remember we're reaching out for
[2:13:01] the remnant
[2:13:02] and for the last elect that's supposed
[2:13:04] to come in
[2:13:06] we got to find that last elected seed
[2:13:09] son or daughter of god
[2:13:11] certified by the holy spirit
[2:13:14] that they can come into this
[2:13:18] revelation of the message of this hour
[2:13:21] and at the same time we must reach out
[2:13:24] for the remnant
[2:13:26] to bring as many of them is
[2:13:28] as we can is that right
[2:13:31] because they are of the same quality
[2:13:33] clot that we were cut from it's just
[2:13:36] that they were not included in this part
[2:13:39] of it
[2:13:40] but we got to have that heart reaching
[2:13:42] out for them
[2:13:43] bear that in mind
[2:13:45] and reach out with the message give out
[2:13:48] let them know a prophet has come
[2:13:51] go back to the simplicity and the
[2:13:53] foundations of it you got to start there
[2:13:56] because you're not talking to people
[2:13:58] that have your understanding you're
[2:14:00] talking to babies and people so share
[2:14:03] the message
[2:14:05] hallelujah share it and start from the
[2:14:09] where they are
[2:14:11] and bring them into the grace of god if
[2:14:13] it's an elected seed of god they'll pick
[2:14:15] it up so fast they'll they'll come right
[2:14:17] in to everything that you have in no
[2:14:20] time so oh but it took me so many years
[2:14:22] it'll take them one day or less than a
[2:14:24] day and the holy spirit is going to do
[2:14:27] that so you give them grace god praise
[2:14:29] god you hear what i'm saying reach out
[2:14:32] don't stop reaching out or slow down now
[2:14:34] you're coming to the end of the of the
[2:14:37] race
[2:14:38] no praise god you got that race and that
[2:14:41] crown right ahead of you that's when you
[2:14:44] now should pick up your pace amen and
[2:14:46] come to the end of the race shouting
[2:14:48] glory victory in jesus my savior forever
