[42:26] underlying that what you will be looking
[42:29] at really is the unveiling of God praise

[42:38] scripture found in Romans chapter 16
[42:43] we welcome all of the Believers who are

[42:50] lot are watching online on this
[42:54] particular day out in the east in the
[42:56] west wherever they are amen covered by
[43:01] the blood faithful and believing God's
[43:04] word for the hour but we will start by
[43:07] reading from Romans 16 verses 25 to 27.
[43:16] The Book of Romans 16 25 to 27. amen
[43:24] now to him
[43:27] that is of power
[43:31] to establish you according to my gospel
[43:36] and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[43:40] according to the revelation of the
[43:43] mystery
[43:45] which was Kept Secret
[43:48] since the world began
[43:51] but now is made manifest
[43:55] and by the scriptures of the prophets
[43:58] according to the Commandment of the
[44:01] Everlasting God made known to All
[44:05] Nations for The Obedience of faith
[44:09] the god to God only wise

[44:18] amen
[44:20] God bless you gracious heavenly father

[44:30] bless us everyone may the great Holy
[44:34] Spirit uh oh God surround us father with
[44:38] his warm embrace of love for the word
[44:42] May the word of God go forth in his
[44:46] Purity and in its strength and may you
[44:49] receive all the glory all the praise
[44:52] father in Jesus name amen God bless you
[44:56] please be seated
[45:01] foreign
[45:04] taking this marvelous thought through
[45:08] the revelation of the mystery which was
[45:11] Kept Secret since the world began
[45:15] uh the secret since the world began in
[45:21] other words that's speaking about uh it
[45:24] had to be kept secret from the time we
[45:26] were sent down here to become flesh
[45:31] it the secret really started because
[45:34] once it was in God's mind it was already
[45:37] hit
[45:38] but when it could be made known or the
[45:42] enemy could detect it pick it up or try
[45:44] to mess around with it is when it left
[45:48] his lips
[45:51] or his word come down to become word
[45:55] it's the same thought brother Branham
[45:57] Express I'm just going to talk with you
[45:59] is that all right
[46:01] um brother Branham expressed when he was
[46:03] saying I know better I can think what I
[46:06] want God can reveal something to me and
[46:09] I can have it in my mind for a long time
[46:12] but he says I know better than to speak
[46:15] it
[46:15] because the moment I speak it then the
[46:19] devil has something now he can work with
[46:21] he can then now begin to try to
[46:24] impersonate and he can all try to copy
[46:27] cats and everything else it's the same
[46:30] thought I'm bringing to you that our
[46:33] um uh it became a mystery from the
[46:37] moment that God said let there be in the
[46:41] word will not begin to be expressed the
[46:43] seeds with the promise of life eternal
[46:46] life in them begin to come to the Earth
[46:50] to to be waiting in the field the dirt
[46:55] and the corruption of this evil world
[46:57] for their time and season to come when
[47:03] God would send a a messenger or one of
[47:07] his workers in his field that would uh
[47:11] water it and and so that it could come
[47:14] to life and begin him to bring forth
[47:17] after his kind in other words whatever
[47:21] he placed in them were told them they
[47:24] ought to do or purpose in their heart
[47:26] his heart that they should do that
[47:28] potential in the seed of God begins to
[47:32] wake up it begins to come to life by his
[47:36] Spirit working through his Messengers
[47:40] now coming more directly to this subject
[47:45] the mystery what is this mystery that we
[47:50] are really talking about
[47:52] we have read about it in the Bible many
[47:55] times and now we read it in the word
[47:59] here the revelation of the mystery that
[48:03] was Kept Secret since the world began
[48:06] now we know as a brother Branham said
[48:10] one of my old books here Christ is the
[48:14] mystery
[48:15] Christ is the mystery of God revealed so
[48:21] this is the uh mystery it's not the
[48:24] revelation of Jesus
[48:28] this is not the revelation of the man
[48:31] Jesus
[48:32] for he was only the flesh or the skin
[48:37] that Jehovah was living in so it was not
[48:41] a revelation of him the man but the
[48:45] Revelation Christ is the mystery of God
[48:50] revealed amen praise the Lord now so we
[48:54] understand Colossians 1 19 for it
[48:58] pleased the father not in him
[49:02] amen should all fullness dwell
[49:06] so the fullness was not in Jesus but
[49:10] Christ is the mystery of God being
[49:14] revealed male and female
[49:17] amen all of God being revealed and at
[49:21] one time it's telling us it was all in
[49:25] Christ
[49:26] so Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[49:30] praise God hallelujah and again
[49:33] Colossians 2 9 for in him developed all
[49:39] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[49:44] amen hallelujah now Christ is the
[49:47] mystery of God revealed page 16. now
[49:52] God's Great secret he had it in him
[49:55] before the world began that you see it
[50:00] was in the back parts of God's mind
[50:03] there was something he was going to
[50:07] achieve and he had a motive for doing it
[50:11] it was in order to let himself
[50:15] be expressed amen hallelujah and then
[50:20] again page 17 here he says God had a
[50:23] purpose and a hidden Mystery
[50:26] and that's what I want to speak about to
[50:29] the church the hidden Mystery of God the
[50:33] hidden Mystery of God that he had in his
[50:37] mind before the world ever began and how
[50:43] that this mystery has been unfolding
[50:47] praise God Hallelujah the mystery has
[50:51] unfolded from the time we were expressed
[50:55] came down was sent down here it's being
[50:59] expressed through the ages and the book
[51:03] has been on being unfolded amen age by
[51:07] age Page by Page has been unfolding and
[51:11] making itself known for the glory of God
[51:14] hallelujah so it unfolded itself right
[51:18] down right now to this present hour
[51:22] Hallelujah the book unfolding amen
[51:25] hallelujah that we're living in then you
[51:29] will understand clearly what is being
[51:33] done
[51:35] for this great mystery this secret he
[51:39] kept it a secret nobody know nothing
[51:42] about it not even the angels didn't
[51:45] understand it hallelujah praise God
[51:49] that's the reason under our seventh
[51:52] mystery seventh seal what it was opened
[51:55] there was only silence
[51:58] praise God if you understand what I'm
[52:01] talking about when he says for this was
[52:04] the mystery coming of Christ
[52:06] amen not the mystery coming of just
[52:08] Jesus coming back but the mystery coming
[52:11] of Christ is not him only coming for the
[52:15] Rapture but the coming of the Bride
[52:18] which is the other part of the godhead
[52:21] to come on the scene and the seal is now
[52:25] unveiling it's time for her to be
[52:27] expressed and to be made manifest by the
[52:31] word of God in this hour hallelujah amen
[52:34] praise the Lord oh my you see Hallelujah
[52:39] because you see he had revealed yet how
[52:42] he would come and he hadn't revealed
[52:45] when he would come hallelujah oh my what
[52:49] you see he has shown
[52:52] he has showed or revealed it in the ver
[52:56] in the Bible amen praise God therefore
[53:00] the entire Bible is the revelation of
[53:04] God's great mystery in Christ
[53:08] where was the mystery in Christ where
[53:12] was The Bride In Christ where was the
[53:14] wife in Christ hallelujah we're talking
[53:17] about the unveiling of the god of Heaven
[53:20] amen making himself known male and
[53:24] female praise God hallelujah now I I
[53:28] just want to give you these things here
[53:30] and then you will look at the scriptures
[53:33] of yourself
[53:35] hallelujah amen now God expressed in
[53:39] Jesus Christ
[53:41] God who was bought Father Son and Holy
[53:44] Ghost you believe that we serve one God
[53:48] we don't serve a trinity but we serve
[53:52] one God
[53:53] who manifests themselves in that way for
[53:57] he was the great spirit in the great
[53:59] beyond he needed a body that he could
[54:03] live in live a perfect life to die as a
[54:07] bloody bleeding Lambs laying Hallelujah
[54:10] that he might redeem back his people and
[54:15] so he created a body for himself named
[54:18] Jesus God was in Christ reconcerting the
[54:22] world to himself not to somebody else
[54:24] but we was reconciling the world to
[54:27] himself amen so he lived in that body
[54:30] and the body was called the son and any
[54:34] human being or body that God places his
[54:38] life his seed in that they become
[54:41] silence their Lord are Sons and
[54:44] Daughters of the Living God hallelujah
[54:47] amen so we see now that here he was
[54:51] God's father and Holy Ghost
[54:56] amen the fullness of the godhead bodily
[55:00] see now the complete fullness of the
[55:04] godhead bodily dwells in his church
[55:09] where does it dwell in his church amen
[55:13] praise God because Christ poured himself
[55:15] in the church
[55:17] amen so now the church has the fullness
[55:20] of the godhead bodily I just I'm just
[55:23] thinking remembering where uh breathing
[55:26] where brother Brandon said don't you
[55:28] understand what Jesus was trying to tell
[55:30] those Pharisees and Sadducees he said if
[55:34] you call your prophets gods you call
[55:38] them Gods common g-o-d-s for the spirit
[55:42] of God was in them and speaking through
[55:44] them using them and you call them Gods
[55:47] how is it when the Son of God comes on
[55:51] the scene here son of man comes on the
[55:54] scene and you don't even recognize him
[55:56] who he is that's all of them prophets
[55:59] all of them Patriarchs all of them
[56:02] combined in this one being person named
[56:06] Jesus God wasn't Christ reconciling the
[56:09] world unto himself amen and then what
[56:14] happened all God was all that fullness
[56:17] was poured into Christ and all that
[56:20] Christ was is poured into the church
[56:25] hallelujah praise God hallelujah amen
[56:29] Lord of God I'm just moving on because I
[56:31] don't want to dwell on on those things
[56:34] right there praise the name of the Lord
[56:37] now praise God let me see if I got one
[56:40] page here I don't want to miss out on
[56:43] anything uh for you praise the Lord yes
[56:47] okay
[56:48] now
[56:49] we go to Genesis 5 1.
[56:53] this is the book of the generations of
[56:57] Adam
[56:58] in the day that God created man in the
[57:03] likeness of him made he him
[57:07] male and female created he them and
[57:12] blessed them and called their name
[57:16] Adam
[57:18] amen praise God in the day when they
[57:23] were created you see so they appear to
[57:25] be seen like two persons but in the mind
[57:29] of God is actually one person
[57:33] because the wife was in the husband
[57:38] amen she was in Adam it was there until
[57:42] God separated them she was in him and he
[57:47] called their name Adam praise the lord
[57:51] it's the same thing happening again now
[57:53] with the second Adam praise God that she
[57:57] was in him and now she comes forth not
[58:00] as one woman but as a many-membered body
[58:03] but their name is still Christ Jesus
[58:08] Christ amen see so Christ is the mystery
[58:13] of all of God being now revealed now
[58:18] being revealed or expressed or
[58:20] manifested entire human race praise God
[58:24] hallelujah amen hallelujah so now I'm
[58:29] going to show you
[58:31] when you're raised up
[58:33] and God raised Jesus from the dead you
[58:37] understand he raised you up already also
[58:41] praise God so you understand because we
[58:45] were in him when he was taken to the
[58:49] grave and raised up
[58:52] you were raised up in him
[58:55] we were raised up in him because we are
[58:58] one with him and in him
[59:00] praise God he raised you up also and
[59:04] also quick little life with him you are
[59:07] now quickened to life not give an
[59:11] eternal life but Quicken to the life
[59:13] that's already in you the life that is
[59:16] in you've been woke up
[59:18] has been quickened brought you to
[59:21] awareness to recognition you come out of
[59:24] your spiritual Amnesia and you begin to
[59:27] clearly recognize you are different
[59:31] no matter how much you you're a human
[59:34] you got to do the same thing as Mortals
[59:37] and you gotta walk us Mortals but there
[59:40] is something in your heart you recognize
[59:42] individually personally that you are
[59:46] different you are mad different because
[59:48] God made us that way and place him apart
[59:52] of himself within us praise the name of
[59:55] the Lord
[59:59] you came to church or you got born again
[1:00:02] some of you knew it before you even
[1:00:04] stepped into a test building
[1:00:06] you were different and you didn't know
[1:00:08] why but praise God for this great day
[1:00:11] and hour God opening the word revealing
[1:00:14] himself and making himself known to his
[1:00:17] children
[1:00:18] hallelujah oh my see remember
[1:00:24] now that though you see you were
[1:00:27] quickened right there but you see though
[1:00:31] you were an attribute only in his
[1:00:33] thoughts but God served it all in him
[1:00:38] so when he died buried rose again God is
[1:00:43] seen not just Jesus but you're seeing
[1:00:46] him and his bride all in him
[1:00:49] praise God Hallelujah for remember he
[1:00:53] went there to Golgotha
[1:00:56] with you in him
[1:01:00] God had never yet never separated the
[1:01:04] bride from the broom yet
[1:01:07] amen she was in him you remember before
[1:01:11] God said oh it's not good for a man to
[1:01:13] be alone that Adam was alone in the
[1:01:16] garden
[1:01:17] and then God says it's not good for him
[1:01:19] to be alone so I'll just separate the
[1:01:22] wife that's in him from him so that he
[1:01:25] can have a companion made out of the
[1:01:28] same product as himself amen I won't use
[1:01:31] the dirt that's there as I'm there but
[1:01:33] I'll just use PARTA himself amen so this
[1:01:37] is what's happening it's actually
[1:01:39] happening now in our day not with the
[1:01:42] first Adam this is happening now with
[1:01:45] the new creation of the second Adam God
[1:01:48] is now doing the same thing praise God
[1:01:51] so so you see he had never separated the
[1:01:56] bride from the groom as yet
[1:02:00] so when God looked down upon the body of
[1:02:03] Christ he saw bought male and female it
[1:02:09] was all being redeemed in one body
[1:02:12] hallelujah praise Peter God lord of God
[1:02:16] they are one
[1:02:19] they are the same word
[1:02:21] because whatever Adam was made out God
[1:02:25] made her out from Adam brother Brandon
[1:02:28] said she was not he didn't go back to
[1:02:31] the ground to find some no he took part
[1:02:35] of Adam himself now he has taken a part
[1:02:38] of the second Adam who is the word amen
[1:02:42] and made her the bride the wife for this
[1:02:46] great day and for this hour amen so the
[1:02:50] same word that spoke or speaks of the
[1:02:54] Bride of the groom is speaking of the
[1:02:57] brain
[1:02:59] so when we say the Mighty God unveiled
[1:03:03] that was only talking about the head
[1:03:06] being unveiled but when it talks he
[1:03:10] preached again and now he preached on
[1:03:11] the unveiling of God he's talking not
[1:03:15] only of the God God himself but he's
[1:03:19] talking about now the unveiling of the
[1:03:22] Bride young failing of the wife being
[1:03:25] mad no Hallelujah hidden Parables hidden
[1:03:29] all kinds of Parables and veils and hid
[1:03:32] behind all kinds of things the secret
[1:03:35] the mystery of God now to be met known
[1:03:38] in this day in this hour when the seals
[1:03:42] are revealed and he's trying to speak to
[1:03:44] his own people that they might
[1:03:46] understand what he has been doing down
[1:03:48] Through the Ages amen praise God you see
[1:03:52] the same word spoke of the groom speaks
[1:03:55] of the bride God foresaw the bride in
[1:03:59] the groom hallelujah praise be to God
[1:04:03] Amen all in that wonderful to know is
[1:04:07] the same yesterday and today and forever
[1:04:09] Christ is the mystery of God
[1:04:14] revealed
[1:04:15] God Christ is the mystery of God now
[1:04:20] being revealed in bright form for his
[1:04:24] honor and Glory because the Mighty God
[1:04:27] using a prophet Malachi 4 5 unveiled
[1:04:31] himself
[1:04:32] to us that he is real
[1:04:35] that he is the supernatural Mighty God
[1:04:38] that rules the universe
[1:04:40] Elohim and that's why his name is plural
[1:04:44] because he is one God but he had all
[1:04:49] this many membered body in him as
[1:04:51] thoughts as attributes now expressed
[1:04:54] upon the Earth for the glory of God so
[1:04:57] the Mighty God unveiled before us and
[1:05:01] the prophet has unveiled a word like no
[1:05:04] man has ever done
[1:05:06] yeah that word was unveiled through him
[1:05:09] to us to this day so that we can come to
[1:05:13] an understanding and a recognition of
[1:05:16] him and who he really is blessed be the
[1:05:20] name of the Lord hallelujah amen oh yes
[1:05:23] so God speaking through that Prophet
[1:05:27] clearly made it clear and clear to us
[1:05:31] that he is the head of everything
[1:05:34] he has the king he is king of kings and
[1:05:37] Lord of lords and he asked me Eminence
[1:05:40] amen hallelujah amen yes sir so we
[1:05:45] understand we are here not to recognize
[1:05:47] William branham's words
[1:05:50] we love and respect brother Bradham yeah
[1:05:54] but we are here to recognize God's word
[1:05:57] the word being made known through the
[1:06:00] prophet of this hour
[1:06:02] that's what we are to recognize
[1:06:04] Hallelujah unlike the wise men of old
[1:06:07] when they're locked up in the heavens
[1:06:10] they were reading their Bibles and they
[1:06:13] didn't have Bibles then but I'm just
[1:06:14] using that to tell you they might have
[1:06:16] been using reading Scrolls of the child
[1:06:18] of the talmud and of the Torah and they
[1:06:21] are reading the books of Moses and as
[1:06:24] they were reading it was wonderful that
[1:06:27] was righteousness for that time but as
[1:06:29] they were reading it and they saw the
[1:06:32] star of the Eastern Star up in the
[1:06:35] heavens they recognized the scriptures
[1:06:37] had said when you see the star of Jesse
[1:06:41] raised in the sky amen you know that the
[1:06:45] Messiah has to be on the earth now
[1:06:47] praise God and we now in our day we look
[1:06:51] around and when we see the Western Star
[1:06:54] William Marion Branham use of God with a
[1:06:59] life and a Ministry no Pentecostal no
[1:07:03] Minister since the days of Jesus Christ
[1:07:06] amen their life their ministry will
[1:07:09] never enter never match up they can only
[1:07:13] talk against it but they cannot match it
[1:07:16] oh my but God put the western style for
[1:07:20] us to recognize that day is almost done
[1:07:23] and at evening time it shall be like so
[1:07:27] he sends a prophet on the scene the
[1:07:30] Shine the Light of the Gospel Upon Our
[1:07:32] Hearts for us to recognize what is being
[1:07:35] done in this day an hour hallelujah
[1:07:38] praise God now John the Baptist knew
[1:07:42] that when when his ministry began
[1:07:46] Hallelujah if I am here on the Earth
[1:07:51] and Malachi again uh I can't remember
[1:07:55] Malachi one or part of Malachi 3 where
[1:07:59] it tells you that he would send this
[1:08:01] messenger before his face
[1:08:04] and he says now before his face so if I
[1:08:08] am here already on the earth and animals
[1:08:12] ready uh
[1:08:14] 33 years old or 30 years old and he is
[1:08:19] just like six months younger than me
[1:08:21] then he's got to be on the earth now
[1:08:24] there's got to be on the earth how am I
[1:08:26] gonna fall run and if he's not here
[1:08:28] so John caught the Revelation for
[1:08:31] himself
[1:08:33] that Jesus had to be on earth somewhere
[1:08:36] but who is this lamb who is this Jesus
[1:08:39] he didn't know but the Bible tells us
[1:08:42] when Jesus began to walk down that Shore
[1:08:46] and John looked up on him he recognized
[1:08:49] Hallelujah nobody told him but by your
[1:08:52] Revelation he knew this is the one and
[1:08:55] he said behold the word Behold the Lamb
[1:08:58] of God that taken away the sins of the
[1:09:01] world Amen he knew that Messiah had to
[1:09:04] be on earth now Hallelujah and so in
[1:09:08] this hour we see the same thing when we
[1:09:11] see the western star in the sky we
[1:09:14] recognize the fullness of the word has
[1:09:17] to be on the earth now the person of
[1:09:21] Jesus Christ has to be already here on
[1:09:23] the earth now
[1:09:25] praise Peter God hallelujah so we have
[1:09:30] recognized him in the word praise the
[1:09:33] Lord amen we realize also that brother
[1:09:38] Brandon William Marion Branham did not
[1:09:40] break the Seven Seals
[1:09:43] the Bible says it plainly the lamb broke
[1:09:47] the seals so then as humans we are
[1:09:50] looking and a man comes out to the
[1:09:53] platform and he preaches the word he
[1:09:56] opens the revelation of the mystery
[1:09:58] that's been hit in the world word of God
[1:10:01] for ages and ages and nobody could open
[1:10:04] it they all had little insights here
[1:10:07] little insights there and said a little
[1:10:09] good things partially here partially
[1:10:11] there but now the whole thing unfolds
[1:10:14] before our eyes and it's done through
[1:10:17] William Marion Branham and a lot of
[1:10:21] people want to put emphasis on the man
[1:10:24] William Marion Branham God bless him God
[1:10:27] continue to bless him and all that he
[1:10:30] has done for the glory of God but
[1:10:32] realize that it was the lamb came down
[1:10:35] and the lamb spoke through his lips
[1:10:38] that's why he presents that for the
[1:10:41] spirit speaks through the prophet amen
[1:10:44] and then what are greater than Solomon
[1:10:47] is here here oh my God himself is his
[1:10:52] own interpreter he will make it plain
[1:10:55] amen there is a man here that can turn
[1:10:59] on the light amen not William Branham
[1:11:01] but Jesus Christ amen anointed by the
[1:11:04] word of the Living God hallelujah yes
[1:11:08] sir so we understand that
[1:11:10] with the coming of the mighty Angel The
[1:11:15] Covenant angel with the rainbow around
[1:11:18] his head which is Christ
[1:11:21] which is our bridegroom
[1:11:24] who is the headship of the entire bride
[1:11:28] body
[1:11:29] and our spiritual husband
[1:11:32] praise God the Lord Jesus Christ then
[1:11:35] when the mighty angel came down
[1:11:39] then Jesus Christ is on earth now
[1:11:43] he is here with us
[1:11:45] praise the Lord
[1:11:46] descending and now revealing and making
[1:11:49] no of himself Isaac talking to Rebecca
[1:11:53] once again making himself known to her
[1:11:56] as she talks to him he's talking back to
[1:11:59] her by the opening of the word oh
[1:12:02] blessed be the name of the Lord just
[1:12:04] waiting now to take his bride away and
[1:12:08] take her by translation through the
[1:12:11] abundance of Revelation glory to God
[1:12:14] hallelujah amen what have we learned yes
[1:12:18] sir about this unveiling of the Mighty
[1:12:21] God Amen was God making himself known to
[1:12:26] the present day spiritual Rebecca the

[1:12:42] Supernatural
[1:12:44] fantastic or fantasy this is not a
[1:12:46] fantasy
[1:12:47] this is not some illusion or some
[1:12:51] science fiction something written up by
[1:12:54] a man to delude your mind or something
[1:12:57] like that you're not believing in some

[1:13:19] Eternal Word of God hallelujah I don't
[1:13:22] have to be here none of us have to be

[1:14:04] word identifying Isaac so that she will
[1:14:07] know him when she's spend enough time
[1:14:10] with the word or spending of time
[1:14:13] listening to the text when she's
[1:14:15] spending us time you know hearing him
[1:14:18] studying the word praying being with him
[1:14:21] in his presence she begins to notice and
[1:14:24] take his as peculiarities

[1:14:30] recognizes footsteps recognizes voice
[1:14:35] she began to recognize everything about
[1:14:37] him praise the name of the Lord
[1:14:40] hallelujah in that way he becomes the
[1:14:43] head of the body

[1:15:09] today mainly about the unveiling of her
[1:15:13] the wife praise the Lord I've been
[1:15:16] talking and there about the unveiling of
[1:15:19] God the head
[1:15:22] him Jesus making himself known but she
[1:15:27] inspired him
[1:15:28] so when it says unveiling of God as a
[1:15:31] prophet said it's speaking of them both
[1:15:34] in one praise the Lord because now he's
[1:15:38] come to marry her back to himself for
[1:15:41] her to where does he come from his side
[1:15:44] and was separated for a while from his
[1:15:46] side now the time must come when she's
[1:15:50] supposed to go back to his side amen and
[1:15:54] so we are on our trip now we are not
[1:15:56] joining now we are traveling back to God
[1:15:59] as the light will come from God then you
[1:16:02] go to God this world is not her home
[1:16:05] we're just a passing through or
[1:16:07] Treasures are LED up Way Beyond the blue

[1:16:26] to him praise God hallelujah amen yes
[1:16:31] sir Hallelujah let me tell you friends
[1:16:33] we are just we were just attributes but
[1:16:36] God saw it all from beginning to end
[1:16:40] Hallelujah a scripture just came to my
[1:16:43] mind and I I didn't know exactly where
[1:16:46] to place some of these scriptures so I
[1:16:49] just put them here but what did he say
[1:16:53] in Revelation Revelation 10 when when
[1:16:59] the seven angels will come and he begins
[1:17:02] to preach the mystery of God would be
[1:17:05] what 50. is that right
[1:17:08] so you'll see how we were thinking this
[1:17:12] great mysterious something is going to
[1:17:14] be finished it's talking about the work
[1:17:16] of finishing up the bride right it's
[1:17:19] going to be finished and the Seven Angel
[1:17:22] comes to do what send out the word which
[1:17:25] will finish the mystery complete the
[1:17:28] mystery and call the last ones in
[1:17:31] wherever they are and the Mystery would
[1:17:34] be finished then hallelujah amen amen
[1:17:38] right quoting brother Brandon
[1:17:41] you don't mind this no no amen praise
[1:17:45] the Lord I don't want to uh to sound too
[1:17:48] much that I am sedated to the point that
[1:17:52] I I I get too soft
[1:17:55] because I'm excited personally and I
[1:17:58] don't want to get too excited that I
[1:18:00] don't get the truth out to you and just
[1:18:03] to Ramble On I want you to be sure
[1:18:05] because we handled here quoting brother
[1:18:07] Brandon but remember
[1:18:10] he went there with you in him
[1:18:14] for God had never separated the bride
[1:18:18] from that bridegroom yet amen but God
[1:18:22] foresaw the bride in the groom now let's
[1:18:27] go to the word we go over to the
[1:18:30] Philadelphian Church age page 295 and
[1:18:34] there's been a lot of preaching about
[1:18:36] this in the Church of Lake praise God
[1:18:38] from the marriage of the Gentile bride
[1:18:41] and bridegroom amen and uh Brothers
[1:18:45] talking about the the husband will never
[1:18:47] fail his wife it's all there the spirit
[1:18:50] is there and it's being picked up and
[1:18:52] it's being preached listen read Isaiah
[1:18:55] 96 brother Brandon was saying this 9
[1:18:59] verse 6 and the government shall be upon
[1:19:03] his shoulder
[1:19:04] what does this mean the answer is this
[1:19:08] government up on his shoulder it comes
[1:19:11] from the wedding ceremony of the East
[1:19:15] see when the bride has been committed to
[1:19:19] the groom
[1:19:20] then the time comes she takes off the
[1:19:24] Veil see and president on the groom's
[1:19:27] shoulders signifying not only is she
[1:19:30] under his Dominion she has transformed
[1:19:34] her rights to him he is now her head and
[1:19:39] also he Bears now responsibilities for
[1:19:43] her and care for her and that he and he
[1:19:48] alone no one else no other man no other
[1:19:52] power has any right or any
[1:19:55] responsibility and that beloved is the
[1:19:58] Key of David God being Sovereign you
[1:20:03] everything by Divine decree exactly who
[1:20:06] would be in his bride hallelujah praise
[1:20:10] God see he chose her I won't go on but
[1:20:13] the point is that now the unveiling of
[1:20:18] God
[1:20:20] the time has come for the lifting of the
[1:20:23] veil from off of the Bride that people
[1:20:25] might recognize the public display of
[1:20:29] God in Christ Christ in the church the
[1:20:31] bride manifesting God to the hour that
[1:20:34] we are living in blessed be the name of
[1:20:36] the Living God hallelujah amen praise
[1:20:39] God isn't he wonderful
[1:20:42] she takes off the Veil
[1:20:45] Hallelujah in the wonderful he takes the
[1:20:47] veil off praise God and now the veil
[1:20:51] from the bride is lifted
[1:20:53] oh my oh my goodness you are you've seen
[1:20:57] some you've never seen the old Indian
[1:21:00] movies from India where are China when
[1:21:04] the bride is getting married their face
[1:21:08] is covered with a veil many other
[1:21:10] cultures would have that process also
[1:21:13] even here in the west we have that
[1:21:15] process but it's by wearing I don't know
[1:21:17] what you call that cloth that uh that
[1:21:20] type of mess or cloth they wear over
[1:21:22] over their faces or around their faces
[1:21:26] to the side but really that's supposed
[1:21:28] to be all around so that they are veiled
[1:21:31] Avail and the bridegroom but then he's
[1:21:35] seen them before he's seen them all the
[1:21:37] time but now she comes there as a
[1:21:40] ceremony with her face Veil but now he
[1:21:44] is saying praise God God is to fail now
[1:21:47] has to come off because it's marrying
[1:21:49] times a marriage age amen he's looking
[1:21:53] for the bride and the invisible Union
[1:21:55] age amen when each individual comes into
[1:22:00] a relationship with God Amen and you
[1:22:04] walk with him and talk with him praise
[1:22:06] the name of the Lord uh I did not he's
[1:22:09] reminding me now I did not bring a coat
[1:22:12] where he said here the time must come
[1:22:15] when Jehovah is now taking the veil of
[1:22:19] God
[1:22:21] Jehovah is God
[1:22:23] how's he going to take the veil off God
[1:22:26] you see how is he going to take the bell
[1:22:28] of God but he's not talking about
[1:22:30] himself he's talking taking the veil off
[1:22:34] his bride
[1:22:35] that she could have made manifest and he
[1:22:38] could look right into her face and she
[1:22:40] could look at him also praise be to God
[1:22:43] with nothing standing there before
[1:22:45] because the veil is lifted off of her
[1:22:48] praise the name of the Lord of course we
[1:22:51] know that the bride is God's Masterpiece
[1:22:54] how many knows that
[1:22:56] why is that a masterpiece
[1:22:58] Michelangelo takes so many years laying
[1:23:01] on his back in that look I I went in
[1:23:04] that Sistine Chapel and see that handy
[1:23:07] work let me tell you something that man
[1:23:09] had to be inspired by God or he couldn't
[1:23:12] do that oh my goodness every piece
[1:23:16] everything Perfection
[1:23:17] amen and the same way whether badam used
[1:23:21] that illustration he says in the same
[1:23:23] way God himself was doing what creating
[1:23:27] a masterpiece but his Masterpiece was
[1:23:30] not a painting the Masterpiece was
[1:23:33] persons people I pray a body he was
[1:23:37] shaping and forming from the what just
[1:23:40] as much as Adam was formed even so Eve
[1:23:45] was being formed but she was being
[1:23:47] formed with a part of himself amen and
[1:23:51] it took him my friends these great
[1:23:54] agents amen hallelujah you know any
[1:23:57] artist when he's working on the
[1:23:58] masterpiece
[1:23:59] he works on it and he works on it in
[1:24:02] secret
[1:24:03] he does it behind closed doors
[1:24:06] and if any public person is going to
[1:24:09] come in there he covers it with a cloth
[1:24:12] or something he covers it up he doesn't
[1:24:15] want it to be seen until he's finished
[1:24:16] and then when he's finished then he
[1:24:19] whips It Off from from that to display
[1:24:22] now now the public can see it because
[1:24:25] they're not going to just sing
[1:24:27] Wesley like that they're going to see
[1:24:30] the entire thing so now I can take the
[1:24:33] van off of it the unveiling of the
[1:24:35] Mighty God before his people for the
[1:24:38] glory of God hallelujah amen yes sir
[1:24:42] when he's when he's done with that he
[1:24:44] can say man can I see your painting
[1:24:47] today can I see your scripture today yes
[1:24:50] I can I can show my my great uh
[1:24:55] scripture to you now and he whips it off
[1:24:58] and what does he say it is finished
[1:25:01] it is finished the Battle Is Over the
[1:25:06] victory is won it's all finished now you
[1:25:09] can look at it and see it because now
[1:25:12] the bride is separated from the bright
[1:25:14] room and you can recognize her in our
[1:25:16] own right son of man now being revealed
[1:25:19] as it was in the days of lot and then
[1:25:23] nor and so on we see the son of man now
[1:25:27] being revealed not in the New Testament
[1:25:30] but now in this day and in this hour
[1:25:34] being revealed to us again for the glory
[1:25:37] of God so that we can come into public
[1:25:40] viewing
[1:25:42] and the prophet said it in his own way
[1:25:44] that the time but at the time when uh
[1:25:48] that statement was made when he talked
[1:25:51] about the bride will have to come to the
[1:25:54] place where you know she's gonna have to
[1:25:57] be on failed publicly
[1:26:00] publicly for a short season and then the
[1:26:04] people will begin to recognize that that
[1:26:07] she's got to be the bride she is the one
[1:26:11] that is chosen for himself amen he'll be
[1:26:14] of a public display but for only a short
[1:26:18] season that when the Rapture is close
[1:26:21] it's the shorter season than you expect
[1:26:24] or that you can recognize or know the
[1:26:28] world goes on us and always there's oh
[1:26:30] they're talking about the end of the
[1:26:32] world and people have been talking about
[1:26:34] that and says that in James that they're
[1:26:36] going to mock saying that I mean talking
[1:26:38] about the end of the world the end of
[1:26:40] the world doesn't come yet they're
[1:26:42] talking about right Jesus coming he
[1:26:44] hasn't come yet they're talking about
[1:26:46] Rapture uh you know I talk about the
[1:26:48] comment already it hasn't come yet and
[1:26:50] when the people get dumbed down and they
[1:26:53] don't think that it's there anymore
[1:26:56] suddenly he comes on the scene and calls
[1:27:00] people away for his glory and for his
[1:27:04] honor amen hallelujah so we thank God he
[1:27:08] didn't build his Masterpiece in one day
[1:27:11] some people think he built the bride
[1:27:14] only on our age but he's been building
[1:27:16] the bride Through the Ages some from
[1:27:20] Luther some from Wesley some from
[1:27:22] methodists right on down through here
[1:27:25] he's been building them do you know in
[1:27:27] every single Church any kind you can
[1:27:30] think of with any fantastic name on it
[1:27:33] God already had Bridal class people in
[1:27:37] there
[1:27:38] doesn't matter what you think so this
[1:27:41] denomination they're in there that's
[1:27:43] what he was trying to tell Elijah when
[1:27:45] he likes that oh I'm the only one that
[1:27:47] loves you I'm the only Prophet that you
[1:27:50] have now God says yes that is true but
[1:27:53] look over there
[1:27:55] right I've got some hiding in Jezebel
[1:27:59] Palace she right there
[1:28:02] and and they're eating from our table
[1:28:06] food that's being offered to false gods
[1:28:09] and I'm letting them eat that food why
[1:28:12] because they already know that food has
[1:28:14] no effect on them
[1:28:16] they already know that food is not going
[1:28:18] to really sustain them and they
[1:28:21] recognize me but I have them there why
[1:28:23] because they may have to talk to some
[1:28:26] other seed or something in there and God
[1:28:28] causes them to recognize that now what
[1:28:30] I'm saying there are a lot of message
[1:28:32] preachers don't believe it but I believe
[1:28:34] there is not elected Jehovah in the
[1:28:36] message we got the with the lexed in
[1:28:38] this now the elector everywhere
[1:28:42] everywhere so that's why we have to
[1:28:44] watch what we talk what we say Amen yes
[1:28:48] because God have them hidden up
[1:28:49] everywhere and when he is ready he calls
[1:28:52] them out to himself for his glory amen
[1:28:55] praise God the veil is now being lifted
[1:28:58] from our eyes I think there's a song
[1:29:00] that says lift the veil from my eyes and
[1:29:03] let me see
[1:29:05] Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord
[1:29:08] Open the Eyes of My Heart amen praise
[1:29:12] the name of the Lord so the bride comes
[1:29:15] into Plain View amen so the bright the
[1:29:19] left bride is the present day revelation
[1:29:24] of the mystery the unveiling of God the
[1:29:29] wife that he God just like Adam had his
[1:29:34] wife hidden in himself which is the word
[1:29:37] he had his wife hidden within himself
[1:29:41] which is the word and that is why when
[1:29:44] the seventh seal broke he says now
[1:29:47] the spirit is now calling their names
[1:29:52] not their Earthly name like we explained
[1:29:56] that when we left his presence amen as a
[1:30:00] spirit beings amen we have to come here
[1:30:04] and be placed in a body and like like
[1:30:08] Mary was told or call that body call
[1:30:11] that a child Jesus
[1:30:13] amen you come down here and you have to
[1:30:16] have an Earthly name
[1:30:17] but then that is not your name that he
[1:30:21] knows you by
[1:30:23] and he knows you by that name
[1:30:26] and that name
[1:30:28] cannot really be written down but when
[1:30:30] the word of God is preached then the
[1:30:34] spirit of God by the preachment of the
[1:30:35] word calls your name
[1:30:38] how do you know your name is being
[1:30:40] called you can call my name in the
[1:30:42] darkest night and I don't have to think
[1:30:45] about it unconsciously I right away I
[1:30:47] want to know who's calling me
[1:30:50] who's calling me unconsciously yeah you
[1:30:53] know when the word is being preached you
[1:30:56] you
[1:30:57] I can't explain it but you will feel or
[1:31:00] hear something
[1:31:03] pulling you from out of that word it's
[1:31:05] pulling on your spirit it's appealing to
[1:31:08] your soul not your reason
[1:31:11] it don't make sense this is that dude no
[1:31:15] to your soul amen praise the name of the
[1:31:18] Lord hallelujah for God for his
[1:31:21] wonderful hidden Mystery amen this great
[1:31:25] mystery of all the ages where God was
[1:31:29] building his Masterpiece go back to the
[1:31:31] quotation we gave where brother Brandon
[1:31:33] says don't you know he's been building
[1:31:35] feet
[1:31:37] right on up
[1:31:39] up to the speaking in terms up through
[1:31:42] the body right to the age of the seeing
[1:31:45] age and after that seeing age of a
[1:31:48] prophetic Ministry there's no more
[1:31:51] moving parts
[1:31:52] is that right it goes right back to the
[1:31:56] age of the Mind amen and goes right down
[1:32:00] to the soul back to the world where it
[1:32:03] come from praise the name of the Lord
[1:32:06] hallelujah amen so Through the Ages what
[1:32:10] have we been seeing we see a mystery
[1:32:13] wrapped in another mystery
[1:32:16] wrapped in another mystery hallelujah
[1:32:19] praise God hallelujah amen so she was
[1:32:23] being formed through the ages from the
[1:32:26] word material that he came he was made
[1:32:30] of Hallelujah now the unveiling of the
[1:32:34] of God or up there the true elect Brian
[1:32:39] didn't start in this age here now it
[1:32:43] started since the day of Pentecost
[1:32:46] the unveiling started from Pentecost
[1:32:49] he's unveiling each part he unveiled
[1:32:52] this part then he unveiled the foot then
[1:32:54] he unveiled uh Wesley the parts that the
[1:32:58] take away Holiness takes away all kinds
[1:33:01] of dirt from the body then he unveiled
[1:33:04] the tongues you know and then he
[1:33:06] unveiled the possibility of discernment
[1:33:08] and God like that the eyes and so on he
[1:33:12] began to do that God was unveiling the
[1:33:16] church but in thoughts
[1:33:19] but now we come to the end when the
[1:33:22] entire thing is coming back together and
[1:33:25] he is unveiling the whole picture before
[1:33:28] us hallelujah for the glory of God Amen
[1:33:32] what blessing it is to know praise the
[1:33:34] Lord now we go if we want to take a
[1:33:37] scriptural background
[1:33:40] we understand that Moses wore a veil on
[1:33:45] his face
[1:33:46] and God was foreshadowing and causing us
[1:33:49] to see this through the word amen that
[1:33:52] this is what he was actually doing
[1:33:54] because Moses was like acting out what
[1:33:57] God himself was doing God had the veil
[1:34:01] and he allowed that veil of the law to
[1:34:04] be on the face of the Jews until this
[1:34:07] very day
[1:34:08] they still have balls at it they still
[1:34:11] have the veil of Moses over their face
[1:34:14] and they can't see the purity of the
[1:34:17] word of God in any kind of a way and and
[1:34:21] so the this veil of rituals
[1:34:25] this veil of laws
[1:34:28] this veil of all kinds of feast days
[1:34:31] everything is a veil that's covering
[1:34:34] them that they can't see the word and
[1:34:38] preventing the word from coming into
[1:34:41] Plain View praise God hallelujah but now
[1:34:46] God has changed as you know he's
[1:34:49] changing back from the Gentiles to go
[1:34:52] back to the Jews
[1:34:54] and to make himself known to them as you
[1:34:57] know he will do on Mount Zion and then
[1:34:59] he'll say they say where where you got
[1:35:01] those holes in your hand well I got it
[1:35:03] from in the house of your my friends I
[1:35:05] got it from you right and then the Bible
[1:35:08] tells us how they're going to repent and
[1:35:10] wail and everything else like that on
[1:35:12] the 144 000 will be called out by the
[1:35:15] ministry of Moses and Elijah amen whom
[1:35:19] they will initially kill and they'll lay
[1:35:22] in the streets for three days and to
[1:35:24] prove that their gods indeed original
[1:35:28] servants amen the Bible says God will
[1:35:32] raise them up because they're going to
[1:35:35] leave their bodies in the streets to
[1:35:37] desecrate them and and to leave them
[1:35:40] there to rock in the streets but instead
[1:35:42] of rotting it on rice and they stand on
[1:35:45] their feet and give glory to God and
[1:35:47] Revival will break out in Israel
[1:35:50] Hallelujah and that's why the spirit of
[1:35:52] God says to brother Branham do don't go
[1:35:55] with them he went right to the borders
[1:35:57] he says do not go there
[1:36:00] it is not your part to do that
[1:36:04] Elijah and Moses will come and they will
[1:36:06] do that
[1:36:07] amen so he had to turn around we face
[1:36:11] fear and everything you turn around come
[1:36:12] right back to America because God was
[1:36:15] going to do that but now it's changing
[1:36:17] it's now right now it's the Gentiles are
[1:36:22] the ones that being unveiled from the
[1:36:25] nominational veils from all kinds of
[1:36:28] traditional unveils of rituals that they
[1:36:32] have had to go through in all these
[1:36:33] Church ages they had to have these
[1:36:36] things taken away from them and they who
[1:36:40] were spiritual blind and walking in
[1:36:43] spiritual Darkness like that and in
[1:36:45] ignorance of the word of God the veil is
[1:36:49] being lifted off of us by the word of
[1:36:53] God being unveiled to us in this day and
[1:36:56] in this hour praise God hallelujah and
[1:36:59] so here she stands like a Statue of
[1:37:02] Liberty
[1:37:03] the bride standing there on a pedestal
[1:37:07] in the in the air before the entire
[1:37:09] world but because there is no beauty
[1:37:12] that was desired of him
[1:37:16] now there is no Beauty to be the desired
[1:37:20] of her
[1:37:22] brother Brandon said that's why she's
[1:37:24] called God's Speckled Bird right
[1:37:27] speckled with the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:37:30] amen o praise God hallelujah praise God
[1:37:35] how wonderful I'm gonna I'm gonna just
[1:37:37] uh just the free will continue free
[1:37:40] willing and talking to you here you see
[1:37:42] my brother's sister
[1:37:44] that now she's on that pedestal and now
[1:37:48] the whole mystery is just about finished
[1:37:52] the last one about to be called of
[1:37:55] course you know there's many many more
[1:37:56] things I could have said but it's only
[1:37:58] so much time we have and and I feel that
[1:38:02] I've I've come to the closer end of what
[1:38:05] I wanted to get out you can take
[1:38:07] whatever you see or hear study the
[1:38:11] scriptures reach out in the word of God
[1:38:13] and let the Holy Spirit make known
[1:38:15] himself to you but it's not over in this
[1:38:20] sense
[1:38:21] now that she or any painting is put on
[1:38:25] the pedestal or put on the wall for
[1:38:28] viewing
[1:38:29] she must now go through the Hall of
[1:38:31] critics
[1:38:35] and God allows her to stand there
[1:38:39] to Bear the reproach for his word
[1:38:43] because she know him herself
[1:38:47] that she is perfection
[1:38:50] Perfection for Perfection dwells within
[1:38:54] outward leaves this that that the other
[1:38:56] and that's the devil's job is going to
[1:38:58] say look at this look at that did you
[1:38:59] hear that did you see that did you yes
[1:39:01] that's the devil's job but that man
[1:39:04] inside that woman Inside perfect amen
[1:39:07] but the prophet said it clear it's plain
[1:39:10] now that she's displayed she got to pass
[1:39:14] through the Hall of the critics
[1:39:16] is that right oh my wow just think of it
[1:39:21] the word already passed through what
[1:39:25] after it was preached it had to go
[1:39:27] through indictment and crucifixion
[1:39:30] so that she could rise up to be on the
[1:39:35] scene and to be unveiled hallelujah
[1:39:38] praise God but she got to go through
[1:39:40] another book of Acts where she has got
[1:39:43] to walk and said this is not Moses law
[1:39:46] let's kill them let's burn them let's do
[1:39:49] this let's do that so look it's not
[1:39:51] telling you that this is just an easy
[1:39:53] Road
[1:39:55] amen it's not an easy Road even though
[1:39:57] you recognize what God has done what he
[1:40:00] is doing you must recognize along with
[1:40:03] that comes the critics the buzzards
[1:40:07] and all the other things that go with it
[1:40:10] so we must bear the reproach for the
[1:40:12] word of God
[1:40:14] praise the Lord he's wonderful isn't he
[1:40:17] musicians can you come praise the Lord
[1:40:20] and now we're going to uh
[1:40:27] amen praise the name of the Lord yes be
[1:40:31] certainly will
[1:40:33] um do that by the musicians are coming
[1:40:35] praise the Lord
[1:40:37] I'm glad that I don't know about you
[1:40:40] about you
[1:40:42] but one thing I'm asserting off that God
[1:40:46] has opened my eyes to see the revelation
[1:40:49] of the word in its fullness
[1:40:54] and
[1:40:56] you can look around wherever you want
[1:40:58] but I'm telling you I've got a hold of
[1:41:02] something or something got a hold of me
[1:41:05] that is making this word sing sing to
[1:41:09] you that you can hear him through the
[1:41:12] word
[1:41:13] amen that's not me talking about myself
[1:41:15] but that's just me telling you because
[1:41:18] for a fact that is so and it ties right
[1:41:20] into this Bible praise the Lord and may
[1:41:23] God bless you if you recognize what God
[1:41:26] is doing may God bless you in a
[1:41:28] wonderful and in a remarkable way praise

[1:41:35] what what's that song that says the
[1:41:37] baptism or you got you you have

[1:42:42] is that right amen but the battle is now
[1:42:46] over the victory is one the lamb has
[1:42:49] prevailed hallelujah amen the conflict
[1:42:52] is over praise God Amen spiritually
