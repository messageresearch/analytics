[26:16] and guided me and i give god praise
[26:19] honor and glory
[26:20] and god said
[26:23] let the earth bring forth grass
[26:26] the herb yielding seed
[26:30] and the fruit tree yielding fruit
[26:33] after
[26:34] his kind
[26:36] whose seed
[26:38] is in itself
[26:41] upon the earth
[26:43] and it was so
[26:46] gracious father we thank you for
[26:49] this written word of the bible
[26:52] preserved and kept through the ages
[26:56] so that never mind every attempt to boil
[27:00] burn destroy it
[27:02] that we might not have a record of it
[27:04] something that we can
[27:07] put in our hearts and in our minds
[27:09] you preserved your word lord

[27:16] away and the anvil of god's word remains
[27:20] the same
[27:21] we thank you for this father and we pray
[27:25] lord that you'll quicken the word to us
[27:29] and make it alive lord and let it live
[27:32] again let the bible live again
[27:35] and oh father we will continue to
[27:38] rejoice in your presence and give you
[27:40] all the praise all the honor and the
[27:43] glory that is due under your marvelous
[27:46] and wonderful name
[27:48] god bless you all please be seated
[27:53] thank god
[27:56] we appreciate
[27:58] every one of you here tonight
[28:00] now
[28:01] i would like i i'm talking on
[28:05] expressed
[28:06] images of god
[28:09] expressed images of god
[28:12] uh and
[28:13] we go back to this wonderful
[28:16] marvelous verse we will touch on that
[28:20] but we know uh brother sister
[28:23] that
[28:24] god is not leaving us in the midst of
[28:27] chaos
[28:28] and in the midst of trial and
[28:30] tribulation
[28:32] that this age has within it
[28:35] we know of course god uses trials
[28:38] tribulation temptations and traps and
[28:41] tests uh uh to refine us right that's
[28:45] the refiners fire that we must pass
[28:48] through from time to time
[28:50] right we'll take the iron or the metal
[28:52] the gold and take it out and leave it
[28:56] let it cool off and then put it back in
[28:58] the fire again and every time it comes
[29:01] out it's of a higher
[29:03] worth and higher
[29:05] refining value and condition and the god
[29:08] does the same thing with us that he can
[29:11] get us to our highest place that we
[29:14] ought to be in him
[29:17] and therefore in every age
[29:20] we find god does that
[29:22] and we know the bible tells us
[29:24] tribulation is coming
[29:27] that tells us plainly
[29:29] the
[29:29] there's an oncoming storm that is about
[29:32] to strike the entire earth
[29:35] but thanks be to god
[29:38] we have god's promise hallelujah praise
[29:41] god we have his promise
[29:44] that we are not going through the
[29:46] tribulation
[29:49] but that we are
[29:51] going to be taken out or away from the
[29:54] tribulation
[29:57] if we're to look at the types in the
[29:59] bible
[30:00] we find that before the rain even fell
[30:04] one drop even fell
[30:07] god had noah and his family in the ark
[30:12] the door was already closed
[30:15] amen
[30:16] oh praise god with luck
[30:20] we see the same thing with lot
[30:23] that uh before uh sodom could be burnt
[30:28] and totally destroyed
[30:30] the angel already had come and said
[30:32] escape
[30:34] hidden quickly amen because i can't
[30:36] destroy this place until you get out of
[30:40] it
[30:40] and praise god god can't display destroy
[30:44] this place until we get out of it
[30:48] and when we get out of it then confusion
[30:51] and chaos you think you're seeing
[30:53] confusion now you think you're seeing
[30:56] chaos now but this is nothing from the
[30:59] time we leave here
[31:02] because we are god he told us we are the
[31:05] salt of the earth
[31:07] and when the salt is taken out and
[31:10] nothing to hinder the devil from his
[31:13] works anymore then he is going to be
[31:17] raging roaring and doing everything that
[31:20] he had in his mind
[31:22] but we will not be here during that time
[31:26] don't take his scarecrows
[31:28] don't you fear nothing
[31:31] the true believer has lost all fear of
[31:34] hell
[31:35] we lost all fear of tribulation
[31:39] because we know we are not going to be
[31:41] in it
[31:43] we are not going to be here at that time
[31:46] because the bride every type every
[31:48] shadow shows she will be out of here
[31:53] look at moses
[31:55] before the dead angel even struck god
[31:59] had spoken to a prophet
[32:02] and warned him to tell the people get in
[32:05] the house
[32:06] paint the blood on the door
[32:09] and stay in the house once you get in
[32:12] and if i see when i see the blood i'll
[32:15] pass i'll pass over you
[32:18] amen and certainly my friends
[32:21] the same thing happens
[32:24] here now
[32:25] that we are not going into any
[32:28] tribulation
[32:30] because remember jesus already took our
[32:34] tribulation on himself
[32:36] he bore all our sins all our trespasses
[32:40] all are mistakes all are wrong he bore
[32:43] them upon himself
[32:45] so he took our tribulation already
[32:48] and that is why the believer is not
[32:51] going into judgment either
[32:53] amen when we hear the word judgment we
[32:56] don't tremble and shake because our
[32:58] judgment is us to our rewards
[33:01] it's towards our blessings our rankings
[33:05] our standing when we get into his divine
[33:09] presence
[33:11] hallelujah but every seed
[33:14] must bring forth after its kind
[33:20] now listen
[33:21] all right
[33:23] every seed must come forth after its
[33:27] kind
[33:28] but god made man
[33:31] in his own image
[33:33] after his kind
[33:36] amen
[33:37] not its kind but after his kind
[33:41] praise god hallelujah
[33:44] now and you see
[33:46] he expressed that image in christ
[33:51] in jesus christ
[33:53] hallelujah now
[33:55] let me pause here a minute
[33:57] a principle was expressed a command was
[34:01] given
[34:02] every seed shall bring forth after its
[34:06] kind
[34:08] and when god speaks the word that word
[34:11] is forever and eternity it goes on it
[34:14] can't stop that law has to go on and on
[34:19] and on because it's the word of god amen
[34:23] and so we see here
[34:25] that
[34:26] the quotation
[34:27] he
[34:28] he was expressed
[34:30] image in jesus christ
[34:32] what was it it was god
[34:35] that was in christ see
[34:38] now
[34:39] there is a man
[34:41] that's after god's kind
[34:45] the man
[34:46] that comes with what god in him
[34:50] the woman that comes with god in her
[34:53] god's children coming with a portion of
[34:57] himself in them
[34:59] and there become the expressed image of
[35:03] god on this earth today
[35:06] hallelujah you may not take much of
[35:08] yourself you may want sometimes to put
[35:11] yourself down
[35:13] but god regardless of how you look how
[35:16] your expression of him looks god purpose
[35:19] and ordained these things so hallelujah
[35:23] we will get and touch upon that just a
[35:25] little bit more that's why we are none
[35:28] of us are like one another
[35:31] we're all expressing him
[35:33] but through the
[35:35] prism of our personalities
[35:38] we express god in
[35:40] all kinds of shining lights of his
[35:42] divine presence
[35:44] uh the thought is now come to me of how
[35:47] brother brahma expressed him as the
[35:49] great diamond
[35:50] and when the diamond scintillates and
[35:53] shines it comes out in all these various
[35:56] colors amen but it's one diamond
[36:01] but many colors are ways of it
[36:04] expressing itself and it's the same way
[36:07] that god is expressing himself and we
[36:11] become
[36:12] express images of god for this hour and
[36:16] for his glory and for his help
[36:19] praise amen
[36:21] now remember
[36:23] how many knows this that
[36:27] he was a man
[36:29] after his kind hallelujah in other words
[36:33] we're talking the stature of a perfect
[36:36] man which is jesus christ amen glory to
[36:39] god now
[36:41] see when the word was in christ
[36:45] a man
[36:47] a human man
[36:51] expressing itself through him
[36:54] that was god
[36:57] that was the word
[37:00] that was in christ
[37:02] expressing
[37:03] himself
[37:05] because god in the beginning
[37:08] made man
[37:10] in his own image
[37:12] hallelujah
[37:14] and that's the kind of man that god has
[37:17] this mind that he wanted to make
[37:21] jesus is a perfect picture
[37:24] and display
[37:26] of god in his express image hallelujah
[37:30] because when god gets in a man
[37:33] then
[37:34] he's the manifest image or the man can
[37:37] manifest the image of god that's in him
[37:40] and that man or woman becomes the
[37:42] express visible image of god here on the
[37:45] earth
[37:47] now
[37:48] that's the kind of of god
[37:52] of man
[37:53] that's the kind of people
[37:56] that god makes
[37:58] today
[38:02] let me repeat that that's the kind of
[38:05] man
[38:06] or woman people
[38:08] that god makes today hallelujah he's
[38:12] talking now about the the new creation
[38:15] the new creation is not a physical
[38:18] creation of of a flesh but it's a new
[38:22] creation hallelujah it's spiritual
[38:26] creation praise god people in other
[38:29] words the new creation is people coming
[38:33] on the earth with the word already built
[38:35] into them
[38:37] the word is a coming as a built-in amen
[38:40] they they come down with that in them
[38:44] praise the lord and to be the expressed
[38:47] images of god hallelujah now see here
[38:53] the seminary
[38:55] what he's saying can't do that
[38:58] because that's uh nothing but an
[39:02] incubator
[39:03] or a actuary
[39:05] see
[39:06] that can only turn up a bunch of hybrids
[39:11] he's talking about people that have part
[39:14] of uh reading the bible and christian
[39:17] acts and christian works
[39:19] and their half bible and half world
[39:22] half bible have flesh
[39:25] they can even have half message and half
[39:27] kernel and carnality carried away with
[39:31] those things but god is looking for a
[39:34] people that would be his express image
[39:38] which is the word
[39:39] that will express the gene the life
[39:42] that's what is in them that he placed
[39:45] there that they will let go enough so
[39:48] that he can express
[39:50] himself his own image through the
[39:54] people now
[39:56] see they do that through them seminaries
[40:00] the schools
[40:01] when god calls a man
[40:04] he is in his own image
[40:07] hallelujah so what is god's image he
[40:10] said that
[40:11] is the word
[40:15] made alive in him
[40:18] or her praise god when the word in you
[40:22] starts coming alive now
[40:24] why i'm so thrilled about this
[40:28] because i understand brother branham
[40:30] said
[40:31] he'll preach the message he's a
[40:33] messenger he came to bring the message
[40:36] after he brings the message
[40:39] people are going to start recognizing
[40:43] is that right then they start hearing
[40:46] and and got a sense that there's
[40:48] something
[40:49] something there that that that is
[40:51] pulling on them but they can't catch it
[40:53] yet then after all he doesn't say it
[40:56] like i'm saying it but i'm expressing it
[40:58] that they can start hearing and on
[41:00] another level or stage of the message
[41:03] maybe years past time past they all of a
[41:07] sudden they're going to recognize
[41:08] they're going to start to recognize now
[41:10] they're going to start recognizing
[41:12] things hallelujah and i thank god i
[41:15] believe that we have an r at that place
[41:20] where we have heard and we are
[41:22] recognized
[41:24] but now
[41:25] what what is it that i'm getting at is
[41:28] now we come to the next stage hearing
[41:30] recognizing and acting on the word but
[41:34] now we understand that acting is not you
[41:37] going out and putting on an act
[41:40] amen
[41:41] but when god is ready for this what we
[41:44] call the quick short work
[41:46] of science wonders miracles
[41:49] it's not going to be you
[41:53] it's going to be him
[41:55] moving through his body
[41:57] it'll be a spontaneous outburst
[42:01] of the power and the presence of
[42:02] almighty god without human effort so
[42:05] that all will know this is not a man
[42:09] this is of the lord this is not the
[42:12] bill this is of the lord this is not the
[42:15] lane this is of the lord this is not of
[42:17] this woman or this boy this is of the
[42:20] lord
[42:21] only god can do these things amen
[42:24] hallelujah and that is what we are in
[42:27] the middle of that right now
[42:30] and we don't know
[42:32] maybe it happens with a few of us one
[42:36] thing here one little thing there but
[42:38] it's going to burst forth
[42:40] amen and when it bursts forth it's every
[42:44] one of us
[42:45] every single one
[42:47] doesn't matter what you do you say oh
[42:50] but i don't want that i don't know if i
[42:51] can handle that let me tell you it's
[42:53] going to happen so simple so humble
[42:56] that you
[42:57] realize the extent to what god using you
[43:00] talk about deborah in the bible you talk
[43:03] about this one in the bible and that one
[43:05] the bible let me tell you the bible is
[43:07] right here
[43:08] people with that same anointing is right
[43:11] here
[43:12] hallelujah amen and the beauty of it is
[43:15] that you may think nothing of yourself
[43:17] which is the way god wants you to
[43:19] just be a humble and relaxed and be in
[43:22] him and just walk hallelujah praise god
[43:25] and not to go there like a pentecostal
[43:28] and say in the name of jesus i cast this
[43:32] devil or i do this or in the name of the
[43:35] lord with authority and come command
[43:38] power and whatnot no
[43:41] the saints of god under this anointing
[43:45] simple and humble
[43:47] go up to a hospital bed of a friend and
[43:50] say oh man i'm sorry this happened to
[43:52] you god bless you everything i'm i'm not
[43:54] giving you a template here because
[43:56] normally that's what you're going to do
[43:57] anyway if the holy spirit is moving on
[43:59] you praise god but then you see you move
[44:02] to the stage where the words you speak
[44:04] their spirit in their life
[44:08] and you just speak and you don't realize
[44:10] that is what he's talking about speaking
[44:12] the word
[44:13] is that getting up there
[44:15] in the name of jesus
[44:18] no it's not it's just walking in him
[44:20] when you walk in him when he's ready
[44:22] he'll express himself
[44:24] hallelujah and you'll be surprised your
[44:27] mans that your own self
[44:29] amen hallelujah before you know it
[44:32] something comes out of your mouth he
[44:33] said think not in that day and in that
[44:36] hour don't even think what you're going
[44:37] to say because the heavenly father will
[44:39] speak through you
[44:41] god will do his works through you amen
[44:44] i'm trying to tell you and i'm telling
[44:46] myself get yourself out of the way
[44:50] amen all the self all the carnality all
[44:53] that get it out of the way so that he
[44:56] can have a vessel to express and
[44:57] manifest himself through praise the name
[45:00] of the lord we're gonna go let's go
[45:02] forward a little bit more praise god now
[45:05] remember
[45:07] god
[45:10] and jesus said
[45:12] that if that man
[45:14] comes in god's image
[45:16] and in his likeness
[45:19] amen he'll do the works that i do praise
[45:23] god see in his image
[45:26] and his lightness in the image of the
[45:29] word
[45:30] and in the likeness or similarity
[45:34] of the works he did when he was here on
[45:36] earth
[45:37] is that right
[45:39] you go certain things going to happen in
[45:41] you through you and around you
[45:43] that will make people to recognize a
[45:47] similarity
[45:49] praise god nothing you're putting on it
[45:51] just happens it's because god is in you
[45:53] working through you for his glory isn't
[45:55] that a beautiful rest that the believers
[45:58] have entered into and those who have not
[46:01] yet entered into can enter into this
[46:03] rest by the holy spirit
[46:07] revealing to you that is not of works
[46:10] but of his will and his plan and his
[46:13] purpose amen praise god
[46:16] now remember
[46:18] he said i repeat his kind
[46:21] his kind
[46:23] what is his kind
[46:25] his kind is the word
[46:29] hallelujah
[46:30] he is the word so then you see
[46:34] if a man
[46:36] claims he claims he is a christian he
[46:39] claims he's of the word
[46:42] then
[46:43] and turns around
[46:45] and denies the word of god
[46:48] then you know that's a hybrid
[46:51] that's a hybrid right there
[46:53] because how can you
[46:57] be the express image of god himself the
[47:00] word
[47:01] and turn around and deny the word
[47:06] you can't do it
[47:08] amen
[47:09] when the word is the express image of
[47:13] himself
[47:14] think of it
[47:15] express image express image of god
[47:20] god bring us here and we become express
[47:23] images of god hallelujah yes
[47:28] he made us in his own image
[47:32] express image praise god while i was
[47:36] reading this you know and then it comes
[47:37] to me like it's just like a photographer
[47:40] right you know brother branham talk
[47:42] about god taking a photograph but just
[47:44] think of a photographer taking pictures
[47:48] and he will take uh pictures of the same
[47:52] object
[47:53] from different angles
[47:56] it's the same object the object can
[47:58] change
[47:59] but he's taking it from different angles
[48:02] so when i express what i see is because
[48:05] i'm expressing it from this angle of
[48:07] what god has shown me and another man
[48:11] another sister another brother oh praise
[48:14] god will express it that way because
[48:17] that's the picture from a different
[48:19] angle one took it on his knees looking
[48:23] up one take it from high up looking down
[48:26] one take it from this angle another take
[48:28] it from that angle another take it from
[48:31] another angle one ticket near one take
[48:34] it from far away but it's the same
[48:37] object and the same picture in the same
[48:41] image
[48:43] but you may think it's different because
[48:45] one take it from far you may think it's
[48:48] different because one ticket from there
[48:50] it's the same image
[48:52] hallelujah on praise god the way we
[48:56] express him within ourselves may be
[48:59] different to him to her to that one to
[49:01] the next one whatever but it's the way
[49:03] god planned purpose and predestinated
[49:06] the entire thing to take place to
[49:09] confuse confuse and overthrow the devil
[49:12] because he doesn't know what's going on
[49:14] it's god in action god expressing
[49:16] themselves making himself known in this
[49:19] hour
[49:20] hallelujah praise god but that uh that
[49:25] photographer doesn't only take it from
[49:28] different angles
[49:30] amen but
[49:32] you got a higher form of photography
[49:35] where
[49:36] some of those guys won't take picture a
[49:39] picture until the light is perfect
[49:43] for what they want
[49:45] the light gonna strike that object from
[49:48] in
[49:48] a certain way before they take that
[49:50] picture so taking the same picture in
[49:54] different lights
[49:56] so
[49:57] everybody is not going to understand
[49:59] everything
[50:00] like this brother or that sister or the
[50:03] other one but each one has something of
[50:06] that image in a different light
[50:10] hallelujah a bright light maybe you've
[50:13] got it with a low light there
[50:15] oh my pray the rest of it you can think
[50:18] on it but
[50:19] the picture is being taken hallelujah
[50:22] the image is there
[50:24] hallelujah maybe a little blurry here
[50:27] maybe a little this there a little but
[50:29] the image is there
[50:31] hallelujah but and god sees the image
[50:35] hallelujah praise god oh blessed be the
[50:38] name of the lord hallelujah and when we
[50:41] know what he's saying here expresses the
[50:44] thought that every
[50:46] gene every child of god comes with the
[50:51] image of god or gene of god in them
[50:54] they come having a certain image of
[50:57] their daddy
[50:59] some little thing about them
[51:02] just like their daddy they can't help it
[51:04] that's just what they are because it's
[51:06] not an act it's it's just what how they
[51:09] are they were born they were made that
[51:11] way praise god and so we find this the
[51:14] same thing with the true
[51:17] believer praise god hallelujah amen so
[51:22] we look at him and express that image is
[51:26] expressed hallelujah and the image goes
[51:31] forth because each one of us may be
[51:34] expressing different parts
[51:37] of his personality
[51:41] you may have more temperance than her
[51:45] he might have more patience than the
[51:47] other brother
[51:50] she might have this and he might have
[51:52] three of those things or four or five or
[51:55] whatever that are predominant they have
[51:57] all
[51:59] but three or four of those things might
[52:00] be predominant
[52:02] until the person is recognized and known
[52:05] that that brother has patience that
[52:07] sister oh that's this kind of temperance
[52:11] and so on so on you understand what the
[52:13] point i'm trying to make here amen
[52:15] praise the lord but everyone has all of
[52:19] it
[52:20] amen but god may choose in this image to
[52:23] emphasize this
[52:25] you may choose in this image to
[52:27] emphasize that what he chooses to do
[52:30] that's up to him
[52:32] but the images of god expressing the
[52:35] word of god has sent down here for his
[52:38] glory and for his honor praise god
[52:42] hallelujah now think of it
[52:47] yes
[52:48] in his own image
[52:50] after his own kind
[52:53] the new of this new creation
[52:55] to be
[52:56] what are they here for to be
[52:59] his expressed image on the earth
[53:04] page 57
[53:06] spoken word the original seed that's a
[53:09] very very uh to the point quotation of
[53:13] brother branham saying it clear that
[53:16] they were predestinated
[53:18] to be here to be the expressed word of
[53:22] god
[53:23] on the earth
[53:25] now jesus
[53:27] talking about back then was god express
[53:30] word
[53:32] on the earth
[53:33] hallelujah then do you believe that then
[53:37] what are we to be this now
[53:41] and this time hallelujah god's word
[53:45] expressed here on the earth hallelujah
[53:49] sons and daughters of god with the
[53:52] express word caring carrying out what
[53:56] that that is the mystical body of jesus
[54:00] christ
[54:01] amen
[54:02] carrying on the same things he did when
[54:06] he was here on earth
[54:08] and that's the kind of people that are
[54:12] after his kind do you believe it
[54:16] amen
[54:17] now
[54:18] if you want to this is brother branham
[54:20] speaking this is not me
[54:23] saying this
[54:24] now you can you can be after the
[54:27] lutheran kind
[54:29] if you want you can be after the
[54:30] lutheran kind
[54:32] now many of you know how years ago he
[54:34] says no
[54:36] talking to me
[54:38] don't go this route
[54:40] you will come after his kind
[54:44] but if you listen to me and listen to
[54:47] this word
[54:48] you'll come after my kind
[54:51] whose side
[54:53] what image you're gonna choose right but
[54:55] here we find brother sister his brother
[54:58] brandman's saying this here now you can
[55:01] have or come after the lutheran kind
[55:05] now
[55:06] or the method is kind
[55:09] or the baptist kind the catholic kind or
[55:12] the pentecostal kind
[55:15] amen
[55:16] after it's kind of oneness or trinity
[55:19] amen hallelujah but if you are of god's
[55:24] kind that is different
[55:27] amen because you are the express image
[55:31] of the word now on earth making itself
[55:34] manifest
[55:37] hallelujah the word now
[55:40] making itself manifest not
[55:43] the word making itself manifest in jesus
[55:46] back there but the true believer becomes
[55:50] the express image of that word to the
[55:54] world
[55:55] right out here for the glory of god oh
[55:58] praise god forevermore amen let me
[56:02] express something here my friends
[56:04] now
[56:05] some people get upset and angry when you
[56:09] preach
[56:10] and you call out the names of other of
[56:13] denominations
[56:16] it irks them it bothers them but you
[56:18] know let me say something i learned
[56:21] something
[56:22] the devil always gets mad you can say
[56:25] that's the devil or or that's the devil
[56:27] or that's wicked or that's evil but when
[56:30] you name that demon
[56:33] oh my goodness you call that demon by
[56:36] his express name he goes wild doesn't
[56:39] matter where he is he goes wild oh my
[56:42] it's the same thing and i see that
[56:45] happening even with uh preaching not
[56:47] that you go purposely to do that but
[56:49] it's there and you've got to say it and
[56:51] when you say it it it brings up all the
[56:54] spirits that are hidden up in people and
[56:57] hidden up around them it just works
[56:59] everything up like that but that's what
[57:01] the word of god says here amen yes sir
[57:05] so
[57:06] you then he said do you see it
[57:10] after god's kind
[57:12] then you are the express image of the
[57:16] word now making itself manifest the word
[57:20] making itself manifest
[57:22] oh my if the water falls on that is on
[57:27] it it's got to do it
[57:30] hallelujah you got a gene in there and
[57:33] the water falls on that it's got to
[57:35] express
[57:36] it's got to do that hallelujah amen
[57:40] now
[57:41] just to bring your attention just a note
[57:43] i had here how that the seven church
[57:46] ages also expressed the image of god
[57:49] but it did it through seven ages coming
[57:52] down coming down coming down and we are
[57:54] now in the last sure this last church
[57:57] age uh i'm talking about coming down
[58:00] through the ages through the the image
[58:02] of a man
[58:04] expressed in the image of the ox
[58:06] expressed in the image of the
[58:08] eagle
[58:09] and we know he's going to express an
[58:11] image of the lion
[58:12] hallelujah and express in the image of
[58:16] what a dead stump
[58:20] and then expressed in the image of a
[58:23] sprout
[58:24] and now in the last age expressed in the
[58:27] image of a
[58:29] bright tree that is blooming by rivers
[58:32] of living waters
[58:34] that is the image that we are moving and
[58:37] operating under here by the holy spirit
[58:41] amen praise the name of the lord how
[58:43] wonderful to know that uh we are god's
[58:47] word expressed and being made manifest
[58:52] in this hour blessed be the name of the
[58:55] lord hallelujah now remember
[58:59] god made man after his own image
[59:02] do you get this
[59:04] a man after his own kind do you
[59:07] understand
[59:09] what what kind of a man then was he
[59:13] if you look back you'll see
[59:16] that when he was made flesh and
[59:19] expressed himself that's the kind of man
[59:23] that's the kind of image amen that god
[59:27] wanted it to be
[59:29] hallelujah so then at another time
[59:34] he looked at david and said
[59:36] you're a man after my own heart
[59:40] what
[59:42] david
[59:44] with all kind of thoughts
[59:46] all kinds of mistakes
[59:49] all kinds of blood on his hands
[59:51] and yet god said you're a man after my
[59:55] own heart
[59:57] and uh
[59:58] put it all in my own words here praise
[1:00:01] god
[1:00:02] you see
[1:00:03] david even in all the stuff that he was
[1:00:06] doing that was ungodly wasn't right
[1:00:09] sinful and so on
[1:00:11] god could see in him he was expressing
[1:00:14] as the great potter was forming this
[1:00:16] image he was already expressing a
[1:00:19] portion
[1:00:21] of that image was already manifesting in
[1:00:24] him
[1:00:25] in other words he had the spirit of
[1:00:27] christ
[1:00:28] manifesting in him because here brother
[1:00:30] branham goes on said you see he already
[1:00:33] had a little portion
[1:00:35] yeah that spirit of christ in him and
[1:00:37] 800 years later what happened now the
[1:00:41] whole word comes on the scene all he had
[1:00:44] was a little portion of the word in him
[1:00:47] amen and it made him do what he did but
[1:00:49] here comes the whole world and it went
[1:00:52] on top of the hill and stood and jesus
[1:00:54] wept up there on the hill oh jerusalem
[1:00:56] oh they're using them as a rejected king
[1:00:59] rejected king there rejected king here
[1:01:01] again it's the same spirit so what he is
[1:01:04] really saying of david is that the image
[1:01:08] that god had in his mind though it was
[1:01:11] not perfect
[1:01:14] in expressing itself true david at the
[1:01:18] time back then
[1:01:20] but as it come up through the edges is
[1:01:22] finding men women that were placed there
[1:01:26] and he can continue to work on his
[1:01:28] pottery if we want to put it that way
[1:01:30] and bring it up until he has the perfect
[1:01:34] one to express himself through whom we
[1:01:38] know is jesus christ
[1:01:39] hallelujah amen yes sir praise god amen
[1:01:44] so brother sister you understand what
[1:01:46] i'm saying
[1:01:48] that even though you maybe you say oh i
[1:01:50] i did this or i made that mistake you
[1:01:53] just asked god to forgive you
[1:01:56] ask god to cleanse you from that because
[1:02:00] god is not looking at that
[1:02:03] amen
[1:02:04] what god is looking at is the image of
[1:02:07] god and the gene that's in you
[1:02:09] how that
[1:02:11] every day
[1:02:12] is being allowed
[1:02:14] to express itself
[1:02:16] because it can't express anything else
[1:02:18] but him because it's a part of him
[1:02:22] amen is a part of him and wants to
[1:02:26] express itself praise the name of the
[1:02:28] lord hallelujah praise god david you're
[1:02:32] a man after my own heart i'm gonna wrap
[1:02:35] this up now
[1:02:37] amen you see
[1:02:39] when god creates a man hallelujah
[1:02:44] he is after his kind like david
[1:02:50] thy word
[1:02:52] have i hid in my heart
[1:02:55] that i might not sin against you
[1:02:58] oh my think of it thy word have i old
[1:03:02] testament of i hid in my heart that i
[1:03:06] might not sin
[1:03:07] against you hallelujah new testament
[1:03:11] you come with the word already hid
[1:03:14] in your heart
[1:03:15] praise the lord that you might not sin
[1:03:18] against him
[1:03:20] praise the lord and the prophet says
[1:03:22] claim it's not you you didn't sin you
[1:03:26] didn't commit no sin the seed of god
[1:03:28] does not commit sin amen but the devil
[1:03:32] using what he made what not what he made
[1:03:35] he can't create but what he designed
[1:03:38] to be this way amen using and
[1:03:41] manipulating that to do all them works
[1:03:44] of the flesh amen but the man inside
[1:03:47] stands firm
[1:03:49] with the word of god immovable
[1:03:51] unshakable can't because that's the seed
[1:03:54] of god the gene of god and it cannot
[1:03:57] commit sin but you see
[1:04:00] one thing david he needed was the raid
[1:04:05] hallelujah
[1:04:07] ray he had the seed
[1:04:09] but he didn't have the
[1:04:10] rain uh oh my
[1:04:13] david would have been all right
[1:04:16] if he would have just had the rain he
[1:04:19] repeats that's repeat again
[1:04:22] but you see
[1:04:23] the holy ghost was not yet given
[1:04:26] amen
[1:04:27] so it was the seed was there and god
[1:04:30] could see that
[1:04:31] but the holy ghost was not yet given
[1:04:34] because jesus had not yet been crucified
[1:04:36] so that he could give up the ghost and
[1:04:38] the rain could come back to quicken that
[1:04:41] seed at that particular time oh my woe
[1:04:44] think of it now thy word the word was in
[1:04:49] him oh hallelujah and he could know it
[1:04:53] because he said i've hid it in my heart
[1:04:56] lord but it won't bloom
[1:04:59] it it's not acting like it should
[1:05:02] but but the word is in my heart can all
[1:05:05] of us sometime in some part of our life
[1:05:07] say the same thing
[1:05:09] you see the word you know what you know
[1:05:11] the word you know what you're supposed
[1:05:13] to do and how you're supposed to act
[1:05:16] and you hide the word within your heart
[1:05:18] but it's not glooming like it should
[1:05:20] it's not manifesting like it should
[1:05:22] hallelujah i hid it in my heart lord but
[1:05:26] it won't bloom and act like it should
[1:05:29] but lord i've hid it
[1:05:33] i have hid it
[1:05:35] amen
[1:05:36] but you see
[1:05:38] when jesus came
[1:05:40] which was the word whole word
[1:05:44] made manifest
[1:05:46] took the germ of life out of it
[1:05:49] and brings it back to the word
[1:05:53] and if david
[1:05:55] said his cup run it over
[1:05:58] amen what he's saying is
[1:06:00] david's cop run it over
[1:06:02] with the gene in him
[1:06:04] but without the spirit to water it
[1:06:07] he says here
[1:06:09] what
[1:06:10] should ours do
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:13] david's cup run it over
[1:06:16] what should ours do i want to tell you
[1:06:19] tonight as i conclude this
[1:06:22] that
[1:06:23] god wants every one of us to be
[1:06:26] conformed to the image of jesus christ
[1:06:28] as paul has said in the epistles that we
[1:06:32] would look at him and confirm to that
[1:06:36] image
[1:06:37] don't be conformed to the world but be
[1:06:39] confirmed to his image
[1:06:43] be an express image
[1:06:45] of the living god
[1:06:47] expressing himself through the word in
[1:06:50] us
[1:06:51] here upon the earth amen god bless you
[1:06:55] for this for taking the time to
[1:06:58] receive this thought here tonight out of
