Of The Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and it came to pass that as the People Press upon him to hear the word of God he stood by the lake of genes Syria and saw two sheeps standing by the lake but the fisherman were gone out of them and were washing their Nets and he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's and prayed him that you would trust out a letter from the land and he sat down and tou the people out of the ship what a blessing now when he had left speaking he said unto Simon lunch out into the deep and letay down your nets for a drought and Simon answered on Simon answering said unto him Master we have toed all the night I have taken nothing never nevertheless at Thy word I will lay down the N my topic tonight is at Thy word oh Lord and when and when they had done this and when they had this done they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break and they beon onto their Partners which were in the other other ship that they should come and help them and they came and fil both of the sheep so that they began to sink when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus knee saying depart from me for I am a sinful man and oh Lord for he was astonished and all that were with him at the drought of the fishes which they had taken and so was also James and John and the son of zeed which were partners with Simon and Jesus said unto Simon fear not for hence for thou shall catch men and when they had brought their sheeps to the land they forsook all and followed him praise the Lord you may be seated my thought tonight is ADD Thy word oh Lord at Thy word oh Lord these brothers has St all night hoping to catch something but they couldn't they couldn't feeling tired and depressed sitting down fixing their Nets you know these brothers they were not just a normal people walking on the street Jesus know them he know them and the good thing is that he took them out from their distress you know when he saw them because he saw them on the on over there and he went to them and he said he said let's get out from the land a little bit and go over the sea they didn't ask the Lord nothing but the the Lord knows their needs their troubles their trials their frustration tonight as you sitting down here the Lord knows everything about you what you are going through what is your problem what is your heart desire the Lord knows everything you don't have to ask him he knows Hallelujah they didn't ask nothing but Jesus came down and took all their burs away for just a word of the Lord my word cannot do nothing to you but God word is more than anything in your life but the word of God is in in everybody's heart these brothers they were Believers God called them as he has called you Amen Hallelujah Jesus went to help them he just went to help them Hallelujah but sometime people don't want help no matter what you do for them they are not satisfied God want to help you that the door have his way on your life we don't just come here every day every day the Lord want to help you so much more than what you want him to help you but you have to believe these brothers they believe if Peter did not believe or this brother did not

couldn't catch nothing they couldn't catch nothing how they going to go home maybe they don't have nothing home they one night to see if they can come home and get some fish or anything to bring to the market and sell it so that they can get fans to go and buy food for the table with their children and their wives and they were sitting down there walking on the sea all night they couldn't get nothing so they come down there frustration but when Jesus called them he didn't just said throw your net the Bible said he called them from the he went out from the land in a calm place a cool place for their heart to calm down and what happened he sat down with them and T them why you talk to them to settting them their heart down to build their feet that he the almighty God is with them
