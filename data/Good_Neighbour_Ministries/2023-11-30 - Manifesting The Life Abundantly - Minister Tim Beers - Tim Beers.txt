building the kingdom of God within us amen hallelujah manifest in the Life abundantly Hallelujah we got abundantly it's been poured out abundantly Upon Us amen hallelujah John 10:10 the thief cometh not but to but for to steal and to kill and destroy we know that's the devil's objective 100% but Jesus is saying here I have come that ye may have might have life and that they may have it more of abundantly Hallelujah he's warning us he's telling us out of his own mouth Jesus the enemy is going to come and try his objective his motive is to kill to steal and destroy but Jesus said I have come and that's why he had to come in this last day he couldn't let anybody else do this job that he's doing right now he said I have to come in this day and I'm going to come and I'm going to give you life and more abundantly oh my Hallelujah let's go to First John 1:1 I pray things we would say tonight and directions that we would go and angles that we would take with the Holy Ghost I can't do nothing it's the holy ghost that has to come through the fivefold ministry and speak the word of God that which was from the beginning which we have heard now listen which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have held the word of life for the life was manifested and we seen it and be bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with the son Jesus Christ and these things WR on unto you that your joy may be empty that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all let us pray father thank you for your word thank you that we can gather together together with like Precious perfect Faith tonight Lord by a profit in these last days oh Lord the perfect faith is not just lying in the tapes anymore they're lying in hearts of the predestinated seed of God tonight Lord come father we can do nothing in our own but Come Holy Spirit and speak to our hearts Lord encourage us and strengthen us and let you divide the truth rightfully divide it into our hearts give us the understanding that we have need of Father Lord put our flesh behind the cross we know this flesh will never inherit the kingdom of God Lord but we know there's a blood and we know there's a seed within us that cannot sin that is eternal Lord Lord Lord let the blood wash the flesh so that the seed the attribute can come forth and feed on your breast tonight Lord grant these things we ask in Jesus name amen you may be seated Hallelujah John's speaking here we have handled the word of life we have seen the life manifested that life is eternal life we have fellowship with that life we have in this last day seen that life that eternal life amen come into flesh we've seen a mature Son of God raise up amen God taken an attribute and awaken it by the new birth and molding it and shaping it and manifesting himself in signs wonders and miracles and displaying his life in these last days we've seen that abundance in a man we' seen that abundance in flesh amen and that was only the wave sheet that was the first fruit that come to maturity but here we are today amen God wants the rest of the Harvest amen he wants all the Harvest to come to maturity Oh Glory to God you know brothers and sisters this is him he had to come in these last days amen he had to come himself he couldn't depend on nobody else no system no religion no Ministry but he had to come himself the pure word of God and his word was fulfilled in its fullness all when those seals were open all Mysteries were loosed they were loosed now he's here to come and reveal them to you because each and every one of us until God opens our eyes we are a mystery we're even a mystery to ourselves when you were out in the world you were a mystery to yourself you knew there was something different about you you just knew it there was an atmosphere around you that you could not recognize but you could feel you couldn't understand but you knew it was different until that new birth came until that word when it was God's appointed time and season to send forth his son in your life to awaken that seed of God for you to come to recognize who you are yes we have seen the life when we're listening to those tapes and we're seeing what are we seeing are we worshiping a man are we worshiping up a personality when I listen to those tapes I hear and I see with my eyes eternal life being manifested in a man Jesus Christ man manifestation is not about attracting what you want manifestation is an awareness and an understanding that you attract what you are that's what we're attracting what we are in these last days but we have such a concept and and and a mental uh uh thing in our mind a view in our mind amen as we heard before this message will put a view preachers when they preach pastors they put a view of God an image an imprint on your mind and each and every one of us have that imprint in our minds of who God is what is the manifestation of the spirit the Greek word translate manifestation means to display to show to demonstrate to give an Evidence the Holy Spirit displays God's power through each of us as means of helping the entire church each of us the spirit is manifested in one particular way and some other useful ways other words we all called we all have a purpose we all have a a portion of faith amen we are called to fulfill in the word of God hallelujah this ain't about church this ain't about a religious feeling but we have a portion of word Allelujah that we are called to fulfill and that's what the spirit in US seeks us Amen to seek after the kingdom that's within us to look and and and seek after that word that God placed in us that's our determination that's our drive that's our goal Lord what did you place inside of me hallelujah it's a constant progress a constant seeking a pressing in an overcoming a pressing through a battle that we are constantly in in this life if you want to put it this way to find out who we really are and the prophet said when we recognize when the bride recognizes who she is she'll be Invincible hallelujah oh Jesus spoke about having life and have it more abundantly the phrase means more than you can possibly use Hallelujah glory to God do that not get you excited more than you can possibly use I want it I'm preaching here tonight but I want it I want the word that's going to come forth tonight I want it it surpasses something that goes way beyond our need our necessaries way Beyond it surpasses it you know we have a frame of mind sometimes where we think God is a god of lack oh you might not say it with your mouth but your actions your life and what you believe in your heart remember God knows your heart God knows what's in your mind he knows your thoughts and sometimes we we look at lack in our lives we look at un need needs unmet in our lives and we look to God and say Lord you said you're going to do this you said you're going to do that and we don't even realize that we are blocking the channel it's our view it's our faith it's what we believe who God is and what he is and and how much he has we we say it God is Rich my father is rich in Hells is in land he's rich and abundance of everything all spiritual things amen but in our own Hearts we deny ourselves we deny the blessings of God we deny the cross and what he purchased for us and so many different ways quit thinking about barely barely getting by in life you know like I said before when we were we we were started this series they manifest the laws of God out there better the children of this world are wiser they can take the laws of God oh you make your oh they're not born again they're not they don't got the purpose in the word they don't they're not in the Rapture but let me tell you they can still take the laws of God and bless their lives and where do you find in the world word of God that God said that you're poor you're in need you're struggling he said the enemy has come to try to kill destroy and steal your blessings he didn't say he did he said I come that you may have life and have it more abundantly that you may be filled with my spirit and filled with my blessings and all my riches come upon you he said seek the kingdom of God first and his righteousness and all things all needs all blessings will be added unto you why because he knows your heart is for the kingdom they will freely be added unto you hallelujah it's our thinking that's where we're going tonight that's where God led me it's our thinking remember every level we climb every Victory we have Satan meets us on every level until the Rapture everything will fall off and everything will be completed total Victory total Deliverance at the Rapture but we will fight every level that we go up Hallelujah therefore according to the sign that Jesus left for this world would be a sign of his resurrection would be the Everlasting sign that he gave you see that's his sign to the Bride of Jesus Christ that's his confirmation that's his seal to us is the resurrection that's where our faith lies tonight that's where we can go and ask that's where we can go and claim that's where we can go and get our victory tonight because he gave us the sign of the resurrection and he said because I live you live also because I overcome you overcome Hallelujah now God in all ages at all times has never been without a witness God always had a witness and never at any time was a witness ever receive by this world system never no age and no age that ever World system ever produced a servant of God that was used in that manner Hallelujah God always has a witness God gave us a witness as we talked about he gave us and manifested a life and that's where our eyes should be looking that's where our faith should be looking but we have an enemy that that's a a very deceiver and a master of deception brother Brandon warned the church that he would come in and Trust try to make it lukewarm lazy powerless settle you down speak into your mind stop you from going forward stop your Zeal stop your passion stop your fire when we recognize that that is our enemy that we're fighting we'll get on our knees amen and we'll pray we'll take Faith amen and pray not pray a myth but pray according to the word of God when you see the church cooling down you see the atmosphere cooling down we got to get on our knees and we got to pray because there's a spiritual attack of the enemy you you know the people out there in war they they're not just going to oh go on on the front lines and and and take it easy that would be stupid if you see them on the front lines just taking it easy being loose and lazy and LAX and everything like that right on the front lines when the enemy is staring them right in the face but you see this is what happens Satan the master of deception puts a lukewarm Spirit of this age and we are in this world but we're not of this world but this world through this flesh can be affected and that's where brother Braham says we got to sometimes Shake ourselves this is not in my notes but this is what the Lord's given me shake ourselves sometimes shake the spirit of God stir the spirit of God stir the gift in the word of God that's inside of you Stir It Up Get get anointed get speaking the word of God don't let the devil get you all doubting or or start complaining or start whispering or start pointing fingers but get the word of God stirred up inside of you where you take it to his kingdom Hallelujah we need one another we need one another amen when you see somebody hurting in the body of Jesus Christ you see the attacks my back went out brother Simon brother Chris these are attacks that are coming to the body to the ministry here to the word of God when you see these things it's not just praying for healing it's praying with an understanding a revelation that there's are taxs coming to the ministry that's what it is not coincidence not oh oh sorry you know you know you're feeling pain you're this that are we still moving in that dimension in that level of understanding in this hour that we're living in I hope not I hope not my brothers and sisters Hallelujah the thief come not but to steal and to kill and destroy I I come that you might have life and that you may have it more abundantly Jesus gives life through his word that's beginning to minister through the spirit more abundantly means to have super abundance of the thing Hallelujah don't tell me God don't want us to be blessed you can't convince me of that oh the devil and that that spirit that that Catholic Spirit of poverty and lack that that that doctrine that is being preached and that has ComEd over from denominations even to this message that you got to be poor you got to be lack you got to have nothing no God made us rich in all things listen if you're a son and daughter of God you say well brother Tim you know God's word you know that's the the mentality of people the way that they think oh God's word you know we got you know we got to suffer Catholic Spirit we got to suffer we got we got to have you know we we got to be humble listen if you're a child of God and you've been born again there's nothing there's nothing that is number one in your life but that word of God inside of you it doesn't matter what you have or what you don't have that word of God is priority it's what you seek every day Hallelujah you see you don't seek after worldly materials and riches and all that stuff you seek for the the word of God every day in your life but the but you don't have a mentality that if God wants to bless you or that that you are in that position to be blessed and that is part of your inheritance to be bless that when it's God's time and season to come in my life it can come any time it wants to come not have a mentality oh stay humble I can't have any of those stuff that's a Catholic Spirit that's a poverty Spirit that's the I come to steal your blessings off you I come to steal your wealth and your finances off of you I think we're mature enough to understand that I don't have to keep going back or the ministers don't have to keep going back and teaching you that the word of God is priority in your life it's number one you seek the kingdom of God God first in all things and then everything is going to be coming Hallelujah so every time my heart is moving and it's always moving every waking moment towards the kingdom of God and seeking every minute of the day the kingdom of God I know there's a supernatural manifestation in the other real that my faith is pulling to me that all other things are going to come into my life and bless me so I may be blessed abundantly super abundantly oh amen Abundant Life refers to life in its abounding fullness of joy and strength for the spirit soul and body it's not just for the soul it's for the soul it's for your spirit Joy Peace Love Revelation and for the body what's the body need it needs all that but it also needs clothes right and I I don't I don't know about you but if if you are uh a proper husband you don't want your wife dressed in rags amen I don't think Jesus wants us dressing in rags I don't I don't agree with with with with these people that have cars that are broken down if you're passing through and you're coming your way up okay that's fine but PE I'm talking about people's mentality in their mind that stay there and believe that that a broken down car with a sticker on the back saying Jesus loves me I'm blessed by Jesus it's the mentality of the mind living Abundant Life means Joy gratitude fulfillment living the life of abundance also involves accepting and celebrating ones individually and living in a way that reflects one true self this includes following your passion reflecting your true self who you really are not being somebody who you're not but being at Liberty and being free who the son of man sets free is free indeed in every area of your life so you can be yourself God Made You individually special and he purposed you and he wants you to be yourself and express that's who he's going to Express through he planted it in his mind that's the way he created you your personality everything in such a way that he can come into it and express himself he don't want he and he can express himself through a vessel that's not being themselves because that would go against his word you're mixing oil and water you got to keep it all oil all together in sequence and how he created you that's what God's that's what Revelation does when it comes into your life it it aligns everything about you every strength that you have every gift that you have every portion of faith that God's placed inside of you starts coming out and manifesting in his fullness that's the Abundant of life that's within us oh Hallelujah Lord help me Jesus what does God say about Liv in abundancy in abundancy scriptures say that God will provide an abundant life to those who seek the kingdom of God first and his righteousness abundance is is this sense means a life full of everything you need to sustain yourself in joy and purpose it's our view of God it's our view of the word it's always our view that will show our abundance that will manifest our abundance in our life how we view God's word Jesus speaking here we must expose the thief the thief of abundance right before Christ said these words he reminded us that the thief comes to steal kill and destroy you said brother Tim you already said that twice now unless is three times I don't know if I'm going to say it again I said I want to hammer something home God wants to hammer something home so that you can leave with something you may understand even if you understand so hold on a minute something is telling me in my mind that the devil is stealing my abundance stealing my joy stealing my my wealth stealing my inheritance stealing something from me the Ste Ste and kill and destroy Satan is a destroyer of life in all his faculties and every area family marriage Health Freedom peace Beauty strength growth wealth he is stealing one of those things from your life but we have to recognize it and command the devil to give it back to us sometimes we got to command the devil because it's the way we think the way we interpret things sometimes our view on the word of God sometimes steals the abundance of the word from us the effects of the word from us oh remember what are you talking about brother Tim remember Satan came to Eve he didn't use some other theology he used the word he took the very word and he took the word and perverted it he misspoke it misrepresented it misplaced it 99% of it didn't God say she took it in her mind think how powerful that is my brothers and sisters she took it in her mind and believed it and then she went out and act on it we look at the original sin we look at the fall of Man we look at the evils that's in the world we look at this flesh we look at death that we see every day Wars crime violence all these things is because she took the word that that the devil spoke to her and believed it that's why God is so determined Amen to speak to us the word of Truth The Word of Life and for us to stay with that word that he has given us I'm not talking about the letter the letter kth I'm talking about the revelation of the word we are not to mingle with that revelation we are not to interpret it God will be his own interpreter when he reveals it to you he will manifest it we are vessels written Epistles read of all men the life that was manifested in flesh that we seen with our eyes that same life has come back into us the Bride of Jesus Christ and it's living it life out through us like Paul said it's not I who live he said oh Wretched Man that I am he's seen the difference between his life his past life and now the life that he lives is not his life but it's the Life of Christ and how can we in ourselves interpret the Life of Christ he interprets his own life we Just Surrender our vessel we just yield Our Lives to him that's why brother BR said it made it so simple read your Bible simple and pray every day and let God let go and let God hallelujah oh when God gets a man in that place gets him in that place where he can live that's his determination in this hour Jesus said that you may have life in spite of all your weaknesses in the flesh your shortcomings your mistakes your failures oh in spite of all these things Jesus said that you might be filled with the spirit of God with his life you see you know why he's saying that you know why he can fulfill that because the seed of God cannot sin it's not imputed to the seed of God any iniquity you see where the power lies in recognizing and knowing who you are and see where the power of God lies with inside of you to express and to manifest out of your life is when you get to that place when you realize that the seed of God that's inside of you you come in contact with it Hallelujah you're speaking to it it's revealing to you every day there's a fellowship going on between you and the spirit the life of God with inside of you and when that grows to such a place of maturity you recognize that the life that you used to live the life in this flesh oh God has nothing to do there is no sin in the life that you're manifesting oh my oh Jesus Hallelujah Jesus I said I have come in this age that you may have life and more abundantly in spite of the most evil darkest Wicked deceiving age I have come and I have overcome all the powers of he of hell he said all power in Heaven and Earth is given to me I overcame hell I overcame everything that can come against you everything that the devil can throw at you Jesus said I've overcame it Hallelujah and I've given you power to tread on serpents I given you the word of God to take in your life to create an atmosphere around your life around your home around your possessions around your inheritance I've given you that power for that stop looking at this and stop looking at that looking all over the place look here it's your own home where God wants to display himself and manifest himself Hallelujah glory to God Amen you are called to overcome all issues of this life the world the pride of life the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes Jesus said be filled with the spirit of Faith so today in spite of the condition Amen in spite of the condition what is the condition the condition will never change your position the condition had a beginning it has an end and you know what there will always be a condition as long as we're still in this Dimension and in this flesh but God is is saying look at your position look at your Authority that I given you look at my word I have come that you may have life and have it more abundantly I have given you the power and the authority and I've giv you the word of God so when I speak it and I reveal it into your heart to your situation then speak it and go for it oh my manifesting Abundant Life is stopping the devil in his tracks from taking away your blessings in Joshua it shows us that we must fight for every inch of the land that God has given us it's ours he has given it us the prophet said that we will fight we will fight so that we can Reign and receive every one of these promises of God in this last day manifest in an Abundant Life by faith Hallelujah by Revelation by Believing by expecting by walking in the spirit by Overcoming By resisting the devil in all his ways that's our life that's our walk oh Hallelujah brother brand speaking here excuse me you know brother brandham he said that God gave him the message of the greatest battle ever fought to the church oh my I don't know about you but this message I've been reading it and listening to it for for the last 30 something years and it's getting more real more present it's becoming more of a substance in my life Hallelujah it helps me it helps me on every level that I go to overcome I used this this very same quotes that I'm going to be quoting here I used it when I was there and I used it when I was here I'm using it I'm here I'm going to use it all along the way just like I said Satan will meet you on every level but the word of God doesn't change you take the word the same word that you believe the same word that birthed you you take it and use it on every level of your life listen to them it must be accepted in the mind than it's believed in the heart then the word of God becomes a reality yes it becomes a reality we can stop right there has the word of God become a reality in your situation your condition right now your battle right now have you been seeking the word and Truth for God that that word becomes a reality to you now listen then it becomes a reality when it becomes a reality then every sense of soul and body is just scoured out oh yeah if there's anything that we're believing that is wrong anything that we're doubting that is there any fear that is there anything that is considered unbelief that is there when that word becomes a reality when that Revelation strikes you it scours it all out and that's what we want to experience in our walk with God God each and every time feel that scoured out that cleaning out of the Holy Spirit brother BR says sometimes we don't go deep enough we don't go far enough we just we take the word oh yeah it spoke to us but we don't take that word and let it do what it's supposed to do or you can get jabx all you want and you got stains on your clothes but you don't take that javx and you don't prepare it and put it in the in the washer with your clothes and wash it and scrub it Hallelujah you just oh I bought javex this javex is going to take that stain out this is the cure but you leave it right there and you don't you don't use it think about it then you're scoured out with the Holy Spirit then your sense of God your conscious of God everything that is Godly will flow through you that's what we want to experience be sens of God we sense his presence we sense his power we sense his word we sense his godliness hallelujah oh my there's not a doubt anywhere hello hello are we here tonight there's not a doubt anywhere nothing could rise up in a memory and say well I remember Miss Jones tried to trust God for healing one time she failed huh but if that channel has been cleared out and been purged and been filled on the inside hello that channel has been purged cleaned out and and filled on the inside there's your problem cleared out inside with the holy spirit that don't even come in memory oh God that don't come in memory anymore nothing in a memory imagine walking with God in that place I believe Enoch we're talking about Enoch's walk with God I believe Enoch got to that place Hallelujah God said he you know what Enoch you're there you're there there's nothing more you're walking in such perfect harmony with me come home oh my brothers and sisters one day we're going to be there one day soon we're going to be there Hallelujah these teachings these uh these uh Services uh all your all your uh consecration all your dedic ation all your battles all your trials all the long nights of uh sleepless nights and all your battles all your struggles are going to come to a victory one day a climax one day oh this is not in vain this is not pleasing a a church or men this is a walk with God to display that Abundant Life Hallelujah to be Witnesses now listen listen to the voice of abundance of Christ he said these words about abundance when we discuss his role as the great shepherd He says my sheep hear my voice and they follow me it's been such religious spoken spoken some these things spoken but listen to what he's saying my sheep my predestinated my own my children hear my voice they hear my voice they don't hear a strange Voice or any other voice or voice of reasoning voice of the flesh the voice of the world but they hear my voice and they follow me they follow me he says not a stranger because a stranger they will not follow the 23rd psalm gives us amazing picture or an amazing view of Christ's abundance the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want Hallelujah I will not want in any area of my my life I shall not want and that's our faith that's our confession that's what we speak I shall not want I shall not be in lack of anything I shall have everything in abundance and all you have to do what do I have to do to inherit this God has predestinated you to inherit this all you have to do is surrender your life to to him that's all but that's the hardest thing that we fight in this flesh is our desires our passion our lust for the world and the things of the world when they get in the way of you surrendering your life to his voice to his calling in your life that's where you mix water and oil together but when you have come to that place where God nothing matters Nothing Else Matters first in my life but this word and yielding my life to this word I see my flesh I see the things in my life I see my condition but I also recognize by faith my position and that's what I'm looking at oh my he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he gives me Revelation he gave me the spirit of Revelation the spirit of Truth he's given me and he guides me in every area every day of my life he guides me into all truth oh Hallelujah the devil tries to deceive My Flesh tries to deceive my own mind tries to deceive me but he guides me into all truth he makes me lie down with the revelation of green pastors amen you ever lie down in Green Pastures when the Summer Breeze is blowing Hallelujah that fresh spring Summer Breeze oh there's nothing more pure and beautiful than that so peaceful oh my Allelujah he leadth me beside Still Waters he restoreth my soul my soul is restored every day new mercies every morning that's the blessing of abundance for us every morning new Mercy he restoreth my soul oh God he Lead Me in the paths of righteousness oh yes the footsteps of the righteous are order it doesn't matter where this body wants to go this flesh or this mind the Holy Ghost is possessed in this vessel so much that he leads me in the path of righteousness n oh I might get out of line but oh that bride might get out of line amen but he puts you right back in line by the word of God hallelujah just like I had to get right back in line with the the sound here hallelujah yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death come on come on what is the greatest fear death death in this life Hallelujah though I walk through the valley of Shadow death though Satan's trying to say he's going to kill me he's going to take my life he's going to take my walk he's going to take the spirit of God out of me he's going to take the anointing away from me he's going to take the victory away from me though I walk through the valley of shadow of death I will fear no evil that Satan can bring to me no evil Hallelujah why why Saints why for thou are with me thy rod and thy staff comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies oh I'll spread a table in the middle of the Wilderness this lack out there this this inflation all that stuff has nothing to do with us only if you let it have it to do with you God said I'll provide all your needs that is guaranteed all your needs according to his riches and Glory I don't care if I need a million dollars a month to live in this world I'm going to get it because that's what I need it's just going to be I'm just going to walk with God and it's just going to come Hallelujah I just got to get the blocks amen things that are blocking out of the way that's what we got to work on work on the blocks in our mind the unbelief the fear the doubts get those blocks out of the way and open up that channel hallelujah amen let me move on here thou anointest my head with oil my cup run it over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life oh Hallelujah I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever I will dwell in his spirit I will dwell in his presence behind the shakina glory hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you know you know sometimes fear you know sometimes fear doesn't go away you just have to go forward sometimes scared and that's when you recognize that you can overcome the very thing that you fear you know you let fear paralyze you but anybody knows how to take fear and use it because you know what fear is always going to be here every one of us have fear to a certain level but the thing is does it paralyze you does it stop you from progressing forward or do you take that fear you could be scared scared to death sometimes to move forward in your life scared to death to make choices and decisions you think people didn't go through that in the Bible you don't think David wasn't scared oh no we just we just preach and like David is some super Angel when he took a look at Goliath oh he was scared but he took that fear that scare that was on him with the revelation of who he was and who God was and who the children of Israel was and he went forward and then he spoke and saysi will destroy you I will take your head off this day I will take your head off oh think about it Saints that's what we have to do sometimes don't let it paralyze you take it Go scared sometimes step out on the word of God step forward on the word of God and then you'll watch the very thing that you're scared of and as you go forward will just disappear in front of you and you'll overcome it that's the way it is that's the way it is has always been that way in my walk every time God said overcome this fight this thing oh yeah I get scared sometimes brother Brandon when you seen that woman being possessed and going like a snake underground he said the hair on his head on his back stood up he was scared but he took the word of God oh my we got the word we got our big brother not only behind us but in us hallelujah he's made us one with him take that word amen stop being scared and stop letting the devil paralyze you yeah you don't even see the power of the word that's inside of you when you speak it and go forward you don't see things manifested in your life doors opening up Red Seas opening up because you're paralyzed go scared step out and watch God open up the sea thank you Lord there was a war going on in the spirit when Jesus came when he died on the cross his death destroyed Satan remember Jesus has already overcome everything that we might face hallelujah hallelujah we must watch over our mind this is the territory that is the first place the enemy attacks we need to be constantly aware of what type of thoughts enter our mind what thoughts we accept Hallelujah you know if Eve would have took what Satan said to her back to her husband and said you know Satan said this that we shall surely not die her you know what her husband would have said which was the type of Christ Adam would have said no God said we will die and that's what he's saying here you need to know if the thoughts are demonic or Godly the Bible says bring every thought under the obedience Allelujah if the enemy can control your mind he controls your thought patterns when you agree with those thoughts you believe them which leads to actions your actions go according to what you think when you are watching the territory of your mind you won't just let any thought come there that's not of God brother Brown is speaking here greatest battle ever fought if you got your your senses see taste feel smell and hear they're all right but don't trust them unless they agree with the word don't listen to them now imagination conscious memory reason and affections they're all right if they agree with the word oh my you can preach a whole message just right there right there how Satan in infiltrates all these but if your affection doesn't agree with the word get rid of it if your reason doesn't agree with the word get rid of it just get rid of it don't keep it don't entertain it get rid of it if your imagination your conscience disagrees with that what on the inside of it of you get rid of it when God can get a man in his hands till he can get sense conscience everything cleaned out until he stands with God behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world that can poke a doubt in there not a devil he comes around and says you don't feel any better your conscience is even gone to that that's not only Health feel better spiritually mentally every emotionally your conscience has gone from that it's like a water off a duck's back you're not even paying attention you imagine you get to that place where the Devil comes and you just ignore him resist the devil ignore him and he will flee imagine you get to that place where like like Jesus he says Satan come but he had nothing to pull on me and we know that the prophet came to that place where he had the devil's number oh my my brothers and sisters that's where we got to be that's where we're going to that's why we're here tonight that he has nothing to pull on us us we just ignore him we're so much in love with the Lord hallelujah hallelujah the flu is so cleared out it shouts Hallelujah it shines out clearly certainly just as clean and clear for the word of God to work through the power of God there's your Battleground there's your Battleground is back here at the beginning the mind is the gate to the spirit your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or rejects the spirit not doesn't mean only Holy Spirit could be an unclean spirit it's a worldly Spirit a doubting Spirit a fear Spirit it doesn't matter what kind of spirit it is your mind opens up the channel it's now it's up to you it's your free more agency it's your choice now God give you the word he give you the sword he's been instructing you he's been training you all these years now he's given it to you you take it you say to this mountain you speak and go forward you take my power you take my word you take my spirit and you go forth there's nothing more greater that he wants to see for you you think a father when he built a business up or an Empire up he wants to see his son come one day into that power and then see see him stand back and see his son take that Throne take that control and that power and use it and there's nothing more glorious for the father to see that son manifest in that power amen and there's nothing glorious for the Lord when he sees what he did on the cross what he overcame in Garden Gethsemane what he purchased for us amen taking his power his authority and using it in our lives if you're at a place where it's still oh the Lord the Lord the Lord the lord I can't do nothing then your faith needs to come to this place because because these are the prophecies for the bride in the last days this is what's going to produce a body change in her Hallelujah when she puts on this word hallelujah When Faith is revealed there's a space of what we call time before there's a manifestation and in that space of time there is understanding and those two things understanding and time those things relate to us and not God you see brother brother Braham said that when God revealed to Abraham you're going to have a son he revealed Faith he gave him Faith now 25 years is a space of time and what did what what happened in that time and and understanding well time went by and it went by and it went by you know why because God don't deal with time what he spoken he said what he's spoken will happen and he confirmed it all the way down no matter what time or understanding that Abraham and Sarah had when they went with the bondswoman that's their understanding that's why the Bible says lean not to your own understanding God didn't say by the bonds wom God didn't say that he's going to uh pass down the sea through Ishmael he said through Isaac to the one son through Sarah that I promised and then here come the manifestation you see God was faithful and true to his word but why was there an ishmail and a Bond woman because of this say lean not to your own understanding this got in the way in that space my brothers and sisters when God Reveals His word there's always going to be with us time and understanding that has nothing to do with God God only sees what he's revealed God only sees what he's promised us and when we can get to a place where we get rid of time and our own understanding and only see what God has revealed to us then you're walking by faith hallelujah amen let me just pass over a few things here bite the musicians up Hallelujah Acts 1 8 and N we shall receive power when the Holy Ghost comes upon us and in us and we will be witnesses to people will witness the manifestation of the power of God through the Holy Spirit they will see the word becoming a manifestation before their very eyes again in these last days I will do a short and quick work I will do a manifestation the Lord said God is training this great great battle in Matthew 24 and Daniel 12 there will be a time of trouble such as like never before on the earth and we are living in that time right now when culture education all things has smooth over the word of God you got reasoning and so forth look what's happening he's talking right back here but we can add in so much more the days of Sodom like never before you think it was perverted back in the days of Sodom they've taken it to higher levels when brother brand said they will go beyond the camp in this day in this age Beyond Way Beyond the camp they're gone Way Beyond the camp of Sodom they gone Way Beyond the camp of any age all the ages of culminated in this age of wickedness and evilness the battle is now oh what a time my brothers and sisters that we have been chosen for such a Time think about it we have been chosen for such a time looking down through all the ages we have been placed here we look at ourselves as nothing sometimes as nobody's but you've been placed here with the word in the most wickedest age the completing of everything of all prophecies that ever been spoken we are here fulfilling it think about the ministers in this day minister in such a time you look at all the great Ministries and all the great ministers that have Come Through the Ages ministering in this time and age you standing

the armies of the Living God David said I'll go fight him we got Davidson here today I'll go fight him I'll take the word of God I'll believe the word of God I believe the word of God can defeat the enemy hallelujah amen God wants men and wom he didn't say men he says God wants men and wom this evening who can rise up and say I'll take the Lord at his word amen no matter what fails where this or that what that that don't mean anything to me that has nothing to do with me he saids you Sauls and so forth if you're afraid if you're afraid of him get back to where you belong think about it I don't want to be a Saul I want to be a David I don't want to manifest Saul being afraid of anything that comes my way hey I might be scared but I'm going to go forward and believe the word of God God no matter what fails that has nothing to do with me Hallelujah God's Great Army is moving forward amen man of valard man of Faith men of power men of understanding in all that you're getting Solomon says get understanding here get understanding tonight and every time you hear the word of God get understanding ing they don't have to be smart they don't have to be educated they just need to be channels yield it surrendered channels to God God takes those channels and he uses them and he manifests through them the abundance of Life abundance living remember anything we lack God has it in abundance we have everything we need in him our view of God's word will determine our view of abundance pray believe ask God for abundance don't settle for less my brothers and sisters soul body and

into his tent into his presence his Shina Glory I hope you just didn't walk into a building and you stayed in this building tonight but you walked into the supernatural presence of God then you're going to leave and when you walk like brother Brandon when he was walking when Abraham and Sarah were walking as they were walking that word was changing them on the inside they were becoming new their faith was being renewed oh my my brothers and sisters you might not see it with your eyes but something in your heart something in your faith is telling you that every time you receive and obey
