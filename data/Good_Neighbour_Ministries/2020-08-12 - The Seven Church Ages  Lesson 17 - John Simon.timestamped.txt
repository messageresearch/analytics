[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good evening friends
[0:16] i am happy to be here tonight
[0:19] to share with you the word of god
[0:22] we thank god for sending to us
[0:26] his bread of life may the lord bless you
[0:31] as we engage ourselves
[0:36] in another marvelous
[0:39] lesson in the seven church
[0:42] ages we shall read
[0:46] from ephesians chapter 1
[0:49] verse 1 then we will
[0:53] begin to enter into our study which will
[0:56] be entitled
[0:59] understanding the seven church ages
[1:04] understanding this seven
[1:07] church ages may god bless us all
[1:11] gracious heavenly father
[1:14] may your blessings rest upon us
[1:18] most of all may you move across the face
[1:23] of the deep
[1:25] may the great holy spirit anoint
[1:28] hearts and minds may you apply the word
[1:33] where it needs to be applied
[1:36] and change lines where they need
[1:40] to be changed most of all
[1:43] open up our understanding father
[1:47] and when this season of time is over
[1:51] may you receive all the praise the
[1:55] honor and glory for thine is the kingdom
[1:59] father
[2:00] god bless and anoint
[2:03] as we now proceed in your name amen
[2:10] ephesians 1 verse
[2:14] 1 paul
[2:17] an apostle of jesus christ
[2:21] by the will of god to the saints
[2:25] which are at ephesus
[2:29] and to the faithful in jesus christ
[2:34] verse grace be to you
[2:38] and peace from god
[2:41] our father and from
[2:44] the lord jesus christ
[2:47] amen now so
[2:51] we want to come to a place
[2:55] of a clear understanding
[2:59] of these seven church ages
[3:04] now to fully understand the message of
[3:07] god to these ages
[3:10] we must first of all understand certain
[3:13] principles
[3:15] that god gives to us
[3:18] and we must also uh
[3:21] arrive uh to a place where we can
[3:24] recognize the names of the messengers
[3:29] okay so that's important we must
[3:32] also be able to understand
[3:35] the lengths of the age
[3:39] or ages and discuss
[3:43] other factors that may
[3:46] uh overlap along with these
[3:50] ages now we know this is a serious study
[3:56] this is a serious uh
[4:00] study in which we ought to approach it
[4:03] reverently and not because we may be
[4:07] in our homes and relaxed in our
[4:10] domiciles
[4:12] that we ought to take the word for
[4:14] granted
[4:15] but the word of god is sincere
[4:19] and we ought to accept it soberly
[4:23] with our minds and hearts receive the
[4:27] word of god
[4:28] and be blessed by the word of god
[4:32] hallelujah now to understand
[4:35] uh or to come to the understanding of
[4:38] these seven church ages
[4:40] we must clearly uh
[4:44] be in a uh an atmosphere
[4:47] of prayer we must
[4:50] allow ourselves to be in this
[4:54] atmosphere of prayer
[4:57] prayer for what asking god to grant you
[5:01] his wisdom his understanding
[5:04] and that he as he has promised that if
[5:08] we
[5:08] any man lacks understanding lacks wisdom
[5:12] and let him ask of god who giveth
[5:16] liberally god will give you liberally
[5:20] ever-present water from the rock
[5:24] and you will thirst no more
[5:27] but you will want to follow that
[5:30] rock revelation on
[5:33] foundational truths of the word of god
[5:36] wherever the word of god and the spirit
[5:40] of god
[5:42] leads you amen
[5:45] the next thing we must do
[5:48] is to study the word
[5:52] as i've often said to you read your
[5:55] bible
[5:55] even if it's five minutes a day read
[5:59] your bible read your bible pray
[6:02] every day pray every day pray
[6:06] every day read your bible
[6:09] pray every day if you follow
[6:12] me if you want to follow the lord jesus
[6:16] christ
[6:17] read your bible and pray
[6:20] every day also
[6:24] take time if you can find
[6:28] anywhere a book on a church histories
[6:32] then read from it study it go to the
[6:36] library
[6:36] find it go to the some christian
[6:40] bookstore and you'll be able to find uh
[6:43] something like that on christian history
[6:47] or you can check out the encyclopedia
[6:49] britannica
[6:50] or other sources where you may be
[6:53] able to uh confirm
[6:56] that the things i am saying to you
[7:00] are through and they are
[7:03] true not only by the
[7:06] rebel quoting of the scripture and of
[7:09] the word of god
[7:10] but they are also true in
[7:13] normal human history
[7:17] compiled by men of course to show
[7:20] the journey of the human race and
[7:24] in there you will find also
[7:27] some wonderful gems and jewels
[7:30] of their understanding so
[7:34] you must study some history
[7:37] also it will be helpful to you uh
[7:40] don't just uh confine yourself in
[7:43] oh i'm just going to read my bible i
[7:45] don't want to read any other book i
[7:47] don't want to know anything else
[7:49] no you you need to expand
[7:52] because if you read paul you'll hear
[7:55] paul said
[7:55] well did the christians poets
[7:58] say and he'll quote them or
[8:02] well did the greeks say and he'll
[8:05] quote them it means a solomon said a
[8:08] wise man
[8:10] a wise man gets himself involved with
[8:13] all manner of knowledge so that out of
[8:16] his treasures new and old
[8:18] he may bring forth the truths and lights
[8:21] of
[8:22] god for the glory of god amen
[8:25] so you should study some history and
[8:29] also you should understand
[8:32] certain fundamental principles
[8:35] that are within the word of god
[8:40] and i'm going to deal there but there
[8:43] are four
[8:44] uh main principles in studying these
[8:48] seven church ages
[8:51] that i would like for you to pay
[8:53] particular attention to
[8:56] for tonight i will deal
[8:59] or attempt to deal with two of those
[9:03] principles the first one being principle
[9:06] one
[9:08] is that our god is unchanging
[9:12] i believe it my god that i serve
[9:16] is unchanging and that
[9:19] is a key principle
[9:22] or actually one or the keystone
[9:27] to understanding not only the seven
[9:29] chord changes
[9:30] it will help you to understand the seven
[9:32] messengers
[9:34] it will help you to understand the
[9:36] entire
[9:37] bible if you can uh
[9:40] grasp this truth not just
[9:43] i'm saying it you are hearing it
[9:46] it's english your natural mind
[9:49] understand that when i say
[9:51] god is unchanging but i'm saying
[9:54] ask god by his spirit to give you
[9:57] a deeper understanding and a revelation
[10:01] that you may fully grasp and come to a
[10:05] spiritual realization
[10:08] of what it means to
[10:11] say and believe and understand
[10:15] that our god is unchanging
[10:20] this is a keystone truth and principle
[10:24] of the bible now why use the word
[10:27] keystone
[10:28] now you'll say well brother simon what
[10:30] is
[10:31] a keystone now i've been to rome several
[10:34] times and while in rome
[10:36] i i visit some of those ancient
[10:39] arches beautiful built
[10:42] by the romans and what beautiful
[10:46] a work of construction to this day
[10:50] the children their children are masters
[10:53] of storm work and
[10:54] tile work and things of that nature
[10:57] gifted
[10:58] but a keystone my friends
[11:01] on those bridges across the rivers
[11:05] they're they're they're built like a
[11:08] arch
[11:10] and in the middle of that
[11:13] if you were to now take note and go look
[11:16] you'll see that there
[11:17] is a stone that has a pyramid
[11:21] shape it starts like that comes down
[11:26] and of course across and
[11:30] the bricks lay beside it and it's the
[11:33] keystone
[11:34] that holds all the other
[11:37] bricks in their places
[11:41] so what is this truth telling us
[11:44] that this one truth is
[11:47] the keystone of the bible that our
[11:50] god never changes
[11:54] and by this truth all the other things
[11:57] hold together and consist
[12:00] as one and you will find if you if you
[12:04] see this truth and hold to this truth
[12:07] you'll see a consistency of truth
[12:10] of revelation inspiration that
[12:14] goes through the entire bible
[12:17] like a river of life whose trains may
[12:20] glad the city of god
[12:22] yes sirs here it is our god is
[12:26] unchanging and that is indeed the
[12:29] revelation
[12:30] of hebrews 13 8 jesus
[12:34] christ the same yesterday
[12:38] today and forever
[12:42] he is unchanging in his ways
[12:47] and this scripture tells us he is on
[12:50] unchanging in his person on changing in
[12:54] his ways
[12:55] and on changing in his person
[12:58] now if we read from ecclesiastes
[13:01] chapter 3 verses 14 14-15
[13:07] i know that whatsoever
[13:11] god do it it shall
[13:14] be forever
[13:18] nothing can be put to it
[13:22] nor anything taken
[13:25] from it and god do it
[13:28] it and men should
[13:32] fear before him now just place in your
[13:35] mind
[13:36] along with that revelation chapter 19
[13:38] and 20
[13:39] where the bible says you should not add
[13:41] to this book you shall not take away
[13:44] hearing ecclesiastes you are seeing the
[13:46] same truth here
[13:48] that whatsoever god do it is forever
[13:51] nothing can be put
[13:53] to it and nothing
[13:56] can be taken away from it
[13:59] for god do it men should fear
[14:02] before him that which had been
[14:06] is now and that which is to be
[14:10] had already been and
[14:13] god required that which
[14:17] is past so god we are unhappy i'm
[14:20] serving an unchanging god
[14:23] who has unchanging rays
[14:26] hallelujah glory to god i'm happy that
[14:29] heaven and earth will pass away
[14:32] but as the bible says my words shall
[14:35] never ever pass away on changing god
[14:39] unchanging ways unchanging word
[14:43] we realize that god's word will never
[14:46] change and if god ever
[14:50] does anything one time then
[14:53] god my friends the first time it will
[14:57] have to keep
[14:58] doing the same thing over and over
[15:01] again that is why history has cycles now
[15:04] he has to do that
[15:06] over and over again because he is
[15:08] perfection of perfection of perfection
[15:11] and his first decision or his first
[15:14] act is a perfect act that cannot
[15:18] be improved upon yes sir and that's the
[15:21] kind of god
[15:22] that we are serving so let's apply
[15:26] this truth to the church ages finding
[15:29] that
[15:30] what god did in the very first church
[15:33] age
[15:34] he cannot change from that that
[15:37] has to be what he has to repeat
[15:41] down through the other ages
[15:44] what he did so he has to repeat
[15:47] doing it so praise god so it's in your
[15:50] bible
[15:51] it's in the book of acts thank god
[15:55] the holy spirit allowed it to be
[15:58] recorded
[15:59] in the book of acts there that how
[16:02] the first original church was founded
[16:06] and how god manifested himself
[16:09] through that church remember god's
[16:12] principles of his word
[16:14] are unchanging and we see in the book of
[16:17] acts how the first church was founded
[16:20] we see how god was manifesting
[16:24] himself through that church
[16:27] and the word of god cannot change
[16:31] or be changed for it is the word
[16:35] of god no man no institution
[16:39] none can come along and
[16:42] improve upon or ordain
[16:45] or suggest that they will improve
[16:48] upon the word of god
[16:52] that is not what i read in my bible for
[16:55] you shall not add you shall
[16:57] not take away from the word of god for
[17:00] the word of god
[17:02] is unchanging for it says in john
[17:05] chapter 1
[17:07] in the beginning was the word
[17:10] and the word was with
[17:14] god and the word was god
[17:18] and god amen is unchanging
[17:23] hallelujah and the moment we change
[17:26] one word of god just like eve did
[17:30] in the garden then we bring
[17:33] sin death trial tribulation upon
[17:36] our lives so the word of god
[17:40] is to be uh what he has left it at
[17:43] and not to be meddled and mingled
[17:46] manhandled
[17:47] uh by any geological wisdom or
[17:50] knowledge of man any presumptions
[17:54] of man any assumptions
[17:57] by man none of that we are to
[18:00] leave the word of god alone for god
[18:04] is his own interpreter and
[18:07] he will make it plain for
[18:10] he will make it known to you and any
[18:14] other what it is time for you to know
[18:17] when it is time for you to understand
[18:20] when it is time for you to catch the
[18:23] revelation
[18:24] then in the fullness god sends forth his
[18:27] son
[18:28] the light of god upon your heart your
[18:31] mind
[18:31] and upon your life amen hallelujah
[18:35] now we then understand through this
[18:37] principle
[18:39] that the church that god birthed
[18:43] at pentecost acts chapter 2
[18:47] amen the entire book of acts my friends
[18:51] is the pattern it's the original pattern
[18:55] and it is the pattern that we can not
[18:58] should not and must not change
[19:02] for we must not uh my friends
[19:05] mess around with god's word we can't
[19:07] deform the word of god
[19:10] yes sir we need to leave god's word
[19:13] as it is god has a wisdom in the way he
[19:16] has placed
[19:17] every single word conjunction
[19:21] everything within the bible
[19:24] and no matter what
[19:28] scholars may tell you that
[19:31] is the pattern and we are not to change
[19:35] god's pattern for what god did at
[19:38] pentecost
[19:39] he has to keep on doing until the church
[19:43] ages
[19:44] are over now scholars may tell you well
[19:48] we know the days of the apostles as
[19:52] glorious as the days of the apostles
[19:54] were it's now history
[19:57] it's now uh it's now epistles it's not
[20:01] beautiful
[20:02] literature it's good for us to study and
[20:05] develop
[20:06] a clerical uh uh you know a profession
[20:10] uh of clergy through this matter
[20:13] for it's now the days of the apostles
[20:16] are
[20:17] over oh friends i beg to
[20:20] differ because that is wrong
[20:23] particularly
[20:24] on two counts first of all it's wrong to
[20:27] suppose
[20:28] that there aren't any more apostles
[20:32] for the one apostle the word apostle
[20:35] means
[20:35] set one one that is sent
[20:39] and that will be equivalent to us in our
[20:42] day using the word
[20:44] a missionary that's what paul was
[20:47] now we use the word lightly sent i'm not
[20:50] going to go into that
[20:52] it doesn't just mean anyone that is sent
[20:55] out from a church makes
[20:56] that person an apostle but once sent
[20:59] by the hand of almighty god is a genuine
[21:03] god santa person not a church sent one
[21:07] not a not a mother that sends out her
[21:10] son
[21:10] but god our heavenly father that anoints
[21:14] that empowers and sends forth his
[21:17] son when paul said that what
[21:20] the lord showed to me first corinthians
[21:24] chapter 11
[21:25] as it was revealed to me by the lord
[21:29] jesus
[21:30] that on the same night he was betrayed
[21:34] amen and then he tells all that was said
[21:37] in that room when they had the last
[21:40] supper
[21:41] not being there he wasn't told that by
[21:44] peter by paul
[21:45] by any of james or any of the other
[21:48] apostles of that day but he said
[21:50] revealed to me by the lord jesus
[21:53] himself it's not that he had a different
[21:55] revelation
[21:56] but god gave him a little more
[21:59] understanding
[22:00] on the original word so that he could
[22:03] put it
[22:03] forth so that they said well brother
[22:07] brother uh peter uh brother paul you're
[22:10] saying some things that uh uh you know
[22:12] it's it's it's so
[22:14] deep that even i can hardly understand
[22:17] but god has given each one of us a
[22:19] different kind of ministry
[22:21] he gives us a different kind of of as
[22:24] much as we have different personalities
[22:27] he gives us a different kind of ministry
[22:30] and so here it is
[22:32] that pattern cannot be changed and there
[22:35] are still apostles here upon earth do
[22:38] you believe that
[22:41] do you believe god still has apostles i
[22:43] believe it
[22:44] god sent once anointed
[22:48] men by the holy spirit that
[22:51] need no recognition that
[22:54] need no recommendation but because they
[22:58] have the
[22:59] vindication of the god of heaven
[23:02] o praises holy blessed name
[23:05] may his name be praised and lifted up
[23:08] forever
[23:09] oh praise god hallelujah amen
[23:12] yes sir my friends the bible tells us
[23:16] that as long as god is calling
[23:20] men to ministry uh calling
[23:23] men and sending men by the holy spirit
[23:26] then the days of the apostles or the
[23:30] apostolic age
[23:32] is not over it's the age of manifested
[23:37] holy ghost
[23:37] power is not over
[23:41] praise god acts chapter 2 verse 38
[23:45] to 39 then peter said
[23:48] unto them repent and be
[23:52] baptized every one of you in the name of
[23:56] jesus christ
[23:57] for the remission of your sins
[24:01] and you shall receive the gift
[24:04] of the holy ghost for the promise
[24:08] is unto you those that were right in
[24:11] front of him
[24:12] and to your children and to
[24:16] all that are far off
[24:20] as many as the lord
[24:24] our god shall call
[24:27] as many is god still calling
[24:30] as long as god is still calling
[24:33] this promise is unto you
[24:36] and the age of the apostolic
[24:39] age is not over and
[24:42] can not cease until we are called
[24:46] out of here it will not end it will
[24:49] not cease until god stops calling
[24:53] the pentecostal message
[24:56] vindicated by pentecostal power
[25:00] shall never cease and i'm not talking
[25:03] about
[25:03] the modern day pentecost i'm talking
[25:06] about
[25:06] the holy ghost bible pentecost
[25:09] the original pentecost restored
[25:13] back by the power and presence of god
[25:16] upon his sons and his daughters his
[25:19] chosen
[25:20] ones his hidden ones his elected ones
[25:23] his little flock
[25:24] his bright class of saints his church of
[25:27] the living god
[25:28] the assembly of the firstborn all
[25:31] blessed be the name of the lord
[25:34] they're here they're on the earth
[25:36] they're everywhere there
[25:38] they're within various churches and
[25:40] groups and god
[25:42] is calling from in the book of
[25:44] revelation come
[25:45] out of her my people if god wanted you
[25:48] in there he'll leave you
[25:50] there but the bible gives the command
[25:52] come out from a monster my people
[25:55] and be not partakers of our plagues or
[25:59] judgments that i'm going to send upon or
[26:02] because of our
[26:03] errors and because of our misleading
[26:06] statements and actions than examples
[26:09] that she is given for so come out from
[26:12] whatever you are in
[26:13] and come into the perfect law
[26:16] of liberty of the word of god
[26:20] given to us by our lord jesus christ
[26:23] now we know that whatever the church had
[26:28] at pentecost is her inalienable right
[26:32] and it is our divine right
[26:36] to have the same thing they had
[26:39] on the day of pentecost hallelujah
[26:43] brothers and sisters that trailed my
[26:45] soul when
[26:47] as a teenager that i
[26:50] uh i heard the scripture read out of
[26:53] acts chapter 2
[26:55] and spoke to this wonderful
[26:58] man of god i knew at that time of my
[27:02] boyhood and said do you mean
[27:05] that what i'm reading here right now
[27:08] in this bible this is what is supposed
[27:12] to happen to us
[27:13] in our day and that gentleman said
[27:17] yes i said so do you realize that
[27:20] do you mean that if i were to raise my
[27:23] hands up now
[27:24] and begin to praise and thank god
[27:28] by faith for accepting his word
[27:31] his promise of the holy spirit
[27:34] in my life that god will give me
[27:38] exactly the same thing and uh
[27:42] i i said how am i supposed to do it like
[27:45] this
[27:45] and the moment i raise my hands the holy
[27:48] spirit of almighty god
[27:51] trapped upon me and for about
[27:54] 15 to 20 minutes i
[27:57] was speaking and speaking speaking
[28:01] praise god hallelujah and
[28:04] when i came to full
[28:08] uh fullness of consciousness
[28:11] i could hear myself i wasn't unconscious
[28:14] i could hear myself speaking
[28:17] ah but when i became fully aware
[28:21] then immediately the old minister said
[28:24] oh my god
[28:26] there is no doubt of what
[28:30] you have to do and what god called you
[28:33] for
[28:34] brother sister the days of the apostles
[28:37] are not over the apostolic age
[28:40] is not over and by saying these things
[28:43] i'm not
[28:44] identifying or trying to imply that i am
[28:47] one of those
[28:48] apostles do i may be but that's for god
[28:51] to
[28:52] make clear i want you to understand god
[28:55] has
[28:56] promised these things in his word and
[28:58] our unchanging god
[29:00] must bring these things to pass if we
[29:04] consciously earnestly believe his word
[29:08] this is not movie making some mythical
[29:11] thing
[29:12] that's written in this bible it's not
[29:14] just a
[29:15] fantasy but it is faith in the word of
[29:18] god
[29:19] that and the right mental attitude that
[29:22] brings it all to past hallelujah glory
[29:27] to god
[29:28] hallelujah so we know that this age
[29:31] of manifested holy ghost power
[29:33] manifesting through the saints
[29:36] through the true church of the living
[29:38] god
[29:39] is not over but it's here with us now
[29:43] would you claim your part of it and say
[29:45] oh
[29:46] lord send the power just now oh
[29:49] lord send the power just now
[29:53] oh lord send the power just now
[29:56] and baptize everyone
[30:00] wherever you are receive ye the holy
[30:03] ghost
[30:04] may the spirit of almighty god fill you
[30:07] anoint you and use you for his glory and
[30:10] honor
[30:11] in the days and years to come amen
[30:15] blessed be his holy name
[30:17] amen glory to god listen my brothers and
[30:19] sisters
[30:21] what that church had was their right
[30:25] and it is our right today
[30:29] for the apostolic age
[30:32] is not over now originally when
[30:36] the church started you will agree with
[30:38] me
[30:39] the church had the pure word straight
[30:42] from the mouth of the lord jesus
[30:44] straight to the lips and hearts of those
[30:47] apostles
[30:48] so the church had the pure word
[30:52] also she had the power of the holy
[30:55] spirit
[30:56] manifesting through her with
[31:00] diverse signs and wonders being
[31:03] manifested
[31:04] among the saints of god she also had
[31:09] diversities of gifts of the holy spirit
[31:13] that was so proliferated amongst them
[31:16] it was everywhere the deacons had it
[31:20] the ministers had it the the the
[31:23] apostles had it
[31:25] you had uh women in the church
[31:28] phillips daughters had it they
[31:30] prophesied
[31:31] there were others that were anointed by
[31:33] the power of the holy spirit
[31:35] because it was the expected saying
[31:38] it was not something that was
[31:41] extraordinary
[31:42] until they went about calling themselves
[31:46] uh apostle apostle so and so or
[31:49] or they went around with some spiritual
[31:51] pride
[31:52] saying oh dear consume so
[31:55] or a prophetess so-and-so
[31:59] no it wasn't a matter of human
[32:02] pride and uh and naming and claiming
[32:06] and and calling one another by these
[32:08] names they
[32:09] simply recognize the offices
[32:13] the gifts and powers that were working
[32:17] through
[32:18] the individual and they needed no
[32:21] other badge of identification
[32:25] other than god as with abel
[32:29] god bearing witness
[32:32] testimony of the here
[32:35] their gifts and of his presence within
[32:39] their lives
[32:40] they don't need any other man or woman
[32:42] certification ordination
[32:44] of any that nature that sort of thing is
[32:47] just to operate here upon
[32:49] this earth that we are in but the real
[32:52] ordination the real holy spirit
[32:55] is the come father the bible and anoint
[32:59] his beloved and use them for his glory
[33:03] and for his honor hallelujah amen
[33:06] oh praise god hallelujah amen
[33:10] now we also know not only that she had
[33:12] the
[33:13] perfect pure word of god the power and
[33:16] presence of almighty god
[33:17] signs and wonders miracles manifesting
[33:22] amongst her just spontaneous combustion
[33:26] of the purifier's presence and the
[33:29] power of god breaking out at any time
[33:32] oh blessed be his holy name it could be
[33:36] that we're in the quiet lesson things it
[33:38] will be that we're in a meditation
[33:40] and all of a sudden the holy spirit
[33:43] could break forth
[33:44] that's the original way it was we don't
[33:47] need to work ourselves up like bales
[33:50] uh bails prophets into a an emotional
[33:54] frenzy
[33:54] so it will put you into an
[33:57] emotional experience but we don't have
[34:00] to work ourselves
[34:01] up into that and drum it down and
[34:04] music and upper or beated up or beated
[34:08] down but
[34:09] rest in the grace of god and have faith
[34:12] in the promise of god
[34:13] that he will fulfill his word for
[34:17] god himself is unchanging and his words
[34:21] must come to pass glory to god
[34:23] hallelujah
[34:24] and so the church the original church
[34:28] will always be the pattern
[34:31] every seed after its kind like
[34:35] will beget like so the original church
[34:40] will be what the true church will try to
[34:43] measure itself against no other group no
[34:46] other church no other institution
[34:49] denomination
[34:50] or independent so-called group that man
[34:54] may bring up but measure yourself by the
[34:58] plumb line
[34:59] and the standards and principles of the
[35:02] word of god
[35:03] and see where you stand
[35:06] according to the word of god now
[35:10] this true church will always be the one
[35:12] that will follow in the footsteps
[35:14] of the founders the first messenger paul
[35:18] and the others that were there at the
[35:21] time
[35:22] it's it's just so simple and wonderful
[35:24] that we just follow
[35:26] the messenger for that first age what
[35:29] god
[35:29] used him and by the way
[35:33] men and women are not ashamed to quote
[35:35] from the epistles of paul and said well
[35:37] did paul say so and so
[35:39] but if i were to stand here and say
[35:43] brother branham said so so they'll say
[35:46] oh
[35:46] that that we don't have to pay attention
[35:49] to that well
[35:50] you don't understand the days of the
[35:53] apostles and the prophets are not over
[35:55] but i'm talking not about this the devil
[35:58] has thrown out so many counterfeits
[36:01] until the people have lost sight
[36:03] of who and what is a true prophet
[36:06] they lost sight of what and who is a
[36:09] genuine
[36:10] god-sent apostle a god sent man of god a
[36:14] godsend
[36:15] pastor teacher evangelist the
[36:18] lost sight of it has now become just a
[36:21] matter of
[36:22] of a modern day marketing and everything
[36:25] else
[36:26] oh god help us and they are
[36:29] in which we are living so we must
[36:32] judge ourselves according
[36:35] to the original true church
[36:38] of the living god because what she was
[36:41] at pentecost and what she was
[36:45] in the apostolic age that is set forth
[36:49] in this word of god in the book of acts
[36:52] we must apply the same rules
[36:56] and then we will see where she
[36:59] was blessed and use of god and we will
[37:02] also be able to understand the pitfalls
[37:06] and the errors and where even
[37:10] that church failed after they began to
[37:14] drift away
[37:15] from the original truths until even paul
[37:19] before he left the scene began to say
[37:22] i'm afraid that um there are
[37:26] uh grievous wolves brethren
[37:30] man and crept in unawares
[37:34] there was a already an invention of
[37:37] error
[37:38] that was taking place at that time now
[37:41] if that was in the planting season of
[37:43] the church what about the harvest time
[37:45] of the church
[37:46] the ripening season of the church whoa
[37:50] when truth and era are in array when the
[37:53] supernatural
[37:54] war is still going on when the greatest
[37:57] battle ever
[37:58] fought from from eternity back to
[38:01] eternity
[38:02] being fought and raging in this hour oh
[38:05] glory to god my brother sister don't you
[38:08] see
[38:09] we must follow god's pattern
[38:12] clearly in his word because
[38:16] the errors that took place there
[38:20] and started just as a little bug
[38:23] my friends is growing so great on
[38:27] and great upon earth until
[38:31] we are facing or we are prophesying
[38:34] and we are experiencing a spiritual
[38:38] blackout of the truth on
[38:42] revelation in the word
[38:45] of the living god oh glory to god i
[38:48] thank god for this first key principle
[38:51] what our god is unchanging
[38:55] now we know that the true church will
[38:57] always
[38:58] try to be like this one that was in
[39:01] the book of acts hallelujah
[39:04] we also discovered that the word teaches
[39:07] us as i've just said that there
[39:10] was there and there ears
[39:14] and through the ages there has been
[39:17] a an invasion
[39:20] of error
[39:24] a satanic invasion
[39:27] of enticing spirits versus the word of
[39:31] god
[39:32] seed deucing spirits to draw
[39:35] and charm your mind away
[39:39] from the genuine word of god and to make
[39:42] these sweet sounding
[39:45] talks and bible teachers and
[39:49] things of that nature sound so uh
[39:52] organized orderly symmetrical
[39:56] beautiful words like cain's
[39:59] altar that it could just slip into your
[40:02] heart and in your mind
[40:03] and you accept that as truth not the
[40:06] rough and ready word of god
[40:10] primitive christianity with brimstone
[40:13] and
[40:13] fire and of stretch oh my god
[40:16] rifle barrel strength gospel from the
[40:20] word of god
[40:21] hallelujah don't you realize that
[40:24] when abel killed his lamb in the bible
[40:28] and offered it up
[40:29] it was not a sharp knife that he had
[40:33] he had a rough rock whether he
[40:36] banged that animal on the neck until the
[40:39] neck came off
[40:40] but he used a rough human
[40:43] knife made out of a rock and so it
[40:46] appears when a genuine
[40:48] man of god picks up the word of god and
[40:51] begins to use it
[40:53] it appears sometimes rough crude
[40:56] untrained not properly
[41:00] put together symmetrical it doesn't seem
[41:04] progressive it doesn't seem palatable
[41:07] not to our taste not dignified enough
[41:11] that's my friends back to the bible back
[41:14] to the original word of god
[41:16] what you went out in the wilderness to
[41:19] see not what you went into the cathedral
[41:21] what did you go into the wilderness to
[41:24] see a prophet i'm more than a prophet
[41:26] you didn't go there to see one dressed
[41:29] up with fine
[41:30] robes like in a crane palace but men
[41:33] coming out with
[41:34] gold skin sheepskin camel skins on
[41:38] oh go praise god not that i don't mean
[41:41] to
[41:42] do that today because we will dress
[41:45] for the day in which we live but my
[41:48] friends it will be
[41:49] simple ordinary men anointed by the holy
[41:53] spirit
[41:54] don't be afraid brothers don't be afraid
[41:57] saints of god
[41:58] you heed the word of god and obey the
[42:01] promised word of the hour
[42:03] and do what god tells you to do not to
[42:05] be a rebel
[42:07] but be one that follows the word of god
[42:10] and that will cause you to
[42:14] fellowship with those of like
[42:18] precious faith that is clear
[42:21] within the word of god hallelujah
[42:24] oh friends we are facing this clear
[42:26] blackout of truth
[42:29] in this last day just before jesus
[42:32] appears
[42:33] first time he was about to come upon the
[42:36] earth
[42:37] in the form of a baby the bible said the
[42:40] people that sat in darkness saw great
[42:43] light
[42:44] and a great light has sprung up
[42:48] oh praise god hallelujah all my friends
[42:52] i believe the same thing has happened in
[42:54] our day that a great
[42:55] light has sprung up here upon the earth
[42:59] lord of god but in the midst of this
[43:01] darkness
[43:03] does god forsake his own does he forget
[43:06] his
[43:07] people in a time like this for them to
[43:10] fall
[43:10] into a state of deception the answer is
[43:13] clear
[43:15] matthew chapter 24 jesus said
[43:19] for they shall arise false christs
[43:22] false prophets and shall show great
[43:25] signs
[43:26] and wonders and this
[43:29] and if it were possible they shall
[43:31] deceive
[43:32] the very elect in other words the elect
[43:36] cannot be deceived
[43:38] and i want to thank god for that my
[43:41] friends
[43:42] that the elect cannot be deceived
[43:46] and i'm glad that in the midst of all of
[43:49] this darkness
[43:50] hallelujah i'm sure you might have heard
[43:53] this
[43:54] story of the boy and his sister
[43:58] that were in an elevator and as it was
[44:02] going down it
[44:05] it suddenly stopped and it has happened
[44:08] in the most modern buildings
[44:11] and the lights went out and it was dark
[44:14] and uh you know she began to his sister
[44:18] began to scream
[44:20] she began to scream uh she was so
[44:23] fearful of the dark oh my
[44:26] my my but in those days
[44:30] back then they also had to have
[44:33] an elevator operator and there was a
[44:37] switch that he could turn on
[44:39] and he could turn those lights on so the
[44:42] young boy
[44:43] turned to his sister and oh say oh
[44:46] don't fear little sister don't fear
[44:49] little sister
[44:50] oh oh there is a man here
[44:53] that can turn on the light oh little

[45:00] say to you as i am
