[39:03] Saints thank you so much wonderful
[39:05] worship this morning I walk into this
[39:07] wonderful atmosphere of Liberty knowing
[39:11] that the spirit of the Lord is
[39:13] interested in us
[39:14] he wants to fellowship with us this
[39:16] morning
[39:17] he loves and adores each and every one
[39:19] of you I want you to know that amen
[39:22] because his his mercy and his love
[39:24] endureth forever and ever and ever once
[39:28] you've come to a realization that you
[39:30] are an attribute of God that you are not
[39:33] somebody that started on this Earth so
[39:35] many years ago Gabe you might have
[39:37] started 65 years ago I started 61 or two
[39:41] years ago can't remember right now but
[39:43] you know everybody knows when they
[39:46] started here on this earth right they've
[39:48] got a birth date I want you to know that
[39:51] you started much earlier than that
[39:54] that you had actually no beginning and
[39:56] you will have no end because you're an
[39:59] attribute you're going through an
[40:00] Earthly experience you're experiencing
[40:03] this Dimension and you know sometimes it
[40:06] gets really rough
[40:08] it just gets really rough amen but then
[40:11] then you come into this then you come
[40:13] into a realization of who you really are
[40:16] then you come into the house of the Lord
[40:18] and this morning we're just excited
[40:21] about being in the house of the Lord we
[40:24] have a word from the Lord amen that's
[40:27] why we come into the house of the Lord
[40:29] as a minister of God we know that we've
[40:33] been you know by God's grace God calls
[40:35] us right we didn't choose our calling
[40:38] God chooses Our Calling he says I'm the
[40:42] author I'm the finisher so we believe in
[40:45] that calling we believe in the power of
[40:47] God to move through the body of Jesus
[40:50] Christ we believe in the Supernatural
[40:52] listen if it wasn't for the supernatural
[40:55] you wouldn't even be here
[40:56] look at just look around you look around
[40:58] you you see you see from the east from
[41:01] the west from the north from the south
[41:02] you see people from all different parts
[41:05] of the planet assembled Here For What
[41:08] for what what what what is it that's
[41:10] drawing your attention here this morning
[41:13] this is the Living God
[41:15] it's the presence of the Living God
[41:17] it's healing in your lives
[41:20] it's Deliverance in your life we're
[41:22] going to be looking at a lot of things
[41:23] this morning as we go to the word
[41:26] uh we certainly want to remember our
[41:28] pastor amen he's uh in Montreal I
[41:31] believe he's going to be ministering
[41:32] this morning at a church in Montreal so
[41:35] uh you know we've been praying for him
[41:37] I'm sure you've all been praying but
[41:39] let's just pray that the Lord will be a
[41:41] great blessing wherever he is and let
[41:44] the word go forth and bless them the way
[41:46] that we've been getting blessed amen
[41:48] praise God it's just it's just an
[41:50] anointing on a servant of God in this
[41:54] day and in this hour somebody that's
[41:56] caught the current stage of the ministry
[41:59] of Jesus Christ and our pastor has been
[42:01] a leader in that way he's always
[42:04] received that divine inspiration from
[42:07] the Lord and we've been the
[42:08] beneficiaries of that in that we've you
[42:11] know by God's grace we just receive it
[42:13] fresh all the time amen I'm expecting
[42:16] fresh this morning glory to God we're
[42:19] going to read a lot of scriptures that
[42:21] we've all read and you know maybe read
[42:23] many times over and over and you've
[42:24] heard but the Holy Spirit it is a living
[42:27] God
[42:28] amen praise God I've been so blessed by
[42:31] the word of God that's been coming forth
[42:33] yes I've been away physically but I have
[42:36] not been away spiritually
[42:38] you could never ever get rid of me
[42:44] I'm in the body of Christ
[42:46] there's just no way the devil tries to
[42:48] get rid of me every single day
[42:50] he can't do it so you ain't got a chance
[42:54] praise God but I appreciate the word of
[42:57] God that's been coming forth from these
[42:58] brothers you know we've been so blessed
[43:01] brother Christopher you know it brought
[43:03] a wonderful message God has the answer
[43:05] let me tell you he has it before you
[43:07] even ask praise God and and that was a
[43:10] real blessing Amen brother Tim you know
[43:13] walking deeper with the Lord moving
[43:15] forward you want to you want a greater
[43:17] walk with I've always believed that you
[43:19] want a greater walk with God then you
[43:21] need to go deeper you need to you you
[43:24] need to do your part you need to do what
[43:26] you know you can do and then God just
[43:28] automatically he's always there he's
[43:31] always there waiting for you to walk
[43:33] with him amen we just need to go deeper
[43:36] sometimes and we need to get out of our
[43:38] our Conformity we need to get out of our
[43:40] you know idle conditions and so forth
[43:44] It's been a real blessing brother
[43:45] Desmond you know he he got into a
[43:48] thought there on Wednesday night on
[43:49] thirst and it's funny because I was
[43:52] actually working on a message

[44:00] to the message this week with brother

[44:03] and I was but then all of a sudden it
[44:07] just kind of left me
[44:08] and that's the way it happens and I was
[44:10] wondering and then the Lord led me into
[44:12] this this morning where we're going to
[44:14] be but then I come Wednesday night and
[44:16] brother Desmond says thirst and I
[44:18] thought oh my praise God you know that's
[44:21] the body of Christ amen that's the way
[44:23] the body operates you know you're just
[44:26] moving by the spirit of God and You're
[44:28] Expecting
[44:30] you know to receive something from the
[44:32] Lord and you know you're just walking
[44:34] every day and it's simple
[44:37] keep walking in Simplicity Saints praise
[44:40] God and what a time we've been having
[44:42] with our pastor uh that that the word
[44:45] has been just wonderful so let's go to
[44:47] the word this morning amen let's go and
[44:49] see what the Lord has this morning it's
[44:51] going to take all of us together to
[44:54] really benefit this morning from
[44:56] the presence of the Lord and what he has
[44:59] for each and every individual from the
[45:02] youngest to the oldest
[45:05] if you've got expectation in your heart
[45:07] this morning I promise you God will meet
[45:11] a need for you this morning amen that's
[45:14] his desire that's his will that's why we
[45:16] assemble we're going to be looking at
[45:18] all these things let's put up the first
[45:20] slide
[45:21] amen this morning we're going to be
[45:23] looking
[45:24] at um
[45:27] perfect unity in Christ
[45:29] it's all part of the rapturing faith
[45:31] series that we've been on we want to
[45:33] stay there because I believe there's a
[45:35] faith that's coming to this church that
[45:38] the reason why we gather every single
[45:41] Sunday every Wednesday every time you go
[45:43] into a prayer meeting every time you get
[45:45] on your knees is because you're under
[45:47] expectation for the rapture for the body
[45:50] change for the transition for the great
[45:53] next stage of Our Lives it could happen
[45:56] today
[45:57] it could happen in 100 years from now we
[46:00] can't put any interpretation on God's
[46:02] timing but we believe as the Revelation
[46:05] comes to us that we're getting closer
[46:08] and closer amen let's look at our
[46:10] scripture our first scripture reading is
[46:12] from Hebrews chapter 10 verse 23 to 25.
[46:19] and he says let us hold fast the
[46:21] profession of our faith without wavering
[46:24] for he is faithful that promised if
[46:28] there's ever a time that you gotta stand
[46:30] it's right now amen and let us consider
[46:34] one another to provoke unto love and
[46:39] good works not forsaking the assembling
[46:42] of ourselves together
[46:44] as the manner of some is you know a lot
[46:47] of people just don't think they need to
[46:48] go to church anymore
[46:50] as long as we're here on this Earth
[46:54] the body of Christ we need to edify each
[46:58] other amen
[46:59] amen we you try and just sever your arm
[47:02] yeah you can still live
[47:05] but you're not going to be the same
[47:07] you remove an organ from your body
[47:10] you can still live but you're not going
[47:12] to be whole amen well Jesus his body is
[47:16] perfect
[47:18] and this and if we're going to take a
[47:20] Rapture then we're going to need to be
[47:22] in perfect Faith perfect Unity amen
[47:27] praise God
[47:28] next scripture
[47:33] and like it said so much more now we
[47:36] need to assemble so much more
[47:38] as that day approaches what day this day
[47:40] Colossians 3 12-15 says put on therefore
[47:45] as the elect of God holy and beloved
[47:49] bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of
[47:53] Mind meekness long-suffering
[47:57] for bearing one another
[48:01] and forgiving one another
[48:04] If any man have a quarrel against any
[48:08] even as Christ forgave you so also do ye
[48:13] don't hold anything
[48:16] don't hold anything
[48:18] and above all these things put on
[48:20] charity which is the bond of
[48:24] perfectedness Imagine
[48:27] without that love if you're not
[48:30] projecting love into every situation I
[48:33] don't care what it is
[48:36] it can't be perfect we're talking about
[48:38] perfect unity in Christ we're part we're
[48:41] talking about rapturing faith we're
[48:43] talking about getting to a place where
[48:46] that faith in us becomes so real and we
[48:49] become so one and so perfect with it
[48:51] that the change is just going to
[48:53] automatically happen
[48:55] and let the peace of God rule in your
[48:58] hearts to the which also ye are called
[49:01] in one body
[49:03] one body
[49:05] and be ye thankful
[49:08] next scripture
[49:10] the last one before we sit down
[49:12] Jesus prayed to the father now pay
[49:15] attention here
[49:16] we're talking about perfect unity in
[49:19] Christ
[49:19] I pray for them I pray not for the world
[49:24] but for them which thou has given me for
[49:27] they are thine
[49:30] and all mine are thine and all thine are
[49:34] mine and I am glorified in them and now
[49:39] I am no more in the world but these are
[49:42] in the world
[49:44] and I come to thee Holy Father keep
[49:47] through thine own name Those whom thou
[49:50] has given me that they may be one
[49:55] As We Are One
[49:57] you may be seated
[50:00] father we ask your blessing upon this
[50:03] word this morning
[50:04] Lord we want to enter into that
[50:07] perfect Faith perfect Unity perfect love
[50:11] Lord this is the hour where Lord if
[50:15] those things your Prophet said it very
[50:17] clearly nothing but perfect love can
[50:19] enter into that place
[50:21] Lord I know we cannot as human beings
[50:24] fathom it at times Lord because we get
[50:27] into situations we get into heartaches
[50:30] we get into arguments we get into this
[50:33] uh
[50:34] breakups and discrepancies within our
[50:38] whole with our homes within our our
[50:40] workplaces our daily lives Lord but
[50:43] still there is a love that supersedes
[50:46] and Lord that is what we've experienced
[50:48] when you called us you've brought us
[50:50] thus far and we know you're going to
[50:51] take us the rest of the way bless and
[50:54] prosper your service this morning have
[50:56] the preeminence Lord speak to the needs
[50:59] of your people this morning Lord that we
[51:01] can just Rejoice knowing Lord that we've
[51:04] arrived in a special place
[51:07] granted we pray remember our pastor
[51:09] anoint them use him wherever he may be
[51:11] Lord let the word freely flow into the
[51:14] hearts of the people and may they be
[51:16] liberated
[51:18] under the liberty of Christ
[51:20] in Jesus name amen praise God
[51:24] halleluia
[51:28] listen to The Prophet here
[51:31] God and this is from the message uniting
[51:33] time if you get a chance
[51:35] uniting time and sign you want to listen
[51:38] to that a lot of inspiration was drawn
[51:41] from that message
[51:42] I believe that we're living in a
[51:45] wonderful it just caught my attention in
[51:48] a miraculous way uniting time and time
[51:51] you know so here now God is uniting his
[51:55] bride
[51:56] she is coming together from the East and
[51:59] the west and the North and the South
[52:02] there is a uniting time
[52:05] and that's on right now
[52:08] what is she uniting for
[52:11] the rapture
[52:12] amen God's getting her ready yes sir
[52:16] uniting what is she uniting with with
[52:19] the word
[52:21] for all heavens and earth will pass away
[52:24] but my word shall never pass away she's
[52:28] uniting herself with thus saith the Lord
[52:32] regardless of what any denomination or
[52:36] anybody else says
[52:39] it doesn't matter what anybody else says
[52:41] out there there's a lot of teaching
[52:43] going on listen this is the hour where
[52:46] it would be so deceiving it would
[52:48] deceive even the very elect and let me
[52:51] tell you
[52:52] you probably know by experience the kind
[52:54] of things that you come across and and
[52:56] the kind of uh you know discussions you
[52:59] might have with friends with family with
[53:02] people around how people are
[53:04] interpreting the world and the condition
[53:06] of the world and there's you know God is
[53:09] a universal God and and you don't have
[53:11] to believe that Jesus Christ is God God
[53:15] is just in the universe and you can live
[53:17] you can live your life because God is in
[53:20] you God is God is in you you can live
[53:23] any way you want this is the teaching
[53:25] that's out there that's why the world is
[53:28] in the mess that it's in and you've got
[53:30] families broken families like like never
[53:34] before in the history of time
[53:37] families are broken all over the Earth
[53:39] you've got all kinds of interpretations
[53:42] on genders and all these things that
[53:46] that it's all
[53:47] because they've left the word of God and
[53:50] the world has gone into an absolute
[53:52] chaos
[53:55] and you can talk with these people and
[53:57] they'll they've got psychology degrees
[54:00] they've got doctorates
[54:02] they're people that are wealthy and
[54:05] successful and and and very very popular
[54:08] and you know they could be movie stars
[54:12] there's all kinds of you know people
[54:14] that influence other people and if
[54:16] you're not careful you can easily be
[54:19] influenced by what they say because of
[54:22] the way that they've been successful
[54:24] here on this Earth
[54:26] Success is Not popularity success is not
[54:31] more money than you can burn
[54:34] success is not those things to have a
[54:37] hundred different relationships 15
[54:40] different marriages and all kinds of uh
[54:43] that's not success
[54:45] that's death
[54:47] that's that's a World's condition that
[54:49] allows the people to live any way that
[54:51] they want and we've gotten to such a
[54:54] place that if you're not careful you're
[54:56] going to hear these things right in your
[54:58] own homes writing your own families
[55:01] amongst your you know your families
[55:03] because they've they've dropped the bar
[55:06] they've allowed the world's teachings
[55:09] and and Science and and the Doctorate
[55:12] Degrees and the psychologists to
[55:15] override the word of God I say the word
[55:18] of God is our absolute
[55:21] unless you hold the word of God as your
[55:24] absolute you will move into a level of
[55:27] deception you will be deceived you don't
[55:30] want to be deceived you don't want to be
[55:32] caught in this in a situation where
[55:34] everything is progressing in the word of
[55:36] God and you all of a sudden start to
[55:39] decide that you're going to take on the
[55:41] teachings of the world
[55:42] there's a lot of teachings that are good
[55:45] I'm not saying that it's all wrong but
[55:48] if it doesn't line up with the word of
[55:50] God
[55:51] then there's something wrong and it does
[55:54] not lead to life
[55:57] it does not lead to eternal life
[56:00] and so he says here uh um she that that
[56:05] what any denomination or anybody else
[56:08] says she's uniting herself she's getting
[56:12] ready why she is the bride
[56:14] she is the real truth uh the the church
[56:17] that's right and she's uniting herself
[56:19] with her bridegroom
[56:22] see and the bridegroom is the word
[56:26] see that's the thing that a lot of
[56:28] people don't realize
[56:29] what are you joining why are you
[56:31] assembling going to church so often why
[56:33] do you you know assemble yourself so
[56:35] often why do you feel that you need to
[56:36] go to church in order to to live a
[56:39] balanced life
[56:41] because we're uniting with the word and
[56:44] the only thing that's going to stand
[56:45] like he says here Heaven and Earth is
[56:47] going to pass
[56:48] nothing else is going to stand but the
[56:50] word of God
[56:52] so why not join with the word
[56:56] I mean Amen in the beginning was the
[56:59] word the word was with God and the Word
[57:02] was God
[57:04] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[57:07] Among Us now listen and the church and
[57:09] the bride and the word is becoming so
[57:13] one until the very word itself is
[57:17] working out the works of the bridegroom
[57:22] you're coming to a place
[57:24] where he is going to so possess your
[57:26] life
[57:27] because of your surrendering
[57:30] that you will see things happen in your
[57:33] life
[57:34] that you did not have to make an effort
[57:38] to make it happen all you did was you
[57:41] stayed true to the word you stayed loyal
[57:44] to your calling
[57:46] you continued to serve the Lord the best
[57:49] that you knew how amen glory to God you
[57:52] see it a uniting not no more join the
[57:56] church this is not about joining Church
[57:59] we're not trying to get members
[58:02] we're trying to seek out God's sons and
[58:06] daughters
[58:07] they're in that they're in the world
[58:09] they're in denominations they're in
[58:10] different churches but when the word is
[58:14] shined up upon their life
[58:17] and the word is spoken
[58:19] through your testimony or you talking to
[58:22] somebody and there's representation in
[58:25] them remember you didn't you didn't
[58:28] choose this I never chose this we didn't
[58:31] choose to be a part of this church
[58:33] God chose us God called us God
[58:37] supernaturally delivered us God took me
[58:40] out of drug addiction God took me out of
[58:42] the bondage of of of this world and and
[58:46] lust of this world and showed me real
[58:49] life amen and showed you real life you
[58:51] you're seeing at a uniting not join the
[58:54] church not no more this but flee from
[58:56] everything and tied to Jesus Christ see
[59:00] it's the uniting time God uniting his
[59:03] bride together bringing it back just
[59:07] exactly uniting the words of his promise
[59:11] second Thessalonians second chapter it
[59:15] says uh this fifth chapter says the
[59:18] saints that are asleep in the dust of
[59:21] the Earth
[59:22] will awaken
[59:25] and then we will Unite with them the
[59:28] living ones with the ones that's being
[59:31] dead
[59:33] will unite before we even get up
[59:38] there because the bride will be complete
[59:42] when she gets there
[59:44] everything that God needs to do in your
[59:48] personal life right now in order to
[59:50] prepare you for the rapture
[59:52] is going on
[59:55] that's why we're here this morning
[59:58] we're going to look at some things we're
[59:59] going to get you know into areas of Our
[1:00:02] Lives to see what our real motives are
[1:00:04] are we uniting with Christ or are we
[1:00:07] still United with the world
[1:00:12] she gets complete she's when she gets
[1:00:16] there the one that's living that's
[1:00:19] uniting themselves with the word and
[1:00:21] those that are gone already did that
[1:00:24] all the previous ages all the attributes
[1:00:28] of God all the sons of God that United
[1:00:30] under Luther Wesley the Pentecostal age
[1:00:33] brother branham's dispensation they've
[1:00:36] all received what they had need of in
[1:00:39] order to be perfected for their for
[1:00:42] their part in the word but we've got a
[1:00:44] different part
[1:00:46] we come under this dispensation now
[1:00:48] which is being being perfected by the
[1:00:51] Holy Spirit himself the mighty Angel
[1:00:54] perfecting Our Lives dealing with all
[1:00:57] the little imperfections not your your
[1:01:00] carnal imperfections it's your carnal
[1:01:03] thinking
[1:01:04] those imperfections are going to be on
[1:01:07] you but you're thinking your your your
[1:01:10] your faith has to be perfected it needs
[1:01:13] to become rapturing faith in order for
[1:01:15] you to be prepared for the Rapture amen
[1:01:18] glory to God the one that's living
[1:01:20] that's uniting themselves with the word
[1:01:22] and those that are gone already did that
[1:01:25] and it all comes together make one great
[1:01:28] Union of the uniting before going up
[1:01:32] there
[1:01:33] amen praise God hallelujah bless the
[1:01:37] Lord
[1:01:38] amen next slide
[1:01:41] Colossians
[1:01:43] we're talking about God's elect here
[1:01:45] it's only God's elect
[1:01:48] that are actually perfectly United with
[1:01:51] Christ
[1:01:52] perfect Unity cannot come unless you are
[1:01:56] an elected attribute of God hard thing
[1:01:59] to for a lot of people to take they said
[1:02:02] what do you mean God God elects yeah God
[1:02:04] elected from before the foundations of
[1:02:07] the world he's God he knew what was
[1:02:10] going to take place and he knew that you
[1:02:13] were going to choose him
[1:02:15] there's a lot of people that they've
[1:02:17] just decided I don't want Jesus I don't
[1:02:20] believe in God
[1:02:22] I am an atheist they'll tell you right
[1:02:24] to your face
[1:02:25] and there's nothing you can do about
[1:02:27] that because that's what they are
[1:02:29] you can't change them the Bible talks
[1:02:33] about the fact that we've got
[1:02:35] sons of God and we've got
[1:02:38] children of the world
[1:02:40] okay
[1:02:41] you can't change that
[1:02:43] so in Colossians 3 12 and 13 it says put
[1:02:47] on therefore
[1:02:48] as the elect of God
[1:02:50] holy and beloved bowels of mercies
[1:02:53] kindness humbleness of mine meekness
[1:02:58] long-suffering forbearing one another
[1:03:01] and forgiving one another
[1:03:05] you wonder
[1:03:07] brother Danny why are you bringing these
[1:03:09] scriptures
[1:03:10] these are simple scriptures that we've
[1:03:12] all read
[1:03:13] there's people that have unforgiving
[1:03:15] hearts right here
[1:03:19] there's people that are dealing with
[1:03:22] things Scars From the Past
[1:03:25] Experiences from the past
[1:03:27] elements that they just don't want to
[1:03:29] let go of
[1:03:31] no matter how much they try it keeps the
[1:03:35] devil keeps coming back and throwing it
[1:03:37] in your face bringing up the past
[1:03:40] showing listen when God forgives he
[1:03:44] forgets
[1:03:45] our problem as human beings is that we
[1:03:49] have trouble forgetting
[1:03:51] we're we're stuck in this carnal realm
[1:03:54] where we keep replaying these these
[1:03:57] battles over and over and over in our
[1:04:00] minds and we find ourselves in a
[1:04:02] defeated condition God doesn't want to
[1:04:05] leave you that way God wants you to be
[1:04:09] liberated set free so that you can live
[1:04:12] a liberated life in Christ victorious in
[1:04:15] Christ
[1:04:16] have a have a happy you should be one of
[1:04:19] the happiest people in the world knowing
[1:04:22] that Christ has given you Eternal
[1:04:25] salvation that is something that's been
[1:04:27] revealed to you that you were always a
[1:04:29] son of God
[1:04:30] you were Justified before you made your
[1:04:33] mistakes God already Justified you
[1:04:36] he had the answer before the question
[1:04:39] Oh Glory to God that's one of the things
[1:04:41] that I remember when I came to the Lord
[1:04:44] and I had so many questions in my mind
[1:04:47] and all those questions were about my
[1:04:50] sin my unbelief the things that I that
[1:04:53] that had me chained they were chains of
[1:04:56] circumstance you know who held those
[1:04:58] chains it was my own carnal thinking
[1:05:01] that kept me under the bondage of those
[1:05:03] chains because I would believe the
[1:05:05] devil's lies
[1:05:07] it's time to to disbelieve the devil's
[1:05:10] lies
[1:05:11] it's time to be set free from those
[1:05:14] those chains of bondage so that you can
[1:05:16] live a Victorious Life Next slide
[1:05:19] Ephesians chapter 1 verses 4 to 5
[1:05:23] according as he hath chosen us remember
[1:05:26] you didn't choose Christ
[1:05:29] this is not something that you did this
[1:05:31] is not oh I chose I decided to join Good
[1:05:33] Neighbor Ministries you didn't choose to
[1:05:35] join Good Neighbor Ministries
[1:05:37] if you're here it's because God invited
[1:05:39] you
[1:05:41] and sometimes people get invited and
[1:05:43] they don't last long because the word of
[1:05:45] God will disinvite them
[1:05:47] because if they can't stay with the word
[1:05:50] they get left behind and they
[1:05:52] automatically just
[1:05:53] dissipate away and all of this is part
[1:05:57] of the scripture this is the thing that
[1:05:58] you know we need to realize and
[1:06:00] understand we are compassionate we love
[1:06:03] one another I love each and every one of
[1:06:07] you
[1:06:08] I I you're you're the real family you're
[1:06:12] you're our real family
[1:06:14] okay we've got natural family and I love
[1:06:17] them dearly too
[1:06:19] okay but my faith in the word of God and
[1:06:23] and the spirit of God and the Holy
[1:06:25] Spirit in in our lives it's what really
[1:06:28] bonds us as true uh true family because
[1:06:31] it's Eternal yeah
[1:06:34] this Earth we're here for so many years
[1:06:36] and I will love and I will honor my
[1:06:39] mother and my father all the days of my
[1:06:41] life here on this Earth
[1:06:43] and I believe that God has a special
[1:06:45] place for them all those that I love all
[1:06:47] those that love me I I I believe that
[1:06:50] God is going to do something special in
[1:06:52] their lives but when they can't accept
[1:06:55] this word that we believe the reason why
[1:06:58] we assemble every Sunday the reason why
[1:07:00] we come together and we Fellowship you
[1:07:03] know and we we go to the park and people
[1:07:05] might see us there and you'll see
[1:07:07] African Jamaican Filipino Italian
[1:07:12] Portuguese like it's a full mix of
[1:07:15] people what is it that brings these
[1:07:17] people together that they can have such
[1:07:19] Unity it's Christ
[1:07:21] it's the Holy Ghost it's the power of
[1:07:24] God what he did listen nobody can tell
[1:07:27] me
[1:07:28] that God didn't use that man right there
[1:07:30] God had to use that man and nobody can
[1:07:32] tell me that it wasn't brother Desmond
[1:07:34] that God used to get to that man there
[1:07:37] and it's all God's plan it was all part
[1:07:40] of God's purpose
[1:07:43] I could not see the things that I see
[1:07:45] and believe the things that I believed
[1:07:47] and loved my brother Chris and love my
[1:07:49] brother Bill and love my brother I could
[1:07:52] not possibly do those things unless
[1:07:54] there was something deposited
[1:07:58] or or brought out of me
[1:08:02] to experience that kind of love
[1:08:07] this is what
[1:08:09] true unity in Christ produces
[1:08:12] so according as he hath chosen Us in him
[1:08:16] before the foundations of the world
[1:08:19] it's hard to explain that to your to
[1:08:21] your friends and your family
[1:08:23] you know I was a Son of God before I
[1:08:26] came to this earth
[1:08:28] because the Bible says I was chosen
[1:08:30] before the foundations of this world
[1:08:33] I'm not telling you something that that
[1:08:36] I'm making up here I'm showing you by
[1:08:39] the word of God and then something
[1:08:41] resonates in me constantly over and over
[1:08:45] and over again that it's the truth
[1:08:48] because something keeps coming and
[1:08:50] whenever battle comes my way no matter
[1:08:53] what the devil throws at me no matter
[1:08:55] how hard he knocks me down something
[1:08:57] inside keeps getting me back up
[1:09:01] you've got that experience
[1:09:04] you're still walking with the Lord
[1:09:05] something keeps holding you something
[1:09:08] keeps bringing you back something keeps
[1:09:11] pressing you towards the mark of the
[1:09:14] High Calling which is in Christ Jesus
[1:09:18] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:09:22] before him in love how can you be holy
[1:09:27] it's impossible
[1:09:29] it's the Holy Ghost In You
[1:09:33] that that expresses the Holiness of his
[1:09:37] spirit
[1:09:38] that's that's the Paradox Saints as long
[1:09:41] as we're in this Dimension and we're in
[1:09:43] this flesh you're going to see things on
[1:09:46] me that you know you're going to see The
[1:09:47] Human Side and then you're gonna see the
[1:09:49] god attribute from now from time to time
[1:09:52] that's the paradox that's the thing and
[1:09:55] we understand that and that's why we can
[1:09:57] still be in the world and not of the
[1:10:00] world understanding by Revelation that
[1:10:03] we were Sons and Daughters of God before
[1:10:05] we came here
[1:10:07] but we got to deal with the things here
[1:10:09] we gotta we still gotta work we still
[1:10:11] got to move with our friends and our
[1:10:13] neighbors we still got to project the
[1:10:15] love of God if God doesn't want them in
[1:10:18] your life God will remove them from your
[1:10:20] life amen you will make certain choices
[1:10:23] at times that will remove you from those
[1:10:26] situations because God is leading you
[1:10:29] don't worry God is doing this God is
[1:10:32] perfecting having predestinated us unto
[1:10:35] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:10:39] to himself according to his good
[1:10:42] pleasure and whose will
[1:10:44] was it your will oh I decide I'm going
[1:10:47] to go and join Good Neighbor Ministries
[1:10:49] I'm going to go there I'm going to be a
[1:10:51] deacon
[1:10:53] you got people like that you know
[1:10:55] they join the church I'm going to be
[1:10:57] this and I'm going to be that and before
[1:10:59] you know it
[1:11:00] I'm going to be looking for a new church
[1:11:03] because this is a supernatural body
[1:11:07] this is not just I'm gonna join Church
[1:11:12] we want to fill the house of the Lord
[1:11:16] we want to fill the house of the Lord
[1:11:17] everybody is welcome into this place
[1:11:21] everybody okay if God could call you in
[1:11:25] the condition that you were in while we
[1:11:27] were yet sinners ye what
[1:11:30] he died and he loved us
[1:11:33] amen and so nobody nobody is is
[1:11:38] discounted never nobody everybody is
[1:11:42] welcome into the house of the Lord the
[1:11:44] word will deal with them
[1:11:47] Sometimes they come in for one service
[1:11:49] and you never see them again
[1:11:51] sometimes they keep coming and all of a
[1:11:53] sudden you start to see things falling
[1:11:55] away from their lives things liberating
[1:11:58] them being set free that's what the
[1:12:00] house of the Lord is for that's why we
[1:12:02] need to assemble ourselves the more so
[1:12:05] now as that day approaches because it's
[1:12:08] perfecting time
[1:12:09] he's going to take out those little
[1:12:11] foxes that spoil the vine all those
[1:12:14] little things all those little
[1:12:15] imperfections amen Romans look at the
[1:12:18] next scripture Romans 8 30 moreover whom
[1:12:21] he did predestinate and this is
[1:12:23] beautiful I love this
[1:12:25] then he also called
[1:12:28] so
[1:12:30] when it's your time
[1:12:32] for God to call he's going to call you
[1:12:36] he chose I I asked him all the time Lord
[1:12:39] why did you wait 33 years
[1:12:42] so call me
[1:12:44] I because there was a lot of people that
[1:12:46] were that were like you know
[1:12:49] giving me the word of God saying hey
[1:12:51] Danny you need to read the Bible you
[1:12:53] need to come to my church for years that
[1:12:55] went on
[1:12:56] but no call
[1:12:58] there was no call
[1:13:00] there's a difference when God calls you
[1:13:03] you know the difference
[1:13:05] because not only does he call
[1:13:07] he visits
[1:13:09] he comes to your home he starts to deal
[1:13:12] with the circumstances he's still doing
[1:13:14] that amen he's still dealing with all
[1:13:17] those little circumstances in your life
[1:13:18] it's just that you've gotten hurt you've
[1:13:21] gotten hard in your in your condition
[1:13:22] you've gotten you know to a place where
[1:13:25] where you just you know you're you're
[1:13:26] getting impatient you you need to get
[1:13:29] that patience back you need to get you
[1:13:31] know where be still and know that I am
[1:13:34] God you need to come into those times
[1:13:35] because I'm telling you by experience
[1:13:38] I'm I'm I've been tested on being I'm
[1:13:41] being heavily tested and the only thing
[1:13:44] I can do is be still sometimes and just
[1:13:47] say Lord I know that you're God I know I
[1:13:49] I've got no words I've got no I've got
[1:13:52] no no no interpretation for this I can't
[1:13:55] put an interpretation on this and you're
[1:13:57] going to face those kinds of situations
[1:13:59] and the reason why is because he's
[1:14:01] perfecting you now
[1:14:02] understand that those things are coming
[1:14:04] for a reason you're being set free when
[1:14:08] you get to a place where you just don't
[1:14:10] know what to do you're at the weakest
[1:14:12] point you just don't know there's no
[1:14:14] answer coming to you you're just
[1:14:16] literally like like like stunned and
[1:14:18] you're sitting there and you're just
[1:14:19] waiting for the answer waiting for
[1:14:21] something to happen God will do it in
[1:14:24] his time he cannot leave you he cannot
[1:14:27] forsake you that's his promise
[1:14:29] it just it just so them he also called
[1:14:33] and whom he called them he also
[1:14:35] Justified
[1:14:37] so I don't care what you've done
[1:14:39] I don't care what sin you you've been
[1:14:42] carrying and what what kind of luggage
[1:14:44] you're still holding this morning I'm
[1:14:47] telling you you can be set free because
[1:14:49] he already set you free
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:53] before you got into that condition he
[1:14:57] had an answer
[1:14:58] he had the answer he says you're
[1:15:01] Justified and if you look up Justified
[1:15:03] it means you never did it in the first
[1:15:05] place
[1:15:06] something possessed Your Vessel
[1:15:08] something possessed your lips you said
[1:15:11] things that you knew you shouldn't have
[1:15:13] said don't worry you're Justified
[1:15:17] if you need to make it right with that
[1:15:18] person whoever it was you need to you
[1:15:21] know get set free from that because in
[1:15:23] the flesh we still deal with this human
[1:15:26] emotion
[1:15:27] we still gotta look at one another we
[1:15:29] still got to pass one another we still
[1:15:32] got to have those experiences with one
[1:15:34] another and and it's hard sometimes this
[1:15:37] this nature of the Flesh and all the
[1:15:39] scars of the past and generational
[1:15:42] spirits and things that that our parents
[1:15:44] put upon us our friends put Upon Us bad
[1:15:48] emotional experiences put upon you and
[1:15:51] you are judging your life through those
[1:15:54] experiences no more
[1:15:57] no more today you can be justified as
[1:16:00] though you never did it in the first
[1:16:01] place and all you've got to do is accept
[1:16:03] it receive it and believe it and walk
[1:16:06] with God
[1:16:09] and whom he justified them he also will
[1:16:12] bring in the rapture
[1:16:14] and we'll glorify you and we'll change
[1:16:16] you in a moment in the twinkling of an
[1:16:18] eye it's not going to be something that
[1:16:20] you're going to need to do amen praise
[1:16:22] God next slide listen this is our time
[1:16:27] this is our time I said I said when I
[1:16:29] was listening to brother Brown he says
[1:16:31] uniting time and sign I said Lord
[1:16:35] there's a sign
[1:16:36] for the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:16:39] there's a time and a sign and a season
[1:16:41] for all things everything works in God's
[1:16:45] time and season brother Philip we don't
[1:16:47] have to worry that you know that lawn
[1:16:50] situation there was a time and a season
[1:16:52] for you to deal with that you've been
[1:16:53] living there for a few years but God
[1:16:55] knew the time in the season and when God
[1:16:57] does something he does it right
[1:16:59] and that's how we got to believe that
[1:17:01] when God is going to heal that situation
[1:17:04] in your life when God is going to amend
[1:17:07] you when God is going to restore you
[1:17:10] he doesn't half-heartedly do it
[1:17:12] he does it
[1:17:14] it's done hallelujah it's blue it's done
[1:17:18] so you know when when we look at the
[1:17:21] word Unity
[1:17:23] just leave that slide there for now
[1:17:25] we're going to just talk for we're going
[1:17:26] to look at a few things when we look at
[1:17:28] the word UNIF Unity it's defined as a
[1:17:31] common goal
[1:17:33] a common denominator
[1:17:35] do we have a common denominator this
[1:17:37] morning
[1:17:37] hallelujah oh I'll send you the
[1:17:40] comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he
[1:17:43] will guide you and lead you into all
[1:17:46] truth how can the Holy Ghost In You
[1:17:50] bring you to Jehovah Witness when the
[1:17:53] Holy Ghost In Me is bringing me to the
[1:17:56] word
[1:17:57] you see it cannot be the holy spirit is
[1:18:01] one Jesus we read the scripture Lord
[1:18:03] they are thine and and they are mine as
[1:18:07] they are mine and you are mine and we
[1:18:08] are one as they are one and we are all
[1:18:10] one it's the body of Jesus Christ the
[1:18:13] Holy Ghost there is no possible way
[1:18:16] listen I know this sounds simple but you
[1:18:19] got to get it and keep it straight in
[1:18:21] your mind the Holy Ghost that's in you
[1:18:24] that's awakened in you cannot sin it
[1:18:29] cannot disbelieve the word of God it
[1:18:32] can't go against the word so the moment
[1:18:34] I say to somebody you got the Holy Ghost
[1:18:36] they go yeah oh yeah I got the holy
[1:18:38] ghost man I had a such a sensation I
[1:18:40] said praise God how are you baptized
[1:18:43] I was baptized in a tank
[1:18:46] I said how oh in the name of the Trinity
[1:18:49] the name of the father and the Son and
[1:18:51] the Holy Ghost I said that's not
[1:18:53] scriptural the Holy Ghost would never do
[1:18:57] that
[1:18:58] the holy spirit is not a trinity
[1:19:02] the holy spirit is God it's the power
[1:19:04] it's the anointing it's the presence of
[1:19:07] God Amen it's not three in one it's all
[1:19:12] one Jesus coming to the Earth was the
[1:19:15] word made flesh in the beginning was the
[1:19:19] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:19:21] Word was God
[1:19:23] so if we know that the Word was God then
[1:19:27] then then there's no two different gods
[1:19:30] or three different gods and Jesus when
[1:19:33] he's talking about the harmony between
[1:19:35] him and the father he's talking about
[1:19:37] Harmony between him on Earth as a human
[1:19:41] being being expressed the word made
[1:19:44] flesh with the will of the Father which
[1:19:47] was him in his one Almighty Elohim
[1:19:51] existence self-existent one all he did
[1:19:54] was Project himself
[1:19:57] and so he projected now into you his
[1:20:00] spirit
[1:20:01] and there's got to be Unity by that one
[1:20:05] common denominator the minute that
[1:20:07] there's two different teachings it
[1:20:09] separates
[1:20:10] how can two walk together lest they
[1:20:13] agree and the biggest denominator for us
[1:20:16] is the Holy Ghost
[1:20:17] I remember when I came to this
[1:20:20] Revelation and I went to Pastor Simon I
[1:20:23] said I want to be baptized he says
[1:20:25] that's I said I I want I want to receive
[1:20:27] the Holy Ghost I want to receive the
[1:20:29] Holy Ghost because I realized that was
[1:20:31] the power of God that was the thing that
[1:20:33] that that that you know would would be
[1:20:35] like the supernatural element in my life
[1:20:37] that's how I believed it he looked he
[1:20:40] says brother you got the Holy Ghost
[1:20:42] I do he says yeah
[1:20:45] he says you got the Holy Ghost but
[1:20:47] you're you're expressing it now by by
[1:20:50] like the scripture says you're being
[1:20:52] baptized because it's an outward
[1:20:54] expression of something that you've come
[1:20:56] to realize within you
[1:20:59] and so this common denominator can never
[1:21:02] ever be compromised
[1:21:04] it can't there's no compromising on the
[1:21:07] Holy Ghost amen it's Oneness of mind
[1:21:11] there's a Harmony
[1:21:13] when the Holy Ghost is in the midst
[1:21:16] of your fellowship
[1:21:18] there's a Harmony there
[1:21:20] there's a Harmony
[1:21:22] what happens sometimes we get into
[1:21:24] fellowship and and you know we start to
[1:21:27] put our own interpretations on things
[1:21:31] and if our own interpretation doesn't
[1:21:33] exactly sound the same way as the other
[1:21:37] individual that's speaking we gotta
[1:21:40] immediately
[1:21:42] make sure that our interpretation is
[1:21:45] made clear and it's this is it
[1:21:48] take it or leave it
[1:21:51] that's not the Holy Ghost
[1:21:54] when that kind of attitude comes in I'm
[1:21:56] not talking about listen when I say
[1:21:57] common denominator and you and you know
[1:22:00] that you got the Holy Ghost you will
[1:22:02] also know when somebody denies the word
[1:22:04] they're not awake yet
[1:22:07] they're either not awake yet or they'll
[1:22:09] never have it it's as simple as that you
[1:22:12] can't change that you can't alter that
[1:22:14] that's God's choosing I chose you from
[1:22:17] before the foundation I didn't chew
[1:22:19] Jesus himself said to his disciples when
[1:22:21] they came to him says Lord how come
[1:22:23] they're leaving why are they leaving
[1:22:26] he says he looked at them he says unto
[1:22:29] you it's been given to know the
[1:22:31] mysteries of the Kingdom
[1:22:32] but unto them it has not been given you
[1:22:37] can't change that you can't alter that
[1:22:39] so don't try and make somebody something
[1:22:41] that they're not
[1:22:43] when True Fellowship and understanding
[1:22:47] of the unity of being perfectly United
[1:22:49] with Christ
[1:22:51] allows you to sit in the midst of it and
[1:22:54] be still
[1:22:55] and allow that person even if they're
[1:22:58] wrong they should still feel a love
[1:23:01] coming from you
[1:23:03] they should still feel that that that
[1:23:06] there's that there's something in you
[1:23:08] that that desires good for them
[1:23:12] amen that's you know like we need to
[1:23:15] check ourselves sometimes
[1:23:17] pride is a terrible thing wants to make
[1:23:21] us be the the absolute our our
[1:23:25] interpretation is the way it is no other
[1:23:27] way no
[1:23:28] God is his own interpreter God will make
[1:23:32] it plain God can open their eyes God can
[1:23:34] do whatever he needs to do and if God
[1:23:36] needs to remove them from your life
[1:23:38] he'll remove them
[1:23:39] you don't need to get into that huff and
[1:23:42] that puff and that and that that battle
[1:23:44] that comes with this carnal Realm
[1:23:46] because it's tough those bottles are
[1:23:49] hard
[1:23:50] we want to be set free from all of that
[1:23:53] that's what that's what we're we're
[1:23:54] looking at this morning amen it's it's
[1:23:57] Oneness of mind there's a Harmony
[1:23:59] there's an agreement there's a teamwork
[1:24:02] there's an edification because the
[1:24:05] purpose and the plan is all about God's
[1:24:08] purpose all God's plan God's will we
[1:24:11] know what the scripture says
[1:24:13] it's it's the totality of combining all
[1:24:17] parts into one whole
[1:24:20] God is calling in
[1:24:23] those last few he's bringing them into
[1:24:26] the body how he does it
[1:24:29] that's what makes him God
[1:24:31] that's what makes him so great
[1:24:34] and in unity there is an absence of
[1:24:40] division
[1:24:42] there's an absence of varied thinking
[1:24:45] there's an uh there's no there let us
[1:24:49] reason the Bible says let us reason
[1:24:53] together
[1:24:55] right
[1:24:56] let's let's let's come together in a way
[1:24:58] that when we Fellowship we reason with
[1:25:01] one another and we we show the love of
[1:25:04] God and and and and and put on patience
[1:25:07] and put on those things that that God
[1:25:10] because listen this is the time where
[1:25:12] we're getting perfected
[1:25:14] and if you're coming into this church
[1:25:16] and you're assembling yourself is
[1:25:18] because you want to be set free
[1:25:21] from those things that are holding you
[1:25:23] back am I right I mean I mean is that
[1:25:26] not the purpose in US joining and and
[1:25:28] why like why do we go to church there's
[1:25:31] reasons why we go to church and one of
[1:25:33] the reasons is to celebrate God's love
[1:25:37] you're celebrating the fact that God
[1:25:39] loves you and God loves me and has
[1:25:42] brought us together in in this Unity
[1:25:44] that that that brings Harmony that
[1:25:48] brings strength you know
[1:25:50] two together can cast out ten thousand
[1:25:54] imagine what a group together that that
[1:25:57] have the same understanding and the same
[1:26:00] revelation of unity in Christ what can
[1:26:03] be achieved in that body
[1:26:06] we come to thank the Lord for life and
[1:26:10] life's blessings I mean these are simple
[1:26:11] things but you know what God is blessing
[1:26:14] us
[1:26:15] God is blessing you God is keeping you
[1:26:18] God Is providing your needs and when we
[1:26:20] come together we come to give thanks for
[1:26:23] the blessings that God pours out upon
[1:26:25] our lives and we give thanks for one
[1:26:27] another amen we come to feed on the word
[1:26:30] of God so that the word sets us free
[1:26:34] the word liberates us we come to worship
[1:26:37] God in spirit and in truth
[1:26:40] okay we're not here just to you know oh
[1:26:42] they're good song Services they're more
[1:26:44] than just good song Services their
[1:26:47] preparation to get us into the presence
[1:26:49] of the Lord to get us into Heavenly
[1:26:51] places where I can be set free from a
[1:26:54] disease that's trying to take my life
[1:26:56] from a heartache that's trying to break
[1:26:58] my family from a a broken relationship
[1:27:02] from a from a financial disaster that
[1:27:05] might be taking place for whatever it is
[1:27:07] you've come because you know that the
[1:27:09] supernatural can happen you believe in
[1:27:12] it you believe that God can do those
[1:27:14] things in your life you believe that
[1:27:16] either you believe it or you don't I
[1:27:18] won't like why would you be here I'm
[1:27:20] here because I need the Holy Spirit to
[1:27:23] help me perfect and get through this
[1:27:26] time in my life and the situations that
[1:27:28] I'm dealing with we all have them
[1:27:30] regardless
[1:27:32] Hallelujah to fellowship with your
[1:27:35] family in Christ that's why we come and
[1:27:37] we come to minister our gifts one to
[1:27:41] another
[1:27:44] I love a great gift of sin
[1:27:48] it blesses it edifies it encourages when
[1:27:52] that singer is singing by Revelation and
[1:27:54] in their heart they've had an experience
[1:27:56] it comes through by the spirit and it
[1:27:59] meets the needs of the people
[1:28:02] I love that gift of edification
[1:28:04] when I need to be edified some brothers
[1:28:06] they can edify
[1:28:08] some brothers they can discern
[1:28:12] it's all part of the it's all part of
[1:28:14] the body of Christ all for a purpose so
[1:28:16] that we together can be set free and
[1:28:19] liberated in Christ
[1:28:21] all for that one purpose everyone needs
[1:28:25] to have a home Church
[1:28:27] listen to the prophet he says every man
[1:28:30] ought to have a church home you ought to
[1:28:32] have a place not just to float around
[1:28:34] from Pillar To Post
[1:28:36] a lot of people they're going to this
[1:28:38] church because they don't like the way
[1:28:39] the pastor talks about Tides too much
[1:28:41] and then they'll go to this church
[1:28:43] because they like to worship and then
[1:28:45] they might go to this church because you
[1:28:47] know they don't like a certain brother
[1:28:49] or sister
[1:28:53] you know the one that's often talking
[1:28:55] about the problems is the problem even
[1:29:02] you ought to have a place not just to
[1:29:05] float around from Pillar To Post but
[1:29:07] have somewhere that you go to church and
[1:29:10] you call it your church
[1:29:13] that's my church
[1:29:15] that's my family that's my that's my
[1:29:18] ministry that's where God has placed me
[1:29:20] it's a supernatural church every Sunday
[1:29:23] the spirit of God comes and anoints the
[1:29:25] ministry and I get fed I get encouraged
[1:29:29] I get edified I get delivered from the
[1:29:32] sin that that so easily tries to pull me
[1:29:35] here and pull me there I get set free
[1:29:38] and then when I'm free I'm free indeed
[1:29:40] I'm free like it never happened in the
[1:29:43] first place I've got a revelation of
[1:29:44] justification I don't go out there and
[1:29:47] try to sin so that I can come to service
[1:29:48] on Sunday so I can be set free
[1:29:51] that's not the way it works
[1:29:53] we don't take Grace and make it a
[1:29:55] disgrace but I also know that you as a
[1:29:58] human being have flaws I got flaws we
[1:30:02] all got flaws we're all going to make
[1:30:04] mistakes we're all going to say things
[1:30:06] that we don't want to say we're all
[1:30:08] going to do things that we wish we never
[1:30:09] done Paul said oh Wretched Man that I am
[1:30:12] my God he says the things that I should
[1:30:15] do I don't do the things that I
[1:30:17] shouldn't do I do what is it it's this
[1:30:20] flesh it fights us every single day but
[1:30:24] then he said but thanks be to Jesus
[1:30:27] Christ thanks be to God the holy spirit
[1:30:29] that keeps coming back over and over and
[1:30:33] over again Hallelujah we should have
[1:30:36] somewhere that you go to church and you
[1:30:38] call it your church somewhere you pay
[1:30:40] your tithe and somewhere that you help
[1:30:44] support the cause
[1:30:46] amen glory to God hallelujah take your
[1:30:50] choice but then don't never
[1:30:52] disfellowship the other man because he
[1:30:55] don't belong with your group you see
[1:30:57] there's
[1:30:58] there's the balance you know what I mean
[1:31:01] just because they don't come to your
[1:31:03] church
[1:31:04] that don't mean that you disfellowship
[1:31:06] them

[1:31:10] spirit
[1:31:11] and see if he's got the same purpose

[1:31:20] then you've got Fellowship one with
[1:31:22] another you're working for one great
[1:31:25] cause that's the cause of Christ I think
[1:31:29] that that is absolutely true amen a real
[1:31:34] born-again man or woman that's got
[1:31:36] discernment of the Holy Ghost will find
[1:31:38] his place in church
[1:31:41] worshiping crying out and doing all that
[1:31:45] is in his life to try and bring Sinners
[1:31:49] to Christ

[1:33:46] Tuesday Thursday Sunday I said what
[1:33:52] he says I can pick you up any one of
[1:33:54] those days
[1:33:57] but what was that
[1:33:59] it was God's time it was God's choosing
[1:34:02] it was God's
[1:34:04] it didn't matter God says don't worry
[1:34:07] just get him there something was on him
[1:34:09] to get me there why now we know
[1:34:13] it's all we can do
[1:34:16] but we believe that God knew because
[1:34:19] when I was there I didn't want to be
[1:34:21] there the first few I was wondering what
[1:34:23] in the world am I doing here
[1:34:25] but God had a purpose God had a plan
[1:34:28] and God still does that don't
[1:34:31] underestimate anybody
[1:34:34] there's nothing too hard for the Lord I
[1:34:36] look at situations and I see certain
[1:34:39] situations and I tell them well I'm
[1:34:42] going to pray for you
[1:34:43] I'm going to pray about that situation
[1:34:45] in your life oh really I go yeah I'm a
[1:34:48] minister I believe in the power of
[1:34:50] prayer really yeah
[1:34:53] I said I'm the evidence of the power of
[1:34:55] prayer somebody was praying for me
[1:34:57] at some point and I got delivered
[1:35:00] and I believe it I know it it's the
[1:35:02] truth and I believe you can do the same
[1:35:04] for you if you'll just accept it he says
[1:35:07] thank you thank you pray for me
[1:35:11] okay but when they turn around they say
[1:35:13] I don't need prayer you say that's fine
[1:35:15] God bless you anyway
[1:35:18] what can I say
[1:35:20] this is this is this is not something
[1:35:22] you chose
[1:35:24] I'd rather you belong to church and be a
[1:35:26] sinner than not go to church at all
[1:35:28] you're doing well with that what you're
[1:35:30] doing but now why not come and be a real
[1:35:34] Christian
[1:35:35] why not get that real love of God in
[1:35:38] your heart oh boy let me tell you when
[1:35:40] that love of God pierces your heart you
[1:35:43] can never be the same
[1:35:45] you'll never be the same you'll never
[1:35:47] look at anybody the same way oh you'll
[1:35:49] you'll get upset with the devil oh yeah
[1:35:51] you'll get upset with the devil I get
[1:35:53] upset with the devil all the time he's
[1:35:55] taking shots all the time he's taking
[1:35:57] him on you all the time that's his job
[1:36:00] I tell my wife every day
[1:36:02] you know she'll call me and say oh this
[1:36:03] is going on this is going honestly yup
[1:36:05] that old Devil's up to his work he
[1:36:08] punched in this morning
[1:36:09] he's doing his job but I said but you
[1:36:12] make sure you're doing yours
[1:36:14] when you need to pray you get down and
[1:36:16] pray
[1:36:17] when you need to bind those Spirits I
[1:36:19] said let's pray right now when we're
[1:36:21] right while we're on the phone I said
[1:36:22] let's bind that thing right now
[1:36:24] two hours later it was like it never
[1:36:26] happened because God is God God can
[1:36:30] still deliver God can still deal with
[1:36:33] those situations in your life don't you
[1:36:35] accept those things when when those
[1:36:37] things come around speak the word no
[1:36:39] matter how weak you might feel all you
[1:36:42] do just go say Lord I believe your word
[1:36:44] and in the name of Jesus Christ I bind
[1:36:47] this enemy right now
[1:36:49] it's trying to take my mind it's trying
[1:36:51] to remember the greatest battle is right
[1:36:53] here eh
[1:36:54] that still has not changed you will
[1:36:57] fight this battle every single day of
[1:36:59] your life until you leave here
[1:37:01] but understand that there are two sides
[1:37:04] to the coin
[1:37:05] and if you're listening to that Devil
[1:37:07] he's going to have you down and out but
[1:37:09] if you listen to the promises of God's
[1:37:11] word you'll keep getting back up again
[1:37:13] it'll just happen you'll just keep
[1:37:16] getting back up again I don't know
[1:37:18] there's many rise up and go out and say
[1:37:21] oh I don't need to go to church anymore
[1:37:23] praise God the Holy Ghost has come he's
[1:37:26] the teacher when you get that idea
[1:37:28] you're just wrong
[1:37:30] when you think that you don't you've
[1:37:32] been going to church long enough and now
[1:37:34] you don't need to go to church you're
[1:37:35] wrong
[1:37:36] you need to go to church
[1:37:38] you need to be a part of the mystical
[1:37:40] body of Jesus Christ you need to receive
[1:37:43] the supernatural spirit that comes out
[1:37:45] of this Pulpit every Sunday every
[1:37:47] Wednesday you need to be a part of The
[1:37:49] Prayer Ministry you need to have those
[1:37:51] balances in your life because those are
[1:37:54] the things that you get victory over
[1:37:57] that's how the victory comes you wonder
[1:38:00] wow you know like this situation looked
[1:38:02] really bad and all of a sudden
[1:38:06] somebody made a way out
[1:38:08] the Lord made a way
[1:38:10] the Lord moves in mysterious ways
[1:38:13] because you've been praying because
[1:38:15] you're there on those Friday nights and
[1:38:17] you're praying about those situations
[1:38:18] and you're down on your knees and you're
[1:38:20] praying every day and every morning God
[1:38:23] hears all those things God hears your
[1:38:26] heart God knows your desires God knows
[1:38:28] the pain that you're going through when
[1:38:30] you go to him with a sincere and broken
[1:38:33] contrite heart sometimes you're broken
[1:38:36] when you're at the weakest Point
[1:38:38] remember he's the strong
[1:38:40] element in your life praise God the Holy
[1:38:43] Ghost has come he's the teacher when you
[1:38:45] get that idea you're just wrong for why
[1:38:47] did the Holy Ghost set teachers in the
[1:38:49] church if he was going to be the teacher
[1:38:54] see
[1:38:55] there are first apostles prophets
[1:38:58] teachers evangelists and pastors and the
[1:39:01] Holy Spirit set teachers in the church
[1:39:03] so he could teach through that teacher
[1:39:12] what is church
[1:39:14] it's a place of refreshing and rest
[1:39:19] it's a place
[1:39:21] where you can get liberated
[1:39:24] you can be set free it's a place of
[1:39:26] healing
[1:39:27] and forgiveness
[1:39:29] these are simple things but I want to
[1:39:31] remind you this morning that these are
[1:39:33] all available to you
[1:39:35] you can be forgiven you can be healed
[1:39:37] you can be restored this morning
[1:39:40] and you can go out and be victorious for
[1:39:43] the rest of the week
[1:39:46] it's a place of restoration it's a place
[1:39:49] of Celebration we celebrate the grace of
[1:39:52] God in our lives we celebrate the
[1:39:55] victories we celebrate the victory
[1:39:57] reports when when one of our brothers or
[1:40:00] sisters are Weeping we weep with them
[1:40:02] when they when they Rejoice we Rejoice
[1:40:05] with them
[1:40:06] that's what unity in Christ brings us
[1:40:09] together it's a revelation of who we
[1:40:12] really are and once we really know who
[1:40:15] we are there's no this one's better than
[1:40:18] that one or this one's better or he's
[1:40:21] better than me or she's better than me
[1:40:23] it goes beyond all of that that's all
[1:40:26] things of this world we don't operate by
[1:40:28] that
[1:40:29] Hallelujah glory to God you can't stay
[1:40:33] home and and and and not
[1:40:36] and get strengthened you can't stay home
[1:40:40] and do that you need to be a part of the
[1:40:42] body you need to assemble you need to
[1:40:44] come together you need to be more and
[1:40:48] more one with Christ and your brothers
[1:40:50] and your sisters why because we need one
[1:40:53] another more than we ever did need each
[1:40:56] other
[1:40:57] it's right now that we need one another
[1:41:00] especially right now what we're going
[1:41:02] through in our ministry the transition
[1:41:04] that's taking place right now in the
[1:41:07] ministry God is doing something it's it
[1:41:10] we're all kind of just in in expectation
[1:41:14] we're all just waiting on the Lord to
[1:41:17] vindicate his plan his purpose his will
[1:41:20] so that this program so that his will
[1:41:23] can can continue and so that our lives
[1:41:26] can move on God doesn't listen God isn't
[1:41:29] the author of confusion you got nothing
[1:41:31] to fear
[1:41:32] God is going to take absolute control of
[1:41:35] the whole situation and everything that
[1:41:38] you have need of God is still going to
[1:41:40] provide it he's going to do everything
[1:41:42] that he needs to do in order to place
[1:41:44] perfect mold and shape and and prepare
[1:41:48] all that needs to be prepared in the
[1:41:50] leadership of this church
[1:41:52] I have no doubt in my mind I have no
[1:41:55] fear about it
[1:41:56] there's no fear attached to this because
[1:41:59] he's always been the leader of the
[1:42:01] church
[1:42:02] when did he change
[1:42:04] when did Christ change being the leader
[1:42:06] of this church
[1:42:07] he's still the leader of the church he's
[1:42:10] still going to feed you he's still going
[1:42:12] to speak to your needs he's still going
[1:42:14] to heal you he's still going to deliver
[1:42:16] you he's still going to prepare you for
[1:42:18] the Rapture he's going to give you
[1:42:20] rapturing Faith regardless of your
[1:42:22] condition he's going to set you free
[1:42:24] liberate you and prepare you for a great
[1:42:27] work
[1:42:29] because even though we go in the rapture
[1:42:32] we got to come back here for another
[1:42:33] Thousand Years
[1:42:36] so he's doing a lot to prepare and get
[1:42:39] us ready
[1:42:40] Hallelujah
[1:42:42] when you get yourself singled out
[1:42:45] from the rest of them making yourself
[1:42:47] just a little different
[1:42:48] you don't want to associate with them
[1:42:51] because they believe this and they don't
[1:42:53] want to associate with that you're
[1:42:55] getting on Dangerous Ground right then
[1:42:57] keeping away from church
[1:43:00] find the one
[1:43:02] find the one of your choice and remain
[1:43:05] there and be a Christian brother to all
[1:43:07] of them
[1:43:08] be a Christian sister to all of them
[1:43:10] that's the way a real Christian
[1:43:14] then we've got Fellowship protection
[1:43:18] people love you and pray for you
[1:43:22] you know that this is your place of
[1:43:25] Refuge

[1:43:29] he's a mighty tower that you can run
[1:43:31] into
[1:43:33] the righteous run into it
[1:43:36] you know that he's a shelter in in the
[1:43:38] time of storm
[1:43:40] and when you when when you decide that
[1:43:42] you don't need that shelter anymore
[1:43:43] you're gonna you're gonna face some
[1:43:45] storms
[1:43:47] and I I don't want to face the storms
[1:43:49] alone
[1:43:50] I already know I'm going to face storms
[1:43:52] so I but I don't want to face them alone
[1:43:54] I don't want to go out there and and and
[1:43:56] and make myself you know put myself to
[1:43:59] the side because I disagree with this or
[1:44:02] I disagree with that I agree with the
[1:44:04] word of God
[1:44:05] I agree that the word of God can deal
[1:44:08] with whatever it is that he needs to
[1:44:10] deal with it's his body it's not my body
[1:44:12] I'm a part of that body
[1:44:14] I'm in there to be strengthened to be
[1:44:16] edified to be healed to be restored and
[1:44:20] to be a blessing to my brothers and
[1:44:21] sisters
[1:44:22] that's that's my purpose that's my goal
[1:44:25] that's why God has placed me into the
[1:44:27] body of Christ
[1:44:29] Hallelujah Christianity is not a
[1:44:31] competition
[1:44:33] it's teamwork
[1:44:34] amen we encourage we don't discourage
[1:44:39] if you got something that you want to
[1:44:41] say to your brother or your sister
[1:44:43] if they're innocent look for something
[1:44:46] that will encourage them out of that
[1:44:48] discouragement
[1:44:50] don't add to the discouragement
[1:44:53] we edify
[1:44:55] we don't crucify
[1:44:58] glory to God
[1:44:59] we gotta watch we gotta watch how we
[1:45:02] talk about one another how we talk about
[1:45:06] our brothers and sisters Even in our
[1:45:09] discussions that we're having any
[1:45:11] discussions that you might be having
[1:45:12] about your deacons or your trustees or
[1:45:15] your pastor or whatever it is you've got
[1:45:17] to be careful
[1:45:19] you've got to be careful you you're
[1:45:21] treading in areas because those are
[1:45:23] God's anointed positions in the body of
[1:45:25] Christ
[1:45:26] we need to be very mindful of those
[1:45:29] things and be fearful of the Lord when
[1:45:32] it comes to those areas because God is a
[1:45:35] jealous God
[1:45:37] is going to protect his word over
[1:45:39] everything else god listen God's looking
[1:45:42] at the pureness of your heart
[1:45:44] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[1:45:47] shall see God you will see God when you
[1:45:50] repent and you sincerely don't want to
[1:45:52] have any malice in you you don't want to
[1:45:54] have anything in you that's going to
[1:45:57] bring any kind of division in the body
[1:45:59] of Christ in any way shape or form God
[1:46:01] is looking at that and when God sees
[1:46:03] that he's going to use you
[1:46:05] he's going to make you a healing bomb in
[1:46:08] the midst of the fellowship he's going
[1:46:09] to make you a healing in the midst of
[1:46:11] the church he's gonna he's gonna cause
[1:46:13] you to be a blessing in the Church of
[1:46:15] God Amen praise God we pull each other
[1:46:18] up not pull each other down amen praise
[1:46:22] God why because we are family
[1:46:25] we are one body in Jesus Christ
[1:46:34] First Corinthians go to the next slide
[1:46:39] 12 21.
[1:46:41] let me have a quick drink
[1:46:43] we're winding it down
[1:46:49] and the eye cannot say unto the hand I
[1:46:51] have no need of Thee
[1:46:53] nor again the head to the feet I have no
[1:46:56] need of you
[1:46:59] I need you
[1:47:01] you need me
[1:47:03] we need one another
[1:47:05] we need to acknowledge that we need to
[1:47:07] say it I need you I need you you need me
[1:47:12] we are the body of Christ we've come
[1:47:14] together for a purpose we're in unity we
[1:47:17] want we we've got the same goal in mind
[1:47:20] we're going into Rapture the purpose we
[1:47:23] come together is to receive rapturing
[1:47:25] Faith so that we can fulfill that
[1:47:27] portion of the word that's the next big
[1:47:29] event Saints
[1:47:32] the world goes into tribulation but we
[1:47:34] get translated into that other dimension
[1:47:37] even science is already starting to poke
[1:47:39] into those other dimensions they realize
[1:47:42] that their realities that they're that
[1:47:43] it's real they're they're playing with
[1:47:46] with all the Witchcraft and they're and
[1:47:48] they're they're seeing it that's why
[1:47:49] they're justifying and saying that we
[1:47:52] know what's going on we understand
[1:47:55] that there are other dimensions we know
[1:47:57] all these things
[1:47:59] astrology all those things they they've
[1:48:02] they've tapped into those things but
[1:48:04] they are all part
[1:48:06] of God's
[1:48:09] plan
[1:48:10] it's all part of God's
[1:48:13] purpose
[1:48:15] his his design everything comes under
[1:48:19] subjection to the plan of God gravity is
[1:48:22] a part of God's plan here on this Earth
[1:48:25] there are certain elements and
[1:48:27] boundaries that this Earth is bound by
[1:48:29] and people are tapping into those things
[1:48:32] but they are making their understanding
[1:48:35] the absolute instead of allowing the
[1:48:37] word of God to be the absolute
[1:48:40] Hallelujah we need one another next
[1:48:43] slide it says you know we should not be
[1:48:46] clannished we got to be careful of that
[1:48:48] because clanish is is not by revelation
[1:48:52] we got to be careful of our of our
[1:48:55] understanding and and and how the body
[1:48:58] works and edifies itself you edify me I
[1:49:02] edify you you have a position in the
[1:49:04] word you have a placing in the body you
[1:49:07] you you you you're an usher in the
[1:49:09] Church of God do it with faith you're a
[1:49:12] deacon do it with faith you're a trustee
[1:49:14] do it by Revelation you're a cleaner do
[1:49:17] it by you're a singer do it by
[1:49:18] Revelation when you're doing those
[1:49:20] things and you're operating by faith it
[1:49:24] just automatically edifies the body of
[1:49:26] Christ
[1:49:27] you look at brother Eugene when he's
[1:49:29] vacuuming you get strengthened from that
[1:49:31] because you know that there's somebody
[1:49:32] there that's doing it by faith when you
[1:49:36] see these things happening around you
[1:49:37] you get edified you get encouraged
[1:49:40] because the body is working now now this
[1:49:43] I say that every one of you saith I am
[1:49:45] of Paul and I have Apollos and I have
[1:49:49] cephas and I have Christ is Christ
[1:49:51] divided
[1:49:53] was Paul crucified for you
[1:49:57] you see you got to be careful that
[1:49:58] you're not putting people in certain
[1:50:01] positions
[1:50:03] and relying on the people
[1:50:05] instead of relying the Holy Ghost in
[1:50:08] that person in that position
[1:50:11] it's going to have to be the spirit of
[1:50:13] God in each and every position in every
[1:50:17] office in the body of Christ in order
[1:50:19] for this body this local Ministry to
[1:50:22] continue to grow
[1:50:24] and to continue to strengthen and be a
[1:50:28] lighthouse in this city of Burlington
[1:50:30] amen we're not looking to a man we're
[1:50:34] looking still to the supernatural spirit
[1:50:37] of God to direct to guide and to lead
[1:50:40] this church amen and John answered and
[1:50:43] said Master we saw one casting out
[1:50:45] devils in thy name and we forbade him
[1:50:48] because he followed not with us and
[1:50:51] Jesus said unto him forbid him not for
[1:50:54] he that is not against us is for us
[1:50:58] so there's the other side of the coin
[1:51:00] you don't have to be worried about being
[1:51:03] clannished you don't have to be worried
[1:51:05] about people that are going to do
[1:51:07] certain things and be Christian in in
[1:51:09] the best possible way that they can
[1:51:12] everybody's got to live by faith
[1:51:14] everybody's got their own Revelation and
[1:51:17] there's no way you can live higher than
[1:51:18] the Revelation that God gives you amen
[1:51:21] Hallelujah glory to God
[1:51:24] we need to be good to one another try to
[1:51:27] be good to one another try to shake
[1:51:29] hands and be friendly and nice
[1:51:34] simple things tear down all the walls of
[1:51:37] partition around you that's malice and
[1:51:40] different ungodly tear it down keep
[1:51:43] doing good to one another
[1:51:45] every time you meet one another make
[1:51:48] yourself be good to one another
[1:51:51] and the first thing you know it'll grow
[1:51:54] around you
[1:51:55] till the bundle of love will wrap you up
[1:51:57] Hallelujah that's the marking of God let
[1:52:02] the musicians come
[1:52:06] we're going to continue this
[1:52:13] I trust that there were some things this
[1:52:15] morning that
[1:52:16] just brought us back to reality
[1:52:21] just bringing us back to reality of of
[1:52:23] Why We Are Who We Are
[1:52:27] why we are a part of this ministry
[1:52:30] we're not trying to make anybody
[1:52:32] anything that they're not
[1:52:34] don't you try to be anybody that you're
[1:52:37] not
[1:52:39] just be yourself
[1:52:42] let grace abound in you let Grace be
[1:52:45] expressed through your life
[1:52:49] overcome the things that constantly try
[1:52:52] to make you
[1:52:53] different indifferent
[1:52:56] try to pull you away try to separate you
[1:52:59] take you off and put you on your own and
[1:53:02] think that you can do it on your own no
[1:53:03] we need one another
