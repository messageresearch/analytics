to lift your ex I wanna end your expectation I had I found that I had more photographs than I thought that I took many many many and it takes a lot of time to actually go through them and take out so this that part of showing you the Israel trip it will have to wait but I do want to speak uh with you and to you tonight on the subject of if there was no Christmas and uh if we are to look into Matthew chapter 2 verses 13 to 15 we may read that together glad to see you here tonight this cold Winter's Night and it's going to get colder uh into next week let's read this together and when they were Departed behold the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt and be thou there until I bring thee word for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him when he arose he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt and was there until the death of Herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying out of Egypt have I called my son praise God let us pray and we'll just talk for a little while and commune with each other and with God our gracious Heavenly Father we are a wonderful blessed people and we acknowledge father your divine presence we are receptacles of your grace I know I I stand here not by chance but I stand Here by the will and plan and purpose of God for somebody somewhere either locally here or across they they wins The Winds of God out there in the internet to hear what's going to be said and father you will bear witness of it you will strike the cords that are necessary you will pull the strings of great one that will speak to us tonight Lord and may the spirit of Christ Lord break the shackles across our hearts and Minds take away weary take away stuffiness take away every devil no praise Spirit no praise devil that will block the minds the hearts the thoughts and the voices of your people father Lift us up father May the Holy Spirit father minister to us everyone and may you receive the glory and the honor of this blessed Christmas Time To Thee be the glory in Jesus name hallelujah praise God please be seated today now uh do you know that Christmas is a wonderful time how many knows that but mainly uh in this modern time Christianity a Satan has made them do that actually has tried his project Christian uh Christmas as a time for children and forgiving gifts to Children you might not have really noticed it but that's how he switched it that people's thoughts should go to the children and loving the children making sure the children have gifts and stuff like that and while doing that is blinding the people to the fact that Christmas is really for adults it's really for uh mature people just like with baptism sometimes a child uh may be too small without understanding they don't know what they're doing before you go baptize them of course some are exceptional where God will reveal to them even while they're tiny like Jesus or even younger amen but the fact is he has switched the price tags and cause people to believe that Christmas is for adults it's for children sorry amen yes but you see really it's for adults to be able to teach their children about what real Christmas is and that's what it is but he's taken them away from that towards giving up Gibson and and focusing on the children and and stuff of that nature which I'm not saying that that is bad I'm just using that to show you how we switch the thoughts and switch the focus on the children and the guests they can receive and be given rather than upon the adults and that they should be teaching their children what real Christmas is but how can they when most of the people in the world today don't really know what really a Christmas is about you see you see now we understand that real Christmas is simply put is the birthday of the s o n of God when God became flesh when God created the body for himself to inhabit when God and morphed himself from Melchizedek to a man when God was able to make that body it was his only begotten son it was the only body that he made like that to fully Express and unveil himself to the human race and so God and Christ amen expressing all the virtues you see behind us letting the world understand what these virtues are all about no none knew what real love was none knew what real brotherly kindness was they didn't know what these things were but Jesus came and expressed them God expressed them through him to the world that they might recognize what was happening amen now we know that Jesus if adults were to teach their children was not born on the 25th of December of course it wasn't even December we were on the hills and the mountains and it was cold but there was no snow but it was cold and they say you'll get snow but you'll get it on the top of Mount Hermon which is one of their highest mountains but other than that there is none of this fictitious stuff that they tell the people the snow lying on the ground and and the angel and the the Shepherds there with their sheep no such a thing that wasn't like that absolutely not and so we know he was not born in December he was not because he was God's lamb and he was to be the Lamb of God to take away the sins of the world and as such we know Lambs are not born in the middle of winter Lambs are usually born in the spring that is to say they are born let me see April May April you know around that time March April May around that time is when Lambs are usually born amen so we know that he was born in that time then we also found that he was not born in a house but he was born in a rotten stinking Barn that had swaddling clothes oh my god when we think of it that we are the born today and once again he is born again in US we who are covered with the filth of sin the corruption of the world and the systems of the world but thank God by his grace he has cleansed their soul he has washed Us in the blood he has brought us back to himself and we are here thanking God for a wonderful real Christmas because we understand and know what it is yes he was not born in a house but he was born in a barn like most Lambs would be and like most Lambs they'll take them to the slaughterhouse and uh I read somewhere brother Branham said usually in the old days they will take a goat to lead that lamb the Lambs or the Sheep to the slaughter but they go usually have a lot of intellectuals so when he gets to the slaughter he leads them in then he runs back out yeah or he says oh he jumps over the wall and leave them in there all to be slaughtered right well even so we see the goat in the Bible Judas brought him and gave him right over to the authorities so that he could be like a lamb's led to slaughter and the Bible says as a lamb he opened not his mouth and you know lambs and sheep even though you're taking them to the slaughterhouse they're not like goats they don't scream and jump and kick and fight them no they're just quietly go to the slaughter amen and like a lamb he was led to the slaughter amen praise God so there he was as one old song says they were walking my Lord up calvary's hill then led him brother to God and there they slayed him it's fresh to me because we were there oh praise God and it's not like the show on a hill where there's no body but it was the the Romans deliberately crucified people at a busy intersection where they want to make that Criminal an example so that others would fear them and what they were doing so that God got this hill is a intersection where even now it is where there are lots of people passing all the time right and they let him up that rugged Hill to die up there amen now we won't go through the entire history but later oh I just heard the music some music play now uh they later we know that Christianity got married it got married into paganism married right into romanism right at the nician council and there we find out that Christians who married who served and worshiped the true and living God got married to romanism we will worship idols they were ranked pagans they were rank worshipers of idols and they worshiped the sun god as I've said before even to this day in their major Cathedrals and places of worship back of the altars is a big circular uh uh sunburst that is uh evidence of the ancient Pagan beliefs mingled mixed and fused into Christianity and brought down through hundreds of years until the present time and they say nothing about it but it's there impacting the people's minds and hearts and they are worshiping you know the devil not knowing what they worship amen yes sir and so we find out this is where they came to the time in the historical records if you want to seek and search to find them really that the Romans before Christianity were worshiping the sun god they were celebrating the birthday of the s-u-n god bowing down to him and worshiping him in every uh way possible and they did that usually from the 21st of December to the 25th of December described by them as the winter solstice and that's the time when they worship the sun god because after the 25th the the length of days begin to change because the sun is coming back and uh and they look at that like their God uh died in the winter and is resurrecting now and so they worship Him and they have a great time of rejoicing rejoicing amen now when this time came for the worship the Christians now who were there at the time now I remember I tell you that the two got fused together until you kept hardly let's say they fuse together they marry together whatever term but the the uh implication is that you can't hardly discern the difference between because it's got so mixed in and mixed up to this very day right to this very day and while the Christians were worshiping God they s o n of God and given glory to his name the Romans were worshiping the s-u-n of God on the same day and the same time amen now while there were one worship by having a Roman bacchanal and that is a real word that is not something made up by somebody you can look in any one of the dictionaries or as like a pictures that will bring up the word and tell you you say well brother Simon they will have in the back and all what you mean it means at the time when they are worshiping this God they were having a moon riotous drunken uh a party Anything Goes everything it was just a rotten mess that they were having together there at that time and contrary to them the Christians there were worshiping the s o n of God and it was a sacred time for them there were worshiping and giving glory to God while the other side was worshiping the Sun God and using Bacchus wine women music singing Harps flutes everything else jumping around pulling at each other's clothing falling drunk all night together mingled together or it was just one rotten mess and that's what was there so-called Christmas or worship of their s-u-m God but the Christians were worshiping the Son of God and for them Christmas was a sacred time Christmas was a time of Thanksgiving to God because they knew what he did for them blessed be the name of the Lord God hallelujah oh my friends right now while I'm speaking on this subject the whole world is in preparation they don't know that that's what it is but it's an another Roman back and all that has now gone worldwide Universal it's no more just in one little area but it's now all over the world that their uh view of what Christmas is has dominated the hearts and minds of the people oh my and what can we look out there without Christ without god without his knowledge what nominal Christianity with all of that all it is is a swill a pig swell of wine women sung and all manner of corruption on every hand from Office parties write down my friends it's there everywhere but in the middle of that we are asked to hold to God's unchanging hands we are asked to hold for our original faith Faith of Our Father's living still in spite of dungeon fire and sword they can't take it out of us they can't boil it out of us they can't burn it out of us we will not Bend we will not bow we will not burn but we'll stand for Jesus Christ by the word of God hallelujah amen yes sir praise God I tell you while the world is preparing for this back and all that they call Christmas amen right now I want to tell you that to us real the real Christmas is not a pagan celebration the real Christmas is not a pagan celebration to us it's a sacred time it's a sacred hour yes we eat we drink we Rejoice but our reason for that is totally opposite to what they're doing absolutely totally different praise the Lord because we ought to be glad that Jesus was born we have to be glad that he came for us praise God hallelujah oh my so we worshiped him at Christmas time with thankfulness in our hearts and taking it as a sacred hour because if there was no Christmas just think of it if there was no real Christmas of Christ on this face of this Earth it will be one great big Devil's back and all going on that's why Jesus said you are the salt of the earth you are the ones that calling back the words of sin when he that let it will let you know the Greeks as when he who is now here in the ring stops in the ring then we are taken out of the way then will the man of sin be revealed then the evil will come right open and expose and manifest to the people amen yes sir but if there was no Christmas no sacrificial lamb named Jesus could have been born but thank God there is real Christmas where Jesus Christ the sacrificial lamb was able to be born Jesus Christ The Substitute lamb now they right now in Israel they're looking for the red heifer as you find in uh Exodus and Deuteronomy and those books you will find there looking for the coming of the red heifer so they can have their sacrifice but we have received our substitute already and his name is Jesus Christ Hallelujah he took my place at Calvary he took your place at Calvary and when he was on the cross we were on his mind oh praise God hallelujah I'm so thankful here today tonight while I'm speaking with you amen if he was not born then we would have no sacrificial lamb also we would have never known what is Grace we would not know anything about Grace because the age of Grace only came in when he came and died then Grace began Hallelujah that is to receive a gift that is unmerited you're not you you want something you did to receive it it's not money you're paying to get it but there's a gift that was given to you amen and I thank God the gift he gave to us is the seed of life with the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord that's the gift that we have all received all praise God forevermore glory to God we will never known what is Grace Hallelujah even to this day many people don't know what is Grace you try to give them something why are you giving me what's the reason for that and they're getting because they don't know what Grace is that somebody can give something without a motive of getting back anything you just give it from the fullness of your heart and he did it because he loved us and gave his life for us praise God we would not if there was no real Christmas we would not know what is love what is redeeming love we would have no idea of it there was no such a thing before Jesus came on the earth it was just killing lambs and Rams and Bullocks and goats and burning up words and and stuff of that nature oh my but he the word came on the scene and made sense of all of it praise God and presented himself and died for our sins and let us know what the love of God is amen who praise God if there is was no Christmas if there was no lamb born there would be no Calvary there would be no man that could go with such perfection without spot without blemish to climb doubt God God is healed to die for our sins and to take on the accumulation of the sins of the world but the Bible says he took our sins upon us and he became poor that we might become rich oh praise God I'm so thankful in my heart today amen I give him glory every day of life without this real Christmas there could be no crucifixion because there will be nothing to crucify but thank God there's a real Chris Christmas whenever you know that you see a false or a counterfeit there's a real somewhere amen and there's a real Christmas that one that they are celebrating out there is it's the intention of the master Puppeteer behind all of that is the blind to distract and delude the people away from the reality of the word of God and the power of the holy spirit amen to save them from their sins glory be to God Amen oh my imaginal world with no real Christmas amen no real Christmas having no hope of peace on Earth and Good Will towards man you say well what are you talking about we don't have peace on Earth now and we don't have a good will towards men but the Bible tells us that one day when all whether Brandon made it plain he says every one of the isms are going to pass whether this socialism fascism whatever they're all gonna pass away and die even capitalism will pass amen he said they'll try every form of government from this to that to the other and it'll pass away and everyone he said will fail amen but Jesus is coming the Prince of Peace is coming he is the is the only one can bring peace on the face of the earth oh blessed be the name of the Lord just the other night I gave you the quotation where the Prophet said the reason why we are having all this destruction on the Earth all of this murder killing War he said because the destroying Angel is now loosed and he is inspiring these men to make these weapons a war and to use them to be able to kill not one not two not ten not a hundred not a thousand millions of people being killed like that because the destroying Angel but the Prince of Peace is coming Hallelujah and he has to say peace be still amen and calm the storms of life and everything will come back into his will for the Bible said he'll rule with a rod of iron amen have complete control but now it's a king with love it's a king with not corruption a king with love with honesty with every quality and character that you think a leader and a king should have amen praise God and that's what we are looking for and we have this hope in us that we will have the peace of God in our hearts and in our lives I took that tonight amen oh my if there was no Christmas there would be no hereafter we will all die and stay right here and that would be the end because there would be no none to save us out of Satan's prison but thank God one came and went down into Satan's pits and preached to the spirits that were imprisoned there amen and uh loose them freed them out of there praise God and I'm glad he freed me out of the systems all the iron bars of the beliefs you had in your mind contrary to the word of God the spirit of Christ by the word tore them away amen I'm glad we have a Samson today nothing can stand before him he said there in my hand and none can take them out of the palm of my head and you'll tear that roaring lion apart just like he did back there he'll tear the devil into pieces to bring out his bride bring out his children in the freedom the liberty of the Sons and Daughters of the Living God hallelujah amen so we have faith Paul said if the if Christ did not die if he didn't die for our sins then we are of men or most miserable we got nothing to stand on we got no heaven we got no hope we got nothing but thank God he he was born thank God he left that God he died thank God he rose again thank God we have hope we have faith in him amen glory to God hallelujah there was no Christian no Christmas friends we would have no rapture there would be no Rapture for us to look forward to amen but thank God there is a genuine Christmas that we could teach our children about that because our faith in God and in God's word amen hallelujah praise God we have a hope in heaven now because he came for us glory to God I'm glad for it that we have a hope we have a home in heaven of praise God hallelujah we are not just wandering spirits but before the absence from the body we're present with the Lord hallelujah and our home is in the presence of your Mighty God Amen thank be to God for Christmas Hallelujah you know everywhere you go at this particular time what do you see Christmas lights have you seen them they're everywhere you can't miss them they're light to lit up everywhere and everything else like that thank God but they don't know just by putting up the Christmas lights they are proving without us preaching that uh there can be light in the midst of Darkness amen hallelujah oh praise God so we know that in this dark cloudy uh and black and cloudy day in which we are living while the Thunder is rolling now amen suddenly in the midst of it when there's the devil thinks he has control the lightning cracks amen praise God the Revelation strikes the heart of the Church of the Living God the Believers see the word the light shines for them to see their way and they recognize their day and their hour amen glory to God and it proves to us that no matter how strong and black the devil tries to make the wickedness and the corruption that's in the world like in Egypt so sick you can't see that God in the middle of that can still say but there shall be light in the evening time amen when he can say Watchmen what of the night morning is coming morning is coming light is coming the sun is rising up amen and it's coming here for every single one of us praise God hallelujah I'm so thankful friends that we can have God's light in the midst of the darkness amen glory to God hallelujah now it doesn't matter which light you have if you turn it on in the daytime especially when it's a real bright sunny day and the sun is shining those lights they're lights but they come to nothing they can't stand in the presence of the light of the sun amen praise God and I'm glad that there's no body no Theologian no church no religious order can give you any light on the word or about God more than God can give himself amen for he sent the son to do that Amen to shine his light upon the word and he said I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness praise God hallelujah amen oh praise God I'm preaching here but I'm still thinking that I wonder what you guys you brothers and sisters think of me getting all excited like this but oh if I if you could see what I am seeing and what I am experiencing as I look into the word of God brother sister you would be like brother Brandon wanting to run run the church and run around the tree and shout and scream your head off and we have to take you to the institution them guys with the white coats will have to take you there amen praise God hallelujah I want to give praise to God hallelujah now thank God we've come out of this last Church age how many knows that amen a wind does light shine the brightest in the darkest hour is when light and that is why we were predestinated for this hour that we might be bright shining lights in the midst of the darkness Hallelujah and the light doesn't have to work up itself you do you hear the the lights working up themselves you hear a big noise and everything else it just shines is that right oh my I'm remembering an old story where the wind and the sun were challenged to to make some uh a traveler take off his coat and the the wind said oh no that's nothing to that I can do that and you know he blew and he hopped and he puffed and the guy just grabbed the skull tighter and if you hear the whirling of the wind and the howling and everything else and the man hold his coat tighter and then he moved aside because he knew he failed the sun didn't see anything he just came out and started to shine and got warmer I'm warm on warmer and the man took off his coat of his own self right and the son did not that not with a lot of noise and caring on but with the Quiet heat of the fire of God that is in US does the same thing through you and through me for the glory of God that the people cast off all their you you when you read of bartim yes lots of people don't know but it ends by saying and he threw away his garments the beggar clothes that he used to wear he threw them away oh praise God I'm glad I already threw away mine I hope you've thrown away yours and you're not holding on to some of them to use them again in case something happens in your life no there's nothing but the blood of Jesus Christ to wash your white or snow and make you who he wants you to be amen praise God I tell you friends or a one tiny light even as we say you know in the Old Country there is dragonflies amen and the night will be dark but you will see hundreds of them they're they're Tiny But when you see they're glowing like that that light can be seen everywhere and God wants you to know no that little light of yours just let it shine whatever light you have Let It Shine when the light of God begins to shine through you you can be a blessing Hallelujah because like the prophet said you don't have no light in your own but you reflect the light coming off regards himself and it shines through you the vessels that you prepared for this hour to shine upon a dark and dismal age in which we are living in amen praise God let's shine bright as we can will you let's shine as bright as we can I don't mean let's show off but let's just live and shine as brightly as we can you know real Christianity don't you don't really have to go around uh telling people this and shouting that not that you are not to tell them but I'm saying you that you don't go around like that your life becomes the voice of God to the age in which you live and it begins to speak amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen and I believe right now it's a time where every Christian man woman children young people whoever they are should give testimony to Jesus Christ and what he has done for us amen praise God Amen Hallelujah yes sir praise God so we are here to give testimony but we are not here to give testimony of some fictitious tree that was in the forest long ago and then it suddenly light up and and as it became known as the Evergreen tree because it's it's light up through the darkness of the winter some kind of fictitious nonsense as that that you we are following we are not testifying about that amen we are not here to testify about all kinds of pagan fictitious beliefs and stories that have no truth in them nothing but a bottomless pit of Lies but the base our faith upon the unshakable word of God hallelujah amen We Believe simp into the simple promised word of God Amen all of it but particularly Fargo promised word for this hour that we are living in we recognize all the other days and we give God glory for that but we are here now this is our day and we are living in it right now amen praise God hallelujah amen we believe the promised word well that's a general statement but promised word of the promise of a messiah just like they were promised back there Messiah is coming and they were looking for him and you know how he was born came through Mary came on the earth preached the word of God until this day because their eyes were blinded they're still looking for messiah and the Messiah has already come amen when he comes again second time strikes Mount Zion reveals himself to them where you got the wounds in the house of my friends I got it from you who claim to be my brothers and sisters and so on like that and the Bible says then there will weep as a nation but friends we believe solidly on the promise of the word of God for a promise Messiah that they received and missed out on them we recognize the Messiah word for this hour and we receive him within the Cradle of our hearts praise God forevermore that he can live in us hallelujah amen we recognize that he the word that died for their sins back there has been crucified again the word crucified in another Resurrection in our day and in our time hallelujah oh praise God word of God the birth of the word six to five the Holy Spirit making him known to us amen the the great systems of romanism and the systems of man with despairs from their puppets begin to stab at the word until they try to destroy it and kill it they thought it was dead with the passing of the Prophet but up from the grave he arose Hallelujah will triumph over his foes because he lives in us and instead of having one man named Jesus now you got millions of Believers that stand upon God's unchanging word hallelujah amen thank God that he would die for the sins of the world Amen praise God and he died friends and let me say this he didn't die to give us Christmas gifts in the red stocking is that right but he did give us a Christmas gift and that gift is the gift of eternal life we recognize that as the gene or the seed that God predestinated every true elected believer the gift that he placed in you amen he doesn't give you that in a red stockin but he gives you covered with the red blood of Christ that was shed for our sins to set us everyone free your glory be to God hallelujah amen and he didn't have that stocking hanging on a on a tree for you to go and collect your gifts but they'll hung him on a cross the prophet said he was the Tree of Life praise God and from him we receive the gift of life within our own hearts and we are thankful to our god giving him praise giving him honor and glory amen hallelujah amen this great gift of eternal life staying with the Crimson blood of his of his that of his uh sacrifice that he gave for us amen thanks be to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah so if there was no Christmas there would be no savior and we thank God that there's a real genuine Christmas oh my may God help each one of you here tonight listening as I bring the word to understand the cunning slate of hand of Satan and how he's mingled and mixed the thing together until saying things like this say what are you really talking about we are happy that Jesus died but it's no Revelation back of that it's saying I Repent of my sins you don't even know what repenting is I got saved you don't know okay you got saved safe from what I got saved for my sins Watson smoking drinking you don't understand gone right back to the root to know unbelief amen and all those things are just fruits coming off of it amen and I'm winding this up now so don't get nervous on me praise the Lord hallelujah yes sir if there'd be no Christmas there would be no savior but I thank God we have a savior praise God Jesus Is Our Savior a redeemer and our soon coming King praise God and I'm glad he was born in the hills and mountains of Judea amen and we was born in Bethlehem praise the Lord and that's so fresh that he was born there and that says in the Book of Psalms this man it shall be said this man was born there oh my thanks be to God he was born there but two thousand years ago but thanks be to God we can see him alive once more in our midst rejected he was despised and then as you know they killed him but the grave could not hold him it could not hold him and now he's coming again to have with us the real Christmas celebration and that celebration is going to be in our home beyond the skies oh praise God hallelujah and if the right use this thought at Christmas time is a time where of uniting family and friends and Neighbors I've known where neighbors have been at the you know fighting all year and when it comes down to Christmas time there is just a spirit of atmosphere that comes that causes people to want to make up to make things right uh to confess me wrong um to give in right like that to bring about some kind of unity and you know Christmas time is a time when families no matter how far they're scattered across the world right now the airlines are overburdened with Travelers and as Christmas Day becomes closer they won't be able to carry all those people because people wanting to get back with their family and to your night together and to Rejoice together because it's Christmas time going on like that but you see they have that feeling because it was God's family that was scattered it was God's genes that were scattered through the times and the ages amen and the Nations that scattered through every time and age coming down from the beginning to now amen and you have to gather them in each Church age we are now in this church age when the whole thing is about to be winding up ready for the scattered children to start having that feeling that desire to travel back home to come back together come in unity and walk in the word of the Living God hallelujah amen praise God look people right now are trying to get back home with their natural family and then don't care what the cost they have to pay they don't care what price they have to pay they don't care what distance they have to go they don't care about the trials they have to go through they don't care about the patience and waiting for to get an explained they don't care about that they want to get home to celebrate Christmas with their family and thanks be to God we want to celebrate the real Christmas when together we are united together and won by Jesus Christ and our desire to our Rapture to be in the presence of the Living God may God bless every one of us here tonight and come send to your feet unless come let us adore him Christ the Lord amen if the musicians will come you know that him it's one that has been sung before for centuries and we want to sing it again giving praise honor and glory to God but as Paul said let us not sing as those that are ignorant but sing with understanding so you're singing the song but you're watching those words you're taking it in you're seeing what the writer saw when he wrote the song and you give him glory to God hallelujah come let us adore let's adore him oh come let us [Applause] [Music] I love him in words the Lord will give him all the glory it's Christmas amen [Music] Christ the Lord God bless you come brother praise the Lord God bless every one of you know that we won't see each other again until the end of the year praise God and between now and then I'll be with my own family you will be with yours and let us together Rejoice at Christmas time give and praise honor and glory to God and in your hearts be able to separate the two because while they're going one way imbibing all kinds of wicked spirits uh we are on the other side imbibing and taking in the spirit of God and giving glory to his name God bless you take care Merry Christmas to you all [Music] I know you have the checks for me right [Music] for the grace of God where would I be today
