[41:01] hallelujah
[41:02] i will not step down as i usually do
[41:05] you know
[41:06] precautions of the times as such but i
[41:10] certainly will pray god's blessing
[41:13] upon both of you
[41:15] and upon the child praise god that god
[41:18] bless her richly in a wonderful way
[41:23] of course
[41:25] the scripture says in psalms 103
[41:30] the mercy of the lord
[41:33] is from everlasting to everlasting
[41:37] upon them
[41:38] that fear him
[41:40] and his righteousness
[41:43] onto children's children
[41:46] to such as keep his commandment
[41:50] and to those that remember
[41:53] his commandments
[41:55] to go do them
[41:58] thus saith the lord
[42:00] suffer the little children to come on to
[42:03] me
[42:05] and forbid them not
[42:08] for of such
[42:10] is the kingdom of god
[42:14] and he took them up in his arms
[42:17] put his hands upon them and bless them
[42:21] praise god now of course you know that
[42:24] in
[42:25] presenting your child to the lord for
[42:28] dedication by this you are confessing
[42:32] your faith
[42:34] your action
[42:36] speaks of your faith in god and that he
[42:40] will
[42:41] bless you for you are here
[42:44] asking for his blessing upon this child
[42:48] praise god
[42:50] and
[42:51] i as a minister acknowledge
[42:54] that you are doing this
[42:56] and not as a duty
[42:59] but you're doing this because of the
[43:01] faith that is within your heart that
[43:03] this is something you should do
[43:06] and that god will respond
[43:08] by
[43:09] blessing
[43:10] you and the child praise the lord
[43:14] now i i know
[43:16] that you are both uh believers
[43:20] you are both
[43:21] people of faith
[43:23] uh people who serve the lord in
[43:25] sincerity
[43:26] and we give god glory for that amen
[43:30] now of course as much as this
[43:32] responsibility
[43:34] has carried is carried out by these
[43:36] parents as they're doing now
[43:41] it is also
[43:43] shared by us as a community of faith
[43:48] for as the old proverb says it takes a
[43:52] whole village
[43:53] to raise a child
[43:56] i know they got modern laws from dr
[43:59] spock and many others
[44:03] but in the old days anybody in the
[44:05] village can give you a whipping
[44:09] and if they go and tell your parents
[44:11] afterwards you'll get a second dose
[44:14] [Music]
[44:16] so you do everything in your behavior to
[44:18] avoid the first one so you don't get the
[44:21] second one
[44:23] we are thankful
[44:25] that there are parents here
[44:28] that recognize the importance
[44:31] not only of their duty and their work
[44:33] and their faith
[44:35] but to be surrounded by a security
[44:39] blanket
[44:40] of a community of faith
[44:43] that will encourage them
[44:46] strengthen them
[44:48] and
[44:48] surround them with the warmth of love
[44:52] and the grace of almighty god
[44:57] of course
[44:58] [Music]
[45:00] i i can say to you will you train up
[45:03] this child but i would say that
[45:06] because i believe what uh you have
[45:09] learned from the scriptures
[45:11] will inspire you to
[45:13] raise this child in the knowledge and in
[45:16] the fear
[45:17] of the lord
[45:19] hallelujah
[45:20] let us all rise at this time for a
[45:22] prayer of dedication for this child
[45:28] it's okay
[45:31] praise god that's okay let her cry is
[45:33] better she crying here than anywhere
[45:35] outside is that right praise god
[45:39] our gracious and eternal god
[45:42] we offer this child in dedication to you
[45:47] as samuel was offered by hannah his
[45:50] mother
[45:51] [Music]
[45:52] in service and in dedication to your
[45:55] divine will
[45:56] [Music]
[45:57] we thank you that they have come now
[46:01] you have given them this child
[46:03] and now they are here to give this child
[46:06] back to you
[46:08] its life in service
[46:10] and its walk
[46:12] in this world that we are living in
[46:16] we pray that you will accept this our

[48:09] the
[48:10] the singers and the musicians of the
[48:13] tribe of judah
[48:15] always went before the armies of the
[48:18] lord they sang they played and it
[48:21] encouraged the hearts of the of the
[48:24] warriors to go out and all
[48:27] all the armies know that that's why they
[48:29] have the drum room
[48:32] it's to stir up the heart of the
[48:35] warriors as they go to war praise the
[48:38] lord well we are christian soldiers
[48:41] isn't that right
[48:42] and we are gathered here to give glory
[48:44] to god
[48:45] but satan won't just allow you to do
[48:47] that just because you're in a building
[48:49] called the church
[48:51] he'll still speak to your mind and he'll
[48:53] suggest things he'll give you makes you
[48:56] distract you obstruct you undermine you
[48:59] whatever but
[49:01] let's go into this spiritual warfare
[49:05] of preaching the word of god
[49:07] and you encourage me and i will
[49:08] encourage you
[49:10] amen praise the name of the lord
[49:12] hallelujah
[49:14] let us look to the psalm chapter 61
[49:19] reading verses 2 and 3.
[49:36] and it reads thus
[49:40] from the end of the earth
[49:43] will i cry unto thee
[49:46] when my heart is overwhelmed
[49:49] lead me to the rock
[49:51] that is higher than i
[49:54] for thou has been a shelter for me and a
[49:58] strong tower from the enemy
[50:01] thank god hallelujah
[50:04] father thank you for the reading of your
[50:06] word bless us together for we ask it in
[50:08] jesus name amen
[50:11] i'm speaking on the subject of
[50:14] one octave higher
[50:17] one octave higher
[50:21] now
[50:22] david with his sheep
[50:25] on the mountain hillsides
[50:29] in israel at that time
[50:32] and you know
[50:33] when you are in the mountains like that
[50:37] and
[50:38] whatever you're doing storms can
[50:40] suddenly come up
[50:42] uh you'll suddenly be standing there and
[50:45] the mountain is so high you can't see
[50:48] the storm coming from miles away
[50:50] so all of a sudden you'll see the black
[50:52] clouds and the winds and storms will
[50:55] come on you suddenly
[50:57] and then
[50:59] uh
[51:00] flash floods is called water will just
[51:03] come
[51:04] in a hurry and sweep you away if you
[51:08] don't get to higher ground on time
[51:13] so with some of that in the back of his
[51:15] mind and his whole flock being swept
[51:18] away
[51:20] david is saying to the lord
[51:22] lord god
[51:24] i know in this natural life that we're
[51:27] living
[51:28] not only will the sheep have storms come
[51:31] in their life and flash floods
[51:34] but every one of us will also suffer
[51:38] storms of life
[51:40] we will suffer from the flash floods of
[51:42] life
[51:43] that will seek to overwhelm us
[51:47] and drown us in the cares of this human
[51:50] life so he's saying lord whenever that
[51:53] happens i can't depend on myself i can't
[51:57] depend on my strength lead me to the
[52:00] rock
[52:01] that is higher than i
[52:03] o praise god i'm thankful
[52:07] that we have a rock and that rock is a
[52:10] rock of ages
[52:12] i'm thankful
[52:14] that
[52:14] that word when it's used in some saying
[52:18] rock it's almost saying lead me to your
[52:21] fortress
[52:22] lead me to your place of defense where
[52:26] you can defend me where it can be behind
[52:29] the walls of your word that i can be
[52:32] protected by your grace and by your holy
[52:36] spirit hallelujah now you remember lot
[52:41] when a lot was done in the plains of
[52:44] sodom and the two angels came to him and
[52:49] say flee run lot
[52:52] run for the mountains run to the top for
[52:56] we can't bring judgment on this place
[52:59] until you are out of here amen god is
[53:02] saying to us the same thing come out of
[53:05] the world
[53:06] come out of your works
[53:08] come out all of these human things and
[53:11] climb into another dimension a little
[53:14] higher where the grace of god can
[53:17] encircle you
[53:18] where the spirit of god can embrace you
[53:21] with his divine love and grace and you
[53:24] feel the warmth as you are there in
[53:27] abraham's bosom spiritually speaking
[53:30] amen so
[53:32] he had to flee to the top of the
[53:35] mountains hallelujah now i know and i
[53:39] believe you are
[53:40] aware that storms are even right now
[53:44] striking the coasts of florida storms
[53:48] are striking uh parts of the united
[53:50] states
[53:52] and uh stories have been told that some
[53:55] people have been so overwhelmed with
[53:58] water
[53:59] that they had to climb to the top of
[54:01] their houses
[54:02] they had to climb to the top of their
[54:05] houses because you know they have to get
[54:07] away from the snakes
[54:10] they had to get away from the gators
[54:13] that they won't get them and they went
[54:16] to the top
[54:17] of their very houses
[54:20] i want you to know that that's where we
[54:23] have to go
[54:24] is the top of the mountain that god has
[54:27] provided for us
[54:30] now i want to make a slight uh
[54:33] change here to bring this out a little
[54:36] clearer to you
[54:38] now how many of you know uh somewhat
[54:40] about music
[54:42] let me see your hands i just want to
[54:44] know i got some support here
[54:46] are you scared of putting your hands up
[54:48] like that what kind of stuff this queen
[54:51] elizabeth isn't here with this
[54:54] no raise your hand up like a real west
[54:57] indian like a real canadian and tell me
[55:00] there you you know something about music
[55:02] okay
[55:03] well
[55:05] god is a music composer how many knows
[55:07] that
[55:09] god is a music director do you know that
[55:12] certainly he is and
[55:15] god has created and given to the world
[55:18] some are the most beautiful music that
[55:21] you can ever conceive of
[55:25] and he has inspired that music through a
[55:27] lot of
[55:29] of creative men
[55:31] uh mendel's many many others let me not
[55:34] go into names but the fact is
[55:37] that even the hallelujah chorus do you
[55:39] know that he actually had a vision of
[55:41] seeing the angel singing it in heaven
[55:45] and all he did was when he come to
[55:47] himself is copied off the same scores
[55:49] and copied off the same things they were
[55:52] doing and singing there that is why that
[55:55] song can never leave human consciousness
[55:59] because it's not just an ordinary song
[56:01] he actually got it from the very
[56:03] presence of god
[56:05] and there are many others that were
[56:08] inspired
[56:09] like that in every way
[56:12] but there's a higher form of music
[56:15] and scientists will tell you that that
[56:17] music carries healing
[56:20] it will calm you down
[56:22] that's the music of creation
[56:26] you just go in the woods
[56:28] or laying some part that we may have
[56:31] just listen to the birds singing
[56:34] just listen to the
[56:36] the
[56:37] gentle
[56:38] walks of the breeze
[56:40] going through and rustling in the leaves
[56:43] of the trees
[56:44] and that's the music of nature that we
[56:48] cannot duplicate
[56:50] and uh we can only lay back and allow
[56:54] ourselves to be healed by it
[56:57] to have recovery from it
[57:00] because of this music
[57:03] but there's another higher form of music
[57:07] and scientists call it the music of the
[57:10] spheres
[57:11] they said you know
[57:13] there's a music that's being played
[57:16] but we can't hear it with the natural
[57:19] ear
[57:20] and it's the music formed by the harmony
[57:23] of all these planets constantly whirling
[57:28] we know they're in harmony because they
[57:30] don't miss one second or one nanosecond
[57:34] of time they don't miss they're in
[57:37] perfect harmony and symmetry and while
[57:39] they're moving like that we know they're
[57:42] making some kind of music but our ears
[57:45] can't hear it
[57:46] and they call it the music of the
[57:49] spheres
[57:50] oh my
[57:52] great
[57:53] musicians you'll see where i'm going
[57:55] from here
[57:58] have spoken of the lost cord
[58:02] and the lost cord as they describe it
[58:06] is music that they know is
[58:11] they can feel it
[58:13] they can sense it but it's just beyond
[58:15] the realm of human senses
[58:18] just beyond
[58:20] it's almost like you trying to recall a
[58:22] thought and you can literally almost
[58:25] taste it
[58:26] you can almost see it
[58:28] you know it's there but but you don't
[58:31] know how to express it and they call
[58:33] that the lost cord
[58:37] now i want you to know that god who is
[58:40] the greatest composer of all time
[58:44] has given us a signal because you know
[58:48] directors of music how they do when
[58:50] they're directing the music and they
[58:53] have their wand in their hand when they
[58:55] wanted to go up the nil
[58:58] they'll tell you it's got to lift it's
[58:59] got to go up a little higher
[59:02] you got to come up higher
[59:04] is that right chris
[59:07] amen
[59:08] see
[59:09] so
[59:09] he's calling on his musicians and his
[59:13] singers
[59:14] to go into a higher octave
[59:18] he wants them to lift that music
[59:21] lift that message that they have
[59:23] received
[59:24] lift it up into another octave higher
[59:28] all right see now we know that under the
[59:32] force polls
[59:34] the first
[59:36] uh
[59:37] polls of the gospel
[59:39] or climaxes
[59:41] or if you want to say it crescendos
[59:45] in the message
[59:46] right
[59:47] the in this marvelous music of the
[59:50] message of the hour that we have been
[59:52] enjoying
[59:54] the grace of god
[59:56] we have received a signal from god
[1:00:00] himself
[1:00:01] i want the music to go into another
[1:00:05] octave higher
[1:00:08] and that's what i'm talking about one
[1:00:10] octave
[1:00:12] higher thank god
[1:00:14] the music
[1:00:16] the message that we have received before
[1:00:19] under the first two poles were beautiful
[1:00:22] how many can say that
[1:00:24] beautiful none can touch it the beauty
[1:00:28] of that
[1:00:29] was always so beautiful amen and we were
[1:00:34] always wondering can this message go any
[1:00:37] higher
[1:00:39] can this word go any higher and we
[1:00:43] always wondered that hallelujah but i
[1:00:46] want you to know
[1:00:48] the composer has given his signal for it
[1:00:52] to go
[1:00:53] higher
[1:00:54] and one time
[1:00:57] while
[1:00:58] brother william branham was speaking
[1:01:03] quoting
[1:01:05] not knowing of course being spiritual
[1:01:08] you watch spiritual things
[1:01:11] and god knows it
[1:01:13] but if you'll turn and look up the clock
[1:01:16] it's on the dot of two o'clock
[1:01:20] the end of the second pull
[1:01:23] the third pull
[1:01:25] is at hand
[1:01:27] did you notice
[1:01:29] it went into that
[1:01:31] other octave
[1:01:34] did you notice
[1:01:35] the holy spirit took the same song
[1:01:39] and picking it up
[1:01:42] and taking it up to the higher
[1:01:46] octave see
[1:01:48] that next ball
[1:01:50] is now at hand so not another song
[1:01:55] not a new message
[1:01:58] not anything new
[1:02:00] but taking the same song
[1:02:03] the same word the same bible that we
[1:02:07] have
[1:02:08] but taking it higher
[1:02:10] to her level
[1:02:12] other than just
[1:02:13] the common bible study the common uh
[1:02:16] hermeneutics apologetics whatever you
[1:02:19] want to call it amen praise god my
[1:02:22] friends this gospel has gone to another
[1:02:25] dimension
[1:02:28] it's the mention beyond human
[1:02:30] intellectuals
[1:02:32] it's beyond human intellectuals is now
[1:02:36] given by god by supernatural revelation
[1:02:41] for this gospel we have received
[1:02:44] the bible tells us clearly
[1:02:46] it was holy men of god wrote
[1:02:49] as they were inspired by the holy ghost
[1:02:53] now
[1:02:54] if there were inspired to write
[1:02:57] that same holy spirit
[1:02:59] if we are going to have a clear
[1:03:01] understanding
[1:03:03] must also come back and inspire us to
[1:03:06] hear
[1:03:08] to receive
[1:03:09] and those that speak to be inspired to
[1:03:12] speak the word
[1:03:14] on the divine direction
[1:03:16] divine inspiration
[1:03:19] not my will not your will not what i
[1:03:21] compose or i i just put together
[1:03:24] something here and come tell you but to
[1:03:26] be inspired by the living god
[1:03:28] anointed by the holy ghost
[1:03:31] to see exactly what god once said
[1:03:35] listen while i'm speaking here god is
[1:03:37] going to go beyond what even i am saying
[1:03:41] i'm only here to demonstrate the holy
[1:03:44] spirit
[1:03:45] that he lives
[1:03:47] he's not dead but he's alive he's a
[1:03:50] living god and he lives in me
[1:03:53] he lives in you
[1:03:55] if you believe all things are possible
[1:03:58] to them that will believe the word of
[1:04:00] god
[1:04:01] amen hallelujah
[1:04:04] oh my yes sir the message
[1:04:08] goes into a
[1:04:09] one octave
[1:04:11] higher
[1:04:13] hallelujah
[1:04:14] now musicians know this i'm a neophyte
[1:04:18] but i think there are eight uh tones
[1:04:22] uh to music
[1:04:23] and i think every child almost know the
[1:04:26] remy facility and it ends up back to the
[1:04:28] original dough
[1:04:30] it starts with do and it ends up back
[1:04:33] with dough
[1:04:35] right you're back to the original again
[1:04:38] like that
[1:04:39] and uh when you look to an october
[1:04:42] octagon or something with eight sides uh
[1:04:44] you know and that's we have to
[1:04:46] understand that we have come through the
[1:04:49] seven church ages as illustrated there
[1:04:52] and we have gone right
[1:04:54] back
[1:04:55] after the seven church ages
[1:04:57] we go back originally where we come from
[1:05:02] we originally go back to what we call
[1:05:04] the day well there is no it day the it
[1:05:08] there really speaks of going back to the
[1:05:11] first day
[1:05:13] and that's what we are here talking
[1:05:15] about going back to original uncommon
[1:05:18] contaminated unconfused
[1:05:21] by all these doctrines by all these
[1:05:23] so-called wise teachings of wise men and
[1:05:26] they're good men they're wise men but
[1:05:28] we're not looking for that we're looking
[1:05:30] for the original word of god on the
[1:05:33] inspiration of the holy spirit strike
[1:05:35] your soul hallelujah the lightning of
[1:05:38] god's word and the thunder of the spirit
[1:05:40] of god speaking into your hearts amen
[1:05:44] bringing forth life
[1:05:46] life light power for his glory and for
[1:05:50] his honor oh praise god amen oh
[1:05:55] i repeat it again
[1:05:56] but for god to be received the glory
[1:05:59] preached in the nation of guyana
[1:06:03] left five churches behind
[1:06:06] i went back came back just a week ago
[1:06:09] and found there are now 36 churches that
[1:06:13] are functioning for the glory of god and
[1:06:15] growing every day why
[1:06:18] the word still has its power
[1:06:22] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:06:25] forever
[1:06:26] praise be to god hallelujah amen yes sir
[1:06:31] so
[1:06:32] the same message
[1:06:34] that we have always been hearing
[1:06:38] the holy spirit is letting us know
[1:06:41] that the message itself is being
[1:06:43] quickened
[1:06:45] by the holy spirit and taken to a higher
[1:06:48] realm
[1:06:49] taken to a higher dimension praise god
[1:06:53] one octave higher
[1:06:55] now
[1:06:57] i have
[1:06:58] something i have here
[1:07:00] from google
[1:07:01] talking about what is an octave in music
[1:07:05] and listen with spiritual ears
[1:07:09] typically
[1:07:11] the man sings in a lower pitch voice is
[1:07:14] that right
[1:07:15] how many knows that
[1:07:17] man voice just naturally tends to be
[1:07:19] lower if his voice tends to be higher
[1:07:22] well
[1:07:23] you know it's kind of strange but
[1:07:27] uh but here it is we find out friends
[1:07:30] that certainly the man's voice is a
[1:07:32] lower pitch
[1:07:33] but a woman sings in a higher pitched
[1:07:36] voice
[1:07:37] she doesn't have to put on anything to
[1:07:38] have a higher pitched voice whether we
[1:07:40] call it a soprano or whatever you know
[1:07:43] she doesn't have to do anything that's
[1:07:45] just the natural tones and notes of a
[1:07:48] woman's uh voice
[1:07:50] right
[1:07:51] but notice
[1:07:52] between the voice of a man and of a
[1:07:55] woman
[1:07:57] while the woman sings in a higher
[1:08:00] pitched voice
[1:08:02] it is essentially the same notes being
[1:08:06] sung
[1:08:07] in related harmonics
[1:08:10] you see
[1:08:11] that's what an octave is right
[1:08:15] for
[1:08:16] the octave is an interval between the
[1:08:20] two keys
[1:08:22] that carry the same note
[1:08:26] vibrating
[1:08:28] at different frequencies
[1:08:31] right
[1:08:32] so between the first church age
[1:08:35] and the
[1:08:36] last church age going back to the eighth
[1:08:38] day
[1:08:39] hallelujah the man's voice was sounding
[1:08:44] at one frequency
[1:08:46] but now
[1:08:47] the bride is supposed to speak the woman
[1:08:50] is supposed to sing and the thing goes
[1:08:54] into a hierarchy
[1:08:56] anointed by the holy spirit because what
[1:08:59] she is going to bring forth the word of
[1:09:02] god
[1:09:03] this is not the hour of the headship of
[1:09:07] the body though he is still in
[1:09:09] preeminence and control
[1:09:11] but this is the body ministry
[1:09:15] this is where she
[1:09:17] is able to express the word express him
[1:09:22] her life expresses christ
[1:09:25] her walk her
[1:09:27] words whatever her actions expresses
[1:09:30] jesus christ
[1:09:31] is this making any sense to you
[1:09:34] or am i just you know
[1:09:37] rambling around
[1:09:39] like that i hope you're
[1:09:41] getting what it is
[1:09:43] uh that i am
[1:09:44] really saying amen thank god
[1:09:48] hallelujah so friends
[1:09:51] i want you to know
[1:09:53] that
[1:09:54] right now we are hearing the same bible
[1:09:58] not anything different
[1:09:59] nothing added nothing taken out of it
[1:10:03] we're hearing the same message
[1:10:06] the same quotes
[1:10:09] we even hearing the same preachers
[1:10:11] everywhere
[1:10:13] with the same message
[1:10:16] but some
[1:10:18] seem to be singing in a hierarchy
[1:10:22] bringing the word
[1:10:24] in a higher level
[1:10:26] of spiritual tones
[1:10:29] for the glory of god
[1:10:31] now we have the same audience
[1:10:34] some of you have been hearing the word
[1:10:36] of god here with me for 27 years and
[1:10:41] others are here for maybe less time but
[1:10:44] it's the same audience i know it grows
[1:10:47] from time you know you baptize it two
[1:10:49] more three more four more ten more
[1:10:52] whatever praise god hallelujah but you
[1:10:54] know my policy i don't believe in just
[1:10:58] having one great big church with
[1:11:00] thousands of people i could have had
[1:11:02] that if i wanted that right
[1:11:04] and uh but
[1:11:06] always
[1:11:08] there are churches coming off of the
[1:11:10] original
[1:11:12] as soon as a a young man
[1:11:15] a young couple seemed competent they're
[1:11:17] able the spirit of god inspires
[1:11:20] praise god like brother joshua charlotte
[1:11:23] out in new brunswick this one here this
[1:11:25] one there whatever it's always like a
[1:11:29] human body it's constantly
[1:11:32] what should i say renewing itself is
[1:11:35] constantly growing multiplying like that
[1:11:40] praise god so it's not just growing
[1:11:42] bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger
[1:11:44] because that human human senses are
[1:11:46] satisfied by that and numbers the human
[1:11:49] senses are satisfied by that
[1:11:52] it speaks about whether the man that is
[1:11:54] preaching is successful rather than
[1:11:56] god's word being magnified and him being
[1:11:59] glorified but god's
[1:12:02] we have gone through the church has gone
[1:12:04] through not this church but the church
[1:12:06] all those stages and it's back to the
[1:12:09] book of acts how the apostles had it
[1:12:12] whether they were under a house
[1:12:15] or whether they were in some back street
[1:12:18] somewhere and i believe sometimes we are
[1:12:20] better off with we went back to them all
[1:12:23] days with a guitar and a tambourine and
[1:12:26] singing and praising god seeing the
[1:12:29] power of the holy ghost and the
[1:12:31] demonstrations of the holy spirit
[1:12:34] my what we have now we got to use music
[1:12:37] to drum it down
[1:12:39] we got to work it up
[1:12:41] are we not here to work up ourselves
[1:12:44] we're here for the holy spirit to come
[1:12:47] and move and trouble the waters
[1:12:51] oh praise god that you might step into
[1:12:55] that anointing
[1:12:56] and just being in the presence of the
[1:12:59] resurrected christ
[1:13:01] that anointing healing miracles signs
[1:13:04] and wonders not because i call for it
[1:13:08] but because his presence is here
[1:13:11] his power is here
[1:13:13] there's another being in here that is
[1:13:15] not me
[1:13:17] there's no glory to me
[1:13:19] i better watch what i say because that
[1:13:22] person is listening
[1:13:24] and if i exalt myself you say okay let
[1:13:27] me see you do it by yourself
[1:13:29] and he just stepped back
[1:13:30] no so a real sermon of god watches
[1:13:34] careful careful why because he does
[1:13:38] those things
[1:13:40] right you see this is what book of acts
[1:13:42] said while peter yet speak the holy
[1:13:46] ghost fell on all them that heard the
[1:13:49] word
[1:13:50] amen praise god hallelujah and you have
[1:13:54] said it you've seen it before speaking
[1:13:57] in the middle of speaking
[1:13:58] some cough the cancer up on the floor
[1:14:01] you don't have for me to go and then oh
[1:14:04] that is a miracle man that man has a lot
[1:14:06] of power in the holy ghost and no no no
[1:14:09] no no no no the cancer got scared of the
[1:14:12] presence of jesus christ
[1:14:15] in the church in the believers
[1:14:18] hallelujah this is not me or you or
[1:14:21] anybody it's him
[1:14:24] glory to our god in the highest
[1:14:28] be his holy name
[1:14:30] praise god hallelujah
[1:14:32] amen look the spirit takes the same song
[1:14:37] it's the same bible same word same
[1:14:40] message but god begins to reveal it and
[1:14:43] inspire it by the holy ghost let me
[1:14:47] show you what i mean luke chapter 24
[1:14:51] reading from verses 27 to 32 we're not
[1:14:53] going to read that now but just so it's
[1:14:55] on the tape also it goes out on the
[1:14:58] internet this is about jesus
[1:15:01] our risen lord
[1:15:05] not the word that they're buried
[1:15:08] in a grave of theology
[1:15:11] in a
[1:15:12] not cemetery but seminary
[1:15:15] that buried him there
[1:15:17] it's okay
[1:15:18] to go to one
[1:15:20] i'm not
[1:15:21] calling them down because as you know i
[1:15:23] went to one
[1:15:25] but then i'm out of it
[1:15:27] just i'm not saying like paul but paul
[1:15:29] said
[1:15:30] that dumb and ash that i might win
[1:15:33] christ the anointed one
[1:15:36] within my heart and life a reality
[1:15:39] praise god not knowledge of word praise
[1:15:42] god but here my friends i want you to
[1:15:46] see
[1:15:46] that the r is here
[1:15:49] when jesus the risen word
[1:15:53] for he was always the word
[1:15:55] they put him
[1:15:57] and entombed him
[1:15:59] in a a roman tomb
[1:16:03] with stones of doubt and fear to block
[1:16:06] the people from the world but thank god
[1:16:09] an angel rolled the stone away
[1:16:12] eyes were opened hearts were encouraged
[1:16:15] and jesus
[1:16:17] began to
[1:16:18] walk again on the earth
[1:16:21] and as the disciples were mourning
[1:16:24] and crying
[1:16:25] at the cross at the cross
[1:16:28] jesus died
[1:16:30] and easter time all in black crying but
[1:16:34] then what happens
[1:16:35] suddenly
[1:16:37] like the pillar of fire did
[1:16:39] when moses was looking to sheep
[1:16:42] the fire was in the bush
[1:16:44] and here comes this man stepping out of
[1:16:46] the bushes
[1:16:47] beside the roadway
[1:16:49] and he says
[1:16:51] uh who is this christ that you're
[1:16:54] talking about
[1:16:56] don't you know i mean
[1:17:00] you have you been to jerusalem don't you
[1:17:02] know and they began to relate to him how
[1:17:06] their lord came and he was sick he was
[1:17:09] good and he was kind and everything else
[1:17:12] and then they crucified him and rather
[1:17:15] to uh
[1:17:17] align themselves with barabbas a known
[1:17:20] murderer and a thief of faith and not
[1:17:23] only of money but
[1:17:26] they align themselves with him and they
[1:17:29] be and said now he's buried dead and
[1:17:31] they were we're going back to where we
[1:17:33] came from going back to our old church
[1:17:36] our old home wherever and they were
[1:17:38] mourning and jesus said all you fools
[1:17:42] and slow in heart
[1:17:45] to believe
[1:17:47] and the bible says take and from moses
[1:17:50] he took the scriptures and began to
[1:17:54] explain to them the bible says about
[1:17:57] himself
[1:17:59] the word for he is the word so he was
[1:18:02] explaining
[1:18:03] and interpreting and teaching their word
[1:18:07] to them
[1:18:09] after he was risen
[1:18:11] why
[1:18:12] before he was risen the bible said he
[1:18:15] spoke in parables
[1:18:17] but now here he is talking to them
[1:18:19] plainly
[1:18:21] listen friends
[1:18:23] god is his own interpreter
[1:18:26] and he will make it plain
[1:18:29] praise god everything i say
[1:18:32] check it with the word
[1:18:34] recognize whether these things be the
[1:18:37] truth
[1:18:38] oh my praise god hallelujah he went back
[1:18:42] over the same things that they had
[1:18:45] already heard from him
[1:18:48] wouldn't that be boring
[1:18:50] but it was not
[1:18:52] because he was opening up the scriptures
[1:18:55] to them in a new way
[1:18:57] so that they can see
[1:18:59] what was hidden back there in the word
[1:19:02] the types the shadows the substitutions
[1:19:06] and so on the the various
[1:19:08] transformations coming forth out of the
[1:19:10] word of god and so then as they began to
[1:19:14] hear it praise god we know friends that
[1:19:17] they they said
[1:19:19] uh come and stay with us and and so you
[1:19:22] know the rest of the story he went with
[1:19:24] them and then all of a sudden he
[1:19:25] disappeared and they said oh is not this
[1:19:28] the christ amen did not our hearts burn
[1:19:32] within us
[1:19:34] as we listen him along the way praise
[1:19:38] god i trust this morning
[1:19:41] your hearts are burning within you
[1:19:44] that you are recognizing the presence of
[1:19:47] almighty god
[1:19:49] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:19:52] forever oh praise god in the greater
[1:19:56] witness than john this was said
[1:19:59] we know
[1:20:00] that there is a higher realm that we can
[1:20:03] climb into and we are going into it
[1:20:07] higher someday i believe that's this day
[1:20:12] that we are living in right now this is
[1:20:15] the hour when god is lifting us up into
[1:20:18] a higher level praise god forevermore
[1:20:22] hallelujah don't we sing the song lord
[1:20:24] plant my feet on high
[1:20:27] your ground
[1:20:30] lord lift me up and let me stand
[1:20:34] by faith on
[1:20:37] heaven's table and
[1:20:40] a higher plane
[1:20:43] than i have found
[1:20:47] lord plant my feet
[1:20:50] on high
[1:20:51] your
[1:20:52] ground
[1:20:54] a higher ground
[1:20:57] of understanding
[1:20:59] a higher ground
[1:21:00] of revelation
[1:21:03] a dimension just beyond the sound of
[1:21:07] human heirs
[1:21:09] just beyond the reach of human
[1:21:12] intellectuals
[1:21:14] it can't go there
[1:21:16] it cannot because it's another dimension
[1:21:19] whatsoever
[1:21:20] to illustrate
[1:21:23] do you know
[1:21:24] tv waves are passing through this room
[1:21:27] right now
[1:21:30] why you can't see them
[1:21:32] you don't have the you're not built with
[1:21:34] equipment to see them
[1:21:37] but a real prophet standing here
[1:21:40] i am not one so look at me but uh
[1:21:45] could look and see those waves passing
[1:21:48] right
[1:21:49] or praise god
[1:21:51] and there is an actual other realm out
[1:21:55] there another dimension
[1:21:57] amen
[1:21:59] and that's what god would take the
[1:22:01] prophets and put them in that realm and
[1:22:03] when you're lying to them they are
[1:22:05] seeing what you did and what not and
[1:22:07] what not and what you said and you can't
[1:22:09] escape because he just bring them on the
[1:22:12] border of his thoughts and of his mind
[1:22:15] and so
[1:22:16] that's what happened and they begin to
[1:22:19] be able to see those things
[1:22:21] for the glory of god now understand
[1:22:24] clearly here also
[1:22:26] that
[1:22:28] um
[1:22:28] dealing with dogs
[1:22:31] i have a whistle at home when you blow
[1:22:33] it
[1:22:34] there's nothing that my ears can really
[1:22:36] hear but like the wind passing through
[1:22:38] it
[1:22:39] but you know
[1:22:41] the sound they say is coming out at a
[1:22:43] high pitch
[1:22:45] in another dimension that only the dogs
[1:22:48] can hear
[1:22:50] and they use those bristles
[1:22:52] to train dogs
[1:22:54] you can ask a real dog trainer and
[1:22:57] they'll tell you that those whistles dog
[1:22:59] whistles are used to train dogs because
[1:23:02] it does emit a sound but it's not the
[1:23:05] sound the human heirs can pick up
[1:23:08] and i'm trying to tell you by the word
[1:23:11] of god that the holy spirit has lifted
[1:23:15] this word of god into a higher dimension
[1:23:18] and it takes the spirit of god to anoint
[1:23:21] you
[1:23:22] that is why the book of revelation says
[1:23:24] let him that had an ear to hear
[1:23:27] let him or her here
[1:23:30] that means some wouldn't hear
[1:23:33] but if you were elected
[1:23:36] you were anointed
[1:23:38] you're born with a purpose
[1:23:41] you're born with god's purpose in his
[1:23:44] mind
[1:23:46] in your life
[1:23:47] he will open your ears
[1:23:49] and you will hear the disciples were
[1:23:52] puzzled by this they said master how is
[1:23:54] it while you are teaching that that we
[1:23:57] understand we we hear but the pharisees
[1:24:00] the sadducees they don't understand what
[1:24:03] what you're saying he said because unto
[1:24:05] you
[1:24:06] it is given to know the mysteries of the
[1:24:09] kingdom
[1:24:10] but unto them it is not given
[1:24:13] let him that an ear to hear let him or
[1:24:17] her hear the word of god
[1:24:19] amen praise god forevermore yes sir so
[1:24:23] we know that the word
[1:24:26] is going forth
[1:24:28] but not only what your natural ear can
[1:24:31] hear
[1:24:32] but beyond that it's speaking
[1:24:36] and each one of you right now are
[1:24:39] receiving your portion
[1:24:42] of what god intends for you
[1:24:46] and that is what you are hearing
[1:24:49] yet we are hearing the same thing
[1:24:51] but yet i am hearing something a little
[1:24:54] different from what you were here but
[1:24:55] that depends on your needs
[1:24:58] and what he knows
[1:25:00] that you need let me back up a little
[1:25:02] bit here
[1:25:04] you understand
[1:25:06] that eternal life did not begin on a
[1:25:09] certain
[1:25:10] date where you can go and say oh
[1:25:13] i was saved on september the sun
[1:25:16] nineteen or the fifth or the twenty
[1:25:19] first uh
[1:25:20] in nineteen hundred
[1:25:22] that's wonderful that's when you became
[1:25:24] aware that you need to repent or turn
[1:25:28] around
[1:25:30] and commit your life to jesus christ
[1:25:33] but
[1:25:35] like like i said in the school while i
[1:25:38] was in there and the question asked
[1:25:41] and um
[1:25:43] how come you saying hell's eternal
[1:25:46] uh i said yes it's eternal well how come
[1:25:50] can you say that when the bible says
[1:25:52] hell was created
[1:25:54] for the devil and his angels
[1:25:56] so
[1:25:57] therefore um you know i carry the
[1:26:00] thought a little further therefore
[1:26:02] that means that
[1:26:04] those personal people will have eternal
[1:26:07] life just like i do
[1:26:09] because they'll have to burn in hell
[1:26:11] eternally
[1:26:13] and if they're burning eternally that
[1:26:15] means they have eternal life
[1:26:17] are you trying to tell me eternal life
[1:26:19] is just based on your geographical
[1:26:21] location and position no of course not
[1:26:24] right
[1:26:26] eternal means without beginning
[1:26:29] and without end
[1:26:32] which means the true child of god or
[1:26:34] children of god were in the mind of god
[1:26:39] before the foundations of the world
[1:26:44] and my thoughts on me are one
[1:26:47] right i'm one with my thoughts uh
[1:26:51] but then i have to speak those thoughts
[1:26:53] and then
[1:26:55] if i have to work or do something or
[1:26:57] carve or paint or create it then you'll
[1:27:00] see my thoughts now expressed
[1:27:03] that's what god did with the human race
[1:27:06] and in the human race is
[1:27:10] his elected children
[1:27:13] and those elected children
[1:27:16] have eternal life but he has to make
[1:27:19] them conscious of what is in them
[1:27:22] and who they are
[1:27:24] that you are not just anybody walking
[1:27:27] around but you are a son of the heavenly
[1:27:29] king
[1:27:31] your kings and priests are god by the
[1:27:33] holy spirit
[1:27:35] amen glory to god i thank god for that
[1:27:39] that oh that he made me aware of this
[1:27:42] conscious of his divine presence and of
[1:27:45] his word
[1:27:47] within my heart and life amen praise god
[1:27:51] and i'm glad that every day we can go
[1:27:54] higher and higher praise the lord of
[1:27:57] course there's a lot more i can say
[1:27:59] about these things and i'm going to do
[1:28:01] my best begin to wind this up praise god
[1:28:05] hallelujah oh praise god we're going up
[1:28:09] in the first resurrection
[1:28:15] higher every day wiser blessed lord
[1:28:18] and thy blessed holy word oh praise god
[1:28:21] forevermore first round justification
[1:28:24] second round sanctification third round
[1:28:28] what
[1:28:29] baptism holy spirit but now
[1:28:32] what lot of pentecost doesn't realize
[1:28:34] god has gone past that for our god is
[1:28:38] marching on
[1:28:39] this is not just a
[1:28:41] baptizo
[1:28:42] uh to be baptized in the spirit but the
[1:28:45] bible says my friends clearly that the
[1:28:49] holy ghost himself
[1:28:51] praise god i you know jesus was a seed
[1:28:54] corner of each seed he told how he would
[1:28:57] go in the ground how he would multiply
[1:28:58] himself a thousand fold or whatever but
[1:29:02] when it comes back up it will be what
[1:29:04] seed again
[1:29:06] but in a multiplied form he is just
[1:29:09] saying here i am in the head ship as one
[1:29:12] seed of god the one seed and now i go
[1:29:15] into the ground i multiply myself and i
[1:29:18] come back up looking like a church
[1:29:21] looking like a many member body but yet
[1:29:24] that many member body is him
[1:29:27] expressing himself
[1:29:29] truth uh through
[1:29:31] true believers
[1:29:33] that will believe
