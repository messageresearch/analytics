[9:02] Hallelujah. Matthew 6:34 says, "Don't
[9:04] worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will
[9:05] worry about itself.
[9:07] Each day has enough trouble of its own."
[9:11] Hallelujah.
[9:13] Let's go to prayer. Lord Jesus, we are
[9:15] so grateful, Lord.
[9:18] one day at a time. Lord, sometimes we
[9:21] get so
[9:23] frustrated with our trials and our
[9:25] tribulations and
[9:27] but I read a scripture you said that
[9:30] Satan desire to sift you like wheat,
[9:33] Peter. But I have prayed for you and
[9:36] when you overcome, go strengthen your
[9:38] brethren. Lord, we are we want to take
[9:40] our trials that way tonight. Lord, when
[9:42] we face our trials, we want to use them
[9:44] to encourage somebody else, Lord Jesus.
[9:47] Father, we are so grateful to be in your
[9:49] house and give you thanks, give you
[9:51] praise, Lord. We could lift up our
[9:52] hands, Lord. We could have been
[9:53] somewhere else tonight. But you have
[9:55] brought us into your house, Lord, and to
[9:58] worship you and to give you thanks, give
[9:59] you praise, Lord, as your word will come
[10:02] tonight, Lord. Open up our eyes and our
[10:04] ears to hear what you have to say to us,
[10:05] Lord. We're so grateful that you've
[10:08] given us strength, Lord, if we could be
[10:09] here tonight. Remember those on the way,
[10:11] Lord. You protect them and bring them
[10:12] home safely. those that couldn't make
[10:14] it, give them a great blessing at home.
[10:16] Lord, we thank you. Give you praise. In
[10:19] your precious name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[10:22] And amen.
[10:24] You glad to be in this house tonight.
[10:27] Amen. Let let go of the old
[10:30] and let give.
[10:35] So let
[10:38] go of
[10:42] [Music]
[10:46] you
[10:48] and lay down a new life.
[10:56] There's a new life waits for you
[11:01] and cast your breath upon the waters.
[11:07] After many days, it shall return.
[11:13] If you pour out your soul, not a part,
[11:17] but a home
[11:20] as a new life wait for you.
[11:25] Oh, let let go of you
[11:32] and lay a hold on you.
[11:38] It lay down a new life.
[11:44] There's a new life wait for you.
[11:48] [Music]
[11:50] In saving your life, you will lose it.
[11:55] But by losing your life, you will find
[12:00] it.
[12:02] It's longing to grow. When new life is
[12:07] found,
[12:09] there's a new life wait for you.
[12:14] Oh, let let go of the old
[12:23] on you.
[12:26] It lay it down.
[12:30] New life is
[12:32] [Music]
[12:34] a new life wait for you. Let go.
[12:39] Let go of you.
[12:46] Hold on you
[12:51] and lay it down.
[12:54] You life is
[12:57] [Music]
[12:59] a new life wait for you.
[13:02] [Music]
[13:03] Oh,
[13:05] a new life wait for you.
[13:08] Hallelujah.
[13:10] God is good
[13:14] all the time
[13:17] for the son.
[13:20] It is hard.
[13:23] God is good.

[13:30] through the darkest night. His light
[13:34] will shine. God is good.
[13:39] God is good
[13:42] all the time.
[13:45] [Music]
[13:48] If you're walking
[13:51] through the valley
[13:54] and there shadows
[13:57] all around,
[14:00] do not fear.
[14:03] He will guide you.
[14:06] He will keep you safe and sound.
[14:12] He has promise
[14:16] never leave you
[14:18] nor forsake you and his word is true.

[14:36] mine. God is good

[14:42] [Music]
[14:43] through the darkness.

[18:15] Amen. Hallelujah.
[18:19] And uh

[18:31] Hallelujah. Let's turn to Galatians
[18:33] 2:16. Amen.
[18:36] Hallelujah.
[18:39] And then we're going to go to Luke 17:20
[18:43] and then John 3:1. We're continuing on
[18:45] the power of tradition part 19. And my
[18:48] subject tonight, my title is Behold, the
[18:50] kingdom of God has come within the
[18:52] bride. But my subject tonight is is it's
[18:55] a little different, but I hope it
[18:58] unfolds itself. The bride is completing
[19:01] the work of redemption. You say,
[19:02] "Brother, the work of redemption is
[19:04] already completed through the cross,
[19:05] through the opening of the Yes.
[19:08] But now the bride is in the word has
[19:11] become in the bride now.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; And as she fulfills that word and as
[19:17] that word that has been spoken and
[19:19] prophesied manifests through her life.
[19:22] Amen. It's not her. It's never her as as
[19:25] we're going to see. It's always him.
[19:27] It's always been him. Amen. Fulfilling
[19:29] his word now through the bride of Jesus
[19:31] Christ.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So to give you a little
[19:34] where my my thoughts are, my mind is on
[19:36] this uh statement because some people
[19:38] you know that are very learned in the
[19:41] message, they might take and go all
[19:43] different ways. Galatians 2:16.
[19:48] Let us pray. Father, thank you Lord
[19:50] tonight as we gather together. Father,
[19:53] Lord, we have prayed, we have believed,
[19:57] we have studied. Father, now we come
[20:00] after a long day. Some of us I know Lord
[20:04] I I had a wonderful day yesterday
[20:07] studying a little bit and this morning a
[20:09] little bit more reviewing things and
[20:11] then all of a sudden bang just before we
[20:14] were leaving a few hours my body starts
[20:17] getting under attack. But Lord I know
[20:19] that's for me to step out by faith
[20:22] father now because without a sacrifice
[20:25] there's you know Lord we got to put a
[20:27] sacrifice on the altar for something for
[20:29] you to burn. And I stand here tonight.
[20:31] Amen. We are here tonight by the grace
[20:35] of God. We are here by faith tonight.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; It took faith to be here tonight, Lord.
[20:41] And may you come and honor that faith
[20:43] tonight, Lord. Lord, do what you always
[20:47] do, Lord.
[20:49] And what is easy for you to do. Bless
[20:51] your people. Fill them. Strengthen them.
[20:56] Heal them. Deliver them. Open prison
[20:59] doors. Cast out demons of unbelief.
[21:01] Father, Lord, all of us here tonight,
[21:04] Lord, may we be caught up into your
[21:06] presence, oh God. Grant it now, Father.
[21:09] Bless your word in Jesus name.
[21:12] Hallelujah.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Galatians 2:16. Knowing that a man
[21:18] is not justified by the works of the
[21:21] law, but by faith of Jesus Christ. Even
[21:26] we have believed in Jesus Christ that we
[21:28] might be justified by faith. We know
[21:31] what faith is. It's a revelation.
[21:34] By faith of Christ, not of works of the
[21:37] law, but by the works of by the works of
[21:41] the law shall no flesh be justified. But
[21:46] while but if while we seek to be
[21:49] justified by Christ, the revealed word,
[21:52] the anointing, we ourselves also are
[21:56] found sinners. Is therefore Christ the
[21:59] minister of sin? God forbid. For if I
[22:03] build again the things which I destroy,
[22:06] I make myself a transgressor.
[22:11] For I through the law am dead to the law
[22:15] that I might live unto God.
[22:19] I am crucified with Christ.
[22:22] Nevertheless,
[22:23] I live yet not I
[22:27] but Christ liveth in me.
[22:30] That's very important here when Paul is
[22:33] saying that
[22:35] it's not I that live yet, but it is
[22:38] Christ that lives in me.
[22:41] And the life which I now live in the
[22:44] flesh
[22:46] I live by faith of the son of God who
[22:50] loved me and gave himself for me. I do
[22:53] not frustrate the grace of God by the
[22:56] law. I do not frustrate the grace of
[22:58] God. For if righteousness come by the
[23:01] law then Christ is dead in vain.
[23:05] Amen. We recognize that this life, this
[23:09] token life, what God is doing, the
[23:11] kingdom of God inside the bride today is
[23:14] not by law. Amen. Luke 17:20.
[23:18] And when he was
[23:21] demand of the Pharisees when the kingdom
[23:24] of God should come, he answered them and
[23:27] said, "The kingdom of God cometh not
[23:31] with observation.
[23:33] Neither shall they say, Lo here or low
[23:36] there, for behold, the kingdom of God is
[23:41] within you." Hallelujah. John 3:1.
[23:48] We have to bring this scripture. We have
[23:49] all the scriptures tie in together and
[23:52] we bring in this series and this
[23:55] scripture always comes up
[23:59] because if we don't start right, we
[24:01] don't end right.
[24:03] There was a man of the Pharisees named
[24:06] Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. The same
[24:08] came to Jesus by night and said unto
[24:10] him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a
[24:12] teacher come from God. For no man can do
[24:15] these miracles that thou doest except
[24:18] God be with him. Wow. Wow.
[24:23] You know, we look we look back there,
[24:25] but can we bring it to today? Can we if
[24:29] we're recognizing ourselves in the word
[24:30] of God today? We're seeing ourselves.
[24:34] Hallelujah.
[24:36] Amen. Jesus answered and said unto him,
[24:38] "Verily, verily, I say unto thee the
[24:39] except the man be born again, he cannot
[24:41] see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus said
[24:44] unto him, "How can a man be born when
[24:47] he's old? Can he enter the second time
[24:48] into the mother's womb and be born?"
[24:51] Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say
[24:53] unto thee, except a man be born of water
[24:56] and of the spirit, he cannot enter the
[24:58] kingdom. That which is born of the flesh
[25:01] is flesh, but that which is born of the
[25:03] spirit is spirit." Marvel not that I say
[25:06] unto thee, you must be born again.
[25:09] Allelujah. You may be seated.
[25:12] Marvel not. Amen. Hallelujah.
[25:16] This day, marvel not
[25:20] that the word of God is telling us that
[25:22] we must be born again.
[25:25] I want to read a few scriptures here.
[25:27] Tonight is Bible study. So, I want to
[25:30] read a few scriptures and a few quotes.
[25:33] Hallelujah.
[25:34] Amen. That I got written down here and
[25:37] see what the Lord will do tonight.
[25:40] Hallelujah.
[25:42] Matthew 16:19.
[25:45] And I will give you the keys of the
[25:49] kingdom of heaven. And whatever you bind
[25:52] on earth shall be bound in heaven. And
[25:56] whatever you loose on earth shall be
[25:58] loosed in heaven. Now, we're talking
[26:01] about the kingdom of God here.
[26:04] And we recognize that the kingdom has
[26:06] come. Amen. We believe the seals have
[26:10] been open. We believe God sent a
[26:12] prophet. Amen. Hallelujah. And and the
[26:17] word always comes to the prophet. So a
[26:20] word came to the prophet and a word was
[26:23] spoken in these last days. Hallelujah.
[26:26] And that word was to go to a bride. And
[26:31] that word is the kingdom of God. So the
[26:34] kingdom of God, Amen, is to go to the
[26:37] bride. Hallelujah. So I want you to
[26:41] recognize tonight, Amen, that if you are
[26:45] truly born again, the kingdom has come.
[26:48] Amen.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the kingdom has
[26:52] authority.
[26:54] The kingdom has privileges. Amen. The
[26:57] blood has purchased everything.
[27:00] Everything we have need of is in that
[27:02] kingdom. We don't have to do anything in
[27:05] ourselves. That's the covenant that is
[27:08] given to the seed of Abraham, the faith
[27:10] seed of Abraham. Not what you can do
[27:13] tonight. Amen. How you can work things
[27:16] out in your life, but what I have
[27:19] already done, what I have already
[27:21] completed. Amen. It's always the
[27:24] mystery. That is the mystery of the
[27:26] kingdom of God that is coming within
[27:29] man. The mystery that God Amen. That I'm
[27:32] in the father, the father in me, and I
[27:35] in you and you in me.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; That's the mystery. And let me tell you,
[27:39] even in this message, it's a mystery
[27:43] that the that that the same God that
[27:46] lived in Jesus Christ, the same God that
[27:49] lived in the prophet that was waved over
[27:51] us, that same God, that same word, that
[27:55] same manifestation is here today, sir.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; That same kingdom of God is here today.
[28:02] Amen.
[28:03] It's always been that way, my brothers
[28:05] and sisters. Hallelujah. We look back at
[28:09] Jesus day and we go, if we were in the
[28:11] days of Jesus, oh my, I would recognize
[28:14] him. I would support him. I would be
[28:17] right beside him.
[28:19] They didn't. Only a very few.
[28:23] Is that the truth?
[28:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's day, same thing
[28:28] happened. We look today
[28:31] and I'm not going to talk about all the
[28:32] nonsense that's going on
[28:35] and he would call it nonsense too in the
[28:37] message which is mess age. I'm not in
[28:42] Leosian. I'm not in the mess age. I'm in
[28:45] the capstone.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon didn't put me in the
[28:48] capstone. The Holy Ghost put me in the
[28:50] capstone.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the Holy Ghost has put
[28:53] me in the rapture.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost is the rapture inside
[28:56] of me. Amen.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:59] But they look back at him and and they
[29:01] go, "Oh, if I was in brother Brandham's
[29:02] day, I would be doing this and that."
[29:04] But here he was, the word made flesh.
[29:07] Don't you understand? Amen. The great
[29:10] saying, "History repeats itself." Don't
[29:11] you understand that the word of God
[29:13] always repeats itself?
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you come into a consciousness
[29:18] and a reality, when back in their day,
[29:20] when they recognized when Peter said,
[29:22] "Thou art the the Christ, the son of the
[29:24] living God," something struck him.
[29:27] awakening happened
[29:29] and he recognized who this Jesus was
[29:33] more than a prophet. Hallelujah. Just
[29:36] like in the back in brother Brandham's
[29:38] days, a few recognized that this was
[29:40] Malachi 4:5. Now here we are today, my
[29:44] brothers and sisters. What are we to do?
[29:46] What are we to do just to play church
[29:48] and and come to church and call
[29:50] ourselves believers?
[29:52] And I can quote the message. I can quote
[29:55] the Bible.
[29:58] Is that what we're supposed to do? Is
[30:00] that what is prophesied for us to do?
[30:04] No.
[30:06] We're to bring forth the word of God
[30:08] today. But let me tell you one thing.
[30:11] It's got to repeat again.
[30:14] It's got to repeat in these last days.
[30:15] So don't get surprised when they don't
[30:17] recognize who you are
[30:19] &gt;&gt; in the message. Don't get surprised when
[30:22] they when they tell you you're false or
[30:24] you're this or you're that because
[30:25] you're preaching the word of God.
[30:28] Oh, too many preachers are are preaching
[30:30] it safe. If I if I just say what the the
[30:33] the tapes say, if I just say what
[30:34] brother Brandon say, I'd be okay. I
[30:37] won't be off the word. I won't be a
[30:40] Judas or an antichrist.
[30:42] That's not the bride. It's never been
[30:44] the bride of Jesus Christ. It's never
[30:47] been a true believer down through the
[30:49] ages.
[30:50] Uh Luther got a revelation, the just
[30:52] shall live by faith. Amen. He went out
[30:55] and preached it. It was contrary to
[30:58] everything. Amen. That he believed and
[31:00] that everybody around him that believed.
[31:02] But he stepped out by faith. And that's
[31:05] what produced the revival, the
[31:07] restoration of the word of God in this
[31:09] last day. When people step out, the
[31:13] bride has to step out. Amen. She's got
[31:16] the message. Yes, she's got the message.
[31:17] But now the message got to get inside of
[31:19] her. It's got to be revealed to her. And
[31:22] when it's inside and revealed and that
[31:24] same God that was in brother Brandham is
[31:27] in her, then he starts speaking
[31:30] &gt;&gt; and and speaking the word of God.
[31:33] Hallelujah.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:37] Hallelujah.
[31:38] John 18:36
[31:40] Jesus said, we're talking about the
[31:42] kingdom tonight. Hallelujah.
[31:46] My kingdom is not of this world. If my
[31:50] kingdom were of this world, my servants
[31:53] would have been fighting that I might
[31:57] not be delivered over to the Jews.
[32:01] But my kingdom is not of this world. So
[32:05] we understand that. We recognize that.
[32:08] Amen.
[32:10] Hallelujah.
[32:11] His kingdom is an unseen kingdom.
[32:15] Hallelujah. Is an invisible kingdom.
[32:17] Amen. But to the bride of Jesus Christ,
[32:20] she sees her his kingdom because the
[32:24] kingdom is within her. Luke 17:21.
[32:27] Nor will they say, look here, it is it
[32:30] is or there for behold the kingdom of
[32:33] God is in the midst of you. And then in
[32:36] the other place, he said, the kingdom of
[32:38] God is within you. Hallelujah. I believe
[32:41] he is here tonight. Do you believe he's
[32:44] here tonight?
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Are you conscious of his presence here
[32:47] tonight? Oh, hallelujah. It does
[32:51] something when it when you recognize and
[32:55] you're conscious of his presence, you
[32:57] start attracting him on the scene. Amen.
[32:59] Hallelujah. Amen. Things can happen here
[33:03] tonight. Not brother Tim, beyond me.
[33:06] Things can happen here tonight by your
[33:08] faith. Amen. This is not just another
[33:10] Wednesday night. This is not just
[33:13] another Wednesday night cuz Brother
[33:14] Tim's preaching or whoever's preaching.
[33:17] This is another night. Amen. That could
[33:19] be your night where faith will operate
[33:22] in your life. Amen.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That your enlightening, your
[33:28] awakening might come.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; That's what we're here. That's the
[33:34] presence that we believe that we're in
[33:36] tonight.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We won't just uh play church or
[33:43] play religion when we're, oh, I'm coming
[33:45] to church. You're coming into the
[33:47] presence of almighty God. Amen. Into the
[33:51] presence of the pillar of fire
[33:53] &gt;&gt; where he knows everything.
[33:55] He knows your thoughts. He knows your
[33:58] heart. He know what you did today. He
[34:01] know what you said today. He know the
[34:03] mistakes that you made today. He knows
[34:06] everything about you. That's the
[34:08] presence we're coming into. Hallelujah.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when we recognize that's
[34:12] his presence, that the kingdom of God
[34:14] has come, the kingdom of God is in our
[34:16] midst and the kingdom of God has come
[34:19] within us.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[34:23] Hallelujah.
[34:24] Mark 9:1.
[34:27] And he said to them, truly I say unto
[34:30] you, there are some standing here who
[34:33] will not taste death. Oh, hallelujah.
[34:38] Why? Because the kingdom, Amen. until
[34:41] they see the kingdom of God after it has
[34:45] come with power. What is that power of
[34:47] the kingdom? The rapture. Amen. The the
[34:51] body change, the translation. Amen.
[34:54] Hallelujah. We are experienced that now.
[34:57] Listen. Don't put it off to a a a future
[35:00] event, my brothers and sisters. Amen.
[35:03] That that is hap that power that
[35:06] translation is happening now. It's
[35:10] taking place now.
[35:12] Every victory you get every time you
[35:16] overcome. Hallelujah.
[35:18] That's the rapture manifesting. That's
[35:21] the kingdom within you. Amen.
[35:24] Hallelujah. Revelations 11:15.
[35:28] Hallelujah. You keep praying. You keep
[35:30] believing. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm
[35:33] pressing on up here. I'm pressing
[35:35] through. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[35:38] You don't realize what the the preacher
[35:39] has to go through. Amen. To break
[35:41] through unbelief. But let's let's pray.
[35:44] Let's believe together. Amen. Amen.
[35:47] Let's join our faith together as one
[35:49] tonight. Amen. I'm just a vessel up here
[35:52] that God is using, but we're all in the
[35:55] kingdom tonight. Amen. We're all in the
[35:58] midst of the kingdom tonight. Amen. the
[36:00] pillar fires moving in here. I believe
[36:03] the presence of Jesus Christ, the person
[36:06] of Christ is here tonight. Amen.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; And I want to honor him. I want to
[36:11] respect him. Amen. I want to give all
[36:14] that I can to him.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Revelations 11:15. Then the seventh
[36:21] angel blew his trumpet and there was a
[36:24] loud voices in heaven saying, "The
[36:27] kingdom of the world has become the
[36:29] kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ
[36:32] and he shall reign forever and ever."
[36:34] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. My
[36:38] brothers, this is about to take place.
[36:41] Amen. Hallelujah.
[36:43] Matthew 7:21, "Not everyone who says to
[36:47] me,"Lord, Lord," will enter into the
[36:49] kingdom of heaven, but the ones who do
[36:52] the will of my father who is in heaven.
[36:55] Luke 16:16,
[36:57] "The law of the prophets were until
[36:59] John. Since then, the good news of the
[37:03] kingdom of God is preached, and everyone
[37:06] forces his way into it. Everyone presses
[37:11] their way into the kingdom. That's what
[37:14] it is. Is a forcing. The Bible says it's
[37:16] a pressing in into the kingdom. Amen.
[37:20] That's what we are experiencing in our
[37:22] walks. Amen. That's why we have to
[37:25] overcome.
[37:26] Amen. We heard on Sunday about the
[37:29] adoption.
[37:31] And to be adopted, Amen. into his
[37:34] kingdom is to overcome.
[37:38] Overcoming is a great thing, my brothers
[37:41] and sisters, in the Bible.
[37:44] Look in the book of Revelations.
[37:47] It says many different places to the
[37:51] overcomer.
[37:53] Amen.
[37:55] Who overcomes in their age, I will grant
[37:59] to them. I will grant to them. I will
[38:02] grant to them all the privileges of God
[38:06] and of the kingdom is granted to the
[38:09] overcomer.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:14] Glory to God.
[38:17] If you walk with Christ in your heart
[38:22] by the new birth, you have been dealing
[38:25] with many things.
[38:27] Oh yes. If you're really in this walk,
[38:31] you're dealing with many things. You
[38:34] know why? Because there's a
[38:35] transformation taking place in your
[38:36] life. There's the old dying out and then
[38:41] there's the new. And the devil will
[38:43] always try to keep you in the old, keep
[38:46] you in the flesh
[38:48] and keep you from the spirit, keep you
[38:51] from recognizing things, keep you from
[38:54] recognizing familiar spirits in your
[38:56] life. You know, familiar spirits,
[38:59] hallelujah, speak to you.
[39:03] You know how they speak to you? I'll
[39:05] tell you how deceiving that this is. But
[39:08] when the Holy Ghost reveals it to you,
[39:11] it's plain and simple. But those
[39:13] familiar spirits speak to you in your
[39:15] own voice, in your own head.
[39:19] You wonder why people go off on all
[39:22] kinds of craziness, I call it. There's
[39:26] other words for it, but craziness, all
[39:29] kinds of of uh imaginations,
[39:33] all kinds of uh things that they, "Oh,
[39:37] God spoke to me." And then they end up,
[39:40] like Brother Brandham says, shipwrecked
[39:42] out there. Their faith gets shipwrecked.
[39:46] But God spoke to me and told me to do
[39:49] this. God spoke to me and said to leave
[39:53] the church. God spoke to me and told me,
[39:57] "Amen."
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not to believe what you're
[40:01] saying. All these things. Oh, brother.
[40:05] It's so deceiving. You don't even
[40:06] realize until God comes. Amen. And
[40:10] reveal something to you and break you
[40:12] out of a delusion of Satan. Familiar
[40:15] spirits
[40:17] to the overcomer.
[40:19] I will grant. Amen. Hallelujah.
[40:24] Amen. You are dealing with many things
[40:26] and asking and praying about what you
[40:29] want him to do in your life to become
[40:33] more like him. So you come to church
[40:35] tonight. We all come to church tonight
[40:39] with something in our hearts. Each and
[40:41] every one of us have something in our
[40:43] hearts. I hope we do. I hope we have a
[40:46] hunger. I hope we have a thirst for God.
[40:49] Amen. Hallelujah. that you want God to
[40:52] speak to you. Even if he says wait,
[40:57] he knows what you are going through. God
[41:01] says I am in control and I will speak
[41:05] the answer to you. Hallelujah. Now get
[41:10] your mind out of brother Tim speaking
[41:12] the answer to you. Hallelujah. It's God
[41:16] going to speak the answer to you. It's
[41:19] God and the spirit that's going to
[41:21] reveal to your heart. Hallelujah. That's
[41:24] why Jesus said, "Flesh and blood has not
[41:27] revealed it to you. Education, man, has
[41:30] not revealed it to you." Hallelujah. But
[41:33] my father which is in heaven has
[41:35] revealed it to you. You see, my
[41:36] brothers, we have to break in to the
[41:39] kingdom of God.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; That's in our midst. Amen. To know the
[41:44] kingdom, you got to press into the
[41:46] kingdom. You got to force yourself into
[41:48] the kingdom of God. Hallelujah.
[41:52] Oh, what do you how do I force myself?
[41:55] Hallelujah.
[41:57] You hunger. You thirst for
[41:59] righteousness. Jesus said, I can only
[42:01] tell you what the word says. You knock.
[42:04] You knock. Amen. You call like the
[42:08] unjust judge. You keep knocking and keep
[42:10] calling. You keep pressing. Amen. The
[42:14] battle's getting tougher. Keep pressing
[42:16] on. Like the angel said to brother
[42:19] Brandham, "You don't know what awaits
[42:21] you. Keep pressing the battle. Keep
[42:24] pressing into the kingdom." Hallelujah.
[42:27] Amen.
[42:29] Oh, this is getting Listen, there's
[42:31] never been a day like this day.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Never been a day to preach the gospel
[42:36] like this day. Never been a resistance
[42:40] and preaching the gospel like this day.
[42:43] I'm telling you right now, this is the
[42:46] climax. This is where Satan, this is, he
[42:49] doesn't want this to take place.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want this to take place. He
[42:56] doesn't want a bride to recognize who
[42:59] she is in this hour
[43:02] &gt;&gt; because then he's defeated.
[43:05] If he can keep you defeated, keep you
[43:07] blind, Amen. keep you from seeking the
[43:11] kingdom of God within you.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Never been a day like this day.
[43:20] Oh, hallelujah. Listen, I've been
[43:22] preaching for 25 years now.
[43:25] Amen. And I I I can look back and
[43:29] there's never been a time to preach the
[43:31] words like today.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's never been so hard like
[43:36] today.
[43:38] Never been so deceiving like today.
[43:40] Hallelujah. Never has the enemy fought
[43:43] like today, like he's fighting right
[43:45] now. Hallelujah. He's fighting our
[43:48] minds. Brother Brandham said he he said
[43:51] back then the devil's standing at each
[43:53] and every one of your minds tonight.
[43:56] Here lays doubt and here lays faith.
[44:00] Faith in what? And doubt in what? What?
[44:03] Not not necessarily what I'm saying.
[44:06] The spirit of God reveals truth. When
[44:09] the spirit of truth comes, it guides you
[44:11] and leads you into all truth. It's not
[44:13] that. It's who you are. Hallelujah. The
[44:18] word's coming forth time after time and
[44:22] is revealing who you are. The spirit is
[44:25] speaking who you are. And faith and
[44:27] death right there. That's where the
[44:30] devil's meeting you.
[44:32] So you don't recognize who you are.
[44:34] That's why some of us stay defeated.
[44:37] That's why things happen in our lives.
[44:39] We don't grow. We're stagnated. That's
[44:41] why we become lukewarm, stale.
[44:45] Amen. Our prayer life dies. All these
[44:47] things happen. Then we take on a
[44:49] religious form because we're in the
[44:51] message and I'm a believer. So, I got to
[44:53] keep a certain standard. So, you take on
[44:55] a a religious spirit upon you instead of
[44:59] the Holy Ghost.
[45:01] Instead of the Holy Ghost dealing with
[45:03] your life, taking control of your life,
[45:05] possessing your life, Amen. moving and
[45:08] leading and guiding you. Amen. Day by
[45:11] day,
[45:13] you stop overcoming
[45:16] all the work of the enemy.
[45:18] Hallelujah.
[45:20] Amen. This is not in my notes, but I'm
[45:22] just going to preach.
[45:24] Hallelujah.
[45:26] Amen. God is in control and he will
[45:29] speak and answer you. But if you come
[45:31] here with nothing at all or expecting
[45:35] nothing,
[45:37] you might have come here out of a
[45:39] religious tradition.
[45:41] God is real.
[45:43] God is active in a believer's life, a
[45:48] born again believer's life that's been
[45:50] awakened by the reality of his presence
[45:52] in this hour and what he is doing in his
[45:57] bride. We are here to expect him to
[46:02] continue to finish the work he started
[46:05] in us. Every time I come to service,
[46:08] every time I pray, every day I wake from
[46:13] that time 34 years ago that my awakening
[46:17] came, I expect every day for God to
[46:20] continue to finish that work
[46:24] that he started in me. Amen. I was born
[46:28] again for a purpose. You are born again
[46:30] for a purpose. Amen. You are born again
[46:33] to overcome
[46:35] &gt;&gt; and become what God made you to be in
[46:39] this hour. We are here to take a
[46:41] rapture. We are here to take a body
[46:43] change. We are here to possess the
[46:46] kingdom of God
[46:48] &gt;&gt; in flesh.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; We are here to get total victory.
[46:54] Amen. In this hour which will come by
[46:58] perfect faith. Amen.
[47:00] is already in the seed.
[47:03] Amen. Has that seed been awakened?
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. So everything is in
[47:08] the seed and the seed has been awakened.
[47:11] Hallelujah. Just being conscious of that
[47:14] keeps your life. Amen. Under under great
[47:18] expectation every day of your life for
[47:22] God.
[47:23] Oh hallelujah.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; We believe.
[47:29] We believe. I know. I I listen.
[47:34] I believe everybody in here believes.
[47:41] I believe that.
[47:43] It takes more than believing though.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Takes more than believing. That's why
[47:47] we're preaching the word of God. Amen.
[47:50] To press into the kingdom. Hallelujah.
[47:54] Amen.
[47:55] Listen, no man has to force you. You
[47:58] know, I I heard a preacher say one time,
[48:00] "You can preach until your tongue is
[48:02] hanging down, till you're blue in the
[48:03] face to somebody, and next thing you
[48:05] know, they just go right back out in the
[48:07] world."
[48:09] That has nothing to do with the preacher
[48:12] and and how many times you get
[48:14] ministered to over and over and over
[48:17] again. God speaks to you over and over
[48:20] and over again and then you fall right
[48:22] back into the same sin over and over
[48:25] again.
[48:27] You need to come conscious. You need to
[48:30] come first of all conscious of the
[48:32] cycles that are happening in your life
[48:35] that are taking place in your life. Then
[48:37] you need to come conscious. Hold on a
[48:39] minute. There must be sin which is
[48:41] unbelief in my life. Why I keep
[48:43] repeating the same cycle over and over
[48:46] again.
[48:50] Hallelujah.
[48:52] No man knows the things of God save the
[48:54] spirit of God. And he whom the spirit of
[48:58] God reveals it to them.
[49:01] We need to call on God for revelation.
[49:05] Brother Brandham said it. He said it
[49:07] clearly to the bride of Jesus Christ.
[49:10] Revelation means more to you than
[49:12] perhaps you realize. I'm saying it to
[49:15] you tonight. It means more to you than
[49:18] perhaps you realize. Hallelujah. It's
[49:21] your everything. Hallelujah. To put on
[49:24] this word and to overcome and to become
[49:26] the very image of Christ is revelation.
[49:30] Hallelujah.
[49:32] Amen.
[49:33] Thank you, Lord.
[49:36] We have accepted the Bible. We have
[49:38] accepted the great truths of it. But
[49:41] still, it's not real to most people.
[49:44] Brother Brandon speaking here because
[49:46] the revelation by the spirit is not
[49:48] there.
[49:50] The word has not been quickened. The
[49:53] Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:21
[49:57] that we have become the righteousness of
[50:00] our God by our union with Jesus Christ.
[50:04] Did you get it? It says that we are the
[50:09] very righteousness of God himself
[50:12] by being in Christ.
[50:15] Now we know the Bible says that it can't
[50:19] be denied but revelation of it is
[50:23] missing.
[50:26] Revelation of it is missing. Hallelujah.
[50:30] Right there something struck me.
[50:35] We have the message.
[50:37] We have the prophecies.
[50:40] We have the Bible.
[50:42] We can quote it over and over both
[50:46] scriptures and brother Brandham's
[50:48] quotes. Hallelujah. But he says without
[50:52] revelation he said we have all that but
[50:56] something is missing.
[51:00] Oh God.
[51:02] That's where the woman who cleaned her
[51:05] house, who lost that coin, swept out for
[51:09] that pearl of great price. She went and
[51:12] cleaned her house from top to bottom
[51:16] until she found that pearl of great
[51:18] price. That coin that she lost,
[51:23] my brothers and sisters, that's the
[51:26] kingdom.
[51:28] That's the kingdom come within us.
[51:31] These are all signs that God has given
[51:35] us in this hour to press into the
[51:37] kingdom,
[51:39] to press through in our lives.
[51:43] Are we awake? Do we understand?
[51:47] Hallelujah. That God has given the
[51:49] signs.
[51:51] Amen. That God is giving the clues here.
[51:54] Hallelujah. That God is showing the way.
[51:58] God is revealing something here.
[52:02] All you can do is take the word into
[52:04] your life. take it and go until it
[52:09] manifests in your life.
[52:12] That's always been the case with a true
[52:15] believer. When they when they receive a
[52:18] truth, in order for them to become that
[52:21] truth and for that truth to manifest in
[52:23] their life and for that truth to
[52:25] overcome inside of them, there got to be
[52:27] a pressing in. There's got to be a dying
[52:30] out.
[52:31] There's got to be something inside of
[52:33] you that is hunger and thirsting to
[52:36] receive that, to experience that, for it
[52:39] to become real, a real manifestation in
[52:42] your life.
[52:44] Hallelujah.
[52:46] Glory to God. But that but the
[52:50] revelation of it is missing. It is not
[52:52] real to the majority of God's children.
[52:55] Think about it.
[52:58] I believe to the bride of Jesus Christ
[53:01] in this hour. That's the only thing
[53:03] that's becoming real to her. Hallelujah.
[53:07] Amen. It is just as good verse in the
[53:10] Bible. But we need to have it made alive
[53:13] to us.
[53:15] That will take revelation. Brother
[53:18] Brandon speaking here. The revelation of
[53:19] Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah.
[53:23] Glory to God.
[53:25] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[53:28] The new birth is Christ.
[53:33] The new birth is Christ. It's not just
[53:37] an experience. It's not the gifts of the
[53:40] Holy Ghost. It's not healing. It's not
[53:43] all these things that Pentecostal can
[53:46] can produce. Amen. It's the token. Amen.
[53:51] This is the evening time where the token
[53:54] must be on display. That's why he said
[53:57] in the token message, you must have the
[53:59] token because that is what's required
[54:02] the word to manifest in this hour.
[54:07] Hallelujah.
[54:08] Amen.
[54:10] So the new birth is the token in this
[54:12] hour. It's the life of Christ. The very
[54:16] life of Christ. Not Christ in part but
[54:20] Christ in whole. Where the bride and the
[54:23] bride and groom become one. In the same
[54:26] where the scripture is fulfilled, a
[54:28] husband and a wife become one. That is a
[54:31] mystery. But God is speaking to the
[54:33] church and his bride.
[54:37] Hallelujah.
[54:40] Amen. I'm not worried about becoming one
[54:42] with my wife, taking that scripture
[54:45] literally and becoming one with my wife.
[54:48] I'm I'm I'm worried about becoming one
[54:50] with Christ. I want her to become one
[54:52] with Christ. Me to become one with
[54:54] Christ. Amen. Christ joins everything
[54:57] together in him. Hallelujah. Not in us.
[55:02] Amen.
[55:04] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[55:08] Amen. God has revealed to you this great
[55:11] mystery. Amen. This is a great mystery.
[55:15] God has revealed it to the bride in this
[55:17] hour. Amen. The mystery of what? The
[55:21] kingdom. The mystery that God and man
[55:24] are becoming one again. The mystery that
[55:27] the bride is incarnating the token in
[55:31] this hour. That the bride has the
[55:33] rapture manifesting in her life. The
[55:36] mystery.
[55:38] Oh, it's a mystery to a lot of people
[55:40] still in this message. Amen. They read
[55:44] the quotes. They read everything. They
[55:46] listen to the tapes. But it's still a
[55:48] mystery until he comes and opens it up.
[55:51] Hallelujah. I remember listening to
[55:53] Christ is the mystery of of God being
[55:56] revealed. Amen.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; And listening to that, I listened to it
[55:59] many times, but one time I listened to
[56:01] it
[56:03] and all I heard I listened from
[56:06] beginning to end. It's a couple hours
[56:07] long. I listened from beginning to end.
[56:09] And you know, all I seen was so simple.
[56:12] It was that he was inside of me.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; That I and him are one and the same in
[56:18] this hour. That Christ come to dwell
[56:20] inside of me. He was that whole message.
[56:24] I I don't even know if if the words that
[56:26] I was hearing was actually coming out of
[56:28] the prophet's mouth. That's how
[56:30] supernatural it was. It was just God
[56:32] speaking about our relationship.
[56:35] Amen. Our relationship, mine and his
[56:38] relationship. Christ is the mystery of
[56:41] God revealed. Amen. The bride is the
[56:44] mystery of Christ revealed in this hour.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; You are that mystery being revealed.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[56:52] Glory to God. Amen. I'm going to put my
[56:55] amen up here if I don't start hearing
[56:57] amen. Second boy.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Don't let the devil
[57:02] shut your mouth. Say amen. Say glory.
[57:06] Say hallelujah. Oh, brothers. Quiet in
[57:09] here. You're the one. You're not
[57:11] participating. You're a spectator.
[57:14] Participate. Amen.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe it'll shake that tiredness
[57:20] off of you, that carnality off of you,
[57:23] that problem that's on your mind right
[57:25] now that you can't shake.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. God, the devil will give you a
[57:30] problem that you can't shake. And you
[57:32] bring it into the house of the Lord. And
[57:34] here you are trying to shake it all
[57:35] night. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[57:38] Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Then you'll shake it.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. I come up here with pain in my
[57:43] body. Praise God. I'm coming to preach
[57:45] the word of God.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:49] Amen.
[57:50] Glory to God.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. Wait for the
[57:56] preacher to stir you up. Oh, this
[57:58] brother is going to come and shake me
[57:59] and stir me. He puts chills all down my
[58:02] body and all through my bones and
[58:04] hallelujah. Then I'm going to praise the
[58:06] Lord.
[58:08] You need to be born again. You're born
[58:11] again. You come with the kingdom of God
[58:12] inside of you. The kingdom of God is
[58:14] inside of you. Stirring inside of you.
[58:16] Is speaking inside of you. He's the one
[58:18] that gets you excited.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he's stirring in your
[58:22] life and moving in your life. Look what
[58:25] he's done. Look what he's done in your
[58:28] life. Look where he's brought you from.
[58:31] Look where you could have been tonight.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. is him. And not only that, he
[58:38] saved you in the flesh. He's delivered
[58:40] you and healed you in the flesh. But
[58:42] your soul is feeding on heavenly mana.
[58:45] Amen. Your soul's feeding on the kingdom
[58:47] of God tonight.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Oh God, revelation is coming to you that
[58:52] you and the father are one and the same.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; That you were in his mind before the
[58:57] foundation of the world. You see all
[58:59] these quotes, they just become quotes.
[59:01] It has become you know before the
[59:03] foundation of the world God thought of
[59:05] you in his mind. Hallelujah. My brothers
[59:09] and sisters all these things become all
[59:12] quotes. But let me tell you when it
[59:14] becomes real to you. Hallelujah. When
[59:17] you know that you were in the mind of
[59:19] God that you experienced God. Amen. You
[59:22] know God is speaking to you and he's
[59:24] saying you're mine. I knew you before
[59:26] the foundation of the world. I loved
[59:28] you. I'm the one that called you. I'm
[59:31] the one that was there at this time,
[59:32] that time of your life. I'm the one that
[59:34] spoke to you. I'm the one that delivered
[59:36] you.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; It changes everything, my brothers and
[59:39] sisters.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; You don't need nobody to tell you to
[59:43] praise God. Hallelujah. You'll praise
[59:46] him anyway.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; You don't need that Jones beside you
[59:49] because Mrs. Jones is not praising God.
[59:52] I don't have to praise God if Mrs. Jones
[59:54] not praising God. Hallelujah.
[59:57] I'm not talking about working up
[59:59] emotions and that stuff. I'm talking to
[1:00:01] the sons and daughters of God here
[1:00:03] tonight. Are we sons and daughters of
[1:00:04] God?
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. I'll
[1:00:12] praise him anyways. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:00:15] Brother Tim sits over there. Most of the
[1:00:17] time, you know, he gets all excited and
[1:00:19] this and that. Yes, I'm going to get
[1:00:20] excited. Brother Desmond's up there
[1:00:22] smiling, getting excited. Brother
[1:00:24] Phillips praising God over there. Amen.
[1:00:26] and we're sitting here praising God. Why
[1:00:28] shouldn't we praise the Lord?
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:32] He gave us a message. He gave us a word
[1:00:35] of God. He gave us his prophet in these
[1:00:39] last days.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; And he gave us precious, precious
[1:00:43] promises. I will never leave you. I will
[1:00:47] never forsake you, but I'll be with you
[1:00:49] and in you to the end of time. I'm
[1:00:52] trying to get to my message, my brothers
[1:00:53] and sisters, but there's got to be a
[1:00:55] level of unbelief broken before it can
[1:00:58] come through. Amen.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Hallelujah.
[1:01:02] Amen.
[1:01:03] Amen.
[1:01:06] Amen. Let me read a few things here.
[1:01:09] to enlighten.
[1:01:11] The phrase the kingdom of God has come
[1:01:13] within man suggests that the kingdom is
[1:01:16] not a future physical place but is a
[1:01:21] present spiritual reality that exists
[1:01:24] within the bride.
[1:01:26] Hallelujah.
[1:01:28] Amen.
[1:01:30] It can be interpreted in several ways.
[1:01:31] God's kingdom is a spiritual reality in
[1:01:35] the hearts of believers. It is a present
[1:01:38] in the midst of people through the
[1:01:40] bride's ministry, the revealed word of
[1:01:43] this hour. Or it has within reach
[1:01:47] through the token life that is
[1:01:49] manifested in his bride. Hallelujah.
[1:01:52] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:01:55] The Bible says, "Behold."
[1:01:57] Amen. Behold. The word behold is a
[1:02:01] command to play to pay close attention.
[1:02:07] That's what our life should be. That's
[1:02:09] what our walk should be spiritually
[1:02:13] speaking. Pay close attention.
[1:02:16] Amen. Are you conscious of God? Are you
[1:02:19] aware of God every wicked moment of your
[1:02:21] life? Because I'm telling you one thing.
[1:02:24] Hallelujah. God is moving around you
[1:02:26] every single day, every moment of your
[1:02:29] life. Even sometimes he wakes you up in
[1:02:32] the middle of the night and he speaks to
[1:02:34] you. He never leaves you. He never
[1:02:37] forsakes you.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Play close attention.
[1:02:43] Meaning look, see spiritually speaking
[1:02:47] or gaze upon something with awe.
[1:02:52] Oh, hallelujah. with awe. Does this word
[1:02:55] still awe you? Does this revelation
[1:02:58] still awe you? Oh my. When I was hearing
[1:03:01] the word of God Sunday, I don't know
[1:03:03] about you, but it was all in me.
[1:03:07] Hallelujah.
[1:03:09] God was speaking lip to ear to me.
[1:03:12] Hallelujah. I have adopted you. Amen. I
[1:03:15] have called you. I predestinated you.
[1:03:17] Amen. Oh, you're going to overcome.
[1:03:20] Amen.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. I'm going to give you
[1:03:23] the faith that you're going to need in
[1:03:25] the time that you need it and you're
[1:03:27] going to overcome.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Nothing is going to touch you.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; I won't allow anything to come into your
[1:03:33] life. I won't give you anything more
[1:03:35] than what you can handle.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; I know. I've designed your life. Listen,
[1:03:41] Satan has no control over us.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; He doesn't own this property.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; God has redeemed it and bought it back.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ. Do we believe
[1:03:52] the blood of Jesus Christ?
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; He has no control over us tonight.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; So why don't you cast him out?
[1:04:00] Even you mature believers, cast them
[1:04:04] out. Cast the fear out. Cast the doubt
[1:04:08] out tonight. He has no control over the
[1:04:11] kingdom of God. The kingdom of God has
[1:04:13] come. It's his kingdom.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; It's his kingdom in us. Amen.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:21] Didn't he say,
[1:04:23] "I've given you power."
[1:04:26] Hallelujah.
[1:04:28] Amen.
[1:04:30] With appreciation and understanding
[1:04:33] draws an audience focus
[1:04:37] to every message and every divine
[1:04:39] revelation. Behold,
[1:04:42] to you. Behold,
[1:04:44] God's speaking to you. A man can't give
[1:04:46] you revelation.
[1:04:49] When you catch a revelation, that's God.
[1:04:51] The kingdom behold unto you.
[1:04:55] Hallelujah. Behold, the kingdom is for
[1:04:57] you. God speaking to you. Hallelujah.
[1:05:01] What it is spiritually meaning
[1:05:04] the word behold to look to see something
[1:05:08] and behold means to look and see
[1:05:10] something of importance. Behold, or the
[1:05:13] variation of this word appears 1,500
[1:05:17] times in the Old Testament and 200 times
[1:05:19] in the New Testament. At its core,
[1:05:22] redemption means regaining, restoring
[1:05:25] something that was lost or overlaps with
[1:05:29] concepts like rescue, recovery,
[1:05:31] deliverance, and atonement.
[1:05:35] But in the biblical sense, redemption is
[1:05:38] God's act of freeing his people from
[1:05:40] bondage. whether to slavery, to sin, or
[1:05:43] death through his cross. Now, when a man
[1:05:50] hallelujah, I won't even get through a
[1:05:53] lot of this. We'll have to go to part
[1:05:54] two. But when a man in the beginning was
[1:05:58] made him superior to anything on earth,
[1:06:02] he gave him jurisdiction of everything
[1:06:05] on earth to control everything. He
[1:06:08] controlled the animal life. He
[1:06:10] controlled the fowl life, the fish, the
[1:06:12] sea, the winds. He controlled the planet
[1:06:15] life. He controlled everything. Man was
[1:06:18] made as a secondary God on earth.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; He was given the power to control all
[1:06:24] things.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Now listen, type it in what we're
[1:06:27] speaking here tonight. Hallelujah. This
[1:06:30] is the kingdom.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; All things. All elements of the earth
[1:06:35] that was in Adam. Adam was given these
[1:06:37] great powers. Then the power that was
[1:06:41] given to make his choice is where he
[1:06:44] fell. And because he had free moral
[1:06:47] agency, we all have free moral agency.
[1:06:49] And Adam could speak to the winds and it
[1:06:51] would stop. He could speak to the trees
[1:06:54] and they would obey him. He could speak
[1:06:56] to the wildlife and they would obey him.
[1:06:58] He could speak to the waters
[1:07:00] and it was everything obeyed Adam. And
[1:07:04] then the f the fall came.
[1:07:08] that he lost everything.
[1:07:12] We know that. Amen. We're clear on that.
[1:07:16] But what happened?
[1:07:18] Was there a restoration
[1:07:21] to all things?
[1:07:23] Christ redeemed it all back. He bought
[1:07:25] it all back for us.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; So now when we when we look at this, we
[1:07:31] can look at that and say, "Adam can
[1:07:33] speak to the winds."
[1:07:36] You can speak to the winds.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Adam stopped and he spoke to the trees.
[1:07:42] You can speak to the trees. You can
[1:07:44] speak to your situations. You can speak
[1:07:46] to your problems.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; You can speak to everything in your life
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; if you truly believe it's been restored
[1:07:52] back
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:58] Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:08:01] Hallelujah. Just going to skip over a
[1:08:03] few things here. Amen.
[1:08:07] Hallelujah.
[1:08:09] Thank you, Lord. The breach
[1:08:13] between the church ages and the in the
[1:08:16] seven seals. Now he has the title deed
[1:08:19] of to redemption. He has it in his hand.
[1:08:24] Mediation is done now. He has it in his
[1:08:28] own hand. Remember, it's been in the
[1:08:30] hands of God all the time, but now it's
[1:08:33] in the hands of the lamb. Now, watch the
[1:08:36] title deed of redemption of all creation
[1:08:40] is in his hands. And he come to claim it
[1:08:43] back for the human race. For you. For
[1:08:46] you.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Not claim it back for angels.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Claim it back to the human race.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; For you. Amen.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Which it was given for to make sons and
[1:08:57] daughters of God again.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not church members, not
[1:09:02] religious people. To make sons and
[1:09:04] daughters
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; again in this hour.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; He gave it and claimed it and gave it
[1:09:11] back to you. It's given back to us
[1:09:14] tonight. Amen. The title deed, the
[1:09:17] authority, the control.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:21] given back to us tonight.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:09:30] Amen.
[1:09:32] And until in this last day, there is
[1:09:36] again another people in the land who
[1:09:39] under their message will be the final
[1:09:42] voice to the final age.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:48] Amen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation 17, the spirit and the
[1:09:53] bride say come.
[1:09:57] This message has got to come to you and
[1:09:59] me. It's got to identify you and me in
[1:10:02] the scriptures.
[1:10:04] Hallelujah.
[1:10:06] Once more the world will hear directly
[1:10:09] from God.
[1:10:12] Where
[1:10:14] where were she? Where will the world
[1:10:17] according to the prophet
[1:10:19] hear directly from God again? By the
[1:10:22] tapes.
[1:10:27] The tapes are for the bride of Jesus
[1:10:29] Christ to receive the word. Like the
[1:10:32] angel came to Mary and and told her,
[1:10:35] "You're going to conceive." Mary said to
[1:10:37] the tapes, "Be it unto me according to
[1:10:40] thy word." And then Mary went out. She
[1:10:42] didn't keep pressing play, play, play.
[1:10:45] She started producing, producing until
[1:10:48] she gave birth to the son of God.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:54] Hallelujah.
[1:10:56] Okay.
[1:10:58] 17. Revelation. The spirit and the bride
[1:11:00] say, "Come once more. The world will
[1:11:03] heal directly from God." Oh, God still
[1:11:05] has a voice
[1:11:07] for the people of the world.
[1:11:11] Even as it has given a voice to the
[1:11:13] bride.
[1:11:16] This is the prophet speaking here. Leo
[1:11:19] and churches.
[1:11:23] You see that voice
[1:11:26] he's saying is in the bride
[1:11:31] today.
[1:11:33] You see what these movements are doing?
[1:11:36] blind the people,
[1:11:39] blind them from recognizing who they
[1:11:42] are. What is the greatest quote that
[1:11:45] brother Brad said about the bride of
[1:11:46] Jesus Christ and the greatest um
[1:11:51] accomplishment or you want to say it? I
[1:11:53] don't the word is but the greatest thing
[1:11:55] that the bride will overcome is to
[1:11:58] recognize who she is. When she
[1:12:00] recognizes who she is, she'll be
[1:12:02] invincible. So, the devil is going to
[1:12:04] throw everything. The serpent snuck
[1:12:07] right into the message. He's going to
[1:12:09] throw everything. He's going to take the
[1:12:11] same quotes. He's going to take the same
[1:12:14] prophet's message. He's going to take it
[1:12:17] and put a delusion, put a smokec screen,
[1:12:20] a veil blindness on the people for what?
[1:12:24] That she doesn't recognize who she is.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Yep. That's it.
[1:12:29] She
[1:12:31] is the voice of God according to the
[1:12:34] prophet. The world will hear one more
[1:12:38] time from God by the voice of the bride
[1:12:41] of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; That's what the scriptures say. That's
[1:12:45] what brother Brandham is saying here.
[1:12:49] Anything that comes against the word of
[1:12:52] God. Amen. Anything that came against
[1:12:57] look at today
[1:13:00] everybody Jesus was a good man. These
[1:13:03] statements are made for a reason. Jesus
[1:13:06] was a good prophet
[1:13:09] but the son of God.
[1:13:11] You see you see that devil?
[1:13:15] Oh yeah. Oh you're a good believer.
[1:13:19] You press play.
[1:13:22] You quote the prophet.
[1:13:24] You quote the Bible. You come to church
[1:13:26] regularly. You do your religious duties.
[1:13:29] You do all your works.
[1:13:36] Think about it, saints. But the devil
[1:13:39] will allow you to do all those things.
[1:13:42] But when you come to recognize, hold on
[1:13:44] a minute.
[1:13:46] No, this is not what this is not what
[1:13:50] the prophet was sent for. This is not
[1:13:52] what it's all about. This is not what I
[1:13:54] feel in my heart.
[1:13:57] This is not my conviction in my life.
[1:13:59] This is not what God is speaking to me.
[1:14:03] Something different than what is being
[1:14:05] said out there. Hallelujah. And that's
[1:14:09] where the bride has to stand in this
[1:14:11] last hour to speak the word of God of
[1:14:14] who she is. Amen. And let me try to
[1:14:16] close it off here.
[1:14:18] Hallelujah.
[1:14:20] There's so much more I can say, but
[1:14:22] we're just going to put it into another
[1:14:24] message.
[1:14:26] The bride is born again with the power
[1:14:28] and authority and his character. With
[1:14:32] the spoken word in us, and we speak by
[1:14:35] his spirit,
[1:14:37] everything in us by the new birth will
[1:14:40] restore what was lost. when we overcome
[1:14:45] in our lives. Hallelujah.
[1:14:48] Amen.
[1:14:50] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:14:52] If a man says he's born again and tries
[1:14:56] to place these promises of Christ in the
[1:14:59] last days to some other age,
[1:15:02] think about it, some other age.
[1:15:06] Do you realize
[1:15:09] that movement that's going on?
[1:15:14] is another age.
[1:15:16] It's putting people in a delusion of
[1:15:18] another age.
[1:15:22] The promises that have been spoken in
[1:15:24] the message are for today, for the bride
[1:15:26] to manifest,
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; not for another age.
[1:15:32] Hallelujah.
[1:15:34] Making him Christ yesterday. Oh, always
[1:15:37] looking back to what he did yesterday.
[1:15:40] Isn't that what is is coming? 60s
[1:15:42] something years since the prophet is
[1:15:43] gone
[1:15:45] and and people are looking back and
[1:15:47] still telling stories about the prophet.
[1:15:49] I like them too,
[1:15:51] but that ain't going to that ain't going
[1:15:53] to do what you know Christ wants to do
[1:15:55] in my life by looking at the stories,
[1:16:00] quoting
[1:16:01] I sit down with people all the time
[1:16:05] and you can see in their spirit. You can
[1:16:07] understand the Holy Ghost inside of you
[1:16:09] knows where they're at. I'm not judging
[1:16:12] people.
[1:16:14] The word judges, not me. I don't judge.
[1:16:17] The word judges. I'm just part of the
[1:16:19] word. So I can see that that that
[1:16:22] manifestation, that discernment.
[1:16:25] And they think it's all about quoting
[1:16:27] brother Brandham. It's all about
[1:16:28] understanding the mysteries. And the
[1:16:30] Bible teaches us clearly.
[1:16:33] You can have all the mysteries. You can
[1:16:35] have all this, all that, all this, all
[1:16:37] that. But if you don't have love,
[1:16:38] perfect love, you have nothing.
[1:16:45] Hallelujah.
[1:16:47] Making him yesterday.
[1:16:53] Quoting, quoting, quoting.
[1:16:56] Now I can understand where Jesus says
[1:16:59] they'll come to me in that day. Lord,
[1:17:02] Lord, I was in the message. I believe
[1:17:05] God sent a prophet. I quoted, I quote it
[1:17:08] every day of my life.
[1:17:11] He said, "Depart from me. I didn't even
[1:17:12] know you.
[1:17:14] You workers of iniquity." Iniquity is
[1:17:17] what? Knowing.
[1:17:19] Listen, God is going to speak to every
[1:17:21] single one that comes by this message.
[1:17:24] He's going to speak to everyone,
[1:17:26] everyone's heart,
[1:17:28] whether they go this way or they go that
[1:17:30] way. He's going to speak to every heart
[1:17:34] and reveal to them the truth.
[1:17:40] But it's the way that they go, the way
[1:17:41] that they choose. Amen.
[1:17:46] Now listen. He says when you're doing
[1:17:48] that making Christ yesterday and not
[1:17:52] today in the bride,
[1:17:54] he says that man or that person has been
[1:17:58] under a delusion by Satan.
[1:18:05] By Satan in this message. A delusion.
[1:18:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let me just find
[1:18:13] something here to close her off.
[1:18:16] Hallelujah. There's so much more I can
[1:18:18] say. I want to talk about overcoming a
[1:18:20] little bit more, but I want to just lay
[1:18:22] in this quickly of who you are. Amen.
[1:18:27] Give me five minutes.
[1:18:30] Hallelujah. You throw aside everything.
[1:18:32] Open up that channel and say, "God, your
[1:18:35] word is eternally true and it's for me."
[1:18:37] If the whole church fails, the whole
[1:18:39] message, if the whole world fails, yet I
[1:18:43] cannot fail.
[1:18:45] That's your faith tonight.
[1:18:48] Hallelujah. Because I'm taking your
[1:18:50] word, the revelation. There's the
[1:18:52] battle. That's the great thing. Now,
[1:18:54] remember this. Christ in the true church
[1:18:57] is a continuation of the book of Acts.
[1:19:00] Hallelujah. But the book of Revelation
[1:19:02] shows that the Antichrist spirit will
[1:19:03] try to come into the church. the message
[1:19:08] and would come in and and try to defile
[1:19:11] it. Make it lukewarm, formal, and
[1:19:12] powerless. That's what it's doing. Oh,
[1:19:16] just calm down. You're believers.
[1:19:19] Just take it easy. You believe the
[1:19:21] message. You You know, you believe God
[1:19:23] sent a prophet. Take No, no. That's not
[1:19:25] for the bride. Hallelujah. The bride is
[1:19:28] on fire.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. She's not calming down. She's not
[1:19:32] cooling down. Amen. for nobody.
[1:19:34] Hallelujah. And and yeah, she's going to
[1:19:37] become a a fanatic. She's going to look
[1:19:38] crazy to people. Like Paul said, the way
[1:19:41] that I worship God, you got you call
[1:19:43] crazy. Listen, people in this message
[1:19:45] are going to call the bride, the true
[1:19:46] bride of Jesus Christ. When God shows
[1:19:48] her off, God's going to manifest through
[1:19:50] her. Hallelujah. And who's going to see
[1:19:52] her more than anybody? The message is
[1:19:54] going to see her. Hallelujah. Amen. The
[1:19:57] true church is a continuation of the
[1:19:59] book of Acts. Amen. Hallelujah. Making
[1:20:01] it work lukewarm. Amen. intent
[1:20:02] destruction on God's discrediting God's
[1:20:04] word right down to the time he's cast in
[1:20:06] the lake of fire. He fights that. He
[1:20:07] cannot stand it. He knows that if the
[1:20:09] people get a true revelation of the true
[1:20:11] church and what she is, what she stands
[1:20:13] for and what she can do, the greater
[1:20:16] works,
[1:20:17] she'll be an invincible army. He hates
[1:20:20] that. That's what the devil's fighting
[1:20:23] tonight. And every night that we come
[1:20:26] into the house of God, every time you
[1:20:28] consecrate and dedicate yourself.
[1:20:31] Hallelujah.
[1:20:33] Amen. Let's come musicians.
[1:20:37] Amen.
[1:20:40] Hallelujah.
[1:20:42] John 5:19.
[1:20:45] This is not finished. I just going to
[1:20:46] have to brush over a few things and then
[1:20:51] re re redo it.
[1:20:54] This harmony now exists between the
[1:20:57] groom and his bride.
[1:20:59] Now this is a reality now.
[1:21:03] He shows her his word of life, the
[1:21:06] token.
[1:21:08] She receives it. She never doubts it.
[1:21:11] Therefore, nothing can harm her, not
[1:21:13] even death.
[1:21:15] Death, where is your sting? You can't
[1:21:18] die.
[1:21:23] The fear of death Satan's still putting
[1:21:25] on believers.
[1:21:27] For if the seed be planted and watered,
[1:21:29] God will raise it up again. Here's the
[1:21:31] secret of this. Now listen, this is the
[1:21:34] prophet here. Here's the secret of this.
[1:21:37] The word is in the bride
[1:21:40] as it was in Mary.
[1:21:43] Oh. Oh, sorry. Let me The word is in the
[1:21:46] tapes.
[1:21:50] The word is in the bride.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; What are you trying to say, brother Tim?
[1:21:57] When you make that statement over and
[1:21:59] over,
[1:22:01] the word is inside of you.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; It's a living word. What does living
[1:22:06] mean? It means a substance
[1:22:11] that has life.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; That has life. It has a nature. It has a
[1:22:15] character.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:19] nature.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; It's God, Christ, that wants to live his
[1:22:22] life, his character, his nature through
[1:22:24] you.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; The devil's trying to stop that.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; He's trying to stop that and prevent
[1:22:32] that from happening inside of you.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; That's why he's using the word like he
[1:22:38] did with Eve in the beginning. He took
[1:22:40] the word. Has not God said? Has not the
[1:22:44] prophet said?
[1:22:48] Think about it.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:22:51] The bride has the mind of Christ. The
[1:22:54] bride does.
[1:22:56] For she knows what he wants done with
[1:22:59] the word.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; She performs the commandments of the
[1:23:06] word in his name. For she listen for she
[1:23:12] not the tapes. For she has thus sayaeth
[1:23:15] the Lord.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Maybe you'll catch a glimpse of this. I
[1:23:22] don't know.
[1:23:26] She has thus sayeth the Lord. When the
[1:23:30] word is quickened by the spirit and it
[1:23:32] comes to pass like a seed that is
[1:23:34] planted by the water, it comes to full
[1:23:37] harvest serving its purpose. Listen, I'm
[1:23:40] going to finish this off and then that's
[1:23:41] it. Those in the bride do only his will.
[1:23:45] No one can make her do otherwise.
[1:23:48] Oh brother, this brother told me this
[1:23:51] that no one no one can make her do
[1:23:54] otherwise
[1:23:56] when he has come.
[1:24:00] They have thus sayaeth the Lord or they
[1:24:04] keep still.
[1:24:06] They know that it has to be God in them
[1:24:10] that
[1:24:13] doing the works, fulfilling his own
[1:24:15] word.
[1:24:17] He did not complete all his works while
[1:24:21] he was here on his earthly ministry.
[1:24:24] Even the prophet, he even said himself,
[1:24:28] I finished my part, but now Christ and
[1:24:31] the bride's part has to come.
[1:24:35] Now he works in and through the bride.
[1:24:40] She knows that.
[1:24:42] She knows that.
[1:24:45] Hallelujah. She knows that.
[1:24:48] For it is for it was not yet time for
[1:24:52] him.
[1:24:54] Hallelujah. To do certain things that
[1:24:57] must be done now. Certain things in the
[1:25:00] word that has been prophesied must be
[1:25:03] done now.
[1:25:05] [Music]
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; It's her
[1:25:10] and him
[1:25:12] become in one. Behold the kingdom of God
[1:25:17] is within the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:25:19] tonight.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Behold the kingdom.
[1:25:24] Amen. Here, right here tonight. Behold
[1:25:28] the kingdom of God.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; And he's our king.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; He's our king.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's stand.
[1:25:39] There's so much more I can say, but
[1:25:42] that's it for tonight.
[1:25:44] Hallelujah.
[1:25:47] We'll continue it.
[1:25:49] Oh, glory to God.
[1:25:52] Behold the kingdom of God.
[1:25:56] Oh, back in the days of Jesus.
[1:25:59] Here was the kingdom of God,
[1:26:01] he come to die so he can give us his
[1:26:06] life, give us the Holy Ghost, change and
[1:26:09] transform us, redeem us, all the things
[1:26:12] that you know that he came to do. And
[1:26:15] here he was on earth.
[1:26:19] And they say, "Master, tell us. Show us
[1:26:22] a sign.
[1:26:24] [Music]
[1:26:26] Show us a sign when the kingdom's
[1:26:29] coming." You know, people, show us a
[1:26:32] great preacher. Show us a great camp
[1:26:34] meeting. Show us a great movement of God
[1:26:38] in this message. Show us a sign.
[1:26:41] And we'll believe that the kingdom is
[1:26:43] here.
[1:26:45] Some believe in Brother Brandham's
[1:26:47] coming back. All kinds of beliefs out
[1:26:50] there. He has to ride the trail again.
[1:26:53] Show us a sign that the kingdom is here.
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:26:59] But Jesus said to him,
[1:27:02] "The kingdom has come.
[1:27:05] Behold,
[1:27:07] your eyes are seeing the kingdom of
[1:27:09] God."
[1:27:11] Hallelujah. The word of God tonight is
[1:27:15] saying the same thing. Behold, the
[1:27:17] kingdom is here.
[1:27:20] This inside of you,
[1:27:23] this new birth inside of you,
[1:27:26] this experiences that you got with God
[1:27:30] all these years,
[1:27:33] this voice that's been speaking to you,
[1:27:36] leading you to the word, leading to who
[1:27:39] you are, is the kingdom of God inside of
[1:27:43] you.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:46] Behold, the kingdom
[1:27:49] has come.
[1:27:51] My brothers and sisters,
[1:27:53] the time is coming.
[1:27:56] The time is at hand.
[1:28:00] Man ain't going to do it,
[1:28:03] but God is going to do it.
[1:28:06] What he's been putting inside of her,
[1:28:09] the true bride, all these years. Amen.
[1:28:13] what he's been quickening inside of her,
[1:28:17] he's going to bring it to full maturity
[1:28:19] very soon. Hallelujah.
[1:28:23] Very soon, things in your life, you're
[1:28:26] going to overcome.
[1:28:28] Very soon, things are going to drop off
[1:28:30] of you. Very soon, deliverances that you
[1:28:34] need, changes that you need are going to
[1:28:36] come
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; because that's his promise. That's his
[1:28:39] word in this hour.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:43] Not all has been fulfilled yet, but
[1:28:46] there's still a great move of God that's
[1:28:49] going to take place to fulfill all what
[1:28:51] he has spoken through a prophet in these
[1:28:53] days.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Behold, the kingdom is here.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; The kingdom has come within men.
[1:29:01] Hallelujah. And when you behold
[1:29:05] that the kingdom is inside of you,
[1:29:08] let the kingdom come. Let thy will be
[1:29:11] done on earth as it is in heaven. Give
[1:29:15] me this day. Give me this day my
[1:29:18] revelation. Give me the word of God. My
[1:29:21] portion, Lord.
[1:29:23] [Music]
[1:29:26] So now I
[1:29:30] can speak his word
[1:29:33] and become that full manifestation.
[1:29:35] Amen. If this is not what this is all
[1:29:38] about,
[1:29:39] my brothers and sisters,
[1:29:42] then what is it about?
[1:29:46] This is what it's all about. The token
[1:29:49] must
[1:29:51] be on display.
[1:29:53] The life of Christ must
[1:29:56] deny. He can't lie. And God has spoken
[1:29:59] it. He can't lie. There's going to be a
[1:30:02] bride.
[1:30:03] There's going to be one without spot or
[1:30:05] wrinkle. There's going to be an
[1:30:07] overcomer that's going to overcome
[1:30:09] everything. I'm going to overcome
[1:30:10] everything. You're going to overcome
[1:30:11] everything.
[1:30:13] Everything that Satan puts before you.
[1:30:17] Everything that the word of God is
[1:30:19] inside of you, anything gets in the way
[1:30:22] of that, you're going to overcome it.
[1:30:25] You're going to be victorious.
[1:30:27] Unbelief never hinders God and never
[1:30:29] will hinder God.
[1:30:31] But I have spoken it. I will perform it,
[1:30:34] sayeth the Lord. Father, bless your word
[1:30:37] to your people, Lord. Only you can
[1:30:39] reveal these things. Father, the kingdom
[1:30:43] has come. God and man are one and the
[1:30:47] same. Again, the bride and the
[1:30:49] bridegroom
[1:30:51] are one and the same. Again, I believe
[1:30:55] the message, Father, not because I can
[1:30:57] read it or I can quote it. I believe the
[1:31:00] message inside the message. There's a
[1:31:02] message inside of it for the bride of
[1:31:04] Jesus Christ. And that message is
[1:31:07] directly from you to her.
[1:31:10] [Music]
[1:31:12] You to her.
[1:31:16] I love you. I've called you. You're
[1:31:19] mine.
[1:31:21] Bless each and everyone. Each one that
[1:31:24] would hear online.
[1:31:27] Father, if we need to repent, we got any
[1:31:30] of these spirits on us. Father,
[1:31:33] you said, Lord,
[1:31:35] in my name, you'll cast out devils.
[1:31:37] Father, let everyone leave.
[1:31:40] Every son and daughter of God be set
[1:31:42] free by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:31:44] tonight.
[1:31:45] Have your way in each heart, Lord.
[1:31:48] In Jesus Christ's name we pray. God
[1:31:50] bless you, saints.
[1:31:54] I work.
[1:31:58] His word is working mightily
[1:32:02] in me.
[1:32:05] His word is working mightily in me.
[1:32:10] [Music]
[1:32:11] No matter what the circumstances,
[1:32:15] what I feel,
[1:32:18] his word is working mightily in me.
[1:32:24] Oh, his word is working mightily
[1:32:28] mightily.
[1:32:31] His words working mightily in me.
[1:32:37] No matter what the circumstances,
[1:32:41] what I feel, I'll see. His word is
[1:32:45] working mighty.
[1:32:50] His word is working mightily in me.
[1:32:57] His word is working.
[1:33:03] [Music]
[1:33:07] I feel
[1:33:09] his words working mightily.
[1:33:15] Hallelujah. How many enjoy that tonight?
[1:33:19] Kingdom of God is in us. Amen. You are
[1:33:21] dismissed.
[1:33:23] [Music]
[1:33:27] Yeah.
[1:33:31] Thy word have thy hidden in my heart.
[1:33:37] Thy word have thy hidden in my heart.
[1:33:43] Thy word has thou hidden in my heart
[1:33:49] that I might not sin against thee.
[1:33:56] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet.
[1:34:02] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet.
[1:34:08] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet
[1:34:14] and a light unto my heart's way.
[1:34:20] Thy word hast thou hidden in my heart.
[1:34:27] Thy word has thou hidden in my heart.
[1:34:33] Thy word have I hidden in my heart
[1:34:38] that I might not sin against thee.
[1:34:44] Thy word is a lamp onto my feet.
[1:34:51] Thy word is a lamp onto my feet.
[1:34:57] Thy word is a lamp onto my feet.
[1:35:03] And a light
[1:35:06] [Music]
