some kind of dilemma like that that amen I would say something sometimes it's hard to say thanks it's not easy to say thanks and it's already hard to give that in certain types of situation many of you know our brother from brother crock banker from Britain truth Tabernacle that's the brother who works in the night here comes people when he came home but even something eaten and he went there to rescue him together and then later that they go back to work together while he is resting the wife is on the phone talking to her mother or land and the moment window she must have seen her son by the pool which they have already empty their water and obviously she must be there talking falling flat on his face so the mother said was she's talking before and is the merciful but the story is that she and when she does that [Music] and there she Trump right beside the Sun now if you were to be here today give thanks Happy Thanksgiving it's not always easy to save you time or the state that's
