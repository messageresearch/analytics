TRANSCRIPT
========================================
love into a super situation grace pixel anybody grace grace is something that you receive that you don't deserve this you know so I understand this love that I'm talking about when you come into this bonding of Holy Ghost and you've done a revelation of God's love and respects respects it's very important when you've got that and you come in tonight that that bonding period for you are in the church and you're loving with your details your Trustees your fellow membership your Sunday School teachers your all these positions they heard that you're constantly working with it's just going and being you know told to do something now you're doing it by regulation it's completely different it changes everything in everything the lips of this world all the attitudes the anchors the bad feelings the past because you know what that's all amen almost ill feelings all those thoughts all those words that were spoken here son of God those are carnal things that have not entered into that place already perfect love complete entered into that place and so it sets you free from the bondage of humanity right you're human but you're a son dog first right when you come into that revelation you are a son of God before you came into this world and you're being restored back to that position look very love one another don't no matter what condemn attracts the city now that you're all one great big sweet route now but remember my warning see Satan hope that that stay that plane we don't realize me we look down on this but we looked at one when you get into your position when you start to act in your position seasons will thank you you gotta just know anything that's worth victory over is going to require something like so over time Helen but remember go behind CC won't let that stay that way no sir you shoot something just get the rest of the pole because it'll shoot something it B has to bring somebody in to make his target you see that's the way he works he works on people and he works on individuals to try to smoke them and make them his target let's move on so that's my something we've covered about LinkedIn the love of God that's what this was all about and when we move on but let us not forget that in the beginning when he smoked decided Adam you took something from the decide you might take him that he might take him a bride now he says here and I read this he took something from his side now the strength of Christ was for a cause that he might take for him one to be his family the drop here in the restoration period now what's being restored now is Eve Adam has been restored through the church ages the Bible talks about the Christ being the first one to tell the second one he now is restoring deep because remember the world and so right now what's happening so when his masterpiece was perfected baby had decided to take it from him not another piece not another creation but the same creation so you are not some thing that he created he took from himself remember we read from the beginning description so that he can bring back to yourself a church a bride and so my brother don't think back to this but think of it and he took from the debtor the original creation to make the bride friend he never made another creation he took a part of the original creation then if he was worth what must the bride be it's got to be the original word Living God in so in you now as you become a position as a circuit our God is being placed the supreme authority of God's Word because he has to give you that authority in order to complete the cycle so that us is because we are the ones now in this age that's actually we talked about this but this will never stop expanding that sparkle in our minds because it will be finishing spending around you but you as a son or daughter of God we need to work that's been placed a new place in you which is God's masterpiece now in the last days I'm using this in a pear pod on the bride the masterpiece that's coming forth there's a masterpiece that there's a masterpiece rising the masterpiece felt and I see our own after that I see a poem she's comfortable process but she's coming right back again to that masterpiece and that's what we were talking about through all those Church ages and that's what all those changes are important to understand where you've come from and now as as the super Church must accommodate and finish off this work you've got to talk to a man don't think you just a church pepper you could just come in here a week in week out just do your own little thing you've got to come in too perfectly in a position in the Word of God so that you can there's a minister that get into humans don't stir up the gift that he used of God don't let Toby enter don't let all these spear because this is a supernatural season now what we've got to do is set yourself aside and that goes for every officer every position in the church do dogs have wanted to get to perform what it needs to perform so there's a masterpiece no she's coming to a process but she's coming right back together to the masterpiece perfected a perfected masterpiece Eggman so she's a part of that word that was spoken by him you have a church without spot or wrinkle they will not be connected any way with any type of organization or denomination the first thing it's passed through through those such things but it will never be there you cannot be under the denomination and understand what's being you gotta come out you've got a tradition out of all those things that you thought the church should run this way the church should be run that way that's why you know this weekend's leadership was was more on God supernaturally transformed each and every one of us as servants we have servant leaders here not leaders that dictate we are leadership that's going to stand here and put our phone to the wheel with you and work with you and be examples for you you're going to do the things that we say we want you to do because this is about the bottom are you back together not coming into perfect harmony just like we were there in the amplified version there's a harmonious relationship that brings this body together and it becomes a super church it becomes a like things we try to penetrate you as a son or daughter of God because you belong to this church and here in your position and things from the outside or the trying to penetrate you and can try to get through the Ubu by a church body you can seven further questions in because God nation of this purpose is not just everywhere some of them I feel nothing some of them I thought my knees I don't understand it but I just know that it's not there's something just not doing that just looking to suck the life out of the body that's not the way works there's not your position you're doing your part and now it becomes you're doing your part of your part of that body these intelligence knows what the body needs and so it sets out the reinforces what needs to be said that something happens over here something happens over there but boots on the scene because it's his body its sons and daughters of doctor recognize their position that's a please Lord it's working nothing and you send up dangle a colony not send out the parvis [Music] I trusted the Word of God has been Minister to your heart this morning to that it just helped you in the problem Jesus Christ bless this planet will fulfill this purpose so it will change our attitudes next slide it will be the perfecting for the rapture that's what we're doing we're being perfected but at the same time not be surprised this this kind of preaching is going to know it's going to have an effect on your life it's gonna it's gonna start to deal with little aspects of your walk comparable you're talking your attitudes and the way that you look the way that you proceed one another because this is a this is a body movement if you're in this party like I said if you have this kind of attitude you're going to walk yourself out of here because your attitude will all of a sudden turn them against that's what happens that's why people need the church because my people be blocking they walk into the wilderness they're walking into the experience where they can't seem to I know people like that I know people all I can do is pray because [Music] it's because and so this whole element must be recognized it must be it must be our attitudes it's to take time though for you to you know to really break into these kind of areas in your life
