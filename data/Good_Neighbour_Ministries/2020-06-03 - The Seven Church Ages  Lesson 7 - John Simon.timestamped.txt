[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good evening my dear friends how
[0:17] wonderful it is to gather with you
[0:20] together in the house of God on this
[0:25] marvelous Wednesday evening may the Lord
[0:29] bless you real good we will now read our
[0:33] scripture and do our short brief study
[0:39] reading from Revelation chapter 1 from
[0:44] verse 5 unto him that loved us and
[0:51] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[0:55] and that made us kings and priests unto
[1:00] God and his father to him be glory and
[1:05] Dominion for ever and ever amen god
[1:12] bless you tonight praise God I'm so
[1:17] happy to be in the house of the Lord
[1:20] realizing that as our scripture has says
[1:24] that he has loosed us from our sins the
[1:29] word moost or washed us from our sins
[1:34] really means he's looseness or freed us
[1:38] from our sins there there we are
[1:41] brothers and sisters reduced loose from
[1:46] those sins which means that we were once
[1:50] tied up we were once shackled we we were
[1:57] shackled and we were chained but now we
[2:03] are loosed this also gives us the
[2:06] picture that we were imprisoned but now
[2:11] by the power of the blood of the Lord
[2:15] Jesus Christ your most I
[2:20] most from my sins loose from the past
[2:23] loose from everything else this also
[2:28] gives us the the sort of let's say you
[2:35] have a garment and that you love that
[2:39] garment you love to wear it as we're
[2:43] told to put on Christ but we you know we
[2:46] love to wear a certain garment and you
[2:51] may be at a wonderful dinner and
[2:55] something stains your garment that you
[2:58] are wearing and with everything you have
[3:02] trade you could not get out the stand
[3:06] you've tried every chemical every
[3:09] man-made chemical every thing that was
[3:12] in the store and you could not get the
[3:15] stain out until one day you thought
[3:22] about it let me not just use the regular
[3:26] detergent I need to get some bleach to
[3:31] deal with this stubborn stain and there
[3:37] you place that piece of clothing into
[3:41] the water and they required amount of
[3:44] bleach and after a time you'll notice
[3:48] that the bleach seems to break up all
[3:54] the chemicals of that stain and until
[4:00] the stain begins to vanish away from
[4:03] your piece of clothing in actual fact
[4:07] the bleach loosed the dirt or the stain
[4:12] from the fabric of the clothing and that
[4:17] is the sense that we have here today
[4:19] that he had moved or washed us in his
[4:25] own blood may I say watch this in his
[4:28] own bleach blood the bleach blood
[4:32] Christ has washed us and cleansed us
[4:36] completely perfectly and and set us free
[4:41] to worship Him and to praise his holy
[4:45] and precious name
[4:47] Lorna God did you really catch that he
[4:51] has washed us the book of Revelation
[4:54] chapter 1 verse 5 says in his old blood
[4:58] in his own blood he has washed us oh
[5:03] praise be to God I thank God for that
[5:06] now we understand that he did not wash
[5:10] this with human blood
[5:13] no human sacrifice or blood could wash
[5:18] away our sins but it took the blood of
[5:21] the Lord Jesus Christ Himself to wash
[5:24] our sins away thanks be to God
[5:28] it would have said we were not saved by
[5:31] the will of man or the blood of man oh
[5:34] praise God but here we see we are saved
[5:37] by the blood of God God's own blood
[5:40] which King has the power and the ability
[5:43] to bleach us from every sin stain upon
[5:48] our hearts upon our lives we were not my
[5:52] friends saved by any other blood but the
[5:56] blood of God Peter calls that blood of
[6:00] God the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[6:02] Paul called it the blood of the Lord
[6:05] Lauren a god and he also called it the
[6:09] blood of Jesus oh the blood of Jesus
[6:13] washes white as snow now see clearly not
[6:17] three persons one persons what God the
[6:21] blood of God the blood of Jesus
[6:23] hallelujah the blood of our Lord one God
[6:27] not three but one God that died on the
[6:31] cross and bled there for our sins one
[6:35] person there is the great revelation
[6:38] that Jehovah God came down
[6:42] and down from his glory everliving story
[6:47] my God and Savior came and Jesus was his
[6:51] name and this great Jehovah came down
[6:55] and by the means of the virgin birth was
[7:00] able to make himself a body thanks be to
[7:06] God yes sir and God made that body or as
[7:11] he would have said to Solomon he built
[7:14] his own house and God came down and
[7:19] lived in his own house or Tabernacle
[7:23] richen with God's house
[7:26] God's tabernacle is Jesus Christ God was
[7:31] in Christ reconciling the world not to
[7:35] express a second person or a third
[7:37] person but unto himself that he was
[7:41] reconciling the world yes sir and that
[7:45] blood that marvelous wonderful blood
[7:48] that flowed on Calvary
[7:51] was the blood of God Himself that came
[7:55] to redeem us amen for God had to be in
[8:00] that body that he himself made he being
[8:04] a spirit could not bleed of his spirit
[8:10] but through the instrumentality of the
[8:14] body that he made for himself that body
[8:18] could bleed chemical blood that we human
[8:22] beings can see and identify but
[8:25] something visible that God himself had
[8:28] bled for our sins thanks be to God
[8:32] hallelujah now if we were to go to the
[8:36] Old Testament we may see this truth
[8:38] amplified through tapes through the type
[8:41] and a shadow of Adam and Eve being in
[8:45] the garden now when Adam and Eve first
[8:49] sin of course that news went straight to
[8:53] heaven
[8:54] let us see it as an angel going into the
[8:57] presence of God to announce that his
[9:00] children on earth had sinned against him
[9:05] no what was your reaction the reaction
[9:09] was that God send another create another
[9:15] human being and send him or her down to
[9:19] do the redemption that God called out to
[9:22] Michael or some other great angel and
[9:26] send them down to do that great
[9:31] Redemption oh my did God send his son if
[9:36] he had a second person to accept that he
[9:40] send the son but no God came himself
[9:44] into the garden to redeem his lost son
[9:49] for Adam said he heard the voice of God
[9:52] walking in the garden and the voice
[9:56] crying with a brokenness Adam Adam where
[10:00] are you where are you
[10:03] that's their fellowship meeting that
[10:05] they would have every evening when God
[10:08] and Adam and Eve would have their time
[10:13] of fellowship with the cathedral of the
[10:16] under the cathedral of the sky and so
[10:19] there they were God having such great
[10:23] love within his heart would not entrust
[10:27] the redemption of his creation there's
[10:31] redemption of his son if it's daughter
[10:34] unto any other but he entrusted it to
[10:39] himself as much as he said to Abraham I
[10:43] swore by myself God swore by himself God
[10:49] came down himself to do the redemption
[10:52] praise being a God that we have his
[10:56] personal attention and his perfect
[10:59] personal action within this great
[11:03] process of redemption
[11:05] so we
[11:06] are redeemed unto himself and be
[11:09] redeemed by the blood of God his self
[11:14] thank God
[11:15] so this eternal God came down and dwelt
[11:20] in a mortal body in order to take away
[11:25] our sin he became the Lamb of God he
[11:31] became the Lamb of God to be able to
[11:36] shed his blood and enter beyond the veil
[11:41] to make sacrifice for our sins
[11:46] consider this my friends then if we are
[11:49] saved by the blood of God if we have
[11:53] been washed and loosed freed set free
[11:58] from the shackles of sin the habits of
[12:01] sin all the desires of sin free set free
[12:07] by the grace of God then it was the
[12:10] blood of God then it had to be perfect
[12:13] blood perfect blood and if the blood
[12:18] that perfect blood is losing us from our
[12:24] sins then my friends we are loosed by
[12:28] the power of this blood
[12:30] we are loosed from our bondage of sin
[12:34] from the power of sin from the very
[12:40] defilement of sin we have been set free
[12:45] by the blood of God which is the blood
[12:49] of our Lord the blood of the Lord Jesus
[12:52] Christ and this loosing is perfect and
[12:57] complete for we are perfect in him and
[13:01] we are the righteousness of God in him
[13:04] we were chosen in him and in him we have
[13:10] redemption through Jesus Christ our Lord
[13:13] by the shed blood of the Lamb of God
[13:18] hallelu
[13:19] and therefore there is no condemnation
[13:24] there is no condemnation to them which
[13:28] are in Christ Jesus
[13:31] thanks God hallelujah amen amen
[13:35] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[13:38] God's elect it is God that justify it or
[13:44] in other words it's God that has
[13:46] declared us righteous it is God hostak
[13:51] that has declared us sinless washed
[13:55] moussed freed by the blood of God
[13:59] himself who is he that condemneth it is
[14:04] Christ that died hallelujah
[14:07] Romans 8 the 33 to 34 amen praise God
[14:13] and it took his death to give us this
[14:18] great prescription of the blood for when
[14:22] the people in the book of Acts realized
[14:25] that they were infected with the virus
[14:28] of sin they asked dr. Peter Simon Peter
[14:33] what shall we do to be saved
[14:36] and dr. Simon Peter answered repent and
[14:40] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[14:44] for the remission of your sins and
[14:47] furthermore there is no other name given
[14:50] under heaven whereby we must be saved
[14:53] but the name of Jesus Christ our Lord
[14:56] hallelujah glory to God so friends I
[15:00] tell you don't listen to men for we have
[15:04] been made free and guiltless or or guilt
[15:08] free condemnation is gone the blood of
[15:13] Christ has washed it away from us and
[15:16] set us free

[16:07] the Creed's of man or by various Church
[16:12] darkness don't allow that anymore and
[16:15] don't belittle straight by listening to
[16:18] those who deny the power of the blood

[17:57] by our sincerity salvation is by God's
[18:01] works in our life he has made us kings
[18:06] and priests unto the Lord

[18:16] all of grace it is by the grace of God
[18:21] not by works hallelujah thanks be to God
[18:26] amen I'm glad Martin Luther recognized
[18:29] that and had a revelation and broke from
[18:31] his traditions of his dogmas and the old
[18:34] creeds and walked away into the freedom
[18:38] of the revelation of the word of the
[18:42] Living God for he had made us kings and
[18:46] priests unto God hallelujah redeemed us
[18:51] and loosed us and did all of that
[18:56] friends and made us to be kings and
[18:59] priests so that now we are spiritual
[19:04] kings oh thank God we reign over a
[19:09] spiritual Kingdom you may not realize it
[19:14] but we are in total Dominion and
[19:19] authority over the kingdoms of darkness

[19:27] everything
[19:28] we are kings unto the Living God
[19:32] anointed by the Holy Spirit
[19:35] behold mark 16:15 behold I give you
[19:39] power power over all sickness all the
[19:45] demons all those powers give you power
[19:48] to lay hands on the sick and they shall
[19:52] recover recover sickness
[19:55] germs demon powers all other things come
[19:59] under your authority which was taken
[20:03] away from Adam Adam lost his inheritance
[20:07] there in the garden but here
[20:09] Adams inheritance and the inheritance of
[20:12] this second Adam is restored back to the
[20:16] people of God the children of God we are
[20:19] in a place where we are restored back
[20:22] into our divine authority which God gave
[20:26] to us so here we are a spiritual Kings
[20:29] ruling right now and reigning with him
[20:34] over a spiritual Kingdom where our
[20:39] commands must be obeyed and every other
[20:43] power upon this earth even those
[20:48] so-called princes and powers of heavenly
[20:51] places are in subjection to us they are
[20:55] defeated by Jesus Christ and he has
[20:57] given us his authority to rule and reign
[21:02] over them now we are drawn spiritual
[21:06] Kings now and we will be Kings in the
[21:13] Millennial Kingdom to reign upon this
[21:17] earth with him Colossians 1 3
[21:22] the scripture says who had delivered us
[21:27] from the power of darkness and that
[21:32] translated us into the kingdom of his
[21:37] dear son so right now we are reigning
[21:42] spiritually with the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:44] and whoever thus over sin over our flesh
[21:49] and over the world systems and over the
[21:55] devil and all of his influences and we
[21:59] are reigning and we are showing that we
[22:02] have conquered and defeated Satan by the
[22:05] power to display and
[22:09] if s the life of Jesus Christ which
[22:12] Satan has tried to prevent you and I in
[22:16] every way from doing that but by victory
[22:21] over him this glorious victory in the
[22:24] love divine we are able to manifest the
[22:27] life of the Lord Jesus Christ and show
[22:31] him forth to the people that they can
[22:34] recognize that Christ in you God lives
[22:38] in you and makes himself known through
[22:42] you Christ in us working willing and
[22:47] performing things for his own purposes
[22:51] and for his own good pleasure yes my
[22:55] friends even though we are a spiritual
[22:58] kings and priests seated in heavenly
[23:01] places in the Lord Jesus Christ and
[23:05] giving glory praise and honor to his
[23:09] marvelous name not only has he loosed us
[23:14] washed us freed us not only had he made
[23:18] us kings to rule and reign with him but
[23:23] my Lord is so gracious he has made us
[23:27] priests unto Him and again that distress
[23:32] he has made us not by our just our
[23:36] desire not by our will power not by our
[23:41] might not by any our even our own
[23:45] choices but he has made us priests yes
[23:51] priests unto Him and you know what
[23:53] priests do please give offerings on
[23:58] behalf of the people they stand as
[24:01] intermediaries they stand in the gap Oh
[24:06] for the glory and praise of God and so
[24:10] he has made us priests puts us into the
[24:14] position for his purpose so we were
[24:17] saved with a purpose we are created for
[24:21] a purpose
[24:23] and here he has made us priests that we
[24:27] might offer him the offering of praise
[24:31] that we might praise his holy name and
[24:35] that our offering of praise will go
[24:38] before him like the sweet smelling
[24:41] perfume acceptable in his presence Oh
[24:45] glory to God he has made us priests that
[24:50] we may offer not just our praise but our
[24:53] lives as living sacrifices holy and
[24:58] acceptable to God which is but a
[25:01] reasonable service after what our he has
[25:05] done for us at dark Calvary we are here
[25:09] as priests also that we may worship Him
[25:14] we may glorify him along with the
[25:17] twenty-four elders and along with all
[25:21] those thousands upon ten thousands in
[25:25] the heavens above that give glory to the
[25:28] name of this great and mighty God
[25:32] hallelujah for that what the Lord God
[25:35] Almighty we lift our hands and wash it
[25:39] to thee to give your glory and honor and
[25:42] praise hallelujah
[25:44] yes sir so we given the offering an
[25:47] offering by being in the spirit while we
[25:51] worship we give him this offering my
[25:54] friends by being in the truth while we
[25:58] worship being made sure we are in the
[26:01] revelation of God while we're worshiping
[26:04] and not to be those who know not what
[26:07] they worship but some that worship him
[26:10] with a lot of spirit a lot of emotion
[26:14] but they lack the truth then there are
[26:19] those who are filled with the truth but
[26:22] they lack the spirit but right down the
[26:25] center of this narrow way goes a little
[26:28] slop that worships him and gives him the
[26:32] offering of worship by worshipping Him
[26:35] in spirit and in truth
[26:38] give living lines of intercession living
[26:43] prayer lives genuine prayer lives which
[26:47] is nothing less to have a prayer life is
[26:49] to have a consistent life of prayer all
[26:53] things be the God petitioning us priests
[26:57] and interceding for others praying for
[27:01] others requesting for others with such
[27:04] humility with such love and grace not
[27:08] taking of oneself but reaching out to
[27:11] the Lord on the behalf of others that he
[27:14] may bless them and you know when you
[27:16] pray with that sincere prayer of a
[27:19] righteous man when love projects grace
[27:22] takes over and when grace takes over
[27:25] miracles happen healing happen healings
[27:28] happen all kinds of supernatural takes
[27:32] place because of the the Spirit of the
[27:34] Living God working in the life of the
[27:37] believer who he had made chosen shaped
[27:41] and formed and presented the personality
[27:45] and their and their position to be
[27:48] priests unto him that is why my friends
[27:52] the things of this world holds no
[27:55] attraction for us there is no magnet in
[27:58] the world for us that will pull us away
[28:01] for if he said if I be lifted up I will
[28:05] draw all men unto myself hallelujah I
[28:09] trust he draws you here tonight to
[28:11] himself or draws you a closer to him if
[28:15] you are a believer closer to him in your
[28:19] walk with him closer to him in your
[28:22] talks with him your fellowship with him
[28:26] your prayer with him that he will draw
