um this brother as you know know you may not know he was in the bush actually brother coffee witnessed to him I went over there um some years ago about four um and um he ministered there was ministering in the bush and I felt his ministry was a little bit higher than that and he's a brother he's a goget he's young his wife is Young he had his young wife and first child in the bush there and they were ministering and so we went and preached the gospel there for them um with all the mosquitoes and everything else like that anyway I felt that he had more talent and and anointing use it closer to the city now so I I told him I said brother you should move out but he didn't think it was wise but anyway what happened the denominational people stirred up some trouble there and he finally had to move out and he moved very I kind of directed closer to arra the main capital city on the outskirts and him his wife young wife they started witnessing but people got attracted for them and what happened is that um he um the chief or in the area noticed the change in the lives of the people and so he called him in and and and told him that he wanted to help him make it short he offered him to give him some land and so we sent you we sent down $1,000 from here and um with that the chief gave him uh I don't know if I can't tell how many to three four or 5 acres of land but it's a large set of land that he's even farming on it and the church is still on it and so he started the church there with just poles and attached roof and again we heard about that and again we contributed or sent uh the money for him to be able to start building this little building that you see there and through the three or four years uh we kept helping him and this is just a little bit this is a bit with the result of our sending maybe five or 6,000 over theal of the brother right amen see the result of it amen One [Applause] Soul not one soul is worth more than that but it's not

they're working on it by the grace of God and I want you to know that typically you go to an African village and start a church they don't plant nice bushes and flowers around it like that just to show you his me mind I'm looking into his mind his approach his attitude he's doing things right the way he knows how or he thinks out but he's doing things right so we want to thank the Lord for that

time and she's with him there and um wonderful just wonderful next sister Simon taking [Music] pictures the pastor's wife this is the young the next Pastor older man young Minister okay that's that's fine that's fine Brother for for this you can hit brother we have a lot more that we can show see that okay now this whole that brother Michael's Church even though it's on the edge of the city it's not in the city so of course all of this is news was is the signment the driving the traffic the traffic jams like you never seen traffic jams even more than you see here in Toronto cars in the city the city has millions and it's like confusion but seemingly they get less acci than we do anyway we had to drive two almost two hours outside of the city so when I say outside of the city two hours outside and then we turned down a dirt road and of course this so where are we going we're going down a dirt road and the car is going up and down it's it's not the road when you imagine our road it's dirt it's holes it's B holes we're going and there bushes on two sides looks like they're going in the middle of nowhere like the taking you somewhere to kidnap you foreigners with clothing and everything and bags so so anywhere we're going and then at one point she said the car can't go any further because there is little not little big holes in the ground and everything you can't possibly see how a car could go there but somehow you're making the TR the car is going then we hit to a point where a stream goes across the road you said oh no this is it she said let's get out now because we may have to you know walk in the water and get on the other side and walk up they said no no no no no you don't get out Mama staying they call her mama you staying don't come out and everything so she stayed in and it drove and T the car goes into the ditch and it got stop and the car come out but you know how it is that nothing worries and bothers them some of the brothers that were there got down there and pushed Ando pushed it out and came up on the other side and drove in and uh of course the driver that brought us when he got to where the church is he just turned back left took his car and went back he wasn't a Christian he was the driver given to me by one of the like I told you there's very wealthy man there a good friend of the president that gives me a car and a driver so he sent the driver with the vehicle and this guy couldn't take it and he just he's from Africa and he turned back and he went back right anyway uh so so we went up there and that's how we got to the church I just want you to know it's not a picnic and we didn't go there and just have a some people will use the term sometimes when I go on a ter vasion you go on a vasion or something it's not a vacation uh or anything like that and um of course I wasn't thinking of a mosquitoes and everything but every time a mosquito come around they worry about her getting with uh by the mosquitoes because that's why they make you take yellow fever shots malaria before you go there you can't you can't even go in the country unless you show the documentation that you had the shots right so I want no it's not I come back when I come back I don't consider that so I say oh it was a wonderful trip and this and that but when I take her with me then I become conscious that hey wait a minute all this stuff here I don't even mention because I take it for granted because I've been going to Africa over and over but now I become conscious that little things that I come it means something so I thought I need to tell you that and that was during the day we went to that church now this church is in the city of ARA in the city of ARA and this is night time so the pictures would not be as clear but we went there in the Night by the grace of God uh that's the reason I couldn't get a picture of the outside of the church this is another brother brother op the first brother that we uh started to help things are more um uh is different for him but this is the what he has put up also in the City by God's grace uh the building he has is uh believe 30 50 30 by 30 30 by 50 30 by 50 uh and so and all the membership are not there because it rain it rain and that is this crowd just like my crowd you know when it rain or during the week Wednesday night you know the people I'm looking at here not here uh they're somewhere else wherever so he was embarrassed just sometimes like I and he was embarrassed that all of his uh Church did not come out but nevertheless we had a wonderful service move on Brothers praise the Lord hallelujah stop this is the pastor and his wife brother op and his wife myself and my wife sister Simon praise the Lord of course brother coffee was there with us and we took a picture of some of the the brothers that assist this pastor uh there by God's grace move on and that's it there's no more pictures that's all right if there's no more pictures then that's as many as I took I didn't want to extend it but we thank the Lord for those Brothers um I just want to say uh with what we sent to help this brethren just look at what they did amen look at what they [Applause] come and there's not a value on these Souls now I told these brothers I said now we want to take you to our next phase now because you're still in a state where um conditions where people look at the church and it's just a little Thing by the sideway we want to be able to first of all be able to supply them with fans proper fans at least they don't have air conditioning but they can have some electric fans up in the ceiling to make it a little cooler for the people because I felt it as you can see um uh so they need and those are things that we can supply by the grace of God that's not hard for anybody to do here uh I can tell one of the young peop even if you're selling newspapers do you think God will help you to be able to um buy a fan for us to be able to send to Africa and I'm sure among the young people alone can supply those FS what about us adults I mean what is one F to [Music] you I I I know it's church needs four right to put up in their ceilings uh so that they can at least cool the place while um they having their services and I tell you it's a different heat than we have here it's so it's so hot there it was 90 something degrees of course I remember one day it was 90 something where you sit there and you're not moving and yet to just watch if you start to move and they move and they move more than us praise God hall because they don't just worship God and clap their hands only they are dancing praise God remember that's a different culture and you don't say oh that's not you know I don't know the prophet would say about that we brother R joined them when he was in South Africa and the brothers were telling him the same thing well you know that music is a little lightly and he's dancing with them he say you don't know what's going on he says they're worshiping they're worshiping the same God only they don't know his name yet right and they are trying to worship him and ask for his protection when they go to hunt those lions and he said that's why I came down and I was dancing with them because I know who they were praised and who they were worshiping in that regard so you got to understand that praise the Lord let me repeat this and and let you understand it what early uh what the Christianity has done originally and what the Pentecostal is even doing they they go saying they're going to christianize the people but instead of that they americanize them or try to transport your culture here and place it on the people and think that's what makes them Christian that's not what makes them Christian is a change of heart right is the change of the heart is what makes them a Believer that's right praise the name of the Lord you know brother Bram uh uh went there in South Africa and preached the gospel and there was what over what two or 300,000 people jammed up and he never went a preach telling them take off all those loin cloths and pull off this and do he just preached the word and he said as he preached the word he noticed the women slipping away they're slipping away and coming back covered you didn't have to tell them nothing when the Holy Ghost anointing come preach the they going to change their own way have to go criticizing people you know like uh I was in I'm diverting a little bit in Ohio where a certain Minister there was an Indian preacher came over and he was saying oh he says brother he says you got to go back to India and tell all this women not to wear the saries like that you know with their arms showing outside and you know the Sor being like that maybe their breast will show and he's turned on like that the brother says yes brother the brother was very patient he kept saying yes brother and you know and after a while the man got tired of it right and L didn't know that this man was a captain in the Indian Air Force and a brilliant man intellectually just that he wasn't showing it he say he says what are you he got angry said what are you talking about you're telling me about the women in the S he says go just go all on the street there and look at your women what are you talking to me about you just shut up and hold your peace and don't say nothing else because he didn't want to really explode and get on he just shut him up in that way but we got to understand that this is what has been happening culture being transported rather than Christianity trying to turn them into English or turn them into French or whatever rather than turning them into Christians you don't have to dress like you they don't have to sing like you they don't have to have your kind of music that you love amen they just have to use the music that they already have and praise God and give God the glory in that way so I just thoughted mention that in passion we going there to christianize them not to make them Canadian or American or English or whatever praise the Lord amen so um uh it was wonderful to take the gospel we want to be able to help them even more and I would like for us to um ramp up our missionary program amen CU we know reliable men that we can support by the grace of God and we will and we want to support them by by God's grace amen uh this building here in the last building in arra they uh both of them need help but this one needs to be able to build his building properly I just looking at it you can tell it's not um uh like it should be anyway and we want to have you place your support there to be able to do something like that for the glory of God amen amen why you stop and think how long we have on the earth even if you live 100 what's 100 years do what we can while we are here amen praise the Lord I remember going to Trinidad but before I went to Trinidad there was a brother Indian brother from Trad that would come to Guyana and help to spread the gospel brother di Oar and this man would uh walk about with no shoes on his feet bef footed walk around like that and helping us with preaching the gospel and preach he was a preacher too that's where in Bethlehem Tabernacle our brother Albert green is now the pastor of the church there would about three 300 people in it anyway so um he used to come over there and preach the gospel then he invite me over I went to visit him in Trinidad preach for him brother vindal was under his ministry at that time and he was just a young young man and I visited with him when he was under the bottom of a house preaching to 50 people or so and selling eggs for brother the rable jars business and those days this is not to belittle brother de brother um Vin but to show you that even how his ministry raised from there until now it's worldwide and a powerful Minister but um brother Ry uh went on with this ministry for many years and then he died when he died they they found out even his wife didn't know because he grew to be a wealthy very wealthy man he was humbl to God God began to bless him he end up having rice fields can Fields malls he got super wealthy surrendering to God and doing the will of God and took his own money and they found out he built Church in BR he built Church in this island he built Church in that Island nobody knew he built Church in that Island he was a pastor but he took his money and he built churches built churches a whole bunch of churches that he built with his own money and then they understood why God bless him that way why he grew why he expanded to that point right now where his actually his his children are in no need all of them themselves are now wealthy thanks be to God so I'm asking the question why don't are we have people in here that capable of doing that uh why do we have to always uh you know uh appeal for funds we do that because to give all of you the opportunity cuz you can't lift the burden on just certain people and all you can have a part but all you don't have the capacity but I'm just opening your minds now don't don't don't take what I'm saying wrong I'm saying you got to understand why God positionally placed every one of you here in his church it's so that you can do your part amen look I'm not here for you to enrich me I'm not rich and you not enriching me because I'm giving most of whatever comes to me away anyway amen praise the Lord and I am helping where I can for the glory of God what I'm saying that Brothers we got to see this thing is real this thing is not a joke that's right this thing is not something I'm watching you to see what you do before I do or you do what God put in your heart amen glory to God Amen somebody say oh I'm going to back that one I'm going to back that one I'm going to support that one I'm going to build this I'm going to buy that I'm going to do this that's how it's going to be and then our hearts are so real that we a to reach out and touch the people for the graise of God the last one has got to come in that means we got to send out this gospel we have to send it out everywhere for the glory of God hallelujah and change the lives of the people praise God hallelujah amen and the Lord has helped me to grant me some favor like I said a member of the parliament was there to to meet me uh the car that the former president us is a older now but uh I was granted that same SUV again to use with a driver um by God's grace so I want to be able to use some of that influence to be able to do what a lot of the brothers there even though some of them have big churches 1,500 800 whatever but they don't have the reach they don't know these people and some of them can't even dare to approach these people or talk to them like that but God has granted me that and we want to be able to use it for his Hallelujah uh I didn't realize it but I was going to bring I felt to bring the book influence but now I understand I'm not preaching from it but influence God allows you to Grant give you favor and he gives you that not to use for yourself but to be able to use it for the gospel that's right to touch the lives of people amen praise the Lord uh I was already told you know uh if you if you want anything any kind of registration this you know that anything concerning that uh I'll take care of it I'll see that it happens praise the Lord amen and if you know if you don't know about Africa nothing happens unless you know somebody or you got washes of money to spend if you have money money lots of money opens doors other than that you got to have influence if you don't have influence you tell us you go somewhere and you say oh uh or the gentleman goes with you and say Mr s and oh you know him oh right away things begins to change right away if you if you're not in that position you going have to stand in the back of some line in the Heat and wait for hours and hours and come back day after day or week weeks like that so praise God the Lord bless I want to show you something else because a lot of you here don't really um know some things about me so you got to you you I want to give you a little more understanding of who is your pastor just a little insight just a little inside can you hit the one recognition there's a fer in the US there recogition um which one I have it's all right them take your time I just need find two I just thought that today I need to do that somehow it just struck me that a lot of you here have seen and you don't know so I need for you to have some exposion go back to the first one brother first one not that uh there's two files with the same name but one has sep okay SP it there this is after in 20 uh in the early part 20 whatever it was I went in we went in myself and brother P went into the middle of the Sudan war in the bush flying in on an old Russian plane the wings held together by wires and goats and chickens and everything in the plane with us and antinoff or they call it anyway we flew in landed on a dirt patch and went into uh a Sudanese Village in the city of not City Town or Village called Nial province of Nial and we there we came out there is no hotels there there's no houses there there's only the native HS called Tas they kind of rounded like that and the door is low like this dressed like the eye of a needle right when Jus said you must need go through the eye of a needle is that if you arrive L to Jerusalem there was just openings like that big enough for you to need them and go through so you need to humble yourself so we went through that and then you into that Tuka and there's a skin there that's all protecting you from any wild diny Ms that would want to come track you out in the night so that's where we slept and of course mosquitoes are going around and everything else and of course the toilet it's just an open pit that's some distance away and of course there's no electric lights it's bit black you can't see your hand even if you put it like that right in front of you so and uh of course the uh in the night you want to go to the washroom of course I didn't go to the washroom I just stood right beside the thing there I wasn't going any and even to go out of it was was a nerve rack but you can't see anything to protect yourself or no if I mean that they're telling you when you get out of the of the homo that they had turn across make sure that you knock out your shoes well you knock out your shoes scorpions snakes anything could be in the shoes so it was like that it was like that anyway we we stayed in there we preach the gospel not under a temp not in a Auditorium like this but under a huge tree and word has gone out that these two Bishops were coming and people walked for one week from in the bush so there was thousands under the tree and we preached the gospel there a young man went with us and he was playing uh one of these instruments and he came with us he was just young uh let me let me tell you this quickly when he came out of the Bush it wouldn't it didn't take long he ascended to fame and prosperity now he's a he's one of the leading saxophonist in the United States and he's out of my sight now I don't even hear from him anymore but he went in with us we weren't even thinking about that but he came out back so there we were and we preach to the people under the under the street under those conditions you don't mind if this is the service for today you're not hearing preaching as you think of preing but we preach to them and then you know to welcome us they kill the goat and they and they began to roast it on the fire and then they throw it in a pot and they cook it like that and myself and um the others that were with us uh were there and so we at when you're eating the meat and eating the sto there is grit there is sand in it everything else you know we didn't spit it out or anything like that we e but that's where we are you're a missionary you read praise God I'm not used to this turn up my nose my face in front of them like no I we we went right there amongst them and we took part of everything else glory to God and anyway I was able to meet these soldiers you know then you see troops going by AK 47 you know was war so I met we sitting with the leaders and we drinking coffee or tea or whatever they have on this Green net stuff you know soldiers use anyway make that short cut that we came back out we did what we could you know we sent 40 foot containers maybe twice to help them Ram jammed with stuff from here in Canada uh cost us thousands of dollars to send in but it was an assistance be help people by God's grace praise the Lord now we we eased up on doing a lot of that stuff we we sent stuff like that the grenader the island the grenader and and a team went over we distributed it that's action praise the lord we actually acting on the word and doing things for his glory amen amen so Mak it sure after we came back maybe a year or two years later I received this in an official envelope with the official seal of the government of South Sudan the northern Sudan is Muslim and a lot of terrorism there and they were the ones that were killing the people in southern Sudan who most of them are Christians at a presbyterian Baptist nazarine Lutheran and so on Amen and they were killing them and that's where I had a meeting with all the priests and ministers and everything else and none of them were fighting one another you know they realized one thing that when the Muslims come down they weren't asking you which denomination you belong as long as you're a Christian you're dead that's simple so you'll be surprised they got together and we had a wonderful meeting there by go the grace of God so this invitation came Mo it up now and you can read it if you like look at how they address this is kind of respect and brief what that is doing is inviting me to the inauguration of the president of Southern so that and I'm showing it to you now I'm just showing it to you I don't walk around showing it to everybody but I'm showing it to you now so that you see I'm not just talking words to make myself look good or something like that I rather hide it but I'm I felt led today to show it to you who have never seen this or you don't really know about it except my tofe so you see it there and signed by the Pres pres president he's still he's he's in power right now this is the present president that's his official Citizen and by the way when I was going there I went to the airport and they said the um you need a visa and I called him he laughed he says you don't need a visa he says those little clerks don't know what they're talking about he said you show them that letter they have to let you through they have to let you through so I told them I said well all I have is this letter when I pull the letter out and the supervisor saw it the supervisor oh yes sir it's sir and sir and everything else in backpack everything is taken care of when I landed in Ethiopia to take the last flight into the Sudan same thing happened they were trying to stop and then I pulled out the letter and I showed them by the way the atmosphere changed everybody's running around everything else and of course I went over there praise the Lord are you moving it before I tell you brother it's okay now it's all right but that's okay um I want you to see this also not just over in Africa but here in the United States if you can read it you'll see that's from the state of Virgin right that this took place here by going in there and preaching in where the pastor church he had at the time and do helping in the community having Community meetings inside the community uh there by the grace of God this was issued to me by the grace by God's uh giving me favor okay move to the next one up brother okay that's I'm bringing this home now that's showing you right here in the city of Hamilton uh we did a great uh campaign there called Orban Harvest we brought in brother Brooks we brought in the LA Fon we brought him you know brother P came in and so like that and we for from Friday Saturday and Sunday we carried this on and during that time we collected from various merchants and various business peoples candles soup big corporations different ones giving food some give use clothing membership gave what they had and so on and for those three days we were giving out food and clothing without uh any donations or anybody we refus to take any donations we wanted the people to absolutely know that we not here like the denominations to trick you into joining them by giving you food and clothing to obligate you we are here to do the will of God and um as a result of that in the middle of the meeting we were preaching we preached the gospel using wisdom not just going out there and you know blasting them with a prophet right away but telling them about the doctrines of the Prophet how it differs from the denomination and in one of those meetings as you know the Holy Spirit fell and people came and true themselves in the baptism time we baptized a sister from Iran that was a Muslim all her life but when she heard the word on that fashion of the Holy Ghost she just went into the water with baptized her and her husband Victor praise God and others were baptized in that meeting amen praise the Lord and that is the reason why the church that we had in hon up on the mountain there was about 300 people in it and on a Sunday it was jam packed with like 450 people and no parking and and there was no more place and that's why we moved from there and of course you know from that some of the grandon church came from here as a result of that uh because there was no more place and stuff like that and things were getting cramped and uh so anyway so that's the Commendation from the mayor for how it affected the community people that were not members of the church never became members of the church would be you mean no no charge you mean nothing and they would be walking away crying nobody ever gave me anything for nothing nobody ever done anything they would be going away literally weeping and we were able to um track that we helped over 6 to 7,000 people and that hit the newspapers and of course it caught the eye and ears of the powers and so they issued that uh to myself and my wife next and and and again the next here I believe Again by the grace of God can move it up again brother and see and I'm talking about the presentation for these things took place at Hamilton Place where there were thousands of people filling the ballroom and then they will call you up and the mayor is there and then he will present it to you this is what took place I'm just trying to let you know that though I keep quiet and low profile that
