praying that the holy spirit will bless us in every way and quicken us to the word that we might recognize him as he recognizes us may the lord bless you thank you all so much for the wonderful singing here and playing of the music amen praise god god bless you will turn to uh matthew chapter 18 reading from verses 1 to 5. it will be up on the screen in a moment praise the lord we thank god for all these young people on the media in the back there we give god praise for them amen praise the lord hallelujah and they're getting better and better all the time we thank god for that let's read the scriptures at the same time came the disciples onto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except you be converted and and become as little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me praise god gracious father we thank you for this reading of your word we pray father that you will just bless your children and sow your seed in the good ground that you may be glorified as it comes bringing forth fruit to the glory of your name amen god bless you all please be seated hallelujah amen now there's an old old song maybe you'll help me with that that we used to love to sing to be like jesus how many remembers that one let's see if we can sing that and give him glory to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i long to be like him all through life's journey all through lies from earth to glory earth to glory i only asked to be like him i believe that's the desire of every christian i believe that's the desire of every sincere heart that wants to please god and bring glory to his great an honorable and wonderful name now in the bible in the days of israel as you know god gave israel the law and they were to keep the law and they were punishments if you did not keep the law and from that god's intention was that israel was trying to keep the law and will soon find that they really could not keep it they would find they really couldn't keep it uh and then if they didn't keep it of course you saw the effects of it they drifted in tradition traditionalism they drifted into forms they drifted into religious systems of worship they drifted off into ceremonies and all kinds of different things uh once god gave them priests they ended up with rabbis god give them the tabernacle they ended up with synagogues their god give them the old testament they end up with the old talmud and and so on they drifted away from their original foundation god but god wanted them really uh he deliberately put it that way that they will come back to him and say lord we tried to keep the law but we we just can't keep the law uh we want to keep it and then he will step in with his great love and his grace and his mercy praise the lord and then he will bring into them grace amen hallelujah and we know now god uh we're not on the law we are under grace how many can say that i said we are not on the law we are now under grace now but still though we are under grace god has given us his word and we try to live the word how many tries to live it at least you're going to try it now you may stumble you may make mistakes you may fall you may slip on everything else but god gave us his word that we would keep his word the best we know how now we understand clearly here that after years centuries of christianity as we know it the church continues to try to live the life of jesus christ according to what they have read here in the bible and nothing is wrong with reading it here in the bible but the life is not words a life is a a being a spirit a person hallelujah so uh they're trying to live the life of christ by a list of directions and they're using that to teach the people in christianity uh to bring forth a christianity that is based on lining up their life with these uh religious scriptures that they've put together and says this is what god wants you to be this he wants you to have love look you know he wants you to have temperance virtue patience he wants you to have all those fruits of the spirit in your and it's true but they're not telling you how are you going to do that how are you going to do that it's not just reading it and then saying oh i'm going to be a christian so i'm going to stop doing this i'm going to stop doing that i'm not going to do this and i will do that and then people who will uh see me as a christian that is not what god had in this mind amen now uh we know that brother branham had a vision of uh of a baby and this baby was trying to put on its clothing and it was struggling trying to put the clothing on and put the arm into the armhole and was missing and you know how they do was babies up trying to do it and it just was not working uh whatsoever amen but then the same one who told him i'll teach you how to fish that one turns and tells him now i'll guide your arm i'll guide your arm into that armhole so you'll know how to put on the clothes amen now what i'm saying is what paul said paul told us clearly put on christ put on christ and that's what the world and the church world the nominal church world they're trying to put on christ but in actual fact uh you know they're struggling one denomination says well put your arm this way and you you you'll become a christian or put your arm that way and it will get in the right position or do it like this or do it like that and everything else and not stopping to recognize that only he can live his own life you can't live his life he has to live his own life is that right so in other words if you want to live the life of christ you've got to surrender all to him and let him guide you to be able to live out his life christ in you is your hope of glory christ himself in you living his own life is your hope of glory except you may come as a little child be converted you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven amen praise god hallelujah so he'll say i'll guide you and when i say uh push your hand this way push it that way if i say push your hand this way put it that way amen praise god obedience praise the lord hallelujah so god is going to guide you to line up with his own word god is going to let you grow in grace that you can line up your life with his own lord thank god hallelujah amen but do you know he is not going to show everybody how to do that amen unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom but unto them it is not given you see he only do that for his wife his bride his children amen god has a bride he has a select elected few in the midst of the millions just like it was when they came out of egypt you know that two million of them they said about two million of them came out of egypt but how many made it in a promise into the promised land from the original generation only two joshua caleb all the rest was young generation that was born in the wilderness all the rest of them died their carcasses perished amen see and that's what's happened you got the whole church world of thousands of denominations but god will only reveal it to his selected elected few whom he predestinated and ordained before the foundation of the world to receive his word in this day and in this hour amen praise god hallelujah amen so god is the one who we must depend on to show us where the armhole is where is the revelation in the word that i can put my arm in there where i can go through there where i can walk beyond the veil of the just the right things we're going beyond the veil we're breaking into the real tabernacle of god this spiritual individual tabernacle where we can go behind the veil praise god hallelujah not just look at each other's faces but realizing that we are the skin veil that god lives in in this day and in this hour hallelujah it's not just you just yet me sit here like i've said it before you've never seen me all you seen is my body standing here and talking to you but i the person talking to you lives in this tabernacle amen oh praise god and we gather here together like this amen all of us got a skin there long god choose to give you a white very just pink veil a brown veil velar whatever veil but we are just like the badger skins the skins that were in the tabernacle and behind that was the glory of god hallelujah hallelujah god has hidden his glory and his life behind us your skin veil amen that he might live in us and walk in us listen book of revelation he says and i heard a great voice from heaven saying and i will be their god and they will be my people and i will live in them and i will walk in them and they shall be my people and i will be their god no you not your bodies are the temples of the holy ghost who lives in you the holy spirit lives in you amen jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen oh my hallelujah so the bride knows what to do with the word and she only knows what to do with the word when he shows her what's there then she knows how to act other than that she just waits and trusts him and believes until he tells her what to do amen praise god hallelujah oh my and then she has nothing to boast about uh i do this or this one is more of a christian than the other one and the other one is holier than the next one none of us are holier than the next one because it's christ in you that makes you holy this man outside here isn't holy it doesn't matter how much bible you read how many fastings how many brains how many flagellations are your body with whips this man here will never become holy amen because this man here has to do with sin and death but paul said this outward man is going to die daily but the inward man is going to be renewed hallelujah because he is going in a rapture amen we are we are this world is not our home because we know we come from god and we're going back to god we know we're a part of his economy his spirit lives in us that's the spirit the quickening spirit of resurrection is already in you your resurrection is ashore by the living god hallelujah it's in you already and he's working and working in you amen as paul talks about the power that worketh in you even now hallelujah amen praise god i tell you uh this thank god he's knocked away all these false ideas uh churchianity the rapture is going to be a certain day at a trumpet you're going to hear a trumpet and all of a sudden your body starts to change and you're going up in your nightgown into the heavens no no no no no that's not the way it is we are being transformed you're moving from glory unto glory unto glory until that wonderful time come you'll step right into the glory of god hallelujah because you're being changed by the power of god and the holy spirit working and moving within you amen hallelujah we can't do it ourselves i'm trying to tell you we can't live real christianity by ourselves not talking about put on christianity i'm not talking about christianity that is produced by teaching you how to act uh how to act like a christian how to dramatize the christian life uh we are not here to have all kinds of to impress people uh with the way no it's jesus christ must live through you and we know that we will still make mistakes is that right yes we don't have to feel embarrassed if we make mistakes because this outer man here is going to still make mistakes the key of it though if you're a real christian in your heart you don't want to make any mistakes you don't have any desire to make any mistakes you want to live according to what god has said and what god has done and is doing within his word amen so we are just here to obey god and obey his word when he says run we run when he says walk we walk when he says just sit still and stand still and know that i am god we sit still we wait on the lord until we see the glory of god hallelujah amen if you can't even do the abcs are you going to get up in the realms of the holy spirit to work through you amen hallelujah amen we realize friends that rarely we don't need a revelation to know that water baptism needs to be in the name of jesus christ they had hundreds of years of deceiving our minds but the lord has set us free because no woman is going to have her mad certificate signed by the the carpenter or or i'm a carpenter i'm a mechanic and i'm a this and then they put those three things there no what is your name the judge wants to know what is your name and say oh his name is jesus you know there's no name as father there's no name a son there's no name as holy but the bible says in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost one name in the name not in the names but in the name of the one who is the father and the son and the holy ghost and you don't tell me that my apostles were all of the bible they didn't know what they were talking about because the minute they asked peter men and brethren what shall we do to be saved he says repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ hallelujah and you'll never find one spot in the entire new testament where anybody was told to be baptized in the titles of father son and holy ghost every place whether it's philip whether it's peter whether it's paul and the bible will always and they baptize them in the name of jesus christ it's there in the word and paul goes on he says and all that you do do it in the name of jesus christ there's only one name i said there's only one name above all others there's one name above all others praise god no other name that is higher than that name as the sun said all hail the power of jesus name angel prostrate fall hallelujah oh my praise god forevermore one name for one god one god but that one god look you know queen elizabeth just uh passed away how many knows that she's just gone on to be with the lord amen and you must realize that she held different titles not only was she queen of england she was the head of the all the lodges for the scottish branch she was the head of the anglican church and the heads of the commonwealth those are titles that's not her name that's what she is so god is a father god created a body and lived in the body that's why jesus could say the father that dwelleth in me he do it works the father was in the sun amen god in christ hallelujah what i'm telling you about is happening now but now it's christ in the church amen living out his own life in his church praise god my god for may he may glorified here this morning amen oh praise god amen of course you can't go and do what's not written in the word what what you're supposed to do and you can't do what is that revealed to you to do praise god because you'll be doing it by yourself by your own mind your own actions whatsoever but all we have to do is relax let go and let god have his way when he says push push when he says walk walk when he says live a certain way live a certain way hallelujah so we don't need a revelation to know you need to be baptized in the name of jesus christ because that's the name will be on your spiritual marriage certificate amen jesus christ hallelujah amen we don't need a um a revelation to know that women should not be chopping off their hair oh my i didn't get any amen i gotta watch it because like walking on a narrow thing there yeah but we don't need a revelation for that the bible clearly says that a woman in the new testament there that she should not cut off her hair is that right oh my praise god hallelujah and turns the opposite way to men that they should cut their hair but that but the women should not cut their hair amen praise god right there in the word of god hallelujah it tells you in the bible she shall not wear any garment that looks like a man's garment pertains it says in the book of judah she shall not put on that mean shorts that means slacks that means the best 200 300 500 new jeans she shall not put on garments that pertain to a man the bible goes further it's a curse it's an abomination in the eyes of the lord that's not me saying that that's the book of deuteronomy says that but what does the church do they throw hello to that we we got to fill up this building with our members and uh you know they can come in however they want come as you are you know come as you are and even if they come in the first time like that the second time the third time they leave them keep coming like that amen which god is intent intention was come as you are yeah but after you get converted you don't want to come back like that you don't want to live like that you don't want to be you don't want to be wearing sex exposure clothes you don't want to wear them uh new york pants that's hanging down to the floor with the crutch going down and walking with a swagger like that no because you've been changed by the power of god your life has been transformed by the spirit of almighty god amen hallelujah amen you don't need a revelation for that you don't need a revelation to know that no woman should be preaching oh well my pastor is a preacher well i was up in uh in toronto and this uh a so-called great woman preacher is telling me well what is that i'm a preacher of so-and-so this big group was wonderful wonderful i said that's wonderful that you did that nothing with your ability you might your ability may be even greater than the mind but never mind that god still says still says she shall not teach nor usurp authority over a man amen well but my husband will allow me to do it i said well shame on him never mind he's there but while he was right there i said that he will allow you to do that uh like that that means that he's suppressed he's oppressed like jezebel did with ahab and he can't say nothing right like that i said but the bible doesn't change it still says she shall not teach but i teach and i teach better that's wonderful you may have all those gifts that you can teach but the you see the word teach presupposes that the one who is teaching has a more knowledge than the one that is being taught and the bible said you are not to usurp authority in a cunning way you're taking authority over those people that you're standing in front of and you bring in the word too and so oh she got mad and she had a hat on she'd take it and fling it on the floor and oh my so and then the spirit that was in her manifesting like that but you just think it's a righteous religious spirit that just got angry not realizing that's when the devil hears the word come forth in such a way clear clear clean you can't mistake it you can't escape it then he gets so mad he don't like it amen but that's the word of god nevertheless hallelujah she shall not you don't need a revelation for that amen he said oh why why why why why don't i need a revelation with that i never seen that in the bible well why don't you let your grandmother walk down the street with bikinis what would that be you're going to look down and say granny you can't why she can't do that you're doing it why she can't well no well the bible says you shall not amen praise god paint like jessie bell did painted up lips painted up face amen you take off some of that paint you might be able to paint your front door with it but the fact is they have so much pain they've gone away from their natural beauty say but i'm not beautiful god says you are there's only one of you you know god never met two things again everything is single everything is unique anything has its own beauty its own grace nobody can be you nobody can do what you can do [Applause] hallelujah how dare anybody call you or say anything god made you the way you are with your black yellow red brown that's the beauty and the grace of almighty god god made for that way hallelujah he made you that way hallelujah and he knows why he made us the way he made us praise god and we're not to question these things we're just to live according to his word live according to his promises that he gave us praise be to god forevermore hallelujah amen now listen he says quoting here now remember there's always been an ark in god's economy and we know it was always for the saving of the people right and then we know the ark of testimony in the days of law so they followed the ark because the testimony or word was in the ark that they were following now the third dispensation noah's time then lots time and now this time amen the ark is an arc here now right not a denomination neither the good works in in other words those things can't save you the ark save north from the flood of judgment denomination can't save you from judgment amen praise god hallelujah we find out that good works can't save you uh from the judgments of god i did this and i though you'll give your body to be burned don't you give all your goods to the poor and you have not charity hallelujah charity you think it's just you loving no you don't have the gift of god in you for the gift of god is eternal life the gift of god is the gene that is in you you didn't ask for that you didn't beg for that but you were given peace of himself in your heart by grace you were given him praise the lord praise the lord let me just say here don't tell me don't get excited i got to be excited because i'm seeing the word of god clear within my own mind and one heart while i'm talking to you here praise god hallelujah amen and then how can i overcome you see watch now we the only way that you can overcome see is under the shed blood is by the shed blood because you cannot overcome by yourself amen he that has overcome is already living in you and you are now resting on that hallelujah you're resting on that fact that i'm not going to overcome anything i'm not going to do this it's christ in me that's going to work through me and overcome everything around me glory be to god hallelujah amen now look what watch the kind of life you are living if it is just lived out of you automatically or you or do you have to strain and try to pull to live it then it's you that is doing that don't you try to do that don't you ever try again i said don't you because it's just like that baby putting its arm in the sleeve hole he's just up and down in every place trying to live the life of christ trying to put on christ trying to put his hand through the sleeve hole like that amen you may even say oh oh little baby or honey put on your coat put on your little jacket he'll do everything he can hey man but he can't do it it takes your steady hand to guide him or her and to put their arm in that armhole amen aren't you glad that we can just yield our lives surrender to our heavenly father and say lord lead me and guide me great holy spirit guide me today lead me today whatever i say wherever i go whatever i do how i walk how i talk take my entire life under your control lord hallelujah for the only way i can be like jesus is for jesus to be in me and live his own life amen it's not for me i'm approaching this from another angle so that you might understand what i'm saying it's not for me as you know in the dramatic arts you might get your script and then i'm going to now go out there and it's not for me to try to interpret the life of christ by my actions it's not for me to try to do that but if he can come in me live in me and interpret or speak his own words and deliver his own life through me amen then it is not me interpreting him but god being his own interpreter and making everything plain for his glory and that's what god wants to do with you and with every one of us that will completely surrender to him amen praise god hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen oh we got to get to the place where we said lord i just quit i i can't do it what's in this world today and what's going on for instance can you watch over your children 24 hours a day when you send them to school you can watch them 24 hours a day so that they can be safe with all the things they have it's good they have them but you see you've got to realize that god already said i who rule israel i do not slumber nor sleep hallelujah my eyes are everywhere over the earth hallelujah god loves everything so when they're gone from your presence when they're out of your sight what you need to do is lift them up before the lord in prayer and said lord watch over them lord protect them grant them may may you send the guardian angel to walk with them take them out safely bring them home safely they're in your hand for your glory and for your honor that's how we must recognize our position that we are his and he is ours by the grace of almighty god hallelujah but you know a lot of these babies are stubborn i'm talking about christians uh right a lot of these babies are stubborn and you know it too because they'll they'll try to pull the thing away from yourself oh i can do it i can do it i can feed myself oh my i can feed myself i can do this i can do that and they keep doing it and they're messing up themselves they're messing up their life they they can't put on christ they can't put on the claws like they should put it on and even if they have it on it's skewed this way or skewed that way or back to front or something like that instead of coming to the place and saying mommy daddy i i i just can't do it help me yeah you do it for me is that right that's what we need to do to god hallelujah oh lord this is too much father i can't carry this burden alone amen i need your guiding hand i need your help i need your hand amen i need you to be with me every step of the way amen oh praise god hallelujah oh yes you can't do it neither can i do it neither can any one of us do it amen but if we just hold still and give him a chance he will do it but we are very impatient hallelujah amen praise god and when you yield to him he'll put your hand in the right place but let's carry it a little further you can also ask him to put your feet in the right place the steps of a righteous man or woman are ordained of the lord hallelujah god knows what wherever you're going to go whoever you're going to meet whatever you're going to do before you've done it he already knows amen praise god and so you say lord guide my feet guide my hands guide my eyes where i look what i see let me understand what it is i'm seeing hallelujah oh praise god god guide my thoughts of what i think guide my imagination amen because the devil is going to fill your mind with all kinds of things and god has to guide you through all of that amen lord give me all you need to give me lord guide me and let my heart knows not to be carried away by just human sympathies but by the grace and the love of almighty god hallelujah amen yes sir god guide us to the perfect place for his glory and for his honor amen you see the thing you have to overcome is yourself your own ideas your thing the thing that we need to do is to surrender to him praise god hallelujah and not be like that i i i can do it i can do it i i i can live it i can be that that doesn't mean nothing to god that is your own will hallelujah amen praise god aren't you glad that you are you're christian aren't you glad as the song said i'm serving the lord i'm reading my bible believing god's word amen praise god hallelujah and then of course with that you will begin to produce or reproduce the fruits of the word the fruits of christ well he is the root and we are the fruit we we produce the fruit i am the vine you are the branches the root don't bear the fruit it's the branches beard the fruit right and so the fruit comes through the life of the true believer amen hallelujah what is the fruit amen anointed one at the end time the word is the fruit for the season amen you're producing a life to meet the age you're living in you understand me your the life that is manifesting through you must be a life to meet the challenge of the age in which you are living in by the grace of god hallelujah what is it what is it but you see they are sending forth a teaching a teaching of the season man's doctrine denominational doctrine producing a denominational form of life that kind of thing like that amen but we must produce the word of god for the season to meet the challenge of this age by the grace of god hallelujah you see it's by how you accept the word shows what spirit is living behind your veil let me repeat that again how you respond to the word of god shows what being what kind of spirit a person is living behind this veil is that right now you notice eve didn't reject god and say oh i don't believe in god she believed god all she did was to accept an error all she did was accept an error and the same thing when whatever you accept shows where you're putting your vote or you put in your life that shows where you're putting your life amen praise god but i want to thank god for his great grace and his goodness now we know that the bible says the rain falls on the just and on the unjust and when the rain falls it falls on the weed that's in the field and it falls on the wheat that's in the field but god is not partial he falls in everybody but watch this now uh you've got a lot of weeds trying to say that i'm a weak too i'm a christian too i'm a believer too and you're dressed like a christian walk like a christian talk like a christian that doesn't make you a christian but when the rain falls on the seed it begins to force the life out of that seed when it starts to germatize it starts to break forth into life right and then it makes one seed wants to grow and and produce fruit amen but the other seed comes forth and all it's producing is is thorns and tissues this is what jesus talked about amen uh i spoke about in the book of matthew when he says here uh about it bring it forth nothing but thorns and tissues what is he saying the thistle can't help being what it is because that's the seed of life that it come from and the wig can't help being a wheat because that's the seed of life it comes from and every seed must bring forth after its kind therefore listen there now he says you see then when that anointing gets on the unjust them false teachers it causes them to do exactly what god's word told them not to do and they can't help it because it's a tissue to begin with that's the seed that's the nature they can't help it it doesn't matter how they try to cultivate the christianity doesn't matter how they try to do it this way it will not change because that's the nature of the thing that it came from amen hallelujah and they will absolutely do absolutely opposite to what god has told them i'm going to wind this up because we have a water baptism how many knows that praise the lord we have a water baptism now so you can start getting uh a person ready if there you go ahead praise the lord now they do exactly what god told them not to do but they'll do it anyhow why they cannot help it how can a thistle be anything else but a thistle or a weed right jesus said that that will be so close that it would deceive the elected if it were possible but because the elect is of the wheat seed it automatically will know a weed it automatically there's nothing about it there's just no weed because the weed life doesn't line up with the life of the world whatsoever it is not possible because a wheat can do nothing but bear wheat and that's all it can bear through its lifetime all the wheat can bear with wheat and next year wheat again and the year after wheat wheat it can't do anything else that's what it was made for and the other one was made for what uh you know to be a deceiver to be a liar to to be a foul bird in the same branches of christianity as the book of revelation tells us sitting in the branches but unclean spirits all manners seducing religious devils within the boundaries of christianity amen oh friends some are even in there to turn around and take the very bible and blind the people and make them indifferent to the word of god but we're calling people back to the original world back to the original faith to stand the way god wants us to stand upon the word of god could you come brother anthony praise the lord hallelujah amen yes sir but when god wants you to hear the right type of word amen it will bring you right inside of the ark so that you can live his life to his glory and to his honor amen aren't you glad that you can say you're one of them amen aren't you glad you're a christian serving the lord as we await on those that will participate in the water baptism uh here let's sing a few uh songs and worship the lord and give glory to his name amen praise god hallelujah amen amen amen god bless you from [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music]

that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that i dare to sing live any longer daring know knowing not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life if you have been planted together in the likeness of death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection in acts 2 37 38 on a day of pentacles [Music] and the acts from 37 they asked [Music] now when they had this they were break in their hearts and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and dreading was shall we do then peter said on them repent and be baptized everyone in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost okay anthony do you come here on your own free moral agency do you renounce any generations pray that i've been following you

afternoon for making a way for our brother to be here to confess and repent to be baptized in your name father you always say that if the people genuinely repent from their heart and be baptized in your name you and obligation to give them your spirit oh god you that never change may your spirit control this mind yes may he never be the same father i cast any generation spirit any spirit has

god bless you we're happy to have you and the lord welcomes you amen part of his body god bless you everyone i'll just say a few words praise god just to um i just felt i needed to [Music] i needed to refer to the passing of queen elizabeth ii um publicly wanted to give recognition of that that she has passed over sibel why there's a lot of people dying and passing but you understand that her passing also has a spiritual significance to it for of the old rulers that reigned and ruled she is the one as a woman that reigned for 70 years 70 years which is like the seven church ages have ended the age of those kinds of rulers have ended just as for the united states they will get no more washington's they'll have no more abraham lincoln's the time for those great men and women of that time is now past it's gone the whole thing is going to start to deteriorate from here on out and it's going to do it rapidly and that that's the symbol it's going to start to deteriorate rapidly now watch quickly just to mention at the same time over england this wasn't publicized in a big way there passed a a multi-colored light pass passed over england and they said they don't know if it's an asteroid if it's a space junk but it can't be they don't know what it is because an asteroid will come and in two seconds it will appear shine and then it'll disappear but this one went for 20 seconds across the place like that and the light was not one colored what was multicolored changing all the time while it was crossing over they don't know what it is but god showing one error has changed gone and now we find out the man of sin and of lawlessness is going to start coming into power rapidly watch these modern events being made clear by vindicated prophecy [Music] not only that but they don't know what's going on they said a rainbow appeared over buckingham palace and simultaneously at the same time juan appeared over windsor castle and another castle that she used to be in another one appeared three rainbows all at the same time over those castles a perfect rain a perfect time but watch friends there are things fixing to happen now and it's going to start happening rapidly watch it all the prophecies that are supposed to take place in the bible whether it's the from the rapture to the change from rapture to tribulation they they change from gentile dispensation over to the jewish dispensation amen all these things keep them in view and let us always keep our minds on that it will not it was not just a simple passing but a very significant one for the glory of god well i trust that we will meet her on the other side if not that is in god's books that's in god's hands that's in god's grace god bless every one of you here today brother anthony end the service
