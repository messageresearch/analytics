our life amen the grace of God is greater than all our sins so without wasting much time I'll go right to the scriptures um I have two scriptures I think the first one is Matthew 9 verse 37-38 and Philippians 31314 when God is say Amen praise God okay so then disciples said unto then said he unto his disciples the Harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the Lord of harvest that he will send forth Libras into his Harvest and then Philippians 3:13 14 Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which I behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press towards the mark of the priz of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let's pray Heavenly most gracious Eternal god father I'm grateful that you made a way for us to be here if I've done anything wrong pleas forgive me just take me aside and speak the right way to your children may you come and bless the remainder of the service may your presence come and speak I I believe they're not here they are not here to hear from me but to hear from Heaven Lord may you speak the needes of the people may their needs father be met in the name of Jesus because where two or three are gathered in your name you pray promise you'll be in our in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen okay please be seated I just want to show a little clip about act of kindness in um five five minutes or so then I go by my title is the real true value in life the real value in Life or the real true value in life okay no no don't worry um I'll paraphrase is fine it's okay um I this really came to me when I saw a clip around the Christmas time about a student who has an abusive parent and the teacher when the young kid comes to school all the case were laughing at him because he wasn't concentrating getting these and all kind of stuff going on in his life and then one time the teacher saw bruises on his hand and he asked him what happened and the guy didn't want the teacher to see so he just ran away and then he left his wallet in the classroom so he followed up to his home but before he got there he realized that yeah okay can I get the volume I didn't do it alone well you truly are an inspiration to all of us and as we ask all the winners of this award who had the biggest impact on your life W that's a good question there was a time in my life when I had nothing but if it wasn't for an exceptional act of kindness shown to me at a very low point in my life I wouldn't be standing here today all I wanted to do was achieve just enough so that I can be in a position to give back to others and finally repay back the debt that I owe to the man who changed my life very good this was a surprise I expected more from you Josh you know you need to pass this class to graduate from high school you should take this seriously how'd you get that bruise all right have a nice day everyone Julie here Josh has anybody seen Josh today um he wasn't in home room maybe he moved now let's be nice it's not my fault he's such a loner yeah he's weird and kind of creepy what did I just say Mr Perkins is better when he's not in class he's such a freak don't just sit there with that stupid look on your face oh I get it oh you think you're so smart than me huh well I got news for you kiddo you dumbing in a bag of rots you ain't never going to M to nothing you know why cuz you a loser only thing you good for what sitting in my house eating my food see not only you stupid you not even the real man real man just sit there and take that unless you was are you a huh is that what you are you just going to sit there with that stupid looking your face take it like a chump if it's like that get out my house Josh you okay hey um I'm sorry I should have seen the sign sooner I should have known what you were going through you remember fall she how life goes so but it doesn't have to be like that shouldn't be like that maybe but it is it's happened a lot three four times a week I wind up down the streets until he soers up then he apologize and he'll take me back and this happened the before you got to D on that test just look right there you know I was actually stopping by to bring you something you mind waiting here give back in 30 minutes not going anywhere all right you dropped this in class yesterday figured you want it back um there's got to be a mistake this is this is my wallet but this isn't my cash or the train ticket no your is not you know no matter what your father tells you you're not dumb in fact you might be the brightest student in my class no it's not you it is you know there's nothing that you can't accomplish if you set your mind to it you've just never had anybody in your corner that's believed in you before till now it's your birthday today right yes yeah I forgot about that I haven't celebrated since I was a kid well you're an adult now legally which means you don't have to stay here any longer it is a chance for you to go off and start a new life for yourself I I I can't accept this I consider it a birthday present to make up for all your past birthdays okay it's my entire savings, no I can't take your savings I insist you take that money and you go make a new start for yourself I'm without your father why are you doing this for me because everybody needs somebody who believes in them I'm going to pay you back for this Mr bins I swear I will you want to know the best way to pay me back you go off and you create a life for yourself that's worth living become a successful man that I know that you are destined to be I don't call it even that's okay yeah what really um I caught my attention was the man giving his life savings everything to save him from abusive life and he went far beyond to help him out and if you can see that in life sometime bra one time he went to a restaurant and the lady that was very poor service he gave him the biggest tip and he was saying that I don't know what he has gone through so sometime don't know what people are going through in life and we have to know how to project grace to the people people and I could realize just for the natural life he could spend his natural all his savings to help somebody in his Natural Life what about what God has done for us what about what we as his children can do back not just for natural life but for eternal life that he has given to us what are you doing with it that's why the Bible said that the the harvest is plenty but the laborers are few so we I know that salvation is of the Lord and none of us can save somebody but we have to make ourselves available we have to do our part so that we can get the last one in so that we can also what go back home and this was a heroic act of kindness but what we have goes beyond that braam talk about um anod V wrinkler ranker whatever his name is that he when one time Germans was attacking the Swiss he stood and gave his life and because of him the Swiss were able to defeat the Jans and they have never fought again and then when he went to Jamaica I told about the story about thees that were there the Maroons there was a man called quo he also United all the tribes and then they defeated the the British up till now so every January 6 they celebrating the kuo but there was one time that the whole human race were in chaos there was no hope anywhere because of what happened in the Garden of Eden the Patriarchs um Abraham and the rest they were seeking a city to come they realize that this is not their home something is not adding up so they seek a city to come job the wisest man in his day he also realized that all the flowers and everything they died in the winter they come come back in summer where does man go when he dies then when he thought about that then God provided a way for him and show him that my redeemer liveth he said that in my flesh I Shall Serve God so what I'm trying to say that that same God is here with us and there was no one who could deliver the human race so the cry went out who is worthy there was no one worthy no human being Moses Abraham all those patrs Enoch none of them was worthy no one was worthy to give up his life and the devil also cannot do because he knows that when he dies that's it for him so God himself became a human being and died on Calvary and shed his blood for you and and me and when he did that he conquered hell grave and death amen all those things were conquered because he gave his life for you and me yes Lord so when that happen we have authority over death over everything death has no where is the stin of death it has no power over you or me all that you have to do is accept what God has done for us he gave his all for you and me and if in Natural Life somebody has to give his all to bring the guy out from the abusive life what about the spiritual the the most important thing no wonder when you check the scriptures all the apostles when they realize that what they have was truth they get gave their all the man gave is everything so in Christianity there is no such a things as halfway either you worship God you don't worship him at all that's why there's no such as a Halfway Christian because that the spirit for the lisia age the people are look W but the Bible said that either you are hot or you are cold you cannot be in between choose whom you serve today if God be god let's serve him with all that is in our heart Body Soul and Spirit if this thing is not true then you live it but if it's true you have to give everything 100% that's what God requires from us so what am I trying to say that sometimes God allow things also to come into our Our Lives if you look at the disciples one time they were in the ship and the Lord has told them the let's go over on the other side go let's go over on the other side and storms came while they were going there were waves in the boat and they were scared they didn't know what to do at that time and they scream that was God testing their faith and God he test the faith of every believer if you're son or daughter of God God is going to try you to see whether you believe or not because it's God knows what he has placed inside of you so those trials and afflictions is come to your life to prove what is inside of you amen because Under Pressure it brings whatever is hiding inside people's heart when people are under pressure that's why you see their real colors but he being God he knows that you are part of him so he promised he never going to give you anything that you cannot bear amen so when the enemy Tri job and went to the end of his Road what was inside of job showed up and it proof for job to know that he what's inside of him is great the same thing Abraham God asked him to give up the very thing that he had cried for for 25 years but his confidence was in God that he was serving that this God cannot fail him because when God gave him the proom promise he swear by himself he didn't swear by anybody so Abraham have the faith and confidence that even if God if that boy died God is able to raise him up so tonight I don't know what you are going through but no matter what you are going through in life whatever storm is in your life look to Jesus look to Jesus he will never fail you he will never leave you nor forsake you he's the same yesterday today and forever what good is a historical God to me if God cannot do what he did in the past to the apostles what good is it to me but that God is ever presentent T so whatever he did to them in the past before because I have the same faith that those Apostles have whatever I'm going through when there's a his everpresent help in times of need when the disciples got the end of their Road and they went into the other side of the ship and woke him up said Jesus saves us he appeared and save them that same God is here his everpresent help in times of need in times of trouble when Jacob was in his D desperate need and his brother was waiting for him to destroy him to kill him he did everything and when he met that angel and he cried out the desperation God show up in present tense I'm not talking about a past tense God I'm talking about a living God a god of reality a God that keeps his word a god that when we are praying you are not praying to the wind you are not just speaking you are speaking to a living being who is close to us he hears our hearts cry no matter what you are going through that God is here he's the Living God he's not fire in the skies because remember when the apostles when they went when that time Christ God was with them so they went and woke him up but the god that was with them that God is in you and in me today so you can't wake him up from your inside Sam bra said the god that they secking they going to say that he's in their heart because they said that I will be with you even what in you until the consumation of what of time so that God is in you and in me today he's not only with us he said I'll be with you even in in you he's in his bride he's in his attributes the part of him is in you now because he shed his blood before he couldn't live in you and me but when he gave up the ghost the first people who witnessed that who have that thing was the apostles and he became available to them and ever since that this promise is unto you and to them that are far of as far as the many are God shall what shall called so is God still calling yes am then as soon as God is calling that spirit is available for them and the end time evangelic is to what seek the Lost bride we looking for the attributes of God and and in looking for them sometime you might get all those things but what that you eyed on is the true bride of Christ the true that's what we are looking for so once that last one comes in we can go up amen but until then you have to fight you have to do everything that we can do to get the one in we have to live a life that will attract the people our life is a billboard that the people are reading your Epistles read of all menen who do think man I reading is your life my life so we have to be careful the life that we lead because you are an example you representing Jesus Christ I us to tell my daughters that you have to know that what you are doing is it pleasing to God because we are in a society that a lot of people make decisions based on emotions they see the condition how people are crying how they are doing then they go and make decisions but God doesn't want us to make decision based on emotion not based on the um not based on emotions or what you feel all our decisions has to based on the word of God it starts to line up of this if it doesn't line up with this just don't go ahead with it because it's going to go and bite you back somewhere amen so you have to check your life you have to check your decisions that you are not moved by um by by emotions every decision has to line up because decisions that you are making today is going to affect you by 5 years time so you have to make sure that you make the right decisions and that de shouldn't based should be based on only the revelation of the word because we have access to the Lord Jesus Christ we have access to his word we have access to everything we have need of so when you are in a situation you have to have a don't take side go to him ask him and if you don't lean to one side and you be H neutral he will make it plain because our God is a living God he's not God only yesterday he's yes the same yesterday today and forever his everpresent help in times of trouble he's God of today not only of yesterday amen hallelujah praise God so our god is awesome he's the same yesterday today and forever he never lost a battle he hasn't lost no case he's a physician that never lose a patient he is a lawyer that never he's a he's a lawyer that never lost a case and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen he's a mighty conqueror Hallelujah he conquered death grave and everything that same God is here hallelujah praise our God hallelujah so what am I trying to say the word of God said that God he said that all that God was he p into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into what the church said I will be with you evening you until the consumation of what of the time so you that Christ is living inside of you I'm going to read this little quote over here he said that because my title is what is the Great greatest value in life all this act of kindness is good and we should do them but all those things none of them had it's good only for temporary if the people do not know God they're going to get the reward here temporary they're going to feel good it's nice to feel good there's nothing wrong them we should do them but the real thing that value is this one here that brother Braham said he said I asked my wife not long ago I said I want to ask you something Hy I said what is real True Value Place on I believe I told you that do the other night what the true value nothing but lost souls is the only thing that's got any value in it money passes away homes Decay and go away everything in the Earth moves away the only value lasting value I rather have one soul in glory that I want to Christ to know and see that light of God circles around that Soul through all eternity my name to be associated with that than to have every penny of money in the whole earth cuz I have to lose it all but what you sent up there is eternal and that's the reason we are trying Hallelujah that's the reason we are trying to get the last one in so that you can leave this P house because there's time to go home every everything is set up for the com is the rupturing time in a twinkle of ey you going to be changed and be in his presence so that's why we are trying to get the last one in there is nothing wrong with money money is good can use them here for not for a temporary we need them but the most important that has value is eternal life I'm not saying that all of us will be able to go and witness and bring people but you have to ask God what portion do you want are you fulfilling in my life because whatever God has promised to fulfill in you you are going to fulfill it it's your portion he if you have not if you don't fulfill that you are not going anywhere because some of us God wants us just to pray like dwart Moody the lady that God used her to um bring him to Christ she prayed for she prayed for the boy when she was um giving trust doing everything and that minister went on that day only the minister and the lady was there and they were praying and God brought Dwight Moody and go the the Bible said that where two or three are gathered in my name I'm in your mid the preacher was preaching like he was preaching to like 10,000 people but it was only one soul and the Bible said that what shall profit a man when he gain the whole world and loses his soul so one soul is important for the whole world everything in this world so that's what our Focus to be our Prime Focus to get one for Jesus and I believe that the the vision statement of this CH is that changing the world one person at a time one person at a time as the teacher did he transformed one life and that life has a ripple effect so our purpose is transform one person at a time that one person up not only for the Natural Life which we we can help them the natural life but we are transformed them to what to receive eternal life if they are part of the predestinated plan of God to receive that eternal life so that their life will not be the same life eternal the Great thing that anyone has can have is eternal life that's what we are trying for that's what we are PR we have trying for to get the last one in so let's all get into our positions those that has to pray has to pray those that have the money that cannot go they can support with their money Hallelujah any part that you have to do your part and God will bless you thank you when that soul is hovering in heaven it's not only the one who went to preach or wit to bring him those who support with money you going to receive your reward those who pray they going to receive your reward whatever part that you took you're going to receive your reward so let's let's work together as a team let's work as a team support one another with our prayers support them the best that you can if one Falls let's raise them upen let's raise them up I don't like people who bring people down when they make mistake correct them but let support them yes you have made mistake but God doesn't want to stay in your mistakes sometimes God even allow us to see the mistakes of others what are you going to do with it what are your motive of telling someone about someone mistake if it's not about praying for the person to support him then you have to keep your mouth um don't don't don't talk about it because we have to be there for one another we have to be there for one another and our main plan purpose is to get the last one in so that we can go to our final destination because this world is not our own but I believe I'm afraid sometimes we have been too lukewarm some sometimes we are taking the to like Aisa approach and I'm afraid that God has to do something God is the disciples what he what did he did they were all feeling comfortable in their hopes and when their persecution came they have no place to go they ran and then they spread the gospel so God if we do not become desperate he going to bring the the condition to make us desperate so that we have to fulfill what he has ordained us to fulfill because even your unbelief cannot stop God whatever God has ordained you to fulfill your unbelief whatever you do it will never hinder God that thing will come to pass remember Zakaria in the Bible God promised him you going to have a son he doubted he suffered for a while but that promise came through him he couldn't run away from that promise so that same God is here with us tonight amen he's the same yesterday today and forever and back to the the the disciples in the ship I think they forgot that the god that created the storm the god that created the rain was in their midst and they began to shake tonight I don't know what you are going through but I want to tell you tonight whatever sickness whatever things that is bothering you the creator that created you is greater than that sickness that sickness has to bow down to the creator that created you no matter what you are going through the Creator the creator of who created everything is greater than everything every knee has to Bow every tongue Jesus Christ is God every sickness every oppression every financial problem it has to bow down in the name of Jesus because the Creator is here to bring your needs to pass he's the same yesterday today for forever everything has to bow down to him so those are subject to him he's the Creator the Creations canot have power over the Creator so don't worry about what you are going through just commit to Christ Jesus amen he going to bring it to pass because our God hasn't changed he's the same yesterday today and forever amen the problem of it is sometimes the leaders Jesus Christ Moses all those who they have problem with the leaders in their time who were bringing doubts and things to the people in the time of Jesus the Pharisees and the sadu they were the leaders and they were what criticizing the very thing that God said it was going to come because most said that the Lord God will raise a prophet onto like me and when he came he fulfill everything that mes talk about him but they criticized that because it wasn't according to what their way of thinking it wasn't according to their culture how they have what been brought up but his everpresent help in the time of trouble those who were ordained to life the 120 out of millions they went to the upper room to receive the pro promise because they were God's children for that day and that same God is here tonight he hasn't change amen he's the same yesterday today and forever he'll bring everything to pass so what am I trying to say is that God is an awesome God he's up to something big and I am part of it and you are part of it amen hallelujah praise God hallelujah amen every knee shall bow every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is God hallelujah amen praise our wonderful God thank you Jesus amen hallelujah so what I was trying to say is that the Bible said that greater than this shall you also what do greater way because we know that no one can do greater than God we did what it's more many member body we can do more so the emphasiz I'm trying to see trying to say that as Christ was with the disciples now in our time he is in us so if God is in us then God is trying to tell us that um Greater Works than this shall you also do he said that now notice the greater W was to have the power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to Believers the Holy Ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church the bride to impart life oh that's what Calvary meant it took St degraded men and women and lifted them into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedience Believers men who were once unbelievers be made Believers and impart spiritual eternal life in other words you are an amature God you have that path of God in you to impact eternal life that impact of eternal life for you you for God to use you to bring somebody in so that the person receive the same holy ghost that you have so that his life will have a purpose in life because remember the only true value is for someone to have the life eternal all the rest is just temporary amen all the rest is just temporary one time David was worry and thinking that why the prosperity of the ricked in Psalm 74 if I can find it was2 Psalm 74 72 73 okay yeah Psalm 7 new Bible here Psalm 73:26 yeah okay Psalm 23 truly God is a good to Israel even to search as of clean heart but as for me my feet were almost gone my step had well nice sleep for I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked for there are no binds in their death but their strength is firm they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other men therefore Pride Compass them about as a chain violence covered them as a garment their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart could wish they are corrupt and speak wickedly concern oppression they speak lofly they set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue walk through the Earth therefore his people return hither and water of and Waters of full cap are run out to them and they say how do God know and is there knowledge in the most high behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they increase in riches very I have cleansed my heart in in vain and wash my hands in innocency for all the day long have I been plag and chasten every morning if I say I'll speak th behold I should offend against the generation of the children when I T to know this it was too painful for me until I went into the sanctuary of God then I understood their end in other words David was envious of the prosperity of the wicked but when he went in the sanctuary of God then he know their end so what I'm trying to say that don't worry God promised that we going to leave you of the great substance but the wicked they get more than even what their hands even wor but when he went to the sanctuary of God he know because they have their life will come to an end for temporary for a short time but ours is what Eternal Eternal has no end that's the main thing that's what has value because the prosperity of the wicked is only for short time here but our prosperity he said that above all things I wish you prosper and be in health even as your so what prospered amen prosperity in all three areas but they got that Prosperity just the natural thing and it comes to an end so the red thing that has value is what we should strive for what we should try to bring the last one in so that we can live from here and go to our reward amen that's all it is for tonight amen hallelujah I think that's all has value Hallelujah nothing else and also what really strike me you can come right through me that I count on myself to have apprend apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth onto those things which are before I press towards the mark for the price of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus say that means that we have to press on and leave our everything behind 2023 is gone but 2024 I have purpose in my heart that I rededicate my life I reconsecrate my life I will try and seek the loss the best that I can and let God bring them to what to the right person because remember AER I know he types the messenger but when Abraham told him to go and look for a bride for his son he what he prayed first so if we do everything by prayer I believe that God will direct us to the right person at the right time who needs to be because remember I said no one there join the church and let God what add them to it it's all about God's doing but we just going to make ourself available so that he can use us and bring the last one in that's the only thing that has True Value that's all I have for [Applause] tonight I know my redeemer I [Music] know all of
