TRANSCRIPT
========================================
because you can't miss this blessed be the name of the Lord in a wider breakdown in the wisdom versus faith brother brother says Jesus used the father's worked Satan used the father's worked but Shaitan the Satan it can never be anything but Satan that's why don't you think this when you hear those voices that speak to you and put all kinds of fear and doubt into your thoughts that's not God remember that anything that gets spoken to you that is contrary to all things are possible send it back to health working because you are not ordained to receive them all semen can do is like the greatest battle brother brother brother said the greatest battle that you're going to fight is the one between your two years in your mind is when you receive lives from the enemy this is not the hour to believe wise this is not the hour to believe if it and allowing fear to dominate your walk with talk Enoch pleased God because he walked with God and he had a testimony that he pleased God you think it pleases God when you speak you speak things that's not the Spirit of God this is the season right now with us perfecting us God is taking you know all those things that so easily besets because we're gonna run this race these things that so easily be put aside they gotta be moved aside we want to take what God said and we want to take it and believe it and we want to speak it we want to be positive positive positive not negative but we are a positive body of Christ others so here Satan was Satan Jesus was God that's the difference that's the truth lots of Creed and the other ones the word what is true and the other one is false Louisville produces the other can't produce it you see the difference you are all dating to produce you are ordained there's nothing in other words in order for you to finish the race you will need to stay nourished you will need to build not to assemble as often as humanly possible because here you know it's like how can you repeat how can you you know like listen yes the Spirit of God is everywhere but when there's a certain time and season were where the sons and daughters have not gathered together something special takes place and you can never replace that you can never repeat that moment you cannot repeat that moment because it could be right at that time in your walk that certain line of faith that certain level of faith that certain word of God that you needed and it came to you right at that time right on that service spiritual food and due season so that you could you need to overcome the trials the Bible says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith and to him that overcometh he goes up and he says why the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God and so overcoming is a part of receiving and you see it's all goddess this is working everything for your book everything works together for good you see the whole Word of God just starts to come together like a perfect puzzle that there's just no way that you can possibly put all these scriptures together you know and just make it work just right and just at the right time and at the right season so overcoming is important so when you face a trial you need to know why you're facing that trial is it so that you can overcome and so it's because as you're overcoming you're receiving the spirit and hearing the spirit give you instruction on how to overcome you see how it's all so simple but then it all just works together you need to expect the competition as long as you're here and you're gonna run this race you don't need to know about competition and you hopefully are worthy only your best competitor is the devil because he's constantly telling you who you aren't and I can kept but you can't find the word and you can't find that worthy to Sutter the daughter of a cop so you must expect that you're gonna have to overcome that you're gonna have to face trials that you're gonna have a competition in the race and then you're gonna have to press on have to push through you're gonna have to face the world situations you're gonna have to face those circumstances but those circumstances they're really working through your trust your coach trust your posture trust the ministry that God has placed you under you need to trust that goddess positions cultures around your life to train you so that you can overcome and with grace somebody that's not willing to take the instruction of a coach that cults don't like those kind of players they're rebellious and there's an the only place rebellion came from was from Satan himself he's the author of rebellion so when there's a rebellious spirit of you that ain't up dot you know that thing that raised us up you know every time that somebody you know of authority you know you know if you're at work and you know you might not like your boss the fact that he's you know got a certain characteristic about him in this and that he swears a lot or he's Balder or he's you know always chasing after the women or whatever it is but that doesn't change who you are and that you must obey those that are over you in your in your chicken urine in your workplace as a boss I'm not talking about where he's going to come and he's going to try and pull any of that stuff on you that I just mentioned there no that's not what I mean but knowing that there's thora T's that have been placed there because God has placed them there well what about God's authorities and when God's you know generals they get into their position and they start to correct you and lead you and guide you and you don't want to take that direction you rebelled against that direction that's that's going to be one of your weaknesses and you need to overcome that you need to overcome that spirit of this world that that constantly wants you to lead out against your leadership against those that have been given certain authority over you to direct you and guide you in this life hallelujah and you need to have a winning attitude you've got to have a winning attitude you got to be a team player you're gonna be in the body of Christ and you're going to support this relay team because remember we are in can't above by on us they're waiting on us to perfect our faith all those heroes of faith that overcame in their time and their season so that they can overcome so that they can live the race they're leading now on a stearate dirt dirt they're watching all they're watching down on us and they're rooting for us and they're either saying hey have that lame attitude have that attitude always believed up always believed God that all things are possible to them that believe all things are possible to them that believe praise God Alleluia all things not some things all things we're on the same team and we're all in the body of Christ if you've been renovated with the word god bless you Saints the Lord bless you and me and overcome the circumstances they had just gone end and let the word that was placed inside of you tonight don't try to explain don't try to interpret it just know that God placed overcoming power in you tonight because you're
