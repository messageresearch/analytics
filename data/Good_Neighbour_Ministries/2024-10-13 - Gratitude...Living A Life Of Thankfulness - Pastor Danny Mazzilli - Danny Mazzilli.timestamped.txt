[37:08] bit more on what is going on there okay
[37:11] so we'll we'll leave it at that listen
[37:14] we prayed for a family a
[37:17] pastor um in India who um is a message
[37:21] believer for many years has a a Ministry
[37:24] established church there and they were
[37:26] attacked because he had you know
[37:29] testified and converted a Muslim to the
[37:32] word of God and the message of the hour
[37:34] while the devil got real upset and so
[37:37] they put a false accusation against him
[37:41] that um that he burnt the
[37:44] Coran and so all of a sudden they're
[37:47] after him to really to you know they'll
[37:50] they'll they'll kill him and his family
[37:53] so they had to go into isolation they
[37:54] had to go into hiding and so they are
[37:57] now there's a there's a a work in
[37:59] progress to get them out of India all
[38:02] right and so brother Dana who knows the
[38:05] brother personally has been there with
[38:08] the brother okay so you know after
[38:11] talking to brother Dana I you know the
[38:14] Holy Spirit just laid it on on our on
[38:16] our heart you know my on my heart and
[38:19] you know I said we need to do something
[38:21] and so we have participated in giving
[38:26] financially towards this so keep that
[38:30] family in prayer keep them in prayer
[38:32] they're supposed to be getting them out
[38:34] I believe it was all in progress they
[38:36] had gotten to the airport at one point
[38:39] and then they got stopped because of
[38:42] some documentation issues and so they
[38:45] held them they missed their flight and
[38:47] but then um there's other things in
[38:50] progress to get them out they may
[38:52] already be out by now okay so let's
[38:55] continue to pray and let's continue to
[38:58] give because we don't know where the
[39:00] Lord is going to lead us from time to
[39:02] time to support this type of um
[39:06] emergency that can raise up right
[39:09] amongst our Brethren amen praise God
[39:12] also uh this week I came
[39:15] across um and found out that uh uh
[39:18] Pastor Donnie Reagan and his church Word
[39:21] of Life
[39:24] in in um uh
[39:28] Johnsonville um Johnson City I believe
[39:33] that's in Tennessee right yeah um they
[39:36] started an effort to assist the people
[39:39] of Florida with the flood
[39:41] relief and so um what they've done is
[39:44] they've you know they've they've just
[39:46] put out a call it started with just one
[39:49] of the brothers in the church connecting
[39:50] with some people that he found out
[39:52] needed some serious help and that
[39:56] sparked some something where the Lord
[39:58] just moved supernaturally on his
[40:00] ministry and they started to um put out
[40:04] a call and there was a great response
[40:08] that came out um from many churches
[40:10] across the US they started to give they
[40:13] started to donate there are message
[40:15] churches that were seriously affected by
[40:18] the floods churches flooded out serious
[40:22] damage Etc but more importantly people
[40:25] needed the necessities of life
[40:27] and so they started this work and over
[40:30] the last two
[40:32] weeks they've delivered 77 truck
[40:37] loads and 28 full trailers of
[40:42] supplies to people in Florida where they
[40:46] were most
[40:49] affected they prepared over
[40:52] 1670 hot meals that were delivered
[40:57] they helped to clear roads the funds
[40:59] went to help to clear roads and an
[41:02] estimated
[41:03] 175 lives were saved between digging
[41:07] them out getting supplies to them
[41:11] Etc that's how serious this event and
[41:16] this hurricane was Hurricane helina amen
[41:20] and so the Lord allowed us to be
[41:23] participants in that so that we gave
[41:27] or in are in the process of giving right
[41:30] now towards this
[41:33] relief um so thank God for this
[41:36] wonderful work that the Lord is doing
[41:38] we're his hands we're his feet and you
[41:41] know you know these things come up and
[41:43] it's great that we can help those that
[41:45] are in other countries in Africa and
[41:48] India and so forth and we will do that
[41:51] but sometimes it hits right at home and
[41:53] we need to be prepared to do what we can
[41:56] to support
[41:58] and and do what we can to help these
[42:00] these unfortunate people that have been
[42:02] seriously affected by this so God bless
[42:04] you continue to give as the Lord leads
[42:07] give to the missions give to the relief
[42:10] for these types of things we want to be
[42:12] able to give and be channels for the
[42:16] Lord amen praise God glory to God okay
[42:19] so let's let's move on now um we know
[42:22] that this week um you know last week we
[42:25] we ministered on uh the Feast of the
[42:28] Trumpets on rashash Shana and this week
[42:31] this weekend it ends up with yam Kapur
[42:34] uh it's a Jewish feast and Festival
[42:36] amongst the um the the Jewish Believers
[42:41] and so um you know I just thought you
[42:43] know that's not my topic today we'll see
[42:45] how the Lord leads us but I just thought
[42:47] I would just you know bring this here
[42:50] today uh just a a quote from Brother
[42:52] Brenham from the Feast of the trumpets
[42:55] so we understand what's really going on
[42:58] you know prophetically in the world with
[43:01] Israel and the church and so here now
[43:05] brother Bram speaking here in the
[43:07] message he says now here is the calling
[43:10] out at the six seal when it was opened
[43:15] the persecution struck the Jews in the
[43:18] literal standpoint and we know that you
[43:21] know there was a there was a persecution
[43:23] that came against the Jews and here
[43:25] comes the persecution to the church
[43:27] because remember this is Israel and the
[43:30] church the church is the spiritual
[43:33] Israel being the natural what we see
[43:36] happening in Israel we know spiritually
[43:39] the church has gone through the same
[43:41] type of persecution like it did through
[43:44] the Dark Ages and so forth there's
[43:47] always been a persecution for the true
[43:50] church that's why when the word was made
[43:53] flesh came to the Earth they persecuted
[43:56] him amen they they they crucified the
[43:59] word amen and so but we need to
[44:01] understand what's going on and from a uh
[44:04] so he says here in the e e e
[44:08] e ecclesiastical standpoint because the
[44:12] bride is already called the sabbaths are
[44:16] over and ready for the Jews now to be
[44:19] called amen amen and so the sabbaths are
[44:22] over the Feast of atonement oh Church
[44:26] don't don't you see that called To The
[44:29] Feast of atonement what to recognize the
[44:34] atonement not no more chickens and geese
[44:37] and you know they would sacrific lambs
[44:40] and so forth and what they're doing but
[44:43] the Lamb of God slain from the
[44:47] foundation of the world Israel is going
[44:51] to know
[44:53] that they're going to receive their
[44:56] atonement their Awakening that's what
[44:58] this weekend is yam Kapur is about them
[45:03] coming to their atonement coming to
[45:05] recognize you know that that they've
[45:07] sinned and that they've that they
[45:09] actually missed the the they're going to
[45:11] recognize that they missed the Messiah
[45:14] but God's going to send them two
[45:15] prophets amen and they're going to have
[45:17] their Awakening but guess where we're
[45:19] going to be hallelujah we're going to be
[45:21] in glory amen the church goes into the
[45:24] Rapture because when those two prophets
[45:27] come on the scene this world is going to
[45:29] go into some serious three and 1/2 year
[45:32] tribulation amen so praise God so let's
[45:36] all stand now we're going to go to our
[45:37] message for today I just thought I would
[45:39] just make a comment on that so that we
[45:42] can recognize and you know when you see
[45:44] all of this going on and everything
[45:46] that's happening right now with Israel
[45:48] and
[45:48] Iran this is serious business Saints
[45:53] this is this is all scriptural Iran has
[45:56] always been behind you know we don't
[45:59] want to get into it all right now but
[46:01] let's see how the Lord leads us as we go
[46:04] forward over these next few weeks amen

[49:46] [Applause]
[49:49] amen simple but very true amen let's
[49:53] read our scripture let's all stand
[49:57] Hebrews 13: 12-6 says wherefore Jesus
[50:02] also that he might sanctify the people
[50:05] with his own blood suffered without the
[50:09] gate you know we're talking about
[50:12] gratitude but I want us to really focus
[50:15] on what we really are grateful for amen
[50:20] and Jesus came so that we could
[50:24] experience real true
[50:27] gratitude let us go forth therefore unto
[50:30] him without the camp bearing his Repro
[50:34] his
[50:35] reproach for here have we no continuing
[50:39] City but we seek one to come by him
[50:42] therefore let us offer the sacrifice of
[50:46] praise to God continually that is the
[50:51] fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
[50:55] name but to do good and to communicate
[50:58] forget
[51:00] not for with such
[51:03] sacrifices God is well pleased
[51:07] Hallelujah the Lord add His blessings to
[51:08] the word you may be
[51:09] seated amen if there's something saints
[51:13] that we need to be truly grateful for is
[51:17] the fact that that that we've been given
[51:20] the ability to recognize the Plan of
[51:23] Redemption God's Plan of Redemption it
[51:26] started way before the foundations of
[51:29] the world but it
[51:31] manifested here on Earth about 2,00
[51:34] years ago when Jesus Christ God himself
[51:38] was made flesh came to the Earth and he
[51:42] had to Bear the reproach outside of the
[51:45] camp he was not accepted no he's still
[51:49] not fully accepted in this
[51:52] generation he's only accepted by those
[51:55] that have truly recognized and have have
[51:58] realized the word of God for their day
[52:02] that Jesus Christ is in a is in is in
[52:04] the present stage of his ministry that
[52:07] he is speaking healing delivering
[52:10] opening the eyes of the understanding of
[52:13] those that are still requiring the
[52:16] healing of of blindness to the true word
[52:19] of God but you know what it requires it
[52:22] it requires for us to go outside of our
[52:26] normal
[52:27] Camp it requires for us to to step
[52:30] outside of our comfort zone and stand
[52:34] for the word of God the pure
[52:35] unadulterated word of God Amen not to
[52:39] tell the people you got to be perfect
[52:41] you got to live a perfect life oh look
[52:44] at me I live a perfect life shame on you
[52:47] if you think you live a perfect life you
[52:49] do not live a perfect life there's
[52:51] nobody that can live a perfect life the
[52:54] only perfect life is Jes Jesus Christ
[52:57] God himself and if he's in you then then
[53:01] that's holy you're not holy but he is
[53:05] the holy one that's in you and it's not
[53:08] your righteousness it's his
[53:10] righteousness amen and so for us to be
[53:13] able to stand and you know to to stand
[53:17] the reproach for the word of God we've
[53:19] got to know that we
[53:21] know it's then that we can truly be
[53:25] grateful and we can't be afraid you know
[53:28] to to to live this life to communicate
[53:31] it to allow it to be expressed through
[53:35] the Gratitude in our lives to let people
[53:38] you know say hey what are you thankful
[53:40] for this
[53:41] Thanksgiving there's nothing that comes
[53:44] to my mind that I could ever be more

[53:49] of God has been revealed in my heart to
[53:55] know that those oh I see the conditions
[53:57] of the world I see all that's taking
[54:00] place around us in this world what what

[54:25] aside where our Pilgrim forefathers set
[54:29] that day aside to give thanks to God for
[54:32] what they had amen what he had done for
[54:37] us for blessing them giving them crops
[54:41] and so forth It's one real American day

[55:32] forefathers who fought to bring this
[55:35] freedom to us and left the other
[55:38] countries so that we could have freedom
[55:41] of worship and freedom of speech and
[55:44] freedom of press and so forth we're
[55:47] thankful yet for it we don't know how
[55:50] long it will last that way but I say

[55:57] Freedom's Holy Light amen protect us by
[56:02] thy might great God our King amen amen
[56:07] praise God if there's a message that we
[56:09] need to uh you know share with the
[56:11] people is that there is no real hope or
[56:16] future except for the coming of the Lord
[56:20] Jesus this world has a prophetic
[56:24] timetable amen it's under that timetable
[56:28] right now we don't know how much longer
[56:31] this Earth is going to remain in the
[56:33] condition that it is I can tell you for
[56:36] many countries right now they're already

[56:46] place in Florida this is all part of the
[56:51] prophecy of this world that it's going

[57:04] natural disaster that that breaks the
[57:06] record of the previous natural disaster
[57:10] why because it's not going to get better
[57:13] on Earth amen and that's why the only
[57:17] safe place is Jesus Christ the only safe
[57:22] place when when Noah received his
[57:25] message in his day God said build an ark
[57:29] Hallelujah today God saying to you build
[57:32] a life around Jesus Christ let him be
[57:35] your force field let him be the shackles
[57:39] that that that shackle you and keep you
[57:42] in in the safe place in God's Ark which
[57:46] is God's word amen let the Holy Spirit
[57:50] be your breastplate Hallelujah let the
[57:53] helmet of Faith be something that you

[58:21] blessings and we need to we need to
[58:24] express it we need to show it need to
[58:26] deliberately you know intentionally do
[58:29] things that show gratitude in our lives
[58:32] amen you know that when you come into
[58:35] the house of the Lord when you join and
[58:37] you you you you become a a member in in
[58:41] a local assembly somewhere under the
[58:44] leadership of of the Holy Spirit you are
[58:47] in the service of the Lord amen and that
[58:50] is intentional service unto God and that
[58:54] you can be blessed as a result of that
[58:57] amen praise God let's go to the next
[59:00] slide what is
[59:02] gratitude gratitude is the practice of
[59:06] actively
[59:07] remembering and expressing the grace
[59:11] benefits we do not deserve that's what
[59:15] Grace is we didn't
[59:18] deserve the grace of God in our lives
[59:22] that he would come in and say forgiven
[59:24] amen hallelujah
[59:27] forgiven like you never done it in the
[59:30] first place what kind of mercy and Grace
[59:33] is that amen we didn't deserve that and
[59:36] goodness bestowed upon Our Lives amen
[59:40] praise God you know it's um I I took
[59:45] some a short list of the top 10 benefits
[59:49] you know from one author
[59:52] online and these are the top 10 benefits
[59:56] number one gratitude has lasting
[1:00:00] positive effects on the brain this is
[1:00:04] scientifically proven am somebody that's
[1:00:06] positive true somebody that's positive
[1:00:09] is usually somebody that's very grateful
[1:00:12] amen think about it positive people are
[1:00:14] grateful people negative people they're
[1:00:18] not they're they're they're miserable
[1:00:21] they're they're they're you know like we
[1:00:22] saw in the video instead of focusing on
[1:00:24] the good they focus F us on the
[1:00:27] grievance they focus on the bad amen and
[1:00:30] so when when you've got negative
[1:00:32] thoughts there's no way you can produce
[1:00:34] real
[1:00:36] gratitude gratitude boosts the immune
[1:00:40] system Hallelujah gratitude reduces
[1:00:44] stress anxiety and

[1:00:52] positivity gratitude number five helps
[1:00:56] create and strengthen
[1:00:59] relationships gratitude reduces chronic
[1:01:04] pain really it's a proven fact people
[1:01:09] that are positive that are grateful that
[1:01:11] are always showing thankfulness and
[1:01:14] living a life of thankfulness are people
[1:01:17] that are healthier they're just
[1:01:20] naturally healthier gratitude improves
[1:01:22] overall sleep gratitude Keeps Us

[1:01:42] you go online you could probably find
[1:01:45] all kinds of information surrounding
[1:01:47] gratitude but all of this positive info
[1:01:51] um you know brings us to a question on
[1:01:54] are you living living a life of

[1:02:01] to the left and to the right to your
[1:02:03] brothers and sisters are you really

[1:02:31] those of the household of faith but you
[1:02:33] need to be grateful for your natural
[1:02:35] families for your work amen for your
[1:02:39] bosses and for your companies and and
[1:02:42] for your doctors and you know like
[1:02:45] listen I experienced something here just
[1:02:48] recently I'm grateful that we've got
[1:02:50] ohip and that we've got you know medical
[1:02:53] coverages here in Canada uh you know
[1:02:56] that sometimes we take it for granted
[1:02:59] but my daughter had an accident in
[1:03:01] Australia and she required emergency
[1:03:05] surgery on her knee lucky she had
[1:03:08] insurance coverage and the insurance
[1:03:11] coverage covered to bring her back from
[1:03:14] Australia to Canada it cost it cost the
[1:03:18] the insurance company over
[1:03:20] $1,000 to fly her home because she
[1:03:23] couldn't come in just a not natural seat
[1:03:26] you know like they had to put her into a
[1:03:29] a first class environment with her own
[1:03:31] bed and everything because of the
[1:03:33] situation that was going on in her leg
[1:03:36] and so but thank God she bought the
[1:03:40] insurance on her
[1:03:41] own that saved her a lot of money so
[1:03:44] there's a lesson for everybody you young
[1:03:46] people you're going out you're traveling
[1:03:48] all she was doing was going to play a
[1:03:50] friendly game of soccer and she ripped
[1:03:52] her meniscus in a serious way and and it
[1:03:55] required surgery but make sure you
[1:03:59] always take out insurance when you
[1:04:00] travel it's important because you never
[1:04:03] know what could happen but they would
[1:04:05] not cover the surgery there they said no
[1:04:09] because you have coverage in Canada you
[1:04:11] need to fly to your home country and
[1:04:14] have it done there and a surgery like
[1:04:17] that we costed it out it was like
[1:04:22] $22,000 thank God we've got the
[1:04:25] privilege of having medical coverage we
[1:04:27] need to be grateful for those things
[1:04:31] amen amen too many people are always
[1:04:35] bashing the the government for this
[1:04:37] bashing it for that why because they're
[1:04:39] focused on the negative focus on what's
[1:04:43] good and keep yourself
[1:04:46] healthy because negative people usually
[1:04:49] get sick Y and they're sick more often
[1:04:53] than they're not because it's a negative
[1:04:56] atmosphere that they bring around their
[1:04:59] lives amen praise God and so are you
[1:05:02] living a life of gratitude can you
[1:05:04] remember the last time that you took the
[1:05:06] time to thank God for all the things
[1:05:11] that we mentioned here this morning and
[1:05:13] we see that you know because it's a Bene
[1:05:16] a beneficial way to live doesn't mean
[1:05:18] it's easy CU it's not easy we go through
[1:05:22] times of difficulty we go through times
[1:05:25] of uh medical and you know health issues
[1:05:28] and so forth and that's never easy
[1:05:31] because we know the devil the enemy is
[1:05:33] going to constantly try to afflict us so
[1:05:36] that he can prove that God is Not A
[1:05:38] Healer but we keep coming back and
[1:05:41] saying Thank You Lord you are the Lord
[1:05:43] God that Health all my
[1:05:45] diseases oh thank you Lord You're Still
[1:05:48] the Lord God you still wish to prosper
[1:05:51] me Lord even in in health you see I
[1:05:55] thank you for that father and that
[1:05:57] defeats the enemy that puts a positive
[1:06:00] energy and sends the enforcer instantly
[1:06:03] into your life and into your situations
[1:06:06] to bring healing into your body amen
[1:06:09] glory to God let's take a look here
[1:06:11] we're going to look at a few examples
[1:06:13] through the
[1:06:14] scriptures of you know gratitude so
[1:06:17] let's go to our first scripture here in
[1:06:19] Luke uh chapter 17 from verse 11 to13
[1:06:22] we're just going to move through it
[1:06:24] quickly and comment but I want you to
[1:06:26] draw some things here today this is not
[1:06:28] a deep message Saints this is practical
[1:06:32] things that we need to realize and
[1:06:35] recognize that you know if you want
[1:06:38] great miracles in your lives and you
[1:06:40] want to see God move you need to go back
[1:06:43] to the simple ABCs amen of always
[1:06:47] looking to see what the word says about
[1:06:51] you and your life and how you can live
[1:06:55] it better better amen so here he says
[1:06:58] and it and it came to pass Jesus as he
[1:07:01] went through
[1:07:03] Jerusalem that he passed through the
[1:07:06] midst of Samaria and Galilee and as he
[1:07:09] entered into the certain Village there
[1:07:12] met him 10 men that were lepers which
[1:07:15] stood AAR off and they lifted up their
[1:07:18] voices and said Jesus Master have mercy
[1:07:24] on us
[1:07:26] now you know first of all in their
[1:07:30] calling out they must have known that
[1:07:33] Jesus was a
[1:07:35] Healer amen they must have known that
[1:07:38] that that he did certain things he did
[1:07:41] miracles for others and so they were in
[1:07:44] a state of desperation amen and they
[1:07:47] probably heard that Jesus was was a
[1:07:49] miracle healer amen and you know and
[1:07:52] that this was all part of his ministry
[1:07:54] as he moved from City to city and they
[1:07:58] came seeking healing for themselves as
[1:08:01] lepers amen you know leprosy is a type
[1:08:05] of sin leprosy is just another sickness
[1:08:09] when sickness comes into your life and
[1:08:12] it and it attacks your body we know that
[1:08:15] that is it's a devil disease is anything
[1:08:21] that's sickness is not of God God is the
[1:08:24] Healer of sickness amen so you know so
[1:08:29] sometimes sin you know we live lives and
[1:08:32] and we and we start to build all kinds
[1:08:34] of sin around our lives amen praise God
[1:08:38] well lepers back in that time they were
[1:08:41] forced to live in isolated
[1:08:45] communities you know there's a lot of
[1:08:47] people that are that are uh living lives
[1:08:51] isolated lives not knowing that Jesus
[1:08:54] Christ is is here today that's able to
[1:08:58] do like he did for them amen there's a
[1:09:01] lot of people that need to know that
[1:09:04] they don't have to stay in that
[1:09:06] condition they they they need to know
[1:09:09] that they don't have to allow sin to
[1:09:11] control their lives and keep them in a
[1:09:13] defeated you know medical condition or
[1:09:16] or financially beat down condition or a
[1:09:19] broken relationship condition amen they
[1:09:22] need to realize that Jesus Christ is
[1:09:25] here here present this morning and if
[1:09:27] you cry out to Jesus this morning
[1:09:30] anywhere wherever you are whether you're
[1:09:32] in the building you're out there online
[1:09:34] listen you're listen these 10 lepers are
[1:09:37] just like many people in this world
[1:09:40] living around us right now that are that
[1:09:42] are in isolation they don't know what to
[1:09:44] do they don't know how to get out of
[1:09:46] their situations well Jesus is here amen
[1:09:50] Jesus is able these people are living
[1:09:53] isolated situations in broken
[1:09:56] relationships broken financially broken
[1:10:00] medically well Jesus is here and he's
[1:10:04] able to do something all they needed to
[1:10:07] do was get his attention amen they they
[1:10:11] deliberately took the time to go because
[1:10:14] they heard that Jesus was coming amen
[1:10:17] some people just want to stay at home
[1:10:19] they want to just continue to live their
[1:10:21] lives the way that they are and they
[1:10:22] don't want to darken the walls of a
[1:10:25] church building where they can come and
[1:10:28] receive healing from the Lord Jesus
[1:10:30] Christ
[1:10:32] himself Hallelujah glory to God let's
[1:10:36] read the next scripture though this goes
[1:10:38] on and when he saw them he said unto
[1:10:42] them go show yourselves under the
[1:10:45] priests I'll tell you there's a lot of
[1:10:48] people that you know if they come into
[1:10:50] the presence of God you know you can
[1:10:53] just go back and think when God came
[1:10:55] into your life this was this was
[1:10:58] Supernatural what happened to these 10
[1:11:01] lepers Jesus immediately healed them
[1:11:04] immediately told them go and tell your
[1:11:07] priests go and tell all those that you
[1:11:10] thought were we were you're uh you know
[1:11:13] we're going to do something for you you
[1:11:15] grew up thinking oh if I go to this
[1:11:18] church everything's going to be all
[1:11:19] right but Meanwhile your condition has
[1:11:21] never changed you're still in that
[1:11:24] defeated condition you're still dealing
[1:11:26] with that same sickness you're still in
[1:11:29] that rut of you know one week you're up
[1:11:33] the next week you're down one year
[1:11:35] you're financially up two years you're
[1:11:38] financially down one minute you've got a
[1:11:40] great relationship the next minute you
[1:11:42] got no
[1:11:43] relationship Oh Glory to God Amen they
[1:11:47] were in a rut but Jesus knew and you
[1:11:51] need to
[1:11:52] know and it came to pass that as they
[1:11:56] went they were
[1:11:58] cleansed as they went they knew
[1:12:01] something had taken place and one of
[1:12:04] them now here's where we're going to
[1:12:07] draw something one of them when he saw
[1:12:11] that he was healed Hallelujah turned
[1:12:14] back and with a loud voice glorify God
[1:12:19] hallelujah glory to God listen I don't
[1:12:23] know about you but I remember when
[1:12:25] delivered
[1:12:26] me I was a loud voice glory to God I I
[1:12:31] knew that something real that taken
[1:12:33] place this wasn't just go to the altar
[1:12:36] go to church go to the altar cry go back
[1:12:40] and live the same life over and over
[1:12:42] again no sir this leper knew that he had
[1:12:46] been made
[1:12:47] whole he was he was not a leper anymore
[1:12:51] look he turned back with and he
[1:12:53] glorified Jesus he glorified God and
[1:12:55] fell down on his face at his feet giving
[1:13:00] thanks and he was a
[1:13:03] Samaritan Samaritans back then were were
[1:13:05] like pagans they weren't even they they
[1:13:08] were neither Gentile they were neither
[1:13:10] they were half and half they they didn't
[1:13:12] know what they were and and just like
[1:13:15] Jesus when he had need to go to
[1:13:18] Samaria by the by the to see a woman at
[1:13:21] a well amen that's the kind of life that
[1:13:25] these individuals were living but they
[1:13:28] knew just like you knew you were not
[1:13:30] living right you knew that you needed
[1:13:33] change in your life you knew that you
[1:13:35] didn't want to continue the way that you
[1:13:37] were you knew that there was no real
[1:13:39] future you'd look to your right you'd
[1:13:42] see problems with your relationships you
[1:13:44] look to the left you see problems with
[1:13:46] your health you look here you got all
[1:13:48] kinds of problems financially it's you
[1:13:51] were surrounded amen praise God but just
[1:13:55] One Touch One Touch just one contact
[1:13:59] with the Living Word with the Living
[1:14:03] Word listen Jesus you you may not see
[1:14:06] Jesus in the in the man of Jesus in this
[1:14:09] hour but he is the word amen that's
[1:14:12] where you need to find him you need to
[1:14:15] find him according to the word when the
[1:14:17] word says repent and be baptized in the
[1:14:20] name of Jesus Christ that's the word
[1:14:22] speaking to you just like Jesus said to
[1:14:25] those lepers go and tell your priests
[1:14:29] amen it's the same thing amen praise God
[1:14:33] and so next slide
[1:14:36] here and Jesus answering said were there
[1:14:41] not 10
[1:14:43] cleansed oh listen there's a lot of
[1:14:46] altar calls there's a lot of people that
[1:14:49] that have come to Jesus and their lives
[1:14:52] have been
[1:14:53] changed but a lot of them are just
[1:14:57] fading
[1:14:58] away they're not coming back in the way
[1:15:02] like he did that one leper he had to
[1:15:05] intentionally come back and realize and
[1:15:10] know that he knew that this was the
[1:15:14] Messiah those other nine they really
[1:15:17] didn't
[1:15:18] fully understand because they never came
[1:15:22] back to him they didn't realize the word
[1:15:25] that they had received they didn't
[1:15:28] realize the word for their day that he
[1:15:30] was the Messiah that would come and and
[1:15:33] take away the sins of the world not just
[1:15:36] their sin but everybody's sin hallelujah
[1:15:41] praise God you know Jesus responded to
[1:15:45] their suffering
[1:15:48] immediately he knew just like he knows
[1:15:52] us he knows who we are he knows where we
[1:15:56] were he knows the conditions that we've
[1:15:58] been facing and he's very seriously
[1:16:03] interested in dealing with your
[1:16:05] situation and providing for you where
[1:16:08] you are right now amen glory to God
[1:16:11] gratitude listen this this one leper he
[1:16:16] he intentionally came back because he
[1:16:18] knew something had happened he mentioned
[1:16:22] that that that uh he he was in
[1:16:25] intentional in coming back because where
[1:16:28] were the other nine he says were there
[1:16:30] not 10 but where are the nine there they
[1:16:34] are not found that return to give glory
[1:16:36] to God save this stranger and he said
[1:16:40] unto him and now listen carefully here
[1:16:43] Jesus now when he came back to give and
[1:16:46] show gratitude and to express his
[1:16:52] faith Jesus turn around and says to him
[1:16:55] go thy way arise go thy way for thy
[1:16:59] faith hath made thee whole we're not
[1:17:03] just talking about healing of the body
[1:17:05] here we're talking you know this this uh
[1:17:09] you know when when we read this
[1:17:10] scripture it makes mention of this
[1:17:12] scripture here in ways where whole means
[1:17:18] completely
[1:17:21] restored to
[1:17:23] recognize Mind Body and soul who you
[1:17:26] really are that's the Revelation that we
[1:17:31] have received that we are thankful for
[1:17:34] not just a joining of church not just a
[1:17:37] member in a church showing that we we
[1:17:40] got baptized and now we just go and live
[1:17:43] any way that we want no it's a life
[1:17:46] where you now come back over and over
[1:17:50] and over again to show that something
[1:17:54] real has has taken place in you and it's
[1:17:56] not something
[1:17:58] temporary a lot of people said 30 years
[1:18:00] ago oh Danny's just off on another one
[1:18:03] of his you know positive mental attitude
[1:18:06] things or he'll be back in a couple of
[1:18:08] weeks you know he'll he'll he'll he'll
[1:18:10] come back to himself no I never came
[1:18:13] back to
[1:18:14] myself amen thank you Jesus because
[1:18:17] that's not who I was I came to realize
[1:18:19] who I really was I was not that Danny
[1:18:22] misilli I was a Son of God am that was
[1:18:25] in a spiritual Amnesia living a life of
[1:18:28] complete and total darkness in many
[1:18:31] areas of my life sure there was there
[1:18:33] was light in my life but when I look
[1:18:36] back all the times where there was light
[1:18:39] it was where God unconsciously I wasn't
[1:18:42] aware of it but God was interceding and
[1:18:44] intervening in my life I would I can
[1:18:48] only go back and give him the the the
[1:18:52] the glory for for all the good things
[1:18:54] that happen in my life amen because good
[1:18:58] things people think you know listen I'm
[1:19:01] grateful for my family for my mother for
[1:19:03] my father amen they were good things in
[1:19:06] my life that was God ordaining from the
[1:19:09] foundations of the world chose my
[1:19:12] parents to send an attribute through
[1:19:15] them a Son of God Amen somebody that was
[1:19:19] going to come into their rightful
[1:19:21] position I'm talking about you this
[1:19:23] morning amen you're one in a million you
[1:19:27] were not supposed to uh end up in a life
[1:19:30] of complete and utter destruction you
[1:19:33] were ordained to hear this
[1:19:36] word and if you're a son or a daughter
[1:19:38] of God you're going to hear this word
[1:19:40] and it's it's going to change you you
[1:19:43] will not stay the same when you hear
[1:19:46] this Revelation this word this reality
[1:19:49] of Jesus Christ healing you and
[1:19:52] restoring you and being your
[1:19:55] savior amen glory to God and
[1:19:59] so here now we realize that you know
[1:20:04] healing in your body is a wonderful
[1:20:06] thing but the whole that Jesus is
[1:20:09] talking about when he says thy faith has
[1:20:12] made thee whole is total healing
[1:20:15] complete total healing salvation of your
[1:20:19] soul amen salvation now salvation of
[1:20:22] your soul is is that you
[1:20:27] awaken to who you really are amen it's
[1:20:30] not that some thing happened at that
[1:20:34] moment you go to the Altar and you come
[1:20:37] to the altar you realize you're a sinner
[1:20:39] you've been making a lot of mistakes you
[1:20:41] go to the Altar and you and you go there
[1:20:43] and and and the the the preacher prays
[1:20:46] over you and you leave if you truly
[1:20:49] haven't come to that contact with God
[1:20:54] where where he he you you know that he's
[1:20:58] touched you you know that that that he's
[1:21:02] awakened you yes what happens is you
[1:21:05] don't go home and and turn around and
[1:21:07] say oh I gave my life to the Lord that's
[1:21:10] what a lot of people say no if there's
[1:21:13] anything that you do you surrender your
[1:21:16] life amen but what really happened was I
[1:21:20] awakened out of my
[1:21:22] Amnesia I came out of of the life that I
[1:21:26] was living think that that thinking that
[1:21:28] that was my life but who I really am an
[1:21:31] attribute of God whose name was written
[1:21:34] in the Lamb's Book of Life before this
[1:21:37] world before you came here you were
[1:21:41] always a Son of God you cannot listen if
[1:21:44] you're a son or a daughter of God you're
[1:21:46] Eternal you can't have a beginning you
[1:21:49] can't have an end you're a part of God
[1:21:51] being expressed in this day we were
[1:21:54] talking and fellowshipping about it last
[1:21:56] night and you know and the thought
[1:21:58] struck me that we are God
[1:22:02] expressing his
[1:22:05] story his story of being a
[1:22:09] father and so we're a part of his story
[1:22:13] because we are his children we are his
[1:22:16] sons and daughters and this whole Plan
[1:22:19] of Redemption that started you know
[1:22:23] before the foundations of the world in
[1:22:25] the mind of God it didn't just start in
[1:22:27] the 20th century here or when people
[1:22:30] started to hear about Jesus 2000 years
[1:22:32] ago it started way before this whole
[1:22:36] world began and you were in there back
[1:22:40] then but you had to come into a human
[1:22:43] body Express a life get caught into sin
[1:22:47] and wait for that day when you get to
[1:22:49] that state of desperation where you know
[1:22:53] that you need God now you
[1:22:55] there's nothing else that's going to
[1:22:56] that's going to fix this because you
[1:22:58] know that that attribute in you is
[1:23:00] ordained to contact
[1:23:03] God you you naturally in your carnal
[1:23:07] thinking and your own abilities you're
[1:23:09] looking at your conditions you're
[1:23:10] looking at the circumstances around your
[1:23:12] life and you're trying to figure out how
[1:23:14] in the world am I going to get out of
[1:23:16] this
[1:23:16] situation and that's where your focuses
[1:23:19] but the moment you made contact with the
[1:23:22] Supernatural and Revelation struck your
[1:23:24] heart to say you are not the son of
[1:23:27] Dominic and Ida
[1:23:31] mailli only you are here on this Earth

[1:27:20] Messiah they knew that they had come
[1:27:22] into contact with the reality of God not

[1:29:10] for mankind they they were praising God
[1:29:13] that they were chosen they didn't care

[1:31:08] over the last year that have been very
[1:31:11] very difficult situations but yet

[1:31:29] is more than able to do it they realize
[1:31:32] that God has a time for everything they
[1:31:35] realize God has a time in a season if I
[1:31:38] can just stay solid and if I can just
[1:31:40] continue to praise God give him the
[1:31:43] glory then Victory is going to come and

[1:32:37] prosper you he's going to heal you he's
[1:32:41] going to raise you out of that situation
[1:32:43] that same God is here today the same one
[1:32:47] that was with David is with you this
[1:32:50] morning because you are entering his
[1:32:53] Gates with Thanksgiving and you know
[1:32:55] what it does it brings his
[1:32:58] presence it brings his presence when we
[1:33:02] enter into the house of the Lord it
[1:33:04] brings his presence Hallelujah glory to
[1:33:08] God Amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah let
[1:33:12] me tell you God has given us this word
[1:33:15] of God so that we can understand what it
[1:33:18] means to be grateful and to live a life
[1:33:22] of Thanksgiving
[1:33:24] amen let's go to the next
[1:33:26] scripture listen to
[1:33:29] Thessalonians he says here
[1:33:31] Rejoice ever more pray without
[1:33:36] seizing in everything he didn't say
[1:33:39] something things everything that's why
[1:33:42] Paul and Silas they knew the the
[1:33:44] circumstances their bodies were broken
[1:33:47] they were bruised and bleeding but they
[1:33:49] knew the circumstance
[1:33:51] regardless they still knew knew that God
[1:33:54] was God they still knew that God was a
[1:33:57] deliverer they still knew that he was a
[1:34:00] Healer so no matter what they they saw
[1:34:02] in their bodies God could heal them it
[1:34:05] wasn't there's nothing too hard for the
[1:34:06] Lord whether he heals a cancer or
[1:34:09] whether he heals a natural cut on your
[1:34:11] arm you think there's any difference to
[1:34:14] God sometimes the the the the big you
[1:34:17] know sicknesses that come into our lives
[1:34:20] is because God's got a lot of faith in
[1:34:23] you
[1:34:24] God's got more faith in you than you
[1:34:26] know he'll Place certain things in your
[1:34:29] life because he knows you've got the
[1:34:31] faith in you that he wants to express
[1:34:34] for his
[1:34:36] glory he's not looking for you to get
[1:34:38] the glory we're not looking to get you
[1:34:40] know listen we're listen we're just a
[1:34:42] local church here good neighbor
[1:34:43] Ministries we are believers of the word
[1:34:46] of God for this hour amen we believe
[1:34:49] that God sent us a prophet in the 20th
[1:34:51] century to restore the world
[1:34:54] otherwise just like he said Luther
[1:34:56] Wesley Pentecost we would not have known
[1:34:59] the progression of the word unless he
[1:35:01] sent Reverend William
[1:35:03] brandham to restore us back to the
[1:35:06] original Faith that's why what you're
[1:35:09] hearing me what your I'm just reading
[1:35:11] what the word says amen he says in
[1:35:14] everything give thanks for this is what
[1:35:16] the will of God you mean it's the will
[1:35:19] of God for you to give thanks and be
[1:35:21] grateful for everything yes it is
[1:35:25] because it's Christ in you it's Christ
[1:35:28] it's you coming to a realization that
[1:35:31] that that he's in you expressing his
[1:35:34] word in this day Hallelujah and it's the
[1:35:38] will of God in Christ Jesus what
[1:35:40] concerning who you concerning each and
[1:35:45] every one of you he want you to know
[1:35:49] that Hallelujah glory to God Amen glor
[1:35:53] glory to God God's will for us in Christ
[1:35:57] is to be grateful in any and every
[1:36:01] circumstance gratitude humbles us you
[1:36:04] know you got to be humble to be
[1:36:07] grateful you know that some people are
[1:36:09] so
[1:36:11] hard in their character that they can't
[1:36:13] even go up to somebody and say thank
[1:36:18] you thank you for your gift giving your
[1:36:23] gift to the House of God to this body of
[1:36:25] Christ thank you for surrendering
[1:36:27] yourself in the cleaning committee thank
[1:36:31] you for be I'm saying it today and I've
[1:36:33] gone personally to people and told them
[1:36:35] that because I am truly grateful it
[1:36:38] takes more than just a a pastor and a
[1:36:41] few uh you know trustees and deacons to
[1:36:43] run a church it takes the whole body of
[1:36:47] Christ am glory to God listen you know I
[1:36:50] got a quote here I'm going to read it I
[1:36:53] didn't know if I was going to read it or
[1:36:54] not but I'm going to read it because
[1:36:56] it's a beautiful quote that you know my
[1:36:59] wife brought it to my attention she sent
[1:37:00] it to me this week and I thought wow
[1:37:02] that's beautiful and it says the way to
[1:37:05] have
[1:37:05] Fellowship it's it says here he says I'd
[1:37:09] rather have a church now listen just a
[1:37:11] moment he says here I would rather have
[1:37:13] a church that knows nothing about any
[1:37:15] spiritual
[1:37:17] gifts and just be so in love with each
[1:37:20] other and with Christ I'd rather have
[1:37:24] that than every spiritual gift operating
[1:37:28] in the
[1:37:29] church now that might sound hard in a
[1:37:32] Pentecostal group but I would rather
[1:37:35] have it where there is gifts they'll
[1:37:38] fail oh let me tell you we've seen gifts
[1:37:41] come through this church ministers with
[1:37:43] gifts that come through this church and
[1:37:45] today those same ministers are denying
[1:37:48] this
[1:37:49] [Music]
[1:37:51] message oh yeah because gifts will
[1:37:55] fail
[1:37:57] Hallelujah where there is gifts they'll
[1:38:00] bring confusion oh I'm the prophet of
[1:38:05] this I'm the eighth
[1:38:08] messenger I'm
[1:38:10] the seven Thunder teacher I'm the no
[1:38:14] seals are not open teacher there's all
[1:38:17] kinds of
[1:38:19] confusion those kinds of gifts they
[1:38:22] don't do any good to the body but let me
[1:38:24] tell you what does
[1:38:25] good they listen where there is gifts
[1:38:28] they can be questioned but where there
[1:38:31] is love it is perfect that's right and
[1:38:34] if you had perfect love you'd have
[1:38:37] perfect
[1:38:39] gifts that's right so work first with
[1:38:42] love and that brings
[1:38:45] fellowship and the fellowship brings the
[1:38:48] gifts because who's the operator of the
[1:38:51] gifts it's always been Jesus Jesus
[1:38:54] Christ and when that gift is not
[1:38:56] operated with the character of
[1:39:00] Christ it's not love it doesn't edify it
[1:39:05] doesn't do anything it it can be
[1:39:08] actually used in a negative way
[1:39:11] Hallelujah but let the love of God fill
[1:39:14] that individual who's full of gratitude
[1:39:17] who believes God's word who knows that
[1:39:20] God is just working God's working on
[1:39:22] their testimony I look at my children I
[1:39:25] say Lord I know I know they deny you
[1:39:27] today but they're working on their
[1:39:30] testimony because I denied you for 33
[1:39:33] years I denied the true Living God I was
[1:39:36] looking for you in so many places but
[1:39:40] then I realized that it wasn't for me to
[1:39:43] find that place it was for you to find
[1:39:47] me Hallelujah in in that point of time
[1:39:50] and season where you said okay now it's
[1:39:54] time they've had enough yes they've
[1:39:57] dealt with
[1:39:59] enough I've given them enough experience
[1:40:02] I've put certain things into their lives
[1:40:04] for a purpose so that they can have one
[1:40:06] heck of a testimony so that one day
[1:40:09] they're going to bring Glory not to
[1:40:11] themselves but to me the people will
[1:40:14] know that God is God that he can still
[1:40:18] deliver drug addicts he can still
[1:40:20] deliver cancer patients he can still
[1:40:23] deliver mental oppression oh God glory
[1:40:27] to God listen we're living in an age of
[1:40:29] mental health oppression like never
[1:40:31] before people are crying out they just
[1:40:34] need one word from
[1:40:36] Jesus they just need to hear I am your
[1:40:40] peace glory to God hallelujah let the
[1:40:43] Lord just give him one Revelation on I
[1:40:47] am your peace I am your healer I am your
[1:40:52] provider
[1:40:54] their life will never be the same amen
[1:40:56] glory to God hallelujah praise our God
[1:40:59] forever more let's let's go back to
[1:41:02] where we were here amen so here we are
[1:41:06] we're um what was our last
[1:41:10] slide Thessalonians amen praise
[1:41:14] God
[1:41:17] hallelujah Glory how many are enjoying
[1:41:19] the word this morning
[1:41:23] I'm enjoying his presence I'm enjoying
[1:41:26] his presence this morning I need I need
[1:41:30] this healing in my body amen I need this
[1:41:32] touch from the Lord I know that that I'm
[1:41:35] grateful I've never been this studying
[1:41:38] this this week just I said Lord It's so
[1:41:40] simple but then every day that I would
[1:41:42] go back to it it would just speak to my
[1:41:44] heart even more just how grateful what
[1:41:46] it is that God has given us to be
[1:41:48] grateful for amen and then you
[1:41:51] know I came across this scripture here
[1:41:54] as we wind down the musicians can start
[1:41:57] to come brother Bram speaking here in

[1:42:11] the bridegroom took away your
[1:42:13] shame amen and put it in the sea of
[1:42:18] forgetfulness God took your life took
[1:42:22] all your guilt and all your shame that's
[1:42:24] why listen we're going to end this today
[1:42:27] and we're going to be able to really
[1:42:28] give God thanks and praise for for what
[1:42:31] we've really received in this hour you
[1:42:34] you really need to understand what God
[1:42:36] has done for you amen and what he can do
[1:42:39] for you if you've not come to this place
[1:42:42] yet he said I've put I've put your sin
[1:42:46] and shame away put it into the sea of
[1:42:49] forgetfulness by the washing of the
[1:42:51] water of the word word and the blood of

[1:43:00] God you're being washed you're being
[1:43:02] purged you're being set free the washing
[1:43:06] of the water of the word means that the
[1:43:07] word is now delivering you from the
[1:43:10] situations that you're bound up that's
[1:43:12] what the Bible said your first husband
[1:43:14] that you were married to the
[1:43:17] world Amen the anointed bridegroom which
[1:43:20] foreordained you has washed you you by
[1:43:23] the washing of the Water by the
[1:43:26] church
[1:43:27] no the congregation says we're not
[1:43:30] getting washed by the church it's not
[1:43:33] because you come to this church that
[1:43:35] you're going to get washed it's not
[1:43:38] because you belong to a certain Church
[1:43:40] you need the washing of the Water by the
[1:43:44] word the word Christ amen congregation
[1:43:48] says amen that don't sound right it says
[1:43:51] no you might find that in the almano but
[1:43:54] not in God's Bible by the washing of the
[1:43:57] Water by the word in the word see you
[1:44:00] are standing completely Justified as
[1:44:04] though you never did it at the beginning
[1:44:07] this is the kind of forgiveness of sin
[1:44:10] that people need to experience I
[1:44:12] remember when this reality struck my
[1:44:15] soul because I was living in a life of
[1:44:18] guilt I was ashamed of my life and I
[1:44:22] know a lot of you have been ashamed of
[1:44:25] your life and the way that you've lived
[1:44:26] and the attitudes that you've had even
[1:44:29] while you're serving the lord you can
[1:44:31] look back and you can feel that shame
[1:44:33] but I got something to remind you of
[1:44:35] this
[1:44:36] morning you just need to be
[1:44:39] grateful you just need to change your
[1:44:42] attitude to one of
[1:44:44] gratitude instead of an attitude of oh
[1:44:47] me all things have been going wrong for
[1:44:50] me things didn't work out the way that I
[1:44:53] wanted them you need to get to a place
[1:44:56] where you just want his will his desire
[1:45:00] his plan because guess what you're not
[1:45:03] going to be here very long amen the
[1:45:06] things that you're dealing with right
[1:45:08] now that you think is oh poor me and
[1:45:11] poor this and oh I don't have this and I
[1:45:14] don't have that it's all going to fade
[1:45:16] away in one moment things are going to
[1:45:18] change and war is going to strike and
[1:45:21] it's going to be right in our own
[1:45:24] backyards because the world is going
[1:45:26] into Great Tribulation you need to get
[1:45:29] your priorities right you need to to get
[1:45:33] the right attitude of gratitude here and
[1:45:36] be focused on what God has done for you

[1:45:42] don't have to feel depressed anymore you
[1:45:45] don't have to allow anxiety to take a
[1:45:47] hold of you anymore you don't have to
[1:45:50] allow those things you can be free
