[41:44] the Lord
[41:46] I don't know
[41:48] but I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ
[41:50] comes to expect from him
[41:52] not anybody else because there's this
[41:55] thing can't be touched
[41:57] that is being
[42:00] developed matured In You by man's hands
[42:05] it's only the Holy Ghost
[42:07] God himself had to come in this last day
[42:11] and age
[42:12] and complete that work
[42:14] amen
[42:16] and that work that has started inside of
[42:18] you
[42:19] is only him that can complete it
[42:23] hey man it's good to be in the house of
[42:25] the Lord it's been a while since I've
[42:26] been up here
[42:27] so I'm just going to preach this morning
[42:29] you know you know what preaching is
[42:32] just here there everywhere
[42:36] see what the Lord will do kind of
[42:39] leaving myself open to see what the
[42:40] spirit of God will do amen and what
[42:43] he'll speak
[42:45] Hallelujah
[42:46] it's uh let's remember our pastor
[42:50] sister Pam brother Bill that are going
[42:53] to Israel
[42:54] let us remember brother coffee he's
[42:57] ministering this morning in Africa
[43:00] right we we welcome back brother Desmond
[43:02] I was walking by the office there and I
[43:04] heard the voice
[43:06] that's a voice a voice of joy amen so
[43:11] we're glad that the Lord brought him
[43:13] back safely and we know that God
[43:15] fulfilled his will
[43:18] in bringing him there and bringing him
[43:20] back to us
[43:21] let us stand this morning
[43:24] as we get into the word of God
[43:30] I have a title here this morning
[43:33] it's called The Bride walks as an
[43:35] individual in perfect faith
[43:39] but I got a subject this morning
[43:42] that is even burning on my heart
[43:45] is that God is a reality
[43:49] God is real amen
[43:54] God is a reality and God is real
[43:58] and I know one
[44:00] group of people that God is a reality
[44:04] and God is real to them
[44:06] and that's what we call the Bride of
[44:08] Jesus Christ a selected group
[44:13] so let's get into the word this morning
[44:15] and see what God will reveal to us amen
[44:18] amen you know we don't come expecting
[44:20] from man you know when the children of
[44:22] Israel gather together
[44:25] you know around the Tabernacle
[44:28] they knew
[44:30] that the pillar of fire was going to
[44:33] come down at certain times and visit
[44:35] them
[44:37] that's why they lived around the
[44:39] Tabernacle that's why they they they
[44:43] urged in hunger to go in to the presence
[44:45] of God because they knew the pillar of
[44:48] fire was going to be there I wonder if
[44:52] we had that kind of expectation this
[44:55] morning that when we come together in a
[44:59] what we call a building that the same
[45:01] Pillar of Fire
[45:04] would come
[45:06] I wonder what it would do to your hearts
[45:08] because we know when the pillar of fire
[45:10] comes what he does
[45:15] that only God can do
[45:21] we come with the same expectation this
[45:23] morning
[45:25] he will reveal himself to you he will
[45:27] make himself known to you
[45:29] but if you come just with your Dead
[45:31] traditions
[45:33] rituals
[45:36] that's another Sunday we're coming to
[45:39] church I'm a message believer so I gotta
[45:42] go to church I gotta
[45:45] that's dead
[45:47] that's dead
[45:49] and the Bride of Jesus Christ don't walk
[45:51] there
[45:52] she's come this morning
[45:56] to see to catch to experience the
[46:01] reality of God
[46:03] and he's here this morning he said where
[46:06] two or three are gathered together in my
[46:08] name
[46:09] I will be in the midst
[46:13] Matthew 16 13.
[46:18] let us read
[46:20] the reality
[46:22] of God
[46:24] when Jesus came
[46:26] into the coast
[46:31] of Sierra and Philippi
[46:34] he asked his disciples
[46:38] saying
[46:39] whom do men say that I the son of man am
[46:46] and they said unto him some say that
[46:47] thou are John the Baptist some Elias
[46:50] and others Jeremiah or one of the
[46:53] prophets
[46:55] he said unto them
[46:58] but who say ye that I am
[47:02] and Simon Peter
[47:04] answered and said Thou Art the Christ
[47:07] the son of the Living God
[47:11] something
[47:13] had to be made real to him for him to
[47:16] answer that way because everybody else
[47:19] was trying to guess who he was
[47:22] trying to understand who he was
[47:26] but God made himself real to Peter
[47:30] so he can say those words
[47:34] you know your words that you speak your
[47:37] testimony that you Proclaim shows the
[47:40] age that you're living in whether you're
[47:42] living in the seventh Church age or
[47:44] you're living in the Eternal age
[47:50] Jesus answered and said unto him
[47:52] blessed art Dell Simon barjorna
[47:55] for Flesh and Blood had not revealed it
[47:58] unto thee but my Father which is in
[48:01] heaven
[48:02] and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and
[48:06] of and Upon This Rock I will build my
[48:10] church and the gates of hell
[48:13] shall not prevail
[48:15] against it
[48:17] and I give unto thee the Keys of the
[48:21] Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever thou
[48:24] shall bind on Earth Thou shalt be back
[48:27] that shall be bound in heaven and
[48:29] whatsoever thou shall loose on Earth
[48:32] shall be loosed
[48:34] in heaven
[48:37] that's reality
[48:40] that to a True Believer is real
[48:44] in your life In your experience in your
[48:47] walk
[48:48] if this doesn't become real to you a
[48:53] revelation to you so that you can take
[48:56] the word of God you will not continue to
[48:59] walk in this battle and in this fight
[49:01] and overcome in this hour
[49:04] the only thing that's going to stand as
[49:07] we get closer to the end and wickedness
[49:10] gets more wicked and more Darkness gross
[49:13] darkness is that that word has to become
[49:16] real in your life
[49:19] amen real
[49:24] Matthew 13 11.
[49:30] he answered and said unto them because
[49:33] it is given to you
[49:35] to know the Mysteries
[49:37] of the Kingdom of Heaven
[49:39] but it's not given
[49:42] to them
[49:43] for whosoever had to him shall be given
[49:47] and he shall have more abundance
[49:51] but whosoever had not from him
[49:55] shall be taken away even that he had
[49:59] therefore speak I to them in parables
[50:03] because seeing
[50:06] see not and herein they hear not
[50:10] neither do they understand
[50:14] and in them is fulfilled the of the
[50:17] prophecy of Elias which said by hearing
[50:20] you shall hear and shall not understand
[50:23] and sin you shall see and not and shall
[50:27] not perceive
[50:28] for this people's hearts are wax gross
[50:32] and their ears are dull of hearing and
[50:35] their eyes they have clothes
[50:38] less at any time they should see with
[50:41] their eyes and hear with the ears and
[50:44] should understand with their hearts and
[50:47] should be converted and I should heal
[50:50] them
[50:51] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[50:54] and your ears for they hear for verily I
[50:57] say unto you meant that many prophets
[51:01] and righteous men have desire to see
[51:04] those things which ye see and have seen
[51:06] them not
[51:08] and to hear those things which you hear
[51:11] and hear
[51:13] them not
[51:15] wow
[51:18] let's pray father
[51:21] thank you for your word this morning
[51:25] we just commit ourselves into your hands
[51:27] both speaker and hearer Lord
[51:30] we commit brother coffee in Africa to
[51:32] you
[51:35] all the ministers that are preaching
[51:39] the word of God this morning to the
[51:41] Bride of Jesus Christ we commit to you
[51:43] what else can we do father but surrender
[51:46] into your hands O God
[51:48] May the spirit of God have its way this
[51:51] morning in our hearts
[51:53] and may your word go forth in power and
[51:55] demonstration
[51:57] it's not by might it's not by power but
[51:59] by your spirit father
[52:01] let your spirit speak
[52:04] to your people this morning and make
[52:06] yourself a reality and more real than
[52:09] you ever been in our lives because
[52:11] that's our hunger and that's our thirst
[52:13] father
[52:15] we hunger and thirst for the Living God
[52:19] oh Grant these things this morning that
[52:21] only you can do father
[52:23] wash Us in the precious blood father
[52:26] let every sin
[52:29] be place
[52:31] in the precious blood this morning and
[52:34] let every flesh be placed behind the
[52:37] cross Lord
[52:38] hide my flesh behind the cross this
[52:40] morning
[52:42] in Jesus name we pray you may be seated
[52:48] wow the things many prophets and
[52:50] righteous men desired to see
[52:54] and hear but here we are in the last
[52:57] days receiving
[53:02] those things
[53:04] those great things
[53:07] I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ
[53:10] knows when she reads the scripture she
[53:13] knows that
[53:15] she knows that she's receiving things
[53:19] that those prophets and righteous man
[53:23] desire to see
[53:25] and to look into
[53:28] she has an understanding this morning
[53:32] of what she's receiving what she's
[53:35] feeding on
[53:37] and what she is walking
[53:40] daily with him
[53:44] it's a reality to her
[53:48] this walk
[53:51] and John 3 1.
[53:55] it says there was a man
[53:57] of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler
[54:00] of the Jews
[54:02] the same came by night to Jesus saying
[54:05] Rabbi we know that thou art teacher come
[54:07] from God for no man can do these
[54:10] Miracles that thou doest except God be
[54:14] with him
[54:15] Jesus answers and said unto him verily
[54:18] verily I say unto thee except the man be
[54:21] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[54:25] God
[54:27] I believe that's the problem
[54:31] that the message has
[54:34] not leading people to a new birth
[54:40] leading him to a religion
[54:42] something that can Comfort them
[54:46] and not lead into a real change
[54:50] not exposing sin here was the prophet in
[54:53] the last days hitting the denomination
[54:55] saying you're not exposing sin in the
[54:59] people
[55:00] and the way that they live and act
[55:05] and here it is come all the way around
[55:08] again my brothers and sisters history
[55:10] always repeats itself it says things
[55:14] always repeat itself again because what
[55:17] was fulfilled back there got to be
[55:19] fulfilled today again
[55:26] where where where did the where did it
[55:29] change
[55:30] where did that entering into the kingdom
[55:33] of God change where did it we're seeing
[55:37] these things in the kingdom of God
[55:39] changed
[55:40] man changes things all the time man
[55:44] tries to interpret things all the time
[55:46] and put their own interpretation on it
[55:50] but this word has and needs no man's
[55:53] interpretation
[55:55] it is what it is
[55:58] and it says Jesus himself you must be
[56:01] born again
[56:05] you can't fall short of it
[56:09] you can't accept anything else
[56:12] you wonder why you're not growing you
[56:14] wonder why you're not you know you're
[56:16] you're getting dead and dull and and
[56:20] stale lukewarm lazy powerless
[56:27] check to see if you've been born
[56:30] somebody who hasn't been born is dead
[56:37] Nicodemus said unto him
[56:41] now these are people that
[56:43] the cardinal
[56:45] carnal believer that interprets the word
[56:47] this way
[56:49] how can a man be born when he's old
[56:52] can he enter the second time in his
[56:54] mother's womb and be born
[56:56] you know these are just words but if you
[56:58] spiritually discern what the the spirit
[57:01] is saying there
[57:04] the person the experience that is saying
[57:07] there
[57:08] the carnal impersonation the Cardinal
[57:10] interpretation there
[57:12] you'll see where they're at it's no
[57:15] different today
[57:17] people are saying the same thing about
[57:19] this message this word how can it be how
[57:23] can this Christ be how can I be born
[57:26] again how can this word and I become one
[57:30] and the same
[57:31] well you're going to interpret that way
[57:33] you're going to look at the scriptures
[57:35] you're going to look at the preaching
[57:37] and not the message and things that are
[57:38] coming forth if you're not born again
[57:42] because you're not seeing the kingdom
[57:44] but those who are seeing and are born
[57:46] again they know what Jesus meant when he
[57:51] said you will know in that day that I in
[57:54] the Father the father and me I and you
[57:57] and you and me and we are one in the
[57:59] same
[58:01] yes they know that they understand that
[58:05] they see that it's a reality to them
[58:07] they're experiencing it that because
[58:10] they can see and understand the kingdom
[58:13] of God within them
[58:16] the kingdom of God Has Come
[58:19] the kingdom of God is here
[58:23] it's amongst men it's in men
[58:26] and women this morning that are born
[58:28] again
[58:30] that's what this is all about that's
[58:33] what perfect faith is all about that's
[58:35] what the Rapture in faith is all about
[58:37] that's why we're here to fulfill in this
[58:40] hour is all about
[58:44] there's no other age
[58:46] there's nothing else coming
[58:51] but that
[58:53] that is the coming of the Lord
[59:00] that which is born of flesh is flesh
[59:03] that which is born of the spirit of
[59:05] spirit
[59:06] Marvel not
[59:08] that I say unto thee you must be born
[59:10] again
[59:11] the wind bloweth where it listed
[59:14] and thou hears the sound thereof
[59:17] but can us not tell when succumbeth or
[59:21] whether it is
[59:22] or goeth
[59:24] so is everyone that is born of the
[59:26] spirit
[59:28] of God
[59:35] I'm just preaching
[59:38] the letter
[59:42] you have it's between the spirit and you
[59:45] to understand
[59:47] hello
[59:48] there is nothing a man can do to make
[59:50] you understand
[59:52] or make you see this
[59:54] Kingdom that is here this morning
[1:00:00] we are living in such a day of confusion
[1:00:04] living in a day when men and women
[1:00:06] hardly know what to do
[1:00:08] everything seems to be in turmoil
[1:00:10] everything seems to be in so many
[1:00:13] different ways and so many different
[1:00:15] directions
[1:00:16] listen to my brothers and sisters I'm
[1:00:18] not going to preach to the world out
[1:00:21] there
[1:00:22] I'm not going to preach to the
[1:00:23] denominations out there I'm going to
[1:00:25] preach to the message here
[1:00:29] that's who I'm preaching to
[1:00:32] they are fulfilling their part they're
[1:00:34] we're way beyond that
[1:00:36] why because we're any better
[1:00:39] no is because God has purpose in his
[1:00:43] heart and position us into a position
[1:00:45] and a place and something to fulfill and
[1:00:48] we must fulfill that purpose of God
[1:00:51] every man and woman of God in the
[1:00:54] scriptures
[1:00:55] that has been given amen a position in
[1:01:00] in the word of God had to come to that
[1:01:03] place of surrender
[1:01:05] to fulfill that position
[1:01:07] amen
[1:01:11] Hallelujah
[1:01:14] recognize your day in this message
[1:01:17] they want a Great Awakening
[1:01:20] they're crying and believing that there
[1:01:22] will be an Awakening
[1:01:24] they're good people
[1:01:27] why is it
[1:01:29] what have they done
[1:01:32] they have not recognized
[1:01:34] The Awakening of the Bride
[1:01:39] by being a Christian they feel the pull
[1:01:43] of the hour
[1:01:45] but they haven't recognized what has
[1:01:48] been done
[1:01:54] what has been done
[1:01:57] you tell me that you have to be primed
[1:02:01] I'm just going to speak playing this
[1:02:02] morning
[1:02:03] you tell me you have to be primed you
[1:02:05] have to be pampered
[1:02:09] in this hour
[1:02:11] under the ministry that we're under and
[1:02:13] we have been under
[1:02:14] listen I've been under this ministry for
[1:02:17] 32 years
[1:02:19] listen I'm not sitting here like a
[1:02:22] little baby this morning I'm not sitting
[1:02:24] here like a little weakling this morning
[1:02:27] I've been growing and matured which I
[1:02:30] believe under a supernatural word of God
[1:02:34] in this hour
[1:02:37] as about time I stand to take my
[1:02:40] position and who I am
[1:02:43] and what God has called me to do and
[1:02:46] anointed me to do
[1:02:48] not looking for any individual anybody
[1:02:51] even my own Pastor to pamper me
[1:02:55] I gotta be mature grown up
[1:03:02] in this word
[1:03:05] because I recognize what has been done I
[1:03:08] recognize that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:03:11] yesterday today and forever
[1:03:13] that's not a scene on the wall there
[1:03:16] that's not the dead letter to me it's a
[1:03:18] reality to me
[1:03:21] it's real to me
[1:03:24] because he's real to me
[1:03:26] every day of my life he's real
[1:03:31] he's real
[1:03:33] every thought that runs through my mind
[1:03:36] goes through a filter
[1:03:39] an unconscious Holy Ghost filter
[1:03:43] well yeah there's flesh is that enmity
[1:03:46] this carnal Minds that enmity with God
[1:03:47] this flesh don't want to serve God this
[1:03:49] flesh is lazy
[1:03:51] but let me tell you there's something
[1:03:53] greater than this flesh inside here it's
[1:03:54] called an attribute of God it's called
[1:03:56] The Seed of God it's called the life of
[1:03:59] God and every time the enemy comes in as
[1:04:02] a flood and he will
[1:04:04] God raises a standard
[1:04:07] he makes the word that's inside of me
[1:04:10] more real amen so I could press on and I
[1:04:15] can move on
[1:04:17] I'm here this morning because of that
[1:04:21] every Minister that comes up here you
[1:04:23] don't know what we go through
[1:04:25] and you don't need to if you're not
[1:04:26] called to but the pressures you look oh
[1:04:30] brother Simon you know he preaches
[1:04:32] Wednesday or Sunday and all week he's
[1:04:34] doing that yeah
[1:04:35] yeah
[1:04:37] you know I was off for a long time with
[1:04:40] my back and that stuff being at home I
[1:04:42] wasn't working to do nothing but let me
[1:04:44] tell you those unseen uh pressures and
[1:04:47] those unseen battles don't go away
[1:04:50] they're there
[1:04:51] just to break into the presence of God
[1:04:54] Amen the priests go into that Tabernacle
[1:04:58] they had to go behind that where the
[1:05:01] pillar of fire was to stand in the
[1:05:04] presence of that Pillar of Fire
[1:05:07] you think that's easy
[1:05:10] you you don't even understand the
[1:05:13] challenges that that that is brought
[1:05:15] before a minister that he has to face
[1:05:17] just to get to a place to stand here
[1:05:23] what is it going to be on that day those
[1:05:25] who come
[1:05:27] those who come and criticize in your
[1:05:29] mind the preaching the person that's
[1:05:32] preaching the weaknesses
[1:05:35] what is going to be like on that day
[1:05:39] when the sacrifice was laid before you
[1:05:42] the sacrifice was given to you
[1:05:45] the sacrifice is here this morning
[1:05:48] for you to receive something
[1:05:51] so you can overcome you can be healed
[1:05:54] you can be delivered you can be set free
[1:05:58] that's here
[1:06:05] every born-again Christian has a road
[1:06:07] set before them
[1:06:09] you've got to follow that road
[1:06:12] God marks it out
[1:06:14] by faith
[1:06:16] it's marked by the blood what is the
[1:06:19] blood the blood is the life
[1:06:23] and the spirit always lives in the blood
[1:06:27] because through the blood comes life
[1:06:33] that's the blood cell
[1:06:38] in the seven Church age
[1:06:41] the message is then broadcast to all
[1:06:45] but through it
[1:06:47] it is broadcast to all who come within
[1:06:51] range of the message
[1:06:54] that message is received individually by
[1:06:57] only a certain qualified group
[1:07:02] in a certain way
[1:07:04] every individual of that group is one
[1:07:08] who has the ability to hear what the
[1:07:11] spirit is saying by the way of the
[1:07:15] messenger
[1:07:17] those who hear are not getting their own
[1:07:21] private Revelation nor is it a group
[1:07:24] getting their Collective Revelation but
[1:07:27] each person is hearing and receiving
[1:07:30] what the messenger has already received
[1:07:34] from God
[1:07:36] do we understand that
[1:07:39] amen he was the wave sheep
[1:07:42] he was our example in this hour
[1:07:47] he walked with God as Enoch walked with
[1:07:51] God he walked in a life separated to God
[1:07:55] a life of perfect faith
[1:07:58] an example for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:08:01] that those bloody Footprints we would
[1:08:04] walk into now I'm not talking about
[1:08:07] being the messenger
[1:08:10] the prophet but I'm talking about the
[1:08:13] life
[1:08:14] there was the ministry and then there
[1:08:17] was the life
[1:08:19] there was a separation between both of
[1:08:21] them and they were both one and the same
[1:08:24] but our calling
[1:08:26] our our gift that God has given us
[1:08:30] there comes a life a consecration a
[1:08:33] surrender that we need so that they can
[1:08:37] match up and they can go together
[1:08:40] and without it
[1:08:43] you're missing pieces of the puzzle
[1:08:47] you're not collectively putting the gas
[1:08:50] and the spark together
[1:08:53] to unite in your walk into your
[1:08:56] experience with God
[1:08:58] Enoch walk with God
[1:09:00] and by faith he pleased God and only
[1:09:04] Faith pleases God and when these two
[1:09:07] come together in your life that's when
[1:09:10] you please God you'll know
[1:09:13] you will know when you are pleasing God
[1:09:17] there is an atmosphere I can't explain
[1:09:19] it in words but there's an atmosphere
[1:09:21] there's a move of God around your life
[1:09:23] in your heart in your mind when you're
[1:09:26] obeying and surrender to the Lord
[1:09:28] there's a there's a there's a the spirit
[1:09:31] of the Lord gives Liberty and freedom
[1:09:33] there's a peace around you when
[1:09:35] everything is in turmoil when
[1:09:38] everything's falling apart around you
[1:09:39] you have a piece of that that mind can
[1:09:43] understand man can't understand
[1:09:45] that's when you're pleasing God
[1:09:48] and I'm not talking about you making
[1:09:49] mistakes
[1:09:50] you know we we jump back and forth to
[1:09:53] our flesh into this and we justify we
[1:09:56] you know we contradict both of them we
[1:09:58] make excuses for both of them
[1:10:03] that's not what I'm talking about
[1:10:05] I'm not talking about your flesh this
[1:10:07] morning
[1:10:08] I'm not talking about your Cardinal mind
[1:10:10] this morning
[1:10:11] I'm talking to the soul I'm talking to
[1:10:13] the attribute I'm talking to the spirit
[1:10:15] that's inside of you the word of God
[1:10:19] amen
[1:10:25] Hallelujah
[1:10:28] glory to God you can say Amen
[1:10:34] it's okay I'm going to preach anyways
[1:10:36] I'm I'm I'm growing up enough though if
[1:10:38] nobody says anything
[1:10:40] I'm just going to say what I say but if
[1:10:42] you want to say Amen go ahead
[1:10:44] and I'm not like my brother Brad says so
[1:10:47] many times I get that runs through my
[1:10:48] mind I'm not angry
[1:10:50] right just the way I I am this is the
[1:10:52] way I preach it when God become this is
[1:10:55] the way God makes himself real to me
[1:10:57] [Music]
[1:10:58] I I just as much as you want the
[1:11:02] realities of God
[1:11:04] and God to be more real to me
[1:11:07] that was my prayer well I'm up here God
[1:11:10] be real to me more and more
[1:11:17] Hallelujah
[1:11:19] amen
[1:11:22] the seals are open the Mysteries are
[1:11:25] revealing is self to the bride
[1:11:28] perfect faith is here
[1:11:31] perfect faith is not coming
[1:11:35] perfect faith is here
[1:11:38] that struck me because you know as a
[1:11:41] preacher you got to learn and grow in
[1:11:42] the word
[1:11:43] and I always you know you got to get
[1:11:46] perfect Faith you got to grow in and
[1:11:48] mature into perfect faith
[1:11:50] but see perfect faith is already here
[1:11:53] the faith that was delivered
[1:11:56] to us in this hour is perfect
[1:12:00] it's perfect faith
[1:12:03] the thing is you've got to come to
[1:12:05] realize and grow into that perfect faith
[1:12:09] but then brother Brown said that perfect
[1:12:11] Faith Rapture and faith lies in the
[1:12:14] tapes well what do you what do you mean
[1:12:16] by that
[1:12:17] not just you didn't mean take Ministry
[1:12:20] only
[1:12:21] he meant the revelation
[1:12:24] the shields that have been broken by the
[1:12:27] lamb who took the book amen and opened
[1:12:30] up the seals amen is here it's open it's
[1:12:35] done it's released
[1:12:39] it's available to us
[1:12:42] is available to you this morning
[1:12:46] why come
[1:12:48] and leave empty
[1:12:51] why come is there not a bomb in Gilead
[1:12:54] is there not a God here
[1:12:59] is not the word of God real not the word
[1:13:02] of God in reality
[1:13:04] doesn't he not fulfill his promises
[1:13:07] still
[1:13:09] can his word fail can he fail
[1:13:14] oh my
[1:13:18] God this is the bride's reality in her
[1:13:20] individual walk with God the bride walks
[1:13:23] in a world of perfect understanding of
[1:13:26] who he is she understands the realities
[1:13:29] of God when Jesus said in that day you
[1:13:32] will know that I'm in the Father the
[1:13:33] father me I in you she understands how
[1:13:36] Jesus and the father are one because she
[1:13:41] in the word are one
[1:13:44] you know
[1:13:46] you you see how important that the
[1:13:49] understanding of God
[1:13:52] and Jesus Christ are one in the same you
[1:13:55] know there's still people in this
[1:13:56] message that don't understand that and
[1:13:59] if you don't see that by faith
[1:14:02] you can't see how God amorphied himself
[1:14:06] down
[1:14:09] Elohim coming down through Melchizedek
[1:14:12] coming into flesh
[1:14:14] and being God manifested in flesh
[1:14:18] you cannot see the same process that's
[1:14:22] taken place in your flesh
[1:14:24] it's very important
[1:14:28] and we take all these things I don't
[1:14:30] need to understand this I don't need to
[1:14:31] understand that
[1:14:33] you need to understand because
[1:14:36] they are blueprints
[1:14:38] they are blueprints to what God will be
[1:14:42] doing and is doing in you
[1:14:44] so that when you come to understand
[1:14:46] remember brother Brown said these things
[1:14:48] I'm going to quote a lot of stuff say a
[1:14:51] lot of stuff when he said these things
[1:14:52] he said when a bride recognizes who she
[1:14:54] is she's going to be invincible
[1:14:58] oh
[1:14:59] there's going to be a power an anointing
[1:15:03] an understanding around her life
[1:15:05] she's going to know what to do with the
[1:15:07] word that God placed inside of her life
[1:15:12] that's what's going to manifest that is
[1:15:15] that's what's manifested now but there's
[1:15:16] a greater move
[1:15:18] there's a greater thing that is coming
[1:15:21] amongst the Bride of Jesus Christ God
[1:15:24] has secretly been molding her shaping
[1:15:27] her you think nothing's been going on oh
[1:15:30] you come to church this brother comes to
[1:15:33] church he comes to church and oh we all
[1:15:35] leave the same we all go to dinner we
[1:15:38] all go and have this fellowship and that
[1:15:40] stuff but God has been working secretly
[1:15:43] in the bride in certain individuals he's
[1:15:46] been molding her shaping her and
[1:15:49] building her and developing something in
[1:15:51] her that he is getting ready to manifest
[1:15:55] in this hour thank you Jesus that's why
[1:15:59] desperation is amongst the Bride of
[1:16:02] Jesus Christ all the time
[1:16:05] oh God where are you what are you doing
[1:16:08] speak to my heart show me yourself
[1:16:12] because there's an hour there's a time
[1:16:14] that's coming right now upon the Earth
[1:16:17] where she's going to be moving into a
[1:16:18] manifestation and if you're not there
[1:16:21] you're not there you're only going to be
[1:16:23] watching it and there's going to be a a
[1:16:25] a thing that's going to come and
[1:16:27] understand it it's going to come to you
[1:16:28] because you're left behind
[1:16:31] well I know this is not positive
[1:16:33] preaching uplifting preaching but it's
[1:16:36] the truth it's up to you as individuals
[1:16:39] it's up to you and your consciousness
[1:16:42] to stop
[1:16:44] if something is real in your heart
[1:16:46] and talking to you stop playing Church
[1:16:50] stop playing religion and get real with
[1:16:54] God when you get real with him he'll get
[1:16:56] real with you
[1:17:02] secret catching away is happening now
[1:17:09] you think that this is it you think that
[1:17:12] this is all of it no my brothers and
[1:17:14] sisters
[1:17:15] this is just winding up
[1:17:18] this is building a momentum and growing
[1:17:22] are you in that momentum are you growing
[1:17:25] in that momentum of Faith a a perfect
[1:17:28] faith in this hour
[1:17:30] are you seeing yourself are you
[1:17:32] understanding the kingdom of God that's
[1:17:35] inside of you
[1:17:37] you've been given eyes to see ears to
[1:17:39] hear it's not for me to judge it's not
[1:17:41] for no man to judge here
[1:17:44] I'm not here to judge
[1:17:47] I'm here to speak the truth and this is
[1:17:50] the truth in this hour
[1:17:52] this is what's happening
[1:17:55] Hallelujah
[1:17:58] perfect faith
[1:18:00] means
[1:18:02] for the laity every individual walks in
[1:18:04] a world with God
[1:18:06] alone
[1:18:09] you stand alone you walk alone you
[1:18:13] battle alone
[1:18:15] you overcome alone
[1:18:18] with God
[1:18:21] I thank you for my your prayers
[1:18:23] because your faith
[1:18:25] the Bible says by your faith and your
[1:18:27] prayers it's helped delivered me
[1:18:29] it's helped heal me
[1:18:31] but in reality I gotta face everything I
[1:18:34] have to face in my life alone with God
[1:18:39] as long as God is here
[1:18:41] and with me
[1:18:43] I can do all things through Christ
[1:18:47] who strengthens me I can overcome every
[1:18:52] challenge that is faced before me
[1:18:56] challenge
[1:18:59] I can walk
[1:19:03] unconsciously of fear
[1:19:11] who's speaking
[1:19:12] the attribute is speaking
[1:19:14] God is speaking
[1:19:16] you can walk unconsciously of fear
[1:19:19] when you're walking with God
[1:19:22] Enoch walked with God
[1:19:25] he walks so close to God he understood
[1:19:29] so much of God the word understood so
[1:19:32] much of himself God says you know what
[1:19:34] you can't stay here anymore there's no
[1:19:36] challenges for you here anymore
[1:19:39] there's nothing for you to overcome down
[1:19:40] here anymore
[1:19:41] while the bride's coming to that same
[1:19:43] place
[1:19:46] you know what you are fulfilled
[1:19:49] you have completed
[1:19:51] you have finished your course you have
[1:19:52] run your race
[1:19:56] that's why people are going home
[1:19:58] don't get puzzled why people are going
[1:20:00] home and the way that they go home the
[1:20:02] way that they exit they're going home
[1:20:04] because it's home time
[1:20:06] people are finishing their course and
[1:20:08] they're and they're and their race and
[1:20:09] they're going home
[1:20:11] you know what
[1:20:13] they're very happy
[1:20:14] that they're home
[1:20:16] oh happy ain't the word that they finish
[1:20:21] in their home
[1:20:23] and here we are
[1:20:25] here we are
[1:20:28] still

[1:20:33] morning

[1:20:40] it tells you that there's a possibility
[1:20:42] that you might not taste death

[1:20:51] the range they still have a desire I
[1:20:53] still have a hunger and thirst I still
[1:20:56] feel a pull of my heart
[1:20:57] I still feel the word inside of me is
[1:21:01] still gonna still gonna develop and grow
[1:21:03] a little bit more and manifest
[1:21:05] the challenges that are coming upon the
[1:21:08] Earth and that are here upon the Earth
[1:21:09] this Faith that's placed inside of us is
[1:21:12] going to challenge that it's going to
[1:21:15] overcome that it's going to meet the
[1:21:17] devil face to face in this hour
[1:21:21] that's when playing church and playing
[1:21:23] message and all that's over it's done
[1:21:26] then
[1:21:28] whether you have it other you know or
[1:21:32] you don't know in that hour
[1:21:35] if you're still confused you're still
[1:21:37] guessing

[1:21:40] I don't know when that door is going to
[1:21:42] close
[1:21:43] but that door is closing fast
[1:21:48] oh brother Tim you don't know fast
[1:21:52] something in the spirit tells the Bride
[1:21:54] of Jesus Christ
[1:21:56] right
[1:21:57] doesn't these cells show you things to
[1:21:59] come
[1:22:00] you might not know the hour or the day
[1:22:04] or the time but the year
[1:22:07] go look in the scriptures the year
[1:22:09] you'll know
[1:22:11] you know
[1:22:13] wow
[1:22:15] you see what's prophesied out there we
[1:22:19] know we have a we know what we believe
[1:22:21] but amsterdamus prophesied for 2023 what
[1:22:26] they're saying about 2023
[1:22:29] wow
[1:22:31] all right

[1:22:35] what do you say what do you say
[1:22:42] s basically you want to put well I want
[1:22:44] me to put in my own words
[1:22:46] Rapture time
[1:22:48] Glory
[1:22:51] going home time
[1:22:54] you're baptized into the kingdom there's
[1:22:57] nobody in there but you and God
[1:22:59] he gives the orders you pack them out
[1:23:01] whatever he says there's not a Shadow of
[1:23:03] Doubt nowhere you walk right on if the
[1:23:07] Lord says this
[1:23:08] there's nobody in the world that can
[1:23:10] talk you out of it you just go right on
[1:23:12] the same you're coming into perfect
[1:23:15] Faith perfect Perfection and that cannot
[1:23:18] fail that never fails
[1:23:21] you see he was a Mystic to them with his
[1:23:25] perfect faith and so it is now to those
[1:23:29] who have those who have perfect faith
[1:23:35] are Mystics to others
[1:23:38] remember what I said in the beginning
[1:23:40] keep your spiritual Minds on I'm not
[1:23:42] talking to them out there talking to the
[1:23:44] message
[1:23:47] I'm talking in the message
[1:23:50] this is what's going to happen here
[1:23:53] this is the word of God today
[1:23:56] for this day for our day
[1:24:00] Hallelujah
[1:24:04] my brothers and sisters
[1:24:07] we see this battle that has taken place
[1:24:11] we understand
[1:24:16] that in order to overcome our flesh
[1:24:19] we need the faith
[1:24:20] of Who We Are
[1:24:23] we need to understand these things
[1:24:26] that we're going through
[1:24:29] because each and every one of us are
[1:24:31] individuals and our challenges our
[1:24:33] battles are different they're unique
[1:24:35] they're designed differently
[1:24:38] you can't look at the way I battle
[1:24:43] or this brother or this sister battles
[1:24:45] because your challenges are unique your
[1:24:49] battles are unique
[1:24:51] that's why you and only you yourself has
[1:24:55] got to go in in
[1:24:57] behind the veil the Shekinah Glory with
[1:25:01] God
[1:25:02] and when you go behind there and the
[1:25:06] curtain shuts behind you then there is
[1:25:09] the voice of God the still Small Voice
[1:25:11] that speaks to you directly and gives
[1:25:15] you a word
[1:25:17] gives you a Direction
[1:25:19] gives you an inspiration
[1:25:22] gives you a faith that you need to meet
[1:25:26] that challenge
[1:25:28] because we got to face one challenge
[1:25:30] after another challenge after it is not
[1:25:33] going to stop my brothers and sisters
[1:25:34] this battle is not going to stop this
[1:25:37] testing is not going to stop it's not
[1:25:40] going to stop until we finally reached
[1:25:43] our last one
[1:25:44] [Applause]
[1:25:47] and when that last one is completed in
[1:25:49] the bride only God knows that's gonna
[1:25:53] unite or Unite
[1:25:57] trigger off
[1:25:59] amen trigger off like the cross
[1:26:02] triggered off so many prophecies being
[1:26:05] fulfilled that's going to trigger off
[1:26:07] God knows when that's going to trigger
[1:26:09] off we say when the last one comes in
[1:26:11] comes into what
[1:26:15] comes into what
[1:26:18] it's true
[1:26:20] but what is she coming into
[1:26:26] Romans 7.
[1:26:32] but I see another law in my members
[1:26:34] warned against the law of my mind and
[1:26:37] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[1:26:39] sin
[1:26:40] which is in my member
[1:26:43] oh Wretched Man that I am who shall
[1:26:45] deliver me from this body of this death
[1:26:49] I thank God through Jesus Christ Our
[1:26:51] Lord
[1:26:52] so when with this mind I myself serve
[1:26:55] the law of God but with this flesh the
[1:26:58] law of sin
[1:27:02] we need to surrender the human part
[1:27:06] now listen to this this blessed my soul
[1:27:09] when I came across this
[1:27:14] we need to surrender the human part
[1:27:17] to the god part
[1:27:20] we've been talking about the two parts
[1:27:22] mostly the god part that's the one I
[1:27:24] like to talk about the most
[1:27:27] so God's word can interpret the portion
[1:27:30] of the word of faith in us
[1:27:33] because entering behind the inner veil
[1:27:36] by the third pull
[1:27:38] which is the revealing of the word
[1:27:41] in to the individual cannot be carnally
[1:27:45] impersonated
[1:27:47] my egg
[1:27:49] but there's so much of that going on
[1:27:51] today
[1:27:52] so much self-righteousness so much
[1:27:54] self-works and all these things
[1:27:57] watch are you going to see here
[1:27:59] as we we keep going down
[1:28:03] people are trying to live and act or
[1:28:06] dress and talk like the prophet or
[1:28:09] someone who is living in the third pole
[1:28:12] manifestation of perfect faith
[1:28:14] it's an individual affair
[1:28:17] the husband cannot give it to the wife
[1:28:20] wives
[1:28:22] the life cannot give it to the husband
[1:28:28] the parents cannot give it to the
[1:28:31] children
[1:28:32] which a lot of people believe that
[1:28:35] it's an individual Affair the word of
[1:28:38] God says you you individually must be
[1:28:43] born again
[1:28:45] it
[1:28:48] period
[1:28:50] thank you somebody's with me here
[1:28:55] Hallelujah
[1:28:58] it must be revealed to him to you
[1:29:01] personally because the secrets are
[1:29:03] Unwritten it's the unwritten word like
[1:29:08] Paul said
[1:29:10] I was caught up into the heavens I seen
[1:29:13] and heard things I cannot utter with
[1:29:17] human voice or understanding
[1:29:21] that cannot be uttered
[1:29:25] this morning every morning every time
[1:29:28] you come it cannot be uttered
[1:29:31] by human voice or understanding
[1:29:35] when you leave here
[1:29:37] you're going to leave here with
[1:29:40] something that he gave you not what I
[1:29:42] gave you
[1:29:43] because if you leave here only what I
[1:29:47] gave you
[1:29:48] you're in trouble
[1:29:50] because you're going to forget it and
[1:29:52] you're going to go back to your doll
[1:29:53] lazy lukewarm
[1:29:58] life
[1:30:01] that's what's going to happen
[1:30:03] no victory
[1:30:10] that what it was it was revealed to the
[1:30:12] bride when she enters into the king's
[1:30:15] chamber where the Shekinah Glory is and
[1:30:17] the world is shut out
[1:30:19] and your heart and mind and the only
[1:30:22] voice that the bride hears is the voice
[1:30:24] of her husband whisper and secrets of
[1:30:26] love to her all day long
[1:30:30] what does Jesus say
[1:30:33] I'll take one
[1:30:36] and I'll leave him what do you say
[1:30:39] what did he say uh in the bed
[1:30:42] in the marriage bed is that what it
[1:30:44] means I don't know I'll take one I'll
[1:30:46] leave one
[1:30:47] in the field where you work
[1:30:50] in the church
[1:30:53] I'll take one I'll leave one
[1:30:55] listen my brothers and sisters
[1:31:00] don't look to the left
[1:31:02] don't look to the right
[1:31:04] don't look at personalities
[1:31:06] don't look at family don't look at
[1:31:07] relationships
[1:31:09] stop it
[1:31:12] look to Jesus
[1:31:14] get focused on him
[1:31:17] not caught up in personalities and
[1:31:19] caught up in in this person's faith and
[1:31:21] that person's faith
[1:31:22] and what they're doing in God and what
[1:31:25] they're fulfilling in God
[1:31:28] know who you are know where you stand
[1:31:32] I don't care how old you are
[1:31:34] I don't care how old you are Mary when
[1:31:37] she received the message the Revelation
[1:31:39] from the angel was a teenager
[1:31:42] I don't care how old you are
[1:31:44] how young you are
[1:31:47] this is real this is reality
[1:31:52] this is what the word and what God is
[1:31:54] doing in this hour
[1:31:56] he is separating the attribute
[1:31:59] he is separating the attribute from All
[1:32:01] Flesh her flesh All Flesh
[1:32:05] I don't want your flesh
[1:32:08] you know what I mean by that
[1:32:10] some of you do
[1:32:12] I don't want your flesh I don't want I
[1:32:14] don't want you know
[1:32:16] you like me I'm happy
[1:32:18] I'm happy you like me I'm happy that you
[1:32:21] know but you don't I'm happy
[1:32:24] I'm still happy
[1:32:26] because I'm separated from your flight
[1:32:27] you don't like the way and what I like
[1:32:30] to eat
[1:32:31] I'm happy
[1:32:33] if you do
[1:32:34] okay I'm happy
[1:32:36] I don't care it's all flesh
[1:32:40] your culture
[1:32:42] you're native your land your way you
[1:32:45] speak
[1:32:46] the way you're brought up your
[1:32:48] traditions
[1:32:50] It's All Flesh
[1:32:52] the attribute are separating from All
[1:32:55] Flesh
[1:32:57] if it's separating inside of me from my
[1:33:00] own flesh because I know the greatest I
[1:33:02] know the greatest enemies myself not you
[1:33:04] you're not my greatest enemy
[1:33:07] if you think that your brother and
[1:33:09] sister are still your problem
[1:33:14] yeah
[1:33:15] your Revelation got to tune in you know
[1:33:18] you know when they used to tune in the
[1:33:20] TV and tune in the channel tune in the
[1:33:22] picture
[1:33:23] you gotta tune in
[1:33:25] you're not your greatest enemy it's
[1:33:28] yourself
[1:33:28] [Music]
[1:33:30] I battle every day I wrestle every day I
[1:33:33] get up every day and every time I step
[1:33:36] under that bed
[1:33:37] I'm battling with myself
[1:33:40] you're not controlling me today
[1:33:42] you're not having dominion over me today
[1:33:45] the Lord God
[1:33:47] is
[1:33:48] and whether I I finish the day with you
[1:33:51] know losing a few battles and you know
[1:33:53] the flesh took a little Vantage on me or
[1:33:55] I got a little uh upset at my job or
[1:33:58] whatever that's okay
[1:34:00] that's okay that doesn't stumble me that
[1:34:03] doesn't make me all you know panicky and
[1:34:06] and flared up and stuff like that worry
[1:34:09] me
[1:34:12] no because I know that this thing shall
[1:34:16] not inherit the kingdom of God right
[1:34:18] this thing is definite shall pass away
[1:34:21] but the attribute inside of me
[1:34:25] is eternal
[1:34:27] brother Brown's speaking here the
[1:34:29] unfailing realities of the Living God
[1:34:32] now the holy spirit will not misbehave
[1:34:34] itself in one person and behave itself
[1:34:36] in another
[1:34:37] it makes each person come into its
[1:34:40] character
[1:34:41] remember what brother Brown said
[1:34:43] the only thing we take with us
[1:34:47] is character
[1:34:49] and that's what the Holy Spirit
[1:34:51] deals with
[1:34:53] is your character it's not your flesh
[1:34:58] that he's so much worried about
[1:35:01] it's your character
[1:35:04] the spirit that leads you
[1:35:06] it brings and makes you subject to its
[1:35:09] nature
[1:35:11] now listen you don't bring it subject to
[1:35:14] your nature how many times have we heard
[1:35:17] that and I believe that too
[1:35:19] we got to bring this flesh under
[1:35:21] subjection to the word
[1:35:24] we've all heard that
[1:35:26] bring it on we hear preaching bring it
[1:35:29] under subjection to the word preaching
[1:35:31] is delivered in certain ways to make you
[1:35:33] live by the law to do this to do that
[1:35:38] you've got to have standards you got to
[1:35:40] do this you got to do that
[1:35:42] take in the very element of Jesus Christ
[1:35:45] the holy ghost out of your life
[1:35:49] preachers not leading people to Christ
[1:35:53] leading them to their personalities
[1:35:56] leading to the law
[1:36:01] do you understand
[1:36:03] do you understand
[1:36:07] you don't bring a subject to your nature
[1:36:09] it makes you subject to its nature
[1:36:13] there's a difference there
[1:36:15] that the bride is understanding
[1:36:17] in this hour and she's being set free
[1:36:21] well I know I've been set free I can
[1:36:23] experience that
[1:36:24] this morning the difference between that
[1:36:28] I used to be under so much guilt so much
[1:36:30] condemnation some of you guys are still
[1:36:33] are under that that that level
[1:36:36] of maturity because you're trying to
[1:36:39] bring your nature subject to his nature
[1:36:41] but when he says I will bring your
[1:36:43] nature subject to my nature
[1:36:47] there's a difference there
[1:36:49] the difference is there is no
[1:36:51] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:36:53] Jesus Paul said it's not I that live and
[1:36:57] bring this nature subject to his nature
[1:36:59] but it's Christ that lives inside of me
[1:37:01] that does it
[1:37:04] amen so I'll stand back and watch and
[1:37:07] give him the the preeminence in my life
[1:37:10] to do that
[1:37:14] you understand
[1:37:19] okay
[1:37:22] Hallelujah
[1:37:25] watch
[1:37:26] oh how you love to give up the things of
[1:37:29] the world when the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:37:32] how it cleanses you how it washes you
[1:37:35] how it puts a desire in you to follow
[1:37:37] him
[1:37:38] searching hungering and pulling for the
[1:37:41] realities of God because God is a
[1:37:45] reality to you
[1:37:48] you do that
[1:37:49] no he does that
[1:37:53] he has done it in my life he's done it
[1:37:55] in some of your lives
[1:37:57] why are you here this morning while
[1:37:59] you're walking with God
[1:38:00] while you're hunger and thirsting for
[1:38:02] God
[1:38:03] there could be Never Enough of God
[1:38:06] how can people have enough how can
[1:38:07] people oh I read all the messages I
[1:38:11] listened to all the tapes I've heard
[1:38:13] every preacher in this message so what
[1:38:16] so what
[1:38:18] good for you
[1:38:22] oh
[1:38:26] good for you
[1:38:30] I'm happy for you
[1:38:32] that's not what it's all about
[1:38:37] the attribute separates from the flesh
[1:38:41] brother Simon preaching about that
[1:38:44] the seed of God separating not only from
[1:38:48] its own flesh but all flesh we are in a
[1:38:50] day of total Deliverance
[1:38:52] total separation and the faith that was
[1:38:55] once delivered to the Saints
[1:38:58] is now perfect in the bride
[1:39:02] look at Abraham
[1:39:04] I'm going to run through this quickly
[1:39:05] now
[1:39:06] look at Abraham
[1:39:09] a person and we are Abraham's seed
[1:39:12] separated person from the world
[1:39:15] when God called Abraham at 75 years old
[1:39:19] separate yourself from your Kindred from
[1:39:22] your from all unbelief come out into a
[1:39:26] world that you'll that that you never
[1:39:29] walked in before and amongst people that
[1:39:32] you have never known before I believe
[1:39:34] that's happened to me
[1:39:37] I believe that's happened to me come out
[1:39:39] and separate yourself from everybody
[1:39:42] that would be contrary to what you
[1:39:45] believe and that's the problem
[1:39:50] that's the problem with some people
[1:39:53] that God is a separator
[1:39:55] not man
[1:39:57] not you
[1:40:00] but I I still have a relationship with
[1:40:03] my my family my kindred
[1:40:06] friends out there
[1:40:08] but you know what
[1:40:10] the more reality and what's more real to
[1:40:13] me that I'm separated
[1:40:16] I'm like I'm standing in a room alone
[1:40:19] with a million people but I'm still
[1:40:21] alone
[1:40:23] with God
[1:40:26] I don't have to carnally impersonate or
[1:40:30] kindly interpret how to separate from
[1:40:33] anybody but the attribute separates me
[1:40:36] the art the spirit of God moves
[1:40:39] Sons and Daughters of God are led by the
[1:40:42] spirit of God so the spirit of God moves
[1:40:45] you in a Direction
[1:40:47] not you not your own interpretation your
[1:40:50] own mind your own thinking but the
[1:40:53] spirit moves you and when you're led by
[1:40:56] the spirit you can look back at your
[1:40:58] life and you can see a separation taking
[1:41:01] place and happening
[1:41:04] not by what you have done not by why
[1:41:07] decisions that you have made or things
[1:41:09] that you have said but the spirit of God
[1:41:12] has done it
[1:41:16] unconsciously has done it
[1:41:19] because you are walking listen
[1:41:22] you are walking with God
[1:41:25] the realities of God you're walking with
[1:41:27] this word my brothers and sisters you're
[1:41:29] you know what you're going to walk
[1:41:31] brother I'm seeing the bride walking
[1:41:32] like this that is what's happening now
[1:41:36] you're walking up
[1:41:40] how can you still
[1:41:42] think about it
[1:41:44] be walking with flesh
[1:41:49] when you're walking up
[1:41:52] my
[1:41:53] I you know what
[1:41:55] kind of like the human part of me have
[1:41:57] to apologize to you know what I'm saying
[1:42:00] here this morning because
[1:42:02] you don't understand it's could be
[1:42:04] really really a battle for you
[1:42:08] really a battle for you
[1:42:10] separating
[1:42:13] Hallelujah Abraham let's move on
[1:42:16] our battles are individually fought and
[1:42:19] are different in ways that we fight them
[1:42:21] perfect faith has to come you are
[1:42:24] designed to meet every challenge that
[1:42:26] you face the Lord will raise a standard
[1:42:28] against the unbelief that is challenging
[1:42:30] you in your position
[1:42:33] by making your walk and your part more
[1:42:35] real the reality of who you are and who
[1:42:39] he is so that you can overcome and keep
[1:42:42] fighting and walking in Victory
[1:42:45] that's what he'll do
[1:42:50] Satan is hiding in the light
[1:42:55] the bride is walking in the light
[1:42:59] but Satan is there hiding
[1:43:02] trying to to deceive her
[1:43:05] it would be so close
[1:43:09] you see
[1:43:10] can you imagine that and it's the truth
[1:43:13] look in the scriptures
[1:43:15] Satan transform himself into an angel of
[1:43:19] Light
[1:43:20] hiding in the light
[1:43:23] trying to deceive you
[1:43:25] trying
[1:43:27] to throw you off
[1:43:29] God's plan for your life and your path
[1:43:33] throw things in your way
[1:43:36] look at this life as
[1:43:39] a a a schooling ground a testing ground
[1:43:43] look at the people in your life and your
[1:43:45] family everything that's placed around
[1:43:47] you everybody who's come into your life
[1:43:50] as a purpose and when you look at it
[1:43:52] that way you'll start seeing
[1:43:55] what's leading you off the path I don't
[1:43:58] have to tell you
[1:44:00] you're running into this you're running
[1:44:02] into brick walls you're running into
[1:44:04] problems
[1:44:06] you run into all kinds of demons
[1:44:08] fighting against you
[1:44:11] it's order for you to find out
[1:44:14] the path that you're on
[1:44:17] if you're walking in that path
[1:44:20] and know so that you in the spirit of
[1:44:23] God
[1:44:24] can get together
[1:44:26] and he can reveal to you
[1:44:29] so you can stay walking then you'll know
[1:44:31] you don't need nobody to tell you
[1:44:33] brother you know what should I uh
[1:44:35] separate from this person should I not
[1:44:37] see this person should I those days are
[1:44:39] gone
[1:44:40] don't call me and ask me for that I know
[1:44:43] that maybe somebody else will will
[1:44:45] answer you but not me
[1:44:46] I'll say I'll pray
[1:44:49] let the Lord reveal it this is the hour
[1:44:51] brother where she knows who she is she
[1:44:54] knows what to do with the word
[1:44:59] Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a
[1:45:02] storm
[1:45:03] the way the waves were knocking the boat
[1:45:06] from side to side
[1:45:08] he was standing face to face with a mess
[1:45:10] of demons he never moved him he walked
[1:45:14] right on just as calm and as quiet as he
[1:45:17] could be
[1:45:18] why
[1:45:20] he was simply unconscious of fear or
[1:45:23] anything around him
[1:45:26] he didn't say oh I have to pray
[1:45:30] through
[1:45:34] ouch we're going to hit some hit some
[1:45:36] beliefs here
[1:45:38] wonder if I fast long enough
[1:45:41] wonder if I did this
[1:45:43] he just walked right on unconsciously
[1:45:47] he believed what God Said was the truth
[1:45:50] the words
[1:45:52] you see there's a difference here
[1:45:54] you know why you know why some people
[1:45:57] I'm gonna say it like I said I'm going
[1:45:59] to be saying in all the service you know
[1:46:01] why some people pray pray pray pray pray
[1:46:05] pray about this pray about this you got
[1:46:07] to pray about this you got to pray about
[1:46:08] this I'm not against praying you know
[1:46:09] that those who know me
[1:46:12] but it's because
[1:46:14] you don't believe
[1:46:17] it's because you don't believe I'm going
[1:46:20] to tell you the truth
[1:46:22] a lot of the prayers is because you
[1:46:24] don't believe
[1:46:25] because if you did believe
[1:46:28] Jesus walked unconsciously of fear he
[1:46:30] walked that way why because he knew and
[1:46:33] believed who he was and what God said
[1:46:35] about him
[1:46:37] if you know
[1:46:38] and believe who you are what God said
[1:46:41] about you
[1:46:43] then why cry in prayer
[1:46:45] speak the word
[1:46:49] speak the word
[1:46:51] you are met with a challenge
[1:46:55] whatever it might be
[1:46:59] speak the word
[1:47:06] and walk
[1:47:08] unconsciously of fear of that thing
[1:47:14] what do you got
[1:47:16] what do you got
[1:47:18] this morning in this
[1:47:21] that fears you
[1:47:23] your life
[1:47:26] is not in your hands
[1:47:30] the Lord gives the Lord takes whatever
[1:47:32] he wants and he'll give life when he
[1:47:35] wants
[1:47:39] death is in his hands death is swallowed
[1:47:42] up in Victory in him
[1:47:45] foreign
[1:47:47] so we fear death what do you got what
[1:47:51] material things you got what finances
[1:47:53] you got
[1:47:54] cars all these things that you fear that
[1:47:58] Satan threatens you what do you got that
[1:48:00] Satan threatens you
[1:48:03] that that brings you into that kind of
[1:48:06] fear
[1:48:08] lose it
[1:48:09] those who lose their life will gain it
[1:48:11] lose it
[1:48:13] Let It Go
[1:48:16] even to life Let It Go
[1:48:23] that's what he walked in
[1:48:25] he looked at the word he looked at his
[1:48:28] position he knew what the scripture said
[1:48:31] about him and that's what he walked in
[1:48:34] nothing else
[1:48:38] death
[1:48:39] look how he reacted to death
[1:48:43] oh so-and-so died so-and-so died
[1:48:46] he went over there and raised them up
[1:48:49] from the dead
[1:48:51] have no power
[1:48:54] death has no power over you
[1:48:56] no not if you're an attribute
[1:48:59] because you know that God that walked
[1:49:00] the Earth that I'm talking about here
[1:49:02] broke himself up
[1:49:05] and believe it or not
[1:49:07] that same God is inside of you
[1:49:10] [Music]
[1:49:18] so I want to come in contact
[1:49:22] with that reality more than anything
[1:49:28] I want to come subject and surrender to
[1:49:31] that
[1:49:32] portion of who I really am
[1:49:35] that's who I am
[1:49:38] oh Lord I recognize Who I Am Lord who I
[1:49:43] am I can see now
[1:49:47] just who I am
[1:49:49] I'm a part of my father
[1:49:51] I'm a part of my savior
[1:49:54] oh my
[1:49:56] God oh
[1:49:57] Lord Jesus help us all
[1:50:00] help brother Tim here this morning Lord
[1:50:03] thank you
[1:50:05] I'm I'm the chiefess
[1:50:07] when I'm when I'm under this anoint in
[1:50:10] this word I look at
[1:50:11] my heart is crying for the Holy Spirit
[1:50:14] more and more
[1:50:17] the words must be fulfilled
[1:50:20] in his life he knew that
[1:50:24] so he walked unconsciously of fear
[1:50:27] he walked unconsciously of criticism
[1:50:32] not paying attention to the right or to
[1:50:34] the left just keep moving just keep
[1:50:36] moving
[1:50:39] keep moving
[1:50:41] I don't care what goes on I can't
[1:50:44] predict what's going to go on next week
[1:50:46] whatever
[1:50:47] we hear our pastors is going into a
[1:50:50] retirement keep moving keep walking
[1:50:55] we have come into a maturity amen this
[1:51:00] is everything is happening for a reason
[1:51:02] and and a purpose and a time and a
[1:51:06] season
[1:51:07] because he knows
[1:51:09] I said he knows
[1:51:12] what's going on
[1:51:14] and he knows we're in a time of maturity
[1:51:20] no more pampering no more babysitting no
[1:51:23] more holding hands that's done
[1:51:26] you come in here with your maturity you
[1:51:28] come in here with your portion of Faith
[1:51:30] you come in here with your perfect faith
[1:51:32] knowing who you are
[1:51:34] and you stir things up
[1:51:36] you make things happen
[1:51:38] what God shows you when you come in here
[1:51:40] or you're at home and he reveals to you
[1:51:43] you speak it you you speak it and you
[1:51:45] expect it to happen
[1:51:49] what happened those days are not gone my
[1:51:51] brothers and sisters
[1:51:53] those days are not gone to the Bride of
[1:51:54] Jesus Christ when she sees the
[1:51:56] supernatural moving all the time
[1:51:59] confirming revealing
[1:52:02] oh my let me just
[1:52:04] try
[1:52:06] well I I must it must be uh there must
[1:52:10] be a pull here or something this morning

[1:52:14] half an hour I haven't been up here in
[1:52:15] so long and I'm going to be pooped out
[1:52:18] I'm a little pooped out but
[1:52:24] amen I'm just having a good old time up
[1:52:26] here
[1:52:28] I'm sure a couple of you are having a
[1:52:30] good time too
[1:52:32] as individuals we must stand alone with
[1:52:34] Christ and meet that devil face to face
[1:52:38] and defeat him
[1:52:40] on every level
[1:52:41] oh yes
[1:52:43] and defeat him do you do you hear that
[1:52:45] on every level every level
[1:52:49] or you might you might you know when
[1:52:51] you're battling
[1:52:52] you might lose a battle here and there
[1:52:54] but you'll get back up
[1:52:55] but you'll win you'll win that war you
[1:52:58] will win it
[1:52:59] you will win it
[1:53:01] God deals with the Gentiles a people he
[1:53:05] called out the Gentiles his bride a
[1:53:07] people one here one there one over here
[1:53:10] he deals with us as individuals
[1:53:12] regardless of race color or Creed he
[1:53:15] deals with us as individuals that's the
[1:53:17] way he does it
[1:53:19] perfect Faith brings the bride into
[1:53:21] perfect confidence
[1:53:22] that's what she's got perfect reality
[1:53:25] perfect confidence
[1:53:27] perfect everything brother Brian says
[1:53:30] everything is perfect in her
[1:53:32] because everything is perfect in her and
[1:53:34] him
[1:53:37] nothing wavering nothing locked nothing
[1:53:40] falling short everything is perfect
[1:53:43] oh I believe that
[1:53:46] that's all I have to do is believe that
[1:53:48] I believe that attribute is hard of me
[1:53:50] that one who started to work inside of
[1:53:52] me the one who's keeping me is perfect
[1:53:56] favorite
[1:53:57] oh my
[1:53:59] because why the quickening powers in her
[1:54:03] oh yeah this message to her is the
[1:54:07] resurrection when this word comes alive
[1:54:09] in the bride
[1:54:11] for a perfect manifestation that
[1:54:14] quickening power makes her aware of all
[1:54:18] things shows her how to live above all
[1:54:22] her weaknesses all her struggles all
[1:54:25] circumstances
[1:54:30] oh
[1:54:32] I know
[1:54:36] personal revelation is the way we know
[1:54:39] for ourselves the most important truths
[1:54:42] of our existence
[1:54:45] that live in realities of God
[1:54:47] and God's purpose and directing for us
[1:54:51] personal revelation
[1:54:56] Hallelujah
[1:54:58] let me just try to close it off here
[1:55:01] with something here
[1:55:02] Hallelujah
[1:55:08] Hallelujah
[1:55:14] it's called The Musicians up
[1:55:26] the answer lies in the position of the
[1:55:28] key is not
[1:55:31] it is not in his hands
[1:55:34] is not worn around his neck
[1:55:37] it is not placed in the hands of another
[1:55:40] man
[1:55:43] or could it be he alone has the key
[1:55:49] he opens no man shuts he shuts no man
[1:55:52] opens
[1:55:53] he has that right
[1:55:57] Jesus himself isn't that right
[1:56:00] but where is the key it's on his
[1:56:03] shoulders
[1:56:04] but what does shoulders have to do with
[1:56:06] it read Isaiah 9 6 the government shall
[1:56:09] be upon his shoulders
[1:56:11] but what does those what does that mean
[1:56:13] the answer is in this phrase the
[1:56:16] government upon his shoulder comes from
[1:56:18] the wedding ceremony of the East
[1:56:21] when the bride has committed to the
[1:56:23] groom she takes off the veil and places
[1:56:25] it over the groom's shoulder signifying
[1:56:28] that not only is she under his Dominion
[1:56:32] she has transferred her rights to him
[1:56:37] I know this is just words but this is
[1:56:39] this is a reality to the bride
[1:56:42] it is this is a reality to the Bride of
[1:56:44] Jesus Christ
[1:56:45] she walks and lives this and experiences
[1:56:48] this every day
[1:56:50] that he is the head but also that he
[1:56:53] Bears the responsibility
[1:56:55] and the care
[1:56:57] and that he and he alone no one else no
[1:57:00] other man no other power has the right
[1:57:05] and responsibility but him
[1:57:08] oh that is so powerful
[1:57:12] and that that beloved is the Key of
[1:57:14] David
[1:57:18] God being Sovereign he foreknew by
[1:57:21] Divine degreed exactly who would be in
[1:57:24] his bride
[1:57:25] he chose her
[1:57:27] she did not choose him
[1:57:30] he called her
[1:57:33] to the ones who recognize
[1:57:36] that you are this
[1:57:38] this is powerful
[1:57:41] this is powerful
[1:57:44] because you did not Choose Yourself
[1:57:45] remember the scripture says many are
[1:57:48] called but few are chosen but you
[1:57:50] recognize in this hour by the word of
[1:57:53] God
[1:57:54] being manifested and come into a place
[1:57:57] of clarity perfect realization is coming
[1:58:00] through the word of God
[1:58:02] that he chose you you didn't choose him
[1:58:05] he called you
[1:58:07] he placed you he positionally placed you
[1:58:11] in him
[1:58:14] he washed her with his own blood he paid
[1:58:17] the price for her she belongs to him and
[1:58:19] him alone
[1:58:21] she is Holy committed
[1:58:24] to him
[1:58:25] and he accepts the obligation
[1:58:28] he is her head for Christ is the head of
[1:58:32] the his church
[1:58:33] as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the
[1:58:36] bride is happy
[1:58:38] that he is Lord what is Lord
[1:58:40] what is Lord
[1:58:42] it's not just a word
[1:58:44] he is ruler
[1:58:47] over everything
[1:58:50] I know
[1:58:53] I have to come
[1:58:56] and I will come to a place
[1:58:59] where he will be fully Lord
[1:59:02] in my life because I can still see
[1:59:04] things you could still see things
[1:59:06] that that may put questions in your mind
[1:59:09] but see my faith inside of me
[1:59:12] what I've recognized my position in the
[1:59:15] word and my calling that he's called me
[1:59:18] I know
[1:59:19] that everything
[1:59:22] because it's in my heart
[1:59:24] it's the desire of my heart for
[1:59:28] everything to come under
[1:59:30] lordship to him
[1:59:33] and because of that
[1:59:35] right
[1:59:37] because what does it say in the Old
[1:59:38] Testament I'm trying to remember the
[1:59:40] scripture
[1:59:43] they
[1:59:46] and their faith was not made perfect
[1:59:48] without us
[1:59:50] but God counted for them for
[1:59:53] righteousness
[1:59:54] and counted them in
[1:59:56] while you're counted in when you come
[1:59:59] and recognize Who You Are
[2:00:01] and your position
[2:00:03] everything that the word of God says is
[2:00:06] counted in for you
[2:00:15] we we we say he looks through the blood
[2:00:18] the word the bleeding word that's all he
[2:00:21] sees in you
[2:00:23] only if you can see that you see that's
[2:00:27] What Makes You Different that's what's
[2:00:30] going to make you walk talk live that's
[2:00:33] what's going to create an atmosphere
[2:00:34] around you a presence around you
[2:00:38] it's not how much you study it's not how
[2:00:40] much you pray those things help
[2:00:42] but even greater than all that
[2:00:46] when you understand who you are
[2:00:50] that was the power that was around Jesus
[2:00:52] Christ
[2:00:54] the understanding of who he was
[2:00:58] what he was called for what he was
[2:01:00] positionally placed on the earth at that
[2:01:02] time what he needed to fulfill
[2:01:05] that's what created the power in him
[2:01:07] that's why demons were scared of him
[2:01:10] not because oh you can walk around you
[2:01:13] got great power in the name of Jesus
[2:01:15] Christ casts out that demon
[2:01:19] that's all man-made that's gone
[2:01:23] that is gone
[2:01:25] but when you walk with that confidence
[2:01:27] of who you are in him
[2:01:30] and that word living unconsciously
[2:01:33] around you that's what creates that
[2:01:36] atmosphere and that's what demons are
[2:01:38] scared of that is the light of God that
[2:01:41] is projecting through you darkness is
[2:01:44] leaving my friends
[2:01:45] the light is growing
[2:01:48] thy light is pushing out the darkness
[2:01:52] [Music]
[2:01:53] um
[2:01:55] Hallelujah
[2:01:58] God
[2:02:02] is a reality
[2:02:05] God is real
[2:02:07] and if you don't know him
[2:02:11] like Paul said
[2:02:13] I
[2:02:15] want to know him in the power of his
[2:02:18] resurrection
[2:02:20] the power of the reality of God
[2:02:23] the word he in the word are one of the
[2:02:25] power of the word in my life in your
[2:02:28] life
[2:02:30] my brothers and sisters

[2:02:37] in the word of God

[2:02:46] I'm not going to
[2:02:48] threaten you with hell or this or that
[2:02:51] [Music]
[2:02:53] because the truth and the reality is
