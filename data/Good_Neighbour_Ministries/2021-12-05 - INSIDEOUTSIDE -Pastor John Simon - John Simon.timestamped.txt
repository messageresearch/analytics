[35:14] i'm indeed happy to be here this morning
[35:17] please be seated
[35:18] [Music]
[35:20] after
[35:22] a period of time
[35:24] of about two months
[35:28] i was allowed to rest
[35:31] relaxed and i thank the lord jesus
[35:34] christ for that
[35:35] of course that means
[35:37] [Applause]
[35:41] and i thank god that most of the people
[35:44] kind of left me alone
[35:47] so
[35:49] yes you know what i mean it's not all
[35:51] the calls and
[35:53] this and that i was literally left alone
[35:56] so that i could kind of recuperate
[36:00] remember i'm not 16 now
[36:04] and you start
[36:06] normally to feel the various creakings
[36:10] and achings
[36:11] and the old window goes blowing in the
[36:13] wind and
[36:14] banging on the side of the door and all
[36:16] that sort of thing so and you you wake
[36:19] up and there's certain aches that might
[36:22] be there you got to kind of work out
[36:24] before you can really get moving
[36:27] so it's a different life
[36:30] but i want to thank god that i'm
[36:32] enjoying his life
[36:36] and i want to thank god that he's the
[36:38] same yesterday today and forever
[36:41] and he doesn't change and he does not
[36:44] lie
[36:45] and his word remains the same
[36:48] i want to thank god
[36:50] as i watched the
[36:52] broadcast
[36:53] of of the brothers ministering on
[36:56] afforded days of purpose
[36:59] listening to the reaction of the
[37:00] congregation in response to the
[37:02] preaching of the word
[37:04] and it was just a blessing to see the
[37:08] grain ripening
[37:10] thank god that when the lord jesus comes
[37:13] again he will not go to the tree and
[37:16] find no fruit
[37:18] but there he will find fruit in the
[37:21] words of brother branham fruit
[37:24] ripened for his coming glory
[37:26] thank god so we thank god for this the
[37:31] ministries of the various brothers
[37:33] growing and ripening for his glory and
[37:37] honor
[37:38] of course you know they were they were
[37:40] staying within a certain confine
[37:44] they were not
[37:46] into the message message as such
[37:49] they were dealing with 40 days of
[37:51] purpose
[37:53] so they stuck within that confined to be
[37:56] able to bring those thoughts to you but
[37:59] praise the lord
[38:01] but i'm not here for that
[38:04] they are going to come back but they
[38:06] will be here from a different frame of
[38:08] reference
[38:09] and so i'm here now to
[38:12] come to you from the word of god
[38:17] and i am free to soar and fly in every
[38:20] direction
[38:23] so if i ramble
[38:26] if i roar if i
[38:29] sound like i'm screaming or anything
[38:31] like that
[38:33] it's just friends
[38:35] when
[38:36] this
[38:37] really gets a hold of you
[38:40] i i tell you words can not explain or
[38:44] expound
[38:46] what it is you
[38:47] we are trying to use words to express
[38:51] the eternal
[38:53] and you fail for words
[38:56] even though i know he's gifted me with
[38:58] that but the fact is even
[39:01] it fails you
[39:02] to express god and himself and what it
[39:06] is that he wants to say
[39:08] only when he desires it then he gives us
[39:12] that clarity
[39:14] and we want to take for a
[39:17] subject today
[39:19] inside
[39:20] outside
[39:24] inside
[39:25] outside
[39:27] now first of all let's
[39:29] read from
[39:32] look you can use many scriptures to
[39:34] preach on this subject
[39:36] but i'm just going to start from genesis
[39:39] right
[39:41] take
[39:42] genesis 7
[39:47] i believe i have here verse
[39:54] 16.
[39:56] and it's all about noah
[39:59] how many knows the story of noah
[40:02] and how in his age violence was all over
[40:06] the place
[40:07] sexuality immorality everything was
[40:10] spread everywhere population explosion
[40:14] pollution nuclear proliferation was
[40:17] already there creating the explosions
[40:20] and the destruction and everything else
[40:22] and uh
[40:25] there
[40:25] that man stood by the command of god
[40:29] in the door of the ark the archetype
[40:33] lord of course and here he was preaching
[40:37] for 120 years
[40:40] 120 years
[40:43] now look i'm only preaching here for
[40:46] what
[40:47] 51 years or whatever and some people are
[40:51] getting tired of that kind of manner all
[40:53] right you know they get tired of that
[40:56] manner
[40:57] you know you begin to sound like all the
[40:59] other preachers because you're saying
[41:02] the same thing but those with the
[41:04] revelation
[41:06] they can hear a ring they can hear a
[41:09] gospel sound
[41:11] they can hear the eagles cry coming out
[41:14] of the word and recognize that it's god
[41:17] speaking from the word amen oh praise
[41:21] god so he was doing that and you know
[41:24] the people got used to his preaching
[41:26] after 120 years here in the same man
[41:29] with the same thing
[41:31] coming back with the same message every
[41:34] day after day
[41:35] you know and
[41:38] god had it that way so they get kind of
[41:40] tired and fed up by hearing him and they
[41:43] don't want to hear they start to shut
[41:44] him down and they start to shut him out
[41:47] and not to listen to what he's saying
[41:51] anymore literally praise god and uh
[41:55] after a while the bible said the time
[41:58] for the flood came
[42:00] and it tells you how god caused him to
[42:02] call the animals uh right there to the
[42:06] ark right
[42:07] now um i'm sure he just called all the
[42:10] animals he didn't know which too but he
[42:12] called all the animals and when they get
[42:15] to the word
[42:16] then
[42:17] they're by election the holy spirit know
[42:20] which two
[42:21] and they start to enter into the ark by
[42:24] election right
[42:26] and the bible tells us here as we read
[42:29] our text verse 16
[42:33] and they went in onto
[43:01] and the lord shut the rest of them out
[43:04] it just says here and the lord shut him
[43:08] in
[43:09] because god's priority
[43:11] is to get his elected out
[43:14] right
[43:15] he bring them in that he might take them
[43:17] away
[43:18] and
[43:19] by the shutting in
[43:21] automatically shuts out
[43:24] all right the door closes and it shuts
[43:28] somebody in and it shut a whole bunch of
[43:30] people out
[43:31] at the same time what the same door
[43:34] the same door of liberty freedom
[43:37] salvation deliverance
[43:40] when it shuts
[43:42] it shuts the elected in
[43:45] and it shuts out
[43:47] the others on the outside let us pray
[43:50] before we go into the word of god itself
[43:53] heavenly father we thank you for the uh
[43:56] introduction and reading of the word we
[43:58] pray that the holy spirit will minister
[44:01] to us each one
[44:02] and lord god
[44:05] reveal this truth show to us father
[44:08] clearly what it is that you want us to
[44:12] see and say and do
[44:14] in this day and this hour for your glory
[44:17] and honor in jesus name amen praise the
[44:20] lord please be seated
[44:27] of course
[44:29] i just spoke up
[44:31] about noah
[44:32] and telling you
[44:35] how of course noah stood in the ark's
[44:38] door
[44:39] the type of the word preaching to the
[44:42] people
[44:43] warning his generation
[44:46] now
[44:47] noah is a type
[44:49] of the bride
[44:50] preaching to the eternal lost
[44:54] to the souls that are imprisoned now
[44:58] prisoners as the song just said in their
[45:01] own minds
[45:03] prisoners
[45:05] away from the word of god
[45:08] and
[45:10] here is the bride as jesus said as it
[45:13] was
[45:15] in the days of noah
[45:17] so shall it be
[45:20] in the day
[45:22] when the son of man is being revealed
[45:26] that there will be some
[45:28] noise of the word
[45:31] in this end time
[45:33] that are going to stand
[45:36] right in the middle of the word and
[45:38] preach it
[45:40] they're going to say it
[45:42] and when they say it
[45:44] lots of people said man i heard of
[45:46] brandon i heard of this message i heard
[45:49] about this i was even in it
[45:52] and i came out
[45:54] [Laughter]
[45:55] i was in the middle of the whole thing
[45:57] and
[45:58] i can't stand there there's a whole lot
[46:00] of animals in there and all kind of
[46:02] people in there and all kinds of strange
[46:05] the things i've never seen uh taking
[46:08] place and makes me feel funny i can't
[46:11] stand it anymore so
[46:14] i got out to the of the ark
[46:17] and i'm on the outside now
[46:19] listening to this man preaching the same
[46:22] thing which i heard
[46:24] all the time
[46:26] who am i and i'm tired of it you know
[46:29] i can't uh
[46:31] listen to it anymore but you see
[46:34] as i've just said they didn't realize
[46:38] while
[46:39] noah was in
[46:41] they were automatically shut out
[46:45] it did not seem dramatic then
[46:48] because he was simply and they could
[46:51] laugh at the scenery of him a door shut
[46:55] and you're in this little this wooden
[46:57] boat
[46:58] uh claiming there's a flood coming
[47:01] it looked so fantastic and idiotic
[47:04] and here we are uh preaching this word
[47:10] that was left by a god-sent prophet
[47:14] declaring it to a scientific generation
[47:18] a generation that's so full of wisdom
[47:21] and knowledge of man
[47:23] that you can hardly explain expound or
[47:26] say anything to them
[47:28] they don't want to hear it
[47:30] because they feel it's real religion got
[47:33] a hold of you
[47:36] they feel you're you're religious and
[47:38] that's all right
[47:39] if you want to be religious
[47:41] you know
[47:42] you say but i got the truth yeah that's
[47:44] your truth
[47:47] you know
[47:49] your truth and my truth and everybody
[47:51] got the truth so so so so what's what
[47:54] you're talking about you left like that
[47:56] you see so the point is it's you that
[47:59] must know
[48:00] what you gotta hold off but here it is
[48:03] that uh we are in the same situation as
[48:06] noah was i'm speaking on the topic of
[48:09] inside
[48:11] outside
[48:13] and here we are
[48:15] in the same
[48:16] spirit and attitude i want to quickly
[48:20] touch on israel
[48:22] when they
[48:24] that angel came
[48:26] god said get in that house
[48:30] shut the door
[48:32] stay on the inside
[48:34] don't come outside
[48:36] but stay inside
[48:38] because when the angel passes when i see
[48:41] the blood i'll pass over you
[48:45] but you see
[48:46] for him to pass over you you have to be
[48:49] on the inside
[48:51] there were inside with the blood on the
[48:54] door
[48:55] oh praise god i trust that blood is on
[48:58] the door of your hearts this morning
[49:01] i trust that the blood of the cross is
[49:04] stand across your soul today by the
[49:07] grace of god amen hallelujah yes sir i
[49:11] want you to see
[49:13] that
[49:15] while it sealed them in
[49:18] all the egyptians
[49:21] all the unbelieving
[49:23] jews
[49:25] that were there
[49:27] that did not go in
[49:29] that was sealed out
[49:31] they were on the outside
[49:33] so all of this is also a type of a
[49:36] ceiling time
[49:38] stealing some him
[49:40] and sealing some out
[49:42] because you see that ark had to be
[49:44] pitched on the inside on the outside
[49:47] to seal whatever is outside from coming
[49:50] in
[49:51] and seal in those from the inside from
[49:55] going back outside
[49:56] sealed by the word and by the blood in
[49:59] our day
[50:01] sealed by the holy spirit
[50:03] and we'll touch on that praise god as we
[50:07] get closer into the word hallelujah i
[50:11] want you to see
[50:12] they were sealed then
[50:15] then
[50:16] i want you to look
[50:18] at the holy of holies
[50:22] when
[50:23] the high priest went in
[50:26] nobody could follow him in there
[50:30] typing us
[50:31] [Music]
[50:32] kings and priests to god
[50:35] nothing can touch you
[50:37] after you've entered back into the lord
[50:41] as the son said i have passed the inner
[50:44] veil
[50:45] where the glories never fail
[50:48] hallelujah hallelujah
[50:51] amen i'm living in the presence of the
[50:54] king why you're inside the veil
[50:58] but while the priest was on the inside
[51:01] of the veil many others was on the
[51:04] outside of the veil some in the outer
[51:07] court some in the inner court
[51:09] but only the priest was allowed into the
[51:12] holy of holies
[51:14] oh praise god we'll touch on that also
[51:17] that you might understand in this hour
[51:21] what god is doing in our day and in our
[51:25] time
[51:26] i want to point to you also
[51:29] here was jacob and esau
[51:33] on the outside
[51:35] jacob looked as if he was a renegade
[51:39] and a rebel
[51:41] but really
[51:43] on the inside
[51:44] he was the son the seed son of the
[51:48] living god
[51:50] he saw on the outside he looked polished
[51:54] up
[51:54] he looked so gentlemanly he looked like
[51:58] a good son
[51:59] he looked like a real christian
[52:01] matter of fact he looked like a better
[52:03] christian than you appear to be and here
[52:06] he was he looked up he appeared better
[52:08] than jacob was
[52:10] but jacob had something on the inside
[52:16] why esau had something on the outside
[52:20] that appeared to the people that that
[52:23] was enough to give him the inheritance
[52:27] but really we're talking about something
[52:29] that god gives that you have on the
[52:32] inside
[52:33] [Applause]
[52:35] jacob and esau
[52:37] when we go back into the times of jesus
[52:39] we see the priest and the prostitute
[52:43] and the priest
[52:45] was a good old man
[52:47] that helped your grandmother help your
[52:49] father give them food give them charity
[52:51] give them say vincent whatever
[52:54] assistance or whatever and you think oh
[52:57] this kind of priest this good old man
[53:00] he's such a kind man he moves so holy
[53:04] and so
[53:06] wonderful but jesus said of him you're a
[53:10] generation of vipers
[53:13] amen yes your generation of snakes
[53:17] on the outside it says you wash the
[53:20] platter
[53:22] hallelujah make your outside look so
[53:24] good
[53:26] on the inside you're a walking graveyard
[53:31] oh my
[53:32] there it was
[53:34] on the outside
[53:36] one looks so holy
[53:40] while on the inside was a graveyard of
[53:44] dead man's bones
[53:46] and the other one on the outside the
[53:49] prostitute you can look and see that's
[53:52] your natural eyes telling you but when
[53:54] god looks at that person he sees an
[53:58] elected seed living underneath there
[54:01] praise god
[54:02] hallelujah
[54:04] yes my brothers
[54:05] i want to thank god for bringing this
[54:08] wonderful topic and talk to me
[54:13] showing how
[54:14] these disciples were in the upper room
[54:18] in the upper chamber they're in the
[54:21] presence of god
[54:22] hallelujah and but when the holy ghost
[54:26] fell
[54:27] it fell on them and anointed them and
[54:30] filled them with the holy spirit
[54:32] praise god you say but brother simon
[54:35] didn't the people outside even hear them
[54:38] speak with towns and prophesy didn't
[54:40] they have some kind of a blessing to yes
[54:43] they were but only some of them received
[54:47] what the spirit of god was giving
[54:50] and what the spirit of god was giving
[54:53] sealed them in
[54:55] it blessed them hallelujah but it sealed
[54:58] out the entire crowd that was outside
[55:01] that was mocking them
[55:03] and calling them all manner of names
[55:06] hallelujah amen i want to tell you my
[55:10] friends i believe this is a day when the
[55:12] marking angel is again sealing some in
[55:17] and sealing some on the outside
[55:21] while this is going on right now
[55:24] in 10 virgins
[55:26] the mess is called ten virgins 1960.
[55:30] he says you know
[55:33] when a woman makes up her mind
[55:37] she
[55:38] she has a pattern in front of her
[55:42] right
[55:43] and she makes up her mind
[55:45] where she is going to cut in that
[55:48] pattern
[55:50] oh my
[55:52] she she gets what she thinks is the best
[55:55] part of that pattern
[55:57] oh glory to god hallelujah
[56:00] it's all the same goods
[56:03] but let she lays out the goods we all
[56:06] human beings here right we all got a
[56:09] thirst we all
[56:10] got a religious something in us we want
[56:13] to wash up something magnify something
[56:16] right but see
[56:18] she lays it down
[56:20] then she takes her scissors and she cuts
[56:24] out
[56:25] now what is left over is called the
[56:28] remnant we're not teaching on that but
[56:30] this is showing you how the remnant is
[56:33] actually like the ten virgins like the
[56:35] five virgins they're virgins
[56:38] so they're gonna have to come up in the
[56:39] remnant for the tribulation but they're
[56:42] not to be in the bride
[56:44] because they're not in the pattern but i
[56:47] want to thank god this morning that i
[56:49] believe i'm in the factory
[56:51] i believe i was elected and chosen by
[56:55] god to be inside the pattern
[56:58] hallelujah while i'm in
[57:01] many are out
[57:04] one in a million
[57:06] the same day you got saved maybe a
[57:08] million were lost on the outside we take
[57:12] our salvation just a regular thing
[57:15] we just take this coming to church
[57:18] worshiping god being in what we call the
[57:21] message to be
[57:23] something that's ordinary but let me
[57:26] tell you you are on the divine
[57:28] inspiration of the holy spirit because
[57:32] he has got a hold of you and he brought
[57:35] you here by his grace
[57:36] [Applause]
[57:38] look brother david is right there where
[57:40] is he from
[57:42] across the world
[57:44] some of you where you're from
[57:47] you come from the east and the west the
[57:49] north and the south
[57:51] hallelujah
[57:53] their sister julia our daughter they
[57:55] come from way over into new zealand who
[57:58] brought them here
[58:00] who brought them under this ministry why
[58:03] would they have to listen to me they can
[58:05] listen to anybody they want to listen to
[58:07] but there's something about the holy
[58:09] spirit when he ordains you to a ministry
[58:12] a voice that will bring the word of god
[58:15] to you it fits your soul like a hand in
[58:18] a glove oh i don't care what race what
[58:21] religion where you come from when you
[58:23] hear that voice of the living god it
[58:25] inspires your soul amen
[58:29] hallelujah
[58:31] that's why the apostles were so
[58:32] confident even though what they tell the
[58:35] people to even try to drive them away
[58:37] they don't want to go away why because
[58:39] it's not them they're not doing nothing
[58:41] they don't have to do nothing you know i
[58:43] don't have to do a sales job on you to
[58:45] keep you here
[58:47] i don't have to do a job of persuasion
[58:49] or i don't have to do anything like that
[58:52] to be able to convert you or something
[58:54] like that there's somebody here under
[58:57] this word that's speaking to your soul
[59:00] [Applause]
[59:01] there's the holy spirit that takes the
[59:05] word and applies it to your heart
[59:08] amen praise god the days are gone when
[59:12] the sheep got to be kept by the shepherd
[59:17] you are not kept by this shepherd you
[59:19] are kept by the power of god through
[59:22] your revelation of faith
[59:23] [Music]
[59:25] it's your revelation of faith according
[59:27] to your faith your revelation so shall
[59:31] it be unto you
[59:32] it's yours your revelation you have
[59:35] caught that's keeping you to the word
[59:38] that's why it's an individual revelation
[59:41] it's not my revelation
[59:44] it's your revelation
[59:46] hallelujah why because it's like paul
[59:49] said he says it's my gospel now because
[59:53] i hear it i recognize it i see it i
[59:56] caught a revelation of it hallelujah
[59:59] that's my gospel
[1:00:01] my gospel belongs to me
[1:00:04] [Applause]
[1:00:06] oh my mother got it my father got in my
[1:00:08] brother by god no no no no no it's you
[1:00:13] and i'm not telling you to see it and
[1:00:15] even if i tell you you can't see it
[1:00:18] unless god wants you to see it
[1:00:21] hallelujah praise god let me continue
[1:00:24] here so that we can finish the day by
[1:00:26] the grace of god
[1:00:29] he says here now
[1:00:32] wow
[1:00:33] what is this pattern
[1:00:36] amen
[1:00:37] that pattern was there
[1:00:40] and elected that elected lady she
[1:00:44] elected to cut from it from it
[1:00:47] god before the foundations of the world
[1:00:51] also know his pattern
[1:00:53] hallelujah of course you know what he's
[1:00:55] talking about who is the pattern who is
[1:00:57] the life's pattern jesus christ
[1:01:00] we want to pattern ourselves after him
[1:01:03] that's why we think to be like jesus
[1:01:07] to be like
[1:01:08] jesus on earth i long
[1:01:12] to be like him
[1:01:15] oh praise god he's our pattern brother
[1:01:18] that's mine he is the statue of a
[1:01:21] perfect man
[1:01:22] glory to god
[1:01:24] and now god cut us
[1:01:27] from the lord
[1:01:29] like that pattern
[1:01:31] amen he cut you from that pattern praise
[1:01:35] god hallelujah see
[1:01:39] before the foundation of the world he
[1:01:42] knew the end from the beginning
[1:01:45] by foreknowledge
[1:01:46] and he
[1:01:48] elected where to cut
[1:01:51] amen
[1:01:52] he knew the difference
[1:01:55] between esau and jacob
[1:01:58] he knew the difference
[1:02:00] between sinner and saint
[1:02:02] he knows the difference of the motives
[1:02:06] of every single heart
[1:02:09] so he elected us before the foundation
[1:02:12] of the world
[1:02:13] put our names on the lamb's book of life
[1:02:17] and also
[1:02:18] the lamb that was slain
[1:02:22] put our names on
[1:02:24] before
[1:02:26] that lamb was even slain
[1:02:29] think of it praise god my friends god
[1:02:34] elected you back there
[1:02:36] to
[1:02:37] when he was elected back there to be the
[1:02:40] lamb to be slain we were elected to be
[1:02:43] the ones that he would be slain for
[1:02:47] hallelujah amen now many say just
[1:02:51] because you accepted christ as your
[1:02:53] personal savior that doesn't mean you're
[1:02:56] going in any rapture
[1:03:00] that's for the elect only
[1:03:02] they go in the rapture
[1:03:05] there'll be a remnant left here on the
[1:03:07] earth and they'll have to go through
[1:03:09] persecution
[1:03:10] and tribulation
[1:03:12] hallelujah but the bride will be caught
[1:03:15] up in the rapture
[1:03:17] oh my word god's election
[1:03:21] makes the pattern
[1:03:23] amen
[1:03:24] now i have jesus said
[1:03:27] i have chosen you before the foundation
[1:03:30] of the world do you believe that
[1:03:32] jesus told the disciples
[1:03:35] he was with them they were with him and
[1:03:40] he had chosen them and that he knew them
[1:03:43] already from before the foundations of
[1:03:46] the world was ever laid oh praise god
[1:03:49] right there the holy spirit speaking on
[1:03:51] the inside while i'm talking to you
[1:03:53] saying you see that's how prophecy comes
[1:03:55] because he already knows you thank you
[1:03:58] he can tell you anything about yourself
[1:04:01] because you were there and he already
[1:04:03] knew you he's not now learning something
[1:04:06] or not having to read your mind or now
[1:04:09] no he knew you from before the
[1:04:12] foundation to the world
[1:04:14] and so he can tell you everything about
[1:04:16] yourself
[1:04:17] and anything
[1:04:19] that's in your heart
[1:04:20] because you're thinking that you're now
[1:04:23] thinking
[1:04:24] you are thinking that you now thinking
[1:04:28] but you're actually rehearsing what us
[1:04:31] praise god that's another thing but
[1:04:34] you're going back over what was already
[1:04:36] there before the foundational world and
[1:04:38] he already knows where you're going what
[1:04:40] which way your mind your thoughts or
[1:04:42] your actions and everything is going
[1:04:45] amen praise god hallelujah my friends
[1:04:49] there's a there'll be a group of people
[1:04:53] that will be so good
[1:04:55] so upright
[1:04:57] even holy living
[1:04:59] god save people
[1:05:01] but they will not be in the rapture
[1:05:05] they'll come up in the second
[1:05:07] resurrection
[1:05:09] see
[1:05:10] that's the way it is
[1:05:12] oh my
[1:05:14] oh praise god now let's go here let's go
[1:05:18] over and listen to the prophet speaking
[1:05:20] from why are people so tossed about
[1:05:23] now
[1:05:25] he says
[1:05:26] that priest takes the charger of blood
[1:05:29] of the lamb
[1:05:31] and he walks into the inner court into
[1:05:35] the presence of god
[1:05:37] and when he went in
[1:05:40] the veils fell behind him
[1:05:43] and he
[1:05:45] was shut in
[1:05:48] and there when he got shot in
[1:05:51] he became hidden
[1:05:54] from the outer world
[1:05:57] there on the outside to them he was him
[1:06:02] oh thank god we have a hiding place
[1:06:06] thank god we have an abiding place
[1:06:09] that we can walk in the presence of god
[1:06:12] and be hid from the things of the world
[1:06:15] remember
[1:06:16] when you go in
[1:06:18] right
[1:06:19] he says behind that veil
[1:06:22] it's
[1:06:23] sound proof
[1:06:25] hallelujah
[1:06:26] praise god
[1:06:28] it becomes soundproof
[1:06:31] praise god because you're on the inside
[1:06:35] in the presence of the eternal
[1:06:37] everlasting god while the world on the
[1:06:40] outside gasping and grasping and looking
[1:06:44] and searching but you are already on the
[1:06:47] inside can you say an amen
[1:06:50] hallelujah
[1:06:52] oh praise god you're on the inside and
[1:06:56] eating from the manna that's in there
[1:07:00] and that the manner will last for years
[1:07:04] hundreds of years for it can never be
[1:07:08] contaminated
[1:07:09] hallelujah
[1:07:11] it will never run out because that's the
[1:07:14] manner that you are feeding on while
[1:07:16] you're on the inside
[1:07:18] i'm talking about those on the inside of
[1:07:21] the revelation
[1:07:23] and those who are on the outside
[1:07:27] all together but some in the inside
[1:07:31] and this is what jesus referring to you
[1:07:33] when he says
[1:07:35] but unto you
[1:07:36] it's given to know the mysteries of the
[1:07:40] kingdom
[1:07:41] but unto them it is not given
[1:07:44] why
[1:07:45] you're in the inside
[1:07:47] you're on the outs others are on the
[1:07:49] outside and that is what i'm talking
[1:07:51] about it's not apparent that you're
[1:07:54] going to look around and uh no
[1:07:56] but this is what it is you're talking
[1:07:58] spiritually
[1:08:00] understanding
[1:08:01] revelation wise
[1:08:03] inside of the revelation outside of the
[1:08:06] revelation and that's why he said with
[1:08:08] less than five minutes you're talking
[1:08:10] with somebody you'll know whether
[1:08:12] they're in or they're out
[1:08:14] you're go you're gonna know whether they
[1:08:16] got the holy spirit or not
[1:08:18] because you can't help it you'll be
[1:08:20] you'll be able to recognize it amen you
[1:08:23] see a man that once walks
[1:08:26] right into god
[1:08:28] then a veil drops behind him
[1:08:32] and when it drops behind him it shuts
[1:08:35] out the things of the world from him
[1:08:38] for he is in the presence of the living
[1:08:41] god
[1:08:42] and now eating manna

[1:08:56] amen because they're living in the
[1:08:59] presence of the king amen

[1:09:08] aids time we got this time we got that
[1:09:11] time don't make no difference to that

[1:10:29] purpose he wants you to learn something
[1:10:31] know something somebody swearing cursing

[1:16:38] always strive to get out of this human
[1:16:41] culture that's trying to mold me and
[1:16:43] shape me and pour me into that kind of
[1:16:45] mold so that i can appear like one of
[1:16:48] these uh
[1:16:50] preachers that come off off of the
[1:16:52] cookie cutters and
[1:16:54] you know out of the bible schools and
[1:16:57] stuff like that trained and
[1:16:59] shaped and formed in such a way no
[1:17:03] god wants to shape his own man
[1:17:07] he wants to shape his own women
[1:17:10] let them see what a real woman should be
[1:17:14] what a real man should be what a real
[1:17:17] believer ought to be
[1:17:19] a true believer the deafness of
[1:17:21] counterfeit
[1:17:22] amen and you know what
[1:17:24] like i've seen since i was a young man
[1:17:27] god throws one coin and he's gonna throw
[1:17:29] a big handful
[1:17:31] and all the counterfeits around it amen
[1:17:33] let me tell you god's gonna produce
[1:17:35] everybody claiming they're christian
[1:17:38] doesn't matter how the mascara streaks
[1:17:39] dog and running down the tears running
[1:17:41] down and say i'm a christian
[1:17:44] no matter how their fingernails are long
[1:17:47] like a tigress and they're
[1:17:49] sticking in their eyes by mistake it is
[1:17:52] still a christian they're still born
[1:17:54] again
[1:17:56] you know
[1:17:57] they're still changed by the power of
[1:17:59] god they're still speaking towns and all
[1:18:01] that manual stuff but let me tell you
[1:18:04] the devil will accomplish his aims by
[1:18:06] whatever means he has to do it
[1:18:09] but the real believer their eyes are on
[1:18:13] the word
[1:18:14] and that pattern is not here in that
[1:18:18] word it don't fit amen
[1:18:20] we stand by the word of god as the
[1:18:22] songwriter said till the crown we gain
[1:18:25] glory to god hallelujah amen
[1:18:29] my god
[1:18:31] john chapter 30 20 verse 13 to 43 you
[1:18:34] don't have to find it
[1:18:36] also in luke 24
[1:18:38] verses 33 to 45 this is telling you
[1:18:43] jesus after he raised up
[1:18:46] and when he raised up what happened
[1:18:50] the bible said the disciples he appeared
[1:18:53] to them when they were in the room
[1:18:56] amen and you remember
[1:18:58] thomas was doubting before
[1:19:01] and saying i got to see him and if i
[1:19:04] don't stick my finger in his side and i
[1:19:07] don't touch those wounds that he got in
[1:19:10] the palm of my hand i am not going to
[1:19:12] believe
[1:19:13] amen but see he was a believer he said
[1:19:16] i'm not going to believe so he was a
[1:19:19] believer but he wanted some dramatic
[1:19:21] proof but jesus appeared in the room
[1:19:25] is that right
[1:19:26] behind closed doors
[1:19:29] amen and there when he appeared in the
[1:19:31] room
[1:19:33] let me quote brother branham here now
[1:19:36] when he got them inside closed doors
[1:19:40] speaking from proof of his resurrection
[1:19:44] what a difference that makes
[1:19:47] to those people
[1:19:49] them
[1:19:50] see
[1:19:52] there he was had been with him
[1:19:55] for a long time
[1:19:57] but these ones
[1:19:59] he left them in the room
[1:20:02] amen then the message for years and
[1:20:04] years and years
[1:20:06] and they know him
[1:20:08] for a long time
[1:20:10] they know him according to the flesh for
[1:20:12] a long time they can boast of the 40
[1:20:14] years 30 years whatever
[1:20:17] and here it is but these he met them in
[1:20:20] the room
[1:20:22] right
[1:20:22] oh my what a difference that makes
[1:20:26] but once christ comes on the inside
[1:20:29] amen let me tell you what i'm talking
[1:20:32] about not christ
[1:20:35] on the outside of it and reading it just
[1:20:39] like that and then saying yes it is true
[1:20:44] it is right you're reading out of the
[1:20:47] same bible i'm reading out
[1:20:49] and he said they have christ but he's on
[1:20:51] the outside
[1:20:52] and they can say
[1:20:54] yes it's true it's right
[1:20:57] but i'm talking about christ on the
[1:21:00] inside
[1:21:02] speaking and saying through that
[1:21:04] individual that's right
[1:21:06] amen you get the difference christ on
[1:21:09] the inside once inside then the door is
[1:21:14] closed
[1:21:15] and when the door closes to that
[1:21:18] individual on the inside of them he
[1:21:21] makes himself known to them by the way
[1:21:24] he's done something he'll break that
[1:21:27] bread to them amen and the breaking of
[1:21:30] the bread they'll know him by the
[1:21:32] breaking of the bread lord of god do you
[1:21:35] know him
[1:21:37] do you know him by the breaking of the
[1:21:39] bread oh praise god forever
[1:21:42] hallelujah let me tell you every true
[1:21:46] preacher that preaches
[1:21:48] this word and this message hallelujah
[1:21:52] they're going to have a lot of
[1:21:54] characteristics like their father
[1:21:58] hallelujah you follow brother brannon's
[1:22:00] message and you're gonna find you're
[1:22:02] gonna pick up a lot of things that was
[1:22:04] with him and on him you'll never be like
[1:22:07] him but things that were with him you're
[1:22:10] gonna have some of those characteristics
[1:22:12] you can help him why you've been
[1:22:14] listening in his message you've been
[1:22:15] hearing him you've been passing through
[1:22:17] all the time and you with your father
[1:22:20] your own natural father you can't help
[1:22:22] you don't have to do nothing it's there
[1:22:24] you don't have to do nothing it's a
[1:22:26] family trait hallelujah praise god and
[1:22:29] it'll be right there praise god
[1:22:32] hallelujah oh my praise god god hasn't
[1:22:37] planned out that way what a beautiful
[1:22:40] thing
[1:22:40] god's eternal plan of salvation for the
[1:22:45] individual hallelujah are you getting
[1:22:48] what i'm saying here inside outside
[1:22:51] inside or outside
[1:22:53] where are you praise the lord may god
[1:22:56] help us remember friends
[1:23:00] on the inside was the mercy seat
[1:23:03] hallelujah that's what was the inside
[1:23:06] hallelujah the believer psalms 1 tells
[1:23:10] you it's like a like a tree
[1:23:12] hallelujah
[1:23:14] blessed is the man
[1:23:16] he's like a tree
[1:23:18] planted by the rivers of living waters
[1:23:21] remember
[1:23:23] trees are never commanded
[1:23:26] to produce fruit
[1:23:28] we are not commanded to produce any
[1:23:31] fruit
[1:23:33] whatsoever
[1:23:34] no sir
[1:23:35] speaking from why can't people keep
[1:23:38] their victory
[1:23:40] we were never commanded to produce fruit
[1:23:43] no sir
[1:23:44] never said it anywhere
[1:23:47] we are told to bear fruit
[1:23:51] but not to produce fruit
[1:23:53] see
[1:23:54] and there's quite a difference
[1:23:57] in people producing
[1:24:00] and those that are bearing
[1:24:02] we produce education
[1:24:04] we produce psychology we produce
[1:24:07] intellectuals
[1:24:09] all that comes from the outside form
[1:24:13] but to bear fruit it must come
[1:24:18] from him that is on the inside
[1:24:22] you see
[1:24:23] they are trying to smear it all on on
[1:24:27] their outside
[1:24:30] but the god's church isn't built like
[1:24:34] that
[1:24:35] the bride isn't built like that
[1:24:38] it comes from the inside coming out
[1:24:43] apple comes from the outside of the tree
[1:24:47] it comes from the inside of the tree
[1:24:51] to the outside and the life of the tree
[1:24:55] shows what it is
[1:24:58] the believer is like a tree the believer
[1:25:00] is like sheep too you know
[1:25:02] remember listen to this
[1:25:05] you know the sheep is a sensitive odd
[1:25:07] animal and you know sheep was never
[1:25:10] asked to manufacture
[1:25:12] wool
[1:25:14] he was asked to bare wool
[1:25:17] and he bears wool
[1:25:19] not because of anything he does
[1:25:22] he just bears wool because he is a sheep
[1:25:27] is that right
[1:25:28] praise god thank god for the great
[1:25:30] ministries that went before us and they
[1:25:33] unveiled to us what we needed to know to
[1:25:35] draw us closer to god
[1:25:37] but we can't really add this and add
[1:25:40] that and add the other
[1:25:42] look it's written in the bible that way
[1:25:44] but they misunderstand what the meaning
[1:25:47] is it's like a child is a human being
[1:25:51] from the day it's born
[1:25:53] but it's got to add to its knowledge
[1:25:57] is that right
[1:25:58] but even
[1:26:00] it's got to add
[1:26:02] to its growth its size and everything
[1:26:04] but it's all going to happen naturally
[1:26:06] right they don't have to do nothing it's
[1:26:08] just gonna it's it's gonna bear it
[1:26:10] you don't have to go manufacture it or
[1:26:12] produce it or work yourself up into
[1:26:14] something to get it it's just there
[1:26:17] praise god
[1:26:19] hallelujah oh my oh my see we they're
[1:26:23] trying to smear it on the outside but it
[1:26:26] comes from the inside now we're asked to
[1:26:30] bear fruit
[1:26:32] not to manufacture fruits
[1:26:35] these
[1:26:36] things like long suffering joy peace
[1:26:40] faith meekness gentleness patience they
[1:26:43] are not to be manufactured
[1:26:46] dare to be products that comes from the
[1:26:49] inside to the outside
[1:26:52] the outside life that we live proves
[1:26:55] what is on the inside
[1:26:58] now
[1:26:59] we've tried to manufacture this to
[1:27:01] manufacture fruits of the spirit
[1:27:03] and what we find out all of that trying
[1:27:06] to manufacture turns out to be nothing
[1:27:09] but hypocrisy
[1:27:12] what did he say
[1:27:14] trying to manufacture it
[1:27:16] turns out to be nothing but hypocrisy
[1:27:20] because you can't manufacture real
[1:27:24] genuine christianity how many believe
[1:27:27] that
[1:27:28] you can't produce it
[1:27:30] amen
[1:27:31] for it is an experience
[1:27:34] by the spirit
[1:27:36] and the spirit that lives in you

[1:27:44] hallelujah the spirit of god in you
[1:27:47] identifying you by bearing fruit through

[1:37:47] platter clean but the inside you're

[1:37:52] and then
[1:37:54] his prophecy
[1:37:55] went forth
[1:37:57] condemning the organization
[1:38:01] and that's what made them turn against
[1:38:03] him
[1:38:05] and make him them want to crucify him

[1:40:02] if you really got
[1:40:06] a revelation
[1:40:08] he says
[1:40:10] you know now he doesn't call it the
[1:40:12] message
[1:40:13] he says right
[1:40:16] because he
[1:40:18] lives on
[1:40:20] he just made that quick short statement
[1:40:22] right there and stop
[1:40:24] because he lives on
[1:40:26] the message is him
[1:40:29] and he lives on
[1:40:31] your messenger can die but the message
[1:40:34] which is him lives on forevermore is the
[1:40:37] same yesterday today and forever
[1:40:41] [Music]
[1:40:45] remember when the third will come first
[1:40:49] first it came in the form of healing the
[1:40:51] sick
[1:40:53] second
[1:40:54] it came as rebuking the organizations
[1:40:58] by prophesying
[1:41:00] the word what they was what they were
[1:41:03] and what they were coming to
[1:41:06] right
[1:41:07] oh my what is what will come and what
[1:41:10] what was what is and what will come upon
[1:41:13] them
[1:41:14] but the third poll
[1:41:16] historical
[1:41:18] was when he preached to the eternal lost
[1:41:22] that could be saved no more
[1:41:26] even though they were hearing his word
[1:41:29] he in person was preaching to them this
[1:41:32] is not law
[1:41:34] this is the son of man himself
[1:41:36] preaching to them
[1:41:38] and they were eternally lost
[1:41:41] they couldn't hear his word
[1:41:43] amen
[1:41:46] hallelujah
[1:41:47] think of it in our day
[1:41:49] when i saw that them
[1:41:52] them women with them big
[1:41:54] painted eyes on
[1:41:56] amen
[1:41:58] going oh
[1:42:00] that vision of hell preaching to souls
[1:42:03] in hell
[1:42:05] souls that will not accept mercy
[1:42:08] souls that were eternally separated from
[1:42:11] the presence of god
[1:42:13] but yet
[1:42:14] it must be preached to them
[1:42:16] for they have to recognize it
[1:42:20] see
[1:42:21] what he was because god made him there
[1:42:24] you know what in other words
[1:42:26] they have to come to the judgment
[1:42:29] and god god can easily say didn't you
[1:42:31] hear
[1:42:32] you heard it
[1:42:34] you heard it he said but they
[1:42:36] must hear it
[1:42:38] so we got to preach it
[1:42:40] we don't just assume what all the people
[1:42:42] lost so we're not going to preach oh
[1:42:44] redemption over so we're not going to
[1:42:46] preach no we must preach the word for
[1:42:48] 120 years or more like noah
[1:42:52] even though it seemed hopeless even
[1:42:54] though it looks like it's all over amen
[1:42:56] we keep preaching the word oh
[1:42:59] unceasingly praise the name of the
[1:43:01] living god
[1:43:02] hallelujah
[1:43:04] amen but yet they must hear it so they
[1:43:08] can recognize what he is who he is and
[1:43:12] no wonder his ministry must come out in
[1:43:17] the same way in these last days
[1:43:21] as it was for as the father sends me so
[1:43:26] send are you
[1:43:27] and the words i do you shall do also
[1:43:30] amen the lost could never be saved
[1:43:35] those ones that reject this mercy
[1:43:39] that
[1:43:40] was
[1:43:41] his third pull
[1:43:44] this is our third book
[1:43:48] you believe that
[1:43:51] prisoners
[1:43:53] right now lots of people imprisoned now
[1:43:56] amen
[1:43:58] oh praise god watch
[1:44:00] noah i'm gonna i'm coming to winding up
[1:44:03] noah's ministry
[1:44:05] and let me say brother brahms speaking
[1:44:07] here seoul's imprisoned now
[1:44:09] noah's ministry
[1:44:11] he says in fact
[1:44:13] all ministries
[1:44:15] all ministries
[1:44:18] will do the same and done the same
[1:44:22] right
[1:44:23] he went in the ark
[1:44:25] he went into the ark and for seven years
[1:44:28] he kept preaching
[1:44:30] and nothing seemed to be happening
[1:44:34] the ministry seemed as if it had just
[1:44:37] settled down
[1:44:40] but his testimony was now being preached
[1:44:44] to the doomed
[1:44:48] sodom and gomorrah
[1:44:50] jesus referred to them
[1:44:53] before the coming of the son of man so
[1:44:56] shall it be like the days of noah
[1:44:59] so shall it be in like it was in the
[1:45:01] days of sodom
[1:45:02] he referred to noah
[1:45:05] why was he referring
[1:45:07] paragraph 285 same thing souls in prison
[1:45:11] remember
[1:45:13] noah
[1:45:14] already also had three poles
[1:45:19] and his third pull
[1:45:22] was preaching
[1:45:24] to the total loss
[1:45:27] after
[1:45:28] god shut the door
[1:45:32] amen it was no i'm not shutting out
[1:45:34] nobody
[1:45:35] it wasn't not putting anybody out the
[1:45:38] message of the church or oh
[1:45:40] god shut the door
[1:45:43] and when god shut him in he kept on
[1:45:46] preaching what he was always preaching
[1:45:49] he kept preaching the word it seemed
[1:45:50] ordinary it seemed like every other
[1:45:52] preacher preaching the same thing that
[1:45:53] might even sound like they're bridging
[1:45:55] it better amen but what what's what what
[1:45:59] it was
[1:46:01] see here
[1:46:03] now
[1:46:05] that
[1:46:07] as he
[1:46:08] after the door was shut
[1:46:10] and he kept printing
[1:46:12] gods let it set right there right in
[1:46:15] front of their eyes
[1:46:17] for them to see it and hear it
[1:46:20] but nobody could enter in no more
[1:46:25] or go out of it
[1:46:28] no more

[1:47:41] room the little room that he saw you get
[1:47:44] shut in with god there
[1:47:47] amen the word
[1:47:49] in the chamber
[1:47:51] speaking to his bride
[1:47:53] amen
[1:47:54] making his word known
[1:47:57] revealing his secrets
[1:47:59] all the personal things in his heart and
[1:48:02] in his mind that he wouldn't explain to
[1:48:04] nobody else
[1:48:06] explaining it to his bride
[1:48:08] from the lord hallelujah don't you

[1:48:20] it may be later than you think
[1:48:22] one of these days
[1:48:25] let me say as it says in revelation
[1:48:28] let him that is on the outside
[1:48:31] let him continue to stay outside
[1:48:35] and he that is on the inside
[1:48:38] let him forever
[1:48:40] be on the inside still
[1:48:43] for the door will close
[1:48:46] before you amen you know the scripture
[1:48:49] let him that is filthy be filthy still
[1:48:52] him this is this
[1:48:53] that is what he's in his mind while he's
[1:48:55] saying this i can see that he's saying
[1:48:58] let him that is on the outside let him
[1:49:00] stay outside still and him that is
[1:49:04] inside may he forever be on the inside
[1:49:08] still amen may i say that the same to
[1:49:11] every one of you and to myself i want to
[1:49:14] stay on the inside hallelujah of this
[1:49:17] revelation
[1:49:21] brother simon you're strange
[1:49:24] where's simon you're funny
[1:49:26] i don't understand you i'm not asking
[1:49:28] anybody to understand me
[1:49:31] i'm not asking for your admiration
[1:49:34] i'm not asking you for anything or i'm
[1:49:38] just wanting you to see
[1:49:40] what i'm pointing you to in this word in
[1:49:43] this message in this day and in this
[1:49:46] hour i thank god for this message and i
[1:49:49] want to point you straight to that for
[1:49:52] his glory and for his honor when god is
[1:49:55] silent
[1:49:56] we'd better be silent
[1:49:58] and this i'm going to wind this up at
[1:49:59] this point now let's we'll be silent
[1:50:02] amen
[1:50:04] where he has spoken
[1:50:06] then we must speak
[1:50:08] he told us the evidence of what would
[1:50:11] happen after being baptized with the
[1:50:14] holy ghost
[1:50:15] and what was that
[1:50:17] he said
[1:50:18] when
[1:50:19] you are truly baptized with the holy
[1:50:22] ghost
[1:50:23] you would have a teacher
[1:50:26] come
[1:50:27] to teach you
[1:50:29] all of the truth
[1:50:33] but that teacher
[1:50:36] would be just a man
[1:50:39] the teacher will be an inside teacher
[1:50:44] hallelujah
[1:50:46] it will not be an outside teacher
[1:50:50] even though god ordained fivefold
[1:50:52] ministry and all of that
[1:50:54] god will use them continue to use that
[1:50:57] but your teacher is that inside teacher
[1:51:01] not just the outside teacher
[1:51:04] but the spirit of the living god
[1:51:08] hallelujah for if the inside teacher
[1:51:12] that spirit of god
[1:51:13] isn't inside of you you would not be
[1:51:17] able to hear the truth and receive it by
[1:51:19] revelation amen you won't be able to
[1:51:23] hear it you won't be able to receive it
[1:51:25] if you heard it every moment of your
[1:51:27] life you will still not be able to hear
[1:51:31] it that was the sign of the indwelling
[1:51:35] spirit
[1:51:36] in the days of paul
[1:51:38] those who were filled with the holy
[1:51:40] ghost
[1:51:43] were able to really hear
[1:51:46] the word
[1:51:48] and receive the word
[1:51:51] then go out and live
[1:51:53] by the world
[1:51:56] those who did not have the spirit
[1:51:59] they heard the same thing
[1:52:02] but they heard it only as carnal men and
[1:52:07] women
[1:52:08] and then
[1:52:10] put a wrong interpretation on it
[1:52:15] and went into sin
[1:52:17] don't mean you're going to do something
[1:52:19] dirty but went into unbelief
[1:52:23] wrong interpretation don't mean you
[1:52:24] preach false doctrine you have a wrong
[1:52:27] understanding
[1:52:28] right and then
[1:52:31] now this happens he says
[1:52:33] in every age
[1:52:37] in every age
[1:52:39] amen for the holy ghost comes for the
[1:52:43] true believer
[1:52:45] in every age
[1:52:47] [Music]
[1:52:49] and in every age i say to you in every
[1:52:54] age this evidence remains the same
[1:53:00] those who had the spirit
[1:53:04] the teacher
[1:53:06] on the inside
[1:53:08] they're the ones
[1:53:10] they
[1:53:11] hear the word
[1:53:13] and that spirit in them
[1:53:16] took that word that they hear
[1:53:19] and begins to teach them it
[1:53:23] amen
[1:53:25] and then he used the word
[1:53:27] begins to reveal it
[1:53:30] to them
[1:53:32] hallelujah
[1:53:33] and there was that group
[1:53:37] that heard that really heard that
[1:53:40] messenger
[1:53:42] and
[1:53:43] the message
[1:53:45] that he was bringing
[1:53:47] and they took it
[1:53:50] and they went out and began to live it
[1:53:55] i'm i'm finished with that last quote
[1:53:58] you understand what i'm saying
[1:54:00] inside
[1:54:01] outside
[1:54:03] are you inside
[1:54:05] or are you outside
[1:54:06] let us search ourselves
[1:54:08] to see whether we be as paul said
[1:54:12] and i'm not no it's just coming up by
[1:54:14] the holy spirit
[1:54:16] he said paul said check yourself whether
[1:54:18] you'll be in the faith
[1:54:20] hallelujah praise god
[1:54:22] in the faith praise the lord so we are
[1:54:26] not here to put anybody out no

[1:56:33] pass that in front of you in the
[1:56:35] judgment
[1:56:37] and you ain't going to be able to open

[1:59:53] lofty something a word apostle means
[1:59:55] missionary
[1:59:57] is that right
[1:59:58] that's actually what it means it's a
[1:59:59] missionary a lot of people think there's
[2:00:02] no more apostles
[2:00:03] and only epistles
[2:00:06] but
[2:00:08] there's a lot of apostles still real
[2:00:11] ones not talking about the ones who make
[2:00:13] sure that they have to get the salary
[2:00:15] coming from headquarters before they go
[2:00:18] and then they're a
[2:00:21] registered missionary but i'm talking
[2:00:24] about missionaries real missionaries
[2:00:27] like our precious brother maddox
[2:00:31] that has just passed and gone beyond the
[2:00:33] veil
[2:00:35] gone into the presence of god

[2:01:17] entire family
[2:01:18] nobody promising him any money
[2:01:22] there was no promise of salary
[2:01:24] or anything
[2:01:26] that's what it means going by faith
[2:01:29] real faith not when oh i'm going by
