that um we can forget some of the things that we want to forget right amen there's a good side to everything you just need to find it yes praise God Amen and so this morning um I'm kind of excited about the word this morning um uh but at the same time you know uh just seeing everything that's been going on in the world we realize that the world is right now in great turmoil we see what's happening in Israel uh we could sit here and try and preach all kinds of messages around Israel and why this is happening and what you know how this is all we know is that uh God's Pro Prophet made it very clear that Israel is the focal point and the time piece for the world God started everything right there in the Middle East with a chosen people and um from there you know all we have to do is go back and read the scriptures and see how God dealt with Israel how God dealt with every one surrounding Israel it just seems to be that God has a a plan and we know that uh Israel going back into the Homeland was very significant is something that um we realized was prophetic according to the word of God it's not because you know uh we can you know we're Christians and we believe the word of God and we see Prophecy in the word and what God Said thousands of years before it actually happens then we see it happen and we know that that's God interpreting his own word we're not you know he says don't don't put your own interpretation lean not to your own understanding we could talk about all the details surrounding this whole event but God knows exactly what he's doing in allowing what's going on right now in Israel just in the same way that God is dealing right now with you that's what's important that's what stir my heart amen I can look and see oh the end is near and these things are happening in the world but you know how how's it going to affect my life where do I fit into this where do I see my part in the word of God Amen and how is it that um that I can fulfill my part my destiny and my purpose according to the word of God Amen because we all have one every single one of us praise God and that's what we're going to continue to look at in this series that we started on Wednesday it's all part of the rapturing faith series um that you know I believe that um there's there's a faith being released to the Sons and Daughters of God that's and all it's doing is making you more aware of who you are where you fit in the word and how it is that God is going to actually Rapture the church God is going to Rapture and remove his people from this Earth because the world is going into tribulation the evidence is right in the you just turn on the news right now and you'll see this world is in trouble amen and so we we know that this prophecy that was in the scripture that says the world's going to be going into Great Tribulation Jesus said like never before if if he says like never before then that means there's going to be things that we're going to see like we're seeing and witnessing right now of people being killed families being destroyed children being killed it's terrible it stirs and and and it should bring you to your knees to pray for these people and to pray that God will help them through it but they're they're in the prophecy they're in the prophecy and and we can't change that we can't change just like you couldn't change you're coming to this earth you being born into this country being born into this family having these types of characteristics around your life and so forth you couldn't you you you had nothing to do with that that was all part of God's plan for this Earth amen praise God and we need to understand that and that brings us to a balance when we can see the plan of God and recognize that this is all according to a plan that God had in his mind from before the foundations of the world and the suffering is is terrible and the joy is unspeakable it's a paradox Saints it's what it is is and we need to fall in step with the word that's where we can recognize our part and receive our inheritance and our blessing amen praise God so um let's read the the the scripture um our scripture will be the same one that we read on Wednesday evening I'm going to do a real Brief Review of Wednesday if you want to get it all you need to go back and just listen to it praise God I believe God laid in a foundation for us there on seeing yourself in the word today we're going to look at part two but let's read the scripture but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord let us pray father we so appreciate Lord your word and there's just so much that you will reveal and make known to each and every one of us through your word in that perfect time and season and Lord here we are we're living in a time of and season of Prophecy being fulfilled right around us Lord give us understanding give us Clarity of mind let the spirit of Revelation so move through the speaker and through the hearer here this morning and those that are out on on YouTube that are listening in uh live streaming father may your anointing move even now and Surround each and every one of us oh God that Lord that we can just catch your mind your thought your will your purpose for us here today so that we can leave encouraged strengthened and ready to meet the challenges that lay before us Grant it father we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you Saints you may be seated so Wednesday we looked at you know that that the the scripture when we're looking at the scripture we should be seeing ourselves we should be reading the word not only will you see Jesus Christ but in this hour and especially in this hour your calling is to be the bride of Christ the actual restored Church the restored Eve that fell back in the Garden of Eden we need to see you know you need to go back and and listen or read you know Christ The Mystery of God revealed you know brother brandham said that that that preaching that day he you know he felt like everything that he had uh been ministering on and all that he had been speaking about the Lord everything was all you know culminated right into that message and God was bringing such Clarity of who we are in the word of God God who Christ is what the mystery was that was back in the mind of God from before the foundations of the world we need to realize that God had a plan God is not just a nonchalant you know he's just going to let things be as they are no God could see the end from the beginning because he was eternal he's the alpha and he's the Omega he knew each and every one of us would come into this season in this time of the calling out of the eve the the the final restoration of the church that that Faith would come in this season that would literally change your mortal bodies that would literally change you from the person that you thought you were we're going to be looking at things here today that I I believe you know if if you just allow the Holy Spirit to um you know mirror his word back to you like you're looking into the mirror you're going to see through the character that we're going to be looking at here in the script scripture today you're going to see a portion of yourself a portion of your calling a portion of why God called you why he called you in this day in this hour the importance of it amen praise God and so when we look at the scripture when we study the word of God we should be seeing ourselves the more we study and we meditate on the word we pray we should see the glory of God and that the glory is actually your true reflection God is reflecting himself in you it was always Christ through every single age but this is the age where the bridegroom and the bride meet in the air for a great uh uh time of Fellowship for three and a half years the world goes into absolute chaos it's called the Great Tribulation this is the scripture this is what we've been uh given in this day and in this hour and this is what we we we will manifest in our Liv lives that's why you can't help it you you know you're out you're out there and you're mingling with the rest of the world and you're talking to other Christians I sit with ministers I sit with priests I hear them just talking about the word of God and denying the word of God and you know uh rejecting the word of God uh you know but what is it it's because it's been revealed unto you to know the things of God for this day and in this hour and you can't help it you can't help but see exactly what you're seeing you look in the word and the word speaks back to you and shows you who you are amen praise God and so this is what's called perfect Faith by Revelation seeing your part seeing who you are so that you can have confidence to stand and know that when you testify or give a testimony of Jesus Christ you know that you know it's not something that you're just you know you were brought up in a church and you you went to scho you know church on Sundays and your parents forc you to go to church and you know and even today people go to church by tradition they go because they think it's you know that that it's the right thing to do they but a real a real experience with Christ it changes all of that it makes Church a reality that it goes beyond your your human understanding and that's why when you fellowship with people that are just denominational and they just go to church by tradition and they believe their traditions instead of believing the word of God there's the difference you see you will always believe the word they will believe their tradition you tell them that babies being baptized is totally insignificant to God they'll tell you well no that's what my priest taught us that's what my parents did so that's what we do so that's a tradition Jesus when he was here on Earth he stood in front of all the priests of that day he was the word right there standing in front of them and and he told them clear he says Listen by your Traditions you've made the word of none effect to the people so now the people they'll just baptize their babies they'll do first communions they'll do it all because it's all part of their teaching all part of their you know their their their their books right but God has his own word God's his own interpreter God says I'm going to give you the Holy Ghost I'm going to place my spirit inside of you so that when you read the word you're going to know what is truth and and and that's why you know they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth praise God amen glory to God so you know as we Minister as US minister we Minister the word of God we read the quotes of brother brandham we're holding up a mirror and we're seeing if you can see yourself in that mirror some people will look at the quotes of brother brandham they'll look at his life and they'll look at it all and they will not see a reflection at all all the that's false that's not that's that's you're following a man you're this that because they can't it there's no reflection there's there's no representation in that in the word of God so unless your name is written in the book you won't reflect back to see truth you're going to you're going to see tradition you're going to see man's teachings you're going to see what what you've been taught and you're going to deny the actual word of God and Jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of Mary no Jus Jesus the Saints Jesus in the Saints you see it's all leading us back to the word praise God so today we're going to be looking at um let's go to the next scripture we're going to read from the book of Luke Chapter 5 from verse 5 to 11 and Simon answering said unto him Master we have toiled all night and have taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net and when they had done this they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break and they beckoned unto their Partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came came and filled both ships so that they began to sink when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus knees saying depart from me I am a sinful man oh Lord for he was astonished and all that were with him at the drought of the fishes which they had taken and so was also James and John and the sons of Zebedee which which were partners with Simon and Jesus said unto Simon fear not from henceforth Thou shalt catch men and when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all and followed him amen praise God today we're going to be taking a look at Jesus Calling Peter how Jesus you know how uh Peter was just a common man back in his day he just happened to be a fisherman but Peter was in God's plan Peter was written into the word of God Simon Peter was gonna have an intervention in his life he was going to meet Jesus who would tell him about himself amen praise God and so at this time I'd like the audio team to prepare we have a short clip that we're going to be watching it's just under 10 minutes I believe you will be very blessed by it and then we're going to talk about it and we're going to look at it and we're g to see what it is that the Lord is revealing to us through it they could just put the lights down we have audio right
