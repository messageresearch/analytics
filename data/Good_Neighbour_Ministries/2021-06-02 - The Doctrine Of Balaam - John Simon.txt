TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] hi it's wednesday night and it's great to be again here with you thanking god that i can speak to you from heavenly places in christ preaching from on board the good ship grace may the holy spirit give you the heart and mind to receive the word of god and be built up and to be made steadfast in christ as we go along this great journey from earth to glory preaching the word in this fashion which is not very much in the uh regular denominational or normal style expected but just plain food and as it was in the wilderness many may become tired of the manna which was just plain simple bread and water and that's all they had in their journey from earth to glory so that is why i'm expressing this don't become tired in eating the bread of life and drinking the refreshing waters flowing from the fountain of god praise god god has deliberately set it so and proving his word may the great holy spirit apply this text and this scripture to our hearts for where i ask it in the name of jesus christ our topic for tonight is the doctrine of balaam what did balaam teach the children of israel my friends that is what we want to speak about and our scripture is found in revelation chapter 2 verse 14 god speaking to the uh pergamos church age and warning them in these words but i have a few things against thee because thou has there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed onto idols and to commit fornication god bless the reading of his word gracious father into your hands we commit our spirit and we pray that you will now lord descend upon us tonight take glory and honor as we surrender all to jesus all to him lord god take us for your glory in jesus name we ask it amen the doctrine of balaam first of all my friends balaam was teaching the children of israel by not just by words only but by his actions as you know parents consciously and unconsciously teach their children by action and by talk or by teaching so was it with balaam by both word and by action every preacher the same thing by word by action and the bible tells us in our text quickly that balaam taught or balaam's teaching was taught king balak how to be a stumbling block how to get in the way and to block the churn of israel and secondly he taught them to eat things sacrificed onto idols and thirdly he taught them how to commit fornication now let us consider tonight the characteristics of balaamism the doctrine of balaamism and let us therefore see what lessons we can learn from observing balaam and his doctrine you can't have a nicolithian church without having balaamism mixed into it because the moment you take away the spirit of god and the word of god as a means of worship from amongst the people immediately balaamism sets in because you know worship real true worship is not just having a lot of spirit in the church or it's not having just a lot of bible teaching and truth in the church because jesus said there ought to be that balance the true worshipers will worship me in spirit and in the truth now you may have all the spirit you like signs wonders miracles healing all kinds of prosperity all kinds of shouting jumping hallelujahs praise god and everything else but you miss the truth of the doctrine of one god water baptism in jesus name serpent seed and so on you miss the messenger you miss the seven stars you miss the seven spears of god and the blasting of the seven thunders of the holy spirit and when you miss that it doesn't matter how much your church is spirited or a life or with music and drums and singing and famous singers and preachers coming in wonderful but if the truth is not there my friends you've missed it a myth is as good as a mile says the british and indeed it is oh friends think of it jesus i repeat said they that the true worshipers will worship me in spirit and then truth we have a lot of people worshiping in spirit then we have a lot of people even those that even some that believe this message have a lot of truth but they the moment you get emotional and begin to praise god and shout they want to brand you as a pentecostal not realizing that we ought to be worshipping in spirit and in the truth praise god we weren't called to be with truth only or with spirit only but when the spark the fire hits the gasoline room then you hear songs coming out of it and when the holy spirit comes upon the word oh my when the spirit quickens the word brother sister then it comes alive in the hearts and in the mind of every believer praise god and wherever there is no real true worship satan will of course insert or give you a substitute form or worship that may satisfy your flesh or a form of worship that is satisfactory to your mind in other words you'll make it so high that that those that are mentally inclined will cause them to feel sophisticated and to feel intellectual dignified with that form of worship because he has created that atmosphere and in the next realm if you love a lot of that emotional outburst and all of the moving of the spirit he'll let you have that too as long as you miss the truth so in other words if you are still teaching trinity doctrine if you're still teaching uh uh what a baptism in father son and holy ghost if you are teaching that eve at an apple if you are teaching that women can get in the pulpit and jump around and be preachers if you are still teaching things of that matter and i haven't gone down into all of that but to just show you if one is teaching all those things and missing the basic truth hero israel the lord thy god is one lord one god one god hallelujah and if they miss that it doesn't matter what else they're teaching they're off of the word of god and they have a substitute form of worship the bible calls it balaamism balaamism for they have a form of worship amen see but jesus is talking about true worship where the worshipers worship him in spirit and with revelation of the truth now if we're going to understand fully this doctrine of balaam it is understandable and obvious that we have to go back and look at the beginning of it all in the old testament then apply it to the third age this pergamos and then bring it down to our time this is what we need to do this story is found in numbers chapters 30 22 through 25 you may go and read it at your leisure praise god now we know israel were the chosen people of god in that day similar to when god actually chose and used the pentecostals for his purpose and for his glory for these people had taken refuge under the blood the shed blood of animals which was a type of christ hallelujah these were also having in a symbol what a baptism in the red sea amen and came out of the waters of the red sea singing shouting praising god hallelujah and giving him glory and the bible tells us that miriam moses sister picked up a tambourine and began to play it and begin to dance in the spirit and to sing and appraise the name of the living god hallelujah miriam the prophetess now make no mistake about this not miriam the preacher not miriam the missionary not miriam the deaconess not miriam of anything of that nature but miriam who was a woman that had a gift of prophecy and that's what she had in her life amen now my friends she praise god and give him glory for total deliverance and so ought we to give glory and praise to god for our total deliverance from that land of bondage into the freedom that we now enjoy in the lord and savior jesus christ well israel was on her journey and she came to the land of moab now moab if you uh should uh get some knowledge of who moab was moab was the son of lot he was the son of lot but listen to this by incest with one of his daughters so muab was a relative relative to israel who came of course from abraham so here we see two relations like you have the truth we have the revelation but yet there are many out there calling themselves by various christian names and we may be we are relatives but being relatives doesn't mean that you are right on with the truth of the word of god let me continue here now you must understand it's not that the moabites not that the denominationalists are ungodly or that they don't know the bible or they don't know the word but moab knew the word just as much as israel did they knew the word but that's one thing to know the word is another thing to have a revelation of that same word amen now my friends one know the word and live by the word but moab knew the word but did not live by the word having no clear revelation of it now israel and their journey came to the borders of the land of moab whose king was called balak and israel asked the moabites to allow them to pass through their country and go out of it on the other side and they would pay them for any drink or food or water that they had to use they would pay them for it but balak king of the moabites got all worked up and excited you see whenever there's a move of god uh these bishops superintendents whatever else they get very worked up because here is israel passing through their land with signs wonders and miracles with the pillar of fire the power of god the holy spirit revealing the word and his people are going to see that and compare it with what he has and he realized this is pretty risky to have people like that with joy in their hearts shining lights upon their faces and the joy the love of god within their being many of them healed saved delivered their lives changed forever never can be the same again but transformed by the power and the presence of almighty god hallelujah amen and he got uh he got worked up because it's kind of risky because if those people continue worshiping like that if they continue having god moving like that he might lose some membership he might lose some of his best people so that was a big risk for them to pass through so he absolutely refused even though he was a relative even though he was claiming the name of uh let me say the number nationalist claiming the name of christ and like balak they'll do everything in their power to obstruct whatever we are trying to do for the glory of god oh my and so he had a great fear of this little group of people amen hallelujah you look and see those great big organizations out there great big man out there giants out there but when they look at this little message group when they look at this thing called the message of the hour voice of god in his last days they shake and tremble up in their boots even though they would not outwardly publicly admit it but they know what they are hearing is thus saith the lord they know what they are hearing is the truth from the word of god from the many voices of the many ministers anointed with the holy spirit across the land across the world the earth is shaking god said i'll shake the heavens and i'll shake the earth one more time amen the holy spirit is riding true upon this word for this day for this time and in this hour brother sister and it's a big risk to them to just allow you to go on the way you're going so prepared because this the devil will use them to attack you in every possible way and who are they going to use how's the devil going to attack you the very way he attacked jesus he did not find bandits he did not find robbers by the roadside oh no but he found my friends he found preachers he had found anointed man he found men that are preaching the same bible from the bible that you were preaching from and they would surrender to him by hiring them preachers for hire we're living in this day where everybody is a preacher all of a sudden they get there they claim god called them oh all of a sudden the church called them all of a sudden the bishop called them their mother their father somebody called them or they have a desire a greed or lust for money and gold so they desire decide to become a preacher and it becomes like a more like a tradition or like some other form of work or job that they go to they study for it they they receive degrees for it they receive all kinds of accommodations for it and they believe that gives them their credibility and authority to preach the word of god when it is not so in the bible god said i'm the one who ordained you before the foundation of the world god ordained you god calls you god trains you god puts his spirit in you and uses you praise god hallelujah amen so moab went out to find a prophet he can hire i and this is a day where there's a lot of preachers for hire preach for pay preach for filthy luca preach for offerings that they can preach about prosperity about how you give them money they're not preaching about telling you how you can prosper and you can get money but they'll tell you that if you give them then you'll get money now my friends this kind of false doctrine and false prosperity teaching is absolutely against the word of god there is a genuine prosperity there is a genuine success there's a genuine blessing as god told joshua i will give you good success you see there's the true and the false oh my that's not my subject today but they hired a prophet just like they can hire them today you can hire uh experts to give witness in the court telling lies one will tell say this and the other one is an expert also and he'll be totally opposite you you can hire scientists one will tell you this the other that hire lawyers one will tell you this you have to tell you depending on how you pay them and if you paid enough they'll say anything you want oh my god have mercy but a real man of god i don't care they'll eat dry bread they'll walk my friends if it's necessary with rags they'll do with nothing all they want is so oh honor their master of their lord and to preach the truth from the word of god even it will skin the height off of you amen if they have to pull every feather out to your nest and pick you clean as a christmas turkey oh praise god now preach that word and clean up your life if you're willing and ready to accept the word of god for your day and for your time amen hallelujah and so he tempted balaam and bought him out or hired him he hired him one with money and secondly he tempted and hired him with the the temptation of honor that you're going to get glory you're going to be the man that did this or did that and i can connect you to such and such powerful person in the political realms oh and that that uh my friends encourage balaam to a condition of pride where he would be able to realize he can be a big man a great man a man of renown and his names would be on the paper he'll be in the spotlight and he'll be able to pray with the with the president he'll be able to go and speak to the minister of this or the minister of that oh my friend and so that great lust was upon him to take part in political affairs and become a great person oh my friends hallelujah amen he wanted to he wanted balaam to go and curse the church of israel but balaam realized that he couldn't crush them himself he had to have god do it so therefore he had to go pray to get god's permission to be able to do it all my friends just like a lot of the balance and the nike legends we have today they still got to go back to god amen they want to curse everyone that won't go on their way or believe their way or see things the way they see it if you are different or you differ from them they're so angry with you they're ready to curse you they're ready to call you all mandarin names and everything else but my friends that's when you call to god's unchanging hand amen hold to him who will not leave you praise god amen he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you oh praise god amen so balaam asked god's permission to go amen just think of just the thought of asking god's permission to go and pray a prayer to put a curse on somebody that is not even in the scripture and here it is my friends balaam prayed for god's permission to go curse israel and god turned him down what else did he expect but you know what he had the lust for gold and money and glory and he kept coming back and coming back and bothering god and coming back to god and so all at once god had enough of it and he said okay balaam even if i tell you i told you already don't go the first time should have been enough i told you don't go but it's in your heart to go so i'm not going to stop you it's still in your heart to go down there and to do that so go ahead go ahead do it and that saw all his crookedness all of his perversity and perversion and told him he can go and ride away balaam saddle up his donkey oh praise god here is the prophet now excited i i got permission from god to go but what he did not realize is that he had only god's permissive will that wasn't god's perfect will god just said oh since you're doing that you're coming back i already told you no it's in the word telling you no and the bible tells you no but yet you're coming back to me and asking because you want me to answer according to your desire in your heart so if you're desiring your heart you think is greater than i am go ahead follow the desire of your heart and that's what god allow him to walk in his permissive will now you remember paul speaking of the good will of god amen he speaks about the perfect or again the acceptable will of god and then the perfect will of god these like the tree wills of god three stages of god's will you may be looking good to your eyes but it's not god's will no there again ah oh it this thing may be perfect everybody else may say this is perfect this is beautiful oh a million people's opinions can't be wrong but my friends we don't live by people's opinions we live by the word of god the voice of god the acceptable will god's perfect will to walk in the perfect will perfect word and the revelation of this day and so quickly balaam saddled his donkey and began to ride that donkey away to go to fulfill his work that bedham had asked him to do that's like a lot of of these preachers a lot of these superintendents they ride on the backs of their membership write them to accomplish their goals even if balaam had gone back to god 20 times more god would still tell him no but he wanted to go anyway so god says okay go ahead and balaam is very much like a lot of people a day the bible tells you clearly there is one god oh but my church teaches tree but i believe in this holy blessed trinity you can bless it all you want you can bless blessed trinity holy trinity immaculate trinity whatever you want to call it but the word of god says there is only one god and his name is jehovah in the old testament which is the same jesus christ of the new testament the name jesus actually means jehovah who has become our savior that jehovah of the old testament came and died upon calvary's cross physically that he might become our savior praise be to god hallelujah you tell them and show them from the word of god and it doesn't take even a revelation to clearly see from the bible that baptism ought not to be in the titles of the person but in the name of the person the name of the person who is father son and holy spirit and the name of that person who is father son and holy spirit the same person not three persons when peter who is considered to be the first pope was us which we know he was never a pope but he was asked in acts chapter 2 verse 38 men and brethren what shall we do to be saved repent be baptized in what name he knew the name of that person who is father son and holy ghost in the name of the lord jesus christ hallelujah and again 4 12 he says for there is no other name given unto heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of jesus christ i believe he knew what he was speaking of because his words words have stood the test of time and they are inscribed in our bible here it is my friends god telling us clearly there are people with the spirit of balaam and the teaching of balaam in our day and in our time still holding to truths or scriptures or thoughts that are not in not in the taught by the word of god but taught by the spirit of balaam the oh my holding to trinitarian doctrines holding to water baptisms and titles my friends amen and god would still send his spirit upon them just like he did upon balaam they don't realize the scripture tells us in romans for god so loved the world he sends his reign on the just and on the unjust on the weed and on the width the range is false god is impartial but the seed will reveal what the plant really is the nature of that plant will be exposed by the falling of the rain upon that life here it is they're perfect belamites today that i have taken in and are taking in the doctrine of balaam amen oh my you tell them about it they don't want to hear go ahead go ahead believe that way if you want to believe that way you'll see the end of it amen and many of them will be saying oh god is blessing us look at us look at our church look at our this look at all of that look at our bible schools look at our seminaries look at our cathedral god is blessing us amen amen see that's how they look at it it must be all right if god is blessing us amen and sometimes you will have to say to them i know god bless you i don't deny it but it's the same organizational root that balaam took that many are choosing to take that same organizational rule my friends that route was open to me open to me by the assemblies of god open to me by the seventh day adventist i was invited by the ame zion invited by look i won't name all of them numbers of them the methodists my mother's uh cousin and was the bishop of the uh methodist church and just wanted me to go in that light but it doesn't go by that doesn't go by men taking positions offering you parishes with five six churches you're going to be over this great big area and whatever no you are all you ready to surrender your life to jesus christ hallelujah and let him take divine control amen and so i have and so you should and everyone should do that the same way amen praise god balaam what my friends the pathway that balaam took was in defiance to god's word because he was knowingly preaching and promoting false teaching for profit and for pay oh god have mercy isn't that the same thing being repeated in this day and in this hour amen so here comes balaam riding wildly down the road oh my riding on his donkey riding on that church member their support is riding on them because remember their support and so he's riding on that until the angel stood in his way oh my and my friends in our day another angel has come another messenger from god has come and the messenger and the messenger won and when they come in contact with this message that's the angel with the sharp shining sword waiting for them to make their decision life or death christ or chaos amen or jesus or judgment my god and judgment begins at the house of god judgment begins with your attitude to the word of god and promise of god for this age and for this time and so that prophet that preacher that bishop that overseer oh friend there it is that president that chairman of the presbyters oh that general over shepherd all all of that they were so blinded by spiritual things and by their all the spiritual teachings they had and by their thought of human glory gold and honor that they lost sight of the truth of the word of the living god money the mighty dollar was right in front their eyes they could not even see the messenger standing in front of them to arrest them they could not see the angel standing before them oh but even though they did not see it the members of their church see it oh my i tell you the members of that church see the word and they recognize the word and they swerve this way and they swerve that way and the next thing you know uh uh balaam's leg got squashed against a rock he got mad at the donkey and began to beat the donkey and everything else and that that god that donkey was no hybrid the donkey was my friend a pure bread donkey amen he said what do you mean brother simon well a mule is a mixture of across with horse and donkey but a donkey is a created thing that has been original through all the ages anything that is hybrid can not reproduce itself amen but the original seed can wrap your truce itself and saw a donkey is redeemable amen but the mew can't be redeemed oh we'll talk about that another time but here a simple member of the church could see the word and the overseer the bishop the preacher the prostate the president whatever the chairman can't see the word of god miss the truth of god's word that he might attain gold and glory and receive the honors of this world so the donkey asked balaam didn't i carry you faithfully for so many years and now you're beating me and you want to kill me and everything else my god a talking donkey god anoint the donkey to talk and sometimes god anoint the member with the word that the blinded priest and preacher and president could not see to tell him what the word is and here the donkey showed him that man that's the that's the messenger of the age that's the 20th century prophet you're calling his name as if it's a curse word but that's not a curse word that's the messenger of this age that's the voice of god speaking through him to these last days and the donkey had more sense than balaam had he called the donkey an ass but in actual fact he was the one making the ass options the assumptions and the presumptions he was the one that was off the word and the donkey was on the word of the living god my friends god speaking through a donkey and god has always spoken in tongues to people and and they don't hardly understand remember at belches feast many many take care of your person god speaking in tongues and there again my friends god at pentecost spoken tongues god of jesus spoke in towns but it's not the way many of them think it's a sign of judgment judgments is fixed into strike amen you're found wanting your way in the balances you found wanting oh my god think about it amen yes sir here it is the warning of oncoming judgment and then the angel was made visible to balaam and said balaam except for that donkey warning you you would have been a dead man now you turn right around and go back where you come from and back there you go back and admonish them to lay off the children of israel okay balaam went back but you know what happened balak came and offering even more money bigger than the amount he had before oh my the money was so big he couldn't see pass it it blocked his vision it blinded him he couldn't see where he was going oh the new car the new house they knew this oh everything else it blinded him the honors oh the great prayer at this great place he has to go to he has this engagement that engagement no time to pray rather than to pray he seeks his pillow rather than to my friends have uh you know agony in the presence of god he wants to argue with the people of god but god wants true men and women of god that will stand by the truth until the crown again will stand and hold to god's unchanging hand so balaam went up and he set up seven altars that shows he knew something about the truth seven number of perfection and offered up clean beasts a sacrifice and even kill the ram which shows he had knowledge of a coming messiah a sign of the coming lamb of god that would die for the sins of the world amen he knew how to approach god he actually had that he had all the mechanics right he could quote all the scripture tell you the chapter the verse the year the history the archaeology and so on he knew it back in front but he had not the revelation the dynamics of the holy spirit coming upon that word to make the word life once again amen but there was israel done in the valley offering praises to god and sacrifices to god doing the very same thing and blessing the name of the living god amen or praise god brother sister the same thing that happened at nicaea it's happening again there put over balaam's doctrine then and nicoletianism them and they're doing the same thing once again not the doctrine of god not the doctrine of the truth but of nicolasianism and balaamism and there the church has stumbled and has fallen from when she came and they're all becoming like dead men oh my think of it brother sister balaam was ready to prophesy once again but god tied up his tongue he ended up with tight towns god just tied it up that he could not curse israel amen instead of cursing them he find himself prophesying a star would rise out of jesse amen and he bless israel instead of cursing israel i want to tell you when god has blessed you none can curse you when god has delivered you none can put a spell and curse upon you none can put voodoo on you none could bring anything against you because god has blessed you and brought you out of the mary clay brought you from darkness into light brought you from bondage into freedom into the glorious manifestation of the sons and daughters of the living god hallelujah and saw my friends he began to look upon israel balak said no no balaam go down amongst the israelites and spy out if they got any faults weaknesses amongst them if they any of them in there make any mistakes you see that's what the devil loves because not like we're not going to make mistakes as you become he's still human and we're going to make mistakes but jesus christ that if you sin he says i provided a blood that you can corrupt confess and be cleansed and wash from your sins but they're gonna still look for your faults and you know what they're gonna do spread it everywhere and they'll talk about that and they'll spread it everywhere they can that's the tactics that the devil always loves to use but i want you to know friends that even though the devil uses scandal even though he uses lies even though he uses rumors to blackball you put put you down give your black name a bad name see all manner of evil against you amen i tell you friends they don't understand that in spite of your mistakes and you impart your imperfections your back parts in other words god is not looking upon that because he knows a true child would repent a true child would ask for forgiveness but god has offered them his grace and his goodness so in spite even the nation of israel in our day people look at them and say oh they've done this they've done that they made this mistake they made that mistake and maybe they have but they do not understand god is not looking at the mistakes he is looking at his word that must be fulfilled and must come to pass amen and that god works not by works but he moves through grace not by the works of righteousness which we have done but by his grace and mercy he has called us to attention by his word thank god while they were cursing israel and speaking against israel as i'm winding up this talk they failed to recognize that israel had the pillar the pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night and they had a smitten rock gushing out fresh messages fresh water fresh revelation to their hearts every night every day god was pouring forth there was an never-ending stream from the ever-present water flowing out of that rock they also had the brazen serpent amongst them that if they got sick if their bodies were in pain if their minds were depressed oppressed depressed they could come to god and ask him to set them free and to deliver them from the poisons of the mind and spirit to cast out resentment from them cast out my friend hatred from them strife from them the bitterness of hatred and strength all those poisons of the heart and mind that god was with them and the brazen serpent the type of christ raised upon the cross can deliver you for his by his trips we are healed he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes you are now healed in the name of jesus christ he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities surely he bore all our sorrows and by his stripes we are healed oh thank god my friends i believe i'm healed from the top of my head to the tip of my toes i believe i'm whole amen every part of my being is made whole in the name of jesus christ only believe all things are possible you say but brother simon i feel this i feel that oh brother simon the doctor said this and the doctor said i don't care what the doctor said the prophet said you'll believe the true report hallelujah to the lamb oh praise god don't just believe the doctor's report amen oh praise god oh i feel the pain i feel this growth i feel that oh i feel the pulsation i feel the heat of the fever oh but god's word says despite that you say i'm healed in jesus name and i'm gonna close with this story there was a man that was prayed for by brother he was blind stone blind by brother branham and one year later he came back and said brother branham my eyes aren't open i'm not healed brother branham said no brother don't say that you are healed god has his own time with everything he does go back to your home and believe god that you are healed for this god's servant i'm telling you that you are healed and i'm here to tonight telling you all whoever you are wherever you are around the world you are healed you are whole only believe all things are possible that man returned back to his home and three months four months six months passed after that that's a year and six months passed after that and and he still can't see and he kept going around telling people he's healed and they started mocking him uh laughing him he goes to the barber shop and put on the barber's thing over him here and uh and barbara started shaving him foam on his on his beard and started to shave him and said john you should stop this thing saying you're healed how are you going to heal saying you're healed and i'm looking at you and i can see you're blind you can't see he says you don't understand i am healed never mind what you are seeing doesn't matter how i'm feeling god's word says i'm healed and you know what that time in that barber's chair when he said i'm healed all of a sudden his eyes popped open that man ran out of that barbershop with all the form around his his mouth running around in the streets with his hands upright shouting i'm healed i'm healed i'm healed i'm whole oh praise god hallelujah praising god i trust god tonight that many of you will accept the truth of god's word and go from this place taking the name of jesus with you healed saved delivered if you're not baptized baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and giving him glory and honor for great things he had done god bless you my friends i'll see you again bright sunny shining sunday morning to preach the word of god without faith or faith fame or favor without any restrictions but bringing the fullness of the word of god let us come and draw waters from the well of salvation and give glory and honor to him who has to be praised not one forevermore god bless you all [Music] you
