[0:04] [Music]
[0:17] good evening friends
[0:19] i'm happy to be here tonight
[0:23] to share with you the word of god
[0:26] we thank god for sending to us
[0:30] his bread of life may the lord bless you
[0:35] as we engage ourselves
[0:39] in another marvelous
[0:42] lesson in the seven church
[0:46] ages we shall read
[0:49] from ephesians chapter one
[0:53] verse one then we will
[0:57] begin to enter into our study which will
[1:00] be entitled
[1:02] understanding the seven
[1:05] church ages understanding
[1:09] this seven church ages
[1:12] may god bless us all gracious
[1:16] heavenly father may your blessings
[1:20] rest upon us most of all
[1:24] may you move across the face of the deep
[1:28] may the great holy spirit anoint
[1:32] hearts and minds may you apply
[1:36] the word where it needs to be applied
[1:40] and change lines where they need to be
[1:44] changed
[1:45] most of all open up our understanding
[1:49] father
[1:50] and when this season of time
[1:54] is over may you receive all the
[1:58] praise the honor and glory for
[2:01] thine is the kingdom father
[2:04] god bless and anoint
[2:07] as we now proceed in your name amen
[2:14] ephesians 1 verse
[2:17] 1 paul
[2:20] an apostle of jesus christ
[2:24] by the will of god to the saints
[2:29] which are at ephesus
[2:33] and to the faithful in jesus christ
[2:37] verse 2 grace be to you
[2:42] and peace from god our father
[2:46] and from the lord jesus christ
[2:51] amen now so
[2:54] we want to come to a place
[2:58] of a clear understanding
[3:03] of these seven church ages
[3:07] now to fully understand the message of
[3:11] god
[3:11] to these ages we must
[3:14] first of all understand certain
[3:17] principles
[3:18] that god gives to us
[3:21] and we must also uh
[3:25] arrive to a place where we can
[3:28] recognize the names of the messengers
[3:33] okay so that's important we must also
[3:37] be able to understand the lengths
[3:41] of the age or ages
[3:44] and discuss other factors
[3:49] that may uh overlap
[3:52] along with these ages
[3:56] now we know this is a serious study this
[4:00] is a a serious
[4:04] study in which we ought to approach it
[4:07] reverently
[4:08] and not because we may be in our homes
[4:12] and relaxed in our domiciles
[4:15] that we ought to take the word for
[4:18] granted
[4:19] but the word of god is sincere
[4:23] and we ought to accept it soberly
[4:27] our minds and hearts receive the word of
[4:31] god and be
[4:32] blessed by the word of god
[4:35] hallelujah now to understand
[4:39] uh or to come to the understanding of
[4:42] these seven church ages
[4:44] we must clearly uh
[4:48] be in a uh an atmosphere
[4:51] of prayer we must
[4:54] allow ourselves to be in this
[4:57] atmosphere of prayer
[5:00] prayer for what asking god to grant you
[5:04] his wisdom his understanding
[5:08] and that he as he has promised
[5:11] that if we any man lacks understanding
[5:15] lacks wisdom and let him ask of god
[5:18] who giveth liberally god will
[5:22] give you liberally ever present
[5:25] water from the rock and you will
[5:29] thirst no more but you will
[5:32] want to follow that rock
[5:35] revelation on foundational
[5:38] truths of the word of god wherever
[5:41] the word of god and the spirit of god
[5:45] leads you amen
[5:48] the next thing we must do
[5:52] is to study the word
[5:56] as i've often said to you read your
[5:58] bible even if it's
[6:00] five minutes a day read your
[6:03] bible read your bible pray
[6:06] every day pray every day pray
[6:10] every day read your bible
[6:13] pray every day if you follow
[6:16] me if you want to follow the lord jesus
[6:19] christ
[6:21] read your bible and pray
[6:24] every day also
[6:27] take time if you can find
[6:31] anywhere a book on a church histories
[6:36] then read from it study it go to the
[6:39] library find
[6:41] it go to the some christian bookstore
[6:45] and you'll be able to find uh something
[6:47] like that
[6:48] on christian history or you can check
[6:52] out the encyclopedia britannica
[6:54] or other sources where you may be able
[6:57] to
[6:59] confirm that the things i am saying to
[7:03] you
[7:03] are true and they are
[7:06] true not only by the
[7:09] rebel quoting of the scripture and
[7:12] of the word of god but there are also
[7:15] true in normal human
[7:19] uh history compiled by men of course
[7:23] to show the journey of the human race
[7:27] and in there you will find also
[7:30] some wonderful uh gems and jewels
[7:34] of the understanding so
[7:37] you must study some history
[7:41] also it will be helpful to you uh
[7:44] don't just uh confine yourself in
[7:47] oh i'm just going to read my bible i
[7:49] don't want to read any other book i
[7:51] don't want to know anything else
[7:52] no you you need to expand
[7:56] because if you read paul you'll hear
[7:58] paul said
[7:59] well did the christians poets
[8:02] say and he'll quote them or
[8:05] well did the greeks say and he'll quote
[8:09] them
[8:10] it means a solomon said a wise man
[8:14] a wise man gets himself involved with
[8:17] all manner of knowledge so that out of
[8:20] his treasures new and old
[8:22] he may bring forth the truths and lights
[8:25] of god
[8:26] for the glory of god amen so you should
[8:30] study some history
[8:32] and also you should
[8:35] understand certain fundamental
[8:38] principles
[8:39] that are within the word of god
[8:43] and i'm going to deal there but there
[8:46] are four
[8:48] main principles in studying these
[8:51] seven church ages
[8:54] that i would like for you to pay
[8:57] particular
[8:58] attention to for tonight
[9:01] i will deal or attempt to deal with
[9:05] two of those principles the first one
[9:09] being principle one is that
[9:12] our god is unchanging
[9:16] i believe it my god that i serve
[9:20] is unchanging and that
[9:23] is a key principle
[9:26] or actually one or the keystone
[9:30] to understanding not only the seven
[9:33] chord changes
[9:34] it'll help you to understand the seven
[9:36] messengers
[9:37] it will help you to understand the
[9:39] entire
[9:40] bible if you can
[9:44] grasp this truth not just i'm saying it
[9:48] you are hearing it it's english
[9:51] your natural mind understand that when i
[9:54] say
[9:54] god is unchanging but i'm saying
[9:58] ask god by his spirit to give you
[10:01] a deeper understanding and a revelation
[10:04] that you may fully grasp and
[10:08] come to a spiritual realization
[10:11] of what it means to
[10:15] say and believe and understand
[10:19] that our god is unchanging
[10:23] this is a keystone truth and principle
[10:28] of the bible now i use the word keystone
[10:32] now you say well brother simon what is
[10:35] a keystone now i've been to rome several
[10:38] times and while in rome
[10:40] i i visit some of those ancient
[10:43] arches beautiful of built
[10:46] by the romans and what beautiful
[10:49] a work of construction to this day
[10:53] the children their children are masters
[10:56] of storm work
[10:58] and tile work and things of that nature
[11:01] gifted but a keystone my friends
[11:05] on those bridges across the rivers
[11:09] they're they're they're built like a
[11:12] arch and in the middle
[11:15] of that if you were to now take note and
[11:19] go look
[11:20] you'll see that there is a stone that
[11:23] has a
[11:24] pyramid shape it starts like that comes
[11:28] down
[11:29] and of course across and
[11:33] the bricks lay beside it and it's the
[11:36] keystone
[11:38] that holds all the other
[11:41] bricks in their places
[11:44] so what is this truth telling us
[11:48] that this one truth is
[11:51] the keystone of the bible that our
[11:54] god never changes
[11:57] and by this truth all the other things
[12:00] hold together and consist
[12:04] as one and you will find if you if you
[12:08] see this truth and hold to this truth
[12:11] you'll see a consistency
[12:13] of truth of revelation inspiration
[12:17] that goes through the entire bible
[12:20] like a river of life whose trains make
[12:24] glad the city of god
[12:26] yes sirs here it is our god is
[12:30] unchanging
[12:31] and that is indeed the revelation of
[12:34] hebrews
[12:35] 13 8 jesus christ
[12:39] the same yesterday today
[12:43] and forever he is
[12:47] unchanging in his ways
[12:51] and this scripture tells us he is on
[12:54] unchanging in his person on changing in
[12:58] his ways
[12:59] and on changing in his persons
[13:02] now if we read from ecclesiastes
[13:05] chapter 3 verses 14
[13:08] to 15 i know
[13:13] that whatsoever god doeth
[13:16] it shall be forever
[13:21] nothing can be put to it
[13:25] nor anything taken
[13:28] from it and god do it
[13:34] and men should fear before him
[13:37] now just place in your mind along with
[13:40] that revelation chapter
[13:42] 19 and 20 where the bible says you
[13:44] should not add to this book
[13:46] you shall not take away hearing
[13:48] ecclesiastes
[13:49] you are seeing the same truth here that
[13:52] whatsoever god do it
[13:54] is forever nothing can be put to
[13:57] it and nothing can be taken away from it
[14:02] for god with it and men should fear
[14:06] before him that which had been
[14:09] is now and that which
[14:12] is to be had already been
[14:16] and god required that
[14:20] which is past so god
[14:23] we are unhappy and serving an unchanging
[14:26] god
[14:26] who has unchanging ways
[14:30] hallelujah glory to god i'm happy that
[14:33] heaven and earth will pass away
[14:36] but as the bible says my words shall
[14:39] never ever pass away unchanging god
[14:43] on changing ways on changing word
[14:46] we realize that god's word will never
[14:50] change and if god ever
[14:54] does anything one time then
[14:57] god my friends the first time it will
[15:00] have to keep doing the same thing
[15:03] over and over again that is why history
[15:06] has cycles
[15:07] now he has to do that over and over
[15:10] again
[15:11] because he is perfection of perfection
[15:13] of perfection
[15:14] and his first decision or his first
[15:18] act is a perfect act that cannot
[15:21] be improved upon yes sir and that's the
[15:25] kind of god
[15:26] that we are serving so let's apply
[15:30] this truth to the church ages finding
[15:33] that
[15:34] what god did in the very first church
[15:37] age
[15:38] he cannot change from that that
[15:41] has to be what he has to repeat
[15:44] down through the other ages
[15:48] what he did see he has to repeat
[15:51] doing it so praise god so it's in your
[15:54] bible
[15:55] it's in the book of acts thank god
[15:58] the holy spirit allowed it to be
[16:01] recorded
[16:02] in the book of acts there that how
[16:05] the first original church was founded
[16:10] and how god manifested himself
[16:13] through that church remember god's
[16:16] principles of his word
[16:18] are unchanging and we see in the book of
[16:21] acts how the first church was founded
[16:24] we see how god was manifesting
[16:27] himself through that church
[16:31] and the word of god cannot change
[16:35] or be changed for it is the word
[16:39] of god no man no institution
[16:43] none can come along and
[16:46] improve upon or ordain
[16:49] or suggest that they will improve
[16:52] upon the word of god
[16:56] that is not what i read in my bible for
[16:59] you shall not add you shall
[17:01] not take away from the word of god for
[17:04] the word of god
[17:06] is unchanging for it says in john
[17:08] chapter 1
[17:10] in the beginning was the word
[17:14] and the word was with
[17:17] god and the word was
[17:21] god and god amen
[17:24] is unchanging hallelujah
[17:28] and the moment we change one word of god
[17:32] just like eve did in the garden
[17:35] then we bring sin death trial
[17:38] tribulation
[17:39] upon our lives so the word of god
[17:43] is to be uh what he has left it at and
[17:47] not to be meddled and mingled manhandled
[17:51] uh by any geological wisdom or knowledge
[17:54] of man
[17:56] any presumptions of man or
[17:59] any assumptions by man none of that
[18:03] we are to leave the word of god alone
[18:06] for god is his own interpreter
[18:10] and he will make it plain
[18:13] for he will make it known to you
[18:17] and any other what it is time for you
[18:20] to know when it is time for you to
[18:23] understand
[18:24] when it is time for you to catch the
[18:26] revelation
[18:27] then in the fullness god sends forth his
[18:31] son
[18:31] the light of god upon your heart your
[18:34] mind
[18:35] and upon your life amen hallelujah
[18:38] now we then understand through this
[18:41] principle
[18:43] that the church that god birthed
[18:46] at pentecost acts chapter 2
[18:50] amen the entire book of acts my friends
[18:54] is the pattern it's the original pattern
[18:58] and it is the pattern that we can not
[19:02] should not and must not change
[19:05] for we must not uh my friends
[19:08] mess around with god's word we can't
[19:11] deform the word of god
[19:13] yes sir we need to leave god's word
[19:17] as it is god has a wisdom in the way he
[19:20] has placed
[19:21] every single word conjunction
[19:25] everything within the bible
[19:28] and no matter what
[19:31] scholars may tell you that
[19:34] is the pattern and we are not to change
[19:38] god's pattern for what god did at
[19:41] pentecost
[19:43] he has to keep on doing until the church
[19:47] ages
[19:48] are over now scholars may tell you well
[19:52] we know the days of the apostles
[19:55] as glorious as the days of the apostles
[19:58] were
[19:59] it's now history it's now uh
[20:02] it's now epistles it's not beautiful
[20:05] literature
[20:07] it's good for us to study and develop a
[20:10] clerical
[20:11] uh uh you know a profession uh
[20:14] of clergy through this matter for it's
[20:18] now the days of the apostles are
[20:20] over oh friends i beg to differ
[20:25] because that is wrong particularly
[20:28] on two counts first of all it's wrong to
[20:31] suppose
[20:32] that there aren't any more apostles
[20:35] for the one apostle the word apostle
[20:38] means
[20:39] set one one that is sent
[20:42] and that will be equivalent to us in our
[20:46] day using the word a
[20:48] missionary that's what paul was
[20:51] now we use the word lightly sent i'm not
[20:54] going to go into that
[20:55] it doesn't just mean anyone that is sent
[20:58] out from a church makes
[21:00] that person an apostle but one sent
[21:03] by the hand of almighty god is a genuine
[21:07] god santa boss not a church sent one
[21:10] not a not a mother that sends out her
[21:13] son
[21:14] but god our heavenly father that anoints
[21:18] that empowers and sends forth his son
[21:21] when paul said that what the lord
[21:25] showed to me first corinthians chapter
[21:28] 11
[21:29] as it was revealed to me by the lord
[21:32] jesus
[21:33] that on the same night he was betrayed
[21:37] amen and then he tells all that was said
[21:41] in that room when they had the last
[21:43] supper
[21:44] not being there he wasn't told it by
[21:47] peter by paul
[21:48] by any of james or any of the other
[21:52] apostles of that day but he said
[21:54] revealed to me by the lord jesus
[21:56] himself it's not that he had a different
[21:59] revelation
[22:00] but god gave him a little more
[22:02] understanding
[22:04] on the original word so that he could
[22:07] put it
[22:07] forth so that they said well brother
[22:10] brother uh peter uh brother paul you're
[22:13] saying some things that uh uh
[22:15] you know it's it's it's so dark deep
[22:18] that
[22:18] even i can hardly understand but god has
[22:21] given each one of us a different kind of
[22:24] ministry
[22:25] he gives us a different kind of as much
[22:28] as we have different personalities
[22:31] he gives us a different kind of ministry
[22:34] and so here it is that pattern cannot be
[22:37] changed and there are still apostles
[22:40] here upon earth do you believe that
[22:44] do you believe god still has apostles i
[22:47] believe it
[22:48] god sent once anointed
[22:51] men by the holy spirit that
[22:54] need no recognition that
[22:57] need no recommendation but
[23:00] because they have the vindication of the
[23:04] god of heaven o praises holy
[23:08] blessed name may his name be praised and
[23:11] lifted up forever oh praise god
[23:14] hallelujah amen yes sir my friends
[23:18] the bible tells us that as long as
[23:22] god is calling men to ministry
[23:26] uh calling men and sending men by the
[23:29] holy spirit
[23:30] then the days of the apostles or the
[23:34] apostolic age is
[23:36] not over if the age of
[23:39] manifested holy ghost power
[23:42] is not over praise god
[23:46] acts chapter 2 verse 38 to
[23:49] certainly then peter said unto them
[23:53] repent and be baptized
[23:57] every one of you in the name of jesus
[24:00] christ
[24:01] for the remission of your sins
[24:04] and you shall receive the gift
[24:08] of the holy ghost for the promise
[24:12] is unto you those that were right in
[24:15] front of him
[24:16] and to your children and to
[24:20] all that are far off
[24:23] as many as the lord
[24:27] our god shall call
[24:30] as many is god still calling
[24:33] as long as god is still calling
[24:37] this promise is unto you
[24:40] and the age of the apostolic
[24:43] age is not over and
[24:46] can not cease until we are called
[24:50] out of here it will not end it will
[24:53] not cease until god stops calling
[24:56] the pentecostal message
[25:00] vindicated by pentecostal power
[25:03] shall never cease and i'm not talking
[25:06] about
[25:07] the modern day pentecost i'm talking
[25:09] about
[25:10] the holy ghost bible pentecost
[25:13] the original pentecost restored
[25:16] back by the power and presence of god
[25:20] upon his sons and his daughters his
[25:23] chosen
[25:23] ones his hidden ones his elected ones
[25:27] his little flock
[25:28] his bright class of saints his church of
[25:31] the living god
[25:32] the assembly of the firstborn all
[25:35] blessed be the name of the lord
[25:37] they're here they're on the earth
[25:40] they're everywhere there
[25:42] they're within various churches and
[25:44] groups
[25:45] and god is calling from in the book of
[25:47] revelation
[25:48] come out of her mind people if god
[25:51] wanted you in there he'll leave you
[25:53] there
[25:54] but the bible gives the command come out
[25:56] from a monster my people
[25:58] and be not partakers of our plagues or
[26:02] judgments that i'm going to send upon or
[26:05] because of our
[26:06] errors and because of our
[26:09] statements and actions than examples
[26:13] that she has given for so come out from
[26:16] whatever you are
[26:17] in and come into the perfect
[26:20] law of liberty of the word of god
[26:23] given to us by our lord jesus christ
[26:27] now we know that whatever the church had
[26:31] at pentecost is her inalienable
[26:35] right and it is our divine
[26:38] right to have the same thing
[26:42] they had on the day of
[26:45] pentecost hallelujah brothers and
[26:47] sisters that trailed my
[26:49] soul when as a teenager
[26:53] that i uh i heard the scripture
[26:56] read out of acts chapter 2 and
[26:59] spoke to this wonderful man of god
[27:03] i knew at that time of my boyhood
[27:06] and said do you mean that what i'm
[27:10] reading here right now
[27:12] in this bible this is what is supposed
[27:15] to happen to us
[27:17] in our day and that gentleman said
[27:20] yes i said so do you realize that
[27:24] do you mean that if i were to raise my
[27:27] hands up now
[27:28] and begin to praise and thank god
[27:31] by faith for accepting his word
[27:35] his promise of the holy spirit
[27:38] in my life that god will give me
[27:41] exactly the same thing and uh
[27:45] i said how am i supposed to do it like
[27:48] this
[27:49] and the moment i raised my hands the
[27:52] holy spirit of almighty god
[27:54] dropped upon me and for about
[27:58] 15 to 20 minutes i
[28:01] was speaking and speaking speaking
[28:04] praise god hallelujah and
[28:08] when i came to
[28:11] full fullness of consciousness
[28:15] i could hear myself i wasn't unconscious
[28:17] i could hear myself speaking
[28:20] ah but when i became fully aware
[28:25] then immediately the old minister said
[28:28] oh my god
[28:30] uh there is no doubt of
[28:33] what you have to do and what god called
[28:36] you for
[28:37] brother sister the days of the apostles
[28:41] are not over the apostolic age
[28:44] is not over and by saying these things
[28:47] i'm not
[28:47] identifying or trying to imply that i am
[28:50] one of those
[28:51] apostles do i may be but that's for god
[28:55] to make clear i want you to understand
[28:59] god has promised these things in his
[29:01] word
[29:02] and our unchanging god must bring
[29:05] these things to pass if we consciously
[29:09] earnestly believe his word this
[29:12] is not movie making some mythical
[29:15] thing that's written in this bible it's
[29:18] not just a
[29:19] fantasy but it is faith in the word of
[29:22] god
[29:23] that and the right mental attitude that
[29:26] brings it all to pass
[29:29] hallelujah glory to god hallelujah so we
[29:33] know that this
[29:34] age of manifested holy ghost power
[29:37] manifesting through the saints true the
[29:40] true
[29:41] church of the living god is not over
[29:44] but it's here with us now would you
[29:47] claim your part of it
[29:48] and say oh lord send the power just now
[29:52] oh lord send the power just now
[29:56] oh lord send the power just now
[30:00] and baptize everyone
[30:03] wherever you are receive ye the holy
[30:06] ghost may the spirit of almighty god
[30:10] fill you anoint you and use you
[30:13] for his glory and honor for in the days
[30:16] and years to come
[30:18] amen blessed be his holy name amen glory
[30:21] to god
[30:22] listen my brothers and sisters what that
[30:25] church had
[30:27] was their right and it is
[30:30] our right today for the
[30:34] apostolic age is not over
[30:38] now originally when the church started
[30:41] you will agree with me the church had
[30:43] the pure word straight from the mouth of
[30:46] the lord jesus
[30:48] straight to the lips and hearts of those
[30:50] apostles
[30:51] so the church had the pure word
[30:55] also she had the power of the holy
[30:59] spirit
[31:00] manifesting through her with divers
[31:04] signs and wonders being manifested
[31:08] among the saints of god she also
[31:11] had diversities of gifts of the holy
[31:15] spirit
[31:17] that was so proliferated amongst them
[31:20] it was everywhere the deacons had it
[31:24] the ministers had it the the the
[31:27] apostles had it
[31:29] you had the women in the church
[31:32] phillips daughters had it they
[31:34] prophesied
[31:35] there were others that were anointed by
[31:37] the power of the holy spirit
[31:39] because it was the expected saying
[31:42] it was not something that was
[31:44] extraordinary
[31:46] until uh they went about calling
[31:48] themselves
[31:49] uh apostle apostle so and so or
[31:52] or they went around with some spiritual
[31:55] pride
[31:56] saying oh uh deacon soon so
[31:59] or a prophetess so
[32:02] and so no it wasn't a matter of human
[32:06] pride and uh and naming and claiming
[32:10] and and calling one another by these
[32:12] names they're
[32:13] simply recognize the offices
[32:17] the gifts and powers that were working
[32:21] through
[32:21] the individual and they needed
[32:25] no other badge of identification
[32:29] other than god as with abel
[32:33] god bearing witness
[32:36] testimony of the here
[32:39] their gifts and of his presence within
[32:42] their lives
[32:43] they don't need any other man or woman
[32:46] certification ordination
[32:48] of any that nature that sort of thing is
[32:50] just to operate here upon
[32:52] this earth that we are in but the real
[32:55] ordination the real holy spirit
[32:58] is to come father the bible and anoint
[33:02] his beloved and use them for his glory
[33:06] and for his honor hallelujah amen
[33:10] oh praise god hallelujah amen
[33:14] now we also know not only that she had
[33:16] the
[33:17] perfect pure word of god the power and
[33:19] presence of almighty god
[33:21] signs and wonders miracles
[33:24] manifesting a monster just spontaneous
[33:28] combustion
[33:29] of the purifier's presence and the
[33:32] power of god breaking out at any time
[33:36] oh blessed be his holy name it could be
[33:39] that we're in the quietness and things
[33:42] it will be that we're in a meditation
[33:44] and all of a sudden the holy spirit
[33:46] could break forth
[33:48] that's the original way it was we don't
[33:51] need to work ourselves
[33:52] up like bills uh bails profits
[33:56] into a an emotional frenzy so it will
[33:59] put you into an emotional experience
[34:03] but we don't have to work ourselves up
[34:05] into that and
[34:06] drum it down and music it up or or
[34:10] beat it up or beat it down but rest in
[34:13] the grace of god and
[34:15] have faith in the promise of god that he
[34:18] will fulfill his word for god himself
[34:22] is unchanging and his words must
[34:25] come to pass glory to god hallelujah
[34:28] and so the church the original church
[34:32] will always be the pattern
[34:35] every seed after its kind like
[34:39] will beget like so the original church
[34:44] will be what the true church will try to
[34:47] measure itself against no other group no
[34:50] other church
[34:51] no other institution denomination or
[34:54] independent so-called group that man uh
[34:58] may bring up but a measure yourself by
[35:01] the plumb line
[35:02] and the standards and principles of the
[35:06] word of god
[35:07] and see where you stand
[35:10] according to the word of god now
[35:13] this true church will always be the one
[35:16] that will follow in the footsteps
[35:18] of the founders the first messenger paul
[35:22] and the others that were there at the
[35:25] time
[35:25] it's it's just so simple and wonderful
[35:28] that we just follow
[35:29] the messenger for that first age what
[35:32] god
[35:33] used him and by the way
[35:36] men and women are not ashamed to quote
[35:39] from the epistles of paul and said well
[35:41] did paul say so and so
[35:43] but if i were to stand here and say
[35:46] brother branham said so so they'll say
[35:49] oh
[35:50] that that we don't have to pay attention
[35:52] to that well
[35:54] you don't understand the days of the
[35:56] apostles and the prophets are not over
[35:59] but i'm talking not about this the devil
[36:02] has thrown out so many counterfeits
[36:05] until the people have lost sight of who
[36:08] and what is a true prophet they've lost
[36:11] sight of what and who
[36:12] is a genuine god-sent apostle a
[36:16] god sent man of god a godsend pastor
[36:19] teacher
[36:20] evangelist that lost sight of it has now
[36:23] become
[36:24] just a matter of of a modern day
[36:28] marketing and everything else oh god
[36:30] help us and they
[36:31] are in which we are living so
[36:35] we must judge ourselves according
[36:39] to the original true church
[36:42] of the living god because what she was
[36:45] at pentecost and what she was
[36:49] in the apostolic age that is set forth
[36:52] in this word of god in the book of acts
[36:56] we must apply the same rules
[36:59] and then we will see where she
[37:02] was blessed and use of god and we will
[37:06] also be able to understand
[37:08] the pitfalls and the errors
[37:11] and where even that church failed
[37:16] after they began to drift away
[37:19] from the original truths until even paul
[37:23] before he left the scene
[37:25] began to say i'm afraid that
[37:29] there are grievous wolves
[37:32] brethren man and crept in unawares
[37:38] there was a already an invention of
[37:40] error
[37:41] that was taking place at that time now
[37:44] if that was in the planting season of
[37:46] the church
[37:47] what about the harvest time of the
[37:49] church the ripening season
[37:52] of the church whoa when truth and era
[37:55] are in array when the supernatural war
[37:58] is still going on when the greatest
[38:01] battle ever
[38:02] fought from good from eternity back to
[38:05] eternity
[38:06] being fought and raging in this hour oh
[38:09] glory to god my brother sister don't you
[38:12] see
[38:13] we must follow god's pattern
[38:16] clearly in his word because
[38:20] the errors that took place there
[38:23] and started just as a little bug
[38:27] my friends is growing so great on
[38:31] and great upon the earth until
[38:34] we are facing or we are prophesying
[38:38] and we are experiencing a spiritual
[38:42] blackout of the truth on revelation
[38:47] in the word of the living god
[38:51] oh glory to god i thank god for this
[38:53] first key principle
[38:55] what our god is unchanging
[38:58] now we know that the true church will
[39:01] always
[39:02] try to be like this one that was in
[39:05] the book of acts hallelujah
[39:08] we also discovered that the word teaches
[39:11] us as i've just said that there
[39:14] was there and there is
[39:17] and through the ages there has been
[39:21] a an invasion
[39:24] of error
[39:27] a satanic invasion
[39:31] of enticing spirits versus the word of
[39:35] god
[39:36] seed deucing spirits to draw
[39:39] and charm your mind away
[39:42] from the genuine word of god and to make
[39:46] these sweet sounding
[39:49] talks and bible teachers and
[39:52] things of that nature sound so uh
[39:56] organized orderly symmetrical
[40:00] beautiful words like cain's
[40:03] altar that it could just slip into your
[40:05] heart and into your mind
[40:07] and you accept that as truth of not the
[40:10] rough and ready word of god
[40:13] primitive christianity with brimstone
[40:16] and
[40:17] fire and of stretch oh my god
[40:20] rifle barrel strike gospel from the
[40:24] word of god hallelujah don't you realize
[40:27] that the when abel killed his lamb
[40:31] in the bible and offered it up it was
[40:33] not a
[40:34] sharp knife that he had he had a
[40:38] rough rock whether he banged that animal
[40:41] on the neck until the neck came off but
[40:44] he used
[40:45] a rough-hewn knife made
[40:48] out of a rock and so it appears when a
[40:51] genuine
[40:52] man of god picks up the word of god and
[40:55] begins to use it
[40:57] it appears sometimes rough crude
[41:00] untrained not properly
[41:04] put together symmetrical it doesn't seem
[41:08] progressive it doesn't seem palatable
[41:11] not to our taste not dignified enough
[41:15] that's my friends back to the bible back
[41:18] to the original word of god
[41:20] what you went out in a willingness to
[41:22] see not what you went into the cathedral
[41:25] what did you go into the wilderness to
[41:27] see a prophet i'm more than a prophet
[41:30] you didn't go there to see one dressed
[41:32] up with fine
[41:34] robes like in a green palace but men
[41:36] coming out with
[41:38] gold skinned sheepskin camel skins on
[41:42] oh go praise god not that i don't mean
[41:45] to
[41:45] do that today because we will dress
[41:48] for the day in which we live but my
[41:51] friends it will be
[41:52] simple ordinary men anointed by the holy
[41:57] spirit
[41:58] don't be afraid brothers don't be afraid
[42:00] saints of god
[42:02] you heed the word of god and obey the
[42:05] promised
[42:05] word of the hour and do what god tells
[42:08] you to do
[42:09] not to be a rebel but be one
[42:12] that follows the word of god and that
[42:15] will cause
[42:16] you to fellowship
[42:19] with those of like precious
[42:22] faith that is clear within the word of
[42:26] god
[42:26] hallelujah oh friends we are facing this
[42:29] clear
[42:30] blackout of truth in this last day
[42:34] just before jesus appears first time
[42:37] he was about to come upon the earth in
[42:40] the form
[42:41] of a baby the bible said the people that
[42:45] sat in darkness saw great light
[42:48] and yeah a great light has sprung up
[42:51] oh praise god hallelujah all my friends
[42:55] i believe the same thing has happened in
[42:57] our day that a great
[42:59] light has sprung up here upon the earth
[43:03] lord of god but in the midst of this
[43:05] darkness
[43:06] does god forsake his own does he forget
[43:10] his
[43:11] people in a time like this for them to
[43:14] fall
[43:14] into a state of deception the answer is
[43:17] clear
[43:19] matthew chapter 24 jesus said
[43:23] for they shall arise false christs
[43:26] false prophets and shall show great
[43:29] signs and wonders
[43:31] and this and if it were possible
[43:34] they shall deceive the very elect
[43:38] in other words the elect cannot be
[43:40] deceived
[43:42] and i want to thank god for that my
[43:45] friends
[43:45] that the elect cannot be deceived
[43:50] and i'm glad that in the midst of all of
[43:52] this darkness
[43:54] hallelujah i'm sure you might have heard
[43:57] this
[43:57] story of the boy and his sister
[44:01] that were in an elevator and as it was
[44:06] going down it
[44:09] it suddenly stopped and it has happened
[44:11] in the most modern buildings
[44:14] and the lights went out and it was dark
[44:18] and uh you know she began to his sister
[44:22] began to scream
[44:23] she began to scream uh she was so
[44:27] fearful of the dark oh my
[44:30] my my but in those days
[44:33] back then they also had to have
[44:37] an elevator operator and there was a
[44:40] switch that he could turn on
[44:43] and he could turn those lights on so the
[44:46] young boy
[44:47] turned to his sister and oh say oh
[44:50] don't fear little sister don't fear
[44:53] little sister
[44:54] oh oh there is a man here
[44:57] that can turn on the light oh little
[45:00] church of god
[45:01] in this last day i want to say to you as
[45:04] i am closing now
[45:06] there is a man here that can
[45:10] turn on the light and his name is not
[45:12] john simon

[45:17] jesus christ the same yesterday to them
[45:19] forever

[45:23] faith in him trust him
[45:24] repent confess and serve him
[45:28] and if you are believing saint of god
[45:30] consecrate
[45:31] rededicate yourself to god sincerely
[45:35] let the tears flow my friends at the
[45:38] cross at the cross where i
[45:40] first saw the light and the burden of my
[45:43] heart rolled away where i
[45:44] first saw the light amen may god help
[45:48] you
[45:49] to see this light and open the eyes of
[45:52] your heart
