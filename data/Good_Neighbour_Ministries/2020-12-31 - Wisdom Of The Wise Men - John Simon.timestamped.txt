[0:17] waters from the well of salvation
[0:20] i'm very happy to be here
[0:24] december 31st
[0:27] the ending of our year 2020
[0:33] and we are on the brink of our entry
[0:36] into the new year 2021
[0:43] may god richly bless you
[0:47] and keep you as we
[0:50] approach the word of god
[0:54] at this hour and time
[0:57] we would like to take our scripture
[1:01] from matthew chapter
[1:04] 2 reading from verses
[1:08] 1 to 12.
[1:13] in particular i would like to take
[1:17] verse 12. we find here
[1:23] now when jesus was born
[1:27] in bethlehem of judea
[1:32] in the days of herod the king
[1:36] behold there came
[1:39] wise men from the east
[1:42] to jerusalem saying
[1:46] where is he that is born king of the
[1:49] jews
[1:50] for we have seen a star in the east
[1:53] and are come to worship him
[1:58] when herod the king had heard these
[2:00] things he was troubled
[2:02] and all jerusalem with him
[2:06] but when he had gathered the chief
[2:08] priests and scribes and
[2:10] of the people together and he demanded
[2:13] of them where christ should be born
[2:17] and they said unto him in bethlehem of
[2:19] judea
[2:21] for thus it is written by the prophet
[2:25] and thou bettly him in the land of judah
[2:29] are not the least among the princes of
[2:32] judah
[2:33] for out of thee shall come a governor
[2:38] that shall rule my people
[2:41] of israel when herod then herod when he
[2:45] had privileged called the wise men
[2:48] inquired of them diligently
[2:52] what time the star appeared
[2:56] and he sent them to bethlehem and said
[2:58] go and search
[3:00] diligently for the young child and when
[3:02] we have found him bring me
[3:04] word again that i may
[3:07] come and worship him
[3:10] also and when they had heard the king
[3:14] they departed
[3:16] and lo the star which they saw in the
[3:20] east
[3:21] went before them
[3:24] and till it came and stood
[3:27] over where the young
[3:31] child was
[3:34] when they saw the star they rejoiced
[3:38] with exceeding great joy
[3:42] and when they were come into the house
[3:46] they saw the young child with
[3:49] mary his mother and fell
[3:52] down and worshipped him
[3:56] and when they had opened their treasures
[3:59] they presented unto him
[4:02] gifts gold and frankincense
[4:07] and myrrh and being
[4:10] warned of god in a dream
[4:13] that they should not return to herod
[4:17] they departed into their
[4:20] own country another way
[4:25] praise be to god for the reading of his
[4:28] word
[4:29] let us pray a gracious father
[4:33] we thank you so much for the
[4:37] written word that you have given us a
[4:40] record of things
[4:42] that have taken place from which we can
[4:45] draw
[4:46] insights uh wisdom
[4:50] revelation from this
[4:53] through your great holy spirit we pray
[4:56] you'll help us today bless us today
[4:58] father
[4:59] as this year of 2020
[5:03] it's now winding down
[5:06] we thank you for the wonderful songs and
[5:09] testimonies
[5:11] the great efforts of the saints of god
[5:15] oh lord the various
[5:18] victory victories the
[5:22] praises and honor and glory that was
[5:26] given to your name
[5:28] just before i brought this message
[5:31] father
[5:32] and i'm asking you to bless everyone all
[5:35] of them that participated
[5:38] that give their hearts their lives their
[5:40] talents their all
[5:42] to give glory and honor and
[5:45] praise to you lord bless us here now we
[5:49] pray
[5:50] in the name of our lord jesus christ we
[5:53] ask it
[5:54] amen and amen praise the lord
[5:59] praise god brother branham
[6:03] speaking from who do you say this is
[6:09] he says we are living in a marvelous
[6:11] time
[6:13] the the greatest of all
[6:16] the ages we're living
[6:20] to win time can cease
[6:24] and eternity can blend right
[6:28] in with it and go on
[6:33] the ages of all the prophets
[6:36] and the sages look forward to
[6:40] we ought to be every hour on
[6:44] our guard watching
[6:48] for his coming
[6:51] oh we are in a critical hour
[6:54] the world is but the real
[6:58] church not the denomination
[7:02] is ready for the greatest triumph
[7:06] it has ever made the coming
[7:09] of the groom to the bride
[7:13] oh what a day one an hour is now
[7:16] wonderful
[7:17] the coming of the groom
[7:21] to the bride at this time
[7:25] not four but two praise the lord he is
[7:29] here
[7:29] too and when that talk coming to her
[7:33] as a revelation changes
[7:36] and goes into a rapturing condition
[7:40] then they go out of here but praise
[7:44] be the god that i'd like to speak on the
[7:47] subject of
[7:48] the wisdom of the wise men
[7:51] for if they were called wise men by god
[7:54] himself
[7:54] in the bible then they must be wise
[7:59] and first of all we understand that
[8:01] these wise men
[8:02] were indeed wise for
[8:05] under the inspiration
[8:09] of a balaam the prophet
[8:12] his message that out
[8:15] of jacob would rise a great star
[8:21] amen out of jacob out of
[8:24] him will rise the star that will come up
[8:29] that will be a governor and a ruler
[8:33] over god's people israel
[8:38] they got a revelation
[8:41] from him and so they were watching
[8:44] for a star they were waiting
[8:48] for the appearance of a star
[8:52] for the star to appear
[8:56] and when that great star
[8:59] did appear as you know these
[9:03] wise men were astronomers
[9:08] they were astronomers maybe
[9:11] also astrologers
[9:14] because in those days back then
[9:18] before the torah was even written
[9:22] god's first bible was in the skies
[9:26] using the moon stars and sun
[9:29] as signs to show times and
[9:33] seasons and and so on
[9:36] so the patriots of of their day
[9:40] actually read god's bible
[9:44] in the sky now we know that god has
[9:49] moved on from that
[9:53] torah came along and then
[9:56] the fullness of the word where
[10:00] jesus came on the scene and it was
[10:03] written of him
[10:04] and then god revealed to paul the rest
[10:07] of the new testament
[10:10] of which now we have bought both old and
[10:14] new testament but these men at that time
[10:21] watch for the stars in the sky
[10:26] and when they saw it thank god
[10:30] they recognized it you see you see what
[10:33] you're looking for
[10:35] oh my praise god they recognize
[10:39] the star because they were watching
[10:43] for it thank god
[10:46] and they followed the star from their
[10:49] different countries
[10:51] from which they came their different
[10:54] nations
[10:55] from which they came uh today we'll say
[10:58] well you know they came out of different
[11:01] nations
[11:02] i believe india hindustan
[11:06] you know and persia
[11:09] what other country i don't know whether
[11:12] it's turkey or wherever
[11:13] but the three wise men
[11:17] traveled following the star
[11:20] from their different nations
[11:25] and we are here today by the
[11:28] grace of almighty god
[11:31] because we have come out from our
[11:33] various
[11:34] dynamic nations led
[11:38] by god's star of the hour
[11:42] and we have recognized god's star
[11:46] and we have followed god's star
[11:49] amen hallelujah and as
[11:53] far as i know and believe and have
[11:56] received
[11:57] and witnessed in my heart life and
[12:00] ministry
[12:02] that he has led us to the perfect light
[12:07] now we know that these three wise men
[12:11] represented the three
[12:14] sons of noah shem
[12:17] ham and japheth and so
[12:21] is speaking about the entire human race
[12:25] being under the influence of this
[12:29] great marvelous star
[12:33] hallelujah now as you know
[12:36] we have just had the conjunction of two
[12:40] stars
[12:41] coming together jupiter
[12:45] and saturn and forming
[12:48] one shining star within the
[12:52] night sky after hundreds of years
[12:57] this star has appeared two stars
[13:01] but in the day of jesus when the wise
[13:05] men
[13:05] followed that star we understand
[13:09] from historical writing records
[13:13] we understand that it's act in fact it
[13:15] was
[13:16] three stars and
[13:19] these three stars merged
[13:24] moved and they came into a conjunction
[13:29] they came into a union and when
[13:33] they were close together from the earth
[13:36] looking to them or at them
[13:40] there were seen as one great
[13:44] bright star within the sky
[13:47] glory to god hallelujah amen
[13:50] possibly jupiter
[13:54] saturn and venus
[13:57] that's possibly that's the names of
[14:00] those
[14:01] uh individual stars at that time
[14:06] now we understand that stars actually
[14:10] represent times according to god
[14:13] saying in genesis he puts them there for
[14:16] the signs
[14:18] and for seasons and
[14:22] also stars represents
[14:26] of course parts of the zodiac represents
[14:30] the spirits of men that are
[14:33] on the earth here
[14:36] so as these three stars
[14:39] moved in the heavens these
[14:43] three wise men from different
[14:46] nations in our davidson in different
[14:50] denominations were traveling
[14:54] towards the truth searching
[14:57] to find the fullness of the word of
[15:00] god's truth
[15:02] and as they were traveling individually
[15:06] on the earth and moving
[15:09] in the heavens above the stars
[15:12] were moving also moving into a union and
[15:17] a conjunction
[15:19] until they came into a state of oneness
[15:23] to shine forth the light of god
[15:27] blessed be his holy name
[15:30] and so praise god those
[15:33] three men even though they never knew
[15:36] each other
[15:38] their paths crossed at bethlehem's gate
[15:43] where the star came together as one
[15:48] and thank god looking at god's
[15:51] seventh church age star messenger
[15:56] that he sent up on this earth
[15:59] following that ministry
[16:02] it has led us to the
[16:05] gate of the lamb of god
[16:09] bethlehem's gate praise be to
[16:13] god hallelujah and we have come together
[16:17] to do what to see the
[16:20] birth of the newborn word
[16:23] all glory to god hallelujah is
[16:27] led us to the new born
[16:30] word of god for this hour now
[16:33] back in the days of jesus
[16:37] when the three stars appeared three
[16:40] being the number of of perfection
[16:45] it spoke about the
[16:48] headship the coming of the head
[16:52] of the body of christ
[16:55] and he jesus is the head
[16:59] of the body amen and so
[17:02] it spoke about the headship praise the
[17:05] lord
[17:06] and he came as what the son
[17:09] of man for now god was in
[17:13] flesh appearing god had condescended and
[17:18] was in
[17:18] the flesh appearing upon your earth
[17:22] praise god in our day two stars have
[17:26] appeared two stars
[17:29] hallelujah representing my friends
[17:34] not the coming so much of the headship
[17:37] but the coming of the body the coming of
[17:41] the head
[17:42] to the body a uniting time
[17:47] a supernatural natural conjunction
[17:51] typing and speaking of a spiritual
[17:55] supernatural conjunction
[17:58] of the head christ coming to his body
[18:02] which is his bride his wife
[18:06] amen hallelujah and praise
[18:09] god we find it here friends
[18:12] the presence of his body here on the
[18:15] earth

[18:20] opening of the word of god

[18:26] this scripture of luke 17
[18:30] that in the days of sodom
[18:35] how that day son of man
[18:38] that would be revealed again but
[18:42] now we know he is being revealed again
[18:46] but not in the form of the head he is
[18:50] now
[18:50] being revealed or is revealing himself
[18:53] to us
[18:55] in the bride form or in the
[18:58] form of a bride

[21:36] to the perfect understanding and
[21:39] revelation of our day
[21:42] seeing being led
[21:45] not by a star in the heavens
[21:49] but led by a seventh star
[21:52] church age messenger amen spoken of
[21:56] in revelation chapter 3
[21:59] revelation chapter 10 verse 7
[22:03] led by that twinkling shining
[22:06] wondrous star of god the light of
[22:09] revelation emanating from his message
[22:13] and from his ministry has led us
[22:16] right now my friends to the perfect
[22:20] light of god for this hour thanks be to
[22:23] god
[22:24] and some will say brother simon what you
[22:28] are saying i don't see it
[22:30] i don't understand it i don't know what
[22:33] you're talking about
[22:35] but it's just like it was back then
[22:39] the wise men saw the star but many
[22:42] others
[22:43] didn't or could not see the stars
[22:47] my god they didn't see it and now
[22:50] we have people in our day that do not
[22:53] see the star
[22:54] don't recognize the star don't
[22:57] understand the message the ministry
[23:00] of that star and what sign
[23:03] what does it mean who is this they do
[23:06] not understand
[23:08] who this is but god by his holy spirit
[23:12] has blessed us and revealed to us
[23:15] and caused us to know who this is and we
[23:18] give
[23:19] god the glory and the honor for it
[23:22] praise
[23:22] god hallelujah now you must realize
[23:27] herod and his wise men didn't see it
[23:31] or they would have had the answers for
[23:33] the wise men
[23:35] the rabbis the jewish rabbis
[23:39] who speak from childhood to manhood
[23:43] and into ancient man studying the
[23:46] scriptures day and night
[23:49] did not see that star in the skies
[23:54] they did not recognize what god
[23:57] was doing in this hour oh
[24:01] watchmen what of the night the morning
[24:04] cometh
[24:05] and what of the night oh blessed be the
[24:08] name of the lord
[24:09] hallelujah o praise god but the wise men
[24:14] they were able to see the star
[24:18] because that star was given
[24:21] specifically for them to see for
[24:24] unto you it's given to know the mystery
[24:27] of the kingdom but unto them it is not
[24:30] given
[24:31] god predis elected and predestinated
[24:36] those wise men of that day to
[24:39] recognize that star messenger leader
[24:44] and they followed the star and the star
[24:48] led them to jesus christ hallelujah
[24:51] even so in our day and in our time
[24:55] we were being chosen elected
[24:58] predestinated by god
[25:00] to be come to the word of this hour
[25:03] and to understand and follow
[25:06] by supernatural revelation
[25:10] right to the christ of god himself amen
[25:14] hallelujah glory to god notice
[25:19] that took their eyes off of that star
[25:23] for a brief period of time
[25:29] and when they took their eyes off of
[25:32] that star
[25:35] they were blinded for a
[25:38] brief while by the
[25:41] glare of man the glare of the glory
[25:45] of herod the glare of the glory
[25:50] of religious dignitaries
[25:53] they were distracted
[25:57] and temporarily misled
[26:00] by these religious
[26:04] popular dignitaries
[26:08] and religious leaders and
[26:11] this happened because
[26:14] they uh believed or
[26:17] thought to themselves that
[26:20] since these were learned leaders in the
[26:24] written scriptures of the day the
[26:27] written
[26:28] message of that day that they should
[26:32] know
[26:33] when this star or where the star
[26:37] has appeared and
[26:40] we know friends that they
[26:44] did not know they knew the scriptures
[26:49] they knew the scriptures said it that
[26:51] the star would rise
[26:52] from jesse they knew it would come
[26:56] around bethlehem ephrata they knew that
[26:59] from
[26:59] writing but by revelation
[27:02] they had no idea that the star
[27:06] had already appeared and the wise men
[27:11] were being already led by that star
[27:15] to the christ they knew the scriptures
[27:18] but they did not know him many
[27:23] in this message in this day and
[27:26] in this hour mighty men of god
[27:29] mighty leaders great dignitaries great
[27:32] man
[27:34] oh no god no his word nor the scriptures
[27:39] but i'm not conscious of god
[27:43] to be aware of the supernatural
[27:47] occurrence that has taken taking place
[27:51] and is taking place as the book is
[27:54] unfolding
[27:56] god revealing himself and interpreting
[27:59] himself
[28:00] in this day and in this hour and
[28:03] making himself known they know the
[28:06] courts they
[28:07] know the scriptures they know the word
[28:09] they'll
[28:10] they'll tack you to a wall with that but
[28:13] they
[28:13] have no idea they're skimming around
[28:17] close to it
[28:18] but they're not really into it
[28:21] not just by lining up quotes lining up
[28:24] scriptures
[28:25] comparing texts and stuff like that but
[28:27] coming
[28:28] under the inspiration of the mighty
[28:30] angel of
[28:31] revelation 10 1 coming under the power
[28:35] of the
[28:35] supernatural covenant of god the great
[28:38] holy spirit
[28:40] moving within the heart of the true
[28:42] believer
[28:43] and making himself known and
[28:45] interpreting his own word through them
[28:48] for his glory
[28:49] and for his honor oh blessed be the name
[28:52] of the lord
[28:54] hallelujah those men were so convinced
[28:59] as we are convinced that
[29:02] those of us would caught the genuine
[29:05] core heart ingredient of the
[29:09] last prophets message
[29:13] and pressed our way into the kingdom
[29:16] hallelujah holding to god's unchanging
[29:20] word
[29:20] and there we are those men were
[29:23] convinced
[29:25] even though they had never seen
[29:28] anything of this sort in their lifetimes
[29:32] or heard of any such a thing they
[29:35] followed the star according to the word
[29:38] of prophecy
[29:40] that was revealed and made known to them
[29:43] they followed the star and they did it

[38:18] looking for another great outpouring
[38:23] and a powerful uh end-time
[38:27] revival of that nature we were looking
[38:30] for that because that's what we've seen
[38:33] in the past
[38:34] not realizing that what god was going to
[38:37] give on his giving is in a different way
[38:41] to accomplish the same goals and more

[39:44] came contrary to what is being taught
[39:48] the myths that they're taught
[39:52] and the religious lies that are
[39:55] propagated
[39:59] those wise men never
[40:03] went to any manger they never
[40:06] found joseph and mary in the manger
[40:09] the bible tells us if you will read
[40:12] matthew 2 where i just read
[40:16] says they found the child and his mother
[40:19] in a house
[40:21] and he was not an infant and at this
[40:25] stage
[40:25] the message since 63 has come
[40:28] out of its infancy or
[40:32] praise god and is growing now
[40:35] standing on its own two feet but old and
[40:39] new testament
[40:41] it's walking for itself and beginning to
[40:44] talk for itself god is now

[40:52] own word and interpreting his own word
[40:54] by his holy spirit
[40:56] for when he the spirit of truth is come
[40:59] he will
[40:59] guide you into all truth and show you
[41:03] things to come blessed be the name of
[41:05] the living god
[41:06] hallelujah praise god amen
[41:10] when they found that child
[41:13] he was haunted by these
[41:16] other nations he was hated
[41:20] by the great dignitaries he was
[41:24] misunderstood by even the religious
[41:27] people of that day
[41:30] an hour and some were even
[41:34] questioning the circumstances
[41:38] surrounding his birth about an angel
[41:41] coming and speaking and saying things
[41:45] like that
[41:46] they were questioning the circumstances
[41:50] of his birth hallelujah
[41:53] thank god years have passed
[41:57] since this message has struck the earth
[42:02] and it's come to this stage now
[42:05] hallelujah where the revealed word of
[42:08] the hour
[42:09] is no longer within the manger
[42:13] of the heart of the prophet
[42:17] william branham the
[42:20] message is now standing on its
[42:24] own two feet the revelation is
[42:28] making itself known and interpret god
[42:32] interpreting his own word hallelujah
[42:36] thank god and speaking
[42:39] for himself through his word glory be to
[42:43] god
[42:44] amen yes sir listen
[42:47] except a man be
[42:51] born again he
[42:54] shall in no wise
[42:57] he shall in no wise he won't be a wise
[43:01] man
[43:01] oh praise god hallelujah brother sister
[43:05] thank god for his blessed work he won't
[43:07] be able to
[43:08] enter the kingdom of the living god the
[43:11] entry point into the kingdom oh
[43:15] the way to glory or
[43:18] the portals of god
[43:22] the way the truth the life into christ
[43:26] hallelujah glory to his name hallelujah
[43:30] thank god wise men are usually
[43:33] hungry for the word that's why they
[43:37] chase after it they follow it till they
[43:40] find it
[43:41] in every way blessed are they that
[43:44] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[43:48] for they shall be filled glory to
[43:51] god hallelujah friends the wise men were
[43:55] truly wise
[43:57] they were wise because they brought to
[44:00] him their gifts
[44:02] which means that before they left
[44:06] their land their nation their country
[44:10] they already had whether you wanted to
[44:13] call it a fuzzy
[44:15] revelation but they had some kind of a
[44:19] revelation
[44:21] each one had an individual revelation
[44:24] because one saw him bringing gold
[44:28] to represent that he saw him reveal to
[44:31] him as king
[44:32] king and the other one
[44:36] had a revelation of him and he saw him
[44:39] as the great high priest hallelujah
[44:43] lord of god oh my praise god
[44:47] the last one saw him amen
[44:51] he saw him he brought mer and he saw him
[44:54] by his revelation
[44:56] that he was the true lamb not the
[44:59] substitute animals
[45:01] but the true lamb that was supposed to
[45:04] die
[45:05] and become their savior and that he was
[45:08] born to die and so he brought myrrh
[45:11] to represent that my friends so we see
[45:14] them
[45:15] bringing gold frankincense
[45:18] and myrrh represented re representing
[45:22] kingship deity on divinity
[45:26] frankincense representing his
[45:29] intercessory ministry and priesthood
[45:32] and his mediatorship oh glory to god
[45:35] hallelujah
[45:36] murr representing his death oh my
[45:40] and his post and position as redeemer
[45:44] to bring redemption for the entire world
[45:47] that the people who sat in darkness
[45:50] shall see a great light and the glory of
[45:52] god
[45:53] has sprung up i rise awake and come to
[45:56] the light
[45:57] for them for the praise god the light is
[46:00] reason
[46:01] and the word is giving us light for this
[46:04] day
[46:05] and for this hour hallelujah
[46:08] oh praise god god came
[46:11] in flesh as his own prophet to make
[46:14] himself known
[46:16] thank god in this hour may we be
[46:19] wise like the wise men and come to
[46:22] god and give to him all of our talents
[46:27] all of our gifts
[46:29] that he has given us let us give our
[46:32] lives as not dead animal
[46:36] sacrifices back there but give your life
[46:39] as a living sacrifice
[46:42] living and sacrificing for this message
[46:45] and the things you may and must go
[46:47] through as
[46:48] a living sacrifice for the glory of the
[46:51] living god
[46:52] hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah
[46:57] also let us give him our gifts
[47:00] of our lives today let us magnify
[47:05] and glorify him by the way
[47:08] we live today let us adore him
[47:12] magnify him by the lies
[47:16] we show we express to the world
[47:19] everywhere for his glory and for
[47:23] his honor praise god
[47:26] now after they have given
[47:31] to the christ in actual fact
[47:34] to his spirits hallelujah
[47:38] after they had given the appropriate
[47:42] gifts amen
[47:46] that reflected who he was
[47:51] his birth his life and his death
[47:56] they left and began
[48:01] to return back to their own country
[48:04] but there were sought out by herod
[48:08] and i must tell you when you have caught
[48:11] this revelation
[48:14] they may not understand what you are
[48:16] saying everything you're saying
[48:18] but they're recognized you caught
[48:20] something
[48:22] and they would like to know where that
[48:25] came from
[48:26] and how can we get
[48:29] it what mean it this
[48:34] how men and brethren what shall we do
[48:37] to get it can we buy it can we
[48:42] question you and ask you about it
[48:45] amen so they were sought out by herod
[48:50] and his people
[48:53] because herod didn't catch the
[48:55] revelation the rabbis didn't catch it
[48:58] his wise men his astrologers didn't
[49:00] catch it
[49:01] at that time but he wanted to have
[49:05] an intellectual knowledge or
[49:09] understanding of that revelation
[49:12] of who this christ was this anointed
[49:16] word
[49:17] was this king god king word king of
[49:20] righteousness king of peace if he
[49:24] wanted to have an understanding of what
[49:27] was going
[49:28] on in his kingdom and
[49:31] what did they really find out
[49:34] what did they discover or he wanted an
[49:37] explanation
[49:39] what was it what is it
[49:42] that's revealed to you let me know this
[49:46] amen hallelujah and the wise men
[49:51] knew this what was made known to them by
[49:55] god himself
[49:57] being warned of god in a dream
[50:01] i know better said the servant
[50:05] and prophet of god to go tell you
[50:08] a revelation of what god has
[50:12] made known to me until it's already in
[50:15] progress
[50:16] and it happens and then it's too late
[50:20] satan can do nothing oh praise god
[50:23] being warned in a dream said the bible
[50:27] matthew chapter 2 verse 12 their return
[50:31] to their own country the bible says
[50:35] another way that did not go back the
[50:38] same way they came
[50:41] and if you come listen
[50:44] recognize and this revelation strikes
[50:48] your heart
[50:50] you'll never return the same way that
[50:53] you came in
[50:55] i'm not just talking about uh a sinner
[50:58] in the street
[50:59] a homeless person or some body
[51:03] out there that knows uh nothing about
[51:06] the god
[51:07] right in this message
[51:10] hearing all the courts reading all the
[51:12] scriptures reading all the texts
[51:14] following it for many years
[51:16] but never really caught the true light
[51:19] that shine it in this hour
[51:21] but if you open your heart if you are
[51:24] one of those elected seed you will truly
[51:28] see
[51:28] but that is the identification of the
[51:30] spoken word bride of christ
[51:33] giving you eyes to see an ears to hear
[51:36] others sitting right there beside you
[51:39] will not understand not
[51:42] one thing they'll understand the english
[51:45] but they won't understand
[51:49] they circle the fullness
[51:53] of the word of god that is being known
[51:56] in this day and in this hour
[51:59] we are in the same position my eyes have

[52:36] same

[52:43] you're going to return not the same way
[52:47] you were
[52:48] but you're going to return a different
[52:50] person because your eyes have seen the
[52:53] lord of hosts
[52:55] your eyes have caught a glimpse
[52:58] appear pierce the veil

[53:21] gates by which they entered in they
[53:24] did not go back to their denominational
[53:27] gates
[53:28] they did not return to ask questions of
[53:31] herod the wise men
[53:33] the rabbi the learned man the religious
[53:35] leaders the dignitaries
[53:38] oh my god the bible says being warned of
[53:41] god in a dream

[53:51] way all glory be unto god

[55:02] great pillar of salt
[55:05] standing by the shores of the dead sea
[55:11] where sodom and gomorrah
[55:15] lies buried beneath
[55:18] the dead sea and there on its backs

[56:22] all manner of things that would astonish
[56:25] your
[56:26] mind and your heart put your

[1:04:27] god
[1:04:27] friends because of the presence
[1:04:29] circumstances
[1:04:32] because of the shutdowns that we are
[1:04:35] experiencing
[1:04:37] we are not able to meet in our
[1:04:39] tabernacle
[1:04:40] face to face and to enjoy
[1:04:45] one another's presence fellowship
[1:04:49] we can do that on the phone and do it
[1:04:51] through
[1:04:52] media but that's good but it's not the
[1:04:55] same
[1:04:56] as when we meet and talk and fellowship
[1:04:59] together
[1:05:00] around the world and assemble for his
[1:05:02] glorious name on the lord's day
[1:05:05] and open up the lord's book to give
[1:05:07] glory to the lord's name
[1:05:10] my friends this is a testing time
[1:05:15] 2021 a
[1:05:17] testing time a year of testing a time of
[1:05:22] testing it's a sifting time
[1:05:27] it's a time where god is proving
[1:05:31] his word because
[1:05:34] god is trying to prove us
[1:05:38] us to our faithfulness
[1:05:43] to his revealed word of this hour
[1:05:48] our action
[1:05:51] to reaction how
[1:05:54] do we react to the circumstances
[1:05:57] and to his word amen
[1:06:01] will we wonder about the word
[1:06:05] because of these
[1:06:08] dignitaries rabbis and uh
[1:06:12] men out there that claim they can read
[1:06:15] the stars
[1:06:16] also they have some understanding of the
[1:06:19] messenger
[1:06:20] are we to begin to cause them to say
[1:06:23] things that will make you
[1:06:24] wonder and then after you start
[1:06:27] start wondering
[1:06:31] will they cause you to wander away
[1:06:35] from the message of the hour
[1:06:39] the word of god given for this day
[1:06:44] and for this time will you
[1:06:48] become a piece of dry duck
[1:06:51] a dried up driftwood card away
[1:06:56] on the tides of time oh my brother my
[1:07:00] sister
[1:07:02] look to the word of god look to the lamb
[1:07:05] of god
[1:07:06] hallelujah
[1:07:09] don't allow in this hour for god
[1:07:13] is doing it he has put every one of us
[1:07:16] on an individual basis
[1:07:20] away from pastor away from this away
[1:07:23] from church away from that one
[1:07:25] away from the other one that he might
[1:07:28] personally
[1:07:29] try you and prove you as to your
[1:07:32] personal faith not that you are propped
[1:07:35] up
[1:07:35] like a tomato plant not that you are
[1:07:38] held up together
[1:07:40] but god wants to see your faith in his
[1:07:43] word
[1:07:44] and he is now proving his word and
[1:07:47] testing you in the wilderness
[1:07:49] of this day and of this hour
[1:07:52] just in you as to our meeting to worship

[1:08:17] denominationalism where you came from
[1:08:20] or you can start to claim the message
[1:08:24] but you're edging
[1:08:25] and inching your way to the border land
[1:08:29] to go
[1:08:30] enter into pentecostalism
[1:08:33] and back to that yet claiming to be
