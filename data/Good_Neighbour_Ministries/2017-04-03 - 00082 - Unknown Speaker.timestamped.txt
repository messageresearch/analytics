[0:35] world Hallelujah and we can receive all
[0:39] that we want by the grace of
[0:43] godall oh praise God the church is no
[0:46] longer the mpce of God God is turning
[0:50] away from her you just have to look out
[0:52] there and see that he's turning away
[0:53] from is it right not when she walks into
[0:57] the church walks into the church with
[0:59] charts on
[1:00] MH like I told you my wife and I was
[1:03] going somewhere and we saw a certain
[1:04] church and the pastor's wife and all the
[1:07] ladies in the church were coming up with
[1:08] bikinis out of the church they were just
[1:11] locking the door going to the swimming
[1:13] pool and they were going to have a swim
[1:15] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:17] this is what the church has come down to
[1:19] and then they have all kinds of
[1:21] promotions and they have all kinds of
[1:23] stuff going on and you know selling this
[1:26] and selling that and selling the other
[1:29] and all kinds of of programs and this
[1:31] and that nothing is wrong with the
[1:33] church having certain kinds of programs
[1:35] inocent but my goodness
[1:38] everywhere manages for this and that and
[1:41] everything else going on praise God
[1:43] bringing in every kind of fou bird
[1:46] inside of the church amen amen you know
[1:50] what some of them would even invite um
[1:54] uh what what what I can't remember these
[1:56] names of this modern uh lady guy
[2:03] I'm tell if if she were to tell some of
[2:06] these churches that I'd like to come and
[2:08] uh perform for you on Sunday morning is
[2:10] all the doors open white they're not
[2:13] even going to talk or discuss anything
[2:15] with her they don't at the door uh wi
[2:17] like that amen and then uh when we have
[2:21] certain uh standards that we keep by the
[2:25] word they're going to say oh they're
[2:27] strange yes there something's wrong with
[2:30] them they're not living up to this but
[2:32] God don't change God don't never change
[2:36] he Remains the Same God Amen Hallelujah
[2:40] praise God the message Remains the
[2:44] Same hallelujah amen the method of how
[2:48] you deliver it or you carry it may
[2:51] change the transportation may change
[2:54] whether it's a bicycle a carriage and L
[2:57] around a car and then L from a car you
[3:00] know you go to rockets and everything
[3:02] else so the the the carrying the
[3:05] transportation of the message that may
[3:08] change but the message itself does not
[3:11] change amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[3:14] so that's where we have to place our fa
[3:16] now God says clearly that with all the
[3:19] wisdom of these churches around you
[3:21] sometimes you tend to get a
[3:23] complex a spiritual complex you know uh
[3:27] but but he says God will confound
[3:30] amen he will confound them in this last
[3:34] day true the message the Prophet The
[3:37] Bride for there will be the voice of God
[3:41] and the voice of God will be in her amen
[3:44] praise God forever you w have to think
[3:47] what you have to say or what you going
[3:49] to do in that hour for the father that
[3:51] dwells in you will speak through you is
[3:54] that right says Don't Fear when you
[3:56] become up before the judge and he tries
[3:59] to scare anybody H from the G
[4:01] he speak the truth I already speak the
[4:05] truth you don't have to knock the G for
[4:07] me to speak the
[4:08] truth that's all I know how to speak
[4:12] amen so we are not we Fearless because
[4:15] it's our father in US amen and don't
[4:18] feel a complex oh I'm not educated no I
[4:21] don't know how to answer this I don't
[4:23] know the message God didn't ask you what
[4:25] you know you ask what you
[4:27] believe is that right he didn't ask you
[4:30] to be successful he ask you to be
[4:32] faithful if you Happ to be successful
[4:34] and faithful then it's wonderful but the
[4:37] fact is your faith must be in God our
[4:40] secret weapon is
[4:43] revelation he said the devil hates it
[4:47] why because one minute the person knows
[4:50] nothing and the next moment all of a
[4:53] sudden something comes out of their
[4:55] mouth that confs the devil this him my
[4:57] heart attack right man he he he's
[5:01] whipping his tail all over the place and
[5:03] he doesn't know what to do because he's
[5:05] in confusion cuz the father just speaks
[5:07] right out amen praise the name of the
[5:09] Lord hallelujah I told the story of a
[5:11] brother that wasn't educated
[5:14] thought and uh somebody was commiting
[5:17] his a vehicle and because he wouldn't
[5:19] sell it for the price they wanted they
[5:21] got mad because he wouldn't sell them at
[5:24] the price they wanted and punched him in
[5:27] the mouth and broke his teeth
[5:29] and it was in the night in a parking lot
[5:33] amen I should say punch they hit him in
[5:35] the mouth and broke his teeth and so it
[5:38] came up as a before the courts the
[5:41] police came and came up before the court
[5:44] so the the lawyer came up and says my
[5:46] good man on the night of so so were you
[5:49] withness he says yes sir says and you
[5:53] made a claim that my client was also
[5:55] there he says yes sir he says and you
[5:57] made a claim that my client uh bash you
[6:02] in the teeth with a with a iron with a
[6:05] pipe or some iron object he says yes sir
[6:09] he says now uh according to the weather
[6:13] there was no moon on that night that
[6:16] part not had no lights it was dark it
[6:19] was very dark how can you say that my
[6:22] time hit you on your mouth with a with
[6:25] iron pipe and the brother got mad he's
[6:28] in court but he for God himself and
[6:30] before he could think he said do you
[6:33] have to see a fight when it hit you in
[6:35] the mouth and break it oh Court started
[6:38] laughing because you don't have to see
[6:40] it you just got to feel it right even
[6:43] the judge started laughing said dismiss
[6:46] give the man his and give the brother
[6:48] his settlement of whatever he had to
[6:50] have but he didn't know what to do and
[6:52] he got mad and before you know he spoke
[6:54] out and and there was the answer right
[6:56] there you don't need to see it to know
[6:58] what hit you
[7:00] is iron pipe when iron pipe get
[7:03] you and people started laughing at the
[7:06] lawyer and even the judge laugh so God
[7:09] speaks through you in simple
[7:11] words and don't second guess yourself
[7:14] but trust God that he does live in you
[7:18] and he will speak through you and
[7:21] because it's in his interest so he says
[7:25] the spirit in the on the bride say come
[7:30] so you see once more the world will
[7:34] again hear directly from God as it was
[7:38] on the day of pente cross but of course
[7:42] the the word Bride for doing that will
[7:45] be
[7:46] repated just as in the first age what
[7:50] does all this gathering together mean
[7:52] talking about the problem what is all of
[7:54] this about message you know H these men
[7:58] are drunken as we suppose
[8:02] right mocking the Bible say and they

[8:27] William BR the Lord
[8:30] and took the scriptures and show them
[8:32] from Joel 238 that that is the prophecy
[8:35] that was now being fulfilled in them and
[8:38] we have a right to show Malachi 4:5
[8:41] Revelation 10:7 that voice is in us and

[8:46] that's what that's what separates us
[8:49] from every other bird we are the speal

[9:06] male was killed and the blood as he fled
[9:08] on the altar sprayed on the priest and
[9:11] sprayed on the wings of that white do

[10:02] you are not doing anything about the
[10:04] word except dividing it up packing it
[10:08] into pieces amen taking what you want
[10:11] and leaving out the rest of what you
[10:14] don't want you are not interested in
[10:17] living it you are more interesting in
[10:20] debating it have you found people like
[10:23] that they're not interested in you
[10:26] having a good fellowship with them they
[10:27] want to prove that
