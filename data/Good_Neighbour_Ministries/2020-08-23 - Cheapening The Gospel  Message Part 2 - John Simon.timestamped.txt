[13:37] to my dear friends and followers
[13:42] good sunday morning to you
[13:46] i'm trusting that you
[13:49] will thoroughly receive
[13:52] the word of god for today
[13:56] with great joy
[13:59] and at the same time
[14:02] with a sobriety and reverence
[14:07] that will touch your hearts and
[14:10] lives may the lord richly
[14:14] bless you now
[14:17] last week we spoke on the first
[14:20] part of the cheapening of the message
[14:26] in this we used the scripture
[14:30] of after solomon's death
[14:34] how that uh the
[14:37] shields of gold that solomon
[14:41] had given to his guards for his palace
[14:46] were taken away out of the land of
[14:50] israel
[14:52] robbed from them
[14:56] and solomon's son rehoboam
[15:01] decided that he would
[15:04] produce or reproduce
[15:08] replicas of the shields of solomon
[15:14] but instead of
[15:17] creating them with the same qualities
[15:21] of gold he devalued them he degraded
[15:27] them he
[15:27] cheapened them and brought them
[15:30] down my friends to the level of brass
[15:35] by passing silver on down the brass
[15:41] and from this we brought this
[15:44] thought of the cheapening of the message
[15:48] speaking of the devaluation
[15:52] of the dollar and of the devaluation
[15:56] of faith now today we would like
[16:00] to continue now to those who have truly
[16:05] caught this message
[16:09] of the hour the gospel
[16:12] message of the day
[16:15] may god send to you and
[16:18] restore to us the
[16:22] joy of our salvation
[16:26] and the excitement of our spontaneous
[16:31] worship back into the church
[16:34] and into our personal lives
[16:38] that we may serve him with joy
[16:41] with gratitude and appreciation
[16:45] for our gracious and righteous
[16:48] heavenly father i praise and thank god
[16:53] for what this message has done
[16:56] and is doing around the world
[17:00] touching the hearts and lives of
[17:03] tens of thousands yeah even
[17:06] millions now
[17:10] in the midst of all this wonderful
[17:13] uh accomplishments and the things that
[17:16] are going on
[17:17] the testimonies that are being given
[17:20] they all of that yet i can see
[17:24] a horrible thing taking place
[17:29] i see the cheapening of the message
[17:34] from the time of the messenger
[17:39] of the seventh church age from the time
[17:44] of the prophet of the hour sent
[17:47] with the word of god for this day
[17:51] i can see a cheapening a devaluation
[17:55] of the message of the hour
[17:59] now what does chicken mean according to
[18:02] various
[18:03] dictionaries the word cheapen
[18:06] means to trivialize just to think the
[18:11] trivialization
[18:12] of this message is now in progress
[18:17] to the base to
[18:20] mark down
[18:23] to contaminate
[18:27] to pollute
[18:30] to make shallow
[18:34] to make skin deep so we are beginning to
[18:38] have
[18:38] a lot of skin deep believers
[18:42] with skin deep experiences
[18:45] carnal from the inside to the outside
[18:49] and really does not have this
[18:52] message within the heart the message has
[18:56] not grabbed the whole of their heart
[18:58] they say i have the holy ghost but
[19:01] really
[19:01] you have the holy ghost but does the
[19:04] holy ghost have control of you
[19:06] this is the problem here today
[19:10] oh my friends as we look
[19:14] on this problem here today this message
[19:17] is also being cheated not
[19:20] by only believers but even by
[19:24] ministers that are ministering this
[19:27] present day
[19:30] gospel message
[19:34] of the present stage of the ministry
[19:38] of our lord jesus christ
[19:42] they are adding to the word
[19:46] and some are taking away
[19:50] from the word of god as it's written in
[19:54] the scriptures in the book of matthew
[19:56] and luke particularly how that
[19:59] one day jesus said a sore went
[20:02] forth to soul and he sold his seeds
[20:07] and at night an enemy came
[20:11] in and also sowed seeds
[20:15] and when he was told that when his
[20:19] his field his seats began to grow the
[20:22] thorns and twistles were in the midst
[20:24] he said an enemy had done this
[20:28] i must say my friends it's the same
[20:30] thing that's taking place in our day
[20:33] how god sold his original word with one
[20:37] god
[20:37] water baptism in the right way the the
[20:40] conduct order and doctrine of the church
[20:43] of god
[20:44] revelation of the original sin not being
[20:47] an
[20:48] apple but being adultery in the garden
[20:52] all these various truths true
[20:55] justification
[20:56] representation condemnation
[20:59] by representation oh my friends
[21:03] all these various truths make clear to
[21:06] us
[21:07] now being forgotten lost
[21:10] cheaten by some and put away
[21:14] adding to the word and taking away
[21:18] also from the word of god
[21:21] the messages being changed for the price
[21:24] of living for this message
[21:27] the price of accepting reproach for the
[21:30] word
[21:31] is being taken away until it's becoming
[21:34] a fashionable thing
[21:35] a marvelous wonderful thing to say i'm
[21:39] in the message i'm in the gospel i'm
[21:42] in the word for the hour i follow
[21:45] the message of the hour and so it's
[21:48] being
[21:48] cheapened i'd like to speak
[21:52] now concerning one a preacher who gave
[21:55] a marvelous example of this by the name
[21:58] his name is anthony campolo
[22:02] and he said that as a as a boy
[22:06] himself and his best friend on
[22:09] uh devil's night that's the night before
[22:12] halloween
[22:13] decided to do some uh
[22:17] you know boys mischief
[22:20] and so they broke into a corner store
[22:24] not to rob not to steal not to take
[22:28] anything away just for the fact that
[22:31] they could uh cause mayhem
[22:34] they could cause confusion and chaos
[22:38] and what did they do they went in
[22:42] and changed the price tag
[22:45] now if a refrigerator or something
[22:49] costs let's say 800 dollars
[22:53] they change the price tag and place on
[22:56] it
[22:57] two dollars and if a pin or something
[23:01] else
[23:02] was valued at 50 cents
[23:05] then they will value it at five dollars
[23:09] or something like that my friend so the
[23:11] price
[23:12] that's been changed the expensive
[23:15] things were their prices were brought
[23:18] low and they cheap things
[23:22] were elevated and their prices
[23:26] were really high and
[23:29] that's the trick that satan has played
[23:32] upon the church cheapen the things of
[23:36] god
[23:37] and cause his uh his things that are
[23:41] worthless and carnal to be elevated
[23:45] in the church whether it be preachers
[23:48] whether it be believers whether it be
[23:50] whatever it is in the church that's the
[23:54] switch that satan has done
[23:57] in our day and in our time
[24:00] and so we're ending up with a an
[24:04] army of ministers membership
[24:07] and preachers we increase in numbers but
[24:10] not in the quality of the believers
[24:14] or or messengers preachers that are
[24:18] in the word of god we
[24:21] we have preachers that have the tendency
[24:24] of looking for and also trying to
[24:28] accomplish having a a get happy
[24:31] congregation
[24:33] a congregation that's so interested in
[24:36] being
[24:37] happy all the time matter of fact
[24:39] they'll send these services
[24:41] are you happy and everybody will fail
[24:45] amen and the preacher says
[24:48] everybody happy hallelujah
[24:51] the preacher will say to them oh i feel
[24:54] a whole lot of love in this room
[24:56] the people will say hey man want a
[25:00] a happy shouting congregation
[25:04] and believe that that is the
[25:06] accomplishment
[25:08] that this word of god came to do but the
[25:11] word of god
[25:12] came to ship characters the word of god
[25:16] came to change
[25:17] lies the word of god came to bring us
[25:20] back to the original
[25:22] faith that was once delivered unto the
[25:25] saints
[25:26] and so we have left the serious as the
[25:30] sobriety the reverence
[25:32] the sacredness that oozed out of the
[25:35] apostle that flowed from the prophets
[25:37] and the patriarchs
[25:39] down now to a day where we
[25:42] are actually invaded and infected
[25:46] by uh hordes of snake oil
[25:50] snakes salesmen that are
[25:53] selling the gospel instead of preaching
[25:57] the word of god
[25:58] to change hearts and transforms
[26:01] lies by the power and presence
[26:05] of almighty god you see these
[26:08] electric oil preachers
[26:12] don't really understand what the real
[26:15] move of god is
[26:19] they don't understand that a real move
[26:22] of god
[26:22] makes a lot of people unhappy
[26:27] mad convicted and sad
[26:32] before they can be made
[26:35] glad this is how the holy spirit
[26:39] of almighty god works
[26:43] but they're concentrating on making
[26:45] congregations and people happy
[26:49] these are the ones
[26:52] in this message that will pick
[26:56] it up and cause it to say
[27:00] whatever they wanted to say
[27:04] so these cure all medicine men
[27:10] these religious quack druggists
[27:15] don't realize that a real move of god
[27:19] the real move of the holy ghost
[27:21] will cause you to weep before you
[27:25] laugh and shout for joy
[27:29] for instance if we were to read which we
[27:32] will
[27:33] out of the book of ezra
[27:37] we shall read chapter 13 reading from
[27:40] verses
[27:41] 10 to 13.
[27:44] and when the builders now this is the
[27:47] return of israel
[27:50] under ezra out of babylon
[27:54] back to the land and now
[27:57] rebuilding the temple and when the
[28:00] builders had laid the foundation of the
[28:03] temple of the lord
[28:05] they set the priests in their apparel
[28:09] with trumpets and the levites
[28:13] the sons of israel with symbols
[28:17] to praise the lord after the ordinance
[28:20] of
[28:21] david king of israel and they sang
[28:25] together by course
[28:28] in praising and giving thanks to the
[28:30] lord
[28:32] because he is good and his
[28:35] mercy endureth forever
[28:38] towards israel and all the people
[28:42] shouted with a great shout
[28:45] when they praised the lord because the
[28:49] foundation of the house
[28:51] of the lord was laid
[28:54] but many of the priests levites
[28:59] and chief of the fathers who
[29:03] were ancient men
[29:06] and had seen the first house
[29:10] when the foundation of this house was
[29:13] laid before their eyes
[29:17] they wept with a loud voice
[29:21] and many shouted for joy
[29:25] so the people could not discern the
[29:27] noise of the shout
[29:29] of joy from the noise of the weeping
[29:32] of the people for the people shouted
[29:35] with a
[29:35] loud shout and the noise was heard
[29:39] afar off now here is the scenario
[29:43] how that they were laying the foundation
[29:47] of this second temple
[29:50] under their second exodus first exodus
[29:54] out of egypt second exodus out of
[29:56] babylon
[29:57] back into egypt laying the foundations
[30:00] for their second temple
[30:03] and as the foundations were being laid
[30:06] the
[30:06] people began to have a shouting and a
[30:10] joy in their hearts
[30:12] oh they were playing their musical
[30:15] instruments with their
[30:16] choirs singing in their course and they
[30:19] were giving glory and praise to
[30:22] god that god and his mercy endures
[30:26] forever
[30:27] towards israel but while they were doing
[30:30] that
[30:32] while the majority of the people were
[30:34] doing that
[30:35] there were little pockets of levites
[30:39] of these ancient or all men
[30:43] ancient fathers these ones
[30:47] chiefs elders of the people
[30:50] that were present at the time
[30:54] of the land of solomon's maybe solomon's
[30:58] temple
[30:59] and having some evidence of that house
[31:04] or the glory of that house and
[31:07] they wept and i
[31:10] would like to suggest that they wept
[31:14] because they realized that no matter how
[31:17] magnificent
[31:19] they made this temple laid the
[31:21] foundation
[31:22] no matter how beautiful and wonderful it
[31:25] was
[31:26] ichabod was written across the doorpost
[31:29] of the
[31:30] for former temple the glory of god has
[31:34] departed
[31:35] my friends no matter what your
[31:37] institution how beautiful you're
[31:38] building how
[31:39] big your building how many thousands may
[31:43] follow you if the glory of the lord is
[31:46] departed
[31:47] you may be a wonderful speaker a
[31:49] marvelously trained man
[31:52] you may have it within your heart all
[31:54] sincerity
[31:55] but if the glory is departed if the
[31:58] presence of god
[31:59] is departed from his house my friends
[32:02] if we are here but he is not here then
[32:06] it
[32:06] is no use for us being here oh
[32:09] think of that contrast one group
[32:13] rejoicing and shouting and the
[32:16] other group that knew the original
[32:20] were weeping and the bible says they are
[32:24] weeping loudly and so my friends even
[32:27] today
[32:29] we hear folks speaking about pentecost
[32:32] we hear them speaking about the presence
[32:35] of the
[32:36] god in the church but they have no idea
[32:40] of those original days
[32:43] you say do you yes i do i
[32:46] was around the time when it was just
[32:50] drifting away i came at the tail end of
[32:54] it when the presence and power of
[32:57] god was still being displayed
[33:00] spontaneously
[33:02] when the clouds of glory will pass above
[33:05] the congregation
[33:07] while they were praising giving glory
[33:10] and honor to god
[33:11] all friends not reading it in a book not
[33:14] hearing about it
[33:16] but absolutely experiencing
[33:19] god in this supernatural way when
[33:22] no folk could not just walk into the
[33:25] church
[33:26] just like that ah that's all right but
[33:29] if they were
[33:30] demon possessed if they were in any kind
[33:34] of state of that nature
[33:35] those those wicked spirits would have to
[33:40] leave them
[33:41] in the house of the living god not
[33:43] because somebody said
[33:45] that they have the power to cast out
[33:46] devils it happens spontaneously
[33:50] under the presence and the anointing of
[33:52] the
[33:53] holy spirit by the by the dedicated
[33:57] consecrated lines of holiness of god's
[34:00] people
[34:01] and the saturation of
[34:04] prayer and fasting and surrender
[34:08] soul surrender to the living god
[34:11] and the destruction of of a
[34:14] carnality from among the saints of god
[34:17] and they live to let the sword of the
[34:20] word of god
[34:21] bring death to self and life of jesus
[34:25] christ
[34:25] to be manifest within their hearts
[34:29] and lives amen so a real move of god
[34:34] will make people unhappy
[34:37] convicted mad or
[34:40] sad before it will make them happy
[34:44] or glad and so
[34:47] these crack druggists
[34:52] these cure all medicine men
[34:56] will say anything do anything sway in
[34:59] any direction
[35:01] as long as they can have a crowd as long
[35:04] as they can have a
[35:05] mass meeting as long as their names can
[35:09] be
[35:09] lit up in lights as long as
[35:12] they they can have their names written
[35:16] on books and papers and
[35:19] their names to be elevated they don't
[35:22] seek the shadows anymore
[35:24] they don't seek my friends the humility
[35:26] of the spirit anymore
[35:28] the simplicity of god anymore they seek
[35:31] the
[35:32] they seek the spotlight they seek my
[35:34] friends
[35:35] all the bright lights the fame is the
[35:38] name
[35:39] of the game in this day and in
[35:42] this hour in which we are living i place
[35:45] i i would like to put it to you that a
[35:48] lot of them
[35:49] are suffering from eye trouble because
[35:51] everything is i
[35:53] i i i i you might as well say
[35:56] yeah oh lord help us father
[36:00] they have eye trouble and may the holy
[36:03] spirit
[36:04] give you i serve to take away your eye
[36:08] trouble
[36:09] that you may be able to recognize the
[36:12] word of god for your day the message for
[36:15] your day
[36:16] and surrender and fully submit yourself
[36:19] to christ
[36:20] and get away from this shallow cheap
[36:24] thing called modern day christianity
[36:27] here upon us oh glory to god hallelujah
[36:31] so these priests wept because they
[36:34] realized
[36:36] everything was cheap and shallow
[36:40] you realize that was a shouting of joy
[36:44] without knowledge
[36:46] that was a rejoicing without revelation
[36:50] the people were shouting at what they
[36:52] really didn't
[36:53] know or really never experienced before
[36:57] they had not seen the glory of the
[36:59] former house
[37:01] and here they were rejoicing at the
[37:04] laying
[37:04] of this second house not that we blame
[37:07] them for doing that for they
[37:09] didn't know any better but these older
[37:13] men that recognized they could discern
[37:16] the deterioration
[37:18] the rottenness the corruption that was
[37:21] creeping into the body
[37:23] of politic the body of israel and the
[37:26] body of
[37:27] christ today we see that creeping in
[37:30] completely in it you see it creeping in
[37:33] into our church
[37:35] worship services cheap shallow
[37:38] worship cheap behavior church behavior
[37:43] before service during the services
[37:47] after the services and a loss of
[37:51] reverence in the house of god
[37:54] i am not talking about street uh strict
[37:58] legalism as if you are in a
[38:02] a school that the school room and you're
[38:05] dominated over
[38:07] by a fearsome school master my friends
[38:10] but being in the sacred presence of god
[38:14] uh the holiness of god will make you one
[38:17] of
[38:17] us moses take your shoes from off your
[38:21] feet for the ground on which your stand
[38:24] is
[38:25] holy ground god was god's spirit the
[38:28] presence
[38:29] of the genuine anointed of god makes you
[38:32] feel unworthy
[38:33] makes you feel ashamed of yourself oh
[38:36] but i've not not done anything wrong my
[38:38] friends
[38:39] never mind in your heart if you can go
[38:43] through your life and think you have not
[38:45] done anything wrong you never said
[38:47] anything wrong
[38:48] you never thought anything wrong you
[38:50] never acted in anything wrong
[38:52] and you cannot remember or 100
[38:55] you don't know if you ever come into a
[38:58] genuine presence of the great holy
[39:01] spirit
[39:02] with his awesome divine presence without
[39:06] any human knowledge you will find
[39:10] yourself feeling inadequate unworthy
[39:14] you will even feel unholy and unclean
[39:17] in the presence of god oh and want to
[39:21] humble and surrender yourself to god and
[39:24] cry out and ask him for his mercy
[39:28] his grace and his love my
[39:31] friends even their
[39:34] after services
[39:38] is terrible and it's also a proof
[39:43] of this modern day cheapening of the
[39:46] message
[39:48] of this god smell
[39:52] cheap no more
[39:56] glowing embers after the worship
[40:00] services are over
[40:03] no more real after blow
[40:06] at the elders no more
[40:10] calls of fire when we come to the
[40:13] end of our meetings you understand what
[40:17] i'm talking about
[40:18] you come to if you were to go on a camp
[40:21] uh you you went to camping out in the
[40:25] wilds
[40:26] and you had your tent and you let your
[40:28] campfire
[40:29] after a while later in the night or
[40:32] evening the
[40:33] the fire will go down and all that will
[40:36] be
[40:36] left will be glowing embers
[40:39] glowing in the dark until you put them
[40:43] out yourself completely for natural
[40:46] safety reasons for the forest
[40:48] but my friends spiritually now speaking
[40:52] after the meetings are over
[40:55] that sacredness that sincerity
[40:58] that love of god that grip the hearts of
[41:01] true believers
[41:03] it's beings lost it's being leaked out
[41:07] let's go it's going away amen yes sir
[41:11] because what there is no afterglow
[41:14] there is no glowing embers that's
[41:17] left in these meetings the meeting ends
[41:21] and the church sometimes becomes a roar
[41:24] of conversation
[41:26] some are weeping at the altar
[41:30] others are crying some are praying
[41:35] seeking god seeking him for the holy
[41:38] ghost
[41:40] and while they're doing that there's
[41:42] this buzz
[41:44] of conversation going on
[41:48] where one can hardly concentrate
[41:51] or meditate in the presence of god
[41:55] it reveals shallowness within
[41:58] our churches and within our worship
[42:03] oh friends after a real holy ghost
[42:06] meeting
[42:07] in the presence of god there is always
[42:11] these
[42:11] glowing mem embers
[42:15] a fire that remain in the hearts of
[42:19] believers
[42:20] long after that these meetings have been
[42:23] declared ended oh
[42:27] yes congregations in this
[42:30] hour concentrating
[42:34] on having financially
[42:37] well-off contribute contributors
[42:42] many of them that are
[42:45] educated pagans
[42:49] baptized but pagans
[42:53] in the presence of god religious sinners
[42:59] lukewarm backsliders
[43:03] that are elevated in position and
[43:06] presence
[43:08] in the house of god while the poor
[43:11] are pushed to the back or pushed away
[43:14] are suppressed in every possible way
[43:19] many of these are rebellious
[43:23] self-willed disloyal
[43:27] and these are they that will use their
[43:31] presence power of their personality
[43:33] power their purse
[43:37] to undermine the kingdom of god
[43:41] to divide the house of god
[43:46] and to be so ungrateful many a preacher
[43:50] has seen himself
[43:54] preach the gospel counsel speak to
[43:58] certain ones and marriages that were
[44:02] about to be broken to pieces
[44:05] or was already broken and god
[44:08] used that faithful man of god to bring
[44:11] things together again or
[44:15] lies that were wasted
[44:19] and the preacher takes them under his
[44:22] wings
[44:23] points them in the right direction their
[44:26] lies are cleaned up when they begin to
[44:29] prosper and grow within their
[44:33] walk and soon many of these
[44:37] walk away in gratitude the sin
[44:40] of ingratitude is very
[44:44] prevalent amongst the people of god
[44:48] my friends i think that we are not to
[44:51] ask
[44:52] is everybody happy now they ought
[44:55] not to be that kind if they're living
[44:58] like that they are not to be made to
[45:00] feel happy
[45:02] they ought to feel the conviction of the
[45:05] holy spirit
[45:06] as preachers preach the genuine gospel
[45:09] to cut away at the
[45:13] circumcise the fleshliness from the
[45:16] hearts of men
[45:17] and bring them back to the presence
[45:20] of almighty god and introduce them
[45:23] to this person of jesus christ the same
[45:27] yesterday today and for uh and forever
[45:32] both minister and believers
[45:35] both people and priests many are
[45:38] shallow in the word and shallow in their
[45:41] experience with god many of god's people
[45:47] don't read their bible and pray every
[45:50] day
[45:50] and seek his blessed face
[45:54] they would repent they would
[45:58] turn away from their sins and from their
[46:00] habits
[46:01] that rather to hide them they rather to
[46:04] cloak them
[46:05] they rather to keep them away from the
[46:08] from the people of god not knowing where
[46:10] they can pray for them
[46:12] that's the kind of lies that we see
[46:16] within the body of jesus christ
[46:20] but i'm going to read now out of
[46:24] ezekiel chapter 22
[46:27] a remarkable passage which you ought to
[46:31] open your bible ezekiel
[46:34] chapter 22 and read along with me
[46:37] from verse 24.
[46:40] in verse 18 son of man the house of
[46:43] israel
[46:44] is to me become dross
[46:49] all they are like brass
[46:53] and tin and iron
[46:57] and lead in the midst of the furnace
[47:02] they are even the dross of silver
[47:05] and now over to verse 24
[47:09] son of man i say unto her
[47:12] israel thou art a land that is not
[47:15] cleansed
[47:16] now i'm speaking to the church of god
[47:20] thou art a land that is not cleansed
[47:25] nor reigned upon
[47:28] in the day of indignation
[47:32] there is a conspiracy or an
[47:35] unspoken understanding a conspiracy
[47:39] of our prophets or preachers
[47:42] in the midst thereof like
[47:45] roaring lions
[47:48] ravening the prey they
[47:52] have devoured souls
[47:56] they have taken the treasure
[47:59] that's what they're interested in they
[48:02] have taken
[48:03] the treasure now this is not me
[48:06] this is in your bible this is god
[48:09] speaking
[48:10] i'm bringing it up to our modern day and
[48:12] age
[48:13] and applying it to our day and the
[48:16] characters
[48:17] that are on the stage of life at this
[48:20] particular time
[48:21] think of it they have taken the treasure
[48:25] and the precious things they have made
[48:28] her
[48:29] many widows in the midst
[48:33] our priests her priests
[48:37] have violated my law
[48:40] and have profaned
[48:44] my holy things they have put
[48:48] no difference between
[48:51] the holy and the profane
[48:54] or unholy no difference the lines have
[48:58] become blurred
[49:00] between truth and error between
[49:03] godliness and ungodliness
[49:07] between the christian and the
[49:11] non-christian the believer
[49:12] and the unbeliever they have blurred the
[49:16] lines
[49:16] because of making things so acceptable
[49:20] and comfortable that these unclean
[49:23] birds and spirits can find a resting
[49:26] place
[49:27] right within the branches of the very
[49:29] church of god
[49:31] they have put no difference between the
[49:33] holy and the profane
[49:36] neither have they showed difference
[49:40] between the unclean and they clean
[49:45] and have hid their eyes
[49:49] from my sabbaths
[49:52] and i am profane amongst them even god
[49:56] himself
[49:57] is profaned they curse and blaspheme his
[50:01] name
[50:02] they swear in his name
[50:05] using his name in vain and god is
[50:09] speaking out of this word
[50:10] how ungodly this is
[50:14] her princes in the midst thereof
[50:17] are like wolves ravening
[50:20] the prey to shed blood
[50:24] and to destroy souls
[50:27] and to get this honest
[50:30] gain tell any lie
[50:33] do any deal
[50:37] anything whatsoever
[50:40] to grow and prosper and develop some
[50:43] huge marvelous so-called ministry
[50:49] or monastery
[50:52] and her prophets have dobbed them
[50:57] with untempered moth murder
[51:02] seeing vanity and divining lies
[51:08] god hasn't spoken to them but they're
[51:11] seeing all kinds of vanities
[51:13] and divining lies
[51:17] unto them saying thus saith the lord
[51:20] when the lord had
[51:22] not spoken they're using god's name in
[51:24] vain
[51:25] saying the lord told me this and the
[51:27] lord told me that
[51:28] the lord says this is going to happen
[51:30] whether in september november or october
[51:33] and god has not told them that
[51:36] for the lord has not spoken
[51:40] the people of the land have used
[51:43] oppression
[51:45] to oppress the poor oppressed the dumb
[51:48] trodden who were already
[51:50] down but they pressed them down further
[51:52] oppressed
[51:54] and they exercised robbery
[51:58] and have vexed the poor and needy why
[52:01] they're robbing them
[52:02] of their wages robbing them of anything
[52:05] they can rob them
[52:07] because they're not smart they're not
[52:08] wise and they believe
[52:10] that that gives them the right not to
[52:12] tell them what their rights are
[52:14] not to tell them what they genuinely
[52:17] earn
[52:17] but to steal from them to rob them and
[52:20] to oppress them
[52:22] and take away from them what is theirs
[52:25] in the name of prophets and then call
[52:28] themselves
[52:29] prophets now my friends they have
[52:32] also oppressed the stranger wrongfully
[52:37] and i sought for a man among them
[52:41] that will make up the hedge and stand in
[52:45] the gap before me
[52:47] for the land for the church
[52:51] that i should not destroy it
[52:54] but i found none
[52:58] all my friends think of it
[53:01] shallow in the word
[53:05] shallow in supernatural
[53:09] experience god's people
[53:12] won't repent today's baptism
[53:17] of the holy spirit or the reception of
[53:20] the holy
[53:20] ghost is so shallow
[53:24] and cheap for many
[53:27] young people come to the altar
[53:32] have hands laid on them prayer made over
[53:34] them and
[53:35] soon there they're they're shivering and
[53:38] shouting
[53:38] and then somebody's you got it you've
[53:40] got the holy ghost
[53:42] oh my and shortly
[53:45] after that meeting is over they got the
[53:48] holy ghost
[53:50] and they leave that meeting with all
[53:52] manner of
[53:53] laughter and frivolous jokes and
[53:56] head right over to the nearest burger
[53:59] joint
[54:00] or off to somewhere for boxes of pizza
[54:05] or buckets of fried chicken
[54:08] the mind is no more on god or their mind
[54:11] is no more
[54:12] on what the holy spirit did for them
[54:16] but friends that's not the holy ghost
[54:19] i'm talking about that's not the holy
[54:20] spirit i know
[54:22] the great holy spirit when he really
[54:25] genuinely gets a hold of you my friends
[54:29] for it never leaves you for
[54:32] days for weeks maybe for months maybe
[54:37] forever it will never leave you
[54:40] but that high atmosphere
[54:43] when you first receive the holy spirit
[54:46] it will
[54:46] linger for a long time upon your
[54:49] life and for days if not for weeks
[54:53] you feel as if you're walking on air or
[54:56] in the air why because your soul
[55:00] is living in a heavenly place
[55:03] under his shadow of his wings
[55:06] of the great holy spirit here is his
[55:09] young one
[55:10] that has just come in and he overshadows
[55:13] them
[55:13] with his great and mighty wings
[55:17] that kind of a holy ghost when he comes
[55:20] upon you
[55:21] it takes some time for you to become
[55:25] adjusted
[55:26] to to the atmosphere the presence and
[55:29] even the
[55:30] natural feeling of him
[55:33] upon your natural flesh my friends
[55:36] it's so sacred and holy in the presence
[55:40] of the living god i tell you friends
[55:42] that kind of holy spirit
[55:44] doesn't change you and then yeah
[55:47] all you're looking for is for the next
[55:50] camp meeting
[55:51] my friends this kind of a holy spirit
[55:54] when he indwells you and possesses you
[55:58] it's going to stay with you and change
[56:00] your life for
[56:02] all time and for all eternity
[56:07] we see this cheating and shallowness
[56:11] and it can be seen in
[56:14] the easy backsliding
[56:17] with our members within our churches
[56:22] they're coming quickly and
[56:25] out the doors quickly oh
[56:29] they say well it's your fault you did
[56:31] not go to the theological seminary
[56:34] to learn the appropriate science
[56:37] and system of assimilation of how to
[56:41] hold and keep and entrap
[56:44] uh the people within the
[56:47] the church within the body of christ my
[56:50] friends these things are actually being
[56:52] taught
[56:52] i don't know that jesus taught that to
[56:54] his disciples i don't think the apostles
[56:56] were teaching that to their believers
[56:58] but my friends i believe the magnet of
[57:01] the word of god
[57:02] when jesus said if i be lifted up i'll
[57:05] draw
[57:05] all men unto myself but we will help the
[57:09] lord along
[57:10] we want to help him a little marketing a
[57:13] little bit of promotion
[57:14] we want to help him a little bit of this
[57:16] psychology and science
[57:18] of assimilation and how we can
[57:21] proliferate the gospel
[57:23] using man-made wisdom and
[57:26] man-made means my friend this is what is
[57:30] happening
[57:31] in our day and time and no wonder
[57:34] we have all these mighty numbers
[57:38] of believers but the quality is
[57:41] not there anymore because the christians
[57:45] have become so cheap cheap cheap we have
[57:48] chicken christians that are so cheap
[57:52] think of it my friends
[57:56] the liberty i
[57:59] usually call this stock market
[58:02] christians also
[58:04] these are they that buy into the church
[58:07] or the movement
[58:09] while it's riding high while that
[58:13] pastor is well known once he is not
[58:16] criticized
[58:18] once no one brings any uh any
[58:21] besmirching
[58:22] his reputation or launch any uh
[58:26] campaign of gossip against him oh
[58:29] my friends once he is like that
[58:32] then oh he rides high in their
[58:36] estimation
[58:37] and they're ready to buy into that
[58:39] program and to assist them to volunteer
[58:42] and to support
[58:43] and to sing and acquire and to give
[58:45] solos and to
[58:47] do everything possible but the moment
[58:50] they have the first smell of any
[58:53] kind of a problem coming up in that
[58:56] group that church
[58:57] or with that particular person that's
[59:01] preaching
[59:01] leading them in the gospel
[59:05] of jesus christ they sell out and they
[59:08] are gone what a day my friends
[59:12] in which we live with these kinds of
[59:15] stock market christians
[59:17] that are watching everything on every
[59:20] hand
[59:20] they won't stand for anything amen
[59:24] they won't stand for anything they're
[59:26] always on the borderline
[59:28] borderline christians where where they
[59:30] can place their foot on
[59:32] one side oh and quickly slip on the
[59:35] other side
[59:36] if there's a change in fortunes or a
[59:39] story was told many
[59:40] years ago how down in the old south in
[59:44] the united states
[59:46] there was one soldier that thought he
[59:49] was smart
[59:51] that he would just kind of
[59:54] desert but not really
[59:57] because he thought he would be safer
[1:00:00] during the war
[1:00:01] if he placed on a blue
[1:00:05] jacket of the northern troops
[1:00:09] and the grey bottoms of the confederacy
[1:00:15] oh he felt neither side would
[1:00:18] take a shot at him and
[1:00:21] to his surprise he got shot
[1:00:25] in the chest with his blue uniform and
[1:00:28] he got
[1:00:29] shot in the you know what in his gray
[1:00:32] bottoms my friends that is the case with
[1:00:36] a lot of believers today you can't play
[1:00:40] both sides
[1:00:41] you've got to make your choice you've
[1:00:44] got to decide
[1:00:45] who you will serve if you're on the
[1:00:47] lord's side
[1:00:49] then serve the lord and if you be on the
[1:00:52] world
[1:00:52] or be else sign then go serve
[1:00:56] mammon sir bill some other god but if
[1:00:59] you're on the lord's
[1:01:00] side stand for jesus stand for the word
[1:01:03] and he will stand for you oh hold to
[1:01:07] god's unchanging hand and this great

[1:05:42] a lack of holiness
[1:05:45] ministers are falling left and right on
[1:05:48] every hand
[1:05:49] i'm not talking about rumors about
[1:05:52] ministers because a minister can be
[1:05:55] absolutely
[1:05:56] 100 pure and walking living his life
[1:06:00] oh and someone spreads a rumor
[1:06:04] tells a lie and that lie will
[1:06:08] move across the land faster than the
[1:06:11] truth
[1:06:12] and that man is marked
[1:06:16] and black his name batten his reputation
[1:06:19] blackened
[1:06:21] and it's no use in making any
[1:06:23] explanation
[1:06:24] he just leaves it alone and let it go
[1:06:27] because it'll just be worse
[1:06:29] god will take care of it don't worry
[1:06:32] about it
[1:06:33] god will take care of it for touch
[1:06:36] my anointed and do my prophets no harm
[1:06:40] god help you to fall into the hands
[1:06:43] of an angry god ministers are fallen
[1:06:47] left and right you've read the stories
[1:06:50] you've seen them
[1:06:51] in the newspapers you read it on the
[1:06:54] internet
[1:06:55] even recently you're seeing examples of
[1:06:57] it men of high station
[1:07:00] men of great reputation oh
[1:07:03] god help us when leaders
[1:07:07] and men of god find themselves
[1:07:10] in these situations not only find
[1:07:12] themselves many of them are drawn away
[1:07:14] by their own lusts
[1:07:16] many of them are drawn away by their own
[1:07:18] desires
[1:07:19] and this is what's happened memberships
[1:07:21] are fallen
[1:07:22] and standards are fallen oh my friends
[1:07:26] no true holiness being produced anymore
[1:07:30] and i'm afraid that in our day instead
[1:07:33] of following in the footsteps of our
[1:07:35] lord jesus christ
[1:07:37] who turned the water into wine i believe
[1:07:41] many preachers are turning the wine into
[1:07:44] water
[1:07:45] and cheapening the entire effects of the
[1:07:48] gospel
[1:07:49] and the power of the word of god with
[1:07:52] its stimulative effects
[1:07:54] to change and transform the lives of
[1:07:57] people
[1:07:57] and to heal their them heal their
[1:08:00] bodies minds and spirits
[1:08:04] awaiting a cheating
[1:08:08] a sense of a watering down
[1:08:11] of the that which is real and true
[1:08:15] in the house and presence of god
[1:08:19] waxing less and less of the presence
[1:08:23] of the supernatural oh
[1:08:26] blessed be the name of the lord my
[1:08:28] friends i believe
[1:08:30] i'm going to not rush this
[1:08:33] or push this any further i am going to
[1:08:37] go into the third part of this message
[1:08:41] next sunday if the lord is willing
[1:08:44] and will allow me i will go into a third
[1:08:46] part
[1:08:47] but right now i feel that i should now
[1:08:51] uh ease this down and
[1:08:54] cease now and just come to a place where
[1:08:58] we bring this
[1:08:59] to an end for today may you feel the
[1:09:02] after effects
[1:09:03] and the after glow of this meeting go
[1:09:06] tell it on the mountains tell it
[1:09:09] everywhere
[1:09:11] tell them about this glorious gospel
[1:09:14] that you have been hearing that won't
[1:09:18] just make you
[1:09:19] laugh or feel happy but it'll challenge
[1:09:23] you
[1:09:23] it'll convict you it'll make you see
[1:09:27] yourself whether you be a saint or a
[1:09:29] sinner
[1:09:30] or an unbeliever and come to attention
[1:09:34] of their word of god thank you my
[1:09:36] friends
[1:09:37] for listening many will have turned off
[1:09:41] their computers
[1:09:42] or turned away from something like this
[1:09:45] it's not smooth enough it's not polished
[1:09:47] it's not professional enough
[1:09:49] it's not beautiful enough it's not with
[1:09:52] the lecture
[1:09:53] ability that they expect because these
[1:09:56] so-called
[1:09:57] uh many pharisees and sadducees
[1:10:00] have created this uh unreal
[1:10:03] picture of what a man of god should be
[1:10:06] even in the times of jesus and we will
[1:10:09] speak on these things
[1:10:10] later but for now god bless you my
[1:10:13] friends

[1:10:37] come down upon it
[1:10:38] anoint it and use it and that what we're
[1:10:42] trying to do here
[1:10:43] will spread like wildfire
[1:10:47] around the world into homes and hearts
[1:10:50] and lives and nations
