[0:14] praise the lord
[0:16] praise be to god good evening friends
[0:21] once again we are here in the presence
[0:25] of the lord
[0:27] and we are asking
[0:30] and desiring his august presence
[0:34] and the blessed anointing
[0:38] of the holy spirit of almighty god
[0:42] may the lord bless his word today as
[0:45] we read from the book of revelation
[0:49] chapter 1 verse 16
[0:52] and he had in his
[0:55] right hand seven stars
[1:00] and out of his mouth went
[1:03] a sharp to edged sword
[1:07] and his countenance was
[1:10] as the sun shinet
[1:15] in his strength god bless
[1:18] us god bless his precious and
[1:22] wonderful words
[1:26] now in our last teaching on the
[1:29] seven church ages we
[1:33] emphasize the fact
[1:36] of this seven-fold glory
[1:39] of the person
[1:42] of jesus christ now
[1:46] uh we were only able to
[1:49] touch on four
[1:52] brilliant facets of this
[1:55] great diamond of his
[1:58] personage today
[2:01] we will speak on
[2:04] the other three parts
[2:08] of this and praying that god
[2:12] will bless us together
[2:15] now as the scriptures have said
[2:18] in revelation 1 16
[2:23] and he had in his right hand
[2:27] seven stars of course we
[2:30] are aware that the right hand of god
[2:34] symbolizes the right hand of
[2:37] power the right hand of deliverance the
[2:40] right hand of redemption
[2:42] it speaks of god's great omnipotence
[2:48] and in his right hand of his omnipotence
[2:52] and his glorious mighty power
[2:56] the bible graphically
[3:00] shows him having these
[3:04] seven stars in
[3:07] a mini universe
[3:10] in his right hand shining as they were
[3:16] in his right hand now this is no
[3:19] secret or mystery for
[3:22] in verse 20. he
[3:25] interprets this for us and
[3:29] tells us clearly and the mystery
[3:33] of the seven stars are the
[3:36] angels or messengers of the
[3:40] seven churches we could not mistake this
[3:44] for the lord himself interprets it for
[3:47] us
[3:48] not according to me not according to you
[3:52] not according to any man's theology but
[3:55] according to
[3:56] this word of god he says these
[3:59] are the seven messengers or seven
[4:03] angels that he sent to the
[4:07] seven churches and as we know
[4:11] seven messengers seven
[4:15] sent to seven successive
[4:18] church ages one of them sent
[4:22] to each age god using them
[4:26] the first one coming first of all
[4:29] for to the ephesian church
[4:32] age and right on down
[4:36] to the laodicean or last
[4:39] church age when time for the church ages
[4:44] will be over now each messenger
[4:48] brought his message as it was revealed
[4:52] to
[4:53] him to his particular
[4:57] church age and when he
[5:00] received that revelation that messenger
[5:04] was absolutely and totally
[5:07] loyal to the message given to him
[5:12] directly from the presence of god
[5:16] now as each uh church age
[5:19] began to pull away or wander away
[5:24] from god's word began
[5:27] to be seduced by the workings of satan
[5:33] then god as we have said before
[5:37] never leaves himself without a witness
[5:40] and so god sent a
[5:44] faithful messenger to that church age
[5:49] and usually the messenger comes towards
[5:52] the very
[5:53] ending of that church age
[5:57] for what he is trying to do as he comes
[6:00] with his message
[6:02] is attempting under divine
[6:05] direction and under sealed
[6:08] holy ghost orders from the presence of
[6:11] god
[6:12] is to return the people back to the word
[6:17] is to bring god's sheep back to the fold
[6:22] it's to feed them a fresh
[6:25] taste of the bread of life to
[6:28] open their appetite not for
[6:31] any kind of false falsities
[6:35] or or things that are fake but
[6:38] give them a real taste of the true bread
[6:42] of life
[6:43] and draw them back to the original
[6:46] word of god now of course these
[6:49] messengers
[6:50] coming on the scene each one had to face
[6:53] some form of opposition in his day
[6:57] for jesus had already prophesied i will
[7:01] build my church and the gates
[7:05] of hell shall not prevail against it
[7:10] which is to say he anticipated and
[7:13] prophesied
[7:14] opposition to the true church of the
[7:17] living god
[7:19] but thanks be to god he says that
[7:22] gates of hell shall not prevail
[7:26] they're assured of
[7:29] are assured of the presence of god
[7:33] with them to fulfill his word
[7:36] now this is where i would say where did
[7:39] they get their strength from
[7:41] their strength come from the lord just
[7:44] as much
[7:45] as our strength comes from the lord we
[7:48] look to the hills from whence cometh
[7:52] our help not the mount natural mountains
[7:55] but the hills of god amen we
[7:58] are strength cometh from the lord the
[8:01] creator
[8:02] of heaven and of earth so
[8:05] their strength coming from the lord they
[8:08] were fearless
[8:10] they were safe in his
[8:14] care and in his arms
[8:17] and nothing could pluck them out of his
[8:21] mighty hand nothing my
[8:24] friends could separate them
[8:27] from the love of the living god
[8:31] whether it be sickness while in the
[8:34] pathway and
[8:35] of duty and of service sickness
[8:38] could not separate them from the
[8:41] love of god the problems that paul had
[8:45] with his
[8:46] eyes could not separate him
[8:49] from the love of god peril
[8:53] jail time nakedness
[8:56] one coat famine these
[9:20] find the easy way the easy so-called
[9:24] successful ministry
[9:26] these men wandered in sheepskins goat
[9:29] skins
[9:30] they wandered in caves in the wilderness
[9:33] in the deserts in the mountains
[9:35] and would swoop down like the eagles of
[9:38] god
[9:39] upon the population of civilization
[9:42] and preach thus saith the lord god
[9:46] and after their message returned back to
[9:49] the deserts so that their minds were not
[9:52] framed shaped or
[9:53] influenced by the various ideas
[9:57] and propositions of man but they stood
[10:01] firmly upon the pure word of
[10:04] god with change at not
[10:07] think of my it my friends they were so
[10:11] yielded to him and kept by his divine
[10:15] omnipotence they were not concerned
[10:18] and worried too much about persecution
[10:21] that came
[10:21] their way they were not worried by
[10:25] physical pain and by mental
[10:28] duration of men because
[10:31] in this they found the cause for
[10:34] glorying in the lord hallelujah
[10:38] oh my friends crowler glory to
[10:41] god i bear in my body paul said the
[10:45] marks of jesus christ they were like the
[10:48] stripes
[10:49] of a sergeant or a general
[10:53] recognizing that these were the marks of
[10:56] his
[10:56] general ship and his position
[10:59] in the in the church of god
[11:03] in the plan and economy
[11:07] of god he recognized
[11:10] his position and born with pride
[11:15] those marks that others will call
[11:18] marks of shame but to him they were
[11:22] marks of the glory of god upon
[11:26] his life as gods used him and they
[11:29] found themselves feeling worthy
[11:33] to suffer for him and
[11:36] for that glorious name jesus
[11:40] i say it again for that marvelous name
[11:43] jesus for that wonderful name
[11:46] jesus for there is no other name given
[11:50] under heaven whereby we must be saved
[11:53] but the name of jesus christ in whose
[11:57] name we
[11:58] baptize and are baptized into the holy
[12:02] spirit
[12:02] and in water uh in obedience to the
[12:06] word of god hallelujah amen
[12:10] my friends they were so thankful
[12:14] as each of us should be thankful
[12:17] that we were chosen selected by god
[12:22] called by the lord god to serve him
[12:26] as honored vessels to
[12:29] bring glory and honor to
[12:32] his name and in that state of
[12:36] thankfulness
[12:37] they were willing to burn out their life
[12:41] with zeal
[12:42] and become shining glorious lights
[12:46] carrying the torch of life their word of
[12:49] god which lightens the pathway of
[12:53] any man or woman that seeks to
[12:56] know the lord god hallelujah and
[13:00] burning with the light of his divine
[13:02] presence within their life
[13:04] oh praise god they reflected the
[13:08] personality
[13:09] they reflected the very virtues
[13:13] of jesus christ emanated and flowed out
[13:17] from their
[13:18] lives like a mighty streams of light
[13:22] rainbow-colored powers of god flowing
[13:25] through them
[13:26] to bless the multitudes to whom
[13:29] they were sent oh may god bless us
[13:32] individually in this fashion that we may
[13:36] be those who are emanating
[13:39] the uh influence of another person
[13:44] oh this supernatural being
[13:47] the great almighty god choosing
[13:51] a humble vessel or humble
[13:54] vessels with in which to show himself
[13:58] god hiding in simplicity revealing
[14:02] and reflecting his personality
[14:05] right through those messengers as he
[14:09] wants to do
[14:10] through your life here today if you are
[14:14] willing to surrender to him
[14:16] and walk in obedience and of his word
[14:20] and in thankfulness for his life
[14:23] in you his love his patience
[14:26] his meekness his temperance gentleness
[14:29] his faithfulness godliness within our
[14:32] lives
[14:33] to reflect the virtues of god out of
[14:36] our lives no wonder we love to sing
[14:40] the old song to be like
[14:44] jesus to be like jesus
[14:48] on earth i long to be
[14:51] like him all true lies
[14:54] journey from earth to glory
[14:57] i only ask to be like him
[15:01] may this be our desires here today
[15:04] to be like jesus in all our heart
[15:07] and in all our life lives
[15:11] and because they so surrendered
[15:14] uh themselves and walked in obedience to
[15:18] the word of god
[15:19] god backed them up oh may the holy
[15:22] spirit back up our words back up our
[15:26] lies
[15:26] back up everything we do and say oh
[15:30] praise god hallelujah i want you to just
[15:33] think on the word
[15:34] back up amen right there i will not
[15:37] expand on it
[15:38] but think of god backing you up
[15:41] and what it means to be backed up by
[15:44] god god standing beside before
[15:48] and behind you makes you fearless
[15:52] makes you bold with the gospel of jesus
[15:55] christ
[15:56] knowing that like a great mighty eagle
[15:59] on the mountain top while her young ones
[16:02] are feeding down in the valley but
[16:05] whatever they were feeding on
[16:08] if any wild beasts or beasts of the wild
[16:11] would seek to come to worry them
[16:15] or make them fearful or to pounce upon
[16:19] them
[16:19] with her eagle eyes she's looking upon
[16:22] them
[16:23] and she'll swoop down with those mighty
[16:26] wings
[16:27] to defend them and to lift them
[16:30] up where they belong oh thanks be to god
[16:34] what a comfort to
[16:36] know that his eye is on the sparrow
[16:39] and he watches over me oh my friends
[16:43] no matter what you may be going through
[16:47] no matter what may come in your life
[16:50] i want you to have this blessed
[16:53] assurance
[16:55] that there is an eye watching
[16:58] over you with tender love and care
[17:02] god will back up his own
[17:06] thanks be to god oh think of it
[17:10] god backed them up with signs and
[17:12] wonders
[17:14] god backed them up with miracles
[17:18] god backed them up with his divine
[17:21] presence with them they
[17:24] were accused of being fanatics
[17:28] and any true believer that honestly
[17:31] truly
[17:32] follows the word of god they will
[17:35] want to call you also a fanatic
[17:39] but my friends realize this that you
[17:42] are being numbered with that glorious
[17:46] number of those who have gone before
[17:49] they were called and announced by the
[17:53] organized religions of that day
[17:57] the religions of that day sought to
[18:00] destroy them denounce them in
[18:03] every possible way they were
[18:06] mocked they were scuffed at
[18:10] most of them fishermen shepherds
[18:14] men that might not be punished
[18:17] men that may not have uh extreme
[18:20] education or or any education could not
[18:24] properly read and write their their
[18:27] names
[18:28] there were some that were kings some
[18:30] that were
[18:31] great intellectuals and there were
[18:35] others that were just regular people
[18:38] from the street corners of what god uses
[18:42] whomsoever he wills and anoints
[18:45] them with the holy spirit and uses them
[18:49] for his glory and for his honor but the
[18:52] main thing about it
[18:54] they kept to the word of god true to the
[18:57] word
[18:58] they held to god's unchanging hand
[19:01] and in response god held them
[19:05] in his hands oh many say i've got the
[19:08] holy ghost but i think
[19:10] it's a greater and more wonderful thing
[19:13] to be know that the holy ghost has a
[19:16] hold of you
[19:17] and that you are kept by the power of
[19:20] god
[19:21] through faith in his word hallelujah
[19:24] amen it's not too hard to keep
[19:28] holding on to some creed
[19:31] or to keep true to a feed a creed
[19:35] because it's easy when the devil
[19:38] is back of you giving you of his wealth
[19:42] giving you of his fame giving you of his
[19:45] name
[19:45] he did this with eve appealed to the
[19:48] pride of life
[19:49] a appeal to all our senses
[19:53] like that and uh decedent seduced her
[19:58] and surely the devil will back up his
[20:00] man the devil will back up his woman
[20:02] the devil will back up his people and
[20:05] god
[20:06] backs up his own with his divine
[20:09] presence
[20:09] amen hallelujah oh my friends if we are
[20:13] to go back to the word
[20:15] then we must by faith return
[20:19] back to the original pentecost
[20:22] even in this message today the word
[20:26] pentecost is uttered like if it's a
[20:29] a curse or if it's some evil thing
[20:33] but uh the prophet of god was not
[20:37] speaking of original pentecost
[20:41] he's speaking of modern day pentecost
[20:44] that's here
[20:44] among us but we must go back to the
[20:47] pattern the world back to the blueprint
[20:50] and then by faith we'll see the presence
[20:53] of the hand of god working in our
[20:57] ministries in our hearts and
[21:00] within our lives now friends
[21:03] as we look into the word of god we
[21:06] realize
[21:07] clearly here amen that these
[21:10] men were faithful only to god's word
[21:13] never mind if they were sawn asunder
[21:17] burnt at the stake never mind if they
[21:21] were persecuted
[21:23] tortured by inquisitions
[21:27] driven from pillar to post hiding
[21:30] in caves hiding in homes running from
[21:34] place to place
[21:36] but yet they stayed true to god's word
[21:39] i wept my friends
[21:42] when i stood at their forum at rome
[21:46] in rome and watched the places
[21:50] where our beloved brethren sang
[21:54] hymns and walked to their
[21:57] death to be eaten and
[22:00] torn apart by lions but they
[22:04] held to god's unchanging hand wall to
[22:07] god's unchanging hand no matter what
[22:10] happens around you
[22:12] society may change politics may change
[22:15] the world may change but our god he
[22:19] changeth not and his word stands true
[22:22] forever and forever glory to
[22:26] god hallelujah the miracle is
[22:29] how did the little flock of god survive
[22:33] but she only survived because
[22:37] god never leaves himself without a
[22:41] witness
[22:42] and god keeps a a seed
[22:45] a seed for a new harvest praise
[22:48] god so the devil could not eradicate
[22:52] the devil could not come destroy the
[22:55] church of god
[22:56] for he already prophesied amen
[22:59] that that it shall not prevail the gates
[23:03] of hell
[23:04] shall not prevail against the church
[23:07] what
[23:08] comforting knowledge to know
[23:12] that these seven messengers were kept by
[23:15] the hand of god
[23:17] it is also true for every believer
[23:21] that we are also in his right hand
[23:25] and kept by him and we can
[23:29] draw from his life from his presence
[23:32] for we realize that back there
[23:36] that uh a candle stand my friend
[23:40] is one that drew its life for uh from
[23:43] the
[23:43] oil that was in it and now
[23:46] we draw our lives from him we
[23:50] draw our lines from the true vine for
[23:53] without him
[23:54] we can do nothing oh
[23:57] how comforting and strengthening that
[24:00] is to know glory to god that god
[24:04] gives us his love his power
[24:07] power and the benefits of his
[24:10] backing and of his life behind us
[24:14] and thank god each messenger
[24:17] to each age is an example
[24:20] sent forth to that age for he is there
[24:25] and as an a sample
[24:29] an example and as a sample
[24:33] of what the rest of the harvest
[24:36] will be like later on
[24:40] when the entire bright church little
[24:43] flock
[24:44] ripens he gives us an example
[24:48] of what the individual believer
[24:52] and the church will look like
[24:55] act like and function
[24:58] on what fashion she will function not
[25:01] that
[25:01] every believer will come up to the level
[25:05] of that messenger but each one will
[25:08] carry a portion of something
[25:11] that was in the life of that believer
[25:15] that a messenger praise god for god
[25:18] used him as a wave shift a sample
[25:22] and as a an example may you
[25:25] realize what i'm saying here today and
[25:28] ask
[25:29] god show me a part of that within my
[25:32] walk within my life lord that i may
[25:36] see it as i have seen you not back in
[25:39] the bible
[25:40] i've read about that but i've seen you
[25:43] displayed in the life of the messenger
[25:47] of this seventh church age lord and i
[25:50] seen your example jesus christ the same
[25:53] yesterday
[25:53] today and forever and i
[25:57] want a part of that oh may god hear your
[26:00] prayer
[26:01] and answer and bless you in every single
[26:04] way
[26:06] now that is the seven stars
[26:10] in his right hand now let's deal with
[26:13] another part of his personality
[26:15] of the two-edged sword
[26:19] the bible tells us and
[26:22] and out of his mouth with a two-edged
[26:26] sword of course we know that speaks of
[26:29] hebrews 4
[26:30] 12 for the word of god is quick
[26:34] and sharper than any edge it sword
[26:38] piercing even to the dividing asunder
[26:41] of soul and spirit and the joints and
[26:44] marrow
[26:44] and is a deserter of the thoughts and
[26:47] intents
[26:48] of the heart out of his mouth
[26:52] with the sharp wedges sword which is the
[26:55] word of god
[26:56] you will find that again in revelation
[26:59] 19
[27:00] verses 11 to 16 in which the heavens
[27:04] opened the white horse writer came down
[27:07] to judge and to make war and the bible
[27:11] tells us
[27:12] that his name is called the word of god
[27:16] and the armies of heaven followed him
[27:19] now john 1 4 8 when uh
[27:23] nathaniel came in the presence of jesus
[27:26] jesus told him before
[27:29] you were called i saw you before philip
[27:33] called you
[27:34] while you were sitting under that fig
[27:36] tree i saw thee
[27:38] that was the hebrews 4 12 the word of
[27:41] god
[27:42] quick sharp a discern though amen
[27:45] the word of god can discern and
[27:48] recognize
[27:49] you and not only your thoughts but your
[27:53] motivations your intentions god
[27:56] shows it amen hallelujah and think about
[27:59] it
[28:00] that same word will judge the nations
[28:04] and judge the entire world not only
[28:08] by their outward action of ungodliness
[28:12] unrighteousness on cleanliness carnality
[28:16] or any such a thing god does not judge
[28:19] by appearance but he discerns by his
[28:23] word
[28:24] and knows the motives the intentions
[28:28] of what the individual is doing far
[28:31] beyond the knowledge and wisdom of
[28:34] mortal man by this we know
[28:37] the world will not be judged by the
[28:39] doctrines of any
[28:40] particular church but the world will be
[28:44] judged by the word of god which is a
[28:46] discerner
[28:48] of the hearts and motives and thoughts
[28:51] as i have said if that be the case which
[28:54] it is the case
[28:56] then we know when we come to the end
[28:59] that all the mysteries of human history
[29:04] will all be unveiled and be made clear
[29:08] before us then we will tell us
[29:11] this happened because of this because of
[29:13] this because of this i allowed this
[29:16] so that this could happen so this could
[29:18] be fulfilled and that could happen
[29:20] we will understand then shall we
[29:23] know as we are known when we
[29:27] come to the end of life's
[29:30] way praise god thank god that he is
[29:34] he has revealed the secrets of the
[29:37] hearts of men
[29:38] and women in this age in which we are
[29:41] living
[29:41] the prophet is gone but by the opening
[29:44] of the word
[29:45] he is still revealing the hearts
[29:48] of men and the women and their reaction
[29:53] to his spoken word he will
[29:56] judge you exactly by that
[30:00] thank god the word of god is full of
[30:03] power
[30:03] and the same spirit that was in jesus
[30:07] the word of god
[30:08] is again present in the bright church
[30:12] of this last age working through
[30:15] it and we find as the people head to
[30:18] judgment
[30:18] as they head towards the end many are
[30:21] rejecting
[30:22] him in this day and in
[30:26] this hour crucifying him again
[30:29] as hebrews 6 6 says if they
[30:32] shall fall away it's so
[30:36] it's so dynamic how the word of
[30:40] god its economy and its poor tents
[30:44] are so remarkable listen
[30:47] hebrews 6 6
[30:51] 66 and you'll find the number six the
[30:55] number of men
[30:56] number of the antichrist all of that
[30:58] wrapped up in this verse
[31:00] if they shall fall away to renew them
[31:05] them again onto repentance seeing
[31:08] they crucify themselves the
[31:11] son of god afresh and put him to
[31:15] open shame that speaking of a lot of
[31:18] message people
[31:19] a lot of word people that once believed
[31:22] and have fallen away this is not john
[31:25] simon saying this is the word of god
[31:27] saying oh praise god
[31:31] read it for yourselves and hear what the
[31:33] word of god says
[31:34] now paul said that the word came not
[31:37] only in power
[31:38] but it also came with a voice it came
[31:41] speaking and paul preached it by voice
[31:45] and demonstrated it by the blessed holy
[31:49] spirit
[31:50] and when the word is preached on the
[31:51] divine unwinding
[31:53] it's like the cutting of a flaming sword
[31:56] it's like the piercings of a surgical
[31:59] knife
[32:00] and it cuts out the diseases of the body
[32:04] it cuts out the diseases of the
[32:06] conscience and of the mind
[32:08] it sets the captives free
[32:11] and everywhere the believers go
[32:15] they preach this word praise god
[32:18] the word that the apostles preach that
[32:21] paul
[32:21] preached that the doctrines that they
[32:24] taught
[32:25] and insists according to the promise
[32:28] that we serve the lord that changeth not
[32:31] one god one lord one baptism
[32:34] one name one true church of the living
[32:37] god
[32:38] yes the family may be scattered here and
[32:41] there
[32:42] in various denominations but lord we
[32:45] love them there they know one another
[32:49] by the presence of his spirit in each
[32:51] one's heart
[32:52] and they know it for the deep calls to
[32:55] the
[32:56] deep and the deep response for they know
[32:59] that they are of light precious faith
[33:01] and revelation
[33:03] living in the presence of the king
[33:06] praise god hallelujah
[33:08] whoa what a day of the word of god in
[33:11] action
[33:12] the word of god word of god in action
[33:15] another book of acts being written
[33:18] another book of acts being displayed
[33:21] by the word and presence of the living
[33:23] god
[33:24] and the word of god has never failed
[33:27] throughout all ages once it's anointed
[33:31] in the mouths of true believers
[33:35] that are sent from the presence of
[33:37] almighty god
[33:39] to bear his name without any
[33:42] shame and to carry out his word
[33:45] and his directives amen hallelujah
[33:49] and thanks be the god that as they
[33:52] as a the path of the justice as a shiny
[33:56] light
[33:56] that grows brighter and brighter onto
[34:00] this wonderful day so is it that the
[34:03] presence
[34:04] the understanding the revelation
[34:07] the sharp discernment and piercings of
[34:10] the conscience
[34:11] by the word of god hallelujah is growing
[34:14] stronger
[34:15] and stronger every single day
[34:18] oh praise god the little slug
[34:22] i know she's in a little minority
[34:25] but hold on hold on things are gonna
[34:29] change
[34:29] for one day my friends i tell you he
[34:33] will fill
[34:34] your heart and fill your mouth
[34:37] with his divine presence and god will
[34:40] bring you into his kingdom finally
[34:44] but right now it's manifesting time
[34:47] it's manifesting time and their
[34:50] fruits are on the vine praise god
[34:55] hallelujah and now
[34:58] lastly and his face
[35:02] was like the sun
[35:05] and his countenance was as the sun
[35:10] that shineth in his strength
[35:13] and matthew chapter 17 verses 1 to 13
[35:17] we have the uh the recounting of the
[35:20] uh transfiguration and there
[35:23] we see it he is referring to himself
[35:28] he is speaking in the last book of the
[35:30] bible the book of revelation
[35:33] and referring back to himself that they
[35:36] may recognize who he is speaking of
[35:40] that he is the same one whose face was
[35:44] shining in his strength
[35:47] shining through moses i am
[35:52] that i am speaking through
[35:56] the prophet moses and
[35:59] on the mount of transgression
[36:02] the same one speaking
[36:06] and anointing jesus christ
[36:09] transfigured before them with
[36:12] blinding shining light of god
[36:16] upon him they and whenever
[36:19] a believer gets to that place when the
[36:22] holy spirit
[36:23] is transfigured within them the word of
[36:26] god
[36:27] that's upon the page of the bible that
[36:29] we walk with
[36:30] every day one day becomes transfigured
[36:34] before you
[36:35] you can see nothing else but jesus
[36:38] christ from genesis the revelation
[36:41] they saw no man but jesus only
[36:45] a true believer will see jesus
[36:49] only for the entire bible is
[36:52] christ being revealed in his own word
[36:56] with the great cored red cord
[37:00] bloody uh blood stream of blood
[37:04] running from genesis to revelation the
[37:07] story of redemption
[37:09] and of the redeeming power of the very
[37:12] hand
[37:13] of god hallelujah amen yes sir
[37:17] and so we see the great order
[37:20] of his coming of how that he will come
[37:23] back again in his second coming shining
[37:27] in his strength
[37:28] but for as he comes in the rapture for
[37:31] his bride
[37:33] then he comes again to israel
[37:37] he comes with his bride
[37:41] he armies of heaven following him
[37:44] to defend israel at that
[37:47] particular time now we recognize
[37:50] that israel is already a nation israel
[37:53] has
[37:54] been reborn naturally since 1948
[37:58] her natural rebirth started from that
[38:02] time
[38:03] and she is now established with armies
[38:06] navy's postal system a glorious
[38:10] beautiful flag and everything else
[38:13] that pertains and speaks of
[38:16] nationhood the scripture tells us
[38:19] uh shall the nation be born all at once
[38:23] isaiah 66 8 so we see she is born
[38:26] naturally
[38:27] but she is yet to be born spiritually
[38:31] when all the things of the
[38:34] old testament the signs the symbols the
[38:37] types the substitutions and shadows
[38:40] will be fulfilled and she will
[38:43] experience a national revival
[38:47] and rebirth in the presence of god
[38:51] right now the fig tree is putting forth
[38:53] her buds
[38:54] she is waiting for the arrival waiting
[38:59] with great expectation for the
[39:02] coming of her messiah
[39:05] and they are expecting him may
[39:09] god help their expectations to be
[39:12] fulfilled so she will be reborn
[39:15] in the light in her light
[39:18] understanding of him on the word and
[39:22] in her life individually and national
[39:25] life she will be be reborn
[39:28] amen because he himself
[39:32] will be revealed to her and praise god
[39:36] hallelujah oh what a marvelous season of
[39:39] time
[39:40] in which we are living in glory to god
[39:43] so here he is the sun shining in his
[39:46] strength
[39:47] shining in the middle of the seven
[39:51] golden candlesticks they are
[39:53] candlesticks
[39:55] but he is the sun think of it
[39:58] candlesticks will burn out after a while
[40:02] after they've served their purpose after
[40:04] they have shined their light
[40:06] they will burn out and pass away
[40:10] but the sun will continue to shine in
[40:14] the strength
[40:15] remember the sun that we are seeing
[40:18] today
[40:19] it's the same sun that shone upon
[40:23] adam and eve in the garden it is the
[40:27] same
[40:27] sun that is shining upon us today of
[40:30] course that is a symbol of the word of
[40:32] god
[40:33] shining upon them shining so bright that
[40:36] same word of god unchanging shines upon
[40:40] us whether it be
[40:41] cloudy thundering lightning stormy day
[40:45] but it's the same son of god that will
[40:48] return after all the darkness and the
[40:50] fallen

[41:04] stated
[41:05] god will speak again
[41:09] and his voice will be to the sinner a
[41:12] death sentence but to the true believer
[41:17] it's deliverance it's rapture
[41:20] its freedom to go back into the presence
[41:23] of god
