[18:57] less good the scriptures right away
[19:00] Joshua chapter 1 verse 1 to 9 we're
[19:03] gonna be reading a couple of scriptures
[19:05] alongside the rule
[19:28] okay now
[19:30] after the death of Moses the servant of
[19:34] the Lord
[19:35] he came to pass that the Lord spoke unto
[19:38] Joshua the son of Dan Moses Minister
[19:42] saying mostly my servant is dead
[19:47] now therefore arise
[19:49] go over this Jordan thou and all these
[19:52] people
[19:53] on the language I do give to them even
[19:56] the children of Israel
[19:58] every place
[20:01] that the soul
[20:03] of
[20:05] the the feet every every place that the
[20:08] soul of your foot shall tread upon
[20:11] that have I given unto you
[20:15] as
[20:17] as
[20:19] I said unto Moses from the Wilderness
[20:22] and this Lebanon even on the Great River
[20:26] the river is freeze
[20:28] all the land of Heritage and on the
[20:32] grace he told the going down of the sun
[20:34] shall be your Coast
[20:36] there shall not any man be able to stand
[20:40] before thee all the days of their life
[20:44] as I was with Moses
[20:46] so I will be with thee I'll not fail
[20:50] thee
[20:51] nor forsake me
[20:53] be strong
[20:55] and of a good courage
[20:58] For unto these people shall they divide
[21:01] for an inheritance the language I swear
[21:04] unto their fathers to give them only be
[21:08] thou strong
[21:09] and very courageous
[21:12] that thou means observed to do according
[21:15] to all the law
[21:18] which Moses my servant commanded thee
[21:22] turn not from a to the right hand or to
[21:26] the left that thou means Prosper
[21:29] whatsoever to our goals
[21:33] this book of the law shall not depart
[21:36] out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate
[21:40] there in day and night and thou mayest
[21:44] observe to do according to all that is
[21:46] written therein for then shall thou make
[21:50] thy way prosperous and then shall have
[21:53] good success heavenly father bless the
[21:56] reader of the word in Jesus name amen
[21:58] please be seated
[21:59] Hallelujah so
[22:03] I'm only gonna
[22:04] take that Joshua number one
[22:07] and just explain them how God has lived
[22:10] my heart
[22:12] so
[22:13] um the first verse now after the death
[22:17] of Moses the servant of the Lord he came
[22:20] to pass that the Lord speak unto Joshua
[22:23] the son of man
[22:24] Moses means I say Moses my servant
[22:29] is dead he's specifying me to claim that
[22:33] Moses my servant is dead
[22:36] and
[22:37] when he said that
[22:39] as by Thomas have taught us
[22:42] Brahm type himself as Dr mooses and and
[22:46] all that type he types of osmosis so God
[22:50] specifically
[22:51] told us that Moses is dead
[22:54] but the message also what go on but the
[22:58] people always don't like a change
[23:00] when there is a change from
[23:04] one situation to other it becomes a war
[23:07] people like to be in their old way of
[23:10] doing things
[23:11] and I was a privilege to be a supervisor
[23:14] for so many years in this in a specific
[23:16] company and what I realized is that when
[23:20] I took the position I have plans I have
[23:22] aims I have things to let the work go
[23:24] perfectly well but because somebody has
[23:28] already planted a seed
[23:29] so the old people it was hard to move
[23:34] them
[23:34] when you teach them to do this they say
[23:36] Moses said this you teach them do they
[23:39] say there are four mother say this this
[23:41] one said this so they were very like
[23:43] Steve
[23:44] but the new ones
[23:46] that I have I was able to train them the
[23:50] way I wanted to be to train them so what
[23:54] I'm saying is that people don't like
[23:56] change and I'm not even surprised
[23:59] because the two million people that came
[24:03] with Moses
[24:05] God
[24:07] did not let all the two million people
[24:10] perish
[24:12] Joshua went with only new generation
[24:17] because I believe that
[24:19] when they went to spy the land
[24:22] and Joshua stood by Moses but God knows
[24:27] that the people are so sick with Moses
[24:30] ideas they all want to say what Moses
[24:32] said so when Joshua move came to the
[24:37] office God will not allow all those
[24:40] people to go Josh and God you're going
[24:42] to give him trouble down the road
[24:44] because people always want to go back
[24:47] and stay with that God's word is still
[24:49] moving on so the true bride of Christ
[24:52] they recognize the move we if that
[24:54] people could have just accepted
[24:56] everything that came to Pentecost plus
[24:58] what God will continue to reveal
[25:01] everything will go on perfectly well
[25:03] they put like to stick to their back God
[25:06] sent us a Vindicated prophet and he has
[25:09] done everything he has finished his work
[25:11] he's gone to his reward
[25:13] so that people want to go and and
[25:16] working back from his sleep they don't
[25:19] want him to have a sleep and relax
[25:22] so that has always been the people and
[25:25] it's not been easy even Paul
[25:28] when he came on the scene we can read
[25:31] from um
[25:32] Acts 21-21
[25:35] in Acts 21
[25:38] when Paul was trying to move the people
[25:40] from law to Grace
[25:43] they their Jews were resistant
[25:46] they didn't want to move because Moses
[25:49] said Moses said they want to move from
[25:52] what Paul was trying to tell them so in
[25:55] Acts 2020 I said that and they I formed
[25:58] the dark teachers all the Jews which
[26:01] Amanda that's us to forsake Moses
[26:04] Paul was never told them to forsake
[26:06] Moses but because it becomes something
[26:09] new to them they don't want to accept it
[26:12] but it was still the ways of God
[26:16] saying that they ought not to circumcise
[26:18] their children either to work after the
[26:20] customs
[26:21] because
[26:22] they didn't understand
[26:25] what Paul was trying to say
[26:28] but a few who were chosen
[26:30] have the Revelation they accepted his
[26:34] way and it becomes so bad that
[26:39] um
[26:39] John the Baptist
[26:42] he was the one that introduced the
[26:45] Messiah
[26:46] he said I my secrets he must increase he
[26:50] point them the Lamb of God that taketh
[26:53] away the sins of the world
[26:55] he did that clearly
[26:58] and those disciples that have Revelation
[27:00] in his time they left John and followed
[27:04] the Lamb of Christ
[27:05] but if you go back to Acts Chapter 19
[27:07] Verse 1 to 3 we still have people who
[27:11] were baptizing in John's baptism
[27:14] still following John even though John
[27:18] has pointed them the Messiah
[27:20] they didn't want to have a change they
[27:23] feel comfortable during their old way
[27:26] things
[27:27] and you can never move forward by
[27:30] staying in your own way
[27:33] when the world is moving we got to move
[27:35] with it
[27:37] if you don't move without gonna be left
[27:39] behind
[27:41] some people are always almost being left
[27:44] behind already because they have been so
[27:46] safe
[27:47] and staying back
[27:49] doesn't want to move through the word of
[27:51] the hour
[27:52] so we have a trouble with people what
[27:57] Ram staying put
[28:00] they never want to move
[28:04] where God is telling us move forward
[28:07] don't stay in your past
[28:10] yes God sent a prophet Vindicated
[28:13] Prophet never happened the life of the
[28:16] world before
[28:17] God used him so much as I said the other
[28:19] time that when God incarnate a man like
[28:23] the prophets like Paul and Brahman do
[28:26] his praise is so much in them that the
[28:29] things that they do
[28:31] and make people seem like God in them
[28:34] and they want to worship them and even
[28:37] Paul and Barnabas one time they have to
[28:39] rent their clothes
[28:41] and put ashes in them that we are men of
[28:44] Life passing like you are worship God
[28:48] and that angel in Revelation 19 wanted
[28:51] to worship that the seven the angel for
[28:55] our age and he's told John I am one of
[28:59] your brethren worship God
[29:03] he didn't allow him to worship Him
[29:06] and the prophet have to live the sins
[29:10] stop preaching for about three and a
[29:11] half years because people wanted to
[29:14] worship Him
[29:16] but God has to reveal to him they did
[29:18] that John the Baptist they did that so
[29:19] he came back and you'll be surprised in
[29:22] this 22nd century people are still
[29:25] trying to worship him some worship him
[29:28] in his picture and doing everything but
[29:30] the bride of Christ are true and some of
[29:32] them also has gone to the other end
[29:36] renouncing the message
[29:39] um saying this is not this this is not
[29:42] that finding false with the message but
[29:45] the true bride walk in the Middle with a
[29:47] balance
[29:48] believe in God and serving God Amen he
[29:52] walked right in the middle of the road
[29:54] amen because he never denied that
[29:57] prophet of God he knew if it's not him
[29:59] he wouldn't have so have so many things
[30:01] and what am I trying to say it wasn't
[30:05] easy even for Jesus Christ in his time
[30:08] because Moses told them that God will
[30:11] raise a prophet unto like me
[30:14] and when that Prophet was raised and he
[30:17] was in the midst of them talking to them
[30:19] they said that Moses said he said if you
[30:23] had believed Moses you have believed in
[30:25] me because Mercy wrote about me
[30:27] by the true bride of Christ in that time
[30:30] they recognize the sun they regret the
[30:32] Son of God their record that he said
[30:34] Messiah on the earth they couldn't miss
[30:36] it it was so clear to them
[30:39] but the people were reading this very
[30:42] Bible
[30:43] and this is my Bible has become manifest
[30:47] in front of them
[30:50] and the rest of denying the weather has
[30:52] been put on flesh because always is the
[30:55] one is in letter form
[30:56] but when you put on the Flesh and it
[30:59] manifests then the people don't have
[31:00] nothing to do with it amen he said
[31:03] yesterday to them forever because the
[31:05] word has come flesh
[31:07] and it's working in the eye people are
[31:10] trying to point the people Jesus Christ
[31:12] on the cross but they forgot that is now
[31:15] sitting in the aisle with you and me and
[31:17] everybody the bride of Christ sitting
[31:19] over here even right now so Jesus Christ
[31:22] is the same yesterday today and forever
[31:28] Our God has never changed
[31:31] you think it was easy for Abraham
[31:34] that change that came
[31:37] when Pentacles
[31:40] came they are formed they have the
[31:43] restoration of their gift first time in
[31:45] the history of men that they were
[31:47] speaking in tongues and all these three
[31:50] manifestation the love of God and the
[31:52] wise and embracing their bloods and
[31:56] everything and God using that black man
[31:59] Simon so supernaturally and they seen
[32:02] the power of God like that and then they
[32:04] formed speaking in tongues as the
[32:07] evidence of the Holy Ghost
[32:09] but when God sent his Prophet because it
[32:12] was changing of this sensation
[32:14] from the restoration of the gift to
[32:16] fulfillment of balaka four five
[32:18] Revelation thanks to all those
[32:19] scriptures when he came on the scene and
[32:22] started telling them that speaking in
[32:24] songs is not the evidence of the Holy
[32:27] Ghost but it is what a gift of the Holy
[32:31] Ghost you think it was easy when he
[32:33] started telling them that true baptism
[32:35] has to be in the name of Jesus when he
[32:37] started telling them that women should
[32:38] not preach
[32:41] woman not to preach out to or stop
[32:44] authority over the man for the woman
[32:46] being deceived fall in transgression
[32:48] however he will be said in chattering if
[32:51] this remaining sobriety you think it was
[32:54] easy at that time the offers took him
[32:57] yet it was in the word of God and that
[33:01] is what is happening right now
[33:03] everything that is happening is written
[33:06] here
[33:07] better people are denying it
[33:10] you think it's easy for a pastor when he
[33:13] has to stand out and say that
[33:15] um have you been received the Holy Ghost
[33:18] since you believe this message
[33:20] they'll tell you what are you talking
[33:21] about
[33:22] but that was the move of God
[33:25] but that people don't want to accept it
[33:27] because
[33:28] his jacket is all in a word talking
[33:30] about eternal churches and they might
[33:32] change and everything they don't want to
[33:34] accept it
[33:36] but it's also written because they don't
[33:40] want to change
[33:41] they have become accustomed that oh when
[33:44] you come out from the Pentecost you have
[33:46] received the Holy Ghost once you have
[33:48] this when the word god revealed himself
[33:50] and he said have you been received since
[33:53] you believe then they didn't want to
[33:55] have nothing to do beg their true Sons
[33:58] and Daughters of God recognize this is
[34:00] that said the Lord and they follow that
[34:03] that voice of God so it's happening in
[34:07] every dispensation people don't want a
[34:11] change
[34:13] and it's not it wasn't easy for
[34:16] Disciples of Jesus Christ
[34:18] even if you check
[34:20] in the scriptures
[34:22] but Peter was telling said
[34:25] why you said the woman has touched you
[34:27] so many people have been touching you
[34:29] because they've been the follower of the
[34:31] word they also having their Spirit they
[34:34] are said their first share of the
[34:36] accusation
[34:38] so Peter has to say oh Lord this is not
[34:41] interested that I could I perceived that
[34:44] virtue has gone out from me so what I'm
[34:47] trying to say that when God
[34:49] gave you a true servant and you follow
[34:53] Christ you follow that seven that's you
[34:56] follow Christ when he gets there Glory
[34:58] you get that Glory when the people
[35:00] attack him in some way or the other
[35:02] you're gonna also feel it but a true Son
[35:05] of God will stand by that man of God
[35:07] like um the David David
[35:11] um that those people who were faithful
[35:14] to David
[35:16] who went to get water for him to drink I
[35:19] remember one time
[35:21] I met a brother
[35:23] and you are going to have a fellowship
[35:26] and I thought that you're going to talk
[35:28] about he's not in our church anyway from
[35:30] different church and I thought you're
[35:31] going to talk about what God has done in
[35:33] our lives and just encourage and be
[35:35] happy with one another
[35:37] we went to Starbucks this man started oh
[35:40] your pastor said this your pastor said
[35:42] that I said my brother didn't come for
[35:44] here the Bible said that the marriage of
[35:46] the Lamb has come and his wife has made
[35:49] herself ready it's where does the
[35:52] marriage take place and this man
[35:54] couldn't save him a word he was exposed
[35:56] right there because the thing that we
[35:58] are talking is written here that's why I
[36:01] believe that if you have looked into it
[36:03] this is that talks about me they won't
[36:07] take their time and search the
[36:09] scriptures and pray even if they don't
[36:12] understand they should even keep mood
[36:14] and let God
[36:16] reveal to them when the time comes for
[36:18] them to know as Pastor told us online so
[36:20] that when the light flash on that word
[36:23] it becomes manifest become that
[36:25] manifestation for that work they won't
[36:28] have that patience they won't have that
[36:31] happiness to wait but they will just
[36:34] jump to criticize it and that is death
[36:37] to some people because it's God's word
[36:41] for your day
[36:43] because people want to live in the past
[36:47] but
[36:48] a true daughter or son of God will
[36:51] recognize what God is doing in present
[36:54] tense now what God is doing the
[36:58] scripture pertaining his death because
[37:01] eagles eat fresh food
[37:06] will be
[37:08] the man that God make it simple for the
[37:11] Israelites you cannot go back and keep
[37:14] the manner for yesterday I will send you
[37:17] mercy upon Mercy each and every day as
[37:20] new message every day
[37:22] so look for the new things that God is
[37:24] doing God is doing new things God is
[37:26] moving on their wedding is moving was
[37:29] saying that saying the prophet gone left
[37:32] on the street for so many years with
[37:35] that time we have what I saw uh what as
[37:38] as soon as the people have went to the
[37:41] moon and everything but if you check
[37:43] from State five continent science has
[37:45] gone so far ahead you think God is
[37:48] staying back
[37:49] listen to um the message called um
[37:54] it says contending
[37:57] countdown he talked about
[38:00] John Wesley would house this and that
[38:03] and since 1965 you see advancement of
[38:06] science it has gone so far so God hasn't
[38:11] stayed there God is also on the move
[38:14] he's still moving
[38:15] so you have to recognize what he is
[38:18] doing and move on with the team let that
[38:21] word of God move on with you don't stay
[38:23] in your past amen stay in the move in
[38:27] the presence of God Amen because God
[38:29] said Not His glory with anybody his
[38:32] glory is that himself nobody is only
[38:33] himself
[38:35] he keep it to himself he alone has to be
[38:38] worshiped
[38:39] in in Matthew 17 verse 4 to 4. 17 48
[38:46] Peter and John and James they wanted to
[38:49] do that he said that then I said Peter
[38:52] and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for
[38:56] us to be here amen if that will let us
[38:59] make here straight Tabernacles one for
[39:03] thee run for Moses and one for him yes
[39:06] why did you expect Behold a bright Cloud
[39:10] overshadow them and wrote a voice out of
[39:14] the cloud which said this is my beloved
[39:16] Son in whom I am well pleased here ye
[39:21] him and when the established head they
[39:24] fell on their face and were so afraid
[39:27] and Jesus came and touched him and said
[39:30] I Rise
[39:32] and be not afraid and when they had
[39:34] lifted their eyes they saw no man saved
[39:37] Jesus only
[39:38] Jesus only
[39:40] Give Me Jesus only nobody else Jesus
[39:44] only that's all I'm Desiring nothingness
[39:47] to your eyes are to see Jesus is one
[39:50] person of the Lord who said one God one
[39:54] God the godhead he is the only one he
[39:56] said our father of the Alpha and the
[39:58] Omega they bring that and Bright Morning
[40:01] Star he's everything
[40:03] the I see only Jesus gave me only Jesus
[40:08] in the name of Jesus every knee shall
[40:11] bow of things in heaven on Earth amen
[40:14] and every thoughts are confessed that
[40:16] Jesus Christ is God behind him the
[40:19] Estonia that God neither of them
[40:22] after him he's the one true Living God
[40:25] and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ he
[40:28] is the only one that will worship we
[40:30] worship Christ the King he amen he's our
[40:33] savior hallelujah praise our God our God
[40:37] is good
[40:39] Hallelujah amen praise God so what am I
[40:43] trying to say that our focus our
[40:46] everything should be on Christ
[40:49] nothing else
[40:52] if you check you can see it it's all
[40:54] over the place it's everywhere when you
[40:59] check on the
[41:00] um
[41:02] I think on the you check
[41:05] you check on the most of the places
[41:08] in the
[41:09] um one of the sermons why he just type
[41:13] it up
[41:15] with
[41:16] the Millennium that you're trying to say
[41:19] that in Millennium we work
[41:21] because a thousand rain
[41:23] of the bride of Christ the type seven
[41:26] Church ages we're gonna work we're gonna
[41:28] do everything but when it comes to
[41:30] Eighth Day the eighth age the
[41:33] um the new Heavens that I prepare you a
[41:37] new Heavens a new air is God coming to
[41:40] prepare it there were no one can't can
[41:43] touch it it's only him that is doing it
[41:46] so he's sharing all his glory with
[41:48] anybody so now he has come down
[41:51] and what and doing that work himself
[41:54] because when it came to this time he
[41:57] didn't left it in any man's hand he said
[41:59] I will come I will not forsake I'll
[42:02] never leave you I'll come and I'll be
[42:04] with you even in you until the
[42:06] consummation of the time he is the new
[42:09] tonight he's the same yesterday driver
[42:11] where is the god of Elijah Elijah didn't
[42:14] ask for Elijah said where is the god of
[42:16] Elijah the God that was in brother
[42:19] Abraham that's the god that we are
[42:21] serving the same God his name is the
[42:23] Lord Jesus Christ he's the one that we
[42:26] accept he's never going to leave us not
[42:28] forsake us this is the truth
[42:33] is that God that we're crying to amen he
[42:37] hasn't changed
[42:38] he said he will never leave us nor
[42:41] forsake us
[42:42] amen
[42:43] praise God our God is good
[42:46] all the time Hallelujah so what am I
[42:50] trying to say you have the mind of
[42:53] Christ it's you that Christ is inside of
[42:56] you so you recognize that then God is
[43:01] giving you this commandment in Joshua
[43:03] chapter 1 verse
[43:06] five he said that there shall not any
[43:10] man be able to stand before thee all the
[43:13] days of their life as I was with Moses
[43:16] so I will be with you I will not fail
[43:20] thee nor forsake thee
[43:22] amen he promised he will never leave
[43:24] thee nor forsake thee I'll be with you
[43:27] even in you until the consummation of
[43:30] the time so as the brothers sing the
[43:33] song Something keep on holding me
[43:36] since God called us it has not been easy
[43:41] you get to some place some of us were
[43:44] even running live
[43:46] because it gets so tough sometimes
[43:49] a Christian work is not a flowery bread
[43:52] of ease it's a battle
[43:55] it's a fight
[43:58] sometimes you go through some scars
[44:00] but what do you think is keeping you
[44:04] some cannot stand they just run away
[44:08] when the tribe become hot
[44:11] so many we started a race with where are
[44:14] they it's not he who does start the race
[44:17] he that endure to end he is the Wonder
[44:20] World gonna receive the reward never
[44:22] give up
[44:24] it doesn't matter what happened we will
[44:26] never give up
[44:27] We Stand by this word
[44:30] oh as I said if I perish let me perish
[44:34] this is the truth if this is the truth
[44:36] I'm gonna support it with all my heart
[44:39] my mind my soul everything within me
[44:43] will support this word of God Amen if I
[44:46] perish let me perish I am willing to go
[44:48] out away
[44:49] it doesn't matter what happened what
[44:51] comes my way I'm going with the Lord
[44:54] says twice no matter what happened to me
[44:56] I'm going with the Lord Jesus Christ I
[44:59] am not moving on each
[45:01] yes the devil you can attack me you can
[45:04] do whatever you want with me take
[45:05] everything back give me Jesus I will
[45:08] never brought that to you Satan and bow
[45:11] down to Jesus Christ you belong to my
[45:13] feet Satan I step on you you have no
[45:17] parted me I'm a son of the Living God no
[45:20] matter what kind my way I worship Jesus
[45:32] amen because he is the one keeping me I
[45:35] cannot keep myself
[45:37] who can keep himself
[45:39] no one
[45:41] but he has kept us all this far
[45:44] so I encourage you tonight
[45:46] let's keep pressing on let's keep
[45:49] pressing on is that if you can only know
[45:52] what's what's for what's ahead of us
[45:54] you'll never give up we will press on WE
[45:58] press on and Press On A Prayer he has
[46:00] done everything listen God could have
[46:04] given the whole life bear for them to
[46:06] take everything but he said that little
[46:08] by little
[46:09] I will give it to you everywhere your
[46:13] footstep I have given it to you amen so
[46:16] footsteps mean possession
[46:19] you got to put your food there
[46:21] just like that
[46:23] the lepers that we talk about the other
[46:26] time
[46:28] they said that if we stay here we are
[46:30] dead people if we go over the other side
[46:34] they can kill us but you can maybe also
[46:37] be saved
[46:39] so that they say in that place to die
[46:42] they make a move as the pastor also his
[46:46] action brings a reaction
[46:48] so make a move just move forward don't
[46:51] stay in your comfort zone
[46:53] if you don't understand anything just
[46:56] give yourself a time God will make it
[46:59] clear to you you're gonna make it plain
[47:01] don't just challenge don't just fight
[47:03] don't fast
[47:04] lift this alone and God himself will
[47:07] fight our battles for you he will take
[47:10] care of you
[47:11] sometimes you are quick to judge you are
[47:13] quick to this we are quick to do this
[47:15] but God wants us to just relax and you
[47:18] take care of first if you check the
[47:20] Bible says that they established there
[47:21] are men of few words they are full of
[47:23] Holy Ghost
[47:24] amen sometimes you get yourself talk
[47:26] talk talk certain things that are not
[47:28] even supposed to talk you end up talking
[47:31] so sometimes I'm not saying you don't
[47:34] have to talk you have to talk
[47:36] but you have to know what you're talking
[47:37] about
[47:39] don't just get loose and just talk all
[47:41] your secret everywhere
[47:43] there are certain things that doesn't
[47:45] have to go anyway amen our God is good
[47:48] hallelujah praise God
[47:51] amen
[47:53] verse 7.
[47:56] only be thou strong and very courageous
[48:01] that thou Mays observed to do according
[48:04] to
[48:06] all the law which Moses by servant
[48:08] commanded thee turn off from me to the
[48:11] right hand or to the left
[48:14] that directs May prosper
[48:17] with server
[48:19] to our doors
[48:23] verse 8
[48:25] this book
[48:27] of the law
[48:29] shall not depart
[48:31] out of thy mouth
[48:33] but thou shall meditate daring
[48:38] day and night
[48:41] that thou must observe to do according
[48:43] to all that is written therein
[48:46] for then shall thou make thy wayward
[48:50] prosperous
[48:52] and then shall have what
[48:54] good success
[48:56] amen he said that the book of us are not
[48:59] the path but thou cemented there in day
[49:02] and night in Psalm 1 verse 4 Psalm 1
[49:07] verse 1 it says that blessed is the man
[49:12] thou work not in the Council of the
[49:16] ungodly
[49:17] not stand in the way of sinners nor
[49:21] seated in the seat of the scaffold
[49:23] but his Delight
[49:25] is in the law
[49:27] of the Lord and in his law
[49:31] do what he meditate day and night
[49:35] you got Psalm 19 brabham which to like
[49:37] to pray with that let the west of my
[49:40] mouth and the meditations in my heart be
[49:43] acceptable unto thee o my king and my
[49:47] word Redeemer in other words
[49:51] that scripture is trying to tell the
[49:52] prophet said that
[49:55] if you are thinking something in your
[49:58] heart
[49:59] whatever you meditating you and you say
[50:02] it's something contrary to what you are
[50:05] saying that make you a hypocrite
[50:08] that's why Jesus Christ if I say to be
[50:11] hypocrite so everywhere that is the way
[50:14] that is coming from your mouth shall
[50:16] have to line up with what's in your
[50:19] heart
[50:20] if that is not happening you cannot even
[50:23] have what you ask them for that the
[50:25] Bible said that if thou can't believe
[50:28] all things are possible to them that
[50:31] belief if you doubt you won't get what
[50:34] you are saying that's why immaculating
[50:36] says if you do not doubt then believe
[50:38] that what you have said will come to
[50:40] pass you shall have what you say so the
[50:43] meditations in our heart is very very
[50:46] important because our thoughts speaks
[50:49] louder in heaven than our words
[50:52] you can deceive the people but you can't
[50:54] deceive God
[50:56] he knows moving right now whatever you
[50:59] thinking he knows everything about us
[51:02] so we have to be playing
[51:05] I'll rather stand by my conviction
[51:08] and
[51:09] be rebuke or be ridiculous
[51:14] than to hide
[51:15] and try to please people because God
[51:19] don't want people who try to please men
[51:22] just be yourself
[51:24] speak the truth
[51:27] if you're gonna be killed let them kill
[51:29] you whatever it is speak the truth and
[51:30] be free
[51:32] that's why God loved David when he saw
[51:35] the Ark of the Covenant coming he put us
[51:38] some moves you know he didn't care about
[51:40] the wife whatever anybody was saying he
[51:42] was so happy with the Lord that his son
[51:45] he danced and everything and the wife
[51:47] was angry he said you despise me I
[51:49] despise you then you show him another
[51:51] move because why he respect God
[51:54] he loved God
[51:56] we don't have to please one another
[51:59] we have to please Jesus and when our
[52:02] heart is right to God and we please God
[52:04] unconscious automatically you'll be
[52:06] pleasing our brothers and sisters
[52:08] because the same God in you in them when
[52:11] you are right with God you'll be right
[52:13] to the people around you if you are not
[52:16] right to God things will fall apart
[52:19] so God wants us to be faithful God wants
[52:23] us to what think and meditate on the
[52:26] right word that's that's why I said that
[52:28] in in Philippians said that whatsoever
[52:30] things that our good report whatsoever
[52:33] things that edifies if there are any
[52:35] virtues think on those things
[52:39] because your thought forms an atmosphere
[52:42] around you
[52:43] if you're thinking negative people don't
[52:46] want to get around you
[52:48] because automatically is going to say
[52:50] negative things around them there's any
[52:52] situation that you complain this this
[52:55] that God don't want people who are
[52:57] complaining
[52:58] you take
[53:00] positive from everything and to when our
[53:02] record good
[53:04] just be positive oriented that's why
[53:06] that every positive and mentality will
[53:09] bring what God presents down it will
[53:12] bring your request to pass if thou can't
[53:15] believe
[53:16] all things are possible to them that
[53:19] believe he's the same yesterday today
[53:22] and forever
[53:24] and one other thing too
[53:26] a lot for people is not as brown
[53:29] explained it's not your thoughts alone
[53:33] as Christian cancels the Christian
[53:35] Science said but let the word of God
[53:38] when you go through the channel of your
[53:41] thoughts then automatically other things
[53:44] was what flow through
[53:46] so you have to sit on the word of God
[53:49] listen to the tips
[53:52] read your Bible
[53:54] pray every day God will do the rest when
[53:58] you fall in love with that with the Lord
[54:01] the word will be revealed to you you
[54:05] know the written part by falling in love
[54:08] with him because if you you're in love
[54:10] with your wife your wife don't have to
[54:12] write everything for you to understand
[54:15] so as if you are truly in love with God
[54:18] you don't have you just have to know all
[54:20] the written words or written part will
[54:22] be will be claimed to us because we are
[54:24] in love with the Lord the maker
[54:27] so let's fall in love with the word of
[54:29] God Let's Fall In Love Like remember our
[54:31] first love when he first called us you
[54:34] are so excited we are so eager to be in
[54:37] the house of God we can't wait to be
[54:39] here we can't wait to be in the
[54:40] premature we can't wait till you
[54:42] understand you can't wait to be every
[54:44] time I run the word of God what happened
[54:50] what happened
[54:54] we have to shake the system away from us
[54:59] doubt your doubt and believe God
[55:02] let's come back
[55:04] to our first love and worship him
[55:07] he's more than able
[55:10] to give us the desires of artists more
[55:12] than able to solve every problem is more
[55:15] than able to take us through it's more
[55:17] than able because listen it's never
[55:19] going to be better
[55:21] it's gonna get worse and worse cold if
[55:25] you're looking for things to better
[55:26] forget it it's going to be worse but if
[55:30] you
[55:32] and if you allow God
[55:38] to live through you he also going to
[55:42] move mightily through you because this
[55:44] is the hour there is no any other time
[55:47] that God wants to manifest himself for
[55:49] through his bride this is the time this
[55:52] is the time we used to say that he's
[55:54] coming this has happened but everything
[55:56] is here now because God is ready to move
[55:59] his bride to another damage to another
[56:02] level amen he's doing that now because
[56:05] the same God is here the same God that
[56:09] was in the prophet he said you is in me
[56:11] as the brother was saying the other time
[56:13] he was saying that
[56:16] um
[56:17] when
[56:20] naturally
[56:21] somebody do something bad to you brother
[56:23] Bill
[56:25] and the person is tormenting you do
[56:28] something wrong oh you're gonna give him
[56:30] like this
[56:32] but with the love of God will let you
[56:35] pray for his soul but those things you
[56:37] cannot do it I cannot do it but God has
[56:42] to do that unconsciously through you and
[56:44] me like example when brah Brahm had that
[56:47] encounter with that maniac
[56:52] he said that when the man was coming to
[56:55] him some love
[56:57] came to him that he can't explain it he
[57:00] wished he's in that condition all the
[57:02] time and that love of God it was it
[57:06] defeated the devil
[57:07] so all that we have to do Just Surrender
[57:09] ourselves when the time comes out God
[57:12] wants us to project that love he'll let
[57:15] us project it if sometimes through some
[57:17] people are so
[57:19] stubborn that he wants us to use King
[57:21] like the Lord said use came in the
[57:23] church to wipe them you're gonna let us
[57:26] wipe because sons and daughters are led
[57:28] by the spirit of God
[57:30] God don't expect to just be only one way
[57:32] because the devil will just know all
[57:34] your trust but one time God will allow
[57:37] you to just be quiet and let somebody go
[57:39] and that time we're gonna let you to
[57:41] discipline that and say no you can't do
[57:43] that here he is God
[57:45] I remember one time in the early
[57:48] 1999 to late 1992 000.
[57:52] I went to the bank to cash a check and
[57:56] the lady was so mean to me
[57:58] normally if I go to bank and somebody I
[58:00] said give my check to me let me go Maria
[58:02] go another place but this time
[58:05] she was so mean to me but something I
[58:08] don't know what happened I started
[58:10] praying my heart for unconsciously I
[58:13] didn't put up to that
[58:15] within a short time
[58:17] everything was changed she came back and
[58:20] she was so happy to do whatever I want
[58:22] for him for her I want from her why the
[58:26] love of God project through me and did
[58:28] that says the other situation you do it
[58:32] differently because it's not God is not
[58:35] the Sons and Daughters of God I led by
[58:39] the spirit of God
[58:41] so they can act as a lion one time it
[58:45] can act as a lamb
[58:47] but God chooses when to do it all that
[58:50] you have to do to heal yourself to him
[58:52] and he will flow through us the way he
[58:55] wants to flow is not by might or power
[58:58] but by my spirit says the Lord it
[59:02] depends on what you give to God
[59:05] that's what God gonna use like something
[59:11] when he got a situation there was
[59:14] nothing for something to use they took a
[59:16] Jawbone that's why he has and God used
[59:20] that job to do their job one time Moses
[59:24] used as a slingshot
[59:25] do their job so it depends on what you
[59:29] give to God
[59:31] he will use whatever tool you give to
[59:34] him if you give him
[59:38] if you give him all of yourself you're
[59:42] gonna use all of yourself
[59:44] it depends on how much because God
[59:47] doesn't force himself on you and on me
[59:50] he's a gentle God
[59:52] he gave us a free moral agency but he
[59:56] being God knows that you were there with
[59:58] him before the foundations of the world
[1:00:00] so the female regions that he gave us we
[1:00:03] give it back to him
[1:00:05] and he said Lord has to you we give you
[1:00:08] everything take control use this for
[1:00:11] your own Glory we don't want you to be
[1:00:13] only our state there by you we want you
[1:00:15] to be our lordship Lord means that full
[1:00:18] control full Authority fools control
[1:00:22] through everything he controls all your
[1:00:24] move your actions your everything the
[1:00:27] Lord says Christ controls it that's why
[1:00:30] much we have given to him the bride of
[1:00:33] Christ God is the new doing the same
[1:00:35] thing he hasn't changed he's the same
[1:00:37] yesterday today and forever our God is
[1:00:42] marching on brothers and sister let's
[1:00:45] match with him let's go with the tune of
[1:00:47] the word don't let's stay behind those
[1:00:50] that stand behind the way God beat those
[1:00:52] that stay behind they couldn't make it
[1:00:53] let's move let's march on the movie song
[1:00:57] Brothers is that the movie song my
[1:00:59] sister let's move on brother move on
[1:01:01] sister this is the moving day there is
[1:01:04] no other day there's the time to move on
[1:01:06] let's move on with the scripture let's
[1:01:08] move on with the word of God he's the
[1:01:10] same yesterday to them forever as God
[1:01:13] has never changed amen God loves you he
[1:01:16] loves me
[1:01:18] and one more one last thing that I'm
[1:01:19] gonna just conclude
[1:01:22] that
[1:01:23] last week after church service I had a
[1:01:27] big
[1:01:28] toothache I couldn't but God has a sense
[1:01:30] of humor I couldn't sleep on not this
[1:01:33] standing the Sunday before the whole
[1:01:35] night I couldn't sleep
[1:01:36] and then
[1:01:38] I went to the doctor because he did
[1:01:41] um
[1:01:42] put some gold on it and everything about
[1:01:46] 2014 it cost me a lot of money almost
[1:01:48] two thousand dollars so this doctor I
[1:01:50] don't want to take it out and I'm still
[1:01:52] feeling the pain he said I'll keep it
[1:01:54] I'll keep it
[1:01:55] and then
[1:01:57] I came home on Monday I started having
[1:01:59] the pain I said please take it away from
[1:02:02] me he took it I'm still feeling the pain
[1:02:05] and
[1:02:07] coming home
[1:02:09] driving
[1:02:11] and then I first time maybe I've had it
[1:02:14] before bed maybe I wasn't conscious of
[1:02:17] that you know and then I heard Brown
[1:02:19] talking about that if you go to the
[1:02:22] doctor and they take your tooth
[1:02:25] what the doctor has done he has taken
[1:02:27] that tooth out but the actual healing is
[1:02:30] done by God
[1:02:31] there's no medication nothing that can
[1:02:34] heal the truth but it was so funny that
[1:02:36] I'm not maybe I have not I've heard it
[1:02:40] or haven't heard back how come that
[1:02:42] exact time I'm going through that pain
[1:02:47] I had that word of God and he just gave
[1:02:52] me encouragement because that I am the
[1:02:54] Lord God that he let all thy disease
[1:02:57] everything you have no God healed at all
[1:02:59] he's interested in everything about you
[1:03:02] there's nothing later in God take all
[1:03:05] your problems to God he's a friend that
[1:03:08] loves it cares about us every little
[1:03:11] thing that you think is not important
[1:03:12] give it to his hand you are so
[1:03:15] interested even in the life of that
[1:03:17] little fish what about you
[1:03:19] God is interested in everything about
[1:03:23] your life
[1:03:24] so don't try some people I've realized
[1:03:28] that
[1:03:30] their home you call them I have this
[1:03:33] problem I have this problem
[1:03:36] why didn't come to church oh I was going
[1:03:38] through this problem I said why didn't
[1:03:41] you
[1:03:42] bring to the Brethren let's all pray to
[1:03:45] support you because one reaches a
[1:03:47] thousand two which is ten thousand he
[1:03:50] said oh this is the letter three I don't
[1:03:51] want to bother anybody with it but you
[1:03:53] are still struggling with that little
[1:03:55] thing couldn't come couldn't make you
[1:03:56] come to church
[1:03:58] so it's not a little every little thing
[1:04:00] that happens sometimes the devil tried
[1:04:02] to bring this Comfort to you if you
[1:04:04] don't recognize that he's gonna play
[1:04:06] with you and just make a mess that will
[1:04:08] bring little to here this year just to
[1:04:10] distract you so you've got to cast those
[1:04:13] things off
[1:04:14] and if you can't do it by yourself ask
[1:04:17] for a reinforcement
[1:04:19] ask for your Deacon ask for someone to
[1:04:21] support you in prayer
[1:04:23] and get rid of that and that is
[1:04:25] bothering because one will chase a
[1:04:27] thousand two sisters and everything
[1:04:29] whatever you bind on Earth is bound in
[1:04:33] heaven whatever you lose is loose in
[1:04:35] heaven so you have the power in the name
[1:04:38] of Jesus he is giving us authority over
[1:04:41] everything he said the words that I do
[1:04:43] shall you also do greater than this
[1:04:46] shall he was why because the very member
[1:04:48] body that same God is in many member
[1:04:50] body doing so many things he's in you it
[1:04:53] means the greater West than this shall
[1:04:56] you also do if you abide in me in my
[1:04:59] word abide in you ask whatever you want
[1:05:01] and to be given unto you that same God
[1:05:04] is here he's the same yesterday to them
[1:05:07] forever don't worry about it he's in
[1:05:09] control of your life he loves you cares
[1:05:12] for you he's here to bless you he's here
[1:05:15] to give you all the desires of your
[1:05:16] heart he is there to live and direct
[1:05:18] everything that you drink if thou can
[1:05:21] surrender if thou can give him all all
[1:05:23] you all he's more than able to do it
[1:05:26] don't let nothing hinder you I'm gonna
[1:05:29] read this little quote and then wrap up
[1:05:30] very shortly in the greatest battle ever
[1:05:33] fought
[1:05:35] paragraph 104 he said that
[1:05:38] you have to open the Channel first
[1:05:41] you've got to
[1:05:43] get the soldier the Holy Spirit placed
[1:05:47] at the Battlefront
[1:05:49] that tells God's word he is the word and
[1:05:52] he stand there there's nothing going to
[1:05:55] stop it then there's nothing every one
[1:05:58] of other trainers is cleared out just
[1:06:00] like an old boiler with fluent stop up
[1:06:02] you put a fire in it it will blow your
[1:06:04] thing up that's what the matter with so
[1:06:07] many blowed up Christians it's because
[1:06:09] that they don't clean the channels out
[1:06:12] they don't go down the inside you've got
[1:06:15] to
[1:06:16] clean it conscious memory thought laying
[1:06:20] aside everything and coming from the
[1:06:24] inside out with that Arnold dreaded word
[1:06:26] of God that is the truth let's clean all
[1:06:30] the China stuff let's get rid of all the
[1:06:32] malice the hatred all those things that
[1:06:35] is not true outside people I'm fed up
[1:06:38] I'm just people just long skirts and
[1:06:41] nice suit and everything but remember
[1:06:42] they might have some malice and all
[1:06:44] those who hiding there God wants all
[1:06:46] those cockroaches to come up Let the
[1:06:48] Fire of God burn everything all like
[1:06:50] Christ for me so that God can have that
[1:06:52] premise and flow the way he wants to
[1:06:55] flow oh in the AI what he can saw
[1:06:58] something and they affected the whole
[1:07:00] church the whole congregation
[1:07:02] check your life and see things that
[1:07:04] you're doing that doesn't come to affect
[1:07:06] the rest of us okay my reality between
[1:07:09] myself I got to make things right to God
[1:07:11] you have to do your part because it's
[1:07:14] time that God wants to move his children
[1:07:15] to another level amen because it's
[1:07:18] Joshua time
[1:07:20] amen the Holy Ghost is moving on all
[1:07:23] right it's your life Christ want us to
[1:07:25] get it from every part so that he can
[1:07:27] have that preeminence and floatress
[1:07:30] let's make things right
[1:07:32] let God not reminisce
[1:07:35] amen praise God that's what I have for
[1:07:37] tonight brother Anthony I don't I got a
[1:07:40] long long speaker so that's it I have
[1:07:46] praise God
[1:08:01] [Applause]
[1:08:20] for the first time I noticed it while
[1:08:24] the brother was reading the scriptures
[1:08:25] that says and God's fake unto Joshua the
[1:08:30] Son of God right and I told him I'm
[1:08:33] going to speak unto you then I realized
[1:08:36] that when you go to Exodus you know the
[1:08:39] radicals Numbers Deuteronomy
[1:08:41] everywhere is saying and God spake unto
[1:08:44] Moses
[1:08:45] saying just us but now God is telling
[1:08:49] Joshua there's a change here
[1:08:52] I'm not going to talk to you
[1:08:55] Moses is now dead
[1:08:57] so I'm going to talk to you
[1:09:00] and we want to thank God for this new
[1:09:02] generation that we have here
[1:09:05] that Moses is dead and that the Holy
[1:09:08] Spirit has chosen this generation that
[1:09:11] he will speak through them
[1:09:13] and he there will be his voice
[1:09:17] to all that are around praise the Lord
[1:09:20] because remember we still have to carry
[1:09:24] on end time evangelism
[1:09:26] an end time evangelism is to what to the
[1:09:30] last of the elect that may still be out
[1:09:32] there but to souls that are imprisoned
[1:09:36] now they still have to have a witness
[1:09:39] praise the Lord so that word comes in
[1:09:42] this Joshua generation I call it that
[1:09:46] God is using and will go and is going to
[1:09:49] use even more and it's going to unfold
[1:09:52] but let's end it there and let the Lord
[1:09:55] Jesus have his way thank God for
[1:09:58] anointing all these brothers using them
[1:10:01] in various individual ways to express
[1:10:04] himself for his glory and honor God
[1:10:07] bless your brother Anthony you're gonna
