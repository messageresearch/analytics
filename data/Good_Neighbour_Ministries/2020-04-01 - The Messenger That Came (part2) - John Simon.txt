TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning friends it's good to be with you together again what a joy on this Sunday morning they give praise and honor and glory to the name of our God I'd like to read from Scripture today and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things but I see unto you that Elias is come already and they knew him not but what but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the Son of man supper for them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father we are so happy to come into your divine presence through the precious blood of Christ and by this great Holy Spirit father we join our hearts and hands and voices where ever we are within our homes within our cars on the road wherever the believers are scattered around the world we pray that the Great Holy Spirit will fall upon them father enter their place wherever they are anoint them with your divine presence prepare every heart to receive the word as we speak the word and at the end of all this father save souls change hearts deliver men women we pray and Lord shine your light upon the word for we ask it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen now in the first part of this sermon called the messenger that came I concluded by saying we should appreciate what the Lord has done for us and sure love and our gratitude to him by the godly lives that we live I showed to you furthermore in the Word of God that the bright shining star that led the wise men to the Lord Jesus Christ as that star moved in the heavens and led the wise men in have in the heavens on the earth as that was a sign of John the Baptist the the star messenger of that age coming on the scene to lead the elected of that day to the perfect light which is Jesus Christ the Word made flesh in that day now that was the gospel light shining in the morning-time of the gospel to the eastern people but how blessed we are in this day in this time that till the Western people God sent a prophet to us with a spirit that was upon John the spirit of Elijah and that great shining light shone among us called the 20th century prophet his name being William Marion brand him I'm an anointed of God and used mightily to spark the modern day revival that has swept the world all around the world the way we are today let me take God for him now here is what he has said clearly in the Word of God now listen if John brought forth his message and heralded the first coming of Christ and Elijah comes in the last name the Prophet said it shall be light in the evening time in other words there would be a light in the evening time I believe that shining light was the life message ministry of our precious brother William Marion brand room the Elijah of this hour according to Malachi 4:5 I will send on to you Elijah the Prophet and how he would turn the hearts of the children back to the father's amen how we God listen to that aim shall be like in the evening darkness the world would be in a garden Lil D seein condition when this messenger comes and his message and person would light up the age it would sell afire it would send a light that will shine so that the people that sat in darkness under denominational darkness will see a great light and then a great light shining light would have risen up and has risen up through the Ministry of our precious brother I thank God for him and blessed be the day but my paths cross with his message which has changed my life forever and forever now the evening like the biggest evening light we got is the evening star see the greatest light we got well then it would have to hear all the same message as it was with the other star in other words he will have the same ministry as John the Baptist identified the word for his day and introduced the word for his day to the people of that age so we'll and so has the ministry of this great prophet William Merrin Brandon introduced the Word of God for the hour the person of Jesus Christ in Word form was introduced to us he identified that word of God and here we are today with a revelation of who he is thanks be to God it has to be the same message because John pointed to Jesus Christ and brother branham's ministry pointed to Jesus Christ he never pointed towards himself he always lifted up Jesus Christ one of the most humble men there ever was and Jesus was the very same and center of his entire life and of his entire ministry now we see that it has the same message its heralding the son and speaking of the son that is what he did he herald the coming of the Lord and he spoke about the Lord all the time he lifted up Jesus and by doing that he brought in the third pole which is I if I be lifted up I'll draw all men unto myself and the Word of God in this hour is drawing thousands around the world to this message of the hour and I thank God for it well now we are in the evening time do you believe that weird evening time there's a a wonderful song that says this is the evening time it's later than you a prophetess cross the land take God that this profit crisscross the world and declared his message Amen for the evening time is here and darkness is upon the land the evening lights are here this age is banished away see what I mean this day has passed over and they'll be a heralding another day to come now this wonderful Ministry of this evening star first of all was to let the world know that the stars come out to shine after that the Sun has gone down so that star reflecting the message of the seventh church age messenger that age had to die out and as it died out it gave way to the birth of the coming of the Lord Himself by the opening of the seventh seal and when the Sun rises or it becomes the rising of the Sun then it is a new day and then that evening star that heralded the coming of the up of the evening time must now fade away fading away like the stars of the morning losing their light in the glorious Sun Oh think of this my brother's my sister's here today this wonderful marvelous ministry I'm trying to get to you the importance then aníbal purpose and the Magnificent use of this prophet that God made made use of this prophet and the Spirit of God spoke through this prophet so that you and I may reckon the Word of God for our day and for our season we realize friends that the true light is now shining thanks be to God and a new day is dawning thank God now remember back in the Bible days in the time of John the Jews thought they needed a general a great general to arrange from amongst them another Gideon or sod you know chapter or one of these other Jewish generals to rise up and deliver them from the hands of domination among the of the Romans at that time but instead of a great general God sent them a baby God sent his son God sent his son God sent a lamb God sent to them brother sister the Lamb of God our Redeemer to redeem all mankind God sent him on this earth for that purpose and in our day we find out with all the viruses special ences troubles and trials all the various situations that circumstances have taken place in the world there is a great desire for a super smart and super intelligent person to come on the scene and to provide the leaders of the world and the nations of the world with answers to their questions but we know Jesus is the answer Jesus is the answer to all their longing Jesus is the answer to all their needs all they need is only Jesus only Jesus for only Jesus can satisfy thanks be to God yes sir you're looking for a redeemer and they need a redeemer they need a redeemer and the only Redeemer that can really redeem their soul and the only mediator between God and man is the Lord Jesus Christ for there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we know Acts chapter 4 verse 12 Paul said clearly when they asked him were men and brethren what shall we do he said repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved yes sir now we understand clearly my friends that here that this great John the Baptist of that day a man came and introduced a redeemer and his redeemer was the Word made flesh that same anointing upon this precious brother bring him also came to bring us a redeemer but our Redeemer is not a man of flesh our Redeemer is the same word of God but not in the flesh form in the word form and we have to recognize Christ revealed or revealing himself in his own word for Christ is the mystery of God now being revealed God now being his own interpreter God now making his word plain to his wife to his elected seed to Abraham's seed who will recognize him for he when he the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth and show you things to come this is why the Holy Spirit is here this is why this mess just come to us to guide us to the perfect light clearly as we look in the word we see here that he came to claim all the names in the book and he has laid down his life to be our Redeemer and to take our place at Calvary right now in the world today we see many doctors nurses paramedics and people in the health field are passing away in Italy 10,000 in the United States some are dying in Canada some are dying around the world why with their selfless nature they are going and tending to the sick and the afflicted and the troubled and giving their lives that others might live in this true sense the real Redeemer the real physician the real Savior is Jesus Christ our Lord who gave his life for all he lived on his life that we may go free that we may be forgiven that we may walk away knowing that he has shed his blood and paid the price that he died so we may not die in that way or be set to a devil hill but be free to live an abundant life a wonderful life a saved life of godly life a Christian life a change lifestyle walking in the light of God's Word for this day and for this hour now Christ a new day is dawning the Sun is rice has risen up upon us and Christ is coming again he is coming again and so there had to be a forerunner like it was the first time they had to be a forerunner of the Covenant as it was the first time and now in our day there has been a forerunner in our day and that name of that 4runner is not John the Baptist mentioned in the Bible the Bible is written and there nothing to be added to it but in our day God sent a prophet and his name as William Marion Branham a man just like you and I am man anointed of God and used by the Spirit of God God just used his body to speak through him and we have to discern the Lord's body and recognize that God's boys speaking through him was the voice of God speaking to us in this day and hour he was a forerunner of the covenant for this day thank God he introduced the cocoanut introduced the promise of God for this day and for this hour that he promised that the Son of Man would be revealed again when the conditions are like in the days of lot as it was in the days of Noah that would repeat again and we see the same conditions are here upon us and a forerunner has come with that Elijah's spirit to bring that wonderful covenant to us that we might recognize ourselves hallelujah so brother Branham introduced the covenant to us brother Branham introduced the covenant Oh wonderful day to this wonderful bride yes sir he introduced to us they the agreement between God and man that is what he introduced the brides covenant and you remember in the Old Testament Abraham had a covenant with God and then God spoke to him and made him a promise how that this great Abraham how he would have a son then we understand Abraham in the expectation of that coming son and while he was waiting with expectation on the arrival of that coming son himself and Sara began to experience a change in their body or a body change they were being transformed by God's power to transform that was released from that promise into his life and he waited on God and we know in the scriptures it came to pass so is it in our day that we are being introduced by this covenant messenger to the promise of God for our day amen that Jesus is coming again that the Son of Man would be revealed that he has a place prepared for us there is a rapture at hand and the Saints will be caught out of it the bride will not the God's wife will not go through the tribulation but she will be taken up and out before the tribulation and we are resting upon that marvelous and wonderful promise thank God Abraham had a covenant and a bride had a covenant in other words she she got her agreement with God her promise with God for marriage certificate with God her grace covenant that she would be treated by God's grace in this day and hour so what we have is the bride's covenant it's the bride's merits of the Vicki it's the it's God's grace covenant to her that no matter what she does no matter how she acts god still proves that he loves her has promised her that loving his own he will love them onto the until the very end of time and beyond the end of time throughout all eternity this is a great and wonderful story the story of God and his brain and his wonderful people now we understand friends that when the word Christ was introduced to us we believed or accepted the word which fully redeemed us when we became United with the word in other words by uniting with the word it placed us back into a rightful position right to his side where we originally came from this is just a symbol that we were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and here we are being placed back original back into our position and we are given back or brought to the awareness or brought out the word spiritual amnesia that we have and possess eternal life we never began because we were a part of him and we will never end because we are a part of him and cannot die spiritually as much as God can't die this old flesh that we have to fight with every day that may fall to the ground but that man inside is being renewed day by day by the power of the Holy Ghost God's power that worketh in us to change us and to transform us and confirm us into the image of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ how marvelous hallelujah that's it be the name the Lord amen our bridegroom is coming our great groom is on the way and I want to thank God for it hallelujah it's so much I'm I'm so happy about this that when I lay upon my bed brothers and sisters I'll tell you I can lay down and sleep with a peace in my heart knowing that I am the redeemed I am rejoicing that I have poor unpossessed total deliverance because he has redeemed me by his precious blood and cleanse my heart opened my eyes to recognize my day and message that applies to my day and understand that I might have the understanding by opening the eyes of my heart to recognize who he is in his blessed holy and precious word thanks be to God forevermore oh yes sir the things God has given to us no man can really live up to it just as much as no person could have lived up to the Ten Commandments they could live up to it without some flaw somewhere oh my and now we see a prophet coming bringing to us the stature of a perfect man bringing to us the full word and and here we are yeah we naturally as human beings to try to live up to that we fail over and over again we fail but thanks be to God has given us the brides Covenant the Abraham's covenant which we are trusting on hallelujah amen we were predestinated to this we did not plan this we did not choose him he said I have chosen you you have not chosen me thanks be to God oh my god before the foundations of the world his love projected God so loved the world that is love projected and when his love projected his grace followed it to stretch for us to find us and to place us restore us back to our original position where we came from oh my take God for this wonderful coming on of grace that God gave to Abraham God said to Abraham Abraham listen this covenant I'm giving you you don't have to do anything the normal covenant is usually you do this and I'll do that if you do this I will do that in Abraham's covenant which is better known as the unconditional covenant there were no conditions attached there was no works attached there was nothing Abraham had to say or do it was just freely given Abraham was not worthy he was an idol worshiper from the plains of Shinar coming out worshiping all those torn gods but God always Grace not that he was better than any one else in that day and in that hour but God through His grace elected and chose Abraham and so has the same God and I'm day elected and chosen you and chosen me chosen us to walk in the light of his word we all blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus Abraham you don't have to do anything nothing at all I've already done it for you thanks be to God oh jesus said that day would repeat again Abraham you don't have to do one thing I've done it all for you as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the day when the son of man is being revealed luck was in Sodom down in Sodom in the plains while Abraham was up on the top of the mountain and on the top of the mountain he was receiving a promise God came to him in a theophany and spoke to him and said your wife Sarah will bear a son oh yes brother wonderful and so that scene repeats again in our day look while all people are misled caught up with all kinds of creeds and dogmas and doctrines and denominationalism and systems and all types of things are out there flying around catching and attracting the minds of the people but God already claimed purpose and pointed this out by prophecy there will be some of Abraham's seed or people like Abraham in spirit that will be upon the earth at that time and they will receive me amen thanks be to God God visited Abraham and God has visited us through a message from a prophet coming into our lives God not God in the form he was back there with Abraham but now not in the theophany but in a Word form God has visited us and we have recognized him as Abraham recognized him when Abraham saw those tree men coming towards him he didn't answer Oh Blessed Trinity oh I'm so thankful that you came to me no he looked and said my lord my lord and even so we who have heard this this doctrine of the Trinity which is absolutely only a new doctrine Babylonian doctrine from the 300 ad s around that time and before taught by the Babylonians and other nations around the world and then adopted into Christianity at 325 80 we have recognized the falsity of that we have recognized the perversion of the word of God like Abraham we look at three but we see one God here o Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord this same Jesus only one Lord is both Lord and Christ o faithful we are that our eyes have been opened in this day and in this hour aren't you happy here today to recognize that you can see God and God gave you the eyes to see because unto them it is not given but unto you it is given to know the mystery and to see the mystery of the kingdom of God it's hid from them but it's a revelation to you and I by God's wonderful marvelous grace I'm so thankful to God that he's the same yesterday today and forever and I love him with all of my heart thanks be to God we're living in a tremendous times tremendous times trouble sometimes are here filling men's hearts with fear freedom we all hold dear now is at stake humble your heart to God saves from the chastening rod seeks the way pilgrim strong Christians awake Jesus is coming soon morning or night or noon many well me there do trumpets will sound all the death shall arise righteously in the sky going where no one dies heavenward bound we're bound for the rapture we're bound for the promised land even in the midst of these troubles sometimes that we are living in no more we have to worry about anything because the world has been shut off from this but God has come and has whispered and is whispering love secrets in the ears of his wife for the marriage of the land the Uniting time of the lamb and his bride the invisible union has come and and the wife has made herself ready for she is no more a bride but she is a wife now for she has received his word and gives glory and praise to his wonderful and precious name thank god there's no more me having to wonder you having to wonder if you're a real Christian if you're a true believer if you can backslide if you can be lost not in a situation or a condition and attitude where you are not certain of God but like Paul we can say I am persuaded Amen I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day I know my sins are gone we must be certain our sins are gone I rebuke every spirit of condemnation and guilt from you repent turn if you know you have done something wrong and out of line then turn to God your heavenly Father and ask for his divine forgiveness and he will set you free God has already done it for you he's done it for us and just completed the work he's completed all of his work and we are asked to enter in to what is already provided for us thank God it's not redemption for for one week or for a month or for two years or three years of the minute you slip or make that mistake whoa I'm lost again no this is Redemption forever amen because if you are an eternal son of God you did not just get eternal life on a certain day eternal means without a beginning and without and in which means that you had no beginning and you will have no end you come from God and you're going right back to God where you come from as one of his children if you're a child of God that statement child of God already reveals to you that you must be an eternal being that comes from the far reaches of eternity now you are being expressed manifested and revealed in time but you're going back to God where you come from thanks be to his wonderful and precious name oh yes sir we have to we are whole so happy that we have redemption forever and we are never going to die our our soul will not die only the soul that sinneth it shall die because it didn't come from God it wasn't in the mind of God it wasn't there with him but we were with him and in him no expressed in this hour and Christ The Anointed word is the mystery of God now being revealed the word made flesh and the flesh being made word going back to the Godhead traveling back home to God where we come from Jew drops going back where they come from pulled by the power of the Sun but I am lifted up I'll draw all men unto myself and that is what he is doing here today by his wonderful and marvelous grace hallelujah my brother sister saint of God I I trust that we don't take these things for granted but we will recognize our position and keep our lamps trimmed and brighter and burning for the glory of God now in the Book of Luke chapter 15 verses 8 to 10 it is written either what woman have ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece don't not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently until she find it and when she had found it she call it her friends and her neighbors together saying rejoice with me for I have found the peace which I have lost likewise I say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth oh thanks I praise God for his love that this wonderful woman found that coin she found that wonderful coin that she had lost and while we're talking about that friends I believe it's lamp trimming time for us I believe we ought to sweep our lives that woman lost the coin she lit a candle first secondly she began to sweep her house all the dust all day the excess garbage rubbish she swept her house that's what she did let the candle begin to swept the house she searched thirdly she began to search and by searching she found a coin we must do the same thing let's search our lives let's sweep out the things that are not of God brother sister like a candle the Word of God can be lit up cast the light of the Word of God upon your life and that word of God will will show you the little things whether you are a believer you're just a person that doesn't have anything to do with God or Church or whether you've been a believer for years let the light of God's Word search through your life as we say search me O God and try my heart today see if there be any wicked way in me and hence me from every sin I ask it in Jesus name then brother sister then as it searches through your heart then go forth and let him cast out everything that is unlike like himself and praise his wonderful name truly I thank him for the light of the word and where he leads me I will follow I will follow Jesus all the way one time rather Brandon was up in a place called Mills Ville and there was a Church of Christ brother there and he approached brother Branham and said brother Branham I see you're talking about healings about all these miracles but signs and wonders III can't see that stuff I just can't see it brother Brandon he said brother Branham was talking to him after a church service of course and said to him brother he says to him brother outside of the church where do you live he says oh I I live over the hill brother Branham Oh brother man said oh you live over the hill well how how do you how do you see to get there because it's dark between this hill and that hill for for you to get home it's pretty dark how do you see he said well of course brother Branham I I carry a light I walk with the light so where the band said so that light that you walk with shines all the way from the church where we are standing here all the way to your home and you see your home from here in the church yard all the way before you're going to start walking he's an apostle I where I live and I just shine that light and I just go one step at a time walking in the light brother Branham said so is it with Jesus Christ brother you don't see it all at one time amen amen isn't that right one step at a time we don't see everything in God's world at one time we don't see the entire journey at one time but one day at a time one step at a time we walk in the light as he is in the light amen that is what we are supposed to do we as Christians don't mature into mature Christians overnight but here a little there a little one revelation here one thought there one little thing here and we begin to grow and and be nourished in the grace of the Living God one son I have it just written on this flight leaf I'm following Jesus one step at a time I live for the moment in his love divine his presence grows sweeter each moment each name I'm following Jesus each step of the way or believer I want to say don't be discouraged if you think you do not understand all of God's Word or you do not see all of the message of the hour that's yet just take it one day at a time one step at a time just follow the Lord Jesus Christ in the opening of his word just live for the moment in his marvelous love divine of course I've just made the point that spiritual growth is gradual day by day line upon line precept upon precept here a little there a little see just like in a human body cell up on top of cell builds the human body so word upon word revelation upon revelation from listening to the sermons of the prophet of this day which is important especially in this time when we have this season when we're at home listen to the prophets messages we need no one else to prompt us to listen to the prophets messages but we should go and feed from the storehouse which is their Word of God there is no place where there is a storehouse there is no barn or building no organization that is a storehouse the storehouse is the word of God the unfailing reality of the word of the Living God which comes my revelation from God himself and comes to you so feed on the word that comes true the sermons of the prophet of God feed also upon the sermons of your pasture wherever you are God has given that pasture you you feed on the messages that's coming through the mouth of your pastor as he is anointed by the Holy Spirit God to bring the Word of God feed upon the world that comes through the mouth of the gods sent God anointed God vindicated fivefold ministry as the prophet of God has said I am only hitting the highlights but when when them young men come amen yes sir they'll break the entire thing down and they'll bring it to you they'll just present it to you I'm just hitting the highlights so now I believe we're living in dismay this hour and this time the Word of God coming to you God interpreting its own word amen the fan fine fingers is in his hand by fingers fivefold ministry in his hand and he'll use them to thoroughly purge his floor his thrashing floor but his wonderful grace hallelujah praise God for evermore I'm happy to say I am one of them you say oh they're holy rollers oh then they act like they're Pentecostals oh he's a fanatic I am a fanatic in the sense that I've been to the Attic and I've come back down with the glory of God within my heart praise be to God I'm following Jesus he one step at a time I live for the moment in his love divine his his love grows sweeter each moment each day I'm following Jesus each step of the way I'm following him each step of the way I can't see all the way but one day at a time one step at a time hallelujah praise be to God what a great honor this is I'm so excited brother sister are we all were sinners and God by His grace has changed of our lives but we have seen this great power where this great glorious shine light hey man has broken true to us and I'm not speaking about brother branham here now I'm speaking about the great shining light of the word of God breaking the light has suddenly turned on and you recognize who you are and who God is and he makes himself known to you and places you positionally back where you come from I'm so happy I thank God hallelujah it's good when the sister could rejoice in the Lord rejoice in the Lord and again I say rejoice hallelujah this is the day where a man or a woman can receive the Holy Ghost without sensation and without exhibition of human emotion nevertheless if you truly have the Holy Ghost you are going to show some emotion somewhere because if a baby is truly born and it's not stillborn it's gonna scream and shout and it's going to shout and give glory happy its mother is there it might be wailing away but that baby is exhibiting and showing that it has life let me repeat this is the hour any man any woman any person can receive the Holy Spirit without sensation or emotional exhibition a exhibition isn't but nevertheless if you truly have the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit will expressions are true you with emotions also thanks be to God for a marvelous wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost thanks be to God the evening lights have come it is a fact that God and Christ are one we'll walk in the light such a beautiful line walk where the dew drops of mercies are bright shine all around us by day and by nine it is Jesus he's the light of the world god bless you today my brothers and sisters I want to thank God for the messenger that came thank God God allowed that messenger through the medium of his message to pass my way and he had that message had to pass my way for I was blind like blind Bartimaeus and the Holy Spirit had to pass my way think of it one day brother sister how that this great wonderful hour I heard a sound like the Apostles acts 2:4 which said they heard a sound from heaven a rustling as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the place in which they were sitting brothers sisters I think I hear that same sound passing here today by God's grace a heavenly sound a sound from heaven if the wind of the Holy Spirit passing true what is it it's the great evil has spread his wings and he's passing over the land a barnyard of this world and he's calling out his own with a scream through that prophet of the hour calling out his own to recognize the tone the voice they that the voice of the great eagle calling to the spirit of they are these people - the to that Caesar that's in you God spirit calling out you don't know what it is but you recognize there's something back there and it's calling me the deep calls to the deep and the deep will respond my sheep will hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow on the great Eagle searching in this hour for his own and passing over the barnyard of this rotten stinking deluded in the seed lived easy and age and saying son daughter child what are you doing in that junkyard of filth that's out there come out of that junkyard you got two wings use the old and new Testament use the Word of God as your wings and fly up into my presence here and here we are in the presence of the Living God and while God is speaking to us telling us we're going into a rapture I'm taking you into a rapturing condition and you're going out of here and as little children of God as Eagles of God we take our beaks and we hold on to one of the ik wills on our father Eagles wing and grab ahold of it because he's going to take us for a flight look but before that flight he begins to flap his wings he begins to flap his wings and the wind from his wings begins to blow away all the loose feathers from our lives all the junk all the bad habits all of the mistakes all of the faults he identifies you and you recognize yourself being exposed and examined by the Word of God thanks be to God that his passing my way here today thanks being a God he's passing in my home today thanks me that God is passing through my life today may he pass through your life for his glory and honor and when he does grab a hold of one of his promises of his word grab a haul of one quill oh because this great people must found us and he is going to take a flight don't you realize saying to God we are already a taxiing into the rapture in flight that we are about to take we are on the taxi we're on the ramp right now this's thing is about to take off and break us into the presence of your mighty God forevermore heading for the eternal home I am bound for the promised land I said I'm bound for the promised land who will come and go with me I am bound for the promised land God has found us and we have found him and nothing can change that nothing can take it away none can separate us from the love of God which is in the Lord Jesus Christ amen I can see little David by the river and he's playing his harp as I'm about to conclude this message here he is playing on his little harp by the rivers of Babylon there we sat down when we remembered Zion and then the scripture says in Psalm 126 one two three when the Lord turned our captivity we were like them that dream then was our hearts filled with with singing and our mouths with laughter for he said the Lord has done great things for us we're off we're glad why shouldn't I praise the Lord why shouldn't a Christian be happy why
