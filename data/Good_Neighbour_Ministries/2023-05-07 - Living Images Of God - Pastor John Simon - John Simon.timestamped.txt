[41:45] all here today we're very happy to be in
[41:49] the house of the Lord please be seated
[41:51] just for a moment
[41:56] is with great uh sadness of course we'd
[42:00] like for you to know of the passing of
[42:04] sister Elaine uh Brennan's mother
[42:08] she's gone on to be with the Lord and
[42:12] just to let you know that so that when
[42:15] you see her again you may be able to
[42:18] express your heart's feelings amen so
[42:22] it's good to be here we want to consider
[42:25] the word of God for us today
[42:28] last week of course
[42:31] um
[42:32] we had a good time in the presence of
[42:34] the Lord and we've come on to be with
[42:37] him now once again next week uh trust in
[42:42] the Lord will be together again here
[42:46] giving Glory To His Marvelous and
[42:48] wonderful name amen praise the Lord I
[42:51] hardly saw you in the back layer sister
[42:53] God bless you my condolences
[42:57] amen praise the Lord God bless you
[43:00] everyone thank you so much for your
[43:02] service to the Lord God bless you richly
[43:09] today we want to go back to the Book of
[43:14] Exodus and we'd like to read from Exodus
[43:19] chapter 20. and reading verses 1 2 6.
[43:29] it's very familiar
[43:32] I know you're aware of it
[43:34] but just something that the Lord
[43:37] of course the prophet knew all of this
[43:40] but it only breaks to you when you need
[43:43] to know it
[43:47] and I thank the Lord for it Exodus 1
[43:50] scriptures will go up there no doubt
[43:54] and
[43:55] God spake all these words saying
[44:03] I am the Lord thy God
[44:06] which brought thee out of the land of
[44:10] Egypt
[44:11] out of the house of bondage
[44:15] Thou shalt have no other gods before me
[44:21] Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven
[44:26] image or any likeness of anything
[44:31] that is in heaven above or that is in
[44:36] the earth beneath or that is in the
[44:40] water under the Earth
[44:44] Thou shalt not bow down to
[44:49] thyself to them nor serve them
[44:53] for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God
[44:57] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[45:00] upon the children and upon the third and
[45:03] fourth generation of them that hate me
[45:09] and showing Mercy
[45:11] unto thousands of them that love me and
[45:16] keep my Commandments
[45:18] let us pray
[45:20] our righteous Heavenly Father
[45:24] Grant utterance
[45:26] and may the Holy Spirit bless our hearts
[45:30] together as we come to the banqueting
[45:33] house of God and a feast from the Lord's
[45:37] table and a drink from his Fountain
[45:41] thank you Lord for this last serving of
[45:45] the wine we give you glory and honor and
[45:49] praise father that we were chosen to
[45:52] participate in this time of the wedding
[45:56] Feast May the Holy Spirit bless us as we
[46:00] gather with one purpose father to hear
[46:03] Thy word to glorify thy name and carry
[46:08] out the mission you've given us here on
[46:11] the earth be asking in Jesus name amen
[46:15] and amen hallelujah God bless you
[46:18] everyone please be seated
[46:22] the thought that I would like I will be
[46:25] bringing today
[46:29] is based on the thought of
[46:34] images
[46:36] because you remember God in the
[46:39] scripture here says you shall not uh you
[46:44] know have any graven images
[46:47] a direct command
[46:51] from God
[46:53] now you've got churches founded on
[46:55] worshiping images
[46:57] you got churches uh founded on
[47:00] worshiping idols
[47:02] but lest we think they are alone they
[47:07] are not alone
[47:08] for brother Branham said it's in the
[47:10] heart of man to worship
[47:13] and he has to worship something
[47:17] and when he doesn't know what he has to
[47:20] worship
[47:21] he is now groping to find what he should
[47:25] worship
[47:27] so he's searching and heal he he'll
[47:30] carve something and try to call that God
[47:33] and worship it because he's in spiritual
[47:36] ignorance not knowing who he should
[47:39] worship
[47:40] uh uh if it's an alligator
[47:44] as the prophet starts where he said you
[47:47] go to Africa you go to India you go to
[47:49] various places he says you'll see them
[47:52] carving Idols images
[47:55] their carbon image of a crocodile
[47:58] and they'll even throw their babies in
[48:01] the river for the crocodile to eat
[48:03] believing that it's God
[48:05] or a monkey or or or you'll find
[48:10] um all these a snake or a woman you know
[48:14] a Venus
[48:17] or Isis whoever but they'll carve a
[48:22] shape
[48:23] they'll carve a form
[48:26] that they believe that is God and they
[48:29] need to worship it
[48:31] that is not necessarily a form for
[48:36] condemnation
[48:38] but it's a revelation of ignorance
[48:41] and not knowing when the real true God
[48:46] is revealed to you
[48:48] and you refuse to recognize it
[48:52] or to accept him that is when God turns
[48:57] his wrath upon the third and fourth
[49:00] generation as he has mentioned here for
[49:02] them that hate them because they
[49:04] completely refuse him and want nothing
[49:07] to do with him
[49:10] we're speaking about images
[49:13] and we know we are living in a day of
[49:16] modern paganism
[49:20] it's the most paganistic age we can
[49:23] think about
[49:24] we look back at the people worshiping
[49:27] Stone Idols wooden Idols whatever
[49:30] feathers feathers Idols Birds snakes
[49:35] such a fish in the sea of fish God fire
[49:39] god whatever and there are still
[49:42] religions based on those things today
[49:46] we know it what do you call it
[49:48] zorasterism what do you call it
[49:50] Catholicism what do you call different
[49:52] names and they're worshiping different
[49:56] idols and they try to polish it and tell
[50:00] you that by worshiping that you know
[50:03] it's holy right oh my but now we see
[50:09] paganism even in the natural world
[50:12] because there's the worship of screen
[50:15] idols
[50:16] that is now going on but it doesn't seem
[50:20] serious to the people because they don't
[50:24] actually have an object sitting there
[50:26] that they are bowing down before to
[50:30] worship
[50:31] it it seems like the past Satan is
[50:34] cunning
[50:35] Satan is slick and slimy he knows how to
[50:39] present things
[50:41] so he presents to you uh an idol a
[50:45] screen Idol or some Idol of ever
[50:49] whatever form or field you may be in
[50:52] your idol may be an academic your idol
[50:55] might be an actor an actress a dancer a
[50:58] singer or whatever that couldn't be your
[51:01] idol that you have in your heart
[51:04] and you become of fanatic
[51:08] for that Idol
[51:10] oh my I'm glad my idol is Christ
[51:15] Hallelujah and that I can be a fanatic
[51:19] to him and for him because we went back
[51:23] there with the apostles when they were
[51:25] in the Attic the upper room but right
[51:28] now we have entered the upper room of
[51:30] the revelation of the word of God
[51:33] and therefore we are here to worship
[51:36] enter praise and glorify this marvelous
[51:40] name
[51:42] now God made it plain because he has to
[51:46] do with God has to do with images
[51:49] because he said I met man
[51:52] in my own image
[51:55] right praise God but the devil switched
[51:59] that and caused people to think an image
[52:02] has got to be something physical you see
[52:04] in front of you it's got to be an idol
[52:08] on a wall or something or the other but
[52:11] he's really perverted what God was
[52:14] trying to tell his people
[52:16] right it's perverted it into that glory
[52:20] to God but when you say Idol
[52:23] praise God
[52:25] when you say image what are you talking
[52:28] about
[52:29] now in the book called The Masterpiece
[52:33] brother Branham says you see
[52:37] alangelo had to carve these statues for
[52:42] the Catholic church at that particular
[52:45] time
[52:46] I think I mentioned a few weeks ago how
[52:50] they would see him sometimes standing on
[52:52] the side of the roadway and he's looking
[52:55] at a big rock and gazing at it and
[52:59] people will be wondering what in the
[53:01] world is this man going mad he's looking
[53:05] at a rock and seeing what he could why
[53:10] is he staring at a rock and they asked
[53:12] them Michelangelo why are you staring at
[53:15] this rock he says because I see an angel
[53:19] in that rock
[53:21] right he's seeing an angel in that rock
[53:25] now I'm bringing the thought here which
[53:28] is how it first came to me amen that
[53:32] before any man any human any person can
[53:36] carve an image
[53:38] before they can even put a chisel to a
[53:41] stone they have first of all got to see
[53:45] the image in their mind
[53:47] they got to have a visual image in their
[53:51] mind first of all just like how I had an
[53:56] image of you of every one of you God saw
[54:01] you before the foundation of the world
[54:06] and he had he had an image of you in his
[54:09] mind in his heart before you even got
[54:13] here he said I knew you
[54:16] before you become flesh I know you
[54:21] in other words before you were formed in
[54:25] your mom's womb he said I knew you
[54:28] before you come flesh or visible I
[54:31] already seen you and I knew you and you
[54:35] were in my heart praise God I want you
[54:39] to know you're in God's heart to this
[54:40] living moment that we are living here
[54:42] today praise God so an image
[54:46] the image God is talking about
[54:49] is us the scriptures as I've got to
[54:52] divert again praise God hallelujah now
[54:56] no man has seen God at any time
[54:59] and lived we haven't seen God but yet
[55:04] we were made in His image
[55:07] and in his lightness In His Image
[55:10] spiritually in his likeness physically
[55:13] later on we made in her in his likeness
[55:17] this of course is not the image of God
[55:20] we know that it's a kind of a likeness
[55:24] of it but it's not the image the real
[55:27] image is that Gene that germ the seed
[55:30] that's in your heart that's the real
[55:32] image of God or part of the image not to
[55:36] be precise but the fact is God is unseen
[55:43] and so for God to be seen Hallelujah
[55:47] then he must be able to make himself
[55:51] manifest through his word
[55:54] glory to God
[55:55] one place brother Branham said see I
[55:59] have the quotations here if you don't
[56:01] mind sometimes I'll quote if I feel like
[56:04] it if not I have the quotations here
[56:07] where he says clearly he said you know
[56:11] that how the devil works the devil will
[56:15] work and first of all he'll give some
[56:19] witch doctor a vision
[56:23] they'll go into some place where there's
[56:25] smoking
[56:28] cannabis uh
[56:30] well marijuana that's a very decent name
[56:33] to put to it
[56:34] but
[56:36] they'll be smoking the peace grass or
[56:39] the sweet grass or whatever and uh
[56:43] they're doing it under the it's the
[56:46] devil but they're doing it under the
[56:48] disguise of religion
[56:50] they are doing it under this guise of
[56:52] serving God which God you see but they
[56:56] don't say that yes you're serving God
[56:59] but it's the God of this evil age that
[57:02] will give them a vision
[57:05] and what they will do is from the image
[57:11] that they were given in their thoughts
[57:14] or in their hearts or in their
[57:15] imagination they will now carve a
[57:19] visible Idol
[57:22] a visible mask
[57:25] a visible up
[57:27] a picture
[57:29] right a photograph of course is an idol
[57:31] do but anyway we find out brother
[57:34] sisters that's what it is
[57:37] that that will happen and then
[57:41] by bowing down to serve that
[57:44] they think they are serving that thing
[57:48] or that person
[57:50] that they saw in their spirit
[57:53] when they were in that Vision or in that
[57:56] dream
[57:57] and that's what they're doing in that
[58:00] kind of a way
[58:02] now just to think of it let me put it
[58:06] this way here
[58:08] that
[58:09] quoting brother Branham you see Moses
[58:13] lifted up a brass serpent in the
[58:15] wilderness
[58:17] and so must the son of man be lifted up
[58:20] for the same reason
[58:23] now the serpent was God's provided way
[58:27] for healing for many many years for them
[58:31] and after the serpent
[58:34] the images the people got to worshiping
[58:38] the image of the serpent
[58:43] instead of looking to what that serpent
[58:48] what it stood for
[58:51] right they worship the image of it
[58:55] rather than what it stood for you see
[58:57] what I'm saying in other words those
[58:59] eyeballs Visions those which doctors
[59:01] those priests those whatever they call
[59:05] themselves receive and then their carbon
[59:07] image which is an angel whether it's a
[59:10] obsessed whether it's Mary whether it's
[59:12] Jupiter whether it's Isis whether it's
[59:14] Venus they carve whatever they might
[59:18] have seen but they don't realize what
[59:21] that thing stood for
[59:23] they don't realize what is back of it
[59:25] what is it all about
[59:28] amen praise God but you see they missed
[59:32] it they began to worship and make the
[59:35] image of it we have them even today
[59:38] making the images of it on a little
[59:40] cross and holding it up still believing
[59:42] that it's it's the symbol of healing
[59:45] right see they don't realize the ages of
[59:48] change times have gone on is this making
[59:50] any sense here okay praise the name of
[59:54] the Lord you see for when God made man
[59:58] he made him first in his own image which
[1:00:02] is a spirit image
[1:00:05] but when man put in five senses
[1:00:09] remember he didn't give that for man to
[1:00:13] declare him he gave him it to contact
[1:00:16] his Earthly home
[1:00:18] you see and the scientific part of them
[1:00:22] their tasty smell feel hair but that was
[1:00:26] only to contact their Earthly home but
[1:00:30] the Inside Man see that man which is
[1:00:35] Spirit must contact God do you believe
[1:00:38] that
[1:00:39] see oh and science knows nothing about
[1:00:43] that or think of it man see we say you
[1:00:48] look at the man and you say oh look at
[1:00:50] that man so religious he's in the image
[1:00:54] of God that is not the image of God to
[1:00:59] begin with that is not just the image of
[1:01:03] animal life
[1:01:04] see that's the way it is oh praise God
[1:01:09] hallelujah oh my hour after hour day
[1:01:13] after day our lord Jesus has done his
[1:01:17] work but it will be wonderful
[1:01:20] someday when we set over there under
[1:01:24] them evergreen trees down by the stream
[1:01:28] of life where we'll all be
[1:01:32] all arms will be stacked
[1:01:35] Wars will be over
[1:01:37] the smoke will be gone away no more war
[1:01:42] no more trouble
[1:01:44] no more heartaches all gone no more old
[1:01:49] age when our feet hits that Blissful
[1:01:54] Shore every gray-headed mother or father
[1:01:58] will turn back to young men and young
[1:02:01] women again
[1:02:02] praise God if you don't want to say amen
[1:02:05] I think I'm going to say amen amen
[1:02:10] amen see the atoms of your body will all
[1:02:17] be destroyed
[1:02:19] there will be broken up
[1:02:22] and that contamination from it will have
[1:02:25] to run away into the air amen that
[1:02:30] spirit that will then return back and
[1:02:34] the Rapture will pick up every one of
[1:02:37] those Clans atoms
[1:02:40] and that body will be formed again
[1:02:44] in an immortal image of the Living God
[1:02:48] hallelujah praise God Amen so now you're
[1:02:52] going to have a theophany inside this
[1:02:54] body that is gone God is going to uh
[1:02:57] reconstruct
[1:02:59] right you have spiritual reconstruction
[1:03:01] and the theophany the the immortal will
[1:03:06] then come back in what was Mortal but it
[1:03:09] will be oh he said what a wonderful time
[1:03:12] that will be praise the Lord now the
[1:03:16] first man
[1:03:18] he met the first man in His image
[1:03:22] and we are to return back to that image
[1:03:27] see that's right because that is our
[1:03:31] first created image your theophany
[1:03:36] your theophany is your first created
[1:03:39] image
[1:03:40] and we all have to go right back to that
[1:03:44] Eternal Immortal image that God created
[1:03:47] us in amen not the image that Satan
[1:03:51] falls him is as yet and created you and
[1:03:53] tell you you are that
[1:03:59] the way you behave you are that uh the
[1:04:02] way you act you know maybe your race
[1:04:04] maybe your culture maybe your language
[1:04:07] the devil separates everything and
[1:04:09] breaks everything up oh you are that
[1:04:11] you're different you are that you are
[1:04:13] that and God is saying no I have Men
[1:04:16] book of Acts I have made men of all the
[1:04:20] Earth of all nations of one blood
[1:04:23] amen they are children of the most high
[1:04:27] yet Children of the Living God so
[1:04:30] regardless what do we come from the East
[1:04:32] the West the north the South wherever we
[1:04:35] come from amen we are the redeemed of
[1:04:38] God Gathering back in to go back to the
[1:04:42] immortal image amen for this Mortal must
[1:04:47] put on immortality
[1:04:49] amen praise be the God hallelujah amen
[1:04:53] now
[1:04:55] when God created me I mean me William
[1:05:00] Branham
[1:05:01] I was there before the foundation of the
[1:05:05] world so were you do you believe that
[1:05:08] but my being my spirit I wasn't
[1:05:13] conscious of any of that
[1:05:15] see as far as I know but I was there
[1:05:20] oh
[1:05:21] I hope you're getting it now Jesus told
[1:05:25] his disciples
[1:05:26] he knew them before the foundations of
[1:05:31] the world in one scripture says Jesus
[1:05:34] told them he said I had Joy with you
[1:05:36] before the foundation of the world
[1:05:39] praise the Lord he had Joys with them
[1:05:42] amen Paul says he chose us in him before
[1:05:48] the world began do you believe that
[1:05:51] amen praise God now there was some part
[1:05:56] of me of you of Arman Neville
[1:06:00] of all the rest of you who believe that
[1:06:03] are here that's in Christ before the
[1:06:06] world ever began see there was a part of
[1:06:11] us right there here's my analysis of
[1:06:15] that I think the people today
[1:06:19] are possessed see possessed with this
[1:06:24] Spirit or part of these Angelic being
[1:06:29] these Spirits which rotated of God
[1:06:32] that never fell in the beginning
[1:06:36] and there were the ones that resisted
[1:06:39] the devil's lie when they were up in
[1:06:42] heaven but then sent down here
[1:06:46] amen because they are spirits that
[1:06:49] rotated of God or like Sparks from the
[1:06:53] Anvil oh praise God we come from him
[1:06:56] that is why I I had the thought before
[1:06:59] but this is why I was saying if you're
[1:07:02] lied with the devil up there you're
[1:07:04] gonna lie down here if you fought God
[1:07:07] when you were in his presence up there
[1:07:09] you'll fight him when you're done here
[1:07:11] you resist him in every way because you
[1:07:14] are on that side and you're identifying
[1:07:17] yourself where you come from and who you
[1:07:19] really are
[1:07:22] amen praise the name of the Living God
[1:07:26] now oh praise His name now think of it
[1:07:30] friends
[1:07:31] one day we find that the atoms of this
[1:07:36] body will be destroyed broken up and
[1:07:39] formed back into an immortal image of
[1:07:43] the Living God Amen now
[1:07:46] do you know how many times mothers and
[1:07:50] dads when they are dying
[1:07:53] they turn around and they begin to
[1:07:56] recognize those who have already gone on
[1:07:59] before have you ever any of you ever
[1:08:02] witnessed anything like that already
[1:08:04] they start calling to uncles and aunts
[1:08:07] and they see their cousin over there in
[1:08:10] the sea there aren't over there and you
[1:08:12] think something is wrong with them
[1:08:14] nothing is wrong with them they're
[1:08:16] crossing over and they're starting to
[1:08:18] see in the other land rather than seeing
[1:08:21] back here they're seeing in the other
[1:08:22] land so they're talking about what
[1:08:25] they're seeing in the other land let me
[1:08:27] tell you whether you believe it or not
[1:08:29] there's a land beyond the river that we
[1:08:34] call the sweet forever
[1:08:37] and will only reach that Shore by
[1:08:42] Faith's degree
[1:08:44] one by one will gain the portal
[1:08:49] there to dwell with the
[1:08:52] Immortals when they rent them gold and
[1:08:58] bells for you
[1:09:01] and me oh praise God I don't know about
[1:09:05] you but I can hear the gospel Bells now
[1:09:08] ringing I can hear the word the ring in
[1:09:11] the word ringing out to my spirit and I
[1:09:15] recognize what is really happening amen
[1:09:18] praise God forevermore yes sir how
[1:09:22] wonderful to know that now here's the
[1:09:25] Glorious part on the return of Jesus at
[1:09:28] the resurrection it won't be that body
[1:09:31] that body then that supernatural being
[1:09:35] that God had in the beginning
[1:09:39] that will return to the Earth to get
[1:09:42] another body
[1:09:44] a body not born by a woman
[1:09:48] see but created by God
[1:09:52] to never get old
[1:09:54] never to have any Rickles
[1:09:59] amen
[1:10:03] never to have any wrinkles
[1:10:07] never to have gray hairs on your head

[1:10:15] perfect forever oh hallelujah oh brother
[1:10:19] that should make me shout or even on a
[1:10:22] hot night I will shout him according him

[1:10:28] rise to seize that Everlasting prize and
[1:10:32] Shout while passing through the air amen
[1:10:35] what have I got to worry about the whole
[1:10:38] plan is right here before us if we can
[1:10:41] see it
[1:10:42] God created us in the beginning
[1:10:46] we come down on the Earth
[1:10:49] and I I have taken my place in that plan
[1:10:55] as a gospel preacher
[1:10:58] amen
[1:11:00] or you take your place as a man or woman
[1:11:05] with salvation
[1:11:07] we live this life by the grace of God

[1:11:17] hallelujah hallelujah he says and that
[1:11:21] same Spirit here that was back up yonder
[1:11:26] in the very beginning
[1:11:28] I'll go right back to the consciousness
[1:11:32] of knowing that I've been there
[1:11:36] Hallelujah and then went there blessed
[1:11:41] forever and then when returning back
[1:11:43] I'll take up my body in this very peak
[1:11:48] of death before death ever Struck it

[1:11:55] strikes you do you know this that death

[1:14:05] see sometimes some of us getting fat
[1:14:09] sometimes wrinkles under our eyes others
[1:14:13] go about bald-headed that's death what's
[1:14:16] it doing for me about the last 20 years
[1:14:20] that's doing it but wait till I get to
[1:14:23] 80 if God lets me live I'll be standing
[1:14:27] like this and I'll maybe have an egg you
[1:14:30] shaking like that while I'm trying to
[1:14:32] hold on to my cane right that is human
[1:14:35] life then when I rise in the
[1:14:39] resurrection I'll be what I used to be
[1:14:43] what I was what God made me to be here
[1:14:46] I'll be at my very best inner body not a
[1:14:51] body I'm talking about that God used
[1:14:54] that made by Mr and Mrs Branham but a
[1:14:59] body that God created himself somebody
[1:15:02] praise God some God will give glory to
[1:15:06] God
[1:15:08] amen and that body that he created free
[1:15:12] from Temptations free from sin a body
[1:15:16] free from anything else never to have
[1:15:19] sickness or heartache oh my oh praise
[1:15:24] God then I'll take a hold of my wife's
[1:15:28] hands and walk down through Paradise
[1:15:30] together some of us dream of walking
[1:15:33] through Paradise down here but you know
[1:15:35] you have to wait sometimes to walk
[1:15:37] through that paradise up there amen
[1:15:40] you'll do the same thing oh my praise
[1:15:43] God hallelujah oh my listen let me tell
[1:15:47] you let me be in other words brother
[1:15:49] bran is going to be frank he said I'm
[1:15:51] not talking about leading around that
[1:15:53] old gray-headed woman you're leading
[1:15:55] around tonight and maybe calling your
[1:15:58] wife but she'll be just as beautiful as
[1:16:01] she was the day you married her at the
[1:16:05] altar Hallelujah that's enough to make a
[1:16:08] fellow shout and that's what I'm talking
[1:16:11] about that's what we're going back to
[1:16:13] you I said that's what you're going back
[1:16:15] to
[1:16:16] is that right we got to serve our time
[1:16:19] here on Earth
[1:16:21] and all these things we go through
[1:16:23] Amen in other quotes that Prophet
[1:16:26] mentioned which I can't give you
[1:16:28] everything here but he says the trails
[1:16:31] the toils you go through it says it's
[1:16:33] like a picture going through the dark
[1:16:36] room he said that's only to develop you
[1:16:39] that is only to cause you to grow that's
[1:16:42] only to cause you to come back to the
[1:16:44] perfect clear image of what you was amen
[1:16:49] praise God them things only come to
[1:16:52] shape you and form your praise the name
[1:16:54] of the Lord oh blessed be the name of
[1:16:57] the Living God hallelujah amen now you
[1:17:01] see that's the connection
[1:17:04] God is determined and when God makes up
[1:17:08] his mind to do anything nothing can stop
[1:17:11] him
[1:17:12] Satan spoiled his picture
[1:17:15] see he spoiled it by placing sexual
[1:17:19] desire into the picture
[1:17:22] by the woman to bring forth children and
[1:17:27] he spoiled it so go ahead make it that's
[1:17:30] all right nothing is wrong amen but you
[1:17:34] find out
[1:17:35] see that you'll do this life is to pick
[1:17:39] up your form an image of what you are if
[1:17:43] you are redheaded now you will be
[1:17:46] redheaded then
[1:17:47] if you're blackheaded now you will be
[1:17:50] black-headed then see what was your best
[1:17:54] Satan interrupted that picture and you
[1:17:58] didn't even get to that God intend you
[1:18:01] to be but on that day you'll be that oh
[1:18:06] how glorious that's the way it is amen
[1:18:10] praise God and this is where he mentions
[1:18:13] again about Michelangelo and how carving
[1:18:17] the statue of Moses uh and and then it
[1:18:20] got so perfect that he took a hammer and
[1:18:24] struck it
[1:18:25] amen well Hebrews 1.
[1:18:30] Paul speaking
[1:18:32] Jesus Christ higher than Angels higher
[1:18:37] than priesthood than the priesthood
[1:18:39] higher than every other order that there
[1:18:41] was before for he is the expressed image
[1:18:47] perfect
[1:18:48] Express image of God
[1:18:51] amen so Jesus was how God the invisible
[1:18:57] God the invisible God could make himself
[1:19:00] visible so he can be seen and known by
[1:19:06] his creation
[1:19:07] glory to God hallelujah oh my and just
[1:19:12] like Michelangelo was so inspired when
[1:19:16] he saw that statue of Moses it was so
[1:19:19] perfect you know he wanted it to speak
[1:19:23] and he took a hammer and he struck it
[1:19:25] and said speak of course the idol
[1:19:28] couldn't speak
[1:19:30] but God was foreshadowing
[1:19:33] Isaiah 53
[1:19:36] how he says that he was wounded for our
[1:19:39] transgressions bruised for art with
[1:19:42] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:19:45] was upon him and by his stripes we are
[1:19:48] healed for Jehovah struck him
[1:19:52] Hallelujah Jehovah struck him and he
[1:19:55] allowed him to put him on Calvary and
[1:19:58] this struck him amen praise God but that
[1:20:02] was just so their life could come out in
[1:20:05] the world in the form of the Holy Spirit
[1:20:07] and be available to every one of us here
[1:20:11] today
[1:20:12] for in him was all of the fullness of
[1:20:17] the godhead bodily
[1:20:19] so nobody could be filled with the Holy
[1:20:22] Ghost
[1:20:23] before he was crucified because all of
[1:20:27] it was in him but from moment he gave
[1:20:30] his life the life came out the Bible
[1:20:33] says the Holy Ghost came out of him he
[1:20:37] gave up the what the ghost
[1:20:40] the spirit he gave that up and it came
[1:20:43] forth and he says go wait and Jerusalem
[1:20:46] for the promise of my father my father
[1:20:51] who is the promise is going to come to
[1:20:52] you amen
[1:20:57] promised
[1:21:02] amen
[1:21:04] I'm so glad
[1:21:07] for that promise of the father
[1:21:11] hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:21:15] see God in Statue of a perfect man he
[1:21:21] says what I'm talking about not some
[1:21:24] Dead image on a wall
[1:21:26] and you bow down before that you wash a
[1:21:28] pic some Idol some piece of rock or some
[1:21:32] piece of wood but he said living images
[1:21:35] of a living God
[1:21:37] is that right
[1:21:39] he says think of it not man walking with
[1:21:43] a robe on and bells ringing on the
[1:21:47] bottom of that robes there amen but
[1:21:51] living beings
[1:21:53] who are these living images living
[1:21:56] beings with the Life of Christ in them
[1:22:01] and the gospel bells ringing off of
[1:22:04] their soul crying out holy holy holy
[1:22:09] holy holy Holiness unto the Lord that's
[1:22:13] what we're talking about here this
[1:22:15] morning that we are here as living
[1:22:17] representation of this unseen being whom
[1:22:21] we never seen with our eyes but he has
[1:22:23] allowed us to be created and be here as
[1:22:26] living images of a living God not to be
[1:22:29] idols on a wall but to be men and women
[1:22:32] that can be living in this character
[1:22:34] living with his nature and walking on
[1:22:37] the face of the Earth so that the world
[1:22:39] can have an idea of who he is
[1:22:43] praise the name of the Lord O praise God
[1:22:46] hallelujah oh my puts me in mind of the
[1:22:50] church no matter how much you substitute
[1:22:52] no matter how big a congregation you can
[1:22:55] get no matter how well you can have them
[1:22:58] sing your songs no matter how you good
[1:23:01] you can have them dress oh and you can
[1:23:04] say you got this we got that we got the
[1:23:06] other you could strike feel whatever it
[1:23:09] will never take the place of the Life of
[1:23:12] Christ in an individual come down in the
[1:23:17] form of the Holy Ghost into the church
[1:23:20] itself and gives it a new experience of
[1:23:24] them being born again
[1:23:27] it will never take the place of God's
[1:23:30] word for God's words stands alone
[1:23:34] and when the word is in you it stands
[1:23:37] alone
[1:23:38] you don't necessarily have to go around
[1:23:40] and talk this and tell that and try to
[1:23:42] convince this and convince us you are
[1:23:45] who you are
[1:23:46] [Applause]
[1:23:48] truth
[1:23:52] is stated truth
[1:23:54] in other words no matter what you say
[1:23:56] about the truth the truth doesn't change
[1:23:58] the truth just stands there and you have
[1:24:01] to deal with it it doesn't have to fight
[1:24:03] it doesn't have to do anything it's the
[1:24:05] truth and it just stands there and when
[1:24:07] you are a True Believer you don't have
[1:24:09] to fight you don't have to fuss you
[1:24:11] don't have to nothing you stand right
[1:24:13] there with the word of God and the power
[1:24:17] of the Holy Spirit pouring out of your
[1:24:19] life glory to God hallelujah Blessed Be

[1:24:42] you've come here to worship God and to
[1:24:46] surrender your life to him you could not
[1:24:49] have raised up out of your seat unless
[1:24:51] he called you no man can come unto me
[1:24:54] unless my father draws him Hallelujah
[1:24:59] has the father drawn you
[1:25:01] has the father drawn you

[1:25:28] the great glory land Yonder do you
[1:25:31] believe that
[1:25:33] where the all will be young there
[1:25:36] forever sickness and sorrow will vanish
[1:25:39] away in his presence and we will be back
[1:25:43] like we were in his likeness
[1:25:47] Hallelujah you're in the likeness of
[1:25:49] your mother and your father another
[1:25:51] place he says we are in the likeness of
[1:25:53] of animals right he says you gotta hand
[1:25:57] like a monkey you got feet like a bear
[1:25:59] you got death and he was making those
[1:26:01] comparisons saying we are from the
[1:26:03] Animal Kingdom in your natural uh form
[1:26:07] certain pervert the whole thing when we
[1:26:10] should have remained in his likeness
[1:26:12] Satan perverted and there came Cain and
[1:26:16] Abel so it went from creation to
[1:26:19] procreation
[1:26:21] and then we start coming forward he says
[1:26:24] in the image of Mr uh and Mrs uh Branham
[1:26:29] or whoever your parents were we come out
[1:26:32] in that image he says but that's not
[1:26:34] your real image that one is going to be
[1:26:37] broken up and you're going back to the
[1:26:39] original image that God gave you and you
[1:26:42] you buy from therefore the foundations
[1:26:45] of the world
[1:26:46] [Music]
[1:26:47] Hallelujah because when you are in his
[1:26:50] likeness when you are confirmed amen
[1:26:54] into his image
[1:26:56] then you see that one never goes old
[1:27:01] never goes gray just young and Youthful
[1:27:06] forever o praise God are you listening
[1:27:10] to the Holy Spirit
[1:27:11] that brought you
[1:27:13] Amen to the Earth
[1:27:16] and give you a choice
[1:27:19] to make a choice the chance to make a
[1:27:22] choice here
[1:27:23] you come and make that choice what
[1:27:28] choice are you making here today will
[1:27:31] you serve him
[1:27:32] will you serve him will you love him
[1:27:35] will you walk with him oh every step of
[1:27:39] the way may his great Holy Spirit call
[1:27:42] out to his children amen not my calling
[1:27:46] out but the Holy Spirit himself taken
[1:27:49] the words that I'm speaking and calling
[1:27:52] out to your heart and letting you know
[1:27:54] you're one of his own your mind your
[1:27:57] mind you don't belong to the world you
[1:28:00] don't belong to that denomination over
[1:28:01] there you don't belong to some certain
[1:28:04] belief or concept You Belong To Me the
[1:28:07] word amen God calling out by his Spirit
[1:28:10] calling to his own praise God back to
[1:28:14] the word
[1:28:15] back to the original position you are in
[1:28:18] that part of the word you are of Amen
[1:28:21] yes sir hallelujah amen I want you to
[1:28:26] come and believe him and believe his
[1:28:29] word amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:28:32] glory to God then some say if you pack
[1:28:35] an image of Christ in your car
[1:28:39] if you pack an image of Christ or a
[1:28:41] picture of Christ on the wall
[1:28:44] you're that's the sign of that person is
[1:28:47] really a Christian
[1:28:49] this is brother Brandon here
[1:28:51] right we arrive at this now but he was
[1:28:55] saying it back then right he says
[1:28:57] picture on the wall and all these things
[1:29:00] it's nice then things are all right you
[1:29:03] see you see nothing's wrong with that
[1:29:06] but I don't believe packing an image
[1:29:10] makes you a Christian
[1:29:12] I believe that being and living being
[1:29:16] the image of Christ makes you a question
[1:29:20] Hallelujah you have the culture of
[1:29:23] Christ in you the life the nature of
[1:29:27] Jesus Christ in you that's what makes
[1:29:29] you a Christian not just saying I'm a
[1:29:32] Christian and that makes you a Christian
[1:29:34] amen not just talking it or or going to
[1:29:38] church being religious makes you a
[1:29:40] Christian but literally my friends
[1:29:42] having the nature of Christ forming
[1:29:45] through you it's not what we do
[1:29:48] therefore outwardly
[1:29:51] it's what's happened to you inwardly
[1:29:55] that makes you what you are and who you
[1:29:59] are therefore if he is our image we are
[1:30:03] then to be in his likeness
[1:30:07] is that right I feel like singing now
[1:30:09] praise the Lord let's sing to be like
[1:30:12] Jesus you caught that praise the Lord
[1:30:15] hallelujah let's sing it together Amen
[1:30:18] to be like Jesus put up the words
[1:30:24] to be
[1:30:27] Jesus on Earth
[1:30:30] on Earth I long to be like him
[1:30:36] like him
[1:30:39] all true life's journey all true life
[1:30:45] from Earth to Glory from Earth to Glory
[1:30:51] oh I only ask Lord hallelujah
[1:30:57] to me
[1:31:00] like him from bethlehem's Manger
[1:31:08] came forth
[1:31:10] they had never seen a life like that
[1:31:13] on Earth I long to be like him
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:21] my faithful Savior My faithful say
[1:31:28] how rich his favor
[1:31:30] his Mercy
[1:31:34] on Earth I long
[1:31:41] [Music]
[1:31:45] what have you seen of Jesus Christ
[1:31:49] so that when you live you are projecting
[1:31:52] a life that you already seen whether by
[1:31:56] in prayer whether when you're in just
[1:31:58] House of God what does God reveal to you
[1:32:01] so that you can go out and live or
[1:32:05] project that life that God has given to
[1:32:08] you so you can become a living image of
[1:32:13] the Living God
[1:32:15] and that is what God wants every one of
[1:32:18] us to be not the idol on the wall the
[1:32:22] prophet said but to be the living image
[1:32:25] of him amen now this you can go there's
[1:32:29] lots of scriptures be transformed it
[1:32:31] tells you it tells you about changing
[1:32:33] from one image from Glory unto Glory
[1:32:36] you're changing into his image and
[1:32:38] becoming perfected in that image until
[1:32:41] you step right into the glory of God
[1:32:44] hallelujah into the fullness of him many
[1:32:47] of the scriptures Colossians Ephesians
[1:32:49] over there in even Revelation praise God
[1:32:53] hallelujah amen oh my I may have to just
[1:32:57] jump to show you that uh right there is
[1:33:01] why he's talking about the last days
[1:33:04] how that we find that the church will
[1:33:09] never Bow Down
[1:33:11] to the image
[1:33:14] of the Beast
[1:33:16] and every time he talks about that he
[1:33:19] goes back and refers to Danielle
[1:33:22] and he talks about Nebuchadnezzar right
[1:33:27] Hallelujah see Nebuchadnezzar simply
[1:33:30] like being a type of the devil
[1:33:32] and what did he do
[1:33:34] this is how we seduced uh them and I
[1:33:37] have the quotation here where he talks
[1:33:39] about you see what Nebuchadnezzar did to
[1:33:43] be able to deceive and trap the people
[1:33:46] was to make an image with the form
[1:33:52] of a Godly
[1:33:55] sacred Godly Man
[1:33:58] that they all recognize
[1:34:00] and he made it plain he says that man
[1:34:03] was Danielle
[1:34:05] he made an image of the prophet of that
[1:34:08] day now I'm seeing if only this morning
[1:34:11] what I'm studying I see what he really
[1:34:13] was telling is going to come
[1:34:16] so we can almost prophesy
[1:34:19] like they did with Daniel
[1:34:22] the pope already recognized brother
[1:34:24] Branham you know do you know that the
[1:34:26] popes put in the Catholic Digest when
[1:34:29] that man was alive the very grung the
[1:34:31] walk-on was blessed
[1:34:33] they may not I'll come and say we agree
[1:34:35] with this he said that we agree with
[1:34:37] that you agree well one thing they know
[1:34:39] there was never a life since Jesus
[1:34:41] Christ on this Earth other than when
[1:34:43] that man came and said thus saith the
[1:34:46] Lord
[1:34:48] amen hallelujah so what actually is
[1:34:53] prophecy is that it's gonna it's
[1:34:55] swinging around
[1:34:57] and it's coming right back
[1:34:59] until they're going to say yes this man
[1:35:02] William Branham 20th century Prophet
[1:35:05] what he said was true
[1:35:08] and he always keep repeating that he
[1:35:10] said they always recognize prophets and
[1:35:13] sacred people after they killed them and
[1:35:16] after they're dead
[1:35:17] then they recognized that they were
[1:35:19] being told the truth but they already
[1:35:21] gone he said and then they want to dig
[1:35:23] them up or make statues of them but what
[1:35:26] I'm telling you to watch this could it
[1:35:29] be
[1:35:30] he was talking about himself that the
[1:35:33] time will come that this this serpent
[1:35:37] spirit that was not completely destroyed
[1:35:39] will come and get to get them to form an
[1:35:44] image of him
[1:35:48] and raise it like that to capture all
[1:35:50] the Protestant world
[1:35:52] right
[1:35:53] and even
[1:35:55] unsuspecting so-called message believers
[1:35:59] to being in worshiping that and placing
[1:36:02] their thoughts in that direction
[1:36:04] but you know Daniel and the four boys
[1:36:07] who had of course a clear Revelation
[1:36:10] amen the Bible said there was not bow
[1:36:14] down and worshiped the golden idol they
[1:36:17] wouldn't bow and they would bow to not
[1:36:20] know such a thing amen praise God
[1:36:22] forevermore brother sister he says
[1:36:25] clearly bow down to no holy man or no
[1:36:28] holy Idol or no holy place or no holy
[1:36:32] cave or no holy Shrine or no holy altar
[1:36:36] don't bow down to them nor serve them
[1:36:39] for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God
[1:36:44] Hallelujah he says I Stand Alone
[1:36:48] none before me none beside me none after
[1:36:52] me Hallelujah no wonder we have the
[1:36:56] quotation from the scriptures Hebrews 38

[1:37:15] it

[1:37:22] hallelujah then
[1:37:25] if he we are in his likeness members of
[1:37:28] his body we should be then living and
[1:37:32] living as images of him
[1:37:35] amen praise God we should then reflect
[1:37:39] the image of Christ
[1:37:42] amen not joinings church
[1:37:46] or walking around with some crucifix on
[1:37:49] you
[1:37:50] or using your emotions to do it it
[1:37:55] should be living that
[1:37:57] living presence of the Living God and

[1:38:04] the world that's what it is let the Life
[1:38:07] of Christ project through you amen
[1:38:09] hallelujah Christian means christ-like
[1:38:13] it means to reflect him
[1:38:15] amen now when I say that doesn't mean
[1:38:20] you have to grow a long beard
[1:38:23] as the artist in the pictures draw him
[1:38:26] with a beard and that
[1:38:29] neither does it mean we have to grow
[1:38:32] long hair to be like Jesus

[1:38:42] wearing some robes
[1:38:45] like he wore

[1:38:52] so we don't have to do that amen we
[1:38:57] don't necessarily have to be that you
[1:38:59] can do it if you want but you don't
[1:39:01] necessarily have to do that but we must
[1:39:04] reflect his image
[1:39:06] amen we must do it in our souls in our
[1:39:11] spirit his Spirit image his manner of
[1:39:15] life I do not believe that Christians
[1:39:18] consist of just joining Church joining
[1:39:21] Creeds repeating Creeds but I believe in
[1:39:25] a living reflection of a living Christ
[1:39:27] in the heart of that believer amen
[1:39:31] hallelujah and we are members of this
[1:39:33] body and we are to Bear His Image amen
[1:39:37] so to be a Christian then is to be
[1:39:41] conformed to the image of Christ to be
[1:39:45] living images not packing on images
[1:39:48] packing an image an image but you
[1:39:51] yourself to be a living image of a

[1:40:23] was trying to get the people to see
[1:40:25] and to understand what he was talking
[1:40:27] about he was the only one but thank God
[1:40:30] he has opened our eyes the eyes of our
[1:40:33] heart he's opened our minds that we can
[1:40:36] recognize him and walk with him praise
[1:40:40] the name of the Living God Amen I'm so
[1:40:43] conscious of the great Holy Spirit
[1:40:46] that I couldn't hide from him you

[1:41:36] little bit more
[1:41:37] you're just there at that place where I
[1:41:40] I can feel the amen but now we

[1:41:46] image of Jesus Christ the image of God
[1:41:49] Jesus Christ they expressed image of the
[1:41:52] invisible God and it says the word
[1:41:54] invisible so that you can understand the
[1:41:58] invisible whom you can't see
[1:42:00] not by Idol on the wall
[1:42:03] but you don't understand him by this
[1:42:06] Living Image being called Jesus Christ
[1:42:09] the life he lived and the virtues he
[1:42:12] expressed by that you'll be able to get
[1:42:15] a visual you'll also be able to get an
[1:42:18] emotional and you're able to get his way
[1:42:22] of life his nature his virtues and
[1:42:24] values right it'll be coming out through
[1:42:27] him in that way and that's how we are to
[1:42:30] be able to worship God but you shall not
[1:42:34] bow down to a man like yourself
[1:42:38] you shall not bow down to an idol
[1:42:42] amen you know an old uh an all-profit
[1:42:46] told me years ago he says one thing I'll
[1:42:50] tell you
[1:42:52] what he told me
[1:42:54] he's telling me what God told him and
[1:42:56] he's now telling me
[1:42:59] on your knees before God
[1:43:02] but on your feet before other men like
[1:43:05] yourself
[1:43:06] you shall not bow down to them nor serve
[1:43:10] them
[1:43:11] amen you shall do it amen but you
[1:43:15] realize that we we all wear the same
[1:43:18] clothing whether it's a pants or a dress
[1:43:20] we're human beings and we're all the
[1:43:23] same praise God it's the holy spirit in
[1:43:26] our lives that makes the difference amen
[1:43:28] you may have a bigger position you may
[1:43:31] have uh human authority but none has a
[1:43:34] real authority over sons and US of God
[1:43:37] that doesn't mean that you should go on
[1:43:39] your job arrogant
[1:43:42] you should be the most humble
[1:43:45] you should be the most uh willing and
[1:43:48] your most willing to carry out your
[1:43:50] responsibilities and live the way that
[1:43:52] Jesus lived is that right Pro praise God
[1:43:56] forevermore amen but we're living a age
[1:43:59] where uh here like the eagle that was
[1:44:04] found in the in the zoo they take Eagles
[1:44:06] and put them in a zoo now they take
[1:44:09] spiritual Eagles and put them in a
[1:44:11] church denomination a stained glass
[1:44:14] windows but they can't get out they're
[1:44:17] trapped in there with some false made
[1:44:20] membership it's not membership to some
[1:44:24] church on Earth is membership to Christ
[1:44:27] and that membership to Christ can only
[1:44:30] come repent and be baptized in the name
[1:44:33] of Jesus Christ and you shall receive
[1:44:35] the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto
[1:44:38] you amen unto your children as many
[1:44:41] other are far off that is what it is my
[1:44:44] brothers and sisters amen amen so people
[1:44:48] are today trapped into the nominational
[1:44:51] uh partitions amen I'm mixing scripture
[1:44:55] with a little bit of digital
[1:44:56] understanding the devil partition of
[1:44:59] people's minds
[1:45:01] oh I'm a Catholic Oh I'm a Baptist oh
[1:45:04] I'm a matter of assignment of this you'd
[1:45:06] better be a child of Christ
[1:45:09] because if it's not it doesn't matter
[1:45:10] what brand you put on yourself
[1:45:13] is that right yeah you're going to go
[1:45:15] and see our loves call who have brands
[1:45:17] on them brand brand this one said this
[1:45:19] one is mine you know because it's
[1:45:21] branded with this Church's name This one
[1:45:24] belongs to me and there's another brand
[1:45:25] over there all kinds of Brands like that
[1:45:29] but the point is there is one man that
[1:45:32] owned all the ranches with all them
[1:45:35] brands on them and all them cows and a
[1:45:38] cattle and a thousand Health belong to
[1:45:41] him and when the big boss calls you got
[1:45:44] to bring all them cattle into him that
[1:45:47] are his and thank God the boss's son has
[1:45:51] come back with the word and calling in
[1:45:54] his chips amen he's calling his daughter
[1:45:57] his child home calling his bride home
[1:46:00] his people home praise the name of the
[1:46:02] Lord amen I know I'm speaking a little
[1:46:04] mixed up here but because so many
[1:46:07] thoughts that things are passing at the
[1:46:09] same time he said now think of it the
[1:46:12] son other sites you could have that here
[1:46:16] a man who was made to be the image of
[1:46:19] God to be a Heavenly bird amen you
[1:46:23] believe God made you to be a Heavenly
[1:46:24] bird a Heavenly child an ego to fly over
[1:46:29] the circumstances of this world to fly
[1:46:32] over all the troubles trials and storms
[1:46:34] of life you know we're not pilot years
[1:46:37] ago was telling the story how that he
[1:46:40] was so shocked when he was in a plane
[1:46:42] and and and and when he looked there was
[1:46:45] an eagle
[1:46:47] oh my goodness they they have to go
[1:46:50] through so much technology and spend
[1:46:51] millions of dollars before they can get
[1:46:54] a plane to fly up there and here was the
[1:46:57] eagle just going along
[1:46:59] he says and while he's looking at the
[1:47:01] ego all of a sudden he saw the eagle
[1:47:03] turn his head suddenly and looked that
[1:47:06] way he says my and then he looked ahead
[1:47:10] and he didn't know why did he look that
[1:47:12] way and my when he looked at his radar
[1:47:16] that eagle had already picked up that
[1:47:19] the storm was up ahead
[1:47:22] and he just picked it up afterwards on
[1:47:25] his radar and then he said well he's
[1:47:28] going to turn back now no that eagle
[1:47:31] just set his wings and just zoom right
[1:47:34] into the middle of the storm right into
[1:47:37] the eye of it and come out the other
[1:47:39] side that's the way the believer ought
[1:47:41] to be
[1:47:42] don't run from your troubles don't run
[1:47:45] from your fears don't run from your
[1:47:47] trials walk right into it and God will
[1:47:51] take you through and you're right out
[1:47:53] the other side to the eye of the storm
[1:47:55] oh praise God hallelujah I thank God
[1:48:00] that my brother sister that we are a
[1:48:02] different people
[1:48:04] amen and be brought here by God Amen
[1:48:08] think of it by the devil's trickery and
[1:48:11] the devices of evil men
[1:48:14] and women caged up
[1:48:17] think of it their Heavenly Birds
[1:48:21] and those people know nothing about the
[1:48:24] ground
[1:48:25] they are to live in the heavens looking
[1:48:28] around them what a sad sight when God
[1:48:32] created them in his his image
[1:48:35] and then they take them and cage them
[1:48:39] into denominations
[1:48:41] and various ways of believing
[1:48:46] caged into places
[1:48:48] where they can't be free but thank God
[1:48:51] God these heaven-sent ones the spirit of
[1:48:56] God is in them oh thank God I believe
[1:48:59] the spirit of God is in me amen
[1:49:02] hallelujah or they can't get out when
[1:49:05] you look on the streets that is what you
[1:49:08] see men and women all immorally dressed
[1:49:12] in the streets caged up
[1:49:14] whoa some in the saloons caged up beat
[1:49:19] their brains out trying to find answers
[1:49:21] to their problems oh my trying to get
[1:49:25] free oh praise God hallelujah oh praise
[1:49:29] God that's what it is but I tell you
[1:49:32] they take them sons and of God and those
[1:49:35] of God put them in a cage wherever they
[1:49:37] are but their Spirit wants to get out of
[1:49:40] there amen whatever situations you are
[1:49:44] in anyone is in anyone that will hear my
[1:49:47] voice wherever you are don't remain in
[1:49:50] your cage let the Holy Spirit
[1:49:53] break you out of there take you out and
[1:49:56] set you free for the glory of God all he
[1:49:58] asks is you confess
[1:50:01] repent
[1:50:02] and find a manner God will baptize you
[1:50:05] in the proper name of baptism the name
[1:50:09] is Jesus Christ Father Son and Holy
[1:50:12] Ghost are but titles of the one person
[1:50:15] but Jesus Christ
[1:50:18] is the name that you must take on
[1:50:22] hallelujah amen think of that old crow
[1:50:27] same thing they had him caged
[1:50:30] tied up so long in that church
[1:50:33] membership that he can't decide to leave
[1:50:36] his church when he hears the truth and
[1:50:39] comes to the truth for them other words
[1:50:41] went by him and said Johnny Crow come on
[1:50:44] it's time to go south tribulation coming
[1:50:46] winter coming
[1:50:49] let's go south amen oh my but he was so
[1:50:54] poorly see he couldn't hardly walk amen
[1:50:59] oh my but then my friends he was tied
[1:51:03] there he made efforts to come up but he
[1:51:06] couldn't see but our faith our faith
[1:51:10] will sometimes be put to a test right to
[1:51:14] the crucial hour oh my just like Daniel
[1:51:17] and them boys
[1:51:18] he won he'll put you into a fiery
[1:51:20] furnace
[1:51:21] but Satan couldn't destroy them that he
[1:51:25] can't destroy you
[1:51:27] for God's purpose in him wasn't
[1:51:30] fulfilled
[1:51:31] and God's purpose in you if it hasn't
[1:51:34] been fulfilled he can't destroy you
[1:51:37] amen oh my they could go in there with
[1:51:42] this Faith saying I know my redeemer
[1:51:45] liveth Hallelujah they could go in there
[1:51:49] with that we are assured our God is able
[1:51:52] to Deliver Us from this fiery furnace
[1:51:55] amen but nevertheless even if he does
[1:51:58] not we will not bow down to this image
[1:52:02] amen back there that image now you got
[1:52:06] to face the image that the a physical
[1:52:08] image that someday I believe of brother
[1:52:12] Branham that they will erect
[1:52:16] and try to capture the religious world
[1:52:19] to Bow Down and Worship Him
[1:52:23] to baptize in this name
[1:52:25] to pray in his name and everything in
[1:52:28] his name rather than in the name of
[1:52:30] Jesus Christ
[1:52:31] see but then the other image right now
[1:52:36] with your jobs with this I'm just
[1:52:38] passing over these things but with your
[1:52:40] jobs with this and that create a society
[1:52:43] uh us brother Aubrey priest many years
[1:52:46] ago the devil created Society where you
[1:52:50] got to go out and work you got to do
[1:52:52] this you got you're enslaved into doing
[1:52:54] that but praise God but God's fit
[1:52:58] civilization is coming
[1:53:00] amen God's faith civilization is coming
[1:53:03] praise the name of the Lord so then you
[1:53:07] must have faith that's that's that
[1:53:09] Civilization is coming so that you don't
[1:53:12] bow down to the image of the Beast
[1:53:17] because the image of the Beast is in
[1:53:19] formation right now
[1:53:21] and when he says he's telling us back
[1:53:24] there in Exodus 2 but you know that's
[1:53:27] prophecy speaking all the way down
[1:53:29] through time
[1:53:30] telling you don't bow down to no image
[1:53:32] whether it be Woodstone this that
[1:53:34] whether the main a social image or
[1:53:36] whatever don't bow down whether she
[1:53:39] don't bow down to no Idol right so the
[1:53:42] image of the Beast is forming
[1:53:44] and we are not about down to it
[1:53:48] even if they try to tell you you're
[1:53:50] going to go into a tribulation
[1:53:52] even if they try to tell you you're
[1:53:53] going to burn in a fiery furnace
[1:53:56] we will not bow down to him nor worship
[1:53:59] Him
[1:54:01] we will not do it right now he's in
[1:54:03] spirit just like God is in spirit see
[1:54:05] but he's because another place he said
[1:54:07] don't you realize that even God is a
[1:54:09] spirit you can't see him and the devil
[1:54:12] is not a thought even though he tries to
[1:54:14] get people to think he's just an evil
[1:54:16] thought he said the devil is just as
[1:54:19] much of a person as God is a person
[1:54:22] only that God is the Eternal one and the
[1:54:26] Devil is a creation and the devil is
[1:54:29] going to be cast into the lake of fire
[1:54:31] with all his lying angels
[1:54:34] that's where he will be in the Years up
[1:54:38] a come praise the name of the Lord oh I
[1:54:40] praise God and give him glory for what
[1:54:43] he has done for me I honor him Magnify
[1:54:47] Him you realize now I realize that I'm
[1:54:50] at the limit but I am pushing the
[1:54:52] envelope
[1:54:54] because I just want to finish this here
[1:54:58] quickly I just got a few more pages is
[1:55:00] that all right
[1:55:02] I'm just letting you know ahead of time
[1:55:05] so that you don't get up and walk out on
[1:55:07] me
[1:55:09] right but that you stay with the word
[1:55:12] hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:55:15] why does God let troubles come
[1:55:21] have you ever asked yourself that
[1:55:23] I'm living so good for God at least
[1:55:27] that's what you think
[1:55:28] but when he looks at your life he he can
[1:55:31] see that you think you're perfect but
[1:55:33] you're a limited human understanding you
[1:55:35] think you are living perfect right but
[1:55:38] anyway
[1:55:40] he said why does God let troubles come
[1:55:44] you see God harnesses trouble
[1:55:49] he puts a bit in the mouth of your
[1:55:53] troubles
[1:55:54] and makes them obey him
[1:55:58] those troubles must obey him
[1:56:02] and he uses them to bring us into a
[1:56:06] closer fellowship with him
[1:56:09] you see the reason and purpose of some
[1:56:12] troubles and trials is to bring us
[1:56:14] because what's the first thing you do
[1:56:17] when you stump your toe oh God
[1:56:22] what is the first thing you do when dire
[1:56:25] troubles command you you look to the
[1:56:27] right you look to the left you look
[1:56:28] around nobody is there to help you
[1:56:32] you said you wouldn't believe in God but
[1:56:35] at that moment if there is a God
[1:56:37] somewhere oh God right away you start
[1:56:40] talking about God see God lets troubles
[1:56:44] come
[1:56:46] and he harnesses it and uses it
[1:56:49] to bring us closer to him that we could
[1:56:53] have fellowship with him and talk with
[1:56:56] him amen or think of it you see that's
[1:57:00] the way praise God don't you realize
[1:57:04] that before there could be any rainbow
[1:57:07] God had to allow the flood to come
[1:57:12] is that right
[1:57:13] years ago I preached a message you need
[1:57:16] a flood
[1:57:17] right the flood that will wash away all
[1:57:20] the the you know all the dead bodies and
[1:57:22] all the stuff hidden up in your closet
[1:57:25] and so on wash it out praise God before
[1:57:27] you can see the rainbow Praise of
[1:57:30] promise but God has to allow troubles to
[1:57:32] come
[1:57:33] he has to allow uh floods to come amen
[1:57:38] and uh you put it this way when it rains
[1:57:42] it pours
[1:57:43] it's the same thing see God allows
[1:57:45] floods to come so that he can take the
[1:57:48] flood and make a rainbow out of it right
[1:57:52] and that rainbow within your life praise
[1:57:56] God hallelujah must I be carried away to
[1:58:00] home on a flowery bed of ease While
[1:58:03] others fought to win the prize and sail
[1:58:06] through bloody seas oh no we ask for
[1:58:10] comfort and peace God gives us the best
[1:58:13] he could give us and that is trials and
[1:58:17] tribulations
[1:58:19] to be formed into his image
[1:58:22] just think about it I'm going to stop
[1:58:24] here even though there's much more that
[1:58:27] I can say here but I'm gonna stop at
[1:58:30] this point and
[1:58:32] um
[1:58:33] just
[1:58:34] repeat some of what I said here quickly
[1:58:38] Jesus the express image of God
[1:58:42] an image is not an idol on a wall
[1:58:46] because we were made in this image
[1:58:49] and it wasn't the physical body that was
[1:58:51] made it was his Spirit image we were
[1:58:55] made in the spirit image of God
[1:58:58] Satan uh derailed that plan
[1:59:01] and change creation to procreation
[1:59:05] amen and he just kept a a
[1:59:10] resemblance of what he think
[1:59:13] uh the image of God would be so we come
[1:59:17] in the image of Mom and Dad but not this
[1:59:20] is not in the image of God right the
[1:59:23] image of God is inside of the Inner Man
[1:59:27] your soul on the inside praise God
[1:59:30] before the went and told you that the
[1:59:35] um Jesus Christ was expressed image of
[1:59:38] God is that right no I didn't say this
[1:59:41] before but the woman is a reflection of
[1:59:45] the man amen and even so the church
[1:59:49] walks in the image of Christ to reflect
[1:59:53] Christ to the age in which we are living
[1:59:55] in perilous times chaotic times that
[1:59:59] we're living in but in the midst of us
[2:00:01] all she's here shining his light
[2:00:04] amen he is the Son and she is the moon
[2:00:08] and the moon reflects the light of the
[2:00:11] sun after that the sun has gone down
[2:00:14] that same God wants to reflect his life
[2:00:18] through you and me for his glory and for
[2:00:20] his honor we have no light of our own
[2:00:23] because man woman born and sin shaped
[2:00:27] and iniquity come to the world speaking
[2:00:28] Lies We have nothing in ourselves we
[2:00:31] don't have any Holiness of our own
[2:00:33] doesn't matter how we try to make
[2:00:35] ourselves look holy appear holy oh my we
[2:00:39] have no Holiness within ourselves oh
[2:00:42] blessed be the name of the lord it's his
[2:00:44] Holiness when he comes to us
[2:00:48] he and US makes us holy he walks in us
[2:00:52] and talks with us and we give Glory To
[2:00:55] His Marvelous name furthermore
[2:00:58] the church
[2:00:59] coming in His image gives glory to God
[2:01:03] but he's telling you the devil already
[2:01:06] got a a counterfeit of that because you
[2:01:10] have the image of the Beast
[2:01:12] made up of the Confederation of churches
[2:01:14] World consulate churches and all those
[2:01:16] groups come together trying to form a
[2:01:19] religious body
[2:01:21] not the mystical body but forming a
[2:01:24] religious body and you to be aware of
[2:01:26] that that that's also an image and we
[2:01:30] are not about down to that nor servant
[2:01:33] because that's prophecy that's on the
[2:01:36] road right now because it's already
[2:01:39] started this formation right but it's
[2:01:42] not yet come to its fullness but thank
[2:01:44] God we have the promise
[2:01:46] the bride will be brought out of here
[2:01:49] amen before the tribulation I believe in
[2:01:53] a pre-tribulation rapture
[2:01:57] I don't believe in a post or tribulation
[2:01:59] after the tribulation then he's bring
[2:02:02] his wife out of the troubles after she's
[2:02:05] been beat up and bloodied and battered
[2:02:07] and bruised then he's going to bring her
[2:02:10] out no I believe that we will not go
[2:02:13] into the tribulation but God will bring
[2:02:17] his bride out in a rapture
[2:02:19] Hallelujah and take us out of here of
[2:02:23] course we will see no doubt they
[2:02:26] preamble to the tribulation but the
[2:02:29] world Fallen apart and the pressures
[2:02:30] increasing increasing increasing and
[2:02:33] then in my uh crude way of saying it
[2:02:35] we'll slip right out of out of uh the
[2:02:39] devil's hand like a banana
[2:02:41] slips right out
[2:02:43] into the presence of God
[2:02:47] do you believe that
[2:02:49] are you willing and ready to go
[2:02:51] I don't mean be committing now uh Jim
[2:02:55] Jones mass suicide
[2:02:57] that's not what I'm talking about I'm
[2:03:00] saying like Jesus said it that we must
[2:03:03] be ready
[2:03:04] so that when he calls we are able to
[2:03:07] answer
[2:03:08] are your lamps trimmed and burning are
[2:03:12] you living a life worthy of the Gospel
[2:03:16] living a life that you can shine your
[2:03:19] little teeny you may not think you are
[2:03:21] much but shine your little light in some
[2:03:24] corner and be a blessing to somebody
[2:03:27] somewhere oh praise God I'm happy that I
[2:03:31] can live that life
[2:03:33] I don't have to go around with a
[2:03:35] tactical Christianity musicians you can
[2:03:37] come up now
[2:03:40] but I can just be on be myself
[2:03:42] Hallelujah
[2:03:45] do you know you wake up in the morning
[2:03:46] and you're going along and you just say
[2:03:49] Hi how are you just your spirit coming
[2:03:51] out with the joy and the peace of God
[2:03:54] somebody else might be dumb and just the
[2:03:56] way
[2:03:57] you said that it'll lift their spirit
[2:04:01] Hallelujah
[2:04:03] your intention was not to preach or
[2:04:06] witness or push a track at somebody
[2:04:09] because you are the living book
[2:04:12] you become the living epistle you become
[2:04:16] the gospel amen as close as you live his
[2:04:20] life
[2:04:21] the best that you possibly can you're
[2:04:25] not going to be Mr Mrs Perfection you're
[2:04:28] going to make mistakes you're going to
[2:04:30] stumble here you're going to stumble
[2:04:31] there but he says if you sin you have an
[2:04:35] advocate
[2:04:36] you have a lawyer Jesus Christ the
[2:04:40] righteous and he says if you confess
[2:04:42] your fault right one to another and
[2:04:46] confess your fault stay here praise the
[2:04:48] Lord amen when I say one to another that
[2:04:51] don't mean go to a priest to confess
[2:04:54] that means he said if someone has ought
[2:04:58] against you or you have ought against
[2:04:59] them go confess to that person
[2:05:02] confess to that individual that's what
[2:05:05] what he means there when he's a confess
[2:05:06] your pulse one to another fervently that
[2:05:09] you may be healed amen so let's serve
[2:05:12] the Lord with sincerity in heart and in
[2:05:15] mind praise the Lord there'll be further
[2:05:17] announcements of other things and you'll

[2:06:15] and with that
[2:06:18] they expected that they will take her
[2:06:20] out to next day and should be buried
[2:06:24] but she tells it of herself she said all
[2:06:28] I know
[2:06:29] I woke up
[2:06:31] and a man in white has his hand
[2:06:35] upon my head

[2:06:40] started walking away but I was still in
[2:06:43] the Daze
[2:06:44] and so I said Doctor

[2:08:00] have a small wedding here at three
[2:08:03] o'clock
[2:08:04] a young couple
[2:08:06] approached me we're in a desperate
[2:08:09] situation
[2:08:10] where they were supposed to have their
[2:08:14] wedding at a certain Church
[2:08:17] and just maybe a day or so ago
[2:08:21] the minister got struck with covid
[2:08:25] there was no time for anything else they
[2:08:28] didn't know where to go and I believe it
[2:08:30] was sister hope suggested why don't you
[2:08:32] ask my pastor
[2:08:34] and so they came and asked and I said
[2:08:39] sure I will do it from their papers
[2:08:43] neither one was married so there was
[2:08:46] nothing to obstruct them or stop them
[2:08:49] and so we go and they just wanted three
[2:08:52] people because her mother has to go back
[2:08:55] to a foreign country and the deadline of
[2:08:57] the time would be passed so they just
[2:09:00] wanted if it's three of them could come
[2:09:02] in here and have their wedding
[2:09:05] well I'm just letting you know this is
[2:09:08] what's going to happen if you want to be
[2:09:12] there or you choose to be there you
[2:09:14] don't have to like I'm telling you but
