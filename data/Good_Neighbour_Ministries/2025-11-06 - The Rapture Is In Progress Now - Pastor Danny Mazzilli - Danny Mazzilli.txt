Hallelujah. You glad you can say that tonight? Amen. &gt;&gt; That you're one of his. [music] Amen. That's why you've come here tonight, right? &gt;&gt; Because you've identified yourself with the word of God. You've identified yourself with the message of this hour. Amen. [music] Praise God. That's what um you know excites our soul to know that uh we're just not another church. We're not just another gathering. We're we're uh we're we're that we're that little flock that uh unique speckled bird that um has so much zeal [music] and uh excitement about the word of God and a desire to hear God's [music] word and to know that he has something for us every single day. That this walk is not just a traditional walk. I'm a Christian. No, this is a walk. I am a son or daughter of God and I've come into contact with the living God. Amen. Praise God. It's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. And so tonight we're um it's Bible study and um did you uh upload the file, Abraham? Praise God. Amen. So tonight we're going to be looking at um the title is the rapture is in progress now. Amen. And it's a Bible study. So it's things that um you know scriptures and quotes that you know we've heard over and over again. But you know, the one thing about the Lord is that when he wants to make something, you know, real in in the day that we're living, he he uh he just anoints the word of God and all of a sudden you've read that scripture, you've heard that scripture. Um and and then all of a sudden it just becomes alive to you. Amen. Becomes a new scripture. Praise God. It's under the file. &gt;&gt; You got it. Okay. Good. Praise God. Amen. And so the word becomes alive. It becomes real. And so we want to look at that here tonight. Um let's uh let's pray before we go to the word. Amen. Father, we're so grateful. Lord, this is the hour of the rapture. Lord, it's the season for the body change. It's the season where this bride puts on the very image &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The very life takes control. And Lord, our words um are your words. &gt;&gt; Your thoughts are our thoughts. &gt;&gt; Everything becomes uh the purpose of God and the will of God when we've uh fully surrendered ourselves to your perfect will. Lord, may you take control now of this service. Bless our fellowship around your word, our time of study. Grant it Lord that you would break it make it simple Lord that that even the children can receive their portion. &gt;&gt; Grant it we pray in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So our scripture reading let's go to our first scripture. It's from Revelations chapter 8 verse 1. You got to keep clicking to bring up the slide. This is um this this kind of has like a progression. Amen. So it says here, "And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour." &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so I want to take this um this uh quote here from brother Brandham in 1963 from Christ, the mystery of God revealed. He says God's great mystery of how it's a secret. How he kept it a secret. &gt;&gt; Nobody knowed nothing about it. Even the angels didn't understand it. See, he didn't reveal it. That's the reason under our seventh mystery, when the seventh seal was opened, there was silence. Jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come. He said it's not even the son of man the son himself don't know when it's going to happen. See God has this all to himself. It's a secret. And that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of half an hour. and seven thunders uttered their voices. And John was even forbidden to write it. See, &gt;&gt; now notice this. The coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. Amen. Praise God. And so, um, you know, Brother Brandham made it very clear that the rapture, and we're talking about the rapture and how the rapture is in progress. Now, you've got to recognize that the message of this hour is changing you. It's translating you from this dimension to the sixth dimension. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a meeting in the air in between. And that is that is the next major event that we're looking forward to as the true church, the bride of Jesus Christ, those that have recognize the word for their day. Amen. And and here in the message, the rapture, brother Brandham says, "But but to the church, the bride, the rapture is a revelation to her." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's revealed to her. Amen. &gt;&gt; That the revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Now it is a revelation for the revelation is faith. We know that faith is a revelation. God has to reveal. That's why you know you hear about the rapture being talked in different churches and you know denominational churches and so forth. But the essence of revelation is what makes it real to the individual. &gt;&gt; Okay? Otherwise, it's just scripture. They can read second Thessalonians. They can read, you know, Corinthians where it talks about the the change. They can they can read all the scriptures. They can talk about it. But but have they entered into the actual moment and season of the word which will produce the rapture? &gt;&gt; Only the quickening power of God's word will actually translate you and change your mortal body from this dimension to the next dimension. So never underestimate the beauty and the power of your ability to receive revelation &gt;&gt; because the rapture is a revelation. Amen. Praise God. And so let's go to our next scripture. We're going to be looking at, you know, these are simple scriptures that we've looked at, but it's a Bible study. We want to see what the Lord is going to, you know, open to us and, you know, make the rapture more real to us. &gt;&gt; Bring it more clear to us. Bring it more in the moment. Uh, apply it in our lives and see how simple things that are going on from your day-to-day activities are actually uh, you know, dealing with your character, dealing with your your heart, dealing with your thoughts, and bringing you into that oneness with him because it's him and you. That's your hope of glory. &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you. The the the the quickening power. The scripture says, if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you, it's going to quicken. &gt;&gt; It's going to change you. It's going to translate you. &gt;&gt; And so from the scripture now, we read the first scripture that you know when when that seventh seal was open, there was silence in heaven. Then we read what it said there from Christ the mystery of God. The seventh seal was the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what the seventh seal produced in 1963 when the there was an earthly angel on the earth, the heavenly angel, the mighty angel himself who was the one that came with an open book in his hand now. Amen. Because he's the one that's coming to redeem and to and to claim his inheritance. Praise God. It it the mighty God himself, Christ himself, the Lord himself. Amen. Coming down to redeem and to catch away his bride. Amen. That was the start of the rapture. &gt;&gt; That was the scripture that this particular scripture that we're going to read right now pertains to this day, &gt;&gt; this hour, &gt;&gt; this time. Amen. Praise God. And so here it says in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18, "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first." &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so when we look at this scripture, it's clear here. The Lord himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. It's going to take the Lord himself to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. and quicken us. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to take the Lord himself to come and indwell in us. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's the only way you're going to see the change. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But notice here, uh, and we're going to look at the shout and the voice and the archangel and so forth and the trump of God. But, you know, verse 17, then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And you know, those that have received Christ already under the message of this hour and those that received it under Paul because remember the coming of the Lord, the first coming of the Lord was to come and pay the price. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. He had to pay the price for our redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. Once that price was paid, it was the Holy Ghost that he sent back down upon us. And that's the quickening spirit. &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, through those seven church ages, there were those that receive the Holy Ghost for their day. &gt;&gt; They died in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They went to the sixth dimension. &gt;&gt; They're already there. &gt;&gt; They're already young. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So, we're not going to hinder them. &gt;&gt; They've already gone on &gt;&gt; to their change. They've already They've already received their change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they've gone from from this dimension by the Holy Ghost to the redeemed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's we here that finish and fulfill the fullness of the whole plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. where Christ himself now comes to to actually because remember his original plan was for him to be God in man on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where he and man would become one. And that is God himself joining back together with the body which is the church which is Eve. Amen. Praise God. But this Eve, she's going to she's not going to be deceived. &gt;&gt; She's going to be the one that's going to receive the word, the quickening power to actually produce the rapture. Amen. Because we know that once the rapture is produced, this world goes into complete and total utter &gt;&gt; tribulation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. As long as we're here, &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. This earth is being held back from going into fullblown tribulation. &gt;&gt; It's going to get messy. The next stage is where God is going to where Christ is going to come and reveal himself to the 144,000. &gt;&gt; But we go to the marriage supper. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So, we're going to be caught up together with them. Amen. They've already entered into that other dimension. So, we're not going to prevent them. &gt;&gt; We're not hindering them. They're just waiting on us so that we can have our great meeting in the air with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because they're waiting on the Lord, too. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the Lord is here right now. &gt;&gt; He's not there. He's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's here connecting and becoming one with his bride. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And so let's go to um so so what we're going to be looking at here is you know the three comeings. We're looking at this rapture. We're looking at the understanding there's there's the comingings the the the the comingings of the Lord Jesus. There's three. And brother Brandham says it here. You can go to the next slide from the message be certain of God in 1959. He says the coming of Jesus is three times. Did you know that Jesus come the first time to redeem his bride? &gt;&gt; Amen. To pay the price. He comes the next time. We're caught up in the air to meet him in the air. Amen. We caught up to meet him. He comes to receive his bride. And then the next time, the third time, he comes. He comes as king and queen to reign on earth with his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we know now that we're in that second stage, &gt;&gt; which is the second coming, &gt;&gt; which is now in progress, &gt;&gt; which is the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what his second coming was all about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The rapture of uniting himself with the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. So here now, let's go to the next slide. Three things happen. Okay. From the scripture that we read, a shout, a voice, a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears. &gt;&gt; Now, a shout. Amen. Praise God. What's the shout? Jesus does all three of them when he's descending. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has descended. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is here right now. Amen. Praise God. And there's a shout. And what is a shout? It's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride. So what's the purpose of the shout? The message to call you and me &gt;&gt; to bring the bride into her rightful position &gt;&gt; so that she can so she can produce the body change. Amen. Praise God. Then the next thing that happens you can go to the next slide is and this is from the rapture message is the voice. Therefore the message calls the bride together. The same morning with a loud voice he screamed out with that shout. So within the shout is the voice of God and the voice of God is what wakes up the sleeping saints. and brings us into our recognition of who we are, the living bride &gt;&gt; here on earth. Amen. Bringing Eve back into full manifestation, but this time not deceived. She's one with him. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So with a loud voice, he cried, "Lazarus, come forth." See, and the voice wakes up the sleeping bride, the sleeping dead. Amen. So this voice that's now in the land and the shout that's now in the land, and we know the shout is the message is in you and me. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we receive the message of the hour and we recognize that it's Christ coming to the present stage of his ministry, we realize that we are the ones that are now his voice. &gt;&gt; We carry the shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a shout. And you know, like this Sunday, we're going to be looking a little bit deeper into, you know, the inheritance and um the incorruptible inheritance. And we're going to be looking at the shout actually and how the shout is now in the bride and you know how that shout was in the mind of God right when he was talking to to to Job when he says where were you when the sons of God shouted hallelujah that same shout is now in you and me. Amen. because his plan was always for him to be God in man here on earth. Amen. Praise God. Glory to God. And so the next thing is the trumpet. Go to the next slide. Also from the rapture message, he says, "Now the next is what?" A trumpet. Amen. A voice, a shout, a voice, a trumpet. Now the third thing is a trumpet which always at the feast of trumpet is calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride's supper, the lamb's supper with the bride in the sky. Amen. We're going to get that last trump of God. Amen. There's going to be a trumpet that's going to sound within our hearts and our souls. It's going to quicken us. It's going to translate us. It's it's going to move us to that to that wedding supper because this listen the marriage the marriage has already taken place. &gt;&gt; If you've received the word for your day and you've recognized the opening of that seventh seal, you've recognized that the mighty angel is Christ come down to meet with his bride. Amen. That's the invisible union of the bride. Glory to God. Amen. This is what we've already recognized. We've already come into that relationship. Glory. Amen. And the supper is that meeting in the air. That's the that's going to be the the the the you know the the great wedding supper. You know, after the wedding, everybody goes for a great wedding supper, but the wedding's already consummated. The bride and the groom have already become one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you recognized that you are in union and married to the Lord Jesus Christ? Amen. That's the only one that's going to receive the rapture. Praise God. These are simple things. I know, but this is a Bible study, right? And so, we're looking at the at these things and we're just looking at the simplicity. We're being reminded of who we are, the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. Glory to God. And so, our next slide is 1 Corinthians 15:51-54. Now he says, "Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. Amen. Praise God. Listen, to a lot of people, this sounds like a fantasy. You know, you even talk to Christians, you get out there and you talk to some Christians and they say, "Yeah, I believe the Lord Jesus Christ." And then you get into talking about the rapture and you say, "Well, do you understand that you're that you're going to be changed in a moment and in a twinkling of an eye? You're going to be translated out of this earthly dimension which is falling apart around you. Do you understand that? Do you recognize that that's something that's already started? It's in progress now. And in order for you to be a part of that, you need to receive the Holy Ghost for your day &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost for our day is what produces the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't come any other way. And so these scriptures are are scriptures that that you know to the common person they don't understand it. It's not a reality to them because they haven't come into that personal experience with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It only comes when that personal revelation breaks into your heart about putting on immortality. Understanding that you don't that that you you you come from God. You go back to God. &gt;&gt; If you're a son of God, you were always a son of God. &gt;&gt; A son of God is eternal. To be eternal means that you have you you never had a beginning. &gt;&gt; You never can have an end. Amen. These are the realities of immortality. Praise God. We can read these scriptures, but we don't fully understand them. But go to the next slide. A blast from heaven, the trump of God. One day there will come a blast from heaven and the dead in Christ shall rise first. These mortal bodies changed and made like unto his own glorious body. Amen. We're going to have eternal bodies. We're going to go back to the body that we had. Amen. Our theophony body, which is a, you know, the one that brother Brandham saw when he went to beyond the curtain of time. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; I know that you know you're in these bodies. I know what I feel in the morning when I wake up. I know what you feel. You know, I know you young people, you just enjoy your your youth, but you know, uh you know, like we're we're feeling it. Amen. We're feeling that that we want this this change. We're feeling that we're looking forward to that that uh that change of that incorruptible body. Amen. That glorious body like unto his glorious body. What a parade that'll be when it starts heavenward some of these days in that rapturing time that lays ahead. Oh, proudly displaying the blood of Jesus Christ upon their chests. The message of God in the hour that they lived. &gt;&gt; That's the hour that we're looking forward to, brother. Amen. Praise God. We know that we've recognized the message for our day. We know that the message of this hour produces the rapture. &gt;&gt; We know that it's already in progress. &gt;&gt; We recognize that that God sent us a prophet that would introduce the mighty angel himself, which is the only way that that that you could receive rapturing faith. Amen. Listen, all those other seven church ages could not produce the rapture. could not produce the change of our bodies. Amen. We're the only age that receives the change because of the mighty angel come down to take possession and for us to become one with him. Amen. So that we can be changed by in the in the same way that he quickened himself. Amen. Praise God. Jesus showed the the the type of the rapture when he came the first time and he he he gave up the ghost and then he went to hell. Amen. He went to hell to to loose all of those that were chained up and and had could had had not received their theophony bodies yet. Amen. But he came took on that theophony went there released them and took them to their theophies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. And now we are we are looking forward to the to the final change that finishes the fullness of the word for this day and for this hour. &gt;&gt; To do what? Go to the next slide. To become young men and women again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the rapture is all about. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. To be young again. To be whole. Hallelujah. The whole thing. There's a there'll be a resurrection, a rapture, and a way it'll go. And before it ever go up to meet him by faith, I believe it in his grace that we will be among those people that'll be caught up. Amen. You believe that these mortal bodies will not see death, but just just of a sudden, they'll be like a sweep go over us and you're changed. You're turned back like Abraham was from an old man to a young man, from an old woman to a young woman. Glory to God. What's this sudden change? And after a while, you'll you're traveling like a thought. And you can see those then who are already resurrected. Oh, what an hour. Then we'll gather with them and then be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air. Amen. Glory to God. Praise God. Hallelujah. Let's go to the next slide. And the body of Christ will come down. The corporal body of the Lord Jesus Christ sitting on the throne of God. That body will rise from the throne again. He will come back to earth. And when he does, every spirit that's born again will come back to a corporal body. young man and woman and live forever in the presence of God. He's left the throne. &gt;&gt; He's come to throne himself in you and me. Amen. Glory to God. This is the hour. This is the time. This is the season that we're living in right now. The rapture is in progress now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Forever more. Amen. So, let's look at, you know, some silent facts about the rapture. Now, you know, we're in that half hour of silence. How many recognize that we're in that time and season right now where God is secretly where the Lord Jesus is secretly catching away one here, one there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll take one, he'll leave one. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why, look, we don't have a full church &gt;&gt; on Sundays. We're not packed out. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Don't expect us to have, you know, a huge packed out church. &gt;&gt; Okay? God can add what he Listen, it's the Lord that adds, it's the Lord that takes. &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. But this message has never been a great big flock. &gt;&gt; It's always been a little flock. &gt;&gt; That's why this this message of the hour, you you know there's one here, one there. You know, don't expect, you know, you might talk to a thousand people and and one or two of them might just even look into it. What is it? Because this message is not a message that that invites everybody. &gt;&gt; This message is about a little flock. It's about the attributes of God. It's about God's mind from the very beginning having having thoughts of just his family. Now, I know it sounds like, you know, well, what do you, you know, people think that, you know, that that that we're, you know, what are we trying to say that we're, you know, uh, unique and this and that. It's not that we're new unique. It's that the Lord, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. All you need to do is go back and look through history. Look at the days of Noah. The whole world had gone into corruption. The Bible says, "As it was in the days of Noah, &gt;&gt; so shall it be when the Son of Man is being revealed." &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Because because all you got to do is take a quick look around to see that we're in the days of Noah &gt;&gt; and even worse &gt;&gt; because nobody is like taking God's word literally the way that you and I and and that little flock takes the word of God. they'll take it and they'll apply it and, you know, they'll they'll they'll create like a a religious, you know, experience because maybe their mum and their father were were Christians and or belonged to a church. But I'm talking about the reality of where what we're talking about here right now about the word being revealed to you by revelation that you're already raptured. The rapture started in your life when you received this message and you separated from friends, from family. You couldn't help it. You you because it it it it just made perfect sense to you. But you're a small flock. &gt;&gt; You're a minority. You're always going to be a minority. &gt;&gt; It's never going to be accepted by the masses. They're not going to accept this message of of the rapture of Christ, you know, his second coming. You tell somebody, you know, about the, you know, they'll tell you, "Oh, we're waiting on the coming of the Lord." You tell them, "He's already come. &gt;&gt; He's here now. He's living in a people. He's gathering every Sunday, every Wednesday in in churches with these with these minorities that are that are that are rejoicing, that are zealous about the word of God. They've allowed his word to take possession of their lives. They live different. We live different. We don't act like the rest of the world. &gt;&gt; They're out there and, you know, you get to talking to people and even Christians and all of a sudden the F-word comes this way, the F-word goes that way. They talk about these bars and these uh you know things that they look at and pornography and all these things and you go into their offices and you see pictures on their walls and you know they claim to be Christian but then they they there's a totally different life there. &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; You're a minority. &gt;&gt; You're a minority. You're never going to be, you know, where like, yeah, you, you know, we we have camp meetings and we have, you know, special meetings and and you know, we pack out the house and many people come in and it's it's, you know, people of like, precious faith. But you go out there and you know you you you you try to you know share the message of the hour and right away you know you'll tell them that God sent a prophet and you know right away they'll look into it and the first thing they'll do is they'll go on the internet and they'll pop up his name and they're going to see just as many people saying false prophet &gt;&gt; uh you know cult as there are people that are saying he is the genuine prophet of Malachi 4:5. He was the messenger of Revelations 10 1-7. But you see, by revelation, &gt;&gt; you can say amen. &gt;&gt; You've recognized the word for your day. &gt;&gt; By revelation, what what is revelation? God revealing it to you. &gt;&gt; Because because you were always a son or a daughter of God. And by predestination, by his fornowledge, he could predestinate and know that when the word was going to come to you, you would willingly desire it. &gt;&gt; You'd you'd recognize something because there was something in you from before the foundations of the world. So don't think that in this time where this church is being called out that the majority are going to recognize it. It's a secret. It's a mystery. But there's fellowship in the mystery. &gt;&gt; But you need to recognize that God sent a prophet. Then you need to recognize that God sent them to introduce the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You see, they never recognize John the Baptist, the first coming. &gt;&gt; Just go back and look at, you know, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Like I said, the days of Noah, eight went into the ark. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the days of Jesus, there was a dozen. And those that those that follow John the Baptist, a lot of them, even John the Baptist himself had to say, "Go and check. Is he the one?" &gt;&gt; Imagine. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you're living in this flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't know. You know, you got to understand that this is your enemy. &gt;&gt; This doubts God. This is emnity with God. &gt;&gt; That's why it's a struggle for you to even get into the house of the Lord. People don't realize it's because their flesh is weak. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And and you know even getting into the house of the Lord is a great victory. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you &gt;&gt; people they say you know you you ask you know some people how often you go to church. Well we go to church on Sunday we go Wednesday we have prayer meeting on Friday night. What? Three times. Yeah. And then during the day we listen to the tapes. We read our Bible every day. We pray every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Because the life of God is in me. &gt;&gt; I've got THE LIFE OF GOD in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when the life of God comes in you, it it just automatically, you know, you you you feed on the word of God because the the word is your is your bread of life. &gt;&gt; It's the only thing that sustains you. Just try it. when you get depressed, when you get, you know, you know, into a state of, you know, where the enemy attacks you and all the cares of this life, just go start reading the word, listen to a message, get into the house of the Lord. Amen. And all of a sudden, you start to feed on the word of God, and what you eat, you start to become. &gt;&gt; You feed that life that's in you. Amen. You know it it blessed is he that thirsts and hungers &gt;&gt; after righteousness for he shall be filled and there's only one righteousness that's the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So while we're in this you know this time of silence because you know for us we're a small group. It's like, you know, few of us go to church and, you know, we we we we dedicate our lives to the Lord, but in the midst of all this silence, God is doing something wonderful. &gt;&gt; He's uniting personally with each and every individual. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So when we look at this, we can look at the next slide. facts about the rapture. It's the next greatest event for the church. It will shock many who believe they were Christians. Broken Sisters 1964, he says, "But when he comes this time, hardly none, but those who are ready will know when he comes." You think this is just a regular Wednesday night service, but we're being reminded that the rapture is in progress now. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's going to be some that are going though th that's us. &gt;&gt; He says hardly none, but those who are ready will know when he comes. He's already come. We know that he's in our midst. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're feeding on the word for this hour. It's changing us. It's giving us victory. Glory to God. There'll just be an absence of people. They won't know what happened to them. They'll just be caught away in a moment. They'll just come up missing. I'll tell you, we talk about it every now and then, my wife and I. You know, we we talk about, you know, well, man, when that morning, you know, happens and that day happens and we're changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, and all these people that we've, you know, that we've met, that we've talked to, that we've told them about, you know, Christ and we've told them about serving God, we've told them about the rapture, even our family, even our children. I don't know. You know, listen, God, listen. I believe with all my heart that my children are coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart. But they're going to need to receive him. &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. In his time, all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, I'm not going to I'm not going to tell the Lord what to do. If your children are in the rapture, they were in it before the foundations of the world. &gt;&gt; You can't change it. I can't change it. &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. &gt;&gt; But I believe with all my heart that they're there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God's going to interpret it. Amen. But even still, there's going to be those that are going to be left behind when this rapture happens. You're going to disappear. They're going to be calling you. Hey, did you hear from so and so? Hey, I've been trying to get a hold of so and so, you know, for a week, two weeks. Then they'll hear in the news maybe a little article about, you know, many have gone missing in churches around the earth. You know, they're small churches. They're not big churches. They're not in, you know, the big denominational churches because you cannot denominate Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Christ is a mystical body, a living body. Amen. Glory to God. The body of Christ is made up of many members, sons and daughters of God. Amen. When that's why when we say uh you know are you a Christian? You ask are you a Christian? They say well I'm a Baptist. Well I'm a Methodist. Well I'm a Catholic. No no no I didn't ask you that. I asked if you were a Christian. A Christian is one like Christ. &gt;&gt; One that's Christlike. One that has the same spirit of Christ in them. Amen. Praise God. They'll just come up missing changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye. So, just be ready for that. It'll be horrible some morning to miss a loved one. No one can find them. Won't it be too bad to know it's done past and you missed it? So, just keep before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The rapture is in progress. &gt;&gt; Next slide. It will be a sudden catching away. God hiding himself in simplicity. He says, "The time is at hand, church. The time is at hand. Don't wait any longer." See, how do you know the rapture's not going on all the time? How do you know the rapture is not It is going on. It is in progress. here. Brother Brandon, back in 1963, he had this revelation that was coming on him that the rapture was imminent, that the rapture was in progress, that that there was there was a great event that was that was just about to take place. Amen. Because the there the rapture could not be produced without the opening of those seven seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. The rapture comes as a result of the opening of those seven seals. Amen. Because it brought Christ to the earth &gt;&gt; to unite with man. Amen. It's going to be a supernatural event. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So here, first thing you know, it'll be passed one disappearing here and there. It'll be gone the first thing you know. and your judgment will and and you'll judgement will strike the world. You say, "Well, I thought this. It's too late now." You remember they didn't know it until the day they entered into the ark. And then it was too late. The foolish virgin didn't know until she come back and found the wise virgins gone. Oh my. Then she was left for the tribulation period. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. There's a wise and a foolish virgin. &gt;&gt; Amen. People think that the foolish virgin is all the denominations out there. They're not even close. &gt;&gt; Because a virgin is somebody that's a virgin. They've they've not been with anybody else. They believe that they have given their life completely over to Christ. Amen. But there's a wise virgin and there's a foolish virgin. Number three, there shall be no second version or repeat performance of this event. Interesting. The rapture is only going to happen once. &gt;&gt; Amen. for you and me in this hour. Glory to God. When the proclamation went out, the decree, the bridegroom's coming, everybody wanted to get right right quick. Like the foolish virgin, hey, they went right right away to the wise virgin says, "Hey, give me oil. Give me oil." You know, the bridegroom's call has gone forth. I'm telling you, the bridegroom call is now shouting in this message. And there's people that are coming to realize that they haven't got the oil. They're starting to panic. They're wondering, "Well, well, what's going on here? Why why is it that that that I'm not having victory in my life? Why is it that I'm more miserable than I am excited? Because the rapture, even the even the definition of the word rapture is extreme joy." Listen, you could be having trials. Everybody's got trials. &gt;&gt; You're going to have tests. But the word of God in you has already made a way. &gt;&gt; So, you should be the you should be the happiest person on earth. You should have an excitement. It's like one minute you're like, "Oh my gosh, this whole situation over here and this these the it's so frustrating." Then over here it's like glory, hallelujah, praise God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. I'M SO GLAD that I came into the house of the Lord tonight. You see, it's it's almost like you're you're schizophrenic. [laughter] Hallelujah. But it's it's it's that battle. It's that great battle that you've got to deal with in this dimension. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we but we've come to realize that that that the Lord himself has come in. Greater is he that is in me &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world. Amen. Glory to God. So, we've got this excitement in us. Amen. So, when the proclamation went out, the decree, the bridegroom's coming, everybody wanted to get right right quick. Ain't that the hour when the handwriting's on the wall? Oh, we want the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We want this, that, or the other. But while they went to buy, the bridegroom came. Amen. The wise went in and they were left outside where there was weeping, wailing and nashing of teeth. Saints, the bridegroom call is now shouting and in progress in the bride. She knows that the mighty angel under the leadership of the five-fold ministry is is the leadership of the five-fold ministry. That it's the mighty angel that's perfecting the bride through the five-fold ministry. She recognizes that the voice is now in the bride. She recognizes that. She realizes that that uh she has the oil. &gt;&gt; She's got the oil. She she knows where she's standing. Amen. Praise God. But go to the next slide. The vi the wise virgin shall be separated from the foolish virgins. That's what's going on right now. Not from the denominations. No, there's denomination now within the boundaries of this message. What is denomination? Is when man wants to take by his own hierarchy control over the people by by by putting his agenda, their political agenda, their organized agenda. &gt;&gt; That's what organized religion does. It started back in the days of of the Roman uh Senate when they had the emperor and then all of the different uh you know that's what that the whole political system all the world systems and the political systems are organized that way even companies publicly traded companies and most companies are organized and set up in that way. What is it? That organized system is what always put the head out which was Christ. And that's what's happening right now. There's a separation between the wise and the foolish virgins. Virgin means purity. They were all good people. Every one of them virgin sanctified vessels of God. But those who had oil in their lamps went in and the utters were left out. What is the oil? The Holy Ghost for this hour. &gt;&gt; People don't realize that the Holy Ghost for this hour was the coming of the Lord, the mighty angel coming down in 1963. They don't recognize that that is the oil. Not for a day gone by. For this hour, the Holy Ghost for this hour, &gt;&gt; recognizing Christ in the present stage of his ministry. &gt;&gt; This is the rapture now in progress. They were all virgins. everyone people that you couldn't put your finger on for anything wrong. They everyone believed in the coming of the Lord. They were ready to go and meet him. But some of of them let their oil go out. They didn't realize that they got caught into some doctrine. They got pulled away by the teachings of man. They got drawn away. But there's a a shout in the land right now saying, "Come out of her, my people." &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Don't let that be your case. Keep oil in your lamp. Oil is the spirit, the Holy Spirit. Never let it drain from you. When you feel your love dying away, your sincerity to Christ and and to the to the cause, quickly go to him who has the fountain of oil and buy for yourself a filling of the Holy Spirit. Amen. You know, like we were talking about on Sunday, God gave you free moral agency. God gave you your own ability to choose. There is a will which is the will of God. Amen. There's that will of God that's that that that that that's in you to to will and to do what what he desires, but you have to surrender to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Too many people are are letting the the the the cares of this world and the pulls of this dimension pull them away from their regular attendance in church, from their regular prayer life, from their fellowship with the brethren. Amen. We know what we need to do. The bride knows what to do with the word &gt;&gt; and that is to assemble ourselves to to fellowship to read the word to to commit our lives in prayer by by by dedication by by you know letting go of the things of this world. This is this is the hour where the rapture is is separating us. Amen. We've got to let go of those things that are that are so easily pulling us away. The little foxes that spoil the vine. Amen. Praise God. Amen. Now, she's not the bride, but it's the church, the pure people that didn't have the opportunity maybe to receive the message or in some way that they were blinded. Are you on number five? Sorry, go to number five. The foolish virgin rejects the message of their day. The first thing was that the sleeping virgins had to go through the tribulation period for purification. She had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message. That's what happens to the foolish virgin. We need to understand, you know, what's what the rapture is going to produce. There's a wise and there's a foolish. Well, now we know exactly where the foolish virgin goes. They go into the tribulation. They were virgins. Now, she's not the bride, but it's the church, the pure people that didn't have the opportunity maybe to receive the message or in some way that they were blinded by these false prophets and they didn't get a chance and yet they're really sincere in heart and God knows their heart and here they're purged during this time. So, there's going to be a lot of people. That's why don't, you know, there's people that are going to be saved going through the tribulation. They're going to have to be purged of their unbelief because they didn't allow the word to purge them while they were able. It's a paradox, saints. You know, it's a paradox. But the attribute of God has to be there in order to recognize the word for the day because it's the word that purifies you, purges you of the unbelief &gt;&gt; and the deception that's now in the land that it would be so deceiving that it would deceive even the very elect if it was possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. They didn't get a chance and yet they're really sincere in heart and God knows their heart. Amen. Let's go to the next slide as we we're going to close here. For the wise virgin, the rapture is now in progress. Amen. She recognizes her day and its message. Praise God. Luke 12:40, "Be ye therefore ready also, for the Son of Man cometh at an hour when you think not." Let the musicians come. Amen. Praise God. This is the hour of the son of man. And in closing, I want to read this quote here. 1964. See, it's the son of man. Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh among us. He's doing it right now. and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one, the bride. And then she'll go home to the wedding supper. Amen. Glory to God. She's already united. That's why I said the rapture is in progress now. We've already married Christ &gt;&gt; by receiving his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, we go to the wedding supp we we go to the wedding supper, not the marriage. The rapture is going to the wedding supper. When the word here unites with the person and they too become one and then what and then what does it do then? It manifests the son of man again. Not the church theologians, the son of man. The word and the church becomes one. Whatever the son of man done, he was the word. The church does the same thing. &gt;&gt; You see the ministry of the son of man. It's Christ in you now. It's Christ dealing with your life now, changing you now, translating you now, doing doing a a great work in your life now, bringing out the character that you have need of in order to represent [music] him and to speak on his behalf. People need to recognize that that this is a a a honing [music] time that he's looking for a bride that is going to actually be him, his voice, his thoughts, his ways, his desires, [music] his love, his fellowship. Praise God. Amen. The rapture is in progress [music] now. Are you glad to be a part of it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Simple reminder of who we are and the hour that we're living in. God is just giving us a a refreshing to remind us, hey, you've received the right revelation. You're exactly where you're supposed to be, receiving the word for this day and for this hour.
