TRANSCRIPT
========================================
full of equipping of the saints his consecrated people that they should do the work of ministering towards Billy pop Christ by the church that it might enough until we all attain what this in the faith in the comprehension of the full and accurate knowledge of the Son of God that we might arrive at relieve a cure manhood the completeness of personality which is nothing less than the standard height of Christ's own perfection the measure of the stature of the fullness of the Christ and the completeness in that's right when you read it that way it certainly exposed things it certainly gives us a much clearer understanding you know like you know just like you're seeing on one thing that is a necessity that the Bride of Christ the Church of God the people that have been called to the rapture were called to the rapture to join the church not called to be a member not called to be just a you know a Pew warmer and you know maybe just a cleaner in the church or I'm not talking about that I'm talking about the rapture of the church where there's going to be a people that are going to finally fulfill the scriptures that to the rapture that in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we are going to be changed and we are going to be caught up and they which are alive and remain shall not hinder them that sleep for days shall be risen first and we will be caught up to meet with them and meet the Lord in the air that's what we represent in this thing in the south and so the Word of God that we are receiving right now and every time we come into the house of our to hear and to listen to the word is in order for us to receive that anointed word to produce the rapture of the church and you as an individual person to be placed in the body nourishes and mattifies and builds up the church the Living dummy next now if we look here God's design of the church she beaches 4:11 Christ gave who nobody give he did some as apostles some of his prophets up as he manages and some as pastors and teachers but what is it [Music] himself the gift of the office and the position of each and every one of these offices he gave of himself for one purpose of the Saints so everything that we are receiving right now to the Word of God through this fivefold ministry is for the purpose of equipping you did you prepare you the overcoming power that you need to live in this part of world because you must overcome you will not make it without overcoming you all your faith you know you give up he'll backslide blow things if you're not prepared to overcome but God gives you a promise is dismissed I'm going to send you what you need so why are you so worried she was receiving [Music] and do your part and just sit there and be low and be patient it'll reach about the statue of a perfect man until he said very clearly would appreciate somehow creature this is a doctrine I'm talking about the reality of what the Holy Ghost comes into your life put on these things you don't cook any don't put on patience that's gonna be this brotherly kindness and that's so easy to read through it so amen that's why you got three kinds of believers in every Church so that they can fulfill the revelation [Music] that's right you gotta realize that you are what you want you gotta know that you know that you know who you are and then you can get into your office because it's because you believe it's because you experience you know that it's not some teaching you know that he's a reality he took you for the life of I believe he took you from from a simple condition and turned you into a input direction where were your futures [Music] you see so that we can grow into the into the maturity and so that we can grow into our positions you know just automatically walk into your position you are positionally placed and then God starts to give you divine supernatural instruction by revelation that's why revelation is so important and that's why the the unity is not unity so much so because this is a revelation this is being able to recognize and look at the body of Christ see your brothers and sisters see their their third earth Korky mr. the station because we all got every single one of us is God don't open Televi you're perfect because if you know there's no perfect in this house there are sons and daughters of God that have perfect attributes of God but they're living in these imperfect vessels that are constantly needing to be pampered and rested and all all kinds of emotional aspects of being human okay it's just you know sometimes you just get fed up you just you know because because human just look at how you know how you know but the attribute the purpose of God through the scripture season because you know the landscape director the corporation where we live there and you know an enticing them smuggle stuff there is no supplement to this you know you're very you just you know you just do it because your sole and that's why I look at it in a little book to people for her for my needs I realized that we have to work together that we have to buy my ultimate is Bob he's the one that pays me he's the one that gives me II you so what heals me that's how you gotta think you can beat up if you don't think that way think about this you start looking at depending on other people and decide disappoint the people walk by and see their you know about three weeks ago mother and daughter come up and they just took to the slice right off you know this is not right this is not right and this should have been done and this should have been done because the other landscapers right that I just I don't do stuff I control the landscapers and I'm looking around and I tried to separate opposite I said you know what's interesting I said I'm looking around and 90% of as if you do the worthless job here you know everything looks Wow look at this look at that look at this I said well it's a funny pickup people just generally yeah so the first thing they want to bring up is what's negative right and it's you know what you realize world wars a son or daughter of God because God is possibly now God is looking at you and he can look at all the negative even look at all your folks and he could be continually just just smashing you down he doesn't [Music] [Music] very simple we all take the unity of the revelation this is about how the revelation of unity in the body of Christ listen there's a nation's out there and you know we might sound like you don't work lift it up or we're not we're just telling you what the Word of God says and the left to agree how can they walk together there it is there's a unity out there or you know by just attending church and by doing things together and by nobody will do by compromising on this and that God is not a compromiser hey there is going to be when Jesus came to the earth just like he come today he could not just walk in there like and just say well everybody got his love everybody who saved everybody is fired in that would be contrary to this work that would be contrary to what he represented from the foundations of the world what the plan of redemption was to redeem sons and daughters of God but we done to this space of time and matter and elements were vessels were created and bodies were reading the Bible says there are children of God and there are children of this world the devil took place in the garden be we cannot change that don't try to change that but try to mix with the world because the truth is the only thing but they've got a unity out there and this unity is things would be fine they think it's okay they have mediators you know the Catholic Church has all kinds of mediators when they travel they call me dear Christopher when they need something to sell they call me dear st. Joseph it takes tattoos and they bury them in the front of the house that needs to be sold you see people to think I'm fake like that anyway there's a chance it's like it's like you know this is the situation and this is the faith and this is what we're believing in and I'm not there to tell them that you know that they're wrong because they need a revelation they need a revelation that your child is their provider and there is only one mediator the scripture says clearly and that is the Lord Jesus [Music] [Music] it's a profit summer well my field [Music] [Music] this is why they come to this revelation come to this message and so this will brush it's happening and that's taking place it's tremendous it's also it's also like almost like you know over love the in times because there's a from the revelation the property says Jesus perfect because he was notice that it come because he was the work and you become a bird you become a word as you receive I was so blessed this way but I got a rifle and it was a message from brother [Music] [Music] he says you [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus Christ because the church is a lie it's an eye of Jesus Christ that has spirits that knows him that some participants in the church have great expectations enjoy while others feel disappointed on earth by past experiences why do you think he had the place without it of forgiveness repent in other words turn away and baptized in his name my taking on that anyone submit to her husband by receiving his name shows that there's a raw revelation of Christ and the church and their relationship is learning I'm not talking this is about these people this is the word of the Lord amen and so when you do that you recapture baptized the navel or do you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you're forgetting about your past it doesn't exist any more than yesterday [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] past experiences leave them in the hey go on what makes the church stronger week well we make it understandable the church will break the influence what shape the church will take in the future what makes Observatory in the red says the church is the people is the character of the people the revelation of the people are living lives it will give you can move around - you can get discouraged by so many of the carnal believers that are constantly having to battle that are in constant trouble it's just the way that's all part of overcoming [Music] [Music] we talked about that's exactly how he's doing it in this hour don't be looking you know looking anywhere else for you who has the church here at goodness [Music] [Music] [Music] and you still are settled if you can't find your placing and your Shepherd and where God is positionally placed you is because you're still because you must be born in order to see the kingdom of God seeing is understanding seeing is the ability to receive revelation on the Word of God for your day that's what this is all about and so God has provided those things each believer that's how God designed colleague or vocation every single one I was reading it here in the book of Ephesians if you read here Ephesians chapter 2 verse 21 it says in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord in whom he also are builded a habitation of God through the spirit if you look at Ephesians chapter 4 or 16 he says here he says for whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint I'm looking at a lot of joints here every joint together and compacted by that which every joint supplies according to the effectual working in the measure of every part you see how everything works how every one of us has a place in the body of Christ and when we are all positionally placed because God gave you a position of location God gave you an office in the body and when you come into it and it's not because you're a trustee or a deacon or a novelty verse and not because of them but because remember revelation of being in that office there's a big difference there's a huge difference when something operates by faith because remember is coming into the unity of the faith that breeze that supernatural power and presence of God in your life within the ministry and so every one of us is beside God never placed you in the Lamb's Book of Life without seeing you exactly how you are going to be and the position that you are going to take some of you ended up being this Sunday school teacher whatever position it's the bike of God for you if you operate unclean because you believe that nourish the body press that's one word when one joint starts to get our price things go blue as well you know arthritis is one of the biggest demons are hurt right now what because it tries to paralyze the body and what do you think is trying to do to you when when when somebody in the body because God is kind of nice every point what do you think that is exactly paralysis it's a fear of paralysis I don't want to hear unless stuff has written to me in my office in my position whether it has to come in the right time of season that he positions B and he gives me the strength to deal with it because God has offices and positions within the body to deal with all that stuff and so when you got a situation you've got some situation [Music] and you've got to speak into somebody else you got you got to release that demon you don't realize what you're doing you're spreading arthritis and the body of Christ are we gonna keep this simple to do we want to know what it's gonna take to get victory victory in our lives personally you don't want to be listening to those reports evening but somebody comes to you and that's the first thing that's not about anybody else here because it could be it could be releasing something that is not identified or build or strengthened my god and that's why with situations rise up we gotta get to the right cut the root man take the head off and tell the people not just walk don't let these things come on don't let these things enter you because this is the perfecting time this is the perfecting of the body of Jesus Christ this is there's gonna be a season where the church is gotta be need to do this I need to do that these people you know what the word is gonna do I'm talkin what the word is gonna do because the word is going to come [Music] let's get this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] people are so high educational [Music] if you have a revelation I got nothing against school and education and being being smart and they're doing well and getting degrees and everything else but you've got a revelation that you know that is for the purpose of God like their life is now or being God and that your purpose and your life mission is God Himself the fulfillment of the word for the rapture of the church that's great it's an edifying aspect to the body of Christ when somebody can you know put the word and have fellowship rather work but when it's just intellectual without revelation they can be irritated it's just that simple because it takes science it takes all of the laws of this world it puts that all and what is possible with God because all things are possible you talk to a doctor and if they're too intellectually they've got a revelation they could've put God first in terms of the medicine first that's why when you go to the doctor the first thing wants to do is give you this you come to me or a minister or somebody filled with the Holy Ghost and I see Jesus name brother sister received the healing that God said I am the Lord God that healeth all [Music] you know Hoover in athens of us weekend you know brother jump uncle is a pest boys oh brother you heard of the the brother there in in Calgary sista to get a chance to visible with the people in Congress early counted one leg and so he says always a bastard their brother Kenan could get his Las Vegas he says guy was diagnosed about six months ago with a tumor at the brain gave us ordinary consulate said Wow garbage he says he went for a check-up after he went to see the doctor they examined everything [Music] because he's the Lord that healeth awkward is easy to name anything and he knows you the attribute that you are the purpose that you have and I look back at my life brother Chris say to God I should've been dead a few times I'm serious I was a big-time risk taker I jumped out of a plane at 4,500 feet I was but it wasn't I see every single one of us we cannot leave here unless God gives us a testimony and then you've got a paradox for the poor brother they're in Brockton and it's been swiped the son what is it it's God's plan God's purpose we cannot interpret Asia [Music] [Music] when you are in your position and believers are set aside for specific answers the kids cover everything necessary for Christ by just right God everything that we need so don't think oh maybe I should you might be just caught on the worst vacation of your life the what purpose to fill the body of Christ you want to step back you want to click runnable this week wiggle that way when God is right now moving on to perfection where he's perfecting the bride if you do if you do fall away to because your be left if you're not ever find and billion and walk in the body of Christ that God has placed you this is not the season [Music] [Music] what fear in high school place decide right now has will not be controlled by Fiat right because the sole equations that you can look in fear Bellini able to fear of eldest purify that spirit friendship fear relationships fear all these things though thou shalt not control this house right is what pleases God [Music] [Music] [Music]
