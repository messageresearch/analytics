[0:24] Amen we're happy to be here uh we feel a

[0:40] hallelujah before I I go further um I
[0:44] don't know how many people in here maybe
[0:46] have an iPhone if you do have one I have
[0:48] a little dongle here I'd like to give
[0:50] away um it's just for charging the
[0:53] iPhone it's just small and easy to carry
[0:56] in a purse or a pocket and you can
[0:58] charge your iPhone quite easily with it
[1:01] praise God it's a lightning cable right
[1:04] just a little so if you have a you do
[1:10] have I I have some more in my
[1:15] office no that's all right um I have
[1:18] some more in my office there but I got
[1:20] it first
[1:23] maybe I have maybe about three or four
[1:26] more in my office so if there's anybody
[1:28] else see Breen Tim after the
[1:33] service give you
[1:36] H right I going to give give them to him
[1:40] and he can give it to you praise the
[1:42] Lord glad to see all of you and we can
[1:45] be here especially on this wonderful and
[1:48] precious day especially during this week
[1:51] we know it was uh women's day uh on the
[1:55] 8th and there was a celebration of
[1:58] Womanhood throughout the entire world
[2:01] however we understand that the world
[2:03] doesn't have a clear grip on the value
[2:07] of Womanhood praise the Lord um and
[2:11] that's what I want to talk about today
[2:14] and hopefully it will be a blessing to
[2:15] you and even to some people in the
[2:17] message they don't have a real
[2:20] Revelation and understanding of the
[2:22] value of a woman and of Womanhood and
[2:26] some women themselves have no idea idea
[2:30] of the value of their own Womanhood as
[2:34] I've always says I've always said uh
[2:38] sounds funny when I say that you got the
[2:40] power in your
[2:41] hands women have the power in their
[2:44] hands I mean you demonstrate your
[2:47] husband get a little annoyed you pass
[2:48] man just rubed his head and he's ready
[2:50] to
[2:53] swoop praise the Lord in the old days
[2:56] they would say he fall down you have to
[2:58] pass smelling socks
[3:01] but uh that is the fact um as such but
[3:05] some women don't understand their power
[3:08] and that they don't have to go in the
[3:11] way of a man who more than likely will
[3:14] get angry and raise his voice the
[3:16] Woman's power goes the opposite way when
[3:19] she is softer and tender uh some let but
[3:24] you don't
[3:25] know you know the Chinese have a proverb
[3:28] if you true enough eggs against a rock
[3:32] after time it will split that rock and
[3:35] that's the truth just throwing eggs you
[3:37] know they supposed to crack but don't
[3:40] you fool yourself after a while that
[3:42] rock is going to crack right just by
[3:45] throwing eggs so the opposite way praise
[3:48] God but uh let let's just pray cuz I
[3:52] find I'm just moving in there right now
[3:55] um and just uh read one scripture and
[3:59] and that we can stand for the reading of
[4:01] the
[4:02] scripture which is
[4:05] Proverbs and should be up there in front
[4:08] of you Proverbs
[4:11] 3110 praise the
[4:13] Lord praise God
[4:17] hallelujah can we read that
[4:20] together who can find a virtuous woman
[4:26] our value or price is far
[4:30] above rues which means to say she's
[4:34] Priceless brother BR put puts it this
[4:37] way if God could have given a man
[4:39] something
[4:40] better right he would have but he gave
[4:44] him a wife give Adam a wife and that's
[4:48] the value of a wife to a man praise the
[4:52] Lord let us
[4:54] pray our gracious God and Heavenly
[4:57] Father we pray for the opening of the
[5:01] understanding and pray that the great
[5:03] holy spirit will turn the key of David
[5:06] and open our hearts to receive the word
[5:10] sincerely solidly
[5:13] foundationally and may it f uh create a
[5:17] base uh for us to build our lives on we
[5:21] give you praise and honor and Glory
[5:24] today in Jesus name amen please be
[5:27] seated
[5:29] I continue I I would be lacking if I
[5:32] don't mention uh St Patrick's Day how
[5:35] many knows about St Patrick's praise God
[5:38] you don't have to be Irish you just have
[5:40] to be a Christian because as you know St
[5:43] Patrick was the uh the immediate
[5:46] disciple of St Columba is col right col
[5:51] colba sorry
[5:54] some um Columba and you know the story
[5:59] how you went to Ireland and uh they had
[6:02] a lot of snakes in those days in
[6:05] Ireland and God used them with the power
[6:09] of God and somehow he drove out the
[6:10] snakes right got rid of all the snakes
[6:13] now there isly if any snakes in England
[6:17] or Ireland maybe garden snakes but not
[6:19] in poison and God used them to spread
[6:23] the gospel among the Celtic people up
[6:26] there different ones he drew it up stood
[6:30] up against those true Wizards and
[6:32] witches God's power was with him so even
[6:36] though he was
[6:38] not like
[6:39] polycar also uh their names are not
[6:43] written in the Bible but they were like
[6:45] the immediate ones after The Messengers
[6:48] right they were just the first disciple
[6:50] and they were out there and they were
[6:52] mightly use of God their names are even
[6:54] recognized by the Catholic church
[6:55] because it's historical fact of how much
[6:58] power was displayed in their life in
[7:01] those days and times now we know the
[7:04] Irish uh celebrate him because he was an
[7:08] Irish saint and uh they might not know
[7:12] everything about him but the reason why
[7:14] we respect him and regard him and
[7:16] celebrate his life is because of how
[7:19] much God worked through him and used him
[7:23] for the spread of the gospel and
[7:25] touching the hearts of people changing
[7:27] lives changing uh
[7:30] an entire uh entire communities for
[7:33] God's glory okay so much for St Patrick
[7:36] we get back to our topic here of the
[7:39] value of Womanhood now um if you want to
[7:42] uh talk about something having value
[7:45] first of all we understand that um Satan
[7:49] Through the Ages have always tried to
[7:51] devalue devalue that's right the value
[7:53] of
[7:54] Womanhood and so in uh Jewish times and
[7:59] in Greek culture and many other cultures
[8:02] even African culture Chinese culture
[8:07] Indian culture many cultures not just
[8:10] those two that I'm singling out but all
[8:14] over uh the world in various and many
[8:18] cultures women um had a a very low uh
[8:25] value there was an extremely low view of
[8:28] women and women are were seen as
[8:35] property to be
[8:37] owned right they were seen as uh you
[8:42] know let me use the word property either
[8:45] by the father who could sell them
[8:49] off uh can I just talk frankly and
[8:52] practically here praise God hopefully
[8:55] that don't hurt anybody's feelings but
[8:56] if I do I still have to pra the word
[9:00] am but uh women were sold off like
[9:03] chaples by by husbands too can sell off
[9:07] their wife they don't like this one they
[9:09] sell her off buy another one and uh sell
[9:12] them off so some you sisters ought to be
[9:15] rejoicing today that that will happen
[9:17] anymore praise the Lord because men
[9:19] don't sell you off they can't sell you
[9:21] off or they would sell you off praise
[9:23] the Lord and Men you got to be happy
[9:26] that those days are not here anymore
[9:28] also praise God but that's the way it
[9:31] was amen women could not even go testify
[9:34] in the
[9:37] courts they could not inherit any
[9:40] property doesn't matter how rich their
[9:42] father was they were not in the line to
[9:46] receive an inheritance you know how it
[9:49] was it went to the eldest son and then
[9:52] it went down to the next son and so on
[9:55] down the line and um let's not go into
[9:58] that but the son can decide it to give
[10:01] it not to his next brother in life but
[10:03] to his eldest son and so and so on so
[10:06] there's a lot of unfairness and uh wrong
[10:09] things that were done back there amen
[10:13] also even to this modern times and these
[10:17] things I'm mentioning are still
[10:19] happening in certain parts of the world
[10:21] it's not like just ancient times is
[10:23] happening right now right where a boy uh
[10:28] child is Val more than a
[10:31] grandchild and um we see also that women
[10:36] had no
[10:38] claim or right to to to even think or
[10:42] talk of having any
[10:44] education they could not think about it
[10:47] matter of fact listen to One Jewish
[10:50] rabbi he said it is better to burn the
[10:53] Torah that to teach it to a
[10:57] woman that is how much they undervalued
[11:02] devalued uh women in that those days and
[11:06] in that time and to a great extent even
[11:10] to this day right under certain
[11:15] cultures now the Greeks had three
[11:19] reasons for
[11:21] gratitude and they were thinking their
[11:23] God that they were not made he didn't
[11:26] make them in the world as a beast
[11:30] or he didn't send them to the world as a
[11:35] woman or God help me he didn't send me
[11:38] to the world as a
[11:41] barbarian that's their idea of giving
[11:46] God
[11:48] glory Jews were thanking God daily that
[11:53] they were not made a
[11:55] slave they were not made a woman
[11:59] or a dog of a
[12:02] gentile they were thanking God for
[12:06] that now we know there's lots of talk
[12:10] about the hijab and all this stuff you
[12:12] know amongst the Muslims well it's not
[12:14] only amongst the Muslim amounts the
[12:16] really semi Orthodox
[12:19] Jews the women also go
[12:22] Veil right people may not talk about
[12:24] that but the Jews the real Orthodox
[12:27] original Jew je they their women have to
[12:32] be veiled where even their faces are not
[12:36] shown so that sometimes a man couldn't
[12:39] in a crowd of women he couldn't even
[12:41] recognize his own mother he couldn't
[12:43] recognize her because PA had on these uh
[12:47] veils and they had to go sit in a
[12:50] separate gallery of the women right and
[12:54] even to this modern time in certain
[12:56] churches even in certain message
[12:58] churches the women are on one side and
[13:02] the man is on one side is that right and
[13:06] um and the the preacher better not catch
[13:09] one of those men glancing over to the
[13:11] women's
[13:13] side or by say Vera it it's trouble
[13:17] right and know it sounds fun to us but
[13:20] now just imagine that was going on but
[13:24] the bad thing about it it's still going
[13:27] on Amen it's going on in certain
[13:29] countries right now and even in this
[13:32] North America some of those influences
[13:35] are still there Amen in certain
[13:38] churches and if I might divert a bit
[13:41] that has caused a lot of
[13:43] fear uh uh irrational fear and it's
[13:47] caused
[13:48] tension uh and problems even amongst uh
[13:53] young people and even older folk in some
[13:57] of the churches
[13:59] until uh men are scared to shake some of
[14:02] their sisters hands and sisters are
[14:06] scared to Shake The Man Hands I don't
[14:08] know like there's going to be some kind
[14:10] of transfer of something by just shaking
[14:12] the hand you know it's one thing if you
[14:14] shake their hand and then you h on to
[14:16] it anybody can tell that there's
[14:19] something going on
[14:22] there you know but a regular shaking of
[14:27] hands for politeness and and and showing
[14:30] the joy and the happiness of meeting a
[14:33] brother or a sister I wonder what they
[14:35] would do with the scripture when Paul
[14:37] said greet one another with a holy
[14:40] kiss well none of us know what the holy
[14:43] kiss was right if it was the
[14:45] oldfashioned women they just kiss the
[14:47] back of her hand or what it was we don't
[14:50] know what it was or if it was the
[14:52] Italian thing you know where part of
[14:54] russan the same European thing you you
[14:56] just touch you know cheeks one to side
[14:59] side and then touch the other side or
[15:01] whatever we don't know what it was but
[15:03] the fact is that today's culture is that
[15:06] you shake one another's
[15:08] hands and even to the shaking of hands
[15:13] the fake and sad sad say attitude to the
[15:18] point that you can't even you hardly can
[15:21] shake a Brother's hand or a sister's
[15:24] hand without some of these Pharisees
[15:26] eyes on you as if is some kind of crime
[15:29] being committed there's nothing wrong
[15:32] let me drive that spirit away if any of
[15:34] you have it there's nothing wrong with
[15:36] you shaking somebody's hand it's the
[15:39] attitude and intention in the
[15:42] heart and God sees and knows the heart
[15:46] praise the Lord and you're going to know
[15:48] when you over step your bounds you will
[15:51] know because God put a rooster inside to
[15:54] Pro that's your conscience and to warn
[15:57] you and to tell you when you have Ste
[16:00] those bounds but there's nothing wrong
[16:03] with that praise the Lord hallelujah now
[16:06] we know
[16:08] friends that in those days women had two
[16:12] choices to be a good woman and just pray
[16:17] and hope that the man that took her for
[16:20] wife or that she was sold to as a wife
[16:24] would be kind to
[16:27] her kind to her and love her and take
[16:30] care of
[16:31] her the other choice that a woman had in
[16:35] those days was to just throw off the
[16:38] veil and walk the streets and become a
[16:41] harlot those were the two choices only
[16:45] that women had in life back then that's
[16:49] the way it
[16:51] was matter of
[16:53] fact we find out that one musim
[17:00] man saw this Christian gentleman talking
[17:04] to his wife and you know they're talking
[17:07] and and they're walking and they're
[17:08] laughing and smiling together and he was
[17:11] so puzzled he came over and said why are
[17:14] you talking to that woman so much and iy
[17:17] was surprised he said I'm talking to her
[17:20] because she's my wife he said but you're
[17:23] spending so much time with her alone he
[17:25] said because she's my wife and he
[17:27] couldn't get con because he got so many
[17:31] wives right and he don't spend any time
[17:34] with any particular one of them you know
[17:37] uh like that so he doesn't know about
[17:39] having a real deep
[17:42] personal
[17:44] relationship and friendship that goes
[17:48] beyond uh just uh uh you know
[17:52] conjugal um friendship uh and love
[17:57] that's all all they think about or all
[18:00] they know they don't know that your wife
[18:02] is also your companion your wife is your
[18:05] friend your wife is your partner your
[18:07] wife is everything amen amen when she's
[18:10] there with you and we've got to
[18:13] understand that praise the Lord this be
[18:15] talking about woman's day amen and I
[18:18] know I'm preaching about the women but
[18:20] the men need to listen with the ears of
[18:22] wisdom and understanding and know
[18:25] exactly what they should do and how they
[18:28] should act for the glory of God Amen now
[18:32] we know that when we talk about women
[18:35] today and we look at the Bible we
[18:39] understand that God has a complete
[18:40] different view of
[18:43] women because you know he's my mother my
[18:47] father my sister and my brother he's
[18:51] everything to me is that right his name
[18:55] is called in the Old Testament Jehovah
[18:58] how many knows that you know Jehovah
[19:02] means uh the the Lord Our Savior but it
[19:06] also means the breast is God it means
[19:11] God who feeds his children by the breast
[19:16] right and according to our understanding
[19:19] through typology and science symbols the
[19:23] Old Testament is one breast and the New
[19:25] Testament is the other and he feeds us
[19:28] by by his word through the sincere milk
[19:32] of the word through these parts of the
[19:37] Bible the Old and the New Testament
[19:39] given to us for nutrition spiritually
[19:42] and to strengthen us along our life's
[19:45] journey do you believe that amen praise
[19:48] the Lord yes sir
[19:50] Hallelujah and
[19:51] so God in his word um has given women a
[19:56] high value however we do know that there
[20:01] were certain quarters that believe that
[20:04] Christianity is is a a fith that
[20:06] suppresses women they believe that
[20:10] Christianity is a a faith that restricts
[20:14] women and uh women can't come to their
[20:18] full potential in
[20:20] Christianity uh because of certain
[20:23] doctrines that are in the
[20:25] Bible but uh I'll put it to you that
[20:28] it's not
[20:29] the doctrines that are in the Bible but
[20:31] how men interpret the scriptures to the
[20:35] people that caus that uh kind of
[20:38] muddying up of the waters and fuzzing up
[20:42] of the clear light of the truth that is
[20:45] hidden in the word of
[20:47] God now we know that God created man in
[20:51] his own image and the Bible says male
[20:54] and female created he them amen
[20:59] praise the lord they're in my image but
[21:02] their forms outward natural forms may be
[21:05] different right one is male one is
[21:08] female it's just one was placed in a
[21:11] certain body the other one is placed in
[21:13] a certain body but they were made in His
[21:17] image yes male and female made he them
[21:22] praise the Lord glory to God that's
[21:24] Genesis 127 praise God so uh while we
[21:29] celebrate men that were in leadership
[21:33] praise God within the Bible we also find
[21:38] which is not talked about too much that
[21:40] there were women that were in leadership
[21:42] also in the
[21:44] Bible I'll backtrack a little bit you
[21:47] can go back brother to the um first
[21:50] slide just you know value of a woman
[21:53] just leave it
[21:56] there now I and so to this day even that
[22:00] persists and the reason why it
[22:03] persists is because of paulse teaching
[22:08] which tells you
[22:09] clearly that she shall not teach nor you
[22:15] serve Authority in the house of
[22:19] God okay she shall not teach nor you
[22:23] serve Authority in the house of God now
[22:26] some will interpret that
[22:29] in a
[22:30] way as to say that when we come to
[22:33] church like this women shouldn't be able
[22:36] to say anything you got no saying
[22:39] nothing and you should not be able to
[22:41] say anything matter of fact you should
[22:42] just keep quiet and have no place for
[22:47] you in here except to come and praise
[22:50] God and go home and prepare your dinners
[22:54] or whatever and that's about it but
[22:57] that's not the way God
[22:59] intended it in his word now we know that
[23:03] that scripture is telling you which is
[23:06] where I separate from the modern day
[23:10] Pentecostal is that a woman is cannot be
[23:13] ordained or was never ordained to go and
[23:17] preach the
[23:18] gospel for God's
[23:20] glory it's different a woman can go
[23:25] testify if there is no man in an area
[23:28] and woman has the gospel she has a right
[23:31] to teach the gospel but the moment a
[23:33] male figure Rises up then she needs to
[23:37] step back now in the case I know of
[23:41] various cases I know but I'll tell you
[23:43] one this woman was during the times of
[23:46] brother uh William
[23:47] Brandon and she was a great Bible
[23:51] speaker and teacher down in uh the
[23:55] South H and there she had a cute large
[24:00] church and was very well known and known
[24:04] by Brother Bram known to him known by
[24:07] him and had a great
[24:10] ministry but when she went to one of his
[24:13] meetings and he was teaching on these
[24:15] things and showing yes this is what they
[24:17] believe Pentecostals believe the women
[24:20] can just go and uh you know be preachers
[24:23] and be pastors and Bible teacher Bible
[24:27] teachers soal
[24:28] and and um going around like that right
[24:32] and he taught on the scriptures and said
[24:35] yes woman can go teach when there is no
[24:38] male figure around but once there is a
[24:42] male figure around that woman needs to
[24:46] uh let the man take the
[24:49] lead right now we find
[24:52] out that once she heard the gospel I'm
[24:55] not going to preach on that teach that
[24:57] now I'm just touching briefly on it um
[25:00] her grandson is brother Steven
[25:05] Shelly many of you don't know that name
[25:08] years
[25:09] ago she came home and Sunday the next
[25:13] Sunday she got on the pulpit and
[25:15] announced to the
[25:17] congregation that she would be stepping
[25:20] down and she' be handing the post of
[25:25] Pastor and Minister over to her grandson
[25:29] who was a great powerful preacher within
[25:32] a message singer and anointed of God God
[25:36] used him in a mighty way and from that
[25:38] day she sat down and listened to the
[25:41] gospel through her grandson until the
[25:44] Lord took her home and that church still
[25:47] is down in the South so there is a place
[25:51] for women in every single part of the
[25:55] church the only thing God say she should
[25:58] not
[25:59] she shall not teach nor you Ser
[26:04] Authority the positions the places in
[26:06] the church you will not teach nor userve
[26:10] Authority now not to spend time on that
[26:13] but
[26:14] look remember
[26:17] Miriam then Moses have to say Miriam um
[26:21] we just crossed the Red Sea so um I
[26:24] think we need some singing and worship
[26:28] and uh maybe today you should uh you
[26:32] know leave the worship right and you
[26:36] know that culture is still there that
[26:38] you can only have a male was
[26:41] leer ah I'm not going to have amen
[26:46] now but the fact is God anointed her
[26:51] amen and plac her there as a washing
[26:54] leer amen yes sir and uh the Bible said
[26:58] she began to worship god with the
[27:00] tambourine and the other women joined in
[27:03] with her and they were worshiping and
[27:05] praising God and she was in the position
[27:09] back then of leading the
[27:13] worship praise God some of you going to
[27:15] have to struggle with that
[27:17] until your mind all cleared up and
[27:20] everything else praise God
[27:22] hallelujah and what about you can find
[27:25] that in Exodus 15:20
[27:28] right Mah 6:4 and also what about deorah
[27:33] Judges 4 to 5 4 uh advice God used her
[27:38] as a
[27:40] prophetess in those days when Israel had
[27:43] no prophet in the land God could only
[27:48] find a woman that he could use and he
[27:50] use her and her name was
[27:54] deor and she was used to give wisdom and
[27:58] knowledge to the king and the rest of
[28:02] the leaders of Israel she was bringing a
[28:05] revelation praise God
[28:08] hallelujah now listen my friends there
[28:11] was another woman in the Bible called H
[28:15] and she also was a
[28:18] prophetess and what about God using
[28:22] Esther to save the Jewish people at that
[28:26] time from one of their early uh
[28:31] Holocaust that would have happened with
[28:33] them right and God used
[28:36] es and she delivered the Lord helped her
[28:40] to deliver the entire Jewish people amen
[28:43] praise the Lord
[28:45] hallelujah now when we come to the New
[28:48] Testament we find a real shift from the
[28:52] culture in the treatment of
[28:54] women when Jesus came on the scene we
[28:58] find
[28:59] out uh you know while it's not a big
[29:02] deal to us now today back then was a big
[29:05] thing and it was almost like scandalous
[29:09] that a man would have a Ministry that
[29:11] women believed his message and were
[29:14] following following him around from
[29:16] place to place while he's preaching that
[29:19] was a big Scandal back then but Jesus
[29:23] had disciples and some of them were
[29:26] women and some of them were wealthy
[29:29] women and they support in this
[29:33] ministry and uh were there praise God
[29:37] because that time was a time when women
[29:39] were totally
[29:40] ignored they were totally ignored and
[29:44] plac in a corner but Jesus came on the
[29:46] scene and when he came on the scene he
[29:49] was the first to start ministering onto
[29:52] them amen amen he started ministering to
[29:57] these women
[29:58] and you know he healed Peter's
[30:01] mother-in-law you know he delivered the
[30:04] daughter of the cro fan woman from a
[30:08] demon you know he raised gyrus daughter
[30:12] from the
[30:13] dead you know that he healed the woman
[30:17] that had the hemorrhaging
[30:20] problem which she herself knew it that
[30:22] it wasn't right for her to even touch a
[30:25] man but nevertheless she believed he was
[30:28] Christ and she touched the H of His
[30:30] Garment and was made home now if God was
[30:34] against women then no woman would be
[30:37] healed none would be raised from the
[30:40] dead none would be delivered none would
[30:43] have a touch of his mighty hand amen but
[30:46] praise God forever more that is what he
[30:49] did Hallelujah he raised the wiow of son
[30:52] from they and also he was the one earli
[30:58] those days imagine it that he went to
[31:01] lazarus's house this was absolutely
[31:04] against the laws of the Jews to sit
[31:07] anywhere and to teach women the laws
[31:12] teach them the Torah and there he was
[31:15] teaching them the word of God thank you
[31:18] you just getting some insight why they
[31:20] call him a devil where they call him uh
[31:23] crazy they call him you know the and
[31:27] everything else because he was
[31:29] shattering the corse of their
[31:32] culture he was breaking the laws that
[31:37] were made by man and set place but it
[31:41] wasn't God's way because he was God in
[31:44] flesh amen and God in flesh came down
[31:48] and there he was uh showing his Val for
[31:52] women amen because a man he says it's
[31:57] not good for to be
[31:59] alone is that right Hallelujah God made
[32:04] Adam and then God split
[32:09] the and
[32:13] God it's the truth brother the Adam now
[32:18] you know there was Adam and there was
[32:22] Eve visually you see two persons but God
[32:25] said and he called their name ad Adam so
[32:29] the two made One MH is that right and
[32:34] now when we marry the two shall become
[32:37] one is that right y that means that a
[32:40] man is not complete within
[32:43] himself
[32:45] unless he has some woman in his life
[32:49] right praise the Lord I left that wi
[32:52] open to say a woman is like it could be
[32:55] his mother right but he had has to have
[32:58] some complimenting uh Womanhood in his
[33:02] life to uh polish off and to uh bring
[33:08] out certain
[33:09] potentials and certain emotions that he
[33:12] didn't even know he had is that right
[33:15] because it's all buried there so it
[33:17] takes a woman to bring out certain
[33:19] things from a man and enrich a man's
[33:22] walk in a man's life praise God of
[33:24] course we know we have the other side
[33:27] you know he says bad woman is like water
[33:29] in a man's blood that will weaken him
[33:31] and totally destroy him amen but he
[33:35] talks about a good woman is
[33:38] priceless and more so in today's world
[33:41] when you look around and see what is
[33:43] calling themselves a
[33:47] woman is that right oh yeah now you see
[33:51] your value is even
[33:53] increasing because it is becoming rare
[33:57] now now to go out there and even find a
[34:02] [Music]
[34:04] virgin because they're starting out uh
[34:08] life 9 10 I don't know wherever they
[34:12] just start like that and they have no
[34:15] real value of how prous they are right
[34:19] and what they value really in the world
[34:21] because Satan through his wickedness his
[34:24] Corruption of the human race has never
[34:28] valued Womanhood that's
[34:30] right until a women some women feel
[34:34] themselves of no value but brothers and
[34:37] sisters especially you sisters carry
[34:39] yourself with great
[34:41] pride I realize that you are of Great
[34:44] Value and dignity in this world and if
[34:48] nobody else values you God values you
[34:51] the brothers in this church have been
[34:53] taugh by the word
[34:55] God Amen if brother you sit there and
[34:59] you don't value your wife go back and
[35:02] take an account of yourself and of the
[35:04] word of God and B them with all your
[35:07] heart to the glory of God amen amen
[35:12] hallelujah praise God listen Jesus and a
[35:17] lot of women disciples women followers
[35:21] they learned from him and with him
[35:23] traveled with him at times supported him
[35:26] financially and then and you know the
[35:28] story of how he said I must needs pass
[35:30] through Samaria go sits on the well and
[35:34] and sits on the well and according to
[35:36] the time it was towards like 6:00 in the
[35:38] evening when it's just Twilight time
[35:40] getting dark and light when these uh men
[35:44] go to pick up
[35:46] prostitutes that was a time and there he
[35:50] goes and sits on the b a young man 31
[35:54] years old the prime of his life and he
[35:57] sits on a well that time of the
[36:00] evening and he knows that that's the
[36:03] time when the women will go there to get
[36:06] water from the well right they don't go
[36:10] during the daytime as mainly in the
[36:11] evening then they would go so what's his
[36:14] purpose in going to this well to meet a
[36:17] woman you know see we don't know but we
[36:20] know that he was going to meet one
[36:23] particular woman he had and when he met
[36:26] the woman uh you know it sounded to her
[36:30] like this young man is making a move on
[36:32] her and
[36:34] said get get me some water to
[36:39] drink and you know what the scripture
[36:41] says she says why why would you a Jewish
[36:45] man you know speak to you speak to me as
[36:49] a amican woman what do you want with me
[36:51] in other words I know what you
[36:54] want and he says no no no no no he said
[36:57] says uh that water I can drink it and
[37:00] you know you drink it you'll be thirsty
[37:01] again but the water I want to give you
[37:03] you'll never thirst again amen says go
[37:06] bring your your husband you know the
[37:08] rest of the story have he says you spoke
[37:10] the
[37:12] truth because you had five but the one
[37:15] you're living now with is somebody
[37:18] else's hbal right that's why I come here
[37:21] to stop you cuz you're an elected
[37:24] seat and you were in my permissive will
[37:27] you're going down there doing that with
[37:30] single man but when you hit this now
[37:31] you're going into a married man there
[37:34] you're crossing a line a River of No
[37:37] Return so I come to stop him and you
[37:39] know the rest of it you know course she
[37:43] said he was just a Jewish man then the
[37:44] next thing you was you know I perceive
[37:47] you the prophet and and then later on
[37:49] she says is not this the Christ look how
[37:52] how how how her soul be opened up like a
[37:55] flower to receive the word of God
[37:57] Hallelujah from a man to a prophet to
[38:00] the Christ Hallelujah she caught the
[38:03] revelation of who he was amen and then
[38:06] it changed her life completely thank you
[38:08] and she repented and Dr home and as she
[38:12] was running home praise God forever more
[38:14] as I preached it some years ago she
[38:16] started to wipe the lipstick from off of
[38:18] her
[38:20] lips
[38:21] Hallelujah my God she started putting
[38:24] out a lot of the stuff she had in her
[38:26] hair that was for ction of man and all
[38:28] this stuff and thr It On The Ground all
[38:31] the Mars of a prostitute and everything
[38:33] she had she begin to rip it off and
[38:35] throw it off like like martinus after he
[38:38] was healed he throw off his diry Rags
[38:41] amen and that's what we all have to do
[38:44] off the dirty
[38:46] rags off the dirty rags that you may be
[38:49] wearing now and look to the Christ of
[38:52] God rep that turn of God and let him
[38:55] have his way in my lives for his amen
[38:58] praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen
[39:01] praise God hallelujah now we know women
[39:04] usually ignored by the culture can I pr
[39:06] some
[39:07] more usually ignored by the
[39:12] culture of that day and even in our
[39:16] day we don't want to go into the
[39:19] statistics but you know that men are
[39:20] being paid more than
[39:22] women how many knows
[39:24] that and a lot of times the women are
[39:26] smarter than the
[39:29] men the men are just sitting in a big
[39:31] chair there director this and that woman
[39:34] is doing all the work right manager this
[39:37] and that the other of course I'm not
[39:39] saying all men are like that there some
[39:42] me a lot of capable men and they deserve
[39:44] their position and stuff but there's
[39:46] other ones that are just filling a spot
[39:49] just because they're a man and they hold
[39:51] that position and the woman uh woman's
[39:54] labor intelligence knowledge wisdom is
[39:58] the value and they don't see the real
[40:01] value to it uh they just want them to
[40:03] stay right where they are and pay them
[40:06] less than what you pay a man I believe
[40:08] in equal pay for equal
[40:11] work how many believes that amen praise
[40:14] the Lord hallelujah I don't want you
[40:17] Brothers raising your hand because your
[40:19] wife is going to see
[40:20] you right that you don't to leave in
[40:23] equal pay for equal work but the fact is
[40:26] if you should believe in equal pain for
[40:29] equal work praise the Lord hallelujah
[40:32] amen you know Paul said it in Christ
[40:35] there is no male and female is that
[40:38] right in Christ there is no male and
[40:40] female where it comes to that praise the
[40:43] Lord but we find out in Jesus's last
[40:46] hours it was mainly women that were
[40:49] there it was mainly women that was there
[40:52] it was one woman was at when Mary and
[40:55] others that were there around cross and
[40:57] even when he raised from the dead it was
[40:59] a woman that went there first is that
[41:01] right it was a woman that went there
[41:03] first praise God and thank God we have
[41:07] we have a a a preacher in this church by
[41:10] the name of Phillip there was one in the
[41:12] New Testament only difference is that
[41:14] one had3s or whatever that
[41:22] prophesied yes he's not going to go that
[41:25] far
[41:28] [Music]
[41:30] but the fact is 13 of them and each one
[41:33] had a spirit of Prophecy amen now some
[41:36] of the churches don't believe that
[41:38] Spirit should is even operating on
[41:41] anybody for that matter and some don't
[41:42] believe it operates on women it only
[41:44] ought to be on men but God's spirit God
[41:47] is not a god of partiality he sends his
[41:49] rain under justly unjustly the grass the
[41:52] weed and the wheat and everything
[41:55] amen what what you do with it is what
[41:58] he's going to be looking at praise the
[41:59] Lord right amen but the fact is God is
[42:02] ready to anoint everybody that will
[42:04] surrender their Liv and service to him
[42:07] praise the Lord glory to God I'm not
[42:10] really preaching I'm taking my time and
[42:13] uh bringing this out so that you might
[42:15] benefit from it for the glory of God so
[42:18] we know that uh that uh the only people
[42:22] that never abandon the abandon the Lord
[42:26] right Peter you know how many knows
[42:28] Peter ran
[42:30] away how many knows Jesus said all all
[42:33] has forsaken me they all forsook him and
[42:35] fled everybody fled for their life
[42:38] praise the Lord but what happened Mary
[42:42] and other women stopped by him is that
[42:45] right and even though they were looked
[42:48] upon as the least in society they were
[42:51] the first at that cross amen amen they
[42:55] were right there with the word
[42:58] and to this day women was still number
[43:00] men in the
[43:03] church you noticed that right even to
[43:07] this day women of numbered men in the
[43:10] church because they have that uh pension
[43:13] for that desire for
[43:15] Faith they really catch a general
[43:18] Revelation you can't take it out to them
[43:21] they hold W with an unchanging hand
[43:23] that's right amen praise God because God
[43:26] places in there amen glory to his
[43:28] wonderful precious name amen praise God
[43:32] Amen yes sir
[43:35] Hallelujah God of course proclaimed the
[43:39] resurrection to the rest of the
[43:40] disciples it was a woman that brought
[43:43] the first resurrection message of course
[43:45] she's the type of the church that wants
[43:47] to carry the resurrection message and is
[43:51] carrying the resurrection message
[43:54] Hallelujah but you see God always and
[43:58] simplicity and reveals himself in the
[44:00] same and he chooses the weak things of
[44:03] the world right and the foolish names of
[44:07] the world to confound the
[44:10] wise amen and those that believe that
[44:14] they're strong Hallelujah if you go to
[44:17] the book of Acts we know that up in the
[44:19] upper room there wasn't men alone so
[44:23] obviously the disciples had caught on to
[44:25] Jesus's teaching
[44:28] because
[44:29] really men and women should not be in
[44:32] the one room worshiping or praying or
[44:34] reading scriptures or anything like that
[44:37] so but when you read the book of Acts
[44:39] you find
[44:40] out Mary and other women were in that
[44:44] room in that upper room and I've been in
[44:48] Jerusalem and we've been to the upper
[44:50] room those of us who been there we've
[44:51] been to the upper room it's not a big
[44:54] huge room the room may be about uh a
[44:58] third of the size of this Sanctuary here
[45:02] so that you you can imagine 100 of them
[45:04] and they were close uh close together
[45:07] all praying and shouting and praising
[45:10] God and stuff like that but the
[45:12] disciples had caught the
[45:14] Revelation and so women were permitted
[45:17] to be with them praise the Lord who can
[45:20] find a virtuous woman and for price is
[45:24] far above rubies today amen God is
[45:29] looking for women of virtue
[45:32] today and like I just said the it it's
[45:36] very rare and hard to find women of
[45:39] virtue
[45:41] today cu the devil saw the valued
[45:45] Womanhood until like I repeat men hardly
[45:50] can value their
[45:51] lives the way they really
[45:55] should glory to God
[45:58] Jesus said the Earth come when the true
[46:00] worshippers shall worship the father in
[46:03] spirit and in truth for the father
[46:05] seeketh such to worship him praise God
[46:09] hallelujah we need a lot of women that
[46:12] will make a difference in this hour what
[46:15] am I saying sisters you need to step
[46:17] up you don't need to step back in the
[46:21] shadows right forget it even if Brothers
[46:25] in the message are preaching it like
[46:26] that you need to step back in the
[46:28] shadows and and just be there no you
[46:31] need to step
[46:33] up God did not place you on the man's
[46:38] head to rule over
[46:41] him neither did he place you under the
[46:43] man's feet to be a this that he can step
[46:49] on but he took you from the man's side
[46:53] so that you would stand beside himen and
[46:56] be
[46:57] M that's there to help or a help me and
[47:01] that is where the woman's placing is to
[47:05] Stand By Your
[47:06] [Music]
[47:12] Man I know sometimes I say things but uh
[47:15] Stand by Your M brother puts it away and
[47:20] the bright
[47:21] Stand St with the word stand by the word
[47:25] amen amen standing the promises of
[47:27] Christ your king Hallelujah what's the
[47:30] right
