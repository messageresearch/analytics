listening in online father there's no distance with your spirit may you go and minister in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you Saints let's um let's go to the word this morning let's go to our first scripture amen this morning we're going to talk about your true identity amen your true identity um this is a day day where identity crisis is in fullblown uh turmoil amen people just are are being bombarded left right and center and uh many people can't even identify who they are anymore and this is the age that we're living in we're going to be reading from First Corinthians chapter 13: 9-2 for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away we believe that we're living in a day where that which is perfect is come that which is perfect is Jesus Christ the word it is prophesied for this day that the word would be fully restored amen amen and we have received that that word we've received that message and we know now that the day that we're living in is going to give us more than just Christian uh doctrines or theology or churchgoing but that which is perfect is come and then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child and I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known you may be seated the Lord add His blessings to the word of God Amen praise God you know one day a famous preacher was visiting a nursing home where some patients with Alzheimer's lived and he went around and he was greeting the people who were in The the nursing home and they were very glad to see him because he was a famous preacher and he walked up to one lady and asked hello do you know who I am and she turned around and looked at him and she says well if you go to the front desk the lady there will tell you who you are you see sometimes it's not just people that are experiencing Alzheimer's that forget their identity it's Everyday People it's Christians it's those that are you know living for God and believing that they're living for God and and identifying themselves as Christians but not recognizing that they've actually lost their identity they've lost their Oneness their their their their pure relationship with God because to truly know God will truly bring you into a place where you know who you are amen and so um maybe we're under a delusion of mistaken identity maybe uh you know like the world right now uh one of the the biggest um thefts that's taking place right now is identity theft it's a proven fact and um you know uh stolen identity is an enemy it's something that steals things that are important to people you could even say that we have we've participated in a form of identity theft our god-given identity can get lost or stolen by our enemy who comes to kill and to steal and to destroy Satan's goal is to destroy your ability to know who you really are you know American adults lost a total of $43 billion to ident theft and fraud in 2023 and it's growing it's getting worse that includes 23 billion lost to traditional identity fraud which affected about the same number of people 15 million in 2022 when the number was 15.4 Million but total losses grew by 133% last year according to a report it's it's it's it's an identity crisis okay one-third of adults in America have experienced some level of financial identity theft we're talking $43 billion in Theft that's just a type and and and billions of people it's just a type showing how many Christians these days and the number of so-called Believers of God that their true identity is being stolen today you can identify yourself with anything you can identify yourself with any gender you can identify yourself with an animal or anything just as long as the enemy can get you into a state of deception where you don't identify with the word that's what the enemy is trying to do and that's why we're in such a condition where the world is is uh is totally uh lost and and and mental health is at levels like have never experienced before people are losing their minds which is in direct correlation with losing losing your identity when you identify yourself with the word it gives you a foundation it tells you who you are it tells you where you came from and it tells you where you are going when a person has balance in their lives where they know who they are they know where they came from they know who their parents were they know where they're going they 've got goals they've got passions they've got uh a a destiny in their hearts and in their minds on what they want to accomplish they're on a mission they're more positive they're more focused they can see the future they can see that they have a future but let me tell you in a world like today where the world is complete in total chaos where Wars are breaking breaking out and things are at the worst that they've ever been they are worse they are worse today than they were last Sunday all you need to do is look to see what's going on with God's time piece which is Israel Israel is God's time piece you can go back and study the history of Israel you will see that it lines up with many different world events everything surr founded Israel the World War II the World War I the World War II 1948 when Israel became a nation taking back its Land showing that God was restoring his people we know that it's a terrible thing to see what's going on to see these wars and the numbers of people that are being destroyed and killed but yet we cannot deny the word of God and the prophecy of God's word god has identified that Israel are his chosen people it was them that he gave the land to regardless of what anybody else says you cannot change the word of God don't argue with me you need to search the scripture and you need to see what the word of God says about Israel and about all of the other nations that surround it amen we cannot change God's plan amen glory to God some of the uh identities that we can draw from the Bible because we are today we're going to look at you know finding our identity and solidifying our identity and seeing what the word says about us so that we can have Victorious lives in Christ so that we don't have to get caught up into the identity crisis where we don't know which church we should go to I mean listen this identity crisis it's it's it's really uh affecting all of the churches because there's so many Christian so-called churches out there how do you know which church is the right church because you've got so many different doctrines and teachings on the word of God well if you've been listening to what is ministered from this Pulpit week in and week out we don't bring our own interpret word of God the word of God is of no private interpretation amen it is very important to lay out the foundation that the word is God's interpretation and God interprets his own word individually to individuals and you need to not uh identify yourself as a member you need to identify yourself as a son or a daughter of God that's what the true church is made up of not members the moment you identify under membership then you come under man's doctrines man's teachings and all of a sudden it's what the priest says or what the pastor says or what the bishop says or what the Pope says it is none of those it is what the word says amen and that's why we will always we will always bring you back to the word that is the foundation of your experience and so when we identify from the word we've got some scriptures here that we can identify it says in 1 Corinthians 6:17 that we're identified and Sanctified in Christ we're chosen we're holy we're blameless and we're Beyond reproach based on Ephesians 1 for Colossians 1:22 Justified and righteous according to Romans 3:24 liberated and free according to Galatians 2:4 51 accepted forgiven Ephesians 1:6 and 7 we are his possessions Isaiah 43 and we are complete and perfect in Christ amen these are the things that we can these are just a few examples from the scriptures that we can identify ourselves by the word of God when you place the word as your identity it places you into a completely different circumstance now your life is not being controlled by how they want to identify you or how somebody else identifies themselves but it's how the word identifies you and how you identify with the word amen praise God Colossians 2:10 we're hidden in Christ Colossians 3:3 don't uh uh we're hidden in Christ sorry so what's happening the enemy is stealing our personal identities this is how the devil wants the people of God today he wants to steal your identity if he can steal your identity he can kill your joy the moment that you're not sure of who you are you start to lose the joy of your salvation the Devil comes and you know starts bombarding your mind look at this situ situation look at this that's going on in your life see you call yourself a Christian and this and this situation is in your life those are lies of the enemy he's trying to he's trying to get you to identify with the circumstances instead of identifying with the word and the promises of his word amen the Bible says in John 10:10 the thief cometh not but to for to steal and to kill and to destroy amen the devil knows your identity is the key to your Victory he knows that if you can get to a place where you know who you are and you stand on that promise of God's word and you don't move off of that and you regardless of the circumstances you stick to the promises regardless of how long it takes When you pray you wait on God you don't you don't you don't Place time as a a prerequisite to God's promises God is God is eternal amen God he says I knew you before you even came to this earth he knows all that you have need of Amen you can keep to his promised word and you can just stand and know that he is God Amen praise God hallelujah we got so many people these days billions of people identifying themselves with everything except Christ it's a total mess amen they want to put their their their their future into science they want to believe in science they want to believe in in in the teachings of of uh of Darwin that that we evolved from from from some amiba some sort of tadpole and then you know contined to evolve and evolve and evolve if you are a son of God you always were a Son of God Amen there was never a time you were not a son of God you came from God you got to go back to God time is only in this Dimension but when we break out of this Dimension by the rapture we will not be in time anymore we will be exactly who we've always been Hallelujah to identify with Jesus Christ is life and to identify with anything else is death it's as simple as that we want to know our true identity today thank amen praise God and death is what separation from God amen hallelujah oh you can be religious you can claim you know you can claim that you believe Jesus Christ is your savior but your life will reflect exactly what you actually believe when you go to somebody and you tell them about Jesus Christ being God that Jesus Christ is God that he is the word that was from the beginning that he was the self-existent one like we we brought on Wednesday night we got into the godhead and we talked about you need to know who you're worshiping amen if you don't know God how can you possibly worship him you know not what you worship you're worshiping a Doctrine you're worshiping a man-made teaching you need to know him in the power of his resurrection amen glory to God you can't believe God unless God unless the word is revealed to you this is the Paradox this is where we're going to be going now because without the foundation of knowing that listen you can CL oh I want to know God I want to know God if you really want to know God then pay attention today amen because God has a provided way of coming to him of of of approaching in him you must approach him with humility you must approach God and and and say Lord I know nothing I know nothing you need to teach me what I need to know man's Wisdom is foolishness unto God so don't rely on any man's Wisdom relying on the power of his resurrection amen praise God and so today the Lord Lord wants you to know who you really are he wants you to identify yourself as either a son or a daughter not a member not a churchgoer not somebody that shows up to church more than anybody else it's not about how often you come to church it's not about how how how many works you do it's not about how much money you give a lot of people will join these big churches where there's thousands of people so that they can hide in the crowds so that they don't have to identify fully that they serve Jesus Christ as their lord and their savior you need to Bear the reproach for this word amen praise God and that's not easy to do you'll be rejected from your friends from your family because you stand solely on on the word of God but let me tell you as everything is starting to come down all around us and this world is falling apart let me tell you they're watching you they're watching your attitude they're watching how solid and how steady you are with your testimony they're watching to see if you're going to if you're going to submit or bow down to the enemy that's trying to steal your identity but how's it all start how does this relationship with Christ start it starts with the one question that Jesus asked in Matthew chapter 16 and verse 15 he said unto them but whom say ye that I am this is the question that that I am posing to each and every individual that's an earshot of this word this morning you need to ask yourself when Jesus asks you the question who do you say that I am do you have the right answer do you really know are you going to put him into a a a teaching of Jehovah Witness where he's a mighty God but not the almighty God are you going to put him into a trinity where he is just the son and then there's another father and then there's another Holy Spirit how are you going to place him are you going to place him as oh he was a a great Master at one time upon the Earth or are you going to say like Peter when Jesus looked to him and said Gabriel whom say that I am when he looks at you individually what is going to be your answer is it going to be like Peter's answer let's listen to the prophet here Peter when he called said Thou Art now this is Peter speaking this is from Christ the mystery of God revealed 1963 William Brandon he says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God now watch blessed art thou Simon barjona this is Jesus responding back he says which means son of Jonah see he knew who he was and when Jesus asks you that question and if it strikes your soul this morning it's because he's speaking to youen if it's just another sermon oh Pastor Danny is just preaching another good sermon sounds good no if it's striking your soul this morning is because he's interested in you amen it's because he wants to communicate with you he wants to identify himself with you we're looking at your true identity this morning we're going to go a little deeper than you know we've heard all these scriptures we've read all these scriptures but we want to go a little deeper this morning to to see if our identity is really with Christ and he says here blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah blessed art thou for Flesh and Blood never revealed this to you so it's not something that you were taught it's not something that you were you know that you learned in school who Jesus was because he's asking that question it's not some Jesus is making it clear no man Flesh and Blood no no man can teach you who God really is who Jesus Christ really is but he says here you never learned it from some school but here's you know where a lot of people get confused when Jesus says but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this unto you and right away they say see there's the Trinity now there's the father who's in heaven and Jesus the son who's on Earth no the word was made flesh God made himself a human vessel that would have to go to Calvary to fulfill his word amen I'll go one step further to say that you when you receive the word of God in your life you become God manifested in the day that you're living by you identifying with the word thank you you're starting to reflect the word when you were when you say I got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in a tank buried in water you are actually saying acts 238 you are reflecting you are manifesting you are materializing the word made flesh so it's all Elohim the self-existent one it's all God reflecting himself through each attribute that manifests on Earth at certain times and periods we're going to look deeper into that but just going to throw that in there so Jesus Christ was God the word Emmanuel means god with us and when he said the father hath revealed it he's talking that I have revealed this by the self-existent almighty spirit of God my thoughts can be expressed into your thoughts amen and I can reveal myself directly to you that's why he said Thou Art the Christ the the anointed one the Messiah the Messiah of the Old Testament was Isaiah that said on unto us a son is given his name shall be counselor the Prince of Peace the Everlasting father so if Jesus is the Everlasting father then why can't he be almighty God he is almighty God so here now he's saying my father so I have revealed this to you notice what he said to him Upon This Rock okay that's Peter the predestinated seed Peter the word Peter means Rock but it's not upon Peter that he's going to build the church it's upon the way he communicated who he was to the individual that's how he's building and identifying his church and so he says here Upon This Rock that's Peter the predestinated seat of God that had received his light and and given the keys to the kingdom Peter's given the Revelation so that he can live the Revelation and he says Upon This Rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ is it's Revelation in other words it's God's thought being delivered into your mind of who he is simp simple as that and then all of a sudden you see it as clear as a bell and now you're no longer confused about Trinity you're no longer confused about Mighty Almighty you're no longer confused about a great master or a Buddha or a whatever other te no you've come into a complete and total clear identity of who God is and he says now he is the full manifested God Upon This Rock not a father not a son not a Holy Ghost and him being the second person Upon This Rock I'll build my church he says no upon the Revelation and the Gates of Hell will never shake it down never Prevail against it see he says I'll build my church Upon This Rock a revelation of Jesus Christ look Christ in you makes him the center of Life of Revelation Jesus Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation so in other words when Christ is in you you start to manifest the word you can't help it when somebody says how you were baptized you go right to the word Act 238 repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the spirit of God the Holy Ghost and if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken you it'll translate you out of this Dimension and you will be identified with the Rapture see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ everything you read from Genesis all the way to the last chapter of the Book of Revelations is talking about Jesus Christ the Messiah the Lord the Mighty God he said beside me there is no other sin savior there's nobody else that you must identify with in this day and in this hour if you are going to escape what this world is now barreling into 10 years ago we weren't even like you wouldn't even imagine that Israel would be in such a condition like like it is right now where every front and you pay attention and you listen to their talk listen to Benjamin Netanyahu listen to their previous president listen to the way they talk they will never bow down they will defeat the enemy yes all that they're saying is like we as Christians we will never bow down to the enemy we will never allow him because remember Israel is a type of the spiritual Church Israel is the natural Church the the Gentile church is the spiritual church when you see Israel in battle you can rest assure that the church is truly in battle if you're not in battle right now I don't know which church you belong to it's not easy to stand in this day and in this hour on this particular word where we stand fully on the word of God we do not compromise God's word Israel says they will be destroyed the enemy will be destroyed they will stop the heads they're not talking about all those innocent men women and children they're talking about those those powers and principalities and and hierarchies that have nothing in mind but the destruction of Israel and you know what that's the Devil he's the same devil that's has that that we talked about here in in St John 10:10 that has no other plan but to destroy to annihilate and to wipe out the Sons and Daughters of God you are the enemy's Target but greater is he that is in you you see the moment that you've identified with Christ it's no longer you that has to fight the battle you yeah you're you're dealing with the circumstances yes all those things that are going on I'm dealing with stuff you're dealing with stuff I'm talking serious stuff that we've got to deal with in this life but greater is he we know that he started a work in in our lives he's going to finish that work if you believe this word you will not you will not look to the left you'll not look to the right you'll just stand Christ in you made makes you the complete listen what he says here Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see you see what God is trying to do we're talking about your true identity this morning it's a simple message but I want it to go deep I want you to think I want you to think about your experience I want you to think about you know those that are out there online that are that are attending church every Sunday and you know just doing it out of tradition I want you to look a little deeper because things are starting to come down situations are starting to happen on on the world scene and you need to be prepared for what's coming and if you're not sealed in Christ if you're not identified with Christ then something other than a Rapture is going to take place in your life it's going to be a Great Tribulation it's going to be worse than it's ever been Jesus said worse than it's ever been Hallelujah let's read the next scripture Ephesians 2:1 19-22 listen here these are the this is how we identify you are therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but your fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God this is who you identify with and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone this word the Old Testament every chapter every book every line is the foundation of the body of Jesus Christ the fullness of the body of Christ and we are members of that body in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit so when you receive this word when all of a sudden you go deep you answer that question where he says who do you say that I am you start a journey you start a journey of getting to know who you are and getting to really know who he is go to the next scripture and hath put now listen when you're into that body and you know who you are you need to understand that and have put all things under his feet he's talking about Christ and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all the body of Christ filth all in all everything that is against the word are under his feet and if you are in the body they're under your feet you become identified with Christ listen here he says now in Christ The Mystery of God uh revealed now notice god making himself known not we're not supposed to make converts to Christianity by a government but by Revelation if you're coming into the body of Christ if you're going to identify yourself with Christ you can only identify by Revelation not membership remember that this is not about joining Good Neighbor Ministries every church is going to have three kinds of Believers in it every Church there'll be a make believer there'll be an unbeliever and there'll be a True Believer in every church but if you're going to be coming in and being in a True Believer it's only going to be by Revelation no other way the Christ in you you as God was in Christ as God was in Christ Christ in you when what God did in Christ Christ does in you let me repeat that as God was in Christ Christ in you what God did in Christ Christ does in you what signs did God in Christ Christ Christ does in you oh it's it's that beautiful oh my I like that Jesus said at that day that's this day at that day when this Revelation is made known you will know that I am in the father and the father in me and I in you and you in me when the Revelation is made manifest at that day ye shall know that I sorry I had a thing come up on my fer and it covered when this Revelation is made known you will know that I am in the father and the father in me I in you and you and me when the Revelation is made manifest at that day ye shall know that I and the father are one I am in the father and the father is in me me he's making it very clear here then when the re when the Revelation comes forth then then it's I in you and you in me there you are amen Ephesians chapter 1 22 to 23 he's put all things now listen see continuing now you see down Through the Ages we started off from the foundation from the the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete seed then it come out through the feet Luther come back out then through Wesley then into the Pentecostals the tongues in the lips see now it's in the eyes the prophetic of Malachi 4 okay and you need to understand Malachi 4 was a prophet to the 20th century William Branham that's why we quote from William Branham that's why people quote from Martin Luther that's why people quote from John Wesley that's why they quote from Wigglesworth that's why they quote from all kinds of different reformers well William brandham was the last reformer in the form of a prophet that restored the fullness of the word of God Amen he fulfilled Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's nothing else left for it to come but himself to step into that because that's the last thing there is the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own it's his we have no sight of our own how can a man foresee those things he can't do it it's God himself see it's becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through than the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adam did at the beginning like Adam was rather at the beginning and so the church that is identifying herself with Christ is a church that is the word church she cannot identify with the way the world is identifying Christianity she identifies by the word of God she will not let the teachings of this world and the and the doctrines of man identify her with the word of God she can only identify with the groom which is Jesus Christ the groom and the bride amen praise God 1 Corinthians 12:27 now you are are the body of Christ and members in particular every single one of you once you identify yourself with the word of God you come to realize that you have a place in the body you have a position in the body you're not just a church member you're an active living walking Messiah you're a walking Christ you're anointed Ed by the word of God you're not living a normal life anymore you're living a life that's Supernatural all the things around you though they they appear natural but there's a supernatural element that's walking with you that's moving around your life that's taking you deeper into the word of God that's causing you to go deeper into Christ when you look at the conditions of the world it causes you to go deeper to really know that you know that you know amen that you truly can identify yourself as a son or a daughter of God not just identifying yourself as a church member amen praise God listen here brother Bram speaking in the choosing of a bride the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the body now he's talking about the church we're talking about here when you answered that question and you said Thou Art the Christ you know now who he is you know now who you are you actually received his word and you were pregnated by his word that's why many Christians at the end are going to come and say Lord Lord uh did I not cast out devils in your name that I not uh do these things lay hands on the sick Jesus is going to turn around and say I never knew you that's scripture what does he mean by that they never received his word they never answered that question they weren't willing to accept his word into their hearts and therefore by being accepting that word you are birthed into the mystical Body of Christ you experience a new birth you experience a new life Everything Changes you're you're no longer the same people look at you and say what's come over you it's because you've accepted the word and you're now living a life that's that's that's overtaken you it's the Life of Christ the word of God so watch he says the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the bride is the only church that goes in the Rapture because it is the body of Christ we are making up that body the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man in a woman is one and Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body like Adam in the Garden of Eden Eve was taken from his side Adam was in the image of God he was God on Earth and God wanted to express himself as a family so everything that he had in his mind he was expressing it through Adam and when he took Eve from his womb that's why she's called womb man she came from the womb of the man it was God's female attributes being expressed into a separate vessel so that he could express family fellowship well he's doing that now remember everything is being restored back to that in order for the Rapture to be fulfilled and so like Adam and the two together makes the one body again so as you accept the word receive the word come into the church which is the body of Christ you become one with Christ and you become the church that goes in the Rapture it's simple but you need to go deep into your thoughts and into your experience and into your identity amen so like Adam was at the beginning man his wife are one now she the true bride Soul sold out to him is not going to identify with the way the world wants you to identify Christianity Trinity all these different doctrines and you've got all these different denominations that's why the true church the bride of Christ will only look at the word she'll only look at her experience to see if it lines up with the word if baptism is in jesus' name and somebody says how are you baptized I was baptized in Jesus name according to the word because the word can never go against itself Jesus said I'll send you the comforter which is the Holy Ghost which is his Spirit that's why he says on that day you shall know that I am in the father ye in me and I in you that Spirit In You it'll only identify with the word and so your baptism will be identical to the word oh no but I got baptized as a baby it's not in the word a baby doesn't believe a baby can't believe it's he that believeth and is baptized you see now you're in the body now you're identifying yourself you're you're your true identity now is with Christ it's with the body it's identifying with the word word and the word says in this day and in this hour there's going to be a Rapture to take the church out of the Great Tribulation everything else goes into tribulation for purging that's what salvation is all about salvation you talk about salvation that people want to know what what is salvation Salvation is is to be delivered from Death from what's coming on this Earth Hallelujah so she Soul sold out to him and she she used no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word amen hallelujah Ephesians 5:29 go to the next scripture says for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but Nour isth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church do you think for one moment God is not going to give you everything that you have need of in order to overcome whatever you're facing right now God he does not hate his body he loves and nourishes his body that's why you need to be in that body that's why you need to identify with the right Jesus there's there's a lot of jesuses out there that they're identifying him and and they're and they're placing him but they're not placing him right exactly where he's supposed to be God Almighty the word from the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen hallelujah and that same Spirit came back down on Pentecost which is Christ himself coming back into his church and then God sent us a prophet and then God s uh goes off takes his Prophet off the scene so that Christ himself in 1963 could come down to Sunset Mountain to say that he is now here to to to to meet with his body amen glory to God this is what we're all this is what we're talking about this is the Revelation that we are under this is what called us to this to this church to this body of Christ is because God has done something in our day and we've recognized what he's done it's when you can that's why our sign says come recognize your day and its message Christ is alive right now he's moving right now amen even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones listen if Jesus is on the Earth right now he's in you amen that's what the scripture says he's walking in you amen your bone of his bone your flesh of his flesh amen and the blood is the holy ghost that is in you that is that's what identifies us together that's why I can call you brother and sister in Christ because the same blood that operates through your body operates through mine what is that blood it's the blood of Jesus it's the spirit of the Living God Amen if the Same Spirit spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you it'll Quicken your mortal body Hallelujah glory to God Amen listen to brother brandom here the invisible Union but you remember when it went down and the grain begin to ripen that you find before that grain can ripen everything in that stock has to be dead listen we're living in a day where everything that seed is coming to a ripening time it'll only be the pure unadulterated seed word of God that is going to go in the Rapture remember if you are a son or a daughter of God you always were everything else around it all these all these Church ages all the churches through every age it was carrying the seed and in every Church age whoever was identified as the seed in that age just like when when Luther broke away from the Catholic church he was identified as the seed of justification he came out and he says wait a minute here the just shall live by Revelation he caught that Revelation he answered that question like you answered when he says who do you say that I am you see all of a sudden Luther realized that wait a minute it's not the way the priest is telling me I need my own experience with God and anybody that broke away with Martin Luther at that day they were the bride of Christ that had recognized their day and the message that God was bringing down as a part of the Reformation every age amen so what's happening now is that this church that we're talking about here that we identify our true identity is is is a a ripened matured body body seed word of God remember there was certain seed that fell by the street side and some got scorched by the by the world some got but then there was some good seed that good seed has continued that good seed is the word of God and that seed was in you before you came here and when the question was given to you who do you say that I am right away you looked and you had the answer you didn't realize that there was an attribute in you that had the ability to respond to that question and immediately you identified and you realized wait a minute this is who I really am this is who I'm supposed to be that's why when I was all messed up on drugs and and my life was a complete mess it like just like any seed the seeds got to be in the dirt and sometimes it's so surrounded by so much dirt that you don't see that there's actually a life in that dirt but the moment that the spirit of God called on that seed that seed had to come to life it had no choice listen anybody that's hearing this word this morning it could be all kind of scattered all over the place but if you're hearing something this morning you're hearing the voice of God calling you to the attention of his word in this day and in this hour something starts to pull on your heart you can't explain it but you just all of a sudden now you want to search the scriptures you're looking deeper into the word of God because something is calling you to to to something more something is delivering you all of a sudden the circumstances around my life I didn't understand it but I was coming to church with Gabriel i' go into the church I listen to the word of God and I couldn't understand it but something was pulling me out of that old life out of my own thinking of who God was and God was interpreting it for himself amen he was now calling his seed he was now placing it into the body of Christ and all of that seed is going into the burn remember we're at the end time Harvest but there's not too many workers out there that are preaching this word they want to preach a nice Jesus Loves You Jesus is there for for you I'm telling you all those same things but in such a way where you can know Jesus is with me Jesus is a reality Jesus is the word I I haven't bowed to a teaching of man I haven't I haven't compromised to identify myself with this gender or that gender I've identified myself with the word amen with the word this is what's going to take me this is what's going to restore me this is what's going to heal me this is what will take you out of your problems and your situations and the circumstances that you're dealing with right now it's him so here now he's talking about this seed everything in that stock had to be dead Hallelujah can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again it's back what is it just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground the same Jesus in The Bride form same power same church same thing same word the same word sucked up through these and come out here he's talking about the same word that come through that stock all through the Reformation ages how the life just kept moving through the stock how everything else had to fall away every every seed that was of God it that's why the church would keep putting the spirit out but the spirit would move on and go on to the next predestinated seed and that's why we're in the day that we are today and this is where it all finishes up the grain goes into the barn which is a type of the Rapture and everything else gets bound together for the Great Tribulation and it's going to be a fiery ugly tribulation those people that are in the Middle East that are seeing those bombs land in their backyard and seeing the destruction that's going on they they they couldn't have imagined that they'd be seeing those things but they are those people in the Ukraine that are experiencing thousands of people dying being blown up all the these bombs falling around them they would have never thought but it's happening Saints it's happening we're blessed to be here in Canada we're blessed to be in North America where there is no war we're blessed to be here right now but the scripture doesn't keep it this way unfortunately the whole world is going to go into World War I when God's his own interpreter I'm not going to put a time a date but if I was to look around and see some of the circumstances that are going on around us I would say you better look up and you better make sure you know who you're identifying with because whatever you identify with that's where you will stand on that day he says just exactly like the same grain the same word and all that life that come through here picked up its people now it's forming up into a head for the Rapture now it's coming together it's forming up into ahead for the Rapture praise God forever more as we wind this down 2 Corinthians 5:17 to19 it says therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creature I want you to know that you can change and your life can be transformed into a new that that word creature is creation your whole life can be transformed by the word of God old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ it's Jesus that's that's calling you that's reconcilia you that's that's bringing you back into into your your rightful position so that you can identify yourself in this day with the word of God and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation not only are you reconciliated into the body but he's given you the same work that as you go out there and live this word and testify and and tell people about Jesus Christ and what he's done for you you start to just like when Gabriel handed me that tape he didn't realize he was under the ministry of reconciliation just like when you testified to whoever you testify to and they're serving the lord today is because you were under that Ministry of reconciliation you become the body of Christ you become the living mystical body of Jesus Christ in the midst of the people and when Christ was on the earth not not everybody was responding to him but he went to those he says come follow me and the ones that he spoke to that were his sheep recognized his voice and they had to respond thank you Lord hallelujah so he's given it to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation in other words when he called you into this body he Sanctified you he justified you he wiped away all your unbelief if you're hearing this message this morning and you you you haven't fully identified yet with Christ I want you to know that if you identify with Christ if you're able to respond to this word and and identify yourself with this message you come in you get Justified as though your old life never happened in the first place that's the mystical a supernatural God that we serve he had to make a way for you to be a perfect bride without spot or wrinkle how's he going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle you see that's why you you look at you know you look at what you did last week you know you made mistakes you know you sin you know you lied you know you cheated you know you did certain things but Christ knew that and when he looked at you he was not looking at your sin he was not looking at your unbelief all the traps that the enemy set up for this flesh he was looking at himself the attribute the portion of himself that he placed in you that's why when Adam looked at Eve he knew that she had sinned he knew that that that she blew it so he knew that the only way that he could save her was to give his own life Adam knew exactly what he was doing when he went with his wife and partook of the unbelief but it was also that God could fulfill his plan of showing that Jesus Christ was going to come to th 4,000 years later to take on a human body because his Church Eve the body the C the the the the the Church of this day the Gentile Church of this day would be deceived you know that all would be deceived all a l l except those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life every churchgoer out there unless their name is in the Book of Life they're in deception it's I'm sorry it's the word it said all would be deceived except those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life you got to read the word you got to study the word and that's why if you're going to identify with the word then you need to know the word so you can properly identify where you stand amen and so Jesus Christ knew that he had to go to Calvary he knew that he'd have to die for your unbelief in 2024 he doesn't see listen if you've been called into this body I don't care how much unbelief was on this flesh he doesn't see it anymore and when you come to understand that and you you enter into that kind of a relationship with Jesus Christ you want to love him and you want to serve him with all that's in you because of that Mercy that he extended to you you want to give him your life you want to serve you want to obey the word you can't wait to get to that water and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins because when you get buried as an adult knowing that you that you sined that you were wrong that you made those mistakes you're confessing you're re that's what the word repent means to turn away from what you knew was wrong and bury it bury it so that you can come up brand new start a brand new life have a Victorious walk with God know that regardless of what takes place on this Earth regardless of what you see on CNN regardless of the outcome of the US elections regardless of the chaos that's going on in Israel regardless of what's taking place in the Ukraine regardless of the government of Canada and all the doors that they're opening up to same J samex genders and all these different Abominations of the word of God regardless of all of those things you're sitting in the body of Christ Justified you've identified with your true identity let the musicians come Hallelujah now if we are those attributes and things that are to be 1965 if we are those true attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by denom denominal denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the the the church the bride not a Creed not a denomination but a living Oracle of God remember God has given us the ministry of reconciliation people need to hear this word Jesus Cho chose the foolishness of preaching so that the foolishness of preaching could be could be uh sent forth and the word could go forth in this day and in this hour that's why it's so important that we understand that it's not just pressing play and listening to the tapes yes that is the word that is God's Prophet that is word that that's being fulfilled and God can speak to you through all of that but that doesn't put aside the five-fold ministry that has the ministry of reconciliation in her to speak the word so that the sons and Daughters of God wherever they are trapped can be set free it's not just preaching salvation it's preaching Deliverance it's preaching healing it's preaching uh uh giving you you know that the the Lord can give you back a sound mind amen praise God the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creator denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living in we are the last sign we're the last generation we're the ones that are going to close out the Gentile dispensation there's no other scripture after Revelations 21 where it says and the spirit and the bride say come we are that bride that's saying come if you really want to be identified with Christ you want your true identity then you need to come you need to identify yourself with the word not good neighbor Ministries not uh so and so Ministry down the street not this Baptist Church no Christ be identified with the word and the word is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah our next scripture as we close says see what great love the father hath lavished on us that we should be called the children of God and that is what we are and the reason the world does not know us is that they did not know him that when he asked that question who do you say that I am they couldn't respond because it was not given to them to respond it's a paradox but if you're able to respond this morning it's Grace it's amazing grace it's Grace Grace God [Music] grace with [Music] Hallelujah Grace that is greater than all our sins sing it again PR gra God's Grace Grace that will Parton and cleans with oh graise graise God grace is [Music] great is there anybody here this afternoon that maybe they haven't fully identified [Music] let's ask the Lord there might be somebody out there online that's heard this word here today they've been in a state of confusion they don't know how they've identified themselves but some clarity came today and they can now identify themselves as a son or a daughter of the Living God father you know every heart and every life and every circumstance that surrounds the people of God those that have heard this word here this morning Lord I did my best to deliver the thought that you placed upon My Heart Lord but I know that it's when you come and you
