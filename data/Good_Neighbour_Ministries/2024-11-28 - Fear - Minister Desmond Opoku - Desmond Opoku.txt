amen you may be seated for a while before we started we going to we going to uh look a little video about the report of uh what this little church is doing for the Kingdom of God in Ghana so we're going to show you some stuff and we talk about it what our pastor and the bre the church and his congregation doing for others for overseas just a letter report from Ghana praise the Lord hallelujah are you happy amen relax enjoy the presence of God take everything away from your mind the Bible say fear not little flog Hallelujah this is the building that our pastor God pleased in our pastor heart that is helping in Ghana be before I started to talk about this building some years ago as you all know we talk about it several times on the pulpit God laid in our heart me brother Kofi brother F we went to Ghana purposely for Ministry and God did a tremendous work that [Music] maybe maybe some of you here never see what God did before over there maybe some of you see some before we went there and we had a crusade in one night in my Village not only one Village we went about two Villages and then God came down mightly and perform miracle for my brother who has two strokes as I told told you before he couldn't walk and we pray for him and the Lord came down and healed him completely and he get up and walk the people over there never see such a thing in their life but there all there's all Christians there's Church there they go to church as we used to go to church by a normal church that's why I say sometime people never see this thing before but this is happening right now Hallelujah the Bible said the only the children of God will see it but you have to believe it Hallelujah and then when that thing happened the following day we baptize about 25 to 30 people and when we baptize them the cover came came and dismantle dismantled them because we said have a place where they have to worship and stuff like that and when Co came they cannot group anymore so all of them scattered then when I went just last uh after I went second time one day H in the Sunday I begin to I went out to find them to to have a fellowship I couldn't find no one so I was standing in the middle of the street and then I saw one and I said where is the arest I would like to speak to you you you brotherr here said some of them gone out some of them good they can't find them and he said we have a small group here so we want you to come and Minister Minister unto us so I went there and ministered to them and God came down and do a mighty work and it was fantastic so they took me to a place where they have started a church building that they did a foundation but there's not they don't have no strength it's about maybe eight or four seven people over there they have no place of wor they worship in a in a a a house where somebody have started and there was no nobody lived there so they just managed to get there and just put a couple chairs and sat down and worship so I went there and I I ministered to them and I they took me to this place and the Lord L when I came back here I spoke to Pastor Dany and uh we talk about it and he said we're going to help them so that they can have you roof on your head to worship you know brother Abraham said not God doesn't save anybody in One Church not a group God saved people by Jesus Christ hallelujah it's not a church that God is saving is saving you the people who are the church the people are the church amen hallelujah it's not a building so whatever you can do for for somebody it doesn't matter whatever whatever it is God plac in your heart to do don't differentiate oh this is not a message believer oh he doesn't go to my church so no God do something for God God knows who is going to be saved hallelujah hallelujah it doesn't matter did Peter know that he's going to be safe nobody don't know Peter going to be safe only the Lord Jesus Christ know Peter going to be his disciple he preached the word to them and they believe it and then they took off Hallelujah so everything that you do do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen not the church in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because God save us through Jesus Christ hallelujah it's not a church it's not a building so the pastor started and then we send them fans and while I'm going you can change the thing there so I came down I showed the picture and the Pastor said gave us a money and we we bought a a trip a two trips of uh death I think I show you this picture can you change the the next picture yes uh no not this one there's a different picture over there after yeah yeah this is the this is the okay this is the the iron rust that they use to build the pillars and then the lentil yeah when you finish the building back home we build a house with with the with the blocks so when you put the blocks over there you need a cement and then iron Rod to make the pillars in between so that you put the blocks in between so the pastor give us a money and then we buy the iron iron Ross and then they start taking the the Brocks can you have another picture there let's go another one this is the the okay and then he gave a that's the same time he gave us a money and they bought the cement and they they they made this blocks this is the blocks that is going to go in between the post of the pillage so we said the Pastor gave him the money and we sent them and they bought the cement and the sand that we we saw with they mix with the cement and then they make that blocks so after they make this blocks what they do then they going to put the blocks in between can you go to another picture there let's see exactly have you seen that you see the iron rods that's why it is so after that they put this they when they put the iron rcks with the pillars and they begin to put the the blocks in between them and this is what is going on now this is how far they've been going on now so with a with a a little money that the F that the pastor gave us I know I believe that through you without you the pastor don't have money to do this it's you congregation that put your offering and and everything your TI and everything and the Lord Place in the pastor heart to use it for the kingdom of God when you giving your money or your TI and offering don't think that you giving to a man your pastor God instructs him what to do with the money that you gave it to him so whatever you give is going to where the kingdom of God every little thing count every little thing count and I thank God for this little congregation this the congregation from years up to now something is going on this church never be a big church all the time small church but it does great things that the big church cannot do hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God do you know this year even this year that we put here where this originally come from he goes to the whole world from this church here hallelujah this church here through our former Pastor get inspiration and the brothers Inspire Inspire them and put this thing together oh glory to God aren't you happy amen we are happy this goes to the whole world nobody don't know it's come from from here nobody know this is not only church you have build in Ghana we build another church that's big now have full congregation that Pastor our former pastor we went with him and dedicated that church to the kingdom of God Amen and that didn't stop there our pastor came the work is still continue let's give the Lord a hand our God is good Hallelujah right now when I'm talking like I feel Goosebumps over my body because this is what God wants us to do she taking the world to the world taking the word to the world Amen Hallelujah and just not just only the the word alone it comes with f amen without F this one cannot be buil let there be a block the block cannot come like that you have a system that will BL the the the block can come through the system is the fans Hallelujah the F comes and then the blood comes and then the building comes and then the building of the sanctuary comes Hallelujah we are are happy to be in this little church is there anyone of let's go to another another thing yeah yeah this is this is where they put all of them now I think uh let's see let's it's a it's a it's a video I think now you're going to see there a lot of blocks that he putting together over there I think there's another one there this is the the the can you have another one that has yes you see the people there they are working on it you see how they working on it now it become before was nothing there but you see now it has become a sanctuary right now how far they after the blocks you know those iron rcks that we see we saw first those iron rolls when they when they reach a certain point they going to get a h uh a sheet of wood and they put them together how do they call it the forming huh form yeah where they going to form the box and they put that the iron rust around it and they put a concrete inside that is called lentil when they put that lentil there then they put a couple blocks then the roof come yes so right now it's heading towards the roof path it's heading toward the roof path so that's that's where they doing now and the the pastor the man that is the pastor that is a the minister that is taking care of his own man he loved the Lord every Sunday morning he calls me here and before I come to church he said let us worship a little bit he called me every Sunday morning over here in the morning before I come to church and you know what he tell me sometime Teach Me How To Worship teach me how to worship because our worship is real it's life liy wherever because when somebody this man is about maybe 70 or something years old this man be a minister for a long time and he asking me to teach him how to worship that mean he saw something that is a me that represent this church here that they never see over there and the the stuff that God did in that Village and the other Village he heard it so he knew that there's something around us that he craving for Hallelujah and not just him alone calls me he call me with his congregation he put the phone on the video and everything and the congregation is there let us worship a little bit Hallelujah so every morning before I come here I worship with them before I come here hallelujah so this this church here I believe it going to serve something I told them I said you know this church here it's not my church I don't have a church this is God church amen this is God church amen and the The Villages are run over there something is going to happen here and all the village around there they going to come there and worship amen you know when me and brother kof and brother F went there when those things happening when I went to the funeral just now I came back we were me my brothers and the elders we were all sitting there because he's part of my family my grand my grandfather's son this man we went to his house to pray for his daughter his daughter and when we went there there was his brother in-law in the room we didn't know when we finish our job we were going and they get together and call us me brother K and and told us that we have a situation here this man in the room for years sick so bad that he cannot die oh what is here just like that no eating nothing no food no water nothing he can't open his eye he he wanted to they want him to die because of this suffering or maybe something happened for him to wake up or something so they took me and brother Kofi and brother FIP inside the room my brethren it takes God people to go inside the room there me brother and brother went there if you go over there you're going to go like this but we are not thinking about that we were thinking about the soul of a man we we believe God sent us there purposely for that boy that boy gets sick instantly nobody don't know what kind of sickness they went to the doctors and everything they couldn't save that boy so me and brother KFI brother fre we sang a song that night we pray all all night we pray we pray we pray we pray we pray and we left as soon as we left the following morning the boy God took that boy home and when the the whole city heard it they were coming after me brother Kofi and brother pH and when they were ready to come they said they gone already Hallelujah my brother my sister God did great work over there it's not just one person the same thing happened to me and brother F the same time because that time kof was in arra we went back and another man was in the same situation he couldn't then they call us to that's why was in Kumasi we went there and we pray for him a couple days time he went through they couldn't die but I believe God wanted them to hear the voice of God before they go home Hallelujah at the same time too my friend that I work with him over here he called his daughter that we are there so he should come and see us before we leave Ghana that that lady married about almost 20 years they can't have a baby so they one night she came we open the Bible me and brother pH and brother Kofi we Minister we ministered to her and we tell her we told her what to do and after we pray for her and we came back 3 months later the father told me my daughter is pregnant Hallelujah the next time I went over there he brought the baby for me to dedicate that baby so the baby when I went just now the baby saw the baby doesn't go nobody as soon as he sees me he run to me like he knows me like years the mother is surprised he doesn't go Nobody But as soon as he see you he run Hallelujah and the boy name they name him Samuel Hallelujah glory to God love me tell you this gospel that we are in now don't joke with it it's real so this is the the the the what the project that is going on now right now in Ghana through our pastor let's just give a hand to our pastor thank you brother Dan for your great work but brother you are the leader that God inspire you they give not all the pastors will do like that some pastors take and they build themselves some pastors take and then they do the work of God so we thank God that God has a God God has given us a God-fearing Pastor man that is standing here for God he's doesn't he's not standing here for himself he's standing he's standing here for you your souls so what we have to do always as the children of God lift Moses hand to pray for him so that God can use him and Inspire him to feed our hungry Souls every day every night can you see
