church when the lights go out you know God orchestrated that but God had to have a willing vessel not one but he had two Hallelujah and all he had to do was plug in Church oh God wanted us to do last

that's standing in position and and and and I want you to know that last night you were a part of History amen amen hallelujah you were a part of something that has never taken place in church hallelujah what took place last night was only happening right here because you were here and now you have a testimony of what God did for you Hallelujah so we we just love God and we appreciate him so much for all that he's done if you have your Bibles amen let's go right into the word of God let's turn to first Samuel amen first Samuel chapter 17. first Samuel 17. first Samuel chapter 17. um let's start reading that verse 31. first Samuel 17 and 31. the Bible says if you haven't say man the Bible says and when the words were heard which David spake they rehearsed them before Saul and he went and he sent for him and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with the philistine and Saul said to David thou are not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his Youth and David said unto Saul the servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went after him and smote him and delivered it out of the mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and schmote him and slew him thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing that he have defied the armies of the Living God David said moreover moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the Paw of the lion and out of the Paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and Saul said unto David go and the Lord be with thee amen Hebrews chapter 11. Hebrews chapter 11. started verse 1. the Bible says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a great report through faith we understand that the words were the world was framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God and more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God has translated him for before the translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him that's his word God can't take that back seek Him diligently he has to reward you amen may the Lord bless you love his word you can have your seats let's get the Lord a hand clap of praise amen today by God's grace we want to put the nail in the coffin amen because we we we understand uh and I hope you understand that what God has been doing with us this weekend is something special you know and you have to take what God has done to the next battle amen and this morning by God's grace my subject is Faith by experience Faith by experience you know if we would just listen to you know some of the different things that you know the prophet of God said about faith first of all the Bible says faith is the substance of things hoped for so it's it's it's it's a it's a substance amen amen it's something that's obtainable it's something that's tangible hallelujah it's faith is not an imagination faith is something that can go and bring into existence that which you're Desiring but I want to say to you that that same Faith this morning can become an experience amen and once you have an experience with faith it'll work the same way every time once you meet those conditions because it becomes something that you know had taken place see David Hallelujah had faith in God but the faith that he had in God became a literal experience not once Hallelujah but twice and when he came when he came to the battle what was he coming with he was coming with an experience Hallelujah knowing that the same God that delivered me out of the bare hands the same God that delivered me out of the mouth of the lion is the same God that'll fight this battle for me Hallelujah and what I'm saying Church Hallelujah I know without a shadow of a doubt God gave somebody in this room and experienced last night Hallelujah come on somebody I know God gave you an experience and now you have to apply your faith to that experience and when the Devil Comes you say oh no oh no devil it's too late it's too late I know that my redeemer living Hallelujah it's too late hallelujah it's too late I've been touched by the hands of the almighty God see now what God is doing he's giving you an experience and once you get an experience the devil can't fight that oh Hallelujah see let's look at an experienced Churchill well let's back up to Faith amen the prophet of God when he began to talk about faith listen if I just take if I just take the word experience experience means proving what God was doing Hallelujah for us this weekend was proving himself Hallelujah we read about it we heard about it but then God came and made it a reality and we can leave this weekend saying I know God I know him I'm not a liar Hallelujah I know him I love him what he did amen it was something that became a reality Hallelujah God proved himself Hallelujah and if he has it to you today I challenge you to get out of your own way because he's real God is real the God we serve is not some God or the tombstone that can't talk he's not some some some pole with with ink drawn on his face that can't see he's real our God is a person he can talk he can touch Hallelujah he can respond to you Hallelujah oh my look Church the prophet of God said Hallelujah you can have a service and an anointing can fall in that service and you can come back to the next service and pick up the same anointing [Applause] let's pick it up let's pick it up today pick up that same time pick him up somebody grab hold of God pick him up with Jesus pick him up let's pick up that same anointing breaks jokes Hallelujah he said I'm the Lord thy God and I chase not [Music] see it's up to you and how much you hunger for the things of God listen let me say hello this morning the outcome of the service is not based upon how good I preach no Hallelujah it's based upon how good you pull you pulled I preached you pull I preach you pull up Prince Hallelujah God and you heard it God has given a gift but the gift belongs to you now you have to operate the gift if you want me to be a hammer I'll be a hammer you want me to be a sour I'll be assault hurry if you want me to be a magnet Hallelujah to those things that you can't quite reach I'll be your magnet this morning oh whatever you need for the job you have to pull for he said we have to believe that God is Hallelujah now you take that God is and put in behind that whatever you need God is a deliverer God Is A Healer God is a savior I'll say it again let's pick him up Hallelujah listen Church Faith experience experience is approved it's tried character that's what experience is hallelujah experience Hallelujah is a proof see when David Hallelujah got to Saul he was coming with proof see David had his papers in his hands David was a certified Giant Killer oh David had credentials amen he acted gentles that nobody has had honey David came before Saul and said hey let me tell you something about my life [Applause] let me tell you something about my life Hallelujah I'm a son of Jesse but I ain't like my brothers Hallelujah listen young people amen what separated David from his brothers he was a man of the God's very own heart a man that was willing to surrender Hallelujah his life for the Life of Christ amen now can you imagine Hallelujah that that that that that that that that David's own father didn't even believe in him go back and read your Bible which when when Samuel came to the house Samuel came Hallelujah with a message from God Samuel came Hallelujah with orders from God he said go down to Jesse's house because the next king is there Samuel came to Jesse's house with the anointing Hallelujah and Jesse Jesse didn't even believe in David he called all his other sons while David was out there with the Sheep but let me tell you something amen your parents your cousins your brother your sister may not know who you are but God knows who you are God knows who you are you are not forgotten Hallelujah in church he called all of his boys and Samuel pull the horn out and the horn wouldn't even move the anointing wouldn't even lose Hallelujah and then Samuel holy had to say to Jesse this boy is rejected go get another one this boy is rejected this boy is rejected this voice rejected and then God said okay Samuel that's what I want you to do I want to give you an experience don't look at his statue thank you the power of God is not worried about how big you are [Applause] the power of God is not worried about your skin color the power of God is not worried about your size or your weight totally the power of God is resting on how much you can believe [Applause] so he calls and he calls and he calls Hallelujah and then he says Samuel says hey he says Hey God told me to come here God put this together God told me to come here hallelujah and he said to him you got to have another son because God told me to come in and God doesn't miss and sir and Jesse Jesse says oh yeah I got one more and then Samuel says well go get him [Applause] go get him go get him go get him and you're the one God's been waiting on you're the one God's been looking for and God has come to get you out of the field and bring you into the house God is bringing you from out of the world from out of the field and he has the anointing waiting on you Hallelujah and Jesse couldn't believe it David comes in one thing about meeting God you may not be ready but God is [Applause] Hallelujah little church all the other brothers had a chance to take a shower wash up put their good clothes on David came fresh out in the field [Applause] Hallelujah I went to a service One Night in my heart just wasn't right Something's Gotta hold of me [Applause] think about it you just came to church last night not knowing earlier but God had the anointing waiting on you it was your time it was your day it was your moment and God was going to give you an experience that you leave Burlington with that'll change your life forever Hallelujah and you look Church David comes Hallelujah smell it like sheep College sweaty cold stinking but that didn't stop the anointing some of some of you came in Hallelujah with the smell of the world on you with the habits of the world on you thinking and seeing Hallelujah but that didn't stop the anointing from getting a hold of you that didn't stop the anointing from touching your life why because God had a purpose for you he had something he wanted you to experience Hallelujah and now David what I love about David Hallelujah David came in Hallelujah just because his father called him amen and this is real humility Man David didn't come in and said ah y'all thought I was left out but yeah he is David didn't come in all arrogantly Hallelujah because he got a gift of worship because he got a gift to sing or a gift to play instruments Hallelujah David came in with all humility walked in probably with his head down and Samuel said come here son Hallelujah and once Hallelujah he stood in place once he got in position Hallelujah God couldn't help God couldn't resist it God couldn't hold back no longer and was David got in position the anointing started to move it's starting to move Samuel Samuel said here it is here it is [Applause] [Music] and he started to pull the anointing I was saying last night I can't help but let it flow over you because you're in position once you get in position God has to do his part and you can imagine the brothers probably were sitting there like David has the anointing of prophets David has the anointing that comes from the prophet so David has the saith the Lord [Applause] we have the stand the love Church God was giving him an experience right there in front of his whole house but David wasn't arrogant amen once the anointing fail Hallelujah David probably didn't kick he probably didn't jump he probably didn't shout David was like thank you Lord we're back out to the field went back out to the Sheep now all of his brothers saw the anointing and what they didn't realize Hallelujah with that anointing God is preparing him for the battle to come the greater battle so why nobody else can see it God is developing a testimony in David's life Hallelujah a testimony by experience so what is experience holy let's look at experience you know you take the word doctor there's all kinds of doctors you take a dentist he's considered to be a doctor you take a heart surgeon he's considered to be a doctor amen you take a a preacher Holier who studied holy Theology and they also call him a what so you can have three men come in the room with the same title as Doctor but what separates them their experience Hollywood Hallelujah and you can only operate according to your experience no matter what your title is Hallelujah you can only be what you experience allows you to be let's just say Amen the dentist comes in one day and and the surgeon is there and the surgeon says to the dentist I am a doctor like you he said you know what I think I want to pull a tooth today cause I'm a doctor show me your instruments they might even have some of the same instruments and he can look at a scaffold and say that's a Skyfall and I said this you use this to cut with you use that in the pool with Hallelujah and he'll say okay well I think I'm ready to operate and the dentist will tell him oh no you don't have the experience Oh no you're a doctor you can't do what I do [Applause] you say you believe in Christ as a Baptist but you don't have the experience I have you say you believe in Christ as a Catholic but you don't have the experience I have Hallelujah so you know what that that the surgeon has to do that surgeon has to sit back and let the one with the experience Hallelujah go to work and you know what there are a lot of men who may have more Revelation to me but What Separates Me from them my experience [Applause] Hallelujah but you might say well brother I think I want to be the pastor in the church the only way you can be that is if God puts you in line to have the experience of a pastor Hallelujah knowledge is not it Hallelujah just you saying I got Revelation Revelation is the part of Faith he said faith is a revelation but what good is your faith with no experience Hallelujah and let's switch it around let's just say the pharmacist the pharmacist goes to the surgeon he says you know what a lot of times you guys you come Hallelujah and you send patience to me after you've operated and they have certain medicines and different things you know and I have to feel the prescription because of your operation and you know what the the pharmacist because he's a doctor he might say to the surgeon hey let's just cut to the chase I already know what they need so let me operate and you know what the surgeon will say the surgeon will say to him no your job is after our operation Hallelujah your job is not to operate your job is to comfort after I operate Hallelujah and one place in the message there was a person saying brother Branham I've been faster than praying and I just can't cast out this demon and he said sister you're supposed to fast and pray somebody else will cast out the deal Hallelujah see we operate by our experiences Hallelujah so you know you take all three of those men all of them got doctor on their name but they're all separated by the experiences in church I'll be one to say I know God Is A Healer why because I've had the experience I've had the experience yeah you know about cancer but that same experience carries me to the next battle Hallelujah I walked in the doctor's office because I had to renew my renew my license and I have a commercial driver's license which I'm not driving commercial but I keep the license if God gives you anything you keep it don't give nothing back to the devil you keep it unless God tell you to give it up you keep it whatever God gives you you keep it Hallelujah and I ain't drove a tractor in years but I still got an experience Hallelujah and I got the license to tell you that my license is better than yours Hallelujah they say well you I'm one of those people that could watch somebody driving and say they can't drive Hallelujah I can say that by experience cause my license says commercial driver's license professional truck driver my license don't cost fifty dollars it costs three thousand [Applause] [Music] but this what are you saying you don't know the cost of somebody else's experience you don't know what they went through to get where they are you don't know how much they labor you don't know how much they sacrifice you don't know what it costs [Applause] Hallelujah you don't know what somebody else went through just to get here but what it does it develops an experience so church I went in the doctor's office and you know when they they begin yeah and normally when I go I'll be preparing myself for a fight cause I'm a Child of God then the enemies don't want me to to walk out of any place Happy so what he does is he always plotting on me Hallelujah brother Michael to get me out of character so I can launch out and then I can't see the supernatural so you know what I go in I go in and the lady the nurse she says to me she says we need a urine sample I say okay so I get in the U.S Temple she comes back and she says oh my God oh my God you got so much glucose now me personally I believe God keeps you from certain veins he doesn't give you the knowledge of certain things so when it's spoken it doesn't bother you at all Holly is not a part of your experience amen see we can we can we right now Church Hallelujah I'll tell before I get back to that Hallelujah if I if I go on too much with this next testimony somebody say Get Back Church Hallelujah one time I was out with a brother Hallelujah we were sitting in a restaurant and rock and roll was playing and he says to me but Jesus I'm so sorry I'm so sorry for the music okay I can't beat the music kept playing [Music] he looks at me again please I'm so sorry brother I'm good [Applause] wow he says Oh Brother Jesus I'm so sorry I say look brother this music not bothering me is bothering you I don't have an experience with rock and roll so rock and roll don't bother me now if it was rap music it would have been something different so don't try to give me your battle without the experience [Applause] Hallelujah if it was rap and R B that'll be something different but I never had an experience with rock and roll [Applause] so I can sit in your car in the good Target very very all in once I am not tempted [Applause] because that's not a part of my experience but you put on some punk you put on some biggie then the words start to come back up you don't have to say brother can you change the channel yeah I don't want to hit it not that I'm afraid of it I've experienced already and what I mean by experience I've overcome it I'm not running from it I'm not afraid of it I just have no desire so cut it off and put on something that can feed my spirit Hallelujah my experience is taking over now and what we do too often we get saved and don't get sanctified Hallelujah so we go out in places Hallelujah you say God deliver you from smoke and you see somebody smoking a cigarette you're like oh my God he's smoking he's smoking oh my God it's coming my way let me say something if that's you you're not delivered because when you get delivered it has no more control over thank you Jesus if God delivers you from smoke holler if God deliver you from any kind of thing like that somebody can come around you who's a chimney build some Newports in your face if God delivers you from drugs they can blow you can be rhymed by smell some weed and all you say is somebody's smoking yeah why doesn't it bother you because you've had an experience with Deliverance once you get an experience changes your life changes your walk once you get an experience no I'm not saying go to the club because remember when you get an experience you have no more desire for [Applause] Hallelujah because we have to remember I want you young people to understand when you leave here your old nature is really going to fight you Hallelujah because it's sticky Hallelujah and the prophet of God said your old nature is sticky see you begin to remember things that you're delivered from Hallelujah I've told this testimony before Hallelujah I was in the department store and I had to get some more shirts because I was preaching the whole week and I went into a Macy's and they was playing Prince [Applause] yeah I know some of y'all too spiritual to identify with what I'm saying [Applause] but if I keep going I get you Elvis [Applause] if I keep going I'll get you Dolly Parton Hallelujah because you were once delivered from something too but you know what church I was sitting there and all the words from that song were right in my mouth and I'm sitting I'm preaching reality to you Church young people I want you to understand what's going to take place and now I'm sitting there in prisons owner on the music in the department store and it's playing and I know every word I'm going around a certain thing got beautiful [Applause] oh you thought when you got the holy ghost that this kind of stuff don't happen no once you get the Holy Ghost then the fight really begins amen Hallelujah I never had a problem with women wearing pants until I got the Holy Ghost amen oh you thought I was born like your arms you should be Wham won't garments pertaining to a man no once I got the Holy Ghost then conviction was in my eyes Hallelujah conviction was in my ears Hallelujah see once you get the holy spirit is Christ inside Hallelujah and only what he desires will come in and it wasn't until earlier I truly got saved and converted I could see sin and no longer have a taste for it Hallelujah because most men that are not converted they love to see a woman in pants why so they can see their shape they got women pants just to show your shape Hallelujah and now you have churches and places saying well I don't really understand what that means garments pertaining to a man well I know Holly I I believe ain't no brothers in here wearing dresses so what's the Garment holy the Garment has to be trousers the government has to be paying Hallelujah Church don't let the enemy bring an uncertain sound to the Simplicity of the god [Applause] Satan is is so crafty now we're in a day where they're saying let the child choose his own gender but your foolishness [Applause] let the child how how are the one-year-old two-year-old baby how are you gonna say I don't want to be a boy I don't want to be a girl that's a spirit of confusion Hallelujah uh oh we're here somebody struggling with gender identity well let me help you out let me help you out when you get out of the service you go and look in the mirror holy holy if your hair is a certain way well let me let me make it even more simple you want to know if you're a girl look in the mirror and do like this and if you come down and your hands go that means you are a girl Hallelujah you were born that way and no confusing spirit in the mind can change that experience of a woman and when you get a certain when you get a certain age every month something's going to visit you to tell you that you're a woman [Applause] sisters know what I'm talking about every month you're going to get a visitation from a friend that you don't like Hallelujah and you might say well I I feel like I feel like I'm a I'm a guy in a woman's body that's the devil lying to you Hallelujah you take a man I never understand why would a man you know what he can do he can take prescriptions Hallelujah he can take prescriptions and and and make things come out he can he can cut his hair a certain way he can put on makeup but you know one thing he can't change [Applause] yeah I ain't even gonna go there but let's just take it he can put on a dress he can dress up as a woman earlier but you ever seen a six foot nine woman with size 13 feet she cut this off she can inflate this she can put hair on that but she can't change them feet I ain't never seen nobody get a foot implant change your feet with this one thing you ain't gonna change Hallelujah and most men Hallelujah got big old-sized caveman feet and they walk with these experiences and the enemy comes and says no you're a woman the devil's lying to you and what the enemy has done he's got that Community fighting about things and rights that means nothing and even in our side Hallelujah they thought about going to the bathroom and all this stuff and think about the church amen the women they fight and they say oh my we won we can go Hallelujah as a transsexual I can go into the men's bathroom and the men say who we won as a transsexual I can go into the women's bathroom but did they really win because that woman who's a transsexual are going to man's bathroom and use it like a woman [Applause] and that man who's a transsexual how do you go in a woman's bathroom and use it like a man what are they doing they're exercising their experience you are what you are by the grace of God and you can't change that Hallelujah if I go back I ain't gonna be too long today Hallelujah but church I'm in the doctor's office and they come back and say oh you got glucose glucose what is glucose sound kind of strange to me and I was thinking I said I don't care about no glucose it can be glucose lactose dark toasts East Coast West Coast whatever kind of Coast you wanted to be I don't have [Applause] and she said you got diabetes I said no I don't and she's looking at her paperwork she said I got diamonds you got diabetes I say no I don't amen she said yes sir Mr Diggs right here your glucose levels and you're this and that I said you can say whatever kind of levels you want I don't have it so being a nurse sister called she was like you know uh she went to school for this so you know when somebody's tired of you they stop being polite so she was supposed to say okay Mr D's just go sit in the Next Room and wait on the doctor now she's like just going in the other room just going any other room because she's judging me by her experience as a nurse and I'm judging her by my experience as a son of God hello don't you let no circumstance change your experience with God and he's a Healer back did he's a Healer right now Hallelujah so I go on the other side and waiting on the doctor the doctor comes in and she's like hey Mr Dix how you doing and I'm like I'm doing quite lovely and she's like look at other paperwork she said oh my god oh you got diabetes I say Doc no I don't you got it no do you understand the word coming out of my mouth I do not have it so she was like okay but we'll put it to the test we'll put it to the desk and say you know what okay but we'll they did it you were in test she said okay we'll do a blood test blood test so I waited till she got out the room to go get the instruments and stuff brother Danny and she said we're going to try you we're going to test you by the blood and I started to say my God is greater my God is stronger God you are higher than any other God you are healer awesome [Applause] my God my God my God so I start to worship I started to worship you know what made me worship because if you're gonna test me by the blood that means I've already won [Applause] Hallelujah You're Gonna Catch Me by the blood I've already won [Applause] because my experience is to confess the blood of Jesus over my life Hallelujah so now I'm sitting there and I'm giving God praise for covering me by the blood and she comes in with a little instrument Hallelujah and she's ready to prick my fingers and let's do it come on come on see this is what my first rodeo Hallelujah I fought the spirit before so I wasn't afraid to stand on the same experience so I said go ahead test me test me hurry up test me test me test me [Applause] how you gonna say you believe God and Afraid those two don't go together perfect love cast out all fear yo people I want you to understand stand on your testimony don't let the devil back you down you say well brother geez that was a lot of emotion last night well let's make it clearly like we said anything without emotion is dead but what takes it from emotion to a real experience whether it was emotional that I'll tell you whether what you had was emotion if the power of God fell on you and you shouted you dance you worship you cry you scream hallelujah amen all of that in the moment if it was a motion to you you'll leave here this weekend and go back into your filth that means you was just emotional but if you leave here changed you leave here with different desires you leave here Desiring a closer walk with God that was more than just emotion that was God making a contact that was good Hallelujah touching you Hallelujah that was Lord that was God bringing life into your being that's more than just emotion so she comes and she Pricks my finger and the little machine goes off I forget the name of it but you know what I'm talking about the little machine goes out hungry she looks at it looks at me looks at it looks at me and I'm smiling [Applause] because I know what my God is I know what he gonna do Hallelujah so she looks at me and she says Mr Diggs you're right you don't have diabetes you don't have diabetes I said to her I told you and now she starts to ask me questions like I'm a doctor she says well I don't understand how can it be positive over here and be negative back here I said God wanted me to confess the right thing so over here it was there it was present but by the time it got back here my My Confession stopped it in his tracks My Confession set the devil down my confession oh and you're a confession your profession will stop the devil in his tracks your confession it was a real live demon but my confession bound the devil lock the devil up kick the devil out and your confession will do the same thing [Applause] [Music] and you know most doctors they're not satisfied with being defeated so she says to me well what did you eat last night she's trying to find some kind of resolution she said what did you eat and y'all know me I said I had some sweet tea and chocolate chip cookies and then she confesses to me brother Danny a doctor she confesses to me she says oh yeah normally when you eat things like that it shows up in your system I say okay I said okay hmm and then God began to show me something he'll begin to show me so I said okay now you're acknowledging that what you see in my body is the results of what kind of food I ate which is Gold Peak sweet tea and Chip Ahoy chocolate chip cookies so if that's what you saw chocolate chip and sweet tea why did you change the name of diabetes [Applause] call it what it is don't change his name to try to make me afraid call it what it is why didn't you say to me I see tea and cookies in your system but what the devil does he changed the name to try to get you fearful then you accept the spirit and now you have diabetes and it's simply something you ate [Applause] and I know some of y'all listen to me like that's all right but I gotta take this shot that's all right my levels are low get me some candy listen the prophet of God says my alarm going off I got to quit listen the prophet of God said he said before it becomes a spirit you have to accept it as a thought first so before anything manifestes in your life you have to receive the thought first that's why if you get up and you say man I feel like I'm coming down with the flu yes you are because you spoke it over yourself and now you've opened that door Hallelujah for that Spirit to manifest itself in your body Hallelujah but what if you get up and you say by your stripes I'm Healed [Applause] you allow the power of God hallelujah to move in your body hallelujah it's just that simple church it's an experience with God faith by experience Hallelujah but I'm gonna finish up with David and we're gonna get on out the way Hallelujah but you know Church David being called of God what separated now David Hallelujah was already King amen he was already the king already anointed amen hallelujah but God had him in trained yes God had him in training to do something that nobody else would do nobody has had the courage to do and when they when David heard things he heard it different from having everybody else heard and that's who we are when we hear the teachings of a prophet we hear something different from everybody else Hallelujah and you know Church David Hallelujah his father said hey David I want you the king to go give your brother something to eat should have been the other way around right but David just being in humility what was David doing David was waiting to his time he didn't try to force anything Hallelujah David just waited till his time came and I'll say to you young people don't try to do nothing special just continue to live an honest life and whatever God has for you he will open that door you say well Brothers I feel like I feel like I got a calling in my life wait on it don't try to make anything happen wait on it because if God do it that door will open up Hallelujah you don't have to force yourself into anything amen she is faked by experience and now David Hallelujah he's going to give his brothers maybe he has some Chipotle that day he has some Nando's you know that Nando's good Nando's Fit For A King holy and David come down and he come to see his brothers all his brothers everybody out there the army of his Israel over there you got the army of the Philistines out there and David is clueless to what's going on David walks into a war but I want you to catch something what was God doing God was sending the anointing and David comes down Hallelujah and Goliath for 40 days 40 nights streaming bring me a man bring me a man and when you leave these Services you're going to hear the devil louder than ever but I want you to know Hallelujah real Revival is recognizing your enemy and your God that's real Revival no we're not going to ignore the devil we're just going to put him in his place Hallelujah you got no business I want you to understand this the Bible according to scripture Satan has no right in your ear that's too high that's too hot Satan has no right in your face that's too high the Bible says Satan belongs under your feet [Applause] he got no right speaking of your head he got no right looking in your face he belongs under your feet so now David comes out everybody all right David comes out Hallelujah and he has the food Hallelujah to feed his brothers and he's just doing what his father asks him just be obedient do what your father asks you and David comes with the food and he gives it to his brothers and then he hears something that's been going on for 40 days he comes with the fool and as he's delivering the food he hears something say bring me a man in Davidson who is this uncircumfized who is this and the brothers of Life man you just come here to be naughty you just come to see the battle and David's like what battle are y'all scared what battle ain't nobody fighting is there another cause and then David one thing I want and I'm gonna cut this I'm gonna do this real quick one thing I want you to realize about David his experience was he kept asking questions right until he got in front of Goliath David say what's the reward David said who gonna fight David asked question after question and he didn't stop until he got in front of Goliath Hallelujah but one thing I want you to realize he came Hallelujah with a testimony Hallelujah that's what he was meeting Goliath with a testimony so he comes out Hallelujah and he says what will King Saul do Hallelujah for anybody that fights and defeats this giant Hallelujah and they said something to the fact he'll get his daughter and all this stuff David like I don't care about none of that this man is defying the armies of the Living God Amen and then the scripture says and Saul heard of what David was saying it got back to the king now I want you to catch something Hallelujah David and Saul Julia were anointed by the same messenger amen amen Saul was anointed by by Samuel and David was anointed by Samuel remember the prophet of God said it can be a true anointing and a false vessel Hallelujah so it was a true anointing on Saul Saul prophesied he did all the things that that anointing would do the difference between Saul and David was Saul couldn't obey and that's what will separate you young people from regular young people going to church you hear the word of God and there's something inside of you that will obey my experience Hallelujah you just say Lord be it unto me according to your word Hallelujah and that's what David did Hallelujah David Hallelujah was anointed by the same message Saul was but what happened was Saul couldn't self-reflect and David could catch it God told Saul go down and kill everything go kill a gag go kill all the amlic I go kill everything you know what sauce is all say yes God and he got down there and he saw some pretty Lambs he said take these and put these over here he saw some nice clothes they take this and put us over here he maybe saw a nice looking woman say hey take a we can use her take her and put it she probably can cook take it and put over there and in God yes comes to the prophet amen and he says go get sold true he's disobeyed me he didn't listen to my word and then Samuel comes down and he says hey I thought God told you to destroy everything he says I did see he couldn't self-reflect he said he said I did he said he said he said but I wanted to do this and sacrifice us unto the Lord God didn't say sacrifice anything to me out here he said destroy it all he said kill mother baby suckling goat calf everything kill it all why because then when it matures it's going to be an amalekite amen and if God is telling you when you get back home take down your pictures erase your video delete this person from your social media delete this person from your social media if God is giving you instructions to destroy your amplicity don't hold back and Samuel says what is the bleeding of the sheep and then Saul couldn't reflect he says it was the people and how often do we blame what we've done on somebody else be careful of those friends when y'all doing wrong and when it's exposed they throw you under the bus that ain't a real friend they don't say we they say they did yeah they did it it wasn't just me and I went by my they did it yeah you be careful of that friend that's not a real friend because they can't self-reflect Hallelujah they want to put it all on somebody and I was Saul did and then Samuel says hallelujah just as you a gag has left mother's childless so will be your mother God got people in the church that will help you destroy your demons Hallelujah God got people in the church that will help you fight your demons Hallelujah just like we said last night you are not alone somebody has an experience with God Hallelujah in our church David Hallelujah David comes Hallelujah his time of self-reflection when he took bathshebra took another man's wife Hallelujah not only did he take him he killed the man premeditated murder and David didn't even realize he was under that spirit until he heard the words of a prophet some of us didn't even realize that we were Wayward until we heard the words of a prophet and that Prophet start to put everything in order amen and once David said look at David he said David there was a man who had one sheep and there was another man who had plenty sheep and he took that man's one sheep David said I'm gonna kill him I'm gonna kill him I'm gonna destroy him and the prophet said Nathan said David you're that me amen amen so you know how David felt yes David said I'm gonna kill him what he was saying is I want to kill myself the reflection of what was done Hallelujah he was saying I need to die I need to die in God I ain't quite there yet I need to die but then David didn't make excuses David said to him I have sinned he didn't say it was the people he didn't say what best people know she come out there every day taking a bath and she know I'm sitting out there relaxing no he said Lord I have sinned he could self-reflect and God said David your sins will not be imputed because you have confessed your sins honey I'm Gonna Give You Mercy Hallelujah if you make your confession God will give you Mercy God gave David Mercy and David he comes to Goliath oh my give me about 10 more minutes David he comes to the battle now he's filing and be aware let me tell the adults don't try to steal these young people's fire why they keep saying all these new songs let's get back into the hymn book we need the same message songs what is a message song I thought anything that exalts Jesus Christ amen is worthy of giving him praise we have to realize that we're all built different and I don't want them to say it but I said holy the way I'm built earlier singing about a rainbow trout and a silver tip band and all that went down to the river and he shot the gun and oh that don't do nothing for me [Applause] I'm just being honest that don't do nothing you can sing about the rainbow trout and all that don't do nothing for me Hallelujah but if you give me some Hallelujah How great is our God sing with me is [Music] [Applause] is our God and that song is a stem off of the original How great is our God Hallelujah How Great Is Our God how great is his word he's the greatest one [Music] [Music] see we know the songs don't fight against us just let us go with what God has given us hallelujah you know it's too often that the adults Hallelujah are so separated from what God is doing with you no don't fight them fight along with them hallelujah what we do say nah brother Branham gave us a song that we shouldn't be singing all the circle of people they lies this and that I ain't worried about their lives what about my life see what are we doing the experience is to catch the inspiration behind us and the Holy Ghost does that Hallelujah if it's a song that make you wanna no we ain't singing that in church because the inspiration room the inspiration is to make you move your hips the inspiration is to make you dip see that's the wrong inspiration but the song earlier make you raise your hands you're the song make you give thanks who cares about the life of the songwriter who cares about the life of a songwriter if the inspiration is right you say my brother Brandon gave us and you know what you know what we've seen songs that the prophet approved of that the songwriters wanted to commit suicide we don't complain about them songs go back and study it huh don't bother me about no music Hallelujah cause I'm a worshiper [Applause] Hallelujah I'm a worshiper and I ain't gonna let some cold stale mannequin worshiper stop me from giving God his due [Applause] listen David Gets before Goliath that was his whole goal he's standing before his greatest battle with a testimony with an experience and now they're going to talk to each other Goliath for the last time says bring me a man you know God has a sense of humor God sends that big old nine foot giant a boy a teenager what God was so in the Philistines one of my babies will kill all y'all [Applause] holy and the prophet of God's head the weakest Christian on their knees the weakest Christian on their knees is more than a match for the god a weakest Christian I ain't where I want to be the weakest Christian [Applause] am I but a dog he said I'm gonna take you and put you on the edge of my spirit and feed you to the birds David said oh yeah you come to me with with Spears and prayers and all this stuff he said I come to you in the name of the Lord God of Israel and I'm gonna cut your hair off today [Applause] experiences speaking and what you have to realize when faith and experience meet that faith will create what you need for that situation [Applause] that faith will create what you need for that situation based upon what you spoke out of your mouth David said I'm gonna cut your head off and didn't even have a sword so where was it coming from it was coming from his faith it was coming from his experience Hallelujah and it's your experience remember church when God told Moses he said hey stop complaining stop crying speak and move forward he say hush the people speak and move forward now Moses comes out and he says Hey Red Sea get out of the way no he didn't say anything to the seat what did he do he spoke to the enemy he spoke to the hindrances and creation heard the voice of God and it created his Deliverance based upon what he spoke Moses say the Egyptians whom you've seen you shall see them no more forever and then the cease it foreign [Applause] God spoke to Moses a creation to see heard it and the sea say I have to make a way for that word to come to pass you speak it and the surroundings will obey Hallelujah that's what faith does David takes the slingshot Wham in only one place that you could hit him Goliath falls down David runs up to him and he takes the enemy's own weapon and use it against them [Applause] now young people I want you to take the Devil's weapon and use it against him honey if God delivered you Hallelujah from world and music you identified and go help your brother hallelujah amen sisters if God is delivering you from some young man who was part of the House of hell you go help your sister hurry you help her look out for the same demon powers use the enemy's tactics against him Hallelujah in our church David cuts his head off and David grabs the head and once he grabs the head Hallelujah everybody else gets anointed oh [Applause] God need is one man one woman to get in their position and it'll change the whole outcome in my closing let's turn to second Samuel chapter 21. everybody all right second Samuel chapter 21. uh I won't verse let me see oh my I won't verse 16. I'm gonna kind of move kind of fast but I want you to understand when David got in position God sent David help amen he wasn't all by himself God not only did he send David help he said David men that was just as mighty as he was so what was David's friends see Hallelujah birds of a feather flock together and if David was a giant killer all his Brotherhood were giant Killers also Hallelujah young people I want you to understand you not Hallelujah gonna be by yourself hallelujah what you are believing in God will send people with you that believe the same thing Hallelujah and look church I want you to look at some of these men right quick I I can't read it all but let's just let's just uh let's just start at verse um 16. and it's Baba knob which was of the sons of the Giants the weight of whose spear weighed 300 shekels of brass and weight he being girded with a new sword thought he was slay David who does that sound like that sounds like Goliath don't it Hallelujah so let me tell you something once you have a battle Hallelujah God is not going to stop perfecting you until you reach your full potential Hallelujah now David had to destroy a giant Hallelujah Goliath but Goliath had Brothers whoa Goliath had Brothers but with Hallelujah one thing I want you to understand so did David Hallelujah Goliath had Giants and David had giant killers [Applause] Hallelujah oh my mothers me up Hallelujah I'm trying to quit but look he says look and the best side of the son of Zariah secured him Hallelujah and smote the Philistine and killed him Hallelujah then the men hold the men of uh David swearing to him saying thou shall go no more out with us to battle that thou question the light of Israel you see the giant was sneaking up on David David didn't know Hallelujah that this particular giant was trying to kill him and he was bragging say he had a new sword so he's gonna kill David but then a I saw him you know what he was saying he was saying David I got your back [Music] and that's what you need to tell your sister your brother I got your back don't worry about demons sneaking around I got your back I'm praying for you I got your back earlier and when he thought he would kill David a bishop came out of nowhere Hallelujah he came out of nowhere and cut his head off and then he told David David don't go out here by yourself anymore we are with you amen see there was somebody else in church who had an experience too Hallelujah oh my and he came to pass after this that there was again a battle of the Philistines at God and then she was she simply shot should be shy and hittite shlew South which was of the sons of the Giants see now everybody coming out the woodwork those people that you thought were insignificant no they giant Killers too those young people you thought that wasn't gonna be nothing no they giant Killers too [Applause] it just took for a certain battle for them to mature and realize Hallelujah we ain't going out like that oh my listen he says and there was again a battle of of God in the Philistines of alien that died of Ellen Illinois and the injury the betamite Shrew the brother of Goliath they still killing Giants everywhere a giant rolls his head God had a new believer good neighbor I want you to get ready God has raised up some new believers and they got their demons and every other Church represented you young people when you go back home realize you are a giant killer too church I got Nicole's but think about it just the illustrations of some of David's Mighty Men those who also had an experience of Faith there was one man Hallelujah who jumped down in the pit on a snowy day and kill a lion just because the lion say it wrong there was another man Hallelujah who killed so many other Philistines that when he finished his hand was throbbing he's with David's Mighty Men Hallelujah and a I was the chief Hallelujah so don't think you all by yourself there's somebody in here with the same anointing you got the same anointing you see being preached is the same anointing falling on you because remember there's only one God one Church there's a difference of administrations but by the same spirit amen Hallelujah a little church right when I close come on musicians I'm closing listen one day David desires some water from Bethlehem Davis just started talking about it man I sure would like to have some of that good old well water this ain't no Fuji this ain't no no alkaline you know this is Bethlehem water the real deal minerals in it not none of the stuff they're making money for Hallelujah but those Mighty Men just heard David's request David didn't even say go get it David just had a desire and those Mighty Men Hallelujah remember they were young men just like David with the same anointing Hallelujah in church Hallelujah they said David want water let's go get it now I want you to realize the Bible says there was a Gareth sense of Philistines Hallelujah on the way Hallelujah to Bethlehem and they went out there and they started to fight [Laughter] three of them with the brother of God said that wasn't the easy Journey it looks like they they may have went a couple blocks the prophet said they fought 15 miles of demons 15 miles and you know how they you know how they fought that's how they fall Hallelujah they had each other's back honey they had to worry about who was behind him they had a brother behind them they had a sister behind him they wasn't worried about who was speaking up holy now this is the question are you your brother's keeper and once they finish fighting all those demons Hallelujah they came back with the water they said David we just heard your request and they gave David the water David said I can't drink this I got to pull this out into the Lord so there's sacrifice Hallelujah that they was giving unto David really they was giving it unto the Lord so you may look at it well I'm gonna be faithful to Pastor Simon or Pastor Danny no you're really being faithful to God who or whoever your pastor is once you become faithful Hallelujah your service is unto God Let It Be amen uh experienced by faith and don't let the devil steal what's taking place in your life yeah you may go back home and you may find yourself fighting even harder but just know you're not by yourself reflect back Hallelujah reflect back and say I wasn't the only one in there crying I wasn't the only one in there worshiping I wasn't the only one in there dancing there's somebody else who went through what I went through Hallelujah so in those times Hallelujah like David Hallelujah as much as he fought the Bible said David had to encourage himself let your testimony in your faith my experience take you to the next battle it ain't your knowledge it ain't how good you look it's how much you can surrender to God and once you realize what God has done can you imagine battle at the battle but before they got to these battles can you imagine what David did David would probably would come out and he would probably say hey there's no need for innocent blood to be shared now he's doing what goliath did we don't we you ain't got to fight don't worry about it we have the true Living God and my God is undefeated now if you don't want to die ain't no need to fight but if you want to fight David had a bag on his side and David went in that bag and it was the head of Goliath David pulled their head out he said now if you want to fight Hallelujah this will be your outcome can you imagine the fear in the Philistines Army when they seen the head of their Champion cut off in the hands of David before we worship I want everybody to hold your Goliath up the enemy's head has been cut off and I don't never want you to doubt how God has used you and what God has done hallelujah Hallelujah the champion Hollywood has been fighting you has been defeated everything you fight from now on is just going to be one of his brothers Hallelujah and if you defeated Goliath you'll also defeat his brothers somebody hold the head up high hold up your Victory High hold it up real high Goliath has been defeated by your testimony it's your testimony that has defeated him does anybody have a testimony does anybody have a testimony did God touch anybody's life now you hold that Victory and you show the devil what God has done let's pray let's pray
