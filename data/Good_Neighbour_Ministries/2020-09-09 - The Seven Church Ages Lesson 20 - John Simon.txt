========================================
[Music] oh it is jesus oh it is jesus oh it is jesus in my soul for i have touched the hem of his garment and his blood has made me whole yes friends it's good to be here again oh it is jesus oh it is jesus oh it is jesus in my soul for i have touched the hem of his garment and his blood has made me whole o praise god heavenly father in jesus name we ask thy blessing here today we pray the great holy spirit will anoint us together as we look into the perfect law of liberty bless us we pray in jesus name amen and amen now out of the book of revelation chapter 2 reading verses 1. unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things said he that hold it the seven stars in his right hand who walk it in the midst of the seven golden candlestick thanks be to god for the reading of his word this is who jesus is this is the same one this jesus that is both lord and christ thank god he is the one and only lord god almighty he is the same hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he is our lord he is our master he is our savior he is our all in all and here we see jesus we see jesus walking in the midst of his churches throughout the seven church ages and what he was in the first day here we see him he is the same in the last day we see him the mighty god that what he was is also what he is and what he has done is what he will keep on doing for all time for he is our unchanging god who changes not praise god we serve a god like that a god who does not change who does not lie but a god who stands by his word and his word changes not for it's the same yesterday today and forever heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never ever pass away notice it's jesus and jesus alone as we look out friends we do not see jesus on anyone else but our eyes see jesus only and the bible tells us that he is seen walking up and down amongst these candlesticks he is walking alone in a middle and in the midst of his churches there is no one else with him neither in there indeed can there be anyone else within him for he alone did the work of salvation he did the entire work of redemption he is the one who purchased her the bride with his own precious broiled blood so he alone owns her and he is her lord and master not only did he save her but she was humble enough to surrender herself that he would be her lord and her master having the preeminence in her life and so with gratitude with grace within her heart she gives him all the glory all the honor and all the praise is worthy to give to this lamb that shed his blood as though it was slain and there she gives him the glory and the praise for he can share it with no other as we look out and we see jesus he is walking yes but we do not see any pope with him when we look out and we see jesus there is no princely archbishop with him we do not see any cardinal walking with him and furthermore we look out there there is no other intercessor any other mediator mediatrix there is no mary you remember mary who was the vessel or considered to be the mother of jesus or mother of the body that god wanted to create so that he could indwell it god in christ hallelujah thanks be to god and now in our day christ in you your hope of glory amen praise god so mary is not seen with him great as she was blessed as she was chosen as she was separated as she was used of god as she was and yet in this scene we see him in his total supremacy we see him in his lordship and he is seen alone to him be all the praise the honor and the glory for he alone is worthy of all the praise and the honor and the glory thanks be to god that when we see him as i see him as you see him when we see him we do not see him turning to another person beside him called his father making any remark to him we do not see him turn to his right and call of the holy spirit to do something that he would like to get done for this is inconceivable for he is the one true god father son and holy spirit he is the eternal spirit that allowed himself to indwell a body of time a time body a body of flesh god and man god in christ amen god walking among us emmanuel god with us hallelujah god above us israel god with us back there they amongst the jewish people now god in us walking and talking and living within us there is no one else with him for there is no life without him and without him there is no salvation for is there is no salvation in any other for there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen there was no there was no one with him when he was there in gethsemane oh lest i forget gethsemane lest i forget his love for me oh may the great holy spirit take our minds back to think of how the bible says he struggled he prayed until there was like sweats drops of blood upon his brow while he fought the great fight and struggled against the great hordes of satan and sin and fought against them and how that he was there all alone in gethsemane treading the fierceness of the winepress of the wrath of god alone making making in other words he was about to uh address or to best satisfy the the wrath of god against the sins of the entire human race and to pay the price of our redemption it was no other but jesus and jesus alone was none other but jesus that hung on the cross it was not a pope it was not mary it was not peter it was no other than jesus himself that hung upon the cross there alone for our sins for he is the author and the finisher of our faith he is the alpha he is the omega the beginning of the end wonderful counselor mighty god hallelujah everlasting father amen and we are married or espoused to him and to no other we are not married to any church so we do not have to take on any church name we are married to him christ therefore we are christians we walk in his name in his light in his life in his power therefore we are one with him hallelujah praise god hallelujah we belong to him and because we belong to him his words is our law there is no creed but christ there is no law but love there is no words but the words that he has spoken in this bible and we are resting upon that by faith in his precious word that he has given we do not trust in creeds we do not trust in the darkness of man we are not trusting any bylaws of man any constitutions drawn up by men they have no influence and no effect upon the true believer that believes only the word of our living god amen lord god hallelujah yes it is jesus oh it is jesus oh it is jesus in my soul amen oh praise god hallelujah he walks amongst us he walks among his churches he walks with his messengers it is god in the midst of the churches for jesus of the new testament is the same jehovah of the old testament now making himself visible in the form of a man whose body he shaped and formed in the womb of a woman called mary who was just used and blessed he was not from mary of mary but he only passed through mary to make himself visible to the world so it's not the that she is the special blessed woman person on the side but that he is the blessed one he is our hope he is our faith he is our salvation he is the one we should pray to he is the one we should call upon it's his name that should be glorified and magnified for he alone is worthy and our relationship should be with him him alone thank god that we have this relationship with god and our relationship with god is true jesus christ the visible appearance of god that a human being could have a visual to understand who god was how god acted and how god will always act for what god did the first time he will do every time for he is perfect in all of his ways he was alone when he went to golgotha when he climbed the goddess hill he was alone then nailed him to a cruel cross he was all alone when they pierced him in the side and they took him down from the cross and placed him into a roman tomb and then have the gall to put their name or their seal on it as if they're the original but here he was that he the word that they tried to bury under the very roman seal here he was working in the background fighting against satan and the hordes of hell fighting against them to free the captives of the old testament prophets patriots and believers of the old testament that were in paradise at that time and so satan had to give up those keys of dead hell of the grave he still claims that he asked them anyway that he owns all of those keys but in reality the keys are really in the hands of the lord jesus christ himself and those are nothing but fake theirs are nothing but just fake symbols that he carries around with him because he had to give up those keys so that jesus could open the prison doors of those souls that were imprisoned then and take captivity captive and take them back to heaven with him oh praise god he let their captivity captive and then he was able to pour out his spirit and send gifts unto men thank god it is jesus alone we see him yes with the seven stars in his right hand and of course we know that the right hand is the hand of power it speaks of this in the book of psalms chapter 44 verse 3 for they got not their land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou that's favor unto them so we see that in this right hand of power he holds these seven messengers within his right hand according to revelation chapter 1 verses 20. and these seven messengers which signify on the earth they signify the power the sign of the power and authority of the living god flowing through them and using them as god expresses himself for god is always behind his messengers whenever he sends them to a particular age and they go forth in the fire of god in the fire power of the holy spirit anointed and used by the living god to send forth and to manifest his word for that day and for that time and so these messengers these men that were backed up by the hand of god they went forth under that inspiration for there were the seven stars of the seven church ages through the season of time that god had in his supernatural economy their stars and we know that stars do not come out in the day but stars shine their light at night they reflect the light after that the sun is gone down and they're reflecting not a light of their own but his light his light is their life his light is their power his light my friend is their entire existence and inspiration for they have no light of their own they don't come on the earth to start their own ministry or to point to themselves but they are here to reflect his light and so with their entire life with their walk with their talk with everything they do oh it is jesus oh it is jesus and jesus alone is to bring glory and honor and praise to his great and mighty name and to draw the attention of the people of his bride to him all glory be to god that's what they're here for and so they want a man to walk in the light of his life amen so it's nighttime it's dark when the stars come out so if we know god has sent a messenger especially in this last day then we know it must be the law decent church age in which the bible tells us according to zechariah that there will be a day that's dark nor night but an evening time it shall be light and so thank god that when it became dark and the truth of god the word that was given to the church was displaced was misplaced misinformation was given dislocation had taken place from the original word of god then the great holy spirit anointed a messenger to bring the original seed the original word thus saith the lord not thus said the church that thus said the pope not thus said the cardinal judge bishop whoever it is but thus see it the lord himself so in the middle of this night of the blackness of sin in this period of lilithia out come the stars to shine and twinkle and bring their bright and shining lights to the glory of god to the world that the world may see another display of the person and life of jesus christ glory to god hallelujah thanks be to god hallelujah amen so these seven messengers are making known god to his people listen what the word says in john 13 20 he that receiveth them receiveth him that sent them they speak with his authority he stands behind them he backs them up hallelujah all the powers of heaven and earth all the powers of the godhead are behind them that is why they can always say how can you deceive me you cannot lie to me now i know your thoughts i see what you are thinking i know what happened yesterday when you were young thus thus this lesson does took place when you were just a young man or a young woman and that messenger will tell you exactly because it was not just the words of a man god god was backing up a man that's why the man could say if there's anything that i have said in his name that is not right then you show me where it is in the word of god not what he as a man spoke of himself but as a messenger speaking in the name of the lord with thus saith the lord there is not one anywhere that can say anything against that for it is the word of our god hallelujah thanks be to god that in matthew 28 verses 18 to 20 that he speaks the word of god clearly jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth go therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father notice he do not does not say names and there is a conjunction between these in the name of the father one name and of the son one name end of the holy ghost one name for all three in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo and behold i am with you always even to the end of the age even to the consummation of the age even to the end of all of these church ages when time for the church ages will be no more time for the church ages will have run out and will be over praise be to god man full of the holy ghost and full of faith and fired up with the anointing and the fire of the holy spirit blazing shining brightly in their lives no other life no other ministry no other man woman upon the earth at that time whose life will ever be able to measure up to them because there were the specific messengers sent by the living god in the presence of almighty god and they're the ones holding forth the word of life for the entire age hallelujah and so no believer of any age or to say oh i wish i was back in the days i could see jesus oh i was i wish i was back in the days of the apostles you don't have to be back in those days he has come in our day in our time manifested himself through a human being an armed day and let us know his actions his activities his power his words his will his ways and his divine purpose within our lives praise be to god hallelujah amen for he is the same yesterday today and forever where two or three are gathered together in his name as as we are here now he is in the midst of us and he is in the midst to bless and to anoint with his presence hallelujah and he is not here and as a complacent onlooker he is not here just to be a spectator he is not here just to be an angelic recorder but he stands here anointed the anointing the word to express himself of who he truly truly is that he is the life giver he is the sustainer he is the giver of all good gifts to the church of god and we receive it all with thanksgiving in our hearts hallelujah i said hallelujah i said praise be to god and thank god for what he has done now not only does he have these marvelous wonderful messengers in his right arm but the bible says he walk it in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks how meaningful these words are when we view it in the light of scripture for as you know christ is our life and here's the life of the church and back then it's not kansas like now but the seven uh seven armed candle barns of of of the jewish people with one main stem that goes into the oil container on the bottom on all these candles sticks on the top receive their light their life and their strength their vitality it all flows from him and without him they could do nothing so he is our life he is the life of the church and she has no other life none of our own hallelujah without him friends we are nothing but a religious society without him we are just a religious gathering or just a club a meaningless gathering of people if his presence is not there we need his power and his presence for us to be the church the true church of the living god what we have today without his power his presence with no regard for him or his person what we have is a beautiful looking jeweled corpse calling itself the modern church of the living god uh and that church no matter all her beautiful wonderful programs no matter her beautiful makeup no matter how lovely she looks with all her orders with all her efforts with all the graces that she has all her achievements without the life of christ the animation the inspiration the anointing of the holy spirit in her midst she is nothing but a rotten sticking religious corpse in the presence of almighty god with him in her midst motivating and moving her she is the wonderment of all the ages for within her is his fullness of his spirit in dwelling her praise god and the in this very hour in which we speak his presence is here his power is here his anointing is here his very supernatural being is here to anoint the spoken word he the living word is anointing the spoken word to your heart he who is the living word the original seed of god going forth and anointing our hearts and lives here today praise be to god hallelujah amen so he who walked in the first age is here still today walking in this last stage as we bring glory to his name jesus christ the same yesterday jesus christ the same yesterday today and even forevermore thanks be to god hallelujah again our scriptures continues he walketh he walk it in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks in the book of exodus chapter 25 verse 31 and thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold of beaten work shall the candlestick be made his his shaft and his branches his bowls and his knots and his flowers shall be of the same so the true church of jesus christ the bride is lightened by god to pure gold of course gold expresses his person and character and so his righteousness becomes her righteousness his attributes becomes her attributes and her identification her identity she finds herself or her identification in him for sheep and him are really one that's why he says i am the vine you are the branches without me he can do nothing oh does the song well does the song say without him i can do nothing without him i'll surely fail without him i will be drifting like a ship without a sale o jesus or jesus would you know him today would you like to know him today in the power of his life and in the power of his resurrection may you come to know him in the power of his presence and of his life and of his resurrection now certainly friends we find out that she is summed up the church is a some total of his expression of his manifestation of his glory in the in her person he makes himself manifested for she is his handiwork she is his workmanship and she is his craftsmanship she is his masterpiece that he has seen through the ages and now he makes himself his eternal wisdom and his divine purpose from before the foundation of the world is now made manifest in and through her that the world will begin to understand the unveiling of the mighty god god in christ christ in the church the kingdom now being restored oh praise god how can we fully understand or comprehend this praise god we cannot but we can accept it by revelation faith for god himself has spoken this within the word thank god that he is not just a candlestick of gold but this candlestick is a beaten gold of course we understand beaten means like a craftsman shaping the candlestick he beats it and he shapes it it's memorable it's it's able to allow itself to be molded to be crafted to be shaped praise god hallelujah but if you were to take brass brass is resistant it's not like that and brass can be broken but thanks be to god this is like beaten gold that is willing to allow itself to be shaped to be shown to be whatever he wants it to be praise god hallelujah isn't that beautiful to think that the church is his masterpiece that the church is his handiwork that the church is crafted by him and that she is built by him according to his blueprint that he had and has in his mind for her concerning her of how she would look how she would act and what she will be for his glory and for his honor how beautiful to know all of this is not man made man thinking or the figment of man's thoughts or man's imagination but it is out of the very mind of god from before the foundation of the entire world the outside of jesus christ himself has there ever been a people beaten like this except for the true believers true christians everywhere in every age that they have lived in beaten and purged that she might manifest that she is truly the bride of jesus christ surely this church this group a body of believers are filling up the rest of his sufferings here upon the earth hallelujah she is the spoiled but yet she opens not her mouth she is left behind to carry on his work her life is always in jeopardy jeopardy but she stands with the word of god she has led to the guillotine she has led to the burning pillars as you latimer and ridley in england she is led to the coliseums of rome led to the slaughter to die on his behalf yay the bible says yes she is she is eaten up like bread and she has led to the slaughter all day long and yet she opened her mouth she suffers for him and yet she does not retaliate neither does she cause harm or suffering against those that bring pain and suffering to her or worthy of the gospel is this bride this true church of the lord jesus christ himself lord of god because he allowed herself to be handmade handcrafted shaped by him formed by him shaped by him to worship him formed by him to be faithful to him and to hold the his unchanging hand she is bowed but not broken she is knocked down but not knocked out she rises up and presses on in this way of life praise god she is a thing of beauty and a joy forever in the in the presence of this world they will behold her especially in these last days he will give forth through her a quick short work and display her in all her beauty to the entire world that she is his workmanship and he shaped her he formed her and he made her for himself his unfailing bride who holds to god's unchanging hand her lover or redeemer or savior or bridegroom or all in all may god bless you my beloved brethren wherever you are whoever you are may god bless you as you can see yourself within these seven church ages for if you are of that true church you will find your spirit deep calling to the deep and saying amen amen amen i believe it i believe it i believe it god bless you until next week when we come together again in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Music] do you
