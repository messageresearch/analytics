hungering for the Living God this morning amen Hallelujah sometimes we get up here and we just wait for the Holy Spirit to come and do what he wants to do I got a message this morning that it's been burning on my heart and actually been a part of my experience and uh I believe it's the bride's experience too amen my title this morning is uh perfect Faith shifting us from law to Grace oh my if if it's impossible for man to really you know teach or or really show this to you that's why he says I open no man's shut I shut no man open we need the Holy Spirit here this morning each and every one of you Amen in your hearts need to be not to hear from me but hear from the holy spirit amen amen hallelujah glory to God I thank the Lord for his grace this morning I I woke up and my throat my wife go what's what's going on with you I don't know but God cleared it amen so let's turn to the word this morning Hallelujah Romans 4 13 and Jeremiah 31 31. I hope that I can maybe lay a foundation this morning and we're going to continue because there's so much in this but if you want to really enrich yourself those who are really seeking for God and to know him in a greater way the book of Romans the book of Ephesians the message of Grace brother Branham and perfect Faith you get into those amen that's what I've been feeding on for this message this morning Hallelujah thank you Lord let us pray father one day you were on the cross and you said into thy hands I commit my spirit father into thy hands we commit ourselves this morning Lord as speaker and as hero Lord you said if I be lifted up I draw all men unto myself father we don't want man to be lifted this morning well but we we want men out of the way both speaker and here are out of the way this morning because we have our own opinions we have our own thoughts Lord my Lord your mind is greater than that father and that's what we want this morning there's an obstacle Lord which is our flesh and this carnal mind that is in the way that battles in and is that enmity with you and it fights us every day father and it's here this morning it's it's the tool that Satan uses to try to distract us from hearing your voice but Lord by your grace this morning father we ask Lord that you give us the grace Lord that we may walk out of here and be like those that were on the road to Emmaus then our hearts burn along the way as he spoke to us and he broke the bread break bread this morning Lord break bread to your children father we invite you Lord Jesus I can't do nothing without you but I stand Here by faith believing that you will come and do it Lord Grant these things Lord bless each and every one we bless your holy name in Jesus name Romans 4 13 4 The Promise that he should be Heirs of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh Wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all Jeremiah 31 31. now the Lord here is speaking because he knows he's looking ahead in the future and he knows that nobody can keep the law so he's speaking here in Jeremiah 31 31 behold the days come saith the Lord that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt which my Covenant they break although I was a a husband unto them saith the Lord but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and I will be their God and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord for they shall all know me from the least to the greatest of them saith the Lord for I will forgive their iniquities and remember their sins no more God bless you as you seated you see many many things here the scriptures are saying for all will know me and no man is going to have to say you know know the Lord because he will come and put the laws in their hearts and write them in their hearts and their minds for all will know the Lord by the by the spirit of Revelation in this hour Hallelujah I broke my other glasses and I got these glasses and I realized they're falling off my face so if they fall off just give me Grace this morning Hallelujah Paul labels life before his conversion as life under the law and we know Paul was a Pharisee of the Pharisees amen no man it was taught or highly educated and knew the law like Paul knew it and after the life of his conversion he called his life under grace so before his conversion it was law after his conversion it is Grace and that is the way it is today before the New Birth it's law after the New Birth it's Grace Hallelujah what was The Blessing of Abraham so the blessing That Came Upon Abraham and Genesis 12 1-3 was the blood covering over his sins which came upon him because of his faith and hope in the sacrifice of the Messiah to come that's why when God said offer up your son Isaac and and Abraham when his son asked him where's the sacrifice and Abraham said God will provide himself a sacrifice because Abraham was the father of faith of Revelation he seemed to come in Messiah Hallelujah he's seen the grace of God coming amen do we see God's grace in our lives do we see his grace Amen in our lives and come into us oh I see nothing but Grace amen I don't see law this morning amen I see nothing but the grace of God if it wasn't for the grace the grace of God in my life where would I be this morning where would you be this morning you're sitting here this morning by his grace and his grace alone Oh Glory to God Amen Hallelujah amen and once that covering was there God could bless and multiply increase him in so many ways until he became quite wealthy but Abraham did not receive the promise through the law he received it because he was right with God through his faith amen glory to God he became quite wealthy doesn't the scripture say Seek first the kingdom of God that's the key that's the grace of God in our lives that we in our lives can seek his kingdom his righteousness for our lives his will for our lives first that's what faith leads us he wasn't worried about money he wasn't worried about prospering amen he was worried amen he was seeking God and the kingdom of God first don't you understand when you find him and you seek him and you hunger for him you attract everything else that's his scripture we worry so much Hallelujah we worry so much about the material things about this of this life we look at the world today we see what's going on and we worry about tomorrow he said don't worry about tomorrow don't worry about what you'll eat you'll drink oh my seek my face Hallelujah if God will feed the birds simple things Jesus said God will feed the birds God will allow people to reap where they didn't sow how much more you what do you think about yourself this morning who do you think you are this morning are you Sons and Daughters of the Living God my what a position glory to God amen I'm just excited up here like I always say I just the way I preach I can't deliver it any other way if I deliver it in a softer way I'll just mess up everything I get excited and I preach Hallelujah I'm not angry amen I'm rejoicing glory to God Amen sometimes you gotta nail it home eh you gotta nail it home I understand I I I'm in the same boat as you amen I sit down there sometimes and I have to shake myself glory to God I'm fighting the flesh I'm fighting the obvious theory of the devil I fight him all week like you did and we come in here amen and he's still lingering Hallelujah sometimes you need the word to come hot and heavy with fire amen so you can leave here different than what you came in because that's what we want don't we or you just coming to church to be religious and and take up a Pew and show God your good works we're not coming for that we want to leave different here I want to know him as Paul said in the power of his resurrection I want to walk out of here different today even myself I want to know him in a greater way as the words coming forth oh my what is Abraham's greatest example of obedience to God by faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go to a place that he received as an inheritance you see the greatest part of Abraham is he oh the calling of God in his life oh how we fight that so much when God calls us in many different directions in our lives many different simple things in our lives God leading us along the path amen speak into our hearts amen you ask God to speak to you and you asking for your direction and his perfect will for your life he will speak that to your heart amen but it's whether you'll be obedient to it oh you think it was easy for Abraham to leave his home you think it was easy for him to leave his family and everything behind and goes to a land that he knew nothing about that was a Strange Land to him it wasn't easy for him but he did it because he obeyed God he had faith when God speaks Faith speaks into our hearts and he went out not knowing where he was going by faith he went to live in a land promise as a foreigner in a foreign land intense with Isaac Jake Heirs of the same promise Abraham was the father of faith not of law his whole experience and his calling was by Grace he walked and lived and gave was by grace not because he was told to do it by men but God spoke to him God wanted to lead his children the children of Israel by Grace but they wanted the law of Moses they didn't want to hear God's voice but they wanted to hear the voice of men God has always wanted to lead his children right from the beginning of Adam and Eve by grace amen he wanted to speak with them he wanted the relationship with them but they always wanted the law they wanted something to do they wanted to Pat themselves on the back amen oh my we're back to Grace God is doing a great shift in this hour there's a great shift going in in a lot of Our Lives if you're walking in the spirit and you're walking with God I know you're going through a shift right now you may or may not understand it but God is Shifting things around oh my bringing things into the rightful position do we trust him do we believe him Hallelujah well you know there's going to come times in our lives when there's going to be a great shift great changes are going to take place and that that that that that area where you say you trust him is going to be tested right to the Core this is the hour well if there's never been a day that God has to shift his bride amen is this the hour in this day amen Hallelujah what happened to the law when Jesus came Jesus does not say no part of the law will ever pass away he says no part of it shall pass away until is fulfilled in living a perfect life Jesus fulfilled the moral laws in his sacrificial death Jesus fulfilled the ceremonial laws Christ came not to destroy the old religious system but to build upon it he came to finish the old Covenant and establish the new the old Covenant where the shadows of good things to come that we're coming but not the reality we are in the hour of the reality of the word of God where the word of God is becoming a reality in our lives amen we don't want the word of God just to stay in in a in a place in our experience amen where it's just by law just by tradition just play rituals amen that most of the church world is doing out there but we want the reality of what God has spoken in this day through a prophet of the Living God we want the reality and in order for that amen you got to know truth because Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free Hallelujah first the Bible teaches plainly that Christians is not under the law of Moses the law was given to Israel Paul explains clearly in the book of Hebrews chapter 5 how the high priest in Israel was only a symbol of the real high priest Jesus Christ who made the ultimate atonement for our sins for all the people and then entered into the presence of his father secondly the Bible teaches that no man can meet the test of the law whether Jew or Gentile Every Man Has Broken the law as James says if we break even one law we're guilty of the whole law amen and that's what he was explaining how can you keep the law how can you keep the whole law because you break one you want to teach one you'll break and if you break one you break it all that's why it's by grace he knew that and even more so in this hour that we live in fact the Bible says in Romans that the purpose of the law was simply to reveal our sins it was not intended to be a medicine or treatment for sin or give us a recipe for reducing sin but the law came to expose our sin and that's what it does amen it exposes our sin to a T we would not know amen sin in our lives if we did not know the law for what the law has spoken amen Hallelujah but there's no way we could ever before and now ever keep the law that's why the great high priest Jesus Christ amen but we are still living in an hour in a day amen where God by Perfect Faith amen he is Shifting his bride in this hour from law to Grace because you know why law will never produce perfect Faith law will never produce the Rapture it's the grace of God by Faith by Revelation that is going to produce the body change in US and the Rapture is in us now changing us now every time you get experience every time you get a truth that sets you free inside of you that is the rapture changing you and you realize you know it you will you know when your you truth is being revealed to you because you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free so don't tell me you don't know that you're being set free from truth amen maybe truth is not being revealed to you and you need to get your life right maybe you need to repent in your life because truth you will know it sets you free Hallelujah you keep praying for me my saints of God as I'm battling up here to bring what God wants me to bring the Tabernacle in the temple where the holy Place made with hands but they were never meant to be permanent they were but copies of the true things Hebrews 9 24 the law had built in had a built-in expiry date being filled as it was external regulations applying until the time of the New Order Hebrews 9 11. but Christ being come a high priest of good things to come by greater and more by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building how much more shall the blood of Christ through the eternal spirit offer himself without spot to God Purge our conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God wow amen that's what it does my brothers and sisters that's our experience that the word when the word gets inside of you amen it does that that's what Grace is it purges our conscience from sin that we have no more conscious of sin dull sin is in this flesh and we make mistakes every day but it's different and separated that's what the new birth does it separates you the attribute from the flesh with inside and your conscience is purged by the blood the blood that cleanses us oh my Hallelujah you talk about an experience when you come into that and I'm not saying who is and who is not this morning but you come into that that changes your whole life when you come into a realization amen and experience every day you're walking that's why you don't worry that's why you don't fret that's why you don't fight amen your conscience that's where he goes the blood goes to your conscience and purges your conscience from all sin of this flesh I never did it in the first place or you can say it all you want but you walk outside these doors you make a mistake you're under the law you're condemned condemnation comes That's the Law that's not Grace that's the word of God but when your conscience has been purged amen you make a mistake you fall you're pressing towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus you're pressing on Amen you take the blood the atonement and wash this flesh but you yourself keep pressing on oh my you talk about confidence you can't preach confidence out there to you like he like he can do when he comes inside of you there's this kind of confidence amen is going to shake the world it's shaking the world now it's going to shift everything what's being preached today around the world the true Ministers of God Amen is putting every prophecy into place there's control in the world events that are taking place right now we are nothing then you're saying he is nothing we are weak then you're saying he is weak no no no not this man I know who he is and I'm getting to know him greater and greater Hallelujah one problem with the Eternal priest was that they were sinful they had to bring a sin offering for the people as well as a sin offering for themselves Jesus Christ did not bring any sin offering the scripture speaks of him in this manner for such a high priest was fitted for us who in the whole holy harmless undefiled separated from sinners and has become higher than the heavens unlike the other High Priestess he does not need any to offer any sacrifices day after day for his own sins and then for the sins of the people he sacrificed for their sins now listen oh my he sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself Hallelujah I can just stop right here and walk out that's so beautiful that's all we need that's all we need when you catch a revelation of that and that becomes real into your heart it's over the sin question is over the law is finished Grace has taken over Hallelujah glory to God for the law appoints and high priests men who are weak but the oath which came after the law appointed a son who has been made perfect forevermore Hebrews 7 26 the 28. Hallelujah John 3 3. Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God oh my I keep I keep on this amen I can't get away from this Amen in this hour and this day oh my Born Again free from sin amen I'm happy night and day Jesus said must must it's a must and the people in this message must get it must get the must it must be born again our experience must be a born-again experience to see or even to enter into the kingdom of God the word don't care the Rapture don't care the body didn't change don't care about how religious you are how much education you know how much message you read or how many tapes you listen to it don't care it looks for the blood tag God is looking for the blood tag oh my you don't think he doesn't know his own he knows his own he knows who he's speaking to him he knows what he's done in your life this week Hallelujah he knows where you're at he knows what you're thinking right now Hallelujah John 16 13. Hobbit when the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth you see the spirit of Truth people want to be guided by the law though in this message oh yes that's why the law legalism is so strong in this message they want to be guided by the law you hear people testifying you hear people speaking I'm talking message Believers brother Brian says you'll know in a few minutes a true son and daughter of God whether they got the holy ghost or not Hallelujah because you can hear them speaking oh they're testifying amen they're talking about the message but all it is is law law not the life of Jesus Christ not the experience I believe the same Jesus if he's in you he's in me he'll testify and confirm back and forth amen the word of God what he's doing in The Bride of Jesus Christ he's not only doing it to me he's not only doing it Pastor Simon Pastor Danny he's not only doing it all he's doing it in all the laity every single one of us amen hallelujahs fellowship and under the mystery the mystery oh it's a mystery until it's revealed to you but until that time it is a mystery oh like the Angel's desire to to to seek into it they desire to look in and see what said many people in this message are looking into the tapes looking into the letter of the word Desiring to see what's there but there are people that are predestinated that can see what's in there oh that's the short quick work my brothers and sisters is coming quickly upon us God is dealing oh you say oh brother you know this is just preaching I just come there oh God is dealing every service that we come in here every time we make a step of faith God is dealing with us and there's going to come a time where it's going to be finished the door is going to be closed it's going to be shut amen and God's going to do a short quick work he's going to manifest himself what he's been doing and revealing halleluia and the bride all these years he's going to do it I want every single one of you to be a part of it every single one of you I'm not preaching against nobody here in particular that's not my job I'm not the judge God knows his own Hallelujah if I can get your hearts to seek him Hallelujah the Holy Ghost makes Christ in charge and he inspires us to cease from our sinful works and we never desire to go back to them again the Holy Ghost is the inner teacher who enables us to understand the truth in the Bible when we read it he explains the scriptures to us the understanding of the scripture ends our unbelief completely Matthew 16 15 Simon Peter answered them and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona flesh and blood has not revealed it to you but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and we know it's built we heard this over and over built upon Faith revelation God revealing amen but we look at this scripture here and we look and we repeat it and repeat it even myself each and every one of us but when the spirit strikes you amen and realize what God is revealing to you how powerful it is first of all that's how he builds the Bride of Jesus Christ his church nothing else not on law not on education but upon faith upon Revelation and not only that the gates of hell shall not Prevail against it where's the gates of hell hallelujah it's right there in your life this is the Gate of Hell around your life when Revelation comes to you amen it breaks the gates of hell it opens the prison doors it breaks the chains upon your life but like Abraham you've got to step out on obedience by faith and take that Hallelujah glory to God now the uncovering brother Brown is speaking here and the revelation of Jesus Christ now the the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of Christ but it's the revelation of his Future Works in the coming seven Church ages the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be over emphasized it's everything you don't go nowhere you don't become nobody nothing without revelation Revelation to a True Believer this morning Maybe not maybe not to you maybe you're here maybe not to you it don't mean nothing but to a True Believer it can never you'd a True Believer this morning I know what you're doing amen you're seeking for God you're seeking for Revelation you're saying Lord God that's what I need amen that's what I need this morning not what my mind is telling me what I need what anybody else is telling me what I need but I need that I need Revelation this morning that's the most important thing in my life that I need Hallelujah because without it you got nothing with it you got

take it by the Hands of Faith in a person who believes can shake the world Shake Your World we need to take the word in this hour my brothers and sisters oh Satan is trying to make the church the bride lukewarm lazy and locked we gotta realize be aware of this there's a great battle going on there's a conflict between God and Satan here this morning for the soul for the soul man and woman the word of God through his servants are trying to pull you out of the darkness and into the light but your senses and your your mind that we all have you think totally different what's going on you're

what's happening this morning that's what happens every time we come into the house of God I don't come in here for a picnic I don't come in here to get pampered I come in here to battle for the word of God in my life oh for the grace of God to know the grace of God hallelujah I know I can't live by the law Hallelujah amen Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize I say to thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church in the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it Peter get that Revelation Peter you Peter this morning get that Revelation and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against you in your life Hallelujah Romans 8 3. for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sent in his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh Hallelujah Brother Brad speaking here I I'm still laying something here I'm still trying to get to where I'm going to get this morning so you keep praying you keep thirsting for God Amen I'm still battling up here Amen brother Brandon speaking in Grace the messes of Grace oh what a message of Grace amen it's not a message of law it's a message of Grace this morning it's the grace of God in our lives this morning amen oh Hallelujah Grace is old Grace is as old as the world is Grace was first shown to the human race when when we had the beginning of the human race when the human race was first created in the Garden of Eden on that dark morning when that little woman that stepped across the separating line and had gone against God's Commandments and enticed her husband to do the same thing then the law was broken you see join in church will never cover your sin join in a message church will never cover your sin no dry eye confession will ever cover sin it takes sorrow and repentance and the grace of God to cover your sins for the blood of Jesus Christ that once that God killed at Calvary to cover our sins they're in the garden that morning When sin was so black Jehovah come in there stood a couple stand and condemned there would be no human race they had died they had to die death on the human race give the world black to the back to the wild beasts and there would be no more human race but in that Darkest Hour in that time when all hope was gone Grace come pouring through and said I'll give you a savior a messiah oh it's a wonderful how God could ever do it think about it how God could ever do it the grace of God in our lives when we disobey when we Rebel amen when we go to the opposite direction that he's telling us to do our sins and our iniquities a rebellion the grace of God how can he do it I look in my own life if you don't see that in your own life you need to see that there's got to be sorrow and repentance I know that's in my life do I got great joy in the Lord and it is Grace but there's great sorrow and repentance because I see the sin I see the grace of God in my life and what he done oh my how could he ever do it God's Amazing Grace in the Garden of Eden that gave them the promise of the just one who could come through a woman the woman's seed shall bruise the Serpent's head the guilty one and his head shall bruise her heel showing that there will be an Affliction to the church but he promised Triumph he provided a savior he provided Grace that Grace is still here this morning he's still providing Grace in our lives oh my if it wasn't for the grace the grace of God in my life if it wasn't for grace for you look at what you've gone through look what you've been through look where he's took in you this morning Hallelujah amen thank you Lord okay let's start preaching now let's start preaching I still got a lot of time here I you know me I don't let you guys off the hook foreign you want to stand up you want to run around you want to praise God a little bit Shake yourselves go ahead it ain't going to bother me I'm going to preach just I'll probably preach louder than what you're screaming amen hallelujah I take my time I go if I'm going to sit all weekend and pray and and seek God and be on hours and hours on the computer looking for the word of God Amen and stand up here while you're sitting down sorry this time there's no Grace for you Hallelujah amen but we do it out of love amen if I didn't love you I would not have a right to be up here God would not put me up here God has shifted faith for the rapture God is Shifting you into position for the promise that you have been praying for sometime a god shift looks like a chaos a setback and even defeat but God is saying to you when the dust settles Hallelujah you will understand why you had to go through what you've been going through oh yes a god shift is the not easy it's not pleasant sometimes oh yes he's got a shift sometimes we go through hard things I look back at my life and I look the way I was thinking about the word the way I was applying the word the way I was speaking the word even the way I was acting the word was under law amen and God had to bring experiences in my life to shift me out of that condition amen he doesn't want me to walk by law he wants me to walk by grace in the grace of God we walk in Grace we walk in love we walk in harmony we walk in patience we walk in Temperance love and pray for one another encourage one another lift one another up when we walk by log we walk in criticism we're critical amen we're judgmental oh my don't tell me my brothers and sisters I come out of a lot of that and maybe I have to come out of more and I know you do too that's what he's shifting out of us amen oh Grace Grace the spirit of God is crying Grace this morning amen shifts are those changes in our thinking and our attitude that involves as we age sometimes making use of indirect methods to achieve something or spontaneous other times profound and life-changing these shifts can shake us to the very core of our being oh yeah if you're getting shooken to the very core your faith is being tested to the very core and lift your hands this morning and praise God Hallelujah that's why Peter says oh blessed are you amen when you're tempted and vile amen you win trials and tribulations come upon you the favor of God is there because he's shifting you into position amen and he's shifting you out of certain conditions to get into position Hallelujah so you can fulfill what he has for you to fulfill remember he said my word won't return to me void but it will accomplish amen I have sworn by myself this Covenant is not what we can do by the law but what he's already done so he's going to fulfill it the thing is will you surrender that's the battle oh sometimes all the struggle in our life all the hardships in our life we when the dust settles you realize it was just me fighting up if I would have just let go and let God let go of a lot of things a lot of ways in my life and just let God take his position and and what he wants to do but it's so hard for us it's so hard for us that's why I guess look at the sinless one Jesus in the garden Gethsemane even when he was getting tested by every Temptation that there is no one to man he said father if it be possible remove this cup from me but nevertheless amen I look at that and I say oh wow oh God hallelujah it's not easy but the grace of God when God comes your inside shifts every time you get an experience there's a shift that moves you in a different direction you do what do you want to start prospering in your life obedience to the voice of God start saying no to the things that you know that are not good for you and the people that are around you with the habits and traditions and rituals that they keep that they do in their lives that God is seeing separate from that then your life will change by the choices that you make to say no to the things that are just holding you down from going higher that's a that's a place where God in this hour he's not going to force you he's not going to force nothing on you amen he's going to let you see it for yourself free more agency has never been greater than this hour in this day that's how he predestinates because he foreknows you he knows every choice from beginning to end he's the author and the finisher he knows every choice that you're going to make Hallelujah along your life journey in your path God has spoken he has shifting and changing things in your life God is in the reset button and transforming everything in your life in your heart in your mind those were expecting a Harvest on a seed sowing must now prepare their vessels God is changing our angle and how we see things on a level of Faith a perfect faith that is changing us because the season has changed we are in a different season my brothers and sisters everything is shifting in the world within our lives here this morning things are shifting God is set in and ready to move this bride to another level in this hour he has to it doesn't matter which man is standing here or anywhere else God has a word to fulfill he has a Rapture to complete amen and that's what he's doing in this hour Hallelujah being chained to Life's disappointments circumstances Bound in these mental shackles causes anger and bitterness you prayed and plead to God to deliver you from this evil Taskmaster but is our hearts and Minds truly open to God's Direction we need to be true to ourselves more than ever before you talk about honesty honesty is of hard to find in this hour even amongst believers to be honest listen if you can't be honest with God truly honest with God how can you be honest with your brothers and sisters you can't be Hallelujah because even in the wilderness of Our Lives where there is no surprises to God God is all seeing omnipresent and he's seen what's going on around you and around your life life's continuous circle of emotion and mental frustration and now he's saying like he said to Israel you tread this rut in this wrong direction long enough amen you know people are still going through that mental frustration depression anxiety yes those things are real those things are real but do you believe God is greater than those things oh yes he is it's not it's not God's uh fault or God's issue like everybody in the world they're always when something bad in the world happens they always blame God always blame God and I always say so there's no devil eh there's an old devil that does evil it's just God well my Bible says and my experience says and the God that I know is good and he's good all the time amen his grace is good all the time amen so I I when I look at my own life and I see things in my own life you know where it comes depression and anxiety and all these things come most of the time is self-pity we pity ourselves too much then we get into an emotional state amen those are spirits amen that we got to recognize and cast away from us it's our choices in our mind what we choose to believe what we choose to feed on in this hour listen no matter how dark it gets I choose to believe in the light I choose to believe there's a light at the end of the tunnel Hallelujah no matter how sick I get I choose to believe in healing oh yes I choose to believe in it no matter how bound I feel I choose to believe in Deliverance because his word has testified over and over and he has demonstrated it in my life so many times that he is more than able not able but more than able to do what he said he was going to do in my life and he's more than able to do what he's going to do in your life depression can't stand in the presence of God anxiety sickness can't stand in the presence of God death can't even stand in his presence the problem is we need to get into his presence we need to repent and get in his presence and turn our lives around moving and trying to work this out work that out intellectually trying to figure things out in our lives when God his word is standing right here Deliverance standing right here especially as Christians believe in the word of God Hallelujah he's our savior look at Paul's life God shifts Paul's life when the light knocked him off his high horse oh yes don't worry if you're a child of God you're like Paul you're on a high horse of life right now God's going to knock you off amen look what it did for Paul though Paul found his true identity in that experience he found this true identity you know sometimes when it gets hard it gets confusing things are shifting so much in our lives we realized like we said when the dust settles we find our true identity we find who we really are we think we know who we are but until God comes and shows us who we are Paul found this true identity in that experience he had when the voice of God spoke to him when a shift comes God is moving you in a different direction for his purpose there is no greater shift that can happen to a person outside the new birth being born again you talk about a shift you talk about your life being the chaos and all upside down when you're truly born again Hallelujah I know when I was born again all hell broke loose I didn't even know there was so much hell around my life amen I mean everybody came against me everybody's tried to tell me that this was a lie amen every demon in Hell tried to keep me in the Catholic church and under the traditions of thy law amen bound up by the sin in my life oh but I know amen like the song says oh I know that I've been born again I know that I've been set free amen Born Again Hallelujah and set free by the grace of God hallelujah glory to God Amen oh Hallelujah it turns everything upside down in your life and puts You On A New Path of life oh you might feel uncomfortable things might be uncertain oh I might look out of order Hallelujah there's somebody here that needs this this morning it might look out of order amen the way it used to look or the way you used to act or used to believe but all things are shifted in your mind in your heart sometimes a god shift can feel very very confusing you say oh the devil's the author of confusion yeah we know that we know that the devil's a liar too amen but sometimes when God is Shifting we don't understand everything it could seem like chaos a confusion in our lives Hallelujah that's where we need to have faith like Abraham when Abraham was called out you don't think he wasn't confused you don't think that he didn't know but he know he heard the voice of God that's all he knew he knew God said go to a to a land which I will show you and that's what God is saying to us I know you don't understand everything in your life but go and I'll show you as you walk amen as we walk up that that shining way brother I'm seeing the bride walk in and step with the gospel amen as we walk it will unfold to us hallelujah that's what it means by walking by faith we don't know everything we don't understand everything but we move and operate by faith hallelujah amen when you feel everything is falling apart it can make you feel like you're losing everything how many feel that I felt like I was losing everything everything that I knew in my life everything that I built in my life when this new birth came I felt like I was losing everything but you know what it was the greatest feeling in my life because you know at the same time where Everything feels confusing every everything you feel like you're losing everything amen you feel like you're gaining the everything because you're gaining him and as he reveals himself listen when he reveals himself to you there is a love of God there's a grace of God that that that comes into your life that overpowers everything and 32 years later amen I've gone through ups and downs ins and outs amen hallelujah if it wasn't for the grace of God it wouldn't be standing here this morning but that love that first love is even greater in my heart him in my heart more than ever before you that's not law my brothers that's the grace of God hallelujah when your mindset shifts your life shifts that's why he says put on the mind of Christ God says think on these things and put your mind on Christ When You Say Yes to God God leads you and everything around you shifts into position to fulfill the word of God and he places inside of you and that's why he said that my word will not return void the greatest shift that is going on today is the rapture God wants to finish the work that he started in this age he came and he sent the prophet and delivered a message of perfect faith and listen my brothers and sisters God is more determined than ever before to finish what he has spoken through a prophet in a people brother Branham Cried Out many times because he's seen the condition of the people and you can look at the condition of the people in the message today but he cried out and he said there will be a bride because God spoke to rubia bride he didn't care about the condition of the people he looked at the Prophecies of the word of God and said there will be a bride and let me tell you this morning by the grace of God by the grace and grace alone there will be a bride in these last days there will be a perfect faith that will manifest in a people today there will be my brothers and sisters there will be such an overcoming power sweeping over her in her life oh my the world's never going to see it like this again when this happens amen thank you Lord Hallelujah Deuteronomy 2 2. Moses stated that the Lord spoke to him and said you have compassed this mountain long enough turn northwards look up look up go ahead watch them in the wilderness moving along around the border of the promise there's no more moving around the border of This Promise of this word of God in this hour God has watched this bride he's watched this message long enough now he's speaking by faith to the individuals and says turn northward look up it's no more wandering around the border of these promises but now it's time to manifest these promises now I'm shifting you into gear I'm shifting you into a different direction amen you're going into Cadence land and you're going to manifest the word that I've spoken in this hour this is the time in the day that God is going to do it oh man great preachers are not going to do it but the Holy Ghost is here he's going to do it he's going to do it in this hour oh my I'm so glad he's determined I'm so glad his grace His Amazing Grace in this hour I'm so glad that he pushes me through the pipe I'm so God he pulls on me when I need to be pulled on I'm so glad Hallelujah oh my God Amen and he's getting getting ready to have them turn northward to go and inherit the promise of Canaan Hallelujah God's purpose for this Divine shift was to move them back on track because they've lost their spiritual Direction what what we got all the tapes we got all the Bible and you lose your spiritual Direction yes it could happen when you get your eyes off of Jesus oh simple eh a simple statement get your eyes off of Jesus but we let so many things distract us and get our Focus off of what he called us to do his purpose has not changed since the New Birth has hit your life if the New Birth has hit your life it has not changed the purpose is the kingdom of God press into the kingdom of God we are here to press into the kingdom to manifest the kingdom Amen to do his will in our lives and that's how we lose our spiritual Direction have I lost my spiritual rejection yes we all have it's all part of brother Brownstein the bride getting out of line and screamed in the spirit stay in line and the spirit will speak to us in our lives amen and that's why there's some shifts in certain turmoils that come in your life get back in line Hallelujah this is not your purpose what you're concentrating on what you're going after in life that is more important than the word of God is not your purpose God's will for your life his word that he has spoken to your heart is his purpose she loves to repent like David don't think I Repent I still repent I don't care how much faith I got I don't care who you are we all children of God repent because we all constantly we're in a flesh we're in a dimension here that we need to get back in line constantly as you grow and you mature and all you're doing is yielding yourself to the Holy Spirit more and more in your life as you mature you repent less because you stay in line more Hallelujah amen during this Divine shift God told Moses that they needed to turn Earth northward to complete their 40-year Journey that should have taken 11 days think about it think about the Revelation behind this do you think God wanted them to go 40 years because he said in his word it should have taken 11 days he wanted 11 days God you know God wants to move this thing but God all know and knows everything he knows everything he knows the timing of everything in our lives that's why God's timing whether you think is right or wrong is always perfect because he knows it but also God has a desire in his heart amen and that 11 days is what God desires and God desires for you not to take 40 years or four years or whatever to go through the same thing over and over again he desires 11-day process for you to come into this land that he's promised you but their stubbornness their Rebellion their disobedience caused the 40 years that wasn't on God listen so despite their complaining their Disobedience they're murmuring and sinning God's mercy and Grace guided them to inherit the promise they were about to walk into their wealthy place so God's Divine shift Ed them from complacency to display a friendly and pleasant manner emotionally mentally and spiritually he changed their character so that their personality can come alive he doesn't change their personality he changes your character so that your personality can come alive you see somebody who's bound up in their personality oh there's a lot of people like that they're bound up they're quiet they're unsociable even like I forget the name of it what they call these people that like like to be by themselves all the time why because there's a character flaw God wants to get into that character amen and deal with that character transform that character brother Brian says the only thing that we take with us is our character that's how we're known by and our personality reflects our character Hallelujah God has shifting us from law to Grace the just shall live by faith you cannot mix law and Grace in this hour and expect to walk in perfect harmony with the Holy Spirit and expect perfect faith Galatians 3 23 but before Faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto Faith which should afterwards be revealed therefore the law was our Schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith has come we are no longer under the Schoolmaster Hallelujah Jesus came and there was a big shift in his hour in his day when he came to fulfill the law and declare it was over by faith in him that's what he did you know that eh he declared it over but do we understand that we need to understand that God is trying to reveal that to you because walking in Grace in this hour is the only victory that we can have to produce this word he declared it over they wanted the law so much think about it they wanted the law so much that they killed him for it they killed him for the law oh my people want the law of this message so much they're crucifying Jesus Christ again they're killing him for the law I stand here I know have to answer for what I say but I know what I see that's why Paul rebuked Peter for trying to make the Gentiles live like the Jews our Prophet came in the same mess that Jesus had in this day law and Grace all mixed up by the opening of the seals the bride sets her free to live by faith that's why this message is the message of Grace not of law you see brother Brandon was sent as a seven Church age messenger into the seven Church age and that's where the mess was and the process of the word of God from law to Grace even in this hour in this day was manifested through a prophet where the Bible became a new Bible to him when those seals open everything became Grace Amazing Grace in his life yes he was a seven Church age messenger to the seven Church age which isn't was in a mess at that time think about it my brothers and sisters think about the process think about the transition I won't say certain things that will stumble people but that's what happened in this hour in this day there was a process a shifting out of the seven Church age to the Eternal Church age out of the seven Church age Messenger to the Eternal messenger Jesus Christ and this Jesus Christ in this hour is the same one that was back there that came and said I have come not to destroy the law but I have come to fulfill the law there's the same Christ in this hour Hallelujah that's what it is the grace of God the grace the god that brought forth a shadow God brought Grace into our lives by his love for us here's something else Grace Can't Do Grace cannot be bought Grace cannot be sold it's Grace and by a sovereign one you cannot bargain for it you can't say God if you do this if I'll do this and so and so you'll do this you can't do that God won't do it you can't pull nothing out of God God gives it by his grace and his grace alone Hallelujah nothing but Grace Hallelujah Galatians 3 10. I'm winding it down I still got 15 minutes for as many as are under the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is everyone that continent not in all the things which are written in the book of the law to do them the curse of the law never made people into better people when they did these works another curse is that it's impossible for a person to keep every law all the time however many laws you keep if you break one law then you're in trouble of all the law the law was like a chain with many links one link broken snapped the whole chain is broken Galatians 3 13 Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hanging on a tree the biggest curse of the law is that it told us what sin was but it never took away from us the desire to sin law will never do that and never Purge your conscience Colossians Colossians 2 14 blotting out the handwriting of ordinance that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to the cross Hallelujah you see brother Brad I'm speaking here and perfect faith here was the apostles in the time Walking With Jesus and he gave them power he gave the church power but here it is again my brothers and sisters how important faith is to us you can have all the gifts all the power but no faith to operate that power then what good is it Jesus had given them power to heal the sick to raise the dead think about it it's all good isn't it good to raise the dead heal the sick cast out Devils it is good just a few days before that they had the power but not the faith to use the power there's a church the bride today the holy spirit is here with the power but you haven't got the faith to move it we need faith we need understanding in God's will in our lives the grace of God to move it that's the most important thing in this hour to move this thing forward then move it forward in your life is faith that's why it's you don't even realize how important it is to you more than all these things Hallelujah the holy spirit is here with the power but you need the faith to move it see what I mean it takes Faith to move it it takes What It Takes see perfect Faith to ignite the power the Holy Ghost which we have now since he's come upon us Faith to unite it to see great things to see great things Faith to know that you are free by the grace of God Faith to sing the song Thank God I am free free free from this world of sin I'm washed in the blood of Jesus I've been born again my brothers and sisters that never gets old that we are free by the grace of God we are free this morning Hallelujah you know with that kind of Faith Jesus lived in a world that nobody knew he lived in a world of perfect Faith walking and operating my brothers and sisters that's what he says when the bride comes into this kind of faith when the bride comes into this kind of Grace in her life and she surrenders to it she lives in a world that nobody understands don't try to explain I'm I'm done with trying to explain this world that I'm walking in you see the outward man but there's an inward man that's walking with God every day walking in the grace of God every day Hallelujah let us fight the musicians up amen I just feel the spirit this is enough Hallelujah like I said I'm just laying a foundation for this I want to read a quote here it's a pretty lengthy quote from the message of Grace but there's a great story behind this I think this is our story this is the bride story Hallelujah they put him in into the Inner Cell they locked the doors they put pads on it the guards all around it because we know what kind of horrible punishment this boy was going to receive because he killed the King's son the Royal King's son stripped with nothing but loincloth on him and there he was sit there in that condition that was us my brothers and sisters starving wouldn't give him nothing to eat you think those denominations would give you anything to eat then they brought him out for trial he was found guilty and proven guilty and the sentence was made that he was to be executed under horrible capital punishment he was to be killed by inches until his mortal life was gone sentenced by the judge he was to die and he begged and he cried and he said though I am guilty I am sorry for what I did I wish I had never done it in a moment of rage and temper I did it I didn't mean to do it that way one day the king went down to that place to visit the boy and talk with him and tell him about killing his own son the only son he had I'm so glad the king came down he came down into my life he reached down into the myri clay for me and you and when he went down there he looked back in that cage like a cage in an animal and saw a little skinny body laying there in the corner crying his face all sunk in his Jaws sat back his eyes weighed back mattered was all in his eyes and his mouth was all whitened over no water thirsty laying back there on his face crying the king said stand up come to me and he looked at him and said why did you kill my son what did my son do what did he do to marriage such a death as you killed him stabbing him to death with a spear he said nothing my Lord not one thing just my own ways that's what killed Jesus Christ our own ways our own sin I killed him because I was jealous of him I got into a temper fit and I killed him now I'm to the die under your Justice sir and I realize that I deserve it the only thing that I'm crying for is that I'm just sorry that I killed that Royal man like that Without a Cause you see his repentance you see his heart he knew he deserved judgment he knew he deserved to die but he was sorry he was repented that he'd kill the King's son oh my my brothers and sisters the spirit of God to say and repent somebody repent God is crying out only thing I'm crying in just sorry I killed that man the king turned on his heels and walked out and went to the desk and said destroy all the records you see what moved the king the king's heart destroy all the records you know put them in the sea of forgetfulness destroy all the records and wash him up clean him up and set him down a robe for him oh God thank you Lord no Holy Ghost washing us cleansing us oh my after a while that great limousine drove up to the door all the Chariots amen that great Chariot I took Elijah away in the Rapture amen Hallelujah amen when it did the carpet was spread out of that prison cell the king stood at the end of the limousine and said come my son ride home with me to that Palace put the king's robe around his shoulder and he said from henceforth you are my son Hallelujah because he had pity that's Grace that's amazing grace at that time it was me it was you we killed the Son of God with our sins we were alienated dirty filthy lying in the cells of this world God washed Us by his blood by his own son cleansed us put the role of the Holy Ghost around us now the great Chariot of God will come back to the door someday and we'll go home and live with him all records are destroyed we can't be judged no more burn them up he put them in the sea of forgetfulness and remember about them no more no wonder we can sing Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound let's save the wrets like me I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see oh my the grace of God perfect faith in this hour perfect realization perfect understanding that God has given us through the word through the spirit of his word brings us into a shift shift in US remember Jesus said I come not to destroy the law and I'm not here to destroy the law this morning but there's something greater than the law amen there's something greater that we need in the law to bring us into this perfect faith this perfect realization this transformation that's going to take place in our lives perfect faith in the body change cannot come that change cannot come unless there's a great shift in our own personal lives from law to Grace amen let us stand God's Amazing Grace Hallelujah God has spoken to your heart this morning some way Hallelujah didn't expect it to go the way it did but that's the way it is the Holy Spirit Spirit knows what he's speaking into your hearts this morning my brothers and sisters there's a shift going on there's a move of God going on in this hour God has taken his bride I believe with all my heart to another level because all prophecy is coming to pass in this hour [Music] and it's going to take Grace [Music] it's going to take Grace in this hour like never before Amazing Grace that's why we're going to be crying Grace Grace God's grace how did you make it through this age how did you overcome all the deception of the pale horse

always for the grace for the grace [Music] I was so lost [Music] Walking Dead [Music] just a moment uh your conscious I'm sure if you're spiritual your conscience your conscience let us our brother was bringing the message of moving from perfect from the law in the perfect faith that he and you actually had a battle with the spirit of law Spirit of law fighting against your minds while he was trying to bring the word of God and personally as a preacher as a minister standing here he had a personal battle and every Minister usually have that battle to be able to translate what God has revealed to you that's in your spirit and to be able to put an impressions that will bring a clear understanding and revelation who are the listeners that was a battle and I can see that our brother battled with the devil so that your prayers were very necessary remember always when you come to church we are not here to be just spectators because the preacher is not here to put on a show or a performance for you but your faith is what stirs up the gift so um it's necessary you get behind the preacher and stir up the gift that is in that preacher now uh let me shift from that now our brother I'll speak in the general sense was really trying to convey to you that just as Moses brought the children of Israel out of Egypt and they wandered around for 40 years and then they came to the river God also sent a prophet who told us in plain terms that he came and uh you know Dr Moses many sermons that he mentioned about how his ministry was like the ministry of Moses and he was leading Us by the message that we have received under the seven Church ages it's right behind me right and so from uh Grace on the Paul then it went into darkness after that it went into a lot little by little until we got back to the seventh Church age where this Prophet was trained to uh reinstate Grace in its original position but meanwhile he had a battle and even after he brought his message and left a message people's perception of the message is as if the message was a message of law where um well the prophet said this so I'm going to do it uh you know the prophet said that so I've got to do it you you then the preachers and the people on the message began to obey or follow the message not by grace that God puts in their heart but by the spirit of law that was upon them but we are no more under that Spirit of love we are under the grace of God we're not under a curse we've been freed from the curse because Jesus nailed that on the tree himself praise the Lord what I'm saying to you briefly here now is that you you are free and there's nobody here watching to see the length of your dress watching to see this or that but God is trusting that you by following his word of yourself not because the preacher tells you to not the preacher appears to be uh fiery or powerful and he says no nobody comes in here dressed like that wearing their hair like this or that or that's wonderful doesn't want that what he wants is for you yourself to allow the word of God to shape you make you mold you transform you for you to become what he wants you to be by God's power to transform now um we know that we have come through the seven Church ages we are now just to Elijah Spirit of Bradley kindness and we are crossing over the river some have already crossed but crossing over the river from the time element into the Eternal Capstone age now we understand that when that happens Moses was dead Moses my servant is dead now Joshua has to take you over Joshua types the Holy Spirit you know that what I'm saying is now you're under the grace of God led by the Holy Spirit taking you into the land to possess your possessions and if you look in the Bible one of the cities that Joshua had to go take was the city of what a I yes he went to take the city of A.I and that was their battle at the first battle that they had to fight in this new age and the new time the new land that they were entering in and now we find that the battle for you as the Joshua generation of this message is to come against the spirit of a i that is now coming into the world or you want me to say playing artificial intelligence that is what your you as Joshua generation will have a great deal to do with and you're going to have to battle with myself and the other preachers from following a message and bringing it to this time we know about it but we're not into that that is really not our age I can manipulate some of that stuff you know but that is not my age it's not my time it's your time and see our season and you're going to have to deal with that so I'm just letting you know that that that was not just a simple message it's just for you to understand what was being said behind all that was uh given to you may the Lord bless each one of you thank you for being here we appreciate your presence and we invite you to return Wednesday night and on Sunday when we
