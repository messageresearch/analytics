[11:53] holy spirit we have to do amount of

[14:14] so you just took away their be their
[14:49] problem everything and sometimes that
[14:56] the brother-sister themselves may walk
[14:58] away and then also their problem solve
[15:00] but they don't connected with the
[15:04] possibly that happened and so all this
[15:07] supernatural is going on undercover
[15:11] simply and humbly because we have not
[15:18] fully shared it and because the spirit
[15:22] that's always looking for outward sign
[15:25] and as an exhilarating one something
[15:30] startling for them to be
[15:33] naturally and that's America oh my god

[15:39] hope and I pray for that person their
[15:41] real thing is you know even one and part
[15:43] of the motive for anybody you know
[15:47] people wanna know that you were
[15:49] responsible because you start for

[17:03] knows he has a member there that stick
[17:06] also and he just fires him within the
