[48:53] and without wasting much time
[48:56] i'll let's take our scriptures and read
[49:00] matthew chapter 6 verse 28 to 34
[49:04] and jeremiah 1 5.
[49:18] if you found it you say amen
[49:28] okay he said in matthew chapter 6 verse
[49:32] 28 to 34
[49:34] it says that
[49:36] and why
[49:39] take your thoughts
[49:41] for arraignment
[49:43] consider the release of the field
[49:46] how they grow
[49:48] they told not
[49:50] neither do they spend
[49:55] and yet i say unto you that even solomon
[49:59] in all his glory was not arrayed like
[50:02] one of these because solomon's clothes
[50:05] has no life
[50:06] but they nearly have life in them
[50:09] amen
[50:10] praise god continue wherefore if god
[50:14] so clothed the grass of the field
[50:17] which today is
[50:19] and tomorrow is cast into the oven
[50:22] shall he not much more clothe you
[50:26] oh ye of little faith
[50:30] therefore
[50:32] take no thoughts
[50:34] saying
[50:36] what we should eat
[50:38] because we live economic crisis now
[50:41] and god is encouraging you
[50:43] that don't look at the condition at the
[50:45] present time
[50:47] and look to him
[50:48] amen or what shall we drink
[50:51] or where with us shall we be clothed
[50:56] for after all these things
[50:59] do the gentiles seek
[51:02] those who are christ
[51:04] that's all that they seek
[51:06] because they have no hope
[51:08] amen we have hope in christ
[51:11] amen
[51:15] for your heavenly father
[51:19] knows
[51:20] that you have need of all these things
[51:24] but seek ye first
[51:26] the kingdom of god and his righteousness
[51:28] and all these things shall be added unto
[51:31] you
[51:32] take therefore no thought for tomorrow
[51:35] for the morrow shy thick thought for the
[51:38] things of itself
[51:41] sufficient of the day is evil thereof
[51:44] jeremiah 1 5.
[51:59] jeremiah is after isaiah
[52:03] before i formed thee
[52:06] in the belly
[52:07] i knew thee
[52:09] and before thou comest forth out of the
[52:12] womb
[52:13] i sanctified thee
[52:16] and i will then be
[52:19] and i know then be a prophet
[52:23] unto the nations
[52:25] if our title that
[52:29] nothing can hinder your purpose your
[52:32] purpose will be achieved no matter what
[52:35] the circumstances let's pray oh our
[52:38] gracious eternal god we thank you for
[52:40] the privilege you have given to us to be

[52:55] through me to be a blessing to your
[52:57] children i pray god if there's anything

[53:03] holy ghost bend every trace anything all

[53:11] wives oh god i pray that
[53:14] i take every spirit under my country in
[53:16] the name of jesus may the spirit of
[53:19] christ have reminisce
[53:21] oh god the purpose of preaching is the
[53:24] lord that people's hearts
[53:26] need to be met so i pray in the name of
[53:29] jesus you that knows the heart of the
[53:32] people you that knows what they are
[53:34] desiring this morning may you please
[53:37] speak to their heart desire and
[53:39] encourage us and increase our faith we
[53:42] thank you
[53:44] may you be seated
[53:46] hallelujah
[53:48] um
[53:49] grace can you put on the kingsman
[53:52] redeemer for me
[53:53] 61-02
[53:56] he said
[53:58] consider the illness of the field
[54:01] how they toil
[54:03] and spain
[54:04] neither neither i say
[54:08] i say and yes solomon of all his glory
[54:12] a lily has to struggle
[54:14] day and night
[54:17] to get the radiance
[54:19] to keep his garments
[54:22] to keep the perfume
[54:24] and things going
[54:26] and others he just opened himself
[54:29] and they come up and take it out of him
[54:33] the bee and the flying everything comes
[54:36] by good
[54:38] or bad just take from him
[54:41] that's the way the servant is
[54:44] of christ the christian servant
[54:47] opens himself up
[54:49] just take from me the world
[54:52] there's nothing for himself
[54:55] it's for the others
[54:57] that's what christ became
[55:00] when he became king false race
[55:02] he became man
[55:04] that the world might partake of his
[55:06] righteousness in the mid sense of god
[55:10] and i think
[55:11] one more
[55:14] and as he said said one time consider
[55:17] the lewis and yet i say unto you that
[55:19] solomon
[55:20] identified masterpiece of god
[55:22] and as
[55:23] and as yet i saw unto you that solomon
[55:26] all of his glory was not arrayed like
[55:29] one solomon in all of his glory was a
[55:32] magnificent sight there is no doubt
[55:36] it was a great thing to the world and a
[55:39] great man before god the solomon's robe
[55:42] as i said didn't have no life in it
[55:45] it was a piece of material probably shed
[55:48] of a sheep's back
[55:50] but they really
[55:51] had life
[55:53] what we need today is the life of christ
[55:56] inside of us
[55:58] that's what purifies
[56:01] not the art world
[56:03] a thin around color or a degree
[56:05] psychology or something it takes the
[56:08] power
[56:09] of the resurrected christ to make us
[56:12] what
[56:13] we should be
[56:14] god has no other plan
[56:17] than let the holy spirit rule
[56:19] and reign
[56:21] in the church
[56:22] amen so if the holy ghost is the one
[56:25] that is ruling
[56:27] and reigning in the church
[56:30] then
[56:32] that church nothing can hinder its
[56:35] purpose
[56:36] so as
[56:38] i started with the lilies
[56:40] the lilies have life
[56:43] but the lilies
[56:44] has
[56:46] a purpose
[56:47] and a toys night and day
[56:50] to achieve that purpose
[56:53] and if someone is passing by
[56:56] and smells the perfume
[56:59] of that lily that lily has served its
[57:03] purpose
[57:04] amen
[57:05] so it's you and me
[57:08] when we are out there
[57:10] when people are i need dying left and
[57:13] right
[57:15] people have no hope
[57:18] they are grieved
[57:19] the economy shambles
[57:23] some their children
[57:24] in despair
[57:27] they are going through a lot of turmoil
[57:30] but just a smile from you
[57:32] just some word of encouragement
[57:35] it lifted someone's heart up
[57:38] and i encourage you today
[57:40] i'll just keep on on it till i finish
[57:43] tonight this
[57:44] this afternoon or this morning
[57:47] that
[57:48] unless god is finished with you
[57:52] whatever god has purposed in your life
[57:56] it will come to pass
[57:58] amen
[58:00] nothing can hinder it
[58:02] amen one time
[58:05] god made a promise to abraham he said
[58:08] after 400 yes
[58:11] i will bring your people out
[58:14] from the from the bondage
[58:16] and that country that deal with that i'm
[58:19] going to deal with that
[58:22] promise was lying there
[58:24] for for so many years
[58:27] when that 400 years came
[58:30] god didn't wait for moses to be born
[58:32] he knew moses is going to fulfill that
[58:34] part
[58:35] amen
[58:37] praise god
[58:38] hallelujah
[58:42] and
[58:43] before moses was born
[58:46] you know what
[58:47] the devil is dumping on me anyway
[58:51] because
[58:53] everything went for god's purpose
[58:57] god wanted to be a savior
[59:00] he wanted to be a healer
[59:03] but the devil thought that he was going
[59:04] to trick eve to commit adultery
[59:07] not knowing that he was going to let
[59:10] god's purpose come to pass
[59:12] amen so is the devil doing
[59:16] because before moses was born
[59:18] the devil was mad
[59:21] there arose a pharaoh
[59:23] who did not know joseph
[59:26] there is going to be a pharaoh there is
[59:28] going to be and i think we are just in
[59:31] that time
[59:32] who does not know freedom of religion
[59:36] amen
[59:37] hallelujah and
[59:39] brethren and sisters
[59:42] they don't know the freedom of religion
[59:45] but
[59:47] what god has deposited inside of us
[59:50] a to
[59:52] fight that battle
[59:54] because what i'm trying to say
[59:56] is that
[59:59] what god does
[1:00:02] he placed himself in that man
[1:00:05] so
[1:00:06] he'll place some faith inside of us
[1:00:09] he'll do something for us to be able to
[1:00:11] encounter that spirit how are you gonna
[1:00:14] fight it i don't know
[1:00:17] because
[1:00:18] i believe that
[1:00:20] god has a plan
[1:00:22] and his plan
[1:00:24] was that moses was going to fulfill that
[1:00:26] part and god also for this purpose
[1:00:30] pharaoh was
[1:00:31] was created
[1:00:34] for his heart to be hidden
[1:00:36] so god has a plan god has a purpose
[1:00:40] the devil tried to go ahead of god's
[1:00:42] plan
[1:00:43] and a pharaoh razor
[1:00:46] that fellow did not know joseph he
[1:00:48] started to put them in slavery
[1:00:51] put hardship on the people
[1:00:53] and he made the law
[1:00:55] what i'm trying to say is that
[1:00:58] we are christians
[1:01:01] and we are law abiding people
[1:01:04] we obey the loss of the land
[1:01:08] but if the laws of the land is contrary
[1:01:11] to this word of god we go by this
[1:01:14] amen i believe that's faith
[1:01:18] that was deposited
[1:01:20] in
[1:01:21] moses mom and dad
[1:01:23] and they were not scared
[1:01:24] of the law of the land
[1:01:27] because
[1:01:28] the devil controls the world i'm not
[1:01:30] saying that every politician is from the
[1:01:32] devil but remember
[1:01:34] when
[1:01:36] he met god on that desert on that month
[1:01:39] temptations
[1:01:40] he told him that i'll give you all the
[1:01:42] world it means that he controls the
[1:01:44] world
[1:01:45] not everybody in the policies is from
[1:01:47] him but he controls them
[1:01:50] amen so he controls so
[1:01:52] when he tries to use that medium
[1:01:56] to bring loss against this
[1:02:00] and when that thing came
[1:02:03] me um moses mom and dad
[1:02:06] were from the
[1:02:08] priesthood from the land of levi
[1:02:11] they were not scared of the lord
[1:02:14] they didn't care what pharaoh was saying
[1:02:18] they are praised for the delivery
[1:02:20] the bible says that people will seek my
[1:02:22] face and cry and repent
[1:02:25] i will hear their prayer
[1:02:28] so the children of israel they began to
[1:02:30] pray
[1:02:31] i believe that moses mom and dad began
[1:02:33] to pray
[1:02:34] and as hardship is going i believe every
[1:02:36] christian is beginning to pray
[1:02:38] amen they began to pray and pray
[1:02:41] and while god gave them the son
[1:02:44] they were not scared about the law of
[1:02:46] the land
[1:02:47] we thank god for those midwives
[1:02:50] from the jewish language they said
[1:02:53] we cannot do that
[1:02:54] and kill all the male children no we are
[1:02:56] not doing that
[1:02:58] and they said oh king pharaoh before we
[1:03:01] get there they deliver so fast so we
[1:03:03] can't do nothing about them
[1:03:06] and frank got so mad
[1:03:08] so he took that loss between her into
[1:03:10] his own hand
[1:03:11] and let the egyptians do their job
[1:03:14] to kill every male child
[1:03:17] oh man
[1:03:18] when moses mom was not scared
[1:03:21] his dad was not scared
[1:03:23] they kept their child
[1:03:25] for three months
[1:03:26] amen and you know what
[1:03:29] they were not scared to put them in that
[1:03:31] river now
[1:03:32] even though there was scorpions there
[1:03:34] could be allegations there'll be
[1:03:36] everything in there now
[1:03:38] their faith was so much in god that they
[1:03:41] believed that god will save their son
[1:03:44] they will have that confidence in their
[1:03:47] god that is more than able
[1:03:49] to take care of their son
[1:03:51] amen i believe that the crocodiles
[1:03:54] and all the other river day when they
[1:03:56] saw moses they ran away because why
[1:03:59] god's angels were protecting his gift
[1:04:01] amen because he has to fulfill that
[1:04:04] question
[1:04:05] nobody else
[1:04:07] can fulfill that portion
[1:04:09] and no one can take your place whatever
[1:04:12] god has told you to fulfill brad gabriel
[1:04:15] you will fulfill it
[1:04:17] no demons in hell
[1:04:19] can come against that fulfillment
[1:04:22] it will come to pass
[1:04:24] one day
[1:04:26] although it might once they said that
[1:04:28] mission would long whatever the soul
[1:04:30] come to pass
[1:04:32] amen so their parents were not scared
[1:04:35] hallelujah
[1:04:38] oh man i'm so excited
[1:04:41] how god
[1:04:43] was so
[1:04:45] mindful
[1:04:46] of escaped
[1:04:48] how god protect you in the womb of your
[1:04:50] mama many affairs who have been
[1:04:53] time before we've been born by the
[1:04:56] spirit of christ protected us all these
[1:04:59] years
[1:05:00] and that strength was protecting moses
[1:05:03] and the good part of it is that
[1:05:06] god
[1:05:08] allowed
[1:05:10] moses mom to train
[1:05:12] her own son
[1:05:14] and be paid for that
[1:05:16] man
[1:05:17] what a god that we are serving
[1:05:22] he protected your son
[1:05:24] and he let you get paid
[1:05:26] for raising your old son
[1:05:29] man
[1:05:31] don't you love this mighty god
[1:05:34] amen when in the midst of tribulation
[1:05:39] when there was a farming in egypt there
[1:05:41] was a food in goshen
[1:05:43] and i said that we're going out with
[1:05:45] what a great substance the first
[1:05:48] exercise they went with great substance
[1:05:51] we are living with great substance you
[1:05:53] say but i feel it with this economic
[1:05:55] condition i don't know how we're going
[1:05:57] to go but my faith is in the word of god
[1:06:01] i believe god with all my heart because
[1:06:04] you know what faith does not look at
[1:06:06] circumstances a perfect faith
[1:06:10] oh man this masters every circumstances

[1:06:20] what i'm hearing it only tuned to this
[1:06:23] world of god

[1:06:34] his breasts his children begging bread
[1:06:37] to eat he's the same god

[1:14:05] oh hallelujah to bring us through every
[1:14:07] circumstances

[1:14:14] he is able to do it
[1:14:18] hallelujah
[1:14:20] glory to his wonderful name
[1:14:23] praise our wonderful jesus
[1:14:25] amen
[1:14:27] our god is good
[1:14:29] all the time
[1:14:31] yeah
[1:14:32] so
[1:14:34] this enemy hasn't stopped
[1:14:36] he used
[1:14:38] the state
[1:14:39] in the time of daniel
[1:14:42] he thought
[1:14:44] he was going to destroy daniel
[1:14:47] not knowing god also has a plan
[1:14:50] he wanted to demonstrate himself for the
[1:14:53] people to know that he's a god over the
[1:14:56] lions he's the god of all those animals
[1:15:00] so when the
[1:15:01] that
[1:15:03] the king made a law
[1:15:05] and that law was contrary to the word of
[1:15:08] god because
[1:15:11] like
[1:15:12] they told us
[1:15:14] to take their sins
[1:15:16] we obey
[1:15:18] we took it
[1:15:19] because it's the law of the land
[1:15:22] we respect that but when it came
[1:15:25] when daniel was told to worship his own
[1:15:29] image
[1:15:30] he said no no no no no no no all the
[1:15:33] other girls they are the worst of men
[1:15:35] amen you are jehovah jairo i am not
[1:15:39] going to obey this law
[1:15:41] because this law is contrary to my word
[1:15:44] so i am not obeying that
[1:15:47] so it says
[1:15:49] if a time comes
[1:15:51] and they tell us not to baptize jesus
[1:15:53] name now i know
[1:15:55] because there is no any other thing that
[1:15:58] you might be saved by the name of jesus
[1:16:00] christ is the name above all names amen
[1:16:05] so when he was told not to worship god
[1:16:09] he said no you guys are fine because
[1:16:12] daniel was gonna pretend that mike
[1:16:14] all the time he was praying three times
[1:16:17] a day
[1:16:18] so when the time came do not pray he
[1:16:21] told them i am not obeying this law
[1:16:24] i am not arrogant
[1:16:26] but i worship god
[1:16:28] because our prime purpose is to worship
[1:16:31] the lord jesus christ that's the main
[1:16:34] purpose we are here
[1:16:35] to worship him in truth and spirit with
[1:16:39] all our minds with all our soul with
[1:16:41] everything within us is to worship the
[1:16:44] true living god who is there is the lord
[1:16:47] and savior jesus christ no any other god
[1:16:51] amen
[1:16:52] some people say well i don't worship
[1:16:55] some worship their cast
[1:16:57] they worship their wives they worship
[1:16:59] everything
[1:17:01] where we watching the lord jesus christ
[1:17:03] we are you have danielle's got honor
[1:17:06] daniel's god will never fear us amen
[1:17:09] that
[1:17:10] the lion could not do nothing to daniel
[1:17:13] when the time came
[1:17:14] the angels shot you know what
[1:17:18] daniel
[1:17:19] didn't know how
[1:17:21] this was going to happen
[1:17:23] but he has confidence in god
[1:17:27] and he went in there and before any
[1:17:32] lion could do anything whether they shut
[1:17:34] up their mouth he said you shut up
[1:17:37] my prophet is here do not touch my
[1:17:39] anointing do my prophets know how
[1:17:42] amen and that lie online lou
[1:17:45] and
[1:17:46] they were scared they were shocked
[1:17:48] and there were three hebrew children
[1:17:51] who also
[1:17:53] obey
[1:17:54] danielle's instructions
[1:17:56] and when
[1:17:58] they were also told
[1:18:00] that if they worship god
[1:18:02] brother sister
[1:18:04] we have to thank god for our freedom of
[1:18:05] religion
[1:18:07] why we are worshiping while we are
[1:18:08] enjoying it
[1:18:10] let's enjoy it now if you don't know
[1:18:12] what is coming
[1:18:14] but we have to enjoy what we have
[1:18:17] the hebrew children were told not to
[1:18:18] worship god
[1:18:21] and they said no no no no no no no
[1:18:24] we know
[1:18:26] our god
[1:18:28] is able to deliver us
[1:18:31] but even if we chose not to
[1:18:34] we are not bound down to its image
[1:18:37] that's the sound of a true believer
[1:18:41] you know god will deliver you from the
[1:18:43] cancer
[1:18:44] you have confidence
[1:18:46] he will deliver you from any afflictions
[1:18:48] that you are in but even if you chose
[1:18:51] not to you will still give him thanks
[1:18:54] you say give me praise you say give me
[1:18:56] that glory and anna
[1:18:58] oh my goodness
[1:19:00] praise god i was telling the people in
[1:19:02] petroleum that there's only one person
[1:19:05] that's saved nobody god not leave
[1:19:07] salvation in anybody's mind
[1:19:10] he reserve it to himself
[1:19:14] to whatever god does he is right
[1:19:18] we just have to thank him for everything
[1:19:20] he has done
[1:19:22] not the chance of the hell of you right
[1:19:25] that was the attitude
[1:19:27] that the three hebrew children have
[1:19:29] and when you get to a place
[1:19:33] that you are in love with god so much
[1:19:36] not from your lips
[1:19:38] then from inside of your soul and your
[1:19:40] heart
[1:19:41] you made that declaration i believe that
[1:19:44] all the angels but abraham will express
[1:19:47] something like when they made that
[1:19:49] declaration those angels says oh let me
[1:19:52] go and do this everybody want to what go
[1:19:54] and fight for those hebrew children he
[1:19:56] said man you just wait i will take care
[1:19:58] of the business myself i know when they
[1:20:00] were thrown into that fire but i thought
[1:20:03] there was a fourth man
[1:20:05] they said they look how to walk like the
[1:20:07] son of man
[1:20:08] hallelujah so whatever they throw you
[1:20:11] into
[1:20:13] just believe
[1:20:14] there will be a fourth man
[1:20:17] and even if you chose not to
[1:20:19] god is so right
[1:20:21] that's the attitude
[1:20:23] god is right
[1:20:25] whatever god does is perfect
[1:20:28] oh man we don't have to worry about
[1:20:30] anything
[1:20:31] i i told those churches petroleum i'm
[1:20:33] still saying that before i have to be
[1:20:36] honest i used to worry
[1:20:38] about past
[1:20:40] oh i should have done this
[1:20:42] oh i could have said this oh i could
[1:20:44] have done this but for now
[1:20:48] god is my witness i don't worry about
[1:20:50] past anymore i'm so certain of god
[1:20:54] that whatever happens god is right
[1:20:57] i'm more relaxed than ever i have that
[1:21:00] confidence
[1:21:01] in god that i'm serving that even my
[1:21:04] mistakes it's always plans it was all
[1:21:07] part of his place for me those mistakes
[1:21:10] i was supposed to do it it happened is
[1:21:13] gone i'm not worried my head about it
[1:21:16] anymore i'm not worried about the future
[1:21:19] i see red take note of for tomorrow
[1:21:22] tomorrow will take care of itself
[1:21:25] i want the present day of his ministry i
[1:21:28] want the real the manner for today there
[1:21:31] were the carcass that the egos would be
[1:21:33] gathered for the fresh food fresh
[1:21:35] anointing i want that presence today i
[1:21:38] wanted anointing the presence of the
[1:21:40] holy ghost in my conscience in my soul
[1:21:44] every part of me that god will take
[1:21:46] absolute control and manifest himself
[1:21:49] daily
[1:21:50] daily thing
[1:21:52] hardly a fresh manner
[1:21:54] fresh from his presence
[1:21:56] that's why i'm worried that's what i'm i
[1:21:58] need of i need him today every hour
[1:22:01] every minute every second
[1:22:04] that he will come forth that he will
[1:22:07] manifest himself that he will do
[1:22:10] what he
[1:22:12] wants to do
[1:22:13] that's all
[1:22:15] because we worry about tomorrow it gives
[1:22:18] you anxiety and appreciation
[1:22:21] god will take you off tomorrow
[1:22:23] oh man
[1:22:25] i i i i listen i got to a place brother
[1:22:28] sister
[1:22:30] that this god
[1:22:33] if he's able
[1:22:35] to deliver me from alcohol
[1:22:39] from the things of the world and has
[1:22:41] kept me
[1:22:43] for all this 20-something years
[1:22:46] what else god cannot do for me
[1:22:49] and my confidence is in him so much
[1:22:53] that god will take out business
[1:22:56] so i love him back because listen i
[1:23:00] wasn't looking for god
[1:23:02] i wasn't searching for him he came to me
[1:23:06] on calvary he came to me
[1:23:09] and he has come to me and kept me
[1:23:12] oh this delivered me
[1:23:15] something that was holding me
[1:23:17] i couldn't get away from it i tried my
[1:23:21] own self and didn't work
[1:23:23] but when it came to me
[1:23:25] something said feel it it's not you the
[1:23:28] same person when you stop this alcohol
[1:23:31] you're gonna stop my problem where did
[1:23:33] it go god took care of business and if
[1:23:37] he has taken care of that business my
[1:23:39] confidence that he gonna see me true no
[1:23:43] matter what happened today what happened
[1:23:45] tomorrow no matter what circumstances no
[1:23:48] matter what i'm going through my
[1:23:50] confidence is that god who took care of
[1:23:54] me before
[1:23:55] would take care of me again
[1:23:57] i believe that the same confidence that
[1:24:00] david had he wasn't scared of goliath he
[1:24:04] wasn't scared about the circumstances
[1:24:07] it's the same fate
[1:24:09] that joshua and caleb had because they
[1:24:12] seen god
[1:24:13] taking them and supplying the manner
[1:24:16] where there was no food they saw god
[1:24:18] open the red sea oh my the same god my
[1:24:22] game that took care of that blessing and
[1:24:25] everything they said you will take care
[1:24:27] of those circumcised philistines those
[1:24:30] joints are nothing our god is able those
[1:24:34] unbelievers were shaking they were
[1:24:37] looking at their child they were looking
[1:24:39] at the size of those people man but the
[1:24:41] real fate does not look at the
[1:24:44] circumstances you know what the
[1:24:46] difference between faith and hope
[1:24:49] who believe it will happen
[1:24:53] the same way faith belief
[1:24:55] but hope just stop
[1:24:57] when you look at the circumstances when
[1:24:59] you see the doctor saying this is not
[1:25:02] possible then all the hope is fading
[1:25:04] away but faith lose beyond hope it lose
[1:25:08] beyond that it knows beyond what your
[1:25:10] eyes are seeing that's why the bible
[1:25:13] said abraham never started at the
[1:25:15] promise of god he was constantly
[1:25:19] giving praise to god
[1:25:22] why didn't look at the circumstances
[1:25:25] and today
[1:25:26] i encourage you
[1:25:28] no matter what circumstances you are
[1:25:30] facing don't look at your circumstances
[1:25:33] look at the promise of god whatever you
[1:25:36] have need of it will come to pass if you
[1:25:39] put your heart on jesus it will happen
[1:25:42] how it's gonna happen i don't know but i
[1:25:45] told you but i have that confidence it
[1:25:47] will come to pass because i'm not
[1:25:49] serving a dead god i'm saving a living
[1:25:53] god his name is the lord jesus christ he
[1:25:56] is able
[1:25:58] brother and sister
[1:25:59] oh man to feed five thousand with five
[1:26:02] loaves of bread
[1:26:04] he's able
[1:26:06] oh man he has confidence on whom who he
[1:26:09] is
[1:26:10] and he knew that purpose would come to
[1:26:13] pass because why it has been in the
[1:26:15] scripture that i will not leave my holy
[1:26:17] one in hell neither will i suffer his
[1:26:19] body to us to see corruption so he
[1:26:22] wasn't scared
[1:26:23] what confidence what scripture what is
[1:26:25] it that god is revealing to you
[1:26:28] you have to have confidence
[1:26:30] that your purpose on this earth will be
[1:26:32] will not finish unless god is finished
[1:26:34] with you oh man if listen
[1:26:38] i always pray
[1:26:40] that god
[1:26:41] please
[1:26:42] let me leave
[1:26:45] to take off my children
[1:26:47] till they get married whatever they get
[1:26:49] the gratitude and everything
[1:26:51] but you know i've come to a place
[1:26:54] that
[1:26:55] i have confidence in god so much
[1:26:57] if he tells me to put my house in order
[1:27:00] i know you take off my family for me i
[1:27:02] don't care what it is i know i want to
[1:27:05] see that way but you have to have that
[1:27:07] faith and confidence in god that when he
[1:27:10] tells you your time is up you just have
[1:27:12] to be ready to go because he that took
[1:27:15] care of you is able to take care of your
[1:27:17] children that's the confidence you have
[1:27:19] to have
[1:27:20] oh man
[1:27:22] that's why the king
[1:27:23] was so worried
[1:27:25] that oh lord i need 15 years
[1:27:28] to do this to do that but god said put
[1:27:30] your house in honor
[1:27:33] he didn't want god perfect well
[1:27:36] he went for the permissive world
[1:27:38] and within that 15 years he backslided
[1:27:41] because dog knows best
[1:27:43] he knows what is good for you so we have
[1:27:46] to love him so much that when he says
[1:27:49] time home
[1:27:51] say god i'm ready to go
[1:27:53] i believe you take off my children you
[1:27:55] take up everything because god that take
[1:27:58] up that i didn't come to this world
[1:27:59] anything i didn't have nothing
[1:28:02] and he has brought me that's why he will
[1:28:04] take care of them my confidence is going
[1:28:07] that way
[1:28:08] amen we have to have that place
[1:28:11] that god is able to take off every
[1:28:14] situation
[1:28:15] don't worry he's still god
[1:28:18] oh man
[1:28:20] his only belief all things
[1:28:23] are possible
[1:28:25] oh glory to thy name amen and amen
[1:28:29] thank you jesus
[1:28:31] hallelujah
[1:28:34] praise our wonderful jesus
[1:28:37] amen god is good
[1:28:40] all the time
[1:28:42] oh glory to thy name listen
[1:28:46] there are
[1:28:47] a couple of things
[1:28:49] that the enemy uses
[1:28:52] to try to
[1:28:53] hinder god's children to achieve
[1:28:57] their purpose
[1:28:59] but still going to work
[1:29:02] for god's glory
[1:29:04] what the devil did
[1:29:08] god raised something
[1:29:11] to be someone
[1:29:13] to live by the children of israel
[1:29:15] to destroy the enemy
[1:29:17] to destroy
[1:29:19] the philistines
[1:29:20] what the devil did
[1:29:22] he sidetracked him
[1:29:24] with lyla is that right
[1:29:29] he start tracking with delilah
[1:29:32] but
[1:29:33] god has purpose
[1:29:35] that something's gonna destroy
[1:29:38] the children of philistines it doesn't
[1:29:41] matter how the devil used delilah that
[1:29:44] purpose could not be kingdom it still
[1:29:47] have to come to pass
[1:29:49] and you know what samson did that's what
[1:29:52] most of people stopped to do
[1:29:55] something
[1:29:57] the devil thought he has got him
[1:29:59] they took off his eyes
[1:30:01] been led by another child
[1:30:03] didn't have
[1:30:05] anything and it's everything that every
[1:30:08] sin seems that everything is gone
[1:30:12] there's something repented
[1:30:14] he cried onto god
[1:30:16] and said oh lord jesus
[1:30:19] please one more time forgive me please
[1:30:22] forgive me for everything i've done
[1:30:24] that's what we have to do
[1:30:26] when we make wrong we have to
[1:30:29] be respect
[1:30:31] we got to make things right
[1:30:33] sometimes
[1:30:34] you do something to your brother
[1:30:37] you wanna
[1:30:38] face your face
[1:30:40] save your face
[1:30:42] you are afraid
[1:30:44] you look you
[1:30:46] you scared you don't want to admit your
[1:30:49] fault
[1:30:50] you have to go to that brother and make
[1:30:52] things right
[1:30:54] it doesn't matter how you look bad
[1:30:57] in the eyes of the people i would rather
[1:30:59] look back in the eyes of the people that
[1:31:01] are in the eyes of god because once you
[1:31:04] make that thing right it will take any
[1:31:06] blockage from your prayer and things
[1:31:09] will happen
[1:31:10] amen that's why
[1:31:12] the scripture says that
[1:31:15] you know what the catholic people what
[1:31:16] they did
[1:31:17] they just kind of
[1:31:19] mangled the scriptures is that right
[1:31:22] they have something they're called
[1:31:23] purgatory or whatever
[1:31:25] purgatory or whatever is this paging
[1:31:28] the right interviews they purging your
[1:31:30] soul
[1:31:31] but you don't die before
[1:31:34] somebody pay money for you together
[1:31:36] you know that's why they have twice the
[1:31:38] scriptures
[1:31:39] but a true christian
[1:31:41] we are purging our soul every day
[1:31:44] by repentance asking god for forgiveness
[1:31:47] that's why the bible said that he that
[1:31:49] believeth on me
[1:31:50] shall pass from all death unto life will
[1:31:53] not come unto a condemnation
[1:31:57] you will not come to where the word of
[1:31:59] god is judging us now
[1:32:02] so it's very important that we repent of
[1:32:05] our mistakes
[1:32:07] of the things that we make it wrong the
[1:32:09] word is purging your soul paging
[1:32:12] anything like christ from you and samson
[1:32:15] recognized that so he maintains right
[1:32:18] and the purpose that god brought him to
[1:32:21] this world it was it accomplished the
[1:32:24] bible said that he killed more people
[1:32:27] when he repented on that day than all
[1:32:30] his life
[1:32:31] what he has achieved so your purpose
[1:32:35] nothing
[1:32:37] will hinder
[1:32:39] the plans
[1:32:41] god has for you understand
[1:32:43] it to come to pass
[1:32:47] nobody can take your place
[1:32:50] that promise
[1:32:51] in the word of god for him
[1:32:54] it will come to pass
[1:32:58] how i don't know
[1:33:00] that it will be achieved
[1:33:02] amen
[1:33:04] hallelujah
[1:33:06] amen praise god
[1:33:10] and one more other thing
[1:33:13] you know
[1:33:14] it was god
[1:33:18] sometimes
[1:33:21] you wanna see supernatural
[1:33:23] you wanna see more of god
[1:33:26] but it comes the price
[1:33:29] those times
[1:33:31] the devil comes face to face to attack
[1:33:34] him god
[1:33:37] wanted to show
[1:33:39] just
[1:33:40] take the curtain off
[1:33:42] for job to see beyond the kitten of time
[1:33:46] to see beyond what's going to happen
[1:33:48] but he has to go through all that
[1:33:51] he lost his children he lost everything
[1:33:54] he went through all those trials
[1:33:57] and
[1:33:58] when job got to a place
[1:34:00] that god
[1:34:01] took his wife even denied him he said
[1:34:03] hey boy cares god
[1:34:06] he said you speaking like a foolish
[1:34:08] woman he didn't say you are foolish i
[1:34:10] said you speaking like that
[1:34:12] so i speak like that
[1:34:14] and god
[1:34:16] lived that kitten
[1:34:19] and job saw it he saw the lord jesus
[1:34:22] christ the coming raptures oh i know my
[1:34:24] original limit and everything was like
[1:34:27] god amen
[1:34:29] praise god so when you want to see god
[1:34:33] when you want those supernatural it's
[1:34:36] not going to come easy
[1:34:38] so most of the time that
[1:34:41] the
[1:34:41] best things happens when we are down in
[1:34:44] the valley
[1:34:45] not when you are up over the mountain
[1:34:48] that's why the br brahms said you wait
[1:34:51] until they put that pressure
[1:34:54] on that there you see these things that
[1:34:56] you are seeing will literally work but
[1:34:59] it's here
[1:35:01] we are manifesting that we are going
[1:35:03] through that slowly
[1:35:04] and the final phase will happen we are
[1:35:06] in the infancy stage
[1:35:09] so
[1:35:10] you go through that it's not easy
[1:35:14] but god will get the glory
[1:35:17] he will manifest himself he'll calm down
[1:35:20] proof he'll prove to job
[1:35:23] and open the kitten of time
[1:35:27] he wrote my redeemer leave it he saw the
[1:35:30] coming me so i saw the raptor he saw
[1:35:32] everything said even skim worm destroy
[1:35:35] this body in my flesh
[1:35:38] i'll see god
[1:35:39] oh man that's the god we are serving
[1:35:43] praise god
[1:35:45] he's not a dead god he's a living god
[1:35:48] praise god i'm gonna
[1:35:50] um
[1:35:53] i'm
[1:35:54] gonna a couple of years okay let's go
[1:35:57] ahead and have more time
[1:35:58] and
[1:36:00] another thing
[1:36:02] the religious leaders
[1:36:05] they are always
[1:36:07] because
[1:36:08] they hide behind the political power
[1:36:12] to put
[1:36:13] pressure on the true children of god
[1:36:16] and god has not changed
[1:36:18] remember
[1:36:20] that peter
[1:36:22] god gave them the power
[1:36:25] but they didn't have the faith the
[1:36:27] perfect faith to operate the power
[1:36:30] they gave them power to cast their
[1:36:32] devils they did all that
[1:36:34] but when they brought in matthew 17 when
[1:36:38] they brought that
[1:36:39] uh the creep whatever i think they could
[1:36:41] not heal that individual
[1:36:43] and they asked the lord
[1:36:46] why couldn't we do it
[1:36:48] he said what
[1:36:49] lack of faith
[1:36:52] and that lack of faith
[1:36:56] was a perfect faith
[1:36:57] because if you read down there might 2
[1:36:59] 17 he said that if you have faith like
[1:37:03] what a mustard seed and master seed
[1:37:06] faith is a pure faith it doesn't mix
[1:37:09] with anything
[1:37:12] but you know what
[1:37:14] after they receive the holy ghost
[1:37:17] because remember peter denied god
[1:37:20] he was scary man
[1:37:22] and one time wasn't even angry with god
[1:37:24] when bruh
[1:37:25] bro bro this one was saying that he feed
[1:37:28] my lamb feed my cheek she might
[1:37:30] get angry is that right he did all that
[1:37:33] but after he received the holy ghost
[1:37:37] he wasn't scared of anybody
[1:37:41] and
[1:37:42] he said where's rabbi jones
[1:37:44] and if you go and read acts chapter 4
[1:37:46] verse 12 going down there
[1:37:49] they told him and john
[1:37:51] they're religious people
[1:37:53] don't mention this name anymore
[1:37:58] and they were bold
[1:38:00] and told them should we listen to man oh
[1:38:02] god
[1:38:04] this is what is going to happen now this
[1:38:06] is what is going place is coming to a
[1:38:08] time
[1:38:10] that are we going to listen the law of
[1:38:13] the land tells you
[1:38:15] don't baptize in his death
[1:38:17] baptizing the father and holy ghost
[1:38:20] or
[1:38:21] do what that denomination people are
[1:38:24] doing
[1:38:25] then the true bride of christ i have the
[1:38:27] holy ghost in
[1:38:28] them who have changed now
[1:38:32] that change is already in progress
[1:38:34] to the final face
[1:38:36] you gonna have that boldness and say no
[1:38:40] i'm worshiping god i'm baptizing his
[1:38:43] name he said there's no any other name
[1:38:46] where you might be saved by the name of
[1:38:48] jesus it's a name that demons fear and
[1:38:51] tremble is the name that every knee
[1:38:54] shall bow of faith in heaven and of
[1:38:57] faith in everything you do is i do it in
[1:39:01] my name
[1:39:03] so we gonna stand behind what we believe
[1:39:07] just gonna be peter it wasn't 10
[1:39:11] it was the spirit of christ the holy
[1:39:13] ghost in them that gave them the
[1:39:15] boldness and said she will listen to man
[1:39:18] or god and the people left them alone
[1:39:20] because peter has that inspiration that
[1:39:23] his purpose was not finished yet because
[1:39:27] god jesus had told him that they will
[1:39:29] lead you by then you're gonna be old so
[1:39:32] those who cannot do nothing to him so
[1:39:34] it's you and me our purpose is not
[1:39:37] finished until the final phase of the
[1:39:39] rapture until god raptures his heart
[1:39:42] from here so our confidence to be in god
[1:39:45] more than ever
[1:39:47] knowing that no matter what they say
[1:39:49] if it's contrary to this word of god we
[1:39:53] are standing
[1:39:54] by this
[1:39:56] by what the bible said
[1:39:59] know what man is saying
[1:40:02] man do not fear any man
[1:40:05] job said why do you worry about man he
[1:40:07] is just like a flower he come today you
[1:40:09] go on tomorrow
[1:40:11] our confidence is in god's word
[1:40:15] and we are the last people
[1:40:17] fulfilled we are the manifestation of
[1:40:21] the prophet's message that malachi 4 5
[1:40:24] that was we had a manifestation of that
[1:40:27] luke 17 30 returning the bright green
[1:40:30] that the son of man revealed again in
[1:40:33] their bright form
[1:40:35] hallelujah
[1:40:36] in revelation 10 8 11 says john your
[1:40:40] book would work bitter says sweet in
[1:40:42] your mind gonna be bitter in your
[1:40:43] stomach edward prophesied again
[1:40:47] all the scriptures
[1:40:49] we are the fulfillment of those
[1:40:52] so what man
[1:40:54] are you scared of man to come and tell
[1:40:56] you how to worship your god
[1:40:58] what time
[1:40:59] david wife was trying to tell him how to
[1:41:01] worship his god he said
[1:41:03] let me show you some more skills
[1:41:05] he didn't worry he wasn't worried about
[1:41:07] that wife
[1:41:09] you should have to listen to a man
[1:41:12] if it's contrary to this word
[1:41:15] this thing here is our absolute
[1:41:18] with the message that god sent to the
[1:41:20] prophet to us the two of them is
[1:41:22] absolute and i believe everywhere that
[1:41:25] the prophet said
[1:41:27] with a revelation of it
[1:41:31] the thing is
[1:41:33] it's not how much you know
[1:41:36] because those that will come the 11th
[1:41:39] hour
[1:41:40] those levels are people
[1:41:42] they don't have to have all the
[1:41:44] revelation and all the things that we
[1:41:46] have all these years
[1:41:48] just one revelation that housewife needs
[1:41:52] one revelation and then he's having the
[1:41:54] same pain as you
[1:41:56] so it's not how much you know
[1:41:59] is how much the giver is behind your
[1:42:01] skin
[1:42:02] that's what matters
[1:42:04] that's what's important
[1:42:06] have you been in contact with that
[1:42:08] pillar of fire have been in contact with
[1:42:10] god yourself
[1:42:12] how much god is in your skin inside of
[1:42:14] you
[1:42:16] hiding behind you
[1:42:18] not the knowledge
[1:42:20] the knowledge part is good
[1:42:22] where you need that dynamics
[1:42:24] is the spirit
[1:42:26] that quickened that way
[1:42:28] amen
[1:42:30] hallelujah so it's the same pain
[1:42:32] so don't worry
[1:42:36] just get what
[1:42:38] god has revealed to you
[1:42:40] put it to work because you that have
[1:42:43] been given many much is required of you
[1:42:48] it's according to how much you have
[1:42:50] received
[1:42:51] you're going to give an account of that
[1:42:53] that's why you cannot compare ourselves
[1:42:55] with anybody
[1:42:57] because it depends on how much god has
[1:43:00] revealed to you certain things he will
[1:43:02] not permit you to do he'll permit others
[1:43:05] to do based on how much they have
[1:43:08] received
[1:43:10] so nobody judge anybody
[1:43:12] gone are the days
[1:43:14] when people want you to follow the same
[1:43:16] way they see things how god is dealing
[1:43:18] their life they want to make a copycat
[1:43:20] there is no copycats
[1:43:23] there's one brother michael amen there's
[1:43:26] no more black mike
[1:43:27] one and only bro mike
[1:43:30] you can never have two of them
[1:43:33] you see what i mean
[1:43:35] you are unique by this one
[1:43:38] nobody can
[1:43:40] come complicated of you
[1:43:42] and you cannot be complicated of anybody
[1:43:43] so
[1:43:44] we have we are free i just saw i'm just
[1:43:47] gonna
[1:43:48] end up over here you are free when you
[1:43:50] really recognize that
[1:43:52] and that becomes so real to you
[1:43:55] you become so free
[1:43:58] you're not jealous of anybody
[1:44:01] even if you genuinely make sense because
[1:44:03] you can't have it
[1:44:04] so why
[1:44:07] it's for that individual
[1:44:10] you have to appreciate him and support
[1:44:13] when people are greetings for god
[1:44:15] support them
[1:44:17] leave them out
[1:44:18] amen
[1:44:20] yes sir let's support our pastor as the
[1:44:23] brother said lifting man
[1:44:25] the more you go outside the more you get
[1:44:27] blessed the more you'll not get blessed
[1:44:30] just support the gifts
[1:44:32] you see people doing things for god
[1:44:34] support them
[1:44:36] amen
[1:44:37] you are people
[1:44:39] they don't have time for themselves but
[1:44:43] you don't have time for that those times
[1:44:45] are gone
[1:44:47] because listen
[1:44:48] this time
[1:44:50] i don't argue with nobody about the
[1:44:52] scripture
[1:44:54] my intention
[1:44:56] to help the people to receive the holy
[1:44:58] ghost
[1:44:59] to receive this truth no time for
[1:45:02] argument f is for them
[1:45:05] the bible said that no one comes the
[1:45:07] father except what i call him first
[1:45:11] and even the book of i said nobody join
[1:45:14] it unless god was added to the church
[1:45:17] so you cannot convert nobody
[1:45:21] you cannot change somebody's doctrine
[1:45:24] you can just wave
[1:45:26] so you don't argue and follow this
[1:45:28] minister this minister this that that we
[1:45:31] follow the lord jesus christ and the
[1:45:33] shepherd god has given to us here we
[1:45:35] follow him and follow the prophet of god
[1:45:37] that's it
[1:45:39] because he said you follow me as i
[1:45:41] follow jesus
[1:45:43] amen
[1:45:45] hallelujah i saw branton i don't have
[1:45:47] much to say i think in conclusion
[1:45:50] i can just prepare to come i'll talk
[1:45:52] about
[1:45:53] um joseph
[1:45:56] another thing that happened in his life
[1:46:01] god gave him a dream
[1:46:04] his brothers was going to walk worship
[1:46:06] him
[1:46:07] and they were so jealous
[1:46:09] we're gonna worship you no way
[1:46:11] so they tried to step in
[1:46:13] to destroy him
[1:46:15] it was the devil that went to his
[1:46:17] brothers but he didn't know that it was
[1:46:18] all working for the plan of god
[1:46:21] amen
[1:46:22] to cut him off
[1:46:25] but god said
[1:46:27] you
[1:46:28] you're gonna be a leader
[1:46:30] they're gonna worship you and joseph was
[1:46:32] not worried he has confidence
[1:46:36] in god that called him
[1:46:39] if anybody
[1:46:41] has the right to complain was joseph
[1:46:44] because his brothers saw him
[1:46:47] he went to a place he's trying to be
[1:46:49] faithful to his to his master the
[1:46:52] master's wife put lie on him
[1:46:56] he tried to do everything but if he was
[1:46:58] always there
[1:47:00] sometimes
[1:47:01] a true christians after your life you
[1:47:03] might feel it that you are cursed
[1:47:06] but then devil fight you every step of
[1:47:08] the way
[1:47:10] but that sin will come forth
[1:47:12] at the right time
[1:47:14] to manifest christ
[1:47:16] the purpose
[1:47:18] that god brought you here
[1:47:21] come to pass
[1:47:24] nothing i want nobody to live here today
[1:47:27] without having that in your your whole
[1:47:31] body that
[1:47:32] nothing
[1:47:34] can take you from this earth unless your
[1:47:37] purpose is accomplished whatever god
[1:47:40] brought you to here to do
[1:47:43] nobody
[1:47:46] can hinder that
[1:47:48] they might try for a time
[1:47:51] but it do not end
[1:47:53] amen
[1:47:56] and joseph
[1:47:58] eventually what happened
[1:47:59] his brothers bowed down to him
[1:48:02] because god has purpose
[1:48:05] that joseph was special
[1:48:07] and wherever he went was a prosperity
[1:48:10] amen so it's just simple like that so no
[1:48:13] matter what the people do
[1:48:15] what god has talked about you
[1:48:18] it will come to pass
[1:48:21] it's simple like that simple
[1:48:23] amen
[1:48:25] hallelujah i think that's what happened
[1:48:26] and tony
