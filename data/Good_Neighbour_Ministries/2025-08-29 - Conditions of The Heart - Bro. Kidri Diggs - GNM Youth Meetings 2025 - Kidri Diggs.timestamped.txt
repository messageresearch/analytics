[37:48] I can't feel at home anymore in this
[37:51] world. Amen. The word of God is becoming
[37:54] so magnified in this hour that uh we we
[38:00] just we we can sense the change is going
[38:03] to be right around the corner. It's it's
[38:05] upon us, saints. Amen. Praise God.
[38:08] Welcome. Welcome every single one of you
[38:12] to the Good Neighbor Ministries uh fall
[38:16] um young people's
[38:19] uh meetings. It is uh absolutely a
[38:23] privilege and an honor to um once again
[38:27] assemble under this atmosphere where God
[38:30] can move and do great things for our
[38:33] young people. You know, it's not Listen,
[38:35] we're all we're all 21. Believe it or
[38:38] not, if you're a son or a daughter of
[38:40] God, you're all young people. Amen. But
[38:43] the difference is you're looking at me
[38:45] and you can see quite clearly I'm not
[38:47] 21.
[38:49] And I can tell you I don't feel the
[38:52] strength that I had when I was 21.
[38:55] But I can tell you another thing that I
[38:58] remember when the Lord first called me
[39:00] out. I was 33 years old and I had a lot
[39:02] of strength and I was like a house on
[39:05] fire. And God has a purpose in calling
[39:08] young people because he wants to use
[39:10] your strength. He wants to use the
[39:13] passion that you have for the things of
[39:16] this world. He wants to turn it around
[39:18] and he wants to use it for his glory so
[39:21] that you can make an imprint in this
[39:24] generation
[39:26] as young people serving the Lord. Amen.
[39:30] Praise God. You can see here what it
[39:32] says. It says, "Preserving the truth in
[39:36] our youth."
[39:38] And I'll just continue and finish the
[39:40] sentence. preserving the truth in our
[39:43] youth so that his purpose can be in use
[39:49] in you.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Forever more. God has
[39:54] a purpose for each and every son and
[39:57] daughter of God so that their light can
[40:00] shine in the generation that they are
[40:03] called in. You're not here by accident.
[40:07] You're not even here this weekend by
[40:08] accident. You're here because the Holy
[40:11] Spirit led you here. You might think,
[40:14] "Oh, you know, I was invited and I
[40:15] thought, you know, that I should go."
[40:17] You still had to say yes. You still had
[40:20] to say, "Amen. I'm going." And I believe
[40:23] because you've made that decision. If
[40:26] you just pay attention and yield
[40:29] yourself to the spirit, God is going to
[40:31] do something special for you. Put up the
[40:34] scripture. Our theme this year is God is
[40:38] preserving his word, his truth in the
[40:41] young people. Amen. And in Psalms 121:8,
[40:46] it says, "The Lord shall preserve thy
[40:49] going out and thy coming in from this
[40:53] time forth and even forever more."
[40:57] &gt;&gt; I know you've been to many youth camps.
[40:59] A lot of you young people, I know you
[41:01] have. and you've gone back out and
[41:04] you've come back in. But he says, "I'm
[41:07] going to preserve you. Even when you're
[41:08] out there, I'm going to bring you back
[41:10] in."
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you you can't get away from
[41:14] what God wants to do in your life this
[41:16] weekend. Amen. He's got a plan for you.
[41:18] Praise God. And he's got he's got a fire
[41:21] brandon minister that's going to speak
[41:24] the word of God and is going to meet
[41:26] every need here tonight. I believe it
[41:28] with all of my heart. Amen. Praise God.

[43:50] here tonight and you've been praying
[43:52] this week in in expectation, and I can
[43:55] tell you there's been a lot of prayer
[43:57] going into these meetings. Amen. So,
[44:00] you're going to see the supernatural
[44:02] regardless. You're going to see God move
[44:05] in a special way. And don't be looking
[44:07] for signs and wonders.
[44:10] That's not what that's not what turns on
[44:13] the sons and daughters of God. It's when
[44:15] God unveils himself and one repents,
[44:20] &gt;&gt; it's worth a thousand worlds. Amen. And
[44:24] that's what we're under expectation to
[44:26] see God moving in the individual lives
[44:29] of our young people. Amen. Praise God.

[47:51] [Music]
[47:57] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[47:58] praise.
[48:01] If God's been good to you, why don't you
[48:03] give him some praise tonight?
[48:06] I can't speak for everybody, but I know
[48:08] he's been good to me.
[48:11] I know he's been good to Pastor Mazelli.
[48:13] We've been riding together, so I know
[48:15] God's been good to him. Hallelujah.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:19] We just thank and praise the Lord for
[48:21] his goodness. Amen.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; It's good to be on this side of the
[48:24] world again. Amen. Not too cold, not too
[48:27] hot,
[48:29] just right. Amen. That's our God.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Everything is just right.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; You know what? It's just right for God
[48:37] to move tonight.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; How many expecting God to answer your
[48:42] prayer?
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, we certainly thank God for
[48:47] Pastor Danny. Amen. We certainly
[48:49] appreciate him.
[48:50] Brother Simon, wherever he may be. Amen.
[48:52] He's been such an inspiration to all of
[48:55] us. Amen. Thank God for all of your
[48:58] pastors. Believe that they are mighty
[49:01] men of valor. Amen. We certainly
[49:03] appreciate all of you. But we appreciate
[49:05] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we come.
[49:10] It's good to see all the faces that we
[49:13] know. Amen. And thank God for all of you
[49:16] and your travels. Let's just have a word
[49:17] of prayer and we'll get right into the
[49:18] word of God tonight. If you have a need,
[49:20] you can acknowledge it to the Lord by
[49:22] uplifted hand.
[49:24] Let's pray. Lord Jesus, Father, we lift
[49:27] our hands to you as an act of faith.
[49:31] Lord, knowing that you see the need,
[49:33] Lord, or the desire before we can even
[49:36] ask. But Lord, in our asking, Lord, let
[49:39] us not ask anything that's not of your
[49:41] perfect will, Lord. Lord, for we want
[49:44] your perfect will, Lord. We don't want
[49:46] something that we'll have for a period
[49:49] of time and then it's gone because it's
[49:51] permissible.
[49:52] But Lord, we want the your perfect will.
[49:54] Something that'll stay with us for
[49:56] eternity.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray you bless your people,
[49:59] Lord. And Lord God, and bless the need
[50:02] in their life, Father, and Father, their
[50:05] families and different things, Lord. And
[50:07] we just pray that your Holy Spirit would
[50:09] come and dominate the service, Lord,
[50:12] Lord. That it won't be the acts of men
[50:14] or the thoughts of men, Lord, but it'll
[50:17] be the Holy Spirit moving. It'll be the
[50:20] Holy Spirit taking over,
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Lord. And that's what we want tonight.
[50:23] We want a Holy Spirit takeover tonight,
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Lord. We pray that you would let the
[50:29] inspiration that you've given, Lord, let
[50:31] it become plain, Lord. Lord, not in the
[50:33] intellectual realm, but a realm that can
[50:35] be seen by faith, Lord. Lord, we pray
[50:38] your blessings, Lord. Lord, we all want
[50:41] to practice the greatest gift given unto
[50:42] man. And that's moving out of the way
[50:45] that the Holy Spirit may have prayer
[50:47] minutes in the wonderful name of Jesus
[50:49] Christ, Lord. And what would a prayer
[50:52] be, Lord, if we didn't ask, Lord, for
[50:54] forgiveness, Lord? Lord, the different
[50:58] failures in our lives, Lord, the the
[51:01] sins or mishaps or whatever you want to
[51:03] call it. Lord, we plead your blood right
[51:06] now. Lord, we plead your blood over our
[51:09] habits, Lord. We plead the blood, Lord,
[51:12] over the different things, Lord, that
[51:14] are stenching your nostrils right now.
[51:16] Lord, atone over us right now, Lord. And
[51:19] let nothing about us keep you from
[51:21] touching us, Lord. We put it under the
[51:24] blood right now in the name of Jesus
[51:26] Christ. We pray and we thank you. Let
[51:28] the church say amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's
[51:32] turn to Ezekiel chapter 36.
[51:37] Ezekiel 36.
[51:41] Praise the Lord.
[51:47] Amen.
[51:48] Glory to God.
[51:56] Ezekiel 36 and um
[51:59] let's start reading that verse. Uh
[52:04] I think I want 26.
[52:09] Yeah, let's start reading at verse 26.
[52:15] The Bible says Ezekiel 36 and 26. The
[52:19] Bible says, "And I will make them
[52:23] and
[52:25] yeah, and I will make them and the
[52:27] places round about my heel a blessing,
[52:31] and I will cause the No, that I ain't in
[52:34] the right verse. Hold on."
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. 36. I was in 34.
[52:46] Man's technology
[52:54] 26.
[52:56] If you have it, say amen.
[53:00] All right.
[53:03] The Bible says,
[53:09] let's just let's just back up a little
[53:11] bit. Let's go to 24.
[53:17] For I will take you from among the
[53:20] heathen, and gather you out of all
[53:22] countries, and will bring you into your
[53:26] own land. Then will I sprinkle clean
[53:29] water upon you, and ye shall be clean
[53:32] from all your filthiness. Somebody say,
[53:34] "Amen."
[53:36] &gt;&gt; And from all your out idols. Somebody
[53:38] say, "Amen." Amen.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Will I cleanse you? A new heart also
[53:44] will I give you, and a new spirit will I
[53:47] put within you, and I will take away the
[53:50] stony heart out of your flesh, and I
[53:53] will give you a new heart of flesh. And
[53:57] I will put my spirit within you and
[54:01] cause you to walk in my statutes. And ye
[54:04] shall keep my judgments and do them, and
[54:08] you shall dwell in the land that I give
[54:11] to your fathers, and ye shall be my
[54:13] people, and I will be your God. Amen.
[54:16] May the Lord have a bless his word. You
[54:18] can have your seats.
[54:20] Amen.
[54:22] Praise the Lord.
[54:24] You know, I I like that verse of
[54:26] scriptures, you know, because it's
[54:28] something that God is saying he will do
[54:31] for us.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; It's not something that uh the preacher
[54:35] can do. It's not something that mom and
[54:37] daddy can do. It's not something that a
[54:39] good job can do, a a a good relationship
[54:43] can do. But God is the only one that can
[54:46] do what we just read.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I like how he said, "A
[54:51] new heart also will I give you."
[54:54] Hallelujah. So what God is saying, the
[54:56] the way we are born is not good enough.
[54:59] Hallelujah.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; The way you were born, the way I was
[55:02] born is not good enough. Hallelujah. So
[55:05] tonight, by the grace of God, my my
[55:08] subject is conditions of the heart.
[55:11] Hallelujah. Conditions of the heart.
[55:14] Amen. And you know when we when we think
[55:17] of the heart most of the time we we
[55:19] think of love.
[55:21] Talk to me church.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you think of the heart
[55:25] you think of you think of love and you
[55:27] and and you and you think of happy
[55:30] things. Amen. The heart is not supposed
[55:33] to be broken.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; The heart is is is joy is supposed to
[55:38] flow from your heart.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; But you know church when we were born we
[55:42] were born in sin. So our lives were
[55:46] being molded to live in this world. But
[55:49] then God came and God said, "I'm gonna
[55:52] give you a new heart."
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Why is he going to give us a new heart?
[55:56] Because in the condition we were born
[55:58] in, we didn't have a heart to desire
[56:01] God.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the conditions of our
[56:05] heart ran after the things of the world.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; So God said, "I'm going to change your
[56:10] heart." And unless God change your
[56:13] heart, you can't even live by his
[56:16] spirit.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; But you know, church, when I when I when
[56:23] I look at, you know, the conditions of
[56:26] the heart, if you don't mind, let me
[56:29] start off with reading something our
[56:31] prophet said. Hallelujah. He said, "Man
[56:35] works by his head
[56:38] and looks by his eyes.
[56:40] See the devil, hallelujah, said to the
[56:44] woman, "Oh, the tree is pleasant." She
[56:47] said it, she said, "It is good to look
[56:50] at." See that same devil, if he can get
[56:55] you to stop just for a minute,
[56:59] if the enemy can get you to stop just
[57:01] for a minute, he'll start to mess with
[57:04] your mind.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; But the devil don't know what's in your
[57:08] heart.
[57:12] Hallelujah.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Your mind, your thoughts, all of that
[57:16] can be challenged and perverted.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; But the enemy doesn't know what's in
[57:20] nobody's heart.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; The only way, hallelujah, he can get
[57:24] close to you is by your actions.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:34] Church, if we before I finish reading
[57:36] this,
[57:38] there are many people in the Bible who
[57:40] had filthy lives,
[57:43] but in their heart they desired a
[57:45] change.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The woman at the well, a
[57:50] change. Rahab, a change.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Even when Jacob was tricking and
[57:56] shugging and diving everybody, he wanted
[57:58] a change.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; See, the devil don't know what's in your
[58:02] heart.
[58:06] There are conditions of the heart.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; I challenge you tonight
[58:16] to open your heart to God,
[58:19] &gt;&gt; not your mind. I might say some things
[58:21] that you'll be like, h my, I never
[58:23] thought about it like that.
[58:26] That's intellectualism.
[58:30] What we need to do tonight,
[58:33] whatever you hear and it's challenging
[58:35] to you or you were like, "Man, that's
[58:38] good." Open up your spirit to receive
[58:40] it.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Open up your heart to say, "God, come
[58:45] and sit on my throne."
[58:48] &gt;&gt; God's throne is your heart. And the
[58:51] question tonight is, does God have a
[58:54] seat on your heart
[58:56] &gt;&gt; or is something else there
[59:00] &gt;&gt; in his place?
[59:04] Oh, we got plenty of scriptures, plenty
[59:06] of things to back up this thought.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; But look, I want you to get this verse.
[59:15] as I'm preaching, don't follow me with
[59:18] your mind
[59:21] &gt;&gt; cuz the enemy can pervert those
[59:23] thoughts.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ask yourself,
[59:27] does God really have permanence in my
[59:30] heart? And let me say it like this. Even
[59:33] if the mind, your mind don't belong to
[59:36] the devil, it's just a battleground.
[59:40] That's the place God allowed him to make
[59:44] war.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; But your mind doesn't belong to the
[59:51] devil. Why? Because your mind is a
[59:54] battleground.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; That mean God is also fighting for your
[59:59] mind.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; And you think about it. Hallelujah. If
[1:00:04] God can get your mind and your heart,
[1:00:07] you will be unstoppable.
[1:00:09] [Applause]
[1:00:15] But let's deal with the conditions of
[1:00:16] the heart. Listen. Listen. I ain't going
[1:00:20] to be long. Y'all know I'm about to
[1:00:21] close.
[1:00:25] Hallelujah. Some of y'all need that
[1:00:27] already.
[1:00:30] Just got here and you're drifting.
[1:00:34] Just got here and you're a little tired.
[1:00:36] just got here and things are running
[1:00:38] through your mind.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you need a little help,
[1:00:43] you're drifting a little bit just to pay
[1:00:45] attention, let me help you out. I got
[1:00:46] some words that got power.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; I'm about to close,
[1:00:55] brother. I've seen those words.
[1:00:56] Hallelujah. Catch the attention of the
[1:00:58] people.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; I've seen people in church sleeping,
[1:01:01] getting boxed up by the devil.
[1:01:06] You say, "I'm about to go." Amen,
[1:01:08] brother. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; So, if you need a little help just early
[1:01:17] in the service, I'm about to close.
[1:01:22] Hallelujah. But listen, church.
[1:01:26] Listen what he says.
[1:01:28] She said, "It's good to look at. See,
[1:01:31] that same devil, if he can get you to
[1:01:36] stop just for a minute, just for a
[1:01:38] minute,
[1:01:39] he can make you reason it out. He can
[1:01:43] make you think with your mind, but God
[1:01:47] doesn't use a man's hand.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; God uses his heart.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The only way God can use any
[1:01:56] of us is if your heart has been given to
[1:01:59] him. What good is a relationship if you
[1:02:02] don't have that person's heart?
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Think about it, brothers. If you ain't
[1:02:07] got your wife's heart, you make her mad,
[1:02:10] she might put some extra spices in your
[1:02:11] food.
[1:02:17] Oh Lord. And if you put your hands on
[1:02:19] her, she might Let me leave it alone.
[1:02:23] Let me leave it. Hey sisters, if that if
[1:02:26] that man don't Hallelujah. If he he if
[1:02:28] if you don't have his heart, he get
[1:02:31] tired of working. He'll sit home and
[1:02:32] play the game. Uh oh.
[1:02:36] But if he got your heart,
[1:02:39] when it's snowing and raining out here
[1:02:41] in Ontario, Victoria, it's it's it's
[1:02:44] pouring down. Hallelujah. You know what
[1:02:46] he say? Because he's giving his heart to
[1:02:48] his family. He said, "Man, I got to go
[1:02:49] to work. Got to catch this bus. Got to
[1:02:52] do whatever. Hey, I got to provide for
[1:02:54] my family." Why? You have his heart.
[1:02:57] Hallelujah. And if somebody Hallelujah
[1:03:00] has given their heart to something,
[1:03:03] that's where their treasure is.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Young sisters, hallelujah. If that man
[1:03:11] has not given you his heart, you are not
[1:03:14] his treasure.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Vice versa, brothers,
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; you got a nice car. She in love with
[1:03:23] your car.
[1:03:26] Got some rims on that thing. A nice
[1:03:28] candy paint job. If you ain't converted,
[1:03:31] got a nice boom boom in it.
[1:03:34] And you pick up. She want everybody to
[1:03:36] see it. She turn turn that up a little
[1:03:38] louder
[1:03:41] in the car riding,
[1:03:45] but you behind on your bill.
[1:03:47] Repo man come and snatch a heart.
[1:03:53] dealership come and snatch that car
[1:03:55] back. Her heart is gone.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; She's no longer in love with you
[1:04:02] because her heart is gone.
[1:04:10] Oh my.
[1:04:13] I've been there before
[1:04:15] where my car was my heart and God let it
[1:04:19] get stolen.
[1:04:24] stolen, stripped,
[1:04:26] windows bust out, everything. And when I
[1:04:29] saw it, my heart was broken.
[1:04:34] Rims gone, music gone, everything gone.
[1:04:38] When I saw it in that condition, I
[1:04:40] didn't want it anymore
[1:04:44] cuz they couldn't bring me that status
[1:04:46] anymore. But what God was doing, he was
[1:04:49] putting my heart in the right place.
[1:04:52] Sometimes God will take things out your
[1:04:55] life because that's where your heart is.
[1:04:57] You might lose your job cuz you was
[1:04:59] making good money. God wants to be your
[1:05:01] heart.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; You might be in a relationship. You love
[1:05:04] that person more than you love God. God
[1:05:07] would allow that person to act a fool
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; just to get your heart back.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; That's how much he loves you.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Church, this journey is heart for heart.
[1:05:22] Hallelujah. God works on his heart while
[1:05:26] the devil works on his head. God chooses
[1:05:28] the heart. The Bible said, "As a man
[1:05:32] thinkketh in his heart, so is he."
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; If I can real quick, just with that
[1:05:39] verse, examine yourself
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; cuz some of you might not even want to
[1:05:43] be here. You know why? Because your
[1:05:46] heart is in another place.
[1:05:48] Your heart might be on Love Island.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Oh boy, we hitting some stuff tonight.
[1:05:58] Y'all got the blood hound loose early.
[1:06:04] Like brother Danny said, all the youth
[1:06:06] meetings we didn't had in this place and
[1:06:08] around Ontario and we still fighting
[1:06:10] these same battles.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Battles of relationship. Yeah, I know
[1:06:15] you go through these things. Hallelujah.
[1:06:17] I know we just we we had good youth
[1:06:19] meetings where where where the men of
[1:06:21] God have broken these things down. But
[1:06:23] one thing I want to bring I want to add
[1:06:25] to that. Yeah, it's natural to go
[1:06:28] through these things. But I want you to
[1:06:30] understand everything you go through,
[1:06:32] there's a spirit behind it.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; You start getting emotions and feelings
[1:06:41] in your body, there's a spirit behind
[1:06:43] it. You start thinking things in your
[1:06:46] mind, hallelujah, about the opposite
[1:06:47] sex. There's a spirit behind it.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; And only your heart can put it in the
[1:06:53] right compartment.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:59] Just forgive me. I'm just a blood hound.
[1:07:00] I believe in grace.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; I believe in grace. The grace of God.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; And I believe that when God brings a
[1:07:08] word, he want us to hallelujah examine
[1:07:11] ourself and do what's right. Don't look
[1:07:14] for excuses to keep the things that you
[1:07:16] in love with.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Everybody all right?
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; And let me say this. When the word of
[1:07:27] God comes like this, it is not a rebuke.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; It's God's love on display.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Cuz the Bible says, "Whom God love it,
[1:07:37] he rebuke and what?
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Chasen."
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Tonight, God is behind
[1:07:43] somebody chasing them.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; You say, "Bro Digs, you beating on me."
[1:07:48] No, God is chasing Moique. God is
[1:07:50] chasing.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The thing is, will you give
[1:07:55] him your heart?
[1:07:58] Hallelujah.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; If God gets your heart, that'll take
[1:08:02] care of your mind.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; That'll take care of your actions.
[1:08:07] That'll take care of your strength.
[1:08:09] Hallelujah. Cuz in your weakest days, if
[1:08:11] you've given God your heart, something
[1:08:14] will come from way down. Hallelujah.
[1:08:17] Just to fight another day.
[1:08:22] Hallelujah. But look, church, he said,
[1:08:25] "As a man thinkketh in his heart, so is
[1:08:27] he." Now, if I can
[1:08:30] listen, I'mma give you some statistics.
[1:08:32] And I I by God's grace, I don't want to
[1:08:34] be long, but I'm going to give you some
[1:08:37] statistics.
[1:08:40] Heart disease
[1:08:43] is the leading cause of death for men
[1:08:47] that's been done in a study
[1:08:50] in your natural body. Hallelujah. One of
[1:08:53] the first things to collapse
[1:08:56] is your heart.
[1:09:00] And your heart is the compartment where
[1:09:02] all the blood flows to.
[1:09:06] Hallelujah. And I'll show you how
[1:09:08] important the heart is. Hallelujah. You
[1:09:11] can live brain dead.
[1:09:15] You know that
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; they can keep you on a machine.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; You just be out of your mind.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; People come in there trying to talk to
[1:09:22] you. You like
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; brain dead, but your heart still
[1:09:27] pumping.
[1:09:30] There's too many people in church,
[1:09:32] hallelujah, in that condition.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; They hearing the word of God, but they
[1:09:37] won't, Hallelujah, Sister Lane staff,
[1:09:39] they will not interact with it. They're
[1:09:41] brain dead,
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; and the heart is pumping. The blood is
[1:09:45] running warm through your veins, but you
[1:09:47] won't accept what you heard. Oh my. You
[1:09:51] hooked up to a machine. That's the worst
[1:09:54] place to be. Because once the machine
[1:09:56] dies, so will you.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; And in some of our cases, hallelujah,
[1:10:04] the machine might be a good church.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; As long as you go into, hallelujah, that
[1:10:11] church, everything is good,
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; but let your church shut down.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let your church go through
[1:10:19] something.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Then it will show what's really in your
[1:10:22] heart.
[1:10:29] Oh, good family. My mom and daddy, you
[1:10:32] know, they blessed and highly favored.
[1:10:34] Everybody love my mom and daddy. But let
[1:10:36] mom and daddy start going through
[1:10:37] something.
[1:10:39] Then can you serve God?
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; I know it's getting tight on some of
[1:10:47] y'all, so I knew I had to bring some
[1:10:48] help.
[1:10:54] Y'all ain't going to sit here and stare
[1:10:55] at me tonight.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:00] Word of God coming.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, we going we going to bless God
[1:11:05] tonight.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; The word of God is true.
[1:11:09] I said the word of God is true. The word
[1:11:12] of God is true. I love the word of God.
[1:11:17] I love the word of God.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:21] You want to be blessed? Amen the word.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen means so be it.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Think about it, church. Some of you come
[1:11:29] to church and you don't even amen the
[1:11:31] word. You know why? Because it's not in
[1:11:33] your heart.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; It's intellectual.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; I'm in church. I'm I'm here with mom and
[1:11:42] daddy. But are you experiencing God?
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you hear that word, can
[1:11:49] you relate?
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; See, you you hear them sisters saying,
[1:11:53] "Amen."
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; They can relate.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; When you can relate, hallelujah, you
[1:12:00] respond.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:05] If God has your heart, the number one
[1:12:08] killer among men is heart disease.
[1:12:11] The heart, hallelujah, starts to get
[1:12:14] infected.
[1:12:16] What happens? The flow of the blood is
[1:12:20] not flowing as freely as it ought to.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; It's in the body, but it's a struggle to
[1:12:28] get to those compartments.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; And as it struggles to get through those
[1:12:34] compartments, the heart works harder.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Do you not know your heart is not
[1:12:40] supposed to be working hard?
[1:12:44] Hallelujah. And if I can say it like
[1:12:46] this, when you fall in love with God,
[1:12:49] hallelujah, it's not something hard.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Because God is the one doing all the
[1:12:55] work.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; God becomes the healer when you're sick.
[1:12:59] God becomes a deliverer when you're
[1:13:01] bound. God becomes the provider when
[1:13:03] you're lacking.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:06] So your heart beats a little bit more
[1:13:09] smoothly because you're depending on the
[1:13:11] one you're in love with.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; But what happens is the blood doesn't
[1:13:20] flow as freely as it ought to. So the
[1:13:23] heart starts working extra hard, extra
[1:13:25] hard. And what that does, that puts the
[1:13:28] whole body under pressure.
[1:13:30] And if the heart stops receiving,
[1:13:34] hallelujah, the amount of blood it's
[1:13:36] supposed to, now doctors don't tell you
[1:13:38] this. I'm I'm I'mma tell you something.
[1:13:43] Even if a vow
[1:13:45] is set off,
[1:13:48] the blood in your body, your body is
[1:13:51] made such a way by the infinite God.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that that blood can't get
[1:13:58] there, it'll try to find another route.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; So if you won't give your God, you won't
[1:14:06] give God your heart tonight, he will
[1:14:08] find another route.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; And he got to take something precious
[1:14:13] out of your life, he will find another
[1:14:15] route. But he will, hallelujah, without
[1:14:19] measure get to your heart.
[1:14:25] But be and I ain't got nothing against
[1:14:26] doctors. I appreciate doctors.
[1:14:29] But the first thing they do when they
[1:14:30] see a clock, they think about that.
[1:14:34] Let's operate.
[1:14:37] Let's put a pacemaker in there. Let's
[1:14:40] put something in there to alter your
[1:14:43] life.
[1:14:44] And what we do, we look for things to
[1:14:47] alter the heartbeat
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; instead of it flowing naturally.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have things in our life
[1:14:56] that we put in place of God earlier.
[1:14:59] Things that reflect him, but it's not
[1:15:01] the whole God. We'll come to church.
[1:15:04] We'll get on the choir.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Praise
[1:15:14] the Lord, oh my soul.
[1:15:18] I won't be quiet. My God is alive. How
[1:15:22] can I keep it inside?
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you do that in church. But when
[1:15:29] you not in church,
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; how can you be quiet then?
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; If your God is alive, he's alive
[1:15:37] wherever you are.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; He's not just alive when you in church.
[1:15:41] Church is your substitute. But what
[1:15:43] about at your job? What about at your
[1:15:45] school? What about at your house?
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Can you be quiet then?
[1:15:52] If God doesn't have your heart, you most
[1:15:55] certainly will be.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; But a person who's given God their
[1:15:59] heart, Hallelujah. Amen. There are
[1:16:02] certain conditions.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's look church. Listen.
[1:16:09] Some things that causes heart disease.
[1:16:12] Everybody. All right.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Heart disease. One of the first killers
[1:16:18] of heart disease is lifestyle.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; A person's lifestyle
[1:16:26] is the first thing, hallelujah, that
[1:16:29] affects their heart.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; They may be partying. They may be going
[1:16:34] places they ain't supposed to go. They
[1:16:36] having a they having a good time. Go to
[1:16:40] the club, but they be in church on
[1:16:42] Sunday.
[1:16:49] [Applause]
[1:16:52] You know what? I notice a young people's
[1:16:54] meeting, but I see all you adults. You
[1:16:56] know what I'm talking about.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:06] But it's lifestyle.
[1:17:08] Doing things that are bad for your
[1:17:11] heart.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. maybe uh uh smoking
[1:17:16] or eating habits.
[1:17:19] See, I'm at a age now where I watch what
[1:17:21] I eat
[1:17:23] because the body is not regenerating as
[1:17:26] fast as it used to be. I used to could
[1:17:28] eat a whole pizza and go to bed.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Can't do that now.
[1:17:34] eat that piece if I want to be sitting
[1:17:35] up looking at the ceiling
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; cuz the body doesn't digest it as fast
[1:17:43] as it used to when I was younger.
[1:17:45] Hallelujah. My heart needs a rest.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; And then you have this thing you didn't
[1:17:51] ate. Some of us, we know we shouldn't be
[1:17:53] eating because of the lifestyle, but we
[1:17:55] eat it because we like it.
[1:18:00] And some of us know we shouldn't be
[1:18:02] doing what we do, but we do it because
[1:18:06] we like it.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Brings me to the story. Remember the
[1:18:17] prophet was on the pull pit and the
[1:18:18] maniac came and the maniac, Hallelujah,
[1:18:21] I'mma break every bone in your body.
[1:18:23] Hallelujah. The prophet just stood there
[1:18:24] and then God came down. He said, "Since
[1:18:26] you challenged the spirit of the Lord,
[1:18:28] you going to fall over my feet." Man
[1:18:29] fell down. Police, everybody looking
[1:18:31] crazy like, "What's happening? What's
[1:18:33] happening? Is he dead?" Prophet said,
[1:18:34] "No, he ain't dead." He said, "What you
[1:18:37] want? What you want to do? What can we
[1:18:40] save him? Can we say no?" He worshiped
[1:18:42] that spirit.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; It's in Can you imagine a man in love
[1:18:48] with going around the world fighting
[1:18:50] preachers?
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; There are still people on the earth like
[1:18:54] that.
[1:18:57] Hallelujah. They get they get joy out of
[1:19:00] coming to church and being a
[1:19:02] distraction.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Sitting right up under the pastor's
[1:19:07] ministry and won't get your life right.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Come in there every week.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Every week. Even ask the pastor for
[1:19:15] counseling. Get the counseling and still
[1:19:18] won't do it.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz you love that thing.
[1:19:26] You love that thing.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; When a drug addict get those drugs in
[1:19:34] their body
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; and it takes over, they'll steal from
[1:19:38] their mama.
[1:19:40] You know why? Cuz they love that name.
[1:19:44] I can't help myself.
[1:19:47] Mama, I love you, but it's something
[1:19:49] else I love more.
[1:19:52] Making them lose their mind. You know
[1:19:54] what it is? Hallelujah. It's something
[1:19:56] on the inside that's taking over.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; My. Somebody say my
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; listen.
[1:20:12] As I'm going through this, I want you to
[1:20:14] examine your heart.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Like I say, I'm not going to be long.
[1:20:18] Hallelujah. I'm not here to make you do
[1:20:20] anything. I'm here to make you aware.
[1:20:24] Hallelujah.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; My job, Hallelujah, tonight is just to
[1:20:29] make you aware.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; I'm a gift, Hallelujah, for you just to
[1:20:33] make you aware. And my subject tonight
[1:20:36] is make you aware of the conditions of
[1:20:39] your heart.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; While you sitting in church,
[1:20:46] uhoh, think about this. Think about
[1:20:50] this. We are in a place that was
[1:20:54] ordained of God.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; This building was supernaturally put
[1:20:59] here by God.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; And think about it. You are in a place
[1:21:04] that God divinely ordered before the
[1:21:06] foundation of the world and you're not
[1:21:09] even saved,
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; not even filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:17] What does that mean? your lifestyle.
[1:21:22] Something else has your heart.
[1:21:26] Hallelujah.
[1:21:28] Think about that.
[1:21:33] God,
[1:21:37] think about that. Something else has
[1:21:39] your heart. You're sitting in a place
[1:21:42] where God comes regularly and you have
[1:21:44] no desire to interact with him.
[1:21:50] conditions
[1:21:52] of the heart.
[1:21:54] You can go out and remember what I said,
[1:21:57] but we want more than memory.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants action.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Let's keep going. Listen now. What did I
[1:22:10] just talk about?
[1:22:18] lifestyle.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Let's make this real clear. This is not
[1:22:22] an insurance seminar.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; I don't have some special rates. I'mma
[1:22:29] give you pass out some pens or some
[1:22:31] booklets.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; No, what I'm trying to give you tonight
[1:22:35] is eternal life,
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; an experience with God. Hallelujah.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my. The devil ain't going to want to
[1:22:44] hear that. But hallelujah, a prophet
[1:22:46] came and told us who we are. I got the
[1:22:49] power to impart eternal life tonight.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; If you follow along with me, if you get
[1:22:57] on board with me, I got the power
[1:22:59] tonight to put eternal life right in
[1:23:02] front of you.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; But it's up to you to accept it.
[1:23:06] Hallelujah.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; I know I got it. I know I can give it
[1:23:09] out. But will you receive it?
[1:23:13] That what the scripture says.
[1:23:14] Hallelujah. The scripture says to
[1:23:17] whomsoever you impart will be imparted.
[1:23:19] Whomsoever you remit will be remitted.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Think about that. I'm right here
[1:23:31] preaching to you trying to remit your
[1:23:34] sins,
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; but it's up to you.
[1:23:40] Like I said,
[1:23:43] I got I got three kids
[1:23:47] and when they were younger, they had
[1:23:49] worldly tendencies.
[1:23:51] You know, even though they were in
[1:23:52] church, they had worldly tendencies.
[1:23:55] Even though they they they father was a
[1:23:57] preacher,
[1:23:59] they had worldly tendencies. You know
[1:24:01] what had to happen? They had to get
[1:24:02] converted.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Didn't matter who they was. You know,
[1:24:07] when I crossed the border into Canada, I
[1:24:10] had to go through the scanner.
[1:24:11] Hallelujah. I couldn't stand to the side
[1:24:13] and say, "Let my kids through." They
[1:24:15] say, "No, they got to be scanned, too."
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I want you to
[1:24:20] understand, hallelujah. No matter where
[1:24:22] your house, no matter where your church,
[1:24:24] no matter who your family is, you got to
[1:24:27] be scanned.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; You got to have the goods to cross over
[1:24:32] to the other side.
[1:24:36] You can't go off somebody's reputation.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But you know what? As
[1:24:42] parents, we have thoughts. I know with
[1:24:44] me, I say, "Boy, I sure wish I could
[1:24:46] give the Holy Ghost. I sure wish I could
[1:24:48] just pour it in them." Every day they'd
[1:24:50] come home, brother Danny, I'd have me a
[1:24:53] gallon of Holy Ghost.
[1:24:56] Come on. Come on. Let's get this. Come
[1:24:58] on. Let's get this Holy Come on. Drink.
[1:25:00] Be like a sorority. Drink. Drink. Drink.
[1:25:03] Drink. Dr. Dr. Drink.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; They be so drunk to they staggering.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Where was you? Where was you? I just got
[1:25:15] more Holy Ghost.
[1:25:19] Parents, don't we wish we could do that?
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; I'd line them up one by one. Hallelujah.
[1:25:27] And every day they go, every day they
[1:25:29] come home, I have a fresh gallon.
[1:25:32] They be like, "Daddy, man, we got the
[1:25:35] Holy Ghost yesterday." I say, "You going
[1:25:37] to get a rebirth.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; You going to get a double portion. Get
[1:25:42] on over here and drink before you get a
[1:25:43] whipping."
[1:25:49] Hallelujah. We wish we could do it as
[1:25:51] parents, but all we can do is live it
[1:25:54] and put it in front of you. It's up to
[1:25:55] you to fall in love with it.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me say it like this.
[1:26:00] Parents, your kids know if God don't
[1:26:03] have your heart.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Some of your hearts housewife sit home,
[1:26:08] her heart belong to the young and the
[1:26:10] restless.
[1:26:16] She'll be the young and the old cuz that
[1:26:19] what happening to them.
[1:26:21] Oh, as the world dies,
[1:26:26] they say as the world turns, as the
[1:26:27] world dies, that's what's happening. You
[1:26:30] watch the same old stuff over and over
[1:26:31] and over again.
[1:26:34] But now we've given our heart to
[1:26:35] Netflix.
[1:26:39] I ain't going to the movies. I'm just
[1:26:41] got my popcorn at home.
[1:26:45] Amen. Let me leave you alone. Let me Let
[1:26:47] me leave you alone. Let me leave it
[1:26:50] alone. Amen. It's your house.
[1:26:53] Hallelujah.
[1:26:54] But listen,
[1:26:56] first thing we talked about was what?
[1:26:59] Okay, about five of you. Amen. Praise
[1:27:01] the Lord. The rest of you going you you
[1:27:04] think you're going to give me mannequin
[1:27:05] worship tonight.
[1:27:11] No, I say I'm I'm I'm kind of strange.
[1:27:14] When nobody ain't looking, I go up and
[1:27:16] slap the mannequin.
[1:27:20] Stop looking at me like that.
[1:27:23] Don't feel like that mannequin be
[1:27:24] following you through the store. You
[1:27:26] just you just doing your thing. Every
[1:27:27] time you turn around, he's looking at
[1:27:29] you.
[1:27:32] That's how people do you in church. When
[1:27:34] you walking away, they looking at you.
[1:27:35] When you turn around, they looking down
[1:27:36] at the floor.
[1:27:41] I don't bite. I bless.
[1:27:46] Hallelujah.
[1:27:48] Hallelujah. We ain't come to bite
[1:27:50] tonight. We come to bless.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. Let me move forward.
[1:27:55] Amen. Everybody all right?
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Listen. First thing is lifestyle.
[1:28:00] Amen. And healthy factors including like
[1:28:04] smoking and drinking and all these
[1:28:06] things. It says one other thing that
[1:28:09] that that that messes with your heart
[1:28:12] causes heart disease. A thing called
[1:28:14] blood pressure.
[1:28:17] There some of you in here taking blood
[1:28:18] pressure pills.
[1:28:20] Let me tell you them pills ain't
[1:28:22] working.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to drop a bomb on you tonight.
[1:28:27] You taking them pills and it's making
[1:28:30] your pressure down. That's your faith
[1:28:32] doing that.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; You believe in them pills.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; So they working for you.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; It's your faith using those pills.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus Christ.
[1:28:46] [Applause]
[1:28:50] What? You thought it was the pill? No,
[1:28:51] it's your faith doing it.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; If you taking it because you believe in
[1:28:56] it.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; I didn't told the devil secret.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; You thought it was the pills working.
[1:29:02] No, it's your faith.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Ain't no power to heal in no pills.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; All it can do is, hallelujah, is sedate.
[1:29:11] So if you take it and believe in it,
[1:29:13] it's your faith causing those pills to
[1:29:16] work.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus Christ.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; My
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; I know that's a challenge to you. Amen.
[1:29:28] Because he said you look for a quote
[1:29:30] now. Brother Adam said God used doctors.
[1:29:36] Yeah. But he said Moses was in the
[1:29:38] wilderness for 40 years without a
[1:29:41] doctor.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; It's up to you which one you going to
[1:29:45] choose. Which one you going to give your
[1:29:46] heart to?
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I ain't against wherever
[1:29:50] your faith is, that's what you do. H.
[1:29:53] But as for me, I'm looking for the
[1:29:55] supernatural.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:59] Blood pressure. One of the things that
[1:30:02] affects the conditions of the heart is
[1:30:05] something called pressure.
[1:30:07] Hallelujah. And you know, I asked the
[1:30:09] question many times. I go talk to young
[1:30:12] people. I ask them, hallelujah, brother
[1:30:14] Miguel. I ask them, "Who's under more
[1:30:16] pressure? The girls or the guys?" And
[1:30:19] immediately the girls like, "We are.
[1:30:23] We are. We are under more pressure. Them
[1:30:26] boys, them boys ain't going through
[1:30:28] that. We under pressure. Everywhere we
[1:30:30] go, how we dress, how we look, what we
[1:30:32] say, we under more pressure.
[1:30:38] Maybe looking at the brothers like, "I
[1:30:40] wish you would open your mouth."
[1:30:43] You know, y'all ain't under no pressure.
[1:30:44] We under all the pressure. The way we
[1:30:46] dress, the way we look. We can't even We
[1:30:48] can't even rock in church without
[1:30:50] somebody saying, "Why you moving that
[1:30:51] fast?
[1:30:56] Come on, sisters.
[1:30:58] [Applause]
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; I'm with you tonight.
[1:31:06] Hallelujah. But then the brothers will
[1:31:08] say, "No, we're under more pressure. We
[1:31:11] got to provide. We got to have a good
[1:31:13] job. We got to watch what we look at.
[1:31:22] We can't wear shorts. We can't wear tank
[1:31:24] tops. We under more pressure."
[1:31:32] Pressure.
[1:31:34] Some of you are doing what you're doing
[1:31:35] because you're under pressure. And your
[1:31:38] peers are the ones that's putting you
[1:31:39] under pressure.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Well, let me say it like this. If you
[1:31:43] believe in God and they don't believe in
[1:31:46] God, that's not your peer.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; A peer is somebody that's equal to you.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; A peer is somebody that believe what you
[1:31:53] believe. If they don't believe what you
[1:31:54] believe, that's not your peer.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, you need to stop being
[1:31:59] around that person because you are not
[1:32:01] equally yoked.
[1:32:06] Hallelujah.
[1:32:08] And we let people who are not even on
[1:32:10] the same level spiritually put us under
[1:32:14] pressure.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; You go to school, girl, you got your
[1:32:17] long jean skirt on. You ought to walk up
[1:32:19] in there like you a supermodel.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; I can't even do the stupid walk.
[1:32:28] Look like they be stomping on something.
[1:32:32] You ought to walk up in there proud
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; because what you're doing, you're
[1:32:37] representing the glory of God.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; You in your dress of holiness, you're
[1:32:42] representing God's heart. Because God is
[1:32:45] a holy God. You are not to let somebody
[1:32:48] put you under pressure because you look
[1:32:51] like God.
[1:32:57] And for those of you who leave out the
[1:33:00] house and got other stuff in that book
[1:33:02] bag,
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; don't make me go get the amen sign.
[1:33:13] You got something. I didn't seen it
[1:33:14] personally. Hallelujah. Go get Go get
[1:33:17] the book bag. Hallelujah. Go change. Go
[1:33:19] in the bathroom and change. Come out
[1:33:21] with something kneeh high.
[1:33:23] Still a skirt, but it's just revealing
[1:33:24] more. Ain't bold enough to put them
[1:33:26] pants on
[1:33:29] cuz you put that skirt on, walk out
[1:33:30] there like I'm one of them. Then the
[1:33:32] other girls are cool girls looking at
[1:33:34] you like,
[1:33:36] "Girl, you trying too hard.
[1:33:48] You don't know they talking behind your
[1:33:50] back.
[1:33:52] giving up all the tea.
[1:33:58] It's a young people's meeting. You you
[1:33:59] younger you older folks, you don't know
[1:34:01] what I'm doing right now.
[1:34:04] You looking like what what is he trying
[1:34:06] to snap his fingers? What what what is
[1:34:08] he doing?
[1:34:09] What what what
[1:34:13] you go home have a sit down. See, that's
[1:34:15] the problem with us as parents. We are
[1:34:18] disconnected.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If your girl, hallelujah,
[1:34:22] got a question about holiness, she
[1:34:24] should come to you first, mom.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz you should be an
[1:34:30] example. Hallelujah.
[1:34:32] Brothers, if your son got a question of
[1:34:34] what it's like to be a man, those
[1:34:37] questions you should be able to answer.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; But we disconnected.
[1:34:44] Well, we do
[1:34:47] soon as the child got a question. Well,
[1:34:49] what you know, girl come to mom, mom, I
[1:34:52] feel like I feel like wearing pants. The
[1:34:56] devil
[1:35:02] I bind that spirit.
[1:35:06] Brother Brandham said
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; they ain't gonna never come back to you
[1:35:15] again.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Cuz you do not understand the tenderness
[1:35:22] of their heart.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; They have questions. They're searching
[1:35:27] for truth and all you want to do is bust
[1:35:30] them across the head with a quote.
[1:35:36] Oh my. We're supposed to be connected in
[1:35:39] the home. Hallelujah. Even if you're a
[1:35:42] child. Amen. I learned something.
[1:35:44] Everybody all right?
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; I learned something from a brother named
[1:35:48] Kim Boyer. He's going to be with the
[1:35:50] Lord now. But when I used to go,
[1:35:53] Hallelujah. him and Sister Shelly. When
[1:35:55] I used to go to their house in Calgary,
[1:35:58] Hallelujah. At least three of their boys
[1:36:00] wasn't serving the Lord at that time.
[1:36:02] Hallelujah. But every time I would come
[1:36:05] over, they'd come over.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; We'd fellowship. We go play ball. We go
[1:36:10] ride go-karts. And we'd have a good
[1:36:13] dinner.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know why they would come? Cuz
[1:36:17] they say, "When Brother D's come, mama
[1:36:19] going to cook something good."
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother Cadre
[1:36:26] ain't made it in yet.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; They say, "We on the way." And those
[1:36:30] boys would come, we'd eat, fellowship,
[1:36:32] didn't even have to talk about the Lord.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; But one thing I understood, one thing I
[1:36:37] took away from that family relationship,
[1:36:39] those boys love the God and their mommy
[1:36:42] and daddy.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Even though they weren't living up to
[1:36:47] the standard, hallelujah, they didn't
[1:36:50] feel dirty when they got around their
[1:36:52] parents, they felt loved.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why some of our
[1:36:58] children are not converted because when
[1:37:00] they got questions to ask us, they don't
[1:37:02] feel like you going to respond in love.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; But I knew those boys love mama and
[1:37:12] daddy.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz they'd come around and
[1:37:16] fellowship with me even though I was the
[1:37:18] preacher and I preaching just like I
[1:37:20] preach right now.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; But they wasn't afraid of me.
[1:37:24] Hallelujah. They would fellowship.
[1:37:26] Hallelujah. Eat everything. Have a good
[1:37:28] time. Then they go back to their life.
[1:37:29] Hallelujah. What was their purpose? They
[1:37:32] love their family.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; They knew mom and daddy loved them even
[1:37:37] though they wasn't living right or up to
[1:37:40] the standard. Let me say it like that.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; And you know that taught me something.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; That taught me what good is a Christian
[1:37:51] life if your kids don't see it in you?
[1:37:57] Oh, we we can come to church and fake
[1:37:59] one another out.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; God is the joy.
[1:38:03] [Music]
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; You do all that stuff in church and
[1:38:10] while you doing it, your kids looking at
[1:38:12] you like, "Man,
[1:38:14] please, man, please." Soon as you get
[1:38:17] home, you got that pot swinging about
[1:38:19] the n I'm about
[1:38:23] speaking with your triny accent.
[1:38:27] Don't play with me. You know
[1:38:35] y'all know I was half trini ain't it?
[1:38:39] Got a little Jamaica rice in peace plan
[1:38:42] 10.
[1:38:47] I love my people.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:52] But church,
[1:38:54] pressure. Let me say that because I'm
[1:38:57] running out of time.
[1:38:59] Pressure. You ask that question like
[1:39:01] right now. Examine your heart. Are you
[1:39:02] under pressure?
[1:39:05] Only thing that makes it pressure is if
[1:39:08] you don't want to do it.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Dressing right, sisters.
[1:39:14] is not pressure
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; unless you don't want to do it.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Having tattoos and gold chains,
[1:39:23] brothers, that's not pressure unless you
[1:39:27] want to do it.
[1:39:30] The things that makes it pressure is the
[1:39:33] element of sanctification.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The prophet of God said,
[1:39:38] "Hallelujah. We know we're justified as
[1:39:40] if we've never done it. But are we
[1:39:42] sanctified?
[1:39:44] Sanctified is not your outside.
[1:39:46] Sanctified is the inside. Hallelujah.
[1:39:49] Sanctified is is is is Hallelujah. It's
[1:39:52] it's I I love the way he said it like
[1:39:54] this. He said real sanctification is
[1:39:57] when God takes away the want to.
[1:40:06] Now ask yourself, are you converted? Did
[1:40:09] God take away the desire, the want to to
[1:40:12] do it?
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; For those of us who were delivered from
[1:40:15] drinking, hallelujah, we lost the want
[1:40:18] to. There's no more want to. For those
[1:40:20] of us who used to smoke, there's no more
[1:40:22] war to. That's what real sanctification
[1:40:25] is. And when God gets a hold of your
[1:40:28] heart, there's no more war two.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Therefore, no more pressure.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; So, so for the next time you feel like
[1:40:41] you under pressure, ask yourself, why am
[1:40:44] I under pressure if I don't want to do
[1:40:46] it?
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; It's pressure if you want to do it.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Conditions of the heart. Let me move a
[1:40:54] little faster.
[1:40:56] Are you with me?
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Blood pressure, high cholesterol,
[1:41:01] diabetes. Oh, don't get me started about
[1:41:03] that one.
[1:41:08] Diabetes is what you put in your body.
[1:41:13] Your body automatically produces sugar,
[1:41:16] but it's how much you put in there. And
[1:41:18] then when you go to the doctor, they
[1:41:20] say, "Oh my, you got you got diabetes.
[1:41:26] You need to calm down.
[1:41:28] Hold up, Doc.
[1:41:30] I've been there. Hallelujah. Several
[1:41:32] times. Hallelujah. Trying to get me to
[1:41:35] claim this demon.

[1:41:50] west coast, light toast, dark toast. I

[1:41:56] By his stripes, I'm healed.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Make me claim something you didn't
[1:42:02] change the name of.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Make a long story short, doctor come in
[1:42:06] say you got this guy say I ain't got it.
[1:42:09] And you know when nurses get tired of
[1:42:10] you, they say go in the other room.
[1:42:14] Shame on you nurse.
[1:42:17] They get tired of they don't want to
[1:42:19] talk to you. Just please just go on Mr.
[1:42:21] Digs just gone. I said I'm healed. body
[1:42:23] strikes I'm heal and they looking at
[1:42:24] that chart man all this glucose you got
[1:42:27] I don't care if it's east coast
[1:42:30] I ain't got it doc come in and say hey
[1:42:33] you got this you got that said no I
[1:42:34] don't know I don't she said we going to
[1:42:36] do a blood test I said praise God
[1:42:39] praise God if you going to examine me by
[1:42:42] the blood I already win
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; somebody talk do I need to go get my
[1:42:48] sign if you going to examine me by the
[1:42:51] blood I already win. I am under the
[1:42:55] blood.
[1:43:00] She come back and said, "Wow, Mr. Dick,
[1:43:02] you don't got it." I said, "I told you."
[1:43:04] She said, "Well, what did you eat last
[1:43:05] night?" I say, "Sweet tea,
[1:43:08] chocolate chip cookies." She said, "That
[1:43:11] explains it. Sometimes it shows up in
[1:43:14] your body." So I'm sitting there
[1:43:15] thinking I'm like, "Okay, if it's sweet
[1:43:17] tea and chip a hoy, why you change the
[1:43:20] name to diabetes?
[1:43:24] Why you ain't call brother Mr. D? You
[1:43:26] got tea and cookies in your body.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Enemy trying to put you under pressure."
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Let me keep moving.
[1:43:39] Obesity,
[1:43:41] too much of that lifestyle.
[1:43:44] Let me keep going. Hallelujah. Unhealthy
[1:43:47] diet. Hallelujah. I is I hope y'all see
[1:43:50] in the spiritual types of these things
[1:43:52] I'm talking about.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Obesity. Too much unhealthy diet.
[1:43:56] Something that's automatically going to
[1:43:58] make you sick.
[1:44:01] Think about your life. Think about
[1:44:02] what's really on your heart. Do you have
[1:44:04] things in your diet that automatically
[1:44:07] is going to make it rough for you?
[1:44:12] things that you do.
[1:44:15] Listen. Oh my. Excessive alcohol.
[1:44:26] Some of y'all looking like, "Not me. I
[1:44:28] don't drink. I don't drink." Spiritual
[1:44:30] application.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Alcohol is what? It's a substance that
[1:44:36] takes over your body.
[1:44:39] How many of you have things in your life
[1:44:41] that takes over your body?
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; It takes over the comprehensive measures
[1:44:48] of your mind.
[1:44:51] You on the internet surfing.
[1:44:54] Too much alcohol.
[1:44:56] Something that's taking over taken over
[1:44:58] you. You can't stop it. You just always
[1:45:00] on that website.
[1:45:03] Excessive alcohol.
[1:45:06] And when it's so bad, you know what
[1:45:07] alcohol do? It makes you drunk.
[1:45:10] Then you start craving it. You want to
[1:45:12] feel that feeling all the time. I can't
[1:45:14] wait till the weekend so I can get drunk
[1:45:18] and forget about my problems.
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:30] Substance that takes over your body. Is
[1:45:33] there anything in your life right now
[1:45:35] that's taken over your heart? You love
[1:45:38] that more than you love God.
[1:45:41] We all had to come through that door.
[1:45:44] But we have things in our life that we
[1:45:46] love more than God. And God is never
[1:45:49] going to play second fiddle to anything.
[1:45:54] Anything. If he has to take you down
[1:45:57] holding on to it, he's going to take you
[1:45:59] down.
[1:46:02] Hallelujah.
[1:46:04] Hallelujah.
[1:46:06] Oh, God. Lord, he love me. Lord, he love
[1:46:11] me. Nobody can treat me like he do. He
[1:46:14] love me.
[1:46:18] God, I'll take you all the way down
[1:46:21] screaming for something that you don't
[1:46:23] need.
[1:46:24] Holding on to a boy that ain't even
[1:46:26] treating you right.
[1:46:32] Oh my.
[1:46:34] I can feel it.
[1:46:37] I feel these relationships in here. You
[1:46:39] can't hide that from the spirit.
[1:46:43] But the thing of it is, you got to ask
[1:46:44] yourself, does that mean more to you
[1:46:46] than heaven?
[1:46:49] You
[1:46:51] brothers, I love you. You going to let
[1:46:53] some nappyheaded boy keep you out of
[1:46:55] heaven?
[1:47:00] Huh?
[1:47:04] I said I love you, brothers. You ain't
[1:47:05] got to look at me like that.
[1:47:10] I was once one of them, too.
[1:47:12] It's just an expression. I know some of
[1:47:14] you got good hair. Come on, man.
[1:47:19] You love that thing more than that.
[1:47:22] And God is dealing with you and you
[1:47:24] won't give it up.
[1:47:28] You going to pay for it. Trust me.
[1:47:31] Especially after tonight.
[1:47:34] And let me say, let me drop a bomb on
[1:47:36] your relationship right now. If he ain't
[1:47:39] a man of God, you ain't the only one.
[1:47:55] A man without the Holy Ghost, he can't
[1:47:57] help but wonder
[1:48:00] cuz woman was designed and created for
[1:48:03] man.
[1:48:04] What's going to stop him from having
[1:48:06] more than one? The only thing is the
[1:48:08] Holy Ghost.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; He'll get tired of you and be like,
[1:48:12] "Hey, man. She all right. She nice.
[1:48:14] Look, everything good, but I'm just
[1:48:16] tired of them.
[1:48:21] Thank Thank you, sister.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Just in case y'all ain't heard her, she
[1:48:26] said that ain't nothing but the truth.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Young young young sister, I'm saying
[1:48:34] this because I love you. And what I'm
[1:48:37] saying is, hallelujah. God is dealing
[1:48:40] with the conditions of your heart.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; There are things holding you back from
[1:48:44] completely giving it to God.
[1:48:48] Oh my. And I don't want to be like that.
[1:48:50] Hallelujah. Oh my.
[1:48:57] Just in case I've been preaching for
[1:48:59] about an hour.
[1:49:02] I'm about to close. Don't get nervous.
[1:49:06] Listen, this is the one I like. It says
[1:49:10] excessive alcohol use and sleep apnnea.
[1:49:17] A lack of rest
[1:49:22] can give you heart disease.
[1:49:26] How many of us in here tonight, young
[1:49:28] people, young and old, really have rest?
[1:49:41] I ain't talking about that melatonin you
[1:49:42] taking at night.
[1:49:46] I'm talking about real rest where you
[1:49:48] put your faith in God and say, "Lord, I
[1:49:51] know this is this is this is uh uh I'm
[1:49:53] going through this. I don't know what it
[1:49:54] is, but I put it in your hands.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Rest." Hallelujah. We got things in our
[1:50:00] life that we think about all day, every
[1:50:02] day. You need rest.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Young people, you need rest.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, who I'mma marry? I'm going just I
[1:50:11] need to move to another church. Ain't
[1:50:12] nobody want to date me. All these things
[1:50:14] you need rest.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; When I get 18, I'm moving to America.
[1:50:22] Don't come over there.
[1:50:30] You ain't going to find rest like that.
[1:50:36] Some of you brothers way out in
[1:50:38] Australia. I'm going go to Australia.
[1:50:39] No,
[1:50:42] that ain't rest. Rest is trusting the
[1:50:45] Lord.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Rest is leaning up on something and it
[1:50:49] becomes your strength.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you have rest tonight,
[1:50:54] young person?
[1:50:56] [Applause]
[1:50:58] See, real rest is you don't care what
[1:51:01] nobody say.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; You don't even care how it look.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; You just know that God got you.
[1:51:10] [Applause]
[1:51:13] Hallelujah. Oh my church, I got rest.
[1:51:16] Hallelujah. Cuz cuz cuz I know people
[1:51:19] didn't talked about me, made up things,
[1:51:21] say I'm uh too radical, say I'm
[1:51:24] Pentecost, all these things. I don't
[1:51:26] care.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; I look at it like this. Every door
[1:51:33] closed, God closed it. Every door open,
[1:51:36] God opened it. Every friendship I got,
[1:51:39] God gave it. Every friendship I don't
[1:51:41] have, God did it.
[1:51:46] My heart belongs to God.
[1:51:49] And just because you got something to
[1:51:52] say that you don't understand about me,
[1:51:54] that ain't going to put me under
[1:51:56] pressure.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; I know God is in control.
[1:52:02] [Applause]
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Young person, that's how you got to be.
[1:52:06] Hallelujah. It don't matter if the
[1:52:08] person beside you shouting and you not.
[1:52:10] Hallelujah. You do what God tell you to
[1:52:12] do.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; You be what God want you to be. Don't
[1:52:17] try to be with somebody else just to be
[1:52:19] pleasing in their sight.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:25] Don't get mad at me. Brother Danny knew
[1:52:27] what I was when he invited me.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:32] Look, church. Real rest through it all.
[1:52:36] You have to believe that God is on your
[1:52:38] side.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Your heart has been given to him.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; No matter what you go through, no matter
[1:52:46] how bad it looks, hallelujah, you find
[1:52:48] rest in him. Hallelujah. See, I'm I'm
[1:52:52] I'm going to let you tap in to to to to
[1:52:55] my life for a second. Hallelujah. This
[1:52:58] is the way I look at it, bro.
[1:53:00] Hallelujah. When I go through things
[1:53:02] Hallelujah. And it may be on a scale.
[1:53:05] Hallelujah. The one to 10, it may be a
[1:53:07] 10.2.
[1:53:10] Hallelujah. Everybody see that.
[1:53:12] Everybody looking at it and like, "Wow,
[1:53:14] my
[1:53:17] problem is we got too many elephants in
[1:53:20] the church." You know who was? That was
[1:53:22] one of Job homeboys.
[1:53:26] He was supposed to be his friend, a
[1:53:28] message believer. First, Joe, come on,
[1:53:30] man. Stop lying to us. You know you a
[1:53:32] secret s
[1:53:35] and the whole thing was about God
[1:53:36] proving the devil wrong. You see how we
[1:53:38] be looking at one another?
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You looking at somebody
[1:53:42] trying out judging him and it's God
[1:53:44] proving a point to the devil.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; He told the devil, "Hallelujah. You go
[1:53:50] ahead and take him. Put your hand on his
[1:53:52] life. I guarantee you he won't stop
[1:53:54] serving me."
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; But that ain't the point. I'm making the
[1:54:01] point I make is hallelujah the way I
[1:54:04] look at things if I'm a son of God for
[1:54:07] me to fail or anything that's connected
[1:54:09] to me to fail hallelujah that means
[1:54:12] hallelujah God's reputation fails
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm trusting in him hallelujah I'm
[1:54:20] depending on him I giving him my heart
[1:54:23] and you think God with his reputation on
[1:54:25] the line going to make himself look
[1:54:32] Hallelujah.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; We need rest.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:39] Look here. This is This is This is This
[1:54:42] is maybe the last one. Hallelujah. We
[1:54:45] almost there. We ain't been in church
[1:54:46] two hours yet.
[1:54:48] I got about three of you.
[1:54:55] Y'all know if we was at the hockey game,
[1:54:57] boy, we'll be in that.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Ain't even got the P.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; You in the stands acting up.
[1:55:10] First game I ever went to
[1:55:12] was out in Edmonton
[1:55:14] and I didn't realize
[1:55:17] that it's you. It's the people that
[1:55:20] initiate the fight.
[1:55:26] Y'all hear them laughing? Cuz they know
[1:55:29] when you go to the hockey game, it be
[1:55:30] the people saying, "Fight, fight, fight,
[1:55:32] fight, fight, fight." And next thing you
[1:55:34] know, they
[1:55:38] Why we can't initiate the fight tonight?
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Huh? Why we can't bring the fight to the
[1:55:44] devil?
[1:55:46] He always in our face. Why we can't
[1:55:48] initiate the fight? Why we can't stand
[1:55:51] up in the devil face and say, "Satan,
[1:55:54] you got no power over me.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; You got no power over my mind. You got
[1:55:59] no power over my sleep, my rest, my
[1:56:02] body. You got no power."
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Let's initiate the fight tonight.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's stop coming to church
[1:56:14] and getting beat up.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; But let's let the devil leave out of
[1:56:19] here staggering.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Going back to his imps, going back to
[1:56:23] his angels, saying, "Man, we lost a lot
[1:56:25] tonight.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; We lost a lot tonight."
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; We had some on our side, but they left
[1:56:36] us and they went on the other side.
[1:56:39] I thought they was one of us, but they
[1:56:41] had something that's on their heart.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; The last one I want to deal with,
[1:56:56] what affects heart disease,
[1:56:58] family history.
[1:57:09] Worst thing you can do is confess a
[1:57:12] generational spirit over yourself.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Well, my daddy used to drink, so I
[1:57:19] drank. You didn't gave that devil a open
[1:57:22] door.
[1:57:27] Well, my mama wasn't submissive, so I
[1:57:29] ain't going to be submissive. Ain't no
[1:57:31] man gonna tell me what to do and you
[1:57:32] gonna be by yourself like your mom.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Tolden that generational spirit.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; I'm from the US so I can say this.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; We talking about slavery. Harriet Tubman
[1:57:53] and lady at the back of the bus. They
[1:57:55] were strong women. I don't want no
[1:57:56] strong woman.
[1:58:00] I want somebody tenderhearted,
[1:58:02] kind,
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; sensitive to the spirit.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; I don't want nobody when I say I'm going
[1:58:09] to fast. What you fasting for?
[1:58:18] I try to get closer to God and she got
[1:58:20] always got a question.
[1:58:23] Brother, the worst thing you I shouldn't
[1:58:25] say the worst thing.
[1:58:29] But you get a woman who always got to
[1:58:31] question your every move cuz she a
[1:58:33] strong woman.
[1:58:36] She got a high paying job. Ain't nothing
[1:58:38] wrong with that girl. Bring home that
[1:58:39] money
[1:58:41] cuz you ain't going to run the house.
[1:58:48] Well, you old fashioned.
[1:58:51] No, I'm god fashion.
[1:59:00] People want a traditional spouse without
[1:59:02] a traditional lifestyle
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; or a traditional God.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Oh man, honey, when we get married, we
[1:59:14] going to make our own vows.
[1:59:17] You know why they doing that? So they
[1:59:19] can take obey out.
[1:59:26] Those of y'all ain't married, y'all
[1:59:28] don't know what I'm talking about.
[1:59:31] But most of the sisters in here who got
[1:59:33] married traditionally
[1:59:35] when they were doing no vow, they say to
[1:59:36] love and to obey and they pause a little
[1:59:40] bit
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; and to obey.
[1:59:52] But now they want to write their own
[1:59:53] vows. Hallelujah. So they can take that
[1:59:55] out. So they can live without that.
[2:00:01] It's confession of your mouth.
[2:00:04] Family history. Family history is very
[2:00:07] important. Hallelujah. Make sure you're
[2:00:10] on the right side of it.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; And what I say, Hallelujah. There going
[2:00:13] to be things in your family that move
[2:00:16] down through the generations, but you
[2:00:18] know what stops it? The Holy Ghost.
[2:00:22] Hallelujah.
[2:00:24] The Holy Ghost, it'll stop alcoholism.
[2:00:28] The Holy Ghost will stop weed, smoking
[2:00:32] marijuana. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost
[2:00:34] will stop pornography.
[2:00:37] The Holy Ghost will stop disobedience.
[2:00:39] Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost will stop
[2:00:41] those generational curses.
[2:00:47] Hallelujah.
[2:00:49] If you get your heart right,
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; it'll stop the devil in his tracks.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:57] And in the midst of all these things,
[2:01:00] even so tonight, God may have come to
[2:01:04] your door. And I know he did
[2:01:07] cuz the atmosphere is too riched
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; for God not to be dealing with somebody.
[2:01:14] But this is the key.
[2:01:17] For those of us who know God dealing
[2:01:19] with us and still don't want to give up,
[2:01:24] get that heart right. The greatest
[2:01:27] disease of the heart is pride.
[2:01:37] You'll sit in here right now and know
[2:01:39] you ain't right
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; and walk out the same way cuz of pride.
[2:01:47] Pride and you love that thing.
[2:01:52] You don't want to give it up. Ask
[2:01:55] yourself tonight, has the word of God
[2:01:57] talked to me? Am I at least in one of
[2:02:01] those areas? Am I struggling in one of
[2:02:03] those areas? If you are, don't let pride
[2:02:06] let you walk out here with it again.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; I ain't saying you got to come and have
[2:02:12] hands laid on you, but what I'm saying
[2:02:14] is make your confession unto God. Give
[2:02:16] it to God.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; But what pride does, pride will see
[2:02:23] truth and know that they are wrong and
[2:02:26] still won't do it.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; That's Bible.
[2:02:31] I'mma give you an example. Remember
[2:02:34] Nicodemus came up to Jesus.
[2:02:38] He said, "Master, we know you a man sent
[2:02:40] from God. We know this. We know that."
[2:02:44] Tiptoeing by night.
[2:02:46] Don't want the people in the church see
[2:02:48] them get converted.
[2:02:50] I'mma get converted at home.
[2:02:53] I ain't getting baptized in church. Take
[2:02:55] me to Lake Ontario.
[2:02:58] I don't want nobody to be there.
[2:03:05] You don't want nobody to be there, man.
[2:03:08] We going to celebrate with you. What you
[2:03:10] mean?
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Oh, heaven rejoice over
[2:03:14] one soul that repented.
[2:03:16] You give your life to God. We going to
[2:03:18] welcome you into the family tonight. We
[2:03:21] going to have a worship
[2:03:24] cuz the devil has lost another one
[2:03:26] because he didn't know what was in your
[2:03:28] heart.
[2:03:33] Think about it. You got a woman wake up
[2:03:35] every morning in the Bible say, "Man,
[2:03:37] who I'm going to sleep with today? I
[2:03:38] need some money." She wake up every day.
[2:03:41] Her job is prostitution. But then one
[2:03:44] day she heard that the children of God
[2:03:47] were coming her way.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Even though she was a prostitute, nobody
[2:03:54] knew what was in her heart.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So when the opportunity
[2:04:00] came, she gave God a heart. Even though
[2:04:03] she was a prostitute, what was her name?
[2:04:06] Rahab.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Every day before that was erased in her
[2:04:15] confession.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; And she was even talking the language.
[2:04:22] She told them, "Hallelujah." She said,
[2:04:23] "Hey, look at look at her. Hey, y'all
[2:04:25] gonna hide up in there. Whatever this
[2:04:27] and that, man. They come back and say,
[2:04:29] "Look at don't you tell none of our
[2:04:30] business now." She said, "I won't. I
[2:04:32] ain't gonna tell her." She said, "But I
[2:04:33] need from y'all is a true token."
[2:04:38] She even had Holy Ghost language. Where
[2:04:40] was it coming from? From the inside. It
[2:04:43] was already in her heart. All she had to
[2:04:46] do was come to that moment in time and
[2:04:48] surrender.
[2:04:49] [Applause]
[2:04:53] And in that moment, hallelujah, that
[2:04:55] prostitute saved her whole house.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; All her brothers, her sisters,
[2:05:01] everybody. Her mom and her daddy. The
[2:05:03] prostitute did that.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; She saved everybody. Why? Cuz she gave
[2:05:11] her heart to the cause.
[2:05:15] Gave her heart to the cause. And she
[2:05:17] married a good man.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; She married a general. Hallelujah. He
[2:05:21] didn't want none of the fakers.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; He wanted a girl with a testimony.
[2:05:27] [Music]
[2:05:29] [Applause]
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; He wanted a girl that was listening to
[2:05:34] the word. Hallelujah. Rahab say, "We've
[2:05:37] heard what your God did and everybody
[2:05:40] heart melts for fear." She was
[2:05:43] listening.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; She wasn't a prostitute. She was a
[2:05:46] daughter of God.
[2:05:50] Hallelujah.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Oh my Rahab,
[2:05:55] that prostitute was in the lineage of
[2:05:57] Jesus Christ.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; God allow his seed to come through a
[2:06:06] prostitute
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; cuz she got her heart right.
[2:06:13] Don't you judge a book
[2:06:15] by its cover.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; I be thanking God for my son-in-law
[2:06:28] cuz he come out of a Baptist
[2:06:32] upbringing.
[2:06:36] I didn't say this before.
[2:06:38] And when he wanted to date my daughter,
[2:06:41] I said, "Boy, you got to be crazy.
[2:06:44] You don't know about I'm thinking, you
[2:06:46] don't know nothing about this message
[2:06:47] and you ain't getting mine." And I start
[2:06:50] acting crazy.
[2:06:54] Sisters, let me say this. Young girls,
[2:06:55] let me say this. Your daddy means well.
[2:06:58] He feels like he's your protector.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He feel like he's your protector.
[2:07:03] So, he's standing there. He may not even
[2:07:05] see what God see, but he gonna stand his
[2:07:07] ground until God show it to him.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Nothing against you, nothing against
[2:07:11] your relationship, but as a daddy, he's
[2:07:13] there to guard you.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; And I'm tell you, I guard it. I guard it
[2:07:19] crazy.
[2:07:22] I told my daughter, my son-in-law now,
[2:07:23] she said, "Daddy, well, he won't nobody,
[2:07:25] Lord." I said, "Send him to the pastor.
[2:07:28] Don't try to trick me into no Bible
[2:07:30] study.
[2:07:36] I'm just being honest.
[2:07:40] She said, "But daddy, he won't know
[2:07:42] this." I said, "Look at let me tell you
[2:07:43] something. I don't like him and I ain't
[2:07:46] going to never like him."
[2:07:51] Now, would you bring your boyfriend to
[2:07:52] your daddy? He acting crazy like that.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[2:07:57] Nope. Drop me off at the stop sign.
[2:08:00] Cuz
[2:08:02] daddy acted a fool.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; And I was I was acting a fool. But I
[2:08:08] ain't know that at the moment. I'm just
[2:08:10] protecting in the only way I know how.
[2:08:13] Hallelujah. Y'all know I had to heed
[2:08:14] those words. I ain't going to never like
[2:08:16] him. He my son now.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; He my son.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Loves this word. Loves
[2:08:25] everything that I love about this word.
[2:08:27] God made me eat those words. It's
[2:08:30] basically God say, "God gave me a new
[2:08:32] ministry, church."
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Powerful ministry.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell it to you.
[2:08:38] Powerful ministry. It ain't too many
[2:08:40] people preach on it, but it's powerful.
[2:08:42] It ain't it it ain't expressed in the
[2:08:44] church enough. Powerful ministry, I'm
[2:08:47] going tell y'all. It's called the Shut
[2:08:48] Your Mouth Ministry.
[2:09:02] Boy, that was deep, wasn't it?
[2:09:05] That what God told me. Shut your mouth.
[2:09:07] I got it.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; You dedicated her to me. Why you trying
[2:09:11] to take her back? I got it.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Shut up. Be friends to the situation. I
[2:09:16] got it.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; I said, "Yes, Lord."
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:09:22] And God started working. God start to
[2:09:25] move. Next thing you know, my my my my
[2:09:27] son-in-law now comes to me and say,
[2:09:29] "Hey, hey, Mr. D, I want to marry I want
[2:09:31] to marry your daughter." I said, "Boy,
[2:09:32] you got to be crazy." He said, "Yeah,
[2:09:34] I'm for real. I do." You know, "Hey,
[2:09:36] hey, I want to marry." Listen. I said,
[2:09:38] "You sure about that?" I said, "Well,
[2:09:41] y'all of age. I can't stop you, but
[2:09:44] dust, dust, dust, dust, and dust." He
[2:09:46] said, "Okay, but let me tell you
[2:09:47] something. I ain't going to propose. I
[2:09:49] ain't going to do nothing unless I got
[2:09:51] your consent.
[2:09:54] I like put
[2:09:58] Thank you God.
[2:10:01] Oh Lord, you gave me the right one.
[2:10:05] [Applause]
[2:10:11] It was over for me when he made that
[2:10:13] statement. It was over for me.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; He was my guy.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; You know what? God was protecting my
[2:10:22] heart cuz he know what kind of person I
[2:10:26] want. He know what kind of person you
[2:10:27] want for your children. Trust God.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; I need to close. But let me say this.
[2:10:43] Now that we all I think they've been
[2:10:45] married like four years now, five years,
[2:10:47] something like that. I didn't got lost
[2:10:49] in the blessing.
[2:10:51] Hallelujah. But church, when you look at
[2:10:54] things, you may think it ain't, but you
[2:10:56] gave your heart to God. God going to
[2:10:58] protect your heart. Hallelujah. Listen.
[2:11:02] Oh my
[2:11:04] church. The Bible says,
[2:11:07] just to give you scripture,
[2:11:10] the Bible says,
[2:11:12] we read, "For as a man thinkketh in his
[2:11:14] heart, so is he."
[2:11:17] Jeremiah 17 and verse 9 says, "And this
[2:11:21] is why you need a conversion."
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 17:9, it says, "The heart is
[2:11:31] deceitful
[2:11:32] above all things and desperately wicked.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Who can know it?"
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; So you out here and fell in love with a
[2:11:41] guy. Oh, I just love he loved me.
[2:11:45] Is he converted? But are you converted?
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Cuz that love may be desperately wicked.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; This is what the Bible says.
[2:11:57] The heart is desperately wicked. Who can
[2:11:59] trust it?
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; You can't trust your heart without the
[2:12:02] Holy Ghost.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Samson followed his heart and he got his
[2:12:08] eyes plugged out.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the ending thing. I'mma end
[2:12:15] up with. But look, hallelujah. We know
[2:12:19] through the message he say he gave God
[2:12:20] his strength, but he gave Delilah his
[2:12:22] heart.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; He gave his heart to the wrong person.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; And who he gave his heart to gave him
[2:12:30] the greatest trial in his life.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine sleeping with the enemy?
[2:12:39] Got his head in her lap.
[2:12:43] probably going to sleep smiling.
[2:12:47] Boy, boy, I got the baddest girl in
[2:12:50] Toronto.
[2:12:54] Oh, boy. She fine, boy.
[2:12:57] She got good hair.
[2:13:01] She got pretty skin.
[2:13:05] Samson, the Philistines are upon thee,
[2:13:09] church.
[2:13:11] This is how bad it is when your heart is
[2:13:13] not in the right place. Brother Dale,
[2:13:16] after she tried to kill me the first
[2:13:18] time, I'm gone.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:13:28] And if she tried to kill him the first
[2:13:30] time, I'd have been out of there.
[2:13:32] Deuces. Girl, you bad, but I'm gone.
[2:13:46] Don't fall in love with her looks cuz
[2:13:48] she might turn 50 60 one day.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Might need a little dye.
[2:13:57] Need a little chapstick,
[2:14:00] little cream for that skin. I ain't say
[2:14:03] makeup.
[2:14:08] Don't fall in love with that body. She
[2:14:10] going to need a treadmill.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; She might have to work that thing out.
[2:14:17] Don't fall in love with that. Fall in
[2:14:19] love with Catile.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:23] You fall in love with her character, it
[2:14:26] don't matter what her body look like. It
[2:14:28] don't matter what her hair look like.
[2:14:31] You fall in love with the person,
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; not the appeal.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; And that's what it is, church. We fall
[2:14:38] in love with the person of Christ.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Church, think about it. Samson had Oh,
[2:14:43] he was so blinded by the wickedness of
[2:14:46] his heart,
[2:14:48] the not knowing of his heart.
[2:14:50] Delila tried to kill him one time, he
[2:14:52] woke up the next day.
[2:14:56] Girl, you so crazy.
[2:15:01] And mom and daddy said, "I told you to
[2:15:03] stay away from the wicked girl,
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; but he's so blinded by his heart."
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Second time she tried to come down, that
[2:15:11] would have been it for me.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Fool me one time, shame on you.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Fool me two times, shame on me.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; I think she tried to kill him by four
[2:15:26] times.
[2:15:28] tying the man hair up and all kind of
[2:15:31] abund
[2:15:36] the walls up on his shoulder.
[2:15:40] I'm in the message of the hour.
[2:15:44] Say, "Don't worry about it. I'mma get
[2:15:45] you. I'mma get you. Keep on." How did
[2:15:49] she get him? By playing with his heart.
[2:15:56] Samson. Samson,
[2:15:58] if you really love me,
[2:16:02] you really love me, you going don't do
[2:16:05] me like that.
[2:16:07] You really love me. Tell me your secret.
[2:16:13] I thought you love me.
[2:16:17] Well, if you don't love me, Ezekiel
[2:16:19] calling me anyway.
[2:16:25] Now, what they'll do?
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Go back to what? Putting you under
[2:16:29] pressure.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; I know we having a good time, but it's
[2:16:34] real talk.
[2:16:37] I present it like this because I want
[2:16:40] you young I want all of you to know who
[2:16:42] haven't given your heart yet, we love
[2:16:44] serving God.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; We get joy out of this. Coming to church
[2:16:49] is not misery to me. I love coming to
[2:16:52] church. I love coming to a meeting.
[2:16:55] Hallelujah. I love my pastor.
[2:16:57] Hallelujah.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; I love the worship.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; I love the ministry.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't get bored when I
[2:17:05] come to church. I love this part of it.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; Samson say, "Let me let me let me see if
[2:17:12] I really got that heart." Samson,
[2:17:17] I thought you love You don't love me.
[2:17:20] You love me, you tell you. Stop playing
[2:17:22] with me. You really tell me your secret.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; The Bible says Samson was vexed.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; He got tired of playing.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; He played with it so long till he let
[2:17:38] the vexation of his heart make him make
[2:17:40] a bad decision. Think about it, church.
[2:17:43] The girl was trying to kill him
[2:17:47] the whole time and he's so blinded by
[2:17:50] her looks.
[2:17:52] He didn't even realize it.
[2:17:55] Think about that.
[2:17:57] How many of y'all want a girlfriend
[2:17:59] trying to kill y'all?
[2:18:02] Anybody?
[2:18:05] Y'all ain't going to raise your hand.
[2:18:06] Come on. Be honest.
[2:18:10] Be honest. You want that wild thing.
[2:18:11] Come on. Be honest. You want that crazy
[2:18:15] love.
[2:18:18] Come on, be honest.
[2:18:22] You ain't going to raise your hand.
[2:18:25] But if you ain't got the Holy Ghost
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; and you got a girl in the world,
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; she's still taking your life.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you get caught out there before
[2:18:36] you repent, you know where you going?
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; To hell.
[2:18:41] So you just as bad as Samson
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; and vice versa sisters
[2:18:51] church.
[2:18:58] Matthew 6. Everybody all right.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going over time. I need to
[2:19:03] close.
[2:19:04] Man, I ain't got no go ahead and preach
[2:19:06] on that one.
[2:19:11] Don't worry. Don't Don't get nervous. We
[2:19:12] going to close it down.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But
[2:19:18] what we're doing is giving you time to
[2:19:20] think about it.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Think about where your heart is and the
[2:19:24] conditions of it. The Bible says,
[2:19:29] "For where the treasure is, there will
[2:19:32] your heart be also."
[2:19:36] So whatever
[2:19:38] you love, wherever your goal is, that's
[2:19:43] where your heart is.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; If your heart is in your career,
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; your heart is in your looks when you get
[2:19:53] in that mirror.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I still don't understand that
[2:20:03] one.
[2:20:05] I don't understand that. Why you want to
[2:20:07] look like a bee? I don't I don't
[2:20:10] understand that one.
[2:20:12] I know the prophet of God says any woman
[2:20:14] to look pretty, but
[2:20:16] you going too far with that one.
[2:20:22] You look like a bug for I
[2:20:27] come on musicians. I'm closing.
[2:20:37] One of the greatest challenges of the
[2:20:39] heart
[2:20:41] was David.
[2:20:44] David and Beth Sheba.
[2:20:47] David took another man's wife, got her
[2:20:50] pregnant, got the man killed,
[2:20:55] premeditated murder,
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; hid it all,
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; and then tried to cover it all up.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Then the prophet came and start telling
[2:21:03] him a story. David said, "Where? I'mma
[2:21:06] kill him. I'mma kill him." You know what
[2:21:08] he was saying? He need to kill himself.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; I'mma kill him. I'mma kill him. They
[2:21:14] didn't say, "David, that man is you."
[2:21:18] David fell to his knees.
[2:21:22] Why? Because God had his heart.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; And we got one of the greatest Psalms
[2:21:28] ever.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Psalms 51. Create in me.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, what? What did David say? Create in
[2:21:36] me a clean heart.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, sometimes we make wrong
[2:21:44] decisions based on our heart condition.
[2:21:46] That's what David was doing. Hallelujah.
[2:21:48] He made bad decisions, but his heart
[2:21:50] belonged to God. David said, "Creat in
[2:21:53] me a clean heart." What was it? Why did
[2:21:56] he make that decision? Because in those
[2:21:58] moments of his life, he didn't have any
[2:22:01] joy.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Restore unto me the joy of thy
[2:22:08] salvation.
[2:22:10] Take not thine Holy Spirit from me.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; It wasn't that God didn't have his
[2:22:18] heart. He was trying to serve God with
[2:22:20] no joy.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; You said, "Really, David?" Yeah, David
[2:22:29] was a man of war. Every time you turn
[2:22:30] around, he was fighting a battle.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; His own son tried to take the kingdom
[2:22:36] from him.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; That man went through stuff. God was
[2:22:39] doing what? Testing his heart.
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; So there was times where David,
[2:22:45] Hallelujah, he was a little down in his
[2:22:48] spirit. He made bad decisions. But then,
[2:22:51] hallelujah, when it was time to make it
[2:22:53] right, David say, "God, I have sin." He
[2:22:56] didn't try to cover it up.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; His heart belonged to God. I wonder how
[2:23:00] many of us are here tonight going to try
[2:23:02] to cover it up instead of getting your
[2:23:04] heart right.
[2:23:10] David repented.
[2:23:12] David said, "Create in me a clean heart,
[2:23:14] God.
[2:23:16] Restore unto me the joy of thy
[2:23:17] salvation."
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:21] And renew
[2:23:23] a right spirit in me.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; Where was his heart?
[2:23:30] It's given to God.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; Don't you realize that was the whole
[2:23:33] reason why God called him? Because God
[2:23:35] say, "I'm choosing a man after my very
[2:23:39] own heart."
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; With his mistakes, after my very own
[2:23:45] heart,
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; cuz God knew he will repent
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; and keep his heart clean.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:59] Create
[2:24:01] in me a clean heart.
[2:24:07] Oh God,
[2:24:12] and renew a right spirit within me.
[2:24:19] [Music]
[2:24:21] Create in me a clean heart.
[2:24:28] Oh God,
[2:24:32] and renew a right spirit within me.
[2:24:38] [Music]
[2:24:40] Oh,
[2:24:41] cast me
[2:24:43] away
[2:24:45] from thy presence,
[2:24:48] oh God.
[2:24:52] Take not thy holy spirit from me.
[2:24:58] Restore to me.
[2:25:01] Restore
[2:25:03] to me
[2:25:06] the joy of thy salvation.
[2:25:12] Every new world
[2:25:15] with me.
[2:25:17] Won't you let God deal with your heart
[2:25:18] as we sing it again?
[2:25:21] in me a clean heart.
[2:25:27] Oh God,
[2:25:31] and renew a right spirit within me,
[2:25:38] created me.
[2:25:42] [Music]
[2:25:44] Everybody in this room
