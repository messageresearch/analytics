========================================
is creating in the hearts of Believers is to once again know the liberty and the joy and the power that the early church have Hallelujah we want to know that joy we want to know that Liberty we want to have that boldness not walking anymore with a complex on us or you walking a place with boldness knowing that devil the subject to you that's right hallelujah thank you don't care whe it be the boss or whether it's this one or that one in your heart if you say Satan in the name of Jesus Christ I take control of this situation for the glory of God thank you Jesus not for myself not just for my situation but for the glory of God I take control over the situation I was speaking on Authority last week well praise God that's all right brother demonstrated it he stood let the BL for there you think that was only for him in the name of Jesus Christ I take every spirit in here on my control for the glory of God s loose the people in the Jesus and then you continue on with his preaching his his Healing Ministry and stuff like that that is also our right that's right praise the Lord thank you Jesus you got the right to change the atmosphere in any place that you go for the God you got that right change the atmosphere the says don't you know every one of you if you believe and have the faith you can create a world and will live on it he's not talking about just a physical world but you got the right to be able to create an atmosphere and walk right into that Atmosphere by his presence of power or by your trust and faith in the him do you believe that I believe that I believe the spirit of the Living God resting on me can go out from me and create an atmosphere right there without me touching with one finger and it's nothing to do with me it's to do with him but our faith must rest solidly on the word of God Bible days are here again I said Bible days are here again if we believe that b are here again not something that ever left never left always was here but it's our faith in the word of God it's our Holiness it's our walk with the Living God Amen hallelujah praise the name of the Lord The Joy the fruitfulness of the lives of the Apostles are active and moving in the life of God's people amen hallelujah amen let's check ourselves how does my life measure up and I do that how does my life measure up with Peter or Paul or Phillip or some one of them in the Bible but said well Paul that's kind of way up there so how could I ever think of such a well Phillip or or or or one of the other lesser if you want to put that way Apostles amen how does our lives measure up amen how do we measure up with Mary how do we measure up with Susanna how do we measure up with some of those sisters in the in the New Testament I'm talking about how do we measure up are we just here to live and at work make some money make a living you know buy a house raise our kids and just clap our hands in the church serve the Lord and when we die be assured of going to heaven or are we here to fulfill God's purposes are we here for the holy spirit that uses as vessels to flow through Us Praise the name of the Living God hallelujah amen it's different praise God hallelujah brother sister I tell you uh not only that those men know as brother BR said know the book but they knew the author of the book and the author of the book was in them so he could write in other books and we want that same one within our hearts and lives praise the Lord glory to God hallelujah amen yes sir we want to see the spirit of living God moving in us and until our lives uh manifest his life and be a witness for his glory amen you know so many times I'm wiping this up now we may be so interested in Revival and we may believe in Revival we may believe in the movement of God's holy spirit across our lives we may even come together like this and be praying for it but are we really ready have a real book of God that's right that will consume your life your time your interest praise the Lord until you can't rest at night sometimes we call we ask for God to move but are we ready for any of that well you talk to God and tell him if you're ready for something like that amen are we saying Lord we want Revival but not like that uh we wanted our own way amen praise the the Lord praise God how would you feel the Holy Spirit would to break out manifest himself within the congregation so much until you're praying in the church and you hardly feel like leaving to go home and they have to be calling the police to find out where you are meanwhile you caught up in the spirit in the house of God in prayer and when they come to the front there and they hear noise and praying going on and so they want to know what's going on when they come in and see people staggering around think there a bunch of drunks they have to arrest amen and even the women drunk to you know normally they come and arrest the men but all the the women and the men all Trump cry but it was not trumpet wine the Holy Spirit the Living God hallelujah amen praise God glory to God I believe now as in closing that God is meeting with Christians today and filling us with the spirit of those Apostolic times now praise the Lord uh so what does the future hold for us Brothers we know that the future holds the Rapture that's for certain the future holds the Rapture and holds the ending of the ages amen all the ending of the ages right through the Millennium we know the rest of it we're not going to be in that but God has given us uh uh knowledge of the future things right that we might know praise the Lord hallelujah so uh let us prepare Hearts but like we said I think of touched on this before if you prepare for move move of God prepare for persecution also that's right if you prepare for the power of God prepare to get some persecution also because the two always go together the apostles preach in the streets the power of God come down and the Pharisees are always there to try to arrest them or stop them the devil is going to work through his Messengers while God is working through his Messengers so let's be prayerful Let's Be watchful and let's unite your hearts in prayer whether you're in the house of God or you're in your home seeking him praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen they believed in the Holy Spirit but most of the people today are afraid of the real Holy Spirit that's the truth and I can understand to a certain degree because I've been in a room praying praying all day and towards the evening time and I have witness that was there and while we were praying there all of a sudden the room started to fill up with a supernatural presence with our eyes closed we both open our eyes because we felt the same thing something was about to happen in that room and the next thing that we know the door that we have locked so that we W be disturbed at prayer that door opened started moving like this but by that time God helped you or I don't know if my hair was standing straight like wire on my head I had L here those were the after you know you don't know if your hair was standing like wire in your head brother Danny people said oh I got the Goosebumps that was way Beyond Goosebumps neither one of us could even talk to one another we were just transfixed and just BRAC and holding on like this with with your eyes all staring like that because we know something is going to happen but you know what it's just like if that person or presence knew they're not able to take this now and you feel it start to ease off until it came right back to normal and then we start looking at one mother and later on we were out of there area praise the name of the Lord I don't know if we went back there to pray again so what I'm saying is one thing when we start to ask for a move of God we even in your house and I'm telling you you get in your house in your bedroom even lock the door and you start to pray as I have felt somebody come sit on the man like they're just sitting there to listen to what I'm praying praise the Lord hallelujah what would you do then but I'm just telling you these things so that even if something similar like that happen I can't say don't be afraid it's human brother Brown said that your flesh coming in contact with the Supernatural is what does that that's why he got used to get weak but he will get that way above us he would just get so weak he just couldn't handle Daniel col 21 days he was sick praise God so brothers let's prepare for the wave of the holy spirit amen amen and um let's ask ourselves is my life making an impact is it touching the Liv of others for the glory of God am I a channel that God God is able to work true in this last day let me surrender my all and offer myself to him that he will take me and use me for his glory the musici Come As we sing every one or two verses from an old hymn that brother Brandon himself loved praise the Lord amen it's when the PO of fire touch the prophet
