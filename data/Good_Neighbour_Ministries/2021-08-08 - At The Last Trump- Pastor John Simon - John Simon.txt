momentarily [Music] we welcome uh all of you and especially those of you it's your first time back amen the family of god is gathering back into the house of god one by one little by little they're coming into the house of god all of us have gone through our trials and this business of the this plague has plagued us and uh but we are here through it all as the triumphant ones as the overcomers who have overcome everything uh to present ourselves in the house of god make no mistake about it satan has cast every block and every thing he could in front of you and you did not think that you were fighting a spiritual warfare but you were engaged in spiritual warfare not even realizing it but you are fighting a spiritual war and you are here today as the evidence that you have overcome and i want to thank god for every one of you that are here today [Applause] and when all of life's battles are over as the songwriter says we shall wear a bright and shining crown until that time let us work let us wait and let us watch and let god have all the glory and praise and honor amen glory to god i i just want you to know friends uh i thank god this past week i want to also thank those who gave me cards and well wishes and stuff like that for my uh 7-6 birthday which just went by and i thank god for that but i want to say that you should understand that during these years of service to the lord i have tried to serve the lord with no bailamite tricks no cunningness no smartness no kind of subterfuges machinations on the handed dealings nothing of the kind i can say i have not begged any of you privately or openly for money i have not asked any of you for favors i just served the lord faithfully now i am not poor and i am not as naturally speaking rich but i eat i wear i live and i'm taken care of because of the grace of god through the church i have not accumulated wealth of any kind amen and i'm saying that publicly you might know it or i am just here as a servant of god with no other motives no other hidden objectives no aims nothing of the kind with one unchanging purpose to serve god throughout my entire life [Applause] if i leave a legacy i want every one of you sisters and brothers to have that same kind of dedication and purpose to the villain plan of god this is not just talk because a lot of preachers will say the same things but this is not talk this is a life invested completely into the kingdom [Applause] and by that i am not saying that i represent uh uh roman catholic um ideas of sainthood of of of earthly physical uh perfections uh because the devil will make you look at me and see and hear all kinds of things that god would allow deliberately to throw you this way that way that way you know and you just can't figure it out just let the lord jesus christ have his way we all built differently for a purpose and for the glory of god amen so let's get i want to give him all the praise the honor and glory that he's brought me this far and i have much more of the race to run amen oh greetings to you from sister marl gilchrist uh sister julie's mom who wrote me this past week thanking god for the times that she has come and been with us fellowshipping with the word of god and i was surprised that she's i never realized it every year or so she was here over 19 or 20 times flying all the way from new zealand to be here among us herself and her precious sister together they sang from off of this pulpit glorious wonderful dedicated voices and now she's her sister has gone on our sister has gone on that sister vanessa's mom has gone on to be with the lord and now this sister moral is kind of lonely now because from school coming up right through all to the church and everything else the two of them always hung out together and now that she's like 88 or 89 i mean that's a lot of years for two people to have a friendship natural and then to have a spiritual fellowship together in jesus christ so those are real real soldiers of the gospel and we want to thank god for them and give god the glory for her [Applause] she said to ask me to bring my greetings to the saints because she will not uh be able to physically come back because of the frailty of age right and um if we never meet again here on earth then she trusts that we will meet together up in glory praise god and thank god but we have with us our precious sister julie here praise the lord and uh we want you all of you pray for one another love one another call one another we live in a time now when we can't literally maybe go visit and stop in and stuff like that because it's changed but we can at least get on the telephone and call one another and keep in touch so that we don't feel that we are locked away alone in our homes amen and that goes not just for sister julie for all of us every one of us praise the lord we have older ones that are usually housebound and stuff like that except for the ones that might be able to run out to the grocery or not but let us open our hearts and reach out one to the other amen god bless you well how many of you uh watch the olympics i don't know about you but i i watch the olympics it's very very exciting uh for me to watch the olympics and see our various runners and jumpers and swimmers and uh you know volleyball or whatever else they part anticipated on i think a young man from london won some kind of a trophy and so on it's marvelous and wonderful to watch them but you know i was really struck when the races were on and the runners were going i forgot there's one young man from saint catharines here um ahmed muhammad i think he ran the five or ten thousand meters and became the gold medal medalist anyway praise god um the thing about that is they would run and run and every day you know they're running and they're running looks normal and ordinary and everything else like that but then it gets to a certain point when it's the last lap oh my when it gets to that last lap then all of a sudden you hear the bell goes off it starts ringing and the moment you see that bell hits the last lap everybody picks up the pace amen they pick up the pace it's not ordinary more why because they're headed for the home stretch glory god they headed for the tape now they headed for the victor's crown they headed for the for the gold medal amen and to stand on that podium that the world might see her uh see them publicly displayed before them to recognize what what what they actually accomplished hallelujah and you know that struck me and took me to as you will now stand as we read from first corinthians chapter 15. verses 51 and 52 and our topic of course will arise from out of this let us first pray and read the word gracious father we thank you for this glorious opportunity we pray that once again you'll break the bread of life and lord open it up to us that we might live and walk therein we ask your blessing in jesus name amen behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye my subject at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed may the spirit of god bless us together god bless you please be seated now in the early days of modern warfare early days modern warfare the soldiers did not even have a watch like every kid today has a watch they did not have a watch so they couldn't tell the time of the day they didn't know what was happening and so they had to find a way to be able to regulate uh the soldiers actions uh and positions during the day and so the typical soldier's day began with a bugle call it was a bugle call early in the morning and the significance of that was to awaken wake up get up rise up hallelujah and assemble they were supposed to assemble after they got woke up by the trumpet they had to get up and put on their battle dress and then they had to get out to the parade ground and assemble for formation praise god that was called revelly and there the sound of that trumpet would wake up those soldiers and they'll get up in haste put on their uh their clothing and their armament and they will get out there of course we know that that was a type of the apostle paul's ministry amen when god used him to sound the first trumpet to be the first messenger with the word of god for this day because remember the word of god and the voice of god is a trumpet call and paul was used as that first trumpet which he himself said in ephesians 5 14 the scripture says arise down that sleepest and come to the light amen it's morning wake up get up move out and let's get about the masters business hallelujah amen so this first trumpet call was to arise to awaken and to assemble together and get into body or formation that you might find your position in the formation that was taking place at that particular time when the lieutenant surgeons and whatever would then gather the man and then will apportion them to each part that they had to fulfill before they would go out to carry out their various assignments now at the end of the day and in particular when it came to night before leaving going to their rest the soldiers rest uh and doing that there was a bugle call that went out to make them aware prepare yourself because now stop whatever you're doing whatever you're engaged with stop it now and prepare yourself because it's rest time coming now it's time for you to go into your barracks turned to you to find your place and time for you to rest enter into the rest amen hallelujah and so that bugle call would go out and that was known as the last post i don't know if there are any soldiers in here or former soldiers but you would know that they call that the last post or the last trumpet the last trump for the day was that last post the call see because the taps the signal that it was time for inspection time for inspection when that bugle call went out they know they had to present themselves to start getting inspected and the officer will then walk down the line inspecting every single one it was also a time for the last roll call the last roll crawl was now taking place and they had to be in line because if their name was called and they're not there then that's it you know you're out and after that is punishment right oh my so you've got to answer that last roll call when that bugle sounded you must answer to the last roll call when it was sounded amen then each soldier had to run in the line or stand there quickly to account for himself by calling out his name amen and saying present or here or or whatever his name was he had to call it out so they could recognize that he was present and that he was there and accounted for and you see this served the purpose of letting all the soldiers whether they are 10 or they are 10 000 when they heard that bugle call they knew that all is well all is well now you can relax and you can go and rest because the entire camp has now been inspected and the entire camp is also secure and with the security around that camp the soldiers can now begin to go and sleep and rest because the camp was secure there was there were many other trumpet signals during the day which we will not talk about you can go and read or find out about those other calls you know there's other calls uh retreat advance so on uh mealtimes this that there's other calls that the trumpets will sound but we are not we're not going to discuss that we just talk about the first trumpet and now there is the last trumpets given in the day but these two were the most important sounding of those bugle calls to the heart of a soldier the last the first first and the last i think jesus said he was the first and he was the last he was the revelate and he is our last post amen praise god he is the first trump and he is the last trump he is our everything and we put our trust in him praise god hallelujah amen one pause is everything all right here okay now nobody really knows unless you were a soldier a former soldier nobody knows the power and the purpose uh on the promise of that last trump when it sounds to the heirs of a soldier even if he is a former soldier we have a navy man right there i just remember uh yeah yeah here we have a military person sitting right here in the front as if he knew i was going to preach a message like this today where we thank god for him amen but truly there might be others in here i don't know but the fact is long after they have left the army inside of them they have the memory of the sounding of that last trumpet when it strikes their soul they recognize something amen praise god because they're built that way whether they're in the services or they're out of the services the memories still call to a soldier's heart saying and these are the real true words of the last post sounded by the trumpet but that trumpet sound is really these words day is done and gone the sun from the lakes from the hills and from the sky all is well all is well safely rest for god is nigh that is the last post and that is the voice of that last trumpet and if that last post that last trumpet for a natural soldier can create such a pulsation within their hearts my friends what about us when we read in our bible these scriptures that we just read behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed amen oh my what will that do to the hearts of christian soldiers soldiers of the lord jesus christ that knows him in the power of his resurrection that's been trained for his purpose raised up for spiritual warfare raised up to be used by the hand of god amen because every true soldier of jesus christ every true believer is a real soldier of the living god hallelujah because they are supernatural soldiers amen because they got to fight against supernatural devils so they have to be supernatural soldiers spiritual soldiers the fight against satan amen and all of his unseen hosts for the bible tells us we are here not to fight against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places so we are fighting an unseen war hallelujah amen and here we are brothers gleaning from the field of this message this truth these revelations ruth is again she's gleaning but from the field that this prophets of god has grown and brought to a maturity in this season and time and the harvesters have been in the field the prophet has left the scene hallelujah and they have been in the field and now the last part of the field is left and we are gleaning now in the harvest field our last trump has found him how many knows that our last trumpet has sounded and the bible tells us at the last trump we shall be changed lord of god that change must be taking place right now that change must be going on now because the last trump has sounded and its music its sound is still in the air it's still in the atmosphere right now i don't know if you can hear it but i can hear it in my soul i can hear the reverberations of it in my soul amen and that trumpet is going to keep sounding it will keep on sounding what's it waiting for the last soldier to come in is waiting for the last one to come in and get into their position hallelujah make the formation praise god that they might know it's time that we can all go home and rest now because our work is done the glory of god has been completed the camp is secure amen oh blessed be the name hallelujah there's power in the last trump there's power in it brother thank god we haven't been given a tradition bob even yes this last trump came with power should i preach what paul preached a priest what the first trumpet preached i preached the word of god hallelujah and if they made it in we are going to make it in [Applause] hallelujah millions in the heavens screamed we are resting on that lord of god hallelujah we're resting on that amen praise god hallelujah listen the prophet of god here in the breach between the church ages and the seals now think of it first second third fourth fifth sixth seventh amen then fall asleep what will happen that last trumpet has to blast forth and what it does the same time is when the last angel is giving his message and the last seal opens at that time when does the last trump sound when the last seal is open when the last angel is sending his message amen and the last trumpet will sound hallelujah and then the redeemer himself comes forth and starts to take his redeemed possessions lord of god i believe he's here right now i said i believe he's here amen i believe the redeemer is here to claim his purse purchase possessions that he has redeemed with his own blood lord of god amen that's what's going on now we're not conditioned where he's calling out his elect he's bringing his elect to attention of his own word oh my coming for those blood wash wands the whole creation now lays in his hands amen the whole plan of redemption was sealed up with seven seals but now those mysterious seals of revelation it's now open amen and he alone can reveal it to whom so ever he wants to reveal it to a lot of people think because they have the prophet's message that's the revelation that's just the outside of the outside of the revelation amen oh my that's the outside of it amen but thank god now it's come down to its salvation is an individual affair now it comes down to him revealing to the individual the revelation of the inside of this message by the holy spirit amen and no one else can receive it but those who have been elected by him amen yes sir and let me tell you it's sealed by seven seals of mystery because it is the book of redemption why in that book is the names of all the elect hallelujah oh my do you know if god didn't reveal who you are to you before the time you might even destroy your own self or the devil would destroy you completely because he knew that you are one of them amen that last trumpet blowing amen oh and when it blows we'll all be caught up to meet him in the air there's a lot of misconceptions and misunderstanding of people when they read the bible and the word of god what god is really saying they start taking all these pentecostal uh ideas and imaginations that all at once you're gonna start rising and going up in the air wearing a nice white gown or something of the other but the bible is telling us something different to that that's right here in the word of god amen think of it you are going to meet the lord in the air you are going to be missing people you're going to be missing why they can't see you anymore amen praise god think about it brother when that last trumpet sounds what he's saying there you're going to be changed in such a way that you're gonna enter into a next dimension and they can't see in that dimension it's not that you're gone you're still you're going back in other words to be the spirit man that you originally were you go back to be that spirit person you were originally were and they can't see you anymore in that position because you got to go through the 40 days like them saints back in the new testament you're going to be around amen changed in a moment but you are going to be here and my friends they will not be able to see you because you are now in another dimension by the power of god hallelujah you're changed completely by the presence of god change back from a living visible person and change back to that invisible gene spirit person that you were when you were in god change in a moment in the twinkling of an eye hallelujah praise god listen what he says but don't you realize that dead shall be raised first hallelujah they're going to be raised and this is where he starts talking about you or some of you gonna just start seeing the uh believers you are going to he says here you will then be able to see some of them and say oh there's a brother i know it ain't so long ago amen but i know him that is like us in this church saying oh my god there's brother peter praise the lord hallelujah oh my goodness there is brother can be pat i see him over there oh my praise god oh sister joyce how are you joyce brennan brother mike's mom lord of god hallelujah amen brother henry daniel that old soldier of amen we see him praise god glory god and brother gordon amen hallelujah what the prophet is saying you're going to be changed amen they're going to be raised up they're going to start being seen hallelujah because now you quit enough you you quitting enough and you are in another dimension and you are going to see them you are going to be able to register with them and recognize who they are because you yourself amen will be considered missing on the earth hallelujah but really he said you know you are really in another dimension changed by the power of god you know brother branham said you know there are things in the other dimension passing in front of me right now you can't see them but i can because i was born this way and equipped this way that i don't need the television television is just a human means of breaking into that realm to be able to see what's in that rail he says but and i don't have to go to sleep to dream it i'm standing here and it's passing right in front of me and i can see it he said there are things passing through this room right now and what he's saying is that when the word brings you to a certain place and position we shall be changed transformed or placed into another dimension where you can't be visible and seen by the peoples of the earth they will consider you missing by you not missing because my friends you just transformed into another dimension back to your your invisibility and unseen realm that you actually come from this world is not your home you're just a passing through amen oh praise god we're passing out to here because we heard the last trump amen we answering the call from that last trump right to our soul amen the last the trump of god that last trumpet the sixth one has just sounded and the last trumpet with the last seal you know it all will be the coming of the lord amen coming at the lord for what to claim his purchase possessions amen to find that last one and take them out of here and carry them away with him now in the book of revelation you know that the prophet saw this he says and danielle ties right into revelation isaiah saw it he ties himself right into revelation the old testament all of it ties in with it and what is it it's the book of the revelation of jesus christ it's all to reveal jesus christ hallelujah seven churches seven plagues seven seals seven trumpets amen and you know that a trumpet represents a seal and a seal represents a mystery amen and and then you know how it all happens that unfolds and shortly after that a plague strikes the earth amen i believe we're going through one right now i believe a seal was opened and i believe some of us recognize what the seal represents amen he said that seal opens we'll come to that anyway amen see we're now living at the time of that last trumpet that seventh trumpet that seventh plague that seventh seal amen the seventh while to be poured out when the sixth trumpet sounded which of course you know if you don't know market remember it was the first world war amen that sixth trumpet was the first world war you see god spoke of it geographically and when the mystery revealed itself in there for that was the baptism of the holy ghost and how the church should move up amen but those who were moving refused to walk in the light they refused to take this message they got a revival at pentecost 1906. that sixth trumpet opened and the holy spirit baptism fell and they're supposed to move up away from that and into this message and they refuse to move away from it and went back and then a plague was opened a plague poured out upon the arch at that time that was the virus the in up called influenza right this is brother branham speaking back then it was the virus called influenza my and that killed all the people as it did thousand times ten thousands were killed and now we're coming into this last age here where we are at now amen now listen what the lord has to say about it in his word this brother branham saying this this is not me now making this up i am just seeing it and reading it like reading a newspaper right out of the word of god i say this is dire his direct revelation coming now to his church what is it the revelation of jesus christ himself to the church of the living god i believe that's what i've tried to bring to you here by the grace of god my friends not all the other things surrounding it they're wonderful they're even true but the core the very core ingredient is the lord himself amen is jesus christ revealed in his own word that's what you're gonna see when this revelation really strikes your heart amen you'll find that in the seven church ages amen oh my no man has sought god at any time but it takes it took the holy spirit he said again in this day to come and to start brooding again i don't need to explain i preached to you about the brooding over the natural creation and all like that and that brooding is god calling saying come forth come forth come forth it's like a hen or an eagle sitting on eggs and telling them come on get born come out of those shells comfort amen the irs come on the power of god the last trumpet has sounded and god brooding he said brooding over the earth amen yes sir he's doing that amen we know how it is he made us thus any human conception of what we would be or what we would be like we are here today in this manner amen but much more after we're gone our bodies may blow to the four winds of the earth hallelujah but the holy spirit who has now embraced us lord of god he's claimed you to be his own because you believe this lord you receive his revelation and now the one that was brooding over the earth now embraces his own praise the lord god hallelujah amen and though your bodies blow with the winds to the far winds of the earth you see the word brooding he pauses here it means he is now making love to his church amen and when the holy spirit came down the first to the natural he made love to the calcium and the potash and the petroleums of the earth so that he can form it hallelujah you understand creation the spirit man and then he had to make the second man the by formation so he's telling us how god formed it he's telling us how that creation took place and forming it amen together so he could make a human being out of it hallelujah and then the spirit man hallelujah could go into that human that body that god had formed by his grace amen and then it in return as a human that human being in return turns back around and begins to recognize him we begin to recognize him and what he has done for you and his love towards you and we make love back to him praise god to him who the word we make blood back to him go back to him the word amen because he has promised us that he must rise us up in the last days what kind of a fate should that give us i believe he says when you get that kind of a faith all fear is taken away from you hallelujah i don't know about you but i got no more fears i got no more fears i'm not worried about missing rapture or going to hell and all this kind of thing backsliding and all that stuff all my fears are taken away amen all fear is gone doubt is gone all those things are gone from me amen i'm filled with the spirit there isn't a doubt lord of god god's spirit lives within my heart and the soul and heart of every believer amen praise god hallelujah all your fears are taken away amen they could even bury you in the sea but that trumpet will wake you up amen hallelujah no matter how far you've gone or what takes place you are going to come forth from the dust amen hallelujah we're not talking only he's not talking only about that dust down there if they'll get buried he's talking about right now all the dust you're here among millions and millions of every human being and no matter how far you might have wander away from the way your father's way like a prodigal daughter or son when that trumpet sounds it calls you back to yourself and wakes you up to who you already are and you recognize him that he is the same yesterday today and forever oh my the trumpet is sounding oh praise god that comes from the hebrews chapter 1 amen 1957 but it says here in uh why the message why someday this trumpet that sounded hallelujah will sound for the last time amen then the bible will all be closed and lay on the altar all them mimics amen you know all them who trying to mimic this amen you can put on all the message clothes you can dress right which is good we should do that but there are a lot of mimics amen god doesn't have a cookie cut to christianity amen hallelujah oh this brother this that sister that this other one that now we are not here amen for that purpose because god is a master potter god is the great greatest of all artists he never made one thing twice every single thing is unique that's why paul is false and his foolishness for anyone of you to compare yourself with another person even though they look like twins they are not in the eyes of god they are individuals and they're made different hallelujah to think god saw great brother branham said every single blade of grass different every single snowflake different even the scientists know that that the snowflakes everyone different oh my think of a being that knows that from every single part of the entire creation from biology to zoology to exist to that anthropology whatever everyone different because he is the great master of it all hallelujah oh my think of it the sun will be setting in the west all the armaments will be stacked and then as the song i love to sing what then what then oh praise god think of it john was in the spirit when in the last day praise god i hope john gets in the spirit again in this last day john types the bride amen us she gets in the spirit praise god hallelujah oh think of it and when he was there in the spirit he was transferred by the holy spirit into the lord's day amen oh my over into the lord's day and soon as he got over there once he got there he could hear a trumpet what is that why did that trumpet sound see that trumpet sounded because some great one is approaching some great person he said is coming on the scene somebody is coming and he heard the voice but the trumpet had a voice hallelujah saying i am alpha and omega first and the last hallelujah i am not first second party third party fourth party i am alpha and omega amen before i tell you anything else brother i'm speaking here show you anything i want to let you know first of all you must know who i am you see that principle right there you'll understand it clearer when he himself says it here think of it the greatest of all revelations we will ever have is the revelation of the deity the supreme deity of our lord jesus christ some of us sitting in here thinks that's the simplest you see that's how god always works he makes you think the thing you think is foolishness the stupidness is the simplest thing oh anybody can get that that he says that is the greatest revelation you will ever have in your entire life the supreme deity of jesus christ our lord hallelujah because you can't even get to first base if you can't receive that you can't even get the in other words the rest of the veil is not going to open up to you nothing else is going to open up to you nothing else is going to be revealed to you if you can't even get past the supreme deity of jesus christ i've heard preachers say brother simon why why you um you sound so simple when you preach and well some of you may say it's deep but a lot of people think it's simple because they just get the outward part of it and they think oh you're just talking about the deity of jesus christ oh you just talk about brother branham you just mentioned about the prophet why you have to talk about that so often they don't understand they have not caught that original ingredient of the revelation that it all starts from there and if you don't go in there and get that you will not be able to break out into all that god has in store for you amen the first thing you have to know is the deity of jesus christ amen i am a to z there's no more and nothing else but me see i was at the beginning i will be there at the end i am he that this is brother branham speaking amen you might have been hearing his voice but you ought to know by now who is speaking through him and saying i am alpha i am omega i there's no nothing else but me i was at the beginning i will be at the end i am he that was which is and shall come i am the almighty think of it that is what the trumpet said amen oh be careful john be careful bride be careful you're entering into the spirit now and there's something going to be revealed to you when you're in that spirit a trumpet shall sound amen amen all the great revelations made known oh i am alpha but i am also omega amen that's the first thing and the last thing who is this approaching it's king jesus now approaching king jesus king king god amen king holy ghost king of righteousness king of peace oh hallelujah the king is approaching i am all of it i am from a to z i am the immortal one i am the eternal one i am the almighty hallelujah he is the one that is approaching and has approached us by the opening of this word and the opening of your understanding and the breaking of the seals that were upon your heart that you could recognize him he him who is the word that is from the patmos vision brother branham jesus oh saying it praise god don't you love that song maybe we can sing it oh it is jesus hallelujah shall we all sing together oh it is jesus oh it is jesus oh it is jesus in my soul for i have touched i have touched the hymn of his god and his blood and his blood has made me whole oh it is jesus oh it is jesus oh it is jesus in my soul and my soul for i have touched the him of his god thank god and his blood his precious blood oh when that last trumpet sounds when your last battle is fought when the last sermon is being preached when the last song has been sung then we'll stand at the judgment seat of christ and we are going to be asked why did you not receive it then this message why did you not receive it then what will you answer what did you do with the life i gave you to live amen see oh you'll be asked to give a reason why and that's why you've heard me sing that song over and over again when the great book is open what then when the ones that's rejected this message today will be asked to give a reason what then what then oh my revelation chapter 4 praise god amen see that trumpet had a voice that spoke to john that first trumpet had a voice what about this last one it has to have a voice speaking again to the believer for this age and for this hour oh glory to god listen what he says exodus chapter 19 write it down if you wish 16th verse he says it came to pass amen there were thunders and lightning and clouds upon the mountain and the voice of the trumpet the voice of the trumpet sounded exceedingly loud amen what is the voice of the trumpet it's the voice of the archangel amen the archangel sounding out praise god listen i believe that was the same voice that lazarus heard when that voice says lazarus come forth amen lord of god that was the call come for assembly time come to this time and the voice called out to him i believe it's the same voice that little maiden heard when she heard him say to her daughter i say unto thee arise amen you're only you're not dead you're only sleeping because real christians they got eternal life they can't die amen just this outward man oh here might go into dust but this inward man it can't die glory to god hallelujah amen think of it now ezekiel chapter 9 i'm taking the time to bring this message to you and i trust god will strike your soul with the strains of the sound of this last trumpet and realize what we are what we really have received and are receiving for the trumpet is still sounding amen praise god hallelujah ezekiel the ninth chapter along with revelations 14 6-12 brother branham says write it all down see them seven angels came forth but there were three special angels the first angel sounded with the first trumpet of the everlasting gospel to preach into the all the world amen see and we know the second one he had to preach out against them who committed fornication and the third angel roared out to tell the world to escape for them from the mark of the beast see oh what was it first it was luther preaching the everlasting gospel that justin left by faith amen wesley sanctification see he was straightening up all the uncleanness fornication out of the church and the third message was the pentecostal message amen because the true messenger is warning them to escape from the mark of the beast now we recognize that was brother branham's ministry how many knows that that was the brother branham to the leodision church age and to the seven church ages amen he is not the messenger to the eternal church age amen which follows that he himself said it oh for at the end of the seals amen you can't get in that church age unless you are eternal like the churches is eternal you have to be the original one and we're gonna get here where brother branham is gonna tell you why this thing is so ironclad the devil can't get around it he can't get in it he can't get over it god set it up in such a way that he is absolutely out of it and only the believing elected seed are allowed to go in there by the grace of god hallelujah amen think of it praise god hallelujah this the very very message today the third angel's message the message today that's when he was preaching them telling them it's his message amen that third message the last message see is the escape the mark of the beast is the pentecostal message about the seal of god see all my and to come out of them walls of mystery babylon organization and into the kingdom of god hallelujah oh my now listen to me that angel this angel the true angel the next angel comes down from heaven amen now he's gone from the seven he says now these three out of those seven this is what their ministry was but he said now this one that's coming this one that the last trump sounded his approach this one that's approaching you this mighty angel come down from heaven for them other seven angels all of them were only earthly messengers are you listening to me but this angel remember now all the messages finished now amen at this time he says all the message is given forth it's finished amen oh praise god that's as much as saying the seven church ages are now over right this last messenger has finished his ministry the seventh listen he says it here the seventh angel winds up the entire thing at that time and then this angel comes down to the earth glory to god and when he comes you must recognize he is not a man hallelujah he is not a man of the earth he is not william branham he is not the seventh church age messenger amen hallelujah praise god he is not a man from the earth like the other messengers to the other church ages to the earth no that is all finished amen it's all finished but this angel he brings the next announcement and the word angel means that he is a messenger also hallelujah now you see now we're going now to the eternal church age and the messenger also got to be eternal the people and the populace of that church age got to be eternal to be in that eternal church age and if they're going to have a messenger to the eternal churches he got to be an eternal messenger to that eternal church so this messenger is not a man of earth this brother branham is telling you after he is gone after the ages are over the seven churches that we know of this whole thing is not done yet because a mighty angel comes down after he is gone amen right an angel means a messenger and this one comes down from heaven and he is clawed in the pillar of fire pillar of light surrounded with a cloud and with a rainbow over his head what is it the covenant who is it it is christ himself jesus christ himself back to earth again right after this prophet's message message is over he comes back to earth again what's the opening of the seventh seal the coming of the lord the mysterious coming of the lord when he was on mount sunset he said and when i look i see angels coming with the speed of light he said and there there were he said but the funny thing the one in the front with the swept back wings like a bomber oh my goodness oh god he says that was not a man from earth that was the lord from heaven amen and he now stands with one foot on the land and one on the sea and he swears time shall be no more oh my what time we understand that now that time doesn't mean that time ceases but the time for the church ages are over he announces the end of the seven church ages and the beginning of the eternal church age of whom he is the messenger is that right praise god where are we at sirs i'm asking you amen these are the messengers remember amen don't forget them other angels were only messengers of earth but this angel see even the church of leodisia the one to the church of leodisia he said to the angel of the church of ephesus these were all messengers of the earth see they are men they are messengers they may be prophets and so forth they were sent to the church but this one doesn't come from the earth amen see he doesn't come from the earth he come down from heaven because the mystery is all finished amen and he says time shall be no more and when he opens his mouth when he says time shall be no more and he speaks out the seven thunders throughout their voices what the seven thunders in other words is the perfect complete total revelation of the voice of god amen you had it in pieces pieces pieces some come out in this messenger that messenger that messenger or but his voice now is the accumulation of all truth of all ages coming out of him and expressing itself in the last day to the true believer that will receive the word of god hallelujah praise god amen so them seven thunders throw out their voices what what is it why is that happening is it something to let us know how we are to enter into that rapture in faith is it will it cause us to run over walls amen oh my oh come on it doesn't mean you're gonna run and jump over a high wall like that but all the walls that the devil put in front of you all the tombs that he tried to close up with a stone and block you in that you can't see the word he says now when this angel comes and the word is now revealed to you straight from his mouth the seventh thunder sputtered you will be able to leap over every obstacle every obstacle oh my praise god you're not going to win your tackle on or the catalog or whatever you're going to win the whole thing praise god because you're going to get the gold medal hallelujah i'm going to give you a golden crown praise god amen hallelujah oh praise god and when that is fixing to happen will these all mild vile bodies going to be changed can i lift to see it oh lord it's so close that i'll see it is this the generation oh praise god brother uh brother sister i believe we are now right now in the rapture generations we are in the rapture generation pepsi generation x generation all kind of generation all gone past but we are now in the rapture generation being changed by the power and the presence of god hallelujah praise god amen i don't intend to leave any more of this over to next week so just leave me alone and let me preach the word of god is that all right hallelujah amen oh listen what he says now a trumpet you know always denotes a war beginning oh my or else it may speak of a political disturbance the trumpet sounds and it causes a war amen oh my now if someone was to get to messing around with politics then they are going to mess everything up all around them like we got it now everything messed up in politics around us and when you see that happening watch out there is a war at hand natural and spiritual there is a war at hand because you see this kingdom this earthly kingdom still belongs to satan how many knows he's the god of this evil age right oh my he still got a part of it in his hand because we were redeemed by christ out of it but he has the rest of it under his control for he is the god of this earth amen see my he is now he is the lord is the kinsman redeemer and he is taking his subjects and the last one the last name that was put on the book hallelujah that name is being called out by the last trumpet amen so that's why you got to have the last trumpet got the sound blast and then the sound goes on and goes on and on until it dies out right it's going on right now until it dies out but before it dies it was even kept a secret from the angels oh think of this i want you to listen close why why was that if satan could have gotten a hold of that he might be able to do great damage to the kingdom amen but that is one thing he don't know he can't interpret it thank god for that aren't you happy for that what you have received by revelation he can't interpret it and i'm going to now say some other things where he said other places where he says you he misinterpret this dislocate this he can't do it at all he can't misplace the word and shift it around like he did with eve to deceive the true believer he cannot do it whatsoever praise god oh my think of it he don't know it he can't interpret interpret it and not only that this one he cannot impersonate it amen he can't impersonate it look all the christian trappings all the dress all the doing everything perfectly the devil can do all of that that's right amen he could show patience he could show love he can show all them fruits of the spirit and he might be able to show them better than you he said that he said those christian science and a lot of those groups he said they can display some of those virtues better than you amen so you got to realize that it's not going to take you to produce no virtues and produce no fruits it's not it's going to take you to be doing that but the lord himself has to be in you and he himself is going to begin to live his life through you and that will produce perfection of perfection hallelujah you are perfect in christ [Applause] [Music] you're not perfect in your flesh but you're perfect in christ christ in you is your hope for glory [Applause] any kind of a gift you know we had like that we had one person pass through here with a kind of gift that could say oh uh similar where you can say oh when when we walk the road up that side on such and such there's a street up there and he's never been in the area name so and so there's going to be a clock there and the time is going to be and the brothers would go and there would be the thing and he had those kinds of gifts but then he come to preach and while he's preaching suddenly the holy spirit said he's a homosexual he didn't tell the truth he's exposed amen i know what i'm saying when i'm saying it and it's going on on the table because it's the truth amen and of course i called him to it and it was proven so uh and uh of course two weeks later the rcmpr is there to see me they got him and took him into jail and he denied and that's the reason why i told him nope you stop preaching and you don't you don't come back and uh they sent him to jail and then i was called years later and said hey you know that guy that we caught and this and that he's done the same thing again and we put him back in jail again and this time he's gone for good so i want you to know the devil could impersonate these gifts a lot of this stuff a lot of people think oh brother branham had all these gifts and he was used of god and he did that the only thing about the prophet they can't impersonate is the revealing and opening of this world maybe you won't see one yet that can in person can impersonate the things that you see in the prophet's life but those gifts and those things there's people out there there's there's men in africa right now with such kinds of gifts that 25 000 people going to their churches and they they're going around with people carrying them on trolls raising the dead and all kinds of stuff and the prime minister and this and that the presidents and governments are going in there because they are literally actually seeing the miracles they're seeing it so if those things are going to deceive you that that's what it's all about you're going to be carried away but this is not about that god we're gonna have that yes we're gonna have those things but our prime purpose and our eyes are looking away to jesus and jesus alone hallelujah amen think of it if satan couldn't get a hold of that praise god amen now i hope you are learning something here the devil don't know this this it's not even written in the world it is a total secret what it's a spiritual revelation that's why it's a total secret amen other word it's now you know how revelation comes it comes like out of nowhere all of a sudden there's nothing there all sun is there in you praise the lord and that battles the devil it befuddles him it messes up with his mind he doesn't know what to do about it amen think of it all the angels shut up everything stopped seven is god's perfect number amen seven thunders voice of the trumpet amen and god was saying something jesus never spoke it john couldn't write it the devil the angels did not what is it amen only those whom god would know it amen on whomsoever he would reveal it to praise god hear that whomsoever he would reveal it to praise the lord amen praise god hallelujah oh my well there's the evidence praise god you see it right there hallelujah he's doing everything that he can to shut this down if he can my think about it brother sister praise god trying to get some stuff washed and ready and everything else while i'm preparing uh and getting this ready and all of a sudden my dryer breaks down i have to leave that and run to try to see what you see that's what the devil's job but i'm here to do this for the glory of god [Applause] hallelujah praise god satan will try to impersonate everything the church will do he will also try to do it everything outwardly everything praise god so you can't even look with your eyes now a lot of people say they got discernment a lot of people say they have this and all it is is human knowledge of observation and they're using that and calling that discernment they don't know what real discernment is they don't understand is that you don't know nothing and then all of a sudden whatever however deals with you i don't know but with me i'll her hear that speak and say no that is so-and-so that is this oh my and then if you have confidence enough and years enough obeying that then you'll act upon the word of god so you see the devil don't know nothing about that when that's made known to you until after you act on it and it's over it's done there's nothing he can do about it amen praise god so he'll try to impersonate it but they cannot imp he cannot impersonate this and there will be no mimics to this because he don't know it and there is no way for him to know it for it is the sword pull do you hear what the third pull is all the stuff about speaking on arms and and calling down stuff like that yes we will be able to do that as god directs us but that's not the real central core of it that's not the real central core of the matter he knows nothing about that he doesn't even understand it of what it really is for the secret lays beneath that amen i can't even think the rest of my life i can't see what i've seen i don't know what and i don't even know how to interpret what i see for he said stop go no further than right there where you are i am not prone to be a fanatic but i am just telling you the truth this is what brother branham said in the message called the seventh seal 1963. why this thing was now to be revealed now by the angel himself to the individual and between the angel to the individual it is a total secret and the thief is stealing away his bride in the middle of the night by the opening of his word making them prisoners to himself amen praise the lord i got a little bit more it's just one o'clock now give me a break let me preach the word here praise the lord hallelujah how perfect is this land the seventh trumpet the seventh seal it will also bring on the persecution of the jews brothers is this hard for any one of us here to go and prophesy the prophet already said it there when that last when that seven trumpet sounds and when that seventh seal breaks then it will be followed up now by the persecution of the jews is coming shortly after that amen praise god well because we could say a lot more stuff there but watch i want to go him revelation 9 13 he says here that sixth trumpet at the sixth trumpet two hundred thousand horsemen that were bound in the river euphrates amen were turned loose [Music] but there's not two hundred thousand horsemen anywhere in the world armies in the present modern armies you ain't got no 200 000 horsemen um anywhere see because there wasn't natural horses they breeded fire their blessed plates were jasper they had tails like a scorpion like a serpent their tails had the shape of a snake's head and it was stinging there were spiritual horses spiritual devils chargers that were bound at the river euphrates what was it not only the persecution of the jews but the old pagan roman empire now being revived the whoa my think of it what we're in the midst of here you know how many things are going on rapture going in progress the old roman empire now coming back and beginning to revive itself coming back mr babylon about to make itself manifest and when it does it will begin to do the same thing it did back there it threw the jews out of the city of rome and excluded them and persecuted them out and then it started on the christians and that is what he's talking about it'll do the very same thing all over again amen praise god hallelujah oh praise god see them horsemen at the river them devils were bound there because they could not cross from from where they are amen they couldn't cross from where they are to the other side that they may know the promise and they can't cross over from just this message of just the bible and of the written word they can't cross over from there into the fullness of the revelation and that's why they're literally bound he says brother branham said in the next place when i speak about bound when i say satan is bound i'm saying he is bound by chains of circumstances he's bound by the conditions he's under he can't do nothing about it he's got to stay on that side of the river he can't enter in the promised land of the opening of the fullness of the revealed word and if you want to read the rest of this you'll find it in the feast of the trumpets 1964 where he says them devils that were bound for 2000 years started riding and started riding through stalin and using hitler and them to kill and murder millions oh my you said brother branham that isn't roman that isn't roman oh he said but it's the same spirit see that done the same things back there to the jews and christians in all pagan roman days amen now watch what will happen to natural israel and what will happen to the spiritual church of today as we separate it amen they're being turned loose again upon the jews remember those six seals with the martyrs and everything else they receive ropes by grace because they were blinded so that we could see it amen they cannot see this gospel now but god did that so he might call out the people from among the gentiles the bride call out the bride from the gentiles and so because of that they were given robes amen and tear under that trumpet the jews who we know are absolutely against christ and absolutely against everything but the reason why they are is because the bible says that he allowed them to be blinded and they were blinded for our sake and god knows that they that that they would would have received it but he made them blind for our sake oh thank god that the trumpet the last trump has sound sounded and we are being given understanding of this call to the resurrection the call to this great rapture that is now in progress amen hallelujah we are having the last wrong call now praise god i'm winding this up now at this point and the redeemed are gathering in coming from the east and from the west in the natural world many people are fighting and resisting the changes that have taken places in society because the whole world is becoming mixed up and all the nations and races are all being mixed in and the people they don't understand what's happening and they're fighting and fighting and everything else not realizing that god allowing this to happen it's happening also in the spiritual realm that this has taken place but god is gathering his elect east west north south they're gathering in washed like the snow and free from all sin hallelujah amen the trumpet is sounding musicians come and they they the troops are being mustered and called to formation praise god and i want you to bear this in mind inspection is now going on the holy spirit is the officer and he is going down all the troops everyone and is checking us one by one searching us and checking us of how we are going amen thank god the final google call is in the air the last post amen is sounding in heaven brother branham said this is god's last altar call he said the spirit of god is crying out he said the cry goes out but how long will the spirit cry i do not know so come while there is yet time to come and commit your life completely to jesus christ completely to him praise the lord hallelujah amen one last thought when that last trumpet sounds in the army and the soldiers are told to return to their barracks then it sums out to let them know all unauthorized lights have to be put out any other body that claims they have revelation they have light they have this light they have that knowledge they have that god is going to start putting all those lights out because this is the last post amen and all unauthorized lights have to be put out completely so that the true light will now shine and the bride the church the elect of the living god will stand out because of the light of god that is within her heart and within her life praise god may god bless every one of you this afternoon and i trust what you have heard that you will maybe listen to it again because i try to put a lot of everything in there that you might be able to follow it up not just listen to the message and dismiss it but open your bible go back follow those scriptures check on what i have said i don't mind just like paul said i'm not paul but like paul said what i'm saying is in the word so it's in the message check it up and you will find this right there just like we said and the prophet of god will make it clear the holy spirit the inspector will make it clear praise the name of the lord hallelujah brother mike god bless you it's in your hands now and the lord bless you at this particular time amen god bless you all brothers [Applause] [Music] shall [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] and on that bright and cloudless morning when the dead and crash arise and the glory when we all stand and sing and his chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the sky [Music] i'll be there [Music] [Music] [Applause] of the lord shall sound in time shall be no more when the morning breaks eternal bright and fair lovers shall gather over on the other shore [Music] up yonder i'll be there [Music] praise god god bless you you may be seated for a couple minutes danny's got a few announcements he'd like to bring [Music] god bless you saints so um just a few announcements it's been a while since we've been able to come up and give a few announcements i think as things are now slowly trying to get back to normal we will do the same by the grace of god but just a few reminders on the on the sunday services you still require registration okay it's required that we keep a record of every name of every individual that attends the services we still have all of the protocols in place with respect to social distancing the fact that you need to wear a mask that you know there's no hugging there's no you know getting too close you can do the bumps you can do the handshakes you know when you go outside of the church if you want to remove your mask that's fine okay but again no hugging no you know just going up to somebody you know because oh we're all vaccinated no we're not maybe some are maybe some aren't and that's another note you know maybe you aren't vaccinated and uh you think that i don't need to be vaccinated this is you know god is protecting me and i'm this and that we're not interested in your opinion this is not a place where you come to uh you know uh try and uh bring division because that's a spirited division that's what that is i'm not saying you got to be vaccinated i'm not saying you don't have to be vaccinated okay but it's according to your own faith until the government says and sets certain legislation that if they say in order for you to attend a service you must be vaccinated you better be vaccinated if you want to come in here it's that simple okay but if you're not vaccinated and you want to come to church that's perfectly fine but you need to follow all the protocol exactly the way it's been set out you're not to hug you're not to whether you are whether you're not you're not to hug and get too close and and and push you know in any way shape or form this is the house of the lord we're not looking for any spirits to come in you know there's spirits that are moving across this message if you're not vaccinated you and or if you get the kovid you ain't got the holy ghost [Laughter] that's a lie from the pits of hell okay if you don't get the vaccination you're gonna die people tell me that i'm gonna die is that right if i don't get it or i'm gonna die if i do get it what a devil it's all lies the lord giveth the lord taketh he can't take your life unless god says you're coming home oh this person died from covet because they didn't get the vaccination they were going to die anyway to each to everything there is a time and a season now at the same time we don't want people walking in these front doors if they got a fever or they're not feeling well you don't you don't come into this house if you've got a fever if you've traveled outside of the country in the last two weeks you can't come it's that simple we're following the rules of the land okay but we're not interested in getting into controversy if you've got faith as a son or a daughter of god you know where you stand we don't live by fear we live by faith we heard it today amen praise god so um upcoming events will still be um notified by way of the emails or the text messages um if uh you know until further notice we will continue to have the wednesday night services online we will continue to have the prayer meetings on friday nights online if there's anything of significance that's going to change you will be notified and you will know about it okay if you have any questions or concerns please contact your deacon they're there for you to assist to answer questions if they don't have the answer they will get it to the best of their ability amen praise god and so god bless you all we want to remind you that we still you know as sons and daughters of god we've been away from the church for you know almost a year and a half whatever it's been and you know sometimes you get into certain routines and sometimes you forget things we don't want you to forget your tithes and your offerings because we still make the mortgage payment here every month we still pay the expenses of what needs in order to operate and to run this church and to improve it and to you know to do the improvements that we've done we rely upon faith being in you know revealed to you as individuals to give and to pay your tithes as god has given you faith as a son or a daughter of god to turn around say i don't have to pay tithes you've got the wrong revelation it's that simple okay i don't have to give offerings yeah you don't technically but as a son or a daughter of god knowing that it's god that gives to you and uses you and and works through you you can't out give the lord i just let out a little secret try and out give the lord hallelujah praise our god god bless you brother mike did you want to
