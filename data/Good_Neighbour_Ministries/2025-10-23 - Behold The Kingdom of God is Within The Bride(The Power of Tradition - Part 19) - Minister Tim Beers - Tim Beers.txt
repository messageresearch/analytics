When's the kingdom coming? And here was the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Behold the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is was with you. And now behold the kingdom of God is within the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Uh we got a few announcements here. We just want to reiterate uh from Saturday, I mean last Sunday before we read our scripture. Uh first one uh October 25th, Saturday, woman's fellowship breakfast and study. Amen.

That's why we should be praying without ceasing. Amen. Hallelujah. So that's the announcements. Let's turn to the word of God tonight. Hallelujah. We got three scripture reading here. Amen. Hallelujah. And uh I got to get my glasses or else I'm just going to speak without reading. Hallelujah. Let's turn to Galatians 2:16. Amen. Hallelujah. And then we're going to go to Luke 17:20 and then John 3:1. We're continuing on the power of tradition part 19. And my subject tonight, my title is Behold, the kingdom of God has come within the bride. But my subject tonight is is it's a little different, but I hope it unfolds itself. The bride is completing the work of redemption. You say, "Brother, the work of redemption is already completed through the cross, through the opening of the Yes. But now the bride is in the word has become in the bride now. &gt;&gt; And as she fulfills that word and as that word that has been spoken and prophesied manifests through her life. Amen. It's not her. It's never her as as we're going to see. It's always him. It's always been him. Amen. Fulfilling his word now through the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So to give you a little where my my thoughts are, my mind is on this uh statement because some people you know that are very learned in the message, they might take and go all different ways. Galatians 2:16. Let us pray. Father, thank you Lord tonight as we gather together. Father, Lord, we have prayed, we have believed, we have studied. Father, now we come after a long day. Some of us I know Lord I I had a wonderful day yesterday studying a little bit and this morning a little bit more reviewing things and then all of a sudden bang just before we were leaving a few hours my body starts getting under attack. But Lord I know that's for me to step out by faith father now because without a sacrifice there's you know Lord we got to put a sacrifice on the altar for something for you to burn. And I stand here tonight. Amen. We are here tonight by the grace of God. We are here by faith tonight. &gt;&gt; It took faith to be here tonight, Lord. And may you come and honor that faith tonight, Lord. Lord, do what you always do, Lord. And what is easy for you to do. Bless your people. Fill them. Strengthen them. Heal them. Deliver them. Open prison doors. Cast out demons of unbelief. Father, Lord, all of us here tonight, Lord, may we be caught up into your presence, oh God. Grant it now, Father. Bless your word in Jesus name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Galatians 2:16. Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith of Jesus Christ. Even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by faith. We know what faith is. It's a revelation. By faith of Christ, not of works of the law, but by the works of by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. But while but if while we seek to be justified by Christ, the revealed word, the anointing, we ourselves also are found sinners. Is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid. For if I build again the things which I destroy, I make myself a transgressor. For I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God. I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me. That's very important here when Paul is saying that it's not I that live yet, but it is Christ that lives in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith of the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not frustrate the grace of God by the law. I do not frustrate the grace of God. For if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain. Amen. We recognize that this life, this token life, what God is doing, the kingdom of God inside the bride today is not by law. Amen. Luke 17:20. And when he was demand of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation. Neither shall they say, Lo here or low there, for behold, the kingdom of God is within you." Hallelujah. John 3:1. We have to bring this scripture. We have all the scriptures tie in together and we bring in this series and this scripture always comes up because if we don't start right, we don't end right. There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. The same came to Jesus by night and said unto him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God. For no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him. Wow. Wow. You know, we look we look back there, but can we bring it to today? Can we if we're recognizing ourselves in the word of God today? We're seeing ourselves. Hallelujah. Amen. Jesus answered and said unto him, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee the except the man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus said unto him, "How can a man be born when he's old? Can he enter the second time into the mother's womb and be born?" Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, but that which is born of the spirit is spirit." Marvel not that I say unto thee, you must be born again. Allelujah. You may be seated. Marvel not. Amen. Hallelujah. This day, marvel not that the word of God is telling us that we must be born again. I want to read a few scriptures here. Tonight is Bible study. So, I want to read a few scriptures and a few quotes. Hallelujah. Amen. That I got written down here and see what the Lord will do tonight. Hallelujah. Matthew 16:19. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. And whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Now, we're talking about the kingdom of God here. And we recognize that the kingdom has come. Amen. We believe the seals have been open. We believe God sent a prophet. Amen. Hallelujah. And and the word always comes to the prophet. So a word came to the prophet and a word was spoken in these last days. Hallelujah. And that word was to go to a bride. And that word is the kingdom of God. So the kingdom of God, Amen, is to go to the bride. Hallelujah. So I want you to recognize tonight, Amen, that if you are truly born again, the kingdom has come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the kingdom has authority. The kingdom has privileges. Amen. The blood has purchased everything. Everything we have need of is in that kingdom. We don't have to do anything in ourselves. That's the covenant that is given to the seed of Abraham, the faith seed of Abraham. Not what you can do tonight. Amen. How you can work things out in your life, but what I have already done, what I have already completed. Amen. It's always the mystery. That is the mystery of the kingdom of God that is coming within man. The mystery that God Amen. That I'm in the father, the father in me, and I in you and you in me. &gt;&gt; That's the mystery. And let me tell you, even in this message, it's a mystery that the that that the same God that lived in Jesus Christ, the same God that lived in the prophet that was waved over us, that same God, that same word, that same manifestation is here today, sir. &gt;&gt; That same kingdom of God is here today. Amen. It's always been that way, my brothers and sisters. Hallelujah. We look back at Jesus day and we go, if we were in the days of Jesus, oh my, I would recognize him. I would support him. I would be right beside him. They didn't. Only a very few. Is that the truth? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's day, same thing happened. We look today and I'm not going to talk about all the nonsense that's going on and he would call it nonsense too in the message which is mess age. I'm not in Leosian. I'm not in the mess age. I'm in the capstone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon didn't put me in the capstone. The Holy Ghost put me in the capstone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the Holy Ghost has put me in the rapture. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost is the rapture inside of me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But they look back at him and and they go, "Oh, if I was in brother Brandham's day, I would be doing this and that." But here he was, the word made flesh. Don't you understand? Amen. The great saying, "History repeats itself." Don't you understand that the word of God always repeats itself? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you come into a consciousness and a reality, when back in their day, when they recognized when Peter said, "Thou art the the Christ, the son of the living God," something struck him. awakening happened and he recognized who this Jesus was more than a prophet. Hallelujah. Just like in the back in brother Brandham's days, a few recognized that this was Malachi 4:5. Now here we are today, my brothers and sisters. What are we to do? What are we to do just to play church and and come to church and call ourselves believers? And I can quote the message. I can quote the Bible. Is that what we're supposed to do? Is that what is prophesied for us to do? No. We're to bring forth the word of God today. But let me tell you one thing. It's got to repeat again. It's got to repeat in these last days. So don't get surprised when they don't recognize who you are &gt;&gt; in the message. Don't get surprised when they when they tell you you're false or you're this or you're that because you're preaching the word of God. Oh, too many preachers are are preaching it safe. If I if I just say what the the the tapes say, if I just say what brother Brandon say, I'd be okay. I won't be off the word. I won't be a Judas or an antichrist. That's not the bride. It's never been the bride of Jesus Christ. It's never been a true believer down through the ages. Uh Luther got a revelation, the just shall live by faith. Amen. He went out and preached it. It was contrary to everything. Amen. That he believed and that everybody around him that believed. But he stepped out by faith. And that's what produced the revival, the restoration of the word of God in this last day. When people step out, the bride has to step out. Amen. She's got the message. Yes, she's got the message. But now the message got to get inside of her. It's got to be revealed to her. And when it's inside and revealed and that same God that was in brother Brandham is in her, then he starts speaking &gt;&gt; and and speaking the word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. John 18:36 Jesus said, we're talking about the kingdom tonight. Hallelujah. My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not of this world. So we understand that. We recognize that. Amen. Hallelujah. His kingdom is an unseen kingdom. Hallelujah. Is an invisible kingdom. Amen. But to the bride of Jesus Christ, she sees her his kingdom because the kingdom is within her. Luke 17:21. Nor will they say, look here, it is it is or there for behold the kingdom of God is in the midst of you. And then in the other place, he said, the kingdom of God is within you. Hallelujah. I believe he is here tonight. Do you believe he's here tonight? &gt;&gt; Are you conscious of his presence here tonight? Oh, hallelujah. It does something when it when you recognize and you're conscious of his presence, you start attracting him on the scene. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Things can happen here tonight. Not brother Tim, beyond me. Things can happen here tonight by your faith. Amen. This is not just another Wednesday night. This is not just another Wednesday night cuz Brother Tim's preaching or whoever's preaching. This is another night. Amen. That could be your night where faith will operate in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That your enlightening, your awakening might come. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; That's what we're here. That's the presence that we believe that we're in tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We won't just uh play church or play religion when we're, oh, I'm coming to church. You're coming into the presence of almighty God. Amen. Into the presence of the pillar of fire &gt;&gt; where he knows everything. He knows your thoughts. He knows your heart. He know what you did today. He know what you said today. He know the mistakes that you made today. He knows everything about you. That's the presence we're coming into. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when we recognize that's his presence, that the kingdom of God has come, the kingdom of God is in our midst and the kingdom of God has come within us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Mark 9:1. And he said to them, truly I say unto you, there are some standing here who will not taste death. Oh, hallelujah. Why? Because the kingdom, Amen. until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power. What is that power of the kingdom? The rapture. Amen. The the body change, the translation. Amen. Hallelujah. We are experienced that now. Listen. Don't put it off to a a a future event, my brothers and sisters. Amen. That that is hap that power that translation is happening now. It's taking place now. Every victory you get every time you overcome. Hallelujah. That's the rapture manifesting. That's the kingdom within you. Amen. Hallelujah. Revelations 11:15. Hallelujah. You keep praying. You keep believing. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm pressing on up here. I'm pressing through. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You don't realize what the the preacher has to go through. Amen. To break through unbelief. But let's let's pray. Let's believe together. Amen. Amen. Let's join our faith together as one tonight. Amen. I'm just a vessel up here that God is using, but we're all in the kingdom tonight. Amen. We're all in the midst of the kingdom tonight. Amen. the pillar fires moving in here. I believe the presence of Jesus Christ, the person of Christ is here tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to honor him. I want to respect him. Amen. I want to give all that I can to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelations 11:15. Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet and there was a loud voices in heaven saying, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever." Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. My brothers, this is about to take place. Amen. Hallelujah. Matthew 7:21, "Not everyone who says to me,"Lord, Lord," will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but the ones who do the will of my father who is in heaven. Luke 16:16, "The law of the prophets were until John. Since then, the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone forces his way into it. Everyone presses their way into the kingdom. That's what it is. Is a forcing. The Bible says it's a pressing in into the kingdom. Amen. That's what we are experiencing in our walks. Amen. That's why we have to overcome. Amen. We heard on Sunday about the adoption. And to be adopted, Amen. into his kingdom is to overcome. Overcoming is a great thing, my brothers and sisters, in the Bible. Look in the book of Revelations. It says many different places to the overcomer. Amen. Who overcomes in their age, I will grant to them. I will grant to them. I will grant to them all the privileges of God and of the kingdom is granted to the overcomer. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. If you walk with Christ in your heart by the new birth, you have been dealing with many things. Oh yes. If you're really in this walk, you're dealing with many things. You know why? Because there's a transformation taking place in your life. There's the old dying out and then there's the new. And the devil will always try to keep you in the old, keep you in the flesh and keep you from the spirit, keep you from recognizing things, keep you from recognizing familiar spirits in your life. You know, familiar spirits, hallelujah, speak to you. You know how they speak to you? I'll tell you how deceiving that this is. But when the Holy Ghost reveals it to you, it's plain and simple. But those familiar spirits speak to you in your own voice, in your own head. You wonder why people go off on all kinds of craziness, I call it. There's other words for it, but craziness, all kinds of of uh imaginations, all kinds of uh things that they, "Oh, God spoke to me." And then they end up, like Brother Brandham says, shipwrecked out there. Their faith gets shipwrecked. But God spoke to me and told me to do this. God spoke to me and said to leave the church. God spoke to me and told me, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not to believe what you're saying. All these things. Oh, brother. It's so deceiving. You don't even realize until God comes. Amen. And reveal something to you and break you out of a delusion of Satan. Familiar spirits to the overcomer. I will grant. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. You are dealing with many things and asking and praying about what you want him to do in your life to become more like him. So you come to church tonight. We all come to church tonight with something in our hearts. Each and every one of us have something in our hearts. I hope we do. I hope we have a hunger. I hope we have a thirst for God. Amen. Hallelujah. that you want God to speak to you. Even if he says wait, he knows what you are going through. God says I am in control and I will speak the answer to you. Hallelujah. Now get your mind out of brother Tim speaking the answer to you. Hallelujah. It's God going to speak the answer to you. It's God and the spirit that's going to reveal to your heart. Hallelujah. That's why Jesus said, "Flesh and blood has not revealed it to you. Education, man, has not revealed it to you." Hallelujah. But my father which is in heaven has revealed it to you. You see, my brothers, we have to break in to the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's in our midst. Amen. To know the kingdom, you got to press into the kingdom. You got to force yourself into the kingdom of God. Hallelujah. Oh, what do you how do I force myself? Hallelujah. You hunger. You thirst for righteousness. Jesus said, I can only tell you what the word says. You knock. You knock. Amen. You call like the unjust judge. You keep knocking and keep calling. You keep pressing. Amen. The battle's getting tougher. Keep pressing on. Like the angel said to brother Brandham, "You don't know what awaits you. Keep pressing the battle. Keep pressing into the kingdom." Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, this is getting Listen, there's never been a day like this day. &gt;&gt; Never been a day to preach the gospel like this day. Never been a resistance and preaching the gospel like this day. I'm telling you right now, this is the climax. This is where Satan, this is, he doesn't want this to take place. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want this to take place. He doesn't want a bride to recognize who she is in this hour &gt;&gt; because then he's defeated. If he can keep you defeated, keep you blind, Amen. keep you from seeking the kingdom of God within you. &gt;&gt; Never been a day like this day. Oh, hallelujah. Listen, I've been preaching for 25 years now. Amen. And I I I can look back and there's never been a time to preach the words like today. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's never been so hard like today. Never been so deceiving like today. Hallelujah. Never has the enemy fought like today, like he's fighting right now. Hallelujah. He's fighting our minds. Brother Brandham said he he said back then the devil's standing at each and every one of your minds tonight. Here lays doubt and here lays faith. Faith in what? And doubt in what? What? Not not necessarily what I'm saying. The spirit of God reveals truth. When the spirit of truth comes, it guides you and leads you into all truth. It's not that. It's who you are. Hallelujah. The word's coming forth time after time and is revealing who you are. The spirit is speaking who you are. And faith and death right there. That's where the devil's meeting you. So you don't recognize who you are. That's why some of us stay defeated. That's why things happen in our lives. We don't grow. We're stagnated. That's why we become lukewarm, stale. Amen. Our prayer life dies. All these things happen. Then we take on a religious form because we're in the message and I'm a believer. So, I got to keep a certain standard. So, you take on a a religious spirit upon you instead of the Holy Ghost. Instead of the Holy Ghost dealing with your life, taking control of your life, possessing your life, Amen. moving and leading and guiding you. Amen. Day by day, you stop overcoming all the work of the enemy. Hallelujah. Amen. This is not in my notes, but I'm just going to preach. Hallelujah. Amen. God is in control and he will speak and answer you. But if you come here with nothing at all or expecting nothing, you might have come here out of a religious tradition. God is real. God is active in a believer's life, a born again believer's life that's been awakened by the reality of his presence in this hour and what he is doing in his bride. We are here to expect him to continue to finish the work he started in us. Every time I come to service, every time I pray, every day I wake from that time 34 years ago that my awakening came, I expect every day for God to continue to finish that work that he started in me. Amen. I was born again for a purpose. You are born again for a purpose. Amen. You are born again to overcome &gt;&gt; and become what God made you to be in this hour. We are here to take a rapture. We are here to take a body change. We are here to possess the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; in flesh. &gt;&gt; We are here to get total victory. Amen. In this hour which will come by perfect faith. Amen. is already in the seed. Amen. Has that seed been awakened? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. So everything is in the seed and the seed has been awakened. Hallelujah. Just being conscious of that keeps your life. Amen. Under under great expectation every day of your life for God. Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We believe. We believe. I know. I I listen. I believe everybody in here believes. I believe that. It takes more than believing though. &gt;&gt; Takes more than believing. That's why we're preaching the word of God. Amen. To press into the kingdom. Hallelujah. Amen. Listen, no man has to force you. You know, I I heard a preacher say one time, "You can preach until your tongue is hanging down, till you're blue in the face to somebody, and next thing you know, they just go right back out in the world." That has nothing to do with the preacher and and how many times you get ministered to over and over and over again. God speaks to you over and over and over again and then you fall right back into the same sin over and over again. You need to come conscious. You need to come first of all conscious of the cycles that are happening in your life that are taking place in your life. Then you need to come conscious. Hold on a minute. There must be sin which is unbelief in my life. Why I keep repeating the same cycle over and over again. Hallelujah. No man knows the things of God save the spirit of God. And he whom the spirit of God reveals it to them. We need to call on God for revelation. Brother Brandham said it. He said it clearly to the bride of Jesus Christ. Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize. I'm saying it to you tonight. It means more to you than perhaps you realize. Hallelujah. It's your everything. Hallelujah. To put on this word and to overcome and to become the very image of Christ is revelation. Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you, Lord. We have accepted the Bible. We have accepted the great truths of it. But still, it's not real to most people. Brother Brandon speaking here because the revelation by the spirit is not there. The word has not been quickened. The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:21 that we have become the righteousness of our God by our union with Jesus Christ. Did you get it? It says that we are the very righteousness of God himself by being in Christ. Now we know the Bible says that it can't be denied but revelation of it is missing. Revelation of it is missing. Hallelujah. Right there something struck me. We have the message. We have the prophecies. We have the Bible. We can quote it over and over both scriptures and brother Brandham's quotes. Hallelujah. But he says without revelation he said we have all that but something is missing. Oh God. That's where the woman who cleaned her house, who lost that coin, swept out for that pearl of great price. She went and cleaned her house from top to bottom until she found that pearl of great price. That coin that she lost, my brothers and sisters, that's the kingdom. That's the kingdom come within us. These are all signs that God has given us in this hour to press into the kingdom, to press through in our lives. Are we awake? Do we understand? Hallelujah. That God has given the signs. Amen. That God is giving the clues here. Hallelujah. That God is showing the way. God is revealing something here. All you can do is take the word into your life. take it and go until it manifests in your life. That's always been the case with a true believer. When they when they receive a truth, in order for them to become that truth and for that truth to manifest in their life and for that truth to overcome inside of them, there got to be a pressing in. There's got to be a dying out. There's got to be something inside of you that is hunger and thirsting to receive that, to experience that, for it to become real, a real manifestation in your life. Hallelujah. Glory to God. But that but the revelation of it is missing. It is not real to the majority of God's children. Think about it. I believe to the bride of Jesus Christ in this hour. That's the only thing that's becoming real to her. Hallelujah. Amen. It is just as good verse in the Bible. But we need to have it made alive to us. That will take revelation. Brother Brandon speaking here. The revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. The new birth is Christ. The new birth is Christ. It's not just an experience. It's not the gifts of the Holy Ghost. It's not healing. It's not all these things that Pentecostal can can produce. Amen. It's the token. Amen. This is the evening time where the token must be on display. That's why he said in the token message, you must have the token because that is what's required the word to manifest in this hour. Hallelujah. Amen. So the new birth is the token in this hour. It's the life of Christ. The very life of Christ. Not Christ in part but Christ in whole. Where the bride and the bride and groom become one. In the same where the scripture is fulfilled, a husband and a wife become one. That is a mystery. But God is speaking to the church and his bride. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm not worried about becoming one with my wife, taking that scripture literally and becoming one with my wife. I'm I'm I'm worried about becoming one with Christ. I want her to become one with Christ. Me to become one with Christ. Amen. Christ joins everything together in him. Hallelujah. Not in us. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen. God has revealed to you this great mystery. Amen. This is a great mystery. God has revealed it to the bride in this hour. Amen. The mystery of what? The kingdom. The mystery that God and man are becoming one again. The mystery that the bride is incarnating the token in this hour. That the bride has the rapture manifesting in her life. The mystery. Oh, it's a mystery to a lot of people still in this message. Amen. They read the quotes. They read everything. They listen to the tapes. But it's still a mystery until he comes and opens it up. Hallelujah. I remember listening to Christ is the mystery of of God being revealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; And listening to that, I listened to it many times, but one time I listened to it and all I heard I listened from beginning to end. It's a couple hours long. I listened from beginning to end. And you know, all I seen was so simple. It was that he was inside of me. &gt;&gt; That I and him are one and the same in this hour. That Christ come to dwell inside of me. He was that whole message. I I don't even know if if the words that I was hearing was actually coming out of the prophet's mouth. That's how supernatural it was. It was just God speaking about our relationship. Amen. Our relationship, mine and his relationship. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Amen. The bride is the mystery of Christ revealed in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are that mystery being revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. I'm going to put my amen up here if I don't start hearing amen. Second boy. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Don't let the devil shut your mouth. Say amen. Say glory. Say hallelujah. Oh, brothers. Quiet in here. You're the one. You're not participating. You're a spectator. Participate. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe it'll shake that tiredness off of you, that carnality off of you, that problem that's on your mind right now that you can't shake. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. God, the devil will give you a problem that you can't shake. And you bring it into the house of the Lord. And here you are trying to shake it all night. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you'll shake it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I come up here with pain in my body. Praise God. I'm coming to preach the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. Wait for the preacher to stir you up. Oh, this brother is going to come and shake me and stir me. He puts chills all down my body and all through my bones and hallelujah. Then I'm going to praise the Lord. You need to be born again. You're born again. You come with the kingdom of God inside of you. The kingdom of God is inside of you. Stirring inside of you. Is speaking inside of you. He's the one that gets you excited. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he's stirring in your life and moving in your life. Look what he's done. Look what he's done in your life. Look where he's brought you from. Look where you could have been tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. is him. And not only that, he saved you in the flesh. He's delivered you and healed you in the flesh. But your soul is feeding on heavenly mana. Amen. Your soul's feeding on the kingdom of God tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh God, revelation is coming to you that you and the father are one and the same. &gt;&gt; That you were in his mind before the foundation of the world. You see all these quotes, they just become quotes. It has become you know before the foundation of the world God thought of you in his mind. Hallelujah. My brothers and sisters all these things become all quotes. But let me tell you when it becomes real to you. Hallelujah. When you know that you were in the mind of God that you experienced God. Amen. You know God is speaking to you and he's saying you're mine. I knew you before the foundation of the world. I loved you. I'm the one that called you. I'm the one that was there at this time, that time of your life. I'm the one that spoke to you. I'm the one that delivered you. &gt;&gt; It changes everything, my brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't need nobody to tell you to praise God. Hallelujah. You'll praise him anyway. &gt;&gt; You don't need that Jones beside you because Mrs. Jones is not praising God. I don't have to praise God if Mrs. Jones not praising God. Hallelujah. I'm not talking about working up emotions and that stuff. I'm talking to the sons and daughters of God here tonight. Are we sons and daughters of God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. I'll praise him anyways. Hallelujah. Oh, Brother Tim sits over there. Most of the time, you know, he gets all excited and this and that. Yes, I'm going to get excited. Brother Desmond's up there smiling, getting excited. Brother Phillips praising God over there. Amen. and we're sitting here praising God. Why shouldn't we praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He gave us a message. He gave us a word of God. He gave us his prophet in these last days. &gt;&gt; And he gave us precious, precious promises. I will never leave you. I will never forsake you, but I'll be with you and in you to the end of time. I'm trying to get to my message, my brothers and sisters, but there's got to be a level of unbelief broken before it can come through. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let me read a few things here. to enlighten. The phrase the kingdom of God has come within man suggests that the kingdom is not a future physical place but is a present spiritual reality that exists within the bride. Hallelujah. Amen. It can be interpreted in several ways. God's kingdom is a spiritual reality in the hearts of believers. It is a present in the midst of people through the bride's ministry, the revealed word of this hour. Or it has within reach through the token life that is manifested in his bride. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. The Bible says, "Behold." Amen. Behold. The word behold is a command to play to pay close attention. That's what our life should be. That's what our walk should be spiritually speaking. Pay close attention. Amen. Are you conscious of God? Are you aware of God every wicked moment of your life? Because I'm telling you one thing. Hallelujah. God is moving around you every single day, every moment of your life. Even sometimes he wakes you up in the middle of the night and he speaks to you. He never leaves you. He never forsakes you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Play close attention. Meaning look, see spiritually speaking or gaze upon something with awe. Oh, hallelujah. with awe. Does this word still awe you? Does this revelation still awe you? Oh my. When I was hearing the word of God Sunday, I don't know about you, but it was all in me. Hallelujah. God was speaking lip to ear to me. Hallelujah. I have adopted you. Amen. I have called you. I predestinated you. Amen. Oh, you're going to overcome. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. I'm going to give you the faith that you're going to need in the time that you need it and you're going to overcome. &gt;&gt; Nothing is going to touch you. &gt;&gt; I won't allow anything to come into your life. I won't give you anything more than what you can handle. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I know. I've designed your life. Listen, Satan has no control over us. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; He doesn't own this property. &gt;&gt; God has redeemed it and bought it back. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ. Do we believe the blood of Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; He has no control over us tonight. &gt;&gt; So why don't you cast him out? Even you mature believers, cast them out. Cast the fear out. Cast the doubt out tonight. He has no control over the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God has come. It's his kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's his kingdom in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Didn't he say, "I've given you power." Hallelujah. Amen. With appreciation and understanding draws an audience focus to every message and every divine revelation. Behold, to you. Behold, God's speaking to you. A man can't give you revelation. When you catch a revelation, that's God. The kingdom behold unto you. Hallelujah. Behold, the kingdom is for you. God speaking to you. Hallelujah. What it is spiritually meaning the word behold to look to see something and behold means to look and see something of importance. Behold, or the variation of this word appears 1,500 times in the Old Testament and 200 times in the New Testament. At its core, redemption means regaining, restoring something that was lost or overlaps with concepts like rescue, recovery, deliverance, and atonement. But in the biblical sense, redemption is God's act of freeing his people from bondage. whether to slavery, to sin, or death through his cross. Now, when a man hallelujah, I won't even get through a lot of this. We'll have to go to part two. But when a man in the beginning was made him superior to anything on earth, he gave him jurisdiction of everything on earth to control everything. He controlled the animal life. He controlled the fowl life, the fish, the sea, the winds. He controlled the planet life. He controlled everything. Man was made as a secondary God on earth. &gt;&gt; He was given the power to control all things. &gt;&gt; Now listen, type it in what we're speaking here tonight. Hallelujah. This is the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All things. All elements of the earth that was in Adam. Adam was given these great powers. Then the power that was given to make his choice is where he fell. And because he had free moral agency, we all have free moral agency. And Adam could speak to the winds and it would stop. He could speak to the trees and they would obey him. He could speak to the wildlife and they would obey him. He could speak to the waters and it was everything obeyed Adam. And then the f the fall came. that he lost everything. We know that. Amen. We're clear on that. But what happened? Was there a restoration to all things? Christ redeemed it all back. He bought it all back for us. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; So now when we when we look at this, we can look at that and say, "Adam can speak to the winds." You can speak to the winds. &gt;&gt; Adam stopped and he spoke to the trees. You can speak to the trees. You can speak to your situations. You can speak to your problems. &gt;&gt; You can speak to everything in your life &gt;&gt; if you truly believe it's been restored back &gt;&gt; by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Just going to skip over a few things here. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. The breach between the church ages and the in the seven seals. Now he has the title deed of to redemption. He has it in his hand. Mediation is done now. He has it in his own hand. Remember, it's been in the hands of God all the time, but now it's in the hands of the lamb. Now, watch the title deed of redemption of all creation is in his hands. And he come to claim it back for the human race. For you. For you. &gt;&gt; Not claim it back for angels. &gt;&gt; Claim it back to the human race. &gt;&gt; For you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Which it was given for to make sons and daughters of God again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not church members, not religious people. To make sons and daughters &gt;&gt; again in this hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He gave it and claimed it and gave it back to you. It's given back to us tonight. Amen. The title deed, the authority, the control. &gt;&gt; Amen. given back to us tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Amen. And until in this last day, there is again another people in the land who under their message will be the final voice to the final age. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; that's it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation 17, the spirit and the bride say come. This message has got to come to you and me. It's got to identify you and me in the scriptures. Hallelujah. Once more the world will hear directly from God. Where where were she? Where will the world according to the prophet hear directly from God again? By the tapes. The tapes are for the bride of Jesus Christ to receive the word. Like the angel came to Mary and and told her, "You're going to conceive." Mary said to the tapes, "Be it unto me according to thy word." And then Mary went out. She didn't keep pressing play, play, play. She started producing, producing until she gave birth to the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Okay. 17. Revelation. The spirit and the bride say, "Come once more. The world will heal directly from God." Oh, God still has a voice for the people of the world. Even as it has given a voice to the bride. This is the prophet speaking here. Leo and churches. You see that voice he's saying is in the bride today. You see what these movements are doing? blind the people, blind them from recognizing who they are. What is the greatest quote that brother Brad said about the bride of Jesus Christ and the greatest um accomplishment or you want to say it? I don't the word is but the greatest thing that the bride will overcome is to recognize who she is. When she recognizes who she is, she'll be invincible. So, the devil is going to throw everything. The serpent snuck right into the message. He's going to throw everything. He's going to take the same quotes. He's going to take the same prophet's message. He's going to take it and put a delusion, put a smokec screen, a veil blindness on the people for what? That she doesn't recognize who she is. &gt;&gt; Yep. That's it. She is the voice of God according to the prophet. The world will hear one more time from God by the voice of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the scriptures say. That's what brother Brandham is saying here. Anything that comes against the word of God. Amen. Anything that came against look at today everybody Jesus was a good man. These statements are made for a reason. Jesus was a good prophet but the son of God. You see you see that devil? Oh yeah. Oh you're a good believer. You press play. You quote the prophet. You quote the Bible. You come to church regularly. You do your religious duties. You do all your works. Think about it, saints. But the devil will allow you to do all those things. But when you come to recognize, hold on a minute. No, this is not what this is not what the prophet was sent for. This is not what it's all about. This is not what I feel in my heart. This is not my conviction in my life. This is not what God is speaking to me. Something different than what is being said out there. Hallelujah. And that's where the bride has to stand in this last hour to speak the word of God of who she is. Amen. And let me try to close it off here. Hallelujah. There's so much more I can say, but we're just going to put it into another message. The bride is born again with the power and authority and his character. With the spoken word in us, and we speak by his spirit, everything in us by the new birth will restore what was lost. when we overcome in our lives. Hallelujah. Amen. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. If a man says he's born again and tries to place these promises of Christ in the last days to some other age, think about it, some other age. Do you realize that movement that's going on? is another age. It's putting people in a delusion of another age. The promises that have been spoken in the message are for today, for the bride to manifest, &gt;&gt; not for another age. Hallelujah. Making him Christ yesterday. Oh, always looking back to what he did yesterday. Isn't that what is is coming? 60s something years since the prophet is gone and and people are looking back and still telling stories about the prophet. I like them too, but that ain't going to that ain't going to do what you know Christ wants to do in my life by looking at the stories, quoting I sit down with people all the time and you can see in their spirit. You can understand the Holy Ghost inside of you knows where they're at. I'm not judging people. The word judges, not me. I don't judge. The word judges. I'm just part of the word. So I can see that that that manifestation, that discernment. And they think it's all about quoting brother Brandham. It's all about understanding the mysteries. And the Bible teaches us clearly. You can have all the mysteries. You can have all this, all that, all this, all that. But if you don't have love, perfect love, you have nothing. Hallelujah. Making him yesterday. Quoting, quoting, quoting. Now I can understand where Jesus says they'll come to me in that day. Lord, Lord, I was in the message. I believe God sent a prophet. I quoted, I quote it every day of my life. He said, "Depart from me. I didn't even know you. You workers of iniquity." Iniquity is what? Knowing. Listen, God is going to speak to every single one that comes by this message. He's going to speak to everyone, everyone's heart, whether they go this way or they go that way. He's going to speak to every heart and reveal to them the truth. But it's the way that they go, the way that they choose. Amen. Now listen. He says when you're doing that making Christ yesterday and not today in the bride, he says that man or that person has been under a delusion by Satan. By Satan in this message. A delusion. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let me just find something here to close her off. Hallelujah. There's so much more I can say. I want to talk about overcoming a little bit more, but I want to just lay in this quickly of who you are. Amen. Give me five minutes. Hallelujah. You throw aside everything. Open up that channel and say, "God, your word is eternally true and it's for me." If the whole church fails, the whole message, if the whole world fails, yet I cannot fail. That's your faith tonight. Hallelujah. Because I'm taking your word, the revelation. There's the battle. That's the great thing. Now, remember this. Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts. Hallelujah. But the book of Revelation shows that the Antichrist spirit will try to come into the church. the message and would come in and and try to defile it. Make it lukewarm, formal, and powerless. That's what it's doing. Oh, just calm down. You're believers. Just take it easy. You believe the message. You You know, you believe God sent a prophet. Take No, no. That's not for the bride. Hallelujah. The bride is on fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. She's not calming down. She's not cooling down. Amen. for nobody. Hallelujah. And and yeah, she's going to become a a fanatic. She's going to look crazy to people. Like Paul said, the way that I worship God, you got you call crazy. Listen, people in this message are going to call the bride, the true bride of Jesus Christ. When God shows her off, God's going to manifest through her. Hallelujah. And who's going to see her more than anybody? The message is going to see her. Hallelujah. Amen. The true church is a continuation of the book of Acts. Amen. Hallelujah. Making it work lukewarm. Amen. intent destruction on God's discrediting God's word right down to the time he's cast in the lake of fire. He fights that. He cannot stand it. He knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is, what she stands for and what she can do, the greater works, she'll be an invincible army. He hates that. That's what the devil's fighting tonight. And every night that we come into the house of God, every time you consecrate and dedicate yourself. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's come musicians. Amen. Hallelujah. John 5:19. This is not finished. I just going to have to brush over a few things and then re re redo it. This harmony now exists between the groom and his bride. Now this is a reality now. He shows her his word of life, the token. She receives it. She never doubts it. Therefore, nothing can harm her, not even death. Death, where is your sting? You can't die. The fear of death Satan's still putting on believers. For if the seed be planted and watered, God will raise it up again. Here's the secret of this. Now listen, this is the prophet here. Here's the secret of this. The word is in the bride as it was in Mary. Oh. Oh, sorry. Let me The word is in the tapes. The word is in the bride. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; What are you trying to say, brother Tim? When you make that statement over and over, the word is inside of you. &gt;&gt; It's a living word. What does living mean? It means a substance that has life. &gt;&gt; That has life. It has a nature. It has a character. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. nature. &gt;&gt; It's God, Christ, that wants to live his life, his character, his nature through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil's trying to stop that. &gt;&gt; He's trying to stop that and prevent that from happening inside of you. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That's why he's using the word like he did with Eve in the beginning. He took the word. Has not God said? Has not the prophet said? Think about it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. The bride has the mind of Christ. The bride does. For she knows what he wants done with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She performs the commandments of the word in his name. For she listen for she not the tapes. For she has thus sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe you'll catch a glimpse of this. I don't know. She has thus sayeth the Lord. When the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted by the water, it comes to full harvest serving its purpose. Listen, I'm going to finish this off and then that's it. Those in the bride do only his will. No one can make her do otherwise. Oh brother, this brother told me this that no one no one can make her do otherwise when he has come. They have thus sayaeth the Lord or they keep still. They know that it has to be God in them that doing the works, fulfilling his own word. He did not complete all his works while he was here on his earthly ministry. Even the prophet, he even said himself, I finished my part, but now Christ and the bride's part has to come. Now he works in and through the bride. She knows that. She knows that. Hallelujah. She knows that. For it is for it was not yet time for him. Hallelujah. To do certain things that must be done now. Certain things in the word that has been prophesied must be done now. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's her and him become in one. Behold the kingdom of God is within the bride of Jesus Christ tonight. &gt;&gt; Behold the kingdom. Amen. Here, right here tonight. Behold the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And he's our king. &gt;&gt; He's our king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's stand. There's so much more I can say, but that's it for tonight. Hallelujah. We'll continue it. Oh, glory to God. Behold the kingdom of God. Oh, back in the days of Jesus. Here was the kingdom of God, he come to die so he can give us his life, give us the Holy Ghost, change and transform us, redeem us, all the things that you know that he came to do. And here he was on earth. And they say, "Master, tell us. Show us a sign. [Music] Show us a sign when the kingdom's coming." You know, people, show us a great preacher. Show us a great camp meeting. Show us a great movement of God in this message. Show us a sign. And we'll believe that the kingdom is here. Some believe in Brother Brandham's coming back. All kinds of beliefs out there. He has to ride the trail again. Show us a sign that the kingdom is here. [Music] But Jesus said to him, "The kingdom has come. Behold, your eyes are seeing the kingdom of God." Hallelujah. The word of God tonight is saying the same thing. Behold, the kingdom is here. This inside of you, this new birth inside of you, this experiences that you got with God all these years, this voice that's been speaking to you, leading you to the word, leading to who you are, is the kingdom of God inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold, the kingdom has come. My brothers and sisters, the time is coming. The time is at hand. Man ain't going to do it, but God is going to do it. What he's been putting inside of her, the true bride, all these years. Amen. what he's been quickening inside of her, he's going to bring it to full maturity very soon. Hallelujah. Very soon, things in your life, you're going to overcome. Very soon, things are going to drop off of you. Very soon, deliverances that you need, changes that you need are going to come &gt;&gt; because that's his promise. That's his word in this hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not all has been fulfilled yet, but there's still a great move of God that's going to take place to fulfill all what he has spoken through a prophet in these days. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Behold, the kingdom is here. &gt;&gt; The kingdom has come within men. Hallelujah. And when you behold that the kingdom is inside of you, let the kingdom come. Let thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give me this day. Give me this day my revelation. Give me the word of God. My portion, Lord. [Music] So now I can speak his word and become that full manifestation. Amen. If this is not what this is all about, my brothers and sisters, then what is it about? This is what it's all about. The token must be on display. The life of Christ must deny. He can't lie. And God has spoken it. He can't lie. There's going to be a bride. There's going to be one without spot or wrinkle. There's going to be an overcomer that's going to overcome everything. I'm going to overcome everything. You're going to overcome everything. Everything that Satan puts before you. Everything that the word of God is inside of you, anything gets in the way of that, you're going to overcome it. You're going to be victorious. Unbelief never hinders God and never will hinder God. But I have spoken it. I will perform it, sayeth the Lord. Father, bless your word to your people, Lord. Only you can reveal these things. Father, the kingdom has come. God and man are one and the same. Again, the bride and the bridegroom are one and the same. Again, I believe the message, Father, not because I can read it or I can quote it. I believe the message inside the message. There's a message inside of it for the bride of Jesus Christ. And that message is directly from you to her. [Music] You to her. I love you. I've called you. You're mine. Bless each and everyone. Each one that would hear online. Father, if we need to repent, we got any of these spirits on us. Father, you said, Lord, in my name, you'll cast out devils. Father, let everyone leave. Every son and daughter of God be set free by the blood of Jesus Christ tonight. Have your way in each heart, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. God bless you, saints. I work. His word is working mightily in me. His word is working mightily in me. [Music] No matter what the circumstances, what I feel, his word is working mightily in me. Oh, his word is working mightily mightily. His words working mightily in me. No matter what the circumstances, what I feel, I'll see. His word is working mighty. His word is working mightily in me. His word is working. [Music] I feel his words working mightily. Hallelujah. How many enjoy that tonight? Kingdom of God is in us. Amen. You are dismissed. [Music] Yeah. Thy word have thy hidden in my heart. Thy word have thy hidden in my heart. Thy word has thou hidden in my heart that I might not sin against thee. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my heart's way. Thy word hast thou hidden in my heart. Thy word has thou hidden in my heart. Thy word have I hidden in my heart that I might not sin against thee. Thy word is a lamp onto my feet. Thy word is a lamp onto my feet. Thy word is a lamp onto my feet. And a light [Music]
