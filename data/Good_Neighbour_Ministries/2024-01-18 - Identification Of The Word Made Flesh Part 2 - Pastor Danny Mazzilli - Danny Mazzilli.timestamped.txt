[22:00] the situations that we're facing on a
[22:02] daily basis amen praise God and so
[22:05] tonight we're going to be looking um
[22:07] we're going to be continuing along the
[22:09] um the thought of seeing my part in the
[22:12] word of God we want to we want to know
[22:15] we want to see we want to recognize what
[22:17] God is doing in this day and in this
[22:19] hour and it's one thing you know like
[22:22] when Jesus was on Earth he was causing a
[22:24] disturbance and a lot of people had
[22:26] recognized that um something was
[22:28] happening that there was a a disturbance
[22:31] they they couldn't quite understand what
[22:33] it was but those that became a part of
[22:37] the revelation of Jesus Christ in that
[22:40] day recognized that they were actually
[22:43] in fulfillment of Prophecy and it brings
[22:46] a a tremendous amount of Faith to the
[22:49] individual when they can see that
[22:51] they're actually a part of it right from
[22:53] the one that was you know on the side of
[22:55] the road crying out son of David have
[22:57] mercy mercy on me when he cried out from
[22:59] the side of the road he didn't realize
[23:01] that that he was going to actually
[23:03] fulfill the word of God in his day that
[23:06] he was going to identify himself as part
[23:09] of the word of God that that Jesus
[23:11] Christ the Messiah was going to be right
[23:15] there speaking to him and raising him
[23:18] from his blindness amen and he fulfilled
[23:22] prophecy he fulfilled the prophecy that
[23:24] God was a Healer that he was the Messiah
[23:27] that he was you know when Lazarus was
[23:29] raised from the dead he was showing that
[23:31] he was the resurrection amen praise God
[23:34] and so tonight we're going to be looking

[23:40] slide of seeing our part in the word of
[23:42] God identification of the word made
[23:45] flesh that's what we're looking at the
[23:48] identification of the word made flesh

[26:09] power of darkness and hath translated us
[26:13] into the kingdom of his dear son in whom
[26:17] we have Redemption through his blood
[26:20] even the Forgiveness of sins just in
[26:22] that first paragraph the whole Plan of
[26:25] Redemption the whole thing about you
[26:27] being a part of it the whole aspect that
[26:30] that not only are you a part of it but
[26:31] you're you're you're washed you're
[26:33] forgiven you're cleansed by the word of
[26:35] God the blood of Jesus Christ amen who
[26:39] is the invisible who is the image of the
[26:43] invisible God the firstborn of every
[26:46] creature Jesus Christ was God the word
[26:50] made flesh the invisible became visible
[26:54] in Jesus Christ amen praise God and he's
[26:57] visible tonight if you've received that
[27:00] spirit in you which is his Spirit the
[27:03] holy spirit amen for by him were all
[27:06] things created that are in heaven and
[27:09] that are in Earth visible and invisible
[27:12] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[27:15] principalities or Powers all things were
[27:18] created by Him and for him
[27:22] Amen period amen hallelujah there's no
[27:26] other God there's only one God and it's
[27:29] right there it is clear and and and
[27:32] precise all principalities all dominions
[27:36] listen there's no other God you know
[27:38] they said oh there's God the Father in
[27:40] Heaven Christ the son on earth and the
[27:42] Holy Spirit the power of God it's all
[27:45] him amen praise God we need to we need
[27:48] to see this clear a praise God Amen
[27:51] there's no other Throne there's no other
[27:53] Dominion everything was created all
[27:56] things were created by him and for him
[28:00] all things you me we were created for
[28:04] him listen here and he before all things
[28:09] and by him all things consist so
[28:13] everything operates by his Spirit that's
[28:16] what we're going to be looking at
[28:17] tonight we're looking at the word made
[28:20] flesh identification of the word amen
[28:23] praise God and he is the head of the the
[28:27] body the church now he's talking about
[28:30] you and me amen who is the beginning the
[28:34] first born from the dead that in all
[28:38] things he might have the preeminence for
[28:41] it pleased the father that in him should
[28:45] all a l l fullness dwell praise God you
[28:52] may be seated Hallelujah wow what a what
[28:56] a tremendous scripture you know know
[28:57] brother brandham read this scripture and
[28:59] a lot of the quotes that we're going to
[29:00] be looking at in the in this whole study
[29:03] you know a lot of it if you get a chance
[29:05] go back and listen to Christ the mystery
[29:07] of God revealed go back read it you know
[29:10] just it's all there's a lot that's being
[29:12] drawn from that amen because um in there
[29:16] is a whole you know brother Braham said
[29:18] if there's one message that he preached
[29:20] that was so inspired it was that message
[29:23] there because he says it basically
[29:26] encompasses the whole whole plan of God
[29:29] and everything that that that God had in
[29:31] his mind from before the foundations of
[29:33] the world he was going to manifest
[29:36] through this Christ being the mystery of
[29:40] God revealed it's always been Christ
[29:44] everything was Christ from the very
[29:46] beginning right back from the Garden of
[29:48] Eden right back when the word said in
[29:50] the beginning the word amen in the
[29:52] beginning God in the beginning the
[29:55] self-existent one Elohim
[29:58] the the alpha the Omega everything was
[30:00] surrounding him he's the beginning he's
[30:03] the end he's in all through all and he's
[30:06] fulfilling all for his purpose for his
[30:08] glory and for his honor that's the thing
[30:12] that the modern world out there and the
[30:16] teachings that they have and all the
[30:18] interpretations that they're trying to
[30:20] place on their purpose their existence
[30:24] the Creator uh the universe can't they
[30:28] can't come to a full understanding
[30:30] because until they come to the to the
[30:33] humility of recognizing that there is an
[30:36] almighty God a self-existent one yes we
[30:41] are a part of that you know we were
[30:44] fellowshipping on that um yesterday or
[30:46] this morning my wife and I we were
[30:48] talking about how this generation
[30:51] there's so much teaching and and people
[30:54] are looking to identify them themselves
[30:58] and trying to find their identity they
[31:00] want to know why they're in these bodies
[31:03] they they they realize that there's
[31:04] something Beyond this Dimension but they
[31:07] can't figure it out because what they're
[31:09] trying to do is they're trying to to
[31:13] identify and and uh figure it out by
[31:17] their own understanding by their own
[31:20] scientific knowledge or or uh by their
[31:23] own intelligence they think that they
[31:25] can figure out God
[31:27] how can the
[31:29] creation figure out the
[31:32] Creator but how we've been so blessed is
[31:35] that we've been we've been uh given the
[31:38] ability to recognize that we are
[31:41] actually in God Amen and that element
[31:45] and that Revelation is what brings our
[31:49] identity our
[31:51] purpose God's plan everything that he
[31:55] had in his mind and everything that he
[31:57] wanted to to to express in the purpose
[32:00] of the whole creation all the earth and
[32:03] the wars and the and and the and the
[32:05] pestilence and the sickness everybody's
[32:07] trying to figure all these things out
[32:10] but unless the spirit of God goes in you
[32:15] and allows you to contact his mind and
[32:20] come into Unity of his spirit and allow
[32:24] his Revelation his mind to be expressed
[32:27] to you there's no way you can possibly
[32:30] figure it out I don't care how many
[32:32] theories you come up with how many
[32:35] different yeah the word says there's
[32:37] that the worlds were framed by the word
[32:39] of God worlds so there could have been
[32:43] many other civilizations before us but
[32:46] like we've said before that's got
[32:48] nothing to do with us amen other than
[32:51] the same pattern or potentially
[32:54] recognizing what God did in in the past
[32:58] you know in in his in his um revelation
[33:01] of himself and what he reveals to us we
[33:04] can only know what he reveals to us we
[33:08] we become more in tune with God as we
[33:11] surrender our human Pride our human you
[33:16] know desire to be like God remember that
[33:19] was the cause of the Fall people wanted
[33:22] to be like God but they didn't want to
[33:24] come under submission to God Amen
[33:27] be being able to come under submission
[33:30] fully to God shows that you are a part
[33:32] of God because you cannot sin in other
[33:36] words you cannot disbelieve God an
[33:38] attribute of God cannot rebel against
[33:41] God Amen because God God is Not
[33:45] divided that's why a kingdom that's
[33:48] divided it's going to it's going to beat
[33:50] itself up it's going to fight it's going
[33:52] to argue that that's why you know man
[33:55] finds themselves in war war and because
[33:58] of their pride no I know more I know
[34:01] more I I have a higher understanding
[34:03] than you so that makes me greater than
[34:06] you no no I know what God has allowed me
[34:09] to
[34:10] know what and and and the more that I
[34:13] surrender to the Lord the more that I
[34:15] give myself over to the spirit and the
[34:17] anointing of the Holy Spirit the more
[34:20] that I become one the more that I can
[34:22] that I can be like him I can recognize
[34:25] what the word says about me because I'm
[34:28] in the word because now I'm identifying
[34:31] with the word it is my supreme authority
[34:34] it's my
[34:36] absolute I'm not making myself my my own
[34:39] absolute and that's what the that's what
[34:41] this new age thinking and and teaching
[34:44] is trying to do like hey you
[34:47] are everything you can become like God
[34:53] that's what Satan tried to sell Eve in
[34:55] the Garden of Eden and that's what
[34:57] caused the fall it's because he went to
[35:00] her and says no no no no have God said
[35:03] that you can't eat of this tree you
[35:06] can't you you can't partake of the
[35:08] knowledge that I have he knew exactly
[35:11] what God had said the serpent but he
[35:14] went and he deceived Eve in the Garden
[35:17] of Eden but what we're going to see
[35:20] through this study as we continue
[35:23] through it we're going to recognize that
[35:26] this Eve
[35:27] which is the bride for this hour which
[35:29] is the you know when when we talk about
[35:31] the church remember the church is the
[35:35] bride of Christ the true church is the
[35:39] bride of Christ but this church in this
[35:43] age in the final stages of the end time
[35:49] will not be deceived this eve will allow
[35:53] him to have the full preeminence amen
[35:56] praise God God
[35:58] hallelujah so um let's go to the next
[36:01] Slide the next slide and this is where
[36:03] we're going to be we're going to be
[36:05] looking at things here this is where we
[36:06] left off last time and I said okay this
[36:09] is where it starts to get really good
[36:11] and I was excited because I realized
[36:13] okay here's where it starts to really
[36:15] you know um pour out and the Holy Spirit
[36:17] was just pouring out you know when as I
[36:20] was reading these quotes and reading
[36:22] this these Scriptures it says in Romans
[36:24] chap 8:1 but if this if the spirit of
[36:27] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[36:31] dwell in you he that raised up Christ
[36:35] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[36:39] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[36:43] dwelleth in
[36:45] you now we need to we need to look at
[36:47] this scripture and we need to see it
[36:50] exactly the way it
[36:52] says but
[36:55] if if
[36:57] the spirit dwell in you you see that's
[37:00] the difference it's not in
[37:04] everybody and that's why people will
[37:06] read this scripture and they'll
[37:09] automatically you know assume that the
[37:11] spirit of Christ is in them but remember
[37:13] the spirit of Jesus Christ which is
[37:18] himself can never go against his own
[37:21] word amen it'll never deny his own word
[37:25] the minute that that that you speak to
[37:27] somebody and they turn around and you
[37:29] say to them well praise God brother you
[37:31] know and they they say to you I'm a
[37:33] Christian she says to you I'm a
[37:35] Christian praise the Lord and you know
[37:37] you you just like Paul in Acts 19
[37:40] Paul came across a bunch of disciples
[37:43] and they were the disciples of Christ
[37:45] because they were preaching the word
[37:48] they were excited about Jesus Christ
[37:50] they were talking about John the Baptist
[37:52] they were excited about you know they
[37:53] had recognized that that God had sent a
[37:57] a a forerunner God had sent a prophet
[37:59] amen praise God you could talk to people
[38:02] in this message and they'll tell you
[38:03] Amen brother God sent us William Mary
[38:05] and brandom praise God hallelujah he
[38:08] sent us the prophet and then you talk to
[38:10] some of them and you know and then and
[38:13] then Paul goes to them so so how are you
[38:16] baptized they said well we were baptized
[38:19] by John the
[38:21] Baptist just like some people today you
[38:24] know that there's people that are that
[38:25] are baptizing in the name of William
[38:27] Branham oh yes there's a movement of
[38:31] people that are baptizing in the name of
[38:33] William brandham not in the name of
[38:35] Jesus Christ okay but Paul told those
[38:39] disciples no no no you need to be
[38:41] re-baptized amen you need to be baptized
[38:45] in the name of the
[38:47] bridegroom Jesus
[38:49] Christ The Mighty God the one who came
[38:53] the Messiah and his name was Jesus
[38:55] Christ you need to be baptized and and
[38:58] you read the scripture they all had to
[39:01] be re-baptized they were all re-baptized
[39:03] and the Bible said the spirit of God
[39:06] Came Upon them why because they
[39:08] recognized the word they were willing to
[39:11] submit to the word and they expressed
[39:14] and manifested the
[39:16] word that's what we're talking about so
[39:19] how do we know that that that somebody
[39:21] is a true Christian not to say oh
[39:25] because they were baptized that saves
[39:27] them no there is a revelation in them
[39:31] and the spirit of God comes upon their
[39:33] lives and it begins to manifest
[39:36] supernaturally to where they recognize
[39:39] all the word and they start saying Amen
[39:42] to all the word not just a portion of
[39:45] the word amen praise God listen these
[39:49] are simple things and I know that you
[39:50] know you've heard them many times praise
[39:53] God but I'm not here you know the Lord
[39:56] has shown me that we're not to be here
[39:59] preaching all the high Mysteries of the
[40:01] word and getting into the Book of
[40:03] Revelations and the seventh seal and
[40:06] yeah we're going to cover all those
[40:08] things but Jesus said feed my sheep he
[40:12] also said feed my
[40:14] Lambs there are people that need to come
[40:18] under the the the Simplicity of this
[40:20] word those that are listening in and
[40:22] those that are visiting and those that
[40:24] are young amongst us that they've been
[40:26] found the message for many many years
[40:28] but yet they need to come into a
[40:30] supernatural personal revelation because
[40:33] some people will have heard these
[40:35] doctrines of that God is one and that
[40:38] you know that that that there's no other
[40:40] God and this and that but one day all of
[40:42] a sudden Boom the lights come on and
[40:45] they get the Revelation like they've
[40:47] never seen it before it lights up inside
[40:50] of them and it immediately takes them
[40:52] into a different walk where this Bible
[40:55] becomes a whole new Bible
[40:57] they can't wait to feed on it and every
[40:59] time they're feeding on it they're
[41:00] getting oh my gosh look at that I never
[41:02] saw that oh praise God I didn't see that
[41:05] oh Hallelujah that's me you know all of
[41:07] a sudden the word becomes alive amen
[41:10] praise God that's that's the that's what
[41:13] we're looking here at that if the same
[41:17] spirit that if the spirit of him that
[41:20] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[41:24] you it'll Quicken you
[41:27] it'll Quicken your body it'll Quicken
[41:30] your thoughts it'll Quicken your ability
[41:32] to recognize the word amen praise God
[41:35] Amen so um you know sometimes people
[41:39] will will will look at this scripture
[41:41] and they're not
[41:42] realizing um that the real Spirit here
[41:46] we're not talking about just a a
[41:48] Christian Spirit you know like
[41:51] denominational you know oh yes praise
[41:54] the Lord hallelujah you know they'll
[41:55] they'll say it like that no the real
[41:57] spirit this is God this is God himself
[42:01] coming into the individual changing
[42:03] their lives transforming their lives the
[42:06] moment that this becomes a reality to
[42:08] them they can never be the
[42:10] same you have a real experience with God
[42:13] Amen praise God and so it it's we don't
[42:17] have some watered down version here when
[42:19] we read the scripture we have the real
[42:21] original it's Jesus Christ the same
[42:24] yesterday today and forever it's the
[42:26] holy spirit it's the quickening power
[42:29] it's resurrection power in US praise God
[42:33] hallelujah First Corinthians chapter 12
[42:36] it says but all these worketh that one
[42:40] and the same self self Same Spirit
[42:44] dividing to every man severly as he will
[42:48] that's that's God working in the body of
[42:50] Christ it's the same spirit amen it's
[42:54] always the Holy Ghost it's the
[42:56] Supernatural anointing that's
[42:58] positionally placing everyone into their
[43:00] positions and they are fulfilling the
[43:03] word of God by
[43:05] Revelation by an understanding of who
[43:08] they are they don't just play the piano
[43:10] there and you know the keys are just
[43:13] Keys there's an anointing that's going
[43:16] through their lives because of the
[43:18] anointing because of the Revelation that
[43:20] they have on the word of God and it
[43:22] flows through the keys it flows through
[43:25] the guitar it flows through the drums it
[43:28] flows through the singers through the
[43:30] trumpets that's the supernatural sound
[43:33] that we're looking
[43:34] for that's what pleases God not just
[43:38] your your natural ability God's looking
[43:41] at the consecration behind your
[43:44] ability is it his Spirit that's
[43:46] operating in you and through you when
[43:49] you play the guitar is it his Spirit
[43:52] that's operating through you when you
[43:54] sing are you are you singing because you
[43:57] want to be heard or are you singing
[43:59] because you want to give glory to God
[44:02] because when you do it to give him glory
[44:04] it blesses the whole body it sends an
[44:07] anointing through the whole church into
[44:09] anybody that hears that song see it's
[44:12] the selfsame spirit hallelujah we're
[44:17] just laid in a foundation here Genesis 1
[44:19] the spirit of God moved on the face of
[44:22] the waters and this is listen this was
[44:25] the spirit of
[44:27] creation that whatever he said obeyed
[44:31] him that's the spirit that you receive
[44:34] when you receive the Holy Ghost you're
[44:37] not just receiving some you know people
[44:39] go into the water and they think oh I
[44:41] got baptized Hallelujah I went in I got
[44:43] buried in the water I came out of the
[44:45] water and now I got the Holy
[44:47] Ghost no no when when when it happens
[44:50] listen I remember the day that I got
[44:53] baptized when I came out of that water I
[44:55] knew knew that something Supernatural
[44:58] had taken place in my life I could not
[45:00] explain it but I knew that that that I
[45:03] that I was just
[45:05] purged there was no more desire for that
[45:09] for that for that addiction of the drug
[45:10] I I can't explain to you but you know
[45:14] the only example that I can give to you
[45:16] of how to explain it is like going to
[45:19] somebody that's never smoked a cigarette
[45:21] in their life and putting a cigarette to
[45:23] their mouth and saying here smoke it
[45:26] they're going to go what get away from
[45:29] me I don't want this I don't even know
[45:31] what it is I got no desire for it
[45:35] because when God does something when he
[45:37] removes the desire when he removes the
[45:40] heartache when he removes the sickness
[45:43] when he removes the oppression the
[45:45] depression you are never the same you
[45:48] are made whole listen you look back when
[45:51] Jesus Christ was on the earth when when
[45:53] blind barus was blind as a bat and he
[45:56] went up before Jesus and his eyes were
[45:58] open all the Pharisees and the priests
[46:01] and everything were questioning him
[46:03] asking him what what's this how did this
[46:05] happen he says listen I don't know how
[46:09] it
[46:10] happened but all I know is everything
[46:13] that you've taught me and everything
[46:15] that you've showed me about the Messiah
[46:18] it never brought this kind of a result
[46:20] in my life amen and all I know is that
[46:23] that man Jesus Christ is not just a
[46:26] normal man that is God hallelujah
[46:29] because only God could do what he did in
[46:32] my life and when you have that kind of
[46:34] an experience you're never going to be
[46:36] the same am you're going to be a living
[46:38] walking testimony of Jesus Christ you're
[46:42] life is going to be alive and well and
[46:44] and and different you you're never going
[46:46] to be able to fit into the world anymore
[46:48] like you used to I'm just telling you
[46:50] that's just the way it is you're never
[46:52] going to fit like you used to with your
[46:55] friends with your family yes you still
[46:57] have to have friends you still need to
[46:59] love your friends you still need to love
[47:01] your family you still need to be in this
[47:03] we're in this
[47:05] world but we're not of it we've come to
[47:07] a realization that hey I'm just passing
[47:10] through here I came into this Dimension
[47:13] I went into some spiritual Amnesia being
[47:15] born you know the son or the daughter of
[47:18] Mr and Mrs so and so but then I had an
[47:20] Awakening then I had somebody that
[47:23] turned on the lights amen praise God you
[47:25] hear about people saying I've had an
[47:27] experience uh you know I I've seen the
[47:29] light amen no it's not that you've seen
[47:32] the light it's God placed his light on
[47:34] you and awoke you out of your Darkness
[47:38] like we we've read in the scripture we
[47:39] were all in darkness and everybody out
[47:42] there I don't care who they are unless
[47:44] they come to the revelation of who God
[47:47] actually is they're living in light
[47:50] naturally but they're in spiritual
[47:52] Darkness until God opens the
[47:55] understanding Jesus said I open no man
[47:58] can shut I shut no man can
[48:03] open that's all part of the Paradox
[48:06] second Peter you know so now we see in
[48:09] Genesis we've got creative power that
[48:11] lives within us the holy spirit is is is
[48:14] the is the spirit of creation amen
[48:16] praise God hallelujah no other power no
[48:19] greater power second Peter 1:20 2
[48:23] Timothy 3:16 And1 17 we have we have in
[48:26] these two verses the statement that the
[48:28] entire word of God was given by
[48:32] inspiration of the spirit of God so
[48:36] every inspiration every teaching every
[48:40] Revelation and understanding of who we
[48:43] are who God is comes by the spirit it
[48:48] doesn't come by your own intellect amen
[48:50] it doesn't come by your own sacrifice oh
[48:54] I'm going to go to school I'm going to
[48:56] get my PhD lldd GGG Doctorate of this
[49:00] and Doctorate of divinity I don't care
[49:02] how many letters are after your name
[49:04] there are many people like that in this
[49:06] world and they are so spiritually blind
[49:10] that they actually say there is no
[49:13] God you can't get any more blind than
[49:16] that to where you are an atheist when
[49:18] somebody says I'm an atheist I said
[49:22] wow they don't even believe that there's
[49:24] anything else there they all they
[49:26] believe is they're living they're going
[49:28] to go six feet underground and the
[49:29] party's over so I'm going to party as
[49:31] much as I
[49:32] can well you know what that's as good as
[49:35] it gets for them so they might as well
[49:38] party and enjoy their life like the
[49:40] scripture says if there's no salvation
[49:42] and there's nothing Beyond this then
[49:44] praise God they ain't going to say
[49:45] praise God they're just going to say
[49:47] praise the devil I'm going to live for
[49:49] him and I'm going to do everything that
[49:51] I possibly can because I'm going six
[49:53] feet under and that's the end of me and
[49:55] that's that's possible because not every
[49:59] soul is going back to God some have a
[50:03] beginning they will have an end yeah
[50:05] just like animals they have they live by
[50:08] the spirit of God everything lives by
[50:10] the spirit of God he is life but some
[50:13] have an
[50:16] eternal uh uh
[50:18] identity because they come directly from
[50:21] God but some are just spoken and created
[50:25] for a purpose and for a time and for a
[50:29] season and they'll bring forth after
[50:31] their own kind every seed will bring of
[50:34] its own kind
[50:37] fishes rabbits whatever animal life it
[50:41] is it'll bring forth of its own kind but
[50:44] God's Own Kind when God said let us make
[50:46] man in our image he was talking about
[50:50] himself with his attributes the Sons and
[50:52] Daughters of God he said now we're going
[50:54] to create our own image and we're gonna
[50:57] we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna put
[50:59] it into human bodies for a season until
[51:03] they come out of their spiritual Amnesia
[51:05] and recognize who they really are and
[51:07] then they'll recognize that they are
[51:10] actually
[51:12] Gods Not not capital g o that we're that
[51:16] we are that we are God but that we are
[51:20] attributes of God humans bring forth
[51:23] other humans God Express expresses God's
[51:28] expresses aspects of himself of himself
[51:31] that's what we're looking at here amen
[51:33] and so everything's by inspiration we
[51:35] need the spirit of God working in our
[51:37] lives if we're to receive any kind of
[51:39] revelation of who we really are and who
[51:42] he really is so it's through that
[51:44] Supernatural spirit that raised Christ
[51:47] from the dead amen H Allelujah glory to
[51:51] God 1 Corinthians chapter 4 Corinthians
[51:54] 12:7 to 11 the demonstrations and
[51:57] manifestations of the spirit that rested
[52:00] on Paul Peter Phillip John listen all
[52:05] those you know when when when when Paul
[52:07] said you know I don't come to you with
[52:10] enticing words but I come to you in the
[52:12] power of the Holy Spirit he realized
[52:16] that it was not his own Revelation it
[52:19] was God revealing himself through Paul
[52:23] it was it was God manifesting through
[52:26] Paul when we look at the book of Acts we
[52:29] see that it is not the Acts of the
[52:31] Apostles like some people want to think
[52:35] it's actually the acts of the spirit
[52:38] through the
[52:39] apostles the book of Acts is the
[52:43] manifestation of God being made flesh
[52:47] through the apostles and the
[52:50] disciples now acts goes to chapter 28 a
[52:54] lot of lot of people ask me and say well
[52:56] Danny you know what is your church what
[52:59] is it that you believe I tell them
[53:01] listen we don't have um you know some
[53:04] sort of Homebase you know
[53:08] foundation and uh doctrinal uh
[53:11] encyclopedia or anything we don't have
[53:13] any catechisms we don't have anything
[53:16] that our catechism is the word of
[53:19] God our Bible our our absolute is the
[53:22] word of God yeah but what is it that
[53:25] your you know what does your church
[53:27] teach we teach the word of
[53:30] God if the book of Acts I say listen
[53:32] read the book of Acts I tell people read
[53:34] the book of Acts it's not the acts of
[53:37] the people that you're actually
[53:39] witnessing when you read that it's the
[53:41] spirit of God in those people well the
[53:44] book of Acts if there was a chapter 29
[53:47] we'd be in that
[53:49] chapter because the word is progressing
[53:52] the the word is moving on and the word
[53:55] is is the same yesterday today and
[53:56] forever and so if you want to know what
[53:58] our church is like read the book of Acts
[54:02] exactly what you see there you're going
[54:04] to see here amen because he's the same
[54:07] Jesus Christ yesterday today right now
[54:11] and forever he doesn't change that's why
[54:14] we can trust him all the other
[54:16] denominations and all the other churches
[54:19] and stuff like that and I'm not saying
[54:21] all of them but I'm saying the ones that
[54:22] have taken their own doctrines
[54:26] their own catechisms their own teachings
[54:29] and they'll tell you that no no no no
[54:31] you don't have to listen to the word you
[54:33] got to listen to me you man's teachings
[54:37] the moment that man's teachings
[54:39] supersede God's teachings they make the
[54:43] word of God of none effect to the people
[54:46] and it cannot have the effect in the
[54:48] individual life because Jesus Christ
[54:51] himself said he that worships me must
[54:55] Worship in
[54:56] spirit and in truth so it's got to be by
[55:00] the spirit that leads you to the truth
[55:03] and when you've got both of them
[55:05] together and you worship God then you're
[55:07] actually you're it's the Deep call to
[55:10] the Deep it's the mind of
[55:12] Christ in you now and it pleases God
[55:16] like the scripture says without faith
[55:19] that word faith is
[55:21] revelation without Revelation you can't
[55:24] pleas God because you're you're you're
[55:27] you're you're giving God your own
[55:29] interpretation that's what I was saying
[55:30] earlier people want to figure out the
[55:33] universe why they exist and how they can
[55:36] manipulate their own lives in a way that
[55:39] they can feel like they're in control
[55:42] meanwhile it's God that gives you
[55:44] overcoming power it's God that gives you
[55:47] uh peace it's God that heals your body
[55:51] not you trying to will your healing or
[55:53] trying to figure out scientific ific Al
[55:55] how to take the best people spend hours
[55:58] and hours trying to figure out oh this
[56:00] this is the best this is what I got to
[56:02] take I got to take this vitamin that you
[56:03] go into some people's houses and you
[56:05] open their their cabinets they've got
[56:07] the whole Pharmacy in there they don't
[56:10] know which vitamin to take
[56:14] anymore my gosh because you know but
[56:18] that's normal that like that's just
[56:20] human nature right I do it all the time
[56:22] too I'm looking for something that's
[56:23] because we do need to be aware that
[56:26] there are herbs and and and vitamins
[56:28] that we need to place in our body and
[56:30] it's good and I do take them and they do
[56:32] have an effect and they've been helping
[56:34] me for years so I'm not I'm not saying
[56:36] that we don't need them but we need to
[56:38] put our faith in the right
[56:41] place Hallelujah he's still the Lord God
[56:44] that heals our bodies amen praise God
[56:48] Amen so so if you want to know what
[56:51] church what we represent then you need
[56:54] to re recognize and read the book of
[56:56] Acts we are a continuation of the book
[57:01] of Acts and it's the spirit of God
[57:03] that's moving and dwelling in us
[57:06] hallelujah so because of that Spirit we
[57:10] have authority amen praise God the
[57:13] spirit working in our lives like Paul
[57:15] said in Galatians 1 I certify you
[57:18] Brethren the gospel I preach was not
[57:21] after man but by the revelation of Jesus
[57:23] Christ and so our Authority does not
[57:26] hang on a
[57:27] wall I'm a doctor PhD lld doctor of
[57:32] divinity and that's why I can be the
[57:34] preacher and I can be a pastor listen I
[57:37] got none of those
[57:39] degrees none I didn't go to theology
[57:43] school the only school that I know is
[57:46] neology I get on my knees and I humble
[57:49] myself before God and I say Lord I can't
[57:51] I can't preach I need your anointing I I
[57:54] need your spirit I need you to come and
[57:57] feed the people and and and feed your
[57:59] lambs and feed your sheep but I believe
[58:02] in your spirit and I receive your spirit
[58:05] and I give you this vessel so that you
[58:07] can use this vessel to feed your
[58:10] people and that is what look at the
[58:13] disciples look at all the apostles they
[58:16] were unlearned men they were not people
[58:18] that had El listen Paul was a theologian
[58:20] of theologians okay but even Paul God
[58:24] had to knock him off his high horse
[58:26] because he thought he knew too much to
[58:28] the point where he didn't even know God
[58:30] and he was killing the spirit of God in
[58:33] individuals because that's why when
[58:35] Jesus knocked him off his horse on his
[58:37] road to
[58:38] aass Paul said who art thou Lord he knew
[58:41] it was God because only God could do
[58:43] that supernaturally knock him off his
[58:45] horse and and and and blind him like
[58:47] that he says who art thou Lord because
[58:50] the the spirit said why are you
[58:52] persecuting me Paul he says what do you
[58:54] mean who are you he says it is me
[58:57] Jesus and he had to throw out everything
[59:01] that he thought that he believed God had
[59:03] to take him for three and a half years
[59:05] into the Wilderness and take out all the
[59:07] theological teaching and all his his own
[59:11] interpretation he he says I count it all
[59:13] as
[59:14] dung hallelujah praise God you can be a
[59:18] theologian of theologians but until God
[59:20] knocks you off your high horse and
[59:22] allows his anointing and his Spirit to
[59:24] come upon you to recognize the word of
[59:26] God you are you you you will have
[59:30] nothing to give to the people you can
[59:33] give a nice sermon you can preach a nice
[59:35] sermon you can tie the the scriptures
[59:38] and all the types together but it is the
[59:40] letter that kth but it is the spirit
[59:43] that gives it
[59:44] life and that's what we're talking about
[59:47] tonight you need the Holy Spirit you
[59:49] need the spirit of God to interpret the
[59:52] word to preach the word and to make the
[59:55] word of any
[59:56] effect on anybody including yourself
[1:00:00] amen hallelujah Isaiah 59 it says in
[1:00:05] verse 19 that the Lord will raise a
[1:00:08] standard by his spirit so if you want to
[1:00:12] see things change in your life when you
[1:00:14] see the enemy attacking when you see the
[1:00:17] enemy coming in like a flood you know
[1:00:19] sometimes we find ourselves in
[1:00:21] circumstances and situations bombarded
[1:00:23] in our minds oppressed by the by by by
[1:00:27] the age and by all the things that we
[1:00:28] need to do sometimes uh listen Saints
[1:00:31] we're all human sometimes we get
[1:00:33] overwhelmed by the things of This World
[1:00:35] by the things of this life by bills that
[1:00:38] we got to pay by people that we got to
[1:00:40] take care of you know by seeing people
[1:00:42] you know sometimes you see people on the
[1:00:44] side of the road and and they're and
[1:00:46] they're and they and and they're
[1:00:47] freezing and and you know you want to do
[1:00:49] something and and you feel their pain
[1:00:51] you can't help it it's torment sometimes
[1:00:54] you see these situations and and you
[1:00:56] just wonder but it's all you know like
[1:00:58] it's just the grace of God but then God
[1:01:01] will come in and he will raise a
[1:01:03] standard how by his spirit so how can
[1:01:07] you deny his spirit and expect to have
[1:01:10] overcoming power in your life how you
[1:01:12] going to be of any good to anybody if
[1:01:15] you're not willing to accept humbly and
[1:01:18] let your pride just fall to the ground
[1:01:21] and receive the spirit of God in the way
[1:01:23] that he wants to give it not the way
[1:01:25] that you think it has to be people get
[1:01:28] so like like like we said on Sunday you
[1:01:32] know cognitive
[1:01:35] dissonance powerful Saints when I saw
[1:01:39] that I said oh my gosh people become so
[1:01:42] entrenched into what they believe and
[1:01:45] what they've been taught to the point
[1:01:47] that when the truth is actually brought
[1:01:49] right into their face clear written
[1:01:52] right there in the word of God clear as
[1:01:53] a bell
[1:01:55] they will they will do everything to
[1:01:57] deny it because it it because it
[1:01:59] threatens them they feel threatened that
[1:02:01] they were wrong what's wrong with being
[1:02:04] wrong that's why the Bible said
[1:02:08] repent why do we need to repent because
[1:02:11] we're
[1:02:13] wrong there's only listen you need to
[1:02:16] repent because there's something wrong
[1:02:18] otherwise why would you need to repent
[1:02:20] and then be baptized in the name of the
[1:02:22] Lord Jesus Christ in other words receive
[1:02:24] God's spirit listen a husband when when
[1:02:27] when a husband takes a wife the wife she
[1:02:30] comes under her husband she she becomes
[1:02:32] one with her husband she realizes that
[1:02:34] he's the stronger
[1:02:36] vessel that he's her protector he can
[1:02:39] provide for her this is the natural
[1:02:42] process you know and there's a lot of
[1:02:44] women out there that are that are that
[1:02:46] are speaking out now and saying you know
[1:02:48] women's Liberation and and and you've
[1:02:50] taken it too far you've taken it to the
[1:02:53] point now where we that we we got to
[1:02:54] fend for ourselves for everything we
[1:02:56] can't even bring up our children and
[1:02:58] nurture them the way that we want to and
[1:03:00] spend the proper time with them because
[1:03:02] there's been so much pressure you know
[1:03:05] for for to to to to make enough and to
[1:03:07] to to work and not you know all these
[1:03:09] pressures that have come down on women
[1:03:12] but God wants to be your husband God
[1:03:15] wants to be your provider God wants to
[1:03:18] be your your your lover he wants to meet
[1:03:21] your needs and and give you what you
[1:03:23] have need of but you need to allow him
[1:03:25] to come you need to allow his Spirit to
[1:03:27] take control amen that's how he raises a
[1:03:31] standard amen Isaiah 10:27 says he
[1:03:34] breaks the Yoke by his
[1:03:37] Spirit not only breaks it the the
[1:03:39] scripture says he destroys it so any
[1:03:42] chain of circumstance that may have been
[1:03:45] on your life any circumstance drug
[1:03:48] addiction any kind of addiction any
[1:03:51] pornography all these things that that
[1:03:54] that take a hold of the people's minds
[1:03:56] these days God can destroy that yoke but
[1:04:00] it can only be done by his Spirit not by
[1:04:02] your own I'm going to go to rehab I'm
[1:04:05] going to quit this I'm going to quit
[1:04:06] that no you need to quit trying to quit
[1:04:09] you need to come to the Lord you need to
[1:04:11] submit yourself to a higher power that
[1:04:14] that that can raise a standard and can
[1:04:16] break the yolks in your life and destroy
[1:04:19] the enemy in your life hallelujah praise
[1:04:23] God people think that they they they
[1:04:24] feel like oh I I can't humble myself no
[1:04:27] I I don't want to be telling people you
[1:04:29] know that that that that Jesus saved me
[1:04:32] that Jesus healed me people people are
[1:04:35] ashamed to even speak the name Jesus
[1:04:39] meanwhile he's the only name whereby man
[1:04:41] must be saved there's no other name that
[1:04:45] man listen in everything that you do in
[1:04:47] word or deed you must do it in the name
[1:04:50] of Jesus Christ otherwise there is no
[1:04:53] salvation
[1:04:56] hallelujah praise God
[1:05:01] Amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah 1
[1:05:04] Corinthians 3:16 the spirit of God
[1:05:06] dwells in your temple we are temples of
[1:05:10] the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah praise
[1:05:13] God let's go to the next slide
[1:05:17] now now notice brother brandom's
[1:05:19] speaking here now he says now notice
[1:05:21] Romans 8:11 now if the spirit of him
[1:05:24] God that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:05:27] dwell in you he that raised up Christ
[1:05:30] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[1:05:33] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:05:36] dwelleth in you now listen what he says
[1:05:38] he says oh my the predestinated
[1:05:42] one of course like the seed laid upon
[1:05:46] the Earth the one that had life in
[1:05:52] them that's why if the spirit dwell in
[1:05:56] you this is where this this really came
[1:05:59] out when I read this quote I said wow
[1:06:01] praise God the predestinated seed the
[1:06:04] one that was prepared not everybody can
[1:06:08] receive God's
[1:06:11] word not everybody's going to be able to
[1:06:13] receive it because everybody that's on
[1:06:16] Earth not everyone has an attribute of
[1:06:21] God that can actually be quickened
[1:06:23] that's that's why Jesus spoke about The
[1:06:25] Parables some seed fell on thorny ground
[1:06:28] some seed fell
[1:06:30] on all the different aspects and he says
[1:06:34] some fell on good
[1:06:36] ground amen praise God this is the
[1:06:39] ground some some fell on on on ground
[1:06:42] and and and it was it had the ability to
[1:06:44] be quickened by the spirit of God I know
[1:06:47] that's tough to handle for some people
[1:06:49] they oh you know so you're just saying
[1:06:51] that you guys only have it and we we
[1:06:53] can't have it no I'm not saying that I'm
[1:06:56] telling you what the word says if the
[1:06:58] word is your absolute then you need to
[1:07:00] find yourself in the word and if you can
[1:07:03] see yourself in the word under that
[1:07:05] predestinated seat of God okay the one
[1:07:08] that that had life in them many of them
[1:07:11] were dead they were just rotten seed the
[1:07:15] waters and things burnt them out but you
[1:07:18] know there was a seed laying there ready
[1:07:21] for life God knowed it was laying there
[1:07:24] now the predestinated ones are the first
[1:07:27] to be
[1:07:28] quickened by the Holy Spirit the Holy
[1:07:32] Spirit comes to claim its own that's why
[1:07:35] Jesus said all that the father hath
[1:07:37] given me all that in other words all
[1:07:40] that I had in my mind before the
[1:07:42] foundations of the world that's the
[1:07:44] father my mind okay they're going to
[1:07:48] come not one of them will be lost that's
[1:07:51] the other beautiful aspect of being a
[1:07:53] Christian and having a rest to know that
[1:07:56] all the Sons and Daughters of God that
[1:07:58] are out there are going to come you
[1:08:01] don't have to try and force anybody to
[1:08:03] come oh you got to come to my church
[1:08:05] that's the only church where you're
[1:08:07] going to find Salvation no you could
[1:08:09] have people come right in here and if
[1:08:12] they don't have any seat in them and
[1:08:13] they have no no election in them from
[1:08:16] before the foundations of the world
[1:08:18] that's not listen that's just scripture
[1:08:20] I'm telling you that's not something
[1:08:21] that I'm I'm I'm you know that's
[1:08:23] something we teach because this is what
[1:08:25] our church teaches no remember
[1:08:27] everything we teach is from the word of
[1:08:29] God everything that that that I'm
[1:08:31] speaking here you can you can ask me and
[1:08:34] I can show you in the word where it is
[1:08:37] then it's up to the spirit of God to
[1:08:38] show you and make it real to you amen
[1:08:41] praise God so everything's by the spirit
[1:08:43] of God and he says and he comes to claim
[1:08:46] its own now this is deep now you see
[1:08:50] it's it's kind of deep But be sure to
[1:08:52] catch this good
[1:08:54] now as the sun was sent across the Earth
[1:08:58] not to bring
[1:09:00] rocks which was dirt also to life it was
[1:09:05] not to bring all the dirt to life but
[1:09:08] was to bring the part of the dirt which
[1:09:10] was enclosed around A Life That's why
[1:09:15] seeds they have dirt around
[1:09:18] them and when the Sun hits that seed
[1:09:21] warms up that warms up that dirt
[1:09:24] the atmosphere for that seed starts to
[1:09:28] germinate and when the light of God's
[1:09:30] word comes onto your human your
[1:09:34] Humanity you're you're you're living in
[1:09:36] this human flesh you were you were born
[1:09:38] into this body you were born under a
[1:09:40] certain mother and father and everything
[1:09:43] else you come through the world speaking
[1:09:45] lies you were born in sin shaped in
[1:09:47] iniquity speaking lies but then when the
[1:09:50] spirit of God and not when we're not
[1:09:52] just talking any Spirit we're we're
[1:09:53] talking about the Holy Spirit remember
[1:09:56] Jesus was the Holy Spirit in his day
[1:09:59] walking on the earth and when he looked
[1:10:01] to Matthew and said
[1:10:04] Matthew come follow me when he spoke to
[1:10:08] Matthew that was not just words coming
[1:10:11] from a man that was actually the spirit
[1:10:13] of God speaking to the seed that was in
[1:10:17] Matthew to say come because this doesn't
[1:10:22] inherit the kingdom of God the ible says
[1:10:24] Flesh and Blood shall not inherit the
[1:10:27] kingdom of God this body needs to be
[1:10:31] quickened it's going to be changed
[1:10:34] remember the scripture says this Mortal
[1:10:36] shall put on
[1:10:38] immortality praise God so understanding
[1:10:41] that now we know that it's not the flesh
[1:10:44] that God is calling he's calling that
[1:10:46] seed amen that election that was there
[1:10:49] from before the foundations of the
[1:10:52] world
[1:10:56] praise God so this is important for us
[1:11:00] to understand next
[1:11:03] slide Not all men will receive
[1:11:07] Christ I'm continuing this is this is
[1:11:10] all from um uh the message I believe
[1:11:13] it's Christ The Mystery of God
[1:11:16] revealed
[1:11:18] uh
[1:11:19] yeah
[1:11:22] okay
[1:11:33] sorry
[1:11:35] okay just let me go back
[1:11:41] here
[1:11:43] okay now he goes on to say here not all
[1:11:46] men will receive
[1:11:48] Christ oh but those which God
[1:11:52] foreordained life
[1:11:55] God foreordained to have life it's not
[1:11:58] everyone is housed around some of the
[1:12:01] dirt of the earth that's the one he
[1:12:04] comes to Quicken they're the ones that
[1:12:08] now that dirt would lay there in the Sun
[1:12:11] and say oh this old sun is so hot that
[1:12:15] rock say this old sun is so hot but that
[1:12:18] little seed said that's what I'm looking
[1:12:21] for you see when when this message came
[1:12:24] to you you know a lot of people they
[1:12:27] they go to church and they listen they
[1:12:30] go to Catholic Church they go to baptist
[1:12:31] they go to Presbyterian they go to
[1:12:33] Jehovah Witness they're sitting there
[1:12:35] they're sitting in the pews they're
[1:12:36] looking at the clock because they can't
[1:12:37] wait to get
[1:12:39] out because they're something they're
[1:12:42] hearing it they might even get excited
[1:12:44] if the preacher is a good preacher but
[1:12:47] until something speaks to their heart
[1:12:50] and brings an Awakening into their lives
[1:12:53] to say wait a minute here this is not
[1:12:56] the this is different because when God
[1:12:58] wants to reveal something it's a spirit
[1:13:01] of God it changes absolutely everything
[1:13:03] he says this this uh he says um that's
[1:13:08] what I'm looking for and it begin to
[1:13:10] Spring forth to life it quickens that
[1:13:13] part of the dirt because the sun was
[1:13:16] sent not to Quicken The Rock not to
[1:13:18] Quicken the dirt but to Quicken the life
[1:13:21] of the seed now the Holy Spirit comes
[1:13:24] now of course it wasn't sent why
[1:13:27] wouldn't all the people receive it it
[1:13:30] wasn't sent to them the listen when
[1:13:33] Jesus came to the Earth he didn't come
[1:13:36] for everybody go back and read the
[1:13:39] gospels he says I didn't come for the
[1:13:41] for the righteous he says I came for
[1:13:44] those that that that that that needed
[1:13:46] healing I came for those that were sick
[1:13:49] I came for those I came for my own he
[1:13:52] said he said said all that the father
[1:13:54] hath given me will come not one of them
[1:13:57] will be
[1:13:59] lost what a wonderful promise in the
[1:14:02] word of God Amen Hallelujah praise God
[1:14:06] Amen thank you Lord
[1:14:10] Jesus and
[1:14:16] so here now go to the next
[1:14:19] slide we're winding down here we're
[1:14:21] going to finish in another five six
[1:14:24] minutes and then we're going to continue
[1:14:27] in the rising of the sun he says when
[1:14:29] God made his first bridegroom he made
[1:14:32] the bridegroom first and he was both man
[1:14:36] and woman in spirit okay remember when
[1:14:41] God expressed and said let us make man
[1:14:44] in our image okay he expressed Adam only
[1:14:50] it was one man okay one man and he and
[1:14:55] that was the that was the first
[1:14:57] bridegroom that's what brother Bram
[1:14:59] calls him okay now he said he made the
[1:15:03] first bridegroom first and he was both
[1:15:05] man and woman in spirit formed him in
[1:15:08] the dust of the earth to make him
[1:15:11] material so that he takes the dust of
[1:15:13] the earth and creates himself a body
[1:15:16] that he can put the spirit of of himself
[1:15:20] the spirit let us make man in our own
[1:15:22] image
[1:15:23] God expressing himself into a human body
[1:15:26] because there was a there was an earth
[1:15:28] that he had created for all of this Plan
[1:15:31] of Redemption to be fulfilled on and so
[1:15:34] now here he is and he's male and female
[1:15:38] in this one he forms him in the dust of
[1:15:40] the earth to make him material now
[1:15:41] notice when he made Eve it was from Adam
[1:15:45] he took not another piece of clay he
[1:15:48] took from the same piece of clay the
[1:15:51] same word for Adam was a spoken word
[1:15:56] when God said let us make man in our
[1:15:58] image God's word
[1:16:00] materialized that's his creative Spirit
[1:16:03] that's the power to create amen and he
[1:16:06] took from that same piece of clay the
[1:16:09] same word for Adam was the spoken word
[1:16:11] see he took from him and then taken he
[1:16:15] had masculine and feminine spirit and he
[1:16:19] took the feminist spirit away from Adam
[1:16:22] and placed in
[1:16:24] Eve created
[1:16:26] another body took because he was male
[1:16:30] and female god like a lot of people you
[1:16:32] know you know people are are are are
[1:16:34] wondering you know they have gender
[1:16:36] identity issues but but and and there's
[1:16:39] truth in the fact that in in the
[1:16:42] original creation which was Adam there
[1:16:45] was male and female but God separated
[1:16:48] them called one Adam and one Eve gave
[1:16:51] one the male one the female Spirit but
[1:16:54] they two are one amen and this is the
[1:16:58] whole thing why the church okay why
[1:17:01] we're talking about if the same spirit
[1:17:03] that raised up Christ and we read from
[1:17:05] the first scripture in the in Colossians
[1:17:07] he's talking about the church because
[1:17:09] the whole aspect of the church in the
[1:17:12] last days and the true Christian Church
[1:17:15] in this hour she goes back to her her
[1:17:19] original position back to her original
[1:17:23] Authority as being one with Christ Adam
[1:17:26] and Eve remember the first Eve was
[1:17:29] deceived but the scripture says that the
[1:17:31] bride in this day in the last days the
[1:17:34] the the the the eve the church for today
[1:17:38] will not be deceived she cannot be
[1:17:42] deceived why can she not be deceived
[1:17:45] because it's him in her Hallelujah then
[1:17:49] it's it was Adam's Spirit the dynamic
[1:17:53] um that Quicken the mechanics of his
[1:17:56] body so the bride must also be flesh of
[1:18:00] his flesh bone of his bone then how is
[1:18:03] this mortal flesh going to become his
[1:18:06] flesh we'll get to that in a minute see
[1:18:10] how it's done how what is this great
[1:18:14] [Music]
[1:18:16] transformation next time let the
[1:18:19] musicians
[1:18:20] come we're going to be looking
[1:18:23] at
[1:18:24] scripture and we're going to be
[1:18:27] quoting how it is that
[1:18:30] God is restoring us back to that
[1:18:35] fullness and being the literal body of
[1:18:39] Jesus Christ here on the Earth where
[1:18:41] Christ is now come to Quicken our bodies
[1:18:47] for the Rapture we're going to be
[1:18:49] looking at this process how it is that
[1:18:51] we simple people people that go to

[1:18:57] that the spirit of God is is moving in
[1:19:00] our lives changing us drawing us listen

[1:19:07] bed the other one left in the bed one
[1:19:09] taken from the field the other one left
[1:19:11] in the field how is this that's it's
[1:19:13] happening now God is already calling
[1:19:16] that that Supernatural Church which is
[1:19:20] the supernatural body of Jesus Christ
[1:19:23] and she's coming under the leadership of
[1:19:26] the word she's not joining herself to a
[1:19:30] church she's joining herself back to her
[1:19:34] bridegroom Adam the first Adam Came
