[23:53] out from you say Egypt modern Egypt
[24:00] or modern
[24:01] denominations your denomination may be
[24:05] in the family because family traditions
[24:08] and cultural hook you
[24:11] up this day the biggest thing hook
[24:15] people is
[24:18] cultural cultur is strong upon the
[24:22] people and through
[24:25] that they don't want to come out
[24:30] they don't want to come out and worship
[24:34] God you go into the even message
[24:37] churches ho Sunday the pews sometimes
[24:41] full
[24:43] up but the rest of if they are having
[24:46] church for a week all
[24:49] the sanctuary is empty it's not just
[24:53] here alone all over the
[24:56] world and God
[24:59] like Noah days God have seen
[25:04] righteousness in
[25:06] Noah God have seen righteousness in his
[25:11] wife this
[25:13] generation so he says come
[25:16] out come out from your culture come out
[25:21] from your
[25:23] denominations come out anything that is
[25:26] holding you come out
[25:29] because for indeed have I seen
[25:32] righteousness before me in the wife of
[25:36] Christ have I seen righteousness before
[25:40] me the whole
[25:42] world is going to go into
[25:46] tribulation but if you don't come out I
[25:49] cannot judge them I cannot bring my
[25:52] judgment upon them so I'm calling
[25:56] you purposely come
[26:01] out if you don't come out when the
[26:04] plague begin to fail it will fall upon
[26:07] you then you will be a foolish virgin I
[26:10] don't want to do that upon you I warn
[26:13] you to come
[26:14] out and take my
[26:17] word because where is my word my word is
[26:21] where the 54 Ministry as our pastor was
[26:26] saying where God God has
[26:30] ordained and the word is coming
[26:33] forth when you come
[26:36] out I polish you I give you my word I
[26:42] give you what it will take you from this
[26:45] Earth for you to meet me in the
[26:47] air amen because if you don't come
[26:52] out it's just like a
[26:56] man uh uh sister Vanessa son Daniel he s
[27:02] his precious wife and he give the
[27:05] invitation to the wife the wife was in
[27:08] Germany Daniel is in Canada and Daniel
[27:12] told her I love you and the sister says
[27:16] oh
[27:17] Daniel I love you but I will stay in
[27:21] Germany you stay in Canada can that be a
[27:26] marriage and this is what happened to so
[27:29] many of
[27:31] us God is saying come out because indeed
[27:36] have I seen righteousness before me I'm
[27:39] calling you I've given you the
[27:43] invitation to come take my word when you
[27:46] come out then it prove to me you love
[27:52] me it proved to me that you love me when
[27:55] the sister came out it proved to that
[27:58] that he L Daniel because he cannot stay
[28:02] in Germany and Tell Daniel I love you
[28:05] that does not go with God
[28:09] way right God don't want that God want
[28:12] us to be in his
[28:15] presence I am not
[28:17] saying every
[28:19] day every God word we have to have
[28:23] balance sometime things may happen job
[28:27] or you know sickness or things that's
[28:31] why you find out that people are in the
[28:35] message but they
[28:39] weak even sickness then they get
[28:42] frustrated they don't have money they
[28:44] get
[28:46] frustrated

[31:15] sitting
[31:17] here and the brother even has given the
[31:19] testimony already but I don't want to
[31:22] mention
[31:24] names and we lay our hands on him
[31:28] and we pray for him when he confessed I
[31:30] said brother
[31:32] listen do you believe the holy
[31:35] spirit it's not brother Kofi it's not
[31:38] Phillip it's
[31:40] not anybody it's all about
[31:45] Jesus this gospel is all about
[31:50] Christ if you believe Christ he can use
[31:53] any vsel to speak to you at any time he
[32:00] wants we don't look to faces or color or
[32:05] School degree or no degree or big
[32:08] preacher or small preacher or no
[32:11] preacher all those things or sister the
[32:14] Lord can do whatever he
[32:17] wants but you got to obey the
[32:21] voice I have to obey when he speak to
[32:26] me Noah obey the
[32:29] voice right we read it in his generation
[32:34] God spoke to him he
[32:36] obey all those
[32:39] prophets when God spoke to them the
[32:43] reason why the scripture Moses Abraham
[32:46] Elijah Noah William Braham John the
[32:50] Baptist they all obey the voice of God
[32:53] that's speaking to them and through that
[32:57] they were were able to
[32:59] accomplish what the Lord want them to
[33:03] accomplish if not so they wouldn't be
[33:06] able to do
[33:10] it right that's why the scripture tell
[33:15] us that we are the chosen generation
[33:20] from God before the foundations of this
[33:23] world you came
[33:26] here with a seed of God in you that seed
[33:31] if it is a part of God it cannot
[33:34] rest no matter what happen whether
[33:38] sickness whether poverty whether pain
[33:43] whether you lose your business you you
[33:45] are uneducated or educated or whatever
[33:49] happen all your children even die on you
[33:52] or your wife die on you husband die on
[33:56] you you will still obey the voice of
[34:01] God because it's the seed of God and
[34:04] where
[34:05] God is there is Liberty there is freedom
[34:11] that's where your joy will come
[34:13] from do you know you can go through pain
[34:18] so much that that pain doesn't even
[34:22] bother
[34:23] you because you know why when you have
[34:26] surrendered
[34:28] to the almighty God who has chose you
[34:31] and called you you don't see no poty you
[34:35] don't see
[34:37] no
[34:39] pain but that's why the prophet has told
[34:42] us look away to who
[34:45] Jesus because when you look to
[34:48] him everything become
[34:50] perfect but when you don't look to him
[34:54] you have sorrows and pain
[34:57] that's why in this message a lot have
[35:01] pain
[35:03] pain always dragging their
[35:06] feet they try to drag their feet they
[35:09] ignoring the small the little small
[35:13] voice that is speaking to them right the
[35:17] Small Voice God voice that he has placed
[35:20] in their heart you can't even run from
[35:22] the pastor run from the church your
[35:25] fellow brothers and sisters
[35:28] but that voice will continue to speak to
[35:31] you because God didn't chose you because
[35:36] of Good Neighbor he chose
[35:39] you before the foundations of this world
[35:42] before this building was buil he saw it
[35:47] right so you are not just chosen today
[35:51] recognize who you are because in you
[35:54] there is
[35:55] power when you recog recognize that no
[35:58] matter what happened to you you'll be
[36:03] rejoicing you'll be
[36:05] happy you won't forsake
[36:08] God yes you make
[36:11] mistakes mistakes I tell you brother
[36:14] Braham himself what did he say I
[36:17] backslide Thousand Times
[36:20] Daily if the prophet backslide in his
[36:23] time Thousand Times Daily what about us
[36:27] today
[36:29] right God knows
[36:32] that he he have put his trust in you you
[36:36] are the
[36:37] last
[36:39] baton that have to run with the Baton
[36:43] you you are the last batch that have to
[36:45] run with the
[36:47] Baton the trust is passed on to you amen
[36:52] so don't fail Jesus
[36:55] Christ Noah he
[36:59] accomplished what he was called
[37:02] for okay I'm going to turn and read to
[37:05] my second scripture you'll see why I I I
[37:08] say we should read Colossians
[37:12] 2
[37:14] chapter
[37:25] 6 no colians c o l o s s i a n
[37:33] x is it chonic is it col Colossians yeah
[37:39] okay sorry colians
[37:42] 2
[37:44] 6 listen 6 verse
[37:48] 9 as ye have
[37:51] therefore
[37:53] receive Christ Jesus the Lord so so work
[37:58] ye in
[38:01] him
[38:03] right he has given you the
[38:08] invitation you have accept the king
[38:13] word when he give you the
[38:17] invitation you said you accepted
[38:20] it now the word is telling you walk ye
[38:23] in
[38:25] him in another way
[38:28] don't play with the
[38:30] word don't joke with God word you
[38:34] surrender so that the word will be
[38:39] fulfilled it's like a man married to a
[38:42] woman why a man married to a
[38:46] woman and planted his seed he want that
[38:50] seed that go to the woman W to bring
[38:53] forth after his
[38:55] kind so that the man could see his
[38:59] image but if the man give the seed to
[39:04] the woman like this SoCal mod womens
[39:08] some of them they don't want to take no
[39:11] man's
[39:13] seed they don't want to carry them SE
[39:16] man's seed they they
[39:19] think man's seed is not good for
[39:23] them but if you and I spiritually
[39:27] speaking have taken Jesus seed we should
[39:31] allow the word to fortify our heart so
[39:36] that the word will bring forth after his
[39:40] kind right okay verse
[39:43] 9 for in him dwell all the fullness of
[39:48] the godhead
[39:51] bodily and 10 and ye are complete in him
[39:57] who which is the head of all
[40:01] principality and
[40:04] power
[40:07] God is all the head of
[40:13] everything right he's the head of
[40:16] everything your eye can see what your
[40:20] eye cannot see he is the
[40:23] head he is the one that gave his life
[40:26] went to the Great grave come out from
[40:28] come out from the grave nobody has done
[40:31] that he's the one that says I am he that
[40:36] was dead but I'm alive forever more he's
[40:40] the one that has given you eternal
[40:45] life so walk ye in
[40:49] him allowed him to do what he
[40:54] says he will do with you
[40:58] if we obey him nothing is too high that
[41:04] the people
[41:05] today we
[41:08] know the whole world is doing what
[41:11] falling
[41:13] apart before when we said the world is
[41:16] falling
[41:20] apart it was we were just
[41:24] looking what brother Braham has spoken
[41:28] and speaking it but now what brother
[41:32] Brown
[41:33] spoke we don't have to read it in
[41:37] books it's plain before
[41:40] us the what the Prophet The Prophet was
[41:45] seeing the thing coming and he was
[41:47] speaking because he knew that you and I
[41:50] will be coming but now we are here
[41:54] looking at what the prophet spoke
[41:58] is playing before us Israel and Hamas
[42:02] and all these wars what do you
[42:06] think is heading
[42:10] towards exactly what the Bible
[42:13] said Isaac and
[42:17] ishma when Sarah told Sarah told
[42:21] Abraham cast that ish out they can live
[42:26] with
[42:28] ISAC that wall is still going on as our
[42:31] pastor saying
[42:33] now that is the wall that is going
[42:37] on and you're going to continue going
[42:40] on nobody can stop it nobody can break
[42:44] it what God has spoke will come to pass
[42:49] whether we like it or not it will come
[42:52] to
[42:53] pass but why these things was going on
[42:57] on is a sign to
[43:00] us what was the last sign God did to
[43:06] Abraham last time I told I said it I
[43:09] repeat it again the last sign was God
[43:13] coming in
[43:15] flesh visit
[43:17] Abraham and told Abraham you're going to
[43:20] have a son s even
[43:23] laugh from that time you go in this
[43:26] Bible I cannot not read it proper but
[43:28] let me say I
[43:31] know the last time God visit
[43:35] Abraham the second thing you can see was
[43:38] what Abraham be to beg when he told him
[43:42] what he was going to do to the
[43:45] sodomites then Abraham be to beg for
[43:48] what the
[43:50] sodomites if there's I think 50 or 40
[43:53] came right down to what I think five or
[43:56] so he couldn't even find one then he he
[44:00] begin
[44:03] to his nephew lot beg for lot we are
[44:09] seeing the same thing because why
[44:12] brother Abraham is gone B grah is gone
[44:16] as our pastor was saying Sunday Roy
[44:19] Robert is gone the Three Angels is gone
[44:22] and now God is in what in flesh in the
[44:26] bright
[44:28] skin the true bride so
[44:33] God is visiting
[44:36] them are you listening to me God is
[44:40] doing what visiting them it's not in
[44:44] Pages no more it's now in the form of
[44:49] God is now in the form of man whether
[44:53] you like it or not listen I may not able
[44:57] able to speak it properly like my pastor
[44:59] but bear with me is the
[45:02] truth God in
[45:05] flesh in skin walking in the bright form
[45:11] talking and the people
[45:14] think oh Pastor Danny is speaking so I
[45:18] won't come to
[45:20] church brother deson is speaking I don't
[45:22] come to church brother Kofi that bheed
[45:26] short brother when he come here and he
[45:30] he don't know even his Bible proper but
[45:33] he tried to say God has call him and he
[45:35] talking about the Bible this that so I
[45:39] will not even be here whether you like
[45:41] it you don't God has
[45:44] chose it's not my
[45:47] chose God chose he
[45:50] chose listen God chose he
[45:54] chose it's not the will of
[45:58] man we woman beings we want everything
[46:01] proper straight up this way that way
[46:04] that's why the culture and the education
[46:07] has brought
[46:08] us but God is
[46:11] God he does not
[46:14] change God doesn't
[46:17] change okay God know why he chose his
[46:23] children is sometime the men may not
[46:27] even read good his sentence may not be
[46:30] proper in the English or in the French
[46:32] or in the language that that country you
[46:35] have to bring the word but God May hide
[46:39] behind that
[46:41] skin so that those that have an eye to
[46:45] see they can
[46:47] see that this is not the man the man may
[46:51] be meming his words not too good but God
[46:55] is hiding in man that's what you must
[46:58] look for because
[47:02] when when
[47:04] God sometime bring a man straight proper
[47:09] the devil can catch everything but if
[47:12] the man don't know his left and right
[47:13] and the man stand there talking like he
[47:16] don't know what is even himself talking
[47:19] what are you going to say when you get
[47:21] oh this is not service this is improper
[47:25] service this is not the way God have to
[47:30] move and meanwhile you missing
[47:35] God because the
[47:37] foolishness of God is even wiser than
[47:42] men and the wiser things of men is
[47:48] foolish unto the
[47:52] Lord because he does that so that Satan
[47:56] can catch
[47:57] what he's
[47:58] doing Noah God told him to build an ark
[48:03] right rain has never been
[48:07] fall rain has never
[48:13] fall God says Noah Bu The
[48:17] Ark
[48:20] then the people in this generation
[48:23] 120 years this man was
[48:27] preaching how does it sound Noah
[48:31] sound all the scholars the intellectuals
[48:34] the Pharisees in that day or the sagy in
[48:39] that day they thought this man was
[48:44] cuckoo the business people in that day
[48:47] ah this man is cuckoo is talking
[48:49] something that has never happen but that
[48:52] was God Amen doing itory
[48:57] and God in this day in our day is doing
[49:03] the same
[49:05] thing that's why the voice is calling
[49:09] calling calling
[49:12] calling telling us come out come out
[49:15] from your comfort zone come
[49:18] out God is visiting with
[49:21] us he's visiting
[49:24] us in the form of wife4
[49:28] Ministry from the pastor to the lease
[49:32] he's visiting us and he's saying come
[49:34] out come out come out why because I'm
[49:39] going to judge the
[49:40] sodomites don't forget I'm going to
[49:43] judge them but
[49:46] you whom I have
[49:49] chosen if you don't come out I can't
[49:53] judge
[49:55] them so you need to come
[49:58] out come out come out from your comfort
[50:01] zone you think this is a pain you think
[50:05] what you are going through is a disaster
[50:07] in your life you wait and watch and see
[50:11] what is
[50:12] coming wait and see what is coming upon
[50:16] the
[50:17] a you going to
[50:20] know that you were blessed by
[50:24] God you going to know how God God has
[50:27] blessed you that God used to come to you
[50:31] right in this pulpit and speak and tell
[50:36] you things before those things come to
[50:39] pass because this world is going to be
[50:43] chaos am chaos more chaos is
[50:48] coming more chaos I don't care what
[50:51] anybody tells me
[50:54] because when you look what did you
[50:58] see like our
[51:00] pastor when he was preaching last time
[51:03] says whether Trump
[51:05] come
[51:08] or the
[51:11] woman whether he
[51:13] come it doesn't matter right two of them
[51:18] it doesn't matter who
[51:20] coming there's a disaster on the way
[51:23] coming I said there is a disaster coming
[51:27] Run for Cover the only place you can run
[51:31] to is Jesus
[51:32] Christ the only place the only shelter
[51:35] for you and I is Christ the
[51:39] Lord Christ the lord or
[51:43] chaos where are you running
[51:45] to Noah saw it when God spoke to Noah
[51:50] and told Noah indeed have I seen
[51:54] righteousness
[51:57] so is you I have seen righteousness in
[52:01] you so I have called you you may not be
[52:05] a prophet like Noah but type yourself
[52:09] that voice that spoke to Noah and says
[52:13] Noah indeed have I seen righteousness
[52:16] before
[52:17] me God giv Noah Grace God giving you
[52:22] Grace giving me Grace Lord so don't turn
[52:27] that dis uh that Grace to
[52:30] disgrace because we
[52:32] Humanity when there's going to be an
[52:35] earthquake we don't know with all our
[52:39] scientific socalled our scientific
[52:42] achievement
[52:43] sometime the people still sit there till
[52:48] the the disaster strike and Destroy so
[52:53] many why because woman human
[52:57] beings they don't know when disaster is
[53:01] coming but look at the
[53:03] animals the chicken the
[53:06] dog all those animals in the bush when
[53:10] there's an earthquake before the
[53:12] earthquake will strike they will see
[53:15] that the earthquake is coming then
[53:17] they're running for cover because why
[53:20] they obey God just as Noah obey
[53:24] God you and I
[53:27] right now when we look into the world
[53:30] you don't need somebody to tell you
[53:32] going to be a disaster if you don't
[53:35] believe me look at the news and look at
[53:38] what is happening what do you think
[53:41] Satan is not going sleeping he's alive
[53:46] God is not sleeping God is is in his
[53:50] wife and he will take us from here
[53:53] brothers and sisters let me let me tell
[53:56] you I believe God more than anything I
[54:00] believe God this thing is so real to me
[54:04] if this gospel is not so real to me then
[54:07] let me walk away and go to Sodom and
[54:09] live in Sodom life and die because God
[54:13] is so real whatever God has promised us
[54:18] brothers and sisters let us have
[54:20] confidence in the Lord Noah have
[54:23] confidence in the Lord that's why Noah
[54:27] obey God Amen Noah obey God Noah is a
[54:33] type of a true wife of Christ that is
[54:37] obeying the Lord Jesus Christ for this
[54:44] hour our because if we don't obey
[54:49] him then we are not his
[54:53] wife if you are not obeying the Lord
[54:56] then you are not his wife listen the
[54:59] Bible has even given us so much grace it
[55:03] says the righteous falls seven times he
[55:06] rise up what seven times in otherwise
[55:10] you make a
[55:12] mistake just rise up don't stay in the
[55:16] mod and you go in the Bible it says if
[55:19] the same spirit that rais up Christ
[55:23] dwell in you he shall also do what
[55:27] Quicken your mortal
[55:30] Body by his spirit so you want to tell
[55:35] me spirit of God dwell in you and you
[55:38] fall down and you can't get up then
[55:41] that's not spirit of God you need to
[55:45] repent and come to Christ and baptize in
[55:50] the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus
[55:52] Christ that those that are in
[55:55] denominations
[55:57] yes they may be good there's good people
[56:00] out there God is not looking for good
[56:02] people he didn't come for good and and
[56:05] righteous people he came for those that
[56:09] will obey his word don't let them fool
[56:13] you sometime
[56:15] people they can live holy than you and
[56:20] me but that is not the word is asking
[56:24] for the word is asking asking you for
[56:27] obedience is better than
[56:30] sacrifice the word tells you like we
[56:34] that are in good neighbor let me turn to
[56:36] us because judgment start from the house
[56:39] of the Lord right before he hit the
[56:44] street it start with me
[56:48] judgment if I can't line up with the
[56:51] word how I'm going to tell somebody on
[56:54] the street to come here and watch
[56:56] worship God you think he going to
[56:59] work if I can't line up on the word you
[57:02] think if I go lay my hands on somebody
[57:05] on the street they're going to get
[57:08] healed right A lot of people want to see
[57:12] leg stretch if he the
[57:16] leg is straight the arms
[57:19] stretch the cancer gone depression gone
[57:24] money riches everything
[57:26] but simple question God asks you and I
[57:31] don't forsake his
[57:34] house don't forsake the house of the
[57:38] Lord how many of us forsake the house of
[57:41] the
[57:42] Lord if we put it in in pen and and
[57:46] check it by God word not
[57:51] legalistic you think God stand here
[57:54] physically and says I'm
[57:57] how many are going to pass that
[58:00] test
[58:01] okay
[58:05] few let the simple question God is
[58:08] giving us Grace he gave Noah Grace Noah
[58:13] obey 120 years the prophet has left the
[58:17] scene some of us were not even I don't
[58:21] think every one of us were born here but
[58:24] we are here
[58:26] how many years 50 something years now
[58:29] right we shouldn't give
[58:32] up we should be faithful to the word
[58:35] that the prophet
[58:37] preach whether rain or
[58:40] Sunshine the prophet William Brown word
[58:43] would be
[58:47] fulfilled what he has
[58:50] spoken it will come to
[58:53] pass I have faith
[58:57] in what the prophet
[58:59] preach if this is not truth then I don't
[59:03] know any gospel that is in my age that
[59:07] is
[59:08] true that's all I can
[59:11] see if it is not true then I don't know
[59:15] any gospel that is
[59:17] true a man that stand there with grade
[59:20] seven
[59:22] education he tell them what I have preed
[59:26] serpent

[1:04:12] met he look at me he says brother Kofi
[1:04:15] you are
[1:04:16] changing okay I said thank
[1:04:20] you
[1:04:22] brother I come to church here
[1:04:26] bar Tim is watching
[1:04:28] me Tim just come to me right here on the
[1:04:32] corner you look at me said
[1:04:36] brovi you are
[1:04:39] changing then he
[1:04:42] said
[1:04:44] brother is the rapture so
[1:04:49] close like that I didn't say a word what
[1:04:53] team that said that says brother you are
[1:04:56] you are really really
[1:04:58] changed without even opening my
[1:05:02] mouth okay who is and the only thing I
[1:05:07] find myself is before I used to get
[1:05:12] angry things that bother me I don't lie
[1:05:16] to you and Pastor Danny will tell you
[1:05:19] because before he was the head of the
[1:05:21] deacon deson knows me better I used to
[1:05:25] angry when you say something and it
[1:05:28] bothers me but now let me tell you even
[1:05:33] if you can even ask my children my wife
[1:05:37] they are the closest
[1:05:40] one I will speak maybe you said
[1:05:43] something I'll just say
[1:05:45] it you can say whatever you want I my
[1:05:49] mind is it doesn't bother me no more and
[1:05:52] it's not something I I try to put in
[1:05:56] on it's like it's
[1:06:00] gone
[1:06:02] and my
[1:06:05] heart Mo
[1:06:07] mostly I find
[1:06:09] myself
[1:06:11] praying from the
[1:06:14] top every single one of
[1:06:17] us with this true heart not just going
[1:06:21] burning the like before praying so oh
[1:06:25] God B no no no but it come from within
[1:06:29] me like that and I'm seeing that it's
[1:06:33] taking place even my children if I see
[1:06:37] mistake on them my mouth is
[1:06:40] shut I allow them to go through because
[1:06:44] the Lord allowed me to go through I can
[1:06:47] look at myself back what the Lord has
[1:06:51] done he has done a work on me so I
[1:06:55] should allowed him to do it on my
[1:06:58] children if I don't then I'm going to be
[1:07:01] a hindrance to the
[1:07:03] Lord because God is the one that is
[1:07:06] doing it we cannot do
[1:07:10] it all is asking
[1:07:12] us we should give us our
[1:07:16] heart the call has come to
[1:07:19] us what are we going to do are we going
[1:07:23] to turn him down are we going going to
[1:07:25] over him and say
[1:07:28] Lord yes you are God but I won't let you
[1:07:32] to my secret
[1:07:34] room God want to go into our secret
[1:07:37] room is the
[1:07:39] heart the heart the Lord
[1:07:43] wants the True
[1:07:45] Heart when the true heart is pure then
[1:07:51] God can use you the way he want to use
[1:07:54] you
[1:07:56] he can talk to who he want to talk
[1:07:59] to even I've noticed witnessing it's not
[1:08:02] you going to
[1:08:04] witness it's
[1:08:06] him and you won't be aware of it
[1:08:10] sometime and God will drag the person to
[1:08:15] you it's just like any man any man when
[1:08:19] they are testy nobody go tell them how
[1:08:22] to go find water the desire D in their
[1:08:26] heart God has placed in them pushes them
[1:08:30] towards water to go
[1:08:33] drink the god
[1:08:36] seed who are the wife of
[1:08:40] Christ they are not just chosen today
[1:08:43] they were chosen before the foundations
[1:08:45] of this world so if God ordained

[1:08:54] the one that have to call him or her
[1:08:57] when that his time reach let me tell you
[1:09:01] when my time reach you ask this thism

[1:09:21] didn't know what church to go
[1:09:23] to but he begin to
[1:09:27] push every time I says oh
