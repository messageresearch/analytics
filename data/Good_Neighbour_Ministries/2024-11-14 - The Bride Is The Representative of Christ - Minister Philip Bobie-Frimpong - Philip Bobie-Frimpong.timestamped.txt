[16:05] that we show up tonight to bless your
[16:09] children in the name of our Lord Jesus
[16:12] Christ
[16:14] amen ah praise
[16:17] God I have something I was so fully
[16:21] prepared and last me change on me so I
[16:24] don't know I haven't really prepared
[16:26] this 100% but just for give me half
[16:31] things all over the place I hope it
[16:34] blesses
[16:35] you um if I'm going to title it's going
[16:38] to be the brightest representative of
[16:41] Christ my uh scripture will be taken
[16:45] from Acts chapter 4 verse 13- 22
[17:03] now when they saw the
[17:06] boldness of Peter and John and perceived
[17:10] that they were unlearned and ignorant
[17:13] men they marveled and they took
[17:16] knowledge of them that they had been
[17:19] with Jesus we're going to stress on that
[17:23] most of the time
[17:25] and beholding the man which was he
[17:31] standing with them they could say
[17:33] nothing against it because they have
[17:35] they saw the testimony themselves and
[17:38] the person was there so you can't deny
[17:40] that amen yeah and behold the man which
[17:44] was healed standing with them they could
[17:46] say nothing against it but when they had
[17:50] commanded them to go aside out of the
[17:53] council and confir among themselves
[17:56] saying what shall we do this men
[18:00] for that indeed a notable Miracle had
[18:04] been done by them is Manifest to all
[18:08] them that dwell in Jerusalem and we
[18:10] cannot deny
[18:14] it but that is spread no further among
[18:17] the people let us stly threaten them
[18:21] that they speak hence forth to no man in
[18:23] this
[18:25] name and they called them and commanded
[18:28] them not to speak at all nor teach in
[18:31] the name of
[18:32] Jesus but Peter and
[18:36] John answered and said unto them whether
[18:39] it be right in the sight of God
[18:43] to Heen unto you more than God judge ye
[18:49] for we cannot be speak the things which
[18:52] we have seen and heard so when they had
[18:56] further threatened them they let them go
[18:58] finding nothing how they might punish
[19:01] them because of the people for all men
[19:03] glorify God for that which was done for
[19:08] the man was about 40 years old on whom
[19:11] this miracle of healing was showed
[19:14] Heavenly Father please bless the reading
[19:17] of your word in the name of our Lord
[19:19] Jesus Christ amen please be
[19:22] seated so
[19:25] um my title is
[19:29] the bride is representative of
[19:31] Christ okay but if the background before
[19:35] this
[19:37] happened Peter and John they
[19:40] were they didn't have that boldness that
[19:43] they have back then before that because
[19:48] um the Christ was not crucified
[19:52] yet because the Holy Ghost was not giv
[19:56] even though Peter did so many things but
[19:58] they were still not um I they were not
[20:03] um I forgot the exact word that the
[20:05] scripture used but they have all that
[20:07] they were not converted if my scripture
[20:11] is right so they did before then they
[20:15] were
[20:15] scared but when Christ died on Calvary
[20:20] he gave up the ghost so when they put
[20:22] that on his side what came was his
[20:27] spirit so that Spirit became available
[20:30] on the day of Pentecost and only 120
[20:34] went there to receive it so after they
[20:36] received the Holy Ghost then they went
[20:39] with boldness and they demonstrate to
[20:41] the people the power of Christ they were
[20:44] not scared again Peter who denied him
[20:48] and all those things wasn't scared and
[20:52] what make it more relevant that the
[20:54] people had recognized that they had been
[20:58] with what the Lord Jesus Christ so the
[21:02] emphasiz is that as we are moving among
[21:05] the people Christ that we profess that
[21:09] he lives inside of us has to be visible
[21:11] to the People by our actions people have
[21:14] to see Christ in us that's why he read
[21:17] he spoke over
[21:19] here
[21:25] um he said that it I think it influenced
[21:29] 1963
[21:31] 1130b and if we take the testimony of
[21:34] being Christians I think that that is
[21:38] one of the most solemn things that a man
[21:43] or a woman boy or girl could do world
[21:48] when he takes on the name of Christ that
[21:51] he's going to be a representative of
[21:54] Christ we should watch every move
[21:59] you make because somebody is watching
[22:03] you and in this it reflects God what
[22:08] what God has done for you inside of you
[22:11] so what has taken place inside of you
[22:15] will automatically reflect outside so
[22:18] it's not how much the knowledge you have
[22:20] about the message is good the knowledge
[22:23] is good but it has to be revealed to you
[22:27] and that knowledge without works is
[22:29] nothing so if you know all the Mysteries
[22:33] and your life doesn't match up to what
[22:36] you are talking about what profit
[22:38] doesn't profit the people because the
[22:41] people want to see
[22:42] actions they want to see the reality of
[22:45] what you are talking about they are fed
[22:48] up with w w are cheap but they want to
[22:52] see the chist that you are professing
[22:55] inside of you remember all those mamad
[22:59] Dan and know they can do signs and wers
[23:01] all over but the difference is when
[23:03] Christ is in you it will conquer all of
[23:06] them one will chase it they will
[23:09] see like Elijah he told those people
[23:13] they do all those things that they did
[23:15] but one action from Elijah consume like
[23:18] Moses when he met pharaoh and his those
[23:22] jambes and those they tried to do all
[23:25] everything and the trick but everything
[23:27] they did because Moses had the true one
[23:31] his s his name consumed
[23:34] this so God has to prove that he's
[23:38] behind you and your testimony have to be
[23:43] real people have to testify and see that
[23:47] you have been with Jesus because if you
[23:50] read the whole scriptures when that
[23:52] miracle was done 5,000 people believe
[23:56] Christ amen am so you don't even need
[24:00] adver
[24:02] advertisement one thing major thing from
[24:05] God will bring the
[24:07] people when that thing was done it said
[24:11] 5,000 people believed on the Lord Jesus
[24:15] Christ so he's the same yesterday today
[24:19] and forever he hasn't changed and he's
[24:22] still doing the same thing so if he did
[24:25] that through Peter why can't you do that
[24:27] through you and me if it's the same
[24:29] yesterday today and because God hasn't
[24:31] changed what he did back then he'll do
[24:35] it in you and in me he's the same
[24:39] God God hasn't changed his word hasn't
[24:43] changed and the word of God will defeat
[24:46] the Devil at any place anywhere at any
[24:49] point if you take God at his word and
[24:52] apply it with Revelation behind it not
[24:55] just the words because people can even
[24:58] quot it better than you and me but the
[25:01] difference is is it revealed to
[25:04] you if it's revealed it makes a
[25:07] difference because God revealed to Abel
[25:11] how to make the sacrifice and when that
[25:14] was revealed God himself testify of it
[25:18] Cain brought a very beautiful sacrifice
[25:23] but God rejected it because it wasn't
[25:26] done by Revelation the Bible say
[25:28] anything done without faith it's sin and
[25:32] faith is a revelation so even your
[25:35] offering everything has to be done with
[25:37] faith and when Abraham believed God the
[25:41] Bible said that everything that Abraham
[25:44] bought with money that was his servant
[25:47] whatever he circumcised all of them that
[25:50] means that when God bless you with your
[25:53] money and anything that you doing you
[25:55] have to take God into account that it
[25:58] was wasn't just by you your power your
[26:01] might but God has blessed you so you
[26:04] have to what use it for his glory and
[26:07] honor am that's the god that we are
[26:09] serving he's the Living God Amen
[26:14] and God that created heaven and earth
[26:17] he's still here today he hasn't changed
[26:20] he sent us a Vindicated Prophet type of
[26:25] Abraham sending a laser to look for
[26:28] right for
[26:29] him
[26:32] and that is natural tying
[26:37] spiritual and when you read the Bible in
[26:40] Genesis
[26:42] chapter Genesis 20
[26:47] 24:7 Abraham told elar because when it
[26:52] was time for elizar to go and look for
[26:54] the bride elazar was scared and he was
[26:58] doubting and he told him that um in
[27:03] verse
[27:03] 5 and the servant s him per Adventure
[27:08] the woman will not be willing to follow
[27:10] me into this land must I need bring thy
[27:14] son again unto the land from when thou
[27:17] comest and Abraham said unto him beware
[27:20] thou that thou bring not my son th again
[27:25] verse seven the Lord God of Heaven which
[27:30] took me from my father's house and from
[27:34] the land of my Kindred and which spoke
[27:37] unto me and th swear unto me saying unto
[27:40] thy seed will I give this land he shall
[27:44] send his Angel before thee and thou
[27:46] shall take a wife unto my son from
[27:49] thanks because Abraham has confidence in
[27:51] God of what God has done to him in the
[27:54] past he remembered God that took him
[27:58] from his Kindred from his parents from
[28:00] all those things has led him th far if
[28:03] God has led you this far what do you
[28:06] have need of tonight what are you scared
[28:09] of Abraham was not scared of anything
[28:13] because he has confidence that if God
[28:15] could bring him from the his Kindred
[28:17] land from all over the place and even
[28:21] his only son that God promised him to
[28:25] what H that through him he going to
[28:28] bless him and take and possess all the
[28:32] land when the time came Abraham have
[28:35] confidence to sacrifice that sign
[28:37] because you have confidence that God
[28:39] that gave the child to him would
[28:42] somebody who was dead in um the like the
[28:46] wife was dead in his in her womb the
[28:49] wife could not they were of Shing of old
[28:53] he has confidence that God that gave
[28:56] them as someone who were said was able
[28:58] to raise Isaac up and he saw all those
[29:03] testimony of God providing himself his
[29:07] own sacrifice so with all those
[29:09] testimonies in his belt with that
[29:12] experience you think he was going to be
[29:14] worried about um telling him to go and
[29:16] find a wife a wife for his son no he
[29:19] wasn't worried so it's a true Christian
[29:22] of Christ because you
[29:26] cannot um you
[29:30] cannot leave you cannot have that faith
[29:33] without having a testimony behind your
[29:36] faith has to have a testimony you have
[29:38] to have something to stand on it has to
[29:40] be revealed to you but if you say you're
[29:43] a Christian then God somewhere along the
[29:46] line must have revealed something to you
[29:48] in the past something in your past that
[29:51] you have seen God has done to for you if
[29:54] you could go back and see what the Lord
[29:56] has done for you in the past
[29:58] then when you are facing tomorrow no
[30:01] matter how dark that tomorrow may be
[30:04] your confidence should be in that God
[30:06] and I know that that God will bring you
[30:09] out because he brought you out in the
[30:11] past he will do it again and again and
[30:14] again and I'm afraid if you don't have
[30:17] that confidence if you have not met God
[30:20] for
[30:21] yourself if you have not seen him if he
[30:24] has not seen him for yourself or you
[30:27] have don't have any TI post when the
[30:29] enemy comes to you it's going to be a
[30:31] trouble on you it's going to be hard I'm
[30:34] not saying that you going to fight the
[30:36] battle yourself but if God is in you has
[30:38] done something in the past for you it
[30:40] will give you confidence to tell the
[30:42] devil that shut up Satan I'm not yours
[30:45] I'm a son of the Living God brah said
[30:48] that when the enemy comes to him and
[30:50] tell him all those things then he will s
[30:52] us okay what about this what about that
[30:55] Satan what about this that did go God
[30:57] did for what about this what about that
[30:59] what about that so that he ran away
[31:02] because why he has a tle he has a
[31:04] testimony so what God does that he
[31:07] reveal himself to us in the past and do
[31:10] those things to us so that when the time
[31:13] comes to face the enemy you can remember
[31:17] what God has done for you like
[31:19] Samson when he got to a place that he
[31:24] was blind and they were carrying him and
[31:27] he had has done wrong and everything but
[31:30] Abraham said that when they were tied
[31:32] him and everything he was thinking what
[31:35] God has done for him thinking about how
[31:39] God used him with a Jawbone to kill like
[31:41] thousand of those Philistines and all
[31:44] those major things that God he was
[31:46] thinking and then he repented said once
[31:49] more let me die with my enemies because
[31:53] he has God been with Jesus before he has
[31:56] seen that
[31:58] testimony and I believe that
[32:02] elazar also was
[32:05] um was
[32:08] influenced by the faith of his master so
[32:13] when he got to the place to look for the
[32:16] bride he didn't go by himself he
[32:20] prayed so prayer will bring God
[32:24] anointing down amen and the the main
[32:27] thing is if your motive is right and
[32:31] your objective is right God is under
[32:34] obligation to answer you you can say to
[32:38] this mountain be th removed if you not
[32:40] doubt in your heart believe what you
[32:42] have said it will come to pass it's not
[32:45] you just going say I want this I speak
[32:48] this I speak that that will not work but
[32:51] when the
[32:53] deity Christ in you spoke through you it
[32:56] will come to pass because the date is
[32:59] speaking through you am and you are
[33:01] Christ Christ you are representative of
[33:04] Christ so with that day is in new
[33:07] speaking it will come to pass that makes
[33:10] a difference so
[33:12] elazar prayed and he saw the answer of
[33:18] his
[33:19] prayer right there he saw the
[33:21] manifestation Rebecca came and do
[33:25] exactly the sign he asked of God
[33:29] but the thing is after all those things
[33:33] were
[33:34] done they wanted to hold her a little
[33:39] back
[33:41] and she has to make her own
[33:46] decision so is the bride of Christ every
[33:51] one of us there are times in our life we
[33:55] be
[33:56] confronted we be forced to make a
[34:01] decision and El
[34:04] laser Rebecca when she was asked she
[34:08] said she will go with
[34:12] elaser I believe that
[34:15] Ruth and opa was also confronted with
[34:20] the same
[34:22] situation they were forced to make a
[34:26] decision and
[34:28] Opa like the noral Christian he wasn't
[34:32] willing to go all the way she wasn't
[34:35] willing to go all the way she went a
[34:38] halfway and
[34:40] when um Naomi presented the thing to her
[34:45] to look so bad to look so awkward to
[34:48] look that there's no hope for her to
[34:50] follow her she just bow down to the
[34:53] pressure but God doesn't want us to bow
[34:56] down to the pressure
[34:58] a true Christian you have to go all the
[35:00] way no matter what comes our way our
[35:03] life is in his hands he's able to lead
[35:05] us through doesn't matter what how it
[35:08] looks outward how it looks
[35:11] dark Ruth didn't worry about that she
[35:15] said your God will be my God your people
[35:20] will be my people when you die I will
[35:24] also die why because he has caught
[35:27] revelation
[35:28] she realized that there's something
[35:31] about Nomi she have that Revelation that
[35:34] when she follow her even though it's
[35:37] going to be tough but God will be with
[35:40] her so is the bride of Christ no matter
[35:44] what we are going through no matter how
[35:47] sometimes you see the road is that move
[35:50] forward amen s not everything that God
[35:54] will tell you but by faith step forward
[35:59] don't stay in your comfort zone step
[36:02] forward step on the word of
[36:04] God and it will come to
[36:08] pass Hallelujah so what is happening is
[36:15] that um braam talk about in the where
[36:20] Pentecost field and so many other places
[36:22] it just strike me only last week or
[36:25] two he's saying that
[36:30] what God
[36:32] revealed to Luther was 100%
[36:37] truth what God
[36:39] revealed to Methodist Wesley 100% truth
[36:45] to the Pentecostals 100% truth but the
[36:49] problem the trouble of it
[36:51] is when God reveal it to them they stay
[36:55] put over what God has revealed to them
[36:58] and put a hedge around them that this is
[37:01] what God has done they don't want
[37:04] nothing more but he said if they could
[37:06] have accepted what had God God has
[37:09] revealed to them and believe what he was
[37:12] going to continue to reveal it will have
[37:15] lead them to a better place but they
[37:18] just say God has revealed this and
[37:20] that's it but said if you could they
[37:23] could have recognized what God has done
[37:25] and what God was going to to reveal in
[37:28] the future and they were willing to
[37:30] accept what he was going to reveal in
[37:32] the future it will have been different
[37:36] and I'm afraid exact same thing is
[37:40] happening to some of the message
[37:42] Believers because God sent us a
[37:45] Vindicated Prophet his name is William
[37:48] myON Bram it has never happen on the
[37:52] face of this Earth how God used him
[37:56] people without an ball could get an
[37:58] eyeball people without even a food could
[38:00] get a food and he could design and see
[38:03] what you have done it wasn't him it was
[38:06] God using his prophet and it's never
[38:08] happened before and he God used him as
[38:12] the the what do you call the highest
[38:15] point of using
[38:17] anyone but the problem
[38:22] is all that God did through him is 100%
[38:26] true that said the Lord I believe with
[38:28] all my heart and ref feed on that word
[38:31] of God just like elazar finding Bride
[38:36] for Christ so God sent the prophet
[38:39] William Bram to find a spiritual bride
[38:42] for Christ amen and when if you read
[38:45] back elizar when elizar took Rebecca to
[38:50] Isaac it was a love affair between
[38:52] Rebecca and Isaac amen so what I'm
[38:55] trying to say that God sent us a
[38:57] Vindicated Prophet with that say the
[39:00] Lord and without the prophet none of the
[39:03] four five will have a message the
[39:05] serpent did everything God used him
[39:07] mightly what happened was that when God
[39:10] used him to that High Point like that
[39:13] just like the Lord Jesus Christ Ministry
[39:16] the first portion was the healing and
[39:20] second second pool was designing the
[39:23] heart of the people Jesus Christ
[39:25] Ministry the second pool was rebuking
[39:27] the fares and the sedu and when he was
[39:30] started rebuking them they didn't want
[39:31] nothing to do with him he said that um
[39:34] the son of man said that except eat of
[39:37] my My Flesh and drink of my blood you
[39:40] have no part in me they they walk away
[39:43] with him no more so is the prophet when
[39:46] he began to preach that the woman should
[39:47] not preach um the serpent marriage and
[39:51] divorce all those scriptures e going on
[39:54] the Pentecostal they not have to do with
[39:58] him again but God crowned him with a
[40:02] revealing of the seals when the people
[40:04] departed from him that was when God was
[40:07] was crowning his ministry but the point
[40:10] I'm trying to make is that he said I my
[40:12] inrease Christ must increase so God
[40:16] revealed all the truth God did all these
[40:18] things we we we we we love him we we
[40:23] Reverend everything he said but the the
[40:26] thing is mov moving on because God took
[40:29] him off the scene but he never took his
[40:32] spirit that same spirit is here A type
[40:36] Elijah in Elisha three si three pH of
[40:40] Elijah meeting um before Elisha before
[40:44] Elijah went there were three stages and
[40:48] the last stage was
[40:50] what when he gave him his mant he said
[40:53] that I want a double portion of your
[40:56] spirit and when Elijah took that mantle
[40:59] he cried and said where is the god of
[41:02] Elijah amen so we are not calling for
[41:05] Willam Braham to come back but we
[41:07] calling on the god of julam mar Braham
[41:10] to come and on the scene amen that's the
[41:13] God that you are serving the same God
[41:16] that was in the prophet that's the God
[41:17] we are calling on the SE just like
[41:19] Elijah said where is the god of Elijah
[41:22] amen he said and you give if you see me
[41:25] go it's hard if you see me go he put
[41:29] that where is the god of Elijah and then
[41:32] he got a double portion of his spirit so
[41:35] is Christ said that that um The Works
[41:38] that I do shall you also greater than
[41:40] this shall you do also double portion
[41:42] the bride that same God that was in the
[41:45] prophet is the bride now it's in the
[41:47] bride what doing exact same thing in a
[41:50] many member body he didn't die the
[41:53] spirit of God not die with the prophet
[41:56] that same spirit is here tonight that
[41:59] whatever you have need of if thou can
[42:01] believe I challenge you you can have it
[42:04] if you have confidence in the word of
[42:06] God that William Braham God is here the
[42:09] god of Elijah is here tonight to answer
[42:11] all your need if you sick he said by his
[42:14] stripes I was healed that was way done
[42:17] way back on 2,000 years ago you can
[42:19] accept your healing right now no matter
[42:22] what you are going through this is done
[42:24] on 2,000 years ago if Jesus was to be
[42:27] here he cannot even heal you because
[42:31] he's done it already it's done finished
[42:33] done capito is done
[42:38] already this is that deal it's up to you
[42:42] to what accept it and believe
[42:46] it and testify of
[42:49] it because we don't have to wait to see
[42:54] it before we
[42:55] testify that woman whose son was
[42:59] dead amen the prophet asked her is all
[43:04] well with you she said all is well even
[43:07] though her son was dead she didn't look
[43:10] at the death of her son she has
[43:12] confidence that Prophet that God used
[43:15] him to let her has that baby she was a
[43:19] baren she never asked for a son and if
[43:22] God could through that Prophet let her
[43:25] have a son even though that that son is
[43:27] there that same God of that Prophet is
[43:30] able to bring her son back to life so
[43:33] when they asked her is all well with you
[43:36] with your side she said all is well
[43:39] that's the confidence we have you have
[43:41] to have all the time the god that has
[43:43] brought us all this F that reveal
[43:46] himself to us deliver some of us from
[43:49] alcohol smoke and all human all that
[43:51] kind of spirit that God that deliver you
[43:54] would't he able to heal you tonight
[43:58] what he has done for you in the past
[44:01] he's the same yesterday today and
[44:03] forever don't let any situation look
[44:06] hard
[44:08] because the problem of faith is when you
[44:12] look and a situation and you analyze
[44:16] with only what your eyes see you're
[44:18] going to get in trouble I believe that's
[44:22] what happened to the children of Israel
[44:24] the 10
[44:25] spies they went to spy the
[44:29] land they saw the graves and the wines
[44:33] and everything and they saw the Giants
[44:37] of the people so they look at the Giants
[44:40] Too Tall and they look at them they like
[44:42] grass purose to them so their
[44:46] eyes they came to give an evil report
[44:49] because all that God did for them in
[44:54] Egypt he opened the Red Sea
[44:57] for them to pass through send them Mana
[45:00] to eat all these Miracles and they still
[45:04] doubted God about his
[45:07] promise
[45:10] and Joshua and
[45:13] Caleb they
[45:16] never believe or accept what their eyes
[45:20] was seeing by faith they have confidence
[45:24] that God is able to deliver them and
[45:26] give those people to them as they as God
[45:29] open the r seat to them those people are
[45:32] nothing to them because their God is
[45:34] more than able to defeat those enemies
[45:37] so Joshua and Caleb never doubted they
[45:40] still the how the people's heart be
[45:43] still and know that our God is God don't
[45:47] look at your eyes only what your eyes
[45:49] are seen look to the promise of God look
[45:53] to God's word and believe that every
[45:55] promise in that book it's your it's mine
[45:58] no matter what the circumstances may
[46:01] seem to appear God's word is Tru God
[46:04] Hest his word God keeps his word amen
[46:08] that word will come to pass regardless
[46:11] of whatever condition that you may find
[46:14] yourself inside in
[46:18] so those children of
[46:20] Israel they Rebel and God was going to
[46:24] destroy all of them
[46:27] but
[46:29] Moses even though the people were wrong
[46:32] as wrong can be Moses
[46:35] interceded that's the spirit of Christ
[46:38] in Moses and said God destroy me before
[46:41] you destroy the people so what am I
[46:43] saying the people out there might be
[46:45] wrong as strong could
[46:47] be
[46:49] Abraham the Sodom and gomorra their life
[46:53] was worse as worse could be but Abraham
[46:57] pleaded for them so the Mery seat is in
[47:00] the bright now it's you and me don't
[47:03] look at the condition of the people just
[47:06] speak for them just plead for them cry
[47:08] for them there might be one there that
[47:11] might be God's son no one that Steven
[47:14] couldn't
[47:15] even um do anything because after he was
[47:18] being
[47:20] stoned he said father forgive them they
[47:23] didn't know what they are doing and Paul
[47:25] was standing there
[47:27] and Paul that God used to replace
[47:30] because
[47:31] remember when
[47:35] Judas betrayed God and they have to
[47:39] replace him the people voted they vote
[47:43] for Matas but the B say he didn't do
[47:45] nothing but Paul was a murderer when
[47:49] have anger and everything but that was
[47:51] God's choice amen so stepen couldn't say
[47:56] anything
[47:57] that will Hur Paul but the spirit of
[48:01] compassion Spirit of Christ in steeven
[48:04] he said father forgive them don't hold
[48:07] anything against them so that same
[48:10] Spirit of Christ is in the bride and if
[48:13] it's in the bride what does it do it
[48:15] call for
[48:16] Mercy Mercy Mercy the people are wrong
[48:20] as wrong can be one time the prophet me
[48:23] somebody and his and his girlfriend was
[48:25] going to make a love and the spirit
[48:27] asked him say whatever you want and he
[48:30] said in the name of Jesus let them
[48:32] repent they repent and make things right
[48:36] so I'm not condoning sin but all I'm
[48:39] saying is that with the spirit of Christ
[48:42] it always what
[48:44] intercede for the people for your
[48:47] children no matter how you see them do
[48:49] wrong we have the power of God to change
[48:52] things don't look at what they are doing
[48:54] see what the words I used to them
[48:58] because whatever you speak will come to
[49:00] pass amen so we have to watch our
[49:04] way people around us they might be wrong
[49:08] as wrong can be even on our
[49:10] work people do certain things very bad
[49:14] but let's pray for them because God can
[49:16] turn them around and they can be good
[49:18] friends to you on the job side don't
[49:20] just fight on every little thing just
[49:23] have compassion on them amen they don't
[49:25] know what they are doing amen sometimes
[49:27] even God allowed them to test you to
[49:30] test your patient to try your patient to
[49:33] see your
[49:35] reaction amen one time the prophet of
[49:38] God saw
[49:40] somebody at the
[49:42] bar doing all kind of
[49:44] stuff he was so angry he said how can
[49:47] you allow this to
[49:49] live wipe it wipe her out from the face
[49:52] of the Earth and God brought him back
[49:56] and saw what God has been doing for him
[49:59] and he oh God thank you for your blood
[50:02] for covering my sin for your blood
[50:04] covering my sin but said you want me to
[50:06] kill I forgive you want me to wipe her
[50:08] on the face of this Earth so we must
[50:11] have compassion on the people don't be
[50:14] quick to
[50:17] judge I'm not saying that we condone
[50:20] sin but don't be quick to judge let God
[50:23] lead you let him direct you and know who
[50:26] when to be a lion and when to be a lamb
[50:30] there has to be a balance in everything
[50:33] that we are doing but it's the Life of
[50:36] Christ when that Life of Christ project
[50:38] you it gives life to the people it give
[50:41] grace to the people you are
[50:43] representative of Christ tonight
[50:45] whatever you said will come to
[50:48] pass in my name shall cast out Devils
[50:51] when you lay your hands on the S they
[50:53] shall recover he said that the works
[50:55] that I do shall you also there will be I
[50:58] said I'll be with you even in you until
[51:02] what the consumation of time he's the
[51:05] same yesterday today and forever amen
[51:11] Our God hasn't changed hallelujah our
[51:13] God is good all the time he's God that
[51:17] never lose a battle he's a he's a
[51:21] physician that never lost a never lost a
[51:23] patient and he is all Al
[51:28] um he's a lawyer that never lose a case
[51:32] he's the same yesterday today and
[51:35] forever amen so what am I trying to say
[51:39] it was a love affair between Rebecca and
[51:42] Isaac so now is a love affair between
[51:47] the bride of
[51:49] Christ and the
[51:52] groom yes the spirit and the bride will
[51:56] say exact same thing he here Elijah God
[52:01] is here amen hallelujah God has in
[52:04] change he's the same yesterday today and
[52:08] forever hallelujah hallelujah amen
[52:11] praise God thank you Jesus amen so what
[52:15] am I trying to
[52:17] say
[52:19] when those people was strong as strong
[52:22] can be Moses interceded for them
[52:28] and Joshua and Caleb they to by God's
[52:32] word and they stand by that
[52:36] and what is it is that we have to be
[52:41] sure of our decision making because
[52:44] decisions are very very
[52:48] vital
[52:49] amen and every that we make we going to
[52:53] what rip out of
[52:55] it and bad or good you you are where you
[52:59] are today based on decision you made
[53:02] about four five years ago and that same
[53:05] God is here God that was in elazar that
[53:10] that led elizar to find Rebeca has led
[53:13] the prophet to find this so what am I
[53:15] trying to say um here in the sign of
[53:20] this time bra said
[53:23] that that I made a point that
[53:28] where Pentecost F where the um the
[53:33] Luther and all the RO because they made
[53:36] um
[53:38] what they said God has revealed this to
[53:40] us that's it they didn't move forward
[53:43] from what God has said that if they
[53:45] could have accept every more what God
[53:47] would have do have been different and
[53:49] here he said that and now we have left
[53:53] Pentecostal
[53:54] age now we are coming coming to where
[53:57] like in the pyramid not the pyramid
[54:01] doctrines now but I mean like as the
[54:04] pyramid The
[54:05] Headstone when it comes to Faith is got
[54:08] to be
[54:11] whole there's got to be a Ministry in
[54:14] the church the True Church of the Living
[54:17] God to where when The Headstone comes
[54:19] Christ or the ministry of Christ and
[54:22] Christ will fit right in together
[54:25] perfectly
[54:27] then that brings back the redeemed to
[54:29] take the whole house of God to Glory the
[54:32] Methodist the Baptist and Presbyterian
[54:34] through the great Reformation ages that
[54:36] come out and gave their life in
[54:38] persecution and thanks for the kingdom
[54:40] of God but that Stone is coming yes sir
[54:44] it certainly will come God will send it
[54:47] it will fit all the building together
[54:50] upon it see now we see these signs as
[54:53] you see the ministry from Christ
[54:55] beginning to narrow up now to complete
[54:57] the ministry of Christ in the fullness
[55:00] of the holy spirit amen so what is
[55:03] trying to say that it becomes
[55:07] narrow when it gets The Headstone is no
[55:10] more a
[55:11] man remember all the seals he preached
[55:16] this six when it came the seven seal he
[55:19] didn't there's nothing to talk about it
[55:22] so it's no more man is God himself that
[55:26] will take you the cstone nobody can take
[55:29] you there to that pyramid and is God
[55:32] alone that will take you there and his
[55:34] name is the Lord Jesus Christ a man
[55:37] cannot take you there he going to come
[55:39] and Whisper to you like the way he
[55:42] whisper to H and all those people and
[55:45] and and eser in their ears God has to
[55:48] whisper God has to bring you that nobody
[55:51] can take you to the top of the pyramid
[55:53] it's God himself it's no man and mind
[55:56] Ministry he has left from the seventh
[55:59] age to the eighth age Eternal Church age
[56:01] Christ himself the hope of glory in the
[56:04] a leading his people the son of man
[56:08] being revealed again in the bright form
[56:11] amen hallelujah that same year remember
[56:14] the last time he did to Sodom before
[56:18] Sodom was destroyed he reveal himself to
[56:22] Abraham yes he did he did and if that
[56:26] thing has happened God and the world is
[56:30] in Sodom that we never
[56:33] seen sodomy people coming out from their
[56:36] closet right until when lot when those
[56:41] two angels went there and they came out
[56:43] open and if you see all those things

[57:15] home we don't condone it we don't like
[57:18] it we speak against it but we can't
[57:20] fight it right because the prophet that

[57:25] amen so all that you have to that God is
[57:27] revealing himself to us the people out
[57:30] there are condoning that and doing but
[57:33] we Christ is revealing himself more and
[57:37] more and more to his children amen

[58:17] eye to see the one that we love the one
[58:20] that you have talking about all these
[58:22] years the Lord Jesus Christ one day our
[58:24] eyes going to be pop open
[58:26] with a twink of right going to be
[58:28] changed to see him to beet the Lord in
[58:30] the air that's our
[58:33] promise that's our promise listen we are
[58:37] not going to face death I believe it
[58:40] with all my heart in the Dark Ages they
[58:43] gave their life for this gospel they
[58:46] killed them they turned them a sender
[58:48] they cut their head of They Crucified
[58:51] them they did everything to them it was
[58:53] an us
[58:54] anointing but but in our time an eagle
[58:58] anointing we are not going to die amen
[59:01] recently maybe you guys have come across
[59:04] it I read about the man that through him
[59:09] we have have decided to follow Jesus I
[59:12] know maybe most of have read about the
[59:14] story and the story goes like in the
[59:17] 18th century or the 19th century 18
[59:20] something
[59:22] missionaries they went to
[59:25] India to talk about the Lord Jesus
[59:27] Christ and there was a chief over
[59:31] there who didn't receive them so this
[59:36] man sneak away and follow the king
[59:41] follow the missionaries to hear what
[59:44] they have to say and he received the
[59:47] Lord Jesus Christ he received the
[59:49] message they brought to him and he began
[59:51] to talk about the Lord Jesus Christ and
[59:54] the chief was so angry
[59:57] the chief told
[59:59] him and make a gathering and said I'm
[1:00:04] going to kill your children if you do
[1:00:07] not
[1:00:08] renounce this
[1:00:11] gospel and he said I have decided to
[1:00:14] follow Jesus I'm not going to renounce
[1:00:18] he killed his
[1:00:20] sons and
[1:00:22] then he show him his wife I'm killing
[1:00:26] your wife if you do not renounce this
[1:00:29] gospel he said that the world before me
[1:00:33] the cross before me I'm not going to
[1:00:35] renounce they kill his wife and he said
[1:00:39] I'm going to kill you
[1:00:42] too he said the world before me I've
[1:00:46] decided to follow Jesus I'm not turning
[1:00:49] back and the king killed
[1:00:52] him so after he killed him the king
[1:00:56] begin to
[1:00:57] think what kind of power what kind of
[1:01:01] spirit that this man have that he could
[1:01:05] witness me killing his sons killing his
[1:01:08] daughter his wife and himself and the
[1:01:11] King was so consumed by the power of God
[1:01:14] and the faith that this man had in such
[1:01:17] a way that he embraced that Christianity
[1:01:20] and the whole village they took Christ
[1:01:23] and accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as
[1:01:25] their personal because that man stood
[1:01:28] for the Lord Jesus Christ we have to
[1:01:31] stand for the Lord and we have been
[1:01:33] enjoying that song I've decided to
[1:01:35] follow Jesus no matter what happened
[1:01:38] because someone gave his life amen we
[1:01:42] have to give our life for this gospel if
[1:01:44] it's
[1:01:45] true amen if it's not true let's leave
[1:01:49] it and go and enjoy the world for a

[1:01:56] support it with everything within us our
[1:01:58] mind our soul our spirit everything to

[1:04:38] because the bride is still
[1:04:40] here amen so what am I saying as
[1:04:46] Abraham pleaded for the people in
[1:04:50] L let's go for The Lost Ones amen let's
[1:04:56] continue to go for the lost ones because
[1:04:59] once the last one gets in we gone the
[1:05:03] door is s and if you don't go after them
[1:05:06] and we become lazy we are not going
[1:05:09] because remember God cannot do anything
[1:05:13] but you you are the hands of God you are
[1:05:16] representative of God it's you God is W
[1:05:19] because remember in somewhere in Hebrews
[1:05:23] he said that all those
[1:05:26] they what they are waiting on
[1:05:28] us they were son Ascender they will do
[1:05:31] this all those fa by faith Able by faith
[1:05:35] this by faith that by faith that but
[1:05:37] they all waiting on us you are the last
[1:05:39] one the last baton that God has put his
[1:05:42] confidence in you and in me to ride the
[1:05:45] trail once more so let's ask God if you
[1:05:49] don't have that Spirit of
[1:05:51] witnessing I so happy on Friday when
[1:05:55] that prayer request came and you could
[1:05:57] see how God is dealing with every
[1:06:00] individual everyone witnessing here and
[1:06:03] there amen because it's it's a gleaning
[1:06:07] time it's a gleaning time now I
[1:06:10] understand but you could see everyone is
[1:06:12] doing his part and that God is here
[1:06:14] tonight let's take the world to the
[1:06:18] world Amen and don't just keep it all to
[1:06:21] ourselves don't worry what the people
[1:06:24] will say don't worry about what they
[1:06:26] will see if it's for
[1:06:27] them they will get it because remember
[1:06:31] it's not
[1:06:32] you all that the father has given to me
[1:06:36] will come to me so our business is just
[1:06:39] to tell like Phillip invited Nathaniel
[1:06:43] come and see that's what we have to tell
[1:06:46] them that's our portion the rest is not
[1:06:50] in our hands and none of us can even add
[1:06:53] a stature a had to his St whatever you
[1:06:57] going to fulfill you can't fulfill more
[1:06:59] than what God has ordained for you you
[1:07:01] can't fulfill more you can't fulfill
[1:07:03] less so let don't look at one another
[1:07:07] but look at what God wants to do through
[1:07:10] you individually because we are not the
[1:07:13] same according to what the measure of
[1:07:15] Faith he gave some this he gave some
[1:07:18] that so your portion that God wants you
[1:07:22] to fulfill that's what you have to ask
[1:07:24] him no what God is fulfilling through
[1:07:26] Des fulfill what God want to do through
[1:07:29] you what will you have me to do that's
[1:07:33] the most important thing so I think
[1:07:35] that's I have for tonight anony can you
[1:07:37] please come and then let's end it amen
[1:07:42] praise God hallelujah
[1:07:45] hallelujah amen our god is awesome he's
[1:07:48] the same yesterday today and forever
