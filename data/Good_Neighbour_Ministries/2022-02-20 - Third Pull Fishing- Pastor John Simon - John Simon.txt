of god and i'm so glad to be here in the house of god and i will not take a lot of preliminary talk but i'll go right to the word and if there's anything i need to say then i'll say it afterwards welcome to the house of the lord and welcome in the presence of god amen every one of you we thank god for his marvelous wonderful grace hallelujah amen okay let's read from god's word john chapter 21 and we are going to read from 1 to 40. and today i'm just going to talk about fishing no it's i know it's a funny subject but we want to talk about fishing because it's getting on to that time now the year so i got to turn your attention away from all the things that are going on and everything else as long as none of you were up in ottawa and uh anything of that nature but you keep your feet on the ground being spiritual and walking in the light amen praise the lord those things are not our things we just look at them and see them happening all around us scriptures being fulfilled the word of god come in the past and we just stay away from that sort of thing and we stay right within the confines of god's word amen that's where we are praise the lord hallelujah doesn't mean that we are disinterested because he says watch so so it's not that we're disinterested but we don't get ourselves caught up into those things because we know they must happen things will wax worse and worse and anybody that tells you i'm going to make things better and better we know they're lying right because the master himself said it'll wax worse and worse and say oh i'm going to chicken in every pot every household will have every no the poor you will have with you always till i come back right so those are things that we just know that will happen praise the lord amen out of the word of god john chapter 21 reading from verse one after these things jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise shoe himself there were together simon peter thomas called didymus and nathaniel of cana in galilee the sons of zebedee and two other disciples simon peter said unto them i go fishing they say unto him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing but when the morning the sun rose of course when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus then jesus said unto them children have you any meat they answered him no and he said unto them cast thy net on the right side of the ship and you shall find and they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes therefore the disciple whom jesus loves said unto peter it is the lord now when peter heard that it was the lord he got his fish's coat upon him for he was naked and it cast himself into the sea and the other disciples came in i wish a lot of believers would do that in the sea of the word of god just throw your self-abundant self and everything else and just jump into the sea and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were 200 cubits drop dragging the net with fishes and as soon as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals and there and fish laying there on and bread and jesus said unto them bring of the fish which you now caught simon went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes 153 and for all there was so many yet was not the net broken this net can't be broken jesus said unto them come and die and none of the disciples just asked him who art thou knowing that it was the lord by then they knew it was the lord indeed jesus then cometh and take it bread give it them and fish this is now the third time that jesus showed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead lord jesus we thank you for thy word we pray that you will bless your people as we gather here together in your wonderful and precious name amen and amen god bless you please be seated as i said to you you know i want to talk about fishing praise god and uh you know [Music] i thank god that i've always loved fishing since i was a boy of about 10 years old i love fishing and you who are here you know spring is on the way how many knows that we're in february but spring is on the way and um as i said as a year old boy i love to hear to go fishing and hear the whispers of the wind just rustling through the trees and that white voice that came from out of the wind as if some one was talking with me and during those times i was a kind of a not kind of i was a loner and spent many many long hours alone with the wind and in the by the streams i got punished for that many times because you're spending whole day nobody knows where you're gone and you're wandering in the woods which you know animals there see snakes passing through the trees and things like that and not bothered by it and and so quiet the fish jumping in the streams you know and splashing around having a great wonderful time many years passed with that and then i god led me by his spirit here into canada and i still love fishing i didn't lose my love of fishing by coming to canada i still love to fish and so i made a lot of trips up into northern ontario and some brothers seated right here can remember a few can remember some of those trips where we went up uh by brother gee's aunt's place there on lake tamagomi and uh spent many summers going up there the men some men in the church many of the men in the church going up to this lake and we'd go up there fishing i'm looking at her brother brian here and the trick i pulled on him while we were up there in the tent you know i kind of came in and scraped like it was a beers on the outside of the tent and got them all worked up anyway so we were having great grand wonderful times there going fishing together and um one of the trips we made was also up on the french river we stayed in a lodge in the french river there and went fishing every day every day we would go out fishing and come back but you know i always love fishing also for perch how many knows what what what's a perch okay well i love fishing for perch and as a result i used to go with brother don jukes which was a young brother um an executive for the maple leafs at the time one of the controlling executors uh executives and uh he was his son and he's the one that had heard me in alberta and when he got here he had talked about the message to a few people and they believed but he didn't know what else to tell them so he invited me to come and this church is a result of that not going through the long thing of that but that's what happened but we used to go to the niagara gorge uh with with uh with our implements and began to fish and we would be catching tons and tons of perch and my there's nothing like having a bunch of fried portion just one after the other they're going down and they were just lovely fish praise god but one year i began to taste the chemicals i tasted chemicals in the fish and i said this is a simon i said that's it i'm not going back there anymore that's long before the government even announced about these companies dumping chemicals into the lake but it was already catching in the fish and i tasted in the fish and we stopped going and catching any fish there but it was wonderful long lonely hours spent there uh together praise god now you know that fishing is a wonderful thing to do how many knows that it's a wonderful thing to do listen to brother branham now it's hot and we're going fishing and you know the lord don't lock any time to a man when he is fishing you don't get any older while you are fishing now you girls you are to go to [Laughter] you ought to go with them amen see and i'll come down and i'll join you if i can oh the good lord don't lock time to a man when he's out fishing do a lot of it when you feel like when you get all twisted up that's the best thing to get you to relax it's the best thing that i ever found in my life is for me to go fishing see that's the way it is there was a gentleman i knew up in new albany his name was mr trout man and he had a little card on it and on the card were written these two words out fishing every time man would get to him he'd have that card out fishing man is closer to god when he's out fishing when man is out fishing rich and poor are all the same when they are out fishing see oh my i'll tell you another fishing i've been doing anyway but i've been doing that for the last 33 years has been fishing for the souls of men may the lord help us to win everyone that we can oh praise god friends i want to take for a subject today third pull fishing now you know that was natural fishing that i loved brother branham loved and he encouraged us to do a lot of fishing let me not just let me just outline something here quickly some benefits of of going fishing one your perception of time changes when you're out fishing you lose sense of time you break into a little edge of eternity when you go fishing and also like he said it gives you peace of mind relaxation and lastly it helps to prolong your life when you go fishing right so fishing is very important that doesn't mean that this summer i'm every this church is going to become a fishing church and everybody is going to be running everywhere but fishing is very very good for you praise the lord god bless brother paul and mark and whoever wherever they are now they must be shouting hallelujah because they always love fishing but they don't know why amen but fishing is a very good thing to do but you see the one who puts his stamp upon it is the lord jesus himself because jesus himself loved fishing praise god and uh he called out his first disciples from where the fisher man you see these men whose occupation it was to catch fish jesus called them first as his disciples because he himself loved fishing praise god but you see the fish that he loved was a different kind of fish because the first fish he caught when he came to earth was some fisherman he was a fisher not of regular fish but he was a fisher of man and god wants us to be fishers of men not only to go about catching a whole lot of fish baskets of it big ones small ones but he wants us to catch man wherever we are praise god catch them with the word of god praise the lord jesus christ hallelujah so who was the great fisherman peter no jesus is the great fisherman jesus christ himself is the great fisherman don't let your eyes be diverted in any way because it's not peter that was the great fisherman but jesus christ is the great fisherman indeed peter was a great fisherman but he is not the great fisherman the great fisherman is jesus christ follow me and i will make you fishers of men how many of you want to follow him praise god everybody in here wants to continue to follow him matthew chapter 4 praise the lord when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he departed onto galilee leaving nazareth and dwelt in capernaum which was upon the sea coast in the borders of zebulun and neptalim and it might that it might be fulfilled that which was spoken by isaias the prophet saying the land of zabulon the land of not telling by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles the people which suck in darkness have saw great light unto them which sat in the regions and the shadow of death light is sprung up from that time jesus began to preach the kingdom repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren hallelujah and god bless those of us who were able to go to israel because we were we actually went to the spot and the big rock is there where jesus actually went and roasted the fish uh and gave to them and of course a big uh church they built on the shore away from there but the rock is still there and um we find that jesus called peter and andrew his brother casting a net in the sea for they were fishers and he said unto them follow me and i will make you fishes of men verse 22 and immediately they left the ship they left their father and they followed him praise god hallelujah praise the name of the lord jesus christ thank god i love fishing the disciples love fishing jesus loved fishing we come down we find that brother branham love fishing and often would go off fishing and we know as a natural fisherman he was a great fisher everybody tells about it that he was a great fisherman naturally speaking and when it comes to spiritual fishing he was the greatest fisherman that we have ever had outside of the lord himself he is the greatest fisherman let me use the modern term evangelists that the world has ever seen so operating in that office and gift of the 20th century prophet and the evangelist he had great success and blessings of god that came upon him bringing millions and millions of people into these denominations because he was under inspiration of the first pull and the second pose but spiritually though he was a prophet and even though he was the greatest evangelist under that first and second pull of the seventh church age we know that he didn't really know how to fish for god's elect for god's rainbow trout for god's big fish he didn't know that kind of fishing but when it comes to evangelism for spoiled second book oh he was a master of that and god used him in a mighty way because he was only doing first and second pull fishing that appeal to the senses and stuff like that but now the angel came to him and says you don't know how to fish you don't know how a man that is a master of fishing in the natural is being told by the angel of god you don't know how to fish let me teach you how to fish because this is a kind of a different fishing you're not fishing for fish to eat you're not fishing for for any natural fish you're fishing to find god's elect it might be the last one in the lake it might be five in that lake it might be fifty maybe a hundred maybe a thousand in the lake but you are only heat up to look for the elected bride of jesus christ in your day in your hour your time the spirit of god and the anointing now is not a forceful check and pull anointing but the anointing of the third toe that appeals to that bright class of saints the rainbow trout that is being fished out of the of the great uh sea of god in this day and in this hour he didn't know how to fish amen for god's elect for god's lost attributes for god's lost genes just passing over a thought there you can't you can't say something is lost if somebody didn't have it somebody had to own it and have it before it could be lost and jesus said i am come to seek and to save them that are lost hallelujah amen you have a lot of sheep of the house all of israel believers and believing but that's wonderful what i come to seek and save them that are lost whosoever will may come but i'm looking for the elected seed the genuine elect of god the genes of god sons and daughters of god come from the mind of god those are the ones that i come to see conceive hallelujah sons and daughters in the last day lost in this little dish and darkness wondering about not knowing what they are to do who they are where they come from all their purpose in life amen and wandering around in unbelief oh my praise god hallelujah oh brother sister i thank god for his grace and for his goodness now he's talking about one morning he lay on his bed and he was just talking to his wife he said sister meter was on one side of the bed i was on the other side of the bed and we were just talking away early that morning and suddenly the vision atmosphere vision came upon him he says here and i he showed me a vision of a panoramic view of people i never seen i was talking to my wife while i was going into the vision now you people know i'm not a fanatic i don't say them things unless they are truth amen see then after a while i couldn't hear or hear her or see her and i but when i looked i seen brother argent standing there and he said brother billy will give out all the prayer cards everything is ready now for the meeting i will go take you in amen and i said thank you brother now this is the first time the message has ever been given right out here through the microphone to the people right this will go into all them religious papers like voice of healing herald of is coming and all like that and in some glorious day when it's all over i'm long gone we'll meet around his throne at what time we will what a time you'll have remember it's not just me out there in the service i have just a little part to do with it it's you back there amen he realized by then he is leaving right he only introduce it and he just have a little part in it and he has to move out but it's the rest of you back there that are coming you'd want this really is going to i just see that amen praise god hallelujah now i'm speaking from the message called what is a vision and that will be the background because really now i'm beginning to speak right and what is a vision now i don't expect you to understand this what i'm saying now i'm quoting him now brother brown but you see you there's something there but we'll understand when we meet face to face with jesus and you you and his cameras like that you understand why he stammers because that angel already tell him don't tell nobody don't say nothing about this it can't be impersonated amen remember it's all this is on the word amen but with that vision i seen two little dark-faced children come moving pulling a little wagon and i said sweetheart look here and she said what are you talking about you see i could hear her i could hear her but i couldn't answer her while in the vision and these little children were walking towards me little kind of long hair black dark eyes brown face walking up to me and i seen them amen see so that's what it was and which way shall i go i said to the brother and he said just keep walking amen keep on and i kept walking and soon i walked past all them other ministers you listen i i don't want to break into all these little little passing things right and when i walked further i came into a great panorama right seated worth thousands and thousands of people and then i heard somebody say i heard a voice say the meeting is dismissed and i said well who can dismiss it amen who can dismiss it and why is it dismissed and that's what happened it was dismissed what he didn't understand is that god was allowing the first and second pull to come to their end it doesn't mean they're gone because it will that will always follow the bride as god's people that will all we don't follow after science but the signs follow us because we believe it just comes because it has to be there to manifest and to demonstrate god in his word and in his people praise the lord he said and when that happened when that meeting was dismissed suddenly it began to sprinkle rain hallelujah oh thank god brothers back then it was sprinkling that was just like elijah being in the in the cave and saying i see the coming of the abundance of rain hallelujah it's sprinkling now but it's going to be a great big rainfall amen praise god hallelujah and then i went further into the vision and i was standing there you know with a little baby's shoe amen how many knows what a shoe is for a shoe is something to aid you with your walk or in walk in right so uh something that will help the people with their walk with god but god is showing that they their babies now but you you've got to start letting them see the fullness of this thing um but you try you can't listen to those big truths you can't lace it with all those massive things it's got to start little by little right praise god so he said they only had little bitty islets they can only take so much because they come up on the pentecostal denomination you don't mind me talking like this amen all right great see these were ones that did not have on a little booty you know what's a booty you know when the women just make those little uh he sees there these were ones that already had on a shoe but it was a baby's shoe amen and i had this in my hand to lace this little eight of an inch hole and i was trying to push a half inch right part of that string through the half inch that eighth of an inch eyelet see and the treads were breaking all over he was messing up things right causing all kinds of impersonations and things like that and trying to lace it like that anyway then i heard someone behind me say don't you understand you can't teach babies and he left out the word pentecostal but he said you can't teach babies supernatural things i looked around and it was behind me and i recognized the voice that spoke with me and he said you're using the wrong end of the string amen and i look down at the end of the string laying on the floor and the other end was a nice eighth of an inch so i told him i understand in other words he understands god hides in simplicity and reveals himself in the same why are you trying to bring all those heavy things on them when they're just babies start from god's hiding in simplicity with the little things and little by little lace the shoe right okay praise god he says and soon when i told him i understood and i reached down to pick up that string i was taken up in the spirit mark this down watch this will come to pass as i reach down i was taken up and when i come to i was standing by the side of a beautiful lake with blue clear water hallelujah and it's so pretty and i saw all the fish small big fish swimming around in that beautiful lake hallelujah i'm so glad that no matter the muddy nonsense that was out there in this message somehow god gave his elected children of god the vision to be able to see clearly in the word of god and to be able to move through all the things in the word of god to this day many of them don't even realize that god allowed brother branham himself to say things that will throw them off on the tangent like he said in unveiling of god he says oh many of the things i said and done were deliberately said and done amen to make some go out to make others come in to make some wonder praise god and others to believe praise the lord jesus hallelujah amen he said didn't the lord jesus do the same thing when he spoke in parables deliberately to blind some and others to open their eyes my god brothers we're in the midst of it right now by this word of god this hour and the time we're living in hallelujah praise god let me let me just stop here a minute from another another time he was telling the same vision he said when he walked in and they said the meeting is dismissed just before he dis they dismissed it was just enough they just run around quickly and they took up the offerings he said how come the meeting is dismissed already you know there's been no preaching no work nothing gone forth they said oh that's all right we already got the offering we already got the offering you see my friends i'm not preaching on that i just pass that that you can go look at you can search it yourself the emphasis in these groups these the denominations and these people even in this message they're emphasizing now they're offering the tithes taking up the tithes taking up the offering and they don't see the emphasis on the word of god amen even the people don't see it hallelujah they get the fed up disgusted and they are identifying themselves because they they're showing they don't have the real test on the inside that they're living by the ever-present water in the rock but in the other ones for a second full and the brook dried up there was no more supply because that phase was over and done with but when i got to that lake there were some fishermen all around the lake and he said them fishermen are really ministers ministers out there looking for fish just like you amen there knows in other words i'm talking now they know something is going on they know what it is so they start fishing uh take the meaning and the thoughts of that word in all of its ramifications they start fishing around they start questioning this believer asking over there presuming over there trying to look under this rock look over there to find out what is going on but this is not the first and second poll this will not my friends be impersonated you can't even tell what happened to you you just know you're seeing something the perfect realization has struck your soul you can't escape it you haven't got him now he has got you i haven't got the holy ghost the holy ghost has got all of me i am now a prisoner of jesus christ by the power of the holy spirit oh blessed be the name of the lord god hallelujah amen oh my you see they wanted to catch fish too great big beautiful rainbow trout were out there in that lake oh my and then i said to him i know this is a vision but i don't understand all about this all about this trout and i'm quoting him here he said i don't understand what it is about my catching the trout see but he said you know but i said you know i believe right down in my heart that i can catch those ones also amen not only them under the first second ball but i can catch these ones also other ministers were trying to catch those rainbow trout hallelujah but you see they really couldn't catch them all they could do is keep catching small fish because the rainbow trout is a type of elect and the rainbow trousers exactly that it's a fish with a covenant promise from the living god hallelujah and they could not catch those fish praise god hallelujah because these were ones with a covenant promised brother amen who am i so i picked up the string but now all of a sudden the string that was in my hand turned into a fishing pole it wasn't just a string no more hallelujah but it turned into a fishing pole see and there it was hallelujah praise god you couldn't go just like a string like that to catch trout so now you got to have something so he was not gonna go into third pool fishing are you following me where the team is from now uh he's doing third pull fishing now and god says you know you can't do that with a string you got to have a rod to be able to catch these fish these rainbow trout hallelujah praise god and then the one behind me said i'll teach you how to fish which is in a backhanded we're saying you don't know how to catch these fish let me teach you how to catch these fish amen and then tie under lure and so on throw way out i want you to throw it way out in the deep for them praise god because these ones here not going with no shallow shallow stuff no soup mix and all this stuff no these ones want to go out in the deep amen praise god so you got to throw out there where they are ready in the deep to catch those fish amen so he says now i throw it out there and i then he says when you throw it out to that deep then you've got to let your lure sink down first hallelujah that's the word that you've been hearing all these years in the message let that sink down in them first and when the words sink down in them first amen then you start pulling them slowly or lead them slowly into this turtle slowly you pull along and then they'll come right over right he said now that's good fisherman's technique now he says when you do that you'll begin to feel some nibbles hallelujah oh thank god brother i follow the message as you know since uh i mean let me say it from 14 years old and i've been following the message and always at every stage the holy spirit he led me to that point i didn't even know about brother branham but yet casting out a devil out of somebody and the devil began to speak in towns and the holy spirit said see thomas is not the evidence of the holy spirit praise god so when i got the message and the prophet said that that just comes amen i knew that he was right hallelujah praise god not me confirming that he was right but god put it in me long before coming with the message so that i could accept the rest of it knowing that it's going to be the truth because that's right hallelujah praise god i was already praying amen in the dark room of the assembly of god bible school down there in south america and [Music] while we're praying the desire for in us to pray and ask god because we have seen that stuff women preaching you know tongue speaking and then casting all the devil out of those people afterwards great religious singers from england and america come down and singing like an angel and then back of the scenes when we get with them and begin to pray with them it's devils having gifts like that that were singing and entertaining and everything else under the guise of religion so god was just bleaching out those things so we began to pray lord god what is going on what's happening to pentecost lord show me what is beyond pentecost it was just only a month after that that this old man who was considered to be a prophet down there amen go across the country and tell you you're going to be your son you this you that and the denominations knew him but they hated him because it would always come to pass they hated and they didn't like him amen but they couldn't deny who he was so all of them wanted him to be around them but they wouldn't let him preach because somehow he believed in baptizing in the name of jesus christ and he only believed in one god and that's all he knew and that's all he was teaching with the rest of what was upon him anointing him and he was a great person that we pray did a lot of praying with at the time before coming into the message so when the message came to him being that he couldn't read and write that very well uh he always would come to me and you know to write letters or do this and do that so he came and slipped the two books under my door you know because i was at uh the bible school and studying and when i came home there were the two books and i read them the rest is history praise the name of the lord hallelujah but you see my brothers god has his own plan he makes you start to needle because the first thing i caught was there's only one god jesus of the new testament is jehovah the old testament i caught that i start nibbling at that praise the lord then he goes on to another little truth that nibble like that keep nibbling here nibbling there pieces all around the message amen nibbling around hallelujah praise god and i thank god you're others of you that were always nibbling on the word something and you having a hunger and a thirst that was bringing you and pulling you into the presence of almighty god hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah oh my you see he started something in you where you knew there's got to be something in the word itself hallelujah for a little bit he says pull slowly don't pull hard and then it'll this he said and then when you pull slowly it will begin to pull itself away from all the rest of them little fish seemingly the message will seem like it's pulling away from the little fish and when it begins to pull away the little fish will scatter they'll scatter away from you because what you're talking now is different from what they hear different from what they know praise god but he said they will scatter but listen when them little fish scatter that will attract the attention of the big fish and they'll gather and they'll grab at this amen praise god my brothers isn't that what's happening right now across the little fish to scatter away and cause the big fish the rainbow trout the redeem gathering in washed like the snow free from all sin shouting praising god and gathering [Applause] that you put out there amen i'm grabbing at it right now every day i'm grabbing more when i'm done preaching here every sunday i don't even know what's coming next i didn't know this was coming i didn't know the other message was coming i have to leave here in faith believing that god will give me something else to say to you amen because i know i got to preach to eagles when the eagles the illegals got their eyes on you oh man you can't come with no chicken soup to feed them no sir you've got to come with the water called the power of the holy spirit amen and only god himself can do that it's a reveal his own word hallelujah oh my he said you see just grabbed a hold of it and that's what happened to us we've seen it we're seeing something and you grab a hold of it and when you grab a hold of it at first when this began to break on me i start to wonder but you know lord this if this is so you you're gonna have to prove it you're gonna have to demonstrate it for me to be able to see more and god began to do it but while he's doing it he opened the eyes of somebody else somebody else somebody else and then that began to strengthen me and give me confidence that this is the sea of the lord he says amen then i pulled the whole lure out of the water and when i did it like that i caught a fish you see but because he said pull slow and i did a big jerk right he's so anxious for everybody to come into what he had and what he could see he tried to jerk the whole thing jerk us in you don't jerk nobody and you can't bring nobody in the holy spirit has to bring you in the holy spirit has to open your eyes of your heart the holy spirit has revealed to you praise god hallelujah oh my and so because i jerked i pulled the whole lure out of the water and i caught a fish but when i looked it was just a little fish and i said oh my and just then the one who was talking behind me stepped around in front of me it was him it was the angel of the lord and he had his hands folded and he looked at me and said you did just what i told you not to do right and i said yes sir that's right he said you see the first pull when i gave that to you was when you used to put your hands on the people and tell them what was their troubles then the second pull was when i let you know what was the secrets of their hearts just like i told you and said instead of you keeping that to yourself hallelujah he's not talking about the third pull huh he's telling him about his action of going and talking about this now he's trying to say you begin to try to explain to them all about it telling all kinds of things to the people and when you did you didn't know nothing about it yourself you didn't know nothing but the turtle you didn't know what was coming and you went talking about the fourth and second poll and explaining to them some of it right that's when brother branham was in those years talking about the senses senses of the body five senses uh you know and then the five senses of the spirit uh imagination and you know that sort of stuff like that and then he'd go off and he started talking about the soul and the different and then you got people with the soul gone off people with those senses gone off evangelists go off trying to discern and trying to get visions in the same way by their human effort and stuff like that amen see oh my you see and he said you didn't know nothing about his yourself amen see oh my you began to explain you begin to explain about what it is to be a seer how you come you got your conscience but the seer is somebody where the two consciousness come together and they can see even when they are awake he says you were telling all the people all those things that was not for him to do he was actually going against the word and the will of god amen he says why you didn't know nothing about it yourself and how could you explain that to them and you cross because of that you cause a great bunch of impersonations to rise up among the people and you see now what you have done now he's talking now about the third quote now i'm trying to bring you into this see now what you're already starting to do right oh my i said lord i'm sorry and he looked at me and said now don't you get your lines tangled up in these kinds of times i've presumed that so you know what that is all about don't get your lines all tangled up in these kinds of times and just then i began to feel myself going higher and higher way up into a higher dimension and when i was set down i was beneath a great tent i have never seen ever seen such a great tent amen just for you to understand you know the tent really is a type of his message we are in a big tent right it's like jesus back then called his mission uh uh like a fisherman that throws a big net in the sea and it bring in all kinds right but there's gonna be a separation time when when the trout and the good fish is taken out and brother branham here is being shown to him in the form of a tent and in this tent is all kinds of people in the tent listen if you've been around this message which god has blessed me to travel to two countries of the world preaching the gospel from two people to 50 000 people and know that they're all kinds in this message all kinds friends and there my friends we find that we're in this debt hallelujah and i've always been in the state amen hallelujah amen and when i look i seem to have i have made an altar call you know when he came to the end of the church ages there i can't remember fully the quote he said this may be god's last altar call hallelujah oh my he literally used the words this may be god's last altar call when he was closing out them seven church ages right now and there were hundreds of people around the altar there under that tent weeping weeping because they had accepted jesus and they were just weeping out loud amen that is those ones which is genuine it's genuine repentance is genuine coming to the lord but justification as i have preached is only one third redemption three steps to a birth they only had one third redemption and they were already shouting and screaming and crying and everything which is good because that's all that in you but now we are up here looking back and seeing that we understand what it was and a real kind gentleman walked out to the platform and said amen while brother branham is resting he's already foretelling his death he's resting in the sleep of death while brother branham is resting what's going to go on we're still going to call a prayer line you see they're still calling the prayer lines when the prophet is gone they're still under the influence of first second book they're expecting that ministry to repeat again they're expecting the third pull not to be one of the word making itself manifest but of greater signs greater wonders greater miracles greater things of that nature and they're looking in that direction and the blast from another one see half our silence amen and he's the devil is looking everywhere trying to find him and when he's doing like that is blast right off of the troll praise god hallelujah amen oh my oh and then i noticed a prayer line and it went all around the tent the message it went all around the tent oh what a prayer line it was hallelujah that's the common view in this message right now right they have all these prayer lines it's okay to have a prayer line as i said these things will follow us but our our uh our main thing is not these just pray lines healing miracles signs wonders wonderful marvelous our thing is jesus the word jesus the word same yesterday today and forever the war making itself manifest lord of god hallelujah oh you're saying that because you're not seeing a lot of miracles happening around i don't have to see the miracles people just pass me and they get miracles is that right they passed peter in the the bible there they were healed they didn't even know where how they got healed because the glory doesn't go to man no more oh i was healed when brother simon laid his hands on oh brother simon become a miracle man no god has taken all of that away it's going right back it's gone back to this the world revelation of the world hallelujah and knowing that sometimes i would see people that are not even believers and i i if i understand or could know that such and such is wrong with them maybe just stand by them or pass by them and i'm praying inside i don't go over and say oh brother can i pray for you if you will kneel in the street here i'll pray for you that's okay too but it's going away from that now where only the word gets the glory only the world is magnified and you get yourself out of the way you don't even want to be seen to be known to be recognized to be acknowledged you don't want it amen hallelujah you get away from all of that the stuff of the flesh amen i looked over then to my left amen and when i looked over to my left oh my you see i was on the platform and there was a piece of canvas stretched there and see oh my he had to pull that back pull back that canvas you remember my message a few weeks uh several weeks ago when the angel told them now pull back that curtain oh praise god and here he is in the vision and he's being told as he pulled back the curtain pull back the candles he said when i pulled back the canvas i saw a little square building about 12 foot across and 20 foot long amen hallelujah oh my all he could see was a little ordinary simple building see god was now building his new creation building his body he's putting together the bright form of the son of man being revealed again why eve came out of adam amen she was of the same material he was made of and now out of this word jesus christ god has taken his wife out of that word and building her body from that word amen hallelujah amen i seen them at that point i seen them bringing a lady on a stretcher but there was another lady taking her name and things amen that's those church spirits right oh my and there they pushed her on true and then next came a man with crutches and i seen him also go through that little building now they were on the inside of that building but on the outside inside outside on another lady a lady came out from inside the building screaming to the top of her voice and pushing her stretcher ahead of her oh my and then there was that other lady on the other side hallelujah and she came to her and said what happened what happened the devil is always fishing and a lot of you going to experience that now what happened to you are you still in the message are you still following the message you're still following the message of brother branham do you know what it is you see why because they are the outside of the tent of the little room and they're asking you what is this change that come over you from when you pass through there what happened in there what happened to you and here hallelujah listen to the answer what happened and the woman said i just don't know all i know is that i'm healed i'm cured i'm delivered i've been set free by the power of almighty god hallelujah oh my you went in there with a purple spirit you went in there with a sick spirit you went in there with some holy spirit on you but by time you come out and abroad there light of the rising of the sun you're a different person changed by the power of god transformed by the holy spirit amen oh she said i just don't know i couldn't even tell you what happened it's right there in a message called the vision i couldn't tell you what happened all she knew is that she's changed something took place hallelujah and by that she show you see god gave him self-insurance because he was his own insurance he swore by himself you followed me by putting a seed in you that's how he ensured that his children are going to pass through this world and come out at the other end he will clean white claims by the power of god amen hallelujah father then they'll know i in them and them in you and that oh we are one one praise god little flames of fire from the burning bush from the presence of almighty god amen hallelujah oh praise god in him wealth what the fullness of the godhead bodily when he went there to the cross and the whole thing went back up and came back down then the spirit of god instead of a one-man body was a remembered body and i'm a part of that body here amen i'm a part of the little building amen praise god hallelujah glory to god amen amen so what do we have we got not just saying words like we used to say it before but in you you have eternal life insurance the eternal life part that's dwelling in you is your insurance the rapture is sure your presence in heaven is sure wrong call in glory you're unto your name amen why the word of god ensured that you're gonna be there by the grace of god hallelujah amen praise god brothers don't bother looking the clock i'm not gonna stop until i'm finished is that okay praise god hallelujah amen that woman said in other words i i got my healing but i don't know how i got it i can't explain and i can tell you that today i got it but i don't know how i got it and i can't explain it i can't put it in words because there's nothing for you to impersonate copycat or anything of that nature i just know like my teammates i was blind but now i see oh grace due to god when jesus comes the tempter's power is broken when jesus comes hallelujah it sets the captive free lord of god hallelujah amen he says then out came a man and that man came leaping and jumping without his crutches in his hands anymore and i looked at that just then oh my praise god what is it it's the change going between the second paul and the third pull going on here and that's what the in the angel is showing here right we're moving away from your second pole to this third pole where even you can explain it even he the prophet couldn't explain it hallelujah that's why you show him more than we know right now and that's why he will totally says you don't say nothing about this till the day you die don't say nothing about this you'll find many quotes where you say that and what he told me in there he said i can't even talk about it till the day i die it's going with me in my bosom hallelujah but i'm sure that just like how he took him in the heaven and show him his natural seed and how many of them were there and his spiritual seed that were born under that first second poll that no doubt the angel showed him us i don't mean this little church but anybody anywhere that really catches this revelation or this revelation catches in their heart hallelujah he give him a glimpse for him to say your work isn't in vain there's many more coming in and these are going to be the big fish now that we're going to be catching amen praise god hallelujah i'm glad friend the rainbow trout are coming in praise god hallelujah you say brother simon don't get so excited amen hallelujah now you see brother branham begins to realize that now the third pull is not going to be him he realized that third paul is now going to be the lord himself amen is that right praise god now i want you to know there's a big difference between the angel of the lord and that light itself that light because about that time i heard something moving and when it comes here at the platform at night i heard it amen the fire and it was the fire of god whipping around like a licking of a blaze hallelujah hallelujah watch and that fire that used to be with him on the platform listen what he says it left me and it went itself right over the audience right it left him he's not going to call out people and tell them their names and the address and all that sort of stuff but the holy spirit now settle himself above the people he's going to do the pulling he's going to do the third pull fishing the great fisherman is going to fish for his own fish hallelujah praise god amen yes sir and so the seventh angels ministry was now over and the lord himself is now coming has now come on the scene under this anointing and inspiration of the third pull a lot of them misunderstanding that's why they think he's going to come back to do all those great works and this and that and he's not coming back he he's resting in peace now and he's there looking from the battlements of glory like paul said and all him other saints looking down and compass with a multitude of these witnesses saying run run with patience the race that is checked before you amen hallelujah we can see be here they can see us but we can't see that hallelujah but we can walk in the light as he's in the light amen and so jesus come hallelujah and when i tell you something when that pillar of light when that pillar of fire which is the light that comes to your soul to your being comes to you and light up your life and gives you light on hard sayings in the scriptures and gives you light on all the things that were hidden in the world when it just starts to give you all that light what does it do it breaks down every stronghold that the devil had in your life it breaks down every false idea every thought that you have every presumption that you might have had anything of that nature it breaks it all down hallelujah amen praise god you all the strongholds the devil tried to build up in you all is broken down says and there it went and stood right over the people hallelujah over the audience amen why it's now fishing for all those people that have ears to hear onto him that happened here to here there's a lot of people that ain't got the ears to hear but i come to him or her that happened here to here oh there was something that you were given before you even got here unto you it's given to know the mysteries of the kingdom but unto them it's not given so you've been given an eye eye of the heart to see and an ear to hear and recognize the fullness of the word and now that pillar of fire comes and settles not on top of brother brandon's hair but the whole thing comes like it did back in the old testament over the whole tabernacle it settles over the entire audience hallelujah what is he doing he's looking for those rainbow trout hallelujah so the spirit of god can come upon them and make himself known is this making sense to me praise the name of the lord jesus hallelujah amen oh my turd pull catch another big fish rainbow trout fish with a promise covenant promise amen hallelujah there it went and settled on top of that little building hallelujah and the one that was standing by me that angel that same voice that same angel's voice said i'll meet you in there for this is the third poll no matter what anybody else tell you the third pull is the angel himself is telling you here this is the third thought some people are waiting for the turtle to start it's already started and they don't know nothing about it because it's not the way they're looking for it just like when he came the first time second time it's not the way they're looking for it they're looking for it in their own preconceived ideas and thoughts wherever god can leave rome and and go to you out there in nowhere you're a nobody how can the spirit of god come to you oh my you see brother sister god can go in a bush in the wilderness and find a cow hoarder like amos or crying some skinny looking old man wrapped up with a smelly channel skin oh my and bring him out with the word hallelujah praise god hallelujah i want you to i just want to throw something there god isn't calling out uh calling out no more prophets or no leaders of the message or anything that knocks nature anybody with that kind of spirit of them they've been led astray some false spirit got a hold of them amen they'll be not never be another prophet like that prophet one in a generation hallelujah praise god in the days of elijah where many the bible would often say and a man of god went and said this and a man of god there were other men of god that were anointed but they were not the prophet and he had to give way for that prophet to bring his message and that's all we're saying god will anoint a many member body now hallelujah and use it for his glory amen i'll meet you in there and this is a third poll but no nobody will know nothing about it you will not know about it because i'll be meeting you in there and i'll tell you right now when he meets you in here nobody's gonna know nothing about when you see the holy spirit reveals and makes himself known to you by divine inspiration yes nobody can tell you it's not so there is nobody can tell you it's not real nobody can force it down your truth and say oh you believe it like that because brother simon told you so it's gone beyond me it's got nothing to do with me sure i'm here standing preaching the word but you caught the revelation amen not of the last prophet's message you caught the revelation that was in the last prophet's message and now you're following that light that revelation that's what's leading you praise the name of the lord hallelujah glory to god amen praise god and then hallelujah aren't you glad that jesus christ has come to do his own fishing third pull fishing oh stranger on the shore amen imagine that they come and there they were fishing all the leo this year night and then catch one rainbow trout but when they come there was a stranger on the shore and he had fish and bread and they never even left the shore to go out in no boat to catch no fish out there how come you had fish what fish was that what bread was that but he had fish and he had bread praise god hallelujah he's showing his lord of all king of glory mighty god everlasting father prince of peace wonderful counselor praise god first and the last capstone and the foundation stone keystone rejects his soul in the same stone jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh who do you say this is who you say my father what do you call his name oh he was a great i am in the burning bush the great i am that was in moses the great i am with brother william branham is the same yesterday today and forever he's the word of god amen amen hallelujah praise god oh my yes friends the great fisherman doing his own fishing hallelujah and the holy spirit is here and he's fishing for you he's fishing for me hallelujah brother brown tried to tell us that in many ways she's in that time comes when the great eagle will spread his wings over the barnyard and he calls this earth and all the religious stuff a bunch of stench barnyard flying over and as he flies over he screams out well that boys he said them chickens didn't understand they scatter you take that i don't want to go back to that and make all the parallels but the main thing is that just like how the holy spirit has come to seek his own children to fish his own trout the holy spirit flying over the great eagle and lets out the scream the voice didn't understand the seven thunders scared them they didn't understand but right away the prophet said that the legal raise his head and you look up why he never heard the language before but the moment he heard it erect something in their appeal made me recognize it it's thus saith the lord hallelujah the word of god hallelujah amen searching for a child he says this will not be a public show he said sir i don't understand it why does it have to be in there why like that he says i don't understand it why do they have to go into that closet like that he said because it is written in the word of god when the oppressed be not like the hypocrites who like to be heard before men but enter into the secret closet and pray to the father who see it in secret and he who see it in secret shall reward thee openly and then i said now sir i understand then he took me to this place and set me in this room where i was at and he told me the rest of what i was to do for the third time and now my christian friends that will when i leave this world that will have to stay with me inside of my bosom mark my words what's coming and what's going to take place but this i have keep have to keep within my bosom right when i leave this world then he tells about how he was invited to go to mexico and when he got there uh there in mexico he realized he says i saw them dark-faced indian-looking children and that's what i saw in the vision but the strange thing i thought i would see a panoramic view there and about the rest of it the dismissing and all like that in the service like that uh you know and when i got there to uh got there see going to the meeting from the vision when he saw those little children to go into the meeting now to preach we received the news that somebody had dismissed the meetings already to this day he says they don't know who even done that as yet they dismissed the meetings and so i flew back i went to kit i went to pray at my cave and i asked the lord about it and he showed me another vision he said you can go listen to this not me saying it you can go but those are dead fishes you can go but those are dead fishes it was laying like that see it was like that see uh saying to me about that fishes i want to get this accurately that's why you see i'm doing a lot of coating here oh my praise god now that would make me you see i just have to believe and this what i'm saying just makes me just a believer in grace you know what he's saying there all the time i was a prophet i was a prophet but this when this make known to me i'm just i realize i'm just another believer amen i'm just brother bill i was only used to do that but this is not me right i am just your brother bill you go over to revelation when the one got to kneel down when the angel said no no no no i'm just your brother don't worship me don't do that at all right stand up on your feet because we're just brothers in christ god bless our brother bill as strange as it may seem i'm supposed to preach on this and i'm gonna start start there's a lot more i can see here and we'll see but um i went i was looking some things and i stumbled on a couple of pictures with brother peter standing at this pulpit here at the first opening of this building and then later he was sitting outside right there on the lawn um out there and i said oh my goodness how how remarkable that i'm talking about peter the fisherman and the heirs peter and i looked at him and i just bowed my head and said it says thank you lord jesus amen he says this just makes me just another believer in grace amen praise god in other words i'm just your brother bill praise the lord you see i've acted and done many things that i've done i've con i've been condemned before god amen but when god speaks anything he has to bring it to pass he even used a moses that killed another man in secret one time but god was determined to use him he kept him in the backside of the desert but he but he still let him take israel to the promised land hallelujah god still despite brother branham's so-called mistakes you know um he still let him bring us right up to the river jordan right up to that gap but he couldn't take a step further the holy spirit had to take over and take us over that chasm back into our promised land joshua the holy spirit had to take us over the crossing oh praise god hallelujah thanks be to god for his grace and his mercy glory to god hallelujah amen brothers let me close let me close out on this praise god he says you see now today you can preach all kinds of repentance you can preach about hell fire and all the brimstone and people will laugh at it amen see oh i believe that we can get in dancing in the spirit we can even shout i believe in it we can speak in towns i believe in it i believe every bit of it but if we have that and don't have that agonizing weeping broke up spirit god can never use it them things are all good dancing in the spirit speaking in tongues jumping being real repentant like he saw it's all good it's wonderful right he says them things are good but we have got to have the other way to go with it we've left off listen to this we have left off the main thing and now we have gone for the secondary but you can never major on a minor you following the second poland versus poland how are you going to major you're going to come in the third pull the major on that kind of a minor though they were good he said i believe all of that is all good it's all wonderful but you can he says even in my meetings my own meetings has got much to that place where there is too much on divine healing this is a prophet speaking ins you see instead of the healing of the soul oh brother what we need today is a real revival now to break out of the souls on fire for the living god hallelujah amen and i turned to him and said what shall i do amen he says go back for this time now is not the right time is that right you remember the other quote i always use to you when the holy spirit spoke to the prophet and said no they will only know when it is time for them to know they will know when it's time for them to know and i am saying to you because it's come to me now is the time this is the time when god is opening up his word hallelujah back then it wasn't the time but now is rainbow trout time amen to receive the word of the living god because they're the ones made to receive just the voice of the eagle just the cry of the spirit the unwritten word hallelujah god making himself known in that way amen think of it 40 000 people in that meeting in mexico a dead baby raised from the dead great things taking place oh my but now i'm waiting for that great hour for now i know when you cannot major on a minor and those things he's talking about the healings the miracles the wonders the raising of the dead he says they are minors to this the person of the word himself hallelujah friends the redeemed they're gathering in they're brought without the world hallelujah from the east from the west the northernest nobody have to tell them nothing the holy spirit does that remember i tell you all over and over again forget this thing we come out of pentecost without a denomination and out of the message with where you think you have to go and persuade somebody to believe this message you got to lasso somebody wrestle your relatives down to the ground and brand them with a bee on their behind no that's done with you just wave the sheath you just share the word and give god the chance to work the miracle amen if it's an elect how are you going to know i don't know by religious looks so many religious spirits seducing spirits under the guise of religion these days you can't even believe your eyes trust your eyes you can trust your ears what you're hearing oh my let the holy spirit do the job right but you got to still witness because you're fishing yeah you don't know what's under the water you gotta keep fishing and if that fish because you know trout they don't just run after any any bait i've been up there fishing there and the time that they have put down the bed and they just come and hit it with their nose and they go up they just don't eat anything like that amen when the right word goes down then they grab it and when they grab it they're not like other fish that will nibble around they're playing around with it when they know that's the that's the big that's the one they want to eat they just grab it and they start going up deep amen and that's the real believer when they see the word they grab the word you're not fooling around not wasting any time hallelujah praise god amen so you can't major on a minor remember this friends the lord is again fixing to visit his people and this will be a great marvelous something friends he can't even describe it he said this visitation is going to be a great marvel or something well what great and marvelous well great to hope they think when in chicago when brother branham said to madison jose he said oh i thank god for that great meeting we had the greatest meeting we had said what red meeting brother brother you had meeting with with tens of thousands of people and even more miracles and now this one you know less people maybe 3 000 and less miracles and yet you call it the greatest meeting he says you don't understand what it means to be the greatest meaning he said it's only to call out the elect of that area the elect that's been in that all the crowd if there's five in there that's the revival that's the move of god that's the moving of the holy spirit is to call out those elected that we're in that crowd that is the move of god and the visitation of god is going on right now god again visiting his people and they don't even know anything about it when he came there in the first time he came physically he wasn't even known within 200 miles of where he had come now we're reading it in the bible we think the whole world knew but the whole world didn't know he came down from his glory condescended walked among the people did all the miracles and he wasn't known beyond 200 miles from where he was and again the world is doing this look i have no ownership of nothing i don't believe i'm the only one this is it's breaking around the world and other people are going to see it and maybe are already seeing it and just like like uh peter and paul many years later they meet and when they meet their teaching their preaching without con conference or knowing one another it fits together like that amen it fit together like that i don't have to know him you don't have to know me she doesn't have to know me but when i hear the word that word test hit my ears i know this the gospel sound i know the gospel sound amen praise the with the lord god so you can't major on their mind was on god forbid but there's many still beating the drum and trying to mage up on a minor of those things hallelujah so there's a visitation see but there's a great visitation a marvelous something going on friends the lord is fixing to visit his people and that has to be a secret that i must keep within my own heart and if you know me believe me and love me and you respect me as a servant of the living god remember you i am remember this i am telling you a blessing is now on the road that's right a blessing is coming and that blessing is the same one that now it doesn't weaken me anymore why you go back study the message but i'll just make it brief the angel told them because you were doing that i told you how to do it when you walter you were doing that but this third thought it wasn't weakening anymore because it wasn't him the lord himself had come to be his own interpreter of his own word and a greater than solomon making himself known amen oh my i will never weaken no more it will be far beyond anything that has ever happened here or any other time else because it's something that the lord himself has given praise god brothers uh look we can go online but we'll just leave it there for now and i want you to know i thank god that i was blind but now i see musicians worship leader come praise god will you bless my friends [Applause] when you go home be real sheep don't just go home and pick up a leg of turkey and or a steak and whatnot go ah even after you eat just no just think on these things regurgitate search these things in the word of god see the scripture see the message and see whether what i'm telling you or what i've said is the truth and just to give you some background here let me see if i can give you why are people so tossed about this one message came out of and the next one is what is a vision you can look in that also because these are just the actual quotes here and oh i just forgot something just before i left the house the holy spirit was speaking in my heart and saying he says that is why i sent peter to go and catch that fish that was one of the big fish that was the rainbow trout it remember the question he was asked he said whose image whose seal is on it you know he said well render to caesar what is caesar but unto god what is god this fish that was caught by peter had caesar's inscription but this one we are catching they have the image of jesus christ in them and this is what he was telling me and i didn't i didn't make a note of that i just came back to me before i come off of here saying that that's what we are going after now is to catch the fishes in the sea of humanity that have the image of jesus christ already the seed of god the germ the gene already in there and the word of god is only what the real genuine pure word is what they eat i mean they'll eat a crumb they'll eat whatever and spit out the rest of it but they're seeking for the pure war and when they get that they're not just nibbling they're gonna grab a hold amen god bless you god bless you real good and i'm going to go in my office and write that little thought that he gave me at the last layer down before it goes from me again okay god bless every one of you keep looking up moving forward pray for me for next week that i might come again not in my own flesh i don't have to go home as you would think and study for hours and hours i do that after god shows me something right not before studying to find something but when the holy spirit begins to break something then i go back to the word and confirm it in the word and then the whole thing begins to run right through the scripture then i come to you amen praise the name of the lord now one minute i'm gonna ask the deacons um let the members of the church alone remain those whatever that are here please remain in and the others can uh go out on the outside of the church i just want to talk to the
