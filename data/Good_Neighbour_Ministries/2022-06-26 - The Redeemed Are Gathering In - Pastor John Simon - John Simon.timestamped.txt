[16:39] is
[16:57] is
[17:21] is
[17:38] i am
[17:48] [Music]
[17:58] hallelujah sister martial has a
[18:00] testimony for us this morning
[18:02] [Music]
[18:05] hallelujah
[18:06] god bless you all saints of the living
[18:08] god it's wonderful always so wonderful
[18:11] to be in the house of the lord amen
[18:14] and um i have two things that i'd like
[18:16] to share today
[18:17] and the first part is i have to say that
[18:19] if it was of myself
[18:21] i would not be standing here right now
[18:24] i you know
[18:25] i'm literally being convicted by the
[18:27] holy spirit to share what i'm about to
[18:29] share and
[18:30] um
[18:31] you know one i'm still being tested
[18:34] i haven't received the money yet as
[18:36] brother christopher would say in order
[18:38] to get them test the money you have to
[18:39] have the test to get the money right but
[18:42] the lord wants me to share my experience
[18:44] and i don't know who will bless i pray
[18:45] to be a blessing to someone and then
[18:47] glory to god for the second one the
[18:49] victory's already won and we can rejoice
[18:51] together but before i do there's a
[18:53] scripture that the lord gave me and i
[18:55] just want to share it with you as well
[18:56] it's from psalm 86 5.
[18:59] it says oh lord you are so good
[19:04] so ready to forgive
[19:06] so full of unfailing love
[19:09] for all who ask for your help
[19:13] amen
[19:14] and i'm asking for his help today once
[19:16] more
[19:17] because for some time i've been
[19:19] struggling with a hearing loss in my
[19:21] right ear
[19:22] and i've been praying just on my own
[19:24] that you know
[19:26] as we just we praying we believe but
[19:28] there wasn't that desperation and then
[19:30] one morning you know in prayer and
[19:31] everything and as i listen to the word
[19:32] and of course brother branham and every
[19:34] time you minister for someone i'm
[19:36] listening and praying that i'll receive
[19:37] my blessing too i receive my healing too
[19:40] and then the thought came to me why
[19:41] don't you ask pastor simon to pray for
[19:43] you
[19:44] so about two wednesday nights ago i was
[19:46] able to share with pastor and express to
[19:47] him that the spirit of the lord asked me
[19:49] to you know let him pray
[19:51] and he was you know ready to receive and
[19:53] we spoke and he said yes sister we'll
[19:55] keep it in our heart
[19:57] but exactly two sundays ago not last
[19:59] week the week before as he was praying
[20:01] just in the middle of the word coming
[20:03] forth and if you listen back on the tape
[20:05] you'll catch it
[20:06] but he just spoke out and he said death
[20:08] spirit i drive you out in jesus name
[20:10] and in that moment i received it for
[20:12] myself and i said thank you lord jesus
[20:14] and i could hear my ear ringing and it's
[20:16] like a pop and it's like oh lord please
[20:18] god i'm like lord you're working on me
[20:20] you're working on me
[20:21] and when i realized when i got home my
[20:23] ear was so much better i could close my
[20:25] left ear and i could hear well in from
[20:27] my right ear and i've been telling the
[20:29] children that children were speaking to
[20:30] me and i could just hear by closing my
[20:32] left ear so i was praising the lord
[20:35] rejoicing
[20:36] and i shared the testimony with my dear
[20:38] sisters on our thursday night small
[20:39] group and then i shared the testimony
[20:41] again on a friday night prayer meeting
[20:43] which i'll encourage you all if you are
[20:45] ever able please the prayer meetings are
[20:47] such a blessing so please try and join
[20:50] but that being said i shared the
[20:51] testimony last friday
[20:54] so then now after the prayer meeting
[20:55] around 10 o'clock in the late in the
[20:57] night i noticed my hearing was off again
[21:00] i wasn't hearing as clearly as before
[21:02] and i realized and i'm like satan you're
[21:04] a liar
[21:05] because i've been witnessing and
[21:06] testifying and speaking that the lord's
[21:08] delivered me now these devils want to
[21:10] come back and come back even worse and
[21:12] then this is where i'm healing for your
[21:14] help as well to keep praying for me
[21:16] because my hearing since then i've
[21:18] continued to pray i've shared with the
[21:19] believers and it's gotten better but
[21:22] it's still not fully delivered so i'm
[21:24] trusting god and i'm sure in this that
[21:26] you could pray for me also because i
[21:28] know and i stand on the word of god that
[21:31] by his stripes i'm already healed and i
[21:33] say thank you lord jesus for healing me
[21:35] right and i stand and i think also the
[21:37] lord has been brought bringing it to my
[21:39] heart that like we think of brother
[21:40] brandon i mean remember he had a
[21:42] stigmatism in his eye and then
[21:44] eventually he had to wear such big
[21:45] glasses but then eventually laura gave
[21:47] him perfect vision and i thought about
[21:49] also the fact that he had to speak about
[21:51] joseph being born before he was born and
[21:54] you know sarah came along of course and
[21:56] then people were making fun of him and
[21:58] saying oh you meant josephine but he was
[22:00] like no joseph will come so the lord is
[22:02] also convicted in my heart that
[22:03] sometimes we have to speak it abraham
[22:05] had to speak it before isaac came so i'm
[22:08] speaking it now that by the name of the
[22:10] lord jesus christ i'm healed my right
[22:12] ear is perfectly healed i will hear in
[22:14] higher octaves as our brother said i
[22:16] will hear and all your octaves as our
[22:18] pastor spoke and i thank the lord jesus
[22:20] for healing me amen praise god praise
[22:23] god
[22:25] now brother
[22:26] just one more one more and i won't be
[22:28] long but the other one is that
[22:30] i don't know if you all experienced an
[22:31] early morning phone call from abroad and
[22:34] i've had that and it was a report of
[22:36] death you're woken up out of your bed
[22:37] you're being told someone died well this
[22:39] time just last month i got an early
[22:41] morning phone call from my mom my uncle
[22:43] in jamaica has been rushed to the
[22:45] hospital well
[22:47] thank god the lord just gave me a spirit
[22:49] of peace and i just said mom we're gonna
[22:50] pray
[22:52] and i went into prayer by bomb and we
[22:54] prayed and we prayed i later found out
[22:56] why he had to go to hospital his
[22:57] gallbladder was detached and he was
[23:00] literally on deathbed but the grace of
[23:03] god we prayed and we prayed they did
[23:05] surgery on him it was very testing it
[23:07] was very difficult but glory to god my
[23:10] uncle uncle's recovering he is well and
[23:13] the lord jesus has delivered him from
[23:14] the brink of death and we thank god for
[23:16] his healing power amen praise
[23:19] [Applause]
[23:20] god amen
[23:26] let's uh bow our hearts before the lord
[23:30] heavenly father lord jesus once again
[23:33] it is time to take up the offering lord
[23:35] you commanded us lord to to give back to
[23:39] you and you only ask for a tenth lord
[23:42] but lord jesus we all you also said that
[23:44] give and it shall be given unto you good
[23:46] measure pressed down and shaken together
[23:49] so we ask you lord to accept the
[23:51] offering today lord god let it be

[51:28] lives and moves and walks with us father
[51:32] that we are not caught up in some
[51:35] mythical thing but
[51:36] lord we have come into contact with the
[51:40] unfailing reality
[51:42] of the living god
[51:44] walking him up and down among the
[51:46] candlesticks

[52:20] when the redeemed
[52:22] are gathering in
[52:24] praise the lord and we always sing it
[52:26] that way when the redeemed are gathering
[52:29] in
[52:30] wash like the snow
[52:32] but i want to present it this morning
[52:35] not when the redeemed are gathering in
[52:39] i want to say they redeemed our
[52:42] gathering in
[52:45] right now the redeemed are gathering in
[52:49] they're being gathered by the word of
[52:51] god
[52:52] they're being gathered by the same
[52:54] player of fire that gathered the
[52:56] children of israel
[52:58] in the land of goshen
[53:01] before they took their journey
[53:05] but we are not gathering in goshen we're
[53:08] gathering in god we're gathering in his
[53:10] word we're gathering in his presence
[53:13] before the departure to go to glory into
[53:17] his divine presence that is why we are
[53:20] here this morning
[53:21] we are not just a people that are just
[53:24] frivolously traditionally attending
[53:28] church
[53:29] but we are here because something has
[53:31] movement in our hearts
[53:34] i don't know about you but there's
[53:36] something moving within my heart that's
[53:38] real brother sister
[53:40] it's not something that we're making up
[53:44] we're not here to try to persuade or
[53:46] convince you
[53:48] if you are an elected
[53:50] predestinated son or daughter of god
[53:53] then you will have caught the same thing
[53:55] i caught
[53:56] you would have received what i received
[53:59] and together we are what in jesus christ
[54:02] hallelujah
[54:03] [Applause]
[54:06] i want you to know this
[54:08] brother branham's constant emphasis
[54:12] emphasis which i noticed
[54:15] and when the slaves
[54:17] in that
[54:18] year of jubilee
[54:20] when him and his
[54:22] family his kids his wife
[54:26] and all of them
[54:28] wanting to return
[54:32] return
[54:33] back to their homeland where they come
[54:36] from is that your desires here today
[54:39] we know we come from god and we're going
[54:43] back to god
[54:45] amen we come from his mind
[54:48] amen he spoke the word
[54:51] we come
[54:52] through mother and father that we could
[54:55] be physically expressed
[54:57] and then here we are upon the face of
[55:00] the earth
[55:01] trapped in a human body
[55:03] with which we can live and make
[55:07] ourselves manifest the people
[55:10] but now the word has come
[55:13] and he has revealed himself to us
[55:17] telling us
[55:18] you are not born to be creatures of time
[55:22] amen
[55:24] you come from eternity
[55:26] you're going back to eternity you come
[55:29] from god you're going back to god
[55:32] because you are after his kind
[55:35] is that right
[55:37] you come after his kind
[55:39] exactly you don't have to work yourself
[55:42] up into a christianity
[55:45] you don't have to work yourself up into
[55:47] a religious frenzy
[55:49] you don't have to prove that you're more
[55:51] spiritual than the other believer
[55:55] no
[55:56] because you are
[55:57] who you are
[55:59] like paul said i am what i am
[56:03] that's who i am take me as i am because
[56:05] that's that's just what i am
[56:08] uh
[56:09] and i'm being myself
[56:11] i'm not trying to be like brother
[56:12] brother
[56:13] i'm not trying to copy off of this
[56:16] person or that person or the other we
[56:18] don't have any message
[56:20] regimentation
[56:22] or message costume
[56:25] or uh what's the word i want uniform
[56:28] that we all must wear but we are free in
[56:32] jesus christ
[56:34] and we are now on our journey of return
[56:39] where we come from
[56:41] and we are in this stage
[56:43] now
[56:44] that man wants to return
[56:47] because that man heard the trumpet
[56:51] hallelujah have you heard the trumpet of
[56:54] this hour
[56:56] have you heard the trumpet angel
[56:59] sounding out the
[57:01] on the certain sound
[57:03] of the gospel of jesus christ to your
[57:06] heart to my heart and we are certain
[57:09] that we heard
[57:11] now we can drop our whole
[57:14] amen the form of christianity that you
[57:16] were living drop your works
[57:19] stop your striving and your fighting
[57:22] stop all of that
[57:24] drop whatever you were doing
[57:27] look up into that
[57:29] denominational master's face he says
[57:31] task master i bring it up to date in our
[57:34] modern times and he says you can't hit
[57:38] me anymore
[57:40] you can't excommunicate me anymore
[57:46] thank god hallelujah you can't be
[57:49] excommunicated from this
[57:52] because you are born into christ
[57:54] one in him
[57:56] one with his body eternal as he is
[57:59] eternal because you are in his mind you
[58:02] are not a creation amen satan tried to
[58:06] fool you by putting you into a body that
[58:09] he
[58:09] create not create but procreated
[58:13] ceo is a copycat god create he procreate
[58:16] and so on but the point is he's we are
[58:20] not
[58:21] you i've never seen you
[58:24] i've seen your body
[58:26] that you're expressing yourself through
[58:28] but the real you
[58:30] that part
[58:32] didn't come from here
[58:34] they're looking for alien beings from
[58:36] outer space paul paul already told them
[58:39] we are aliens and strangers
[58:42] we are pilgrims we just passing through
[58:44] this land
[58:45] we're going back to god where we come
[58:48] from
[58:49] redeem that gathering in right now
[58:53] and the magnet is the word of god that's
[58:56] gathering the redeemed wherever they are
[58:59] amen
[59:01] yes
[59:02] that man can now go free
[59:04] and walk right home from right there
[59:08] amen you see that that jubilee is when
[59:13] he heard that sound
[59:16] when you heard
[59:18] a certain sound and a message
[59:21] hallelujah look i've been in the message
[59:24] for from so many years
[59:27] many years
[59:29] but then there's a point in the message
[59:31] oh you know you're thinking i mean long
[59:33] in the message i've been in 20 years 30
[59:35] years but then
[59:37] i heard a certain sound
[59:40] coming out of that message
[59:42] and when i heard that sound it's the
[59:44] same message but i heard a certain sound
[59:47] coming out of it that caught my heart in
[59:50] the air amen i tell you brother sister
[59:53] right away that the seventh thunders was
[59:56] not the thundering to me anymore the
[59:58] seven thunders become a voice
[1:00:01] began to speak begin to reveal begin to
[1:00:04] open up the word of god
[1:00:07] and the bible become a new bible not
[1:00:09] just to the prophet but to every one of
[1:00:12] us you open the word the bible you open
[1:00:15] the message of the prophet and it
[1:00:17] strikes your soul amen the deep crawls
[1:00:20] to the deep and the deep has to respond
[1:00:24] because my father and i are one one in
[1:00:28] christ one together hallelujah blessed
[1:00:31] be the name of the lord
[1:00:33] my topic as i said is the redeemed are
[1:00:37] gathering in
[1:00:40] did you get that
[1:00:43] amen
[1:00:44] god has dealt with us exactly the same
[1:00:48] amount of time as he has dealt with the
[1:00:51] jews
[1:00:52] he gave abraham the promise until the
[1:00:55] time of the rejecting of the messiah
[1:00:59] now he's talking about that repeating
[1:01:01] again here now
[1:01:03] amen when they reject the word for this
[1:01:07] hour the time since the promise or the
[1:01:10] word was given to when they reject that
[1:01:13] word amen hallelujah now watch close
[1:01:17] don't miss it
[1:01:18] you see
[1:01:19] when that happens
[1:01:23] it will be a jubilee at that time
[1:01:26] that will be the growing up but this
[1:01:30] time of a gentile bride not not israel
[1:01:34] coming out but a gentile bride going up
[1:01:37] into the presence of almighty god
[1:01:39] hallelujah amen
[1:01:41] and the return of christ when they go
[1:01:45] out of bondage see
[1:01:48] from the world
[1:01:49] they've gathered there in israel for
[1:01:53] that day amen see where we're at we
[1:01:57] don't know what exact time it may happen
[1:02:01] but we are now standing at the end do
[1:02:04] you believe it
[1:02:06] any day now
[1:02:08] jesus is coming
[1:02:11] it may be at mourn
[1:02:13] when the day is breaking hallelujah i
[1:02:15] don't know when but any moment now we
[1:02:19] can be gone from here
[1:02:22] amen praise god
[1:02:25] oh praise god just stop
[1:02:28] to think that a man
[1:02:30] in that jubilee all that man has to do
[1:02:34] is to stop whatever he is doing
[1:02:37] and come back return to his inheritance
[1:02:41] amen
[1:02:43] so
[1:02:43] those of you you're in the building but
[1:02:45] i'm being heard and seen on the internet
[1:02:49] no matter what you're doing
[1:02:52] whether you're a believer you're
[1:02:54] unbeliever you're a message believer a
[1:02:57] backslidden believer
[1:02:59] a believer that's faulty in certain
[1:03:01] parts of your life weak or something the
[1:03:04] prophet said you have the right of
[1:03:07] return hallelujah you have a right to
[1:03:10] come back to your inheritance
[1:03:13] back to the fullness of the word of god
[1:03:16] hallelujah oh blessed be his name amen

[1:03:22] and go right back praise god you see did
[1:03:25] you believe
[1:03:27] meant that god
[1:03:29] has provided a way of grace
[1:03:32] for every individual
[1:03:35] to return back to their rightful
[1:03:39] inheritance no matter what they've done
[1:03:41] where they're being whatever took place
[1:03:43] god is giving you the right to return
[1:03:47] back amen back to your inheritance
[1:03:49] praise the lord hallelujah
[1:03:52] i was talking with some believers and
[1:03:54] they were saying yes
[1:03:57] you know i i was told that um any jew
[1:04:01] that wants to go to the back to the land
[1:04:04] of israel
[1:04:05] doesn't matter if they're poor they have
[1:04:07] no money if they've never been there
[1:04:09] doesn't matter if they're rich if
[1:04:11] they're this or that the nation of
[1:04:13] israel
[1:04:14] already has a stated policy any jew
[1:04:18] anywhere in the world that wants to
[1:04:21] return to israel
[1:04:23] can get on
[1:04:25] one of their planes
[1:04:26] and they will take them back to israel
[1:04:30] free of charge
[1:04:32] free of charge they don't have to pay
[1:04:34] one penny but they'll be taken back to
[1:04:38] israel and i just thought about that and
[1:04:40] said well praise god we have got what we
[1:04:44] have without money or without christ and
[1:04:47] be on our way back to the glorious
[1:04:50] presence of the living god hallelujah
[1:04:53] because our way is already paid
[1:04:56] not with the corruptible things like
[1:04:58] silver and gold but with the precious
[1:05:01] priceless blood of jesus christ
[1:05:03] hallelujah amen praise god
[1:05:07] what a picture
[1:05:09] that paints for us here
[1:05:11] tonight
[1:05:13] or today i'm quoting the scripture here
[1:05:15] but we are in day now so i'm saying
[1:05:17] today
[1:05:18] of the church
[1:05:20] speaking of the church in these last
[1:05:23] days
[1:05:25] you see
[1:05:26] man can do
[1:05:28] and when you see
[1:05:29] what man can do then look again at what
[1:05:32] god can do right
[1:05:34] now the jubilee
[1:05:36] was god's way
[1:05:38] of expressing his grace to his people
[1:05:42] by restoring or bringing them back
[1:05:46] to their rightful positions in this last
[1:05:50] day you see back there is returning
[1:05:52] israel back to the land and you know the
[1:05:55] land was divided up by joshua type of
[1:05:58] the holy spirit and each tribe had their
[1:06:01] peace of the land
[1:06:03] you know i've been up at the gates of
[1:06:05] dan
[1:06:06] where they were protecting that border
[1:06:09] and the springs and it was the fountain
[1:06:12] of the fountains that provide the waters
[1:06:15] for the jordan
[1:06:17] and they're protecting it to this day
[1:06:20] up there the tribe of dan and their
[1:06:22] descendants are still protecting it
[1:06:24] there oh my and the land is divided up
[1:06:28] where each tribe knows their position of
[1:06:31] where they're supposed to be according
[1:06:32] to what joshua had laid out but what the
[1:06:36] prophet is talking about that's the jews
[1:06:39] but they're going back to literal israel
[1:06:41] but we as gentile bride we are returning
[1:06:45] back into the glorious presence of the
[1:06:48] living god
[1:06:49] and before the journey you are being
[1:06:52] placed into your rightful spiritual
[1:06:55] position where god wants you to
[1:06:58] be in other words you don't have to go
[1:07:01] around thinking about it you don't have
[1:07:03] to have teaching and sermons about it or
[1:07:06] finding your position now god knows your
[1:07:09] position
[1:07:11] and he's going to place you in that
[1:07:12] position you don't need to worry about
[1:07:15] it just function just live just walk
[1:07:18] and the spirit of god will lead you
[1:07:20] right where you're supposed to be
[1:07:23] you're going to be in your position by
[1:07:25] his will
[1:07:27] not by your taking lessons of how to be
[1:07:29] in your position not by having a bible
[1:07:31] study about to be in your position by
[1:07:33] the spirit of god revealing to you he
[1:07:36] wants you to be a housewife be a house
[1:07:38] spice and give god with glory
[1:07:40] you want you to be a doctor be a doctor
[1:07:42] and give god the glory
[1:07:44] you want to be a a preacher but praise
[1:07:46] god what i'm saying is
[1:07:49] whether that person comes in at midday
[1:07:53] morning or they come in the evening time
[1:07:56] no matter what time of day or whatever
[1:07:58] he said what is it to you i want to give
[1:08:01] everybody the same pay
[1:08:02] he was typing that he's going to give
[1:08:04] everybody salvation amen doesn't matter
[1:08:07] of course rewards at the judgment seat
[1:08:10] of christ rewards of one person maybe
[1:08:13] more than the other is your rewards with
[1:08:16] the works and the things you might have
[1:08:18] done in giving glory to god for saving
[1:08:20] your soul hallelujah amen oh praise god
[1:08:25] now
[1:08:26] the sounding of that trip yeah
[1:08:29] amen it's so important that we hear the
[1:08:31] sounding of the trumpet do you
[1:08:34] sir because that means return
[1:08:38] it means return
[1:08:40] or return or disperse to your own
[1:08:44] or if you sold out your inheritance that
[1:08:47] you are given
[1:08:49] he repeats again if you even sold that

[1:17:20] signs
[1:17:22] prophets foretold

[1:18:01] [Music]
[1:18:04] amen
[1:18:05] hallelujah
[1:18:06] oh don't you hear it
[1:18:09] what is he talking about
[1:18:11] he says return
[1:18:13] return
[1:18:15] the holy spirit is crying return i can
[1:18:19] think of jesus looking over jerusalem
[1:18:23] and tears began to drip down
[1:18:27] his cheeks
[1:18:28] because he loved it
[1:18:30] but they had rejected him
[1:18:33] but those who were his own
[1:18:36] return or dispersed to your own the same
[1:18:40] spirit of christ hallelujah if a man's
[1:18:44] filled with a spirit he can look out
[1:18:46] over the church
[1:18:47] and see
[1:18:48] people that ought to be shining with the
[1:18:52] lights and the glorious power and
[1:18:54] presence of the living god the holy
[1:18:57] spirit moving upon them
[1:18:59] may their hearts be filled with tears of
[1:19:02] regret what have we done oh my
[1:19:06] disgraceful
[1:19:08] bunch amen people
[1:19:11] go out smoke drink
[1:19:13] marry three or four times
[1:19:17] women cutting off their ear paints using
[1:19:20] shorts wearing moral clothes everything
[1:19:24] else call themselves pentecostal sisters
[1:19:28] i have to say call themselves message
[1:19:29] sisters
[1:19:31] oh that won't happen in the message
[1:19:33] that's what you think
[1:19:36] but my friends
[1:19:37] the message is not what it used to be
[1:19:41] when you go far back as i've been and
[1:19:45] see how trim and how it was
[1:19:48] tight how our believers were were kept
[1:19:52] in line with the word of god now
[1:19:53] everything's got loose
[1:19:55] it seems like nothing is sacred anymore
[1:19:58] and people think they can just
[1:20:00] do whatever they feel like doing and
[1:20:03] because
[1:20:04] uh god doesn't want the pastor to be a
[1:20:07] hoarder of goats
[1:20:09] he's supposed to be a shepherd
[1:20:12] is that right
[1:20:13] and that means that the the shepherd
[1:20:15] doesn't drive sheep
[1:20:17] the the goat herd have to drive the
[1:20:19] goats but the shepherds will drive
[1:20:21] sheeps the sheep follow him praise the
[1:20:24] lord so really this is something we need
[1:20:27] to come back to the word of god right in
[1:20:30] this
[1:20:30] message some people are going and saying
[1:20:33] oh the prophet were preached imagine the
[1:20:35] war so that you know back in the bible
[1:20:38] it was uh one one uh dear male dear and
[1:20:43] uh a thousand uh um
[1:20:46] female that was one
[1:20:48] this and so many of that therefore i can
[1:20:52] marry four wives
[1:20:55] leave their wife marry somebody else
[1:20:58] this might not apply to you you may not
[1:21:00] need it but there may be somebody out
[1:21:02] there
[1:21:03] in the digital universe that needs what
[1:21:06] i'm saying here
[1:21:08] so while i am preaching you pray amen
[1:21:11] that god will send the arrows straight
[1:21:13] to that heart hallelujah and use it for
[1:21:17] his glory and for his honor
[1:21:20] that's graceful
[1:21:21] women of the message
[1:21:24] wearing their shorts wearing their
[1:21:27] their bikinis
[1:21:29] and stuff like that praise the lord
[1:21:32] hallelujah amen
[1:21:34] and call themselves pentecostal sisters
[1:21:38] praise the lord glory to god i'm not
[1:21:41] going to go off and preach on that so
[1:21:43] don't get nervous and quiet on me
[1:21:48] i'm i'm staying on topic here praise the
[1:21:50] lord you know i won't go off and explain
[1:21:53] whether circumstances there are
[1:21:54] conditions where this might be allowed
[1:21:56] that might be allowed that that is not
[1:21:58] for me to do that's individually you
[1:22:00] have to deal with that with the holy
[1:22:02] spirit now
[1:22:05] hallelujah amen praise god all people
[1:22:09] return
[1:22:10] return
[1:22:11] oh praise god we are now standing on the
[1:22:15] threshold where
[1:22:18] decisions have to be made
[1:22:21] hallelujah are you going to go the rest
[1:22:24] of the journey
[1:22:25] amen are you going to i'll go with him
[1:22:28] through temptation
[1:22:30] i'll go with him
[1:22:33] and then you say all the way
[1:22:36] can you say that
[1:22:38] you're going to go with him all the way
[1:22:41] a lot of people sign that song but what
[1:22:43] they meant i was going to go with him
[1:22:45] part of the way
[1:22:47] i go with him when things get a little
[1:22:49] hard
[1:22:50] i'll go with him until i can't take it
[1:22:53] any longer i'll go with him this brother
[1:22:56] upset me that sister upset me that what
[1:22:58] they got to do with your individual
[1:23:01] salvation and walk with god don't try
[1:23:03] going to god and blaming somebody else
[1:23:05] or some circumstance or something like
[1:23:08] that you're chaining up yourself like
[1:23:09] the devil was chained by a chain of
[1:23:11] circumstances don't allow that to happen
[1:23:14] amen praise god hallelujah amen you see
[1:23:18] god knows the way
[1:23:21] and he reveals to the heart of man
[1:23:25] hallelujah in the proper way but it's
[1:23:29] meant
[1:23:30] so that men may see this and return
[1:23:36] and the only way they can return is to
[1:23:40] come to the truth of the world amen it's
[1:23:43] the truth of the world that brings
[1:23:45] around this gathering in praise god
[1:23:49] hallelujah
[1:23:51] oh my
[1:23:53] do i was out on lake
[1:23:57] i can't pronounce that too much
[1:23:59] but uh he said there was such a great
[1:24:01] gathering of ducks
[1:24:04] i have never seen so many of them
[1:24:08] gathering together
[1:24:09] in my life and my indian friend bert
[1:24:13] said what do you make of that billy and
[1:24:17] i said well they're beginning to swarm
[1:24:20] like that
[1:24:21] because they're getting ready to go
[1:24:24] south
[1:24:25] hallelujah praise the lord rather and
[1:24:29] and listen
[1:24:31] but i said some kind of a special
[1:24:35] instinct
[1:24:36] that god put in the animal life
[1:24:40] to know when to move
[1:24:42] and god is
[1:24:44] letting them make ready to get ready to
[1:24:47] move amen praise god hallelujah because
[1:24:51] what their flying time had come
[1:24:55] i want to say here our rapture time has
[1:24:59] come
[1:25:00] [Music]
[1:25:01] is that right praise god
[1:25:04] do you notice them birds robins
[1:25:08] what is happening they're getting ready
[1:25:12] they know nothing but winter is
[1:25:14] beginning to settle in tribulation
[1:25:17] the tribulation is coming
[1:25:19] amen when he that hinders
[1:25:22] will not be here to hinder anymore will
[1:25:25] be taken out of the way then shall the
[1:25:28] man of sin be revealed so winter is
[1:25:31] coming amen praise god all these things
[1:25:34] are coming and even the deer are getting
[1:25:37] ready amen oh my that's the way it is
[1:25:42] with all that quacking and carrying on
[1:25:46] or like only ducks can do carrying on
[1:25:49] like that what do you think they're
[1:25:51] talking about billy now he's talking
[1:25:53] about ducks talking to one another
[1:25:56] i said well all they know is that
[1:26:00] they're having a real time of fellowship
[1:26:04] before their great flight hallelujah
[1:26:07] brother sisters let's have a great time
[1:26:09] of fellowship before our great life
[1:26:11] hallelujah
[1:26:15] a great time of fellowship before our
[1:26:18] great flight hallelujah ducks and geese
[1:26:22] there's never found a better way for
[1:26:25] them to find to go south but
[1:26:29] to come together and begin to swarm with
[1:26:32] each other first
[1:26:34] hallelujah talking about the message now
[1:26:37] the message came forth then it broke up
[1:26:39] into all kind of groups this one don't
[1:26:42] believe that this one believes that the
[1:26:43] other one believe the other and they get
[1:26:45] into argumentations they get into debate
[1:26:48] strife and everything else praise god
[1:26:50] hallelujah but then when you start to
[1:26:53] really catch the revelation those things
[1:26:56] even if they continue talking about that
[1:26:58] it fades away
[1:27:00] in front of you
[1:27:02] hallelujah god bless you in such a way
[1:27:04] now you can deal with anything it
[1:27:06] doesn't matter what it is praise the
[1:27:08] name of the lord so
[1:27:10] there is no better way than for them to
[1:27:13] swarm first
[1:27:15] you see
[1:27:17] you they all get together
[1:27:20] they'll come themselves because there's
[1:27:23] an instinct in them drawing them
[1:27:27] together
[1:27:28] and they get together on swarm just
[1:27:32] before they fly out of here oh my
[1:27:36] yes sir why it is revival time
[1:27:40] a sentence revival time do you believe
[1:27:43] it it's revival time it's jubilee time
[1:27:47] it's rapture time it's the harvest time
[1:27:50] it's going home in the presence of the
[1:27:53] living god hallelujah what is it they
[1:27:56] all get together and they begin to
[1:27:59] chatter you never heard such chattering
[1:28:02] and fellowshipping in all your life than
[1:28:05] to hear them geese get together or them
[1:28:08] ducks i never heard such and there is no
[1:28:12] better way for them to do it than that
[1:28:15] way swarming together first do you get a
[1:28:17] blueprint there
[1:28:19] you think the prophet is giving us a
[1:28:21] blueprint there
[1:28:22] praise god and remember
[1:28:26] ducks
[1:28:27] will never change no matter what age
[1:28:30] they're in ducks will always be ducks
[1:28:34] they will swarm each year whatever year
[1:28:38] that is he's talking about the church
[1:28:40] ages and so on like that that they swarm
[1:28:43] you say oh they used to do that back
[1:28:45] then no he's telling you this is your
[1:28:47] time now this is the time for the
[1:28:50] rapture time now it's a uniting time now
[1:28:53] it's a time for the bride of christ to
[1:28:56] swarm together
[1:28:58] under their inspiration instinct and
[1:29:01] revelation of the world
[1:29:04] we are not here to bring him down by
[1:29:07] beating down him with music
[1:29:09] we are not here with all kinds of
[1:29:11] programs to bring him on the scene
[1:29:14] we're not here with food because some
[1:29:17] people are attracted by food so we
[1:29:19] always want to be feeding people so
[1:29:21] they're attracted by the food and they
[1:29:23] want to come for the food no no no no
[1:29:26] the real food we want to come for is the
[1:29:28] word of god
[1:29:30] the food we want to come for is the
[1:29:32] bread of life
[1:29:33] something that will feed your soul amen
[1:29:36] praise god hallelujah
[1:29:38] amen and that's the reason they swarm
[1:29:42] because god knows that and he sends his
[1:29:46] word
[1:29:48] at that season
[1:29:50] amen he sends it so that that word can
[1:29:53] be made manifested hallelujah you see
[1:29:57] that's what the swarm is about they
[1:29:58] clocked the word and the swarming is
[1:30:00] them manifesting that word each one
[1:30:03] manifests in the word that's what
[1:30:04] happened in the upper room they caught
[1:30:06] the revelation and they were swarming
[1:30:09] together 120 of them shouting and
[1:30:12] praising god and giving glory to his
[1:30:15] mighty name and when they are like that
[1:30:18] you see i don't care what or how many
[1:30:22] other things they've seen and whatever
[1:30:24] else they go on but when they see that
[1:30:28] word that god really promised being
[1:30:32] vindicated there is nothing going to
[1:30:35] stop them
[1:30:36] at that time nothing will stop them
[1:30:39] who's going to stop you brother brother
[1:30:41] bill
[1:30:42] nothing's going to stop you brother
[1:30:43] daddy nothing's going to stop any of us
[1:30:46] nothing is going to stop brother tim
[1:30:49] beers hallelujah nothing going to stop
[1:30:51] any of us hallelujah wherever we are the
[1:30:55] same holy spirit comes upon us and
[1:30:58] nothing will stop us glory to
[1:31:01] hallelujah
[1:31:03] here not long ago that's out of god's
[1:31:05] provided way for this day
[1:31:08] this day notice the emphasis this day

[1:31:22] and the crows kept coming by
[1:31:25] trying to eat up his corn
[1:31:28] so
[1:31:28] he caught one of them and tied them by
[1:31:32] its foot
[1:31:33] and that all crow hobbled all around
[1:31:36] and jumped hobbled jumped hubble jumped
[1:31:39] but he couldn't get away because he was
[1:31:42] tied up but yet he was starving in there
[1:31:47] starving to death he couldn't fly or
[1:31:49] jump up
[1:31:50] all the crows will come and says johnny

[1:31:54] up i can't go south uh and so look poor
[1:31:59] johnny crow

[1:32:09] and turned him loose and said there you
[1:32:12] go oh boy you're free now you're free to
[1:32:15] go
[1:32:16] he walked away but the old crow kept
[1:32:19] walking
[1:32:20] in the same circle
[1:32:23] hallelujah that he walked before he
[1:32:26] walked in the same circle
[1:32:28] he was untied
[1:32:30] but you see
[1:32:32] he didn't know he was untied
[1:32:35] he was still thinking he was tied up the
[1:32:38] other crows came by and said come on
[1:32:40] johnny let's go south it's coming winter
[1:32:43] he said i can't i'm still tired i'm
[1:32:46] still tired and that's the way it is
[1:32:49] with men and women today see
[1:32:52] they don't know their position
[1:32:55] in jesus christ
[1:32:57] the devil might have tied you up yes he
[1:33:00] might have tied you up and some of you
[1:33:02] may be here today with different things
[1:33:03] and that will tie you up tie you up in
[1:33:06] that way physically i'm talking about
[1:33:08] maybe spiritually you have to know it
[1:33:11] maybe he tied you up with with uh
[1:33:12] tuberculosis maybe he tied you up with
[1:33:15] cancer he's trying to obstruct your
[1:33:17] usability uh
[1:33:19] as a servant and daughter of the living
[1:33:22] god he's trying to obstruct he's trying
[1:33:24] to undermine everything else he's trying
[1:33:27] to do that but see praise god
[1:33:30] forevermore he tried to tie you with
[1:33:32] circumstances of sickness
[1:33:35] tried to tie you with circumstances of
[1:33:38] not having enough money
[1:33:40] now i believe christians have a right to
[1:33:42] prosper
[1:33:44] amen praise god and one day maybe i'll
[1:33:47] get back to brother branham's preaching
[1:33:50] on why christians should prosper
[1:33:54] of course he talks about uh christians
[1:33:56] some are going to be poor some are going
[1:33:58] to be this way some are going to be that
[1:34:00] way talk about the pride an arrogance
[1:34:02] that comes with too much wealth but
[1:34:05] his way of bringing it i'll talk about
[1:34:07] that another time but here he says here
[1:34:11] the devil may have tied you up amen you
[1:34:14] may be tied up with any other thing
[1:34:16] praise god you know you could be in the
[1:34:18] service here today and the sermon is
[1:34:21] being preached and you're worrying about
[1:34:23] your rent your mortgage
[1:34:25] you see
[1:34:26] those are the ways he ties you up
[1:34:29] because your mind is distracted off of
[1:34:31] the word
[1:34:32] and on to something else that you
[1:34:35] legitimately ought to be concerned about
[1:34:38] you know and but he knows when he
[1:34:40] creates that condition and that state of
[1:34:42] worry many conditions that
[1:34:45] creates that situation where you're
[1:34:47] thinking about this or that you can't
[1:34:49] pay attention you can't receive the word
[1:34:51] of god because you're blocked your own

[1:52:08] starts to rise so higher

[1:52:12] that they could literally put up with
[1:52:15] one another
[1:52:16] they can put up with me and my ways of
[1:52:19] doing things why don't i speak scholarly
[1:52:23] why don't i give appropriate lecture
[1:52:27] with the proper gestures
[1:52:30] and why don't i do
[1:52:32] like they might have taught me in school
