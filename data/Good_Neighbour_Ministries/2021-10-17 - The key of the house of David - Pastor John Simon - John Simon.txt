inspired and then he sat on a juniper tree and he was because of pride he was asking god to take his life elijah you know after he had 400 prophets killed him and then all of a sudden he's asking god to take his life because jesus was coming from some time we find ourselves in times of weakness but we gotta keep pressing on because this is the hour we're not wrestling against flesh and blood

many believe that this falling hallelujah [Applause] i read a quote this morning on the lifeline says and sometimes we have trouble we have more troubles when we become a christian and when we did when we were sinners because it is written many afflictions of the righteous but god delivered him from them all god promised many afflictions strange feelings and strange things that would be beyond our understanding but it's always done for our good amen we just can't understand it because if we did then it would not be a faith to us we would go with an understanding but when we do and we have it and we believe by faith his word that it's going to work for our own good how many say that this morning he is jehovah he is jehovah this morning amen you can have your seed [Music] hallelujah

me [Music] he brought me oh [Music] somebody say amen somebody said praise the lord [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] thanks be to god may the lord bless us all here today in his presence please be seated thank god we're now in the fall of the year and all the trees are beginning to as i usually say are beginning to show their true colors and as we come to this time when the lord is harvest time and dying for thanksgiving day in heaven and collecting and harvesting his fruits then every tree will show its true color every believer will show their true colors of what was hidden underneath what looked like just green but the true colors are starting to come out gradually and that's the way god planned it all and so therefore as a minister as a pastor i am a shepherd and the shepherd doesn't chase after sheep sheep naturally follow the shepherd even when they don't understand they don't even know where the shepherd is going they just follow the shepherd what goats they know so they run ahead they just run ahead of the shepherd they're jumping they're scampering there doing all kinds of things now the shepherd doesn't chase goats he just walks and the sheep follow him because their faith in the shepherd is what does that mean and that's all he has praise the lord so i thank the lord for his grace for his love and his mercy be given praise and glory to give glory to god i believe in uh by next week you should be entering into a study of the 40 days what is it brother danny 40 days of prayer many years ago we did 40 years days of purpose but now we're going to be doing 40 days of prayer praise the lord are you ready for this you believe it's going to be a blessing i believe it's going to be a real blessing as the lord will give our brother or brothers wisdom in how to bring this forth of course we know the format there's a lot of people in this matches are so idiotic i'm sorry i've used a word like that but um it's just they think that all this person did that they are in a denomination so i can't use that this but brother branham gathered up the lost things and as i'm standing here i'm telling you i find many places in various persons dr ironside this one that one in different denominations some didn't believe in no denomination and he gathered up whatever he extract what was the truth and then he took it all together amen i find where he could i can tell where he found uh uh what's the script there they crucified him that was that was men wise men holy man anointed by god had some of those stuff already but the way he brought it with the revelation on it they didn't get there but they got the thought and it just laid there for years waiting for prophet to come were there things laying out there for us right and god used these people in many ways to to present these things and so uh god bless blessed to your hearts as we applied from the point of view of the message of the sow right representing it from the point of view of the message of this hour amen anything that is a a pit or a stone or something else that's going to be spot out like brother brandon said you eat the cherry but what you're worried about that stuff you got discernment now to be able to discern the stuff so what you're worrying about hey man you know you know what to spit out my butt bones to throw aside and what to eat so you know so by now you should at least you should know if you don't know something is wrong with you you know praise god so the hour is here upon us praise the name of the lord glory to god i would like to pay respect to uh brother vin dial dear precious wife has passed away a deer's sister has crossed over the river jordan and gone into the presence of the lord amen and a week ago i think it's his brother's wife also passed away and crossed over to the other side so i want to publicly acknowledge that i'm aware of this and as a church we sympathize with those who are left behind doesn't matter how christian we are if we really are christian we're going to feel it here we know where they're going but there is a separation and when that separation comes we feel it in our hearts but one day there will be no more sea no more separations anymore but will be together again as one in christ amen praise the lord the love of god fills our hearts and the love of god reaches out to all wherever they are that are in that kind of tragedy at this particular time we know brother coffee is over there at his mom's funeral as they are laying her to rest may god be with him sister mary bring them back safely under the grace of god hallelujah and the the preacher whose church i preached in washington dc just so happens he sent a message and giving greetings and everything else and he will be listening to the broadcast now that he knows it's on youtube because he is now the assistant to the vice president of the nation there and he remembers very much and he's just saying you know he wants the truth and he's a believer the message anyway so he will be listening to this uh this broadcast so may god bless you friends and we thank the lord for his goodness and his grace because it's growing it's a blessing some of these sermons that go out when i started you would have maybe the views of the congregation but now sometimes one hour after i'm done there's over 800 on something people that have watched or listened in some way or the other so if it's just that the lightest god is spreading out there and the hunger of believers who are not hearing the fullness of the word or the truth as they should receive it uh they are tuning in and let's trust god that he will continue to bless them in every way we appreciate it i want to say very much today it struck my heart so much how much i appreciate brother anthony mercy always at the back there praise the lord hallelujah you know him [Applause] and all the efforts he's making and how he's growing into his position and certainly um we see the hand of god upon his life amen and we thank the lord jesus for that and we want to thank god for all these wonderful singers and worshipers you know you have to have the tribe of judah that comes before with the singing and praises to create the atmosphere for the ark or the word to come on the scene so god bless every one of you here today and we appreciate it very very much god bless every one of you i appreciate it very much god bless you you can be seated now amen so we i just wanted to publicly express that because the lord put it on my heart yeah that that's not just me deciding that oh today i'm gonna uh but you know i've sat in there just reviewing and then it struck me why don't you say this do that so that's what i'm doing here you take it however you want it but i want to say that we appreciate it and it's a blessing to the body of christ now i want to thank god for brother alvin in the back who has taken charge of the media section of our group here and thank god god is inspiring him he's he's catching on to these things wonderfully well and using him in a wonderful way amen praise the lord god bless you brother [Applause] i don't want brother mike to get jealous because we'll leave him out but he's not left out because his years of service amen and we thank god for what a night [Applause] and we older men have to start getting used to being backups ah i see anyway but that's how it is and it's not easy when we have to step back because you still have that you know in your heart you want to do this do that do the other but the time is passed you need to take a little holiday and a rest is that right yeah i've preached for an entire year here going all the time by the grace of god and i haven't stopped or anything so i'm going to take a little pause is that okay with you and uh brother danny is going to step in here for a while of course if i'm needed i'm you know i'll be right there but we thank the lord jesus for this opportunity so um i don't know what my wife and i are going to do but we're going to take a little pause and let the holy spirit refresh and refill so that i can be a blessing to you now today we have a marv marvelous and wonderful subject and i must say i was preparing something completely different and while i was preparing that i had to put it aside because three words just kept coming and so what is this what is this and i just then went to the bible the scriptures and then i went to the message and then i really realized what it is of course i knew what it is but not in not to take it and expand on it and i want to thank the lord for that because the message comes directly from the lord hallelujah so i want you to know that right praise the lord all right let's turn to our scriptures and that is found in matthew 25 1 to 13 and that is about the 10 virgins after which we will read from revelation 3 7. okay then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened onto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were wise took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bright room carried they slumbered and slept and at midnight a cry a shout was made behold the bridegroom cometh going out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you praise the lord hallelujah amen now i i i don't want to break in on this but you see there's a little thing there about given where god is showing you yes give all you can but don't give to the point where you're endangering your own survival you see it there you see where it's right there not so right because there is not enough now for us and you you should have been gathering those times but now you didn't and the wise said not so lest there be not enough for us and you see they're willing to share but there wasn't enough now but goyi rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and their door was shot hallelujah afterwards came also other virgins saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not speaking on the church ages i explained that already right the virgins they will be in the second resurrection but you were not for known to be in the bride i i don't know you watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour when the son of man cometh okay revelation 3 7 and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write these things said he that is holy he that is true he that had the key of david he that opened it and no man shattered and shut it and no man open it gracious heavenly father as we surrender our being to thee for the word to come forth for to bless your people we pray that the holy spirit will use us for your glory and for your honor in jesus name amen and amen please be seated up folks hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen the topic is the key of the house of david now philadelphia change i have set the open door i have set the open door and i have the keys i am the only one that can open it in other words i am the only one that can reveal it for i have the keys no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that the father has given me shall come to me amen praise god no church no organization no bishop no pope none can open none can shut you out only jesus christ for he alone holds the key he is the only one that can hold what the keys of david amen see for he is the one that will sit on the throne of david david oh no wonder he said i have the keys of david i'll open this door and nobody can shut it when i open it aren't you happy amen and nobody can shut it see oh my you see what is he speaking of anointed once at the end time he that abideth in me in other words he opens to him that was in my root at the beginning that's the reason jesus is brought root and offspring of david for he is before david he was in david and he is after david he has bought the root and the offspring of david brought the root and the fruit rose of sharon morning star lily of the valley alpha and omega father son holy ghost amen he is the fullness of the godhead now bodily amen praise god amen so what he is saying he that is of my elected life the predestinated life that is in me amen that he is the word from the beginning when he comes forth then he or she will bear my fruits but then others will live by the same thing same message same word amen and they will even call themselves christians and even that they are believers but remember not all them that say it unto me lord lord will enter him not all that come in the message and say their believers are going to enter in let's start facing the facts this is my election this is not by my being the pastor i'm sympathetic with with sister so and so so i'm going to pray and ask the lord to give her a pass that she might go in it doesn't work that way no it's come down to the individual now it's not group no more it's individual god is dealing with amen hallelujah now this that i'm speaking of is to take place and to be manifested in the last days now he's talking prophecy here now he's saying this what i'm talking about this is going to be manifested in the last days at the time when the mystery of god should be finished right when the mystery is being made known and finished to those people those elected that come from his roots amen praise god that time when that happens it will be made manifested in the last days oh praise god aren't you happy amen i trust you can you can see that by him opening up the word of god of course i'm speaking about the key of the house of david hallelujah think about it right amen your god you must they never use the right key because back then he said even david having an anointing on him having a desire for god but not taking the run of the scriptures nor having the key listen the key of revelation amen all of them were anointed too along with him and they were doing a good thing shouting together praising god for a wonderful thing amen praise god and it looked exactly right it looked like they were bringing back the word see oh back to the house of god but you see god dishonored the whole thing with all the shouting all the praising all that god disordered the whole move because they never used the right key to begin with david included they didn't use the right key to get in to the door amen the door just did not unlock at that time because it was not the right key he says now remember that what i say and keep that in mind are you going to remember this are you going to keep this in mind he's speaking about the key of the house of david and i'm not talking about the gold key or brass key or whatever key he used on his palace but that was only a symbol or a type to the key of revelation that opens the door to the word of god the power of the holy spirit prophecy all these major things in the bible it opens up the entire world when you have caught the genuine spirit of revelation hallelujah and this is what god wants me to tell you amen because i didn't plan to speak on this i had my my own thought but then all of a suds key of david the key of david why is that bothering me so of course i went and started to pray and search the word praise the name of the lord amen hallelujah think of it now that key think of it the key of david he the one that has the key of david remember this remember it he that is true it brings him to him christ the perfect realization amen contrast that with them with partial realization here it is moses was a prophet of god like unto uh you see there he was now what he's trying to say here i won't go over all that but that you had all these prophets prophets and god use prophets but it's not the prophets it's when jesus himself come on the scene who is the god of the prophets and he wants you to recognize this that you had messengers and messengers and the last messenger was a prophet like unto moses but thank god the word himself is on the scene revealing himself for christ is the mystery of god being revealed amen christ himself being revealed hallelujah praise god amen amen think of it my friends key of the house of david isaiah 22 22 he says remember it tells us that the key in the house of david would lay upon his shoulder and so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open it doesn't matter who hold triple keys in front of them and it looks so impressive and symbolic it doesn't matter how many millions believe that somebody can shut you out of heaven or cast you down to hell jesus is saying no man no bishop no superintendent no pope no pastor nobody can shut you in or shut you out i am the only one that can do that for i hold the key of david in my hands amen i open and no man shut your understanding anymore i open and no man can blind you anymore when i shut your understanding none can open it they can't do it it's impossible for them to do it hallelujah now the spirit uses this old testament reference concerning jesus christ amen and his ministry in the church he's saying what talking about the key on the shoulder of dave of of of his servant uh how that that is a symbol or type or prophecy of jesus christ and his ministry within the church now you see what the key of david quoting him signified at that time was just a mere shadow of what it is now right for it is fulfilled in jesus christ standing in the midst of the lampstands it has to do with our lord after his resurrection oh my you see a lot of people say oh i know jesus oh i met jesus i know i met the lord i had an experience and so on so dave that's fine a lot of people met him in his form of his word form when he was here on earth brother branham putin he said some were so close they act with him they fished with him they slept with him every day he said but they still didn't know him didn't have a revelation yet of who he was amen praise god see but my he says but this has to do not with him before his resurrection but after his resurrection praise god years ago and i remember brother a brother by the name of brother robinson wherever he is now i don't know but he preached a message yes you say you met him but have you met him since he's risen have you met him since he's changed his form has you met him in his glorified fashion amen and that's the question with a lot of people you know i know the word i know the bible i know this i know that but have you met him hallelujah and when he was resurrected you couldn't just go and meet him he came and appeared wherever he wanted to appear he appeared to who he wants to appeal to he just come and make himself known display himself peace be unto you glory to god hallelujah it's the same thing now what is supernatural form amen think about it after his resurrection not during his earthly pilgrimage see but what does the key signify the answer lies in the position of the key the key is not in his hands it is not worn around his neck it is not placed into the hands of other men amen for he said he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shots and no man no matter who he is has the right to that key but jesus himself right but where is the key it is on his shoulder what does this shock what does he do with it on his shoulder isaiah 9 6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder what government upon his shoulder now here comes this this view from the wedding ceremony of the east you see how everything is coming now into focus you see how the holy spirit is bringing everything for us to really understanding if we're elected to him he's gone from the key on the shoulder to our wedding right now let's see the connection now comes the wedding ceremony of the east when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and she places it over the groom's shoulders signifying that she is now under his leadership she has transformed her rights to him and he is now her head see but also that he has responsibility for her care amen and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right or responsibility or beloved the key of david god is sovereign hallelujah by divine decree he knew who would be in his bride and he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not call him but she came on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and him alone she is only committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head for christ is the head of the church praise the lord now listen carefully here for he just says it and the rest is unwritten so believe me listen she lays her veil on his shoulders right for the government is upon his shoulder but in isaiah we read that the key was on his shoulders but then what really happened is this because you know brothers have come and said we have no choice because he chose you from before the foundation of the world and if the spirit doesn't guide you you would think that they're right even with reading this you didn't choose him he chose you right but he still as i've taught before had to come to you and give you the opportunity to accept him accept his choice see arrest we wouldn't be given um what's the word a free moral agency god didn't want robots program somebody to love him he want them to do it out of their own heart so there had to be an acceptance of his choice is that right okay so to accept his choice she takes her veil that she had amen remember the word the veil before her face the foil that was over her eyes she took it off and placed it on his shoulders my she letting him see her in her fullness of our beauty is that right her eyes are now open the veil that she had when she looked tried to look through it at the word she couldn't see as clearly now as she as she can see now because she take off the veil you gotta accept revelation in other words you can't drive it away and say no that can't be god that i didn't read that in the bible so that's not i didn't read the prophet quote that so where does he get that from where did that come from see then you have a problem you don't have faith amen you don't recognize him when he's speaking right you recognize everybody else but you don't recognize his voice oh my but remember she throw the veil on her on his shoulders showing that she accepts his choice but what is not written there is that he turns her wrong and gives her the keys that he had with the key that he had on his shoulder the key of revelation because he now gives her the key amen because she is his queen and every wife is a queen in her house and to her husband and as a result of that he takes the key of his whole house and give her the key you got the key to my whole house now you're in control i open up the door of the world to you by revelation and you got the key to the door you let the key to all of the world you may not understand what is in every room but year after year month after month as you go through the house you're going to find out what i got stored up in there oh praise god hallelujah i'm so happy for the key of the house of david it was on his shoulder but now it's in my hand lord of god hallelujah remember the key of the house of david is the master key it's the master's key and he gives her the master key to every revelation every prophecy every thing hid in the word she gives her the master key brother oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah but back then men didn't used to store sheep and cow and wheat and corn and and goods and food stuff in their house they they had to have a big huge storehouse and in that storehouse they would store up everything they need within that storehouse so when he gave her that key it was not just a key for the house but the a key for the storehouse hallelujah that she can take out any goodies that she wants in that storehouse and make up a good meal with it and rejoice hallelujah christ be to god i'm happy that we have the key to god's storehouse i'm glad he sent a prophet that left the storehouse and i'm glad the storehouse is filled with a lot of good things green stuff apples beautiful stuff that's all inside of the storehouse but you've got to have the key before you can go in the schoolhouse hallelujah and the key that was on his shoulders that key goes to his bride it goes to the queen it goes to his wife she can now open the front door and go out and come in where they shall go out of the prophecy said and come in whenever they like because they have the key amen that they can go out and come in whenever they want hallelujah praise god hallelujah now remember in how in the key to the door philadelphia church age message of grace anointed once at the end time paragraph 22 now remember how that an angel in revelation he said it's 13 or 19 and uh see coming with a great key within his hand notice the purpose of a key is always to unlock something to open up something that's been locked up for years oh thank god the secret hit for ages and generations things the angels desire to look into and now here comes an angel from heaven with a great key that can unlock every door and open everything for the glory of god hallelujah but one foot on time and one on eternity and said time shall be no more your changes are over back to the lord back to christ go back where you come from amen glory to his marvelous wonderful name think about that a key is always given with a purpose amen not all it is should it lock something that is locked up can be unlocked but it can also lock up something if it wants to amen now i wouldn't pause here but let me just throw this out there's the church having the power of binding and losing and a key is given amen now she just got the key but now he's talking now about why a key is given is given with a purpose now remember there are many kinds of keys how many knows that some of us right now maybe have a bunch of keys right anybody here have a bunch of keys take it out let me see right praise god praise the lord hallelujah amen i'd like to take it out for my own inspiration because we have many uses for kids right you're always locking up things at the end of this he says why would you need a key if something isn't worthwhile if something is worthwhile or valuable that's when you lock it up right and then you go back and you unlock it when you need it right praise god you don't take your money and put it on a cart by the way side no you take it home lock it in the safe or put it in the bank or something right and then when you're ready to use you unlock it because now you're ready to use it and he puts that key in the hand of his queen his bride to lock and unlock whenever she wants to lock and unlock thanks me to god the word is now with in the bride and she knows what to do with the word she knows what to do with it amen hallelujah think of it now remember there are many kinds of keys and many uses of keys he says now remember he says remember this there is keys that you must use for this storehouse and there is keys that you must use to go home to your own house right and there's a key for transportation he says buy an automobile my goodness a key for the storehouse a key for your own house and the key for your transportation he's talking about revelation here you've got to have a revelation of how to go in that storehouse amen not anybody can walk in the storehouse is that right and to get back to heaven in the rapture you've got to have a rapture revelation to be able to go into your own house is that right and for the transportation to get to go there you better have a revelation to be able to be transported back where you come from hallelujah so that's useless for keys and there's a use for this key of the house of david oh blessed be the name of the lord think of it he says but watch it now be careful because there are them who have keys also that can be made and what we will call a skeleton key that word skeleton my see no it's not the real key it's a skeleton key now he's talking about satan now he's going to copy the word i'm going to presume he's going to try all kinds of stuff to be able to get in the storehouse to get into heaven to get in the wedding supper without the robe right robe and so on he's alluding to all these things while he's talking amen how you know that well he didn't say it in the word but i know that amen but watch here think of it they can be duplicated what we call the skeleton key it's a key that's made with levers act on it and a key that has a lot of twists in it a skeleton key it's always twisting the word telling you they got the key to the word and the key to the word but they got to twist it right they gotta they always twist in the word put a twist on the word but we're not here to twist in the word since we put the key the lock opens the lord of god because we have the real key of god the key to the house of david spiritual house of david blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah see it's just a frame amen they tried to say it can unlock any door in other words it's in opposition to the real key tell you they can open any door you say you lock it and you you you're the only one can shut it and open it well i got a skeleton key here it can open up any door right see it can only open but almost any door call the skeleton key it's just a frame it can be unlocked that way they can use it just on houses automobiles things like that can be duplicated amen but you see friends let's get down to it a key cannot open anything unless it's used by a hand it's got to be placed in somebody's hand for them to use and then they can use the key are you following me here praise god are you really quiet today we praise god but i can sense that quietness is not the normal quietness of disinterest but of real interest amen praise god but the key is of no use until it gets in somebody's hand i'm so glad you got it in your hand you got the power in the name of jesus it's in your hand brother sister the revelation of the word you didn't claim it but it struck you by the grace of god and you are here by the grace of god hallelujah and he has made known himself to you amen to you it looks so easy but to them trying to get in there it's a lot of work we got to study all night i studied for 40 years you know 30 years i've been in this message brother brother glenn oh my god oh my praise god amen hallelujah and they're boasting and talking about all the sins that don't mean nothing to god because he set it up in such a way that the person can come in at the last hour last our workers and he decided to pay them the same pay like you getting what are you going to do about it glory be to god hallelujah amen revelation can strike anyone and right where we are we're waiting for that last one to come in we're waiting for the last worker we're working for the last sea we're waiting for it to come by the opening of the word of god hallelujah amen yes sir think of it you got to have a key and the key cannot use its own self it's got to have something in her hand he says now just like a microphone he says the microphone is here he says but the microphone cannot speak of itself it can't do it if it's speaking it's got to be somebody or something speaking through it it's just a microphone it's the voice that's behind that microphone that is transmitting an airwave that you can hear now that's the way it is we ourselves as ministers we are not the gospel hallelujah we are not him right we are only transmitters that transmit the voice of god amen through our agency of man and being men humans to the hearers they're able to hear the wave the sound but it is not the microphone it's the voice behind the microphone i usually say listen for the voice behind the voice amen that's what you must listen for see if so that's the way it is praise the lord praise god the hand unlocks the the door with the key so it's got to be in hand and the only hand that will be allowed to hold this key is the hand of faith faith is a what that's the only hand that can hold this you got one tiny inkling and then it takes you to the bigger thing and it unlocks the whole thing before you it's got to be in the hand now think of it many will take another key the key to knowledge they want to go in the door too so they take the key of knowledge and then man what do they do trying to accumulate knowledge they think by getting all accumulation of human knowledge they're gonna find out the truth they're gonna find out the secret they're gonna find out the mystery they're gonna break into the half hour silence by study they're gonna do it they're gonna accumulate by knowledge see you say there's the key see they're trying to use that key of knowledge hallelujah he'll go there and he'll get himself lots of books get himself learning but he cannot for no one can learn this is that the truth no one hallelujah the only way it can be done he himself has got to catch that key that's something that something is there that will unfold or reveal to him that knowledge of what he is really seeking hallelujah oh my praise god you can't even put that to words you can see here he can't even put it to work but because you have entered in you are understanding what he's saying but you say that to somebody else they think you're going a cuckoo or something my something is going after you he says it's the same thing praise god many others will try to play a piano or to music or music they want to have the key to music you see they want to enter in because one person has to play music and if they don't have a script in front of them they're lost it's gone but there's another guy he never read one script or maybe a few scripts or little scripts but after a while he realized it's not just the script you got to go by the script but it's not really the script and then the next thing that i start to innovate and the guys start to play the next thing you know you say oh he playing my air sound he's innovating and a man like other woman the master you want to know where is he or she getting that from where is it coming from they caught the key like brother branham said that unseen unknown something that you can't learn nobody can teach it to you he said they catch that something amen and once they caught that their break into it hallelujah because it's the holy spirit of the living god moving on the soul of the individual see many tried to play piano or music hallelujah but they still don't know just how to do it amen the teacher might give them lesson after lesson after lesson and they never could learn it never catch music but they're never really catching that key that essence that takes them to another level right think of it right you see they just cannot hold that key they're trying to find the key to that mystery of rhythm and the sounds of tuning and so forth that rings out it takes a key to do that amen and that's what he's saying some try to come by knowledge some try to come by music you know we got a lot of people like that out in in the world out there and even christianity they're singing they're jumping they're doing all kinds of things they think that's gonna break them and all of a sudden there's gonna be a supernatural something no no no no no you don't get it that way hey man god reveals himself to whomever he will amen the teacher he says can you give you all the lessons you like but until you break into that unseen something amen that only god can give that's why if a man lack revelation he lacks wisdom let him ask of god who will give liberally to whomever he will he will give liberally praise god whenever you see you're an elected seed and you're asking him man praise god he makes it long praise the lord if you're not you're not i don't know i i'm not here to judge but to tell you that he says some will try to come by the way of mathematics they think if they're going to bind us in laws a thousand years like a day therefore one hour is equal to you trying to approach the word from the point of view of mathematics or you uh try to cycle through the bible using how many chapters in the bible and how many this and that and you go through the physics and the calculus of the bible trying to put it together like that in mathematics he says yes there's even a key to mathematics but that's that's just a skeleton key that's not the real key that can get you into the presence of almighty god hallelujah see what he's showing you here there's a key to the house of david but the devil has people trying to enter into the wedding supper through windows through doorways with all kinds of different robes on all kinds of things on and they're using all kind of skeleton key to defy god that you say you're the only one with the key well i got a key too and i i'm gonna get him there whether you like it or not whatever and god is saying no none can enter there none i open and when i open all i open to you and you can enter if i shut the door none can enter here oh my and that that's the greatest mad level thought continues on amen okay and then he switches to talking about how atoms and so on like that and praise god and now he says but you see when men and women have something in their hand that they know they can do then that's something amen now when polio struck the nation of course i wasn't studying for this i just going along and it comes right in with what's going on right now amen and we're all com we were all commanded to go and get the vaccine so that we can stamp it out as a nation now i was with a doctor driving along the road a doctor from louisville he said i remember when the great plague hit louisville i saw 57 respirators on them people at one time men women boys girls paralyzed with that disease that called polio there was nothing we could do about it i never want to see that again i never he said so what happened good man science begins to fight they begged on the streets they begged for money they bummed and begged done everything they could trying to find the key that will unlock that door oh my finally god raised up a christian gentleman man by the name of dr salk and he found the vaccine right so we know it's god send the vaccine right why why was that it because it was evil it was evil but in the land at stake it was a killer amen there was a key that could then unlock see and sulk vaccine was the great treatment amen oh what that key can do that vaccine was brought forth and now by the vaccine is stamping out polio with that vaccine because my friends i tell you if there ever sometime when there is an evil in the land such as polio bacteria smallpox yellow fever tetanus and so forth see evils amen science fighting day and night to find an inoculation for them and they are doing so because it's fighting evil right it's evil and it's a killer right how much more if they are seeking a vaccine for men to end that should we seek for the key to salvation for man that's in satan's prison house of sin to bring them out by unlocking the door with the key to the house of david amen god giving back to his church the power of binding and losing hallelujah the key is being in your key being in your hand that you can rebuke satan you combine satan amen you can lose a person from a certain ailment or certain thing oh praise god hallelujah and the key works when it turns the lock find the key it's got to if you find a real true key it's got to be some treasure back there amen something worthwhile or you won't even bother to lock it up see so my it unlocks something worthwhile but when you find that what happens now he's coming back to today but today in our churches you start with that in the church you know what you'll find that will happen they'll show you the door right see the very master key the thing they should have right that very master key is the thing that they left out they left the corner stone the key stone which the builders did back there amen hallelujah one great preacher by the name of parker said remember the bible says builders he says to be a builder is not the carpenter the carpenter can use the hammer and do that but the builder has to be a specialist he has to know the everything about the house to be able to build a house and these men were specialists they were theologians they were scribes they were pharisees they were knowledgeable but they messed the case down that missed the cornerstone that threw him out he was the rejected stone oh praise god hallelujah amen think of it they cut him out amen and put him out now those of you who can see do you see why i'm i am interdenominational oh my oh my those of you who a masonic lodge i don't know if there's any of the mess those of the maisonic lodge in here and so forth once are you who know the order of course i am from the order of melchizedek all of you know that right now he says those of you who know the order and how the order teaches how they cut out the stones and hauled them to joppa and so forth and did it by an ox cart right taking them down now we know according to that the levites should have had it on their shoulders carrying it down but they added the ox cart now because it seemed faster and better and whatnot and the tall cedars of lebanon how they cut so forth and brought them down and the sound of a hammer and saw was not heard for the space of 40 years here comes a stone cut this way another one cut that way and one cut this way one that way and they found that every stone just when they try to put them together slip right into its place amen let me tell you friends all god's gifts are going to find their appropriate places and they're going to have to fight to do it you'll find your place and for those whom the scripture and there was no place found for them that will also be fulfilled for water goes down to its rightful levels wherever that is and that's where the word will take every one of us it'll raise you up or it'll take you down to whichever level you're supposed to be in amen they may not you may not just like to be like the other person but see it's the same way with believers in god every one of us has a place in this building of god i'm not talking about this church but in the building of god amen hallelujah we are not just you are not and may not just be like the other one but we have got a place in here we got a place in god's body in god's building in god's kingdom we got a place that's why paul said if you compare yourselves among yourselves is you're not wise because each stone got different and it's got to fit a certain place and nobody else can do your job or whatever because they're not made for that even if they try to do it they're going to do it differently they can't do it like you because you are made separate amen everyone a born-again christian you got a place there and them builders running back over and over looking at the stone and they said no i can't see the stone being any good it's a freak stone amen what we caught here is just a freak brother that's what some of them thinking it's going to pass it's going to pass away but this ain't a freak this isn't something eternal this is going to take us from art to glory it's going to take us out of here we know we got a hold of the something real and something true according to the word of god hallelujah amen oh my now they have kicked the stone into over there in the weed files amen they call it false doctrine amen even in this message some say oh you're going too far now i don't understand that i don't see that i don't know where's that they don't understand god doesn't change he's still the mighty god he's still sending forth his word you think it stopped right there god is marching on amen and the word is pouring out all the time but it must be in line with the written word hallelujah praise god now think about it now the search then asserts threw away the real stone and what does that do it took them to a halt they had to stop their building because they don't have the keystone the cornerstone they couldn't go any further because the very stone they thrown away was the chief cornerstone was the keystone that threw that away and that's where it is today brother sister instead of the cornerstone listen he says that we have taken theology we have taken schooling we have taken education i use the word knowledge just to make it try to come in by knowledge some try to come in by religious knowledge some try to come in by all kinds of means right that way hallelujah they're trying to enter god's storehouse of his word to enjoy the same things you are enjoying without coming in by the official way they want to come in their own way or or some way that they are making up amen he said now listen education is wonderful it's but it's been the greatest hindrance to the gospel that it's ever had i am not saying that you should be ignorant or something you don't have to be ignorant and you should put everything you should get education but brother but people are putting their everything on education and theology which is what the devil did with eve he tried to give her knowledge intellectual knowledge when we use this word intellectual we are thinking of high intellect like einstein and these people before we think intellectual but that's not it as long as you are approaching it from the point of view of your own human resource and accumulation of books and knowledge and so on through years and time and so you are missing the mark completely you can have a man that's been there doing every possible thing and one day he just sit down by himself and just like that and you maybe was preaching against this guy and telling me lost you're going to hell i don't know who's going to hell i don't know nothing if you know you step but i don't know so i'm here just to preach the word of god and let the holy spirit take his own people his own and place them and do his separation and do his guiding let him do that that's my business my abilities preach the word [Applause] and that's why they don't understand oh you want to welcome people into the church all well dressed beautifully write down long dresses beautiful suits and men with nice pants and shirts and whatnot if somebody walks in that dress right they don't look right according to church standards right away you getting worked up i don't let people like that in my church what nonsense you're talking about those are the people he wants to come in [Music] you don't know what's behind that you don't know what's hiding behind there you don't know you can look like a jacob and you know and behind that being a jacob could be a man that will go and fight with the angels and another one coming looking like a gentleman with suit and everything else so you can be crooked as a dark side leg right so so let god do that praise the name of the lord see a lot of preachers that's what they want to do they want to have a church full of clean nice fish right since they put their hook in the water oh my god i got a fish the fish is ready clean scaled slimed off everything else done that's not how it works you got to they come and then you have to do preach the word for them to be cleaned up and scaled up and everything else right praise the lord but they want to have everything else like that but anyway praise the lord amen think about it they want to use education or knowledge as the key to open up the truths within the word of god and he says no i open and no man can shut up your understanding when i loose you from chains of darkness none can take you back to that spirit of blindness and ignorance that you are in you're free by the grace of god and by the power of the gospel of jesus christ hallelujah just let me preach some more brother and sister praise the name of the lord brethren see here he's speaking from the inside man he says i went to this city the other day and brother jean you know you brought me the mayor sent with you that key to the city amen but brother what i want is not the key to the city i want his key to the scriptures the key the great holy spirit to give me the key for the opening of the world oh my praise god the key to the house of david that's the key you need to hold in your hand glory to god not talking about opening up the natural temple of david but it's the spiritual temple of the word of god to be opened up to you by the grace of the living god oh my god my you talk about keys there is men that can fill up this hallway full of keys given to them by mayors and governors kings and kings and priests and princesses whatever but what does that mean if you got a you got a table or a box full of keys from from various cities i want the key to one city and that's the key to the new jerusalem oh praise god hallelujah amen friends think of it we are sitting here think of it we are sitting here knowing that we are already conquerors we already possess the gates of the enemy it has been given to us and the master key is now in our hand you heard what i said the master key is now in your hand oh praise god not the skeleton key amen but the master key is now within your hands you don't need to be in the masonic lobs to have that master key hallelujah you need to be my friends after the order of melchizedek to hold those kinds of keys that key amen for it opens not just a natural door it opens your eyes it opens your mind it opens your heart praise god to be able to see the things of god this key will open the gates to the sick people and the afflicted amen for in my name they'll cast out devils that's the key gives you the power hallelujah from the holy ghost they'll speak with new towns they'll take up serpents drink any deadly thing and it will not hurt them oh praise god they lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover when the devil start to know you got the real key and the one he has is false my god damns begin to scatter and run why you got the key to the house of david amen for he was wounded for our transgressions and by his stripes we were healed hallelujah you may not accept it and be healed this morning from all your sicknesses and diseases but in the name of jesus christ by his stripes we were already healed you are healed you're saved you're delivered you've been set free praise god i remember when i was a young man i may even have the book somewhere still where t.l osborn you know how he met brother branham and stuff started on his ministry and he wrote a marvelous book that's lost today is called three keys to the book of acts and in there he identified when reading the book of acts he noticed the word the word the word the word and then he said oh that's one key and then it goes on and they use the name right through the book of acts the name and that's another key right and the holy spirit they keep mentioning the spirit made me go the spirit led me the spirit this that that so the three keys to the book of acts the word the name and the spirit but we know by revelation is really one key but god bless him he saw something and it was a blessing to him and still a blessing amen for anyone that would read that book by t.l osborne called three keys to the book of acts now remember god holds the keys to the key to this revelation not keys but the key to this revelation amen of christ now schools of theology may try but they can never ever find it jesus said so amen hallelujah oh praise god in matthew 11 25-27 or thank me father you hit this from the eyes of the wise and the proven but you have revealed it the babes such as would learn scholars of that day jews pharisees sadducees herodians whatever else might have been their big organizations he told every one of them you're blind and you're trying to lead the people and you are blind years you're here to hear and you hear not eyes to see but you see not amen praise god think of it you are doing just like eve did back there you are accepting the intellectual side and not of the holy spirit revealing the word of god think about it brother sister amen the dynamic national he said the blind leads the blind they'll fall into a ditch national dutch amen house of hell gates of hell shall not prevail against the church of the living god for god himself alone holds the key what does the man say i the son of man i am he asked amen hallelujah let me say this the great master of all he holds the key he holds the master key for he is the master to the whole thing and he has the key within his hands blessed art thou he said to peter blessed art thou simon flesh and blood has never revealed this to you by my father which is in heaven and upon this revelation remember when you read it everywhere else it will say rock rock rock but he's making it plain here upon this revelation alone i will build my church and the gates of hell will never prevail against this revelation it will never prevail against it my brother sister lord of god and when i say that there is no school can do it no theologian no teachings of the bible school they know nothing about this they cannot know nothing about it it's impossible for them to know anything about it because god has already hidden their senses of knowing from getting to it he's hidden from all them elected them elected teachers and everything else out there and it has now come that this is now a personal individual affair of christ with that person revealing himself to them [Music] christ is the mystery of god revealed you say oh yeah he's been real to me then the life that was in that is in christ that is produced here in the bible that's the same life in there if it does not produce itself again in you you got the wrong revelation amen think of it the key given to me therefore for the messenger of each age that is the same key that might now be called the keystone of the entire bible the keystone of the bible it's the revelation that god never ever changes i'm closing now and when the last elected member of the body of christ comes in then the lord himself will appear oh blessed be the name of the lord brethren i've said what i can say of course there is much more that can be said if one were to uh like go and do an intensive study and there are many angles avenues and openings of which one can take and go in different directions with the word of the living god may the great holy spirit bless these thoughts to your heart and may the word of god be opened up to you in every possible way blessed be the name of the lord god bless you i'm looking forward to the beginning of the 40 days of prayer and trusting that we know prayer changes things and that there is power and prayer musicians singers are coming worship ladies are coming praise god hallelujah amen yes sir i tell you i thank god it gives me comfort and peace of mind to know that he has given us the key and that i don't have to really think about anything but i just go on with my bible or open up a message book and you know i can't these days i can't get very far by the time i read one or two sentences so much stuff begins to break i can't do nothing and you know i was telling some of you and i'm just talking now that i can see how that a lot of these preachers and teachers if not this message if they have no revelation they can only go so far and after that they're going to have to manufacture we can't go further i quoted you where i actually find where brother brown said they're gonna come to a halt they got nothing else nowhere else to go they'll go back to like a dark black twist vomit they'll go right back to their intellectuals they go back to their old church teachings or back to pentecost or back to luther back to some other age and they miss the key to the house of david that opens up everything what are you talking about what you talking about see that's only god can do that because it's by grace and by grace alone none can boast none can boast because only god can reveal his word for he is his own and he will make it ah he will make it plain come brother anthony god bless you brother the work you're doing sing for the glory of god god [Applause] praise the lord brother um brother phillip when simon comes out to the washroom would you tell her to come by the time you could come up praise the lord god bless you since this is the time of the year again when we have our pastor appreciation amen praise the lord and it was brother john duncan's birthday i think um and i wish him a happy birthday too praise the lord god bless him in a wonderful way praise the lord i don't have any birthday today so i don't know okay
