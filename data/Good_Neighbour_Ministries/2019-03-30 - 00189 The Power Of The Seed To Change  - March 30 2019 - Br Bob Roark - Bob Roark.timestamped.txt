[6:08] very very much
[6:10] while you're standing let's turn the
[6:12] Saint Saint Mark chapter 4 and if you
[6:20] don't want to read from the amplified
[6:25] that's ok
[6:34] I have 15 minutes to pack in an hour
[6:41] so mark chapter four tasting on that
[6:45] verses 26 through 929 and he said this
[6:51] is Jesus the master teacher so it's the
[6:54] king develop as if a man should cast
[6:57] seed into the ground and choose sleep
[7:00] and rise 90 days and the siege has
[7:03] sprung up in growth he knoweth not
[7:06] health for the earth brings forth fruit
[7:09] of herself the lane first the blade then
[7:13] to here and after that the full court in
[7:17] the youth but when the fruit is brought
[7:20] forth immediately he put a pen the
[7:23] sickle because the harvest see people
[7:28] hallelujah
[7:30] [Music]
[7:42] the kingdom of God is a lot of a man who
[7:45] scatters seed upon the ground and then
[7:47] continue sweeping for us ignited a
[7:50] policy the seed sprouts Minerva's and
[7:53] increases he knows about how the earth
[7:55] produces acted by itself first the blade
[8:00] then the ear the fulcrum in the ear open
[8:03] the greatest rock and permits and made
[8:07] in the east hence full of the Reapers
[8:08] and puts in the sickle because the
[8:11] harvest stands ready
[8:14] second Corinthians chapter three verse
[8:18] eighteen three but we all with an open
[8:36] face beholding as a neglect the glory of
[8:39] Lord are changed into the same image
[8:42] from Lord glory even as by the Spirit of
[8:47] the Lord from from the amplified but all
[8:55] of us as with unveiled face because we
[8:59] continued to behold in the Word of God
[9:03] as in a mirror the glory of the Lord our
[9:07] constantly being translated and to his
[9:10] very own image and if increasing
[9:13] splendor on from one degree of poverty
[9:17] to another or this comes from the Lord
[9:19] who is the spirit
[9:23] and let's set up this whole verse bezel
[9:27] watch the drillers chapter number four
[9:42] verse number 15 for this we say unto you
[9:46] by the word of the Lord that we which
[9:49] are alive and remain unto the coming of
[9:51] the Lord them which are asleep for the
[9:55] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[9:57] with a shout with the voice of the
[10:00] Archangel with the Trump of God and the
[10:02] dead in Christ shall rise first then we
[10:05] which are alive and remain shall be
[10:08] caught up together with them in the
[10:10] clouds to meet the lord in the air
[10:12] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[10:15] wherefore comfort one another with these
[10:18] words
[10:19] amen and we'll once again from the
[10:25] amplified
[10:39] verse 15 or this we declare to you by
[10:43] the Lord's homework that we who are
[10:45] alive and remain unto the coming of all
[10:48] or chela know what may proceed into his
[10:51] presence or have an advantage and all
[10:54] over those who have previously fallen
[10:56] asleep for the Lord Himself will descend
[11:00] from heaven with all that cry of summons
[11:06] with the shell of the Archangel and the
[11:09] blast of the trumpet of God and those
[11:11] who have departed this life in Christ
[11:13] will rise first then we the living ones
[11:17] who remain on the earth shall
[11:20] simultaneously be caught up along with
[11:22] the resurrect the dead in the clouds to
[11:25] meet the Lord in the air so always
[11:28] three-ton a fee of eternity shall be
[11:30] with the Lord therefore comfort and
[11:33] encourage one another with these words
[11:36] we can say there's a particularly but
[11:44] they statement appalled to the
[11:46] Corinthian church and not believers they
[11:51] to me they mirror one another real
[11:55] costly in in Thessalonians the word
[12:01] caught it from the Greek means pulled
[12:05] semantics taken like a thief like a
[12:11] thief does and I thought those these
[12:15] expressions are pretty irrelevant to us
[12:21] and Jesus said in a st. John chapter 8
[12:25] verse 31 if you continue in my word then
[12:28] you're my disciples
[12:33] some time ago I had I had to have some
[12:36] body work done all my behavior
[12:50] you know the owner of the body shop said
[12:55] this to me he said you can take a bumper
[12:57] and that was a part of the vehicle that
[13:00] needed attention amen you can take a
[13:02] bumper now he wants him in such bad
[13:06] shape but it was had been hit and he
[13:09] said you can take a bumper that's been
[13:12] damaged by an accident but the bumper is
[13:16] repairable it's dented maybe twisted and
[13:19] he said you can lay that in the on a hot
[13:23] day in the presence of the Sun and that
[13:26] bumper will return to its original floor
[13:35] yeah this is what the messenger said and
[13:39] I'm saying things that he said that are
[13:41] very familiar with each child whom I'm
[13:45] assuming with each of you if if not the
[13:48] majority by far he said one of the
[13:50] primordial and
[13:51] blinks in the presence of the Sun and
[13:56] rocketing our maturity
[13:58] along with that he says that when a
[14:01] bride recognizes who she is hoo-wee we
[14:10] use that word bride very long and very
[14:13] heard correct in its usage but there
[14:17] would never be a bride if there wasn't a
[14:19] broad girl the largeness of the focus to
[14:27] me should be on the bridegroom but said
[14:33] when she recognizes who she is then that
[14:39] will bring all the the body change our
[14:41] that we bring on a resident of this
[14:46] together and this evening that if
[14:47] there's any one whose wife has been
[14:50] twisted rent method' life or the god of
[14:55] this evil age then there is a there is a
[14:59] remedy for the
[15:04] that's not affected by that this
[15:08] particular world in some form right with
[15:11] the mental emotional physical financial
[15:14] due to fear marriage whatever we're not
[15:18] immune from that and we're not exempt
[15:21] from a menace ooh I'm assuming that
[15:24] perhaps in any group of people any group
[15:27] of gathering about there would be people
[15:30] whose lives have been negatively
[15:32] affected and that we could say that they
[15:34] have been twisted you see what he
[15:52] declared him in a promise or length of
[15:55] the platform he brings that the past and
[15:59] so heaven and earth will pass but his
[16:01] work will pass away living so as the
[16:05] instructions of the messenger then that
[16:07] we just stay in that presence yes yes
[16:11] what you'll return to your original
[16:20] so are you returning to your original
[16:24] heart then actually this work out of the
[16:28] season has reconnected the believer and
[16:33] the embraces of the Word of Life
[16:35] it has reconnected us at least in
[16:39] recognition for to our
[16:42] eternalness if we are we're in a
[16:47] temporal body but we came from another
[16:50] world and I don't want to use statements
[16:55] that you're so familiar with but you can
[16:57] say well I've heard that a million times
[16:58] but I think it's so nice to recognize
[17:01] that we're transient people where there
[17:09] is something in it on the inside of the
[17:13] predestinated believer see no God that
[17:17] is brewing
[17:19] and continuing to grow and in poverty
[17:23] that we are change from it is led to the
[17:38] vessel in Atkins that we've ever alive
[17:42] and remain shall be caught they have to
[17:46] be they mirror each other right it was
[17:48] seeing parable the recent in result re
[17:51] an objective that has been expressed in
[17:55] and that in result our objective or goal
[17:57] is that there is a full of the full life
[18:01] in Maxine passed through various stages
[18:06] but explored itself right into that in
[18:09] see for anybody so what is telling me to
[18:13] us that that must pass through this life
[18:21] was in the stock the lines in the blade
[18:24] the line amen come on a from now us for
[18:29] itself
[18:30] yeah
[18:31] see right friends we are so privileged
[18:37] we can participate that we can
[18:51] and this is changing us Flipkens 3 verse
[18:57] 20 and 21 if you would read that from
[19:01] the amplified very very quickly chapter
[19:04] 3 verses 20 and 21 and to me it's the
[19:11] goal of the and objective how that the
[19:14] seat of go verse 20 both and I really
[19:19] appreciated how this is working
[19:22] but we are citizens of a state
[19:26] Commonwealth homeland that just really
[19:31] grim face we are citizens of a state the
[19:35] Commonwealth with this common the
[19:45] citizens of the kingdom of God the
[19:48] homeland which is in heaven and from and
[19:51] also we earnestly patiently await the
[19:54] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[19:57] Messiah Savior who will transform and
[20:01] fashion a new the body of our
[20:04] humiliation to conform to and be like
[20:08] the body of his glory and majesty from
[20:12] into the mirror we are changed from
[20:15] glory to glory
[20:19] they meant can you imagine winning that
[20:21] when in troubles make the direction it
[20:23] from Egypt that unimportant to assume
[20:26] here of that there were people get that
[20:30] was advanced in age another cycle until
[20:33] saying to you that he had no need for a
[20:36] back in the cinemas those they were
[20:51] advanced in age and perhaps a life had
[20:55] been so long cruel to them not leaving
[20:58] them the best and they were someone
[21:01] handicapped they were perhaps disease
[21:04] and sick they were crippled can you
[21:08] imagine your and your mind when they
[21:11] began to eat chanting program cause
[21:16] that's the only place in not go meet
[21:19] with us right his mother
[21:23] so under the shed blood and that was
[21:26] applied on an and they begin to
[21:30] beat the Lambeth in the lab which it was
[21:33] a type of course of Christ or did they
[21:36] begin to make them can you imagine
[21:39] something supernaturally would have any
[21:43] any video game at cocktail hour run
[21:47] again to manifest itself in their body
[21:50] and they they can say without man
[21:53] something is a very to be
[22:10] [Music]
[22:12] 13 Papa and that's going to thank your
[22:14] body physically my body because that C
[22:18] is more powerful than the still pro body
[22:23] give you different focus but there is a
[22:26] seed of life all the inside there is
[22:30] greatness on the inside
[22:49] [Music]
[22:51] your pores there's a lot of stock
[22:57] churches there's a lot of shut churches
[23:00] there's a lot of cockroaches but then
[23:05] there's just there is a seed group and
[23:14] once again all that this once manifested
[23:18] it was that those spirits stages of
[23:21] growth stop
[23:23] Malaysia is now all in the sea this is
[23:34] just true that we assume so singing
[23:42] perspectives our pulsar this is reality
[23:48] Oh
[24:07] my brother sister Alton all the power of
[24:11] their party all the victory all the
[24:14] Dominion all the wisdom is now in the
[24:18] secret room or the opinions
[24:45] perhaps a gift of your parents your
[24:51] neighbors own or whoever it would be
[24:55] right if their opinion stop making
[24:59] amends that's a form you write it
[25:03] doesn't proceeding in your life
[25:07] the sister there is no saving to us a
[25:09] bath
[25:13] in the village yeah
[25:17] I think it is a close that we have sell
[25:20] sold ourselves very very short and we
[25:24] have really invest a matter of that we
[25:27] have done that
[25:28] we brought hurt you snort insult to the
[25:34] create for that region does better
[25:38] Indian aid us that wrote our names in
[25:42] the Lamb's Book of Life
[25:45] I think perhaps that we not only harm
[25:49] ourselves but have have we harmed the
[25:53] family ago and we harmed the kingdom of
[25:57] God and we harmed the progress of the
[26:00] dust just simply kept small thinking we
[26:05] will lose small fingers pop small things
[26:09] small talk small acts mom and so the
[26:12] three things fall and we talk we're
[26:15] going to we're going to really walk
[26:17] around very defeated because it's going
[26:20] to be over to me all the moments
[26:23] occurred to be look what's happened to
[26:25] me in Smith we can have our mantra dude
[26:29] washing the Lord
[26:31] and we can declare that creativity from
[26:41] physical genes right they may have not
[26:44] been the most brilliant I'm talking
[26:48] about they may not have been the most
[26:52] brilliant but when it comes to the the
[26:56] that birth and that life this actually
[27:10] you're into the realm of a sixth sense
[27:22] and then over here I want to talk about
[27:26] the something about you never see Jesus
[27:28] I'm talking about the talking is how he
[27:33] was surrounded by our loving the
[27:35] surrounded by you never hear him talking
[27:38] that I can't do that that's too
[27:40] difficult
[27:40] I'm too tired and what happened you near
[27:44] you you remember here talking about
[27:46] he was always his words were always the
[27:49] father's work
[27:52] so we're believe the baggage over here
[27:55] behind the top of this garbage and bring
[27:57] it all right and bring a place up over
[28:01] here and we we begin to educate
[28:04] ourselves we were talking teen to
[28:14] language right they're talking the
[28:16] language of our team we're going to
[28:23] believe that you embrace that they're
[28:27] not not that you haven't but if you
[28:29] embrace what is presented to you and
[28:31] you're you know you will send this up he
[28:35] gets squeezed out he gets what is true
[28:40] as the moment a mental asylum is already
[28:43] constantly do not see because we're
[28:49] human you will experience him more
[28:56] precious his integrity
[29:13] mentioning something that in comparison
[29:17] the indescribable the unleavened bread
[29:31] and in the one who produces it produces
