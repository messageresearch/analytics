the season that we're living in the hour that we're living in I feel very specially blessed this morning to be in the presence of the Lord I I've been having a wonderful time studying and preparing for this today and the Lord you know is his grace that's all I can say is just his grace his grace just keeps coming over and over and over again and there's nothing that we did to deserve this kind of Grace and love towards us that he would allow us to recognize him his word the season that we're living in what he is expecting what he is doing Saints we're blessed amen amen praise God um just want to let you know we're going to be having some special meetings on September the 1st to the 3rd you will receive a notification on that we have brother kidri Diggs that will be coming in to minister on the Friday the Saturday and the Sunday however on the Friday and the Saturday it's going to be very much geared towards our youth they will be here at the church we'll be having a wonderful time of fellowship and activities for the young people we're getting back into the Youth Camp you know after a few years of covid kind of shutting down all those opportunities for us but now that uh you know things are really starting to come back to some sort of a normal all right the world will never be the same as it was before covid of course but at least nothing has changed in the program of God amen amen and God is going to continue to meet the needs of his people regardless and so we look forward to those special meetings you will receive information on that by email there'll be a flyer going out I believe sometime this week praise God amen praise God let's go to the word of God today um we're going to be reading from The Book of Joshua verse or chapter 1 verses 1 to 8 a very familiar scripture we're going to be talking today on the title is because thou has chosen and you can you know there's going to be a compound meaning behind that title because God has chosen you and God knew that you would choose him and so there's there's a wonderful Union that takes place when we come into that realization that the day star has shined upon us and that now we are coming into manifestation by the grace of God Amen praise God let us pray before we go to the word of God father we are so thankful this morning Lord we're so privileged and honored Lord to be able to open your word amongst a people that are expecting to hear from you expecting to be blessed Lord we don't assemble by tradition on a weekly basis Lord we come Lord because we meet with the Living God we know that your presence is real it's what brought us here it's what keeps us coming back lord it's a reality that has struck our soul that no one can take away from us we're here because we want to be here we're here because we know that your spirit will speak to us and meet our needs and Lord if there's hearts that are broken they can be mended this morning if there's eyes that are shut they can be open this morning Lord if there's death in the midst of God there's a resurrection power in our midst that can change it all Lord if there's healing required receive it in the name of Jesus Christ because he's here to give it freely he is the Lord God that healeth all of our dis-ease and if you're in any kind of disease this morning wherever you may be receive it in the name of Jesus Christ for his glory and for your honor Lord we commit this service speak to us Lord let the seeds of Life find a resting place let it bring and forth life in each and every heart Lord and may we go out from this place with the strength and the courage to meet the challenges that lay before us granted we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen praise God forevermore Hallelujah Joshua 1 verses 1 to 8 says now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of none Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now we need to understand that we need to know that God sent us a Moses but that Moses that God sent us William Mary and Branham he is no longer with us he is no longer here on Earth we are under a different commission just like God said Moses is dead now therefore arise he said you need to rise up and recognize who you are you need to recognize your part you need to recognize that that there's things that I'm going to promise to you and if you can accept those promises and believe those promises then you can be victorious amen listen what he says now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel listen what he says every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land the Hittites and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall listen there shall not any man be able able to stand before thee all the days of thy life Hallelujah he's still the same God and as I was with Moses as I was with William Branham as I was in this land here in the 20th century moving and revealing and making myself known he says so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee but listen he says be strong Hallelujah he says be of good courage For unto this people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou and only be thou strong and very courageous he's he he says be courageous then he says be very courageous oh my very For unto this people shall thou divide only be thou very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper Hallelujah what's withersoever thou goeth this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night and thou that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success amen the Lord add His blessings to the word of God glory to God you may be seated amen bless the name of the Lord you know um we need to also read a scripture here from Revelations chapter 3 verses 21 to 22. to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now we need to realize here that you know we we receive very clear instruction that we were to be courageous to be strong to recognize that the Lord God was with us that if we would not turn to the left or turn to the right or look to anything else that the Lord would provide for us you know brother Branham was here on this Earth and he he had the ministry of Malachi 4 5. he had the ministry of Revelations 10 7. he had the ministry to come and to deliver the word of God he he was the anointed word in his day he was the manifestation of God in his day but let me tell you it was not easy for him he had to meet challenges that you and I would would couldn't even imagine having to deal with death of his loved ones his child his wife all the things that he had to go through but yet there was something in him something was placed in him from before the foundations of the world and I say to you this morning there's something in you as a son or a daughter of God I don't care how old you are I don't care how young you are this has got nothing to do with your age this has nothing to do with your ability this has nothing to do with your upbringing oh all your all your generational upbringing and all your atmospheres that you grew up under it has nothing to do with that this has to do with one thing God's election God's purpose God's desire to express himself in the form of attributes God wanted to express listen to Listen to The Prophet here he says here in the in the ministry um identification in the beginning was God he wasn't even God then God is just an object of worship he wasn't even God then no God is an object of worship only thing he was was the Eternal and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts simplify this we want to keep this really simple today we're not bringing some mysterious message here today that's going to leave you thinking and wondering no no you're going to recognize when you listen to this message today I want you to just sit back and relax let the Holy Spirit fellowship with us here today that's what I was doing I was having fellowship with the Holy Ghost as I was going through all of this and it was wonderful he was just unveiling such simple truths but it brought such confidence such a encouragement through the word of God and and it's available to you this morning so relax just relax enjoy this atmosphere because we've got him with us here this morning and he says and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts was expressed to words and word was made manifest so what is it it's all God becoming tangible you are a part of God and Jesus come to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundations of the world you need to realize that there's a book of life everything started not when you were born here and it didn't even start back in the Book of Genesis when Adam was manifested into the Earth and made into the image of God it all started before all of that God had a plan all before that you know people talk about you know the world is millions of years old it it sure it is there's no beginning and no end with God God could have started programs and had generations and worlds before this one but we're concerned about this one is this the one that you're in this the one that you were born into this is your time this is your season to manifest what it is that you are who you are this is that's why you need to be concerned about that don't get caught up into Evolution that's not going to do you any good Hallelujah you need to know who you are you need to recognize that that you have a part to play in this time this generation this part of his story his story his story is being made right now in your life because of your part in the word of God and he says here he came to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the founding it was in God's thoughts and that's what he come to redeem and them as soon as it strikes to them they see it because the life is in there you're not going to know why it is that this just makes sense to you I cannot explain revelation Revelation is something that you can never explain you cannot give it to somebody all you can do is put a definition on it and the closest definition that I can give according to the way that I see it is that God's thoughts become real in my thoughts and they manifest in the way of divine revelation in my heart I can't explain it but I believe it that's why Jesus said I'll build my church that way so you young people you're wondering how it is that you're gonna you're you're gonna overcome how it is that you're gonna deal with this life and and the situations that you're facing right now as a young person I'm going to tell you something God is going to do it the Lord is going to give you Revelation and at that moment in that time and that season when it's time for you to receive it you're going to receive it and you're just gonna know it you're gonna know who you are you're going to understand why all the things that have been happening in your life are happening Hallelujah but if the light now he says because the life is in there now watch this is what he says but if the life is INT in there is not in there hey we're living in a world there's a lot other church services going on right now this morning all over the world there's people that are believing God all over the world but there's something that we need to understand this is what separates us and and and and gives us the difference we know the attributes of God are being expressed in this time and season we realize that God is his own interpreter God opens the understanding not man I could never open your understanding no Minister could ever open your understanding God opens your understanding by divine revelation and the reason you can say Amen is because there's a representation there from before the foundations of the world halleluia glory to God but if it isn't there then what can they do see they don't see it they never see it see but listen and the whole and the whole thing as Jesus said at that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father in me and I in you and you in me the whole thing is God becoming material like a husband and a wife becoming one together God and his church becoming one Alleluia praise our God forevermore but brother Branham went through a tough time he had to make choices I'm going to read you a quote and this is where the thought came from and there's no way that we're going to be able to get through this this is going to be a couple of parts for sure okay but this is the the the thought that became strong in my heart and when I read this quote when brother Branham you know gave the testimony of the of the the the three individuals that spoke in tongues and the interpretation of it this is what it read on the wings of a snow white dove 1965. he says and this three people three French people a French woman big heavyset woman dark complected from Louisiana she may be sitting here tonight wrote it down on a piece of paper what he said then Victor Ledoux a minister wrote down the same thing and they were comparing notes or going to a lightheaded man kind of a blonde hair standing way back packed back as far as he could come walking up wanted to see those notes he was The Interpreter of French at the U.N and all three notes was the same it was God sending a message it was God sending something to his Prophet to encourage him amen praise God and and he said and all three notes was the same and it said this because thou has chosen this harder way you've chosen you've chose it you have took chose it by your own choosing course we know that Moses had to make his choice said this is the precise and correct way because it is my way my God thank you Jesus glory to God once you understand God's way his way you're you're you're going to be set free Saints you're going to be set free and what and what a what a glorious listen what he says what a glorious decision you've made said because of this a large portion of Heaven awaits you and this in itself is that which will make and bring to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine I believe there's going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet sweet by and by oh it'll bring such a glorious Liberty to the sons of God it'll be such a love divine Saints we will be in Heavenly places we will get caught up in the moment in the twinkling of an eye because God said so because God said that he promised that it would be so that because because thou has chosen Alleluia glory to God Amen blessed be the name of the Lord so here now we're going to look at partnering with God you know God chose you you chose him you know in the world I'm a businessman I chose my partners and they chose to be with me there's a there's a there's a a connection where both sides have to agree the moment god listen you think God's going to choose you and you're going to turn around and reject him God chose you by election he knew that you would accept he knew that there was an attribute in you not because I'll choose this one and I won't choose that one no no he placed you here on free moral agency you are a free human being in here this morning when you're hearing this message this morning you've got the choice to accept it or reject it you'll either leave better or you're going to leave in a battle it's as simple as that because this is the hour where God is calling God is placing God is anointing God is manifesting God is interpreting his word we don't need to try to interpret his word he's going to do it all by himself we can relax we can sit back and let the Holy Spirit have his way amen praise God but it's going to take us to have that that connection where we agree where we say Amen where we say yes Lord hallelujah glory to God you know in Daniel 11 32 it says in the King James version it says the people who know their God shall be strong and shall carry out great exploits you can expect Supernatural things to happen in your life you can expect Deliverance you can expect Financial blessings you can expect to overcome whatever situation you may have to face because the word of God says that you will be strong because you know your God you've come into a relationship with him you realize that that he is the one and only true God and he says you're going to do great exploits brother Hallelujah glory to God you're going to do things that you never thought was possible because he's going to do it but you know what you're partnering with the right God Hallelujah you're partnering with the only one and true Living God brother glory to God Amen praise God listen to what partnership with God can do know a partnership with God and he saved his family from the flood and preserved the human race because he recognized the voice of God he accepted the call upon his life amen Abraham partnered with God and also made a global impact his faith secured the promised land Hallelujah for the for the Hebrew people and brought spiritual blessings to the Nations Jacob's partnership brought him tremendous wealth oh yeah oh yeah I watch who I partner with I watch who my suppliers are I watch who I do business with because the goal is for everybody to prosper you see a partnership where only one side prospers will never last I promise you that God doesn't have those kind of Partnerships brother let me tell you if you take him and he he takes you and you partner together with God you can expect great exploits you can expect great blessings you can expect things to happen around your life your family I don't care what the condition is right now do not look at the circumstances God is bringing us a fresh revelation on the word of God here this morning by the word because we are moving on we are pressing into the kingdom of God we're not going to stay the same we're not going to stay in a defeated condition no sir we are going to move forward we're going to trust God he's given us Revelation to overcome because he says partner with me join me give yourself choose whom You Shall Serve this day he said he promised I'll give you the possessions I'll I'll give you everywhere your foot Treads but you need to know that you need to make a certain Choice amen hallelujah Moses experienced the burning bush Pillar of Fire fellowship with God and in so doing he liberated two million people Hallelujah by you think it was Moses that sent those plagues do you think it was Moses that went in there and had the strength to stand before Pharaoh's Army and say Let My People Go sure it was Moses people as a nation but it was God's people first and you need to know that God's people your children I don't care who it is they were God's first before they were yours [Applause] Hallelujah glory to God Amen blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah now wouldn't you like to live this way wouldn't you like to know that you're partnered with God and when situations come up in your life that it's going to take all like you might be facing situations right now and you know there's just no matter where you look Left Right Center you can't find a solution Joshua had all kinds of situations like that but God was with Joshua you see that's the kind of Revelation you need to have you need to know that you're with the Living God and he's with you he desires to partnership with you and can you imagine what can happen now I'm telling you things will happen I've experienced it Saints I've seen things happen in my life I could sit here and give you testimony after testimony after testimony of the things that God did that I cannot mentally physically explain he did it that's all I can tell you he did it and I know there's a lot of people in here that can say the same thing because we serve a supernatural God that's why after 30 years some of you 35 years some of you whatever time you're here because you know you've come into contact with the Living God Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah God does nothing listen God chose you why because God can't do it any other way God has attributes but he placed those attributes in man listen to brother Brown I'm here at the identified Christ of all ages 1964. he says so therefore he could tell the end from the beginning and in each age he lauded so much of his word Hallelujah in each age and then usually man gets it so twisted up and the world gets in such a shape until he has to send some man anointed all ages has been the same he identifies himself upon the Earth in man [Music] in man so don't be looking anywhere else you know sometimes you can get so spiritually minded that you're no earthly good your pastor and those ministers that stand here are ministering instruction by the by the anointing and by the by by the supernatural inspiration of the Holy Ghost and if you can accept it and say amen I receive that it becomes a part of you and sometimes we we just don't you know we look at man you might look at brother Danny you might see some of my flaws I got lots of them okay and I see a lot of yours we all got them but before we were flawed humans we were Sons and Daughters of the Living God and I'm looking at that I'm not looking at you anymore I'm not looking at your flaws I'm not interested in your flaws I'm interested in God's program God wants to take this church he wants to change this this body ain't going in the rapture so don't get used to looking at this ugly body this bald head over here okay when you see me on the other side you're going to see something completely different when I see you on the other side you're going to be something that eyes have not seen ears have not heard neither has it even entered into the heart of man what God has in store oh my goodness glory to God I'm not going to see that that old you know weary body I'm not going to feel the old weary Pains of this body anymore we're going to be changed in a moment glory to God Amen he says God does nothing without man the Bible said so you you know see he always takes man because it was man he had to use and let the man put him on free moral agency here it is he put us on free moral agency God is not you know creating clones God isn't programming you a certain way and programming him another way and programming her in a certain way no no God puts you on free moral agency Hallelujah and knowing that he would fall oh my goodness how many times did you fall this week how many fell this week oh yeah oh yeah you're gonna fall you're gonna you're gonna make mistakes you're gonna do all those things but guess what he's not looking at that hallelujah it's it he said that he knew that you would fall in order to display his attributes as a savior how can he be a savior if there's nothing to save how can he be a Healer if you don't get that backache and you lay hands you say honey can you please lay your hands on my back I've done it many times I said lay hands on me and I walk out of the room and I forget about it because I believe the word I got things I got to do I can't stand I can't be held back because Satan wants to throw something on me wants to mess up my back wants to mess up this mess up that God has a an antidote for that you believe that you either Believe it or you don't believe it if you believe it I don't care what the sickness is I don't care what where the healing is required you just accept it because you got you got work to do you got a part in God's word you got a part in the economy of God nothing can keep you down because God's got a job for you to do hallelujah praise God he says in order to display his attributes as a savior for there was nothing lost and therefore therefore he chose man he could have chosen the Stars he could have chosen the trees but he chose man he chose you and he chose me Hallelujah because he's got a work to do and so you know we look into this we realize God has chosen us but we need to look deeper into it I you know when I started to look deeper into this I was getting so encouraged because God you know like when he wants to reveal how he chose you and why he chose you and how and how that his choosing there was no not even an inkling of a mistake there Hallelujah in Romans 9 listen I want you to recognize here in Romans 9 11 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth he's calling you this morning Saints he's calling you to a walk with him that overrides where you've been overrides the circumstances that have held you overrides any change of circumstance they're going to get broken here this morning because we're moving on Hallelujah you're not going to stay the same this is God's choosing amen hallelujah you know when when like you when we look at this scripture here we know that it's talking about uh Jacob and Esau you know Jacob and Esau when you think about that whole story and how it took place and everything that that happened you you can't help but see the the power of God first of all you need to recognize God said before while they were in the womb Rebecca was wondering why are these two fighting in my womb why why is there a battle going on and when the Lord said one I love the other one I hate can you imagine before they were even born God knew it God knew that they would be what they were going to be and God knew that Jacob regardless of his condition regardless of the way he was Hallelujah here let me read a few things here glory to God now listen uh here I'm just going to read this because it's just information that I that I got when Rebecca felt that prenatal disturbance she asked God what was happening she she told she God told her that there was two Nations struggling inside of her you know you're going to have struggles you can even have struggles with your brothers and sisters you're gonna have struggles you're gonna you're gonna deal with situations right in your own family your own children your brothers and your sisters your mama your papa your your boss at work there's going to be struggles constantly in your life but I want you to see something this there's something that goes beyond that there's something that overrides it it sets it into the sea of God's forgetfulness it'll have no power anymore over you but there was two Nations struggling inside of her and the younger would rule over the older God foreknowledge observed Esau's uh you know uh disdain for his Birthright and predetermined it for Jacob the man of faith Hallelujah God knew that Esau was gonna was gonna sell out God knows if you're going to sell out did you know that because you're here on free moral agency you might be going through a battle and you know if you're a human like me yeah those thoughts have come give up leave this They Don't Love You nobody loves you I might as well just be with strangers when I'm around my family I feel strange I feel I feel alienated all those thoughts that's Satan lying to you that's Satan lying to you and telling you that because Satan wants to pull you aside like a lamb when when when a lamb gets off on its own somewhere those wolves are watching they're waiting so that they can pounce and and take a hold of that lamb because it's gone off it's alienated itself don't you do that you stay under the protection of the spirit of God God has placed you into this ministry I I say it all the time you know the people that are having problems and I say where's your absolute where do you feed on your absolute where do you get strength from some people it's in it's in positive mental attitude it's in you know in in Reading you know motivational books things like that that's all fine but for you as an attribute and a son of God there's only one thing that's going to satisfy you that's the word of God because it's the word that God said would overcome it's the word that's going to prevail and if the word is in you you Prevail it's as simple as that and amen so so here now when Esau maturity became an outdoor he became a hunter and one day he returns home he's all famished he you know he's been hunting all day and he's hungry you know sometimes we just give up you know so easy because you know we get faced with a little bit of a trial and I don't want this trial I'm not going to go to church I don't want to go to church this person didn't say hi to me last week this person looked at me the wrong way I'm not going to church they don't like me the pastor when he was preaching he was talking all about me that's good if the spirit of God is interested in you that's good and if it's correction that's good if God wants to deliver you from certain things that's good because God has a purpose in calling you Hallelujah and you know and so no doubt God had orchestrated Esau's vain attempts just to test his character God was take God was was going to show what was really an Esau you know God's going to test you and see and you're going to see what's really in you you're going to get tested sometimes to see what's really there are you really going to stand are you going to really stand are you going to put aside everybody's opinions and everybody's thoughts and Satan's thoughts about you and be still and know that he's God You Don't Have To Fear not if you believe God hallelujah but here now Jacob he was smart he wanted that Birthright he would do anything to get that birth right he was a conniver God is just showing the characters God is showing the human side of us as human beings that we can be flawed we can make mistakes we can do things that we don't want to do that we can we can be connivers at times too that because Satan will try and do anything to get you to to just get off the word and and to separate yourself from God but here now he he Esau comes in he smells that food and he was starving and and and Jacob says you want some of this he says give me your Birthright and Esau turns around and showed his real character when he says what good is this is a Birthright when I'm gonna die from starvation how many people do you know die if they don't eat for one day not many you don't die from missing a meal one day but he sold out for a meal what's in you how quickly are you bruised and right away you just give up God's not looking for that God wants you to know I'll be with you I'll be in you I chose you Hallelujah glory to God it showed his true colors Satan attempted him pushed him but Jacob showed his true colors Jacob wasn't willing to give up he went and fought with the angel of the Lord he says I don't care what it's going to take I know I make mistakes I know I fall but I'm getting back up again that's the kind of attitude God is looking in his sons and daughters he's not looking at a giver rapper you should not be a giver upper because God is with you you're going to be we're going to be looking at things here that that you're going to realize that God chose you amen hallelujah listen uh God's proof of his love and his election is in that he elected you do you think God would have chose you if he didn't love you do you think God doesn't love you and yet he elects you no no no they go they go hand in hand before you were lost in sin God loved you while you were a sinner he loved you whatever situation and condition you're in today he loves you he loves you he wants to bring you out of that situation he wants you to know that if if that love comes upon you and you'll know you'll know when God loves you you'll know when he expresses it upon you when he when he fills you with his Spirit when he anoints you when he does things around you not emotion I'm not talking about emotion here we're not looking for emotion here we're looking for a reality in the word of God that when that word strikes your soul you change your character changes your attitude Changes Everything About You changes all of a sudden you're looking to please God you're looking to please though you know fulfill the word of God because it's become a reality to you Hallelujah the election of God is now being manifested and the proof is in who he is calling he's calling you if you're hearing his voice this morning and he's calling you it's because you're elected it's because you were there from before the foundations of the world that's the proof of his election Hallelujah glory to God he's calling and he's calling because he needs to manifest and interpret his word for this hour he's finished with Malachi 4 5. he's finished with Revelations 10. the mighty Angel has come down and now he the great Joshua commission is calling your name calling you to your position giving you the strength the anointing the word that you need to overcome whatever it is that you're dealing with right now Hallelujah he wants to manifest his word and look at Romans 8 35 I want to read that to you I want you to understand this kind of love that God has for you that goes beyond your weaknesses goes beyond the things that you thought that you were not capable of Hallelujah praise God listen here in Romans 8 35 thank you brother he says who shall separate us from the love of Christ I want you to listen carefully here these are simple scriptures we've read them all the time but put it in the context of what we're saying here today shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword you got listen there's there's situations in your life right now they're in mind too let's you know let's let's get in the same boat together here right Jesus is in the boat so let's get all into the same boat Hallelujah because he's going to call the winds he's going to calm the storms whatever it is that you have need of amen he says for as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sleep as sheep for the slaughter we are under many trials many persecutions many circumstances and situations like sheep to the slaughter but it does not separate us from the love of God it does not nay all these things we are more in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us Hallelujah for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities I don't care how many demon powers and principalities and dominions come down upon our situations Upon Our lives our circumstances our homes our finance our health and our wealth whatever it is I don't care nor powers nor things present nor things to come so God knows even what's coming into your life and he's made a way for you he's made a way for you praise God he's opened the door for you God bless you brother Tim good to see you brother hallelujah amen God is already nor height nor depth nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord and as long as you're in Christ then you are loved you are loved beyond what you could possibly imagine and we don't serve God because he loved us we served we serve him because he loved us and we love him because God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son you can go and tell somebody God loves you and they could turn around and say no he doesn't and keep walking but if you turn around and say amen and fall in love and he anoints you with his word then you are going to love him beyond your own understanding you're going to experience a love that goes beyond even the love that you have for your brothers your sisters your wife your husband your children this is a love that goes beyond all of that we call it love we give it a word and we we spell it l-o-v-e but it's it's God's understanding of his fellowship with himself with his attributes with you and me as attributes of God there's no there's no um you know definition of God's love he just expresses it and it manifests in our lives I know if you're in love with the Lord I can tell if you're really in love with the Lord You're not miserable all the time there's something there that expresses itself in the love of God that it shows it it can't it can't help it Hallelujah glory to God we serve we serve God because he loved us and we love him sincerely we have a sincerity to serve God not out of fear you know legalism is the opposite of Love Did you know that if you serve God because of legalism it's because you're serving because you're expecting something in return You're Expecting so the end you could be doing it because of fear you know legal if I don't do this I'm done if I don't pay my tithes I'm gonna go broke that's possible but that's not always true because there's a lot of people that don't pay tithes that are very wealthy okay so it's got nothing to do with paying tithes but let me tell you that when it is by a revelation and you pay your tithes by revelation then it places you into the supernatural body of Jesus Christ it places you under the word of God that he said that my word shall not return unto me void it places you into a into a a relationship with God that where your tithing doesn't become just money sent by e-transfer it's an investment into the kingdom of God and there's a there's a deep call to the deep as a result of that tithe being given there's an understanding behind it that becomes Supernatural and then all of a sudden Supernatural things start to happen around your life and all of a sudden your financial needs just suddenly something changed a job arises a a blessing comes there's an inheritance over here there's listen don't don't put an interpretation on how God will bless you for paying your tithes or giving your offerings do not in don't put an interpretation on that don't try to do it because then you limit God I'm telling you that God can drop a hundred million dollars anywhere he wants whenever he wants and he can also take it away any time he wants whenever he wants Hallelujah so don't be looking at that don't be looking at you know that it's got to be this if I give that oh well if I give it you know the Lord said I'll pour out a hundredfold so if I give ten dollars then I should be getting ten thousand I didn't get it last month I'm not paying my tithes God's word's not true no no no no you see that is so carnal it's just as carnal as somebody that doesn't want to pay it you might as well not pay it you might as well not bless the kingdom of God because you are not by Revelation Living the Life of Christ that's in you glory to God Amen we don't want to do things by legalism it's the opposite of love it's serving because we expect something back or because we're in fear that we're going to get it that we're not going to get it God's love is unconditional God loved you before you were even a human before you were even expressed on this Earth God loved you because he had a plan from before the foundations of the world he's bringing you into that plan that's the Glorious Victory brother Philip this is the thing that sets us and liberates us from the bondage of this world this this it's chaos out there this world is falling apart there's you know yesterday it was Canada Day happy Canada Day listen I was very grateful for Canada I'm just going to tell you the way it is I was sitting with some people yesterday and we were talking about it and these are people that you know that have lived in in this country they're in their 80s 90s and they were saying good country Canada has been good to us they came from the old they came from Europe from Italy Portugal different places they were saying this country is a good country we've been we've been blessed in this country we've done well in this country our families have grown in this country and I was saying you know you're right I said look we don't have any wars we don't have any wars we don't have any situations where like I know there's countries right now that are completely in total chaos people don't even know where their next meal is going to come from but here we are in the land of milk and honey God has blessed us by placing Us in Canada and we need to be grateful for that Hallelujah it doesn't change the fact that the world is going into chaos that's just prophecy that's all part of the word of God we cannot change that amen praise God but God's love is unconditional legal is liberalism that's another thing you can be you see you got to find the balance in life you can be told in legalism or you can be total liberalism and if you're either side they're both wrong and they're both against God it's not going to give you what you what you really need and who you really are and allow the Holy Spirit to express himself through you because if you think I can do anything I want I'm totally free I'm liberated I'm a son or daughter of God I can do anything I want I can no that's not you gotta come subject to the word of God you've got to let the Holy Spirit deal with your life you got to let the holy spirit guide you and direct you Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God they're not led by other Spirits they're not led by dominating Spirits they're not led by a dominating husband or a dominating wife they're led by the spirit of God there's a difference you see it's not liberalism Pure Love is pure both ways my wife serves me because she loves me I know she sincerely loves me and she knows that I sincerely love her I know that she sees the mistakes in my life she knows that I see the mistakes in her life we all have the flaws but the spirit of God has given us revelation of who we really are who we really are and we need to we need to be respectful to the Sons and Daughters of God we need to respect their position we need to respect their callings we need to respect where God is placing them according to his plan and his purpose because that's God's plan halleluia we show love with a motive for something else that's not pure love if I go to my wife and I say oh honey you know praise God you know you this meal was absolutely incredible the house looks so amazing my God you're so busy everything looks so wonderful man you've been so busy today you just you've done such a beautiful job keeping the house and you know I just love and appreciate you you know and the guys are going golfing next Friday would it be okay if I go you see where's the motive he immediately knows that whatever I said there was a motive behind it because I want to go golfing that's not the way it works with God God doesn't want that kind of motive God doesn't want that kind of attitude that he doesn't want that kind of a relationship he wants that pure relationship between you and him he wants you to be right he just wants you to be straight up with him he wants you to be straight honest when you're down and out be down and out when you need to confess confess when you made when when Whatever It Is God wants to bless you he's letting you know that those things do not change how he feels about you they do not change his love for you he still loves you he still do everything that he can for you the true revelation of this hour to you personally takes you away from insecurity when you have a revelation you you come out of that insecurity you come out of that thing where where you're fearful the Revelation when it calls you into this glorious relationship and partnership with God it should break the insecurity if I get into partnership with somebody that I know is capable I've seen it they've proved it over and over and over again that they can do what they said they can do I lose the insecurity of investing my money I now invest it with with a with a surety with a security with a a confidence to know that I've partnered with the right person well you can have that kind of security with God if God has called you all your insecurities should just vanish you should be confident to know that God is going to do what he said he's going to do it'll take away all insecurity about your salvation we are free in Christ no fear not not fearful but secure in Christ all the doubts have been dissolved listen I'm going to read Romans chapter 4 here Hallelujah praise God let me take a little drink here quickly we're going to wind down shoot soon Romans 4 verse 4. listen here now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt you see we don't want to have this kind of attitude that that if we do something then we get there's a law which is called the law of sowing and reaping you cannot change that it's it governs this whole world it's called The Law of sowing and reaping but when you are adopted as a son or a daughter of God into the body of Jesus Christ and you become partnered with the Holy Spirit in your life this is what happens but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as David also described the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works Hallelujah there's nothing that you can do except say Amen to the word of God there's nothing that you can do to deserve God's blessing salvation protection blessings anointings everything that comes with being in the body of Christ you can't there's nothing that you can do you just need to accept it and re and receive it God imputed righteousness without work saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered you know what iniquity is is when you do things and you know it's wrong and you can fall into those traps and you can do those things but let me tell you God has made a way for you God has made a way for you God is God has made a way for you that from today on from right now [Applause] it can be placed into the sea of God's forgetfulness and you can start a new life a new walk with God and you can change all the circumstances that are that are holding you back and keeping you in a in a defeated condition and under condemnation there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ you're not to fall under condemnation and you're not and you're not to let anybody put you under condemnation Hallelujah your opinion of me does not change God's opinion of me I don't care what you think about me or what you expect or or or or how you see me or uh you know or or how I see you it's it's irrelevant God sees me a certain way God believes and and knows exactly what I'm to fulfill in the word of God and you can't stop it and I can't stop it we need to accept God the way that he sees us not the way that others see us oh they're looking at our children and they see our children are in the world and they're not serving the lord yeah do they not need the birth just like you need the birth we don't want children that we're going to conform to the message we're going to dress them up make them look like they're message Believers and yet they don't believe anything they can't wait to get out you put them into a state of rebellion instead of putting them into an atmosphere of love to know that God's love wants it it's expresses on them it'll change them let God do the work let God not conform them but transform them that's what God did for us look at your walk look at yours where you came from God he transformed you you're not the same person that you were and you know it [Music] Hallelujah glory to God Amen thank you Lord blessed are those are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin glory to God hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name the message of the hour should bring us into a greater relationship with God and one another you know this is all part of the Rapture and Faith series that I've been ministering on until we can properly unite and love one another and come into a greater relationship with one another the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ is bringing a unified revelation of the rapture it's it's not a different Revelation for you as it is for him as it is for him or her it is not a different Revelation it's the same Revelation and God is going to give you the same Revelation that he's given the other person if they're in the Rapture and therefore they cannot fight they can disagree on the things of this world I give every right listen I tell people all the time you have an opinion I respect your opinion amen I need you to respect my opinion okay your opinion is your opinion but when it comes to the word of God when two sons of God come together if one of them denies that word there's no True Fellowship there could be a could be a Jacob and Esau situation okay call it what you want but when they see the word and they can say Amen to that word and they're unified by the revelation of that word and it's as clear as a bell there's a supernatural that's going to wash away all the all the the the the the the the the the the the the funny things that that are all those funny spirits that that hinder your relationship as a human being because you know you're in this world you're you're going to be like strange sometimes you got certain quirks about you you know you got certain ways about you that's normal that's fine everybody's got certain quirks certain ways attitudes towards certain things but when it comes to the word of God it's like amen Hallelujah brother praise God that's nothing but the truth glory to God that Revelation is as clear as clear can be and there's no way that you can deny the word of God Amen praise God forevermore it brings us into a greater relationship with one another and we need to deal with all things through a security relationship so if you've got a good solid relationship with God and you're going to come to your deacon and you've got a good relationship with God and you're trusting in that office as a deacon or your pastor or your trustee or whatever and you're and you're coming in with the with with a relationship that's secure in Christ then I'm telling you there's going to be Supernatural benefits and answers and and and uh solutions to whatever it is that you're dealing with God is going to give you the right solution because you're entering into it from a perspective of being secure about God and who you are if you're insecure as a boss and you're insecure and you're telling your employees do it this way and then the next minute no wait wait a minute do it that way no hang on no no maybe we should do it no you don't know what you're doing you're gonna you're gonna train people that are going to be like uh you know chickens with their heads cut off they're going to be going in every direction not knowing what they're doing but when you come into a relationship from a perspective of security in Christ knowing where you stand knowing you're standing on the rock then God will do the rest God will give you the wisdom that you need God will give you the the the instruction that you need from your pastor from your Deacon from your brother your sister Hallelujah showing the the grace of God for one another amen hallelujah my position my character my ideas those are human things we need to understand their our human elements but we're not to impress them on other people and say no that's the way it is that's not the way it is you're not always right I'm going to tell you right now I'm not always right and you're not always right you're going to be wrong and when you're wrong you need to admit it you need to accept it you need to you need to allow the spirit of God because the minute you release that thing you're free you become free now and God can move you to the next step saying that's the kind of character I'm looking for that's the kind of character that I'm thinking about the message of this hour should take away all the fear of this dimension we're coming into maturity now we're coming into a place where we where we know who we are we we we're strong in the Lord we should not have fear of of what this world can do to us we have confidence in the Lord it brings you back into your genuine position as an attribute of God when you place yourself right there where God wants you you become a genuine part there's nothing like a genuine part when you replace it in a vehicle Hallelujah our children need to have the same transformation as we did and let me just read as we close here now I'm going to read Colossians yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna end it here Colossians 1. let the musicians come from verse 19 for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself he paid the price for whatever it is that's holding you back from giving yourself completely over to God you say oh but I did this or oh but I'm carrying that or oh but this situation no no listen what it says here and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things everything's coming back exactly to the original genuine attribute that you are it's going to surface in your life and when it fully fully manifests you're going to be changed in a moment you are sealed until the day of your Redemption but on the day that you are redeemed the seal comes off Hallelujah the seal comes off because then you are what you always were glory to God Amen but he says here he says reconcile all things by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your own mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled he has brought you out of that situation I don't care what your mind has been that battle that goes on between your your you know the the the good and the and that good Angel and that that evil angel that that bottled you and tells you every day that you're this you're that no no no he's he's he's taken that and he's taken that enemy and he's wiped it out he's reconciled you in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight if ye continue like now watch if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof I Paul am a minister of this word you believe the word that was ministered to you this morning if you believe it you you you you you are changed you cannot go back to the way you were you will you will leave this place different you will you will face
