before you all um many of you witnessed on uh Late July their Sunday service beautiful message was preached by brother Tim and uh message ended my memory completely blanks out um and lots of many many things um happened and it turned out that I suffered a stroke that Sunday um when I got to the hospital my ability to speak walk was diminished I uh I needed help to do simple things um but one thing both brother Dany and brother Tim who were speaking to me during that period they said to me don't lose Faith um I was backsliding for many many many years and this ministry this church is where I found my way back to the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah and as soon as I started coming back to church and giving my life back to the Lord the enemy started fighting me fighting me fighting me fighting me fighting me in my home and finally the stroke but but the Tim said Sheila have faith sister Sheila have faith a battle will come but the sun will break through the storm and I continued to hold on I was scared but I continued to hold on finally my uh ability to walk came back and uh I was talking normally again and the doctors were like we've never seen somebody recover from a stroke so quickly um and uh turns out during the stroke I also suffered uh seizure and uh two Sundays ago on the 17th I texted brother Danny I said I'm and brother Tim I said I'm going to be at church this I believe I was trying to call brother Danny that Sunday to let him know that I was going to be at church I texted brother Tim I I'm going to be at church I was cleared to drive got into the car everything was perfect got into the car the last minut memory I have was getting on the qw I was coming from Hamilton and I merged onto the qw and it goes black and the next time I came back I was safely parked remarkably on Tesla Drive approximately about 1 and a half to 2 kilm away from the highway and my 7-year-old son said Mommy I just remember we were bouncing up and down bouncing up and down and I thought so my husband retraced where um we were so the merge onto the qw my husband says to me if we had swerved to the left we would have been hit by oncoming traffic if we had continued going forward we would have hit the um Burlington Skyway and God knows what would have happened but we swerved to the right an exited on um a Tesla drive and what had happened was the wheel of the car the the right wheel of the car had turned completely and was scraping along the shoulder which was creating a resistance to slow down the car and it was just and that was the bouncing Sensation that my son whed with the wheel cuz my foot was still on the accelerator though I was seizing and my foot was still on the accelerator at 100 kilomet plus an hour but that wheel worked as a resistance to slow the car down I believe the angel of the Lord came down and was driving the vehicle many people are big big big time prayer people but the only thing I know that God has given me is my voice so I'm going leave you all with this this is a song that's been with me throughout this from Late July till now he saw me in in his likess he saw me just like him Pure Clean and holy spotless [Music]

they're here and they are just uh overwhelmed and praising God for the time they had at Valance uh Conservation Area and with that I'd like to announce that the Oakville Italian Invitational golf tournament has granted to them a donation of $10,000 that will be a blessing to our youth program shall we say praise the Lord let's give to brother mik praise the Lord isn't that wonderful you believe God still works miracles you believe that still Mana comes down from heaven we didn't ask for that uh we didn't give make any uh appeal for that but just through the life of our brother being amongst them that came down as show bread uh and we thank God that I'm able to show it up here to you that uh he has provided amen and he look that's for the church that's for the youth program but that's just a display that is telling you I am able to meet your for every need than your need may not be as much as that but if I can do that and that's nothing in the first place to him uh what can't God do for you only believe all things are possible to them that will believe the word of God hallelujah amen may the Lord richly bless us all this morning as We Gather in his pray presence praise the Lord uh uh first of all let me uh brother I think it's better for you to put up this scripture first we will repeat the scripture we had last week in Matthew uh we welcome back of course um all our Brethren brother Mike his family we're glad for have them in the house of God Amen now let's look to the word and look into I believe they have the scriptures in the back there already I have them typed here just getting myself organized okay let's all stand and read respects of the word of God and read from the word and Jesus answered and spake unto them Again by Parables and the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for his son and sent his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come and again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen my fatlings are killed and all things are ready amen all things are ready do you believe that come to the feast because all things are ready come unto the marriage but they made light of it see and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and entreated them spite F and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was wroth angry and sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burnt up their City then said he to his servants the wedding is ready but they that were bidden were not worthy go ye therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find bid to the marriage so these servants went into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests watch that now it was furnished with guests those people that were bidden were guests right and when the king came to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment and he said unto him friend how camest thou in tther not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot take him away cast him into out of Darkness there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen and I am one of the few I believe I'm one of the few I hope you believe that too praise the name of the Lord hallelujah uh let us just look to the Lord in prayer right now father we thank you for the reading of the word and as we go into the word Lord may your spirit go before us preparing the channels the way and opening up the uh Pathways of inspiration and may the spirit of God surge forth father bringing to us life forever more for we ask it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen praise the Lord God bless you please be seated now the first thing I'm going to do is bring you back up to uh uh speed let's say it that way uh so that we can uh progress and move forward uh we want to uh talk about this because in the last sermon we talked together about who are called and who are chosen who are these called and who are The Chosen uh it is a great blessing because even when I went to the youth Fellowship a young man who is not a member of this church church or anything else he said he just went online and thought he'd look up what was being preached and he heard that and he had to listen it again it's been a blessing to his heart and cause him to start really thinking and praying uh where am I positioned there am I just uh uh called or or chosen right so um this is the problem we have in a message so so many people claim that they are following the message and that they believe the message and we are not saying that they're not uh going to be saved but positionally um in the book of life and in the plan of God whether to be the bride whether to be a guard whether to be a servant whether to be whatever God has plans in his kingdom what position and what place are they going to be in because remember I I repeat we are not saying because they're not in the bride they're not going to be saved because the guests also had wedding garments but in this third or this other section this fellow had no wedding garment he had a false one an impersonated garment garment that he tried to put on but these others did have a wedding garment given to them by the bright room himself so they they're going to be saved but it's the classification are they in the bright class no which other class will they be in as I mentioned before guards servants whatever uh their place God has his own portion praise the Lord hallelujah now we discovered from this Parable that the king had a wedding for his for his son and sent out his servants to invite guests to come to this wedding um and of course groomsmen guests and bridegroom all were formally invited that doesn't make them the bride because they have an invitation because they have a desire because they even feel the pull because they also have an invitation so they'll feel the pull also but who is he going to reveal his secrets too that person doesn't have to have an invitation as we go on let me I'm getting ahead of myself praise the Lord but there's only one bride never mind if going beat 10 billion guests and she can have a whole train of bridesma and uh Brides uh groomsmen or whatever but there's only one bride can you say amen amen only one bride that's the way it is with God Amen so we understand that being called just means that you've been given an [Applause] invitation you see John 316 tells us whosoever will may come whosoever will may come but coming running to the altar going to a church it doesn't mean that you are in a bride you just felt and heard the call you see and this is where the prophets separated uh all these churches think because they have thousands millions of members running to the altar making confessions making sacrifices flagellations and uh different ways uh passing the flag over their head baptizing three times backwards three times forwards shaking the the Pope's hand or or the super superintendent's hand they all have their various means of how they tell you you're qualified to be saved and God's word said it plain to us how you must be born again and that is not by manmade standards efforts or guidelines that they give you not all the Bible teachings in the world can get your saved not all the theological addresses in the world can get you saved none of those things will save you right see now back here you should be understand that um is to receive the message is just to receive the invitation to receive the message is to receive the invitation the servant of God went out with a shout and declared to you to come in called out and brought in the multitude tudes good bad ugly whatever he didn't care what it was he threw out the net in the sea and and and just pulled in as many as he could because it's the invitation bringing you in Praise the Lord but he can't make you the bride Hallelujah he can't do it the bride was already bride from before the foundation of the world am so there's nothing that he could do now except to invite and call and when he call is a big crowd big congregation worldwide he doesn't even know some of them but one maybe bride one may not be bride one may be this one may be that but his business was to call back to the word back to the original Faith hallu back to what God gave in the world word hallelujah amen that's what he was doing praise the Lord amen so having the invitation coming to the message is just to receive the invitation and all you have there is an invitation to this wonderful message but it doesn't mean that you're one of the elect praise the Lord it just means that you were caught in the prophetic message net right and he made that plain several scriptures tells you there will be a time where you separate sheep from goost a time when he will send his servants and he will separate the chaff from the you know different ways that he has put it over there'll be a time when there will be separation God's word calls for what separation from unbelief not only in your head and your heart but un belief right in all its aspects even when it's personified God's word calls for separation from unbelief praise the Lord hallelujah so we understand that the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Spirit using Brother Bren cast his net into the sea of humanity and brought in all that the net could catch and brought them all to sh believing praise the Lord but I believe that now is the time praise God this time has recycled from through each Church age each messenger had this time at the end of his message when God would do a separation right praise God but I'm talking at our time our day now how God is separating the rainbow tra out from the rest of uh creatures that were in the net all were in the net all were in the church all were in the message all was believing the prophet all was shouting all was praising God but he alone knew what he wanted he didn't come to have crabs he didn't feel like eating crabs he didn't come to eat crawfish he didn't come to eat Bottom Feeders he he didn't come for shrimp or anything else he wanted rainbow trout there were marked from since the day they were born the seven color rainbow color was striped right across their souls and he knew what he wanted and so he come to separate them from the rest that were there oh praise God forever more hallelujah amen so separating what the bride from the in those that were invited or from the guests praise God so today I really want to talk about are you a guest are you among the guests or are you of the Bride praise God now we know with the opening of The Seven Seals that the prophet plainly said it he came down uh when the Seven Angels Came to him he came down because he identified the angel in the front with the sweptback wings that was leading the rest of them he said that was not a man of Earth he's telling you that those angels represented The Messengers that was there before but now here is the mighty the angel himself coming on the scene amen and when he's coming on the scene now he says not he is not a man of Earth this is the Lord From Heaven glory to God what is it the opening of the seventh seal was the mystery coming of Jesus Christ who promised he would come in these last days as a thief in the night a thief comes very quietly he doesn't call attention to himself he doesn't keep a whole lot of noise to let people recognize what important thing is going on he just steals in and he steals out and that's what God is doing now byass like he did when Jesus was born he bypassed all the big synagogues all the big high priests all ananas cahas Herod all of he bypassed everyone and went out in the fields to simple Shepherds and revealed that he was born in the city of David see but why didn't he come to cifas these men are men of note at least they have doctors of divinity they have llds phds and what not every else but that's God's choosing amen is that right he chose the lowly the simple the humble and just when you are thinking no that guy can't be the Messiah he I know I know his mother he was born over here I saw when he used to play with the kids but that's how God hides what he's doing in Simplicity amen because man always tends to look for something high and lofty and they're looking at the stars and they can't even see the the the the genius the blessing of God God in the grass they can't even create a blade but they're talking about going to the stars and we know the scriptures really already said it though you rise to the Stars I will bring you down God already know they can go there so he already said it by the prophets in the word though you try to go up to the Stars I'm going to bring you down right so here we go praise the Lord so we know that separation is taken separation and identification is taking place by Revelation he's identifying his own because only they have been given the capacity the capacitor the whatever you want to call it to be able to pick up the Revelation coming out of the word which is not just the written bible just like when a man speaks it's not just the the word that you can type on on a piece of paper but the nuances and the undertones the what goes along with that right so so God now has really put his secret not just in the written word but in the unwritten word when you say Unwritten word a lot of people thinks mean you're going to add something to no you're not adding anything it's the same word but this one is the spirit of of the word that couldn't be written down see could not be written down you can't write down the spirit of the word the spirit of the message the spirit of how the person said it that that that person has to come back and tell you how they said it is that right why why why but if I wrote the word why you wouldn't know how they said it so God is his own interpreter am and he will make it thank you Jesus so he's come back under that seventh seal and he is now making himself by his word to his bride it's going to be preached everybody's going to hear it but uh some will hear it but only naturally because they have ears others will hear it in their heart because they were predestinated and chosen of God to hear it in their day and in their time praise the Lord I always stop and pause for a minute to ask you does this make sense to you praise the name of the Lord hallelujah yes sir the Deep calls to the deep and then when the Deep calls to the Deep the Deep responds in every love story that is what it is it's the Deep calling to the Deep um I first met my wife she's sitting right there she doesn't like this because she doesn't like to call attention but um here I am preaching um and I'm preaching the word we were in fasting and prayer all day two o'l now we take a break just to drink a bit of water and go back get some Breeze go back in and start praying again there a bunch of ministers so I go out on the balcony of the house and and there you know just taking it and there's this beauty coming down street and seven Thunders blasted Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam my good Lord have mercy and so I had I had to approach her I just couldn't look at her from afar right go back in and try to pray you can't concentrate anyway that's not what I'm preaching about let me come off of that and get back to what um I'm supposed to be talking about here praise the Lord so we understand Supernatural uh uh identification of the Bride by her capacity to receive Revelation is going on now yes is that right many are called but few are chosen yes that is true praise the Lord so the prophet used the Gathering by the supernatural attraction of the word of God and that super natural attraction just pray for me here I don't want to speak in tongues because that's not what we here for be here to receive the word praise the Lord but um we see then that before you can have a wedding before you can even have an invitation to a wedding the bridegroom already would have to have his bride and know who is his bride or there going to be no wedding invitation going out you you understand what praise the Lord so so what we are saying and what you ought to say see from the word god already had his bride in his mind from before the foundations of the [Applause] world before she was manifested on the earth and born of a ordinary mother and father and come here to live in human bodies God knew you and I if we are part of him he already knew who we were amen and that is why Satan cannot impersonate the third pool because only those ones that were in his mind that were a a part of his bride can really received his Unwritten word his revelation of this Bible that we all read only they can receive it blessed are your ears that you hear blessed are your eyes praise God that you can see here oh For unto you it is given given to what to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God it's a mystery to them but a revelation to you is that right praise the Lord hallelujah amen so we were chosen from before the foundation his bride was chosen before the foundation let that be a settled fact in your mind chosen to be the apple of his eyes praise the Lord according to Songs of Solomon praise God and so the wedding is going on here now on Earth praise God you can read a book proving his word where brother brandham says that yes but the wedding is going on here now on Earth when the word of God marries your soul is that right praise the Lord but human beings they're thinking of a marriage with a lot of people gathered around and and eating ham and eating chicken and turkey and wedding cakes and they don't understand this is we talking about a spiritual thing going on you don't you don't see that uh like that but it's in your heart the word and your heart matches and when you hear the word the the the real word if I put it that way when you hear the real word preached and the Holy Spirit start taking it and speaking to your soul it's just like you like you knew it before it's like you're are you you you're reuniting with what you're supposed to be and know and it fits you like a hand in a glove you can't get away from it you turn to the right you turn to the left you look up you look down you can't see anything else because it fits your soul amen praise God forever more glory to God I I think I mentioned to you years ago the scientists were doing h a an experiment they took a female moth to New York City and had her there and the male lab was over here in Canada they loosed him and in about 6 months time Bang Bang Bang on the window it was the male Marth which they caught and proved he was the male M because he was tagged that they could he somehow he came found a way all those miles right to where she was and that's what's happened with us we came from his side we got caught in sin we come down here and he here he comes down from his glory ever living story my God and savior came and Jesus was his name oh praise God and he came to us to find us and to bring us back to where we were we were lost but now we're found we were blind but now we see we recognize who we are because we are one of his own praise be to God hallelujah so he's coming now to take us to his father's house the wedding is over and The Chariot ride is what takes place now and we go with him to the father's house praise the Lord so we understand therefore that the bride's name was and is already recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world uh you take all those scriptures I don't want to think about that but your mind could go in that area where he says there's none really going to be saved talking saved except that their names are in the Lamb's Book of Life praise the Lord that would be another discussion and preaching that doesn't just mean the bride but like I tell you the guests even had wedding wedding garments praise the Lord but the fact is her name was already recorded so uh there we understand therefore the eternal security we see the teaching of predestination and for knowledge the god whom we serve capable of knowing predestinated me doesn't mean that he push you into something which means he knows he forew and because he forew he could create the circumstances to bring you to himself praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah so we are registered we are we the marriage and our names as bride is already on the marriage license amen it's registered it's recorded it's in heaven it's in the Lamb's Book of Life praise be to God Amen I can stand here today and say I am bride I am part of that bride praise the Lord I believe it with all my heart can you say it let's say it together I am part of the Bride let's repeat it again I am part of the Bride I'm recorded in the book Hallelujah Hall that's what the Seven Seals was about the first six seals the Holy Spirit used the prophet to show you the path of life to show you how the word or the light came down through all those ages to our time and it also showed to us that tracing the serpent seed right from the beginning right to now it also traced for us the uh mystery of iniquity from before for the Foundations at the foundations after the foundations he trace it right going right back to the pits of hell and so that we might know what was what is and what is going to be right we are part of him so that's why he has to make us know that praise God hallelujah so our name is recorded and we have uh here now we thank God that we can put the license on the display praise the lord we can put that license on display praise God and she can start we can start saying I am bride praise the Lord amen why you have faith confidence in your bridegroom we are not going to be a bride left waiting at the altar no it sounds funny but no he's made a promise I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also praise the Lord and we are trusting in his promise the prophet said we are resting on that we're believing the word of God hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah yes sir praise God and she can say that because she knows her name is already recorded on that license praise the Lord and that's a blessing to know that that praise God so many are called to come and believe the message but they are not chosen to be a part of the supernatural body of the Lord Jesus Christ for this day I'm talking about he was the son of man she is the son of man for today back there he he was in the form of Jesus Christ but that God has come back now in a bride form in the form of a bride as he displayed on the day of Pentecost when the pillar fire broke up and there were small tongues of fire showing that he broke himself up to go into his Believers you see that's why the Bible says to us in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily God was in Christ now Christ is in Us in that day you'll know I am in the father you in me and I in you praise God hallelujah that's this day glory be to his wonderful name praise God yes so uh chosen to be a part of that Supernatural body and that's the difference between calling and election is that clear the difference between calling and election anybody can be called but only few are elected and as the song said I am one of the few amen one of the few praise God so the elected of course are the ones whose names are recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life some other names the Bible the prophet tells us and the Bible tells us we be blotted out or just use the word you erased names are going to be erased um out amen from The Book of Life in other words they will be as if they never even existed they they never they're so evil that God got to get rid of them completely and um there's not going to be any memory no record no history that they even existed they'll be blotted out and he raise forever amen praise God I am going to now move on from last week and let's go a little further is that okay uh we're going to go to the church age page 268 and I'm going to ask those uh Brothers to put that back up put that up glory to God be a little patient with me here today today uh I don't even think I'll be able to finish but I use discretion with times and all like that because I want you to receive the truth uh and I want you to receive it uh not because um I am saying it I want you to be able to think on these things right uh and receive it within your heart hallelujah amen I want to start from here by saying you will note here Judas was one of those who were casting out Devils amen but we know he was a devil is that right oh this is really interesting Oh my he was a devil he was the son of the devil the son of of ption that's what it means he was a son of Satan all right he was a son of the devil praise the Lord so but we find out amen that judas's name is in uh let me stop here just a minute The Book of Life Book of natural life right God has a record of everybody born whether they be good bad or ugly uh whatever whoever you are even those ones that were unborn and we don't know their name but the parent already had a name in their mind they were going to name God knows all about that you believe that amen because he told Jeremiah said I know you before you you were even in your mother's womb I knew you right so God knows all that right so here we go we so we see then friends that um with this book Book of Life That's natural we come back now to the Bible the Bible is also a part of the book of life right Book of Life the Bible itself you can even say is The Book of Life uh in a sense that our spirit not our body now our spirit has has is recorded in that word somewhere whether it's it's recorded as a bad Spirit a fox spirit a snake Spirit a lying Spirit a spider it's recorded there in symbol form within your word of God and that's your spirit but then we find out we come right back to the Lamb's Book of Life where your soul if you're a Believer and you are part of the elected bride she is recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life right the 144,000 other groups recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life praise God hallelujah now listen John 17:12 while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of predition Amen praise the Lord that the scripture might be fulfilled praise God he's talking that Judas was given to him but he was lost but all the other ones were not lost they were chosen he was telling you judas's purpose that he was here Among Us that the scripture might be fulfilled so so it's like saying for God to be a Healer there had to be a devil to create sicknesses and disease and trouble and trial for him to be a deliverer for him to show forth his power and his grace so he allowed it amen he allowed it that he could display his attributes that we could get to know him his nature his personality and his way of doing things praise the Lord hallelujah yes sir continuing John 13:10 11 to 11 and 18 Jesus said to him he that is washed need it not safe to wash his feet but is clean every wit and you are clean but not all for he knew who would betray him therefore said he you are not all clean I speak not not of you all I know whom I have chosen look it's right there in scripture he says I know whom I have chosen amen praise the Lord you don't go and and beat on an altar and say Lord choose me Lord Lord I know you chose her already to be the bride but you have a chance to change her and put me in her place and and take off her name from the license and put my no that doesn't happen with God we have a God that changes not we got a God that doesn't change his word stands forever it holds forever more our security is eternal praise God we are anchored in Him Praise the Lord and kept by the power of God glory to his wonderful name amen yes sir I know whom I have chosen but that the scripture might be fulfilled amen he that e had bread with me had lifted up his heel against me brother BR speaking now if language means anything at all we must admit that Judas was chosen by Jesus wow now we we dealt with the calling and the choosing now we got even in the chosen there's something there that that even Judas was was chosen mhm by Jesus John 13:18 yet he was not clean Judas was also given to Jesus by the father Hallelujah my now John 17:12 Let It Be noted here that the choosing and the giving is the exact parallel as in the illustration of of Moses and Pharaoh Jacob and Esau for True Esau and Jacob were both though they were both forn they were predestinated to wrath praise God one chosen for glorification and a Rapture and the other chosen for wrath deliberately left there left among among the disciples left among let's use the word the Believers but with the purpose of Wrath oh my glory to God hallelujah so we find that God didn't think about Judas he did think about him he knew him and he understood what was going to happen but they were predestinated to to Wrath uh they were called of God too you know how many of you know that they were called too everybody actually was called but then the bride had a deeper call that brought her out praise God glory to God hallelujah so though Esau and Pharaoh were both forn they were predestinated to the WTH while the end of Moses and Jacob was glorification praise the Lord amen isn't that wonderful to know that friends that God shows us for the Rapture or for glorification and that's where we see the richness of God's grace because uh like people think they have a lot to do with their salvation how much they pray how much they fast and that's why she got saved or he got saved because they really fasted they really prayed they did this they did that no salvation took place from before the foundation of the world you are just now manifested that you are one of the few you are manifesting what was happened back there just like how uh the lamb was what slain before the foundation of the world but God had to let it be displayed on the earth so then it had to come to Earth and he had to physically come here die so that you uh human beings with five senses can see it and identify and understand understand what really took place so our names already was recorded Hallelujah but we got to display that our names were already recorded by manifesting who we were up there down here by the Life of Christ flowing out of us the the the very virtues the very power and the presence of the Living God making itself manifest in the prepared vessels prepared for this hour to receive the word and displ his Divine person amen praise the name of the Lord Jesus amen wonderful praise God look I'm going to just jump over a lot of things here praise God quoting from uh that again he says Judas was numbered with the 12 and actually had a part with them in the ministry previous to Pentecost you know that Judas was a minister no it's right there it says he had a part of the ministry right and uh uh previous to Pentecost acts 1:16 to 17 says men and Brethren this scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas amen praise the Lord who spoke of Judas the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David wasn't David but the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spoke of Judas and if the Holy Ghost spoke of Judas that is why his name is in the written word his name is in written word the name of a lot of other characters of various means are in the word because God allow it to be there to fulfill his Divine Purpose and to bring glory to his name amen praise the Lord continuing now he obtained a part of this ministry the part that Judas obtained amongst the 12 and then lost it was neither inferior to the ministries of the other 11 neither was it of devilish foreign uh Ministry interjected amongst them but acts 1:25 that he may take part of this ministry he was even an apostle it's right there you see as your understanding opens you begin to see what God in his great wisdom and might can do he was an apostle uh take part of this ministry and apostleship from which Judah Us by transgression fell that he might go to his own place he's going to his own place there not place where the scripture says for there was no place found for him there was no he had no place that he could find right so he got to go to his own place like brother bran speaking on the uh about the that day on Calvary when he talks about when the thieves were there there and and Jesus was on the cross and the one said Lord Remember Me Right praise the Lord Jesus said today you'll be with me in Paradise right see that man's one there he says but the other one says oh if you call yourself Christ come off the cross the prophet said and he went to his inheritance he went where he came from see it displays the chosen it displays the seed of God right there and makes the separation Judas that devil lost that God Holy Ghost Ministry and killed himself committed suicide which is a shameful act and went to his own place his name was even left uh even in the book of life amen but later his name blotted out praise the Lord it doesn't mean that it's BL out by burning the Bible but the record God has of him would be blotted out in other words it'll be like if you never existed it's just like you or I do you know if they took away your passports and burnt it no government has no if if all the information about you get burnt up nobody has any record of that you you existed you somebody says oh uh John Simon who is he what country is from there's no record of any country that he's in so it's put it in a simple way the fact is he will be totally erased and he is just an example of many others recorded in the Bible like the Pharaoh like Esau uh I don't know it says that about Kain but I mean characters like that that the Bible talks about their names being erased and completely block blotted out no record of them as if they were never there and like if they never even existed they never even left like even the most wicked guys would go and do some graffiti or they would put their hand or their feet in some freshly made concrete of somebody that worked so hard but you see it's the human thing that they they feel uh displaced if you can't leave a record that I was here I existed I I made a mark somewhere but God erased all the marks amen God erased everything there's nothing there for you because of what you did and the life that you live and who you manifest you didn't manifest him you manifested uh where you came from praise the lord we we're showing the difference between calling and election between being a guest and being part of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen praise God hallelujah now the Bible talks about a seven Church ages but when those Church ages are over um you know the quote from the stature of a perfect man where brother brandham himself and that's the thing that caught me that broke me into the fullness of the revelation of the word reading the statue of a perfect man when brother Bram talks about the the church Ages come to an end and after they are over I am waiting and looking for that man that woman that will come he's saying that way back when he was alive that will come at the ending of these seals going to the eternal Church age that will be at the end of the seals praise the Lord hallelujah brother if you could find that would be very nice um but you don't have to if it it's going to be difficult for you to find that quotation amen praise the Lord so the Bible is written but in the Bible is a lot of mystery and and that mystery revealed to the bride is the unwritten word making itself known to her right that is is the that is his letter to his bride uh that when she read it she knows exactly what he's thinking you know she knows what is in his mind she knows because uh they are uh they are um husband and wife praise the Lord amen praise the Lord so the father has got to reveal the word to you and when he reveals the word to you it identifies you pra praise the Lord he said but me I am not uh I don't understand anything you got to understand something do you know that Judas was one of the brightest of the disciples he was sharp he was bright but he was not chosen he was he was figures numbers my goodness he was just wonderful marvelous that you talk about education Judas had it and he was there amongst them praise the Lord and so we living in a day now and I mention that because everybody now now the devil always does that he follows the pattern he's a copycat see when you are only preaching about Pentecost everybody start talking about Pentecost all of a sudden it's not just Pentecost you need to be born again everybody start talking about being born again Jim Baker this one that one doesn't matter how much mascara they have on and start to cry and it all start to run down their face and they say oh thank God I'm born again and they're showing the very evidence that they're not born again but the devil always has to Copy Cat every time God moves and a cycle starts he tries to copy it as quickly as possible to say I I got it too I got it too everything God got he got God does it he does he jumps and he does that too praise the Lord and so now we talking about Revelation before they would laugh at people like me talking about Revelation I'm talking I'm telling you the facts when first of all I begin to say look we didn't just come in the message you need to have a birth out of this message oh I was scorned and laughed and pushed off to the side then they start preaching it they'll never admit that that was right but they start preaching it and everybody's now preaching it oh yes they're born again in the message then come on make a another move moving to another level again and you start to um Talk talk about you can't be born again unless God reveals it to you cannot be born again unless God reveals it to you now what happens everybody's talking about Revelation amen they will pour out um uh let's say vessels full of of information religious information even message information and then they call it Revelation because of the abundance of what they can put forth and they don't realize that that is not Revelation Revelation is Moment by moment moment by moment anytime any place it it's like that I can't fully explain it I'm just trying to give you an idea praise the Lord and they got this idea that's only to brother brandham no it's to all believers that are truly of the part of the elect amen hallelujah yes sir praise God Amen that's the way it is so Judas was very bright but and Judas was there receiving and hearing everything Jesus was preaching just as well as Peter they all were hear the very same message they were all hearing it but one there was Judas and on the other hand a uneducated Peter that can't even write his name and this one to the very end he kept trying to figure to see if there is a secret that brother Simon have the a secret that Jesus have some some little something if I can find out exactly what Jesus is doing if it's a magic trick he have with the healings and always trying to find out something and that by that proving that you don't really believe in Supernatural Revelation right because Supernatural Revelation is like that that you could be sitting right here right now and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit just say this is happening over here go here do this do you that happens today believe you me it doesn't make me or you uh some special person because among the elect we are all the same praise the Lord hallelujah yes sir sitting in a restaurant sitting with a Pentecostal um Bishop uh and the waitress comes up and she begin serving all of a sudden oh her name is Sono she comes from Sono so I said oh uh your name is soon so I just said what I heard she said how do you know that said where' you come I I said don't you live behind such and such a mall a place where where I never went uh I I don't know behind there and I'm not saying that now for you to look at me I'm just trying to tell you that this thing is alive I'm telling you it's on broadcast now it's going on now and we need to know we are a part of it thankes praise God hallelujah hallelujah blessed be his name amen she said oh my God she says I got a brother like that that he says these kinds of things and I don't understand where he get that from I said oh don't worry about that but you know maybe God is talking to you trying to get you to uh commit your soul to to him and this and that you know you know the rest of it I won't get into but that's how the Holy Spirit Works in that kind of a way but when they they hear like me talking about there some them will laugh they'll think it's a joke or like the devil always does oh he's just bragging is that right yeah you know brother Ernie FAS said brother Bram was with him in the in the vehicle and they're driving and brother Bram praising God and thanking God for what God did through him and used him in this and that and he said I just thought oh you're you're just bragging brother Bram just immediately turned and said what did you say Arnie he said oh nothing not he says come on Ernie you know better than that he said well I well I I thought you were bragging he says yes I was but not on me if you you listen closely I'm bragging like that just like David bragged on what the Lord did I'm doing that to give glory to his name for you to recognize what God is doing by his holy spirit it's real all my doubts are settled and I know by God it's real brother sister the spirit of the Lord and the power and the presence of almighty God is a life forever more behold I live I live forever more yes sir praise God Amen so we know Peter wasn't as bright as Judas ignorant unlearned couldn't even write rather BR so he couldn't even spell his name but yet the Bible says the Holy Ghost revealed to Peter and he couldn't take it he couldn't hold it he got him he Thou Art the Christ the son of the living God when Jesus said who do you say I am all the rest saying well Dr so and so said you're this and you know Dr so and so brother this brother that no he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it thank you Lord amen yes sir one election and the other one reprobate to the word of God my goodness yes truly the scripture is real many are called but few are chosen amen praise God so now we talked about him coming down the Seven Seals being unveiled and through those Seven Seals uh being unveiled and because the first six were history and then after that when the seventh seal opened up you can go even now from from the book you read it all you want you can listen to all you want and and it looks like there was nothing in there he didn't identify anything because he can't at that point he can't anymore the mighty angel had come down and now he is the his own interpretor his own messenger he doesn't have to have a friend taking a note to his to his bride he can speak to her himself and so God becomes his own interpreter see a prophet is an interpreter of the word word but he doesn't need that God the great prophet becomes his own Prophet amen so he's making himself known by his Holy Spirit and you who are sitting you got to recognize of yourself when he is speaking when he is speaking to you not just to somebody else but to you and you recognize it you recognize it clear as a bell you recognize when God is speaking to you by his word amen glory to God I'm so thankful that I am one of the few and that the mystery of the Seven Seals is now unveiling and unfolding itself and calling out the names of the elect that are on the record of the book back there in the mind of God on the Lamb's Book of Life that seven seal is calling out your name amen Mary you remember when he was in the garden and he was risen from the dead At first she thought it was the gardener uh she thought it was just her pastor or thought it was just the minister or she thought it was just that and it was in a sense but the fact is he wanted her to know who he really was so he says Mary well anybody could have called that word that name but she recognized the voice is that right she recognized the voice because that voice is particular to him and so when he speaks to you you will know when he's talking to you praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen look a lot of important things happen in my life your life we all got lot of um let's say marks in our lives we could said this was a fantastic thing happened my life changed at this point my the whole trajectory of my future changed when so and so so happened you know it was a real blessing when I I I told some uh Brothers about when uh the recession they had the recession in the 80s I couldn't find a job I couldn't even buy a job nobody was giving anybody jobs and and so but when the time came and the Holy Spirit said now go and go up I walked right into a job as smooth as butter and was there for so many years by the grace of God you see was a turning point and when you get turning points in your life God can allow a certain job to come your way changes your whole life or all of a sudden out of nowhere you don't think you could get a house or you could be in a house because the economy is so bad all of a sudden God does a supernatural thing and places you right inside of a house oh my you'll never forget that for the rest of your life it's a happy event you're you're rejoicing you're joyful amen more than that none of you especially the women will never forget when their first child was born what a happy event amen oh we're just so happy certain things leaves marks in our lives that we recognize is a real blessing to us praise the Lord hallelujah but you see the greatest thing that ever happened to you or me should really be the unveiling of this word of God that has made itself blessed are your eyes that you could see and blessed are your ears that you can hear the word of God not hearing with your natural ears everybody can hear me in the building I think I preached on that and mentioned to the Believers do you know there's such such a thing as a dog whistle and I believe trainers use it you wouldn't hear anything you wouldn't hear a thing but the dogs can hear it because it's in a higher level let me use a word high higher Dimension they were built to hear that I'm not saying we are dogs but God has built us and made us as we are the pot mold this claim mold this person the individual you me every one of us mold Us in such a way that we can hear things that others can't hear it's going on right like the prophet say it's going on through the building right now I can see it but you can't see it because you don't have the equipment see but because he was ordained to be a prophet he could see it using that same Principle as the elect can hear the unwritten word because they were built to hear it it's in a higher Dimension all they're going to hear is this part of it reading of it the preaching of it they going hear all that but the other part that goes right to your soul the real True Believer recognizes and hear the word of God hallelujah amen no happiness like when I realize I can hear the word of God hallelujah none like it yes sir praise the Lord I bless God and give him all the praise and the glory and the honor here praise the Lord Jesus amen now we know all things work together for good for them that love God and to them who are called according to his purpose Romans 8:28 pray praise the Lord called according to his purpose amen so we are a purpose called people we weren't called to wander about in the wilderness is that right we were but we were called out that we may go in I said we were called out that we may go in to the promised land there bunch of them go out there have to wonder about you know wandering Stars you know I I I wonder if the prophet meant this I I wonder Oh look The Inspiration is on me because I I I don't want to go off I I let me stick with what I have to say here praise the Lord amen glory to God now you know that Judas was predestinated Pharaoh was predestinated I'm repeating actually but in a different way he was predestinated right because God had a purpose for them to see we have a purpose but they also had a purpose one for wrath and one to uh to fulfill the word and one to be the bride and to fulfill the word in another way right as such praise the Lord so this thing is like a Ra's heads now this is what I'm showing you you you you just use a term chosen you use call called any one of them is like a razor edge and takes the Holy Spirit to divide um for us to recognize what is really going on Amen so we find out that both groups are predestinated both the bride and these figures of Wrath and for damnation both uh uh were predestinated but predestinated for what one predestinated for Destruction and Damnation and fulfilling the word of God with their evil deeds and the other was also predestinated towards glory and towards being vessels to manifest him praise the Lord hallelujah so when you use these words there is the holy spirit has got to divide that for you to recognize what's really going on you say oh I'm predestinated devil says oh I'm predestinated too I got Revelation I got it too right but no he he he even can get it from God too but for his own purpose whatever God's purpose is given and be coming to show you very clearly that uh brother sister where God's spirit is uh working in such a way amen but you must understand that what God reveals to him would be totally different than what he reveals to you because he's revealing to you what you need to fulfill your purpose and to him over here he reveals what he needs to fulfill his purpose of Wrath look you don't tell me that some of those guys that get up there with a guitar and singing on the that they're not inspired but they're inspired to some something else and if you don't watch because that inspiration is there you can even be pulled into it you hear some of them singing and the drums beating and the music going and before you know it you start what did that you can feel the spirit of inspiration and you don't even know why you did that but you got to understand they're inspired to damnation and wrath and evil but the other side you're inspired to Holiness Heaven home Rapture personality of Christ in you you you inspired to that praise the Lord and that is why witches can recognize a true son is daughter of God God they can see and they can feel and they can recognize what is in you and you if you are sensitive you can recognize it too praise the Lord if you called to do that but thanks be to God so here it is brothers and sisters so it is that God's word must be fulfilled praise God hallelujah uh brother um at the end of the quotes I gave you there is the one with the a woman with the piece of cloth the cloth pattern I just brother brandham uses this he says these things but when you put it all together with understanding you can see clearly what the Lord is's telling you by telling you the story of the woman with the pattern he's actually telling you what God actually did right and so um good if they can have that up there then you'll see it look a woman is going to cut off a dress she's got a large piece of goods whatever it is and she's got a pattern she looks over this big pie peace of goods it's up to her where she lays the pattern is that right she can choose it from any part of this goods and the whole Goods is Sanctified it's clean it's election God's election so what does he do he takes my election and places this pattern of Christ anywhere he wants to on the goods then it's separated I use that word get cut out amen the rest of the goods just as holy as this part was holy but by choice that God made his choice before the foundation of the world Hallelujah I said hallelujah praise God hallelujah you're not better than anybody we not better than anybody else but God by his Divine choice CH glory to God before the foundation of the world made us who we are by his grace God rich in Mercy that's why the prophet said one in a million that pattern had gone a little this way that way that way that way you might not be within the confines of the pattern but thank God he placed Us in the pattern amen oh I'm one of his own can God can the Potter can the clay say to the why makest me thus can God who is just when he could say to Esau or Jacob before the either boy was born done right or wrong I hate Esau and I love Jacob right I put Jacob in the pattern and I put Esau outside of it it's because that by his foror knowledge he know what Esau was and what Jacob was he knows what's in man before the foundation of the world that's fine brother praise the name of the Lord Do You Believe [Applause] itall amen hallelujah praise the Lord God glory to God Amen the so everybody gets called but they have different purposes what this one's purpose is just to fulfill the part of being the bride and the other one's part is to be the villain and and they can't do anything else they have to be that because that's what it is God laid it out here I'm going to start winding this up praise the Lord because some of you I'm sure you want to go break break some bread or um not baked bread I'm not telling you sisters to go home and work now I'm talking about breaking bread or if you don't want to break bread you can go buy donuts Hallelujah I I just want to touch a few little things you you mind amen hallelujah now we talk a little bit about the foolish virgins how many of you know that story in the Bible but a foolish virgin there I mean know friends that uh that th These Foolish virgins uh that were there were virgins we just talk about the pattern and we just talk about oh it's the same material it's just where God chose to put the padron now I'm bringing that thought here we talking about the foolish virgins uh they were all virgins they were all holy they were all holding to the word the best they knew how right that praise the name of the Lord now brother brandham talks about when the time comes to take the mark of the beast you know the foolish virgins are going to reject that you know they're going to reject the mark of the beast because by that time when the bride is raptured and realize the Rapture is already taken place they who were foolish going to realize that they were foolish to have delayed and to not go into the fullness of the word and their Folly as the scripture says will be made manifest and when their Folly is made manifest that's all that's what makes them foolish virgins right at that time praise God so brother sister after the bride gets raptured all of a sudden now they really really believe and really going to hold the words of God's uh hold to God's word so we know that they're going to have to go through the tribulation period they're going to have to face the mark of the beast they're going to have to face persecution they're going to have to go through the tribulation uh the prophet makes it clear to be purged they're going to have to be purged and so they'll go right through all of that right into that period and then they have to come up to the white Throne judgment but thank God for the bride she doesn't have to go up to the white Throne judgment because he said if you judge yourself now by the word you shall not be judged but you already passed from death into life we will come before the Judgment seat of Christ but it will not be for judgment concerning hell and that's hell is not in in your future I let me repeat it hell is no more in your future if you are a True Believer the Judgment seat of Christ is as to rewards some will receive more some less just depends on your reward of course somebody like brother brand more rewards right like that but that's what it is but you already passed from Death onto life and pass to a place where God my friends is recognize you and God is blessing you in such a wonderful way praise the Lord hallelujah amen now I made an observation while uh looking at this that what do you call the leftover cloth after you let this Finish Well I don't know that you use scissors and that sort of stuff now these days remnants you you hear the word and the Bible uses that same word in application to certain groups of people these are remnants these are leftovers from you know and this is what God is telling you so so just like those foolish virgins they're like a Remnant right of the same pattern from which the same clause from which we were cut Hallelujah but one come out one way and one comes the other way one was in God's thoughts about that pattern and another wasn't is as simple as that amen praise God hallelujah so I'm thanking God today that God counted us worthy to escape damnation and Hell Fire he counted you worthy before you even got here amen that you are worthy to escape damnation and Hell Fire amen praise God and we won't even have to bear no mark of the beast so don't be people talking all those things going internet mark of the beast this and that and you start to get nervous and scared I hope I don't get the Mark I no how you going to get the mark you'll be me marked by the Holy Spirit I marked I'm marked everywhere I go I'm marked by the Holy Ghost amen yes sir praise God so we escape mark of the beast we escape all of that praise God because by his eternal thought by his pattern we are we are in the pattern we are in his thoughts and we're walking every step of the way with him and that's all by his Mercy we wouldn't have to go through tribulation we would have to go through persecution for for for um uh purging and all of that we would have to go through any of that Hallelujah and we are counted worthy to leave this earth Hallelujah you're counted worthy that you are to leave this earth and we go to our home beyond the blue not the literal Skies like this but we're going into the presence of almighty God many are called few are chosen wedding guest or bride I can't say that and no Pastor can get up and say that you bride and giving you a false hope when you yourself don't know where you stand with God each one today has got to come to personal and individual self Accounting in the presence of almighty God whether you do it here in church whether you you do it at home in your quiet time in prayer talking to God and let the Holy Spirit made known to you amen hallelujah now Romans 98 uh I'm I'm trying to stretch you out as much as I can am look it's it's just what it's just about a few minutes to one I'm going use every minute uh praise the Lord got R therefore he therefore ha he Mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he Harden at I want to talk about how uh Pharaoh many times you know Pharaoh was going to give in to Moses but then God steep in and hardened his heart because he has to fulfill a purpose he has to fulfill a purpose of doing what he did so God kind of hardened his heart right there amen hallelujah so there we see it continue thou Willl say then unto me why do he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will nay but man who art thou that the repli against God shall the thing form say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus right and say well why did God choose him to be bright and her to because he knows what's in man he knows praise the Lord hallelujah let's continue the scripture the power part power over the clay over the same lump to make one vessel over the same lump to make one vessel and of honor and using the same lump make another of Dishonor you see that is it's the same principle with the pattern but it's showing you God has the power he has the right because he is the P we are the clay and he can make one to be a disposal unit and take the other one and make it a dinner plate on his table that's God's choice amen it's not you going and say I take Jesus as my savior you take him you took that man to be your husband or should he make the choice huh so so back to the word and recognize what God has done and what is doing and that's why we understand all these teachings that it's not what you doing here is going to change his mind you can't change his mind oh oh my that brother backslid well he got his own Journey he going to have to deal with that when he get in the presence of God but if he's an elected seed God will deal with that that's not my business to talk about about him deal with that let God deal with that but I'm pressing on the upward Way New Heights I'm gaining every day praise God hallelujah glory to God amen amen the holy spirit is telling me stop but it's so juicy I just want to sink my teeth more into the word but right now God bless every one of you for having such patience with me and listening to the word of God faithfully and I really do appreciate it that you give such respects to the word God bless you while the musicians are coming are you Hallelujah my my my stay in the word brothers and sisters even when you think you you're not understanding it or you're not getting anything from it just keep playing it keep listening to it and when you least expect all of a sudden because the prophet said it it's not when you go and think you're going to go and study so you can know they will know when it is time for them to know he will reveal to you when it is time for you to know praise the Lord hallelujah I am one of the few brother I am one of the few one of [Music] the it clim it and believe it and the opposition strong for the bright eyes [Music] away if I plan to go through when I do I must be firmly de follow the lord to follow by obeying his word by oby his [Music] word the original word the original word the original s the original word the original word what I believe the son of is re seven SE is unil the original life the original SE High tribute were manifested in his Bri in this last St we have Tau the Revelation by the Lost Prophet message and we know who we are raise up for praise the Lord praise the Lord original life the original life stand up the original the original that's what I believe the son of man has revealed seven he as unil the original life the original SE God bless you please be seated this as I mentioned to you this past uh weekend from Friday the young men met at the bance conservation area and they were having a great wonderful time was able to share with them and in doing so I sh shared a little bit with them um that they should get behind uh our precious brother Danny who is here who will be the minister that will follow uh in my footsteps and preach and declare the word of God because David had armor bearers and they were right there Moses had Joshua when they were fighting the battle and his arm got tired sometimes he got overwhelmed his arm they raised his hands up right and so God has to always have men and women like that in the church to support the ministry in every way not just by attending church it's more than that it's a life that's in you that responds to the word of the hour and we're all trying to take the message out to the world now I believe another surge of the holy spirit is started and it's coming and you you be in position to receive it you may have so much work to do it don't seem like that yet some of you may end up in teaching in a z school some some of you who are sitting here may end up being uh you know people on the church board whether trustee whether deacons the rest of us are getting older we serve our purpose maybe we continue a bit more but others being raised up by the grace of God to fill our places and our positions praise the Lord amen praise the Lord amen I want to know I'm in contact with you and as you listen listening to what I'm saying here don't want to go out there and say oh well brother Simon didn't tell us I didn't hear I want you to know this because it's actually happening the cycle of life is repeating again I told them I said look God used myself and the other ministers of a certain Lifetime and age and for his own purpose and we were kind of in a rough crude way used to chop down all the big tall trees um and light fires chase out all the snakes that were trying to hide in the congregations and sometimes God use us in a rough crude way like buzas and uh uh to drive those things out but it was for his purpose that um men were built like that and us used by God for his own Glory but now after Moses it's changing it's going over to the Joshua generation it's coming over to you who have got to take the same word and maybe you will apply it in a different manner brother Brandon was waiting to see men and women that will come into this uh eight Church St this Capstone hour and see how they behave and how they live and act and I believe he's looking and seeing because we are in compassed with a cloud of witnesses and so I I am going to now sit back and watch from the end of the year and see what the holy spirit is going to do through you because you have a great time a great opportunity you have not gone this way before for in other words God was telling Joshua I know you don't know the way but I know the way you just follow me and once you follow me I'll make sure you have good success so I want every one of you here now get behind the ministry Hallelujah right get behind the ministry praise the Lord support the ministry praise the Lord in every way that means you don't eat at this restaurant over here and then go over to the next church and pay your ties over there how you get quiet all of a sudden let me say it again just stop and think if you at at the manding restaurant and then you get up to leave and they say well you supposed to pay say I will pay but I want to go over there and pay over at Swiss shallal they said no no no no no no that cannot work you got to pay where you at and so be faithful pay your ties right pay your ties and when you pay your ties it's God's ties we'll talk further on that but the fact is uh God uses that because now God will use that to be able to support the minister and the ministry for his glory and honor but the main point I was making to them is that you young men Step Up surround our brother and defend our brother physically and spiritually one time brother BR in the pulpit and he's telling a story of the pastor in the pulpit and a guy comes in with a shotgun and the deacons leave him to come right to the front to go shoot the pastor he says real deacons would have wrestled him already to the ground oh you don't think that uh Christians should do that oh I'm a Christian I can't stop him no we're not that kind of Christian you got to defend the ministry physically and spiritually you also must defend the ministry right no side issues nothing let that you can't take anything from anywhere that would cast a light on Ministry in any way are you going to be in a desert you already have an oasis of water and then here comes a guy and he wants to throw mud in it he wants to throw poison in it you don't want that you want to keep that water flowing clear so you want to protect that Oasis that you can have the best use of it may God bless every one of you man woman boy girl every one of you support the man of God support the ministry as he carries the word remember this is all new and there's going to be a learning curve so but he's been with you for years yes but now he becomes the last word everybody's going to be hanging on every word every action and it's not as simple and easy as you think so pray pray pray for him pray for his family pray for his wife God will help her strengthen her in this hour keeper and I know why I'm saying it because they need it and the evil that they will have to face me no doubt will be even more than and more sophisticated than I face uh so there will need the spirit of Revelation the spirit of God to use them for his glory and honor God bless every one of you and I will send your regard and your thankfulness to the um organization that gifted us uh this past week God bless you take care the son of is Reve the seven seed says on the [Music] original the original [Music] see Mia we have sister Mia to come up and do a
