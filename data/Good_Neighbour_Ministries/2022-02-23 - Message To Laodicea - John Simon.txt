TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening everyone i'm here tonight by the grace of god and by his wonderful love that he has shown for us with a message called message to leo this year may the holy spirit bless us together as we delve into the word of god for this hour amen let us read out of the book of revelation chapter 3 verses 15 and 16. i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would the word cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth praise god that is the message of this word today gracious father we have read out of the holy bible thy book may the holy spirit draw near oh god hover above us around us move through us declare thyself in this hour and may you the great holy spirit be magnified and recognize lord in the going forth of the word of god we rest our faith in him in you lord we rest our everything in you and we come in the middle of the week father for refreshing to our hearts our lives and our walk in jesus christ to thee be the glory amen the message to lord this year is this nothing good has been spoken by the holy spirit in the word of god concerning this age of leodisia matter of fact we see god bringing two indictments and one pronouncement against this age of laodicea listen i know thy works thou art neither cold nor hot i would that thou art cold or hot so then because the word look warm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth god's word tells us plainly the legion church age is a lukewarm church age that is neither cold nor hot and this lukewarmness god is saying demands ledicia to pay a penalty for this wrong this evil that she has done certainly refrained the penalty god pronounces is that i will spit you i'll spew you out of my mouth many think because god says i'll spew thee out of my mouth they tried to apply that scripture to an individual but this scripture does not apply to an individual person uh to get the feeling that god never wants you god will never take you back god will never forgive you god will never cleanse you if you backslide you can't be restored no it doesn't say that when god says i will spew thee out of my mouth he is really speaking to the church as a whole that because the church has been lukewarm because the church has not paid attention to his word he s pronounces his judgment i will spew thee out of my mouth so here he is and we know according to the bible that we are nowhere like in the mouth of god certainly we know in god's mouth is his word and there my friends we as individual parts of him we are considered by the word amen that we are in the palms of his hands the bible tells us clearly i've got you in the palms of my hands and father i've not lost one that you have placed in my hand thank god for this eternal blessed assurance and security that we have in the lord jesus christ aren't you happy that you have this kind of blessed assurance in jesus christ amen the scriptures say also we are under the shelter of his wings oh the great eagle has spread the old and the new testament the great eagle has revealed or opened up the word and the word is spread above us protecting us guiding us guarding us and we are under the shadow of his wings oh thanks be to god who gave us the revelation of jesus christ hallelujah that we are under the his glorious marvelous wings of protection the bible again says we are in the bosom of god a man like a mother will hug her child close to herself like a father will put his arm over his boy's shoulder as they walk towards the creek to do some fishing or to talk uh just to be together god is saying oh i have you in my bosom i i have you close to my heart i i love you i care for you i am watching over you praise god hallelujah the bible further tells us that we are his sheep and we are in his sheepfold i'm so glad i'm in the sheepfold of the lord safe from all harm safe from the wild beasts safe from the the the walls that are out there safe in the tender care of this gentle shepherd i am so glad that the great shepherd stands across the doorway protecting his own and he says fear not you are in my sheepfold hallelujah he will protect us through this dark night that we are passing through but all my friends oh i tell you the night uh i tell you friends that that joy is coming in the morning weeping man door for the night troubles trials all kinds of lack and all kinds of ups and downs may come but weeping will only endure for the night but joy is coming in the morning oh hallelujah thanks be to god amen the bible tells us also we are in his mind for long before time began we were in his mind and we were a part of his plan oh praise god let no man let no person deny this or think otherwise but that we were in his eternal purpose and plans before time even began oh and we are the expression of what was in his heart and in his mind the bible tells us further we are in his posture he has placed us in a position where we can feed upon him the word safely and protected for we are not in some stranger's pasture we are not in some outsider pasture we are in his pasture and he watches over his own he watches over his sheep aren't you glad you're in the master's pasture in his sheepfold in his bosom in his mind oh thank god forevermore we are secure in christ hallelujah amen matthew 4 tells us clearly men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god so the word is supposed to be in our mouth aren't you glad that the word is supposed to be in our mouth oh praise god hallelujah now we know that the church is his body glory to god and what will then be in the mouth of that body nothing less than the word itself amen hallelujah first peter chapter 4 verse 11 if any man speak let him speak as the oracles or word of god ii peter chapter 1 verse 21 for prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spay as they were moved by the holy ghost hallelujah oh praise god so we can see in that light what's wrong with laodicea what's wrong with the laodicean church age what is wrong with the people today what is wrong with the church today the church has moved away from the word of god and she is speaking her own word she's not saying what her husband tells her to say or advises her to say but she is making up her own series theologizing analyzing debating and uh bringing all kinds of ideas of what she thinks from the word of god amen just gotten away from the word and they're no longer passionate about it but praise god the true seed of god is passionate fervent and on fire with the word of god hallelujah amen the baptist have their creeds in their darkness the methodists are have their creeds and their dogmas no water baptism only sprinkling sprinkling is good when the very bible tells us that when john baptized jesus our example he went down into the water and after john had baptized him in the water the bible says he came up out of the water oh praise god hallelujah may every one of us have the true baptism in water in the name of jesus christ according to the word of god the pentecostals also claim they have the word of god but give them the word test and see where they're really going to stand with that they'll sell you out in a minute they'll sell you out in seconds they'll sell you out for sensations rather than to hear the word of god being unveiled to their ears they prefer to have a sensation they enjoy having manifestations they enjoy having tongues they enjoy having signs and wonders oh they'll rejoice over that my friends i'm telling you what are we here the word of god has been effectively placed aside and not given the place of not only not prominence but preeminence over the church over the lives of the individuals that god may be glorified and the spirit of god might be lifted up and jesus might be seen this mighty one hallelujah and so they have sold out and put aside the word of god so god is saying you've put me aside i'll put you aside i i'll spew you out of my mouth i'll i'll separate i'll pull back my presence i'll take back my spirit from you and leave you in your delusions your fictions your fantasies and your cl that you're taking up with the charms of of this slick devil and you're caught up in his the coils of his lies oh my friends search yourself search your heart may the church of god in this last day receive the message to leodysia and turn back from once you are going and may the holy spirit of god appeal to the deep which crawls to the deep and the deep in you may respond back to the word of the living god hallelujah for seven of the seven church ages man has been found putting their word above the word of god we have one bible but they have written thousands and thousands of thousands of volumes yes sir thousands of them claiming that they are all the word of god when we know there is only one word of god amen hero israel the lord thy god is one lord amen yes but with all that he is still in the midst of his church calling and crying out to those that will hear his voice all praise the lord jesus christ hallelujah god promised in this last day this seventh church age this dark lodesian night filled with stifling darkness god promised that he would reveal himself by untrue a prophet of this last day oh praise god hallelujah oh revelation 10 7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god the puzzles the hard sayings the things that were misunderstood the clouds of darkness that were above the earth now above the word the sun rising of the sun will drive away the gloom will move back the darkness so that your eyes can behold the wonders of our king and the glory of our god hallelujah i want to thank god that after thousands of years god is and has vindicated himself by the sending of a 20th century prophet like the world has never seen before sent a man whom i believed to be william marian branham that preached the word of god without fear or favor one man like moses was against all egypt one man standing against all organizational systems all manner of religious so-called intellectuals yes sir or praise god and a world of religion just as they did to john the baptist of old elijah of old they have done the same thing to him all blackened his name they this tried to destroy his reputation try to mess with his message but you can't do it because it wasn't his message it is his message he may be gone but his message lives on that is spirit of his message has been transferred let the spirit of god transferred from jesus to the apostles that same spirit has transferred in this last day into a people of god for this age that there might be his vindication that he might be the one to be his reflection and that there may be evening lights shining like shining stars of the evening or praise god as a testimony that they are only parts of the word but they are here to reflect the glory of the risen christ amen hallelujah yes my brother i thank god that he sent a message hallelujah and he sent it by a god sent god vindicated prophet who was and you it was god's mouth peace amen and god used him hallelujah to be his mouth peace as declared by malachi 4 5 and 6. how he would turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers hallelujah he will bring back the elect bring back the elect of the last day amen and they no matter what others say they will listen and they will hear the voice of that vindicated prophet right many times brother branham said you heard me speak but that wasn't me that wasn't my voice that was him and it was he was exactly right for now that voice is testifying for himself for the glory of his word and of his person oh praise god that vindicated prophet prophesied and ordained by god to bring the elected back to the world and to set them in a position that they would have the the fullness of what paul had what the apostles had that would come to them again and repeat itself in its brilliance to them unsullied untarnished by the theological filth and the rotten uh ideas of man that has tried to infect and infiltrate the word of god but god said i will spew thee out of my mouth amen thank god you spewed all those things out of my mind i trust you spewed it all out of your mind out of your heart out of your life and that you can say actually i can see clearly now because the clouds the rain and the smoke is all gone and i can see jesus high and lifted up amen let us momentarily consider church history for god has manifested himself through his body so that his body could be his voice and could perform his will and fulfill his divine purpose thanks be to god hallelujah my friends consider how true the dark ages the word was almost lost during that period of time but god had already promised that he would send a prophet that would restore the word and so the holy spirit came to luta one of the most dedicated consecrated priests in the catholic church and raise him up as a a seed bed as a sprout of the word of god coming to life and breaking through the dirt that was all around him he broke through the dirt amen and lived what a life what a message what a gospel that just shall live by faith amen not indulgences not all manner of stations on the cross not by the burning of candles not by such uh traditions of man but just shall live by faith amen and after he did his work and spoke that part of the word then god sent luther who also was used of god to speak his part of the word not only are we to be saved but we must live a clean sanctified life so he preached holiness unto the lord without which no man woman child shall see the lord all certainly and god used him for a season and he was the word of god for his day and for his generation hallelujah and the people that took that revelation from him became the living epistles to be read and known of all men in their time and when those methodists failed in their duty and began to die spiritually my friends just look around the national the deen denominational landscape you will see the tombs the cemeteries the wreckage the the the empty buildings the torn down buildings buildings turned into bingo halls bar rooms gambling houses houses of prostitution because they hid not the voice of god but let me tell you god had and hands a message to judicial not from the mouth of the prophet back there but from the mouth of his bride in this hour and in this day in which we are living in oh thanks be to god so the nominal church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it has become its own mouthpiece each denomination speaking for itself and believing they have a great hand cough or they have a great hold of the truth of god's word but god has turned away from her and he is turning on her now amen and as he will confound her through the sermons through the messages through the truths that comes out to the mouth of his prophet contrary to what they were taking are believing it confounds them he will conf further confound them through the voice of his bride his voice coming through his bride will confound them it will become so uh troubling to them they don't understand what it is and what god is doing in this hour blessed be the name of the lord for the voice of god will be in her and she will speak but it will be god's voice speaking through her thanks be to god it's written in revelation 7 revelation the last chapter of revelation verse 17 spirit and the bride says come oh you can see it like that or you can see it like the spirit in the bride says come hallelujah and let him that is a thirst come drink from the waters of life freely and let the spirit of god begin to wash your sins away your unbelief away wash the all the dirt and all the tapes this the spots upon your your your robe may god's spirit wash it all away by the presence of the holy spirit praise god hallelujah oh i thank god in this hour as a minister of the gospel i do not have to try to convince to convert to persuade uh to turn anyone for he that hat and ears to hear he or her will here he that had an eyes to see will see so i i just need to present the word of god and the holy spirit of the living god will testify whether this be the truth or not oh blessed be his holy name god is crying out to this last age amen yes sir he's crying out to this edge saying yes you have the word you have more tracts more tapes more electronic means of distributing the gospel you have millions more of bibles everywhere but the real word you don't have you're missing that oh my brothers and my sisters all you're interested in is passing the word dividing the word debating the word having conferences about analyzing parts of the word and discussing these things instead of getting to know him the word or let him the word reveal or make known himself to you praise god forevermore oh they don't want it you're not interesting in that they don't they're not interesting and living the word but they will debate the word oh my god is saying yes you claim you love the word you love the bible you love jesus but you're neither cold nor hot you know it's the truth but you won't go out there and live it if you lived it god is saying i would praise you for that but when you simply take the word of the living god and you don't honor it you don't give it preeminence amen you don't give me glory and honor then that nauseates me that kind of worship nauseates him for you know not what or who you worship amen you're worshiping without our understanding without a revelation how can you worship like that blindly thinking that you can see when you cannot see and you do not know luke warm water is the worst thing that one can take hold of and try to drink it will just make you sick to the stomach amen and god has declared because you are neither cold nor hot i will spew you out of my mouth do you hear that nominal church do you hear that nominal church member do you hear that you who think oh i'm a good man i'm a good woman i'm a good person i did this i gave charity i do god said i'll spew you out of my mouth amen that tells me what how god must have felt just before noah's floods how he must have felt just before lot had to run for the mountains oh my friends back to the word oh god wants a church hear this message to lodesia god wants a church that is hot passionate about his word loves him not for his gifts not for his manifestations not for his pearls or his diamonds that he can give you but if god wants you to love him for himself amen and so he has passed sentence upon her she is no longer my mouthpiece to the world she will continue to maintain that she is but she is not for he has been spewed out of his mouth but thank god he still has a voice on the earth and among his people in this world what the bible tells us he has given his voice to his bride for the voice is in the bride even as we have been told according to the word of god hallelujah and friends as these wonderful lessons go forth of the church ages we will learn more and more about the voice of god that is now speaking in and through the bride for his glory and for his honor god bless us all tonight and may this massive lodesia rest upon our hearts may we meditate upon these things and may god's power to transform work within the inward parts of our being and change us from glory onto glory so that we will meet again in the presence of his eternal glory god bless you god bless you real good [Music] you
