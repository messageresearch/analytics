[15:27] uh tonight uh even uh you know better we
[15:31] have a special uh speaker with us where
[15:34] we know he doesn't know us. That's why I

[15:39] Lord does things sometimes with um
[15:42] ministers that he sends by. He listen,
[15:44] he doesn't know anything about you, but
[15:46] the Lord knows all about you tonight.

[15:50] in your heart. And I believe if you've
[15:53] come tonight with some expectation
[15:55] within your heart, then the Lord will
[15:57] speak to you and give you something that
[15:59] you'll leave here tonight and you'll
[16:01] say, "It was good to be in the house of
[16:04] the Lord." Amen. Praise God. With uh

[18:51] &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be your mist tonight.
[18:54] H I love you, Bron. I love you all.
[18:56] Yeah, Simon, by Daniel, I remember all
[19:00] of you. At least most of are familiar
[19:03] with me cuz it's not it's my first. It's
[19:05] about my third time of being here. So,
[19:07] I'm actually at home. Hallelujah. Amen.
[19:11] And I want to thank pastor Danny for
[19:13] giving opportunity to you know uh take
[19:16] the service tonight because I believe
[19:17] that every pastor always has a lot on
[19:21] his heart and mind to his church and so
[19:24] it's always a sacrifice for a pastor to
[19:28] let go of the service time to give to
[19:31] another pastor is a sacrifice and pastor
[19:33] Daniel I certainly appreciate that God
[19:35] richly bless you and I thank brother
[19:38] Simon also
[19:40] for the sweet transition that the Holy
[19:42] Ghost led this church up to. Are we
[19:44] thankful for the transition? Thank you
[19:46] for the sacrifice and for the maturity
[19:47] that you shown us. Pastor Simon, God
[19:49] richly bless you and all the sacrif you
[19:52] made also to follow brother Paul and and
[19:54] and the family to come all the way to
[19:57] Ghana to pick up a bride and who have to
[20:00] be the in-law for our brother Kofi. That
[20:03] was a sacrifice also. Thank you very
[20:05] much and I thank you for the church for
[20:07] the support that you gave Paul by
[20:10] brother Kofi and the family to help his
[20:12] son Paul to get a bride. Thank you all
[20:14] and God richly bless you all.
[20:16] Hallelujah. And so tonight um let's to
[20:19] be honest with you let me tell you the
[20:21] truth. I have nothing new to give you.
[20:23] Don't expect anything new for me. I have
[20:25] nothing new to give you. Jesus the same
[20:28] word of God I've been feeding all this
[20:29] year. Pastor Simon Fed this chair for
[20:31] many years with the word of God Daniel
[20:33] continue. I'm just just I'm just a
[20:36] liberal just going to add a little bit
[20:37] of it. The same food. Yeah. That I'm
[20:39] going to share. So don't expect anything
[20:41] new from me. Hallelujah. Amen. So let's
[20:45] pick our Bibles. Let's if you brought
[20:47] it, you know, let's projection help us
[20:49] to turn to second Peter chapter one and
[20:53] see what happen.
[20:58] Second Peter chapter one. Let's read
[20:59] from verse 5 to save some time.
[21:04] And beside this, giving all diligence,
[21:08] add to your faith virtue, and to virtue
[21:11] knowledge, and to knowledge temperance,
[21:14] and to temperance patience, and to
[21:16] patience godliness, and to godliness
[21:19] brotherly kindness, and to bar kindness
[21:22] charity. For if these things be in you,
[21:24] and abound, they make you that you shall
[21:27] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[21:29] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But
[21:31] he that lackth these things is blind and
[21:33] cannot see a far off and have forgotten
[21:36] that he was purged from his old sins.
[21:40] Amen.
[21:42] Let's take a second scripture which you
[21:43] help me to read and that will be in the
[21:45] second period. Still second Peter but
[21:47] chapter 3 now and moving reading from
[21:50] verse 18. So this one uh it says but
[21:53] grow in grace but do what?
[21:58] Do what?
[22:00] But do what?
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But grow in grace and the
[22:08] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[22:10] Christ. To him be glory both now and
[22:15] forever. Amen.
[22:17] Amen. And the last scripture, let's take
[22:20] it from um Hebrews 11:6.
[22:24] Bear without faith is impossible to
[22:26] please him. For he that cometh to God
[22:28] must believe that he is and that he's a
[22:31] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[22:34] him. And may the Lord add his blessings
[22:36] to read of his word as you also take the
[22:38] comfort of your seat. God bless you.
[22:41] Amen.
[22:48] All right. So tonight have a little
[22:50] message I want us to share together. We
[22:52] want to um just echo part of the prover
[22:55] message on the touch of a perfect man.
[22:58] It's a long message but just speaking
[23:00] just one part of it. We look at um faith
[23:04] is the foundation. Want to speak on this
[23:06] theme. Faith is the foundation. If we
[23:09] call it part A of the message of start
[23:11] of perfect men if time watching the time
[23:14] the time allows us we will probably add
[23:17] another virtue to it which will be
[23:19] virtue. So let's start. um what the
[23:23] prophet say about it. Let's start from
[23:25] one. Let's go to note one. In a message
[23:29] of prophet man, the prophet really laid
[23:31] the foundation for the message and he
[23:32] said look and this morning let's say
[23:35] this evening we want to speak on a
[23:37] subject or teach rather if we can
[23:41] building the living tabernacle.
[23:43] But it said building the living
[23:45] tabernacle of the living God's dwelling
[23:49] place the perfect man. the living
[23:53] tabernacle
[23:54] of the living God where he dwells.
[23:59] Hallelujah. So the message of Sep is a
[24:03] great message and deep rich message for
[24:06] for a prophet to take his time to teach
[24:09] us
[24:10] how to build the living God, the living
[24:14] tabernacle
[24:15] where God will dwell. So I think that we
[24:19] are privileged to have a prophet to
[24:21] teach us how to build a spiritual house,
[24:25] a spiritual tabernacle where God can
[24:28] dwell. Hallelujah. So let a few of his
[24:32] comments that the prophet mentioned
[24:34] let's move on to paragraph 31. see a
[24:36] message that's a key reference message
[24:40] 62 10:14 m the prophet man 31 said now
[24:45] we approaching the seven seals we have
[24:48] judgment the seven church ages and this
[24:51] is a message of teaching
[24:59] thank you pastor I appreciate
[25:06] And now approach the seven. We have just
[25:08] made the seven churchages. And this is a
[25:11] message on teaching that ties the man in
[25:16] the man that is going to be redeemed by
[25:19] the blood of the Lord Jesus. And it's
[25:22] going to be in that church age, that
[25:26] eternal church age at the end of the
[25:29] seals.
[25:31] Hallelujah.
[25:33] So it it's a it has to be a very rich
[25:35] teaching teaching us how God is going to
[25:40] redeem us by the blood of the lamp and
[25:43] that man that's going to go into that
[25:47] eternal church age that's going to how
[25:50] it's going to be like how that person
[25:51] can get in that's essence of the message
[25:54] that he brought the statue of a perfect
[25:56] man hallelujah and then he kept on give
[26:01] a lot of comment on it. Another point he
[26:04] said in 65
[26:07] or 62 62 rather they said look so today
[26:10] we are going to try to take that same
[26:12] key to unlock the way to become a
[26:15] virtuous Christian in the stature of God
[26:19] that and be a living tabernacle
[26:24] for the living God to dwell in
[26:28] that you and I will be the living
[26:31] tabernacle that the living God will
[26:34] dwell in
[26:36] &gt;&gt; but I'm going to teach you how to do
[26:37] that. How to build a house so we can get
[26:41] get to that point. Hallelujah. Here in
[26:44] 65
[26:46] message for said what is it
[26:50] God is condensing to his creation.
[26:53] God wants to be worshiped. The word God
[26:57] means object of worship. And is God
[27:00] trying to condition his people so he can
[27:04] get from them what he created them for?
[27:07] Then he makes an outstanding statement.
[27:10] He never made you to be something else
[27:13] besides a son and daughter of God. If
[27:18] you have missed that or being a son of
[27:20] God, you have missed the mark.
[27:24] The Lord created you to be his son, to
[27:28] be his daughter.
[27:31] Nothing else but just that. That you be
[27:34] a daughter of God. You be a son of God.
[27:37] But if you miss that one, you miss the
[27:40] mark of really being a son of God and
[27:42] reflecting as a son of God or miss being
[27:45] a daughter of God reflect at the door of
[27:46] God because you have missed the mark.
[27:50] Hallelujah. That's why he's going to
[27:52] teach us how not to miss the mark.
[27:55] Hallelujah.
[27:57] Amen. And then for the same message, he
[28:00] says that know how that God is in his
[28:04] church. The church is now supposed to
[28:08] taking the place of Christ carrying on
[28:11] his ministry.
[28:12] Hallelujah. So it's going to just talk
[28:15] about the individual son of God, that of
[28:17] God. Then talk about the church as a
[28:19] collective body as well and what does
[28:22] one of the church is where we ought to
[28:23] be by now we should be supposed to take
[28:25] the place of Christ carry on Christ
[28:29] ministry.
[28:31] So all this is going to come about by
[28:33] the teachings that he give us out of
[28:34] this message of the story of a perfect
[28:38] man. Hallelujah.
[28:40] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[28:45] So the first principle on this type of
[28:48] prophet men that we need to realize
[28:52] note three please that the most high
[28:56] does not dwell in temples made with
[28:59] hands.
[29:01] So yes, we we we there's termin
[29:06] where God dwells and all that which is
[29:08] going to teach us how to say look you
[29:10] need to first be reminded
[29:12] that the living God does not dwell in
[29:15] temples made with hands. Hallelujah.
[29:19] Praise the Lord. And so St. Paul talked
[29:22] about that in in in Acts 17 when he went
[29:25] to mass hills in Acts 17:2 says that
[29:29] then Paul stood in the midst of mass
[29:32] hills and said, "Ye men of Athens, I
[29:35] perceive that in all things ye are too
[29:37] superstitious."
[29:39] But as I passed by and beheld your
[29:41] devotions, I found an altar with this
[29:44] inscription to the unknown God. Whom
[29:48] therefore ye ignorantly worshiped, him I
[29:51] declare unto you.
[29:54] 24 God that made the world and all
[29:58] things therein,
[30:00] seeing that he is Lord of heaven and
[30:02] earth, dwelleth not in temples made with
[30:06] hands. Hallelujah. So St. Paul brought
[30:10] this truth out that the living God does
[30:13] not dwell in temples made with hands.
[30:16] Hallelujah.
[30:17] Steven also said it in Steven said
[30:19] earlier on in Acts chapter 6 chapter 7
[30:22] before Paul also echoed it. So in Acts
[30:25] chapter
[30:27] 6 talking about just that's a background
[30:29] to um what happened to Stephen and then
[30:33] uh we told in Acts 67 and the word of
[30:36] God increased and the number of the
[30:38] disciples multiply in Jerusalem greatly
[30:41] and a great company of the priests were
[30:43] obedient to the faith and Steven full of
[30:47] faith and power did great wonders and
[30:51] miracles among the people.
[30:54] Hallelujah. And by the way, just want to
[30:57] remind tonight the same call that was
[31:00] with Stephen to do great miracles and
[31:02] miracles is with us here right now.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So expect your miracle.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Expect the great wonders.
[31:12] Hallelujah. Cuz he's the same yesterday,
[31:14] today, and forever.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; And he's here with us. Hallelujah.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[31:22] let's see what Stephen said in
[31:26] verse um
[31:28] let's start from verse 9 Acts chapter 7
[31:31] let's go to seven and let's see what
[31:33] they accuse Stephen of and verse 10 and
[31:36] they were not able to resist the wisdom
[31:37] and the spirit by which he spake oh may
[31:40] the Lord grant us tonight the wisdom and
[31:43] the spirit that's in your heart
[31:46] hallelujah
[31:48] resist him such a wisdom of that he had
[31:52] that the the whole Gian and the
[31:54] Sanhindrance and all they were able to
[31:56] resist Stephen and that wisdom we ask
[31:59] that the Lord should grant unto us
[32:00] tonight as well in Jesus Christ's name.
[32:04] Amen.
[32:06] Then there man who said we have heard
[32:08] him speak blasphemous words against
[32:10] Moses and against God. So they accusing
[32:12] Steven of things he haven't done but
[32:14] they said he has spoke blasphe against
[32:16] the Moses against God. And then verse 12
[32:19] they said and they start the people and
[32:21] the elders and the scribes and came upon
[32:23] him and caught him and brought him to
[32:24] counsel and start false witnesses who
[32:27] said this man said not to speak but
[32:29] spoke words against the holy place and
[32:32] the law. So in reality they accused
[32:34] speak of four things. He spoke against
[32:36] Moses spoke against God speak against
[32:39] the holy place which was the church the
[32:42] tabernacle. Yeah. And they spoke against
[32:43] the law. Hallelujah. So after he has
[32:47] made his submission to them then in
[32:50] verse to save some time let's move up to
[32:53] verse um 47 or probably 46
[32:59] 46
[33:02] okay for we have 47 in script let's
[33:04] reference 47 that's I I cut it short for
[33:07] for us so but Solomon built him a house
[33:11] 48 how be it the most high dwellth not
[33:16] in temples made with hands.
[33:19] Hallelujah. I said a prophet, heaven is
[33:21] my throne and earth is my foottool. And
[33:24] what house will you build me says the
[33:27] Lord? Or what place is the place of my
[33:29] rest? Had not my hand made all these
[33:32] things. Hallelujah.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; So the principle foundation is that the
[33:37] most high God does not dwell in temples
[33:39] made with hands. and a prophet pick up
[33:42] this same scripture of acts 7 and echoed
[33:46] it in the same message we're looking at
[33:48] prophet man in paragraph 67 prophet
[33:51] talked about it said now we going to
[33:53] study his word Stephen said acts seven
[33:56] let me just read and prophet read it he
[33:59] started from verse 34 he read it and
[34:01] then read of course what we have read uh
[34:04] from the 47 prophet read it all and then
[34:08] uh so let me know the prophets were not
[34:11] words that prophet said he said my
[34:13] sermon build my house be the most high
[34:16] do I not in temple with hence as said
[34:18] the prophet heaven is my throne and
[34:20] earth my foot what has built me said the
[34:22] lord or what is the place of rest then
[34:25] paragraph 68 prophet asked on this is
[34:27] that now tabernacle is of course a place
[34:31] where we go to rest so remember that
[34:34] tabernacle is a place where we go to
[34:36] rest get freshness and so forth like
[34:39] resting from and so forth. Hallelujah.
[34:43] Praise the Lord. 69 said, "But what is
[34:46] tabernacle now?" A body. God taken in a
[34:50] body. So a tabernacle is a body. God
[34:55] tabernacle in a body.
[34:58] Hallelujah.
[35:00] Amen.
[35:02] So
[35:04] now the foundation leader, God doesn't
[35:05] dwell in a temp with hands. So what is
[35:08] next? Now if he doesn't dwell in a
[35:10] temple made with hands then he has to
[35:12] have a place to dwell. He has to build a
[35:15] house. And father tells us in the
[35:16] message
[35:18] paragraph 135 that's slide six.
[35:24] Now building a house you just put up
[35:27] your uprise and everything else but the
[35:30] wood and some of these carpenters and
[35:32] contractors here could tell us how you
[35:34] build your house. See, but I'm going to
[35:36] tell you how to build your spiritual
[35:39] house.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where God can dwell. He
[35:44] wants to dwell in you. He wants to make
[35:47] you like himself. He wants to be
[35:49] reflected or reflecting rather his
[35:52] being.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; That's an outstanding statement. Paul
[35:58] said God wants to dwell in you.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; He wants to dwell in me.
[36:05] Almighty God
[36:08] &gt;&gt; wants to dwell in you. What a privilege
[36:12] to have that the God of creation wants
[36:15] to dwell in you. Hallelujah. We got to
[36:19] take advantage of that that the almighty
[36:20] God dwell in us. He said Paul said he
[36:23] wants to dwell in you. He wants to dwell
[36:26] in me. He wants us to reflect his being
[36:31] &gt;&gt; that you as I sit down, you reflect the
[36:34] being of God.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; That as I stand here, I need to reflect
[36:38] the being of God. That's God's mind. The
[36:41] Bible said that this is his this is
[36:43] God's mind. That's what God wants to do.
[36:44] He wants to reflect himself in you and
[36:47] in me.
[36:49] Hallelujah. But to do that then to do
[36:52] that he has to build a spiritual house
[36:55] that he can dwell in that he can reflect
[36:57] himself in that spiritual house.
[37:00] Hallelujah.
[37:01] Amen. But how does it do it? So went on
[37:04] tell us about how it does it. He said in
[37:07] the old time uh the gold miners when
[37:09] they pick up the gold when they get up
[37:12] door comes with a lot of dust and all
[37:14] that. So they have to beat it, heat it
[37:15] by by fire, you know, beat it, beat it,
[37:18] beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, heat
[37:19] it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
[37:21] until finally they get the gold and they
[37:24] can see themselves reflected in the
[37:25] gold.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:29] Same thing. God picks you up from the
[37:31] mar clay. Yeah. And then he beats you by
[37:34] his word. He beats you by his word. And
[37:37] then sometime you think, oh, but who
[37:39] want to tell the preacher my story? Then
[37:41] the preacher tell my story. Nobody told
[37:43] the preacher. It is God just want to
[37:45] beat you by his word and bring
[37:47] conviction to your heart that you repent
[37:49] and that you know that he's the living
[37:51] God. He knows all your thoughts and all
[37:52] your heart and all all your challenges.
[37:54] He knows it.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; God beating his people by his word that
[37:59] he can make them himself be able to
[38:01] reflect him. Hallelujah. Just as a gold
[38:04] miner beats the gold beats it out until
[38:06] he can see himself fling in it.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's part of God's process
[38:12] of building his spiritual house that he
[38:14] can dwell in. Hallelujah.
[38:17] Amen. So if you ever came to church and
[38:20] you had a preacher saying something that
[38:22] concerns you, it's not because anyone
[38:25] have told him that. Nobody want to tell
[38:27] you report to to the to the pastor. The
[38:30] Holy Ghost knows you. God knows you. And
[38:33] the Holy Ghost want to correct you. God
[38:36] want to teach you. The ghost want direct
[38:38] you. And so the anointing of God comes
[38:41] to the pastor and preaches and teaches
[38:44] everything that nobody that going to
[38:45] report you. Nobody reported you. It is
[38:47] still part of God's process of you
[38:49] beating himself, beating all the death
[38:52] out of you and make able to reflect
[38:53] himself in you. Hallelujah.
[38:57] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[39:02] So
[39:04] if want to build a tabernacle then
[39:06] certainly there must be a foundation to
[39:07] that
[39:09] without foundation I mean our
[39:11] contractors would tell us said that us
[39:13] want to build a house this building has
[39:15] a foundation upon all this is standing
[39:17] and so there has to be a foundation if
[39:19] God wants to build a house there has to
[39:21] be a foundation so what the prophets say
[39:24] let's turn to let's go uh seven yeah
[39:27] just come skip the time to skip some of
[39:31] uh slides. Let's go to uh slide seven.
[39:35] Building goes through tabernacle begins
[39:38] with a foundation of faith. Hallelujah.
[39:42] Amen. Next slide.
[39:45] Notice the voice speaking now paragraph
[39:48] 102 of the same message the start of
[39:50] prophet man 62 10:14 m. Notice you must
[39:56] be born again. And when you are born
[39:58] again, you can't be born again without
[40:02] having faith. Hallelujah. You can't be
[40:05] born again without having faith. But you
[40:09] must be born again. That is right. So
[40:11] you see on my chart here, I don't have
[40:12] the chart here, but I'm sure you have an
[40:14] idea where the chart because our
[40:15] ministers have taught it time and again.
[40:17] So you know that chart. Hallelujah.
[40:21] He said,
[40:23] I got the very foundation.
[40:25] Faith is the foundation of all of it.
[40:29] Hallelujah. And in reality, that's why
[40:31] you speak on this subset of the message.
[40:34] Yeah. The subtitle like I told earlier
[40:35] on faith is the foundation. And that's
[40:39] said to to build the spiritual house of
[40:42] God. Paul said that faith is the
[40:45] foundation.
[40:47] It's the foundation of it all.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Faith is the found for
[40:51] without faith is impossible to please
[40:53] God. He that cometh to God must believe
[40:56] that he is and is a rewarder of those
[40:58] that diligently seek him. Faith is a
[41:02] foundation. Hallelujah. And when you are
[41:05] kept of the Bible, when you are scared
[41:08] of the word being right, test might as
[41:10] well stay back until first you believe
[41:12] it. Hallelujah.
[41:14] Faith is the foundation or the spiritual
[41:17] house that God wants to build to dwell
[41:20] in.
[41:22] Hallelujah. say that you must must be
[41:24] born again. In other words, if you are
[41:26] not born again, you have not started the
[41:28] the building at all. You've not started
[41:31] cuz you can't start a building without
[41:32] foundation. You want to start a building
[41:35] build this house. You have to have a
[41:37] foundation that you really started and
[41:40] but you have to be born again. And to be
[41:42] born again, you need faith to be able to
[41:44] be born again. And when you're born
[41:46] again, you have the faith for your
[41:47] foundation. Said you have just started.
[41:51] Hallelujah. You have just begun when you
[41:54] are born again. Praise the Lord.
[41:58] So what is faith will be a natural
[42:00] question to ask. What is faith? If faith
[42:03] the foundation then what is faith? If a
[42:06] prophet taught us what faith is in the
[42:08] next slide eight he said in the message
[42:12] another one at the end time 53 the
[42:15] prophet asked the same question. What is
[42:17] faith? Hallelujah. What is faith? Faith
[42:21] is something that's revealed to you that
[42:24] is not yet but you believe it will be.
[42:28] Faith is a revelation of the will of
[42:31] God. Hallelujah.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; What is faith? Faith is a revelation of
[42:37] the will of God.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you need this revelation
[42:41] to be born again. And when you are born
[42:43] again, you have this revelation.
[42:46] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[42:49] Hallelujah.
[42:51] And then in the message faith is a
[42:53] substance uh part of 19 C says my
[42:56] scripture lesson tonight said faith the
[42:59] substance of things hoped for the
[43:01] evidence of things not seen. See it's a
[43:05] substance. It's something direct
[43:07] something that you really have. Not
[43:09] something that you imagine or something
[43:12] that you just think you will have but
[43:13] it's something direct positive act that
[43:16] you have. You see what I mean? So faith
[43:19] is a substance. Faith is not an
[43:22] imagination. Faith is a revelation of
[43:24] the will of God. Hallelujah. That you
[43:27] get and when you get it, nobody can take
[43:29] that away from you. Hallelujah. No
[43:32] devil, nobody else can take it from you
[43:35] cuz it's a revelation
[43:37] &gt;&gt; of the will of God for you. Once you get
[43:40] it, nobody can take it from you.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And that's the
[43:44] foundation that you must have.
[43:47] Hallelujah. For for foundation of a
[43:49] spiritual house that God wants to build
[43:51] that's really forever for for for a
[43:53] foundation. Hallelujah.
[43:56] So if faith is so important to be the
[43:59] the the foundation then the question
[44:02] that we answer what are some of the
[44:04] characteristics of faith because faith
[44:06] has it own characteristics whether for
[44:09] you to see whether you really have faith
[44:11] or you don't have it is a character that
[44:13] will determine whether you have it or
[44:14] you don't have it. So let's take a few
[44:16] of the characters of faith
[44:21] first. How do you get faith is a
[44:23] question that also answered
[44:26] faith cometh by hearing? Hearing what?
[44:30] The word of God. Hallelujah. So that's
[44:33] in in the verse perseverance. A prophet
[44:35] taught us that in paragraph 37 said,
[44:37] "And faith cometh by hearing." Hearing
[44:39] what? The word of God. And that's Romans
[44:41] 10:17.
[44:43] Therefore, if this be the word of God,
[44:46] and it is, what it teaches, we can rest
[44:48] upon it. God cannot change. God must
[44:52] forever remain God. His word must be
[44:56] just as true in this age as it was in
[44:59] any age.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Faith comes by hearing. And
[45:06] the word of God can be trusted, can be
[45:08] relied upon. Hallelujah. If you hear it,
[45:11] please rely, believe it, rely upon it
[45:15] because it will do exactly what it say
[45:18] it it sent out to do. Hallelujah.
[45:21] Hallelujah.
[45:23] Architects of faith that
[45:26] but without faith it is impossible to
[45:30] please God.
[45:32] And that's Hebrews 11:6 say without
[45:34] faith is about to please him. For he
[45:37] that cometh to God must believe that he
[45:39] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[45:44] that diligently seek him. Hallelujah.
[45:48] He that cometh to God must have faith in
[45:50] God that God is God.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; God is.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; He said he must he is.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; He is what he a lot of St. Paul actually
[46:00] stopped short of trying to bring out
[46:02] characteris because honestly if he
[46:04] wanted to p that he wouldn't have
[46:05] finished writing the book of Hebrews.
[46:07] Hallelujah. Because what God is is deep
[46:10] and great. Hallelujah. So we just have
[46:13] to just pick just maybe three of that
[46:15] talk about three of that.
[46:18] You you must believe that he is he is
[46:20] what? He is God.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; If you come to God that further he is
[46:26] God.
[46:27] and and and and and sometimes people
[46:30] learn it the hard way that God is God.
[46:33] If you remember uh the ten commandments,
[46:36] yeah, which recommended for us to watch
[46:40] in the in in in the movie
[46:43] which the prophet really told us about
[46:45] what happened. Don't forget also that a
[46:47] prophet was a prophet and so he's able
[46:50] to see things that you do not see. The
[46:52] Lord to sins and scenarios which he to
[46:56] see to see. So sometime when make
[46:58] comments don't take it for granted.
[46:59] Yeah.
[47:01] In in in in the ten commandments movie
[47:06] a a pharaoh Ramsey's struggle all the
[47:10] struggle that he was struggling with
[47:11] Moses when Moses sent the message the
[47:13] word of the Lord that look the Lord have
[47:15] sent me said let my people go. When he
[47:18] was walking where you coming from I come
[47:19] from the kingdom of God. what for is
[47:22] what your message let my people go. And
[47:25] then he resisted that message that Moses
[47:28] brought from God. Let my people go. So
[47:32] all the the the plagues that were
[47:35] coming, it came as a result of the
[47:38] resistance of the word of God and the
[47:41] word of God. He was resisting,
[47:44] resisting, resisting, resisting.
[47:48] Finally, he let him go.
[47:51] And then he said he thought look we made
[47:52] a mistake. We should have let him go.
[47:55] But the wife was teasing him. The wife
[47:57] teased him so much he go and said no I
[47:58] have to go get these guys. So he
[48:01] organized I mean to chase Israel. Yeah.
[48:04] And then he chased them and he got to
[48:07] said when and then he he he he sat on
[48:10] his horse his chariot and he said ah the
[48:15] God of Moses is a poor general.
[48:18] How can he lead his people into this
[48:20] trap? Lead them into a place where
[48:23] there's a mant on the left, a man on the
[48:25] right, and the sea before them and have
[48:27] no place to go. And we are we have come
[48:30] with chariots. He said the god was is a
[48:33] poor general. That's his comment.
[48:38] Okay, but that wasn't the end of story.
[48:41] Eventually, we know the story. The Lord
[48:43] opened the Red Sea for his people, not
[48:47] for the Egyptians. Don't forget that.
[48:49] God didn't open the way for the
[48:51] Egyptian. He opened the recipe for his
[48:52] people.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; And then the family of God went through
[48:58] the the sea and then just about around
[49:02] probably midway or getting to end of it,
[49:05] the Egyptians are look, they have to
[49:07] chase them in the in the in the in the
[49:08] sea. And I remember if you look at the
[49:10] film, if you watch the film, Yeah. One
[49:13] of his commanders said, "No, no,
[49:14] Pharaoh, king, we don't have to go." And
[49:17] he said, "No, just he said, "No, I don't
[49:18] think we have to go. Look at this. It's
[49:20] amazing.
[49:21] So, don't let us go." He said, "No, go."
[49:23] And he commanded them to go. And then he
[49:25] went and then what happened? You see,
[49:29] the God that we serve is a real God.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; That's why he must know he is.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; He is God.
[49:38] the things that God wants to do for you,
[49:40] you have no idea.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Your little brains, our little brains
[49:45] usually minimizes, you know, what God
[49:48] can do for us. I tell you the truth. Let
[49:51] me give you a test to continue to to
[49:53] practice the point
[49:55] that I'm making.
[49:58] You see how this surgery here is a cut
[50:00] here is actually a surgery that I had in
[50:02] 2011.
[50:05] To cut a long story short, five years
[50:07] down the line when I started ministry in
[50:08] 2016, uh it's about four months down the
[50:11] line, I could feel a pain when I
[50:15] preaching
[50:17] and it's you feel a pain of a sharp
[50:19] something, you know, breaking pricking
[50:21] the the the flesh, breaking the the the
[50:22] the
[50:25] jaw right there.
[50:28] So I went to the hospital and then the
[50:32] doctor said do we go taking the X-ray I
[50:35] went for the X-rays brought it show to
[50:38] the light said what is this what is this
[50:43] I haven't seen some before
[50:45] apparently
[50:47] the metal yeah the titanium that have
[50:49] been fixed here to support my jaw was
[50:52] broken
[50:54] how it got broke no one knows
[50:58] But clearly it's in a ring form that the
[51:01] ring is here. It's been it's still
[51:02] there. It's still there on my jaw. It's
[51:04] been it's been fixed here is there. But
[51:06] it was broken.
[51:08] He said, "I haven't seen some of this
[51:10] before in all my career. I haven't seen
[51:12] this." And I know for a fact that the
[51:14] method is the best.
[51:17] So he said, "Daniel, you know what? Um,
[51:20] you go and give me time to think through
[51:22] because I don't know what to do for
[51:23] you."
[51:25] And they said you took a lot of hours to
[51:26] get this thing done for me. So I went
[51:29] home
[51:31] went home n by my bed. I said Lord
[51:35] your servant at the rich hospital
[51:38] Dr. Max J. He says that he doesn't know
[51:41] what to do for me. I know how to fix
[51:43] this for me. So father I pray that you
[51:46] please fix it for me. Hallelujah.
[51:51] You fix it for me. That was my prayer.
[51:54] Two weeks after
[51:56] then I became conscious that oh for a
[52:00] week
[52:01] I have not felt the pain.
[52:04] Oh so the after done is already and I I
[52:07] didn't even realize that it stopped. The
[52:09] preaching has stopped.
[52:11] My wife said by the way I came with my
[52:13] wife Sella. Yeah that's my wife. I came
[52:16] with her. Hallelujah.
[52:20] Yeah. She called I tell her our standing
[52:23] lady. Yeah. By the grace of God,
[52:26] she said, "Pick go to the hospital." I
[52:29] said, "I'm not going to go." He said,
[52:30] "No, go." I said, "Look, let me tell you
[52:33] the truth." That once I was blind, but
[52:36] now I see.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; If you are blind and you now see, do you
[52:41] need to see the the optician? Do you
[52:44] think you really have to see optician
[52:45] for seeing?
[52:47] You were blind. You were once blind and
[52:49] now you can't see. Do you have to go and
[52:51] see optician? What for?
[52:55] I said once I had a pain but now there's
[52:58] no pain. No need for me to see the the
[53:00] dentist.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; It's gone. So I didn't go. That was
[53:05] 2016.
[53:07] Then another five years after that,
[53:09] that's 2011, which is 10 years after the
[53:12] surgery now.
[53:14] I one day I found out there was a fluid
[53:15] coming out of where one of screws was
[53:17] cured. Yeah, there's a flu coming and it
[53:19] was very bad scented. Yeah. So I called
[53:22] my niece to a doctor in the UK and he
[53:24] said I should go and see a doctor and
[53:26] then he actually prescribed me to take
[53:28] some antibiotics. So I bought it and I
[53:31] start taking it and then I went to see a
[53:33] doctor. When I went he wasn't in he was
[53:36] in a theater but I met his goal doctors
[53:38] and they said okay let's let me examine.
[53:41] So I went to lie on the table and then
[53:44] um one of the doctor he examined me put
[53:46] everything there he said but your jaw is
[53:48] fine everything there is fine then the
[53:51] next doctor came al
[53:54] so everything's fine there said I
[53:56] thought your conservative is fine but
[53:58] you go and come early tomorrow morning
[54:00] come early because otherwise you'll miss
[54:02] out our boss but you going to get
[54:04] tomorrow too I said okay thank you
[54:06] doctors so I went home then the
[54:08] following day I name went very early to
[54:12] the hospital. Then I met the doctor.
[54:14] They said, "Oh yes, I was told that you
[54:15] were here yesterday." I said, "Yes." I
[54:16] said, "Okay, go and take a X-ray." For
[54:21] they have an X-ray in the hospital.
[54:22] Earlier I want have to go to another
[54:23] bigger hospital to refer us to go. But
[54:25] now they have the X-ray right there in
[54:27] the hospital. So I went to the X-ray
[54:29] room. I met a technician. Then I give a
[54:32] little history of what it told us. So he
[54:36] took the X-ray and then right on the
[54:39] screen you could see that
[54:42] the metal was all intact.
[54:46] Everything was intact. I said but
[54:48] everything's intact.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; I said so I I looked at said I said can
[54:52] I take a shot of say yes do that. So I
[54:54] took a shot of that and then when I left
[54:56] the X-ray room and I got to the
[55:00] consulting room where doctor was here he
[55:02] was shouting this is a miracle. This is
[55:06] a miracle. Ah this this had to be God.
[55:09] This is a miracle. There has to be God.
[55:12] Why? Because he knew very well and he
[55:15] must well that the metal was broken 5
[55:18] years ago
[55:20] but now the metal is intact.
[55:23] entered. Remember, not bone.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; It wasn't bone that was broken. It was
[55:30] metal.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Titanium that was broken. 2016, 21, it
[55:36] was interface nothing.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine?
[55:42] But almighty God, we say, "Brother,
[55:46] he that cometh God, he is
[55:49] &gt;&gt; he's God."
[55:51] back to where we were in Exodus where
[55:53] Pharaoh decided to chase his people. So
[55:57] what happened? So in my story, the Lord
[56:00] became my dentist. Don't forget that. He
[56:02] became my dentist to fix the my my my
[56:05] job for me.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; And that's why he is he is everything to
[56:10] us.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; He's everything to us.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; In time of need, he he will show himself
[56:17] as what ought to be for you. In the
[56:20] story of of Moses in the story so they
[56:23] went rescy and decide become a
[56:26] vulcanizer. How many know vulcanizers
[56:28] the the the the technicians who work
[56:31] with ties? Yeah. If you have a lorry tie
[56:33] you go they remove the t that's vanizer.
[56:37] The lord became a v organizer and the
[56:40] chariots of the Egyptians that decided
[56:43] removing the ties one by one. Removing
[56:45] the ties the chariots of the ties. They
[56:47] run. By the time they realize they were
[56:50] all swimming in the Red Sea. Hallelujah.
[56:53] And then the Rammeses goes back to the
[56:56] palace, goes home,
[56:59] met the wife before he left the palace
[57:01] to go chase Israel. They said, "I'm
[57:04] going I and I'll kill I'll come. When I
[57:06] come, I'll kill you." That's why he told
[57:08] the wife, I'm going to kill you. Kill
[57:09] the nefari. He said, "Before but before
[57:12] I come, make sure you kill Moses first
[57:14] and bring his blood and come and kill
[57:16] me.
[57:17] So after all that he he came back now
[57:21] stood there in the palace. He he first
[57:24] he drew the sword to kill Neferti. He
[57:27] said before you kill me show me the
[57:30] blood of Moses. Show me his blood.
[57:34] Then his hands got weak and the software
[57:36] from his hands. And then hands said his
[57:41] God is God.
[57:45] All the resistant are resistance just to
[57:48] say that Moses God is God and that was
[57:50] the problem by the end the L the go that
[57:54] God is God
[57:57] &gt;&gt; and you might believe that God is God.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:02] And what you believe him for is what he
[58:04] does for you. If you believe him to be a
[58:07] dentist, he will work do the work for
[58:09] dentist for you. Believe the
[58:11] gynecologist work for you. when they are
[58:13] filled I'm not say don't we should
[58:15] contact them as well but where join them
[58:18] he does that for you hallelujah God is
[58:22] God hallelujah
[58:24] he's l Elohim the self-existing one yeah
[58:28] but now as a certain point he decided to
[58:31] be to make himself known to us
[58:34] and the course of history I had a friend
[58:36] call Abraham our father
[58:40] and when he called him Abraham in um uh
[58:43] uh chapter
[58:45] 17 of of of Genesis.
[58:48] So, and when Abraham was 90 years old at
[58:51] nine, the Lord appeared to Abraham and
[58:54] said to him, I am the Lord. I am the
[58:56] Almighty God. Walk before me and be thou
[59:00] perfect. Hallelujah.
[59:03] Walk before me and be thou perfect.
[59:06] Hallelujah.
[59:08] So
[59:10] that's how reveal himself to to to to
[59:12] our father Abraham
[59:14] and then almighty God like we know Paul
[59:17] told us that it means El Shadai the
[59:19] breasted one
[59:22] the God who has double breast the
[59:25] breasted one like a mother to feed his
[59:28] children and tonight he wants us to us
[59:30] to feed on him remember that he's he's a
[59:32] blessed one all that we need he's here
[59:36] to give
[59:38] Draw your strength from me. I'm the
[59:39] strength giver. El Shai. Remember, he's
[59:42] a strength giver. In your weakness, in
[59:45] time of weakness, remember the Lord is a
[59:47] strength giver.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; He's El Shai.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The strength giver, the
[59:54] almighty God. Hallelujah.
[59:57] And then when he appeared unto Moses
[1:00:01] in Exodus,
[1:00:03] he reveals himself to Moses in another
[1:00:06] way. And it's according chapter 6. Let's
[1:00:09] read that quickly. Then the Lord said to
[1:00:12] Moses, "Now shall say what I will do to
[1:00:15] Pharaoh. For with a strong hand shall he
[1:00:18] let him go, and with a strong hand shall
[1:00:20] he drive them out of his land." And God
[1:00:23] spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I
[1:00:26] am the Lord. I appeared unto Abraham,
[1:00:30] unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by the name
[1:00:33] of God Almighty.
[1:00:36] But by my name Jehovah, was I not known
[1:00:39] to them.
[1:00:42] Abraham didn't know that God's name is
[1:00:45] called Jehovah.
[1:00:47] God did not reveal it to him. He didn't
[1:00:49] reveal it to Abraham. He didn't reveal
[1:00:51] it to Isaac. He didn't reveal to Jacob.
[1:00:53] He didn't reveal to Levi to Amram. He
[1:00:56] didn't reveal to all of them said by my
[1:00:58] name Jehovah. I he don't reveal it to
[1:01:02] them. Why did he even himself name
[1:01:05] Moses? Because Jehovah means the God who
[1:01:09] lives with his family.
[1:01:11] And God's family was locked up in Egypt.
[1:01:15] So he's going to send Moses to go and
[1:01:17] lead and bring his family out of Egypt.
[1:01:21] So remember he's Jehovah. He's a God who
[1:01:24] lives his family. God lives with you
[1:01:27] with your family. He's a God who lives
[1:01:30] his family. That's why he's called
[1:01:32] Jehovah. Hallelujah.
[1:01:35] Amen. So continue with the faith. What
[1:01:40] is faith? We've told us a revelation of
[1:01:42] the will of God. But why should they
[1:01:44] have faith?
[1:01:47] Move on the next diet loving a please
[1:01:49] woman.
[1:01:51] Faith leads to the path of obedience.
[1:01:55] Hallelujah.
[1:01:57] No, please just go to Yes. Yes. No,
[1:02:01] please go back for me. Stay with that
[1:02:02] where you were 10.
[1:02:04] Let's talk about that.
[1:02:07] In a message f prophet men 8 said faith
[1:02:11] does the rest. And we need to understand
[1:02:13] why prophet says so.
[1:02:16] one said,
[1:02:18] "And now faith does the rest of it."
[1:02:21] Faith does the rest. So you must have
[1:02:24] faith for a foundation.
[1:02:27] All Christianity.
[1:02:29] All you are,
[1:02:32] all you will ever be is based upon faith
[1:02:35] in the word.
[1:02:38] with us quoting
[1:02:40] that you must have faith for a
[1:02:43] foundation.
[1:02:45] All Christianity,
[1:02:48] all you are, all you will ever be is
[1:02:53] based upon faith in the word.
[1:02:56] That's the reason I believe the word. So
[1:02:59] we must believe the word because your
[1:03:02] present and your future is still based
[1:03:05] on faith.
[1:03:07] your present as a Christian and your
[1:03:10] future as a Christian is based on
[1:03:12] believing in the word of God. Having
[1:03:14] faith in the word that's what it is
[1:03:17] brothers and sisters and we have to have
[1:03:18] faith in God's word because that's what
[1:03:21] it is. Faith does the rest of faith does
[1:03:25] the rest of it. Get the faith as your
[1:03:28] foundation. Faith will do the rest for
[1:03:29] you. Hallelujah.
[1:03:32] Amen.
[1:03:35] Faith
[1:03:37] leads to the path of obedience.
[1:03:40] If you have faith and you don't obey
[1:03:43] God's word, I'm sorry for you. You
[1:03:45] really don't have faith because faith
[1:03:48] leads to a part of obedience. That's why
[1:03:50] prophet told us in the message why
[1:03:52] Christ speak
[1:03:54] 173
[1:03:56] said faith led Moses to the path of
[1:03:58] obedience. Hallelujah. Faith leads to
[1:04:03] the path of obedience. If you have
[1:04:05] faith, you obey God's word.
[1:04:08] That's what it is.
[1:04:10] That's what it is. If you have faith in
[1:04:13] God's word, you obey it. The fact that
[1:04:16] you are disobeying God means that don't
[1:04:18] have it. The faith, if you fa, you obey
[1:04:20] it. So, Moses have faith in God's word.
[1:04:25] When the Lord met her back out of the
[1:04:27] desert and said look introduce him to
[1:04:29] him and said look I have not even I to
[1:04:32] your fathers are Jehovah but I'm tell
[1:04:35] Moses trust me believe it I'm Jehovah
[1:04:37] I'm sending you to Egypt to go and
[1:04:39] people out Moses believed in this god
[1:04:42] and I kind of and so Moses went to Egypt
[1:04:46] in obedience to God's command for him
[1:04:49] because he had faith in what God had
[1:04:51] said so faith led Moses to the path of
[1:04:55] obedience
[1:04:56] Hallelujah.
[1:04:57] Now notice what said this is a young
[1:04:59] pharaoh. There's young Moses. Both of
[1:05:01] them with opportunity. Moses in the
[1:05:03] report of a people encountered it
[1:05:05] greater pleasure than all Egypt. And he
[1:05:07] led and he led by faith. He followed
[1:05:10] what faith said in the word and it led
[1:05:14] him to the path of obedience.
[1:05:16] So faith will lead you to the path of
[1:05:18] obedience.
[1:05:20] And finally, glory, immortal, never to
[1:05:24] die in the presence of God. Hallelujah.
[1:05:28] So that's what faith does. Faith leads
[1:05:31] us into the path of obedience. Let's see
[1:05:34] what faith did to our father Abraham
[1:05:35] too. Faith in the word led to the path
[1:05:39] of obedience our father Abraham. So
[1:05:42] remember in the mind story of Abraham in
[1:05:44] Genesis 22 when the Lord came to him
[1:05:46] said now it came to pass after these
[1:05:48] things that God tested Abraham and said
[1:05:50] Abraham and said here I am and he said
[1:05:53] take not your son your your only son
[1:05:55] Isaac whom you love and go to the land
[1:05:57] of Moriah and there as a burnt offering
[1:06:00] as on one of the mountains which I of
[1:06:02] which I shall tell you.
[1:06:04] So Abraham
[1:06:06] rose early in the morning and saw his
[1:06:08] donkey and took two of his young men
[1:06:10] with him and Isaac his son and he split
[1:06:13] the wood for the bent o offering and
[1:06:16] arose and went to a place of which God
[1:06:18] had told him. Now the question is why do
[1:06:22] you think Abraham woke up early in the
[1:06:23] morning and called two of his servants
[1:06:26] and Isaac let's go and do the firewood
[1:06:30] let's go
[1:06:31] because Abraham had faith in what God
[1:06:35] have told him he had faith in God faith
[1:06:38] in God's word and therefore it led him
[1:06:40] to obedience
[1:06:42] obedience so calling his son awake the
[1:06:46] Bible say early in the morning
[1:06:49] but before The son actually said the son
[1:06:51] son rose guys let's go because that was
[1:06:55] faith that he had in this god
[1:06:58] that spoke to him and therefore it led
[1:07:01] him to obedience to what god have said
[1:07:04] that's what faith does if you believe
[1:07:07] God's word you obey it faith leads to
[1:07:10] the path of obedience hallelujah
[1:07:13] amen
[1:07:15] praise the lord
[1:07:18] let's keep that
[1:07:20] go to 12 now the context of faith
[1:07:24] faith in the word knows no fear.
[1:07:27] Hallelujah.
[1:07:29] So when Moses got to Egypt
[1:07:34] you know and this here is Pharaoh and
[1:07:37] Egypt was a great you know it was the
[1:07:40] greatest nation in the world at the
[1:07:41] time. But
[1:07:44] did did Moses fear a Pharaoh? Not at
[1:07:47] all. So in the mercy why Christ
[1:07:49] paragraph 176
[1:07:51] said Moses with his faith did not did
[1:07:54] did never did fear Pharaoh.
[1:07:57] Moses with his faith that he have in God
[1:08:01] he never feared Pharaoh because faith in
[1:08:04] God's word would drive away fear. In
[1:08:08] fact the two do not live together. Faith
[1:08:09] and and and and and and fear they don't
[1:08:12] live together. They don't not at all.
[1:08:14] They are not twins. They are not
[1:08:16] neighbors. They don't live together.
[1:08:17] They're not friends. They don't live
[1:08:19] together. It's either faith or fear.
[1:08:23] But if you have faith, you don't fear.
[1:08:26] It drives away fear from you.
[1:08:27] Hallelujah. You don't fear what the
[1:08:29] devil can do because the God who is in
[1:08:31] you is bigger and greater than the world
[1:08:34] the devil that's in the world.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; That's why there's no cause for you to
[1:08:38] fear. Have faith in God. Believe him and
[1:08:41] cast away all your fears.
[1:08:43] The God is in you is greater than the
[1:08:45] devil that's in the world. Have faith in
[1:08:47] God. Hallelujah. So fear faith mostly
[1:08:51] did not have you know fear
[1:08:55] Pharaoh and didn't in 177
[1:08:59] there's no fear in faith. That's a
[1:09:01] speaking. There is no fear in faith.
[1:09:05] Faith knows about faith. Faith as I
[1:09:08] always said is got great big muscles and
[1:09:11] hairs on the chest. Hallelujah. That's
[1:09:14] what faith is. Faith has got big
[1:09:15] muscles. Yeah. And hairs on the chest.
[1:09:18] 179. It said, "Notice Moses never feared
[1:09:22] Pharaoh after God have beenated his
[1:09:25] call. When Moses believe he was called
[1:09:27] for that, but when God told him him up
[1:09:30] there, it so and come down and show
[1:09:33] before Pharaoh and all the rest of them
[1:09:35] that he was sent to do it." Moses never
[1:09:39] was scared of Pharaoh.
[1:09:42] If you have faith, you're not scared of
[1:09:44] Pharaoh. You're not scared of any any
[1:09:46] man. Have faith in God. Hallelujah.
[1:09:52] Faith knows no fear. Oh, let's I didn't
[1:09:55] my time is going, but let's talk about
[1:09:57] this one. The other example of Shadrach,
[1:10:00] me. You know, faith in the word knows no
[1:10:03] fear. Because remember Moses had earlier
[1:10:06] on given a commandment in Exodus chapter
[1:10:08] 20. Uh verse three says, "Thou shalt
[1:10:10] have no other gods before me. Thou shall
[1:10:13] not make unto me any given image or
[1:10:15] likeness of anything that is heaven
[1:10:17] above or that is in the earth beneath
[1:10:19] and that is in the earth and and in the
[1:10:21] water and earth." Five, thou shall not
[1:10:24] bow down thyself to them, nor serve
[1:10:27] them. For I I am for I the Lord thy God
[1:10:30] am a jealous God. Hallelujah.
[1:10:34] Moses wrote this story way back in
[1:10:35] Exodus hundreds of years after here
[1:10:38] comes three young Hebrew children
[1:10:42] whilst they were in exile and the king
[1:10:44] makes you know an image everybody should
[1:10:46] bow
[1:10:48] remember
[1:10:49] faith in God's word knows no fear
[1:10:52] so the king came and said guys if if if
[1:10:57] you would just I let them play the flute
[1:10:59] and if you just bow a little that should
[1:11:01] be fine with me I all accusations that
[1:11:04] we accused of. I will just write it off.
[1:11:05] I will just let it go. I pardon you of
[1:11:07] that.
[1:11:09] So, and the and the guy said, "Look,
[1:11:12] King, oh king, we just want to tell you
[1:11:15] this. Our God is able to deliver us from
[1:11:17] your your fire anyway, but even if he
[1:11:19] doesn't do that, we want to tell you to
[1:11:21] your face. We shall not bow today. We
[1:11:24] shall not bow tomorrow."
[1:11:26] He said he said he get
[1:11:29] he get over he seven times thinking by
[1:11:32] saying that get over here seven times is
[1:11:35] to put fear in them. Yeah. Because why
[1:11:38] you hit it seven times. He said he seven
[1:11:40] times but I think saying that seven will
[1:11:43] put fear in the people they have faith
[1:11:44] in God's word and therefore they have no
[1:11:47] fear because faith in God and his word
[1:11:51] knows no fear.
[1:11:53] So no matter how the the king wanted to
[1:11:56] put fear in there, they did no fear.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Eventually they were cast into the fire
[1:12:02] and then the king left. He said and I'm
[1:12:06] sure when they said you foolish boys,
[1:12:08] you will see who is who. So he left
[1:12:13] went took his lunch and then came back.
[1:12:17] So when he came back, it's recorded in
[1:12:19] in excel of Daniel chapter 3. Let's read
[1:12:23] a little bit more.
[1:12:27] Let's go. Um
[1:12:32] let's get scripture for it
[1:12:35] in Daniel chapter 3. So he came back.
[1:12:38] Let's let's let's
[1:12:41] start from uh let's start from verse 22.
[1:12:46] Next slide. I've just I'm trying to save
[1:12:49] my time. So I'm move on to the next. I
[1:12:51] think we are in 12 13B. Go to 13B for
[1:12:54] me. We have scripture there. I put some
[1:12:56] scripture down.
[1:12:58] Yeah.
[1:13:01] There was a book
[1:13:04] full of full of full of fury and and and
[1:13:07] form of and for his visage was was
[1:13:10] changed against the three men. There was
[1:13:13] a commanded that they should they should
[1:13:14] heat the furnace seven times more
[1:13:18] than it was heeded. So just go down and
[1:13:20] then 25
[1:13:24] I want to say my time. So 24 let's start
[1:13:26] on 24 now what it says there.
[1:13:30] Then Nebuchadnezzar was astonished
[1:13:34] and rose up in haste and spake and said
[1:13:38] unto his counselors, "Did not we cast
[1:13:41] three men bound in the midst of the
[1:13:43] ferry?" He's asking his counselors, "Did
[1:13:46] you not bound three people in the
[1:13:47] ferry?" And the counelor said, "Oh,
[1:13:50] king, your eyesight is perfect. Your
[1:13:53] memory is right. We actually bound three
[1:13:56] people. You're absolutely right, king."
[1:13:59] And the king said,
[1:14:03] they answered and said the king, "True,
[1:14:04] oh king." He said, I said, "Lo, I see
[1:14:08] four men lose."
[1:14:10] Oh, three men bound, four men lose.
[1:14:15] Hallelujah.
[1:14:16] He said, "Did you not say, did you not
[1:14:18] cast three men bound?"
[1:14:22] That was his memory. They said, "Ke, you
[1:14:24] are right. Your memory is right. It was
[1:14:26] three men bound." But I said, "No, but I
[1:14:28] see four men lose."
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; That's what our Lord can do. No matter
[1:14:35] what the devil tries to do to us, we
[1:14:37] have a God who is able to lose us from
[1:14:39] everything.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:44] Remember loose. So have faith in God.
[1:14:48] Don't fear. Cast away all fears.
[1:14:51] Hallelujah. Paul said faith has no
[1:14:54] reason. Faith has no reason. And I want
[1:14:56] to just run very quickly now because we
[1:14:58] have barely time to close. I'm not going
[1:15:00] to give you the quotations I probably
[1:15:03] give you but not me not read it. And the
[1:15:05] message start 186 prophet said faith has
[1:15:09] no reasoning. Hallelujah. And then
[1:15:12] another message with prophet preaching
[1:15:15] the message perseverance 63 0113e
[1:15:20] that faith has no hindrance. So don't
[1:15:24] forget that faith has no reason. Faith
[1:15:26] has no hindrance. Hallelujah.
[1:15:29] And I give example of the great senician
[1:15:32] woman. She had a lot of hindrances but
[1:15:34] her faith knew no hindrance because
[1:15:36] faith knows no hindrance.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:41] Faith knows no defeat.
[1:15:43] So, so prophet talked about in the same
[1:15:46] message perseverance talk about the same
[1:15:47] Greek reference sufficient woman that
[1:15:50] her faith knows no defeat because faith
[1:15:52] knows no defeat. Hallelujah.
[1:15:55] That's part of characters of faith.
[1:15:58] Faith knows no shock. Hallelujah. Don't
[1:16:00] forget that faith knows no shock because
[1:16:02] the Greek was was supposed to be
[1:16:04] shocked. He has heard of Jesus and what
[1:16:07] he can do. He has trusted him and
[1:16:09] traveled all the way to get to Jesus.
[1:16:12] Remember the disciples tried to restrain
[1:16:14] him. Oh no, you don't have to see me. Oh
[1:16:16] Jesus, get this woman. I was shouting. B
[1:16:18] was shout no. He he was able to push his
[1:16:21] way through until he caught attention of
[1:16:23] Jesus and he said, "Oh, but woman, I
[1:16:25] also even sent to you. You you your
[1:16:28] tribe, your relations, your people are
[1:16:29] just dogs."
[1:16:33] Said that you should have been shocked
[1:16:34] by that. Is is that how you are? with
[1:16:38] all the good I had about you with Jesus
[1:16:40] and you tell me that I was not sent to
[1:16:42] you dogs
[1:16:44] said that faith knows no shock
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; he wasn't shocked by that because faith
[1:16:50] knows no defeat
[1:16:52] hallelujah
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; he persisted faith to make you persist
[1:16:57] and he got what he looking for he got
[1:16:59] healing for a daughter hallelujah faith
[1:17:03] knows no shock faith is a victory that
[1:17:06] overcomes every curse of the devil.
[1:17:08] Hallelujah. I like this one. 19. That's
[1:17:12] where we are now. Faith is our victory.
[1:17:14] It's a message from page 58 104
[1:17:18] paragraph 64.
[1:17:20] And faith is a victory that overcomes
[1:17:23] every curse of the devil. Hallelujah.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Faith is a victory that overcomes every
[1:17:32] curse of the devil.
[1:17:34] You must have faith in God.
[1:17:37] Hallelujah.
[1:17:39] Faith is a conqueror. Proverb 52. Next
[1:17:43] slide. Faith is a conqueror. Faith is an
[1:17:47] overcomer. It isn't just a peacemaker.
[1:17:50] It overcomes.
[1:17:52] Faith is a victory that overcomes the
[1:17:54] world. Hallelujah.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:18:00] And from what went on again said faith
[1:18:02] is a victory. Pro 59. And let's read
[1:18:04] slide 21. Probably we have to close on
[1:18:07] that. It's now 8:45. Our time is up. So
[1:18:10] let's look at the read last one. Faith
[1:18:13] is a victory over death in paragraph 59.
[1:18:18] It reads, "Did not I tell you not to
[1:18:21] doubt?" He said to Gyros that night and
[1:18:24] on that day or that day, if you only
[1:18:27] believe, you can see the glory of God.
[1:18:30] Hallelujah. And in the church, if you
[1:18:32] only believe, you will see the glory of
[1:18:34] God.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Faith overcomes death.
[1:18:39] Faith is the victory over death.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Faith is the victory over sin.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Faith is the victory over sickness.
[1:18:47] Faith the victory over worry.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Faith the victory over frustrations.
[1:18:51] Faith the victory over the world.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Faith overcomes every curse of the
[1:18:58] devil.
[1:18:59] Hallelujah.
[1:19:01] Praise the Lord. Our time is up. Let me
[1:19:04] outside. Let's sing a song.
[1:19:08] Let's sing one song and then we can pray
[1:19:11] cuz our time is up. Musicians, please

[1:19:54] of our Christian life. is the foundation
[1:19:57] of the spiritual house that God's
[1:19:59] supposed to dwell in.

[1:27:19] in the body of Christ. That God himself
[1:27:23] is going to create that perfect body.
[1:27:28] He's going to fill that body. All those
[1:27:31] virtues, it's not your virtues. It's not
