========================================
for the grace of God we're no better than anybody else there's nobody better in here than anybody else there's good businessman there's lousy businessman there's good new years there's auntie cleaners just using examples right here it is what it is but that attribute God cannot be compared to you can't compare that that's because God a lot of the love procreation to create human beings that would live in this dimension have a soul have a soul have an intelligence have a part of mine have the ability to recognize to see to hear to do to walk into all those things but one thing behold I show you we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed you see that's divine revelation that's something that only God can give you that mystery of what he wrote in his worthless what's inspired behind his word that is something that you cannot give to somebody God gives it to them God gives them that awakening God get from that eye opening experience where they say I see so you mean I wasn't baptized oh my goodness I was baptized as a baby I didn't repent baby can't repent you mean I gotta be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus I gotta be immersed into that water I gotta be dead to my look like I gotta be very that's what it represents that's why it when an atom an individual catches out their life changes they realize oh my goodness I'm not covering God's provided way because God's Word cannot lie but and if I say that Nevada need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I got baptized as a baby and I turn around and I say that I stand to that I'm actually rebelling against the Word of God because God can try God is the same yesterday today and brown so for some of the I don't care how sincere you where I gave millions I don't care [Music] exactly you really give it back to God when he gave you but one thing that God loves and God is pleased by is when an individual catches his word and says repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus I'm just use knives accepted because you're honoring his word and be baptized that anymore you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and that's what washes you that's what makes you a son or daughter of God that's what places you and identifies you with the word of God if you see but mrs. simple teaching and I'm just here to as an attempt to show you how the world they can claim Christianity at all Trump he's the man that God has chosen he's the love that that's going to lead us and guide us and all of a sudden the Word of God doesn't need much anymore they go up to the mizane have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe I see you're believing I see that you're doing you're claiming Christ you're cleaning Christianity I see you go to church there by Sunday I seen you do a dissolute I know that's good but how do we see the Holy Ghost because if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you it will quicken your mortal body out of this dimension and away from Armageddon that's kind of there's going to be a great tribulation it's going to strike the land we're going to 1,000 years of peace but before that there's going to be three and a half years of hell oh boy nobody's going to be put the movies you know my views everything's calm right now is cool everybody's happy you know it's all good but you know that can one that can change and one more definite change my I'm 680news we just heard this is what's making news this morning California apparently has had a huge earthquake and they apparently made there's no communication and we just heard that the Canadian Armed Forces I've just said some CIA teams over there to see what's going on we'll keep you up to date 10 minutes later guess what they can't even find telephone they're all right they swear the rover in third grade art oscillator over it but the land is done that's a prophecy since I cannot change that prophecy God brought it to a profit in this twentieth century said thus saith the Lord California is going to sink every everything he said came to pass yeah we can't change that we can't do anything to change that that's just a word of it amen glory to god bless the Lord Jesus let's move on so where are we now next slide because it's important for us to realize you don't have to pick up these images you know some brothers in the message now look at them and I think Bob it's good there's you know there's some really good information in there and you know we need to realize what God has done in our day and we're we're and we need to see that you know we know that the rap is going to be an event and it's an event that's in progress right now but yet when it culminates it will be over and you become and that would be the interpretation of the rapture that begging of you are supposed to show up at work you're not going to show up your bosses goes oh I guess it said she said two days three days four days all of a sudden one of the other employees comes up and says you know what they can't find him or her anywhere and all they would talk to me about when they would sit down and we would talk a little god was that they were going to go to match one of these days States I know some of you know people in a go boy you know I got so much life to still live I don't know this is Raptor dunno like would have to do this one and I got kids I want to have I got things same old wood board I tell my kids because sometimes they bring up that I tell listen let me tell you what a bit when you get there you not be too concerned about go back that's a prop I don't stop to see right now I know it's a little difficult to comprehend right now because come down and talk about this / how many years [Music] it's going to happen it's as sure as tomorrow is as sure as you can walk outside of the sun is shining right now it's a guarantee that it's going to happen so it's a it's an event and it's something that is building up and we got to see where it is that we're at and so looking over the last 50 60 years we see that God sent us a product and those were the years of preparation from 1946 all the way up to 1963 I want you to know too that there were burned offense at all of these pinnacle moments in time there were worldly nuts go back to nineteen forty six it was Israel moving back into her homeland you want to know about Israel always watch Israel and you wonder love 1946 that was the end of World War two it was the beginning of Israel becoming the nation these were world-changing events things that have happened for thousands of years okay turn to bring into place you know tiny CC world events that are taking place and see where we all get into the whole situation and here 1963 here comes the mighty angel himself comes down on sunset to open the second seals of God amen and there was world offense that were taking place back then presidents were being assassinated well it was changes in America and things were happening in the world the doors black moves and there was visitation to the boat for the first time in America there was those things that were happening and people would just think all these are just these are just events they don't have any real significance but I'm telling you that they do they always have they always will you can go back to all the major events listen this is just plain history people on the tapes other videos you want to go back and you wanna you want to check this out you want to go back and look up the history of Israel and find out how Israel bidden to every major event and look at the history of Israel and how the Spanish Inquisition and the coming to America and all the all of the all of those events that surrounded Israel they were world-changing events World War two do you know that that whole war was around a psychotic demon power that God Braves nothing about to be raised up in order to come against than the nation of Israel for one purpose so that God can force them back into their own land so that God could put it in their hearts that they needed to be restored back to the original place where god bless them we're gonna be with them and you as son or daughter of God when you came into that that that first revelation of God you wonder why all the tribulation while all of the fighting and all the character building that God was doing so that he can get you back into your rightful position as a son or a daughter of God you wonder why these tribulations come upon your life well you got to see the stage down in because we are in the midst of Revelations 10 8 to 11 where the bride now takes the book remember all the way angel came down now these are things i'm just going to highlight these these events you need to go back and read and study and look into the seven seals and see how how significant all of these events were to you personally because when you first came in and any were told to take the bunk and eat it that's the stage where it's sweet everybody remembers the honeymoons names no oh it was boring stories everyone my god I can't believe look at this oh sure fancied the mystery of iniquity what really happened to gardenia wasn't an ass glory to God I think doesn't it make sense if somebody knows that they're naked by eating an apple like like the woodland what says his attic so the mystery man in Rio's sweet revelations of what women took place in the garden that it was an adultery that that even done with the sir platform on another lineage of children but it was all for God's purpose because remember he wanted to be a same here you want to compare him deeper you can't repeat or save something that isn't lost or redeemable so God wanted to express all these attributes and here you are ether all this and you're getting the answer to every question in your heart about doc I couldn't believe it every question that was in my heart about the Word of God here it was pouring it like squeeze them oh my goodness the guy had understanding the oneness of God and that he's not a Trinity he's not 31 he's you know that that he was in offices he was just expressing himself all these revelations on the water baptism on property being baptized ensuite because now you are coming God's provided way and God is obligated to honor his word not man God's not going to honor some man's interpretation when I will because I stood when I was first born again and I received the word that I stood the Baptist ministers and they would tell me about the Trinity now I'm just trying to see what I can't understand the Trinity like the weirdest places will look that just take a loony there's more quarters in a little what's the veloute I said home somebody if they need to make sense but you see God was all thing your understanding and sweet look we took that book and you eat it and you fell and you even Joyce over it but then you know what happens anything you eat something goes into your digestive system starts moving through your body starts dealing with certain things you could eat you know that you can eat something good and because there's something bad in there you've got problems right because you've got a bug in there that needs to be cast out and when that bug is being cast out its Old Glory up it's not easy to leave this message brother I don't want you but even this week I fought like crazy against the end I below you but it was a battle like you have no idea I'm not going to give it would but I'm just telling you this is not going to be party time while we're here right you are going to fight if you're going to read you're going to stand as a son of god you're going to have to you're going to have to pay better huh you're going to have to deal with the bitterness of feeling look with the word of God in your life because it comes and that's the one thing that the devil cannot personally is he eating impersonate a lot of the movie praise the Lord yes the word of the Lord Oh docs have a problem anybody can do that there's a lot of message searches that are laying it on town centre comic praise the Lord hallelujah but then real character no care serum no revelation no real revelation of the word of God they're gone by under law kind of disgrace where they taking the word told me too far this way or too far that way not realizing that there's that there's a life and there's a character that God is trying to develop it you because that's what you do take that's the one thing that you as a son or daughter of God remember we don't just go through a three-and-a-half-year not even yeah it's going to be good the three and a half years after that we got to come back here for a thousand years to reign with Christ and to remove the price on the earth in the Millennium don't forget that you think you got rid of this yeah you're going to get rid of this you can still have to deal with this it arms right here on this earth what God places you into this dimension to move with him for a thousand years looks very peaceful it's going to be peaceful but you still can be character do you mean character dog character comes from battles battles that was produced characters suffering produces character suffering do you know the same battle sometimes over and over and over it's because you haven't written over and over because you haven't heard the dogs go to putting that character i believe god for them putting you until place to repent if you realized I was wrong and you're going to realize that it's Lord take this pride away from you take this take this thing away from me that wants to a rule that wants to win I don't want it anymore see that something that you cannot that no better than how can you impersonate that and that's what good and that's what's tough that's the part that time evidence that you know what God wants you to have cared so that he can use you so that you can be useful in the kingdom of God so that you can do your part now which is that you must promise I again you must bring forward the word you are the word for this generation I'm doing right now what we're experiencing right now not just me up here speaking like you down there hearing you recognizing you are fulfilling than word God [Music] you are filling the Word of God you are in Turkey where to copy customer we see the word up and you're saying amen to the perk up and that's the part that this bride she's now in the midst of all that but in the midst of all of that there's world events that are taking place your part remember you gotta stay focused on who you are don't get too caught up one of these romancin in it no more than what do they mean what do they order they fit I'll let the fivefold ministry bring it in the teaching of the word through i pastored through enough I hold this Kenisha worked up I'll let that be done in God's time to season but for now I'm going to stand my post food I'm going to stand in my position what is that I'm supposed to do in a moment how do I fit in this church Mike this is what we are dealing with we've got to recognize our carpet gotta get into our decision and do what God wants us to do and so I watch your readiness up while all this is going on while we're in the midst of fulfilling revelations 10 8 to 11 and this firm is going for we are standing on the Word of God you hear ministers every something getting up there preaching word you pull it up there and tell the people what God has done in our paying that you know that there's a way there's that there's a way out of this mess everybody's looking for some political way out of this mess there's no political way out of this mess the word you cannot write the word of god what is going to happen is going to happen and all you can do is allow the prophecy to people built but in the midst of that I want you guys what brother prior to set about this dry and about this stage that she was in now we know that brother Graham talked about the third coat mystery of Christ revealed tying a season where there would be a change another dispensational change in we know that in 1963 when the mighty angel came down and what brother branham introduced the mighty angel to this generation there was a dispensational change you need to know that you need to realize that what he was preaching price in history of God revealed he says I want you to notice the clock it's at two o'clock the second pool is over the third pole now begins and when the third goal moved into its its phase of the ministry that was when there was a change and a dispensational change where it might be a Djinn himself that was going to come down where brother friend was going to go off the sea and the mighty angel Christ Himself was going to come on the scene and he was going to possess a people by the only of that seventh seal he said that seventh seal would not be something that you could easily interpret he says don't even try to interpret it it'll it'll be its own interpreter right you will not be able to impersonate like sexy boy you will not give in to it Christ it will be a light it will be a manifestation and that's why you know a lot of us at our time in our season you know could have been 30 years for so 20 years ago five years ago six months ago whatever it is but there would be a time in a season where the Word of God would be spoken through the final ministry through the revelations are and it would call you in to your position call you in to the placing of the church give you a position in the church give you revelation inspiration that is way beyond the revelation that people are feeding on right now and so here we are now that the third pulled ministry we know that revelations 10 147 was fulfilled by the one man Ministry of the seventh church age William R and therefore revelations 10 127 was the Ministry of the shout and so the shout was between 1963 and 1965 and that was were brother Brandon the voice of the it was the voice coming out of brother Brett that was that was actually shouting and calling people to the attention of the money to himself to the message of the hour to the revelation of her that we are going to actually feed upon that was the shout of message going forth and calling sons and daughters of God that shelf still continued because it was a rep move from brother branham into the pride into the pride of christ into those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life those are the sons and daughters of God and so we moved into an hour from 1963 there's always a plenty but then there's the voice there's the voice stage of the ministry with a pride is now she's actually the final voice she's the voice of God she has the revelation you don't know what it is that you're actually speaking that revelation you're living in your life you've been investing in you women the way you dress knowing presenting yourself and the way that you treat your your your your husband's and lot of husbands where you treat your eyes according to what Bob you're fulfilling the scripture you're living out the word is the voice is the light amen and so here we see that all through that that time you go back and you listen to all the messages that were a mother a greater than Solomon is here the manifestation of the mighty God all those messages he was introducing the mighty angel he was also shouting the message that we needed to feed upon and when you heard it he said take the book take that revelation eat it feet on it and move on to the next stage now in Revelations Teddy 211 and toxic o that thou must prophesy again and this is what we're talking about now we're living this we're living this message were in the midst of all these world events but we're not to get caught up by world events we are to stay in the channel of a word that's been revealed to us amen and that's what's going to give us perfect faith to overcome this Great Tribulation that's going to cover model and it may look good right now in America all they got an unprecedented things are going to get better there 20 trillion dollars and dad they're still in 20 trillion dollars in debt they just got another chief commander that has to deal with 20 trillion dollars in debt and all the things that he's talking about I'm sitting on a natural stuff because people they're looking for they're looking for a savior they're looking for they're gonna you know their third they're gonna be able to live like in the land of paradise you know my life is going to change all these people applauding for Trump they're believing that they're gonna have a new bike could have job so you make a lot of money everything's going to get better it ain't going to get better not because I'm telling you ain't gonna get better because the Word of God shows clearly that the prophecy is not the things to get better therefore these two campers and so just because you know last week that the stock market rounding a thousand points is the biggest rally that advances 2011 because of the new president all of a sudden I think everything's going to be just fine but there's still 20 trillion dollars in debt and what trouble is proposing is going to take them so much deeper into debt that it doesn't even make logical sense what do you see but they're trying to make sense of it the trunk of the Brandon somehow miraculously change everything it can't change everything you can't change the word of god that's why and that's what working and I want you to see something here it's not a good thing while you just look at it and say all you need during that time that the bride is the voice in the last dayz during that season there's a stage in there where there's a preaching to the totally lost you know that what Jesus just before the resurrection now to the totally lost means that let's get this right here if you are a son or a daughter of god you can't be loved us okay sound okay so if you're a good college of Sweat right now if you want an old boy you mean this message is being preached to the totally lost yeah this there's individuals out there that can never be saved if they accept Christ they can be saved we're talking about two levels of salvation here but when it comes to get out of here before the great tribulation strikes the earth that only to a chosen elect group of God that he speaks about in the book of Revelation of those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundations of the world you and I cannot change the names that are in there those names were put in there before you and I came here don't think oh I have to do something good in order to get in there no God already knew who would accept him and who would not he didn't make them in such a way that there would be robots and say okay you accept me you you exactly you don't know everybody has an opportunity to accept trust everyone there's nobody that is not that you people up to them and say brother you want your life to change but right you while you're like to change you can change it right now by accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and repent of your sins and turn from God and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ your life will change for the better because God will honor his word but you cannot change what somebody says I don't want I will have it and there's going to be people like that they're just going to say no thanks I don't believe it I don't believe what you're telling me and that you cannot change and so that's where the government comes in where you were going to actually be speaking to those that are totally lost there's nothing you can do to change so that element it's a bit of a disappointment when you think about it but God didn't put you in full responsibility of saving everybody that's not your position your position is to recognize your day your message and your revelation that God is giving you in your day and live it and do your part ken behind the ministry do what it is that God is showing you that you're supposed to be doing don't hold back from serving God for giving to the kingdom of God for doing what it is that God don't give up keep pressing on there's so much more that we have to do it once it's all done we leave it's that simple so in closing this is just no way I've got so many calls here and just seems like I can't get to them but you know program says here and now I'm persons like ourselves we're going to be cut out of all that together that's exactly because they won't be able to do it it's tightening and then when that time comes and the press comes to a place to where your press down and watch what I am fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then it will be absolutely to the total loss but it will be for the bride and the church so there's going to come a point when that truck comes down and I believe we're in the midst of a truck all right now sees or we are being called to separate ourselves to dedicate ourselves rededicate ourselves to the Word of God and allow this revelation to change us and to get into our positions as sons and daughters of God because at that moment there's going to be a lot of supernatural change that's going to come over you it's going to be a revelation that's going to change you it's going to transform you from this dimension into that other dimension and notice when the third bowl of his ministry come the first was the healing of the sick we see the first ball to brother drives ministry we've seen that and if you look back you'll see three Bulls in every ministry Jesus when he was out there he had his first full ministry was to the people he'll become the sick you know raising of the Dead all the supernatural elements and then come the second fuller because the preaching of the word where all of a sudden the work you this is going to happen this is the scripture this is what's being fulfilled this is what's still to be fulfilled I am the fulfillment of that scripture you know you you as an individual you are the fulfillment of the scripture that God has allocated to this day this hour this season and you are actually fulfilling just like Jesus did the first a second in the third pole in every aspect of our own history the second was reviewing their organizations prophesied what they have done what they were and what was coming what is what his will come what wasn't it will come that's what he done is that right but his third pole was when he preached to the loss that couldn't be saved the Lord and that's when he was preaching for the lost that's when the world had gotten into such a condition where they believed that they could have a leader raised up and change their America that they do have somebody an individual that could change the world there's only one individual that can change the world there's only one individual that can change your world that's Jesus Christ your Savior Carly [Applause] amen that the musicians come lost could never be safe they had been chanted mercy listen America rejected mercy back in 1963 when brother brother had gone to America and he thought around America over and over and over again to the point where he hath of reach i infect dis generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ because they rejected God's mercy they didn't realize that God had sent the Prophet you go back into the Old Testament you all you'll see every time Israel rejected the word of the Lord they went into chaos there was no good that would come out of it and so here his first full healed the sick it was too late then it's all over and the message will go to the totally lost just like it did in the days of Noah seven days in the ark seven Church ages all the time it hasn't hit in the days of Sodom Jesus himself in his third stage of his ministry he went preached the souls that were eternally lost that were in prison that we had to not long suffering in the days of Noah there's people that are just imprisoned by their own doctrine by their own beliefs their souls that are imprisoned by doctrine their prison by their either by the teachings as y'all you know my traditions and my teachings are good enough you talk to women Catholics things up oh it's our addition to do this first communion and all of these different sacraments you can't find in the Bible and try to tell them but you know what you guys start with ABC's that's always will be in Christ always would even work if you can't find in the word then you know what there's something seriously wrong with that experience and I'm not talking to that God's Word tells you that all rights the word that's that's going to be placed in front at the white throne judgment God's going places word there and that's going to be ravenous of your life is going to have to line up with this work not my interpretation not control the witness termination not the Baptist like a Pentecostal not the word church of god no it's God's words interpretation that's why we are not the denomination we are not some organized religion we are the interpretation of the word of God we are a continuation of the book of Acts that's who we are on the move bless the name of the Lord there's just so much more that we could say but we need to realize next slide last slide talks about the three comings of Christ there's three times you see how wait a minute no there's only two minutes three the first coming is when he came and restore that he came to be the Redeemer he came to be the savior he came to put the blood between your sin and your position back in glory he made a way that was his first coming to take your place because of because you were born in sin shaped iniquity and then he comes a second time which is now he's in our best and he's redeeming his bride he's come together he's come to get his bride in the rapture and the remember I said we come again after three half years we're coming right back to the server for 1,000 year later it will be a peaceful thousand years and you have not have to worry about time being any kind of a hindrance like it is right now you look at the barrier to see that extra wrinkle you get out of bed they feel that expert make out oh yeah that's all because of time that's all because of because of death that came as we saw flip the fall back of the dark- but you're going to get a good money that's why in the moment in the twinkling of nine who could be changed you need a plan and you get to meet that bottom that's your fee body that's your eternal body that's your property that's the bottom it's going to be like when you were out there trying you were 20 years old that you're proud you look beautiful your skills diesel I know you sisters y'all you want to make it so we want it because that's an elegant the beauty industry is I think the biggest industry in the world right now health and beauty because everybody wants to live forever everybody wants to look young everybody wants to look younger here everybody wants to be 20 again guess what you're going to be touring that change and you'll never be any less you'll be in a brand-new bottom looking at 1000 year belinea in a brand-new body you will not have to worry about aches and pains you will not have to worry about sorrows and then we no more tears there will be no more harming there will be no more having to be under the firm that you're constantly under this insane as long as we are here it will be perfect as long as we are in this dimension you will be burnt we will have the cares of this life but don't let those things take you away from your decision in Christ the part that God is called in to just be faithful be painful to the end keep doing your parking do it keep coming into the house to Lord keep supporting the ministry it gave me how to keep praying keep you a lot to get because guess what we're at the finish line we're right there almost all there's not a time to get up right now this is the car because forever we will be victorious overcome its to nab that overcometh a teaspoon allowed to sit within this from a single sup we shall overcome [Music] [Music] Oh you [Music] come on girl see that you were drawing and the world Oh you me is [Music] Oh [Music] you mother you the same our away wrong [Music] Oh [Music] you [Music]
