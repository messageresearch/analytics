[27:04] then you better get it right
[27:07] because God
[27:10] is
[27:11] doing something that is new in our life
[27:15] everyone
[27:17] if only you can believe that God is good
[27:22] it's nice you know when you stand here
[27:26] it's not easy
[27:28] it's not a place of joke it's a place
[27:32] whereby
[27:34] you put it everything that God has shown
[27:38] you you dedicate your life to
[27:41] bring the word you take it seriously
[27:46] because it's not everything you are
[27:48] saying you are going to stand before God
[27:52] and make account to it
[27:54] so you take it seriously
[27:58] and
[28:00] only God
[28:02] thanks be to him
[28:04] the Lord is good
[28:07] the Lord is good
[28:11] hey the Lord is good I'll listen I want
[28:15] you to shout and praise him because when
[28:19] you shout and praise him do you know all
[28:22] your tiredness
[28:23] all the pain you have or all the tries
[28:28] leave you that is a sign that Satan is
[28:32] getting away from you so that the Holy
[28:34] Spirit can come in and fulfill the word
[28:37] in your life in my life so when we come
[28:41] here we have to praise him
[28:43] no matter what happened pushing aside
[28:46] and giving praise
[28:49] push everything out of the door so that
[28:52] Jesus can come in and fulfill his word
[28:55] in your life because without him we are
[28:59] nothing
[29:00] without him I am nothing and you are
[29:04] nothing without him so let us
[29:08] shout and praise him as the word gonna
[29:11] come forth blessed be the name of the
[29:14] Lord as I said that is the appetite
[29:17] because I have to give appetite face
[29:19] before anything and I won't keep you
[29:22] long for stunning let's turn into the
[29:26] Bible
[29:27] I think John
[29:29] [Music]
[29:31] John chapter
[29:33] 8 verse 12.
[29:38] and it will be the second scripture will
[29:41] be second Corinthians 5 17.
[29:46] and my topic will be the light
[29:50] of life
[29:52] is God's wife
[29:55] for this hour
[29:58] so uh
[30:01] brother Desmond can you come and pray
[30:03] before we start read the scripture you
[30:06] can stand just in a way and pray then we
[30:09] read the scripture
[30:14] foreign
[30:21] yes Lord
[30:28] verses and guidance as we are the
[30:32] greatest speaker
[30:34] Mighty let the word of God for the tree
[30:37] through the house in Jesus name we pray
[30:40] amen amen the scripture is John
[30:46] Saint John chapter
[30:48] 8 verse 12.
[30:50] then speak Jesus again unto them saying
[30:54] I am the light of the world
[30:58] he that followeth me shall not walk in
[31:02] darkness but shall have the light of
[31:07] life
[31:11] second Corinthians 5 17.
[31:17] therefore If any man be in Christ
[31:22] he is a new creature
[31:25] All Things Are
[31:28] pass away behold all things are becoming
[31:34] new may the Lord add his blessing may
[31:38] everyone
[31:39] sit down that's my scripture for tonight
[31:43] I think you got my topic so
[31:48] you see
[31:52] at this present hour
[31:55] the bride or you say the wife of Christ
[31:59] if I say the bride that means maybe his
[32:02] noun
[32:04] getting you but when I say wife
[32:07] when a man put a ring and married that
[32:11] woman becomes the man wife
[32:14] That Woman become
[32:17] so setting and know who she is
[32:22] that woman know that now that man is for
[32:25] me
[32:26] and me alone
[32:28] and Christ's children
[32:32] we know at this hour
[32:36] who we are what we are raised up for
[32:39] because the seed of God
[32:42] easyness before the foundations of this
[32:45] world and God has come down through the
[32:50] prophet and opening up the seventh seal
[32:53] told us what happened at the Garden of
[32:55] Eden through the how the serpent seduce
[32:59] if and begotten right so because of that
[33:03] when we came here spiritual Amnesia came
[33:07] to us and we didn't know who we are but
[33:10] at this hour we whom the Lord has called
[33:15] and let us know who we are and
[33:18] especially use the fight for Ministry
[33:20] which is our precious brother to train
[33:23] us
[33:24] by the word of God now we know who we
[33:28] are we know that the word is in us we
[33:32] know and we are so second
[33:35] of the word of God we have confidence
[33:39] that in Christ that oh now we see that
[33:45] the plan of God what was hidden in God's
[33:49] mind even
[33:51] the prophet didn't know
[33:55] some what God is doing at this hour God
[33:59] has made it known unto his wife because
[34:01] it was hidden that's why
[34:05] when the brother Abraham came his
[34:08] message was a mess
[34:10] age and the life has come out now when
[34:15] the Life come out we know we are the
[34:18] life that was hidden in that message
[34:22] we know
[34:24] that now we are the light of the world
[34:27] because Christ in us well the world is
[34:31] looking for Christ Christ means the
[34:34] anointed word and who is the anointed
[34:36] where you me working
[34:40] as the light of the world
[34:43] but to the world is hidden and to the
[34:47] even intellectual in the message is
[34:50] hidden
[34:51] but
[34:53] to the elect
[34:55] those that has received the light that
[34:58] came out the life that came out from the
[35:01] message we know who we are and what we
[35:04] have raised up for what the prophet is
[35:07] talking is now in reality in US
[35:11] we are not scared we we're not going to
[35:15] be pushed around no more because now we
[35:18] know who is our husband
[35:21] and her husband is with us
[35:23] like I and my father are one
[35:27] the father that dwell in me he does the
[35:29] words the father that dwell in you he
[35:32] does the words
[35:33] so it brings confidence
[35:36] he'd bring the power of God and bring
[35:39] the holy spirit in your life to shine
[35:43] that whosoever is looking for Christ the
[35:47] Lord come and contact you he will
[35:50] receive that light because you are the
[35:54] light of the world and this present hour
[35:57] the wife the wife of Christ
[36:03] in these last days in this generation
[36:07] we are the people there's no other
[36:10] people coming we are the last one
[36:13] and God has pour everything because the
[36:19] Bible says the least
[36:21] that was is in the kingdom of God is
[36:25] greater than John the Baptist that's why
[36:28] God has made no his word by his Spirit
[36:33] coming out to anoint the seeds
[36:39] the Seas who are his wife and no man can
[36:44] impersonated the word that is coming
[36:48] because they can is not by education
[36:51] it's not by man opinion or somebody
[36:56] teaching you is by the Holy Spirit
[36:59] himself God may know to his wife
[37:04] that hey you are the light of the world
[37:07] when I came here I I was the light of
[37:11] the world two thousand years back
[37:13] but I didn't do it all I hate some of
[37:18] you and now you are here
[37:21] my word I hate some of you now you are
[37:25] here so you whom I have made my word
[37:30] known to you you are part of me you are
[37:33] born of my bone Spirit of my spirit as
[37:37] our Pastor said we are portion of root
[37:41] of Devi
[37:43] the root of David
[37:45] so we are now made known
[37:49] make known to the world so whosoever one
[37:54] Christ let him come and take the Water
[37:58] of Life freely revelation 22 17. that's
[38:03] why the scripture says the spirit of
[38:05] Jesus Christ and the spirit of the Bride
[38:08] are what one because the Father the Son
[38:13] they are one
[38:15] and the Father the Son the Holy Spirit
[38:18] are one and it is you at this hour
[38:23] you that God is counting up you that the
[38:28] Holy Spirit has come to so the holy
[38:31] spirit is counting on you he's making
[38:35] himself known that now you are my wife
[38:39] you are not my friend or you are not my
[38:44] servant you are not somebody I just pick
[38:47] on the street and just use one day and
[38:50] throw out because a wife married a
[38:54] husband for the rest of the husband life
[38:57] and we marry Christ to Eternity he as
[39:02] many as to what
[39:04] eternity as he himself is eternal so are
[39:09] we eternals
[39:11] because nobody
[39:15] can impersonate the word of God because
[39:18] Jesus said my sheep will hear my voice
[39:23] who do you think he was talking to
[39:27] he know
[39:29] man with their ability
[39:32] as the serpent with his intelligent
[39:35] produce if
[39:37] so would man will come with Republic
[39:41] mind
[39:43] intellectual mind
[39:46] even in the message
[39:48] to coming
[39:50] calling themselves preachers but they
[39:53] are not
[39:54] calling themselves fight for Ministry
[39:57] but they are not
[39:59] so God by his grace
[40:02] at this hour
[40:05] just the seed that we're hidden that
[40:08] nobody thought
[40:10] don't cease
[40:12] are part of the faithful Ministry where
[40:16] it is sometimes churches hate them the
[40:18] message churches they don't allow them
[40:21] to come to the prophet that they don't
[40:24] allow them to to to to to for God to
[40:27] make manifest God is saying no
[40:31] I won't allow that
[40:34] I am I've come down
[40:36] myself
[40:38] at this hour
[40:40] just like a woman got pregnant and it's
[40:43] nine months
[40:45] when it's nine months the baby tried to
[40:47] do what push up
[40:50] and there's nothing gonna stop it no man
[40:54] can stop it because God has designed it
[40:58] and it's God Alone
[41:01] the holy spirit is doing it
[41:05] because it was him beginning
[41:08] and it will be him at the end
[41:11] that's why he said I am the first
[41:14] and the last
[41:16] because no man can do it
[41:20] no man can listen
[41:25] when I said secret things to my wife
[41:28] no matter how you come and try to hear
[41:31] it to peel it to understand it you know
[41:35] it because there is some things my wife
[41:38] know even I can bring my eye to her
[41:40] that's meaning my wife know that
[41:44] which PhD person can know that
[41:48] they cannot
[41:49] because it's not written
[41:53] it's not written okay but my wife
[41:57] understands that either I bring what it
[42:00] mean
[42:01] she knows
[42:03] how I behave
[42:06] certain ways
[42:07] my wife knows alone
[42:10] because why I and her are one and Christ
[42:14] and his bride are one
[42:17] so he goes to the bride individuals
[42:21] and reveal himself
[42:24] the unwritten part of the word
[42:27] and they come and they speak it
[42:30] you will stand there you will say what
[42:33] are they saying
[42:34] it's not what the brother Brown says
[42:37] this brother yes the prophet said that
[42:39] but what about the unwritten part of the
[42:42] word
[42:43] what about God's spirit
[42:47] coming down to reveal the word
[42:51] because God is doing that
[42:53] that part the devil can impersonated it
[42:57] because he has impersonated the written
[43:00] word of the Bible he has to impersonated
[43:03] the written word of the spoken word
[43:05] which is the written part which brother
[43:08] Brown spoke he has impersonated it all
[43:12] of it
[43:13] but he can impersonate the spirit of God
[43:17] which is life
[43:19] the life come out
[43:22] and he goes to the bride
[43:25] the wife of Christ Alone
[43:28] and God put a ring on them
[43:31] and they begin to know who he tell them
[43:34] who they are what position in him
[43:39] because let me tell you if I ever
[43:43] thought I will be standing here I'll be
[43:46] like a liar but when the comforter came
[43:51] when the Holy Spirit has come
[43:54] he let me know
[43:57] so I am second of God
[44:00] I have confidence of God
[44:03] listen I I respect any man but now it
[44:08] has gone beyond any man
[44:11] it has gone beyond personalities
[44:16] there's no such a thing
[44:18] God
[44:20] is the only one
[44:22] that interp is his own interpreter God
[44:26] is the only one that interpret the word
[44:30] even if you can't read and write like me
[44:33] better but God spirit
[44:37] will show you
[44:39] because at the day when he came Peter
[44:43] and John that people took knowledge
[44:47] that they were electric but they took
[44:49] knowledge that they are being with who
[44:52] Jesus Christ
[44:54] because the great Holy Spirit was upon
[44:57] them
[44:58] revealing the work interpreting the word
[45:02] without the Holy Spirit watch Peter and
[45:06] Peter he ran away he denied the Lord he
[45:11] was cow
[45:12] he was a man that whom couldn't even
[45:16] wanted to die for the gospel because why
[45:20] that time he don't have the Holy Ghost
[45:23] showed him yet but when the at the door
[45:27] of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit
[45:31] Came Upon them
[45:33] you saw because Judas has no part
[45:38] Judas know the letter he have a gift
[45:42] that's why they went out in Casa devils
[45:46] guests and calling our without
[45:49] repentance
[45:51] it's in the Bible
[45:52] and the prophet said it
[45:55] yes
[45:57] but the most important is
[46:00] when a man or a woman
[46:03] you have representation
[46:06] in heaven
[46:08] before the foundations of this world you
[46:12] were part of Christ
[46:15] others our God is looking for his own
[46:19] wife
[46:20] the wife that he has told before the
[46:24] foundations of this world if you are
[46:27] part no matter what you can even
[46:31] deny this
[46:33] but the Holy Spirit Will Reveal to you
[46:37] and you're gonna come out
[46:40] that's why the gospel we don't need to
[46:43] go bad people to come and join Church
[46:47] [Music]
[46:50] because the gospel is calling God is
[46:54] calling his own attribute
[46:57] those that were part of him
[47:00] that he has ordained
[47:03] and Trust
[47:04] now he's calling
[47:07] that's why
[47:09] when
[47:10] you meet somebody
[47:12] gone quick to judge
[47:16] don't quick even if they denying the
[47:20] gospel don't quit to judge because Satan
[47:23] has used
[47:25] so much tradition
[47:27] so much intellectuals
[47:30] dies
[47:31] and it has blinded the people so much
[47:35] that they don't know who they are
[47:38] some of them I remember
[47:41] even me
[47:43] when I heard about this gospel
[47:46] I fought with it
[47:48] you may say brother coffee you yes
[47:51] I fought with it I don't want to do
[47:53] nothing with it
[47:55] but the more I tried to run
[47:58] the more because
[48:00] it's like a horse that they have put
[48:03] chain on your neck
[48:06] where are you gonna run to
[48:08] you can't run nowhere
[48:11] you can run but you can't hide thank you
[48:14] my pastor
[48:15] you can run but you can't hide
[48:18] because it's not a man doing it
[48:22] it's not even a priest doing it is God
[48:26] himself
[48:28] the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ himself
[48:34] think about it
[48:36] but Abraham
[48:38] do you think it was him
[48:40] if it was him he could have make a mess
[48:45] a man with great servant in America one
[48:48] of the advanced countries in the world
[48:51] is America
[48:53] like a man like that who what church who
[48:57] allowed him in their puppet
[49:00] they were never allowed him
[49:03] they don't want him
[49:05] as a matter of fact his words will be
[49:07] like stinking their nose
[49:09] they don't want it but God says
[49:14] I have chosen
[49:16] I will confirm him to the world
[49:21] I will let him demonstrate my power
[49:25] that no man
[49:27] even his own enemies
[49:29] they couldn't deny
[49:31] it was the Lord
[49:33] it wasn't William Branham it was the
[49:37] Lord and at this hour
[49:39] God is saying
[49:42] I God came down
[49:45] 1963.
[49:47] open the sins God was here
[49:51] but the bride was not ready yet because
[49:54] we were born as babies
[49:57] so the Lord have to allowed us to grow
[50:01] grow in the world
[50:04] but he was here it's just like a man
[50:07] married to a woman they have to study
[50:10] one another so sometimes
[50:13] each and everyone tried to cover their
[50:15] fault to show to their husband oh I'm
[50:18] good I'm this I'm that but it will come
[50:21] to a time everything they are doing does
[50:25] complained you before one another
[50:28] they fight they do everything but
[50:31] they grow together
[50:34] like a barn
[50:35] God is saying my pride I have trained
[50:39] you
[50:40] since 1963 I came down
[50:44] up in the seals and begin to call the
[50:48] elect
[50:49] I have trained you
[50:51] I have opened up my way to you now I am
[50:56] showing things to you
[50:58] who you really are you are not just came
[51:02] to the world and die like anybody else
[51:04] or just go to church like everybody else
[51:08] let me tell you and let me say
[51:12] some of us
[51:13] we
[51:14] if we really know who we are we're not
[51:19] gonna stay home
[51:21] we're not going to stay home
[51:23] unless we are sick or something or work
[51:27] or something serious
[51:29] you'll be dedicated
[51:32] to the word
[51:34] you'll be serious
[51:36] put away you won't take it for granted
[51:40] you'll be serious about the word your
[51:44] life will be balanced
[51:46] your life
[51:48] you are not afraid
[51:50] listen
[51:51] sickness
[51:53] pay
[51:54] poverty
[51:56] riches
[51:57] those things you don't even care about
[52:00] it
[52:02] even though you have to work you will
[52:04] need money to do this that
[52:06] you not nothing once you there's a
[52:10] breath in your life and you can be
[52:15] you always will surrender to this
[52:19] you're surrendered to the way
[52:22] you won't be hypocrite
[52:25] you won't be a person that
[52:29] like this
[52:31] no sir
[52:32] you are serious
[52:35] about the way because the word is like
[52:38] the way you eat natural food
[52:41] so is it your spiritual food
[52:44] because Jesus
[52:46] has done great thing for you
[52:50] Jesus has let you know who you are
[52:54] when you know who you are you don't walk
[52:56] with your head down
[52:58] those days you see brother coffee
[53:00] walking with his head down has passed
[53:04] I don't remember it no more
[53:07] because now
[53:10] the king is in the camp
[53:12] the husband is in the camp
[53:16] when a woman don't have a husband
[53:19] and he has grow do you know how
[53:22] desperate some of them are
[53:25] they got so desperate it's not like a
[53:28] man
[53:29] women have certain age when they're rich
[53:32] and they don't have man
[53:34] then they have so much sadness in their
[53:37] face
[53:38] but let them get a husband which woman
[53:41] that is married that have the ring
[53:44] they're gonna hide a ring as soon as
[53:47] they go in party they're showing
[53:53] forgive me sisters but it's part of it
[53:57] their story that they are married
[54:01] as soon as they see their friends the
[54:04] first thing they show my ring do you
[54:06] know I married
[54:08] right
[54:11] right
[54:13] it's the truth
[54:15] they show the ring because they are
[54:17] married
[54:18] and so is it with a genuine Christian
[54:22] flies in with the wife of Christ
[54:24] when Christ is coming and showing you
[54:29] who you really are
[54:32] you can't walk with your head down
[54:35] you walk
[54:37] we're revering respect
[54:40] but you show
[54:42] that you have the ring
[54:45] you saw the ring is there
[54:48] and let me tell you
[54:51] everybody that
[54:54] sees it
[54:55] that knows you they will know this man
[54:59] this woman is married
[55:01] they'll know this sister is married to
[55:04] Christ
[55:05] they will know this brother is married
[55:08] to Christ because who have the light
[55:12] that will go and hit the light under the
[55:15] pillow
[55:18] am I lying on truth
[55:21] come on
[55:24] don't be like symmetry to me like I'm
[55:27] preaching to myself
[55:29] come on
[55:32] just pull the gift
[55:35] if you don't put a gift the gift doesn't
[55:37] go pray
[55:39] but when you pull it it will come out
[55:43] you understand when you pull that gift
[55:46] you're gonna see what is there
[55:49] I have gone some places even I have it
[55:52] on my phone
[55:54] baptizing people in Ghana my wife was
[55:57] right there baptized the girl
[56:01] as soon as he got baptized me and our
[56:04] last pastor know him but I baptized the
[56:07] guy finish the power of God hit her
[56:09] screaming fall down there get up
[56:12] speaking tongues he interpret it even
[56:15] denomination peace they were baptizing
[56:18] the river he knocked his head to me like
[56:21] this
[56:22] I know what God can do
[56:27] I'm not here for popularity
[56:31] oh off no
[56:34] I am just a simple coffee
[56:36] the way you see me the way I am if I
[56:40] make mistake I'll be ready to repent if
[56:43] I know if I don't know then I don't know
[56:46] but if God saw me I'm ready to repent
[56:49] I'm not a hip Pastor someone know me we
[56:53] went to Ghana and a guy we are driving
[56:55] prayer off sister Palmer was there
[56:57] Pastor Samos in the car I screamed with
[57:01] the guy I fought with the guy because I
[57:03] want to get things right
[57:05] I'm not gonna say it's my pastor so I'm
[57:08] Gonna Leave the guy like that to behave
[57:10] to do things that is not right even to
[57:15] do no I'll do everything
[57:18] right because
[57:21] let him know who you are
[57:24] if there is anything wrong he can help
[57:27] me but if I go ahead it under the ground
[57:30] you think my pastor can know and help me
[57:33] that's how so many people are they come
[57:36] in the church they want to hit things
[57:38] underground
[57:39] and and thinking why my life is this why
[57:42] my life is that
[57:44] put everything on the table
[57:47] when you put it the pastor can help you
[57:50] if it's a true Pastor he will help you
[57:54] because we know the hypocrite preachers
[57:58] has done so much message
[58:02] the people
[58:05] but the good ones when you know you know
[58:09] when you see you see
[58:11] some of us will be sitting here long
[58:14] time we know who is a true preacher
[58:17] like one brother tell me
[58:20] he says
[58:22] if I don't have Pastor Simon pray to me
[58:24] at this area
[58:26] I'm not going any church
[58:28] he says no
[58:30] he says I know what I got what God
[58:32] ordained him for me
[58:35] so
[58:38] the word that he gave me he does the job
[58:42] what should I need
[58:47] let us get serious
[58:50] it's not a man it's the Holy Spirit
[58:54] he is coming out he's showing himself
[58:58] in the form
[59:00] where even we we think not
[59:04] where let me tell you
[59:07] no man knows God's mind unless God
[59:10] reveal it
[59:12] with all your education all your big
[59:15] shots without God you are like us come
[59:22] with my literature
[59:24] all my literate and my everything
[59:27] without God I'm like skunk
[59:30] I think what what shall it profit a man
[59:34] or a woman if you gain the whole world
[59:38] and lose your soul
[59:41] so
[59:43] brothers and sisters
[59:47] let us love the Lord
[59:50] let him be our priority
[59:53] let him be our number one
[59:55] because
[59:56] he has told us who we are in him
[1:00:02] the church out there don't know
[1:00:07] some people they are better than us
[1:00:09] walking in the street they don't know
[1:00:12] rich people educated better than us they
[1:00:16] don't know
[1:00:17] God Came To You by grace
[1:00:20] he came to me by grace
[1:00:23] it's always Grace
[1:00:25] so when Grace has come to you don't make
[1:00:28] it turn like a disgrace
[1:00:32] because the Bible says the sense of God
[1:00:35] will judge the end who do you think is
[1:00:38] going to judge the air is you and me
[1:00:41] we are the face
[1:00:43] we're gonna judge that
[1:00:45] the people that we have preached to they
[1:00:48] turn the gospel down Grace was offered
[1:00:51] to them the light of the world was
[1:00:54] showing to them
[1:00:56] and they turned it down
[1:00:58] Jesus says the world will not see me
[1:01:02] but you will see me I will be with you
[1:01:07] to the end of the world
[1:01:09] wherever you go I'll be with you if you
[1:01:14] are abiding me my word abiding you as
[1:01:18] what you will
[1:01:19] what do you want from Christ
[1:01:22] what do you want
[1:01:24] that the Lord cannot do
[1:01:27] is the Lord hand too short that he can't
[1:01:30] do let me tell you
[1:01:32] me I'm not scared of anything
[1:01:36] because God
[1:01:38] I have seen him in reality
[1:01:41] I have seen him
[1:01:44] in reality
[1:01:46] I know before when
[1:01:49] I used to hear people talk god raise the
[1:01:52] day the Lord raised the day it was like
[1:01:55] a joke to me and they are talking
[1:01:57] and I used to say in my heart
[1:02:00] if the Lord raised the Dead I want to
[1:02:03] see it
[1:02:05] I want to see
[1:02:07] do you know what you did
[1:02:10] I keep it quiet or I didn't come out but
[1:02:14] this is the hour he did
[1:02:17] anything you ask him you do it
[1:02:21] if you abiding him
[1:02:24] people don't want to abide it with God
[1:02:27] like bro that's what I was saying you
[1:02:30] come to church even their tight pain
[1:02:31] it's a struggle
[1:02:34] they are offering pains a struggle
[1:02:37] how can you be blessed
[1:02:39] how can God use you
[1:02:43] you don't want to come to church
[1:02:46] how can God demonstrate all these things
[1:02:48] I'm talking
[1:02:50] you're gonna think when your brother or
[1:02:52] sister is talking
[1:02:55] you're gonna think you're joking
[1:02:58] you're gonna be like a something in here
[1:03:01] this guy is crazy this sister is crazy
[1:03:03] you talk too much
[1:03:06] because
[1:03:08] they have surrendered their life to
[1:03:11] Christ
[1:03:16] like that's what I was saying can God
[1:03:19] use me yes he can can God use you yes he
[1:03:23] can
[1:03:26] after all we came here some of us
[1:03:30] God has demonstrated himself
[1:03:34] doing prayer meetings
[1:03:37] during a Sunday service
[1:03:40] during a
[1:03:43] weekdays
[1:03:45] he even used to come down
[1:03:47] and tell us he said as during the week I
[1:03:51] send my way
[1:03:54] to you but when you come pray and I I

[1:07:28] because he wants somebody in that area
[1:07:32] and I will be
[1:07:35] I obey the Lord
[1:07:37] one time me and my wife was eating we
[1:07:40] had power power because they have
[1:07:42] reported and they caught the person we
[1:07:44] looked the window somebody shot somebody
[1:07:46] 13 years boy they have shot him even I
[1:07:50] call police they catch the boy so I can
[1:07:53] sell it
[1:07:56] and
[1:07:58] my wife was criminal in his life he
[1:08:00] never see something like that but me I
[1:08:03] have seen all those things so it wasn't
[1:08:05] new to me
[1:08:07] right people want God to use them but
[1:08:09] you watch brother Philip is sitting down
[1:08:12] there it was the same area
[1:08:14] I met brother Philip
[1:08:18] so if I didn't go there this brother
[1:08:21] won't come
[1:08:22] and if I didn't go there like my wife's
[1:08:25] sister Rose will not get a husband
[1:08:29] he live in Africa
[1:08:31] and you need a husband and see how the
[1:08:35] Lord orchestrated it I won't say they
[1:08:37] are married let them talk I don't know
[1:08:40] right
[1:08:44] so people
[1:08:46] they want God to use them but you think
[1:08:49] you're gonna use you in your comfortable
[1:08:51] Zone they come to church what they want
[1:08:54] to do is what they want to do
[1:08:56] but sometimes God what you don't want to
[1:08:59] do God gonna say do it
[1:09:02] would you
[1:09:04] the thing you don't like
[1:09:06] the thing that the most thing that was
[1:09:09] thinking your nose
[1:09:11] God will tell you do it
[1:09:15] and you let
[1:09:17] listen I have claim the church more than
[1:09:20] anybody
[1:09:22] and I've seen things
[1:09:24] some people you even call them brother
[1:09:26] help me oh the Lord didn't call me to
[1:09:28] clean
[1:09:30] Brown Philip is there
[1:09:32] the Lord didn't call me to clean but one
[1:09:34] day one becomes they want to go for it
[1:09:37] when they want trustee they want to go
[1:09:39] for it
[1:09:40] I've seen all that the Lord show listen
[1:09:44] sometimes I don't know God show me
[1:09:46] things
[1:09:48] and I'm just down there and he said you
[1:09:50] see I say yes Lord even sometimes my
[1:09:52] with my mother I want to open he says no
[1:09:56] keep your mouth zip it's not yet
[1:10:00] okay
[1:10:02] because why
[1:10:04] you want God the things you don't want
[1:10:08] that's where you get his glory
[1:10:10] when you do it
[1:10:12] he will get his glory the pastor May
[1:10:15] patch your back
[1:10:17] for what you are doing but is that what
[1:10:20] God wants in your life
[1:10:23] is that what God called you for
[1:10:28] you think me I want to stand here and
[1:10:30] preach
[1:10:32] you think I want to
[1:10:35] you don't know how hard God
[1:10:39] get me
[1:10:41] because I know I can do it
[1:10:46] I'm literally I cannot do it
[1:10:49] so I don't want it
[1:10:52] but if I don't come
[1:10:54] I didn't obey him
[1:10:58] I didn't obey him
[1:11:01] then who am I gonna please please a man
[1:11:06] no sir let God get a glory
[1:11:10] Let Jesus get the glory
[1:11:14] when God God get a glory
[1:11:18] I am nothing that is okay
[1:11:21] because God
[1:11:25] is the one that I come to worship
[1:11:29] God is the one that give me eternal life
[1:11:32] God is the one that giving you eternal
[1:11:35] life
[1:11:36] and he's telling you
[1:11:39] I came here
[1:11:41] I give all for you
[1:11:44] would you give all for me
[1:11:47] would you do things
[1:11:49] that I don't want you don't want
[1:11:53] things
[1:11:55] that I will show you
[1:11:57] sometime
[1:11:59] a look you are dying
[1:12:02] you look you are going the grave
[1:12:05] but you are praising him
[1:12:07] you are lifting him up you don't care
[1:12:11] about your life
[1:12:13] you don't care what anybody thinks
[1:12:16] but him alone
[1:12:20] him alone in you
[1:12:23] and you will say thou good and faithful
[1:12:26] servant
[1:12:28] like Stephen
[1:12:31] that people didn't like Stephen
[1:12:34] there's told him after preaching the
[1:12:37] gospel
[1:12:39] but when
[1:12:41] they stole him and he was dying all the
[1:12:43] Angels stood for him
[1:12:45] because he did the job the Lord was so
[1:12:49] pleased
[1:12:52] about Stephen
[1:12:53] he saw a priests about Moses he saw a
[1:12:58] priests about William Abraham
[1:13:00] is your turn
[1:13:03] your thing
[1:13:07] the Lord wants you to
[1:13:10] do what he wants you to do
[1:13:14] we sing a song where he Lead Me
[1:13:18] I will follow
[1:13:20] would you follow him
[1:13:23] would you give all of your life
[1:13:26] would you allow him to lead you
[1:13:31] because
[1:13:33] sometimes he Lead You In a Strange way
[1:13:37] a strange way
[1:13:40] not the way people think
[1:13:43] because he is God
[1:13:45] and his God Alone
[1:13:48] he said I am jealous God
[1:13:51] is jealous of you
[1:13:53] you
[1:13:56] everywhere whether you are sleeping
[1:13:58] whether you are working whether you are
[1:14:01] coming to church even if you are not
[1:14:03] coming still jealous of you
[1:14:05] because
[1:14:07] his grace
[1:14:09] he has given to you
[1:14:12] he has already placed the seed of
[1:14:14] himself in you
[1:14:16] and that seed won't return void
[1:14:19] whether you serve him you don't
[1:14:23] hit the series there
[1:14:25] like Saul
[1:14:26] he went to the winch of Endor
[1:14:30] did that didn't stop God
[1:14:33] allowed even the witch of Andrew to see
[1:14:36] his servant Samuel
[1:14:39] and a woman scream
[1:14:42] he told so what you like me do you have
[1:14:46] lied
[1:14:47] so I went to heaven
[1:14:50] he wanted to kill David God servant god
[1:14:54] king that he anointed
[1:14:57] that didn't stop God and says Saul has
[1:15:01] done bad so I push Saul away
[1:15:04] and so is you
[1:15:06] no matter what you do once the Holy
[1:15:09] Ghost is on you
[1:15:15] but
[1:15:16] do you love Christ
[1:15:19] are you willing to obey him
[1:15:21] are you willing to Shine the Light
[1:15:24] sometimes it take you to Dark Places
[1:15:29] places nobody know
[1:15:33] one time I want to
[1:15:36] place in Africa I was sitting in a car
[1:15:40] at the bottom of the car we're driving
[1:15:42] in that wood and that's what's coming I
[1:15:45] have to use
[1:15:47] this kind of big one to cover my nose
[1:15:50] to go and tell about Christ
[1:15:54] and when I was I read there the Lord was
[1:15:57] saying to me why did you do this
[1:16:02] I could not speak but it's coming some
[1:16:06] it's like somebody talking from my heart
[1:16:09] why do you do this
[1:16:11] you did this because of me
[1:16:14] I cried the whole day
[1:16:16] and when I read the
[1:16:18] let me tell you I saw God says you did
[1:16:22] this I will let you see this
[1:16:25] I begin to see the power of God people
[1:16:28] even Muslims people that God was
[1:16:33] displaying himself in front of me
[1:16:36] some time till I I'm sleeping I'm crying
[1:16:38] I say Lord I know I can't do this this
[1:16:42] is sup
[1:16:44] like you you doing so much for me to see
[1:16:48] I can't even go testifying the church
[1:16:50] they may think I'm crazy or some will
[1:16:53] say I'm talking too much I'm too low and
[1:16:57] this didn't happen that didn't like they
[1:17:00] begin to question me let me tell you
[1:17:02] enough America we have too much
[1:17:03] knowledge
[1:17:06] I'm gonna stop not too long sometimes
[1:17:09] too much knowledge let's blow all that
[1:17:12] knowledge out
[1:17:14] and take God at his word
[1:17:17] when we take God as his word we become
[1:17:19] like dummy in the eyes of the people
[1:17:23] that's how God can move
[1:17:27] you're you're all you like
[1:17:30] like one minute you don't know
[1:17:33] one minute God can come and speak
[1:17:36] through you and do things show you
[1:17:38] things that you yourself you know you
[1:17:42] it's not something you reason you're
[1:17:44] thinking look listen me I preach I don't
[1:17:47] use
[1:17:48] that's the way the Lord has shown me he
[1:17:50] says Coffee you are literally I'm not
[1:17:52] going to use you like the way I use
[1:17:54] Pastor Simon or Philip or Desmond or or
[1:17:56] Danny or tembie or Christopher I have
[1:18:00] them in that way
[1:18:02] but you just go there with the the
[1:18:05] little scripture I gave you go there
[1:18:07] with it
[1:18:08] open your mouth and talk
[1:18:10] I will be there
[1:18:15] I know that from him
[1:18:18] so every time I come here I have
[1:18:20] confidence
[1:18:22] I have confidence
[1:18:25] that's what I have
[1:18:28] I don't know the quote but that's why
[1:18:30] you don't see me quoting brother Brown
[1:18:32] this that I listened to the tip of all I
[1:18:35] know I listen to the third brother brown
[1:18:37] paper sermon preaching days that how are
[1:18:41] you gonna do it coffee don't know
[1:18:44] but I'm just like a cow
[1:18:47] I just threw it and I come here but you
[1:18:50] you pray with me
[1:18:52] God gonna show you that is not coffee
[1:18:55] you see
[1:18:58] God gonna show to you that is not me
[1:19:01] it's him
[1:19:03] and that's what we must be
[1:19:06] too much knowledge
[1:19:09] will make us puffed up
[1:19:12] we think we know
[1:19:15] and yet we don't know nothing we will
[1:19:18] miss the simple things the way God moves
[1:19:21] the way God do things me I want to be
[1:19:24] simple
[1:19:25] like Isaiah he told Isaiah go sleep on
[1:19:28] the street cut your bomb
[1:19:30] and the fabric how many of you if the
[1:19:33] Lord told you tonight to go do such a
[1:19:35] thing would you do it and yeah they
[1:19:38] called himself believer they will say no
[1:19:40] no no no this is like to mean leprosy
[1:19:42] the people gonna laugh at me I'm crazy
[1:19:44] up this and maybe educated maybe I'm too
[1:19:48] much days
[1:19:54] he's the same God
[1:19:57] never change
[1:19:59] if you use Isaiah Moses Noah brother
[1:20:03] Abraham John the Baptist he's the same
[1:20:07] God look at how he has come in this
[1:20:09] church
[1:20:12] he's preaching you you can see his
[1:20:16] English
[1:20:17] and his case but if you are looking for
[1:20:21] God you're gonna see Mighty God in his
[1:20:24] preaching
[1:20:28] God doesn't care about your education or
[1:20:31] how much you can talk
[1:20:33] you only care about his word
[1:20:35] and your only concern about his
[1:20:37] predestinated seat
[1:20:39] he has placed us here
[1:20:43] under his servant that he himself has
[1:20:46] trained from 12 years he called him
[1:20:50] surrender his entire life build him and
[1:20:54] give us to him some of us
[1:20:57] I want to buy a decimal town
[1:21:00] a small village and I was standing there
[1:21:02] and I said my goodness I thought I come
[1:21:05] from Village but this one come from
[1:21:08] Village anyway he's one of the king they
[1:21:10] they have so much land over there
[1:21:12] and if you see how God brought him out
[1:21:17] from that place
[1:21:19] when I was there I was even lifting my
[1:21:21] hand and thanking God
[1:21:23] I said God
[1:21:25] if you have done this me like I'm on
[1:21:29] Main
[1:21:30] Street like going to the big city and
[1:21:34] the capital I'm in the middle but that's
[1:21:37] more it's like you go out of nowhere
[1:21:42] right
[1:21:44] some like it's nowhere and God move and
[1:21:48] go and bring this brother here and see
[1:21:51] how the Lord has used this brother
[1:21:53] then you know that God is God
[1:21:57] that tells you God is God
[1:22:00] and he turned the hand of God to do that
[1:22:03] God showed me that first I am God you
[1:22:07] see what I've done
[1:22:09] I can do for you
[1:22:11] I can let you do whatever you think is
[1:22:14] impossible
[1:22:16] and God is doing that with me
[1:22:18] it's beyond me
[1:22:21] I can't do it no I can't
[1:22:25] I don't have that brain but the grace of
[1:22:28] God
[1:22:29] has told me I am the light
[1:22:33] I should let the light shine they see
[1:22:36] this in me they see this in you let your
[1:22:38] light shine you are the light of the
[1:22:41] world
