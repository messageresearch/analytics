[14:19] hallelujah amen spiritual Amnesia when
[14:23] the man thinks that he's a woman and the
[14:25] woman thinks she's a man when the voes
[14:28] start change and the woman's voice start
[14:30] to get
[14:32] BR and the women start to get
[14:35] aggressive with a masculin spirit and
[14:38] the men start to become
[14:41] feminine they have a h
[14:44] s right like that and the women's Voice
[14:48] start give me that give me that H over
[14:51] there turn is a man when you look you
[14:54] can't believe your eyes like but it's
[14:57] changing that way right the feminization
[15:01] of men and the masculinity of women and
[15:04] the women start to grow huge
[15:06] beer and the man's face start to
[15:11] get and they start to use creams and all
[15:15] kinds of stuff you know like that my God
[15:19] the whole thing is messed up I know
[15:21] about female gender male gender I never
[15:23] heard the Bible talk about
[15:25] gender but it seems like they're
[15:27] developing all kinds of stuff God but
[15:29] that's the way it is now but see because
[15:32] the people have lost their
[15:35] identity social STI they lost their
[15:39] identification they don't really know
[15:41] who they are and so they're acting like
[15:44] the best thing that they think they
[15:47] believe they can act like and that
[15:49] mistakes are made that way see you lost
[15:53] your spiritual memory when we were in
[15:56] heaven with him worshiping we were there
[15:59] before the foundation of the world but
[16:01] we lost our
[16:03] memory and we lost where we come
[16:07] from we lost our position that we
[16:11] have we lost our
[16:14] genealogy your roof your family you lost
[16:18] it all amen see and I want you to know
[16:24] this brother sister there was ways that
[16:26] they're working on to Amia
[16:29] and one of the ways to cure Amnesia is
[16:32] to give you the right
[16:34] medicine and that's what I'm trying to
[16:36] give you every day you might like the
[16:39] taste of
[16:40] it and nobody likes the taste of
[16:43] medicine except the wi know who like to
[16:46] go and buy those cough syrup and knock
[16:48] down a bottle just to get the percentage
[16:50] of alcohol in but the fact is brother
[16:53] and sister that I have to feed you the
[16:55] medicine of God's word amen and the
[16:57] medicine of God's word if the takeing
[16:59] the right has explosive
[17:01] [Laughter]
[17:05] force you're laughing because you
[17:08] understand what I'm saying it's really a
[17:10] spiritual
[17:12] prud is that right and after a while you
[17:15] can't control it it's going to begin to
[17:17] purge out the sin in your life purge out
[17:19] the uncleannesses in your system amen
[17:23] it's going to make you do that brother
[17:25] sister praise the Lord because God wants
[17:27] to clean you up and lean you out and
[17:30] make you a real child of God hallelujah
[17:34] amen praise the name of the Living God
[17:36] yes sir and also another way that they
[17:38] going to cure Amnesia is that you went
[17:42] into that state by a
[17:44] Shar so to bring you up they got to give
[17:47] you an equivalent
[17:49] shop and so what happens is that they're
[17:52] going to give you an electric shop with
[17:55] so many BTS in it and bring you back to
[17:58] yourself
[17:59] so sometimes you come in church here and
[18:01] the preacher got to preach the word and
[18:03] take you to a shocking
[18:05] experience and and the word of God got
[18:07] to shake you up amen when the word of
[18:10] God really shake you up come to your
[18:12] sens wake up praise the Lord somebody
[18:14] the preach got to pick you up and slap
[18:17] you a couple of
[18:19] times slap you a couple of times for you
[18:21] to come back to your senses to recognize
[18:23] who you are where you actually come from
[18:26] amen at other times
[18:29] the psychologist or the doctor will take
[18:32] that person and take them back to places
[18:36] where they used to live they pass by the
[18:39] old Home Place see if their memory going
[18:42] to keepi in they pass them by their old
[18:45] school or they bring them back their old
[18:47] friends that they used to have to see
[18:50] their faces to see them if something
[18:53] will just kick in that's why I'm
[18:55] preaching to you amen I'm preaching to
[18:57] you and taking you back to the old
[18:59] familiar places amen Were You There When
[19:03] They Crucified My Lord Where Were You
[19:05] When The Morning Star s together and the
[19:08] sons of God shout for Joy trying to take
[19:10] you back to a familiar place I want to
[19:13] prepare a place for you that where I am
[19:14] you may be also I'm trying to bring you
[19:16] to a familiar place so somewhere your
[19:19] spirit catches on the word of God don't
[19:21] be afraid I'm finding this up now praise
[19:24] God hallelujah so take you back to those
[19:27] places so that you could recognize who
[19:31] you are and recognize where you come
[19:34] from I'm not supposed to be this person
[19:37] that I am you're a better person than
[19:40] you think you
[19:43] are the devil has made you put yourself
[19:46] down but in natural fact you're a better
[19:49] person than you think you are they only
[19:52] know outside but God knows you the woman
[19:56] the man that lives on the inside God
[19:59] knows your heart Hallelujah no matter
[20:02] what you're going through God knows your
[20:05] name he knows all about you praise God
[20:08] forever more hallelujah amen look you
[20:11] remember when Jesus on the morning when
[20:14] he rose from the from the dead and Mary
[20:17] rushed to the tomb and when she went
[20:20] there at first there was nobody the next
[20:23] time she came back and she looked in and
[20:26] when she stood up up there she saw a man
[20:30] and the Bible says she taught him to be
[20:32] the
[20:34] G and then that person spoke and says
[20:38] Mary I don't know how he said it but
[20:41] somehow she knew that voice and she knew
[20:45] when her name was called and right away
[20:47] she said Roni Master amen right away she
[20:51] recognized who he was amen let me tell
[20:55] you again he's risen from the dead it's
[20:58] calling your names by the word of God
[21:01] and right right now all of us may not
[21:05] immediately recognize who he is and what
[21:08] the word is really saying to you amen
[21:12] but somewhere along the line these words
[21:15] I'm speaking to you here today it's
[21:16] going catching the soul and you
[21:18] recognize it's that great Shepherd
[21:20] calling out his sheep and calling by
[21:23] your name the voice of
[21:25] God amen amen
[21:29] Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah amen
[21:34] a man sitting by the wayside
[21:37] begging while he was sitting there he
[21:40] says Lord have mercy on me and the Bible
[21:44] tells us Jesus stopped and laid his
[21:48] hands upon him and gave him his sight
[21:52] amen oh praise God he's passing our V
[21:56] here again today when Jesus came and
[21:59] call then things happen when Jesus comes
[22:03] whenever he comes things are changed
[22:05] when he comes to stay by God's grace
[22:08] Hallelujah I honestly believe he's the
[22:11] same yesterday today and forever for you
[22:15] come musicians when he calls me I will
[22:18] answer I'll be somewhere listening for
[22:21] my
[22:23] name Hallelujah
[22:36] what
