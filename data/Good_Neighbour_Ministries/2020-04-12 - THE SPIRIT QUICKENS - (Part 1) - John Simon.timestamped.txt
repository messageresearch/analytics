[0:05] [Music]
[0:18] good Sunday morning friends happy Easter
[0:22] to one and all I'm here today to rejoice
[0:28] with you on this glorious resurrection
[0:31] morning may God richly bless one and all
[0:38] my subject for today is the spirit
[0:43] Quinton's the word in particular the
[0:48] spirit of god quickens the word of god
[0:51] for the age in which we live and what i
[0:57] want to show is that god's words written
[1:02] on the pages of our Bibles are dead
[1:08] unless resurrected or quickened by the
[1:13] spirit of a mighty god it is found in
[1:18] the scriptures let me read this for you
[1:22] briefly 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 verse
[1:28] 6 Paul the Apostle speaking they letter
[1:33] kill it
[1:35] but the Spirit gives it life let me
[1:40] repeat
[1:41] they letter kill it but the Spirit gives
[1:47] it life it's Easter time it's
[1:53] resurrection time it's rapture time and
[1:58] I'm happy that I am a believer son of
[2:03] the Living God and I'm here today to
[2:06] show you that the Holy Spirit who is the
[2:11] Spirit of Truth
[2:14] here to quicken the words on the pages
[2:18] of this Bible to us through his
[2:23] marvelous grace to resurrect or to
[2:29] quittin that is why he is here and in
[2:35] particular - he is here to resurrect or
[2:39] quicken God's seed word gene or God's
[2:47] attribute that was deposited in the
[2:54] heart of the believer to resurrect it
[3:00] and raise it up in a certain age a
[3:06] certain season and a certain time this
[3:12] was placed in her life whether you're in
[3:19] a church or around a church if you are a
[3:21] child of God
[3:22] you're one of God's elected seed genes
[3:26] then that gene of God was placed in you
[3:32] from before the foundation of the world
[3:38] you came to this position and you are
[3:42] here listening even by God's
[3:46] supernatural election you are not
[3:50] watching or listening to this by chance
[3:53] but you are watching and listening
[3:56] because the Spirit of Almighty God led
[4:01] you here today I welcome you in the name
[4:05] of the Lord Jesus Christ now in the
[4:10] beginning Genesis chapter 1 verses 1 & 2
[4:15] the Bible clearly tells us in the
[4:19] beginning God created the heaven and the
[4:23] earth and the
[4:27] earth was with and the Spirit of God
[4:29] moved upon the waters and the earth was
[4:33] without form and void it was without
[4:37] form and void and the Spirit of God
[4:40] moved upon the face of the waters
[4:45] yes the Spirit of God of course
[4:49] water-types the Word of God the spirit
[4:52] of God was moving on the face of the
[4:56] waters and it's that same Holy Spirit
[4:59] that moved on the waters in natural
[5:03] creation when God said let there be
[5:07] light when God said Let there be fishes
[5:12] in the sea it was the Spirit of God that
[5:17] anointed the Word of God and caused it
[5:21] to create whatever God had said by his
[5:25] word for his word cannot return to him
[5:29] boy according to the scriptures so the
[5:33] Spirit of God was there to quicken every
[5:37] word that God has spoken
[5:40] whatever God said and whatever God says
[5:43] the Holy Spirit of the Living God is
[5:47] there to quicken the word of God to our
[5:51] hearts and to the hearts of all
[5:54] believers that will believe wherever
[5:57] they are for God's grace now the Spirit
[6:02] was there to click in the word in the
[6:05] time of natural creation God said let
[6:10] there be light and as I said the Spirit
[6:13] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[6:16] the Spirit of God and the Giants the
[6:20] words God spoke the Spirit of God
[6:23] empowered the words that God spoke to
[6:28] bring it all to pass by his creative
[6:32] ability now that creation that natural
[6:37] creation of the world
[6:40] that time was not just a creation but it
[6:44] was also a resurrection now if we look
[6:49] at Genesis chapter 1 verses 1 & 2 we'll
[6:54] see in the beginning God created the
[6:59] heaven and the earth
[7:00] . yes . it was done the earth and the
[7:07] heaven was already created now we know
[7:12] God is perfect God is absolute
[7:16] perfection but the next verse says and
[7:20] the earth was without form and void in
[7:25] other words the world or the earth was
[7:28] in chaos the chaotic ages of birth at
[7:33] that time is what is described here in
[7:36] the scriptures now between God creating
[7:44] the heavens and the earth and the earth
[7:48] being without form and void something
[7:53] happened something took place and if you
[8:00] were to read as I did dr. Timbers hurts
[8:03] earliest ages
[8:05] we'll find out friends and we should ask
[8:10] is this the time when dinosaurs walked
[8:13] upon the face of the earth is this the
[8:17] time when Lucifer ruled so that when he
[8:22] was kicked out his jealousy for
[8:25] humankind exists to this very time who
[8:32] was there what kind of beings
[8:36] what kind of inhabitants were there at
[8:40] that particular time before the earth
[8:44] became without form and void now we
[8:51] understand it was God's
[8:53] moving on the natural creation it was
[8:59] the Holy Spirit and is the Holy Spirit
[9:01] who quickens God spoken word God's holy
[9:07] spirit came to a virgin and by his
[9:13] spoken word the Holy Spirit empowered
[9:18] energized and anointed and fertilized
[9:22] that word of God in the womb of Mary and
[9:26] that word of God was made flesh and
[9:31] produced a supernatural birth now by
[9:37] that spoken word you also can believe it
[9:42] in the womb of your heart and that same
[9:46] word of God will produce for you a
[9:50] supernatural birth where you know that
[9:54] you're a child of God you're a daughter
[9:57] of God you're a son of God no matter
[10:01] where you are no matter what your
[10:03] condition got you're hearing God spoken
[10:07] word and if you will receive it into
[10:10] your heart today I assure you your life
[10:14] will be changed and you will come to
[10:17] recognize that you are a child of the
[10:20] king yes it brought for the supernatural
[10:23] birth and that same spirit of God is
[10:27] here to quicken the Word of God to you
[10:31] to my heart to your heart and to bring
[10:35] us to a new birth and new birth not a
[10:38] natural birth where you will be reborn
[10:41] in your mother's womb but it births by
[10:45] the Holy Spirit where you become a new
[10:48] creation by God spoken word born again
[10:53] by the spoken word of God now one
[10:58] natural creation secondly the creation
[11:03] in the womb of Mary by
[11:06] Holy Spirit anointing God's spoken word
[11:11] then we read the ninety-third Li that it
[11:16] was the Holy Spirit when Jesus was
[11:19] crucified on dark Calvary when our
[11:22] Savior bowed his head and died it was
[11:26] the Holy Spirit when they laid him
[11:28] called in the tomb at the tomb and they
[11:32] thought it was over for him forgetting
[11:35] that he had said you can destroy this
[11:38] temple but I'll raise it up again in
[11:41] three days
[11:42] now we see it was the Holy Spirit that
[11:47] went and raised up the body of Jesus
[11:51] quickened him from the dead quickened
[11:55] him and raised him up now
[11:57] during his earthly ministry of course I
[12:01] mean we understand that Jesus recognized
[12:05] that even the Jewish nation need to be
[12:08] resurrected and raised up from
[12:11] traditions and and and all the teachings
[12:14] of the elders they need to be elevated
[12:17] in to a higher realm where they can
[12:21] receive the fullness of God's Word and
[12:24] so is it with Christianity the Holy
[12:27] Spirit wants to raise us all up to
[12:31] another dimension of Revelation
[12:34] understanding and personal perfect
[12:37] realization of the unfailing realities
[12:41] of the Living God that is being given to
[12:44] the earth by a supernatural ministry of
[12:47] the seventh angel no friends that is
[12:50] what happened at the resurrection Jesus
[12:54] the Word made flesh was crucified dead
[12:59] and buried but the Holy Spirit came to
[13:04] that dead word that was in the tomb and
[13:08] raised it up or quicken it by his power
[13:13] his mighty power he raised the word
[13:17] Jesus up from the dead now you
[13:20] I read their Bible before you might have
[13:23] read the various books before various
[13:27] listen to various tapes before but one
[13:29] day God has ordained in his word that
[13:33] the Holy Spirit will quicken the word
[13:36] like you've never heard it before open
[13:39] up the eyes and the ears of your
[13:42] understanding open up the understanding
[13:45] of your heart to recognize your day and
[13:49] the message for your day and to
[13:51] recognize him him Jesus Christ the same
[13:55] yesterday today and forever
[13:59] we understand here in the Word of God
[14:02] that we he was raised up heed the word
[14:06] that was dead and buried was raised up
[14:10] from the tomb raised up from the grave
[14:14] it was God's Spirit and it takes God's
[14:17] Spirit moving across this word of God to
[14:22] bring it to life again
[14:24] the Bible has all the letters written
[14:29] upon it
[14:30] anyone understanding the English
[14:33] language can read it and say oh I
[14:37] believe I'm a Christian go to church do
[14:41] Bible studies to all kinds of
[14:44] seminarians studies theology
[14:46] hermeneutics pedagogy whatever studies
[14:50] they could have done all of that but
[14:53] unless one day God's Holy Spirit moves
[14:57] across the waters of that word and
[15:01] brings that word to life again and
[15:04] create classes the Bible to become a new
[15:08] Bible until it becomes so real to you
[15:12] that you recognize that it's a part of
[15:15] you and you were a part of it
[15:18] whoa listen up day that hunger and
[15:21] thirst after righteousness for they
[15:23] shall be filled
[15:25] maybe we filled with God's Spirit even
[15:27] now while I speak here today oh this is
[15:31] resurrection time this is Easter time we
[15:34] are here to give glory and honor to God
[15:37] that this one person Jesus Christ who
[15:41] said I am he that liveth and was dead
[15:45] but now I am Alive forever more normally
[15:51] we say a person lived such a long life
[15:56] and then they died and that's it but for
[16:00] him I am he that liveth and was dead but
[16:06] I am Alive for evermore alive from the
[16:10] dead alive from the dead up from the
[16:14] grave he arose risen on this marvelous
[16:17] wonderful resurrection morning whoa what
[16:22] a wonderful mighty God we serve that
[16:25] God's Word that was buried for centuries
[16:29] he is able to raise it up again now let
[16:35] me get to the fourth part that the Word
[16:40] of God that was buried the Apostles dr.
[16:45] us true Paul true Peter true James to
[16:50] all the other apostles Barnabas that
[16:53] were there at that particular time the
[16:57] Apostles doctrine that was lost after 64
[17:03] AD the troops of God's Word are the
[17:08] truth embodied in the full Word of God
[17:13] was lost it was meant to be crucified
[17:18] dead and buried it suffered entombment
[17:29] under the piercings of Roman god
[17:36] all this the place and happen during the
[17:40] Dark Ages pains of Inquisition chains of
[17:44] persecution turnings of suffering
[17:46] trouble sometimes upon the Church of the
[17:49] Living God at that time and the true
[17:53] face was buried
[17:58] Peter II they say and their friends it
[18:02] seems all what was lost
[18:04] it seems like darkness was everywhere
[18:09] the dirt ages closed in upon the church
[18:14] just as the darkness closed in upon
[18:18] Israel in the time of Egypt but thank
[18:22] God there is a God in heaven and that
[18:26] God had promised by his word enjoy a
[18:30] chapter 2 verses 23 to 26 I will restore
[18:35] seeing the Lord unto you all the years
[18:39] that they conquered and the caterpillar
[18:43] and the farmer worm had eaten away God
[18:47] promised according to his word that he
[18:51] will pour out of his spirit and had he
[18:54] will restore to the church all the
[18:57] doctrines that were eaten away all the
[19:00] joy that was taken out of the church all
[19:04] of the love and brotherly kindness that
[19:08] was eaten out of the church all of the
[19:12] true worship that was in the original
[19:15] church was eaten out of the church until
[19:18] it became a dead litany of so-called
[19:23] worship in the presence of God real
[19:27] worship is like what we saw in heaven
[19:29] when John spoke and said I saw all
[19:35] numberless numbers thousands upon
[19:39] thousands upon ten thousands with their
[19:42] voices like men
[19:43] waters crank under and glory and power
[19:47] and praise hallelujah praise be unto God
[19:52] and again in the scriptures it says
[19:55] where were you when the sons and
[19:58] daughters of God were shouting for joy
[20:00] before the foundation of the world
[20:03] friends look real Christianity is a
[20:06] noisy face it's a noisy face where
[20:10] people raise their hands embrace God
[20:13] where people glorify him and worship Him
[20:16] and it seems sometimes like it's
[20:19] confusion because some crying
[20:22] some are praising summer rejoicing
[20:24] somewhere in the spirit they're laughing
[20:27] why they are happy beyond belief
[20:31] Oh with a joy beyond anything that one
[20:36] can really experience just like by
[20:40] themselves only the Holy Spirit can give
[20:43] you joy unspeakable and full of glory
[20:46] may he give that to you here today
[20:49] maybe rejoice in your living rooms maker
[20:52] rejoice in the presence of God and
[20:54] recognize that the Spirit of God is here
[20:57] to quit them the Word of God
[20:59] now friends that God promised I would
[21:03] restore saith the Lord and just as much
[21:08] as Jesus's body the words Jesus the Word
[21:12] made flesh Jesus was raised up from the
[21:16] dead in three days even so the Word of
[21:21] God that was buried the revelation the
[21:24] truth of the word of God that was dead
[21:29] crucified dead and buried under Roman
[21:33] dogma and entombed within the dark ages
[21:40] of the church but that could only happen
[21:44] for so long because we understand
[21:48] friends that the God said that he would
[21:52] not suffer his Holy One to see
[21:54] corruption
[21:55] you cannot destroy the genuine truth
[21:59] spirit-filled and spirit of minded
[22:01] Church of the Living God he will raise
[22:03] it up again he promised he would restore
[22:06] the church and restore the truth of the
[22:09] word of God and so we understand God
[22:11] began his process of restoration and it
[22:17] began with Luther Martin Luther god
[22:20] bless that saint of god a marvelous and
[22:25] wonderful original Roman Catholic and he
[22:31] received God's Word at that time and
[22:35] after receiving the Word of God he
[22:38] recognized something made clear to him
[22:42] the just shall live by faith the just
[22:47] shall live by faith and he used the
[22:50] words alone in other words not my works
[22:54] that men have done not by offerings of
[22:59] the body but by all kinds of works or
[23:03] sufferings that we can place upon
[23:05] ourselves but we are saved by my grace
[23:09] through faith in Jesus Christ that just
[23:13] shall live by faith and God's promise
[23:19] came to pass because he began to raise
[23:25] up his body his body that was entombed
[23:31] his word body that was entombed its
[23:35] resurrection it's wonderful restoration
[23:40] began with the Reformation reforming
[23:45] winning back into this wonderful body
[23:49] all the parts all the pieces all the
[23:51] neck going all the meat bones all the
[23:53] various bones bringing him back and
[23:55] bringing them back to frame their
[23:57] original place and position within
[24:00] that's marvelous wonderful plan that he
[24:04] had claimed before the world began so
[24:08] let me recap he was he the word in his
[24:13] work form not in this flesh body but in
[24:16] his work form was crucified dead and
[24:21] buried under Roman dogma and in tune
[24:27] during the time of the Dark Ages of a
[24:32] time of did not determine national
[24:36] church control right and you see by
[24:41] taking away or rolling back the stone
[24:48] that was seen when a Roman seal upon it
[24:53] that huge stone of doubt unbelief and
[24:59] fear please there by the legions of Rome
[25:04] but all that demons of Hell could not
[25:08] hold the Word of God
[25:10] captain it couldn't not keep him there
[25:13] for as the songwriter sent up from the
[25:17] grave he arose with a mighty triumph or
[25:21] his foes yes he arose the victor from
[25:26] the dark domain he arose what my friends
[25:30] as a victor with his Saints to reign and
[25:32] he reigns the day the sing yesterday
[25:35] today and forever Jesus Christ I am
[25:38] happy to say to you my friends I am one
[25:42] of his believers I am one that believed
[25:45] that he that Jesus Christ was crucified
[25:47] dead and buried and rose again for our
[25:52] justification Oh living he loved me
[25:55] dying he saved me buried it justified
[25:58] rising oh my old glorious day he's
[26:02] raised up to raise me up and take us
[26:04] away in a rapture and faith by the grace
[26:07] of Almighty God hallelujah blessed be
[26:10] his name oh no wonder it is
[26:13] Frank Timms that's yeah he is the mighty
[26:16] Conqueror for he retina failing to Satan
[26:20] could not conquer him the Bible tells us
[26:24] that while his dead body lay in the tomb
[26:27] he went down his solace went down into
[26:32] the pits of Hell and there he took
[26:36] captivity captive in a way to dramatize
[26:40] that he went down into hell and grabbed
[26:45] the keys of death in Hell from Satan and
[26:50] open those cell doors oh and live out
[26:55] those saints of God that were held
[26:58] captive between the old and the new
[27:01] testament what a blood was not yet shed
[27:04] but their believes unto eternal life but
[27:09] now the blood is shed already so we can
[27:13] be completely saved immediately but back
[27:17] then that word those people that
[27:21] believed it was counted on to them
[27:24] righteousness for this scene must face
[27:27] my revelation of this great Messiah this
[27:31] great deliverer of this great Conqueror
[27:34] that was to come and they put their
[27:37] faith in him so much that job said I
[27:40] know that my Redeemer liveth and that he
[27:44] shall stand upon the earth in the latter
[27:46] days job literally saw from way back
[27:50] where he was the coming of Christ right
[27:53] to his second coming and the coming of
[27:55] the Lord with his Saints like in the
[27:57] book of Jude and he said the Lord cometh
[28:00] with ten thousands of his Saints blessed
[28:03] be his holy his righteous and precious
[28:06] name we see clearly friends that God
[28:10] then began to use he used let me say
[28:14] these words he used Martin Luther to
[28:19] nail his articles of protest
[28:27] on the door of Wittenberg castle
[28:31] protesting what he was taught before
[28:36] recognizing that it's not by the works
[28:40] of men or any such dumbness Creed's or
[28:45] whatever but he clearly said that just
[28:48] shall live by faith and that was the
[28:52] rebirth or the resurrection of genuine
[28:57] apostolic doctrine and Christianity upon
[29:00] the face of the earth but then we
[29:04] understand the Lutheran's began to say
[29:07] well the just shall live by faith
[29:09] and a son began to drink and smoke in
[29:12] party and carry on because as long as
[29:16] they believed they felt it was all right
[29:18] like some people as long as they're in
[29:20] the church as long as they're reading
[29:21] their Bibles doing Bible studies they
[29:24] think it's all right but God said also
[29:27] for the second day or you use the word
[29:30] in three days I'll raise it up again we
[29:33] understand that also means another age
[29:36] right another age so we understand that
[29:41] Wesley came in that next day or the
[29:44] second day recognizing that we must not
[29:48] only be justified by faith and then take
[29:52] our Liberty and go out and live anyway
[29:56] dress anyway speak anyway associate with
[30:01] any appearance of evil or or whatever
[30:04] and yet it will be all right with God so
[30:08] God sent Wesley and Wesley caught the
[30:14] revelation that not only must we be
[30:17] justified but we have to live holy lives
[30:20] we have to be sanctified by the grace of
[30:23] God second step in the process of the
[30:26] resurrection of apostolic doctrine from
[30:30] out of the graves of the dark angels out
[30:34] of the improvement within the dark ages
[30:38] out other
[30:39] away of that stone of doubt unbelief and
[30:43] fear that was placed there and sealed
[30:46] with a Roman seal we understand the
[30:49] seals were broken off of the Word of God
[30:52] by these two men at that time and it
[30:56] released me the word that was buried it
[30:59] raised it up into the view and the eyes
[31:03] of the elected of God for that
[31:06] particular day and God used him
[31:09] wonderfully well then you can read up
[31:13] the life of John Wesley how God used
[31:15] them but then after after the Lutheran's
[31:18] after the madness after justification
[31:21] came sanctification after sanctification
[31:24] came the Pentecostal revival with the
[31:28] baptism of the Holy Spirit God anointed
[31:33] a man in our day of twentieth century
[31:35] prophet by the name of William Marion
[31:38] grant him who came on the scripture of
[31:41] command came on the Holy Orders of
[31:45] Malachi 4:5 I spew all died single - in
[31:50] line to the prophet and he shall turn
[31:52] the hearts of the children off back to
[31:55] the father's turn the hearts of the
[31:58] modern-day children of the fake back to
[32:01] the face of the taluk fathers amen amen
[32:06] hallelujah thank you Jesus take your
[32:09] Lord I'm happy here today I'm rejoicing
[32:12] neither day as I walk into this
[32:15] wonderful way of the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:18] God sent him to bring Ababwa full
[32:21] restoration the full restoration amen
[32:26] for he said I will raise him back up in
[32:28] three days and so true three ages of
[32:33] church history after being entombed God
[32:36] sent this marvelous wonderful seven h7
[32:43] messenger of the Church of the Living
[32:47] God to raise up his word for the hour
[32:51] hallelujah and to restore back walk not
[32:54] himself
[32:55] but to restore back the Word of God that
[32:59] was crucified dead and buried and to
[33:02] bring it back to the attention of the
[33:05] elected see the truth Church true Church
[33:09] of the Living God to restore to us the
[33:13] truths that were lost
[33:15] I'll give you an instance as for
[33:17] instance there is only one God there is
[33:21] only one Lord one faith one baptism one
[33:26] mediator between God and man
[33:29] one name by which we ought to be saved
[33:31] and that name is none other than the
[33:35] Lord Jesus Christ god help us that was
[33:38] restored powerfully under the great
[33:42] Ministry of William Marian bring him
[33:45] God's servant amen in this wonderful
[33:48] last name also to restore back to us Z
[33:53] this recognition that original baptism
[33:58] written right in the Bible is in is
[34:02] supposed to be in the name of the Lord
[34:05] Jesus Christ now remember Jesus had
[34:09] already told Peter how that you should
[34:13] go to all nations baptizing them in the
[34:17] name of the Father and of the Son and of
[34:21] the Holy Ghost and now we understand the
[34:25] modern church uses that as if to say
[34:28] that is the name of which people have to
[34:31] be baptized
[34:32] now just pure English I will not take
[34:35] much time with this but your English
[34:37] will tell you Father is not a name son
[34:39] it's not a name Holy Ghost is not a name
[34:42] I'm a father I'm a son and I'm a human
[34:45] but that is not not my name but Peter
[34:48] and the Apostles had caught the
[34:50] revelation what he was saying so on the
[34:54] day of Pentecost when they asked him men
[34:56] and brethren what shall we do
[34:59] he
[34:59] to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[35:04] Christ for the remission of your sins
[35:06] baptize in what name in the name of
[35:09] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[35:12] and furthermore he says for there is no
[35:15] other name given under heaven whereby we
[35:19] must be saved but the name of Jesus
[35:22] Christ our Lord
[35:23] I tell you Peter did not make a mistake
[35:26] Amen you don't have to make a choice
[35:28] whether to believe Jesus or to believe
[35:30] Peter because it's one and the same
[35:33] thing it's only the revelation of the
[35:36] word it's only the Spirit quickening the
[35:39] Word of God on your heart and may he
[35:42] quickened the Word of God to you here
[35:44] today in the name of our Lord Jesus
[35:46] Christ to recognize who you are
[35:50] what you're hearing and may the Spirit
[35:52] of God speak it right into your soul Oh
[35:56] believing child of God you may not fully
[35:59] even understand but something in your
[36:02] heart is telling you that's the truth
[36:04] that's the Word of God I accept it
[36:08] in the name of Jesus Christ another
[36:10] thing he restored back to us is that
[36:14] there was no denominationalism from the
[36:18] apostolate doctrine there was only one
[36:20] church denominations that we have over
[36:24] 3000 or more of them they are all
[36:28] they're all man-made efforts man-made
[36:32] efforts my brothers and sisters to
[36:35] conserve the truth and to interpret the
[36:40] truth and also to defend what they think
[36:45] is the truth and thereby they put gone
[36:50] aside not recognizing that God is a
[36:54] defender of his own face and that God is
[36:58] his own interpreter he will make it
[37:01] plain yes God anoints his word and he
[37:06] makes it plain as he is making it plain
[37:08] for you
[37:09] named by his marvelous and wonderful
[37:13] grace God restores his own word God is
[37:19] his own interpreter of his own word so
[37:24] don't be deceived but only believes the
[37:29] Spirit of Almighty God what he's
[37:31] speaking and sing right into your heart
[37:34] here today Oh may he quickened the Word
[37:37] of God to your heart or believe in child
[37:39] of God may he quicken that word upon the
[37:44] altar of your heart and sit in a fire
[37:46] set your soul fire by his marvelous and
[37:50] wonderful grace amen
[37:52] even if that word of God that you heard
[37:55] since you were a child even that word of
[37:57] God that you might have learned since
[37:59] you were in the church if that word of
[38:02] God that when you were in the message
[38:04] seems to have died out within your heart
[38:07] and within your soul may the Holy Spirit
[38:11] of Almighty God
[38:12] today quicken that word quickly the
[38:15] embers of the word of God may the bright
[38:18] winds of the Holy Spirit fan the flames
[38:21] of the embers of the Word of God that is
[38:24] within your heart and may they come up
[38:27] blaze again with zeal with joy with hope
[38:31] with faith and with a testimony that I
[38:35] am born again I am freed from sin I've
[38:39] been washed in the blood or I believe
[38:42] the word of God and I receive it here
