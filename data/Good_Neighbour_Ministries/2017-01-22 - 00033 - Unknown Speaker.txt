house so God isn't against you having a whole bunch of houses houses says and lands amen he said uh uh in this world and then he wants emphasiz it that they don't misunderstand him that he's talking about spiritual blessings he said in the present time and also in the world to come praise God so don't just talk about the little cab you going to have in glory land God has promised to bless his people right here right now and Solomon said what is the purpose of a man laboring he labors so that he can enjoy the fruits of his labor so he says go enjoy the fruits of your labor praise the Lord he said all that night you're going to leave it for the wicked it's up to you what you want to do but that's not the way to be you're going to leave it for the wicked so use it amen praise the Lord so if you have to eat eat if you have to drink drink if you have to travel travel let the Lord have this way in your life praise the Lord I don't want you to get this uh feeling bound up you know uh by the same message we claim to believe under legalism she so bound up that um to be richual almost ends up being like a curse no sir um you know that's not the way it is with God Amen he said I become po that you might become come on don't word like you're scared Rich he said I become poor not words I do without I without a whole my the foxes have way their head I didn't have none but I become for you might become rich is that right there's nothing wrong with being rich and you don't have to hide you don't have to just just you know you know it's God just walk with humility and allow the Lord to do his thing in your life amen he wants to show these Sinners that by evil and by wickedness by cunning their Mass well but he wants to show them that by wisdom Holiness serving him just like he did with Abraham I don't even know how I got on this but praise the Lord Abraham and and Isaac and all through the Bible and you have Breen telling you that no God is not interested in uh monetary Affairs and material things and and and stuff of that nature but they don't understand that every one of the prophets start for but look at the end look towards the end the Bible tells of job twice as much as he had before he didn't have anything God blessed him and then he took it away and then he gave him back so what do we care we in his hands just lay your life in his answer let him do whatever he wishes with you promotions promotions of the job R all those things he saids seek me first and I'm going to add all these things to you amen is this going to happen so so simply so easy you you're going to have help from Heaven Supernatural help will be on your side and and things are just going to be working out and you don't even know how it's working out but it's working out and that's how we are to live by faith amen knowing that it's not by our strength not by our wisdom though we will use it but he said this I give you the power to get well I give you the power you think you get it by yourself but I give you the power the wisdom you got I give you the forite the ideas I give you but you got to acknowledge Him First recognize he's the one that's doing it and God doesn't deny his children anything nothing he Grant you what the desires of your heart and if it doesn't line up with his word he'll stop you he'll block you or later on you have to slap you and let you back up a little bit or whatever but brother said I'd rather a man or a woman act on the word make mistakes repent and come back rise and try again says God doesn't like conservative don't want to make even a move wants to know everything is perfect and right before you make a move no act on the word when you act on the word and then God fulfills that word and he'll move in a mighty way praise the Lord so I'm glad to see every one of you here today you know I was in the mall and I was passing by and one of the men that was cleaning up and stuff like that and picking up uh garbage and stuff and putting it you know in the bags like you going to mall to see them doing that so I said hey how are you he says oh he says uh I I'm I'm I'm trying I said yeah I said but you should be happy your business is picking up laugh when I pass by again every may go back business is picking up even if it's garbage your business is picking up so have faith in God and he will bring it to pass amen I'm so happy that I can say I'm one of them praise the lord well let's read the scripture and let's talk amen good to see Alvin and am in the house of the Lord praise the Lord God richly bless them amen now um let's read out of Luke 24:49 I think it's one verse in praise the Lord okay let's read the verse before we read it Luke 24:49 um we're going to read that verse and then we'll just uh talk with one another here and see what the Lord has for us amen praise the Lord hallelujah you know some churches are built on healing Services that's the foundation you always have a healing service other ones are built on singing and and praise of War almost all the servic is f with singing and singing and singing and then they're really pushing in the Peace of the word uh towards the end all the ones are built on having always having shows or plays or this and that and you can use your mind what I'm trying to tell you uh churches are built on different different things when you come in here it would look simple and like there's hardly anything because we try to build it entirely on the word of God on the revelation of the word right not on flashes and shiny things or anything of that nature even though we can add that from time to time because you know after while even if you're cooking good food people get tired of the same uh you know you know what I'm saying praise the Lord hallelujah um so that's the point sometimes you you have to add a few things to it just to put some life there but other than that we have based this church and we try to base this church entirely on the revelation of the word so that when you come here you can be built up into a spiritual house for the glory of God amen so that's what this is about God hiding in Simplicity let us pray father we thank you for the word we thank you for the Bible we thank you for the prophet of God that came and gave us insights that we might understand what you're trying to tell us that you might build us up now with this verse before us we ask that you will expand open and magnify that we might have understanding and not only understanding but that it will move us into action we ask your blessing now in jesus' name as we read this together amen amen let us read and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but carry ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from God bless you please be seated as I was come along I pushed in the CD brother Grand was singing I find many people who don't understand why we are so happy and free we have crossed over Jordan toir land and that's what's the matter with me oh that's what's the matter with me praise God that's what's the matter with me i' crossed over Jordan to and that's what the matter with me amen praise God I've crossed over Jordan to came to Spirit land I crossed over from s into the holy spirit amen because Canan uh we use it sometime as a type of heaven but an naturual fact is the type of your receiving the Holy Ghost and still living on the earth and having to fight GS and deal with problems in your life while you're here and God promised that he would give you the victory is that right he promised us he would give us the victory he promised Joshua he would give him the victory he said but nevertheless I will give you the victory you'll overcome the entire uh land of Canaan God give you the victory you will overcome all your problems everything he says but I won't give you the victory in one year or two years or 10 but I will allow you to push your enemies out little by little so that you might know oh it's the Lord do it and not you because sometimes God gives you the victory too quickly and you believe that you got the victory by yourself that's right but he said no I won't give you the victory in few months or in a year but I allow you to push your enemy out that's right little by little amen little by little heing my way little by little my night turns today when I think of the Savior and what he has done little by little I am praising God's son amen little by little he's pushing out things out of your life you might not even recognize it but he's pushing things out of your life and you're changing by the grace of God hallelujah so I'm so glad about this now the background of this text of course is that uh uh first uh one uh they were all walking back to their home and you know the stranger appeared out of the bushes and began to talk to them just like the prayer of fire appeared out of the Bush and talk to Moses and so there it was that they got back the stranger what the stranger was saying was so uh it had a pull to it uh it pull them so they said listen you it's late in the evening you can't go on have to come in and stop with us is that right praise God I believe that's what God wants from all of us amen Lord come in and stay with me live in my heart live in my life I want you to live in my soul and be my house be your let me be your house let me be your habitation the place that you dwell and so he stopped in with them and the Bible tells us that uh they were going to eat and while they were about to eat Jesus broke the bread in a certain way and they recognize it I believe some of you recognize the way he breaks the bread even now amen you may not even recognize that you recognize how he broke that bread but just visited national Church wow and you will know the difference in how he broke the bread and how they breaking the bread is that right they can break the same bread but this is different when he breaks the bread praise God hallelujah amen so they recognize him in the opening of the word they recognize him the way that he was opening the word was not natural it was Supernatural it was God doing the opening of the word and then he came down later and he says to them but you are witnesses of these things and I will send the promise of the of my father upon you Hallelujah that's not the Father's Promise he's telling you telling them I'm going to send a promise of my father my father is the promise in other words the way the father dwell in me he's going to come and dwell in you and I'm sending to you the promise of the father who will dwell and live in you but wa in Jerusalem Hold Steady Hold Steady praise the Lord have a church home have a place where you re receiving the word and Hold Steady amen because every one of us is not going to receive this promise on the same day but we're going to receive it in God's time in the fullness of time God said for his son and God will send that promise upon you at the right time as I've always said no feel like some preachers will come visit this church another church another church they see one believer cardal somebody doing something else this one this one not dressed right that one and they say oh look at that preacher allowing this to happen in this church you don't understand you can't even go in a field out there and see all the fruits right rening on the same day it never happens and that's why we who are strong have to have compassion and humility for those that are weak because they they are where you were and they not coming along they may have they may just push their head out of the egg and they're covered with fil they're covered up with all kind of slime and everything else amen and it's going to look as oh that one is slimy or this one my God I'm seeing the same thing you were seeing but the fact is you got to understand people are at different levels of growth and they're coming out they're emerging by the grace of God hallelujah you know it's wonderful brother B was such a wise man think about it that he had the gift of being a prophet and he could see everything in our life but if he wanted to he could make every one of us run out of this church is that right what are you doing in here this that that that what what are you doing this that that what are you you know but no that's not the way it works when in the handling of these kinds of things God lets you know things but he lets you know for a purpose amen and then he has to reveal that proper purpose to you praise the Lord anyway here we find it brothers and sisters that he said we should wait on the promise of the father what I want to talk about today is uh backgrounding off of what was the Holy Ghost given for but I want to say the purpose of the Holy Ghost why you receive the Holy Ghost and why God gives us the Holy Ghost amen now we have a problem in the messes churches and the problem in the message churches and in every church but mainly in the M churches and what I want to uh uh speak about is that a lot of people are still so caral and they still don't have the Holy Ghost and the ones that don't have the Holy Ghost are usually the ones that have a always have a problem or making a problem creating problem because the eyes not open to fully see and when your eyes are open to see then you recognize where you're going and you stop bumping into things and so that carnality is in amongst the people because a lot of the preachers have convinced the people just by saying oh I believe the message that they're born again oh my uh brother says you are not even born again until you have received the Holy Ghost he say not converted until you receive the Holy Spirit matter of fact let me uh go right out of here unless it's thought that I'm making it up or something like that no he said it clearly in here that you're not even converted until you have the Holy Ghost amen praise God all right you are not converted page 15 until you have received the Holy Ghost amen before that you are believing unto you may have spoke the Holy Spirit might have spoken to you you may have publicly confessed him but the Devil Himself has gone that far and we even tell you I believe amen he will say I believe him to be the Son of God and so does the devil believe that see but when you're in that state you are only walking towards him see amen you must receive the Holy Ghost to be fully converted praise be to God and that's the problem a lot of people believe being around the message being in it long enough uh believing what the prophet said holl that that's uh that is what it is to be filled with the Holy Ghost sir but to be filled with the Holy Ghost is to receive the revealed word of God for your day and then he says to act upon Hallelujah in other words that word is going to bring an experience in your life you're not going to just go around and say I'm seeing the word I'm seeing the word that's good but you got to have an experience along with it and a lot of people are lacking that experience because the the devil has used a lot of ministers to put a scarecrow in the minds of the people to think that the Pentecostal experience something is wrong with it nothing is wrong with the Pentecostal experience all we have now is the word that should have been added toight amen praise God listen brother said if Lu was still around he would have received message and if Wesley was still he would receive the go message and if the real jary all time Pentecostal were still around they would receive this message praise God hallelujah they would receive it glory to God and now we want to throw out the baby with the back water amen because the prophet of God said is not the inial evidence of the Holy Ghost we TR out the entire Pentecostal experience we thr out the Pentecostal uh experience that is right there available for every one of us praise the Lord how you mean brother you mean to say God can make me speak with thongs yes just like he made the brother the other day speak with T amen oh but not all of us this is the difference not all of us were speak in Tong amen the Bible says to one he give a gift of healing to the next miracles to the next interpretation praise the Lord he interpretation what do you mean I'm going to know all these languages around the world and be able to interpret them maybe that could be one way of it amen but I know certainly uh uh being in a certain meeting and all of a sudden just the same way preaching like that and suddenly God fell on somebody and they spoke out in Tong and here's another person that don't know nothing and before you know it they start shaking they stand up and and they spoke out and it was interpretation of what the other person said see praise God God gives these gifts praise the Lord doesn't mean you're going to go around consciously going and interpreting Tong and languages but the holy spirit will come upon you and you will understand ref me back to the day of Pentecost so I can mention it to you how that when the the apostles were speaking in tongues you know they were speaking in them and yet these men were Hearing in their own language how hear we in our own language up here we know they're talking in some foreign language we know they're talking in a foreign town but but but uh we we understanding them this this is a miracle something is going on here how here we these men in our own language are not all these men Gans and first of all the Gans but they're speaking in foreign Tes amen and yet we are hearing them in our own language praise God hallelujah oh how blessed it is amen friends first of all I want you to know we should not be afraid of the Holy Ghost amen because a lot of people ask for the Hol Holy Ghost but if they're in a meeting like this and their Fe the Holy Spirit start to come on them amen they may feel the Boose BS they may feel their hair standing on them they may feel like getting up and jumping they may feel like doing something but we are not the religion of repression or depression or oppression amen whom the God sets you free the son of man set is free inde am amen we have to enter into the Glorious Liberty of the sons of God but sometimes we appear in church as if we more bound than anything else when you were out in the world there and the party start and the music start up you didn't sit down in your seat in a corner like a wall flower you were looking to be the first one out on the floor and then you're showing your shots you know I mean your foot slipping and sliding and you're showing your various shots like that praise the Lord but somehow when people come into church and they come in the house of God they start to feel like they're being B up amen they got lock job M they got ball and chain on their foot and they Shackled in their hands and they they can't even praise God to say hallelujah I mean the was let's praise the Lord that's go praise the Lord you mean you might as well be a robot you might as well be a robot because you're doing just like you told instead of it being genuine out your heart praise before you catch yourself Hallelujah before you can think amen that's right amen you are standing in the presence of the Living God and God is watching and waiting for your action for his reaction am praise the Lord and that's why we are in the house of the Lord here because we want to be open to the supernatural you want to be open to anything God will do in your life praise the Lord if God wants me to stand on my head I'll stand on my head it's like the man said if he tells me jump through that wall and jump through the wall it's his business to make a hole in the wall but I'm going to jump praise the Lord I believe our biggest obstacle is fear and prayer we fighting against still and we fighting against pride pride because we think more how we going to look instead of how we going to glorify God and give him the glory to his name and so we hold back and we save it up for another day amen God don't want you to save none of this manner up he wants you to eat it right now I use it for the glory for the glory of his name and so I believe there are obstacles in the message why people people are are afraid to praise God and and to act Pentecostal Hallelujah we not going back to Pentecost that is dead amen we not going back to this father it's de but the original one the apostles had he said if the tree ever puts forth another Branch it will have to be exactly like the original amen that means we got have what they have amen praise the Lord hallelujah and if we don't have it we are coming short somewhere amen coming short somewhere yeah you thought you got your best but your best is not come up to God's word we got to come and line up exactly with God's word amen hallelujah that when we walk through these doors we are expecting Miracles we're expecting Mir I don't me I mean everything God wants to do we you got to come in waiting for the preacher to pray for you on come on you got to come in here believeing that when you come in the atmosphere of the holy spirit it's just like when step in the pool of Sil and when the Ser over in the walk out you don't realize your pay problem situation wisd Hallelujah come problem and while you're sitting in the service all of a sudden bang God you the wisdom of what to do who to talk to or what supposed to take place you don't think that's Supernatural That's Supernatural that's why we're here in the house of the Lord we here to be seen or to be heard we want him to be glorified we want him to be lifted up I want to lift him higher I don't know about you but I'm crying out every day now in this new year God give me a personal pente Revival let be the Amen brother BR talked about the man that went to Wales and said oh I heard even Roberts have a Revival down here where's the revival going on the man said where's the Revival he said I am the Revival the Revival is in me the Revival is in you in other words if every one of us get that Revival we have a genu Revival every one of us hallelujah hallelujah lot of churches sitting there and wait for the pastor to push the church he's the shepherd so so he he always have to be revived but you know all I have to do is make sure I'm come and pay my tith and come to church and read my Bible and be a good Christian and that's all God requires of Me no God going require that of you he wants you to have that same Revival Spirit the prophet had the preacher has you got to have that same spirit of the Holy Ghost on your life and in your life that you're coming in the house of God with a life amen you must carry a spirit of life with you if a BL is De you walk in you bring life everyone of us quick amen by the spirit that dwells in you now who is this Holy Ghost we're talking about the Holy Ghost is not some ghost floating around the place the Holy Ghost is not a zombie the Holy Ghost is not your ancestor that you go and pray to no the Holy Ghost is not one of the Catholic saints up on the wall the Holy Ghost is God Amen the Bible said and he when he was on calary he saidon and he gave up the ghost amen it was God the father that was in him that he gave up so that the Holy Ghost can come back down on us am except the corner we fall in the ground it abides alone but if it goes into the ground it multiplies itself amen what was he talking about the breaking up of the pillar of fire to come into each believer's life amen each one a part of that Pillar of Fire and he symbolize it on the day Pentecost in the first church to show us that this is what's supposed to be with all of the other True Believers down Through the Ages he showed the literal purifier where you could see it back there but we may not literally see it here but you did that so you understand what's happening to you right so then later now the Holy Spirit comes to fill us and take over our lives and control us for his glory and praise on and until we get to that that place where we abandon ourselves and say Lord lead me and guide me for what where the sons of God are amen the sons of God they're led by the spirit of almighty God Amen so the Holy Ghost is God himself God in you and God in you gives you the victory in every matter listen to brother Bram once he was God over us amen God over us but is God With Us now God in us God came into Christ and all Christ was has now come into the church what is it God now working in you so the holy spirit is set for the purpose of God living in his church moving through each ede working out his Divine will God himself dwelling in the church to continue his plans through the church that's what the purpose of the Holy Ghost is amen amen so God working in and through every one of us sends the Holy Ghost for that purpose that he might work through us and dwell in us the works that he did in him he wants to drew in her amen amen that means they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen is that right you believe that amen praise the Lord how many you believe in laying hands on the sick amen and they shall be come you can believe in lay hands on the sick but do you believe when you lay your hands on the sick that they shall recover am okay how many of you actually doing that when your children are sick when your neighbor is sick when friends family and workmates are sick things like that uh the first thing is um why don't you take the aspirin why don't you go to the doctor well we know they can do those things and we may even pray for them and still tell them to do that because even though you pray for them not for me but for them their faith is still on those things right so I may still tell them oh go ahead take the take your aspirin or do whatever but I believe God pray I pray for you God is going to work this out his glory amen praise the Lord what I'm saying here is the purpose of the Holy Ghost is that we continue the works of that God did in Christ he now wants to do in US amen so read the three years of his life here the deatha and the d The Blind the sick the this one that one you see but when you get yourself mixed in there and think oh if I pray for this and this don't happen it you starting to think it's you doing it and when you think like that you're going to always be embarrassed to pray for people because you going to thinking about if it don't happen is that right listen to the prophet he said God said it and I'm going to lay my hands on the sick and even if a thousand people fall on dead after finish praying I will still lay my hands on the sick am because he said they shall recover amen it's his business to know which ones he want to recover and the on he doesn't want to recover amen that is my business my business is the I come the amen and believe God's word and that's what you and I are supposed to do don't just come in here and sit and expecting that Pastor is the only one from be laying hands on the sick you see a brother or a sister that is sick in Grace under the leadership of for the Holy Ghost amen you can talk to them quietly and say brother I feel led to lay hands and pray for you over this sickness God show me this and I'm going to lay hands on the amen praise the Lord hallelujah and then you going to watch and see God working signs of Wonders of Miracles right amongst us amen amen I'm transferring what is on mean to you I'm telling you it's not for me alone is for you amen but it's not going to happen unless you act on the way it has to be that every one of us start doing this yes and when you start doing that it'll Touch The Sinner out there it'll touch the unbeliever out there and they'll want to know something's going on Amen just like on the day of Pentecost we hear a noise something is happening and you w have to worry about about people coming to the church or coming in the church or wanting to know about the church that God's greatest virous man is the supernatural working through his people am Hallelujah is all right yes praise the name of the Lord you can have a marketing campaign and bring up stuff and all like that and that's good but God's greatest advertisement is the supernatural of his people amen hallelujah one day the Holy Ghost fell on them and the Bible says 3,000 Happ to the church is that right one day they had a prayer meeting an old fashioned prayer the ones we have today where we pray a little s prayer and we think that's good enough but they really praying in the presence of God and the Bible says and when they had prayed the the house was shaken praise the Lord glory to God in the West Indies in certain parts of the world have bu houses on steps what he's telling you the house start Dan it was on the steps and and and the steps were moving and shifting amen the house was shaken amen the Bible said the Pharisees and the Sadducees and thousands were turned to the Lord GL to God you believe God still able to Hallelujah still God amen amen praise the Lord I believe it and I believe it I was down in South Carolina amen and while there this brother had a church uh brother Jackson and I can call his name he can go down to South Carolina now and he's there ministering in the message he had about my wife was there there brother Peter was there there was about we had about maybe 30 40 people inside of little little garage or whatever there and they were having service and he invited me now so we preaching the word of God and what I'm preaching the word of God simple like this preaching the word of God and that's I love that because then they know clearly it's not me all of a sudden the Holy Spirit dropped down praise God God hallelujah oh when it dropped down people started falling on the ground shouting screaming praising God giving God the glory the next thing you know instead of it confining itself in The Little Garage when we looked out there was people on the street outside with their hands of it was dropping on them the next thing you know a drunk man that was out there passing by it grabbed him and he ran into the church T himself at the altar start to repent about his drugs and his Dre and everything else and God's spirit start to move and people started coming out amen coming out from everywhere and looking with amazement what what is going on I'm short the brother has a church now church with a building and has May I'm telling you the same God is alive and he is with us in the world but you are not going to be able to extract the the potentials and power that is in the word by just saying you believe it and being around it and talking about it or or persuading people about it or trying to use the word as an argumentative thing to prove to them that we are right what proves to them we are right is when that word goes into action and it takes you God come down to make you his house so he can act through you and demonstrate to them that he is still alive that he's not dead but he's risen from the grave and you are a witness to the resurrection not by talking about the resurrection but by demonstra that he resurrected in Meen Hallelujah Same Spirit that rais Christ from the de quick the by the spirit of God amen hallelujah amen you are the witnesses of the Resurrection amen hallelujah yes sir so God wants to continue his work that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost to continue his work through US amen like that glory to God Amen and when you start to have that the devil is going to make fun of you that's the way that he calms down and ques down some people to pull back out of that Spirit of Revival and anointing it's by making fun of them using people to shame them yes are using people to uh put them in a place of embarrassment or or CAU some scripture and said don't you even know this scripture that scripture and then throwing out scripture that scripture yeah may not know the scripture I don't have memory for remembering all that scripture but I know God Amen Hallelujah that's the important thing you need to know God and know him what in the power of his resurrection Fellowship of his suffering hallah brother said I'm afraid we are leading people towards a greater knowledge we leading them to a a new a better a new form of government we the different things but we to bring the people first to First with Christ that they have to admit J that life forever more the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah hallelujah I believe that with all my heart amen I believe that God is still alive us he's B they'll make fun of you amen listen he said they're going to make fun of you he said if they made fun of him that sent you blessed are you when men shall say all manner of things evil against you faly for my name sake blessed are you all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution but when God make himself known in Christ they hated him amen and who hated him worse the religious
