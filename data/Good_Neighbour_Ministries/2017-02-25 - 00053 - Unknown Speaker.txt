========================================
this is a Bible study supposed to be a Bible study right so let's take our time let's read for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God Everlasting father Prince of of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David upon his kingdom to order it to establish it with judgment with Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this praise God hallelujah Jeremiah 3:50 now I'll read that uh and I will give you pastors according to my heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding and then Ephesians 4:11 and he gave some Apostles some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers Hallelujah father we thank you for the reading of your word we pray a blessing upon this few remarks we're about to say and we pray that you will oh God just uh Anchorage in the hearts of the Saints we ask it in Jesus name amen please be seated what an exciting time to be alive now they're having a lot of um I don't want to call it fireworks entertainment Amusement a lot of political upheaval whatever going on right now especially in the United States and around the world Amen and um we find out that uh uh governments everywhere are at a loss they don't know what to do they're absolutely in confusion and don't know what to do um I just thought i' touch on God's government of his church that's why I read the scripture the government shall be upon his shoulders that he would govern his church as you know when the world started in the Book of Genesis that God's uh government was um in the words of brother Aubrey who preached the great message off of this Pulpit uh God's fake civilization that God's government was by governed his people by their faith and by their love they followed him because they loved him because they believed in him and they followed his word that's Adam and Eve that was God's government that was sitting there uh but of course Satan always gets in the U mix or mix and um sub tries to subvert God's government and he sub well you know God said you know uh God said this or God said that in other words think for yourself come on uh you need to think for yourself I mean you're just going to be listening to whatever God tells you and run around uh at his Beckham call instead of listening to God uh listening to your own heart but to follow your heart is to be your heart of man is of deceiving the Bible says and it's full of evil and wickedness so he's got to follow your heart you can't follow your head which is intellect so you can't come under those governments you've got to come under the government of God amen amen praise Lord but you see the first natural government of man of course we know Satan is the architect of government he's the God of this evil age and the Bible tells us in Matthew I think it's four um how that he took Jesus up on the mountain and uh they caus him to look out and and said look all these nations look at all this uh if you Bow Down and Worship me I can give give you it all and the prophet said Jesus didn't dispute his claim that all these governments are under his control and all these rulers are under his inspiration and he can Inspire them to do whatever he wants them to do uh as such so we find out that when we go back to the Book of Genesis the first government that was ever set up was uh was uh nimod Nimrod is the first one that started to organize people into groups and Battalion he first got the idea of creating weapons and bows and arrows and Spears and then to uh put people into groups and put captains over them and so on like that and that way when he went to war he because the other nations didn't know anything about that as yet he he could defeat them easily and you know that he also is the first one to set up a city right set up a city and uh later on you know about the Tower of Babel according to dispensational teaching that would be called uh human government coming into being human government coming into being it's the Genesis of human government and so therefore we we find out the evolution I'm talking about natural government and Supernatural government one is God's government and the other one is man's government right so we see therefore that uh for 6,000 years from that time to now man has been trained to or Satan through the instrumentality of C man has been trying to establish a government better than that of Michaels better than that of God he's always trying to outdo God and to produce something better uh and so uh dumb to realize that he's a creation God is the Creator and how is he ever going to come up with something better than his creator but never less that is the insanity of sin it blinds it binds it grinds and it destroys everything and every person that holds on to it and that's where why the devil will find his end in the Lake of Fire right because he does not recognize or does not want God to take control and for 6,000 years he has had he's been experimenting in trying to develop a better government than God's government that's right and you have heard brother BR I'm not going to fire you with a whole bunch of quotes but I'll just paraphrase where brother gr talks that how these governments have evoluted naziism fascism right he talks about the Holy Spirit teaching him about these uh these uh very isms communism socialism right capitalism it's all here they've been experimenting with all that the experiment with what the experiment with uh dictators they experiment with having a council running countries and now the world is caught up with um democracy right democracy not my word but the prophet every single one of them will fail because that is man form of government that he is shaping because uh Satan is trying to do that to produce uh a better form of government than God that's right and of course we take it to another level and we understand that's the reason why he's going to have one world government right that's what he's working to with his various experiments of these different forms of government is to bring it to a Apex or bring it to a conclusion um where he has the what he thinks is the perfect government with an amalgamation of all these uh various forms that he's been experimenting with through these 6,000 years now that's what he's doing but we know that God's government of his people is is uh all his governments are going to fail but God's word in the Bible says clearly that after they all fail Jesus will come right amen and this is what Isaiah is speaking about of his government there shall be no end which is the say all the other forms of governments will End Amen everyone is going to come for Absolute Total end but God's form and structure of government will never end and God's government is by Jesus Christ amen and Jesus Christ is the revealed word amen so while we are in this form physical body in a natural world God chooses to govern his church by his revealed word amen that's right we follow him and we are governed by his the tenants of our faith or Revelation what is revealed to you in other words you can't act upon something that's not been revealed to you right you can't live higher than your Revelation that you personally have receiv that's right amen see it's what you reveal to you is what you react to right it's what you live byen some have little fit others have more fit others have more fit have great faith Jesus said it all that's the way it is that's how God governs his life by how much control he has over you through the revealing of his word to your heart amen that's right and then you obey that word yes Lord according to your faith amen according to my faith like you told the man not according to my faith but according to your faith so be it unto you praise the Lord so we understand therefore that God now has his former government and uh to govern his church me reading the scripture there God s in the church he pastors he said Pastors in the church now the one that the word pastor means Shepherd or on the shepherd Jesus tells the parable of a certain man who had great flocks and hers and what did he do he got uh Shepherds on the Shepherds and sent them out this one with a flock here flock there flock there flock there and of course he was typing God and the government of his church under pastoral Ministry and that he would govern the church through the instrumentality of pastors that he sent in the church Hallelujah wonderful I will give you pastors according to my heart amen is that right amen am I really read that right I will give you pastors after they have become qualified from Springfield Missouri or from Moody Bible Institute or from Northwest B college is that right is that how it and then after they have been a Je we orain we will set them into a parish or an area or a region where we believe they can be a blessing to the people no God said I will give you pastors according to my own heart amen hallelujah and the Bible for says God set in church amen that's right he will set them in the church right amen you know all the denominations have it the minister the bishop the pr priest comes and he's only there and then in the middle of that maybe he goes for a year two years and then he said oh where's where's a priest s where's Bishop s oh he's called away to another Parish headquarters tell him which headquarters not the one up there no sir you see but they moved him to another Parish because that's the way the headquarters Works they move him because he's under their Direction but that's the government of man trying to rule God's Church yes Amen in other words the government that was in the world Satan can be trained the church with that and set up a religious system of that same form of government but in a religious way right in the church amen that's why the Bible says that he's so coming after a while he'll end up sitting in the church being worshiped as God Amen when when that uh uh that Spirit of Abomination sits in the Holy Place being worshiped even as God because he's going to creep right in the church and try to take that position in that way but while God is trying to set his men in place God called God train God St amen God calls them first by his Spirit they don't know anything and then he trains them amen praise the Lord hallelujah their school is uh is neology Right lots of prayer un right their school is in the presence of God with the word of God by the burning bush that is their school they learn by experience they learn by the Holy Ghost leading them and guiding them God that is how they learn God called God train God sent amen praise the Lord hallelujah and so pastors of are actually a gift a love gift of God to his church it's like like a man uh giving to his wife a ring or giving to her a diamond or a Jew it's the same thing amen but it's in the form of Not a Human Being like yourself God Like a Stone being set into position set in the church amen pastor set there for his glory and for his honor amen and just like you and I are predestinated vessels to come in a certain age to be used for a certain purpose and in a certain time for his glory he set Pastors in the church that he might have instrumentality to work through within the Church of the Living God Amen Hallelujah man put something there and then telling God that we gave him enough degrees so now you should work through him and recognize him and forget this other one he's just from the backwoods so you know just a wood cutter or some uh storekeeper or something like that no God doesn't work that way amen God works with his own p with his own means and for his own glory amen so God said to the church he said the Pastor in the church that he might use them as instruments for his glory and for his H amen hallelujah let's go back and look in tight now amen how when Israel was in Egypt and Israel came out and you seen it even on the videos the films how they went by the Red Sea and when they were by the Red Sea how Pharaoh tried to destroy them and the pillar of fire came and stood between them and pharaoh and his and later on when they had crossed over the Bible said and he set a pillar of fire to lead them by Night amen and a pillar of cloud to lead them by day praise God hallelujah amen glory to God but you got to watch you have to understand what God's doing brother BR said he says you know that when those the three wise men left their countries not knowing one another each one coming under the influence of of his star do you know how he was born coming in the same direction their paths are going to cross they're going to meet because they headed the same place to see this child or this King that was born he said and while they moved on the earth the stars were moving in the heavens or as the stars move in the heavens they move on the earth amen now we we our lives are not led by horest hope but brother said that was the first Bible that was up in the sky and uh you're influenced uh still by these things but our eyes need to keep on the word and not on horoscopes that right and astrology but we know that there is influence there he said when those stars move up in the heavens these men were moving on the earth and then when the three men met and they came together those three stars up there become one great big star am amen Venus Jupiter and Mars are one one of the other they just come together like that for one big star praise God hallelujah so while the pill of fire was moving in the heavens and the P Cloud moving in the heavens and all the children of Israel are looking at that and saying w we led by the holy spirit all we have to do is to obey the cloud they never realize that he had a representative on the earth so that he who was in the P of fire can come and use that man's voice and use that man to as the instrument that he might speak through them so uh Pharaoh didn't understand that when he said who is your god that I should listen to him or whatever and the voice spoke out of Moses and said I am that I am that was too much for him he couldn't understand that right and that's the same thing happened with Jesus but when Jesus said it list and you being a man makest thyself God you see but it wasn't that he was making himself God in Jesus's case he was God and one man came to brother BR and and said something like that you are are you the Christ are you the Christ or whatever he says you're not too far wrong he didn't he didn't just brush the guy away he said you're not too far wrong amen because Christ means anointed for one anointed to be here for this hour so that the Holy Spirit has a vessel to FL true Amen to minister to you and then uh this is why a lot of people don't understand in a church you don't just jump all around maybe when you didn't have Revelation and understanding your heart and you were still searching for something and you had to go from church to church place to place because it still wasn't satisfied something in you was not satisfied and you were still moving like that right but you know once you met your genuine pastor and that those spirits come together like that spirit with spirit will me and once they've come together like that is separate amen right again listen to how brother person that your pastor your pastor is the husband to the church spiritually speaking Amen in other words it's like a woman that's married to her husband she do oh today I love you tomorrow I don't love you and she just runs off and goes to another man's house and then the next year you know she's gone to her next house I don't like his another no it doesn't work that way it's because some of those people don't know the real spiritual implications of what it is to say this is my church this is my pastor amen denominations are so watered in down that the sobriety the seriousness and the sacredness have B right out of it that's right amen and people just think that oh it's nothing if I just kill off uh Pastor L and walk out if I tell the preacher off and I walk out whatever that's what happen with most of the young people today instead of working things out is that true amen instead of really sitting down and and talk about it or have a mediator and let things be settled the first thing they know is to walk out as if they were General hital that's a old show some of you young might not know that I know what the shows are now but Coronation Street is the last one I think I I heard of that name praise the Lord see so that's what happen right but it's a more serious thing right cuz that Pastor is fitted for you that's right understand that Pastor is fed for you glory to God it's like Paul said he says you may have a lot of people teach trying to teach you but you only have one spiritual father amen hallelujah you can have a whole lot of teachers but you only have one father when you like him or you're not like him still your father that's right and that's the way God said it right well a lot of preachers pass through here a lot of teachers you might hear on the TV the radio whatever like that you only have one spiritual father amen praise the name Hallelujah so uh aot some of them in Moses's group didn't realize that oh they're just looking at God up in the heavens and there are people who talk about the Holy Ghost and just they're going to just follow the Holy Ghost and holy spirit I'll just read my Bible at home and and everything else like that and don't realize the importance of your having a pastoral Ministry brother said you must have a church home amen you must sit under a pastor's Ministry cuz these are ministering Spirits sent down to minister to you who are the ears of Salvation thank you Lord God say it's in his word hallelujah praise God forever more so while the P of fire is moving in the heavens Moses is moving down on the earth is that right and praise God but then you'll find there's always carnal people in the midst as there was in the book of uh Exodus Numbers Deuteronomy the same thing is ret told about three times and I think you'll find it in if you want the chapter Numbers chapter 16 um you'll find it there and then you'll find Jude refers to it again about the gain saying of Kora right but there you find P Kora and usually they leave out the name of another man that was there AB right that was there um and you know they gotten with because Moses was speaking with such Authority that they start to think that Moses was a dictator they start to believe that Moses was some as the one of them said forget which one but he said you come bring us in the willingness to be king over us you want to be king over us or whatever and started to talk like that but that was carnality that was upon him and if you watch the Ten Commandments the other one said come on the way you you're telling us about this Ten Commandments how we going to believe that that come from God when we hear you the one saying You must have take that rock and carve it up there in the mountain the 4 days you were up there and bring it down because you want to make yourself King over us and uh Moses said nothing of the kind amen separate yourself from that kind of thing amen hallelujah so when uh those kinds of spirit are in the church it means that they don't still don't have a real clear revelation of the post pastoral office and what it really stands for right uh praise the Lord and why God placed it and that actually it's a essential element of God's system of governing his church amen he governs his church I'm thinking of a where brother said God could have chose the wind he could have chose any animal anything you want but God chose man to be his agent that he speak hallelujah thank you Lord I mean SP through a dumy he can use anything he wants but the principal agent that you will use is man Hallelujah and that's always stumbl this stumbl the Pharisees when God was in Christ and then he came and and he started speaking and you be a man and and and you're kind of hinting that you are God whatever how can you be you're just a man we know where you were born right but that's the looking at the flesh you don't understand the spirit inside he was the Ancient of Days Amen in a child's body amen praise the Lord so here it is we see the same thing happening now amen of many not having a revelation of the office of the pastor but you see he is a part of God's government on the earth amen is that right one of the principal parts I mentioned Apostles prophets evangelists pastors teachers right but the pastor in the local church is the integral part to govern the Church of the Living God hallelujah now we know that just like the Nations have governments did he nomination and I I I'm saying the word deliberately like that sometimes I say demon Nations but denominations right they take a lot of the uh things out of the governments that are in the world and they brought it over right inside of the church that's righten exactly and they rule the church with that kind of a Iron Fist of government right like that and they are the ones that form what we call Church boards right they form Church boards and we have a church board so I'm not just talking while I'm just give you background and everything else so you understand they the first one form Church of boards and the idea of the church board was to be able to manipulate manage and and curb the power and the authority of the pastor within the local church cuz you see one the denomination is made up they might have 10 churches 20 churches 30 some of some have hundreds some have thousands of churches how are they going to control those churches if they don't have a means of firing cutting off punishing penalizing those FS so what they did was set up the church boards in such a way and flip the coin instead of the pastor being the head of the church and ruling the church they elevate the authority of the church board to rule over the pastor and the church so if the pastor doesn't submit to what the church board wants the church board kicks him out and therefore it creates an created an element where these pastors look at them out there I don't care which one you're talking about they're out there they're ministering carrying out their Ministry the moment their Ministry don't please the people and the people start murmuring they're to is that right they're told the next thing you know is the pastors have now to minister the word and look over their shoulder because they they they're constantly worried about what the board is going to do and what headquarters going tell the board to do right and they're always worrying about that that's a fact right um and and that's the way it is but you see that's not God's former government amen is that right uh I I I I heard a message by the great evangelist called AA Allan who had come out and during the time of brother brand he he he never really got into brother br's message but he had a great miracle ministry worldwide uh just like Tor Roberts a lot of them that were inspired by Brother R uh Jack Cole belma Gardner WB Grant many others they had Miracle Ministries of coming from Brother Grand's influence but they never came into the message as such they just preached Pentecost the gospel salvation and did Miracles and healings nevertheless they were great men and he had left the uh the Assembly of and came out actually he said while he's telling this in his sermon how that the church board came to him and they started to tell him that he had to listen to them and do this as they're told as he was told and this and that he said I just let him out the church they're still running it he said it's busted six times and they're still running it he says and they create an atmosphere where they are now living in a prison with stain glass windows he quite a preacher amen praise God but that's not God's plan amen praise the Lord Church board has its place if it recognizes its position amen and knows how is supposed to be an advisory counsel and help to that Pastor to carry out God's program amen amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen yes sir so uh that's where the pastors have ended up and if you don't believe me go out there and talk to some of those pastors out there never mind how big and successful they look like that their churches are not at piece like this little place we have right they got a millions of things they have to be thinking of they always worried you always have to be looking over their shoulder because they don't know when the should is going to drop is that right they don't even know when the headquarters is going to recall the loan that they gave them to build that church or to do this or to do that amen can you imagine I never found a lot of these things out until when the prophet's message came and I was um asked to get out I didn't say I didn't leave the Bible school they asked me to leave but the fact is at about 18 20 years old um because of the Revival in the town where my wife was the British manager there gave up lot of land to build build a c Church the effects on the life of people but then when a message came and they asked me to leave wow they kept the land they kept it all so that is what they do all the denominations that what they do uh why do you think you see a house of project comes up here and all of a sudden they don't have any membership in that area you know but all of a sudden bang there's a brand new church what do you think they're doing they loan the money to a man that has an Evangelistic kind of ministry or a preacher that they has been with them for years that they know they can trust and they will build the church doesn't matter what the church cost if the church cost half a million milon they build a church and the agreement is that he has to pay that church has to pay back the money to the headquarters right so it's easy for them to just run out and put up a building here put up a building here all the denomination Salvation Army this one that one that's how they operate right Baptist this one that they operate Captain Church same thing so and then they repaying the money but here is the thing about it after they have repa that money the church still belongs to the Catholic Church does belong to the local congregation right it's true that pay for it their name is on it's all still there so what happened how can I pay you back your money and you still own the property see but that's the kind of thing that goes on out there but God never set up that former government right never set that former government up that way so so uh that that's not God's way of doing things praise the Lord now we understand here that um um some pastors are just so scared by the church like some men that scared of their wives they just sit in their position and do as they're told please I'm just using types right I'm not saying that there's anybody like that here but I'm using the typ but I've literally seen men that their wife just talk to them literally what real woman wants a husband like that how is he going to protect you or I mean why would you want to literally emasculate your husband to the he can't even protect you then little L he can't protect himself want to do that of course we are to respect our lives with all that is been done us we are to respect us and many times when they say something to us or they tell us something or ask us to do something then we do it but you do it not because you're scared that's right you love you do it because because you love them you do it because it makes sense you do it and sometimes it don't make sense and you still do it but the fact amen praise the Lord God is good Hallelujah but to think of a fastor sitting in a church and I I know what I'm telling you because I've seen it Monday uh the church or the church court tells him you stop doing this you don't do that anymore do that and do this do that he doesn't line up with that he's out of there they just kick him out so fast that's not the former government that God set up within this message am amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen they will tell you what to preach and when to preach at Easter you will bring certain kinds of messages and at this certain time of the year we need these kinds of messages and he has to stay within those B they will even tell him how to manage the church's money the way he sto MH and therefore they always look so as if they are systematic as if they're so disciplined everything looks like in order that's how it looks and it is but it is not because of love for God it's not because of faith and confidence in the minister it's because they set up rules and regulation within the church right and they even will have this one spying and that one SP on the other one SP on the other one so that everything is kept in order that's not the way God does it in his church amen that's not the way it is according to his word uh let me uh you know what let me give you brother BR speaking because some people would say oh that wasn't the voice of God that was just from the S talking so that's okay the kind of man we need today uh we need man that's been to the burning bush that's the kind of man we need today in the government and in the church in times like these for leadership today we need man that's filled with the Holy Ghost amen praise the name of the Lord that's out of the message called why now remember your pastor our brother Neville he is the full head of the church and brother nille has the right to exercise any Authority that the Holy Spirit would anything the Holy Spirit would tell him to say in other words in this church he has the right to do anything God would lead him to do exactly which means he has the right and authority over his Deacon board absolutely and he the pastor can change that Deacon board those trustees the pist or any office within that church that he desires to change amen that's right let by the Holy Spirit to do so and whatever he does I recognize it God recognize it and will the same Hallelujah see people don't even people don't understand Supernatural brother preach a message called angry prophet he said imagine the prophet was angry which was wrong he shouldn't have got angry but he said God still fulfill his word and wipe out those children that were mocking right calling in bald head and all kinds of stuff like that he shouldn't be angry in the first but he says God is obligated to that man because he set him in the office of a prophet that's right amen he's obligated to man whether right or wrong he's obligated to that man and so he says any office he has the right uh to even switch positions with of people and move them around within the church he ask the authority to do that I trust that the church will always be lovely and that those that Authority would never have to be used but God has given them the power to do that amen hallelujah all right I'm not going to finish that quote but I just want to share now these men who try to do right is the man is the men that our natural government tries to tear to pieces that right I want and then he spoke here just like Samuel Moses Moses said it to D and cor said which one of you go secretly Anointed The conv and asking for money or begging for something or try to pull some trip which one of you said the same thing said why would you not listen to what I'm telling you which one of you he said I stole your sheep or took your hers or or do this or do that any one of you said just come now he says nobody you heard brother brand said and I believe I not believe I said the same thing even the whole congregation was here who in here did I borrow money from what do you borrow money or ask you for money or trick you out of money or pull some why would I do that but he says here amen say they try to tear that man into pieces right and then he says I want anyone someone to look me in the eye and tell me if I ever beat anyone out of anything or stole anything from them in my life by the grace of God I am clear M that means no more to them you're saying that than the snap of your finger if they are carnal they'll still believe you are guilty somehow and that you are a dictator in your church and that when you snap your finger your church does what you tell them to do they believe something is wrong with that they don't understand the difference in somebody OB true love and true Revelation and those who obey through fear they don't understand the difference praise the Lord Brother BR says how unjust can a man be think about it they accus me you gave people gifts when the House burn down there's checks where you give widows hundreds of dollars pay the rent done things like that sir he says to brother brand this is the government investigator did you go to your church board and tell them that you are going to do such and such and spend that money there I said no sir he says why didn't you he says because I'm the pastor and the Lord told me to do it the Lord told me in his word to do it and to don't let your right hand know what your left hand is doing oh now you're trying to plead your case in this court by the Bible the Lord but we are judging you by the law listen to brother Bron sir may I ask you which is the highest law man or Gods I'll take God's law and that's how the case ended you know the story he won the case and they ended up having to repay him uh maybe like $100,000 or whatever because um those were like donations that he was made so they had to give it back to him praise the Lord Jesus hallelujah it's 59 I'm going to start this up here praise the Lord now brother Robertson is the chairman of the trustees and brother Collins is the chairman of the deacon board now the trustees ought to have an office of their own and the deacons ought to have an office of their own and if you have a Sunday school superintendent that person has to have an office of his own whether it's his or her amen but the pastor is the head of the
