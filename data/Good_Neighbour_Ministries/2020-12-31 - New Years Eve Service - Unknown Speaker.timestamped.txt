[5:04] praise the lord let me read this
[5:06] yeah i know what it is
[5:10] god bless you all um we're um
[5:15] uh here tonight the reason why we have
[5:18] these music is because if everybody was
[5:20] unmuted it would be
[5:21] something called chaos and we don't want
[5:24] chaos we want
[5:24] just smooth uh transition and everything
[5:27] like that
[5:28] so there will be times when we do on
[5:29] youtube and um
[5:32] so we'll let you know okay so don't if
[5:34] you press on you
[5:36] we gotta press mute again and uh that's
[5:39] that's why that's what was happening
[5:41] there
[5:41] so it was a game you were pressing on
[5:43] youtube you're pressing them
[5:46] anyway so anyway welcome everybody to uh
[5:49] good neighbor ministries the
[5:51] new year's eve service uh what a
[5:53] blessing it is to

[5:58] you know this is lockdown new year's eve
[6:01] service
[6:02] we're in lockdown we are not supposed to
[6:04] have anybody in the house and we can't
[6:06] go to the church
[6:07] but praise the lord anyhow we get
[6:09] together like that
[6:10] so we have um i don't know how many
[6:15] different let's see we got the
[6:21] well well over 30 35 uh
[6:25] 26 okay my family's around at least 26
[6:27] people are
[6:28] are in at the moment and they will more
[6:31] will come and
[6:32] will see how i the number goes but first
[6:35] of all
[6:37] um we just want to mention a few things
[6:41] about
[6:42] uh how we're going to operate this all
[6:44] right
[6:45] so first of all if everyone who
[6:49] is in can turn on their cameras
[6:53] right we know that there's a few cameras
[6:55] that are on high games like you see a
[6:58] few other ones let's see looks
[7:01] not
[7:14] this available uh we will be
[7:16] spotlighting
[7:18] all right what that means is um your
[7:21] picture
[7:22] what you see of me everybody's gonna see
[7:24] a view
[7:25] for a few seconds as we go around and
[7:28] let everybody see you and give it a
[7:30] thumbs up like this
[7:31] what happened there okay give it a
[7:34] thumbs up or you can say hi
[7:35] um wave hi whatever you want to do um
[7:39] and that way you'll be seen and
[7:41] spotlighted
[7:42] so if your camera's not on you won't be
[7:44] spotlighted so
[7:45] we want to see everybody and enjoy
[7:47] everybody's uh atmosphere impressions
[7:49] we want to bring uh brother daniel
[7:52] can you bring both danny out boys
[7:58] hi brother danny hey how's it going
[8:03] real good man it's good to be here
[8:07] god bless you yeah this is wonderful
[8:10] this is um you know what it's the next
[8:12] best thing that we could have
[8:14] for uh getting together as uh
[8:17] sons and daughters of god at such a time
[8:20] as this
[8:21] so i just want to thank uh
[8:24] our young people and our audio and
[8:27] visual
[8:28] uh experts uh for taking the time to put
[8:32] this all together because i believe
[8:34] it'll be a real blessing for us
[8:35] to be able to go into the new year
[8:36] together
[8:39] so brother danny is going to uh co-host
[8:42] this
[8:43] uh event with myself so we will be able
[8:46] to talk back and forth and comment and
[8:49] you know have a great time in the world
[8:52] and with all of you so
[8:55] one very important thing this is a big
[8:58] night
[8:59] um not just a big night for us but it's
[9:01] a big night for
[9:02] everybody and we have been told
[9:06] that uh probably most of the world
[9:10] will be on the internet tonight doing
[9:12] what we're going to be doing
[9:14] at some point tonight so what does that
[9:17] mean
[9:18] the possibility is uh really exists
[9:22] that uh the internet companies will not
[9:24] be able to handle what we're really
[9:26] uh like before because it's
[9:28] unprecedented so
[9:30] um if we do lose you if the whole thing
[9:34] topples over i'm trusting it won't but
[9:36] if it does
[9:37] the servant card can be seen starting at
[9:40] 11 o'clock
[9:41] on our youtube channel that part is
[9:43] guaranteed okay
[9:45] that'll be that'll be there in case we
[9:47] lose you
[9:48] 11 o'clock you don't hear past your
[9:50] signing bring the message right into the
[9:52] new year okay
[9:54] but in the meantime um we're gonna carry
[9:57] on with this
[9:58] if you have a um a speaker did i say
[10:00] this already
[10:01] well if you have a speaker um it would
[10:04] be a good idea to plug in the speaker
[10:05] because
[10:06] because some of our pre-recorded um uh
[10:09] specials and whatnot are a little bit
[10:12] low under volume
[10:13] they're okay it'll be fine you know if
[10:16] you're here
[10:17] it'll be a very a nice addition if you
[10:19] have a speaker event that you can plug
[10:21] into
[10:21] and it'll be it'll be very helpful all
[10:24] right
[10:25] so everybody praise the lord you know i
[10:28] can't see anybody besides myself i hate
[10:29] looking at myself
[10:40] okay so the first thing we want to do
[10:42] believe it or not is that we want to
[10:44] do some spotlighting okay so we're going
[10:46] to play some background music
[10:48] and when your face comes up give us a
[10:51] thumbs up give us a heart if you want to
[10:54] give us uh whatever you want to do
[10:56] but um let's play some a little fun and

[31:52] well without the lord that the lord was
[31:55] appeared to be in two places at one time
[31:57] too
[31:58] so maybe we're just getting more like
[31:59] him but he you know
[32:01] that's just the way we'll move it but
[32:04] god bless you
[32:05] um we enjoyed uh those uh specials and
[32:08] uh now
[32:09] um we're going into the marshes god
[32:12] bless you he's a
[32:14] wonderful person lord praise the lord
[32:17] jesus
[32:19] it is an amazing privilege to be here
[32:21] tonight
[32:22] to have the opportunity to share my own
[32:25] personal testimony with you of
[32:29] the work that god has done is doing
[32:32] and continues to do in my life and for
[32:35] those of you who
[32:37] may not be members of our ministry and
[32:39] have been invited
[32:40] to watch this broadcast and to celebrate
[32:43] 2020 with us
[32:44] as we move into 2021 this is one of the
[32:47] things that our church has always done
[32:49] for the many years that i've been here
[32:51] is that um
[32:52] our brothers let me ask a believer to
[32:54] share
[32:55] for about 15 minutes or so their life
[32:58] story would say
[32:59] a personal testimony and this year the
[33:02] mantle has fallen to me
[33:03] and it's now my privilege and honor
[33:06] really to stand here and to share with
[33:08] you so thank you
[33:10] thank you for being here and thank you
[33:12] for listening
[33:14] i pray that through whatever i share
[33:16] tonight will be
[33:17] all for the glory of god and that
[33:19] wherever you may find yourself in life
[33:22] whatever you may be going through that
[33:24] you may be able to relate
[33:25] and connect with me and my story or
[33:28] perhaps
[33:29] not it may be different to you unique to
[33:31] you
[33:32] but then you're exposed now to someone
[33:34] else's perspective
[33:36] and point of view in the world but
[33:38] through it all
[33:39] you'll see that my background i realized
[33:43] as i
[33:43] considered and contemplated was really
[33:47] quite messy actually
[33:49] to be perfectly honest and glory to god
[33:53] the lord hath brought me from a lot of
[33:55] meth into this message of the hour
[33:59] and so i'll begin to tell you my story
[34:02] my journey of life
[34:03] and the relationships that have been
[34:04] built
[34:06] that's created me and form the character
[34:09] that i have now
[34:11] making me recognize that the most
[34:12] important relationship of all
[34:15] is having a relationship with the lord
[34:16] jesus christ
[34:18] amen so for those who don't know
[34:21] i am originally from jamaica kinston
[34:24] jamaica i was born in
[34:26] and before i was born actually my mom
[34:29] tells me that she was
[34:30] she named me marsha because of marsha
[34:33] brady
[34:34] and the brady bunch and so yeah if you
[34:36] can
[34:37] relate to calendar and the clock you
[34:39] recognize that was
[34:40] smack dab in the middle of the 70s and
[34:43] that's when i came into the world
[34:45] but when i think about myself and my
[34:47] background i realized that although i
[34:49] was named and inspired by marcia brady i
[34:52] did not at all grow up
[34:53] in a typical brady bunch kind of family
[34:57] by upbringing with felt that i ended up
[35:00] actually growing up with my grandparents
[35:02] my mom had me when she was just turning
[35:06] 20 years old and she'd actually had my
[35:08] older brother at that time as well so
[35:11] my mom was quite young when she had us
[35:13] and
[35:15] and that being said what happened then
[35:17] my grandparents
[35:18] after a while uh gave her the
[35:20] opportunity to come to canada
[35:21] so my mom emigrated to canada when i was
[35:24] only eight months old
[35:25] and therefore i didn't have that
[35:28] upbringing
[35:28] with my mother i actually had that with
[35:31] my grandmother and my grandfather
[35:34] my dad was nowhere in the picture as
[35:36] you'd say um
[35:38] the man who god used to bring me into
[35:40] this world which i'm still thankful for
[35:42] anyhow
[35:42] that the lord brought them together and
[35:45] so that i could be here
[35:48] and really thank god to my grandparents
[35:51] um
[35:51] because to tell a little bit more of the
[35:53] story my gran my mother
[35:55] conceived me while on a vacation so to
[35:58] speak
[35:59] so that being said my grandparents you
[36:02] know they could have
[36:03] she was still living at home and so they
[36:05] could have chosen that hey they wouldn't
[36:06] allow her to have a second child
[36:08] because this would be her second child
[36:10] less than 20 years old
[36:12] when she was less than 20 years old but
[36:14] the grace of god amen
[36:16] that was not an option and the lord
[36:18] allowed me to be here
[36:19] right she decided to keep me as her her
[36:22] child
[36:22] and and i came into the world right but
[36:25] that being said
[36:27] unfortunately she decided that she
[36:28] didn't want to have anything with
[36:30] my dad anymore my father and even though
[36:32] as his part of the story goes he tried
[36:34] to connect with me
[36:36] but my mom cut him off so i grew up in
[36:38] my life
[36:39] not knowing my father and i finally did
[36:42] have the opportunity to meet him when i
[36:43] was 16.
[36:45] and that was very emotional if you can
[36:47] imagine
[36:48] but i didn't have the typical as i said
[36:51] mom and dad at home
[36:53] kind of environment and growing up where
[36:56] we lived
[36:56] we lived in the heart of the ghetto
[36:58] right if anyone
[37:00] you know of jamaican background it can
[37:02] relate to jamaica
[37:03] we lived in an area called maxfield or
[37:05] some people say maxfield park
[37:06] because there was a part nearby by that
[37:08] name
[37:10] and i lived there for the first few
[37:11] years of my life in maxfield with my
[37:13] grandparents aunts and uncles
[37:15] and then my grandfather built a home and
[37:17] second home in another area
[37:19] another we'd say you know hardcore
[37:21] ghetto part of jamaica
[37:23] called waterhouse you know but
[37:24] colloquially the proper pronunciation
[37:27] would be water house
[37:28] but we all just call it water house you
[37:30] know and that's where i lived and
[37:33] we moved there when i was maybe about
[37:34] seven years old or so
[37:36] and it was in waterhouse that you know
[37:38] started growing up and elementary school
[37:40] and all of that
[37:41] but again it was you know now i guess
[37:43] we're right into the 80s and
[37:45] it wasn't easy right um the environment
[37:48] that i grew up in was
[37:50] very a lot of violence we were exposed
[37:53] to
[37:53] to be honest um there you could always
[37:56] see any time of the day
[37:58] you know people standing on the corner
[38:01] and being guarded looking out
[38:03] they're trying to see if anybody's going
[38:04] to attack them occasionally i would pass
[38:06] by and see someone stand on the corner
[38:08] with a gun
[38:09] other times you never know when a police
[38:11] cars or or soldiers would
[38:13] come zooming down the street and they
[38:15] would all jump out of their vehicles and
[38:17] have their
[38:17] their their um you know ammunitions
[38:20] their guns
[38:20] out and they'd be chasing after some you
[38:23] know some person some perpetrator
[38:26] so that was you know part of what i grew
[38:28] up in that's what i
[38:29] saw on a regular basis right and
[38:32] personally you know intimately more
[38:35] you'd say in our own home
[38:37] as my aunts and uncles started to grow
[38:40] they started having their own
[38:41] relationships
[38:42] children outside of marriage and then
[38:45] those spouses or partners would come
[38:47] and live in the family home for the
[38:48] family home even though we had some of
[38:50] the family in max field and another
[38:52] family in waterhouse
[38:54] we had for those each aunts and uncles
[38:56] they all had their own relationships and
[38:58] then started having all their children
[39:00] but again no one was married you know
[39:02] and everybody we just lived in a
[39:04] communal kind of
[39:05] environment and so part of that though
[39:08] unfortunately was the witness to a lot
[39:10] of domestic abuse
[39:12] right it was very common for my aunts or
[39:15] uncles
[39:16] you know to unfortunately get in fights
[39:18] and so you would see
[39:19] you know my and as we call them
[39:23] in jamaica too you say baby mother right
[39:25] and baby father right that's the words
[39:26] that we used
[39:28] and so you would see them you know fight
[39:30] in fist fight physical fights abuse
[39:32] my grandfather also even though he was a
[39:35] great provider
[39:36] and he did excellent job in terms of you
[39:38] know building our house as i mentioned
[39:41] and you know providing for the family
[39:43] physically but unfortunately
[39:46] you'd say emotionally very much guarded
[39:48] he wasn't there
[39:49] very much and didn't also for his sons
[39:52] that he brought up
[39:53] so he didn't train them to be good men
[39:56] and
[39:56] good husbands or even become husbands
[39:58] right and even my grandfather himself
[40:01] unfortunately were on with unfaithful to
[40:03] my grandmother
[40:04] and you know had other children outside
[40:06] of their marriage
[40:07] so that's the type of background that i
[40:10] grew up in and
[40:11] didn't get to fee you know as i said the
[40:13] traditional mom and dad
[40:15] type relationship and having your own
[40:17] siblings right
[40:18] and so i would encourage you that if you
[40:21] are so blessed
[40:22] and privileged that you have your
[40:24] parents with you at home
[40:25] your mom and dad you know just that what
[40:27] do we say stable type of environment
[40:29] that's a real blessing because not
[40:31] everyone in the world
[40:32] has that to grow up to grow up in that
[40:34] environment
[40:36] but needless to say you know my
[40:37] grandmother did the best she could of
[40:38] course
[40:39] and she i called her mama because she
[40:41] was my mama she was the mom i had all
[40:43] the years
[40:44] and she did very well by me she ensured
[40:46] that i would continue focusing on my
[40:48] schooling
[40:49] she helped me of course and even
[40:52] spiritually that is too
[40:53] would make sure that i would go to
[40:54] sunday school every sunday and would do
[40:57] focus on my schoolwork my older brother
[41:00] and i
[41:01] and then also she would have me read the
[41:03] bible to her every night and that was
[41:04] also one of my special
[41:06] memories and connection with my
[41:07] grandmother and all of that started to
[41:10] build my spiritual foundation because of
[41:12] course you can't be reading the bible
[41:14] without it impacting you as well so
[41:16] psalm 37 was one of her favorite songs
[41:19] and i would read that to
[41:20] her every night and even in the latter
[41:23] part of
[41:25] her time here on earth so i left jamaica
[41:28] when i was 13 years old
[41:30] and came immigrated to canada where my
[41:33] mom was
[41:34] and finally now have an opportunity to
[41:36] live with my mother
[41:37] but considering that i didn't know her
[41:40] really she came to jamaica
[41:41] only once that i can remember while
[41:44] i was you know while i was there while i
[41:46] was living there because with her
[41:48] condition as well in canada she wasn't
[41:50] able to travel as frequently to say go
[41:52] back and forth
[41:53] so my relationship with my mom at that
[41:55] time was just a visit
[41:56] that she brought she went to jamaica and
[41:59] then
[41:59] also with you know the thing that she
[42:02] would send of course she would try to
[42:03] send things to support us while we were
[42:05] growing up
[42:05] my brother and i there but to me it was
[42:08] a perfect stranger
[42:09] that when i came here at 13 years old
[42:12] all of a sudden now i'm living with my
[42:13] mom
[42:14] and she also now has my sister's dad
[42:16] there living with us and my little
[42:18] sister is born at the time
[42:20] and um although she was not so little at
[42:21] that time she was probably nine or so
[42:24] i bet when i when i came to canada but
[42:26] we were all living together with my
[42:28] older brother
[42:30] and it was not the greatest adjustment
[42:33] right you can imagine you know
[42:34] all of a sudden i've been uprooted from
[42:36] my world that i knew in jamaica
[42:38] now i'm living in canada the culture
[42:40] shock everything is different different
[42:42] environment different family
[42:43] people i don't know there for every
[42:46] reason
[42:46] perfect strangers right because i didn't
[42:48] live with them all these years
[42:50] and so now i had to come to know them
[42:52] right so those years were pretty rocky
[42:55] those first years with my mom because
[42:58] again too
[42:58] i hadn't been trained i remember one
[43:01] moment
[43:02] my mom wanted me to help with the
[43:03] laundry but she didn't teach me how to
[43:05] use the washing machine
[43:07] in jamaica we washed by hand right and i
[43:10] mixed the colors together and i made a
[43:12] mess of the clothes
[43:14] and she came home and she was so angry
[43:16] with me right
[43:17] and it's like you know it's just an
[43:18] example of the arguments you would have
[43:21] because
[43:21] of improper communication right she had
[43:24] certain expectations of me
[43:26] thinking that okay i'm 13 going on 14
[43:28] whatever that she'd expect that i would
[43:30] know certain things
[43:31] but perhaps not recognizing that i came
[43:33] from a completely different environment
[43:35] so it was hard right at first and then
[43:38] what made it even more hard and more
[43:40] difficult
[43:41] was that within a year of me traveling
[43:42] to canada
[43:44] my grandmother passed away right so here
[43:47] my rock my foundation my everything who
[43:49] while i was here in canada would write
[43:51] her letters all the time and
[43:52] we'd call each other but then she had
[43:54] gotten really ill and she passed away
[43:57] so that was really difficult for me and
[43:59] thankfully i was able to travel to
[44:00] jamaica for her funeral
[44:02] but then i also put a little stone
[44:04] between my mom and i because
[44:06] i was angry at my mom saying that hey
[44:08] you could pay for us to travel to
[44:10] jamaica for her funeral to bury her
[44:12] but you couldn't pay for us to go and
[44:14] visit her while she was alive
[44:15] so to be honest my mom and i and those
[44:18] early years when i
[44:20] first came we always were butting heads
[44:23] and if you're in that place right now
[44:25] too where you may be finding you're
[44:26] always butting heads with your mom or
[44:28] you know
[44:28] some other significant adult in your
[44:30] life you know they realize that there
[44:32] are times when
[44:34] when it's all about you know improper
[44:36] communication and lack of and not the
[44:38] right expectations being said
[44:39] right so i've been there thankfully
[44:42] the bridge has crossed and we're
[44:44] definitely relationship has changed and
[44:46] we're very very close my mom and i today
[44:48] but that was the background that's what
[44:50] you know um coming into canada
[44:52] all of a sudden going into high school
[44:54] living with my mom that's what it was
[44:56] so that being said moving along through
[44:59] high school now and um
[45:02] i i met uh you know it was difficult for
[45:05] me because again like i said with a big
[45:06] change
[45:07] but i met a young lady who helped me and
[45:11] she learned that you know we would just
[45:12] sing together in the cafe
[45:14] and so on so then she's like oh you
[45:15] should join the choir right
[45:17] and then i told her that oh no i've
[45:18] never found with anything in any choir
[45:20] or anything like that
[45:22] you know while growing up in jamaica i
[45:23] love singing and i always
[45:25] listen to the radio and you know just
[45:27] try to imitate the artists on the radio
[45:29] and
[45:29] if you can imagine all the popular
[45:31] artists back then and whitney houston
[45:33] was one of my favorites of course
[45:34] i need to bake her of course so it's
[45:37] like if you think of that time
[45:39] the you know whatever top 10 songs were
[45:41] on the radios like what i'll always be
[45:43] singing
[45:44] so that being said though you know she
[45:46] she said no you should really join the
[45:48] choir you have a nice voice
[45:50] so i decided okay i'd go for it right
[45:52] and in grade nine it was a you know
[45:54] beginning of my high school years
[45:56] i uh i joined the choir i was allowed to
[45:59] join the choir
[46:00] and that opened up a whole new world for
[46:02] me because through that it started
[46:03] helping me to build my confidence and
[46:06] and just to explore because i never had
[46:08] those types of opportunities growing up
[46:09] in jamaica
[46:10] to staying with a group to be part of
[46:12] the choir to play musical instruments
[46:14] and things like that
[46:15] so that was really great and then
[46:17] eventually that built up my confidence
[46:19] for drama
[46:20] and i loved acting i'd always loved
[46:22] music and always loved you know acting
[46:24] movies and all of that but again
[46:26] with my upbringing it wasn't an
[46:27] opportunity for me but then in high
[46:29] school
[46:30] it became that right and so i would
[46:33] continue and and participate in
[46:34] different school plays and things like
[46:36] that
[46:37] and even different um uh opportunities
[46:40] to
[46:40] to showcase you know school performance
[46:42] musicals and things like that so
[46:44] that's how eventually my talent started
[46:46] to come out
[46:47] for you singing and for drama and i
[46:50] really
[46:50] loved that i loved it and i decided i
[46:52] wanted to pursue that
[46:54] as part of my life goals and so at the
[46:57] time
[46:58] i continued in high school continued
[47:00] taking a lot of
[47:01] music and drama classes and to the point
[47:04] where i excelled so much that
[47:06] eventually in graduated high school
[47:09] i was given three scholarships right and
[47:11] one of them being a ten thousand dollar
[47:13] scholarship so it was really you know
[47:15] it was a big award right and and then as
[47:17] i you know think back to where i came
[47:19] from
[47:20] being in jamaica and then now in a
[47:21] different environment you know
[47:23] high school was literally just four five
[47:25] years by the time i finished my oaf year
[47:28] so i was able to you know to be
[47:31] ambitious
[47:32] and to to push myself and to study and
[47:35] to be able to establish myself you would
[47:37] say
[47:37] so that by the time i was graduating
[47:39] high school i was no longer the freshy
[47:42] as they would call
[47:42] us fresh off the boat right but i was
[47:45] able to be more confident young woman
[47:47] prepared for university and i went to
[47:50] university to study theater
[47:52] and so i was at york and and that was
[47:56] you know another new world being open to
[47:58] me because again it's a different
[47:59] environment
[48:01] and i hadn't uh i hadn't you know been
[48:04] in the country for very long
[48:06] come to think of it right so by that
[48:08] time i was only in the country for about
[48:09] six years
[48:11] and so university with a whole new world
[48:13] uh one of the things i didn't talk about
[48:15] though is my
[48:16] spiritual part of my transition to
[48:19] canada because
[48:20] when i came here shortly after in those
[48:22] early turbulent years at my mom
[48:24] i my mom was in the pentecostal church
[48:27] though and eventually i started going to
[48:28] church with her and my aunt
[48:30] and before leaving jamaica one of my
[48:33] teachers actually from school
[48:35] had said to me oh when you go to foreign
[48:37] because they call you know canada
[48:38] america they just call it foreign right
[48:41] and they're like when you go to foreign
[48:42] you should go to church that's how
[48:43] you're going to stay out of trouble
[48:45] right so it stuck in my mind that okay
[48:48] if i want to stay out of trouble i need
[48:49] to be at church
[48:51] right so therefore i got caught up in
[48:54] the pentecostal church
[48:55] and was going with them regularly and
[48:57] everything like that and it was a
[48:58] blessing because as i mentioned i'd
[48:59] always grown up with sunday school
[49:01] and there was always an element of
[49:02] knowing god and and seeking god
[49:04] right and so in that pentecostal i think
[49:08] i was about
[49:08] 14 going on 15 at the time i decided to
[49:11] get baptized in that pentecostal church
[49:14] and so for you know for a few years i
[49:16] was there diligently always going
[49:18] to services morning and afternoon right
[49:22] and that's what we did but then
[49:24] eventually by the time i was like 15
[49:26] going on 17
[49:28] you know it was very legalistic really
[49:30] we'd say and with my knowledge at the
[49:32] time it was basically
[49:33] i was in the church just doing what i
[49:35] was told to do i was wearing long skirts
[49:37] because i was told to wear long skirts
[49:39] i didn't have that revelation for myself
[49:42] really
[49:43] i of course because i thirsted for god
[49:45] and i wanted to know god
[49:46] i was doing it you know but because it
[49:49] wasn't i didn't have that anchor
[49:51] it wasn't a revelation to me it was
[49:53] again more on the basis of just doing it
[49:55] to make it the right choice
[49:56] to do the right thing right as i said to
[49:58] do this thing out of trouble
[50:00] right so that was a big part because
[50:02] then eventually
[50:03] i started you know what they say
[50:05] backsliding right you know later on in
[50:07] the high school years by the time grade
[50:09] 11 great
[50:10] by most grade 12 actually you know i
[50:12] started partying here and there
[50:14] going to clubs i'd be you know hiding
[50:16] wearing pants at school
[50:19] and you know wearing this to the skirts
[50:21] when you go to church
[50:22] and you're always being conscious
[50:24] wondering if anybody in the neighborhood
[50:25] you're going to run into any church
[50:26] believers so i've been through all of
[50:29] that as well you know
[50:31] you're basically living a double life
[50:32] now right i
[50:34] was living one life at church and then a
[50:36] different life at school
[50:37] and then eventually you know it was like
[50:39] i was like okay forget about
[50:41] it and as we would say in jamaican ways
[50:43] and i'm broke out
[50:44] right i totally had a breakout and
[50:47] started um
[50:48] just you know partying clubbing just
[50:50] listening to all kind of secular music
[50:52] it wasn't like okay
[50:53] focusing on the lord anymore it was just
[50:55] like okay you know let me just
[50:57] go and have fun right you start thinking
[50:59] that this is the fun thing to do
[51:01] so that being said um through that time
[51:04] that was what i entered university so
[51:06] when i went to university i was no
[51:07] longer
[51:08] you know the church girl as we'd say i
[51:11] was now the party girl
[51:12] really and but i was still focused on
[51:15] school
[51:16] and so with university came along a lot
[51:18] of different
[51:19] influences right and that's where i
[51:21] started dabbling in smoking
[51:23] right because a lot of people around me
[51:25] smoked
[51:26] and they would say oh secondhand smoke
[51:28] is worse than smoking itself so i was
[51:29] like okay
[51:30] so i started bombing cigarettes off with
[51:32] you know this and that each person
[51:34] around me was in theater
[51:35] and theater's a lot of smoking a lot of
[51:38] people unfortunately smoke in theater
[51:40] but then i remember one specific moment
[51:42] though when i was standing i was waiting
[51:44] for my bus because
[51:45] i wasn't driving yet i was waiting for
[51:46] the bus and i thought to myself oh i
[51:48] feel like a cigarette
[51:50] and in that moment it's like no marcia
[51:53] you're
[51:53] like getting hooked on smoking so
[51:56] thankfully i was able to cut it off
[51:57] because i fit to myself no
[51:58] i'm not gonna become like hooked and and
[52:01] addicted to cigarettes right
[52:03] but that was part of my journey i was
[52:05] smoking a lot regularly
[52:07] i would still be drinking my alcohol
[52:09] here and there whenever i'd go out
[52:11] but it wasn't becoming like a regular
[52:12] habit as smoking was when i was at
[52:14] school
[52:15] you know go to school and see everyone
[52:16] smoking you start smoke with them
[52:19] so therefore i had to take consciousness
[52:21] of that and and thank god
[52:22] i did right i was able to change in that
[52:25] moment
[52:26] and say no i'm going to cut it off i'm
[52:28] not going to become addicted so
[52:30] again there's a little note that you
[52:31] know sometimes you find yourself on the
[52:33] journey you're going in the wrong way
[52:34] and
[52:35] and you find yourself being pulled you
[52:37] find yourself being pulled and then you
[52:39] realize that okay
[52:40] you gotta cut it off if you're being
[52:42] spoken to it's come into your heart that
[52:44] that's not the right direction for you
[52:46] then you just listen to that voice and
[52:47] cut it off from there
[52:49] right so as i continued in university
[52:52] in the theater program acting and
[52:53] everything like that it was good
[52:56] but unfortunately uh i was also being
[52:59] aware of you know it was early this was
[53:02] now
[53:03] mid-90s and the lgbt agenda as they
[53:06] would say
[53:07] was starting to become more outward
[53:10] people were more getting out of their
[53:12] closets so to speak
[53:14] so in my theater school and my acting
[53:16] teacher
[53:17] i remember her specifically looking at
[53:19] me and telling marsha
[53:20] you have to convince me that you can
[53:22] love a man as well as a woman
[53:26] and i'm like okay so really she was
[53:29] telling me that i needed to be able to
[53:31] break down my bridges break down myself
[53:33] so that if i had to act
[53:35] in an intimate scene with a man or a
[53:37] woman that i'd be able to do that
[53:40] so in those times i started you know
[53:43] doubting this path of an actor
[53:44] right i started thinking like really is
[53:47] this what i want to do with my life i'm
[53:49] like
[53:50] if i'm doing certain roles what would
[53:52] god think of me so my consciousness of
[53:54] god and awareness of him and his spirit
[53:56] was starting to come back to me though
[53:58] to me during those times
[54:00] and i started thinking that you know
[54:01] what what do you think of the roles that
[54:03] i'm doing that i'm performing right
[54:05] so i realized that you know what it
[54:07] seemed like theater is not going to be
[54:08] for me after all but i was always doing
[54:10] a double major with theater in english
[54:12] and so i continued in my english and
[54:14] political science
[54:15] and at that time too i started meeting
[54:17] different people in university
[54:19] and because i started now started to
[54:22] hunger and thirst for the lord
[54:24] i started exploring and you know i met
[54:27] different people who were in different
[54:28] types of churches different
[54:29] denominations
[54:30] started going with a friend who was in
[54:31] the adventist church and was with her
[54:33] for some time
[54:34] but then met a person who was in a
[54:36] baptist church and i said okay let me go
[54:38] and visit his church and i started
[54:40] visiting all these other churches
[54:42] and when i went to that baptist church i
[54:43] thought it was going to be like a
[54:44] traditional church
[54:45] and to my great surprise those of
[54:47] caribbean descent
[54:49] they can understand when i say it was a
[54:50] poco church
[54:52] right and it's that type of church where
[54:54] the ladies all wrap their heads
[54:56] they have all manner of colors of
[54:58] candles and each candle has a different
[55:00] color and represents a different thing
[55:02] and i have kind of infants burning and
[55:04] everything was very very somewhat
[55:06] traumatic because i've never been in a
[55:08] church
[55:08] like that before and so i was like
[55:11] okay that was my first and last time at
[55:13] that church right
[55:15] i was like no way while i go back but
[55:17] that was part of my experience
[55:19] and then eventually though i met friends
[55:21] who were muslim
[55:22] and they started talking about the quran
[55:24] and they started talking about the
[55:25] prophet muhammad so then i started
[55:27] reading the quran and trying to
[55:28] understand it and
[55:30] what that was all about and it was also
[55:32] making me relate to my afro-centric
[55:34] you'd say
[55:34] element of my of my of my you know
[55:37] history right in our culture
[55:39] but i was just like okay who is this
[55:41] muhammad right
[55:42] but anyways i was exploring i was
[55:44] learning i was seeking i really started
[55:47] thinking to myself
[55:48] that you know what god is real
[55:51] but i don't have a real relationship
[55:52] with him i don't know him for real
[55:55] how do i know him so eventually now what
[55:57] happened is that during that same time
[56:00] as we'd say now we recognize the word of
[56:02] god we say the deep the call to the deep
[56:04] right and the deep will respond
[56:05] so in that time of my life you know in
[56:07] my third year of university
[56:09] that deep within me started seeking more
[56:11] for god and i started like i said what
[56:13] thinking of my future
[56:14] what am i going to do with my life right
[56:17] and
[56:17] um a pivotal moment came when my aunt
[56:21] who lived with us she was having a
[56:22] birthday party and
[56:24] you know she she invited a lot of
[56:26] believers to come on over
[56:28] and then during that time of the party
[56:29] you know i was doing my own thing
[56:31] but eventually they were talking and i
[56:32] started listening and i asked them
[56:34] about the genesis story when the lord
[56:37] said let us make man in our image in our
[56:39] likeness
[56:40] and i was saying to them like that's the
[56:42] trinity right there there's three gods
[56:44] he was speaking to himself and well he
[56:46] was not himself
[56:47] he didn't know it was to himself at the
[56:48] time so i was like he was speaking to
[56:50] the trinity they're saying let us make
[56:52] man in our image and in our likeness
[56:54] and then one of the brothers that would
[56:56] brother mike actually rather mike
[56:58] asari and brother kofi they were there
[57:00] and was speaking to me a lot at that
[57:02] night and they were expounding to me
[57:04] though
[57:04] that god wasn't speaking as a trinity to
[57:07] jesus and the holy spirit
[57:09] when he said let us and when he said our
[57:12] that they explained that god was
[57:13] speaking to himself
[57:14] because we are in him and he had to
[57:17] speak
[57:17] to his own body that in order to get the
[57:20] substance when he wanted
[57:21] you know the fish to he would speak to
[57:23] the water so in order for that substance
[57:25] to come he would need to speak to it
[57:27] so within that moment that was part of
[57:29] my light bulb moment when they said that
[57:31] we were in god and god was speaking to
[57:33] himself and that
[57:35] is part of the creation now he spoke and
[57:38] said let us create man
[57:39] he was speaking to himself to create man
[57:41] into this world
[57:42] and after i heard that i was like wow
[57:46] and i started being more quiet really i
[57:48] started listening more
[57:49] because i'm like okay i've never heard
[57:51] that before
[57:52] and they started hearing what they had
[57:54] to say so needless to say the end of
[57:56] that night
[57:56] um they started praying to dismiss the
[57:59] the uh
[58:00] the dinner party and through the prayer
[58:03] you know the spirit of god really came
[58:04] down
[58:06] and the anointing just fell and everyone
[58:07] just started shouting and worshiping the
[58:09] lord
[58:10] and i found myself on my knees just
[58:13] crying out to god and praying
[58:15] and i didn't even know what was
[58:17] happening but i just in that moment was
[58:19] just crying in tears and was just
[58:21] praying and just asking god to forgive
[58:23] me and i was just seeing the things that
[58:24] i did in my life
[58:26] and was just asking god to help me and
[58:28] to deliver me
[58:29] and in that moment of course i was
[58:30] wearing pants so just dressed as normal
[58:33] but the thought came to me that when i
[58:34] get up off my knees i'm going to be a
[58:36] different person
[58:37] and i said i'm not going to wear pants
[58:38] anymore i'm not going to be wearing
[58:40] makeup i'm not going to do anything
[58:41] things because in my heart at that
[58:44] moment
[58:44] god was just telling me that that's not
[58:46] who he wanted me to be anymore
[58:48] and so that night continued and i felt
[58:50] and i knew i'm like okay i know i
[58:52] contacted god
[58:53] but i don't know where to go from here
[58:55] and so my aunt
[58:57] sister dale for those of you who knew
[58:58] her she was
[59:00] encouraging me to just going up to bed
[59:02] because i was getting late and that you
[59:04] know everything would be fine
[59:06] i didn't share any of my like my prayer
[59:08] with her or anything like that but you
[59:10] know
[59:10] i just kept it all in my heart and
[59:13] i said okay so i went up to bed and the
[59:15] next morning though sorry before going
[59:17] to sleep i said to myself that
[59:19] if i called her aunt faye she's my aunt
[59:22] rice i said if anthony
[59:23] call asked me to go to church with her
[59:25] in the morning i'll go
[59:26] it was a saturday night and then for her
[59:30] the morning her side of the story when
[59:32] she was leaving i'm going to
[59:34] like pass in my bedroom that morning the
[59:36] voice spoke to her and said
[59:38] you should ask marsha to go to church
[59:41] and so when she did
[59:42] thank god she obeyed right how important
[59:44] it is for us to listen to that voice as
[59:46] the lord speaks
[59:48] she obeyed and she just said oh you know
[59:50] do you want to go to church with me
[59:51] today
[59:52] and immediately she said that i was like
[59:54] okay there it is right i don't need to
[59:56] dab so i just got up
[59:57] got ready and we came to church that was
[59:59] my first time here
[1:00:01] um to church and i'll just i'll have to
[1:00:03] be you know to wrap up so to speak now
[1:00:06] but what happened that first service
[1:00:08] was it was actually discovered later
[1:00:10] that our brother who ministered
[1:00:12] for the dna and that that was his very
[1:00:14] first time ministering
[1:00:16] and it's amazing how we remember those
[1:00:18] moments because i remember his message
[1:00:20] was about
[1:00:20] the light and he used the light bulb to
[1:00:23] type heaven
[1:00:24] and i think the title actually of his
[1:00:25] message was the lamb
[1:00:27] is the light there and everything that
[1:00:29] he was just speaking is like he was just
[1:00:31] talking to me personally and you know in
[1:00:34] those moments right in
[1:00:35] and the way he used the light bulb and
[1:00:37] typed heaven and typed about god and
[1:00:39] taught jesus
[1:00:40] and saying how he will be the light
[1:00:42] there we won't need for any natural
[1:00:44] light
[1:00:44] it just like it just opened up a whole
[1:00:46] new world to me
[1:00:48] and i just felt like okay this is
[1:00:50] something i've never heard before
[1:00:53] but then i was still not sure if i
[1:00:55] difficult church home that i'd want to
[1:00:57] be
[1:00:58] and then sometime later i think with on
[1:01:00] my drive home
[1:01:01] the thought came to me though that if i
[1:01:03] were to stay in this church
[1:01:06] and be a part of this ministry that i
[1:01:08] would see my grandmother again
[1:01:11] and i knew it in my heart that okay god
[1:01:14] that's you speaking to me you're telling
[1:01:15] me that this is where i need to be
[1:01:17] and this is the way that you're going to
[1:01:19] lead me to go to glory and defeat my
[1:01:21] grandmother again
[1:01:23] so after that i um i ended up having to
[1:01:26] learn about being re-baptized because
[1:01:29] i was now i'd gone into the world and
[1:01:31] everything so
[1:01:32] needless to say on easter sunday 1997
[1:01:35] i got re-baptized gave my heart to the
[1:01:38] lord
[1:01:39] and the life change happened because you
[1:01:42] know i recognize that
[1:01:44] jesus is the only the main and most
[1:01:47] important relationship
[1:01:48] that we need to develop in our lives and
[1:01:50] that even as we grow up even if we come
[1:01:53] from a messy environment where
[1:01:55] it may not have been picture perfect to
[1:01:57] say right
[1:01:58] we recognize that he's able to change us
[1:02:00] he's able to transform us
[1:02:02] and he uses people to help us to build
[1:02:04] our character to shape us
[1:02:05] right and so to encourage you especially
[1:02:07] even folks who may be younger in high
[1:02:09] school
[1:02:10] that think of the friends that you have
[1:02:12] think of the influences
[1:02:14] who are around you because just as even
[1:02:16] my friend was helped to me
[1:02:18] when she invited me to join the choir
[1:02:20] and that became a big transition for me
[1:02:22] you can invite someone else and you can
[1:02:24] invite them to church or
[1:02:25] some other hobby some activity but that
[1:02:27] will help them to develop and to come
[1:02:29] outside of themselves
[1:02:30] and to learn more about themselves
[1:02:32] really but it's just to show us the
[1:02:34] importance of our friends our influences
[1:02:37] but therefore the most important as i
[1:02:39] said relationship
[1:02:40] is recognizing that we need to know our
[1:02:43] creator we need to know our maker
[1:02:45] you know the bible speaks that the
[1:02:46] heavens declare the glory of the lord
[1:02:48] we only need to look around us to
[1:02:50] recognize that we
[1:02:52] were created by the by god who became
[1:02:54] the lord jesus christ
[1:02:56] and that he came here to redeem us so
[1:02:58] that we could have a relationship with
[1:03:00] him
[1:03:01] just like you have a relationship with
[1:03:02] your parents if god didn't make us
[1:03:05] we couldn't have a relationship with us
[1:03:07] he couldn't reveal himself to us
[1:03:09] and so that's why he made us so that he
[1:03:11] could be our father he could be our
[1:03:13] comforter
[1:03:14] so i thank you very much for this time
[1:03:16] thank you for listening
[1:03:17] as i shared my background where i came
[1:03:19] from how i grew up
[1:03:21] and i pray that perhaps something i
[1:03:23] shared today has been a blessing to you
[1:03:25] in your journey
[1:03:26] knowing that no matter what you may be
[1:03:28] going through it's only jesus
[1:03:30] who can make a way and god richly bless
[1:03:32] you amen
[1:03:34] [Music]

[1:21:03] even in vets
[1:21:07] he remembered the thief
[1:21:11] hanging by his side

[1:21:27] red eyes if there isn't love
[1:21:34] the ocean is dry
[1:21:39] there's no stars in the sky
[1:21:44] and the sparrows can't fly

[1:23:49] [Music]
[1:23:51] praise god god bless you saints
[1:23:56] if there was ever a year that um
[1:23:59] we needed to rely on the lord and
[1:24:03] know that he would be psalms 3 the
[1:24:06] lifter of our head
[1:24:08] this was the year i got to say that i
[1:24:11] had
[1:24:13] many ups and downs let's put it that way
[1:24:17] it was a year of tremendous victories
[1:24:21] a year of tremendous testing uh
[1:24:24] testing of our faith
[1:24:27] you know right from within my own family
[1:24:31] my children um every area
[1:24:34] health issues and then on top of that
[1:24:37] the pressure
[1:24:38] of covid 19 and putting an
[1:24:41] uh you know an undue stress right upon
[1:24:45] the home in the family i'm sure
[1:24:46] you understand what i'm talking about
[1:24:49] you know
[1:24:50] it just you can't get out you know and
[1:24:53] and the pressure becomes
[1:24:54] there you know and um and then you know
[1:24:57] this
[1:24:59] mind battle that goes on where
[1:25:02] you got to deal with the fact that
[1:25:04] you're a son or a daughter of god
[1:25:06] and you know as a son or daughter of god
[1:25:08] we have no fear
[1:25:09] because we know that the lord our god is
[1:25:11] our healer he's our provider
[1:25:14] there's nothing that we should ever fear
[1:25:16] but yet
[1:25:18] we're living in human realm and we're in
[1:25:21] these human
[1:25:22] bodies and these bodies are susceptible
[1:25:26] to the conditions and the laws
[1:25:30] of this dimension and so um
[1:25:34] this song came to me uh you know we were
[1:25:36] talking about

[1:32:24] at this hour and time
[1:32:27] we would like to take our scripture
[1:32:31] from matthew chapter
[1:32:34] two reading from verses
[1:32:38] one to 12.
[1:32:43] in particular i would like to
[1:32:47] take verse 12
[1:32:51] we find here now
[1:32:54] when jesus was born in
[1:32:57] bethlehem of judea
[1:33:02] in the days of herod the king
[1:33:06] behold there came
[1:33:09] wise men from the east
[1:33:12] to jerusalem saying
[1:33:16] where is he that is born king of the
[1:33:19] jews
[1:33:20] for we have seen a star in the east
[1:33:23] and are come to worship him
[1:33:28] when herod the king had heard these
[1:33:30] things he was troubled
[1:33:33] and all jerusalem with him
[1:33:36] but when he had gathered the chief
[1:33:38] priests and scribes and
[1:33:40] of the people together and he demanded
[1:33:43] of them where christ should be born
[1:33:47] and they said unto him in bethlehem of
[1:33:50] judea
[1:33:51] for thus it is written by the prophet
[1:33:55] and thou bettly him in the land of judah
[1:34:00] are not the least among the princes of
[1:34:03] judah
[1:34:04] for out of thee shall come a governor
[1:34:08] that shall rule my people
[1:34:11] of israel when herod then herod when he
[1:34:15] had privileged
[1:34:16] called the wise men inquired of them
[1:34:21] diligently what time the star
[1:34:25] appeared and he sent them to bethlehem
[1:34:28] and said go
[1:34:29] and search diligently for the young
[1:34:32] child and when we have found him
[1:34:34] bring me word again that i
[1:34:37] may come and worship
[1:34:40] him also and when they had heard the
[1:34:44] king they departed
[1:34:46] and lo the star which they saw in the
[1:34:50] east
[1:34:51] went before them
[1:34:54] and till it came and stood
[1:34:57] over where the young
[1:35:01] child was
[1:35:04] when they saw the star they rejoiced
[1:35:08] with exceeding great joy
[1:35:12] and when they were come into the house
[1:35:16] they saw the young child with
[1:35:19] mary his mother and fell
[1:35:22] down and worshipped him
[1:35:26] and when they had opened their treasures
[1:35:30] they presented unto him gifts
[1:35:33] gold and frankincense
[1:35:37] and myrrh and being
[1:35:40] warned of god in a dream
[1:35:43] that they should not return to herod
[1:35:47] they departed into their
[1:35:50] own country another way
[1:35:56] praise be to god for the reading of his
[1:35:58] word
[1:35:59] let us pray a gracious father

[1:37:24] amen and amen praise the lord
[1:37:29] praise god
[1:37:32] brother branham speaking from who do you
[1:37:35] say this
[1:37:36] is he says we are living in a
[1:37:41] marvelous time the
[1:37:44] the greatest of all the ages
[1:37:49] we're living to win
[1:37:52] time can cease and eternity
[1:37:56] can blend right in with it
[1:38:00] and go on
[1:38:03] the ages of all the prophets
[1:38:06] and the sages look forward to
[1:38:11] we ought to be every hour
[1:38:14] on our guard watching
[1:38:18] for his coming
[1:38:21] oh we are in a critical hour
[1:38:24] the world is but the real
[1:38:28] church not the denomination
[1:38:32] is ready for the greatest triumph
[1:38:36] it has ever made the coming
[1:38:40] of the groom to the bride
[1:38:44] oh one a day one an hour is now
[1:38:46] wonderful
[1:38:47] the coming of the groom
[1:38:52] to the bride at this time
[1:38:55] not four but two praise the lord he is
[1:38:59] here
[1:39:00] too and when that talk coming to her
[1:39:04] as a revelation changes and
[1:39:07] goes into a rapturing condition
[1:39:11] then they go out of here but praise be
[1:39:14] the gods
[1:39:16] i'd like to speak on the subject of the
[1:39:18] wisdom of the wise men
[1:39:21] for if they were called wise men by god
[1:39:24] himself
[1:39:25] in the bible then they must be wise
[1:39:29] and first of all we understand that
[1:39:31] these wise men were
[1:39:33] indeed wise for under
[1:39:37] the inspiration of a balaam
[1:39:41] the prophet his message
[1:39:44] that out of jacob
[1:39:47] would rise a great star
[1:39:51] amen out of jacob out of
[1:39:54] him will rise the star that will come up
[1:39:59] that will be a governor and a ruler
[1:40:04] over god's people israel
[1:40:08] they got a revelation
[1:40:11] from him and so they were watching
[1:40:15] for a star they were waiting
[1:40:18] for the appearance of a star
[1:40:22] for the star to appear
[1:40:26] and when that great star did appear
[1:40:32] as you know these wise men
[1:40:35] were astronomers uh they were
[1:40:39] astronomers maybe also
[1:40:42] astrologers uh because
[1:40:45] in those days back then
[1:40:48] before the torah was even written
[1:40:53] god's first bible was in the skies
[1:40:56] using the moon stars and sun
[1:41:00] as signs to show times and seasons
[1:41:05] and and so on so the patriots of
[1:41:08] of of their day actually
[1:41:12] read god's bible
[1:41:15] in the sky now we know that god has
[1:41:19] moved on
[1:41:21] from that torah came along
[1:41:26] and then the fullness of the word
[1:41:30] where jesus came on the scene and it was
[1:41:33] written of him
[1:41:34] and then god revealed to paul the rest
[1:41:38] of the new testament
[1:41:40] of which now we have bought both old and
[1:41:44] new testament but these men
[1:41:48] at that time
[1:41:51] watch for the stars in the sky
[1:41:56] and when they saw it thank god
[1:42:00] they recognized it you see you see what
[1:42:03] you're looking for
[1:42:06] oh my praise god they recognize
[1:42:09] the star because they were watching
[1:42:13] for it thank god
[1:42:16] and they followed the star from their
[1:42:20] different
[1:42:20] countries from which they came their
[1:42:23] different
[1:42:24] nations from which they came
[1:42:27] uh today we'll say well you know they
[1:42:30] came out of different
[1:42:31] nations uh i believe india
[1:42:35] hindustan you know and persia
[1:42:38] uh what other country i don't know
[1:42:42] whether it's turkey or wherever but the
[1:42:44] three
[1:42:45] wise men traveled
[1:42:48] following the star from their
[1:42:52] different nations
[1:42:55] and we are here today by the grace of
[1:42:58] almighty god
[1:43:01] because we have come out from our
[1:43:04] various
[1:43:05] dynamic nations
[1:43:08] led by god star of the hour
[1:43:12] and we have recognized god's star
[1:43:16] and we have followed god's star
[1:43:20] amen hallelujah and as
[1:43:23] far as i know and believe and have
[1:43:26] received
[1:43:27] and witnessed in it in my heart life and
[1:43:31] ministry
[1:43:32] that he has led us to the perfect light
[1:43:37] now we know that these three wise men
[1:43:41] represented the three
[1:43:44] sons of noah shem
[1:43:48] ham and japheth and so
[1:43:51] it's speaking about the entire human
[1:43:54] race
[1:43:56] being under the influence of this
[1:43:59] great marvelous star
[1:44:03] hallelujah now as you know
[1:44:06] we have just had the conjunction of two
[1:44:10] stars
[1:44:12] coming together jupiter
[1:44:15] and saturn and forming
[1:44:18] one shining star within the
[1:44:22] night sky after hundreds of years
[1:44:27] this star has appeared two stars
[1:44:32] but in the day of jesus when the wise
[1:44:35] men
[1:44:36] followed that star we understand
[1:44:39] from historical writing records
[1:44:43] we understand that it's act in fact it
[1:44:46] was
[1:44:46] three stars and
[1:44:49] these three stars merged
[1:44:54] moved and they came into a conjunction
[1:45:00] they came into a union and
[1:45:03] when they were close together from the
[1:45:05] earth
[1:45:06] looking to them or at
[1:45:10] them they were seen as one
[1:45:13] great bright star within

[1:45:21] possibly jupiter
[1:45:24] saturn and venus
[1:45:27] that's possibly that's the names of
[1:45:30] those
[1:45:31] uh individual stars at that time
[1:45:36] now we understand that stars actually
[1:45:40] represent times according to god
[1:45:44] saying in genesis he puts them there for
[1:45:46] the signs
[1:45:48] and for seasons and

[1:46:13] three wise men from different

[1:46:23] traveling towards the truth
[1:46:26] searching to find the fullness of the
[1:46:30] word
[1:46:30] of god's truth and as they were
[1:46:34] traveling individually on the earth and
[1:46:37] moving in the heavens above
[1:46:41] the stars were moving also
[1:46:45] moving into a union and a conjunction
[1:46:49] until they came into a state of oneness
[1:46:53] to shine forth the light of god
[1:46:57] blessed be his holy name
[1:47:00] and so praise god those
[1:47:04] three men even though they never knew

[1:53:05] that led us to the perfect
[1:53:08] understanding and revelation of our day
[1:53:12] seeing being led
[1:53:16] not by a star in the heavens
[1:53:19] but led by a seventh star
[1:53:22] church age messenger amen
[1:53:26] spoken of in revelation chapter
[1:53:29] 3 revelation chapter 10 verse 7
[1:53:33] led by that twinkling shining
[1:53:36] wondrous star of god the light of
[1:53:39] revelation
[1:53:41] emanating from his message and from his
[1:53:44] ministry
[1:53:45] has led us right now my friends
[1:53:49] to the perfect light of god for this
[1:53:52] hour
[1:53:53] thanks be to god and some will say
[1:53:57] brother simon what you're saying i don't
[1:54:00] see it
[1:54:01] i don't understand it i don't know what
[1:54:04] you're talking about
[1:54:06] but it's just like it was back then
[1:54:09] the wise men saw the star but many
[1:54:12] others didn't or could not
[1:54:15] see the stars my god they didn't see it
[1:54:20] and now we have people in our day that
[1:54:23] do not
[1:54:24] see the star don't recognize the star
[1:54:27] don't
[1:54:27] understand the message the ministry of
[1:54:30] that star
[1:54:31] and what sign what does it mean
[1:54:35] who is this they do not understand
[1:54:38] who this is but god by his holy spirit
[1:54:42] has blessed us and revealed to us
[1:54:45] and caused us to know who this is and we
[1:54:49] give
[1:54:49] god the glory and the honor for it
[1:54:52] praise
[1:54:53] god hallelujah now you must realize
[1:54:58] herod and his wise men didn't see it
[1:55:01] or they would have had the answers for
[1:55:03] the wise men
[1:55:06] the rabbis the jewish rabbis
[1:55:09] who spent from childhood to manhood
[1:55:13] and into ancient man studying the
[1:55:16] scriptures day and night
[1:55:19] they did not see that star
[1:55:22] in the skies they did not recognize
[1:55:27] what god was doing in this hour
[1:55:30] oh watchman what of the night
[1:55:33] the morning cometh and what of the night
[1:55:37] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:55:40] hallelujah
[1:55:41] oh praise god but the wise men
[1:55:44] they were able to see the star
[1:55:48] because that star was given
[1:55:51] specifically for them to see for unto
[1:55:55] you it's given to know the mystery of
[1:55:58] the kingdom
[1:55:59] but unto them it is not given god
[1:56:02] predis elected and predestinated
[1:56:07] those wise men of that day to
[1:56:10] recognize that star messenger leader
[1:56:14] and they followed the star and the star
[1:56:18] led them to jesus christ hallelujah
[1:56:21] even so in our day and in our time
[1:56:25] we were being chosen elected
[1:56:28] predestinated by
[1:56:30] god to be come to the word of this
[1:56:33] hour and to understand and follow
[1:56:37] by supernatural revelation
[1:56:40] right to the christ of god himself
[1:56:44] amen hallelujah glory to god
[1:56:47] notice that took
[1:56:50] their eyes off of that star
[1:56:53] for a brief period of time
[1:56:59] and when they took their eyes off of
[1:57:03] that star
[1:57:05] they were blinded for a
[1:57:08] brief whale by the
[1:57:11] glare of man the glare of the glory
[1:57:16] of herod the glare of the glory
[1:57:20] of religious dignitaries
[1:57:23] they were distracted
[1:57:27] and temporarily misled
[1:57:30] by these religious
[1:57:34] popular dignitaries
[1:57:38] and religious leaders and
[1:57:41] this happened because
[1:57:44] they uh believed or
[1:57:47] thought to themselves that
[1:57:50] since these were learned leaders
[1:57:54] in the written scriptures of the day
[1:57:57] the written message of that day
[1:58:01] that they should know when this star
[1:58:05] or where the star has appeared
[1:58:10] and we know friends
[1:58:14] that they did not know
[1:58:17] they knew the scriptures they knew the
[1:58:20] scriptures said it
[1:58:21] that the star would rise from jesse they
[1:58:24] knew
[1:58:25] it would come around bethlehem efrata
[1:58:28] they knew that from writing but by
[1:58:31] revelation
[1:58:33] they had no idea that the star had
[1:58:37] already appeared and the wise men
[1:58:41] were being already led by that star
[1:58:45] to the christ they knew the scriptures
[1:58:49] but they did not know him many
[1:58:53] in this message in this day and in this
[1:58:57] hour mighty men of god mighty leaders
[1:59:01] great dignitaries
[1:59:02] great man oh no god
[1:59:06] no his word nor the scriptures
[1:59:10] but i'm not conscious of god
[1:59:13] to be aware of the supernatural
[1:59:17] occurrence
[1:59:19] that has taken taking place and
[1:59:22] is taking place as the book is unfolding
[1:59:26] god revealing himself and interpreting
[1:59:30] himself in this day and in this hour
[1:59:33] and making himself known they know the
[1:59:36] quotes they
[1:59:37] know the scriptures they know the word
[1:59:40] they'll they'll
[1:59:41] tack you to a wall with that but they
[1:59:44] have no
[1:59:45] idea they're skimming around close to it
[1:59:48] but they're not really into it
[1:59:52] not just by lining up quotes lining up
[1:59:54] scriptures
[1:59:55] comparing texts and stuff like that but
[1:59:58] coming
[1:59:58] under the inspiration of the mighty
[2:00:01] angel of
[2:00:01] revelation 10 1 coming under
[2:00:04] the power of the supernatural covenant
[2:00:07] of god
[2:00:08] the great holy spirit moving within the
[2:00:11] heart
[2:00:12] of the true believer and making himself
[2:00:15] known
[2:00:16] and interpreting his own word through
[2:00:18] them for his glory
[2:00:19] and for his honor oh blessed be the name
[2:00:22] of the lord
[2:00:24] hallelujah those men were so convinced
[2:00:29] as we are convinced that
[2:00:32] those of us would caught the genuine
[2:00:36] core heart ingredient of the
[2:00:40] last prophet's message
[2:00:43] and pressed our way into the kingdom
[2:00:46] hallelujah holding to god's unchanging
[2:00:50] word
[2:00:51] and there we are those men were
[2:00:54] convinced
[2:00:55] even though they had never seen anything
[2:00:59] of
[2:00:59] this sort in their lifetimes or heard of
[2:01:03] any such a thing
[2:01:04] they followed the star according to
[2:01:08] the word of prophecy that was revealed
[2:01:11] and made known to them
[2:01:13] they followed the star and they did it
[2:01:16] regardless of
[2:01:18] circumstances over hill
[2:01:21] and over dale over
[2:01:25] deserts and over mountains
[2:01:29] over hunger thirst
[2:01:32] over the objections of their family
[2:01:37] friends wives husband
[2:01:40] they held to the promised word of the
[2:01:43] day
[2:01:43] the message of the hour the message of
[2:01:46] malachi
[2:01:47] 4 5 turning not to the right nor to the
[2:01:50] left
[2:01:51] but keeping their eyes upon the star
[2:01:54] keeping their eyes
[2:01:55] upon the word of god looking away to
[2:01:58] jesus
[2:01:58] and following in the footsteps of their
[2:02:01] lord oh blessed be the name of the lord
[2:02:04] nor praise god imagine their friends
[2:02:07] must have come to them
[2:02:10] and said melchior what madness are you
[2:02:13] caught up in what type not even the
[2:02:16] normal church not even the
[2:02:20] same sensible wonderful
[2:02:23] ministers message ministers that follow
[2:02:27] claim they're also watching for that
[2:02:29] star and
[2:02:30] following that star

[2:02:36] they don't have
[2:02:37] uh what you're talking about what are
[2:02:40] you talking about
[2:02:41] and and so they made him into an oddball
[2:02:45] and
[2:02:46] the friends family would begin to
[2:02:49] question their integrity their
[2:02:52] understanding
[2:02:53] and their revelation oh my god
[2:02:57] hallelujah yes sir and these men

[2:03:12] their own nations and among their own
[2:03:15] people
[2:03:16] men of fame maybe they were rich
[2:03:20] but that counted all it all down and ash
[2:03:24] that they might win the christ that they
[2:03:26] might
[2:03:27] find the perfect light the word of god
[2:03:31] for the day and for the hour
[2:03:34] hallelujah none of those things stop
[2:03:36] them
[2:03:37] and none of this should stop you none of
[2:03:40] it should give us a halting a hindering
[2:03:43] or a hesitation but to press

[2:09:53] and a powerful uh end-time
[2:09:57] revival of that nature we were looking
[2:10:01] for that because that's what we've seen
[2:10:03] in the past
[2:10:04] not realizing that what god was going to

[2:10:11] to accomplish the same goals and more
[2:10:14] than that

[2:12:54] misunderstood by even the religious
[2:12:57] people of that day

[2:13:08] surrounding his birth about an angel

[2:13:15] things like that they were questioning
[2:13:18] the circumstances of his

[2:15:36] their land their nation their country
[2:15:40] they already had whether you wanted to
[2:15:44] call it a fuzzy
[2:15:46] revelation but they had some kind of a
[2:15:49] revelation
[2:15:51] each one had an individual revelation
[2:15:55] because one saw him bringing gold
[2:15:58] to represent that he saw him reveal to
[2:16:01] him
[2:16:02] as king king and
[2:16:05] the other one had a revelation of him

[2:16:32] lamb that was supposed to die and become
[2:16:36] their savior and that he was born to die
[2:16:40] and so he brought myrrh to represent
[2:16:43] that my friends

[2:17:30] reason
[2:17:31] and the word is giving us light for this
[2:17:34] day
[2:17:35] and for this hour hallelujah
[2:17:38] oh praise god god came
[2:17:42] in flesh as his own prophet to make

[2:17:53] god and god give to him all of our
[2:17:57] talents
[2:17:58] all of our gifts that he has given us
[2:18:01] let us give our lives as
[2:18:05] not dead animal sacrifices back there
[2:18:08] but give your life as a living sacrifice
[2:18:12] living and sacrificing for this message
[2:18:15] and the things you may and must go
[2:18:18] through
[2:18:18] as a living sacrifice for the glory
[2:18:21] of the living god hallelujah amen
[2:18:25] praise god hallelujah also
[2:18:28] let us give him our gifts of our lives
[2:18:32] today

[2:18:37] by the way we live today
[2:18:40] let us adore him magnify him
[2:18:45] by the lies we show we express
[2:18:48] to the world everywhere for his glory
[2:18:52] and for his honor praise god
[2:18:56] now after they had given
[2:19:02] to the christ in actual fact to his
[2:19:05] spirits
[2:19:07] hallelujah after they had given
[2:19:11] the appropriate gifts amen
[2:19:16] that reflected who he was
[2:19:21] his birth his life and his death
[2:19:26] they left and began
[2:19:32] to return back to their own country
[2:19:35] but they were sought out by herod
[2:19:38] and i must tell you when you have caught
[2:19:41] this revelation
[2:19:44] they may not understand what you are
[2:19:46] saying everything you're saying
[2:19:49] but they're recognized you caught
[2:19:50] something
[2:19:52] and they would like to know where that
[2:19:55] came from
[2:19:56] and how can we get it
[2:20:01] what mean it this
[2:20:04] how men and brethren what shall we do
[2:20:08] to get it can we buy it can we
[2:20:12] question you and ask you about it amen
[2:20:17] so they were sought out by herod
[2:20:21] and his people
[2:20:24] because herod didn't catch the
[2:20:25] revelation the rabbis didn't catch it
[2:20:28] his wise men his astrologers didn't
[2:20:31] catch it
[2:20:32] at that time but he wanted to have
[2:20:36] an intellectual knowledge or
[2:20:39] understanding of that revelation
[2:20:43] of who this christ was this anointed
[2:20:47] word
[2:20:47] was this king god king word king of
[2:20:51] righteousness
[2:20:52] king of peace if he wanted to have an
[2:20:55] understanding of what was going on
[2:20:59] in his kingdom and what did they
[2:21:02] really find out what did they discover
[2:21:06] or he wanted an explanation
[2:21:09] what was it what is it
[2:21:13] that's revealed to you let me know this
[2:21:16] amen hallelujah and the wise men
[2:21:21] knew this what was made known to them by
[2:21:25] god
[2:21:26] himself being warned of god
[2:21:30] in a dream i know better
[2:21:33] said the servant and prophet of god
[2:21:37] to go tell you a revelation
[2:21:40] of what god has made known to me
[2:21:44] until it's already in progress and it
[2:21:47] happens
[2:21:48] and then it's too late satan can do
[2:21:51] nothing
[2:21:52] oh praise god being warned in a dream
[2:21:56] said the bible matthew chapter 2 verse
[2:21:59] 12

[2:22:53] your heart
[2:22:54] if you are one of those elected seed you

[2:34:27] of this chaotic
[2:34:28] madness that's going on around us
[2:34:32] the plague swirling everywhere

[2:34:40] everywhere and yet my friends

[2:35:11] emotional strength

[2:35:21] angels came to straighten him
[2:35:24] i ask god that he will use some of you

[2:35:30] to be a strength an encouragement
[2:35:34] to me and to all the other ministers
[2:35:37] everywhere
[2:35:38] who are preaching the word of god with
[2:35:41] all their heart and all their soul
[2:35:43] may the spirit of god bless them use
[2:35:46] them
[2:35:46] and use you to be pillars
[2:35:50] in the temple of my god blessed be his
[2:35:53] name
[2:35:54] lord of god forevermore yes sir praise
[2:35:57] god
[2:35:58] friends because of the presence
[2:36:00] circumstances
[2:36:03] because of the shutdowns that we are
[2:36:06] experiencing
[2:36:08] we are not able to meet in our
[2:36:10] tabernacle
[2:36:11] face to face and to enjoy
[2:36:16] one another's presence fellowship
[2:36:19] we can do that on the phone and do it
[2:36:22] through
[2:36:23] media but that's good but it's not the
[2:36:26] same
[2:36:26] as when we meet and talk and fellowship
[2:36:29] together
[2:36:30] around the world and assemble for his
[2:36:33] glorious name on the lord's day and
[2:36:36] open up the lord's book to give glory to
[2:36:39] the lord's name
[2:36:41] my friends this is a testing time
[2:36:45] 2021 a
[2:36:48] testing time a year of testing a time of
[2:36:52] testing
[2:36:54] it's a sifting time
[2:36:58] it's a time where god is proving
[2:37:01] his word because
[2:37:05] god is trying to prove us
[2:37:09] us to our faithfulness
[2:37:14] to his revealed word of this hour
[2:37:18] our action to
[2:37:22] reaction how do we react to the
[2:37:26] circumstances
[2:37:28] and to his word amen
[2:37:32] will we wonder about the word
[2:37:36] because of these
[2:37:39] dignitaries rabbis and uh
[2:37:42] men out there that claim they can read
[2:37:46] the stars
[2:37:47] also they have some understanding of the
[2:37:49] messenger
[2:37:50] are we to begin to cause them to say
[2:37:53] things that will make you
[2:37:54] wonder and then after you start
[2:37:58] start wondering
[2:38:02] will they cause you to wander away
[2:38:06] from the message of the hour
[2:38:09] the word of god given for this day
[2:38:14] and for this time will you
[2:38:18] become a piece of dry duck
[2:38:22] a dried up driftwood card away
[2:38:27] on the tides of time oh my brother my
[2:38:31] sister
[2:38:32] look to the word of god look to the lamb
[2:38:36] of god
[2:38:37] hallelujah
[2:38:40] don't allow in this hour for god
[2:38:43] is doing it he has put every one of us
[2:38:47] on an individual basis
[2:38:51] away from pastor away from this away
[2:38:54] from
[2:38:54] church away from that one away from the
[2:38:57] other one
[2:38:57] that he might personally try you and
[2:39:00] prove you
[2:39:01] as to your personal fate not that you
[2:39:05] are propped up
[2:39:06] like a tomato plant not that you are
[2:39:09] held up together
[2:39:10] but god wants to see your faith in his
[2:39:14] word
[2:39:14] and he is now proving his word and
[2:39:17] testing you in the wilderness
[2:39:20] of this day and of this hour

[2:39:48] denominationalism where you came from
[2:39:51] or you can start to claim the message
[2:39:54] but you're edging
[2:39:56] and inching your way to the border land

[2:44:10] and honor
[2:44:11] god bless you god bless you real good
[2:44:27] you know uh this is definitely a
[2:44:31] wonderful
[2:44:32] time that we're living in right now
[2:44:35] as sons and daughters of god to be able
[2:44:38] to
[2:44:39] be the wise men in this day and in this
[2:44:42] hour to recognize
[2:44:44] what god is actually doing you know you
[2:44:47] look at 2020
[2:44:49] and um you know it's only once
[2:44:53] every hundred years that the numbers
[2:44:56] will come together like that
[2:44:58] and you can just look at 2020 and the
[2:45:00] significance of it
[2:45:02] and how you know um
[2:45:06] here we are a hundred years later in
[2:45:08] another pandemic the last one was like a
[2:45:11] hundred years ago
[2:45:13] and uh you know history kind of
[2:45:15] repeating itself but
[2:45:16] you know it's it's pretty significant
[2:45:18] now we're entering into
[2:45:21] back in the 1920s they called it the
[2:45:23] roaring
[2:45:24] 20s and it was a time where
[2:45:27] civilization was basically going from
[2:45:30] horse and buggy
[2:45:32] to the motor car and here we are now
[2:45:35] entering into the roaring 20s again
[2:45:38] and what are we doing we're going from
[2:45:41] gasoline
[2:45:42] vehicles to electric vehicles
[2:45:46] and the information and the technology
[2:45:50] and the way that everything is moving
[2:45:53] and
[2:45:54] even the technology you know i i i
[2:45:56] looked into certain technologies that
[2:45:58] are
[2:45:58] happening right now um genome
[2:46:02] sequencing they call it where they're
[2:46:04] able to actually
[2:46:06] you know analyze your molecules and be
[2:46:09] able to
[2:46:10] tell you you know if there's certain
[2:46:13] ailments you know diabetes or cancer in
[2:46:16] your cells
[2:46:16] already they're going to those levels
[2:46:19] what is it telling us as the sons of god
[2:46:23] that we're basically entering into that
[2:46:25] dimensional change
[2:46:27] we're breaking into levels of
[2:46:28] information
[2:46:30] into the mind of god like never before
[2:46:33] so if anything i think that we can look
[2:46:35] into 2020 as
[2:46:37] probably going to be one of the most
[2:46:39] exciting years that we've ever
[2:46:42] experienced especially in the lord
[2:46:45] amen i don't know brother mike you think
[2:46:47] that the rapture could happen
[2:46:49] this year certainly could
[2:46:53] it certainly could
