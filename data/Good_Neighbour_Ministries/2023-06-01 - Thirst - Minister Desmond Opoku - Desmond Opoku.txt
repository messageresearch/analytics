day of the face Jesus stood and cried saying If any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink he that believe beloved on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water Hallelujah thank you love it let's just go to Psalm 42 verse 2. my soul tested for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God Hallelujah you may be seated thank you my my topic here tonight it's just a simple word thirst test I know anybody have have tested before hallelujah how many of you have a test before Hallelujah before you can get a drink you have to test before you drink thank you praise God hallelujah and you know water is life thank you Lord God God made us special he make us special to put a thirst in US so that we can live glory to God you know the whole world the water is more than anything the water I think maybe three to test of water more than anything in the world God did that for a purpose because everything in this world here need water no matter what it is we need water otherwise the grass will die just like that the tree will die just land anybody will die just like that what about we glory to God first is very important meaning of tests in the Bible strong spiritual desire strong spiritual desire thank you Lord ask for us Oxford dictionary said the feeling of needing or wanting a drink that's test praise God hallelujah Taurus is part of our living life on this Earth year you know without water we cannot live it's impossible even when you your shortage of water they called what dehydration you said what getting weak you start getting weak so as a Christian without thirst of the Living Water who is the test who is the Living Water the living water is the Lord Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah what he said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water so he is the well that every Christian has to pray for to get that drink the Living Water Hallelujah thank you Lord your natural water give you to sustain this body here glory to God Hallelujah I am very very happy to be a Christian no religion in this world cannot understand this word here they talk about only God which God the god that can tell you how you can live this affair and the world to come glory to God no other God no other religion in this world can tell you how you can live over there accept Christianity they can tell you about God this is Muhammad this but this and that but I can't tell you how you're gonna live on this world here and how you can get over there they talk about heaven Heaven how can you get heavy without the Lord Jesus Christ he is the gate he is the Gate of Heaven that's why I said last time you cannot go there until you have the blood tag Hallelujah why do you think he gave us his blood for only Christians can get that blood out in their life Glory and he is alive forever more he just came and sprayed that bread sprinkling that brother so that we can receive that life because the life is in the blood when they drain all your blood you done there's no life in you so thank God for the blood of the Lamb hallelujah amen he's calling everybody to be thirst hunger glory to God oh Hallelujah without water you cannot live on this area thank you Jesus how many people are craving for The Living Water that you can drink every day at night there are only especially people who God has reserved this water for that's you and me and there's only Christianity Hallelujah and this water here you know when we we have water in our home but sometimes we put a Purify to purify the water the purification of this water together is speckled water is through the message of the hour William Branham when brother Abraham was here the Christianity was here already that God put a filter purification to filter the water for only especially people that's the blood of Christ so if you have the message of this hour you are drinking the real living water the real living water the special water God has reserved for you and me no other people hallelujah glory to God amen why when you pick up the Bible you can understand somebody can read the Bible you cannot understand why because you are special God reserved especially Revelation he opened himself to you so that's me I am the father I am the one who purchase you for my blood on the cross because I miss you I miss to have fellowship with you but now I am here to have fellowship with you every moment every second in your life Oh Glory to God that's what made this message special special message William Martin why you think the world hate him why they had this message because this message is life why we are drinking special water the denomination had this message why because they don't have that purification water that God has given to you or me and what it caused a jealousy why did they why why God did that because you are his wife he cannot hide anything because he wants you to be a special you want you to be

believe me that I am the only true God you die on your sin Hallelujah he did it specific for only one race the whole world he spoke to the whole world so that means every religion if you pass anywhere

have to recognize that please very very important it's not God is preparing us so you have to get inside there if you don't get each other You're Gonna Miss when God tells you to do something it's what it's a thought a third manifest is a word there is a thought comes and they're welcome and then there is manifestation so if that thought come you think the prophet and all those things all the time God speaks about can't go he go he come he talked to them a word comes that because they recognize that they yield themselves to the word the word of God so when that thought comes they know they can filter they thought through the holy ghost in the in them is happening it's happening you and me that's where the bride's gonna they're gonna they're gonna recognize anytime they speak the acts of

did that he went then he felt it said no this is not a busy this is real that is that is what is going to happen to you you're gonna think this no this is real that's why you have to turn your ear to the voice of God Amen so when you speak you can hear you can you can act upon the word of God you see that the time that talk come now you reason Satan will bombarded you you gotta find a battle in yourself but if you tune yourself with God's word and his thought and his mind you remember the world is in you you understand the word is in you who can speak the word is you have to speak the word

said yes if I see him and he show himself to me I will do it I said you're gonna hold himself to you because she wants to see something why she is angry with God so God has given something if I had to see that the god that we serve is real the reality of God is very important in your life hallelujah it's not just the words the manifestation of the Lord why do you think the people come to Brown meeting and they see the life the physical life sick womb death womb the rise up this is what happened that's the manifestation of whatever Abraham was preaching he said I can do nothing the one that behind me doing the work and God comes down and shows himself to the people to show himself to the people and you go to somebody and you tell God to show himself to that person would you believe that God will show himself to that person he would do exactly that he did through Abraham because God wants people to see him he wants to serve people he want to call his children if they don't know him they have to save him especially this woman that he had the heart look here nobody in the house he has only two children one boy one girl the husband he said the husband sick so hard he died and the heart attack massive heart attack to the boy never get sick and the sister husband gone say why God do that take everything away from me every human being a big house alone everything turned upside down the chair the sofa covered everything covers she alone she had it right he's a human to God if you introduce God to him he has to see something that will take that thing that bitterness away from
