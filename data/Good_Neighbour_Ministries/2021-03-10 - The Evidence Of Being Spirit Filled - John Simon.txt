TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] hello friends here we are again another wednesday evening in which to study the word of god to feed upon it and to grow in his marvelous grace may the lord jesus bless us together as we come with rejoicing and faith in the presence of the living god oh praise his name my scripture is found in revelation chapter 2 verse 17. the first part of the verse he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches amen my topic for today will be the evidence of being spirit-filled i would like for us to dive into this because there are so many versions and ideas and thoughts and the main thought that has been promoted or given to people denominations have been founded and based their origins upon this flawed or false evidence of the baptism of the holy spirit and thus it requires the uh the correction of the word of god for the word of god the revealed word of god by the holy spirit corrects the era within the framework of the church of god realize that john the baptist while here upon the earth that he was bought prophet to the people of israel and he was also the messenger of god to his day and time his history we are aware of for the bible tells us he was filled with the holy spirit at the time of his birth in his mother's womb he was filled with the spirit of god hallelujah amen how wonderful to know we don't even have to be actually born and a human walking around to be filled with the holy spirit but it's a predestinated gift of the living god that floods and fills the heart of the believer knowing that gifts and callings from god are without or before repentance now we realize that when he was baptizing in the jordan river the word of god jesus christ came to the prophet john the baptist the word came to the prophet for this prophet was foreordained or predestinated prophesied to be the voice of one crying in the wilderness he would be the one to announce jesus the word to herald the coming of the word to identify the word of god and to make clear to the people that the prophet was on earth therefore the word had to be on earth for the prophet to be able to announce it identify it to the people so the word john being predestinated prophesied to be the the herald the messenger of the word then the word could go to no one else the word had to pass john's way the word of god had to come to john so that it could identify john and john could identify that word that behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world behold the bloody lamb amen that takes the book and breaks the seals thereof behold the open word now to reveal himself to you of who he is hallelujah the evidence of john being filled with the spirit is that the word jesus christ came to him john from which we take this principle which i have used as a sermon topic that the word always comes to the predestinated vessels of the day or that hour in this day it's not one man in this day it's a bride church a many member body of jesus christ and so they who were in god's mind who were in his thoughts who are his beloved oh praise god it's to them that the word comes hence my scripture that we just read he that had an ear to hear let him hear praise god so the word comes to someone who has already been prophesied predestinating and given a supernatural crystal a supernatural ear a supernatural heart to receive the word of god for their day when that word comes and when the word does come to the age to that particular day or time the word can go nowhere else but to that or those predestinated vessels that were a time prepared before the foundations of the world for this hour when this message of this messenger this prophet of this 20th century sent by god for this day and hour that the word of god would first go to him then the word of god would flow out and it has to pass your way it must come to the predestinated vessel that already has that attribute that gene of god that air of god to be able to receive the word of god hallelujah how wonderful to know i am a receptor how good to know that i'm a prepared vessel you are a prepared vessel how wonderful to know that we are redeemed washed cleansed by the blood of god for his use for in the house of god are vessels of every kind but for us we are reserved for his divine purpose and for his glory oh thanks be to god the evidence a repeat of john the baptist being spirit-filled is that the word came to him and the genuine true evidence of you or i or anyone else being truly spirit-filled is that the word of god will come to you that is not john simon saying that that is the evidence jesus christ himself said that was the evidence listen and i will pray the father that he will send you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth when the world can whom the world cannot cannot receive now we know what what the truth is of course we know what the truth is we do not yet understand jesus speaking why do you not understand my speech listen to his reasons even because you cannot hear my word amen see the world could not receive what he was saying they can hear it with their outer ears but they got angry when they heard it because uh they don't understand it it doesn't reveal to them they did not come here with an ear to hear a spiritual ear to hear the word of god for their day amen the world couldn't receive it and neither could the world receive the holy ghost amen neither could they receive the word for the holy ghost the holy spirit and the word is one and the same praise god the written word on the pages of the bible is resurrected or brought back to life by the holy spirit activity in the life mind and heart of the true believer praise god other than that it just stays in the tomb it just stays here and it's just the written word praise god no human understanding no will of man not by the works of man can produce not by the studied intellectuality the wisdom of satan or the wisdom of man no matter how holy how good the intention it can not reveal the word of god it may expose expose exposition it may give topical it may get give exegetical it may give all manner of parts of the word but my brothers and sisters it cannot truly reveal the word of god it's the holy spirit himself that reveals the word of the living god listen to the lord jesus but amen just as the holy spirit came to the prophets the word of god comes to you john 14 26 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he not the bible school he not the seminary he not the monastery he not the convent none of these illustrious places of learning and we need human natural learning so i'm not putting that down i'm saying you need that but we are not here to put that first uh be here to put the word of god and the revelation of the word of god first amen so so the holy spirit reveals the word to the true believer he shall teach you all things and bring to your remembrance he'll give you a good memory by bringing to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you amen hebrews 14 12 of course tells you the word of god is quicker and sharper than the two edged sword that's what the activity of the holy spirit does in the heart mind of the true believer of the living god amen john 16 13 how be it when he the spirit of truth the of amen the spirit of the word is come he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear amen praise god that shall he speak amen he will speak the word and he will show you things to come praise god in other words he'll anoint you with a spirit of prophecy you don't have to think about it ask for it once the true spirit of god is in your heart your life your mind he will show you things to come he will speak things out of you and through you that are prophetic anointed by the holy spirit oh praise his marvelous name that we can be numbered among those written in this bible that we are a part of that few a part of this elected people the all one by one regain the portals oh glory to his name the great holy spirit of the living god unveiling the word of god amen jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the holy spirit was speaking in tongues let me repeat jesus has never said anywhere in the world that the evidence of receiving the holy spirit is speaking in tongues or any manifestation of the holy spirit of amen not interpretations not the not uh any kinds of of prophesying not shouting not dancing in the spirit none of these things are evidence of receiving the spirit or being spirit-filled matter of fact jesus said the evidence of being spirit-filled or receiving the holy ghost is to be in the truth to be in the word of god for your age the evidence has to do with receiving the word and the word coming to you makes you know that you have the spirit you have the seed of god the life of god the gene the attribute god lives in you first corinthians 14 37 if any man think of himself a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge the things i write unto you are the commandments of the lord praise god now the see right there we see the proof of the indwelling of the holy spirit was your reaction to the word how do you react when you hear the truth of the word does it get you mad that you sad get you furious like the sadducees or the pharisees does it rile you get you all upset oh my friend see the the very evidence and proof of the spirit indwelling your heart indwelling you is to acknowledge my friends and follow what god's prophet has brought to us to the age hallelujah in the same way paul speaking came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only praise god see that is why we are preaching a christianity but from a different point of view for as i've taught before and as taught by the prophet of god real believers and true christians are not here to produce the life of christ we don't try to work our work ourselves to try to approximate uh measure ourselves against jesus and try to produce that kind of a life we don't do that hallelujah we try to receive the word for the day and that reveals to us that that life is already in us and now we are going to surrender to him and allow that life that word to make himself manifest what am i saying true christianity it's not you or i or anyone getting us bible study or a textbook showing you these are the qualities of the life of christ these are the qualities you're supposed to have that's marvelous that's wonderful description but the fact is you are to literally have that life in you then he begins to live his own life in and through you hence we say god is his own interpreter and he will make it plain glory to his marvelous name revelation chapter 22 verse 17 and the spirit and the bride say come hallelujah let him that hear it say come see the spirits has come the bride says come and he that can hear or hears that word says come because he's going to be soon added into that bride amen praise the lord they all only go by hearing of the word the same spirit the same the holy spirit can only speak the truth of the word and the bride can only speak the truth of the word so automatically she is saying what the spirit is saying and he that hear it anyone that has that spiritual ear that supernatural ear that i am talking about he or she will also say what the spirit is saying for they can see nothing else but what is in the revealed word of the hour and that will that proves that the real bride has to be the world bride she has to be for she will find that she is a part of that word herself no wonder to every church age the lord has said he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches or i will place my parentheses here uh or church ages what the spirit is saying to the churches or to all the church ages for the spirit of god gives the word and if you are if you have the spirit if you are predestinated with the life the seed of god in you hallelujah then you will automatically without trying without going to a long five-year study uh without the i did only three years but that doesn't didn't mean a thing when i came to the end of it i realized that's not what it is it was helpful it was very uh pointed it was wonderful for human knowledge but my friends it's the spirit of god's god's gift to you in you that can hear the word of god for your age just as the other christians in the early ages of the church heard the word and they were added onto the church 3 000 people in one day oh glory to god that's when the spirit's activity is working amongst the people they keep growing they keep multiplying they keep being anointed and the people around them start wondering what's happening what's going on it's god in action it's another book of acts hallelujah it's the great holy spirit of the living god working his divine will the way he should work it not depending on human education ecclesiasticism uh oh my intellectualism all these various things but relying on the word living word of the living god working through a people in these last days and every day from the beginning of the church right to this hour and to this time i want to thank god that we have been restored back to the faith of our fathers by the opening of the word of god and i am a partaker of it praise the living god hallelujah i believe it with all my heart glory god you know when i was just 18 uh years old and they're in their bible college and began to ask questions like jesus of mary and speaking like that after a while they they uh dean just they they just couldn't take it anymore it was too much and it was the fact is i was bringing it from the word and they could not answer they could not give a a reply to it and it's best to uh you know put him to push him to the back or to the side and not listen to that type of talk amen but brother sister that's what the spirit of god will do even to a child that's what the spirit of god will do to a a a girl to a a young man to a woman to a man to oh glory to god and nobody take the nobody god gets into the nobody and make him or her or somebody oh praise god hallelujah when the holy spirit takes control of a life it's not you now it's him they're still seeing you but they don't realize who is in you for jesus said it's not me you're looking at me but when you see me it's the father that liveth in me he doeth the work so glory to god hallelujah amen praise god amen he that had an ear to hear he notice god is trying to show you it has to come individually not the church that hears the word not the organization that hears the word and think they have it all collected and they can give it all to you and oh no but he that hear it amen he that has an ear to hear what the spirit is saying so the spirit is the one that gets the word amen hallelujah the spirit gives the word for he has the word of truth for every age and each age has its own elect every age has its elect of the age you might have a church world but out of that church world god calls out his elect little eagles praise god his elect children they come out of egypt they come out of the world and out of those that came out of egypt god calls out a small group joshua and caleb and the rest holy as there were jews as they were that died in the wilderness praise god while this small few entered over into the promised land of the revealed word of god hallelujah glory to god amen yes sir that the elect of god in each age always hears the word of god and by receiving the word of god for their age they're proving that they had to have had or they have this seed of god within them glory to god hallelujah see they have the seed of god within their heart glory to god amen so here we see from the scriptures he that is of god hear it god's word so if you're of god you'll hear god's word if you are not of god you get angry you get mad you you you call the word the word jesus you're up the elizabeth you call him oh you're joseph's son in other words you you weren't born supernaturally they called him all manner names and back then it was the pharisees today it's these modern church people they're religious the pharisees were religious they were scholars they knew more uh than most people today and yet they told the word jesus he was of the devil and he turns around said uh if they did this to me who am the word what will they do to you who are just i am your lord what are they going to do to you would they not also persecute you try you call you all men renames but blessed are you when they revile you persecute you and see all manner of evil and things against you for what because you took my name for and make it a prominent thing for my name's sake you took my name hallelujah and you suffer from my name you get rejected from my name you get reviled for my name you called all mineral names for me but you're stood you're holding god's unchanging hand you hold on to the word of the living god amen here i stand like luther so help me god praise god amen you hold to the word of god he says you he that is of god hearers of god's word you therefore hear them not because you are not of god he turned to the fascism sadducees is good you were religious you give your tithes you you support your so-called church your synagogue and you go every day and you do those things great wonderful marvelous he says but you are of your father the devil for thousands of years before abraham had this ear he had this eye this heart abraham rejoiced to see my day and he was glad but here you claim your abraham's children you're standing before the very living word jesus christ and you call it a devil you call him a cult you called him whatever you want to call him and call him all men renames and you can't even see what you're doing or who it is in his people like paul the god jesus christ was in the people and paul was slaughtering them until the lord appeared and said paul saul saul why persecutors thou mean for it was god living in his people the word that was dead on the pages of the bible had come back now and gone into the people's hearts and now the living word in them was making itself manifested and the rest of them were exposed they couldn't stand it amen my listen they refuse the word but the true seed of god for that hour receive the word of god because they were of god and the bible already said all thy children shall be taught not of men but they shall be taught of god amen isaiah 54 13 john 6 verse 45 amen amen being one with the word proves whether you are of god and whether you are spirit-filled or not or whether you are filled with some other other thing amen but to show you a spirit filled you will agree with every word of god i've seen so many people claim they're filled with the spirit then when you take the word of god you begin to show them they get to a spot where this they for a brief moment they recognize what where you're going and what you're saying and that they're they're caught in the middle of something and oh i don't believe that that what what is it that you don't believe see see they're they're caught in it and they back away they want to run why because that spirit or devil it could be just a natural human spirit or the devil when he sees his trap like that he just wants to run and get away from it lest the word of god the shark two edges of the sword of the word of god begins to cut and slash because one some people refuse the word while others receive the word with joy within their hearts and lies glory to god amen amen but what are interpretation tongues supernatural interpretation of tongues and the other gifts what are they my friends all they are are manifestations of the holy spirit first corinthians 12 7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit where without and then paul goes on to name all the various manifestations praise god see a lot of people major in in getting manifestations rather having major manifestations are all right that's wonderful but that's not being spirit-filled that doesn't prove anything about being spirit-filled see and they want a major in being able to have manifestations in their meetings rather than having revelation of the word making itself manifested within the hearts and lives of the people amen praise god now you say brother simon why isn't manifestation the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost surely you can't manifest i mean the holy ghost unless uh you were spirit filled but that's not right my friends that's completely wrong one has to think that way and let me give you some scriptural examples of those who produce manifestations of the genuine holy spirit but were not spirit-filled first of all there is balaam he was not a true seed prophet and he was religious he knew all the sacrifices he knew my friends all those things but yet he took the wages of uh unrighteousness some denomination some unrighteousness wages from the king of moab at that particular time in our day he's taking the wages of denominationalism or wherever he can find uh that position amen so he was not a true seed prophet and he even led the people of god into sin and into fornication and into idolatry but who could deny the spirit of god did manifest through him for he was the one that said that god would send a star out of jesse amen praise god god flashed through him and he prophesied but yet he was not filled with god's spirit then there is cahyphus who prophesied what kind of a death the lord jesus would die alone and there is no record in the bible where he is known to be asked to have been spirit filled yet the bible tells us he prophesied jesus death so prophecy interpretation tongues all these marvelous wonderful gifts are only manifestations of the holy spirit but it is not the revelation of the word neither does it give anybody the authority for revealing the word the only shown ability to produce the manifestations of the holy spirit we also find another group jesus himself had many disciples and he sent them out and they were empowered by the holy spirit but yet they had not gone to acts chapter 2 in the upper room they did not they were not spirit filled or filled with the spirit and so here they were and they went out the bible tells us i believe it's in luke chapter 10 verses 17 to 21 how that their return with joy in their hearts saying lord oh lord even the spirits are made subject the devils obey us and come out of the people we cast out devils we lay hands on the sick the people were healed and all manner of miracles were taking place we had a real big massive revival meeting and the spirit of god was moving amen oh my and so jesus told them that's marvelous what you should rejoice is whether your name is written in heaven in other words what you should rejoice is if you have a revelation that your name is on the page white and fear in the mind of god before the foundation of the world that's where your real rejoicing ought to be those signs always follow the genuine believer the believer doesn't have to try to produce anything manufacture anything make up anything they rely upon the great holy spirit a further thought about this for manifestations are not the evidence of being spirit filled when those disciples went out the bible tells us judas was amongst them judas son of perdition son of the devil the bible is telling you that he was a son of the devil oh a child of hell and he went out and he came back rejoicing the sick were healed devils were cast out miracles take place but that was no evidence that he was spirit filled oh my the bible tells us in the book of romans chapter 10 verses 28 and 29 gifts and calling of god are without repentance now my friends gifts of god are in you before you even became a christian when i was a child i had this strange thing about me where i would dream things i would see things i i wouldn't know where certain things are and how i how i would know i didn't know but i surely as i was given that knowledge i would be able to prove it but thanks me the god gifts and callings of god are without repentance i'm saying this so that you may look back on your own life your own heart your own mind and you may find that god is not just now working in your life he made you aware he's now made you come to your senses to recognize his activity within your heart and life what is christ in you working god working in you his will and his divine purpose amen now many years ago brother brennan went to a pentecostal meeting and two men were in those meetings both were speaking in towns both were shouting both was glorifying god and yet as you know he had this marvelous gift of discernment yet when he looked at both of them and spoke to both of them he could see that juan's heart was pure and he was living right while the other one was a hypocrite had his blonde hair wife and living with another woman and had three children by her hidden that the lawful wife knew nothing about what a shocking thing so brother branham began to pray and ask god what is this how could both claim to be spirit filled and one is literally a reprobate and the other one being truly righteous and so he prayed until god as you know gave him visions he broke into a vision and he was able to see how clear it was now he saw my friends a case where tears and wheat one sore dressed in white sowed some seeds that were wheat and another another sewer came after dressed in black and he sowed some seeds and those seeds were tears and then days went by then the sun and the rain came down both were blessed by both the rain and the sun so boat seats came up and when they came up of course the witch shout hallelujah praise god and thank god for the rain on the sunshine glory to god and begin to praise god brother branham said in my vision i was surprised when the wheat also that was dying from heat and thirst begin to say oh hallelujah praise god glory to god and glorify god also he said but there they were in the field mixed together wheat and tears and the tears shouting glory to god praise god and the weak also praising god how could you know the difference and there is the truth my friends of the real interpretation and understanding of the word of god the difference was that there were of different sea life they were of different seed life and this is what a lot of the people of the denominations don't understand the reign of the holy spirit does not come to put some new life into you the reign of the holy spirit brings out and reveals what seed life was already hidden in you before you were even born was in you but the rain came to force the germination of the seed that is in you oh you might be religious like cain was religious abel was religious but one was of god one of the devil this is the this is the mystery of the end time revival the twins of the end time revival and here you find the rain came the sun shines but it's every seed must bring forth after its kind and so the rain forced the life out of the seed and we see here my friends how that all happened so do you see the importance of the seed life of god i have the life of god in me the song writer said i have the life of god in me i have the life of god in me i have his fullness i have his life i have his authority for i have the life of god in me if i just say that anybody can say that but the life in you itself will prove whether it's in you or not amen listen matthew 7 21-23 not everyone that say it unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven this is what jesus is talking about both seeds are in the church both seeds are in the denomination and then the spirit crawls but only they that have an heir to hear amen but yet what can praise god butch and shout hallelujah book and clap your hands go out and enjoy the music but watch that life that is back there making itself manifest by receiving the word and then going and living and manifest in the word and standing by the word for it can do nothing else because the seed and the word are one the spirit and the word are one and all they with that see life in them make up the body of christ or we also call the bride of christ amen the lamb's wife oh praise god amen hallelujah jesus said not everyone that said unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that do at the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have we not cast out devils have we made laid hands on the sick and the people recovered have we not done miracles in your name have we not done many wonderful works then will i profess or say to them i never knew you you were not in my mind you were not for known in the mind of god before the foundation of the world i never knew you depart from from me you worker of the devil you worker of iniquity jesus doesn't deny that that that mighty works but he does deny that the holy s ghost spirit filled them they were not filled with the spirit and yet they were doing mighty works and they were rejected by the lord jesus christ the word himself for they were wicked unsaved unregenerate religious but they were reprobates to the word of god and there were the seed of satan for that day and for that hour and we have our group of that in our day that we must face face to face in men and women like ourselves the spirit of god versus the spirit of satan working through these ones so we can no one can claim that the manifestation of the holy spirit is the evidence of being spirit filled amen it's just the evidence of the spirit doing mighty acts amen the individual can have an abundance of spiritual manifestation and haven't received the word and have a mighty name in the religious realm uh bible teacher apostle bishop priest pope whatever that name is they can have all of that with the mighty works of the mighty organization that is no proof of being spirit filled or having the gene seed of god within their hearts amen praise god glory to god amen so the evidence of receiving the holy ghost today is the same as it was in the days of jesus it was to receive his word the word of truth for your day into your heart by proving you have the air to hear spiritual supernatural ear to hear praise god and by hearing that word you live jesus never stressed the importance of works but he kept stressing the importance of hearing his word hearing his word he that heareth my word and believe it on him that and many many many if you go into the book of john luke matthew you'll find over and over again he stresses the importance of and a bit of the ability to hear his word for he was searching in his day for hit for the seed that he had to call out from the midst of that religious realm the worst thing the church ever did and i'm lining up now is a to drift away from the original word of god and this is why to the pergamos age he revealed himself as the living word for he was the word made manifest and they were seeing people doing all kinds of uh things that um witchcraft and other even religious things in their day so he had to prove that he was the living word for that day and hour amen oh my praise god he knew that the church would drift away she would go into the dark ages and he knew the way men originally had gotten away from god was first to leave the word of god if anyone is going to leave god they must first begin to drift away from the word of god if you have left this word then you have left god this god thus he is pressing himself to the to the to the pergamos church the pergamos church and church age for them to recognize that he is the word they must recognize the supremacy amen of the word of god the importance and power of the word of god he was saying i am the word and if you want deity in your midst supernatural presence and power of god operating and moving supernaturally in your midst you must welcome and receive the word of god for your day amen don't let anything come between you and or the word brothers and sisters don't let nothing know how no matter how mighty no matter how much money no matter how much fame no regardless of what they flash before you what names they call you they call them names they call all kinds of names to the apostles and uh you do you think the word christian was a good uh name back then it was like a curse word to the people oh you're nothing but a christian it was something people died if they were identified as christians now people are flaunting it you know oh my don't let me just go off in the spirit of god here right now but lord of god it's the welcome the word in your heart receive the word for your day and let nothing come between you and the word of god the word is a revelation of himself amen and he's selling pergamos remember i that speak to thee am he i am the word of god made manifest glory to god hallelujah are we impressed enough by this word that we will allow the word to assimilate it to to have it go down in their soul by a supernatural osmosis where we can take it and integrate it and mix it and let it be the important ingredient in our lives lifestyle home life our relationship with husband wife friends that we have all our associates will be allowed the word of god amen hallelujah or praise god let the word come off the printed page by divine understanding and let the spirit of god integrate it and place it within your heart and within your life and your soul and god my friends will come and give you himself jesus said he is the word so when a spirit born spirit-filled child of the living god takes the word into their heart it's nothing more than than deity itself speaking through you for it's the word speaking it's the word making himself manifest by supernatural this is the mystery of preaching paul was talking about not just us standing up and talking religious words but the spirit of god activated in the mind-heart life of the believer oh praise god and the spirit speaks through the preacher the prophet the anointed servants of the living god and making himself more moo there amen and then with that kind of authority every mountain has to go satan has to flee at the anointed word of god uh in this day and in this hour and when the church returns back to this word of fullness of the revelation amen of this written word when they return back to the revelation of the word god will return back into the church and without doubt we'll see the glory of god we'll see the supernatural presence and evidence of the living god will see the wonderful works and acts of the living god back in the church of god of god again oh praises marvelous name i thank god my friends for the gift of speaking in towns i thank god for the gifts of interpretation i thank god for the gifts of discernment i thank god for the gift of miracles i thank god hallelujah for the gift of preaching anointed word of the living god i give god the glory for the spirit of god is in me the spirit of god is in you accept the word for your day and for your hour in its simplicity for god deliberately lets it come that way where it appears simple nothing to be desired of it because it's there only to appeal to those he that had an heir he her or whatever individual that was gifted anointed with that spiritual ear before the foundation of the world let them hear let my people hear my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow god bless you my brothers and sisters may the great holy spirit lead us into the pure crystal clear waters of the living word amen [Music] you
