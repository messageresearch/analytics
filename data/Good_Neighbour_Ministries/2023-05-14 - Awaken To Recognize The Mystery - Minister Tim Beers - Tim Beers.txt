Saints [Music] good to be in the house of the Lord amen together again we're together again Hallelujah amen it's always a such an exciting time to come and know that we're in the presence of the Living God knowing that we don't uh serve men but we serve him and he's real he's a reality amen that's who you come to meet with this morning amen it was is him Hallelujah and may your hearts burn within you as you listen to him along the way this morning amen you may be seated just for a minute I acknowledge uh I do not have a message directly on Mothers today but I'm going to say a few words because I have some mothers to acknowledge there's actually three of them I mean I don't have three natural mothers but three mothers in my life I don't believe in the trinity in that way but um I want to read something first and then just make a couple comments and we'll get right into the message if that's all right with you proverbs 31 13 to 31 it says a virtuous woman can be trusted her husband is happy she does her duties with pleasure she raises early she applies herself to her business she's a good manager she provides for her family she gives as she gets she governs her words her fear of God shows her genuine Beauty the law of love and kindness is written in her heart she shall rejoice in the world to come my my Hallelujah what a what a what a what a treasure amen she overcomes disappointments she Comforts others as she grows old and in her work she's praise Wherever She Goes her children and her husband call her praised and blessed have you ever thought of Rahab being a virtuous woman she was saved because of her faithfulness was she perfect no but in the middle of Crisis she found her call make this clear distinction in your heart my faith is in Jesus the son of God the savior of the world my faith isn't in my ability to believe in Jesus because sometimes I won't be able to perceive him sometimes I won't be able to feel him sometimes I will have doubts but Faith isn't in any of that my faith is in his faithfulness we're talking about mothers here a virtuous woman has a gentle and quiet spirit which is precious in God's sight she is humble not aggressive her emotions are Spirit controlled she understands that being peaceful is not a weakness rather it's putting into use the female power that God is Pursuit upon her at creation my when I acknowledge Mother's Day I acknowledge of course my by God's grace I still have my mother she's still alive and uh you know I I see a lot of these qualities and I got another mother too which is my wife she's the mother of my children and then I have a a spiritual mother which is Sister Pam we only have one spiritual natural mother and father right my wife being the mother of my children and our spiritual father and mother and I look at them and I I see without them let me put it this way without them it would be impossible for me to be complete they are powerhouses they have abilities and characteristics that I and you men can never produce even in all the weaknesses and all the the things they produce that and I thank God for real mothers and those who want to be a real mother in this world because this world is so against a family unit from a man being a man and a woman being a woman and being a lady so I want to thank God for the three mothers in my life amen and I want to thank God for each and every one of you and all the mothers that have gone on that are gone that I I can acknowledge and remember we want to thank God for them amen so let us turn to the word today I'm going to continue with my uh series on the the Great Awakening Hallelujah because I believe this is the hour of the Great Awakening of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen we're not we haven't arrived yet perfect faith is not complete Rapture and faith is not complete but we are on a journey to it and that's what we're here this morning to receive something from the Holy Spirit Amen in our hearts and our in our experience in our walk the the The Thirst and hunger inside of you this morning is searching for that and seeking for that so we may walk out of here different than we came in Hallelujah my title this morning is awakened to recognize the mystery not Mysteries the mystery may God help us to by his Spirit to show us Luke 10 19. and then we're going to go to Mark 4 11. we are precious people peculiar people a royal priesthood that's who we are and that's who God is getting us his purpose to recognize Who We Are Hallelujah behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you glory to God not with standing in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven in that hour Jesus rejoiced in his spirit you know sometimes Jesus wasn't so rejoicing in his Spirit In The Garden of Gethsemane over Judas in his soul he was always rejoicing all is well in the soul but Jesus here rejoiced in his spirit and he said I thanked the old father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father it's so it's so it seemed good in thy sight and I'm so thankful this morning amen because of that that's why I am here that's why I I have the ability to receive truth is because of that and I believe I'm rejoicing in my spirit this morning because Jesus was rejoicing knowing that he's seen me and you appear amen that he was going to reveal these truths unto us it rejoiced him and it rejoices us amen let us turn to Mark 4 11. Hallelujah and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery not Mysteries The Mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables that sin they may see and not perceive and herein they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them let us pray father thank you Lord that we're together again but now is the time father for our hearts our attention I priority this morning and and our thoughts to be on you father to be on the word we come seeking we come thirsting and hungering for you to speak to us Lord because we know that man cannot reveal anything or do anything it's not by might it's not by power but by my spirit I'll reveal these things let the spirit of Revelation come upon us this morning Lord Let the Rain Fall let the Angels encamp let the supernatural be here with us today Lord take me aside father and just use me as an instrument but Quicken the word as it goes forth into the hearts of your people reveal this mystery in a deeper clearer way this morning we ask in Jesus name God bless you as you seated Hallelujah amen thank you Lord thank you amen The Mystery of the Kingdom Jesus said the kingdom of God has come within man there are many many Mysteries many many uh principles in the word of God many things God can and does reveal to us but there's only one mystery and that takes priority over everything in our lives and our walk to God he's determined and he said it in his word in many ways he said my word is re has gone forth and it will not return to me void but it will accomplish what is set forth to do it all is this is simple my brothers and sisters this is not complicated the prophet's message Jesus's teachings and who we are is very very simple when God reveals it to you and he and he shows you you are that mystery that God is trying to get you to understand and to recognize because the great statement that the prophet has spoken in this hour is when she recognizes who she is she'll be invincible that is the plan of God that's God's determination and his will to preach the gospel not to glorify man or personalities or any gift but is the bring the word to you that he could open up the mystery of Who You Are because that changes everything when you break that Veil and you go behind the inner Veil and you recognize that mystery is a part of you and you and God are one in the same that's what takes place in the Shekinah Glory you don't need man that's why the Bible says you don't need man to teach you but the Holy Ghost will teach you the Holy Ghost uses man amen but when man teaches people and people gets takes the teachings of man where does it leave them with a bunch of knowledge emptiness but when the Holy Ghost teaches you you never forget you learn you grow and you become who you're made to be Hallelujah proverbs 3. 3 let not mercy and Truth for safety bind them above thy neck write them on the tables of thy heart so shall thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and Men trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not to thy own understanding but in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy path Hallelujah you know since the Garden of Eden since sin come in since the black curtain came over the Earth and over the human race they failed at that time and and the Blackness came out where recognizing who they are and knowing who they are disappeared at that time as what we call Sin unbelief came in back in that day and ever since that time that God kicked him out of the Garden of Eden he's trying to bring them back into that Eden again that Eden was not just a a a place but it was a Eden was a relationship that God had with man that God and man were one when Adam spoke I was somebody was saying oh you're you're like uh you know you can name this and name that like and I said yeah yeah Adam name the animals because God and Adam were one in the same so when he looked at the character of the animal amen the Revelation came and name that animal that's when you're walking with God in the spirit of God Hallelujah amen what does mystery mean something that is difficult or impossible to understand or explain absolutely you could never in yourself understand it that's why he says lean not to your own understandings but acknowledge Him know him give him the preamments and he shall direct your path you cannot understand this you cannot put this together only the Holy Ghost can reveal this to you this is a church that is built upon Revelation The Rock revelation of who he is amen of Who You Are Hallelujah glory to God brother Branham speaking here but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride now listen my brothers and sisters listen very carefully hell is against this truth what truth this truth that God is trying to reveal to us of the mystery of who you are hell is against it hell will fight you he'll fight you this morning why do people fall asleep in church how can people fall asleep listening to me or Pastor Simon but they do because hell is against it Hal wants to put you to sleep that's why brother Brown says Shake Yourself you don't want to worship Shake Yourself it's hell it's demons they fight all of us but it's our response brother Eugene if you don't mind me saying this I watch in him falling asleep and I know he's the man after God's heart he wants the word but he's fallen asleep falling asleep and I said that's enough I had to pick him up one time bring him out there and shake them say brother I didn't Pat him on the back oh my brother you didn't get enough sleep last night this nah I said brother the devil is pointing you to sleep because there's something that God wants to speak to you and reveal to you a part of the mystery of who you are to make you come awake and realize it and he's putting you to sleep wash your face do what you have to do Shake That devil off pray and rebuke it now look at him look at him now devil can't put him to sleep now because he recognized and he realized God has something for me there's something inside of me that I need to know Oh Glory to God amen all of Hell's against this truth of the revelation of this mystery but the bride is standing on it that's her stand listen Church why do you hunger why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but you let so many things get in the way of it Paul said Satan hindered us he's a Hinderer but sometimes we allow things to get in the way of this in our lives you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children yet the cares of this world you let some preacher you let somebody else get it out of you when you know way deep down in your heart you're hungering and thirsting for God you know that you know what's inside of you you're here this morning whatever condition you're in it does not change your position in Christ and your position is what's hungering and thirsted inside of you but your faith needs to rise above your condition God will raise a standard when the enemy comes in as a flood he'll make that word more real to you that Who You Are Hallelujah you see why we fight you see why we pray you see why we do the things that we do the ones who have come into this understanding and recognizes this Who We Are before any one of us here I know I can speak for myself recognized to anything we had a pastor here that had a vision that recognized amen this mystery amen and he had to get this mystery out that was his calling that was the hunger of thirst in his heart and is here today again this thing has got to go this race has got to be run right to the end we got a battle we gotta fight to the end but you know what we're winners we're Overcomers it's been promised to us we cannot fail we cannot lose you got it you got the victory handed to you Into Your Hands by the cross by the Life by the token in this hour it's been given to us that should give you enough Faith to say Lord whatever challenge I meet whatever thing I go through in my life it doesn't matter what place I'm in what place I need to be in you're going to bring me there I can face all my fears yeah we got fears I can doubt all my doubts yes we had doubts at times because we don't understand but we can face them all Hallelujah amen that's why you hunger and you thirst see is God trying to reveal it to you see the Revelation in the last days is here now it's recognizing who you are and your position in Christ is the mystery of God revealed now look the Webster dictionary defines acknowledge as recognizing the rights and authorities and status of someone or something which is certainly more intense than the way we typically think of acknowledgment if you acknowledging someone's Authority you're acknowledging that they have power over you oh my how can we die out to ourselves how can we let everything go how can we let all our understanding goals the scripture says the Bible says bring every thought under captivity to the mind of Christ to the thoughts of God how can we do that you can never understand that that's what a mystery is you can never understand it you could never figure it out we're not here to do that we're not here to apply a bunch of principles and and a bunch of rules and standards that you got to live by you've got to live better you got to live Holier this is not what this is about my brothers and sisters this isn't about getting a holy ghost surrendering your life doing what you have to do in your heart to open it up to allow the Holy Ghost to come in it's not about the law you can't live the law the law is dead without him all was fulfilled in Christ I come not to destroy the law but I fulfilled the law now you need my life inside of you Hallelujah works is good but without faith it's dead it's no good we eat the faith of who we are the faith of this mystery God is raising up not church members but he's raising up Sons and Daughters of the Living God people who will move and operate like they did in the Bible days the book of Acts we had a wave sheet in this hour amen waving over the Bride of Jesus Christ now it's time for the bride to wave Jesus Christ over the people again and I believe it's here I believe it's here I believe it's manifesting this is manifesting time for the Bride of Jesus Christ it's here he's here Hallelujah acknowledging that the word acknowledged has root in the 15th and 16th centuries is a combination of roots meaning Accord recognize and understand whereas knowledge is what you know but acknowledging is showing that you know it's not what you know but it's not you know God wants to get you from knowing what you know to know in him there's a difference Paul says I want to know him not know about him I knew about him when I was a Pharisee I knew about the Old Testament I knew about all of them rituals and their routines and the traditions and the Tabernacle everything but I want the Tabernacle I want to move in that Tabernacle I want to know him Hallelujah oh the veil was rent from top to bottom Christ came on the scene and displayed himself oh my God thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord amen The Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the world come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan's revealing works his attempt destruction of God's people and discrediting God's word that's what's taking place and you got a choice this morning we have three more agency and you got a choice this morning to allow Satan to do this in your life or to kick him out that's your choice no matter how much the word is preached to you unless you take a stand and make a choice and agree with the word and apply the word to your life Satan is not after you he's got you my life is good my life is perfect I'm a good message believer good Christian watch out watch out you might have the claws in your back holding you right down to the time he's cast in to the Lake of Fire so the time you get a revelation of Who You Are and you start understanding the mystery that you're part of that mystery is it over It's Not Over it's never over when you leave this body when you leave this world whether by death sleep or translation Rapture It's Not Over he'll fight you right there right to the end you see he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and she can do the Greater Works Hallelujah the Greater Works she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army there's an army raising up there's a mighty Army raising up with the confidence the power the authority amen of the Revelation that's behind her in her life oh God hallelujah if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit will be powerless before her what does that mean my brothers and sisters there's people that are not preaching God is coming flesh again today that God and his bride are one and the same that the son of man is being revealed in Bride form in this hour just like the godhead you can't if you preach three different people in the godhead how can you understand amen the dissension of God in flesh and how can you wonder if you don't understand how God became flesh and became man and dwelt in man the fullness of God how are you going to understand that God all the scriptures all the prophecies that are pertaining to the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour how are you going to understand how God will become one with you in your flesh you see how important it is but Satan in the framework of the Church of the message two Spirits operating and we've been well taught over the years Jacob and Esau Abel and Cain all down through the line all down through the generations the seed going all the way down and Satan fighting that seed all the way down why because there's life in the seed there's God's life in the seed fighting it trying to deceive it trying to to distract it hinder it do everything he can listen if you become a mighty warrior a mighty uh uh soldier in the army of God Amen is a man who Rises up and a woman who Rises up and recognizes this and takes a stand every day that's why it's an individual affair that's why there's a great uniting time of the Bride of Jesus Christ in the spirit but there's also a great separating time I love both of them I love the uniting and I meet my brothers and sisters but I love the separation too because that separation is private between me and my Lord he reveals secrets to me he shows me things that I don't tell nobody I don't have to tell anybody with my lips but I let the life I let the faith when the things of situations and circumstances of Life come upon me I let my faith speak for itself my faith in him and my trust in him and me knowing him that he's able to take me through everything oh God thank you Lord see Satan hates it because he knows he will be defeated just like Christ withstood his ever efforts to gain power over him in the desert you see he's doing all his efforts to gain power over you oh yeah he's after you he wants the power over you he wants to control over you but Jesus which stood every one of his Temptations every one of his efforts he could not gain power over Jesus he come to Jesus and he couldn't find nothing to pull on him brother Branham came down to the end of his life we know we have a sticky flesh but he came down to I'm not going to interpret that because you know you interpret that and people make excuses for themselves make excuses for sin in their life I'm not going to put any interpretation on that all I know is brother Brandon came down to the end of his life and he has Satan's number Satan did not control him cannot control his emotions his feelings his attitude his behavior his faith nothing God was in total possession of all that why because a man was standing there recognized in the scriptures the mystery that he was Hallelujah amen thank you Lord it is to recognize that God is one who works in our lives Empower wisdom and godliness and Justice see Ephesians 3 20. and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge and that ye might be filled with the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that worketh in US see it's not about all you're asking it's not about all you're believing it ain't nothing about you nothing what you can work up or what you can believe you know if I believe more and if I do this morning it's not about that it's so simple this thing is simple you young people this thing is simple let them in let him in Lord of your life let him in you let the master in and watch him do what is said he'll do what is said brother Brown says I'm standing here and I'm watching while he's doing all these great things let me tell you everything has a compound Revelation that has been spoken and manifested listen I'm standing here in my life you're standing in your life every day watching him do these things how can I overcome distress how can I over overcome this disappointment how can I overcome this this uh trauma in my life because I'm watching him come in and do it all I'm giving him come Lord Jesus you know I can't handle this in the flesh you know I can't do nothing in the flesh come Lord Jesus and handle the situation so we don't get in self-pity amen we don't get sold down on ourselves so sad about things disappointments come Lord Jesus all things work together for good for me they'll work for my good I don't know how but they're going to work for my good oh my because it's him Hallelujah hey he's revealing the mystery this morning oh yeah thank you Lord we will begin to acknowledge God in all our ways when we realize just how complete God is completely God has forgiven us the lord loves you so much he's forgiven you totally completely that's very important all these things are very important for us to see and understand and believe in our hearts because that's why Paul says there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ people are still walking around believe in the word of God and Satan is still putting them under condemnation because why you might sin you might have a habit you might have a weakness in your life you might fall and he puts condemnation on you you see but God is working what does he do that's why he doesn't come and condemn you that's why he doesn't come and beat you down but he comes and shows you who you are he shows you who you are you know you're my son you know that the seed of God that I place inside of you cannot sin that's who you are there is no sin and I don't impute no iniquity to you that's who you are that's your flesh that's the first birth that don't even belong to you don't even belong to you but you see when you recognize that it's totally different oh yeah I you know I'm not saying that you I confess my faults that's what the Bible says When I See This Flynn this this Flynn this flesh sin maybe I'm going to speak in tongues I don't know when I see it sin when I see it you know make mistakes get weak yes Lord father help me I know you're in me just like Jesus father the cross the beating he's seen everything he's seen everything brother my brothers and sisters and if you think that Jesus suffered like you see out there in the churches with him hanging on the cross with a couple little stripes you better go look into the crucifixion a little deeper he suffered in agony where his blood and his water separated in the Garden of Gethsemane but he said father nevertheless not in my will but thy will be done Hallelujah glory to God thy will be done Lord sometimes we're going to suffer sometimes God has to break us whatever we have to go through suffer loss in our lives God knows because there's a greater plan here a greater economy than out there and the politicians the greater economy is God's economy the mystery that he's trying to get us to recognize that's what he's determined to do and when you come in focus with that instead of saying oh God we should not be praying most of our prayers God forgive me forgive me forgive me help me help me but we should be praying in faith recognizing Who We Are you know a manager or a president of a company don't keep going and asking the employees and the other supervisors how to run that company if he does he should be getting out of there that company's going to go down but he stands there and he runs the company he makes choices and decisions and that's what God wants us to do with his word that's within us apply the token apply the word amen we learn to acknowledge God in all his ways when we read the word of God it's your guidebook to know God and grow in wisdom we know that faith comes by hearing and here and by the word of God so read your Bible read the word amen love it study it memorize it there's nothing wrong with that there's nothing contradicting of of what I'm speaking here to do that because when you do that it opens up the Chen channels of Entry to your spirit and to your soul so God can take something give him a tool if I tell you to go do the gardening outside just go do it clean up do it cut the grass and all that and I don't give you the tools the equipment to do it I don't know what it's going to look like these are the tools and equipment amen the more you desire the word of God the more you feed on the word of God the more you hunger and thirst for the word of God the more God will come draw near to me and I will draw near to you amen you young people what is out there for you I believe we got young people in here today and I don't I don't just say that to make them feel good here I don't do that I'm a straight shooter if I if I say that yeah you know you're this you're this I you know me I get in trouble sometimes but there's young people in here today that are hungering and thirsting for God what I what I say to you is what I what I went through keep searching keep seeking keep knocking don't stop night and day no matter what it takes God just like Jacob wrestling with the angel God I'm gonna sit here I'm going to sit right in my experience in this stage of life until you reveal something to me show me that I'm a part of that mystery oh my glory to God there's going to be young people that are going to have that hunger and thirst I was young I was what 22 23 years old hunger and thirst of for God people thought I was crazy all my friends and all that thought I was crazy but I was I want nothing but the Living God I don't know what I understand now but back then I don't know what I said I said to my wife I don't know what's happening I don't know if I lost my mind I thought I lost my mind but I thought I got my mind back when I came here now the devil's saying no no you really lost your mind even more than you lost it before look at the Way You Are when I thank God 32 years later Hallelujah if I'm crazy I'm crazy for the Lord Hallelujah Hallelujah you know I preached the gospel with passion is the only way I can preach it it kills me sometimes it burns me out right but I'm going to stand up here and I'm going to preach it like it's my last sermon I'm going to do everything and that's the way the love of God because he did everything for me and I'm going to stand up here and do everything I can so that God the spirit can speak to your heart and stir your life up and maybe like brother Desmond said on one word just one word that's all it takes one Revelation and breaks you into that mystery breaks you in behind the inner veil of who you are just one word you don't have to young people you don't have to know all the Mysteries you don't have to know all the quotes you don't have to what word one word of that mystery that you and God that's all it takes amen don't go be searching and seeking devil put you on I'm just going to preach what's on my heart put you on a path going this way and that way you've got to do this you got to do that you gotta you know nothing nothing one word God show me just reveal something so simple to me that I could recognize that me you have called me you have chosen me in this hour that's why I'm here that's why I recognize that God sent a prophet that's why I'm feeding on the word of God every Tuesday every Wednesday and Sunday that's why Hallelujah one word amen wasn't that refreshing did you hear that did you hear that message on Wednesday what a refreshing from the presence of the Lord you know brother Desmond it all lines up with the word today Joy and happiness oh my I get happy and I get joyful but no that's that's a portion that that's a manifested portion of Life Of God that placed in him because I seen him through hard times down times all kinds of times where you know what I would be acting totally different in the joy of the Lord but you know what I can't touch I'm going to have joy but I can't touch that but you know what I got something in my life that he can't touch you got something in your life that nobody can touch and that's what you need to come in contact with that's what your desire and your hunger and your thirst to come out who you are looking naturally people want to you know this is such an age you can be whoever you want you cannot be whoever you want and it read to the perversion of trans and all that you can be anything you want you cannot God made you a certain way God put a part of himself inside of you a character inside of you of of him and that's what you need to seek out and find don't look at one another don't look at me you can't touch me I ain't gonna look at you because I can't touch you amen I'm not interested in that I'm interested in letting the Holy Ghost amen that's in my life manifest in his fullness oh my I want to hear every day of my life well done good and faithful servant it's not just preaching the gospel but living the gospel live in this word of God help me Lord we have to be awakened to more faith Romans 1 16 from Faith unto Faith the perfect faith that was given to the bride by the opening of the word the Seven Seals are open to the bride to know who she is in this hour this is the hour of perfect Faith you see more faith is needed to overcome the Flesh in this world modern events Hallelujah we are awakened we have been ordained to be awake in this hour of deception and lies to recognize the revealed truth to be awakened to our calling and our position Awakening to our true identity in Christ This Is The Awakening time and the mature in time of the seed of God Hallelujah amen Hallelujah thank you Lord Ephesians 1 17. and Proverbs 23 . look to his understanding for our path of life the first thing that comes with a Great Awakening comes faith without faith is impossible to please God without faith we cannot see or enter into the kingdom of God then Jesus say that you cannot see or enter in the mystery you look right down from Cain and Abel Abel by faith had the ability to see the original sin just like the godhead my brothers and sisters just like the godhead if you don't see that original sin you're going to mess up the program and plan of God and the Order of God and how he brings the word and delivers you in your life because you need to recognize that that sin that happened produce death in US all truth all Mysteries all hidden things have come to the Bride of Jesus Christ for what the puff up her head the puff up herself but no there's a plan and a purpose and a design of God that all these things and the seals being opened is all combinated to let her recognize in her life how that word is going to become flesh and hurt amen is going to make her recognize the mystery when you understand the godhead when you understand the serpent seed when you understand the original sin when you understand all these things it starts placing you in your position as a son and daughter of God because it's revealing truth unto you it's shown you truth oh yes it's all part of the design of God that's why all these false doctrines and false teachings that I've even come in the message it's shaked in fighting against this truth this mystery that God is trying to get to you oh it's going to come down to it my brothers and sisters that there's going to be a great Warfare and that Warfare is going to start exploding in the message oh yes oh yes the faults against the truth are going to start clashing clashing and you know what the intellect of the Mind the knowledge of the mind just like it was in the days of Jesus when Jesus met those challenges when the prophet met those challenges the bride is going to meet those challenges the same way by Faith by Revelation by the spirit of God inside of her Hallelujah amen Ephesians 1 17 that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him you see how important to know how God became man in flesh you see God spoke himself through the prophets into existence and he came on the scene and God spoke the bride into existence in his last days and now she's on the scene there's no other way it can come no other way can come all man's ways your ways everything in all your ways and thoughts acknowledge Him He said my thoughts are hired in your thoughts my ways are higher than your ways Paul says I have to Die daily to all those things Hallelujah amen you see John recognized Jesus was the Lamb of God he saw the Holy Spirit coming down as a dove he knew he was in the presence of God he's seen the word coming to fulfill that's why he can say this is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world you know we look at that scripture and we say oh you know what because of tradition because we've been hearing it all our lives at Christmas time or or or Easter time but remember John was a cousin of Jesus remember they they they they they they in the flesh I mean Jesus was his flesh didn't belong to nobody right we understand that but they took him as cousins Step Brothers In the Flesh they grew up with him he was common he spoke to Common Language he was a carpenter he did common things he worked with his hands and think John gets anointed and comes out with a great ministry that he had Elijah and then he sees his cousin coming down the road but if he only seen his cousins he would not recognize that he would not have spoken the things that he spoke he recognized something greater than his cousin coming down the road because he said I seen the spirit of God descending upon this man like a dove he caught a revelation of who this man was and that's why he can say Jesus didn't tell him to say this is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world revelation God reveal in himself to John this is my beloved Son in whom I well pleased in that's the way it's always been and always will be Hallelujah amen and what is the mystery what is God trying to reveal to us and get to us to recognize we can see that we could recognize many things in this world many things to recognize the political the social the religious Realm even in the messes of the hour many many preachers many many sermons many different gifts but what is God through it all trying to get you to recognize all those things are good and all those things could be used of God but there's a place there's a secret place between only you and God you know a husband and wife when they get married they don't really know each other until they get married and they go into that secret chamber then they know each other that's just the Natural Things of life and you don't know him until you've been into the chamber with him till you've been with the at the cross with him till you know that you have died to yourself as much as you can at that moment in that time and he come to you and you've been with him and you know no preacher can tell you whether it's right or it's wrong whether you've been there you've been you've not been there no it's a secret between you and him just like it is between a husband and wife it's a secret there's something that takes place there there's a union a bonding that takes place there and that never stops he says I started to work inside of you he says I will finish it he said I will never ever leave you I will never ever forsake you but not only that but I will be with you and I will be in you to the end of time to the end of your time I will be in you Hallelujah let me try to just wind this down Hallelujah Jesus preaching on The Sermon on the Mount many different things about principles and many different things about our life and how we should conduct Our Lives Hallelujah amen you know Mary we know that the bride the word is in the bride like it was Mary Mary a mystery was revealed to her and when the angel came and spoke to her she didn't understand how it was going to take place how is this going to be amen but the Holy Ghost how is it brother Tim come on tell me this mystery come on preacher tell me what is this mystery but the angel said the Holy Ghost will overshadow you and do this inside of you and that's all the preacher can do is say the Holy Ghost will overshadow you and do this inside of you and bring forth this word of God Hallelujah Hallelujah amen you see God revealing to us the one thing the father is trying to get us the mystery of the Kingdom the hidden secret to us it is given to us to know it and recognize the word like it was in Mary living in the Shekinah Glory behind the Intervale is the only place that that mystery can be revealed to you that mystery is an overcoming life an overcoming life with God remember in the seventh seal Satan will try to impersonate it he'll try to impersonate everything that the church will do we notice it through the Antichrist spirit but this is one thing he cannot impersonate what I'm talking about this morning he can't touch this he says it right here there is no mimics to this there's no games there's no workup there's no plane around to this it's the life of God it's the token Hallelujah there's no way for him to know it no way it's the third poll the revealing of the word he just knows nothing about it see he doesn't understand it he doesn't know anything about this what am I trying to say here what's that mean how do you break that down that's how the bride is going to stand out in this last days that's how God is going to show her off when it's coming down to the squeeze time because Satan where he's hiding where he's trying to impersonate this that the the word of God that the prophet brung to speak to the Bride of Jesus Christ he's going to be exposed because it's going to come a time my brothers and sisters amen he cannot go just like Judas could not go to Pentecost he cannot go any farther and I believe we're at that stage and not time of maturity right now I'm talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ where she's at Hallelujah thank you Lord you look at Exodus 19. it talks about how God destroyed the Egyptians in the water and how he brought the children of Israel out of the water a type when we look back at our habits and the things that used to control our minds and our flesh we can see them drowning in the sea of God's forgetfulness I can see it my brothers and sisters I can see things that was holding me back control of me and binding me being drowned I can see them looking back I can see them my brothers and sisters and God see a forgetfulness forget those things which are behind and I'm pressing towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus press it on press it in to the kingdom of God amen take it by violence take it by force Hallelujah amen listen Paul expressing his concerns of faith in the Thessalonians I learn of your faith for fear that somehow the tempter has tempted you and our labor be in vain Paul knew that sings design was to choke off Faith from the people who would hear the word of God Hallelujah people coming you know what if God has led you here it's not because of brother Simon it's not because of brother Tim or anybody but if the spirit of God has led you here is because he wants to meet you here he wants to feed you here I could have went to any other church but God led me to a Ministry amen and I stayed with that Ministry oh yeah a lot of other Methodist churches wanted to pull me this way pull me that way but no I recognize where the spirit of God led me and that's why I stand the way I stand today and if the spirit of God has led you here then you stay here because he's going to feed you here don't let Satan pull you away and persuade you and tempt you you think God knows what he's doing when he led you here and you're happy I've seen people come and they're blessed they're happy they're growing and they listen to the devil and they go out and then their life falls down when they were happy don't you know where you're happy don't you know where you're being fat and you're satisfied because of the spirit of God why go anywhere else why go out in the desert when you're standing right here with an oasis it's not man it's a spirit of God that's feeding you let me wind this right down now Hallelujah glory to God my brothers and sisters thank you Lord Hallelujah amen thank you Lord I'll just leave some of this off and continue on this series brother Brad's speaking here in recognize your day in this message if you want to go listen to that message this week it'll be a good message for you to listen to death doesn't do nothing to a man but change has dwell in place doesn't change your nature doesn't change your faith doesn't change nothing in you but your dwell in place so which way your nature is this morning if you are a doubter of God's word you will be a doubter over there I don't care how holy you are or how you live by your own works it wouldn't change you one bit to die just your dwell in place and if you can't accept the whole word of God the way it's written you won't do it there so don't worry you won't be there you've got to accept it in his fullness this fullness no leaving nothing out no leaving not even one word out is fullness in the power of His Vindication and the revelation of what it is and what you are and what it says you are you can't leave anything else then you become a part of it you see second Timothy 3 5. people having a form of God in this but denying the power thereof from such turn away people that deny the power to live this gospel that's what I've been trying to say this mystery is this gospel the power of it to live this gospel and I'm not in a position to place anybody in any category well let me tell you I can speak about one position which is the Bride of Jesus Christ she wants this word in his fullness she wants this power to live this word this is what she wants and she'll do everything like the pearl of great price she'll turn her house her life upside down she don't care about anything but this pearl of great price Hallelujah last quote then I'll invite our pastor up the Rapture is here now in the bride the overcoming Powers here now in the bride the third pull is here now operating in her little fashions as she prays as she speaks the word of God it manifestes in her life she sees that word coming to pass when that squeeze comes to its full maturity that Mark of the Beast comes to its maturity then you'll see that third pull that spoken word be manifest in his fullness in her then she will be called an overcomer the Rapture the event will take place we are now Sons and Daughters of God what can we do now while this has taken place seek the kingdom of God first and his righteousness and all these things will be added on to you knock keep knocking the unjust judge knock Jacob I don't know why God is constantly bringing these things because you need it in your experience you needed to become a reality into your life and your walk with God keep knocking keep seeking this is the most evil darkest Ace most deception age that there is the spirit of the Antichrist is not his fullness and strongness it's gross Darkness that's why we gotta press with violence and blood into the kingdom of God don't let nothing cool you down don't let nothing don't let this devil come in and make you lukewarm and lazy and lock seek this word get all hindrance out of your life remove every sin that besets you the coming of the Lord the coming of the Rapture is at hand the bride is almost ready to take your flight get in be like the thief on the cross the Ministers of God are trying to snatch the last one out of the fire at the last minute get in it's simple my brothers and sisters I didn't I myself did not try to make this complicated this morning this mystery it's simple it's not everything that people are proclaiming it to be I'm making it out to be this thing is simple when you love your wife and your wife loves you it's simple it's not complicated you love each other and that's the way God is to us he loves us more than we can ever imagine God bless you God bless you thank you brother amen so it's wonderful that God used her brother to be such a blessing to every one of us here today were you blessed I was blessed and there are still things out of what he said that I have to keep thinking on Amen so let's remember to pray one for the other pray for the ministers that God will bless them and God will cause them to grow in their Ministry we give God all the honor and the glory here today well today is Mother's Day it's a wonderful day where we celebrate mothers unrecognized mothers actually they should be recognized every day of the year not just this one special day but thank you but every single day of the year you know throughout history and time that women have been placed as second-class Citizens is that the truth yeah okay so I want you to acknowledge it that's a fact they have been actually they were sold they were given away like like pieces of chattel um parents would um sell marry off their daughters and I ask them don't ask them whether they like the the old man or the young man or whoever he is and sell them when they're from 13 14 years upwards they sell them off or give them away to get out of debt or something else I'm telling it like it is right uh this is history and this these are facts that uh it's just like even in the so-called cultured Society women were like chattel they were like some some thing that the man owned right they didn't have control over their own lives or anything whatsoever but you know over time God brought them as he's bringing the bride into an understanding of who they really are that they would recognize themselves and they would recognize their usefulness and that they are not second class as I've always used the scriptures to say God took the woman out of the man's side is that right he did not the Bible doesn't say that he took her out from under his feet no uh God did not say that uh he took her um you know out from under his hand or something like that no but God took her from his side so I signifying she should walk beside him as a help meet a partner an assistance somebody it's as if if one walk alone and he falls will there be not no one there to help him but if to walk together if one Falls the other was able to help him or lift them up he said and again the scripture says a two-fold chord is not easily broken if there are a couple or or a man and a woman are united and walking in harmony you can't get a razor blade to go between the cracks you see you can't do it because they are one in Christ so I thank God I know the the people the young children from the Sunday school and the young people also have a presentation is that right amen okay are they ready start getting them ready they'll do a program for you and let's just sit back and appreciate it but I want you to know that I certainly appreciate mothers and I appreciate Mother's Day and I appreciate my wife over there uh just the other day somebody was asking me about my sister and I said no it's not my sister uh praise God it's my wife praise God hallelujah it go exactly it goes I was just about to say that sometime it goes the other way then they asked me if this is my oldest daughter and I'm not embarrassed about that I feel proud that I have such a young wife so I praise God for that amen and I pray that every one of you men young men in here will walk with your wife treat your wives as royalty for they are actually queens that God has given to you amen he types the woman as his queen as his bride and we ought to have that same thing within our lives oh praise God here comes our young people and we pray God will bless them and use them here today is that okay you pray God will use them amen let's encourage them [Applause] we're not just here to be Spectators we are here to be participators and to encourage them we can sit back and just look and listen like that but remember they their life's got to be watered by your uh your thankfulness your gratitude and your response to them it's very important when you're at that age because I remember teachers I remember older folks and myself that will even turn and even make a small remark and say oh that's good and that remains with young people so don't uh it's a great opportunity between when they're young until they become adult for you to be a blessing to them let's be a blessing to them in every way when they think they are just being a blessing to us we let's be a blessing back to them God bless you all here today and use you in a wonderful way proverbs 31. who can find a virtuous wife for her words is far above rubies the heart of her husband safely

want you to know that the greatest mother that we have is the Lord God himself brother Graham used to like on uh humming a little song for he's my mother my father my sister and my brother he's everything to me for he's my mother my father my sister and my brother he is everything to me and surely he's our mother the mother of us all is God not Mother Earth but mother God if you want to put it that way he is our mother and our father you see God is our mother because we were in him and um he wanted to express us that we may come and be made manifest right and we would have been made manifest as supernatural beings upon the Earth Satan circumvented that plan so birth God's birth was to come by his word but Satan circumvented it and brought Birth by a woman God turned around and said oh since you are gonna you'll be using her to pervert my word I will take the very vessel bless her blessed and use her to make that seed manifest in flesh so that I can bring them back spiritually by the word amen so ladies you are blessed to be a mother amen I said you are blessed so when God said to Mary bless the angels and blessed art thou amongst women amen now I'm talking to believers I'm talking to actual women and I'm talking to believers who in relationship to God is as a woman as a wife as a bride blessed art thou amongst all the churchgoers blessed are you among all the churches blessed are you amongst women amen because God elected you to bring forth the word amen I thank God for my own darling mother who has gone on to be with the Lord and God help every one of us because we are here because we have mothers and some of us may not want to acknowledge them if you are here today and you something between you and your mother you can make it right you can talk to her you can talk to God you can let God settle it and let this marvelous wonderful warming comforting love of a God that we love with our hearts settle down upon you and cause you to turn your entire life around you know for many years I've kept this wonderful poem and I've given it to the church here a couple of times but I'd like to do it here again because I always remember my mother uh more so Not only was she a mother but she was a believing mother and then when I received a message and brought the word to her and at first she wouldn't uh accept or take it but then she was a person given to dreams and Revelations and stuff like that uh and so she slept and then she saw in a vision the Lord uh standing on a rock and heard voices singing in the background and they were singing about Jesus my God I Know Thy Name thy name is all my trust amen and when she heard that she jumped out of the bed screaming because that's a verse that was that's left out in these modern times about Jesus being God and so when I was telling her Jesus God she was telling me of the Trinity and that night that's God revealed to her the Oneness of God and that the Jesus of the New Testament is the same Jehovah of the Old Testament one God God the father in The Son making himself manifest and so she came to believe and that hour of the night I can't remember if it was one two o'clock but I had to baptize her she will not wait and we call it a little Trench by the side of the house she did not care how muddy or whatever she wasn't going to be left out of no Rapture or nothing of that sort she had to be baptized and so I baptized her in the name of the Lord my father followed after work but thank God for that and always kept faithful and true and I give God glory for her so I'd like to
