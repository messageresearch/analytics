[22:18] ground
[22:19] we've heard the call come up hither
[22:22] come up higher
[22:24] come into the perfect word
[22:26] may the holy spirit continue to deal
[22:29] with us every one
[22:31] we live in this day when every person
[22:35] gift of god
[22:37] has to find its place and is finding its
[22:40] place
[22:42] and for the others as it was back then
[22:44] the scripture says and there was no
[22:47] place found for them
[22:50] there was no fit
[22:52] uh the jigsaw apostle when the prophet
[22:54] said it was put together they found out
[22:57] when he looked again it was the face of
[23:00] jesus christ christ revealed in his own
[23:02] word
[23:04] but if you end up with a piece that
[23:05] can't fit then
[23:08] it just doesn't come to the puzzle like
[23:10] that right you just got to leave it
[23:12] alone praise the lord god is good let me
[23:15] assure you that our
[23:17] study tonight will be very brief
[23:21] and that is definitely because uh it
[23:24] that's the way it is in the church age
[23:25] book and i'm just doing that by
[23:28] installations and staying with exactly
[23:31] what the prophet of god has said
[23:33] praise the lord so god bless you thank
[23:37] you for being here through the damp
[23:40] dark cold
[23:42] night of winter praise god hallelujah
[23:45] but we are canadians
[23:48] and nobody ever really get used to the
[23:51] cold but you manage the cold
[23:54] you just manage it you can never get
[23:56] used to it it's all relative praise god
[24:00] uh revelation chapter 3
[24:02] verse 21
[24:04] amen
[24:08] hallelujah
[24:11] oh my
[24:13] uh i remember uh going to being in my
[24:16] old country and i visited a mother of a
[24:20] friend who was still out here
[24:23] but
[24:24] she was then living by herself so he
[24:27] asked me to look her up you know and see
[24:29] how she's doing
[24:31] and when i got there she was cooking
[24:34] so
[24:35] she knows me from back home so she just
[24:37] said why come sit in the kitchen and
[24:40] while i'm here cooking and thing you
[24:42] know so she is cooking away
[24:45] and while she's cooking cut up the
[24:47] vegetables and everything else and
[24:50] put in the in the
[24:52] pan that she had there and then somebody
[24:54] came by at the same time knocking on her
[24:57] door and she turned and talked to them
[25:00] come in and then she's talking to them
[25:02] and she turned back to the
[25:05] and you know because she kept doing like
[25:07] this
[25:08] she said what in the world is going on
[25:11] here she's feeling for the stew
[25:13] and it's gone down from this
[25:21] it's gone right now well the same thing
[25:23] happens with the church
[25:25] [Laughter]
[25:27] right it's coming down to the real thing
[25:31] right
[25:32] the real thing that is not to say as
[25:35] i've said
[25:36] that those who may not still be
[25:39] physically represented here with us
[25:42] are not of the word that's not what i'm
[25:44] saying at all
[25:46] i'm just saying to you that god has it
[25:49] that way each one has to take their own
[25:52] path
[25:53] you got to take their own way praise god
[25:57] if god wants them outside for a reason
[26:00] because i've known brothers who've got
[26:03] outside people said oh they're backslid
[26:06] go out there end up in a bar
[26:09] end up in a bar
[26:11] and while in the bar witness to somebody
[26:15] and then go back to the bar another time
[26:18] and a sinner turned back and says you
[26:20] know you shouldn't be here
[26:23] [Laughter]
[26:26] now you tell me what that is you
[26:28] shouldn't be here
[26:30] somebody like you no no no no you don't
[26:32] fit in here
[26:36] glory to god you see you can run but you
[26:39] can't hide
[26:41] glory to god so we come to a real time
[26:44] of the real
[26:46] um
[26:47] personal liberty that the lord gives us
[26:50] that we are free in jesus christ and it
[26:52] brings out your colors
[26:53] it brings out right where you're
[26:55] standing at and this form of
[26:58] christianity which we all were uh
[27:01] involved in
[27:03] where um
[27:05] really
[27:06] all your things it's just all covered up
[27:10] you can't you're not really yourself
[27:13] you you feel tired you you feel this way
[27:16] you feel that way you got this problem
[27:18] that problem you just keep it to
[27:20] yourself you're covered up no no you're
[27:22] free
[27:23] praise the lord
[27:25] so thank the lord for that liberty and
[27:27] freedom that is in jesus christ because
[27:30] you're subject not to the pastor but to
[27:32] the word
[27:34] you're subject to the pastor only as a
[27:36] person put here to represent the lord
[27:39] jesus christ but you are really
[27:42] subject to the word because
[27:44] jesus christ the pastor
[27:47] and then the authority goes down down
[27:50] down right that's how it goes praise the
[27:52] lord hallelujah god bless you
[27:55] let's read the word of god
[27:58] to him that overcome it
[28:01] will i grant to sit with me
[28:05] in my throne
[28:07] even as i also overcame
[28:11] and am sat down
[28:13] with my father in his throne
[28:17] gracious father we have read your words
[28:21] now we pray
[28:22] that
[28:23] the word will live again
[28:25] may the spirit of almighty god come
[28:29] among us
[28:30] in his wonderful beautiful quiet way
[28:34] and oh god speak to us
[28:36] from the written word that we may hear
[28:40] understand
[28:41] and live
[28:43] in the name of jesus christ
[28:45] amen
[28:47] and amen praise the lord hallelujah god
[28:50] bless you please be seated
[28:56] we're speaking on this topic of the
[28:59] overcomers throne
[29:02] the overcomers throne not the great
[29:05] white throne but the overcomers throne
[29:11] the question is asked
[29:14] what are we to overcome
[29:17] what are we to overcome
[29:20] and
[29:21] this is the normal question that
[29:24] anybody will ask what
[29:26] are we
[29:28] to overcome
[29:29] however
[29:31] this scripture
[29:33] is being presented in such a way
[29:36] as not to query or to
[29:39] ask us
[29:40] what we had to overcome
[29:43] it expects you by this time to know
[29:47] or to have some understanding of what
[29:49] you're supposed to overcome
[29:52] but it is more
[29:54] uh
[29:55] oppressing matter
[29:58] of how are we to overcome what we are
[30:01] supposed to overcome
[30:03] how are we to overcome
[30:05] this is the question
[30:07] that is here before us amen
[30:11] brother branham says
[30:13] now
[30:14] it doesn't matter what we are to
[30:16] overcome
[30:17] as long as we know how to overcome it
[30:21] amen
[30:23] doesn't matter what you have to overcome
[30:25] as long as you know how
[30:28] to overcome it
[30:30] see how then
[30:32] can we overcome
[30:34] well jesus been our example he says just
[30:38] look and see
[30:39] how the lord jesus overcome
[30:42] how did he overcome
[30:44] in and we will know how we will be able
[30:49] to
[30:50] overcome
[30:51] for this will bring out the truth
[30:55] of the proposition that he's making
[30:57] right here it will bring out the truth
[31:00] of the proposition matthew chapter 4.
[31:04] he says you know
[31:05] the temptations
[31:07] that jesus faced being tempted by the
[31:10] devil
[31:11] and every one of us knows because he
[31:14] said it if he's going to be tested he's
[31:18] going to be persecuted if he is going to
[31:20] be tried if he is going to be put into
[31:24] those positions he says
[31:27] any servant are you greater than your
[31:29] lord you're going to be tested too
[31:32] you're going to be tried to
[31:34] you've got to be proven by the word
[31:38] like we mentioned on sunday how that god
[31:41] allowed us to come from his mind is
[31:44] thought
[31:44] down here
[31:46] praise god hallelujah so that we can go
[31:50] on a journey and on that journey he will
[31:55] be proving his word
[31:58] he taped it out by israel
[32:01] when they went into the wilderness
[32:04] and all the trials that they had
[32:07] he said i took them
[32:09] to go into the wilderness because i
[32:12] wanted to try them and prove them
[32:16] hallelujah
[32:18] proving his word
[32:20] so is it today
[32:22] you might have a two million come out
[32:25] and come into the church
[32:27] but the journey
[32:29] is to try them
[32:32] and to prove them
[32:34] let the spirit of god try and prove by
[32:37] the various
[32:39] things that will come into their lives
[32:43] they'll have the choice to be proven
[32:46] by him praise the lord
[32:50] you see
[32:51] jesus was tempted of the devil
[32:55] and he overcome
[32:57] personal temptations of the devil by the
[33:01] word
[33:03] he put the emphasis here
[33:06] personal temptation
[33:08] now as you remember the scripture it
[33:11] says that jesus was tempted with every
[33:15] single temptation you common to man
[33:20] just just just
[33:21] expanding your own mind and thoughts
[33:24] what that tells you
[33:26] he
[33:27] that's why the bible says he was
[33:30] completely
[33:32] theologians will say he was
[33:34] a very man completely man
[33:37] but yet he was completely god
[33:40] amen but as a man
[33:44] the bible says he was tempted with every
[33:47] form of temptation
[33:50] that he might be a high priest
[33:53] that can be touched
[33:56] with the feelings of our infirmities our
[33:59] weaknesses
[34:00] our weaknesses our failures
[34:03] it's not god is in the heavens he's so
[34:06] holy that he doesn't know what you're
[34:08] going through
[34:09] the queen is in our palace the king is
[34:11] in his palace he doesn't know what the
[34:13] common person is going through
[34:16] no
[34:16] dumb from his glory of a living story
[34:21] our god and savior came and jesus was
[34:24] his name
[34:26] to walk among his subjects
[34:28] and the bible says to be tempted to
[34:31] betrayed that he might no praise god
[34:36] hallelujah you say oh god didn't know
[34:38] well you must understand that while he
[34:41] was god us in the form of god elohim
[34:45] there was no there's none above him
[34:48] there's none below him
[34:49] there's none beside him
[34:51] nobody was there ever to tell him what
[34:54] to do or tell him go here or go there so
[34:57] he had to come down here to be able to
[35:00] experience that
[35:02] years ago i preached on that message
[35:04] learning obedience bible says in
[35:06] philippians how that he came that he
[35:09] might learn obedience
[35:12] hallelujah
[35:14] just think god in the head was not a
[35:17] soul there is no being nothing above him
[35:20] nobody to tell him do this do but he
[35:24] come down and come a child in mary's and
[35:27] joseph care so that he could be told
[35:30] what to do
[35:31] not because he didn't know what to do
[35:34] but he wanted to know how we feel how
[35:37] how we what we go through
[35:40] whatever whatever temptation trial you
[35:43] can think about
[35:45] he experienced it so that as a doctor
[35:48] assault doctor he will know exactly how
[35:51] you feel emotionally physically
[35:53] spiritually in every aspect of your life
[35:57] he is fully conscious of what you are
[36:00] going through
[36:02] what if or
[36:03] he
[36:04] was tempted by the devil satan
[36:08] see
[36:09] with personal temptation
[36:12] praise god
[36:14] personal
[36:15] is trying to bring out the truth which
[36:17] can't be expressed in word here but it
[36:19] was direct for that person
[36:22] hallelujah is praise god so you must
[36:26] understand that your temptations
[36:30] oh praise god hallelujah
[36:33] they're personal to you brother they're
[36:35] personal to you
[36:37] uh when i said that what i thought about
[36:40] is how google and all these companies
[36:43] right now
[36:44] are watching
[36:45] what you interested in on the internet
[36:48] what you look at what you listen to what
[36:50] you look at whatever whatever your
[36:52] search you made and they're keeping a
[36:54] copy of that
[36:56] and so they know your profile and they
[36:58] know exactly
[37:00] what pictures what words what everything
[37:04] to put on that internet to attract your
[37:08] attention
[37:10] to tempt you
[37:12] to buy uh their soap soap that they're
[37:15] selling
[37:16] or or
[37:18] buy their food or buy something they
[37:20] know exactly
[37:22] what to put to get your attention and
[37:26] that is what you call
[37:28] personalized
[37:31] by analytics they personalize it right
[37:34] down to you the individual
[37:37] now we know of course that satan is the
[37:39] master of that
[37:41] because this is what the word here is
[37:43] telling us
[37:44] that he comes not just with any random
[37:47] temptation well all human beings respond
[37:50] this way or all human beings no no no no
[37:52] he's gone deeper than that
[37:55] and he's come down to the person and how
[37:58] they act
[37:59] right because he got the army of what
[38:02] the bible calls familiar spirits
[38:05] and of course if you understand familiar
[38:08] spirits they don't do nothing else
[38:09] they're just watching you i'm reporting
[38:12] back well you've done this he done that
[38:14] she done this she done that you've done
[38:15] that that's all they do they're watchers
[38:17] they're listeners and they watch
[38:19] everything brother batman said that
[38:20] that's why i don't just say anything
[38:23] before i do it you know because they're
[38:25] running
[38:27] back and forth like that right so that's
[38:29] where we are to and fro to and fro
[38:30] that's all they do for that devil's in
[38:33] the air he's a prince of the power of
[38:35] the air praise god and this they employ
[38:39] this personalized
[38:41] means of temptation
[38:45] but he overcome the personal temptations
[38:48] of satan he overcome them
[38:51] no matter what the devil threw at him
[38:54] no matter if he has a bucket full or a
[38:56] ball full the words he overcome
[39:01] the prophet said but how did he overcome
[39:04] by the word
[39:06] hallelujah every time
[39:09] he came to him see
[39:12] with three major trials
[39:15] and those trials
[39:18] they
[39:19] correspond exactly to the temptation of
[39:23] the garden of eden
[39:26] amen see what he had
[39:29] is what they had
[39:32] but listen to this
[39:33] i see here that in the garden
[39:37] man
[39:38] was called ruler with god
[39:42] on the earth
[39:45] core ruler with god
[39:47] on the earth
[39:49] and
[39:50] woman
[39:51] was called ruler
[39:53] with the
[39:54] man on the earth
[39:57] but then sin
[40:00] caused them to lose their rulership
[40:04] you know all the scriptures where he
[40:06] says you know whatever you say that's
[40:07] what it's going to be you know you tell
[40:09] the tree you tell this whatever you know
[40:12] you have all the powers over everything
[40:14] but here they they lost their call their
[40:18] core rulership
[40:20] so
[40:20] jesus or god became a man
[40:25] that he might undergo
[40:28] the same tests trials and temptations
[40:32] that they had
[40:33] and as their representative
[40:37] could overcome that
[40:39] and free the rest of us
[40:42] that we might go back to that position
[40:46] of core rulership that we have with god
[40:51] hallelujah
[40:53] what were
[40:54] the temptations
[40:56] you know them
[40:58] the lust of the flesh
[41:02] the lust of the eye
[41:05] and the pride of life
[41:07] and you just gotta look around you watch
[41:09] the tv listen and those are the same
[41:12] three things the devil is pouring them
[41:14] out right now
[41:16] pouring them out left right and center
[41:19] again but this is not to test jesus back
[41:22] there on the top of the mountain
[41:27] but it's to test the bride
[41:30] hallelujah the son of man being revealed
[41:34] again
[41:36] and he is tested when he gets to the top
[41:38] of the mountain
[41:40] he's like oh
[41:42] i've got it now i i really got the
[41:44] message i got the word i'm gonna go
[41:46] praise god yes but my friends the giants
[41:50] are in the land
[41:52] the temptations are in the land
[41:55] the devil is in the land
[41:57] and you've got to be on top of the word
[42:01] because that's the only way you will be
[42:04] able to overcome as by the word
[42:08] he applied the word you must supply the
[42:11] word
[42:12] he gave the devil the word test you give
[42:14] him the word death
[42:16] hallelujah that's the only way that we
[42:20] will be able to overcome hallelujah you
[42:23] see
[42:26] he fell
[42:27] and he repeats she felt a personal
[42:31] temptation of satan i want to emphasize
[42:34] that personal temptation
[42:36] not group
[42:37] temptation
[42:39] right
[42:40] you see
[42:41] all human beings because
[42:43] all human beings do have certain common
[42:46] things that we are is commonplace to all
[42:48] of us that we respond to because we are
[42:51] human
[42:52] but other than that
[42:54] we come down to individuality
[42:58] and each one is an individual we don't
[43:00] even like the same colors that one
[43:01] another likes
[43:03] we may happen we may happen to like the
[43:05] same color like the other person
[43:08] we may happen to like the same uh ice
[43:12] cream
[43:13] you know or have the same taste in
[43:16] something but we are not the same
[43:20] we all got likes and dislikes that are
[43:22] totally different and that is what satan
[43:25] knows and he zeroes in on that
[43:28] you see he said so
[43:31] eve
[43:32] fell
[43:34] under
[43:35] personal
[43:36] temptation in the garden
[43:39] of eden
[43:41] see
[43:43] she fell by failing to use the word
[43:49] adam fell
[43:51] he fell
[43:53] in disobedience to the word of god
[43:57] amen
[43:59] but jesus
[44:01] didn't fall he overcame
[44:03] by the word
[44:05] praise god how can we overcome how shall
[44:08] we overcome standing on the lord
[44:12] we overcome by the world
[44:15] we have come by jesus christ in us
[44:18] we ever come he said how can you
[44:20] overcome
[44:22] you overcome by him who has already
[44:25] overcome
[44:27] that lives in you and your works your
[44:29] cease from your works
[44:32] and he the overcomer the lion of the
[44:35] tribe of judah the mighty conqueror he
[44:38] does the overcoming for you through you
[44:42] paul said i thank god that the power of
[44:45] god worketh in me mightily
[44:48] amen not by works what we have done but
[44:51] by his mercy by his grace or his love
[44:55] that we overcome oh blessed be the name
[44:58] of the lord god hallelujah amen go
[45:02] rulership amen my friends i tell you we
[45:06] are in this age we are tested we are
[45:09] tempted we are on the personal
[45:12] temptation my reaction to the spirit
[45:16] of this age may be different to your
[45:18] reaction
[45:20] the the spirit of this age of leodisia
[45:24] is testing every single one of us
[45:27] in its own way we are being tested like
[45:31] that we have been tested not only by the
[45:34] spirit of the age
[45:36] but by the
[45:38] sins of the age
[45:41] every age
[45:43] you understand
[45:44] uh has a major sin
[45:48] a major thing
[45:50] that moved it
[45:51] but we have down into the nordician
[45:54] church age
[45:55] where we are under
[45:58] the temptations of all of the seven
[46:01] deadly sins
[46:02] because all of them compiled now
[46:06] brother branham puts it this way if we
[46:08] go to it personalizing it all them
[46:11] demons that were in them egyptians that
[46:13] got drowned in that red sea go down
[46:16] there to babylon with nebuchadnezzar and
[46:19] them down there again oh my he said when
[46:22] they get they come right down and they
[46:25] end up with hitler right i'm just
[46:27] jumping over things and they end up
[46:29] there again
[46:30] oh my and see
[46:33] now when they got killed off many of
[46:35] them they're gonna scatter and gone to
[46:36] this country gone to that country but
[46:38] the same devils he says just like how
[46:41] god takes his man but not the spirit
[46:44] that was on the man the same way those
[46:47] devils come off the is look for another
[46:49] body look for another person to attempt
[46:51] to influence to manipulate and to move
[46:54] that's what is happening right now
[46:57] oh
[46:58] my brother sister so we see that we all
[47:02] become what tempted
[47:05] by the pressures
[47:07] the perils of this age
[47:12] not one of us can escape it how you
[47:15] gonna be a son
[47:16] if you don't allow yourself to be
[47:18] chastened
[47:19] you don't allow yourself to be tried
[47:21] matter of fact when you start to counter
[47:23] it all joy that you're going through the
[47:25] fiery trials for the trying your fate
[47:28] work and patience because it is
[47:30] identifying to you that god cares for
[47:34] you and he recognizes you as a son a
[47:37] child a daughter
[47:38] you're one of his or he won't even chase
[47:41] on you he won't even worry with you the
[47:43] devil's already got you you're on
[47:45] himself so he will look but he wants to
[47:47] shape you
[47:48] he wants to bring you up the way he
[47:50] wants you to be
[47:52] amen he wants us to act like jesus
[47:56] who was uh you know a representation of
[47:59] the wave shift of who we should be like
[48:02] amen so you allow this precious to come
[48:05] and problems to come your way
[48:08] amen oh my goodness you say good
[48:11] problems
[48:12] my lord if you see the end then you will
[48:15] understand what it is to have a good
[48:17] problem you know job couldn't understand
[48:20] his wife couldn't understand but job
[48:22] looked beyond the problem and he saw the
[48:25] end of it and he said behold very deeply
[48:29] oh praise god and that's how the
[48:32] believer you must start out not seeing
[48:34] the end of the problem you may start
[48:37] that way you'll be frustrated like
[48:39] anybody else again not seeing the end
[48:41] but as you pray as you walk as you wait
[48:44] the holy spirit will make known to you
[48:46] and you still you have a shout of
[48:48] victory even before the thing comes to
[48:51] pass
[48:52] hallelujah praise god hallelujah amen so
[48:57] they failed on the personal temptation
[49:01] but jesus christ overcame
[49:05] my personal temptation you see
[49:08] he had to overcome
[49:10] because
[49:12] there was nothing that satan could put
[49:14] on him
[49:17] you know
[49:19] he was like a teflon
[49:21] there's nothing nothing could stick to
[49:23] him
[49:25] the bible says in all points
[49:28] tried tested tempted and not found not
[49:33] once
[49:35] not once
[49:37] hallelujah total complete overcomer
[49:42] you see prophet said you understand
[49:45] satan knew the word
[49:48] and he even caught into the word to
[49:50] jesus in the temptation did not the lord
[49:53] says you throw yourself down either
[49:55] angels will bear you up he quoted the
[49:58] word to him to make him disobey the word
[50:02] is that right
[50:04] hallelujah if you fall the angels will
[50:07] do that but not go top of a mountain and
[50:09] throw yourself out off committing to
[50:12] recite and then the oh jesus should have
[50:15] saved me no
[50:16] no or daniel jump in the fire so
[50:19] therefore i'm going to jump in the fire
[50:21] and prove god no he didn't tell you to
[50:24] jump in the fire he told danielle to go
[50:26] in the fire praise god
[50:29] if he told you then he'll be with you is
[50:31] that right
[50:32] but he didn't tell you and that's what a
[50:34] lot of christian thinks a lot of
[50:36] christians think that way and that's the
[50:38] pentecostal mentality because he said
[50:40] thou shalt drink any deadly thing it
[50:42] shall not harm thee give me that bottle
[50:44] of poison there nothing can happen to me
[50:46] you'll die
[50:49] you'll die like anybody else
[50:52] you see oh
[50:54] i can go there and covet won't do me
[50:56] nothing maybe god will allow you to you
[50:59] know
[51:00] pass through like like myself you know
[51:03] there in africa and passing take a taxi
[51:07] and driving to the refugee camp
[51:09] you know and uh driving in this road
[51:12] through the desert and trees are around
[51:15] but not big trees
[51:17] and the mountains on both sides stopping
[51:19] this big tall
[51:21] huge ants nest and i'm saying like tall
[51:23] like the top of this roof of this
[51:25] building big mess right those are the
[51:28] kind of ants when they see their march
[51:31] they're clearing an area right so we
[51:34] passed right through when we got to the
[51:35] um and the gentleman says oh so uh how
[51:38] did you come where is your
[51:40] your outriders or your protector because
[51:43] usually you don't come unless you got
[51:44] guards and
[51:46] you know soldiers or police with guns to
[51:49] protect you because you have robbers
[51:52] murderers robbers called turkanas that
[51:54] come down off of those hills
[51:56] and
[51:58] you know they just kill everybody like
[52:00] that and we pass through
[52:03] and we always laugh when we talk about
[52:06] it because we said those men must look
[52:09] off the mountain
[52:12] nobody that's stupid
[52:16] why would they stop and looking at aunt
[52:20] ness and looking at a real camel to see
[52:23] what it is and that and this got to be a
[52:26] drop
[52:28] and they must have thought this was some
[52:30] kind of a trap and maybe waiting for
[52:32] them to charge them and then the army is
[52:34] going to move in so they didn't make any
[52:36] move
[52:38] you know the next day they shot up an
[52:40] entire bus on the same route
[52:43] an entire bus of about 30 people were
[52:46] wiped out on the same route and we drove
[52:50] on that route and came back on the same
[52:54] route and we were left alone we were not
[52:56] even touched
[52:58] amen
[52:59] but my friends
[53:01] i want you to know
[53:03] that jesus regained our core rulership
[53:08] the devil couldn't find anything on him
[53:10] he could not touch him in any possible
[53:12] way
[53:13] praise the name of the lord because he
[53:16] overcame by the word
[53:19] see
[53:20] right now
[53:22] let me say this
[53:24] that is the only way for you to be an
[53:27] overcomer let me repeat
[53:30] how many here wants to be an overcomer
[53:34] the only way
[53:36] for you to become an overcomer
[53:40] also is the only way you can know if you
[53:45] are even now overcoming
[53:49] hallelujah
[53:51] because
[53:52] the word cannot fail
[53:55] the wording you can't fail
[53:58] because you already caught the
[54:00] revelation
[54:01] that i'm relying on myself
[54:04] i'm not even going to rely on my own
[54:05] wisdom
[54:07] i'm not going to even rely on the
[54:08] reports that men come to me
[54:10] and say oh the plane got to go you can't
[54:13] go on the plane
[54:15] but when the son of god and god says no
[54:18] that has to wait until he or she gets on
[54:20] it has to wait it's as simple as that i
[54:23] don't know what the circumstance around
[54:25] it but god can change any circumstances
[54:29] god could change the heart of any man or
[54:32] woman
[54:33] oh he's the president oh he's the king
[54:35] you know that that's good you know one
[54:37] time i i was working under this old
[54:40] italian gentleman that was teaching me
[54:42] carpentry and uh you know i was saying
[54:45] oh my goodness i said man you know
[54:49] the boss
[54:51] this or the boss maybe that i don't know
[54:53] i can't do this then that quiet voice
[54:56] speaker and said yeah well who's who's
[54:58] the boss
[54:59] who is his boss
[55:01] he may be your boss but i'm the boss of
[55:04] bosses
[55:05] so
[55:06] it's not you don't have to go talk to
[55:08] him you talk to me
[55:09] and then i tell him what to do and then
[55:12] he'll tell you what to do so don't worry
[55:14] about boss and king and president
[55:17] respect them for their position but let
[55:20] them remember that there's a great judge
[55:22] above all these judges there's a king
[55:24] above all these kings there's a king of
[55:26] kings there's a judge about all the
[55:28] judges there's a mighty god hallelujah
[55:31] that rules over everything
[55:34] and he's the word and he cannot fail
[55:38] for he is god he cannot fail he keeps
[55:41] his word oh thank god you see
[55:45] after all that jesus overcame also
[55:51] all
[55:52] the world systems
[55:54] of religions of his day
[55:58] he's not saying it outright but so must
[56:01] the bride and the true believer
[56:04] overcome all the world systems
[56:07] of religion
[56:09] of this day
[56:11] all that will come to you as the as the
[56:14] theologians repeatedly and used the word
[56:17] theologians here repeatedly badgered him
[56:21] badgered him with questions badgered him
[56:24] but he just constantly quietly applied
[56:29] the word
[56:31] why the word is the word
[56:34] so a real christian don't have to argue
[56:37] because it's not my word
[56:39] and the word just says this
[56:42] you can argue with that if you want to
[56:45] but truth
[56:46] is stated truth
[56:49] truths don't change
[56:51] it remains
[56:52] forever and you can't change it
[56:55] there's nothing to argue about
[56:57] we just state it leave it and you go
[57:00] meditate on it think upon it argue with
[57:03] it fight on it with it if you want to
[57:05] but the word does not change
[57:09] he overcame came them how did he
[57:11] overcome them theologians how did he
[57:14] overcome them the world system of his
[57:16] day
[57:17] by applying the word
[57:20] how shall we overcome in our day by
[57:23] applying the word oven theologians over
[57:27] the church systems denominational
[57:29] systems the social world system how do
[57:33] we overcome the cosmos uh around us amen
[57:37] we have a come by
[57:39] applying the word
[57:41] i don't mean just applying the bible but
[57:44] applying the word with revelation
[57:47] this is what
[57:48] this is what the uh brother brandon
[57:51] later on says confuses them i think he
[57:53] says it here amen
[57:56] hallelujah it utterly con they were
[57:59] utterly
[58:00] confused
[58:02] by the wisdom that he had
[58:05] hallelujah
[58:06] and that is what has been given to us
[58:10] hallelujah
[58:12] back then it was solomon
[58:14] but now a greater than solomon is here
[58:17] hallelujah and a part of him is in me
[58:21] in you
[58:22] no matter what you think about yourself
[58:24] paul said god is greater even than your
[58:26] own heart
[58:28] oh my
[58:30] i am this i am that you call yourself
[58:32] down you put yourself down you can put
[58:34] yourself down how much you shouldn't but
[58:37] if you put yourself down i am this time
[58:39] that i always fail when i do the
[58:41] scenario
[58:42] but paul said that may be so but god is
[58:46] greater than your heart
[58:48] you say i'm a loser god says you're a
[58:50] winner
[58:52] you say oh my i don't know how i'm going
[58:54] to do this
[58:55] well the bible says you're an overcomer
[58:59] you don't overcome by yourself you
[59:00] overcome by him that is already in you
[59:04] sometimes you stand there you don't even
[59:06] know how you're going to answer somebody
[59:08] hallelujah and the holy spirit be said
[59:11] the holy spirit but you yourself going
[59:13] to answer them but you're going to know
[59:15] that that wasn't just you answering them
[59:17] that was the holy spirit that answered
[59:19] through you because you don't know where
[59:20] the wisdom come from
[59:22] hallelujah like brother branham in the
[59:24] courtroom when the fellow said well
[59:27] you're going to have to pay a hundred
[59:28] and some thousand dollars in taxes
[59:31] because you gave all this money and you
[59:33] and this and that and these people talk
[59:36] away to all these people you got to pay
[59:38] tax on it and you this and that
[59:40] brother brown said well sir
[59:42] what else can i do
[59:44] uh i'm just not worried about myself but
[59:47] i'm just sorry for those poor people
[59:50] that have to go paying
[59:52] taxes on a gift something that i gave to
[59:55] them that they didn't come and beg or
[59:58] ask me for but i felt led to give them
[1:00:01] the lord i said no no no no they don't
[1:00:03] have to pay any tax on that because it
[1:00:06] was a free gift they didn't come to you
[1:00:08] and ask or anything
[1:00:10] then the holy spirit says now now you
[1:00:12] speak well then i don't have to pay on a
[1:00:15] hundred thousand because i never asked
[1:00:17] anybody for a penny in my life
[1:00:22] he says no that's not so here that's
[1:00:23] impossible give me your key right now
[1:00:26] before you go to the courtroom give me
[1:00:27] the key to your mailbox and he said you
[1:00:30] sure he gave him the key to the mailbox
[1:00:32] and they check it and check it for
[1:00:35] almost a month
[1:00:36] they couldn't find a letter going out
[1:00:40] asking for funds for money or for
[1:00:43] offerings
[1:00:44] all they can see is people sending funds
[1:00:49] to help the ministry in every way and so
[1:00:52] the government had to pay him back pay
[1:00:55] him back all that money but it happened
[1:00:58] because he said it's not i am wise
[1:01:01] he he couldn't go playing around with a
[1:01:03] liar but all of a sudden
[1:01:05] just a simple thing the spirit just
[1:01:08] spoke out so that's how we got to relax
[1:01:10] just trust god amen no matter who you
[1:01:13] have to face
[1:01:15] amen they're carrying on in front of you
[1:01:17] let them carry on because that's all
[1:01:19] that's all the life they got
[1:01:21] when it's over they don't have nothing
[1:01:22] else unless god would save them so you
[1:01:25] are an overcomer
[1:01:26] amen praise god don't forget that
[1:01:30] always say that to yourself i am an
[1:01:32] overcomer
[1:01:34] hallelujah praise god listen you're not
[1:01:37] boasting because it's not you you're uh
[1:01:40] in god david said i boast all the day
[1:01:43] long

[1:01:46] overcomer and he lives in me

[1:01:58] had over there and this man with a
[1:02:00] crippled guy jump out the chair and this

[1:02:05] brother fandla told me this is personal
[1:02:08] he says he says brother

[1:02:16] things that you did

[1:02:23] that man turned and he says what did you
[1:02:26] say ernie
[1:02:29] he said oh nothing not he says come on
[1:02:32] ernie you know better than that
[1:02:38] he said well you know i thought you were
[1:02:40] kind of boasting on your ministry and
[1:02:43] this and that uh what
[1:02:46] happened in your ministry he says yeah
[1:02:48] you're right
[1:02:49] he says but you didn't listen closely i
[1:02:51] wasn't boasting saying i did it i was
[1:02:55] boasting on god
[1:02:57] i'm boasting on the lord i'm posting on
[1:03:00] the things he'd done he just happened to
[1:03:02] use me but i was bossing on the lord

[1:03:08] i boast all that they love
[1:03:11] all the day long i boast in the lord

[1:03:24] listen
[1:03:26] hebrews 5 7.
[1:03:30] about jesus
[1:03:32] who in the days of his flesh when he had
[1:03:35] offered up prayers and supplications
[1:03:39] with strong crying this is jesus praying
[1:03:43] with strong crying praise god
[1:03:46] and with tears
[1:03:48] see
[1:03:50] my god
[1:03:51] that was able to save him from death and
[1:03:55] was heard
[1:03:57] in
[1:03:58] that
[1:04:00] he
[1:04:01] just a minute in that he feared
[1:04:04] though he were a son
[1:04:06] yet learned he obedience
[1:04:11] right he learned obedience like i
[1:04:14] explained to you before he never came
[1:04:16] under that kind of a situation oh my he
[1:04:19] was always the big boss
[1:04:22] and nobody telling him but when that
[1:04:24] boss come down as an undercover boss
[1:04:27] and move in his own company
[1:04:30] he has got to let all them workers push
[1:04:33] him around tell him to move that box
[1:04:35] over there but they don't know who
[1:04:36] they're talking to
[1:04:39] right but he did that deliberately so he
[1:04:41] can know what's going on
[1:04:44] amen praise god when he's finished he
[1:04:46] goes right back up this presidential
[1:04:48] chair
[1:04:49] when the war when the worker comes in
[1:04:51] later on to see who's the boss he's the
[1:04:54] guy that he was pushing around down
[1:04:56] there oh we thank god we have a mighty
[1:04:59] god like that
[1:05:02] what condescension
[1:05:04] bringing us redemption
[1:05:06] oh praise god that in the dead of night
[1:05:09] when we had not one faith hope inside he
[1:05:13] learned obedience amen
[1:05:16] now then
[1:05:17] there will not be one person
[1:05:21] who will sit
[1:05:23] in the throne of the lord jesus christ
[1:05:26] unless he has been living
[1:05:29] by the word
[1:05:31] hallelujah
[1:05:33] now the scene is changing
[1:05:36] all through your life's journey we're
[1:05:38] singing this song
[1:05:40] standing on the promises of christ my
[1:05:43] king and if you were to think carefully
[1:05:47] all the time most of the songs we're
[1:05:49] talking about it talks about christians
[1:05:52] standing on the promises standing on the
[1:05:54] word standing by the word holding on to
[1:05:57] the word but now he is saying
[1:06:01] to him that overcometh i will grant
[1:06:06] to him
[1:06:08] to sit
[1:06:10] with me
[1:06:11] in my throne
[1:06:12] even as i also and i'm set down with my
[1:06:16] father in his throne so you don't have
[1:06:19] to stand by the word anymore
[1:06:22] i'm not talking about right now
[1:06:24] you're standing by the word now
[1:06:26] but you completely overcome
[1:06:29] and you pass through that perfect
[1:06:30] realization
[1:06:32] you come to a place of perfect rest in
[1:06:34] christ
[1:06:36] you're seated on that word
[1:06:38] settled
[1:06:40] hallelujah
[1:06:41] you know you're sitting down you know
[1:06:44] what sit down mean it's like when uh
[1:06:47] when uh stephen was being killed
[1:06:50] uh
[1:06:51] he praised god he looked up and he saw
[1:06:54] jesus standing
[1:06:55] well he was not supposed to be standing
[1:06:57] at that point he was supposed to be
[1:06:59] sitting but it shows the respect when a
[1:07:01] king get up out of his throne to
[1:07:04] welcome home his
[1:07:06] one of his knights or one of his men
[1:07:08] amen so he stood up in respect to
[1:07:11] stephen praise god but in actual fact
[1:07:14] he's seated at the right hand and
[1:07:17] there's the scripture he's seated at the
[1:07:18] right hand of god which means seated in
[1:07:21] a place of power and the supreme
[1:07:23] authority is back to his power and
[1:07:26] supreme authority and he is now seated
[1:07:29] and now he is saying when you overcome
[1:07:32] you will also
[1:07:34] come back as a bride as a wife back into
[1:07:38] core rulership with me seated in the
[1:07:40] throne and he or she or him or they or
[1:07:45] my children who have overcome will set
[1:07:48] with me back to their original core
[1:07:51] rulership that they had in the very
[1:07:54] beginning none
[1:07:57] listen
[1:07:58] let me tell you
[1:08:02] even all your prayers i'm closing
[1:08:05] all your fastings
[1:08:08] all your repentances
[1:08:11] no matter what you bring and present to
[1:08:15] god
[1:08:16] none of that
[1:08:17] will gain you
[1:08:20] anything
[1:08:21] it will not gain you the privilege
[1:08:24] of sitting down with him in that throne
[1:08:28] it will only be granted
[1:08:31] to the word bride it will only be
[1:08:34] granted to co-rulers
[1:08:37] like a man and his wife the core rulers
[1:08:39] of that home amen praise god it's the
[1:08:42] same thing none will set with him amen
[1:08:46] you see
[1:08:47] as the throne of a king is shared with
[1:08:49] his queen
[1:08:51] she is united with him
[1:08:54] hallelujah so are they who have overcome
[1:08:59] by the word even as he is the word
[1:09:02] they will share the throne hallelujah
[1:09:06] praise god don't you understand the word
[1:09:08] now coming forth to you all through this
[1:09:11] time now your understanding open up the
[1:09:13] light is shining in the dark audition
[1:09:15] age the evening lights have come evening
[1:09:18] on the standing evening revelation
[1:09:20] shining in the midst of this blackout of
[1:09:22] the age that we're living in here and in
[1:09:25] the midst of all that praise god you are
[1:09:29] going to be seated with him in his
[1:09:32] throne and share his throne amen so he's
[1:09:36] telling you and i put it i just wrote
[1:09:38] this in my column here and my thing here
[1:09:41] only those who have the election
[1:09:46] and privilege
[1:09:48] of having the
[1:09:49] supernatural spiritual marriage
[1:09:53] through invisible union
[1:09:56] of christ
[1:09:58] the anointed word
[1:10:00] and his bride who believes him
[1:10:04] hallelujah
[1:10:05] praise god
[1:10:07] and
[1:10:08] none can take that position
[1:10:12] for what god
[1:10:14] had joined
[1:10:16] let no man put asunder
[1:10:19] so if god unites
[1:10:22] elects and unites that individual
[1:10:25] with the word of god
[1:10:27] they have eternal security
[1:10:30] none can take it away
[1:10:31] none can separate it
[1:10:34] none can break the bonds that god has
[1:10:36] set there
[1:10:38] not even paul is trying to save you see
[1:10:40] the extent of this thing he said not
[1:10:42] even you with yourself did it
[1:10:45] is that right
[1:10:46] no lots of people never understood why
[1:10:48] brother branham went downtown and sat
[1:10:51] down with this young brother and her
[1:10:53] brother is drinking beer and even asked
[1:10:55] him uh bill would you go and buy him and
[1:10:58] said no you know i can't do that charlie
[1:11:00] i can't do that praise god and then
[1:11:03] later on in another book you hear
[1:11:05] brother brandon speaking he says you
[1:11:07] know charlie died and he's just gone now
[1:11:10] but thank god
[1:11:12] god took his child home
[1:11:16] is that right
[1:11:17] a backslidden brother
[1:11:20] goes out there in the world and drinks
[1:11:22] himself to death
[1:11:24] and the prophet doesn't stand there
[1:11:26] condemning him see i know that would
[1:11:28] have happened because he backs light
[1:11:30] from afterward don't believe the message
[1:11:32] anymore and that's what happens
[1:11:34] no you don't know nothing
[1:11:38] none of us we don't know anything
[1:11:40] you that's why paul said you better be
[1:11:42] careful try and work out your own
[1:11:45] salvation with fear and trembling
[1:11:49] is that right
[1:11:51] praise god you don't approve of what the
[1:11:53] person is doing you don't compromise
[1:11:55] with what the person is doing but it's
[1:11:57] none of your business because the thing
[1:11:59] has come down to individual
[1:12:01] fear now personal temptation individual
[1:12:04] salvation individual revelation god
[1:12:06] working everything out for his glory and
[1:12:08] for his honor oh blessed be the name of
[1:12:11] the lord jesus christ
[1:12:13] now
[1:12:14] amen think of it adam and eve fell
[1:12:17] because they left the word
[1:12:19] the ephesian age fell they only turned
[1:12:23] slightly away from the world
[1:12:26] every succeeding age continued that to
[1:12:30] turn away from the word until we come to
[1:12:33] this ledecian church age with a complete
[1:12:37] repudiation of the world
[1:12:40] by the world council of churches
[1:12:43] see
[1:12:44] this ledecian church age then
[1:12:47] ends in a complete blackout
[1:12:51] complete blackout
[1:12:53] praise god
[1:12:55] remember it says the ledecian church age
[1:12:59] ends with complete blackout
[1:13:02] he's not talking about the bride
[1:13:05] ending with blackout
[1:13:07] he's not talking but he's elected
[1:13:09] because one they are walking in darkness
[1:13:12] their israelites had a light in the
[1:13:14] house
[1:13:15] and they were eating the lamb
[1:13:18] they're eating up the lamb
[1:13:21] and enjoying the the meal that they were
[1:13:23] having to pass over meal there weren't
[1:13:25] even in hatred of of them egyptians for
[1:13:28] what they did them for all those 400
[1:13:31] years as an old message i preach
[1:13:34] the true passover is learning how to
[1:13:37] get out of yourself get in the love of
[1:13:40] god get in the perfect word so that you
[1:13:42] can pass
[1:13:44] over
[1:13:46] the sins of others
[1:13:49] and the things that they've done to you
[1:13:52] people say how can you do that i
[1:13:54] actually had one preacher say but how
[1:13:57] could you how could you how could you
[1:13:59] forgive some that person how can you
[1:14:01] said yes i know it's hard for you to
[1:14:04] believe but to be honest i there's
[1:14:06] nothing
[1:14:07] there's nothing whatsoever i'm not
[1:14:09] putting on a show or trying to put on
[1:14:11] something trying a holier than
[1:14:14] than that we have years of that going on
[1:14:16] and still going on with many but we
[1:14:18] don't have to do that when it's the real
[1:14:20] thing has come to you the world has come
[1:14:21] to you and it's changed transformed you
[1:14:24] and made you into what you are a
[1:14:26] complete blackout to the word
[1:14:30] and this will cause a departure
[1:14:34] of the lord from their midst
[1:14:37] and that is why
[1:14:39] he stands
[1:14:41] outside
[1:14:43] knocking to his own
[1:14:46] to follow him come out
[1:14:49] of her my people
[1:14:51] be not partakers of our plagues
[1:14:53] amen
[1:14:54] follow him by obedience to the word
[1:14:58] but after a short and powerful
[1:15:00] demonstration of the spirit
[1:15:04] this
[1:15:05] now listen this because now he's
[1:15:07] speaking of prophecy and he's speaking
[1:15:09] but fulfillment to the word this
[1:15:12] little
[1:15:14] haunted
[1:15:16] so we will be haunted
[1:15:19] this little
[1:15:20] persecuted
[1:15:22] group will then go
[1:15:26] to be with jesus
[1:15:28] amen
[1:15:30] just a little short work praise god
[1:15:33] because we know the bride isn't going
[1:15:35] through tribulation
[1:15:37] the tribulation's not going to start the
[1:15:39] day after she leave
[1:15:41] it's going to phase itself in
[1:15:45] and we are going to just have a little
[1:15:47] taste but you're going out of here
[1:15:49] is that right as the prophet
[1:15:52] when he said it he says they're going to
[1:15:54] come to close you up
[1:15:56] but you're not just going to be closed
[1:15:58] up you're going up
[1:16:00] i'm going up with the first rapture and
[1:16:02] the first resurrection
[1:16:04] is that right praise god when he calls
[1:16:06] me i will answer let's stand and look to
[1:16:09] the lord and pray we're this we are
